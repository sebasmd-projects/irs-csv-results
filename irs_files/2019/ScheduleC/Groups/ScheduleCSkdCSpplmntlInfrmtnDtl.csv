The College paid membership dues to MPCC in the amount of $128,595 during the taxable year. MPCC has divided its expenses for its taxable year ending June 30, 2018, into two groups.

Group 2 includes many expenses, such as personnel costs, that supported both lobbying and nonlobbying activities. MPCC did not attempt to allocate the Group 2 expenses between lobbying and nonlobbying activities. MPCC has determined that the amount of the Group 2 expenses represents 80.30% of the amount of the dues that MPCC collected in the same taxable year.
