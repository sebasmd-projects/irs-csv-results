CONTRIBUTIONS ARE DESIGNED TAKING INTO CONSIDERATION LOST RETIREMENT BENEFITS THAT WOULD OTHERWISE BE OBTAINED THROUGH THE QUALIFIED PENSION PLAN. SUTTER'S PLANS ARE DESIGNED CONSISTENT WITH COMPETITIVE INDUSTRY PRACTICES. THE RETIREMENT PLAN FOR SUTTER HEALTH EMPLOYEES IS A COMBINATION OF 403(B) EMPLOYER MATCH CONTRIBUTIONS AND QUALIFIED PENSION PLAN BENEFITS. SUTTER HEALTH EXECUTIVES ARE GENERALLY INELIGIBLE FOR EMPLOYER MATCH CONTRIBUTIONS. TO ENSURE A COMPETITIVE RETIREMENT BENEFIT AND TO ADDRESS THE SHORTFALLS DESCRIBED ABOVE, SUTTER HEALTH MAKES AN ANNUAL CONTRIBUTION TO A NON-QUALIFIED 457(F) PLAN FOR ITS EXECUTIVES. THE FORMULA HAS TWO PARTS: (1) 4% TO 7% OF BASE SALARY (COMMENSURATE WITH MANAGEMENT LEVEL), PLUS (2) A CONTRIBUTION STARTING AT 5% (BASED UPON TENURE) FOR ELIGIBLE EARNINGS BEYOND THE IRS DEFINITION OF INCLUDIBLE COMPENSATION (""PENSION PAY CAP"").

TARGET BENEFIT LEVELS ARE DISCOUNTED FOR YEARS OF SERVICE LESS THAN 22.5 AT AGE 65.

A PORTION OF THE PLAN AWARD IS DISCRETIONARY IN THAT THE SUPERVISOR MAY ADD UP TO 5% TO THE AWARD PROVIDED THE TOTAL AWARD (FORMULA PORTION PLUS DISCRETIONARY) DOES NOT EXCEED THE MAXIMUM ESTABLISHED FOR ANY GIVEN EXECUTIVE. LONG TERM PERFORMANCE PLANS SUTTER HEALTH ALSO EMPLOYS A LONG TERM PERFORMANCE PLAN WHICH IS DESIGNED TO FOCUS ON LONGER TERM STRATEGIC OBJECTIVES OF THE ORGANIZATION. SUTTER'S LONG TERM PERFORMANCE PLAN APPROACH IS A COMBINATION OF BOTH LONGER TERM MEASURES OF ORGANIZATION SUCCESS AND KEY ORGANIZATION STRATEGIES WHICH REQUIRE THE COMBINED EFFORT OF ALL LEADERSHIP TO ACHIEVE SUCCESS. SUTTER USES A COMMON FATE APPROACH IN THAT ALL LONG TERM PERFORMANCE PLAN PARTICIPANTS ARE MEASURED AGAINST THE SAME, ORGANIZATION-WIDE CRITERIA VS. INDIVIDUAL EFFORTS. THIS FOSTERS A COMMON PURPOSE ACROSS LEADERSHIP AND A SHARED SENSE OF ACCOUNTABILITY FOR THE OVERALL SUCCESS OF SUTTER HEALTH. TO ENSURE THAT EXTRAORDINARY EFFORTS BY INDIVIDUALS CAN BE RECOGNIZED AND THAT ACTIONS OF LEADERSHIP ARE CONSISTENT WITH SUPPORTING SUTTER HEALTH'S OVERALL MISSION, VISION, AND VALUES, SUTTER'S LONG TERM PERFORMANCE PLAN APPROACH ALSO INCORPORATES A COMBINATION OF CEO AND SUTTER HEALTH COMPENSATION COMMITTEE DISCRETION. IN SOME CASES, THE SUTTER HEALTH COMPENSATION COMMITTEE HAS DELEGATED AUTHORITY TO THE PRESIDENT & CEO TO MODIFY INDIVIDUAL AWARDS WITHIN LIMITS THAT HAVE BEEN PRE-APPROVED BY THE SUTTER HEALTH COMPENSATION COMMITTEE. THIS INCLUDES BOTH THE REDUCTION AND INCREASE OF AWARD AMOUNTS. SUCH MODIFICATIONS GENERALLY DO NOT EXCEED +/- 20% AND ARE EMPLOYED JUDICIOUSLY.

The university did not utilize chartered flights for air travel. Extensive travel is required of the position of president and they are encouraged by the Board of Trustees to travel business or first class on flights of two hours or more. This provision is made for several reasons 1) business or first-class travel allows for the most flexibility to accommodate a travel schedule that must frequently be altered, often at the last minute to accommodate donors' schedules, add critical meetings, or to take advantage of other strategic opportunities for the university, 2) circumstances sometimes call for the president to return to campus without notice, or to remain on campus when a trip was planned, and first or business-class travel best accommodates these changing conditions, and 3) the Board of Trustees wishes the president to be at their best performance representing and seeking funding for the university during often grueling travel itineraries for meetings frequently critical to the institution's well-being. This accommodation was not treated as taxable compensation. H0USING ALLOWANCE OR RESIDENCE FOR PERSONAL USE: The president is required to live on campus in the university-owned president's residence where they regularly hold university events.

The procedure is designed to comply with the requirements of Section 4958 of the Internal Revenue Code and Internal Revenue Service regulations. The CORD Committee maintains a roster of disqualified persons, as defined by the IRS, for whose compensation the procedure is used. The roster is reviewed periodically but at least annually. The procedure was last discussed with the full board in March 2011. The procedure requires three elements as follows: 1) The terms of transactions are approved by the organization's governing body, or a committee thereof, whose members have no conflict of interest with respect to the arrangement. The Board of Trustees delegated authority to the CORD Committee to act on behalf of the Board in these matters at its meeting on March 25, 1999. Compensation arrangements are reviewed and approved by the CORD Committee before the effective date. Members of the CORD Committee recuse themselves from any vote in which there is a potential or actual conflict of interest. 2) The governing body or committee obtains and relies upon appropriate, comparable data before making its determination. Rice participates in the annual survey by Willis Towers Watson of select universities' executive compensation, and additional appropriate peer surveys. These reports reflect executive compensation in universities of a stature similar to that of Rice, and with which Rice competes for faculty and staff. The CORD Committee may also seek and rely on other relevant information, including compensation paid by other taxable and tax-exempt organizations for functionally comparable positions, geographic market forces, and actual written offers from similar institutions competing for services. The CORD Committee relies on this data and documents any determinations that reasonable compensation is an amount more than the range of comparable data. 3) The governing body or committee adequately documents the basis for making determinations concurrently with making decisions. Minutes documenting the deliberations of the CORD Committee are prepared contemporaneously for review and approval at its next meeting."

Compensation and benefits provided to this individual are determined pursuant to policies, procedures, and processes of AHSSHC that are designed to ensure compliance with the intermediate sanctions laws as set forth in IRC Section 4958. AHSSHC has taken steps to ensure that processes are in place to satisfy the rebuttable presumption of reasonableness standard as set forth in Treasury Regulation 53.4958-6 with respect to its active executive-level positions. The AHSSHC Board Compensation Committee (the Committee) serves as the governing body for all executive compensation matters. The Committee is composed of certain members of the Board of Directors (the Board) of AHSSHC. Voting members of the Committee include only individuals who serve on the Board as independent representatives of the community, who hold no employment positions with AHSSHC and who do not have relationships with any of the individuals whose compensation is under their review that impacts their best independent judgment as fiduciaries of AHSSHC. The Committee's role is to review and approve all components of the executive compensation plan of AHSSHC. As an independent governing body with respect to executive compensation, it should be noted that the Committee will often confer in executive sessions on matters of compensation policy and policy changes. In such executive sessions, no members of management of AHSSHC are present. The Committee is advised by an independent third party compensation advisor. This advisor prepares all the benchmark studies for the Committee. Compensation levels are benchmarked with a national peer group of other not-for-profit healthcare systems and hospitals of similar size and complexity to AH and each of its affiliated entities. The following principles guide the establishment of individual executive compensation: - The salary of the President/CEO of AH will not exceed the 40th percentile of comparable salaries paid by similarly situated organizations; and - Other executive salaries shall be established using market medians. The compensation philosophy, policies, and practices of AHSSHC are consistent with the organization's faith-based mission and conform to applicable laws, regulations, and business practices. As a faith-based organization sponsored by the Seventh-day Adventist Church (the Church), AHSSHC's philosophy and principles with respect to its executive compensation practices reflect the conservative approach of the Church's mission of service and were developed in counsel with the Church's leadership."
201941349349309419,593069793,"Part I, Line 4b","As discussed in Line 1a above, the President of the filing organization is compensated by and on the payroll of Adventist Health System Sunbelt Healthcare Corporation (AHSSHC), the parent organization of a healthcare system now known as AdventHealth (AH). In recognition of the contribution that each executive makes to the success of AH, AH provides to eligible executives participation in the AH Executive FLEX Benefit Program (the Plan). The purpose of the Plan is to offer eligible executives an opportunity to elect from among a variety of supplemental benefits, including a split dollar life insurance policy and long-term care insurance, to individually tailor a benefits program appropriate to each executive's needs. The Plan provides eligible participants a pre-determined benefits allowance credit that is equal to a percentage of the executive's base pay from which is deducted the cost of mandatory and elective employee benefits. The pre-determined benefits allowance credit percentage is approved by the AHSSHC Board Compensation Committee, an independent committee of the Board of Directors of AHSSHC. Any funds that remain after the cost of mandatory and elective benefits are subtracted from the annual pre-determined benefits allowance are contributed, at the employee's option, to either an IRC 457(f) deferred compensation account or to an IRC 457(b) eligible deferred compensation plan. Upon attainment of age 65, all previous 457(f) deferred amounts are paid immediately to the participant and any future employer contributions are made quarterly from the Plan directly to the participant. The Plan documents define an employee who is eligible to participate in the Plan to generally include the Chief Executive Officers of AH entities and Vice Presidents of all AH entities whose base salary is at least $243,000. The Plan provides for a class year vesting schedule (2 years for each class year) with respect to amounts accumulated in the executive's 457(f) deferred compensation account. Distributions could also be made from the executive's 457(f) deferred compensation account upon attainment of age 65 or upon an involuntary separation. The account is forfeited by the executive upon a voluntary separation. In addition to the Plan, AH has instituted a defined benefit, non-tax-qualified deferred compensation plan for certain executives who have provided lengthy service to AH and/or to other Seventh-day Adventist Church hospitals or health care institutions. Participation in the plan is offered to AH executives on a prorata schedule beginning with 20 years of service as an employee of AH and/or another hospital or health care institution controlled by the Seventh-day Adventist Church and who satisfy certain other qualifying criteria. This supplemental executive retirement plan (SERP) was designed to provide eligible executives with the economic equivalent of an annual income beginning at normal retirement age equal to 60% of the average of the participant's three, five or seven highest years of base salary from AH active employment inclusive of income from all other Seventh-day Adventist Church healthcare employer-financed retirement income sources and investment income earned on those contributions through social security normal retirement age as defined in the plan. The number of years included in highest average compensation is determined by the individual's year of entry to the SERP and by the individual's year of entry to the AH Executive FLEX Benefit Program. Additionally, in 2017 AH adopted a Senior Executive Death Benefit (SEDB) Plan in recognition of the considerable age and service requirements in the SERP. The SEDB Plan provides a benefit in an amount equal to the amount the executive's benefit would have been under the SERP Plan assuming that, on the date of the executive's death (and not before), the executive satisfied the last of the eligibility requirements of the SERP Plan with present value recognizing an early benefit commencement. An eligible executive becomes a participant in the SEDB Plan if the executive dies prior to termination of employment, provided the executive has not satisfied all of the eligibility requirements of SERP as of the executive's date of death but would have satisfied all of those requirements within five (5) years following death had the executive lived and continued employment.
