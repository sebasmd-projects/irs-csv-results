""Be of service"" is an integral core value which the Foundation demonstrates in a variety of ways. The Foundation provides treatment services to individuals and families who seek and qualify for care but are unable to pay the full cost. The Foundation's patient aid policy provides that the Foundation will annually establish a target amount of patient financial assistance. In addition to its annual provision for charity care, the Foundation provides a variety of other benefits for the public good including:Butler Center for Research: -The Butler Center for Research (BCR) is dedicated to improving recovery from addiction by conducting clinical and institutional research, collaborating with other research centers and communicating scientific findings. BCR's vision that sustained recovery for all who seek help will be achieved through advancements in knowledge and integration of research into practice. -In 2018, the BCR participated in the following activities: -As part of the Foundation's commitment to evidence-based practice, a variety of projects were conducted by the BCR to inform clinical care and academic programming, identify needs, drive data-based decision making, guide strategic planning and contribute to the field's knowledge of addiction treatment. Projects included data analyses, white papers, webinars, podcasts and industry trend reports, among others. -In 2018, the BCR collaborated with researchers from the Mayo Clinic who obtained a government grant to study the use of acamprosate, an FDA-approved medication targeting alcohol craving. Funded by the National Institute on Alcohol Abuse and Alcoholism (NIAAA), this project will work to identify biomarkers that may predict patient response to the use of the medication, with the hope of finding new genes linked to alcoholism treatment response. Detailed planning was conducted in 2018 in preparation for a 2019 launch. -The BCR also collaborated on another NIAAA grant-funded study with researchers from Virginia Commonwealth University. Titled, ""Genes, addiction and personality,"" this study is part of a genome-wide association study to learn more about the relationships between personality, mental health, substance use and genes. Data collection began in 2018 and will continue through 2019. -Research Updates were disseminated to professionals, educators, researchers, students and other stakeholders. These two-page summaries of scientific findings from the field of addiction treatment research are provided at no cost as a community benefit to policymakers, treatment professionals and the public at large. Research Updates are also available on the BCR web page at www.hazeldenbettyford.org/education/bcr/addiction-research. Five new Research Updates were created in 2018, including: Using Telehealth for Addiction Treatment, Grandparents Raising Grandchildren, Substance Use Disorders Among Military Population, Co-occuring Mental Health and Substance Use Disorders and Trauma-Informed Care for Substance Use Counseling.-In addition to the new Research Updates, the BRC published a series of informational summaries to help get consumers and clinicians on the same page.

At the Betty Ford Center in Rancho Mirage, California, staff scheduled and conducted 60 tours.-Volunteers at facilities in California, Illinois, Florida, Minnesota, New York, and Orgeon donated 13,884 hours, valued at more than $340,000.-In addition, educational scholarships from the Foundation totaling $5,200 were awarded to students at six high schools in the Twin Cities and Center City areas of Minnesota as well as two western Wisconsin high schools.-In Florida, the Foundation is an active member of the Collier Community Drug Response Team, an action-oriented work group that analyzes data and mobilizes support to overdose hotspots. And, for the 24th year, we co-sponsored and hosted our Women's Health Conference, a free, twice-annual community event that brings together medical providers and public health departments in Center City, Minnesota.Children's Programs:-The Foundation's Children's Program provides prevention and education services to children and families with addiction.

In 2018, 1,188 children and family members participated in the program.-Staff of the Children's Program also participated in the Red Ribbon Campaign at numerous schools in California and Colorado. Early prevention education and recovery awareness events were held in communities and schools, along with training sessions for school administrators, principals, counselors and teachers to provide information, resources and tools regarding the family disease of addiction.
