The subrecipient is advised of requirements imposed by governing laws, regulations, and provisions of contracts or grant agreements and supplemental requirements imposed by the pass-through entity. The subrecipient's activities are monitored to ensure awards are used for authorized purposes in compliance with laws, regulations, and the provisions of contracts or grant agreements and performance goals are achieved. Assurance is ascertained that any subrecipient expending $750,000 or more in Federal awards during the subrecipient's fiscal year must meet the audit requirements of Uniform Grant Guidance (formerly OMB A-133). A management decision on audit findings must be issued within six months after receipt of the subrecipient's audit report and ensure that the subrecipient takes appropriate and timely corrective action. A determination is made as to whether subrecipient audits necessitate adjustment of the pass-through entity's own records. Each subrecipient is required to permit the pass-through entity and auditors to have access to the records and financial statements as necessary for the pass-through entity to comply with this part. POST-AWARD SUBRECIPIENT MONITORING: The Principal Investigator (PI) or Program Director (PD) is responsible for monitoring the activities.

THE PORTFOLIO IS CONSTRUCTED TO GENERATE ATTRACTIVE LONG-TERM RETURNS, ADJUSTED FOR RISK, SO THAT THE ENDOWMENT CAN PROVIDE MEANINGFUL ANNUAL SUPPORT TO THE OPERATING BUDGET OF THE UNIVERSITY WHILE PRESERVING PURCHASING POWER ACROSS GENERATIONS. STANFORD'S INVESTMENT PROGRAM IS CONSISTENT WITH ITS FIDUCIARY RESPONSIBILITIES UNDER THE CALIFORNIA UNIFORM PRUDENT INVESTOR ACT.

OFFSHORE VEHICLES ARE STILL TAXED IN THE US, SPECIFICALLY ON INCOME THAT IS EFFECTIVELY CONNECTED TO THEIR OPERATIONS IN THE US, AS WELL AS ON DIVIDENDS RECEIVED FROM OPERATIONS DOMICILED IN THE US.

ACCORDINGLY, THESE GRANTS ARE REPORTED ON SCHEDULE F, PART I, AND ALSO REPORTED ON PARTS II AND III AS REQUIRED BY THE INSTRUCTIONS. FOR MOST UNITED STATES INSTITUTIONS OF HIGHER EDUCATION, PROVISION OF FINANCIAL AID TO STUDENTS IS AN IMPORTANT ACTIVITY ENABLING QUALIFIED STUDENTS TO OBTAIN A COLLEGE EDUCATION AT THE UNDERGRADUATE, GRADUATE OR POSTDOCTORAL LEVEL. STANFORD IS COMMITTED TO A ""NEED-BLIND"" ADMISSION POLICY FOR US CITIZENS AND PERMANENT RESIDENTS; IT ADMITS QUALIFIED STUDENTS WITHOUT REGARD TO THEIR ABILITY TO PAY, AND PROVIDES A COMPREHENSIVE FINANCIAL AID PROGRAM FOR ALL ADMITTED US STUDENTS WHO HAVE UNIVERSITY-COMPUTED NEED, AND WHO MEET STATED FINANCIAL AID ELIGIBILITY REQUIREMENTS. FOR THE FISCAL YEAR ENDED AUGUST 31, 2018 (FY 2018), 47% OF UNDERGRADUATE AND ABOUT 79% OF GRADUATE STUDENTS RECEIVED SOME FORM OF FINANCIAL AID, WITH A TOTAL OF $471,975,286 OF FINANCIAL AID DISBURSED TO ALL STANFORD STUDENTS. APPROXIMATELY 64% OF THIS AID TOOK THE FORM OF TRANSFERS FROM INTERNAL UNIVERSITY FUNDS (OFTEN IN ACCORDANCE WITH DONOR TERMS) TO OFFSET TUITION AND OTHER UNIVERSITY CHARGES THAT WOULD OTHERWISE HAVE BEEN RECEIVED BY THE UNIVERSITY. THE BALANCE OF $168,530,041 REPRESENTS DISBURSEMENTS, PRIMARILY TO GRADUATE STUDENTS, FOR STIPENDS, FELLOWSHIPS AND OTHER STUDENT AID IN SUPPORT OF ACADEMIC EFFORT. GRANTS TO ORGANIZATIONS ARE PRIMARILY IN THE FORM OF RESEARCH SUB-AWARDS. SUB-AWARDS ARE PAYMENTS TO THIRD PARTY RECIPIENTS FOR PERFORMING A PORTION OF A STANFORD RESEARCH PROGRAM, MOST OFTEN A SPONSORED-RESEARCH PROJECT. MANY SUB-AWARDS ARE AGREEMENTS FOR CONTRACTUALLY DEFINED DELIVERABLES, USUALLY REQUIRING HIGHLY SPECIFIC EXPERTISE. AS SUCH THEY COULD BE DESCRIBED AS RESEARCH CONTRACTS. HOWEVER, CERTAIN SUB-AWARDS ARE CATEGORIZED AS GRANTS, DEPENDING ON THE NATURE OF THE ORIGINATING PRIME FUNDING SOURCE, SINCE THE TERMS AND CONDITIONS OF THE ORIGINATING FUNDING SOURCE GENERALLY FLOW THROUGH TO THE SUB-AWARD.
