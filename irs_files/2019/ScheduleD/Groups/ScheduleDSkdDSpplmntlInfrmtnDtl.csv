The University is not classified as a private foundation. The University files a Form 990 (Return of Organization Exempt from Income Tax) annually. When these returns are filed, it is highly certain that some positions taken would be sustained upon examination by the taxing authorities, while others are subject to uncertainty about the merits of the tax position taken or the amount of the position that would ultimately be sustained. Examples of tax positions common to universities include such matters as the following: the tax exempt status of each entity and various positions relative to potential sources of unrelated business income tax (""UBIT""). UBIT is reported on Form 990-T, as appropriate. The benefit of a tax position is recognized in the financial statements in the period during which, based on all available evidence, management believes that it is more likely than not that the position will be sustained upon examination, including the resolution of appeals or litigation processes, if any. Tax positions are not offset or aggregated with other positions. Tax positions that meet the ""more likely than not"" recognition threshold are measured as the largest amount of tax benefit that is more than 50% likely to be realized on settlement with the applicable taxing authority. The portion of the benefits associated with tax positions taken that exceeds the amount measured as described above would be reflected as a liability for uncertain tax benefits in the accompanying statements of financial position along with any associated interest and penalties that would be payable to the taxing authorities upon examination. As of May 31, 2018 and 2017, there were no uncertain tax positions identified. The University does not expect the total amount of unrecognized tax benefits to significantly change in the next 12 months. Forms 990 and 990-T filed by the University are subject to examination by the Internal Revenue Service (IRS) up to three years from the extended due date of each return. Management believes the Forms 990 and 990-T have been filed appropriately. Forms 990 and 990-T filed by the University are no longer subject to examination for the fiscal years ended May 31, 2014 and prior. The University would recognize interest and penalties related to unrecognized tax positions in interest and income tax expense, respectively. The University did not recognize or accrue any interest or penalties as of May 31, 2018 and 2017, and for the years then ended."

Income tax expense is the tax payable or refundable for the period plus or minus the change during the period in deferred tax assets and liabilities.

Tax benefits will be recognized only if a tax position is more-likely-than-not sustained in a tax examination, with a tax examination being presumed to occur. The amount recognized will be the largest amount of tax benefit that is greater than 50% likely being realized on examination. For tax positions not meeting the more-likely-than-not test, no tax benefit will be recorded. Management has concluded that they are unaware of any tax benefits or liabilities to be recognized at June 30, 2018 and 2017. The College would recognize interest and penalties related to unrecognized tax benefits in interest and income tax expense, respectively. The College has no amounts accrued for interest or penalties for the year ended June 30, 2018 and 2017.

As such, the College is generally not subject to federal or state income taxes except for certain income derived from unrelated business activities as defined by the IRC. Any such taxes resulting from unrelated business activities are insignificant to the operations of the College. U.S. GAAP prescribes recognition thresholds and measurement attributes for the financial statement recognition and measurement of a tax position taken or expected to be taken in a tax return. Tax benefits will be recognized only if the tax position is more-likely-than-not sustained in a tax examination, with a tax examination being presumed to occur. The amount recognized will be the largest amount of tax benefit that is greater than 50% likely of being realized on examination. For tax positions not meeting the more-likely-than-not test, no tax benefit will be recorded. Management has concluded that they are unaware of any tax benefits or liabilities to be recognized at June 30, 2018 and 2017. The College does not expect the total amount of unrecognized tax benefits to significantly change in the next 12 months. The College would recognize interest and penalties related to unrecognized tax benefits in interest and income tax expense, respectively. The College has no amounts accrued for interest or penalties as of June 30, 2018 and 2017."

The policy is intended to balance current spending needs and preserve the endowment's future purchasing power. The University applies a 4.5% spending rate to a three-year moving average of endowment investment funds. The Board of Regents sets the spending rate. The purpose of using a moving average is to smooth out any wide fluctuations in the market value. Endowment earnings in excess of the spending rate are added back to the principal of the endowment investments. In years when yield exceeds the amount appropriated under the spending policy the excess is returned to principal as appreciation. When annual yield is insufficient to support spending appropriations, the balance is provided from accumulated appreciation. Special allocations are made for certain purposes in addition to the spending rate, as approved by the University's Board of Regents, annually."

As a curricular resource for all areas of study, the role of the collection is to conserve, interpret, and present works of art to the students, faculty, and greater community. New acquisitions support the vision of the university as an environment for innovative thinking and artistic experimentation. HISTORY OF THE COLLECTION The university's legacy of supporting the freedom of artistic expression began in 1931 with the commissioning of two historically significant mural cycles: Jose Clemente Orozco's A Call for Revolution and Universal Brotherhood, and Thomas Hart Benton's epic America Today. Over the years, the university has hosted a roster of accomplished artists, writers, dancers, designers, historians, social scientists, and philosophers, creating a flourishing laboratory for experimentation and innovation. As an institution that embraced such diverse figures as poet Robert Frost, anthropologist Margaret Meade, art historian Meyer Schapiro, and composer/conceptual artist John Cage, The New School has always stood at the forefront of self-discovery and visionary social, intellectual, and aesthetic experimentation. The New School art collection was established in 1960 with a grant from the Albert A. List Foundation. The collection, grown to approximately 2,000 postwar and contemporary works of art, includes examples in almost all media by some of the most innovative and creative artists of our time. Installed throughout the university campus and transforming the public spaces into lively forums for examining contemporary art, the collection offers students and faculty a rare opportunity to engage with art on a daily basis, making it a distinctive component of their educational experience. The collection has continued its tradition of incorporating site-specific works into its public spaces."
201911359349305486,133297197,"Part V, Line 4:","ENDOWMENT FUNDS The university's endowment is composed of approximately 304 individual funds established for a variety of purposes, including scholarships, professorships, faculty development, lectures, and research programs. The endowment consists of both donor restricted endowment funds and funds designated by the board of trustees to function as endowments. Net assets associated with endowment funds, including funds functioning as endowments, are classified and reported based on the existence or absence of donor imposed restrictions. The university's individual endowment funds are pooled for investment purposes. The investment portfolio is managed to achieve a prudent long term return. The university relies on a total return strategy in which investment returns are achieved through both capital appreciation (realized and unrealized) and current yield (interest and dividends). The university targets a diversified asset allocation that places a greater emphasis on equity based investments to achieve its long term return objectives within prudent risk constraints. The endowment assets are invested to provide a real total return that preserves the purchasing power of the endowment, while generating an income stream to support the academic activities of the university. Actual returns may vary from this goal in any given year. The university's endowment spending policy is designed to provide a sustainable and predictable flow of funds to support annual operations. The spending policy is intended to balance current spending needs and to preserve the endowment's future purchasing power. The university applies a board specified spending rate to a moving average of endowment investment funds. The purpose of using a moving average is to smooth out any wide fluctuations in the market value. Endowment earnings in excess of the spending rate are added back to the principal of the endowment investments. Prior to fiscal year 2012, the board specified spending rate was 5%. Beginning with fiscal year 2012, the spending rate was reduced to 4% using a ""soft landing"" approach. The fiscal year 2011 appropriation will be used as the annual appropriation until the investment portfolio increases sufficiently over time to result in an effective 4% spending rate. Thereafter, the 4% spending rate would be applied against the average of the previous 16 quarters' fair value of the endowment portfolio."

In order to achieve the objective of mainlining purchasing power, the endowment's annual rate of return must equal the annual distribution, plus inflation, plus management, custodial and administrative fees. The distribution to the University is based on a 12 quarter moving average of the market value.

Its endowment includes both donor-restricted endowment funds and funds designated by the Board of Trustees to function as endowments. As required by U.S. generally accepted accounting principles (GAAP), net assets associated with endowment funds, including funds designated by the Board of Trustees to function as endowments, are classified and reported based on the existence or absence of donor-imposed restrictions. The College has adopted investment and spending policies for endowment assets that attempt to provide a predictable stream of funding to programs supported by its endowment while seeking to maintain the purchasing power of the endowment assets. Endowment assets include those assets of donor-restricted funds that the College must hold in perpetuity or for a donor-specified period(s) as well as board-designated funds. Under this policy, as approved by the Board of Trustees, the endowment assets are invested in a manner that is intended to produce results that exceed the price and yield results of appropriate market indices while assuming a moderate level of investment risk. The College's investment objectives are to provide a total return sufficient to support the College's operating budget while preserving the assets against inflation. To meet these objectives the Board seeks a total return of at least 5% greater than the rate of inflation as measured by the Consumer Price Index (U.S. CPI-U) over a long-term horizon. Total return is defined as dividends or interest income, plus or minus realized and unrealized capital appreciation or depreciation at fair market value, net of fees. The maximum amount of endowment income utilization is determined by a spending formula approved by the Board of Trustees. The amount available for spending is set at 5% of the previous three-year average market value for the years ended June 30, 2018 and 2017, respectively. The amounts available to be distributed, net of unspent endowment income, under the spending policy were $633,367 and $596,399 for the years ended June 30, 2018 and 2017, respectively. These amounts are included in change in net assets from operations. Investment income greater or less than the amounts available to be distributed under the spending policy is reported as nonoperating income."

As of the end of the current year, the Institutes information returns filed with the Internal Revenue Service remain open for examination generally for three years after they were filed. The Institute follows the Financial Accounting Standards Board Accounting Standards Codification (FASB ASC), which provides guidance on accounting for uncertainty in income taxes recognized in an organizations financial statements. The guidance prescribes a recognition threshold and measurement attribute for the financial statement recognition and measurement of a tax position taken or expected to be taken in a tax return, and also provides guidance on derecognition, classification, interest and penalties, accounting in interim periods, disclosure, and transition. Examples of tax positions include the tax-exempt status of the Institute and various positions related to the potential sources of unrelated business income tax (UBIT). As of the year end, the Institute had no uncertain tax positions that qualified for either recognition of an unrecognized tax benefit or disclosure in its financial statements. The Institutes policy is to recognize interest and penalties, if any, on tax positions related to its unrecognized tax benefits in income tax expense in the financial statements.

The College is also recognized by the Franchise Tax Board as exempt from California state tax on related income under Section 23701d of the California Revenue and Taxation Code. The College has identified and evaluated significant tax positions in its significant tax jurisdictions which are the federal and California state tax jurisdictions. The College has also determined that the open tax years are generally three years for federal and four years for California tax purposes. Thus, the general open tax years are the years ended June 30, 2014 through June 30, 2017 for federal purposes and the years ended June 30, 2013 through June 30, 2017 for California purposes. For federal there is an unrelated business income net operating loss carryover of approximately $1,795,000 and $1 ,529,000 as of June 30, 2018 and 2017, respectively. For California there is an unrelated business income net operating loss carryover of approximately $1,745,000 and $1,529,000 as of June 30, 2018 and 2017, respectively. A net operating loss can only be reflected as a benefit (deferred tax asset) on the statement of financial position when it is likely that the loss would be utilized against taxable income in another tax year. Since there is not presently a likelihood of taxable income in another tax year, the College has recorded a full valuation allowance for the deferred tax assets on the statement of financial position for these net operating loss carryovers. There have been no related tax penalties or interest, which would be classified as tax expense in the statement of activities. The net operating loss carryover will begin to expire June 30, 2025 for federal purposes and June 30, 2018 for California purposes. The College applied ASC 740-10-25, Accounting for Uncertainty in Income Taxes, to all tax positions for which the statute of limitations remained open and determined there were no material unrecognized tax benefits as of the year ended June 30, 2018 and the year ended June 30, 2017, nor are any changes anticipated in the twelve months following June 30, 2018."

The Foundation is exempt from income taxes under Section 501(c)(3) of the United States Internal Revenue Code and a similar provision of state law. However, the Foundation is subject to federal income tax on any unrelated business taxable income. The Foundation is not considered to be a private foundation. Current accounting standards require the Foundation to disclose the amount of potential benefit or obligation to be realized as a result of an examination performed by a taxing authority. For the year ended June 30, 2018 and 2017, management has determined that the Foundation does not have any tax positions that result in any uncertainties regarding the possible impact on the Foundation's financial statements. The Foundation does not expect the total amount of unrecognized tax benefits to significantly change in the next 12 months. The Foundation recognizes interest and/or penalties related to income tax matters in income tax expense. The Foundation did not have any amounts accrued for interest and penalties at June 30, 2018 and 2017. As a not-for-profit entity, the Foundation is exempt from federal and state income taxes. However, its wholly-owned subsidiary, Park LLC, is a for-profit Indiana entity subject to federal and state income taxes. Park LLC has net operating loss carry forwards of approximately $5,816 and $6,375 as of June 30, 2018 and 2017, respectively.

SACKLER MUSEUM) AND FOUR RESEARCH CENTERS (STRAUS CENTER FOR CONSERVATION AND TECHNICAL STUDIES, CENTER FOR THE TECHNICAL STUDY OF MODERN ART, HARVARD ART MUSEUM ARCHIVES, ARCHAEOLOGICAL EXPLORATION OF SARDIS, TURKEY). THE MUSEUMS' COLLECTION CONSISTS OF MORE THAN 250,000 OBJECTS IN ALL MEDIA, RANGING IN DATE FROM ANTIQUITY TO THE PRESENT WITH WORLDWIDE ORIGINS. THE COLLECTION IS AN IMPORTANT RESOURCE FOR THE HARVARD UNIVERSITY COMMUNITY, AS WELL AS TO A BROADER AUDIENCE OF STUDENTS, SCHOLARS, AND THE GENERAL PUBLIC. IT IS USED TO ADVANCE THE KNOWLEDGE AND APPRECIATION OF ART AND ART MUSEUMS THROUGH PROGRAMS INVOLVING RESEARCH, TEACHING, PROFESSIONAL TRAINING, AND PUBLIC EDUCATION. ARNOLD ARBORETUM: THE ARNOLD ARBORETUM OF HARVARD UNIVERSITY IS THE OLDEST PUBLIC ARBORETUM IN NORTH AMERICA AND ONE OF THE WORLD'S LEADING CENTERS FOR THE STUDY OF PLANTS. ADMINISTERED BY THE OFFICE OF THE PROVOST OF HARVARD UNIVERSITY AND A LINK IN BOSTON'S EMERALD NECKLACE OF PARKS, THE ARNOLD ARBORETUM IS A UNIQUE BLEND OF RESPECTED RESEARCH INSTITUTION AND BELOVED PUBLIC LANDSCAPE. WE PROVIDE AND SUPPORT WORLD-CLASS RESEARCH, HORTICULTURE, AND EDUCATION PROGRAMS THAT FOSTER THE UNDERSTANDING, APPRECIATION, AND PRESERVATION OF TREES. COLLECTION OF HISTORICAL SCIENTIFIC INSTRUMENTS: HARVARD UNIVERSITY HAS BEEN ACQUIRING SCIENTIFIC INSTRUMENTS ON A CONTINUOUS BASIS FOR TEACHING AND RESEARCH SINCE 1672. THE COLLECTION OF HISTORICAL SCIENTIFIC INSTRUMENTS, WHICH WAS ESTABLISHED IN 1948 TO PRESERVE THIS APPARATUS AS A RESOURCE FOR TEACHING AND RESEARCH IN THE HISTORY OF SCIENCE AND TECHNOLOGY, HAS BECOME ONE OF THE THREE LARGEST UNIVERSITY COLLECTIONS OF ITS KIND IN THE WORLD. IT CONTAINS OVER 20,000 OBJECTS DATING FROM ABOUT 1400 TO THE PRESENT. A BROAD RANGE OF SCIENTIFIC DISCIPLINES ARE REPRESENTED, INCLUDING ASTRONOMY, NAVIGATION, HOROLOGY, SURVEYING, GEOLOGY, CALCULATING, PHYSICS, BIOLOGY, MEDICINE, PSYCHOLOGY, ELECTRICITY, AND COMMUNICATION. SIGNIFICANT INSTRUMENTS, MADE OBSOLETE BY NEW TECHNOLOGIES, CONTINUE TO BE INCORPORATED. MANY OF THE DOCUMENTS DETAILING THE PURCHASE AND USE OF THE INSTRUMENTS HAVE BEEN PRESERVED, AND ARE AVAILABLE FOR RESEARCH IN THE COLLECTION'S ADJUNCT LIBRARY. MUSEUM OF COMPARATIVE ZOOLOGY (WITHIN THE MUSEUM OF NATURAL HISTORY): THE MUSEUM OF COMPARATIVE ZOOLOGY (THE MCZ) WAS FOUNDED IN 1859 ON THE CONCEPT THAT COLLECTIONS ARE AN INTEGRAL AND FUNDAMENTAL COMPONENT OF ZOOLOGICAL RESEARCH AND TEACHING. THIS 150-YEAR-OLD COMMITMENT REMAINS A STRONG AND PROUD TRADITION FOR THE MCZ. THE PRESENT-DAY MCZ CONTAINS OVER 21 MILLION SPECIMENS IN TEN RESEARCH COLLECTIONS WHICH COMPRISE ONE OF THE WORLD'S RICHEST AND MOST VARIED RESOURCES FOR STUDYING THE DIVERSITY OF LIFE. THE MUSEUM SERVES AS THE PRIMARY REPOSITORY FOR ZOOLOGICAL SPECIMENS COLLECTED BY PAST AND PRESENT HARVARD FACULTY-CURATORS, STAFF AND ASSOCIATES CONDUCTING RESEARCH AROUND THE WORLD. AS A PREMIER UNIVERSITY MUSEUM AND RESEARCH INSTITUTION, THE SPECIMENS AND THEIR RELATED DATA ARE AVAILABLE TO RESEARCHERS OF THE SCIENTIFIC AND MUSEUM COMMUNITY. USE OF THE COLLECTIONS IN STUDENT RESEARCH IS ALSO ENCOURAGED. FISHER MUSEUM HARVARD FOREST: THE FISHER MUSEUM'S MAIN EXHIBIT DISPLAYS TWENTY-THREE INTERNATIONALLY ACCLAIMED MODELS (DIORAMAS) PORTRAYING THE HISTORY, CONSERVATION AND MANAGEMENT OF CENTRAL NEW ENGLAND FORESTS. OTHER EXHIBITS AT THE MUSEUM REPRESENT THE RANGE OF HARVARD FOREST'S RESEARCH. HARVARD UNIVERSITY HERBARIA (WITHIN MUSEUM OF NATURAL HISTORY): THE HARVARD UNIVERSITY HERBARIA ARE AMONG SOME SEVERAL THOUSAND COLLECTIONS OF PRESSED, DRIED PLANT SPECIMENS WORLDWIDE THAT ARE USED BY RESEARCHERS TO FURTHER OUR UNDERSTANDING OF THE PLANT WORLD. SOME OF THE EARLIEST HERBARIA WERE FOUNDED IN EUROPE IN THE EARLY 1600'S, DURING THE DAYS OF EXPLORATION, WHEN KNOWLEDGE OF THE EARTH'S FLORA WAS GROWING AT SUCH A RAPID PACE THAT BOTANICAL GARDENS COULD NO LONGER MAINTAIN LIVING EXAMPLES OF EVERY KNOWN SPECIES. WHILE HERBARIUM COLLECTIONS OF ALL SIZES EXIST TODAY, THERE ARE FEWER THAN 75 HERBARIA WORLDWIDE WITH MORE THAN ONE MILLION SPECIMENS. HERBARIUM COLLECTIONS HAVE BEEN BUILT BY THE EFFORTS OF NUMEROUS BOTANISTS AND PLANT COLLECTORS WHO SEARCHED FROM REMOTE AND ISOLATED JUNGLES TO INNER CITY WASTE LOTS AND RAILROAD TRACKS TO DOCUMENT THE DIVERSITY AND DISTRIBUTION OF THE EARTH'S FLORA. REPRESENTATIVES OF MOST KNOWN SPECIES OF PLANTS CAN BE FOUND IN HERBARIA TODAY, CAREFULLY MOUNTED ON SHEETS OF ARCHIVAL QUALITY PAPER, LABELED WITH IMPORTANT INFORMATION ABOUT THEM, AND STORED ON SHELVES IN CABINETS. IN ESSENCE, A HERBARIUM IS ANALOGOUS TO A LIBRARY OF CAREFULLY PRESERVED PLANTS WHERE THE SPECIMENS THEMSELVES AND THE LABELS ASSOCIATED WITH THEM PROVIDE A WEALTH OF INFORMATION ONCE THEY HAVE BEEN ""READ"" AND STUDIED BY SCIENTISTS. THE SPECIMENS ARE THE KEY TO UNDERSTANDING PLANT RELATIONSHIPS, GEOGRAPHIC DISTRIBUTIONS, ECONOMIC USEFULNESS, EVEN THEIR MOLECULAR MAKEUP. AS WE LOSE NATURAL HABITATS THE WORLD OVER, HERBARIA INCREASINGLY SERVE AS A RECORD OF THE RECENT HISTORY OF PLANT LIFE, AND AS A REPOSITORY OF PRECIOUS GENETIC INFORMATION. HERBARIA HOLD THE TOOLS FOR OUR UNDERSTANDING OF THE PLANT WORLD. MINERALOGICAL AND GEOLOGICAL MUSEUM (WITHIN MUSEUM OF NATURAL HISTORY): THE HARVARD MINERAL COLLECTION RANKS AMONG THE WORLD'S FINEST DUE TO ITS VERY BROAD REPRESENTATION, WEALTH OF RARE SPECIES; LARGE NUMBER OF SPECIMENS DESCRIBED IN THE SCIENTIFIC LITERATURE; AND THE QUALITY OF ITS DISPLAY SPECIMENS. A RICH SYSTEMATIC MINERAL COLLECTION AND DISPLAYS OF GEMSTONES ARE THE PRINCIPAL EXHIBITS IN THE MINERAL GALLERY. THE MUSEUM IS COMMITTED TO THE DEVELOPMENT AND PRESERVATION OF WORLD-CLASS COLLECTIONS OF MINERALS, GEMS, ROCKS, ORES, AND METEORITES FOR RESEARCH, EDUCATION, AND PUBLIC DISPLAY. ITS EARLIEST COLLECTIONS DATE BACK TO THE LATE 18TH CENTURY. THE MUSEUM CATERS TO THE HARVARD STUDENTS AND FACULTY AS WELL AS THE GEOLOGICAL COMMUNITY AT LARGE BY SERVING AS A UNIQUELY RICH RESOURCE OF MATERIALS AND INFORMATION. PEABODY MUSEUM OF ARCHAEOLOGY AND ETHNOLOGY: THE PEABODY MUSEUM OF ARCHAEOLOGY AND ETHNOLOGY IS STEWARD TO ONE OF THE OLDEST AND LARGEST COLLECTIONS OF CULTURAL OBJECTS IN THE WESTERN HEMISPHERE. SINCE THE LATE NINETEENTH CENTURY, THE MUSEUM HAS PLAYED AN ACTIVE PART IN THE HISTORY OF AMERICAN ANTHROPOLOGY AND IN THE EVOLVING RELATIONSHIP BETWEEN MUSEUMS AND NATIVE PEOPLES. THE PEABODY STRIVES TO MAKE COLLECTIONS WIDELY ACCESSIBLE AND ENGAGE ISSUES OF CONCERN TO DIVERSE AUDIENCES. TODAY, THE PEABODY HOUSES MORE THAN SIX MILLION INDIVIDUAL OBJECTS, 500,000 PHOTOGRAPHIC IMAGES, AND SUBSTANTIAL ARCHIVAL RECORDS. STRONGEST IN THE CULTURES OF NORTH, CENTRAL, AND SOUTH AMERICA, AND THE PACIFIC ISLANDS, THE PEABODY IS ALSO CARETAKER TO IMPORTANT COLLECTIONS FROM AFRICA, EUROPE, AND ASIA. COLLECTION TYPES INCLUDE ARCHAEOLOGY; ETHNOGRAPHY; OSTEOLOGY; AND PAINTING, DRAWING, AND PRINTS. SEMITIC MUSEUM: THE SEMITIC MUSEUM IS HOME TO THE UNIVERSITY'S COLLECTIONS OF NEAR EASTERN ARCHAEOLOGICAL ARTIFACTS. THESE ARTIFACTS COMPRISE OVER 40,000 ITEMS, INCLUDING POTTERY, CYLINDER SEALS, SCULPTURE, COINS AND CUNEIFORM TABLETS. MANY ARE FROM MUSEUM-SPONSORED EXCAVATIONS IN ISRAEL, JORDAN, IRAQ, EGYPT, CYPRUS, AND TUNISIA. THE MUSEUM IS DEDICATED TO THE USE OF THESE COLLECTIONS FOR THE TEACHING, RESEARCH, AND PUBLICATION OF NEAR EASTERN ARCHAEOLOGY, HISTORY, AND CULTURE. WARREN ANATOMICAL MUSEUM: THE WARREN ANATOMICAL MUSEUM'S PRESENT COLLECTION CONTAINS APPROXIMATELY 15,000 ARTIFACTS AND CASES INCLUDING: ANATOMICAL AND PATHOLOGICAL PREPARATIONS; VARIOUS WAX, PAPER MACHE, AND DRY PREPARATION ANATOMICAL MODELS; PHOTOGRAPHS, PRINTS, PAINTINGS, AND DRAWINGS; MEDICAL INSTRUMENTS AND MACHINES; AND OTHER MEDICAL MEMORABILIA. ALONG WITH THE WELL-KNOWN SKULL OF PHINEAS GAGE, THE MUSEUM HOLDS MANY OTHER RARE AND INTERESTING ITEMS. AMONG THESE ARE THE PHRENOLOGICAL COLLECTION OF JOHANN GASPAR SPURZHEIM, THE BOSTON SOCIETY FOR MEDICAL IMPROVEMENT COLLECTION, AND A W. T. G. MORTON-TYPE ETHER INHALER. THE MUSEUM PROMOTES THE COLLECTION FOR THE PURPOSES OF MEDICAL EDUCATION IN ALL FORMS WHENEVER POSSIBLE, BY EXPANDING ITS SCOPE TO PROVIDE PUBLIC PROGRAMMING AND EDUCATIONAL RESOURCES TO THE LARGER COMMUNITY. CARPENTER CENTER FOR THE VISUAL ARTS: CARPENTER CENTER FOR THE VISUAL ARTS IS DEDICATED TO THE SYNTHESIS OF ART, DESIGN, AND EDUCATION THROUGH THE EXHIBITION OF EXISTING WORKS AND PRODUCTION OF NEW COMMISSIONS. IT STRIVES TO BRING PEOPLE, IDEAS, AND OBJECTS TOGETHER IN GENERATIVE WAYS THAT PROVIDE UNPARALLELED EXPERIENCES WITH CONTEMPORARY ART, ULTIMATELY ENRICHING THE CREATIVE AND INTELLECTUAL LIVES OF THEIR AUDIENCES."

The Foundation uses a comprehensive model for recognizing, measuring, presenting and disclosing in the financial statements tax positions taken or expected to be taken on a tax return. A tax position is recognized as a benefit only if it is ""more likely than not"" that the tax position would be sustained in a tax examination, with a tax examination being presumed to occur. The amount recognized is the largest amount of tax benefit that is greater than 50% likely of being realized on examination. For tax positions not meeting the ""more likely than not"" test, no tax benefit is recorded. The effect of applying this model and the resulting identification of uncertain tax positions, if any, were not considered significant for financial reporting purposes.

It is located at the heart of the Dana fine arts building, a structure built in 1965 and designed by John Portman, which houses the art history and studio art department. It also houses the theatre department. In support of the mission of the college, the focus of new acquisitions is largely but not exclusively works by women artists on paper. Artwork is selected and donations accepted with consideration to how they will benefit the campus learning environment. The collection is actively used within the arts curriculum and across disciplines. The art department offers three undergraduate majors, including studio art and art history, to students. In addition, students write visual analyses of works and five tours to the public. Informative wall text is researched and written by students under the guidance of faculty. Works by Agnes Scott students are embraced into the overall display, including a vibrant body of self-portrait woodblock prints that are sited in dorms and public buildings. Furthermore, along with a student show, the gallery presents two exhibits a year which include a roster of local, national, and international professional artists and are organized around an inclusive theme that engages contemporary issues, focusing not only on the world of art but also on the larger global conversation. Having such a dynamic teaching collection borne from a mission of education enriches the learning environment and connects the viewer in a timeless dialogue."

THE STUDENTS TAKE A BRIEF TOUR; VISIT THE LEARNING CIRCLE UNDER THE WHALE TO TOUCH DIFFERENT SPECIMENS AND THEN SET OFF TO WORK ON AN ACTIVITY SHEET SELECTED BY THE TEACHER. BECAUSE THE MUSEUM IS AN INTIMATE SPACE, FILLED WITH SPECIMENS, CHILDREN ARE ABLE TO MAKE OBSERVATIONS, EXPLORE DIFFERENCES AMONG THE SPECIMENS, AND THINK ABOUT THEM. THE MUSEUM HOSTS MANY HOME SCHOOL FAMILIES AND ALSO IS USED BY OUR BENEDICTINE STUDENTS FOR CLASS ASSIGNMENTS IN BIOLOGY, ART AND EDUCATION. THERE ARE OVER 5,000 VISITORS TO THE MUSEUM EACH YEAR. IN ADDITION, THE JURICA-SUCHY NATURE MUSEUM OFFERS A DISCOVERY BOX LOAN PROGRAM OF MORE THAN 40 BOXES FOR TEACHERS, HOME SCHOOL FAMILIES AND OTHER GROUPS.

Its investment and spending policies are designed to balance the needs of current Dartmouth students with the needs of future generations of Dartmouth students.

The endowment is composed of both restricted funds, for which donors designate a specific purpose for their gifts, and unrestricted funds. There are over 6,000 separate funds that make up Dartmouth's endowment. Dartmouth's endowment spending policy seeks to balance the competing objectives of supporting the current generation of students and faculty with the need to preserve the endowment's purchasing power for future generations. Distributions from the endowment, which are approved annually by the Board of Trustees, are intended to support Dartmouth's mission by contributing funding to support financial aid and a variety of needs in academic, research and student life activities."

This guidance provides that the tax effects from an uncertain tax position can only be recognized in the financial statements if the position is ""more-likely-than-not"" to be sustained if the position were to be challenged by a taxing authority. The assessment of the tax position is based solely on the technical merits of the position, without regard to the likelihood that the tax position may be challenged. The College is exempt from federal income tax under IRC section 501(c)(3), though it is subject to tax on income unrelated to its exempt purpose, unless that income is otherwise excluded by the Code. The College has processes in place to ensure the maintenance of its tax-exempt status; to identify and report unrelated income; to determine its filing and tax obligation in jurisdictions for which it was nexus; and to identify and evaluate other matters that may be considered tax positions. The College has determined that there are no material uncertain tax positions that require recognition or disclosure in the financial statements."

As such, the University is generally not subject to federal or state income taxes except for certain income derived from unrelated business activities as defined by the IRC. Any such taxes resulting from unrelated business activities are insignificant to the operations of the University. U.S. GAAP prescribes recognition thresholds and measurement attributes for the financial statement recognition and measurement of a tax position taken or expected to be taken in a tax return. Tax benefits will be recognized only if the tax position is more-likely-than-not sustained in a tax examination, with a tax examination being presumed to occur. The amount recognized will be the largest amount of tax benefit that is greater than 50% likely of being realized on examination. For tax positions not meeting the more-likely-than-not test, no tax benefit will be recorded. Management is unaware of any tax benefits or liabilities to be recognized at June 30, 2018 and 2017. The University is no longer subject to examination by U.S. federal taxing authorities for years before 2015 and for all state income taxes before 2015.

The accounting standard on accounting for uncertainty in income taxes addresses the determination of whether tax benefits claimed or expected to be claimed on a tax return should be recorded in the financial statements. Under this guidance, the College may recognize the tax benefit from an uncertain tax position only if it is more likely than not that the tax position will be sustained on examination by taxing authorities, based on the technical merits of the position. Examples of tax positions include the tax-exempt status of the College and various positions related to the potential sources of unrelated business taxable income. The tax benefits recognized in the financial statements from such a position are measured based on the largest benefit that has a greater than 50 percent likelihood of being realized upon ultimate settlement. The guidance on accounting for uncertainty in income taxes also addresses de-recognition, classification, interest and penalties on income taxes, and accounting in interim periods. There were no unrecognized tax benefits identified or recorded as liabilities during the periods covered by these financial statements. The College files Form 990 in the U.S. federal jurisdiction and the State of Illinois.

Sayers, George MacDonald, G.K. Chesterton, Owen Barfield, and Charles Williams. The Wade Center implements these goals by: Assisting scholars in their study of unique materials by and about these seven authors in order to generate new understandings; Sharing insights with a broader audience through our numerous programs and publications; Supporting artistic works inspired by our authors; Welcoming visitors to our museum. The Wade Center is open to the general public as well as the Wheaton College community. There is no admission fee. The Archaeology Museum contains more than 14,000 artifacts excavated by Joseph P.

The endowment includes both donor-restricted endowment funds and funds designated by the Board of Trustees to function as endowments (board-designated endowment funds). In accordance with GAAP, net assets associated with endowment funds are classified and reported based on the existence or absence of donor-imposed restrictions. The College has interpreted Ohio's enacted version of UPMIFA as requiring the preservation of the fair value of the original gift as of the gift date absent explicit donor instructions to the contrary. The College classifies as permanently restricted net assets the original gift value plus the value of subsequent gifts to the permanent endowment. The permanent endowment is not reduced by losses on the investments, except to the extent required by the donor, or by appropriations from the endowment fund. The accumulated portion of a donor-restricted fund that is not permanently restricted is classified as temporarily restricted net assets until appropriated for expenditure by the College in a manner consistent with the standard of prudence prescribed by Ohio's enacted version of UPMIFA. Appropriations from the endowment are used to support scholarships and loans, faculty and academic program support, student awards and prizes, and the general operations of the College."

As such, the College is generally not subject to federal or state income taxes except for amounts derived from unrelated business activities as defined by the IRC. The College adopted the accounting standard on accounting for uncertainty in income taxes, which addresses the determination of whether tax benefits claimed or expected to be claimed on a tax return should be recorded in the financial statements. Under this guidance, the College may recognize the tax benefit from an uncertain tax position only if it is more likely than not that the tax position will be sustained on examination by taxing authorities, based on the technical merits of the position. Examples of tax positions include the tax-exempt status of the College, the continued tax-exempt status of bonds issued by the College, and various positions related to the potential sources of unrelated business taxable income (UBIT). The tax benefits recognized in the financial statements from such a position are measured based on the largest benefit that has a greater than 50 percent likelihood of being realized upon ultimate settlement. The guidance on accounting for uncertainty in income taxes also addresses de-recognition, classification, interest and penalties on income taxes, and accounting in interim periods. At June 30, 2017 and 2016, there were no unrecognized tax benefits identified or recorded as liabilities. With few exceptions, the College is no longer subject to examinations by tax authorities for fiscal years prior to 2014."

The University files a Form 990 annually. When these returns are filed , it is highly certain that some positions taken would be sustained upon examination by the taxing authorities, while others are subject to uncertainty about the merits of the tax position taken or the amount of the position that would ultimately be sustained. Examples of tax positions common to universities include such matters as the following: the tax exempt status of each entity and various positions relative to potential sources of unrelated business income tax (UBIT). UBIT is reported on Form 990-T, as appropriate. The benefit of a tax position is recognized in the financial statements in the period during which, based on all available evidence, management believes that it is more likely than not that the position will be sustained upon examination, including the resolution of appeals or litigation processes, if any. Tax positions are not offset or aggregated with other positions. Tax positions that meet the ""more likely than not"" recognition threshold are measured as the largest amount of tax benefit that is more than 50% likely to be realized on settlement with the applicable taxing authority. The portion of the benefits associated with tax positions taken that exceeds the amount measured as described above would be reflected as a liability for uncertain tax benefits in the accompanying statements of financial position along with any associated interest and penalties that would be payable to the taxing authorities upon examination. As of June 30, 2018 and 2017, there were no uncertain tax positions identified. The University does not expect the total amount of unrecognized tax benefits to significantly change in the next 12 months. Forms 990 and 990-T filed by the University are subject to the examination by the IRS up to three years from the extended due date of each return. Management believes the Forms 990 and 990-T have been filed appropriately.
