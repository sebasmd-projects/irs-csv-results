201803199349303295,111631796,"Part III, Line 9b:","POLICY AND PURPOSE: The purpose of the Collection Policy (Policy) is to promote patient access to quality health care while minimizing bad debt at NYP/BMH. This Policy places requirements upon Hospital and those agencies and attorneys undertaking debt collection activities that are consistent with the core mission, values, and principles of Hospital including, but not limited to, Hospitals Charity Care Policy. This policy applies to hospital and any agency, lawyer, or law firm assisting hospital in the collection of an outstanding patient account debt. PROCEDURE: A. General guidelines 1. Hospital, collection agencies (Agency), and lawyers and law firms (Outside Counsel) will comply with all applicable federal and state laws and accrediting agency requirements governing the collection of debts including, but not limited to, the Fair Debt Collection Practices Act (FDCPA), the Fair Credit Billing Act, the Consumer Credit Protection Acts, Public Health Law Section 2807-k-9-a, Internal Revenue Service Code 501(r), Article 52 of the New York Civil Practice Law and Rules, and the Health Insurance Portability and Accountability Act (HIPAA). Hospital, Agency and Outside Counsel will also comply with Hospitals Charity Care Policy. To the extent that there are any inconsistencies between Hospitals Collection Policy and Charity Care Policy, the Charity Care Policy shall supersede and control. 2. Hospital shall enter legally binding written agreements with any parties (including Agency or Outside Counsel) to which it refers an individuals debt related to care that are reasonably designed to prevent Extraordinary Collection Actions (ECAs) from being taken to obtain payment for the care, until reasonable efforts have been made to determine whether the individual is eligible for Charity Care."
201803199349303295,111631796,"Part VI, Line 2:","Needs Assessment: Based on results from the Community Health Survey, discussions with key informants in the community, and review of New York States Prevention Area Priorities, NYP/BMH has selected the following prevention priorities: 1) Prevent Chronic Disease; focus on diabetes 2) Prevent Chronic Disease; focus on childhood obesity/ (overlaps with) Promote Healthy Women, Infants and Children; focus on maternal and infant health. 3) Promote a Healthy and Safe Environment; reducing fall risk among most vulnerable populations. The Brooklyn community helped to select the interventions via key informant meetings and a Community Health Survey which appeared on NewYork-Presbyterian/Brooklyn Methodist Hospitals website homepage, www.nym.org. The survey also appeared on NYP/BMHs social media channels and in the spring/summer 2016 edition of NYP/BMHs community health magazine, Thrive, which is mailed to 250,000 households in Brooklyn. In addition to the input sought from the community, the programs and strategies developed by NYP/BMH as part of its Community Service Plan will be targeted to at-risk populations as identified in the Hospital Community Health Needs Assessment. The interventions and strategies were determined by reviewing results from NYP/BMHs Community Health Survey, along with the input derived from key informant meetings. State, county and zip code level statistical data were also reviewed. Finally, recommendations from the New York State Prevention Agenda Dashboard 2013-2017 were taken into consideration. The goal of the intervention for the Prevent Chronic Disease; focus on diabetes is to increase access to high-quality chronic disease preventive care and management in clinical and community settings by offering diabetes self-management education (DSME) classes for community residents in both English and Spanish, and educating Hospital staff members to become trainers and lead additional DSMEs. NYP/BMH anticipates that those who attend classes will gain confidence and better control in the management of their diabetes. Once our own staff is trained to lead these Stanford-modeled classes, the Hospital will have the capability to offer additional classes and impact even more members of the community who are living with diabetes. The first intervention for the Prevent Chronic Disease; focus on childhood obesity priority, which also falls under the prevention area of Promoting Healthy Women Infants and Children, is to adopt policies and practices designed to implement standards that will support breastfeeding, quality nutrition, increased physical activity and reduced screen time in early child care settings and to increase staff training, community support and reinforcement of these regulations and policies. The Hospital has joined New York Citys Breastfeeding Hospital Collaborative (NYC BHC) Cohort 3. As is the case for hospitals in the current NYCBHC, Cohort 3 will include in-person learning sessions, monthly action period webinars, semi-monthly coaching calls (participation as needed), mock assessments and site visits, access to a repository of free tools and resources to support pursuit of a Baby Friendly designation, and more. A second intervention for the Prevent Chronic Disease, focus on childhood obesity priority is to create a program to help incorporate dance/exercise classes and nutrition education into the lives of pre-teens and their parents. Classes will be offered at the Brooklyn Childrens Museum in Crown Heights. NYP/BMH will use strategies derived from New York State Obesity Prevention Center for Excellence. The goal of the intervention for Promote a Healthy and Safe Environment; reducing fall risk among most vulnerable populations priority is to improve the design and maintenance of home environments to promote health and reduce related illness, by creating a Fall Prevention Program and disseminating Fall Prevention Kits, with tools to help seniors safeguard their homes. NYP/BMH will reference the CDCs Guide for EBPs to Prevent Falls. A second intervention is intended to reduce factors that increase the risk of falls, particularly among the elderly and young children by promoting community-based programs for fall prevention. NYP/BMH will reference the CDCs Guide for EBPs to Prevent Falls. The process measures used to track and evaluate the impact of the Prevent Chronic Disease; focus on diabetes priority include information retention quizzes, tracking attendance and attendee goal setting and monitoring achievements during and after each six-week Diabetes Self-Management Education session. The process measures used to track and evaluate the Prevent Chronic Disease; focus on childhood obesity priority include pre and post class surveys, weight and waist measurements recorded throughout the duration of classes, and attendance tracking. Results will be monitored during and after each dance/education series. The process measures used to track and evaluate the Promote a Healthy and Safe Environment; reducing fall risk among most vulnerable populations priority include polling senior citizens on regarding home safety measures in place and giving them kits to safeguard their homes. They will also be offered the opportunity to share stories on how theyve implemented the safety information that has been provided. To attempt a reduction in the number of admissions due to falls, the Hospital will administer surveys administered to treat and release patients who come to the Emergency Room for falls. Part VI, Line 3: Patient Education of eligibility for assistance Written materials, including the application, full Policy, and plain language summary (Summary), shall be available to patients in NYP/BMH's primary languages, upon request and without charge, from Admitting and Emergency Departments at NYP/BMH during the intake and registration process, at discharge and/or by mail. Additionally, those materials shall be available on NYP/BMH's website (www.nyp.org/brooklyn). Also, notification to patients regarding this Policy shall be made through conspicuous posting of language appropriate information in Emergency Rooms and Admitting Departments of NYP/BMH, and inclusion of information on bills and statements sent to patients explaining that financial aid may be available to qualified patients and how to obtain further information. Part VI, Line 4: Community Information Although NYP/BMH is located in Park Slope and is an important healthcare, community service and economic anchor in the Park Slope neighborhood, it serves the entire borough of Brooklyn (Kings County). Brooklyn is the largest of the five boroughs that make up New York City. Indeed, if it were a separate city, Brooklyn would be the fourth largest in the United States. In 2014, Brooklyn had a total population of over 2.6 million people from a wide variety of ethnic and socioeconomic backgrounds. Of the total number of people in Brooklyn in 2014, 926,640 were white, 826,500 were black, 332,160 were Asian, Native American and Pacific Islanders and 526,110 were Latino. (Those reporting as Latino or Hispanic are of Spanish origin but may be of any race.) While the white and black populations have remained relatively stable, increasing only slightly as the Brooklyn population increased, the Latino population has increased by 13 percent (consistent with Brooklyns overall population increase) and the Asian, Native American and Pacific Island population has increased by 184 percent, far exceeding the overall Brooklyn increase. The demography of Brooklyn has changed radically since 1990, which is reflected in the ethnic breakdown of Hospital discharges over the past 25 years. At the turn of the 21st century, we were in a period of the largest influx of immigration to New York City since the early 1900s. According to the 2010 US census data, 37 percent of Brooklyns residents were born outside of the United States and 46 percent of the boroughs residents speak a language other than English in the home. What has made this wave of immigration to New York City especially unique is that the patterns of immigration are extremely diverse; of the various countries represented by Brooklyn residents, except for China (13 percent), no single one accounts for more than 10 percent of all first generation immigrants. New Yorks largest Afro-Caribbean community can be found in the Central Brooklyn neighborhoods of Crown Heights and Flatbush. Southwest Brooklyn (Bensonhurst and Bay Ridge), where Pakistani, Bangladeshi and Southeast Asian immigrants have merged with Russian and Chinese populations, houses the most diverse immigrant community. The number of Brooklyn men and women is fairly equal, at 47 percent and 53 percent respectively. Nearly 30 percent of Brookynites have earned a bachelors degree or higher and 78 percent hold a high school diploma. Twenty-two percent of the Brooklyn population lives below the poverty line. It is well known that the population, in general, is aging an"

FOR 2017, FOR ANSHN, THE ALLOWANCE FOR DOUBTFUL ACCOUNTS COVERED 26.51% OF NET PATIENT ACCOUNTS RECEIVABLE. PATIENT ACCOUNTS RECEIVABLE ARE STATED AT NET REALIZABLE VALUE. ANSHN EVALUATES THE COLLECTABILITY OF ITS ACCOUNTS RECEIVABLE BASED ON THE LENGTH OF TIME THE RECEIVABLE IS OUTSTANDING, PAYER CLASS, HISTORICAL COLLECTION EXPERIENCE, AND TRENDS IN HEALTH CARE INSURANCE PROGRAMS. ACCOUNTS RECEIVABLE ARE CHARGED TO THE ALLOWANCE FOR UNCOLLECTIBLE ACCOUNTS WHEN THEY ARE DEEMED UNCOLLECTIBLE. THE COSTING METHODOLOGY USED IN DETERMINING THE AMOUNTS REPORTED ON LINES 2 AND 3 IS BASED ON THE RATIO OF PATIENT CARE COST TO CHARGES. THE UNREIMBURSED COST OF BAD DEBT WAS CALCULATED BY APPLYING THE ORGANIZATION'S COST TO CHARGE RATIO FROM THE MEDICARE COST REPORTS (CMS 2252-96 WORKSHEET C, PART 1, PPS INPATIENT RATIOS) TO THE ORGANIZATION'S BAD DEBT PROVISION PER GENERALLY ACCEPTED ACCOUNTING PRINCIPLES, LESS ANY PATIENT OR THIRD PARTY PAYOR PAYMENTS RECEIVED. ADVOCATE MAKES EVERY EFFORT TO IDENTIFY THOSE PATIENTS WHO ARE ELIGIBLE FOR FINANCIAL ASSISTANCE BY STRICTLY ADHERING TO ITS FINANCIAL ASSISTANCE POLICY. WE BELIEVE THAT ADVOCATE HAS A POPULATION OF PATIENTS WHO ARE UNINSURED OR UNDERINSURED BUT WHO DO NOT COMPLETE THE FINANCIAL ASSISTANCE APPLICATION. THE ESTIMATED AMOUNT OF BAD DEBT EXPENSE (AT COST) WHICH COULD BE REASONABLY ATTRIBUTABLE TO PATIENTS WHO WOULD LIKELY QUALIFY FOR FINANCIAL ASSISTANCE UNDER THE ORGANIZATION'S FINANCIAL ASSISTANCE POLICY, IF SUFFICIENT INFORMATION HAD BEEN AVAILABLE TO MAKE A DETERMINATION OF THEIR ELIGIBILITY, WAS BASED UPON SELF PAY PATIENT ACCOUNTS WHICH HAD AMOUNTS WRITTEN OFF TO BAD DEBTS. OUR METHOD WAS TO BEGIN WITH THE SELF-PAY PORTION OF BAD DEBT EXPENSE PROVISION. THE SELF PAY PORTION EXCLUDES THOSE PATIENTS WHO HAD FINANCIAL ASSISTANCE APPLICATIONS PENDING AT THE TIME OF SERVICE. THIS COST WAS THEN REDUCED BY CHARGES IDENTIFIED AS TRUE BAD DEBT EXPENSE, INCLUDING COPAYS FOR PATIENTS WHO QUALIFIED FOR LESS THAN 100% FINANCIAL ASSISTANCE. THE COST TO CHARGE RATIO WAS THEN APPLIED TO THE REMAINING CHARGES, TO DETERMINE THE VALUE (AT COST) OF PATIENT ACCOUNTS THAT DID NOT COMPLETE FINANCIAL COUNSELING AND WERE ASSIGNED TO BAD DEBT. WE BELIEVE THIS PROCESS IS A REASONABLE BASIS FOR OUR ESTIMATE. AS WE ARE ONLY CONSIDERING SELF-PAY ACCOUNTS WRITTEN OFF TO BAD DEBT FOR THIS ESTIMATE, THIS ESTIMATE DOES NOT INCLUDE THE IMMEDIATE 25% DISCOUNT TO CHARGES WHICH IS APPLIED TO ALL SELF-PAY PATIENTS. IT ALSO DOES NOT INCLUDE ACCOUNT BALANCES OR CO-PAYS OF NON-SELF PAY ACCOUNTS WHICH ARE WRITTEN OFF TO BAD DEBT WHEN THE PATIENT HAS NO OTHER FINANCIAL RESOURCES TO PAY THESE AMOUNTS AND THE PATIENT DOES NOT APPLY FOR FINANCIAL ASSISTANCE. BAD DEBT AMOUNTS HAVE BEEN EXCLUDED FROM OTHER COMMUNITY BENEFIT AMOUNTS REPORTED THROUGHOUT SCHEDULE H. PART VI, LINE 1 - DESCRIPTION FOR PART III, LINE 8 IN 2017, NO SHORTFALL WAS REPORTED ON PART III, LINE 7. FOR ADVOCATE NORTHSIDE'S OPERATIONS, THE UNREIMBURSED COST OF MEDICARE WAS CALCULATED BY APPLYING THE ORGANIZATION'S COST TO CHARGE RATIO FROM THE MEDICARE COST REPORTS (CMS 2252-96 WORKSHEET C, PART 1, PPS INPATIENT RATIOS) AND FOR NON-HOSPITAL OPERATIONS THE COST TO CHARGE RATIO CALCULATED ON WORKSHEET 2 RATIO OF PATIENT CARE COST TO CHARGES TO THE ORGANIZATION'S MEDICARE, LESS ANY PATIENT OR THIRD PARTY PAYOR PAYMENTS AND/OR CONTRIBUTIONS RECEIVED THAT WERE DESIGNATED FOR THE PAYMENT OF MEDICARE PATIENT BILLS. PART VI, LINE 1 - DESCRIPTION FOR PART III, LINE 9B ANSHN MAINTAINS BOTH WRITTEN FINANCIAL ASSISTANCE AND BAD DEBT/COLLECTION POLICIES.

201833189349304138,363196629,"PART VI, 6. AFFILIATED HEALTH CARE SYSTEM","IN SERVICE OF ITS MISSION, ADVOCATE HEALTH CARE SUPPORTS SYSTEM-WIDE PROGRAMS THAT ADDRESS THE HEALTH NEEDS OF PATIENTS, FAMILIES AND THE COMMUNITIES SERVED. ADVOCATE HEALTH CARE'S BOARD OF DIRECTORS, SENIOR LEADERSHIP AND ASSOCIATES (EMPLOYEES) ARE COMMITTED TO POSITIVELY AFFECTING THE HEALTH STATUS AND QUALITY OF LIFE OF INDIVIDUALS AND POPULATIONS IN COMMUNITIES SERVED BY ADVOCATE THROUGH PROGRAMS AND PRACTICES THAT REFLECT ADVOCATE'S WHOLISTIC PHILOSOPHY. TO THAT END, THEY CONTINUE TO DEVELOP AND SUPPORT INITIATIVES THAT ENHANCE ACCESS TO HEALTH AND WELLNESS SERVICES WITHIN THE DIVERSE COMMUNITIES THAT ADVOCATE SERVES. SYSTEM LEADERSHIP DIRECTS AND SUPPORTS THE HOSPITALS IN THEIR EFFORTS TO ADDRESS IDENTIFIED COMMUNITY HEALTH NEEDS. ADVOCATE HEALTH CARE CREATED A COMMUNITY HEALTH DEPARTMENT IN 2016, LED BY A SYSTEM EXECUTIVE AND STAFFED WITH PUBLIC/COMMUNITY HEALTH SPECIALISTS TO EXECUTE COMMUNITY NEEDS ASSESSMENTS, EVIDENCE BASED PROGRAM DEVELOPMENT AND COLLABORATIVE PARTNERSHIPS WITHIN THE COMMUNITIES SERVED BY ADVOCATE. PRIOR TO THIS TIME, THE COMMUNITY FACING FUNCTION WAS LED BY A TEAM OF SYSTEM-LEVEL INDIVIDUALS WHOSE JOB RESPONSIBILITIES INCLUDED VARIOUS COMMUNITY ROLES MORE CLOSELY ALIGNED WITH COMMUNITY RELATIONS. DURING THE INITIAL 2011-2013 COMMUNITY HEALTH NEEDS ASSESSMENT (CHNA) CYCLE, THE SYSTEM LEADERS PROVIDED OVERSIGHT AND SUPPORT TO THE HOSPITALS FOR DEVELOPING THEIR CHNAS AND SUBSEQUENT PROGRAMMING. IN 2016, ADVOCATE'S NEW COMMUNITY HEALTH TEAM CONDUCTED COMPREHENSIVE CHNAS (2014-2016) AND POSTED GOVERNANCE-APPROVED CHNA REPORTS AND CHNA IMPLEMENTATION PLANS ON ADVOCATE'S WEBPAGE IN COMPLIANCE WITH THE AFFORDABLE CARE ACT. AT THE DIRECTION OF THE SYSTEM LEVEL, COMMUNITY HEALTH DEPARTMENT LEADERSHIP ALSO MET MONTHLY IN LATE 2016 THROUGH FIRST QUARTER 2017 TO SIGNIFICANTLY REVISE ADVOCATE HEALTH CARE'S COMMUNITY BENEFITS PLAN. THE PLANS GOALS AND OBJECTIVES WERE CRAFTED AND EXPANDED TO BUILD ON RECENT LEARNINGS AND INCREASED FOCUS ON COMMUNITY HEALTH. THE PLAN'S BROAD GOALS AND OBJECTIVES WERE DESIGNED TO STRUCTURE SYSTEM-WIDE COMMUNITY BENEFITS ACTIVITIES WITHIN A STRATEGIC FRAMEWORK. INCLUDED IN THE COMMUNITY BENEFITS PLAN ARE GOALS FOCUSED ON SYSTEM-WIDE EFFORTS TO ADDRESS THE BROADER ISSUES OF DISPARITY AND ACCESS, AND TO ALIGN HOSPITAL COMMUNITY HEALTH PLANS WITH SYSTEM STRATEGY AS COMMUNITY HEALTH PLANS AND IMPLEMENTATION STRATEGIES EVOLVE. ADVOCATE'S COMMUNITY BENEFITS PLAN ALSO SETS THE COURSE FOR STRENGTHENING EXISTING PARTNERSHIPS AND BUILDING NEW ONES TO LEVERAGE AND MAXIMIZE THE IMPACT OF ADVOCATE'S PROGRAMS IN ITS SERVICE AREAS. ADVOCATE'S COMMUNITY BENEFITS PLAN GOALS AND SPECIFIC EXAMPLES OF PROGRAMS AND SERVICES THAT ARE DIRECTED AND MANAGED AT THE SYSTEM LEVEL ARE PROVIDED BELOW. GOAL A: OPTIMIZE ADVOCATE'S CAPACITY TO MANAGE AN EFFECTIVE COMMUNITY HEALTH STRATEGY BY IMPLEMENTING REGULAR COMMUNITY HEALTH ASSESSMENTS (CHNAS) AND USING DATA FROM THESE ASSESSMENTS TO GUIDE PROGRAM DEVELOPMENT. DURING 2016, ALL ELEVEN ADVOCATE HEALTH CARE HOSPITALS COMPLETED COMPREHENSIVE COMMUNITY HEALTH NEEDS ASSESSMENTS IN COLLABORATION WITH HEALTH DEPARTMENTS, OTHER HOSPITALS, AND COMMUNITY ORGANIZATIONS. ADVOCATE CHILDREN'S HOSPITAL, WITH INTEGRATED SITES AT BOTH ADVOCATE LUTHERAN GENERAL HOSPITAL AND ADVOCATE CHRIST MEDICAL CENTER, CONTRIBUTED TO ASSESSMENTS AT THOSE TWO HOSPITALS. ALL THE ADVOCATE HOSPITAL ASSESSMENTS ARE AVAILABLE THROUGH THE ADVOCATE HEALTH CARE WEBSITE AT: HTTP://WWW.ADVOCATEHEALTH.COM/CHNAREPORTS AS A FIRST STEP TOWARD DEVELOPING A 2017-2019 IMPLEMENTATION PLAN, THE SYSTEM DIRECTED THE HOSPITAL COMMUNITY HEALTH LEADERS AND STAFF TO IDENTIFY THE STRENGTHS AND OPPORTUNITIES FOR IMPROVEMENT WITHIN THE JUST COMPLETED CYCLE (2014-2016), AS WELL AS IDEAS FOR NEW DATA SOURCES, AND NEEDS FOR PROFESSIONAL DEVELOPMENT RELATED TO THE OVERALL CHNA PROCESS. A NUMBER OF STRENGTHS WERE IDENTIFIED INCLUDING DEVELOPMENT OF LOCAL COMMUNITY HEALTH COUNCILS (CHC), INVOLVEMENT OF HOSPITAL GOVERNING COUNCIL MEMBERS IN THE CHCS, PARTNERSHIPS WITH HEALTH DEPARTMENTS, DATA FROM THE HEALTHY COMMUNITIES INSTITUTE, ESPECIALLY THE ZIP CODE LEVEL HOSPITALIZATION AND EMERGENCY ROOM UTILIZATION DATA, AND THE SHARING OF TEMPLATES AND APPROACHES ACROSS HOSPITAL SITES. ADDITIONAL PROFESSIONAL DEVELOPMENT REGARDING DATA RETRIEVAL, ANALYSIS, AND SUMMARIZATION AS WELL AS PROGRAM DEVELOPMENT WERE IDENTIFIED. A PROFESSIONAL DEVELOPMENT PLAN WAS IMPLEMENTED FOR ALL INTERNAL COMMUNITY HEALTH STAFF IN 2017. CHNA DATA TRAINING WAS CONDUCTED USING THE HEALTHY COMMUNITIES INSTITUTE (HCI) PLATFORM WITH THE TEAM RECEIVING TRAINING REGARDING RUNNING VARIOUS TYPES OF REPORTS AND CROSS COMPARING DATA IN HCI. UPDATE PRESENTATIONS WERE HELD AT SELECTED MONTHLY STAFF MEETINGS REGARDING NEW CAPACITIES OF THE HCI PLATFORM FOR REPORTS AND DATA PRESENTATION. ADDITIONALLY, ALL STAFF PROVIDED INPUT REGARDING TRAINING NEEDS RESULTING IN THE ESTABLISHMENT OF A SET OF MINIMUM STANDARD DATA REQUIREMENTS ADVOCATE WILL BE USING FOR THE NEXT CHNA CYCLE. COMMUNITY HEALTH STAFF PULLED DATA AS PART OF LEARNING EXERCISES AND SHARED FINDINGS FROM THEIR UNIQUE SERVICE AREAS WITH PEERS IN A PEER REVIEW MODEL. IN 2018, THE TRAINING FOCUS WILL BE ON DATA ANALYSIS, DATA INTERPRETATION AND PROGRAM DEVELOPMENT AND EVALUATION. GOAL B: UNDERTAKE OR SUPPORT INITIATIVES THAT ENHANCE ACCESS TO HEALTH CARE, PREVENTION AND WELLNESS SERVICES ACROSS THE LIFESPAN AND WITHIN THE DIVERSE COMMUNITIES ADVOCATE SERVES. CHARITY CARE AS A NON-PROFIT HEALTH CARE SYSTEM, ADVOCATE PROVIDES CHARITY AND FINANCIAL ASSISTANCE TO PATIENTS IN NEED. ALTHOUGH ADVOCATE'S SYSTEM-WIDE CHARITY CARE POLICY IS VERY GENEROUS, ADVOCATE CONTINUES TO REVIEW AND REFINE ITS POLICY IN AN ONGOING EFFORT TO ENSURE THAT FINANCIAL ASSISTANCE IS AVAILABLE TO THOSE IN NEED IN A TIMELY MANNER. WHILE EACH HOSPITAL HAS A CHARITY CARE COUNCIL TO REVIEW APPLICATIONS AND DETERMINE ELIGIBILITY, SYSTEM FINANCE LEADERS ARE RESPONSIBLE FOR ONGOING POLICY REVIEW AND REFINEMENTS TO ASSURE THAT ADVOCATE CONTINUES TO PROVIDE FINANCIAL ASSISTANCE TO INDIVIDUALS WHO NEED HELP, WHEN THEY NEED IT. FEDERALLY QUALIFIED HEALTH CENTERS IN ADDITION, ADVOCATE'S SYSTEM LEADERS ENCOURAGE AND SUPPORT ITS HOSPITALS' INITIATIVES TO PARTNER WITH FEDERALLY QUALIFIED HEALTH CENTERS (FQHC), PUBLIC HEALTH DEPARTMENTS AND COMMUNITY CLINICS IN ORDER TO ASSIST THE UNINSURED IN FINDING INSURANCE COVERAGE AND MEDICAL SERVICES. FOR EXAMPLE, ADVOCATE SOUTH SUBURBAN HOSPITAL HAS A PARTNERSHIP WITH AUNT MARTHA'S YOUTH SERVICE CENTER, AN FQHC, TO IMPROVE ACCESS TO PRIMARY CARE SERVICES FOR UNINSURED AND UNDERINSURED INDIVIDUALS IN ITS SERVICE AREA. ADVOCATE BROMENN MEDICAL CENTER MAINTAINS A COMMUNITY HEALTH CLINIC IN COLLABORATION WITH OSF ST. JOSEPH'S HOSPITAL, WHEREBY ADVOCATE BROMENN MEDICAL CENTER IS RESPONSIBLE FOR A PORTION OF THE HOSPITAL CARE FOR THE CLINIC PATIENTS' HOSPITAL CARE THROUGHOUT THE YEAR. BROMENN IS ALSO THE SOLE PROVIDER OF THE CLINIC'S INFORMATION TECHNOLOGY (IT) SUPPORT AND PROVIDES THE SPACE OCCUPIED BY THE CLINIC. IN ADDITION, BROMENN MEDICAL CENTER, THROUGH AN INFORMAL REFERRAL AGREEMENT IN PLACE SINCE 2010, COLLABORATES WITH CHESTNUT HEALTH SYSTEMS. CHESTNUT HEALTH SYSTEMS OWNS AND OPERATES AN FQHC IN BLOOMINGTON AND PATIENTS ARE SOMETIMES REFERRED TO BROMENN MEDICAL CENTER FOR SERVICES. WORKING WITH OTHER AREA HOSPITALS, ADVOCATE GOOD SAMARITAN HOSPITAL PROVIDES SUPPORT THROUGH THE DUPAGE HEALTH COALITION TO SUSTAIN THE ACCESS DUPAGE COMMUNITY PROGRAM - A COMMUNITY COLLABORATION DESIGNED TO PROVIDE LOW-COST PRIMARY MEDICAL CARE SERVICES TO THE LOW-INCOME, MEDICALLY UNINSURED RESIDENTS OF DUPAGE COUNTY. IN ADDITION, THE HOSPITAL PARTNERS WITH THE DUPAGE COUNTY HEALTH DEPARTMENT'S ENGAGE DUPAGE INITIATIVE FOR INDIGENT PATIENT FINANCIAL ELIGIBILITY IN THE EMERGENCY ROOM AND TO ASSIST WITH OUTPLACEMENT SERVICES FOR THOSE PATIENTS WHO COULD BENEFIT FROM TREATMENT PROGRAMS, PLACEMENT WITH A PRIMARY CARE PROVIDER (PCP), DENTAL CARE, ETC. ADVOCATE HEALTH CARE ALSO WORKS TO IMPROVE THE PROVISION OF SERVICES TO INDIVIDUALS AND FAMILIES WHO ARE COVERED BY MEDICARE AND MEDICAID AND SEEK SERVICES FROM ADVOCATE'S OVER 400 SITES OF CARE. ADVOCATE COLLABORATES WITH VARIOUS COMMUNITY-BASED ORGANIZATIONS (CBO'S) AND FQHC'S IN INNOVATIVE WAYS TO ESTABLISH PRIMARY CARE RELATIONSHIPS FOR MEDICAID AND UNINSURED PATIENTS. ADVOCATE ACCOUNTABLE CARE ENTITY (ACE) AS ONE OF THE LARGEST PROVIDERS OF HEALTH CARE SERVICES TO MEDICARE AND MEDICAID PATIENTS IN CHICAGO AND THE SURROUNDING SUBURBS, ADVOCATE HEALTH CARE'S MEDICAID ACCOUNTABLE CARE ORGANIZATION (ACO), ALSO KNOWN AS THE ADVOCATE ACCOUNTABLE CARE ENTITY, TRANSITIONED TO MERIDIAN FAMILY HEALTH PLAN (FHP) OF ILLINOIS AS PART OF AN INTEGRATED CARE MODEL ON APRIL 1, 2016. THE ADVOCATE/MERIDIAN FHP PARTNERSHIP AND COLLABORATION WAS DRIVEN LARGELY BY CHANGES TO THE MEDICAID PROGRAM IN ILLINOIS AND WAS DESIGNED TO ENSURE CURRENT MEDICAID MEMBERS CONTINUE TO RECEIVE HIGH-QUALITY AND WELL-COORDINATED C"

RESEARCH HAS CONTINUALLY SHOWN THAT WHEN THE FACTORS INFLUENCING HEALTH ARE EXPLORED, HEALTH CARE ACTUALLY PLAYS THE SMALLEST ROLE PROPORTIONATELY. A REPORT IN THE JOURNAL OF AMERICAN MEDICAL ASSOCIATION AND THE CENTER FOR DISEASE CONTROL (MCGINNIS, 1996) SUGGESTS THAT THE FACTORS IMPACTING HEALTH ARE AS FOLLOWS: LIFESTYLE AND BEHAVIORS, 50%, ENVIRONMENT (HUMAN AND NATURAL), 20%, GENETICS AND HUMAN BIOLOGY, 20%, AND HEALTH CARE, 10%. COMMUNITY BUILDING ACTIVITIES HELP TO ADDRESS THE OTHER INDICATORS OUTSIDE OF THE ROLE TRADITIONALLY PLAYED BY HEALTH-CARE ORGANIZATIONS. THESE ACTIVITIES ARE ALMOST EXCLUSIVELY DONE IN SOME FORM OF PARTNERSHIP IN WHICH THE COMMUNITY OR OTHER ORGANIZATIONS ARE BETTER SUITED TO ADDRESS. HEALTH-CARE ORGANIZATIONS GENERALLY PROVIDE TIMELY AND SPECIFIC RESOURCES TO HELP THESE ISSUES. HEALTH-CARE ORGANIZATIONS CAN BE A RICH AND VALUABLE COMMUNITY RESOURCE IN WAYS NOT TYPICALLY CONSIDERED. OFTEN THE MOST EFFECTIVE WAY TO HELP IMPACT AND IMPROVE THE COMMUNITY HEALTH STATUS IS TO SUPPORT OTHER AGENCIES AND ORGANIZATIONS IN A VARIETY OF WAYS OUTSIDE OF HEALTH SERVICES. THIS IS OFTEN DONE THROUGH CASH OR IN-KIND SERVICES TO SUPPORT OTHER NON-PROFITS, DONATIONS OF DURABLE MEDICAL EQUIPMENT AND SUPPLIES TO CERTAIN AGENCIES, OR THROUGH LEADERSHIP AND EDUCATIONAL EXPERTISE. TRINITY MEDICAL CENTER CONTRIBUTES FINANCIALLY TO A WIDE VARIETY OF COMMUNITY ORGANIZATIONS THAT ADDRESS THE BROADER NEEDS OF THE COMMUNITY. THESE DONATIONS ALLOW OTHER NON-PROFIT ORGANIZATIONS TO FULFILL THEIR MISSIONS TO IMPROVE THE WELL BEING OF THE COMMUNITY AND CONTRIBUTE TO ITS OVERALL HEALTH STATUS IN WAYS THAT MAY DIFFER FROM THE DIRECT SERVICES OF THE HOSPITAL ORGANIZATION AND MAXIMIZE THE RESOURCES THEY HAVE TO WORK WITH. TRINITY MEDICAL CENTER EMPLOYEES ARE ACTIVE IN EDUCATING PARTNERS ON A WIDE VARIETY OF HEALTH SUBJECTS THAT ADVANCE THEIR WORK. FURTHER, TRINITY MEDICAL CENTER EMPLOYEES ARE MEMBERS OF MANY NON-PROFIT BOARDS TO PROVIDE LEADERSHIP OR COLLABORATE TO ADDRESS COMPLEX HEALTH ISSUES. THESE TYPES OF ACTIVITIES SPEAK TO THE BREADTH AND CAPACITY THAT THE HOSPITAL HAS IN IMPACTING THE HEALTH STATUS OF THE COMMUNITY IN A COMPREHENSIVE AND INTENTIONAL APPROACH."

HOWEVER THE MEDICARE COST REPORT DISALLOWS CERTAIN ITEMS THAT WE BELIEVE ARE LEGITIMATE EXPENSES INCURRED IN THE PROCESS OF CARING FOR OUR MEDICARE PATIENTS. EXAMPLES OF THESE ITEMS INCLUDE PROVIDER BASED PHYSICIAN EXPENSE, SELF INSURANCE EXPENSE, HOME OFFICE EXPENSE AND THE SHORTFALL FROM FEE SCHEDULE PAYMENTS.THE HOSPITAL BELIEVES THE ENTIRE AMOUNT OF THE MEDICARE SHORTFALL SHOULD BE TREATED AS COMMUNITY BENEFIT, MORE SPECIFICALLY, AS CHARITY CARE. THE ELDERLY CONSTITUTE A CLEARLY-RECOGNIZED CHARITABLE CLASS, AND MANY MEDICARE BENEFICIARIES, LIKE THEIR MEDICAID COUNTERPARTS, ARE POOR AND THUS WOULD HAVE QUALIFIED FOR THE HOSPITAL'S CHARITY CARE PROGRAM, MEDICAID OR OTHER NEEDS-BASED GOVERNMENT PROGRAMS ABSENT THE MEDICARE PROGRAM. BY ACCEPTING PAYMENT BELOW COST TO TREAT THESE INDIVIDUALS, THE BURDENS OF GOVERNMENT ARE RELIEVED WITH RESPECT TO THESE INDIVIDUALS. ADDITIONALLY, THERE IS A SIGNIFICANT POSSIBILITY THAT CONTINUED REDUCTION IN REIMBURSEMENT MAY ACTUALLY CREATE DIFFICULTIES IN ACCESS FOR THESE INDIVIDUALS.

The patient will be notified in writing if the discount is less than 100 and will have an opportunity to submit a financial assistance application if the patient believes that he or she may qualify for more assistance. The review utilizes a healthcare industry- recognized predictive model that is based on public record data basis. The models rule based electronic technology is calibrated to the historical approvals for financial assistance under the general application process and is designed to statistically match the hospitals policy. The model considers multiple decision criteria designed to assess each patient to the same standards as defined in this policy. This ensures that Southwest grants assistance only to patients with characteristics similar to the patients who have qualified based on criteria defined in this policy.

Net patient accounts are reduced by an allowance for doubtful receivables based upon the hospital's historical collection experience adjusted for current environmental risks and trends for each major payor source. Significant provision is made for self-pay patient accounts in the period of service based on past collection experience. The hospital's concentration of credit risk related to net patient accounts is limited due to the diversity of patients and payors. Net patient accounts consist of amounts due from governmental programs (primarily Medicare and Medicaid), private insurance companies, managed care programs and patients themselves. Net patient service revenue for services provided to patients who have third-party payor coverage is recognized based on contractual rates for services rendered. The hospital recognizes a significant amount of patient service revenue at the time services are rendered even though it does not assess the patient's ability to pay. As a result, the provision for bad debts is presented as a deduction from patient service revenue (net of contractual provisions and discounts). Amounts recognized are subject to adjustment upon review by third-party payors. For uninsured patients that do not qualify for charity care, the hospital recognizes revenue when services are provided. Based on historical experience, a significant portion of the hospital's uninsured patients will be unable or unwilling to pay for services provided. Thus, the hospital records a significant provision for bad debts related to uninsured patients in the period the services are provided. Any discounts applied to self-pay patients would be deemed either Charity or a contractual adjustment. Bad debt would be based on the balance after the charity or contractual adjustment that is deemed uncollectable following a reasonable collection effort."

It is commonly known as the Roanoke Valley and is comprised of the independent cities of Roanoke and Salem and the counties of Botetourt, Craig, Franklin, and Roanoke. It is nestled among the Blue Ridge Mountains with the City of Roanoke at its heart. The City is a destination venue, rich in cultural diversity, the arts, shopping, recreational opportunities, natural beauty and services not available in more rural areas of the region. Key safety net providers in the region in addition to Carilion Clinic include: New Horizons, a federally qualified health center; free clinics; local offices of the Virginia Department of Health; and other human service organizations. Despite the presence of these entities, there remain thousands of low-income, uninsured, and underinsured residents who do not have access to affordable health care services.The 2018 RVCHNA revealed distinct communities with significant differences in size and population and significant disparities both in health and in social determinants. The 2012-2016 American Community Survey (ACS) found the total population of the Roanoke MSA to be 312,891. The cities of Roanoke and Salem had 99,329 residents and 25,290 people respectively. The counties of Botetourt, Craig, Franklin and Roanoke had 33,129, 5,195, 56,230 and 93,655 residents respectively. For all communities, the ACS predicts positive future population change, but to varying degrees. Median age in the MSA localities ranges from 38.1 in the City of Roanoke to 47 in Craig County, all above the state median of 37.8 . The ACS finds that for most of the Roanoke MSA, a larger percentage of the population is White than in the Commonwealth of Virginia as a whole, with percentages ranging all the way up to 98.1% in Craig County .Roanoke Valley's urban hub, the City of Roanoke, is more racially and ethnically diverse than the rest of the MSA, with a population that is 63.85% White, 28.3% Black, and 2.7% Asian with 3.5% representing more than one race and the remainder representing small minorities of American Indian/Alaskan Native, Native Hawaiian/Pacific Islander or some other race. Of the population, 6% are Hispanic or Latino. The City is divided into quadrants (Northwest, Northeast, Southwest and Southeast) separated geographically by railroad tracks, the Roanoke River, and the Interstate 581. These quadrants vary greatly in the demographic and economic make-up of the residents. Specifically, two of the quadrants the Northwest and Southeast quadrants have federal designations as Medically Underserved Areas (MUAs) and are home to a large proportion of the low-income individuals and families in the city who may be uninsured, underinsured and/or Medicaid recipients who often face additional barriers due to cultural differences."

With an enduring commitment to the health of the region, Carilion also seeks to advance care through medical education and research, help its community stay healthy and inspire the region to grow stronger. In the mid-2000s, Carilion made the strategic decision to transform from a collection of hospitals to a physician-led, integrated health care system. It was a courageous move. In every moment since, Carilion has worked to evolve by further-developing a multi-specialty physician group, transforming our primary care practices into patient-centered medical homes, implementing electronic health records system-wide, creating a robust partnership with Virginia Tech, and opening a medical school and research institute. Each decision, each adaptation, has fundamentally changed the way Carilion collaborates and cares. To advance education of health professionals, Jefferson College of Health Sciences is a private higher education institution that ""prepares, within a scholarly environment, ethical, knowledgeable, competent and caring healthcare professionals."" The College focuses on providing healthcare education and is a part of Carilion Clinic.

In addition to the hospital organization, there are the following affiliates that help to meet the needs of the community: NorthShore University HealthSystem Foundation - The NorthShore University HealthSystem Foundation (Foundation) seeks to obtain the philanthropic support required to ensure that NorthShore can provide medical care, advanced research, and state-of-the-art facilities and equipment. The Foundation builds relationships with individuals and the community to increase awareness of NorthShore's high-quality services and giving opportunities. NorthShore University HealthSystem Research Institute - The NorthShore University HealthSystem Research Institute (Research Institute) was organized in 1996 to provide a means for integrating leading-edge research into improved clinical care. The Research Institute also creates an environment to recruit and retain externally-funded research leadership in order to achieve the mission and goals of the organization. The Research Institute now houses nearly 89 externally funded research faculty who currently occupy 95,000 net square feet of research space and work on 984 active research protocols. Total external funding is now approximately $88 million. NorthShore continues the Genomic Health Initiative for members of the community to help shape the future of Personalized Medicine. This research project will give physician and research experts the opportunity to more proactively learn about the science behind diseases and conditions, and apply this knowledge directly to a clinical setting to improve patient outcomes. The Genomic Health Initiative will allow researchers to more precisely predict, prevent, and treat disease while improving the future of healthcare and the medical field for generations to come. The goal is to collect 40,000-100,000 participants over the next several years to enable sufficient samples for DNA studies. The Research Institute is also a member of the Illinois Precision Medicine Consortium (IPMC), which is part of a national landmark longitudinal All of Us Research Program (AoURP) cohort program to improve the ability to prevent and treat disease based on individual lifestyle, environment, and genetics. NorthShore will enroll over 5,000 NorthShore patients in the study, and participants in NorthShore's AoURP will be asked to share a wide-range of health, environmental, and lifestyle information. The NorthShore Program for Personalized Cancer Care (PPCC) is pioneering new strategies in cancer care. The PPCC uniquely focuses on the genetic pattern of an individual's hereditary DNA to derive a personalized cancer risk assessment profile. Based on the inherited risk of developing a given cancer, the PPCC is beginning to implement personalized cancer care strategies that encompass the entire spectrum of disease. The PPCC believes this approach will lead to more efficient use of health care resources by targeting prevention and screenings toward individuals at greater risk of developing cancer, earlier cancer detection, and, ultimately and most importantly, reduced cancer deaths and suffering. NorthShore University Health System Home and Hospice Services - NorthShore University HealthSystem Home and Hospice Services (Home and Hospice) offers the full spectrum of home and hospice care, including skilled nursing, physical and occupational therapy, and home medical equipment.

THE PURPOSE OF THE PLAN IS TO PROVIDE DIRECTION AND CONTEXT FOR HOSPITAL DECISION MAKING AND RESOURCE ALLOCATION CONSISTENT WITH LOCAL HEALTH CARE NEEDS AND MARKET OPPORTUNITIES. TO ACCOMPLISH THIS TASK, THE COMMITTEE CREATED A COMPREHENSIVE, PARTICIPATORY PROCESS TO SOLICIT INPUT FROM ALL LEVELS OF THE ORGANIZATION AND THE COMMUNITY. A MULTI-STEP PLANNING PROCESS WAS INITIATED.STEP 1 INVOLVED THE REVIEW AND REVISION OF THE HOSPITAL'S MISSION AND VISION STATEMENTS. BOTH STATEMENTS WERE MODIFIED FROM WHAT HAD PREVIOUSLY EXISTED. A CONCISE, VALUE DRIVEN MISSION STATEMENT WAS DEVELOPED IN RESPONSE TO THE NEED FOR MISSION STATEMENTS TO DESCRIBE ""WHO WE ARE."" ADDITIONALLY, SEVERAL CORE VALUES WERE DELINEATED IN SUPPORT OF THE MISSION STATEMENT. THE VISION STATEMENT WAS DEVELOPED IN RESPONSE TO THE QUESTION OF ""WHAT DO WE WISH TO BECOME"" WITH THE UNDERSTANDING THAT VISION STATEMENTS SHOULD BE REALISTIC, CREDIBLE, AND POSSESS THE ABILITY TO INSPIRE AND MOTIVATE.STEP 2 IDENTIFIED A SERIES OF CRITICAL ISSUES FACING THE HOSPITAL THAT WILL PROVIDE THE CONTEXT FOR THE HOSPITAL'S NEAR TERM OPERATINGENVIRONMENT WITH RESPECT TO CARE DELIVERY, REGULATION, COMPETITION, FINANCE AND KEY PUBLICS.STEP 3 INVOLVED THE DEVELOPMENT OF A COMPREHENSIVE ENVIRONMENTAL ANALYSIS,INCLUDING AN INTERNAL AND EXTERNAL ASSESSMENT OF THE HOSPITAL. THEINTERNAL ASSESSMENT WAS PROVIDED VIA MULTIPLE FOCUS GROUPS - OPENDISCUSSIONS ABOUT THE HOSPITAL'S STRENGTHS, WEAKNESSES, OPPORTUNITIES AND THREATS. THESE FOCUS GROUPS, FACILITATED BY AN OUTSIDE CONSULTANT RETAINED BY THE HOSPITAL, PROVIDED INPUT FROM PHYSICIANS, EMPLOYEES, VOLUNTEERS AND THE COMMUNITY AND PROVIDED SIGNIFICANT INSIGHT INTO STRENGTHS, WEAKNESSES, AND OPPORTUNITIES FOR IMPROVEMENT. THE EXTERNAL ASSESSMENT WAS DEVELOPED FROM THE COMPILATION OF UTILIZATION, MARKET SHARE DEMOGRAPHIC AND FINANCIAL DATA AND PHYSICIAN WORKFORCE INFORMATION SPECIFIC TO THE HOSPITAL'S SERVICE AREA.STEPS 4, 5 AND 6 IDENTIFIED GOALS, STRATEGIES, AND OBJECTIVES THAT WILLSERVE AS THE HOSPITAL'S PRIORITIES THROUGH 2019. THE PLAN WASREVIEWED IN JUNE 2016 AND INITIATIVES ADDED THAT WERE CARRIED OUT IN 2016 AND 2017. GOALS RESPOND TO THE QUESTION ""WHAT ARE THE KEY PRIORITIES?"" A SERIES OF STRATEGIES WERE DEVELOPED WHICH RESPOND TO THE QUESTION ""HOW DO WE ACHIEVE OUR PRIORITIES?"" FINALLY, A NUMBER OF SPECIFIC OBJECTIVES WERE DEVELOPED WHICH RESPOND TO THE QUESTION ""WHAT WILL BE ACCOMPLISHED ANNUALLY?"" OBJECTIVES WERE GENERATED BY SENIOR MANAGEMENT AND FORM THE BASIS FOR NEAR TERM ADMINISTRATIVE WORKPLANS.ESSENTIAL TO THE SUCCESS OF ANY STRATEGIC PLAN IS THE HOSPITAL'S ABILITY TO BOTH IMPLEMENT RECOMMENDATIONS MADE WITHIN THE PLAN AND TO RECOGNIZE THE DOCUMENT AS A DYNAMIC AND FLEXIBLE TOOL TO BE USED AS A GUIDE FOR THE FUTURE. SPECIFIC GOALS AND STRATEGIES MAY OR MAY NOT BE OBTAINED AND, UPON EVALUATION AND THE AVAILABILITY OF NEW INFORMATION AND DEVELOPMENTS, MAY NEED TO BE MODIFIED. A SUCCESSFUL STRATEGIC PLAN RECOGNIZES THIS POTENTIAL FOR CHANGE AND IS FLEXIBLE ENOUGH TO ACCOMMODATE NEW OR DIFFERENT OPPORTUNITIES AND CHALLENGES.CRITICAL HEALTH CARE ISSUESTHE ENACTED HEALTHCARE REFORM LEGISLATION UNDERSCORES MANY OF THESIGNIFICANT ISSUES CURRENTLY FACING HOSPITALS. FOLLOWING IS LISTING OFCRITICAL ISSUES THAT WILL IMPACT HOSPITALS OVER THE NEXT SEVERAL YEARS.1. QUALITY: HEALTH CARE QUALITY AND SAFETY ARE NOW STRATEGICALLY IMPORTANT, NOT JUST PROFESSIONALLY IMPORTANT. THE ADVENT OF WIDESPREADPUBLIC REPORTING OF HOSPITAL QUALITY RESULTS ASSURES THAT A HOSPITAL'SQUALITY PERFORMANCE IS NO LONGER ONLY VISIBLE TO THE DIRECTOR OF QUALITY,QA COMMITTEE MEMBERS AND VARIOUS REGULATORS. THE NET EFFECT OF THISTRANSPARENCY TREND OVER THE NEXT 5 YEARS WILL BE THAT THE DEFINITION OF A""GOOD HOSPITAL"" WILL SHIFT SIGNIFICANTLY. NO LONGER WILL IT BE ENOUGH TOHAVE ATTRACTIVE FACILITIES, GOOD TECHNOLOGIES AND SKILLED DOCTORS ANDNURSES. HOSPITALS WILL NEED TO MARSHAL THOSE RESOURCES INTO A QUALITY ANDSAFETY SYSTEM CAPABLE OF RELIABLY PRODUCING MEASURED QUALITY RESULTS.PROVIDER PAYMENTS WILL INCREASINGLY BE A FUNCTION OF QUALITY OUTCOMES ANDQUALITY BONUSES WILL BE DRAWN FROM ANNUAL PAYMENT UPDATES. INFORMATIONSYSTEMS CAPABLE OF PROVIDING VALID AND RELIABLE QUALITY AND OUTCOMEINDICATORS WILL BE A NECESSITY AS WILL THE USE OF EVIDENCE BASEDGUIDELINES BY CLINICAL PROVIDERS. CONSUMERS WILL SEEK AND USE PERFORMANCEINFORMATION, INCLUDING PATIENT SATISFACTION INFORMATION, TO GUIDE THEIRCHOICE OF PROVIDERS.2. INFORMATION TECHNOLOGY: HEALTH INFORMATION TECHNOLOGY INCLUDES COMPUTER BASED TOOLS DEVELOPED SPECIFICALLY FOR HEALTH CARE DELIVERY. THESE TOOLS CAN PROVIDE CLINICIANS UP-TO-DATE INFORMATION ON THEIR PATIENTS, ACCESS TO THE LATEST MEDICAL KNOWLEDGE AND BEST PRACTICES THROUGH DECISION SUPPORT SYSTEMS. IT IS UNDERSTOOD THAT INVESTMENTS IN NEW CLINICAL AND INFORMATION TECHNOLOGY CAN SIGNIFICANTLY ENHANCE PATIENT SAFETY AND CLINICAL OUTCOMES. COMPUTERIZED PHYSICIAN ORDER ENTRY (CPOE), BAR CODING AND ITS POTENTIAL TO REDUCE MEDICATION ERRORS, AND ELECTRONIC MEDICAL RECORDS (EMRS) AND THEIR POSITIVE IMPACT ON MEDICAL ERRORS ARE ALL EXAMPLES OF HEALTH CARE'S USE OF IT SOLUTIONS TO IMPROVE QUALITY. THE FEDERAL GOVERNMENT HAS HIGHLIGHTED THE ROLE OF HEALTH INFORMATION TECHNOLOGY AS A MEANS TO IMPROVE HEALTH CARE QUALITY, SAFETY AND NOW IS PROVIDING STIMULUS AND INCENTIVE PAYMENTS TO PROVIDERS TO FACILITATE AND HASTEN THEIR ADOPTION INTO THE CARE DELIVERY PROCESS. EMR'S WILL BECOME A PREREQUISITE OF ANY DELIVERY SYSTEM THAT INTENDS TO PROVIDE COORDINATED COST EFFECTIVE CARE.3. PHYSICIANS: PHYSICIANS HAVE EMERGED AS CRITICAL OPERATIONAL ANDSTRATEGIC PARTNERS TO HOSPITALS. THOSE THAT ARE SUCCESSFUL IN ENGAGING ANDCOLLABORATING WITH THEIR MEDICAL STAFF WILL BE BEST ABLE TO DEMONSTRATEHIGH QUALITY CARE AND COMPLIANCE WITH HEALTH REFORM'S VALUE BASEDPURCHASING AND OTHER QUALITY MANDATES. ADDITIONALLY, GIVEN THE INCREASEIN DEMAND FOR HEALTHCARE SERVICES THAT WILL BE OCCASIONED BY REFORM, THEABILITY TO SUCCESSFULLY RECRUIT PHYSICIANS WILL BE CRITICAL. AT A TIMEWHEN HEALTHCARE REFORM INITIATIVES EMPHASIZE THE ROLE OF PRIMARY CARE,THERE IS A SPECIAL NEED TO INTENSIFY EFFORTS TO RECRUIT PRIMARY CAREPROVIDERS. BECAUSE THE VAST MAJORITY OF NEW PHYSICIANS PREFER EMPLOYMENTAS THEIR PRACTICE PREFERENCE, THE ABILITY OF HOSPITALS TO BE ABLE TO OFFERPHYSICIANS A CONTEMPORARY AND COMPETITIVE ""EMPLOYMENT PLATFORM"" ISESSENTIAL.4. FINANCE AND CAPITAL: FINANCIAL PERFORMANCE AND ACCESS TO CAPITAL WILL CONTINUE TO BE AMONG THE MOST CRITICAL ISSUES CONFRONTING HOSPITALS. EVEN WITH HEALTHCARE REFORM, HEALTHCARE COSTS WILL CONTINUE TO OUTPACE INFLATION. INCREASING WAGE AND SALARY COSTS, AND RISING HEALTH CARE COSTSIN GENERAL WILL CONTINUE TO IMPACT OPERATING PERFORMANCE AND PRESSHOSPITALS TO CONTINUE A RELENTLESS FOCUS ON COST MANAGEMENT. ADDITIONALLY,REVENUE STRATEGIES WILL NEED TO BE DEVELOPED TO GENERATE PROFITABLE GROWTHIN PATIENT VOLUME, AS WILL THE NEED TO ENSURE OPTIMAL MANAGEMENT OF ALLREVENUE CYCLE ACTIVITIES. HOSPITALS ARE FACING SIGNIFICANT PAYMENT REDUCTIONS IN TERMS OF DECREASES IN MEDICARE UPDATES, DISPROPORTIONATESHARE, SNF AND HOMECARE PAYMENTS. AS HOSPITALS CONTINUE TO POST LOW OR NOPROFIT MARGINS, INVESTMENT INCOME WILL BE MORE IMPORTANT THAN EVER.HOWEVER, GIVEN THE FACT THAT INVESTMENT INCOME IS A HIGHLY UNCERTAINCOMPONENT OF A HOSPITAL'S OVERALL FINANCIAL HEALTH, HOSPITALS WILL BEDRIVEN TO PURSUE MORE PHILANTHROPY. HOSPITAL CAPITAL SPENDING WILL BEDRIVEN BY GROWING DEMANDS FOR ADVANCED TECHNOLOGY NEEDED TO ENSURE PATIENTQUALITY AND SAFETY, THE NEED TO REPLACE AND UPDATE AGING FACILITIES, ANDTHE DESIRE AND NEED TO IMPROVE TECHNOLOGY BASED SERVICES.IN 2016 BRMC'S BOARD OF DIRECTORS VOTED TO BECOME PART OF THE KALEIDA HEALTH SYSTEM, A BUFFALO, NEW YORK-BASED HEALTH SYSTEM. THIS DECISION WAS BASED ON A FIVE YEAR LONG-TERM FINANCIAL PLAN THAT WAS DEVELOPED FOR BRMC AND ITS SISTER HOSPITAL UNDER BRMC'S PARENT COMPANY- UPPER ALLEGHENY HEALTH SYSTEM (UAHS), WHICH DEMONSTRATED A FUTURE INABILITY TO REMAIN FINANCIALLY VIABLE GIVEN THE DOWNWARD PRESSURES ON REVENUE IN THE HEALTH CARE INDUSTRY AS WELL AS RISING COSTS TO PROVIDE CARE. BRMC IS NOT UNIQUE IN THIS VULNERABLE POSITION. HOSPITALS ACROSS AMERICA, ESPECIALLY RURAL HOSPITALS, FACE A DAUNTING CHALLENGE OF SURVIVAL. SIGNIFICANT TIME WAS SPENT ANALYZING BRMC'S AND UAHS' FINANCES AND EVALUATING KALEIDA HEALTH AS A PARTNER. A DECISION TO AFFILIATE WAS MADE IN THE FALL OF 2016 AND WAS COMPLETED ON JULY 3, 2017.

201932269349301898,010238552,"Part III, Line 4:","MMC does not have a specific footnote in the financial statements that describes ""bad debt expense."" However, reference is made within the footnotes to a bad debt policy in a couple of instances. Within the footnote describing ""Net Patient Service Revenue"", the following explains the Provision for Bad Debts:""For receivables associated with self-pay patients, the Medical Center records a significant provision for bad debts in the period of service on the basis of its past experience, which indicates that many patients are unable or unwilling to pay the portion of their bill for which they are financially responsible. The difference between the standard rates and the amounts actually collected after all reasonable collection efforts have been exhausted is written off against the allowance for bad debts.""The amount of expense associated with the provision of services, ultimately written off as bad debt at MMC, has been calculated at $30,464,641 for the current fiscal year. This amount was calculated using a cost to charge ratio. Bad debt expense represents healthcare services MMC has provided without compensation. As a tax-exempt organization, MMC provides necessary patient care regardless of the patient's ability to pay for the services. MMC cannot determine the amount of bad debt expense that could be reasonably attributable to patients who likely would qualify for financial assistance under the Hospital's free care policy. In addition, bad debt expense also includes amounts for services provided to individuals experiencing difficult personal or economic circumstances related to a portion of our community based patient population. Their medical bills often place these individuals in untenable positions where they are not able to handle their personal debt and then their new medical debt. However, because of their income level, they do not qualify for free care. By providing necessary healthcare services to those individuals either who fail to apply for financial assistance or who are experiencing difficult personal or economic circumstances, MMC believes that bad debt expense should be included as a community benefit."
201932269349301898,010238552,"Part III, Line 8:","Medicare allowable costs were calculated using a cost to charge ratio. MMC believes that the Medicare shortfall should be included as a community benefit because MMC has a clear mission commitment to serving elderly patients and adults with disabilities through the provision of specific subsidized programs developed to help improve the health status of these patients.

Income is defined as the total annual cash receipts before taxes from all sources. Financially indigent. Uncompensated care shall include unreimbursed services to the financially indigent. Financially indigent shall mean uninsured or underinsured patients accepted for care with no obligation or a discounted obligation to pay for services rendered based on the medical center's eligibility system which may include: (a) income levels and means testing or other criteria for determining a patient's inability to pay; or b) other criteria for determining a patient's inability to pay that are consistent with the medical center's mission and established policy. The federal poverty level shall serve as an index for the threshold below which patients receiving care at St. Mary's Medical Center are deemed financially indigent. Financially indigent services include noncovered services for patients eligible for the Medicaid program, services provided under county indigent care contracts, and other state or federal assistance programs for low income groups. Medically indigent. Uncompensated care shall include unreimbursed services to the medically indigent. Medically indigent shall mean patients who are responsible for their living expenses, but whose medical and hospital bills, after payment by third party payers, where applicable, exceed: (a) a specified percentage of the patient's annual gross income (i.e., catastrophic medical expenses) in accordance with the Medical Center's formal eligibility system in such instances where payment would require liquidation of assets critical to living or earning a living; or (b) the criteria for determining a patient's inability to pay. While financial indigence is based strictly on an income level, medical indigence considers both income and the financial obligation for healthcare services to calculate the patient's ability to pay without liquidating assets critical to living or earning a living, such as a home, car, personal belongings, etc. Therefore, patients are considered for medically indigent status on a case by case basis. The patient would be required to provide documentation of income to determine if he/she is to be considered medically indigent. All patients are eligible to be considered for medically indigent status with the exception of patients with income below 200% of the federal poverty level as these patients are considered for some level of uncompensated care under the financially indigent category.

201922599349301132,010211534,Part VI - Additional Information,"Disclosure in accordance with Revenue Procedure 2015-21:Part V Facility Information, Section B Facility Policies and PracticesIn accordance with Revenue Procedure 2015-21, Mercy Hospital is disclosing the following information with respect to Section 501(r) issues that were discovered during the 2018 tax year and how these have been corrected to satisfy 501(r) requirements.For all items:A good-faith effort was made to implement the requirements of the Section 501(r) regulations. Mercy Hospital obtained information about the requirements and sought to implement them accordingly, but later identified some compliance gaps.The issues were discovered in fiscal year 2018 during an internal audit of Mercy Hospitals compliance with Sections 501(r). To ensure full compliance with Section 501(r) regulations, Northern Light Healths Community Health and Revenue Cycle Departments perform routine reviews to assure Mercy Hospital is in compliance with Section 501(r). In addition, Northern Light Health continues to engage Northern Light Health Internal Audit to review Mercy Hospitals compliance with Section 501(r).Specific issues and corrections:1. Incorrect calculation of Amounts Generally Billed (AGB) a. Requirement: A hospital facility may determine AGB for any emergency or other medically necessary care it provides to a FAP-eligible individual by multiplying the hospital facilitys gross charges for the care by one or more percentages of gross charges (AGB percentage(s)). A hospital facility using this method must calculate its AGB percentage(s) at least annually by dividing the sum of the amounts of all of its claims for emergency and other medically necessary care that have been allowed by health insurers during a prior 12-month period by the sum of the associated gross charges for those claims.b. Condition: Mercy Hospital incorrectly calculated the AGB because it did not use actual amounts allowed by health insurers or associated gross charges in its calculation of AGB. Instead, Mercy Hospital used adjusted net patient revenue divided by adjusted gross patient revenue in calculating the AGB.c. Corrective Action: In response, Mercy Hospital recalculated the AGB using the required data and retroactively adjusted its AGB for FY 2017 and 2018 to the correct percentage. Mercy Hospital has identified 1246 patient accounts affected by the correction and to date has corrected 972 accounts and has adjusted $67,979 in order to restore each affected individual to the position in which he or she would have been had the failure not have occurred. Of this total adjustment amount, $12,409 was actually required to be refunded to the individual; the remainder was in the form of accounting adjustments only. At this time Mercy Hospital has 274 accounts remaining to be corrected with an anticipated total adjustment of $39,956. d. Date Corrected: The new AGB was calculated in December 2018 and for 501(r) compliance purposes Mercy Hospital applied the correct AGB to all patient accounts as of the beginning of October 2018. By October 1, 2019, Mercy Hospital expects to restore each remaining affected individual to the position in which he or she would have been had the failure not have occurred.2. Widely Publicizeda. Requirement: In order to ensure the FAP is widely publicized, a hospital must take several actions, one of which is to make the FAP, FAP application form and a plain language summary of the FAP widely available on a Web site.b. Condition: On October 22, 2018, it was discovered that the link from Mercy Hospitals Billing Help Web page did not map correctly to the Northern Light Health Financial Assistance page.c. Corrective Action: Northern Light Health Information Technology was contacted to resolve the mapping issue. Northern Light Health has since established a monthly review of all FAP-related mapping to verify functionality.d. Date Corrected: October 30, 2018."

NEBH COMPLETED ITS MOST RECENT NEEDS ASSESSMENT DURING THE FISCAL YEAR ENDED SEPTEMBER 30, 2016. THAT CHNA WAS APPROVED BY THE BOARD OF TRUSTEES IN SEPTEMBER 2016. THE ACCOMPANYING IMPLEMENTATION STRATEGY FOR THE MOST RECENT CHNA WAS ALSO APPROVED BY THE BOARD OF TRUSTEES IN SEPTEMBER 2016 WHICH IS WITHIN THE TIMELINE REQUIRED BY THE TREASURY REGULATIONS UNDER IRC SECTION 501(R). THIS MOST RECENT CHNA AND IMPLEMENTATION STRATEGY (CHIP) INFORMED NEBH'S COMMUNITY BENEFITS PROCESS FOR THE PERIOD COVERED BY THIS FILING.

201922279349302592,042103612,COMMUNITY HEALTH NEEDS ASSESSMENT -- APPROACH AND METHODS,"NEBH IS COMMITTED TO COLLABORATING WITH COMMUNITY PARTNERS AND RESIDENTS FROM ACROSS BOSTON TO IDENTIFY AREAS OF SPECIAL NEED AND IMPROVE THE OVERALL HEALTH OF THE REGION. NEBH WORKS WITH ALL SEGMENTS OF THE POPULATION BUT IN RECOGNITION OF ITS STRONG TIES TO ITS SURROUNDING COMMUNITY AND ITS SPECIFIC CLINICAL EXPERTISE, NEBH FOCUSES ITS COMMUNITY BENEFIT EFFORTS ON IMPROVING THE HEALTH AND WELL-BEING OF THE LOW INCOME, UNDERSERVED POPULATIONS LIVING IN MISSION HILL AND ROXBURY AND ON MUSCULOSKELETAL HEALTH. NEBH CURRENTLY OPERATES NUMEROUS EDUCATIONAL, OUTREACH, AND COMMUNITY-STRENGTHENING INITIATIVES, COLLABORATES WITH MANY OF THE COMMUNITY'S LEADING SERVICE ORGANIZATIONS. DURING THE PERIOD COVERED BY THIS FILING, THE HOSPITAL COST TO SUPPORT ITS COMMUNITY BENEFIT COMMITMENTS AND THE MASSACHUSETTS UNCOMPENSATED CARE POOL EXCEEDED $4.5 MILLION. NEBH IS ALWAYS EAGER TO EXPLORE WAYS THAT IT CAN FURTHER ENGAGE AND ENRICH ITS CONNECTIONS TO THE COMMUNITY.THE 2016 COMMUNITY HEALTH NEEDS ASSESSMENT AND ASSOCIATED COMMUNITY HEALTH IMPROVEMENT PLAN WERE THE CULMINATION OF SEVERAL MONTHS OF WORK. THIS PROJECT WAS BORNE LARGELY OUT OF NEBH'S DESIRE TO BETTER UNDERSTAND AND ADDRESS THE HEALTH-RELATED NEEDS OF THOSE LIVING IN ITS SURROUNDING COMMUNITY. THE PROCESS IS ALSO DESIGNED TO MEET THE REQUIREMENTS OF THE MASSACHUSETTS ATTORNEY GENERAL'S OFFICE AND FEDERAL INTERNAL REVENUE SERVICE (IRS) REQUIREMENTS UNDER INTERNAL REVENUE CODE SECTION 501(R), WHICH MANDATE THAT ALL NONPROFIT HOSPITALS CONDUCT A PERIODIC COMMUNITY HEALTH NEEDS ASSESSMENT (CHNA) AND STRATEGIC PLANNING PROCESS. THE COMMONWEALTH REQUIRES NONPROFIT HOSPITALS AND MANAGED CARE ORGANIZATIONS TO UPDATE THEIR CHNAS EVERY YEAR AND THE IRS REQUIRES THAT A CHNA BE CONDUCTED EVERY THREE YEARS. MORE SPECIFICALLY, THE COMMONWEALTH AND IRS REGULATIONS REQUIRE THAT NEBH ASSESS COMMUNITY HEALTH NEED, ENGAGE THE COMMUNITY, IDENTIFY PRIORITY HEALTH ISSUES, AND CREATE A COMMUNITY HEALTH STRATEGY THAT DESCRIBES HOW THE HOSPITAL, IN COLLABORATION WITH THE COMMUNITY AND LOCAL HEALTH DEPARTMENT, WILL ADDRESS THE NEEDS AND THE PRIORITIES IDENTIFIED BY THE ASSESSMENT.IN LIGHT OF THESE REQUIREMENTS, NEBH HIRED JOHN SNOW, INC. (JSI), A NATIONALLY RECOGNIZED PUBLIC HEALTH CONSULTING FIRM, TO CONDUCT A COMPREHENSIVE COMMUNITY HEALTH NEEDS ASSESSMENT FOCUSING ON MISSION HILL AND ROXBURY, ITS PRIMARY SERVICE AREA WITH RESPECT TO ITS COMMUNITY BENEFIT INITIATIVES. THE OVERALL GOAL OF THE ASSESSMENT WAS TO COMPILE INFORMATION FROM A RANGE OF QUANTITATIVE AND QUALITATIVE SOURCES TO CLARIFY THE HEALTH CARE NEEDS AND PRIORITIES OF COMMUNITY RESIDENTS AND ASSESS THE OVERALL STRENGTHS AND WEAKNESSES OF THE AREA'S HEALTH AND SOCIAL SERVICE SYSTEMS. THE CHNA PROCESS WAS CONDUCTED IN THREE PHASES:-PHASE I: THE JSI PROJECT TEAM CONDUCTED A PRELIMINARY NEEDS ASSESSMENT THAT RELIED HEAVILY ON QUANTITATIVE HEALTH-RELATED DATA DRAWN FROM THE MASSACHUSETTS COMMUNITY HEALTH INFORMATION PROFILE MASSCHIP) SYSTEM AS WELL AS OTHER NATIONAL, STATE, AND LOCAL SOURCES. THESE DATA ALLOWED THE JSI PROJECT TEAM TO UNDERSTAND THE UNDERLYING CHARACTERISTICS OF AREA RESIDENTS AND IDENTIFY THE SPECIFIC SEGMENTS OF THE COMMUNITY MOST AT-RISK.-PHASE II: JSI CONDUCTED A SERIES OF INTERVIEWS WITH KEY STAKEHOLDERS AND TWO FOCUS GROUPS WITH COMMUNITY MEMBERS. THE FOCUS GROUPS HELPED THE JSI PROJECT TEAM TO ENGAGE THE COMMUNITY AND BETTER UNDERSTAND THEIR HEALTH STATUS, HEALTH-SEEKING BEHAVIORS, SERVICE GAPS, HEALTH-RELATED CHALLENGES, AND PRIORITIES. -PHASE III: CHRISTINE DWYER, DIRECTOR OF PUBLIC AFFAIRS AND COMMUNITY RELATIONS, WORKED WITH JSI TO INTEGRATE THE CHNA'S FINDINGS, INCLUDING FEEDBACK FROM NEBH STAFF AND THE COMMUNITY, AND DEVELOPED NEBH'S COMMUNITY HEALTH IMPROVEMENT PLAN. IN PHASE III, JSI ALSO DEVELOPED A FINAL CHNA REPORT, OBTAINED APPROVAL FOR ITS COMMUNITY HEALTH IMPROVEMENT PLAN FROM NEBH'S BOARD OF TRUSTEES, AND DISSEMINATED THE RESULTS OF THE PROJECT TO INTERNAL AND EXTERNAL STAKEHOLDERS.THE CHNA UTILIZED A PARTICIPATORY, COLLABORATIVE APPROACH TO LOOK AT HEALTH IN ITS BROADEST CONTEXT. AS NOTED ABOVE, THE ASSESSMENT PROCESS INCLUDED SYNTHESIZING EXISTING DATA ON SOCIAL, ECONOMIC, AND HEALTH INDICATORS IN THE REGION AS WELL AS INFORMATION FROM COMMUNITY DIALOGUES CONDUCTED WITH COMMUNITY RESIDENTS, AND INTERVIEWS WITH COMMUNITY STAKEHOLDERS.

201922279349302592,042103612,LEADING HEALTH-RELATED FINDINGS,"-SOCIAL DETERMINANTS OF HEALTH (E.G., ECONOMIC STABILITY, EDUCATION, AND COMMUNITY/SOCIAL CONTEXT) CONTINUE TO HAVE A TREMENDOUS IMPACT ON MANY SEGMENTS OF THE POPULATION. THE DOMINANT THEME FROM THE ASSESSMENT'S KEY INFORMANT INTERVIEWS AND COMMUNITY FORUMS WAS THE CONTINUED IMPACT THAT THE UNDERLYING SOCIAL DETERMINANTS OF HEALTH ARE HAVING ON THE CBSA'S LOW INCOME, UNDERSERVED, DIVERSE POPULATION COHORTS. MORE SPECIFICALLY, DETERMINANTS SUCH AS POVERTY, EMPLOYMENT OPPORTUNITIES, VIOLENCE, TRANSPORTATION, RACIAL SEGREGATION, LITERACY, PROVIDER LINGUISTIC/CULTURAL COMPETENCY, SOCIAL SUPPORT, AND COMMUNITY COHESION LIMIT MANY PEOPLE'S ABILITY TO CARE FOR THEIR OWN AND/OR THEIR FAMILIES' HEALTH. -LOW INCOME. 35% OF ROXBURY RESIDENTS AND 41% OF MISSIONHILL RESIDENTS LIVED BELOW THE FEDERAL POVERTY LINE COMPARED TO 22% FOR BOSTON AND 12% FOR THE COMMONWEALTH OVERALL. 58% OF ROXBURY'S POPULATION AND 62% OF MISSION HILL'S POPULATION LIVE IN HOUSEHOLDS EARNING LESS THAN 200% OF THE FEDERAL POVERTY LEVEL COMPARED TO 38% FOR BOSTON AND 25% FOR THE COMMONWEALTH OVERALL. -ECONOMIC CHALLENGES. 79% OF ROXBURY'S HOUSING UNITS AND 91% OF MISSION HILL'S HOUSING UNITS WERE RENTER-OCCUPIED COMPARED TO 66% FOR BOSTON AND 38% FOR THE COMMONWEALTH. 46% OF ROXBURY RESIDENTS AND 50% OF MISSION HILL RESIDENTS LIVING IN RENTAL UNITS WERE CONSIDERED TO BE ""HOUSE POOR"" AS 35% OR MORE OF THEIR INCOME WAS SPENT ON HOUSING COMPARED TO 41% FOR BOSTON AND THE COMMONWEALTH.-EDUCATIONAL ATTAINMENT. 77% OF ROXBURY'S POPULATION AND 85% OF MISSION HILL'S POPULATION HAD A HIGH SCHOOL DEGREE OR HIGHER COMPARED TO 85% FOR BOSTON AND 90% FOR THE COMMONWEALTH. ONLY 23% OF ROXBURY'S POPULATION AND 36% OF MISSION HILL'S POPULATION HAD A BACHELOR'S DEGREE OR HIGHER COMPARED TO 45% FOR BOSTON AND 40% FOR THE COMMONWEALTH.-VIOLENCE. KEY INFORMANTS AND COMMUNITY FORUM ATTENDEES NAMED VIOLENCE AS A LEADING HEALTH AND SAFETY CONCERN. NEIGHBORHOOD VIOLENCE CAN SEVERELY LIMIT AN INDIVIDUAL'S ABILITY AND MOTIVATION TO EXERCISE AND PARTICIPATE IN OUTDOOR EVENTS AND ACTIVITIES. FURTHERMORE, STUDIES HAVE SHOWN THAT NEIGHBORHOODS IN WHICH RESIDENTS SHARE FEELINGS OF MUTUAL TRUST AND CONNECTEDNESS ARE MORE LIKELY TO WORK TOGETHER TO ACHIEVE COMMON GOALS, LIKE CLEANER AND SAFER PUBLIC SPACES, AND MAINTAIN SOCIAL CONTROLS THAT DISCOURAGE UNDESIRABLE BEHAVIORS, LIKE UNDERAGE SUBSTANCE USE AND GANG ACTIVITY. AMONG RESIDENTS OF ROXBURY, THE HOMICIDE RATE PER 100,000 POPULATION WAS 16.1 COMPARED TO 6.6 FOR BOSTON OVERALL.4 THE RATE OF NONFATAL GUNSHOT/STABBING EMERGENCY DEPARTMENT VISITS WAS 153.6 PER 100,000 POPULATION IN ROXBURY, COMPARED TO 76.9 FOR BOSTON OVERALL.-TRANSPORTATION. COMMUNITY FORUM ATTENDEES IDENTIFIED A NEED FOR A BROAD INTERVENTION TO ADDRESS TRANSPORTATION EQUITY ISSUES ON MISSION HILL. ACCESS TO AFFORDABLE AND RELIABLE FORMS OF TRANSPORTATION WAS A KEY AREA OF CONCERN FOR OLDER ADULTS, WHO RELY ON VARIOUS FORMS OF PUBLIC TRANSPORT TO ATTEND DOCTOR'S APPOINTMENTS, VISIT THE PHARMACY, AND ACCESS OTHER HEALTH AND SOCIAL SERVICES.-OLDER ADULTS. 12% OF ROXBURY'S POPULATION AND 7% OF MISSION HILL'S POPULATION IS OVER 65 YEARS OF AGE COMPARED TO 10% FOR BOSTON AND 14% FOR THE COMMONWEALTH.6 MANY FORUM ATTENDEES IDENTIFIED OLDER ADULTS AS A POPULATION THAT HAS UNIQUE NEEDS AND DISPARATE HEALTH OUTCOMES, YET ARE RELUCTANT TO VOICE CONCERNS OVER FEAR OF DISPLACEMENT FROM THEIR HOMES AND COMMUNITIES.-DISPARITIES IN HEALTH OUTCOMES EXIST IN NEBH CBSA BY RACE/ETHNICITY, FOREIGN BORN STATUS, AND LANGUAGE: AS WAS ESTABLISHED IN THE 2013 NEBH COMMUNITY BENEFITS CHNA REPORT, THERE ARE MAJOR HEALTH DISPARITIES FOR RESIDENTS LIVING IN NEBH'S CBSA. THIS IS PARTICULARLY TRUE FOR RACIALLY/ETHNICALLY DIVERSE, FOREIGN BORN, AND NON-ENGLISH SPEAKING RESIDENTS LIVING IN ROXBURY, AT THE HEART OF NEBH'S CBSA, WHICH FACE MANY OF THE MOST SIGNIFICANT DISPARITIES IN THE CITY OF BOSTON AND MASSACHUSETTS OVERALL. THE IMPACT OF RACISM, BARRIERS TO CARE, AND DISPARITIES IN HEALTH OUTCOMES THAT THOSE LIVING IN NEBH'S CBSA FACE ARE WIDELY DOCUMENTED IN THE LITERATURE AND ARE CONFIRMED BY NUMEROUS NATIONAL, COMMONWEALTH, AND LOCAL DATA SOURCES, INCLUDING QUANTITATIVE DATA FROM THE BOSTON PUBLIC HEALTH COMMISSION 2014-15 HEALTH OF BOSTON REPORT.7 IT SHOULD ALSO BE NOTED THAT ONE OF THE DOMINANT THEMES FROM THE ASSESSMENT'S KEY INFORMANT INTERVIEWS AND COMMUNITY FORUMS WAS THE IMPACT THAT THE UNDERLYING SOCIAL DETERMINANTS LISTED ABOVE HAVE ON THE SERVICE AREA, PARTICULARLY ON LOW INCOME, RACIALLY/ETHNICALLY DIVERSE, AND OLDER ADULT COHORTS.-RACE/ETHNICITY. 9% OF ROXBURY'S POPULATION AND 45% OF MISSION HILL'S POPULATION IS NON- HISPANIC WHITE COMPARED TO 75% FOR BOSTON AND THE COMMONWEALTH. NON-HISPANIC BLACKS, NON-HISPANIC ASIANS, AND HISPANICS REPRESENT A SIGNIFICANTLY LARGER PERCENTAGE OF ROXBURY'S POPULATION (55%, 2%, 29%) AND MISSION HILL'S POPULATION (21%, 12%, 20%)COMPARED TO BOSTON (13%, 6%, 5%) AND THE COMMONWEALTH (6%, 6%, 10%).-FOREIGN BORN. 27% OF ROXBURY'S POPULATION AND 23% OF MISSION HILL'S POPULATION IS FOREIGN BORN COMPARED TO 15% FOR THE COMMONWEALTH.-LINGUISTICALLY ISOLATED. 43% OF ROXBURY'S POPULATION AND 39% OF MISSION HILL'S POPULATION IS LINGUISTICALLY ISOLATED COMPARED TO 37% FOR BOSTON AND 22% FOR THE COMMONWEALTH. 27% OF ROXBURY'S POPULATION AND 18% OF MISSION HILL'S POPULATION SPEAK SPANISH AT HOME COMPARED TO 16% FOR BOSTON AND 8% FOR THE COMMONWEALTH.IT IS CRUCIAL THAT THESE DISPARITIES BE ADDRESSED AND, TO THIS END, NEBH'S COMMUNITY HEALTH IMPROVEMENT PLAN CONTINUES TO INCLUDE A RANGE OF PROGRAMS THAT ARE TARGETED TO ADDRESS THESE DISPARITIES. HOWEVER, IT IS CRITICAL TO NOTE THAT THERE IS A MULTITUDE OF INDIVIDUAL, COMMUNITY AND SOCIETAL FACTORS THAT WORK TOGETHER TO CREATE THESE INEQUITIES. THE UNDERLYING ISSUE IS NOT ONLY RACE/ETHNICITY, FOREIGN BORN STATUS, OR LANGUAGE BUT RATHER A BROAD ARRAY OF INTER-RELATED ISSUES INCLUDING ECONOMIC OPPORTUNITY, EDUCATION, CRIME, AND COMMUNITY COHESION. ARGUABLY, THESE ARE THE LEADING DETERMINANTS OF HEALTH FOR ALL URBAN COMMUNITIES IN THE UNITED STATES, AND THEY ARE DAUNTING CHALLENGES. NEBH IS COMMITTED TO DOING WHAT IT CAN TO ADDRESS THESE FACTORS AND MANY OF THE COMPONENTS OF NEBH'S CHIP IS STRUCTURED TO ADDRESS THE EXISTING HEALTH DISPARITIES AND INEQUITIES IN SOME WAY.-LIMITED ACCESS TO PRIMARY CARE MEDICAL AND SPECIALTY CARE, ORAL HEALTH, AND BEHAVIORAL HEALTH SERVICES FOR LOW INCOME, MEDICAID INSURED, UNINSURED, AND OTHER POPULATION SEGMENTS FACING BARRIERS TO CARE. MASSACHUSETTS HAS ONE OF THE HIGHEST RATES OF HEALTH INSURANCE AND ONE OF THE STRONGEST, MOST ROBUST HEALTH SERVICE SYSTEMS IN THE NATION, YET THERE ARE STILL SUBSTANTIAL POCKETS OF LOW INCOME, MEDICAID INSURED, UNINSURED, AND UNDERINSURED RESIDENTS WHO HAVE LIMITED ACCESS TO NEEDED SERVICES AND/OR ARE NOT PROPERLY ENGAGED IN ESSENTIAL MEDICAL, ORAL, AND BEHAVIORAL HEALTH SERVICES. AS WILL BE DISCUSSED BELOW, THESE POPULATIONS ARE, IN TURN, MORE LIKELY TO USE THE EMERGENCY ROOM AND MORE LIKELY TO HAVE HEALTH RISK FACTORS SUCH AS OBESITY, POOR FITNESS, AND RISKY ALCOHOL USE AS WELL AS MORE LIKELY TO HAVE DIABETES, HYPERTENSION, AND ASTHMA.-LOW INCOME SEGMENTS MOST AT-RISK. KEY INFORMANTS AND COMMUNITY FORUM PARTICIPANTS STRESSED THE FACT THAT DESPITE THE RELATIVE AFFLUENCE OF THE AREA, THERE WERE POCKETS OF SERVICE AREA RESIDENTS WHO STRUGGLED WITH POOR HEALTH OUTCOMES AND FACED SIGNIFICANT BARRIERS TO ACCESS.12 THESE POPULATIONS WERE MORE LIKELY TO BE LOW INCOME, OLDER ADULT, AND FOREIGN BORN.-HIGH UNINSURANCE RATES IN LOW INCOME. AMONG LOW-INCOME RESIDENTS OF THE COMMONWEALTH, THE UNINSURANCE RATE WAS 8% - DOUBLE THE UNINSURANCE RATE OF THE COMMONWEALTH'S TOTAL POPULATION (4%).13 ACCORDING TO THE BLUE CROSS FOUNDATION, UNINSURED ADULTS IN THE COMMONWEALTH WERE MORE LIKELY TO BE YOUNG, MALE, AND SINGLE, WITH LOWER REPORTED EDUCATIONAL ATTAINMENT. HOWEVER, THE MAJORITY OF UNINSURED ADULTS WERE EMPLOYED.-LACK OF ACCESS TO PRIMARY MEDICAL AND ORAL HEALTH CARE SERVICES. UNINSURED ADULTS ARE LESS LIKELY TO USE HEALTH CARE SERVICES THAN THOSE THAT ARE INSURED. APPROXIMATELY 87% OF INSURED ADULTS IN THE COMMONWEALTH REPORTED VISITING A GENERAL PHYSICIAN WITHIN THE PAST 12 MONTHS, COMPARED TO 63% OF UNINSURED ADULTS. UNINSURED ADULTS ARE MORE LIKELY TO REPORT PROBLEMS OBTAINING CARE COMPARED TO THOSE THAT WERE INSURED (37% VERSUS 21%, RESPECTIVELY. MOST CONCERNING IS THAT AMONG ALL ADULTS WHO REPORTED A HEALTH CARE VISIT, UNINSURED ADULTS WERE NEARLY 30 PERCENTAGE POINTS LESS LIKELY TO RATE THE QUALITY OF CARE AS VERY GOOD OR EXCELLENT.15 FINALLY, 3 IN 10 (30.1%) OF THOSE LIVING AT 138% OF THE FEDERAL POVERTY LEVEL OR BELOW REPORTED NOT GETTING NEEDED DENTAL CARE DUE TO COST AND 1 IN 5 (19.3%) WERE NOT ABLE TO FILL A NEEDED DRUG PRESCRIPTION DUE TO COST."
201922279349302592,042103612,-LACK OF ACCESS TO BEHAVIORAL HEALTH SERVICES,"ONE OF THE MOST COMMON FINDINGS FROM THOSE WHO WERE INTERVIEWED OR PARTICIPATED IN THE COMMUNITY FORUMS WAS THE BURDEN OF MENTAL HEALTH AND SUBSTANCE ABUSE ON RESIDENTS THROUGHOUT NEBH'S SERVICE AREA. RESIDENTS SUFFERED FROM A BROAD RANGE OF ISSUES INCLUDING DEPRESSION, ANXIETY, DEMENTIA, ALCOHOL ABUSE, AND OPIOID ABUSE. IN ADDITION TO DISCUSSING THE BURDEN OF THESE ISSUES ON INDIVIDUALS, FAMILIES, AND THE COMMUNITY, PARTICIPANTS REFLECTED ON THE LACK OF EDUCATIONAL, ASSESSMENT, AND TREATMENT SERVICES AVAILABLE IN THE COMMUNITY TO SUPPORT THOSE WITH BEHAVIORAL HEALTH ISSUES.-HIGHER EMERGENCY DEPARTMENT UTILIZATION. APPROXIMATELY 38% OF UNINSURED ADULTS IN THE COMMONWEALTH REPORTED VISITING THE EMERGENCY DEPARTMENT IN THE PAST YEAR; 18% REPORTED THAT THEIR MOST RECENT ED VISIT WAS FOR A NON-EMERGENCY CONDITION THAT COULD HAVE BEEN TREATED BY A GENERAL PHYSICIAN IF ONE WAS AVAILABLE. THIS COMPARED TO 32% AND 13%, RESPECTIVELY, FOR INSURED ADULTS.-HIGH RATES OF THE LEADING HEALTH RISK FACTORS. ONE OF THE LEADING FINDINGS FROM THE ASSESSMENT IS THAT MANY COMMUNITIES AND/OR POPULATION SEGMENTS IN NEBH'S CBSA HAVE HIGH RATES OF CHRONIC PHYSICAL AND BEHAVIORAL HEALTH CONDITIONS. IN SOME INDIVIDUALS, THESE CONDITIONS HAVE UNDERLYING GENETIC ROOTS THAT ARE DIFFICULT TO COUNTER. HOWEVER, FOR MOST PEOPLE THESE CONDITIONS ARE WIDELY CONSIDERED TO BE PREVENTABLE OR MANAGEABLE. ADDRESSING THE LEADING HEALTH RISK FACTORS (E.G., LACK OF NUTRITIONAL FOOD AND PHYSICAL ACTIVITY, ALCOHOL/ILLICIT DRUG ABUSE, AND TOBACCO USE) IS CRITICAL TO CHRONIC DISEASE PREVENTION AND MANAGEMENT EFFORTS. IT SHOULD BE NOTED THAT MOST AREAS WITHIN NEBH'S SERVICE AREA FARE WELL AGAINST COMMONWEALTH AVERAGES ON THESE RISK FACTORS. HOWEVER, THERE ARE CITIES/TOWNS WHOSE RATES ARE NOT AS FAVORABLE. AS STATED ABOVE, LOW-INCOME, FOREIGN BORN, AND OLDER SEGMENTS OF THE POPULATION ARE MORE LIKELY TO BE AT-RISK.-OVERWEIGHT/OBESE. 30% OF ROXBURY ADULTS REPORTED IN OBESE CATEGORIES COMPARED TO 22% FOR BOSTON. 30% OF ROXBURY ADULTS CONSUMED VEGETABLES LESS THAN ONCE PER DAY COMPARED TO 25% FOR BOSTON.-CIGARETTE SMOKING. 18% OF ROXBURY ADULTS REPORTED AS CURRENT SMOKERS COMPARED TO 16% FOR BOSTON OVERALL.-ALCOHOL USE. ROXBURY'S ALCOHOL-RELATED HOSPITAL PATIENT ENCOUNTER RATE PER 1,000 POPULATION WAS 22.6 COMPARED TO 17.7 FOR BOSTON.-HIGH RATES OF SUBSTANCE USE AND MENTAL HEALTH ISSUES. DURING INTERVIEWS AND COMMUNITY FORUMS, RESIDENTS AND AREA SERVICE PROVIDERS SPOKE PASSIONATELY ABOUT THE TREMENDOUS IMPACT THAT MENTAL HEALTH AND SUBSTANCE USE ISSUES HAVE ON MANY INDIVIDUALS AND FAMILIES IN THE SERVICE AREA. DEPRESSION AND ANXIETY, ISOLATION, ALCOHOL ABUSE, OPIOID AND PRESCRIPTION DRUG ABUSE, AND POST-TRAUMATIC STRESS DISORDER WERE IDENTIFIED AS MAJOR HEALTH CONCERNS. OPIOID ABUSE WAS A PARTICULAR CONCERN FOR RESIDENTS AND SERVICE PROVIDERS IN NEBH'S SERVICE AREA AND THERE WERE CALLS FOR GREATER OUTREACH, EDUCATION, SCREENING, AND TREATMENT SERVICES FOR ALL SEGMENTS OF THE POPULATION. DESPITE THE BURDEN OF MENTAL HEALTH AND SUBSTANCE ABUSE ON ALL PEOPLE, THERE IS AN EXTREMELY LIMITED SERVICE SYSTEM AVAILABLE TO MEET SPECIALIZED NEEDS, ESPECIALLY FOR OLDER ADULTS, THOSE WITH MILD TO MODERATE EPISODIC ISSUES, AND THOSE WITH SEVERE, COMPLEX, CHRONIC CONDITIONS. EFFORTS NEED TO BE MADE TO EXPAND ACCESS, REDUCE BARRIERS TO CARE (INCLUDING STIGMA), AND IMPROVE THE QUALITY OF PRIMARY CARE AND SPECIALIZED BEHAVIORAL HEALTH SERVICES.-SUBSTANCE USE. ROXBURY'S RATE OF ADMISSIONS TO TREATMENT PROGRAMS FOR SUBSTANCE USE PER 1,000 POPULATION WAS 55.8 COMPARED TO 30.2 FOR BOSTON.-SUBSTANCE USE. ROXBURY'S ALCOHOL-RELATED HOSPITAL PATIENT ENCOUNTER RATE PER 1,000 POPULATION WAS 22.6 COMPARED TO 17.7 FOR BOSTON. SIMILARLY, THE DRUG-RELATED HOSPITAL PATIENT ENCOUNTER RATE PER 1,000 POPULATION WAS 12.2 COMPARED TO 6.8 FOR BOSTON.-SUBSTANCE USE. ROXBURY'S UNINTENTIONAL DRUG OVERDOSE DEATH RATE PER 100,000 POPULATION WAS 15.9 COMPARED TO 15.5 FOR BOSTON. THE UNINTENTIONAL OPIOID OVERDOSE/POISONING HOSPITAL PATIENT ENCOUNTER RATE WAS 1.9 FOR ROXBURY COMPARED TO 1.1 FOR BOSTON.-SUBSTANCE USE. ROXBURY'S SUBSTANCE ABUSE MORTALITY RATE PER 100,000 RESIDENTS WAS 36.3 COMPARED TO 33.9 FOR BOSTON (HOB 2012-2013 - AVERAGE ANNUAL RATES FOR 2005- 2011).-MENTAL HEALTH. THE RATE OF MENTAL HEALTH HOSPITALIZATIONS FOR ROXBURY WAS 9.0 COMPARED TO 8.0 FOR BOSTON.-MENTAL HEALTH. 13% OF ROXBURY ADULTS REPORTED AS BEING IN POOR MENTAL OR EMOTIONAL HEALTH MORE THAN 15 DAYS IN THE PAST MONTH COMPARED TO 12% FOR BOSTON RESIDENTS.-MENTAL HEALTH. KEY INFORMANTS AND COMMUNITY FORUM PARTICIPANTS IDENTIFIED ISOLATION AND DEPRESSION AS A LEADING ISSUE FACED BY THE AREA'S OLDER ADULT POPULATION. INTERVIEWEES AND FORUM PARTICIPANTS DISCUSSED ADDITIONAL CHALLENGES FACED BY OLDER ADULTS WHO ARE MORE LIKELY TO STRUGGLE WITH CHRONIC PHYSICAL HEALTH CONDITIONS. THEY FACE BARRIERS THAT MAKE IT HARDER FOR THEM TO LEAVE THEIR HOMES, ESPECIALLY IF THEY ARE SICK, FRAIL, OR DEPRESSED.-HIGH RATES OF CHRONIC AND ACUTE PHYSICAL HEALTH CONDITIONS, PARTICULARLY FOR LOW INCOME POPULATIONS (E.G., HEART DISEASE, HYPERTENSION, CANCER, AND ASTHMA). THE ASSESSMENT'S QUANTITATIVE DATA SHOWS THAT, OVERALL, NEBH'S SERVICE AREA FARES BETTER THAN THE COMMONWEALTH WITH RESPECT TO CHRONIC DISEASE RATES. IT SHOULD BE NOTED THAT EVEN FOR THOSE COMMUNITIES THAT DO NOT HAVE RATES THAT ARE STATISTICALLY HIGHER THAN THE COMMONWEALTH, THESE CONDITIONS ARE STILL THE LEADING CAUSES OF PREMATURE DEATH.-CARDIOVASCULAR DISEASE. THE HOSPITALIZATION RATE PER 1,000 POPULATION DUE TO HEART DISEASE WAS 13.2 FOR ROXBURY COMPARED TO 9.1 FOR BOSTON. THE MORTALITY RATE PER 100,000 DUE TO HEART DISEASE WAS 148.3 FOR ROXBURY COMPARED TO 133.6 FOR BOSTON.-HYPERTENSION. THE HOSPITALIZATION RATE PER 100,000 DUE TO HYPERTENSION WAS 110 FOR BOSTON COMPARED TO 45 FOR THE COMMONWEALTH. 28.3% OF ROXBURY ADULTS REPORTED HAVING HYPERTENSION COMPARED TO 24% FOR BOSTON OVERALL.-DIABETES. THE DIABETES PREVALENCE IN ROXBURY WAS SIGNIFICANTLY HIGHER COMPARED TO BOSTON OVERALL. 15.1% OF ROXBURY ADULTS REPORTED HAVING DIABETES COMPARED TO 8.6% OF BOSTON ADULTS. THE HOSPITALIZATION RATE DUE TO DIABETES PER 1,000 POPULATION WAS 3.5 FOR ROXBURY, COMPARED TO 1.9 FOR BOSTON.-ASTHMA. 13.8% OF ROXBURY ADULTS REPORTED HAVING ASTHMA COMPARED TO 11.1% FOR BOSTON. THE HOSPITALIZATION RATE DUE TO ASTHMA PER 1,000 POPULATION WAS 5.9 FOR ROXBURY, COMPARED TO 2.6 FOR BOSTON. SIMILARLY, THE HOSPITAL EMERGENCY DISCHARGE PER 1,000 POPULATION DUE TO ASTHMA WAS 17.5 FOR ROXBURY, COMPARED TO 9.0 FOR BOSTON OVERALL.-HIGH RATES OF HIV/AIDS. GREAT STRIDES HAVE BEEN MADE IN CONTROLLING AND MANAGING HIV/AIDS, AND FOR MANY IT IS MANAGED AS A CHRONIC CONDITION WITH MEDICATIONS. ALTHOUGH RATES OF ILLNESS, DEATH, AND HIV TRANSMISSION DECLINED OVERALL IN THE PAST DECADE, HIV/AIDS CONTINUES TO IMPACT CERTAIN SEGMENTS OF THE POPULATION, INCLUDING MEN WHO HAVE SEX WITH MEN AND INJECTION DRUG USERS. IN NEBH'S CBSA, RATES OF HIV/AIDS ARE PARTICULARLY HIGH IN ROXBURY. THE HOSPITALIZATION RATE PER 100,000 WHERE HIV/AIDS WAS THE PRIMARY REASON FOR THE VISIT WAS 40 FOR BOSTON COMPARED TO 12 FOR THE COMMONWEALTH.-HIGH RATES OF CANCER, PARTICULARLY FOR LOW INCOME, RACIALLY/ETHNICALLY DIVERSE, AND OTHERWISE AT- RISK POPULATION SEGMENTS. MANY OF THE COMMUNITIES THAT ARE PART OF NEBH'S SERVICE AREA HAVE HIGH CANCER INCIDENCE, HOSPITALIZATION OR MORTALITY RATES. THIS IS PARTICULARLY TRUE FOR CERTAIN CANCERS IN SPECIFIC COMMUNITIES. ROXBURY IS MORE BURDENED BY COLORECTAL CANCER, BREAST CANCER, LUNG CANCER, PANCREATIC CANCER, AND PROSTATE CANCER. THERE ARE A MYRIAD OF FACTORS ASSOCIATED WITH CANCER AND MANY OF THEM ARE DIFFICULT TO ASSESS OR ADDRESS. HOWEVER, AT THE ROOT OF ADDRESSING CANCER AND HIGH MORTALITY IS SCREENING, EARLY DETECTION, PEER SUPPORT, AND ACCESS TO TIMELY, SUPPORTIVE, QUALITY TREATMENT.-CANCER. ROXBURY'S MORTALITY RATE DUE TO COLORECTAL CANCER PER 100,000 POPULATION WAS25.5 COMPARED TO 16.4 FOR BOSTON. THE MORTALITY RATE DUE TO LUNG CANCER WAS 64.3 COMPARED TO 45.4 FOR BOSTON.-CANCER. ROXBURY'S MORTALITY RATE DUE TO BREAST CANCER IN FEMALES PER 100,000 POPULATION WAS 23.6 COMPARED TO 17.9 FOR BOSTON. THE MORTALITY RATE DUE TO PROSTATE CANCER WAS49.5 COMPARED TO 25.7 FOR BOSTON.-CANCER. ROXBURY'S MORTALITY RATE DUE TO PANCREATIC CANCER PER 100,000 WAS 16.1 COMPARED TO 12.1 FOR BOSTON."

NEBH HAS FRAMED THE COMMUNITY HEALTH NEEDS IN THREE PRIORITY AREAS, WHICH TOGETHER ENCOMPASS THE BROAD RANGE OF HEALTH ISSUES AND SOCIAL DETERMINANTS OF HEALTH FACING RESIDENTS LIVING IN NEBH'S CBSA. THESE THREE AREAS ARE: 1) SOCIAL DETERMINANTS HEALTH (INCLUDING POVERTY, FOOD INSECURITY, SAFETY AND VIOLENCE), 2) CHRONIC DISEASE MANAGEMENT AND PREVENTION (INCLUDING PHYSICAL, BEHAVIORAL, AND EMOTIONAL RISK FACTORS AS WELL AS CHRONIC DISEASE MANAGEMENT) AND 3) ELDER HEALTH (INCLUDING ACCESS TO CARE, FALLS PREVENTION, DEPRESSION/ANXIETY, AND ISOLATION).IT SHOULD BE NOTED THAT ONE OF THE PRIMARY DIFFERENCES WITH RESPECT TO NEBH'S COMMUNITY HEALTH ASSESSMENT IN 2016 COMPARED TO ITS ASSESSMENT IN 2013 WAS THE IMPACT AND BURDEN OF BEHAVIORAL HEALTH ISSUES. WHILE, NEBH DOES NOT HAVE THE EXPERTISE AND CAPACITY TO DEDICATE A GREAT DEAL OF COMMUNITY BENEFITS RESOURCES TO BEHAVIORAL HEALTH ISSUES, THE ORGANIZATION IS COMMITTED TO DOING WHAT IT CAN TO PROMOTE AWARENESS, EDUCATE, AND REDUCE THE IMPACTS OF BEHAVIORAL HEALTH ISSUES, PARTICULARLY FOR YOUTH/ADOLESCENT AND OLDER ADULT SEGMENTS OF ITS SERVICE AREA. FOR EXAMPLE, NEBH WORKS WITH COMMUNITY PARTNERS TO REDUCE VIOLENCE AND ITS IMPACTS AMONG YOUTH. NEBH ALSO PROMOTES PHYSICAL ACTIVITY AND SOCIALIZATION AMONG ITS OLDER ADULT POPULATION WITCH HAS CLEAR BENEFITS WITH RESPECT TO PHYSICAL AND EMOTIONAL WELL-BEING. FINALLY, WITH RESPECT TO CHRONIC DISEASE MANAGEMENT, NEBH SPONSORS EDUCATIONAL SESSIONS AND WORKSHOPS THAT EDUCATE PARTICIPANTS ON THE RISK FACTORS ASSOCIATED WITH CHRONIC DISEASE, INCLUDING THE PHYSICAL, BEHAVIORAL, AND EMOTIONAL FACTORS SUCH AS DEPRESSION, ALCOHOL AND DRUG ABUSE."

THESE POPULATIONS ARE DISPROPORTIONATELY FROM RACIAL/ETHNIC MINORITY GROUPS AND, PARTLY AS A RESULT OF THEIR POVERTY, FACE DISPARITIES IN HEALTH AND ACCESS TO CARE OUTCOMES. IT IS CRITICAL TO NOTE THAT THERE IS A MULTITUDE OF INDIVIDUAL, COMMUNITY AND SOCIETAL FACTORS THAT WORK TOGETHER TO CREATE THESE INEQUITIES. IT IS INSUFFICIENT TO TALK SOLELY ABOUT RACE/ETHNICITY, FOREIGN BORN STATUS, OR LANGUAGE AS THE UNDERLYING AND CORRELATIVE ISSUES RELATED TO HEALTH AND WELL-BEING INVOLVE ECONOMIC OPPORTUNITY, EDUCATION, CRIME, AND COMMUNITY COHESION.

PARTICIPANTS REVIEWED THE ASSESSMENT FINDINGS AND THE CURRENT COMMUNITY BENEFITS PROGRAM ACTIVITIES. FROM THESE DISCUSSIONS, A LISTING OF COMMUNITY BENEFITS TARGET POPULATIONS AND COMMUNITY HEALTH PRIORITIES WERE IDENTIFIED. FINALLY, NEBH STAFF, WITH INPUT FROM JSI AND THE COMMUNITY BENEFITS COMMITTEE, DEVELOPED NEBH'S COMMUNITY HEALTH IMPROVEMENT PLAN (CHIP), WHICH BUILDS ON PRIOR WORK. CARE WAS TAKEN TO IDENTIFY THOSE ACTIVITIES THAT CONTINUE TO BE ALIGNED WITH COMMUNITY NEED AND ARE HAVING A A POSITIVE IMPACT ON THE COMMUNITY. NEW COMMUNITY HEALTH ACTIVITIES WERE IDENTIFIED IN RESPONSE TO KNOWLEDGE OF BEST PRACTICES AND NEW NEEDS IDENTIFIED BY THE ASSESSMENT.

AS PEOPLE GROW OLDER, THE LEVEL OF MOBILITY THAT THE ELDERLY POPULATION HAS CAN BECOME LIMITED. THE NEED FOR A BUS IN THE MISSION HILL COMMUNITY IS MUCH NEEDED. WITHOUT THE MONETARY ASSISTANCE FROM NEBH AND THE MBTA, THE COMMUNITY WOULD NOT HAVE TRANSPORTATION UP AND DOWN THE HILL.COMMUNITY ACTIVITIES:I.THE MISSION LINK BUS PROVIDES MUCH NEEDED TRANSPORTATION FOR THE ELDERLY, GETTING THEM TO AND FROM THEIR DOCTOR'S APPOINTMENTS, FOOD SHOPPING, PHARMACY, ETC. AS WELL AS PROVIDING THE OPPORTUNITY FOR THEM TO BE SOCIAL AND ACTIVE. NEBH IS COMMITTED TO ENABLING A HEALTHY LIFESTYLE FOR SENIORS THAT LIVE IN OUR COMMUNITY.

NEBH CONTINUES TO BEAUTIFY THE NEIGHBORHOOD HIRING A TRASH TRUCK EACH YEAR DURING STUDENT MOVE IN WEEK, HELPING WITH SNOW REMOVAL FOR THE CITY OF BOSTON, SWEEPING AND CLEANING THE STREETS THAT SURROUND THE HOSPITAL AND COMMUNITY AND WORKING WITH COMMUNITY MEMBERS AND MISSION MAIN STREETS ON KEEPING MISSION HILL CLEAN.IV.NEBH FINANCIALLY SUPPORTS MUCH NEEDED OFFICE SPACE FOR MISSION HILL MAIN STREETS IN A NEW ENGLAND BAPTIST HOSPITAL BUILDING IN MISSION HILL.-COMMUNITY PARTNERS:-MISSION LINK-FRIENDS OF MCLAUGHLIN PARK-CITY OF BOSTON-PROBLEM PROPERTIES TASK FORCE -MISSION HILL COMMUNITYPRIORITY AREA # 2 : CHRONIC DISEASE MANAGEMENT AND PREVENTIONLACK OF PHYSICAL ACTIVITY, POOR NUTRITION, ALCOHOL ABUSE, DEPRESSION/ISOLATION, AND TOBACCO USE ARE SOME OF THE LEADING RISK FACTORS FOR CHRONIC DISEASE AND POOR EMOTIONAL HEALTH. ADDRESSING THESE ISSUES AND DEVELOPING HEALTHY HABITS IN THESE AREAS ARE AMONG THE MOST IMPORTANT THINGS PEOPLE OF ALL AGES CAN DO TO IMPROVE THEIR HEALTH AND MANAGE THEIR CHRONIC HEALTH CONDITIONS. PHYSICAL ACTIVITY HELPS PREVENT MANY DISEASES (E.G. HEART DISEASE, DIABETES AND SOME CANCERS), STRENGTHENS BONES AND MUSCLES, REDUCES STRESS AND DEPRESSION AND MAKES IT EASIER FOR PEOPLE TO MAINTAIN A HEALTHY BODY WEIGHT. EATING A HEALTHY DIET CAN HELP LOWER PEOPLE'S RISK FOR HEART DISEASE, HIGH BLOOD PRESSURE, DIABETES,OSTEOPOROSIS AND CERTAIN CANCERS, AND ALSO HELPS PEOPLE MAINTAIN A HEALTHY BODY WEIGHT AND PROMOTE A SENSE OF OVERALL HEALTH AND EMOTIONAL WELL-BEING. LIMITING ALCOHOL CONSUMPTION AND NOT USING TOBACCO CAN DRAMATICALLY REDUCE ONE CHANCES OF CONTRACTING HEART DISEASE, DIABETES, AND RESPIRATORY DISEASE AS WELL AS DEPRESSION AND ANXIETY.THERE ARE A BROAD RANGE OF CHRONIC AND INFECTIOUS DISEASES PREVALENT IN NEBH'S CBSA, INCLUDING HEART DISEASE, DIABETES, ASTHMA, HYPERTENSION, CANCER, HIV/AIDS, AND DEPRESSION. ALTHOUGH TREATING THESE ILLNESSES REQUIRES A RANGE OF CLINICAL INTERVENTIONS, THERE IS A GREAT DEAL OF OVERLAP WITH RESPECT TO THE POTENTIAL COMMUNITY INTERVENTIONS. POPULATION-LEVEL RESPONSES TO CHRONIC AND INFECTIOUS ILLNESSES ALL REQUIRE COMMUNITY BASED EDUCATION, SCREENING, TIMELY ACCESS TO TREATMENT AND SEAMLESS COORDINATION OF FOLLOW-UP SERVICES, INCLUDING ACCESS TO WELLNESS ACTIVITIES THAT ADDRESS HEALTH RISK FACTORS.NEBH, IN COLLABORATION WITH PUBLIC HEALTH OFFICIALS, COMMUNITY BASED ORGANIZATIONS AND OTHER CLINICAL PROVIDERS IS ALREADY FULLY ENGAGED ON THESE ISSUES AND NEBH HAS A BROAD RANGE OF EXISTING PROGRAMS THAT WORK TO ADDRESS PREVENTION, SERVICE COORDINATION, IMPROVE FOLLOW-UP CARE, AND ENSURE THAT THOSE WITH CHRONIC AND INFECTIOUS CONDITIONS ARE ENGAGED IN THE SERVICES THEY NEED. HOWEVER, THESE EFFORTS NEED TO BE ENHANCED AND REFINED BASED ON DATA FROM THIS ASSESSMENT. MOVING FORWARD, IT IS CRITICAL THAT THESE ISSUES BE ADDRESSED AND PERFECTED SO THAT NEBH, OTHER CLINICAL PROVIDERS, AND THE BROAD RANGE OF KEY COMMUNITY BASED ORGANIZATIONS CAN WORK COLLABORATIVELY TO ADDRESS COMMUNITY NEED WITH RESPECT TO PHYSICAL, BEHAVIORAL, AND EMOTIONAL HEALTH ISSUES. THE FOLLOWING GOALS AND OBJECTIVES ADDRESS THE EXISTING EDUCATIONAL, ASSESSMENT, CARE COORDINATION, AND ACCESS TO CARE AND SERVICES ISSUES IDENTIFIED THROUGH THE ASSESSMENT PROCESS.A.PROMOTE GENERAL HEALTH AND WELLNESS-TARGET POPULATION: CHILDREN, YOUTH, AND ADULTS-PROGRAMMATIC OBJECTIVES: I.EDUCATE THE PUBLIC ABOUT HEALTH RISK FACTORS, HEALTH PROMOTION, AND BASIC WELLNESS -COMMUNITY ACTIVITIES:I.DECREASE THE NUMBER AND PERCENTAGE OF BOTH ADULTS AND CHILDREN WHO ARE OVERWEIGHT AND OBESE BY EDUCATING AND PROMOTING WELLNESS AND EXERCISE.

NEBH IS UNABLE TO ADDRESS THESE NEEDS DUE TO LIMITED FINANCIAL RESOURCES. IN ADDITION, THE HOSPITAL IS AN ORTHOPEDIC SPECIALTY-REFERRAL HOSPITAL FOR THE NEW ENGLAND REGION. IT IS NOT A FULL-SERVICE COMMUNITY HOSPITAL. BECAUSE OF THIS, AND TO AVOID DUPLICATION OF SERVICES, THE HOSPITAL IDENTIFIED RESOURCES AND STRENGTHS IN ITS SPECIALTY AREAS WHEN DETERMINING ITS PRIORITIES IN ITS IMPLEMENTATION STRATEGY/PLAN.

AS DEMONSTRATED IN THIS SCHEDULE H, DURING THE PERIOD COVERED BY THIS FILING, 4.1% OF THE NEBH'S TOTAL EXPENSES WERE INCURRED IN PROVIDING FINANCIAL ASSISTANCE AND CERTAIN OTHER COMMUNITY BENEFITS AT COST. IN ADDITION AS NOTED IN THE NARRATIVE BELOW, THERE ARE ADDITIONAL ACTIVITIES AND EXPENDITURES WHICH NEBH CONSIDERS FINANCIAL ASSISTANCE AND COMMUNITY BENEFITS. UNDER THE INSTRUCTIONS TO THIS SCHEDULE H QUESTION 7 THESE ITEMS ARE NOT QUANTIFIED IN SCHEDULE H QUESTION 7, BUT IT IS WORTH NOTING THAT IF NEBH HAD INCLUDED THESE IN SCHEDULE H QUESTION 7, THE FINANCIAL ASSISTANCE AND CERTAIN OTHER COMMUNITY BENEFITS AT COST WOULD BE 11.71% FOR THE PERIOD COVERED BY THIS FILING.

THE MASSACHUSETTS HEALTH REFORM LAW PROVIDED AN INITIATIVE FOR EXPANSION OF MEDICAID COVERAGE TO GREATER POPULATIONS AND FOR ENROLLMENT OF UNINSURED PATIENTS IN OTHER INSURANCE PROGRAMS. PAYMENTS FROM MEDICAID AND OTHER PROGRAMS WHICH INSURE LOW INCOME POPULATIONS DO NOT COVER THE COST OF SERVICES PROVIDED. DURING THE FISCAL PERIOD COVERED BY THIS FILING, NEBH COLLECTED $1,125,647 IN MEDICAID REVENUE WHICH WAS LESS THAN THE COST OF CARE PROVIDED BY NEBH FOR SUCH SERVICES BY $772,851 AS REPORTED ON THIS SCHEDULE H, PART I, LINE 7B. MEDICARE IS THE FEDERALLY SPONSORED HEALTH INSURANCE PROGRAM FOR ELDERLY OR DISABLED PATIENTS, AND THE HOSPITAL PROVIDES CARE TO PATIENTS WHO PARTICIPATE IN THE MEDICARE PROGRAM. DURING THE FISCAL PERIOD COVERED BY THIS FILING, 35.36% OR 44,617 OF NEBH'S PATIENT ENCOUNTERS WERE WITH MEDICARE PATIENTS. THIS TRANSLATED TO MEDICARE REVENUE OF $71,485,789. HOWEVER, BECAUSE PAYMENTS TO HOSPITALS THROUGH THIS GOVERNMENT SPONSORED PROGRAM HAVE NOT KEPT PACE WITH INFLATION, REVENUE COLLECTED WAS LESS THAN THE COST OF SERVICES BY $17,990,558. OF THIS AMOUNT, $326,475 IS INCLUDED IN FORM 990 SCHEDULE H PART I, LINE 7G AND RELATED TO THE PROVISION OF SUBSIDIZED HEALTH SERVICES FOR PROVIDING CASTS AND MRSA TEST TO PATIENTS.

IN 2014, MARYLAND'S WAIVER WITH MEDICARE WAS RENEGOTIATED AND UPDATED TO REFLECT THE CURRENT HEALTHCARE ENVIRONMENT. UNDER THIS NEW WAIVER, SEVERAL CRITERIA WERE ESTABLISHED TO MONITOR THE SUCCESS OF THE SYSTEM IN CONTROLLING HEALTHCARE COSTS AND THE CONTINUANCE OF THE WAIVER ITSELF: 1. REVENUE GROWTH PER CAPITA 2. MEDICARE HOSPITAL REVENUE PER BENEFICIARY 3. MEDICARE ALL PROVIDER REVENUE GROWTH PER BENEFICIARY 4. MEDICARE READMISSION RATES 5.

AN ESTIMATED PROVISION FOR BAD DEBTS IS RECORDED IN THE PERIOD THE RELATED SERVICES ARE PROVIDED BASED UPON ANTICIPATED UNCOMPENSATED CARE, AND IS ADJUSTED AS ADDITIONAL INFORMATION BECOMES AVAILABLE. THE PROVISION FOR BAD DEBTS IS BASED UPON MANAGEMENT'S ASSESSMENT OF HISTORICAL AND EXPECTED NET COLLECTIONS CONSIDERING HISTORICAL BUSINESS AND ECONOMIC CONDITIONS, TRENDS IN HEALTHCARE COVERAGE, AND OTHER COLLECTION INDICATORS. PERIODICALLY THROUGHOUT THE YEAR, MANAGEMENT ASSESSES THE ADEQUACY OF THE ALLOWANCE FOR UNCOLLECTIBLE ACCOUNTS BASED UPON HISTORICAL WRITE-OFF EXPERIENCE BY PAYOR CATEGORY. THE RESULTS OF THIS REVIEW ARE THEN USED TO MAKE MODIFICATIONS TO THE PROVISION FOR BAD DEBTS AND TO ESTABLISH AN ALLOWANCE FOR UNCOLLECTIBLE RECEIVABLES. AFTER COLLECTION OF AMOUNTS DUE FROM INSURERS, THE CORPORATION FOLLOWS INTERNAL GUIDELINES FOR PLACING CERTAIN PAST DUE BALANCES WITH COLLECTION AGENCIES. FOR RECEIVABLES ASSOCIATED WITH SERVICES PROVIDED TO PATIENTS WHO HAVE THIRD-PARTY COVERAGE, THE CORPORATION ANALYZES CONTRACTUALLY DUE AMOUNTS AND PROVIDES AN ALLOWANCE FOR BAD DEBTS, ALLOWANCE FOR CONTRACTUAL ADJUSTMENTS, PROVISION FOR BAD DEBTS, AND CONTRACTUAL ADJUSTMENTS ON ACCOUNTS FOR WHICH THE THIRD-PARTY PAYOR HAS NOT YET PAID OR FOR PAYORS WHO ARE KNOWN TO BE HAVING FINANCIAL DIFFICULTIES THAT MAKE THE REALIZATION OF AMOUNTS DUE UNLIKELY. FOR RECEIVABLES ASSOCIATED WITH SELF-PAY PATIENTS OR WITH BALANCES REMAINING AFTER THE THIRD-PARTY COVERAGE HAD ALREADY PAID, THE CORPORATION RECORDS A SIGNIFICANT PROVISION FOR BAD DEBTS IN THE PERIOD OF SERVICE ON THE BASIS OF ITS HISTOrICAL COLLECTIONS, WHICH INDICATES THAT MANY PATIENTS ULTIMATELY DO NOT PAY THE PORTION OF THEIR BILL FOR WHICH THEY ARE FINANCIALLY RESPONSIBLE. THE DIFFERENCE BETWEEN THE DISCOUNTED RATES AND THE AMOUNTS COLLECTED AFTER ALL REASONABLE COLLECTION EFFORTS HAVE BEEN EXHAUSTED IS CHARGED AGAINST THE ALLOWANCE FOR DOUBTFUL ACCOUNTS."

Training materials were revised, new scripting was developed, and training sessions were held for applicable Revenue Cycle employees which required competency sign-off for those who completed the training. Procedures initially implemented included offering a copy of the plain language summary (PLS) to patients as part of the intake process. Individuals were notified about the Financial Assistance Policy (FAP) by receiving a conspicuous written notice about the FAP on their billing statements, and via conspicuous public displays or other measures reasonably calculated to attract patients' attention. As a result of an annual internal review, it was determined that the PLS of Mercy Health's Healthcare FAP was not being offered to all patients at intake during 2018. Immediately upon recognition of the minor oversight, Mercy Health began taking steps to offer a copy of the PLS to all patients who visit the hospital facilities by adding scripting to notify patients of the availability of financial assistance and offering a copy of the PLS to the patient intake process. In addition, Mercy added new language to the Consent for Treatment, Payment, and Health Care Operations (Consent) form required to be signed by all patients, including a copy of the PLS attached as an addendum to the Consent to certify that the patient is aware of Mercy Health's FAP and a copy of the PLS was offered. Additional training has also been provided to all applicable staff. Mercy Health widely publicized its FAP, the FAP Application, and the PLS on the organization's website, includes a conspicuous written notice about the FAP on patients' billing statements, posts conspicuous public displays in the Emergency Department and Registration areas of the hospitals, and notifies members of the community about availability of the FAP. Mercy Health will continue to perform an internal audit on a regular and continuous basis at least once per year to ensure compliance. We do not believe the minor oversight to be considered ""willful or egregious"" and Mercy Health has performed internal research to identify how the minor oversight occurred and taken additional steps to ensure compliance going forward."

201933159349302223,310785684,"Schedule H, Part III, Line 2 Bad debt expense - methodology used to estimate amount","The provision for bad debts is based upon management's assessment of historical and expected net collections considering historical business and economic conditions, trends in health care coverage, and other collection indicators. Net patient accounts are reduced by an allowance for doubtful receivables based upon the hospital's historical collection experience adjusted for current environmental risks and trends for each major payor source. Significant provision is made for self-pay patient accounts in the period of service based on past collection experience. The hospital's concentration of credit risk related to net patient accounts is limited due to the diversity of patients and payors. Net patient accounts consist of amounts due from governmental programs (primarily Medicare and Medicaid), private insurance companies, managed care programs and patients themselves. Net patient service revenue for services provided to patients who have third-party payor coverage is recognized based on contractual rates for services rendered. The hospital recognizes a significant amount of patient service revenue at the time services are rendered even though it does not assess the patient's ability to pay. As a result, the provision for bad debts is presented as a deduction from patient service revenue (net of contractual provisions and discounts). Amounts recognized are subject to adjustment upon review by third-party payors. For uninsured patients that do not qualify for charity care, the hospital recognizes revenue when services are provided. Based on historical experience, a significant portion of the hospital's uninsured patients will be unable or unwilling to pay for services provided. Thus, the hospital records a significant provision for bad debts related to uninsured patients in the period the services are provided. Any discounts applied to self-pay patients would be deemed either Charity or a contractual adjustment. Bad debt would be based on the balance after the charity or contractual adjustment that is deemed uncollectable following a reasonable collection effort."

FOR RECEIVABLES ASSOCIATED WITH SELF-PAY PATIENTS, THE MEDICAL CENTER RECORDS A SIGNIFICANT PROVISION FOR BAD DEBTS ON THE BASIS OF ITS PAST EXPERIENCE, WHICH INDICATES THAT MANY PATIENTS ARE UNABLE OR UNWILLING TO PAY THE PORTION OF THEIR BILL FOR WHICH THEY ARE FINANCIALLY RESPONSIBLE. THE DIFFERENCE BETWEEN THE BILLED RATES AND THE AMOUNTS ACTUALLY COLLECTED AFTER ALL REASONABLE INTERNAL COLLECTION EFFORTS HAVE BEEN EXHAUSTED IS CHARGED OFF AGAINST THE ALLOWANCE FOR DOUBTFUL ACCOUNTS. UNCOMPENSATED CARE ------------------ THE MEDICAL CENTER PROVIDES CHARITY CARE TO PATIENTS WHO MEET CERTAIN FINANCIAL CRITERIA ESTABLISHED BY THE STATE OF NEW JERSEY. THE DIRECT AND INDIRECT COST OF SERVICES AND SUPPLIES FURNISHED TO PATIENTS ELIGIBLE FOR SUCH CHARITY CARE, USING A RATIO OF COST TO GROSS CHARGES, APPROXIMATED $1,623,000 AND $1,561,000 FOR THE YEARS ENDED DECEMBER 31, 2017 AND 2016, RESPECTIVELY. GROSS CHARGES FORGONE RELATED TO CHARITY CARE SERVICES AMOUNTED TO APPROXIMATELY $9,960,000 AND $8,917,000 FOR THE YEARS ENDED DECEMBER 31, 2017 AND 2016, RESPECTIVELY. THE MEDICAL CENTER'S PATIENT ACCEPTANCE POLICY IS BASED ON ITS MISSION STATEMENT AND ITS CHARITABLE PURPOSES. ACCORDINGLY, THE MEDICAL CENTER ACCEPTS ALL PATIENTS REGARDLESS OF THEIR ABILITY TO PAY. THIS POLICY RESULTS IN THE ASSUMPTION OF HIGHER-THAN-NORMAL PATIENT ACCOUNTS RECEIVABLE CREDIT RISKS. TO THE EXTENT THE MEDICAL CENTER REALIZES ADDITIONAL LOSSES RESULTING FROM SUCH HIGHER CREDIT RISK FOR PATIENTS THAT ARE NOT IDENTIFIED OR DO NOT MEET THE PREVIOUSLY DESCRIBED CHARITY DEFINITION, SUCH ADDITIONAL LOSSES ARE INCLUDED IN THE PROVISION FOR BAD DEBTS. ADDITIONALLY, THE MEDICAL CENTER SPONSORS CERTAIN OTHER CHARITABLE PROGRAMS, WHICH PROVIDE SUBSTANTIAL BENEFIT TO THE BROADER COMMUNITY. SUCH PROGRAMS INCLUDE SERVICES TO NEEDY AND ELDERLY POPULATIONS THAT REQUIRE SPECIAL SUPPORT, AS WELL AS HEALTH PROMOTION AND EDUCATION FOR THE GENERAL COMMUNITY WELFARE. THE HEALTH CARE REFORM ACT OF 1992, CHAPTER 160, ESTABLISHED THE HEALTH CARE SUBSIDY FUND TO PROVIDE A MECHANISM AND FUNDING SOURCE TO COMPENSATE HOSPITALS FOR CHARITY CARE. THE MEDICAL CENTER RECEIVED APPROXIMATELY $206,000 AND $518,000 FOR CHARITY CARE, WHICH IS INCLUDED IN NET PATIENT SERVICE REVENUE FOR THE YEARS ENDED DECEMBER 31, 2017 AND 2016, RESPECTIVELY. THE HEALTH CARE SUBSIDY FUND AMOUNTS ARE SUBJECT TO CHANGE FROM YEAR TO YEAR BASED ON AVAILABLE STATE BUDGET AMOUNTS AND ALLOCATION METHODOLOGIES."
201843199349301564,210662542,"SCHEDULE H, PART III, LINE 8","MEDICARE COSTS WERE DERIVED FROM THE 2017 MEDICARE COST REPORT. MEDICARE UNDERPAYMENTS AND BAD DEBT ARE COMMUNITY BENEFIT AND ASSOCIATED COSTS ARE INCLUDABLE ON THE FORM 990, SCHEDULE H, PART I. THE ORGANIZATION BELIEVES THAT MEDICARE UNDERPAYMENTS (SHORTFALL) AND BAD DEBT ARE COMMUNITY BENEFIT AND ASSOCIATED COSTS ARE INCLUDABLE ON THE FORM 990, SCHEDULE H, PART I. AS OUTLINED MORE FULLY BELOW, THE ORGANIZATION BELIEVES THAT THESE SERVICES AND RELATED COSTS PROMOTE THE HEALTH OF THE COMMUNITY AS A WHOLE AND ARE RENDERED IN CONJUNCTION WITH THE ORGANIZATION'S CHARITABLE TAX-EXEMPT PURPOSES AND MISSION IN PROVIDING MEDICALLY NECESSARY HEALTHCARE SERVICES TO ALL INDIVIDUALS IN A NON-DISCRIMINATORY MANNER WITHOUT REGARD TO RACE, COLOR, CREED, SEX, NATIONAL ORIGIN, RELIGION OR ABILITY TO PAY AND CONSISTENT WITH THE COMMUNITY BENEFIT STANDARD PROMULGATED BY THE INTERNAL REVENUE SERVICE (""IRS""). THE COMMUNITY BENEFIT STANDARD IS THE CURRENT STANDARD FOR A HOSPITAL FOR RECOGNITION AS A TAX-EXEMPT AND CHARITABLE ORGANIZATION UNDER INTERNAL REVENUE CODE (""IRC"") 501(C)(3). THE ORGANIZATION IS RECOGNIZED AS A TAX-EXEMPT ENTITY AND CHARITABLE ORGANIZATION UNDER 501(C)(3) OF THE IRC. ALTHOUGH THERE IS NO DEFINITION IN THE TAX CODE FOR THE TERM ""CHARITABLE"" A REGULATION PROMULGATED BY THE DEPARTMENT OF THE TREASURY PROVIDES SOME GUIDANCE AND STATES THAT ""THE TERM CHARITABLE IS USED IN 501(C)(3) IN ITS GENERALLY ACCEPTED LEGAL SENSE,PROVIDES EXAMPLES OF CHARITABLE PURPOSES, INCLUDING THE RELIEF OF THE POOR OR UNPRIVILEGED; THE PROMOTION OF SOCIAL WELFARE; AND THE ADVANCEMENT OF EDUCATION, RELIGION, AND SCIENCE. NOTE IT DOES NOT EXPLICITLY ADDRESS THE ACTIVITIES OF HOSPITALS. IN THE ABSENCE OF EXPLICIT STATUTORY OR REGULATORY REQUIREMENTS APPLYING THE TERM ""CHARITABLE"" TO HOSPITALS, IT HAS BEEN LEFT TO THE IRS TO DETERMINE THE CRITERIA HOSPITALS MUST MEET TO QUALIFY AS IRC 501(C)(3) CHARITABLE ORGANIZATIONS. THE ORIGINAL STANDARD WAS KNOWN AS THE CHARITY CARE STANDARD. THIS STANDARD WAS REPLACED BY THE IRS WITH THE COMMUNITY BENEFIT STANDARD WHICH IS THE CURRENT STANDARD. CHARITY CARE STANDARD IN 1956, THE IRS ISSUED REVENUE RULING 56-185, WHICH ADDRESSED THE REQUIREMENTS HOSPITALS NEEDED TO MEET IN ORDER TO QUALIFY FOR IRC 501(C)(3) STATUS. ONE OF THESE REQUIREMENTS IS KNOWN AS THE ""CHARITY CARE STANDARD."" UNDER THE STANDARD, A HOSPITAL HAD TO PROVIDE, TO THE EXTENT OF ITS FINANCIAL ABILITY, FREE OR REDUCED-COST CARE TO PATIENTS UNABLE TO PAY FOR IT. A HOSPITAL THAT EXPECTED FULL PAYMENT DID NOT, ACCORDING TO THE RULING, PROVIDE CHARITY CARE BASED ON THE FACT THAT SOME PATIENTS ULTIMATELY FAILED TO PAY. THE RULING EMPHASIZED THAT A LOW LEVEL OF CHARITY CARE DID NOT NECESSARILY MEAN THAT A HOSPITAL HAD FAILED TO MEET THE REQUIREMENT SINCE THAT LEVEL COULD REFLECT ITS FINANCIAL ABILITY TO PROVIDE SUCH CARE. THE RULING ALSO NOTED THAT PUBLICLY SUPPORTED COMMUNITY HOSPITALS WOULD NORMALLY QUALIFY AS CHARITABLE ORGANIZATIONS BECAUSE THEY SERVE THE ENTIRE COMMUNITY, AND A LOW LEVEL OF CHARITY CARE WOULD NOT AFFECT A HOSPITAL'S EXEMPT STATUS IF IT WAS DUE TO THE SURROUNDING COMMUNITY'S LACK OF CHARITABLE DEMANDS. COMMUNITY BENEFIT STANDARD IN 1969, THE IRS ISSUED REVENUE RULING 69-545, WHICH ""REMOVED"" FROM REVENUE RULING 56-185 ""THE REQUIREMENTS RELATING TO CARING FOR PATIENTS WITHOUT CHARGE OR AT RATES BELOW COST."" UNDER THE STANDARD DEVELOPED IN REVENUE RULING 69-545, WHICH IS KNOWN AS THE ""COMMUNITY BENEFIT STANDARD,"" HOSPITALS ARE JUDGED ON WHETHER THEY PROMOTE THE HEALTH OF A BROAD CLASS OF INDIVIDUALS IN THE COMMUNITY. THE RULING INVOLVED A HOSPITAL THAT ONLY ADMITTED INDIVIDUALS WHO COULD PAY FOR THE SERVICES (BY THEMSELVES, PRIVATE INSURANCE, OR PUBLIC PROGRAMS SUCH AS MEDICARE), BUT OPERATED A FULL-TIME EMERGENCY ROOM THAT WAS OPEN TO EVERYONE. THE IRS RULED THAT THE HOSPITAL QUALIFIED AS A CHARITABLE ORGANIZATION BECAUSE IT PROMOTED THE HEALTH OF PEOPLE IN ITS COMMUNITY. THE IRS REASONED THAT BECAUSE THE PROMOTION OF HEALTH WAS A CHARITABLE PURPOSE ACCORDING TO THE GENERAL LAW OF CHARITY, IT FELL WITHIN THE ""GENERALLY ACCEPTED LEGAL SENSE"" OF THE TERM ""CHARITABLE,"" AS REQUIRED BY TREAS. REG. 1.501(C)(3)-1(D)(2). THE IRS RULING STATED THAT THE PROMOTION OF HEALTH, LIKE THE RELIEF OF POVERTY AND THE ADVANCEMENT OF EDUCATION AND RELIGION, IS ONE OF THE PURPOSES IN THE GENERAL LAW OF CHARITY THAT IS DEEMED BENEFICIAL TO THE COMMUNITY AS A WHOLE EVEN THOUGH THE CLASS OF BENEFICIARIES ELIGIBLE TO RECEIVE A DIRECT BENEFIT FROM ITS ACTIVITIES DOES NOT INCLUDE ALL MEMBERS OF THE COMMUNITY, SUCH AS INDIGENT MEMBERS OF THE COMMUNITY, PROVIDED THAT THE CLASS IS NOT SO SMALL THAT ITS RELIEF IS NOT OF BENEFIT TO THE COMMUNITY. THE IRS CONCLUDED THAT THE HOSPITAL WAS ""PROMOTING THE HEALTH OF A CLASS OF PERSONS THAT IS BROAD ENOUGH TO BENEFIT THE COMMUNITY"" BECAUSE ITS EMERGENCY DEPARTMENT WAS OPEN TO ALL AND IT PROVIDED CARE TO EVERYONE WHO COULD PAY, WHETHER DIRECTLY OR THROUGH THIRD-PARTY REIMBURSEMENT. OTHER CHARACTERISTICS OF THE HOSPITAL THAT THE IRS HIGHLIGHTED INCLUDED THE FOLLOWING: IT WAS CONTROLLED BY A BOARD OF TRUSTEES THAT CONSISTED OF INDEPENDENT CIVIC LEADERS; HOSPITAL MEDICAL STAFF PRIVILEGES WERE AVAILABLE TO ALL QUALIFIED PHYSICIANS; AND SURPLUS FUNDS ARE USED TO IMPROVE THE QUALITY OF PATIENT CARE, EXPAND AND RENOVATE HOSPITAL FACILITIES AND ADVANCE MEDICAL CARE, TRAINING, EDUCATION, RESEARCH, PROGRAMS AND ACTIVITIES. MEDICARE UNDERPAYMENTS AND BAD DEBT ARE COMMUNITY BENEFIT AND ASSOCIATED COSTS ARE INCLUDABLE ON THE FORM 990, SCHEDULE H, PART I. THE AMERICAN HOSPITAL ASSOCIATION (""AHA"") BELIEVES THAT MEDICARE UNDERPAYMENTS (SHORTFALL) AND BAD DEBT ARE COMMUNITY BENEFIT AND THUS INCLUDABLE ON THE FORM 990, SCHEDULE H, PART I. THIS ORGANIZATION AGREES WITH THE AHA POSITION. AS OUTLINED IN THE AHA LETTER TO THE IRS DATED AUGUST 21, 2007 WITH RESPECT TO THE FIRST PUBLISHED DRAFT OF THE NEW FORM 990 AND SCHEDULE H, THE AHA FELT THAT THE IRS SHOULD INCORPORATE THE FULL VALUE OF THE COMMUNITY BENEFIT THAT HOSPITALS PROVIDE BY COUNTING MEDICARE UNDERPAYMENTS (SHORTFALL) AS QUANTIFIABLE COMMUNITY BENEFIT FOR THE FOLLOWING REASONS: - PROVIDING CARE FOR THE ELDERLY AND SERVING MEDICARE PATIENTS IS AN ESSENTIAL PART OF THE COMMUNITY BENEFIT STANDARD. - MEDICARE, LIKE MEDICAID, DOES NOT PAY THE FULL COST OF CARE. RECENTLY, MEDICARE REIMBURSES HOSPITALS ONLY 88 CENTS FOR EVERY DOLLAR THEY SPEND TO TAKE CARE OF MEDICARE PATIENTS. - MANY MEDICARE BENEFICIARIES, LIKE THEIR MEDICAID COUNTERPARTS, ARE POOR. MORE THAN 46 PERCENT OF MEDICARE SPENDING IS FOR BENEFICIARIES WHOSE INCOME IS BELOW 200 PERCENT OF THE FEDERAL POVERTY LEVEL. MANY OF THOSE MEDICARE BENEFICIARIES ARE ALSO ELIGIBLE FOR MEDICAID -- SO CALLED ELIGIBLES."" THERE IS EVERY COMPELLING PUBLIC POLICY REASON TO TREAT MEDICARE AND MEDICAID UNDERPAYMENTS SIMILARLY FOR PURPOSES OF A HOSPITAL'S COMMUNITY BENEFIT AND INCLUDE THESE COSTS ON FORM 990, SCHEDULE H, PART I. MEDICARE UNDERPAYMENT MUST BE SHOULDERED BY THE HOSPITAL IN ORDER TO CONTINUE TREATING THE COMMUNITY'S ELDERLY AND POOR. THESE UNDERPAYMENTS REPRESENT A REAL COST OF SERVING THE COMMUNITY AND SHOULD COUNT AS A QUANTIFIABLE COMMUNITY BENEFIT. BOTH THE AHA AND THIS ORGANIZATION ALSO BELIEVE THAT PATIENT BAD DEBT IS A COMMUNITY BENEFIT AND THUS INCLUDABLE ON THE FORM 990, SCHEDULE H, PART I. LIKE MEDICARE UNDERPAYMENT (SHORTFALLS), THERE ALSO ARE COMPELLING REASONS THAT PATIENT BAD DEBT SHOULD BE COUNTED AS QUANTIFIABLE COMMUNITY BENEFIT AS FOLLOWS: - A SIGNIFICANT MAJORITY OF BAD DEBT IS ATTRIBUTABLE TO LOW-INCOME PATIENTS, WHO, FOR MANY REASONS, DECLINE TO COMPLETE THE FORMS REQUIRED TO ESTABLISH ELIGIBILITY FOR HOSPITALS' CHARITY CARE OR FINANCIAL ASSISTANCE PROGRAMS. A 2006 CONGRESSIONAL BUDGET OFFICE (""CBO"") REPORT, NONPROFIT HOSPITALS AND THE PROVISION OF COMMUNITY BENEFITS, CITED TWO STUDIES INDICATING THAT ""THE GREAT MAJORITY OF BAD DEBT WAS ATTRIBUTABLE TO PATIENTS WITH INCOMES BELOW 200% OF THE FEDERAL POVERTY LINE."" - THE REPORT ALSO NOTED THAT A SUBSTANTIAL PORTION OF BAD DEBT IS PENDING CHARITY CARE. UNLIKE BAD DEBT IN OTHER INDUSTRIES, HOSPITAL BAD DEBT IS COMPLICATED BY THE FACT THAT HOSPITALS FOLLOW THEIR MISSION TO THE COMMUNITY AND TREAT EVERY PATIENT THAT COMES THROUGH THEIR EMERGENCY DEPARTMENT, REGARDLESS OF ABILITY TO PAY. PATIENTS WHO HAVE OUTSTANDING BILLS ARE NOT TURNED AWAY, UNLIKE OTHER INDUSTRIES. BAD DEBT IS FURTHER COMPLICATED BY THE AUDITING INDUSTRY'S STANDARDS ON REPORTING CHARITY CARE. MANY PATIENTS CANNOT OR DO NOT PROVIDE THE NECESSARY, EXTENSIVE DOCUMENTATION REQUIRED TO BE DEEMED CHARITY CARE BY AUDITORS. AS A RESULT, ROUGHLY 40% OF BAD DEBT IS PENDING CHARITY CARE. - THE CBO CONCLUDED THAT ITS FINDINGS ""SUPPORT THE VALIDITY OF THE USE OF UNCOMPENSATED CARE [BAD DEBT AND CHARITY CARE] AS A MEASURE OF COMMUNITY BENEFITS ASSUMING THE FINDINGS ARE GENERALIZABLE NATIONWIDE; THE EXPERIENCE OF HOSPITALS AROUND THE NATION REINFORCES THAT THEY ARE GENERALIZABLE.

A REFERRAL IS MADE TO THE HOSPITAL'S FINANCIAL AID OFFICE AND A FINANCIAL COUNSELOR WILL HELP THE PATIENT APPLY FOR FREE OR LOW-COST INSURANCE. IF THE FINANCIAL COUNSELOR DETERMINES THAT THE PATIENT DOES NOT QUALIFY FOR LOW-COST INSURANCE, THE COUNSELOR WILL HELP THE PATIENT APPLY FOR A FINANCIAL AID DISCOUNT BASED ON INCOME LEVEL. THE HOSPITAL MAKES ITS FINANCIAL AID POLICY KNOWN TO THE PUBLIC BY PROVIDING WRITTEN INFORMATION AVAILABLE IN BOTH ENGLISH AND SPANISH, INCLUDING BROCHURES AT ALL PATIENT SERVICE AREAS, INFORMATION POSTED ON THE INTRANET AND INTERNET, AND INFORMATION SENT OUT ON PATIENTS' BILLS. THERE ARE ALSO SIGNS POSTED AT THE MAIN ENTRANCE TO THE HOSPITAL IN ENGLISH AND SPANISH ADVISING PATIENTS OF THE ROOM LOCATION FOR ASSISTANCE WITH FINANCIAL AID."

RESEARCH HAS CONTINUALLY SHOWN THAT WHEN THE FACTORS INFLUENCING HEALTH ARE EXPLORED, HEALTH CARE ACTUALLY PLAYS THE SMALLEST ROLE PROPORTIONATELY. A REPORT IN THE JOURNAL OF AMERICAN MEDICAL ASSOCIATION AND THE CENTER FOR DISEASE CONTROL (MCGINNIS, 1996) SUGGESTS THAT THE FACTORS IMPACTING HEALTH ARE AS FOLLOWS: LIFESTYLE AND BEHAVIORS, 50%, ENVIRONMENT (HUMAN AND NATURAL), 20%, GENETICS AND HUMAN BIOLOGY, 20%, AND HEALTH CARE, 10%. COMMUNITY BUILDING ACTIVITIES HELP TO ADDRESS THE OTHER INDICATORS OUTSIDE OF THE ROLE TRADITIONALLY PLAYED BY HEALTH-CARE ORGANIZATIONS. THESE ACTIVITIES ARE ALMOST EXCLUSIVELY DONE IN SOME FORM OF PARTNERSHIP IN WHICH THE COMMUNITY OR OTHER ORGANIZATIONS ARE BETTER SUITED TO ADDRESS. HEALTH-CARE ORGANIZATIONS GENERALLY PROVIDE TIMELY AND SPECIFIC RESOURCES TO HELP THESE ISSUES. HEALTH-CARE ORGANIZATIONS CAN BE A RICH AND VALUABLE COMMUNITY RESOURCE IN WAYS NOT TYPICALLY CONSIDERED. OFTEN THE MOST EFFECTIVE WAY TO HELP IMPACT AND IMPROVE THE COMMUNITY HEALTH STATUS IS TO SUPPORT OTHER AGENCIES AND ORGANIZATIONS IN A VARIETY OF WAYS OUTSIDE OF HEALTH SERVICES. THIS IS OFTEN DONE THROUGH CASH OR IN-KIND SERVICES TO SUPPORT OTHER NON-PROFITS, DONATIONS OF DURABLE MEDICAL EQUIPMENT AND SUPPLIES TO CERTAIN AGENCIES, OR THROUGH LEADERSHIP AND EDUCATIONAL EXPERTISE. CENTRAL IOWA HOSPITAL CORPORATION D/B/A UNITYPOINT HEALTH-DES MOINES CONTRIBUTES FINANCIALLY TO A WIDE VARIETY OF COMMUNITY ORGANIZATIONS THAT ADDRESS THE BROADER NEEDS OF THE COMMUNITY. THESE DONATIONS ALLOW OTHER NON-PROFIT ORGANIZATIONS TO FULFILL THEIR MISSIONS TO IMPROVE THE WELL BEING OF THE COMMUNITY AND CONTRIBUTE TO ITS OVERALL HEALTH STATUS IN WAYS THAT MAY DIFFER FROM THE DIRECT SERVICES OF THE HOSPITAL ORGANIZATION. OTHER DONATIONS SUCH AS FOOD OR OTHER DURABLE GOODS PROVIDE AREA SHELTERS AND OTHER ORGANIZATIONS IN THE AREA. THIS ALLOWS THESE ORGANIZATIONS TO MAXIMIZE THE RESOURCES THEY HAVE TO WORK WITH. CENTRAL IOWA HOSPITAL CORPORATION D/B/A UNITYPOINT HEALTH-DES MOINES EMPLOYEES ARE ACTIVE IN EDUCATING PARTNERS ON A WIDE VARIETY OF HEALTH SUBJECTS THAT ADVANCE THEIR WORK.

EXAMPLES OF THESE ITEMS INCLUDE PROVIDER BASED PHYSICIAN EXPENSE, SELF INSURANCE EXPENSE, HOME OFFICE EXPENSE AND THE SHORTFALL FROM FEE SCHEDULE PAYMENTS. THE HOSPITAL BELIEVES THE ENTIRE AMOUNT OF THE MEDICARE SHORTFALL SHOULD BE TREATED AS COMMUNITY BENEFIT, MORE SPECIFICALLY, AS CHARITY CARE. THE ELDERLY CONSTITUTE A CLEARLY-RECOGNIZED CHARITABLE CLASS, AND MANY MEDICARE BENEFICIARIES, LIKE THEIR MEDICAID COUNTERPARTS, ARE POOR AND THUS WOULD HAVE QUALIFIED FOR THE HOSPITAL'S CHARITY CARE PROGRAM, MEDICAID OR OTHER NEEDS-BASED GOVERNMENT PROGRAMS ABSENT THE MEDICARE PROGRAM. BY ACCEPTING PAYMENT BELOW COST TO TREAT THESE INDIVIDUALS, THE BURDENS OF GOVERNMENT ARE RELIEVED WITH RESPECT TO THESE INDIVIDUALS. ADDITIONALLY, THERE IS A SIGNIFICANT POSSIBILITY THAT CONTINUED REDUCTION IN REIMBURSEMENT MAY ACTUALLY CREATE DIFFICULTIES IN ACCESS FOR THESE INDIVIDUALS.

ADDITIONALLY, ELLIS EMPLOYS FINANCIAL ADVOCATES WHO ASSIST PATIENTS IN DETERMINING THE AVAILABILITY OF AND THEIR ELIGIBILITY FOR GOVERNMENT PROGRAMS INCLUDING MEDICAID, SUBSIDIZED INSURANCE PROGRAMS THROUGH THE NEW YORK STATE OF HEALTH EXCHANGE, AND FREE OR LOW-COST CARE THROUGH THE HOSPITAL'S FINANCIAL ASSISTANCE POLICY. THE FINANCIAL ADVOCATES THEN ASSIST PATIENTS WITH COMPLETING THE NEEDED PAPERWORK, INCLUDING BEDSIDE VISITS AS NECESSARY.SINCE 2009, ELLIS MEDICINE HAS INCLUDED AFFIRMATIVE FINANCIAL ASSISTANCE OUTREACH AS PART OF ITS COMMUNITY-BASED POPULATION HEALTH PROGRAMS. INITIALLY, THE INNOVATIVE ""MEDICAL HOME"" AT THE MCCLELLAN CAMPUS WAS INTENDED TO INCREASE ACCESS TO CARE AND PROVIDE HEALTH CARE NAVIGATION SERVICES TO PATIENTS (ESPECIALLY THE UNDERSERVED AND UNINSURED/UNDERINSURED), INCLUDING EDUCATION ABOUT AND ASSISTANCE WITH HEALTH INSURANCE AND FINANCIAL ASSISTANCE SERVICES. SEPARATE ""NAVIGATORS"" AT THIS LOCATION SPECIALIZED IN ""HEALTH CARE NAVIGATION,"" ""COMMUNITY SERVICE NAVIGATION, AND ""INSURANCE NAVIGATION."" EVEN WITH THE MANY CHANGES WHICH HAVE OCCURRED SINCE, AN ENROLLMENT REPRESENTATIVE FROM FIDELIS, THE SECOND-LARGEST NON-PROFIT MEDICAID MANAGED CARE ORGANIZATION SERVING SCHENECTADY COUNTY, CONTINUES TO WORK OUT OF THE SAME OFFICE AT MCCLELLAN.PRIOR TO CREATION OF THE HEALTH INSURANCE ENROLLMENT PROGRAMS BY THE PATIENT PROTECTION AND AFFORDABLE CARE ACT OF 2010 (PPACA), ELLIS OFFERED MEDICAID ENROLLMENT THROUGH EMPLOYEES ""DEPUTIZED"" BY THE SCHENECTADY COUNTY DEPARTMENT OF SOCIAL SERVICES, THROUGH MEDICAID FACILITATED ENROLLERS EMPLOYED BY THE NOT-FOR-PROFIT HEALTH CAPITAL DISTRICT INITIATIVE (HCDI), AND THROUGH FIDELIS, ONE OF NEW YORK'S NOT-FOR-PROFIT MEDICAID MANAGED CARE ORGANIZATIONS.STARTING IN 2013, ELLIS HAS INVITED ON-SITE SERVICES OF HEALTH INSURANCE NAVIGATORS (ALSO KNOWN AS ""IN PERSON ASSISTORS"") FROM ALL FOUR NOT-FOR-PROFIT ORGANIZATIONS (PUBLIC POLICY AND EDUCATION FUND, HEALTHY CAPITAL DISTRICT INITIATIVE, CAPITAL DISTRICT BLACK CHAMBER OF COMMERCE, AND UNIVERSITY AT ALBANY SCHOOL OF SOCIAL WELFARE) DESIGNATED AS SERVING SCHENECTADY COUNTY PURSUANT TO THE PPACA. NAVIGATORS SEE UNINSURED RESIDENTS AT BOTH THE NOTT STREET AND ELLIS MCCLELLAN STREET HEALTH CENTER CAMPUSES, AS WELL AS AT OTHER COMMUNITY LOCATIONS. ELLIS-EMPLOYED FINANCIAL ADVOCATES ALSO COMPLETED STATE-APPROVED TRAINING AND ARE QUALIFIED AS NEW YORK STATE CERTIFIED APPLICATION COUNSELORS (CACS); TRAINED TO HELP PEOPLE ENROLL BOTH IN MEDICAID AS WELL AS IN ""EXCHANGE"" INSURANCE PRODUCTS.AS OF 2016, ELLIS LOCATIONS WHICH PARTICIPATE AS PRACTICE SITES FOR THE NATIONAL HEALTH SERVICE CORPS (NHSC) HAVE DISPLAYED THE HRSA-REQUIRED SIGNAGE REGARDING FREE OR SLIDING-SCALE FEES.

ANOTHER TELEPHONE RESOURCE (518-243-1695) PROVIDES CALLERS WITH ESTIMATES OF THE TOTAL COST OF PROCEDURES AND HOSPITALIZATIONS, AS MORE AND MORE PATIENTS ARE PAYING HIGHER DEDUCTIBLES AND ARE CONCERNED ABOUT THE COST TO THEM OUT-OF-POCKET. THIS IS PARTICULARLY SIGNIFICANT IN ELLIS' PRIMARY SERVICE AREA, AS THE LARGEST LOCAL EMPLOYER HAS CONVERTED TO A HIGH-DEDUCTIBLE HEALTH INSURANCE PLAN FOR MOST OF ITS EMPLOYEES."
201803189349312310,141338428,"PART VI, LINE 4:","FOR THE PURPOSES OF DETERMINING COMMUNITY NEEDS PURSUANT TO THE REQUIREMENTS OF THE PATIENT PROTECTION AND AFFORDABLE CARE ACT OF 2010, ELLIS HOSPITAL DEFINES THE ""COMMUNITY"" IT SERVES AS CONSISTING OF SCHENECTADY COUNTY, INCLUDING THE CITY OF SCHENECTADY AND THE TOWNS OF DUANESBURG, GLENVILLE, PRINCETOWN, NISKAYUNA, AND ROTTERDAM. THERE ARE SEVERAL REASONS FOR THIS DEFINITION:1) THE GEOGRAPHY OF SCHENECTADY COUNTY IS VERY SIMILAR TO THE PRIMARY SERVICE AREA (PSA) OF THE HOSPITAL. ELLIS USES AN INDUSTRY-STANDARD DEFINITION (THE CONTIGUOUS ZIP CODES IN WHICH THE FIRST 60% OF THE HOSPITAL'S INPATIENTS LIVE) TO DETERMINE ITS PSA. ELLIS' PSA CONSISTS OF THE ENTIRE RANGE OF 123NN ZIP CODES (12302, 12303, 12304, 12305, 12306, 12307, 12308, AND 12309), WHICH CONSTITUTES ALL OF THE CITY OF SCHENECTADY AND MOST OF THE POPULATION OF THE REST OF SCHENECTADY COUNTY. (THE DESIGN OF THE ZIP CODE SYSTEM IS NOT ALIGNED WITH COUNTY OR OTHER POLITICAL BOUNDARIES. THE RURAL WESTERNMOST PORTION OF SCHENECTADY COUNTY IS NOT INCLUDED IN THE ZIP CODE-DEFINED PSA DUE TO LOW POPULATION, WHILE CERTAIN AREAS OF ALBANY AND SARATOGA COUNTIES DO FALL WITHIN THE SCHENECTADY ZIP CODES.) ALTHOUGH ELLIS ACTIVELY SERVES PEOPLE WITHIN ITS SECONDARY SERVICE AREA (SSA), THE GEOGRAPHIC BOUNDARIES OF THOSE ADDITIONAL ZIP CODES (THE ADDITIONAL CONTIGUOUS ZIP CODES IN WHICH THE NEXT 20% OF INPATIENTS LIVE, FOR AN APPROXIMATE TOTAL OF 80% OF INPATIENT VOLUME) STRETCH ACROSS FIVE COUNTIES AND INCLUDE PORTIONS OF THE SERVICE AREAS OF AT LEAST SIX OTHER HOSPITALS. RETAINING A FOCUS ON THE SCHENECTADY COMMUNITY WILL PERMIT DEVELOPMENT OF AN ACTIONABLE IMPLEMENTATION PLAN WHICH CAN TARGET COHESIVE POPULATIONS.2) POPULATION AND HEALTH DATA ARE COMMONLY AVAILABLE BY COUNTY. THE NEW YORK STATE DEPARTMENT OF HEALTH AND OTHER STATE GOVERNMENT AGENCIES MAINTAIN DATA BY COUNTY, THE HEALTHY CAPITAL DISTRICT INITIATIVE PROVIDES COMPARISON DATA BY COUNTY WITHIN THE REGION, AND DATA COLLECTED BY THE UNITED STATES CENSUS ARE FREQUENTLY AT THE COUNTY AND CITY LEVEL. ALTHOUGH CONVENIENCE IS NOT IN AND OF ITSELF A REASON TO DEFINE ""COMMUNITY,"" THE AVAILABILITY OF SOLID DATA, INCLUDING BASELINE AND COMPARISON DATA, WILL PROVIDE A BETTER BASIS FOR PLANNING, AND AN EXTERNALLY-VERIFIABLE SOURCE FOR OUTCOME MEASURES.3) ELLIS HAS ESTABLISHED STRONG PARTNERSHIPS WITH OTHER HEALTHCARE AND COMMUNITY SERVICE ORGANIZATIONS WHICH ARE LOCATED IN AND SERVE SCHENECTADY COUNTY. THE ""MEDICAL HOME GROUP,"" A LOOSE AFFILIATION OF COMMUNITY ORGANIZATIONS CREATED AT THE TIME OF THE THREE-HOSPITAL CONSOLIDATION IN 2008, HAS EVOLVED INTO THE SCHENECTADY COALITION FOR A HEALTHY COMMUNITY; OVER 60 COMMUNITY GROUPS INCLUDING BUSINESSES, LOCAL GOVERNMENT AGENCIES, HEALTHCARE AND SOCIAL SERVICES PROVIDERS AND COMMUNITY AGENCIES, FAITH-BASED ORGANIZATIONS, AND ADVOCACY GROUPS WHOSE LEADERS MEET QUARTERLY AT ELLIS. BY FOCUSING ""COMMUNITY"" ON A POPULATION WELL-SERVED BY A COORDINATED ARRAY OF PHYSICAL HEALTH, BEHAVIORAL HEALTH, AND COMMUNITY SERVICE ORGANIZATIONS IN COORDINATION WITH STRONG LOCAL GOVERNMENT AGENCIES, A COMMUNITY-WIDE ACTION PLAN CAN LEVERAGE THE HOSPITAL'S IMPLEMENTATION PLAN THROUGH THE EFFICIENT AND EFFECTIVE USE OF MULTIPLE RESOURCES.4) SELECTION OF SCHENECTADY COUNTY AS THE ""COMMUNITY"" IS CONSISTENT WITH REGULATORY REQUIREMENTS TO ASSURE INCLUSION OF ""MEDICALLY UNDERSERVED, LOW-INCOME, OR MINORITY POPULATIONS,"" AS THESE POPULATIONS REPRESENT A GREATER SHARE OF THE POPULATION IN SCHENECTADY COUNTY THAN THEY WOULD IF DIFFUSED AMONG THE FIVE COUNTIES OF THE SECONDARY SERVICE AREA.SCHENECTADY COUNTY (2017 ESTIMATED POPULATION: 155,565) IS, GEOGRAPHICALLY, THE SECOND SMALLEST COUNTY IN UPSTATE NEW YORK. IT CONSISTS OF FIVE TOWNS, TWO PRIMARILY RURAL AND THREE PRIMARILY SUBURBAN, SURROUNDING THE CENTRALLY-LOCATED CITY OF SCHENECTADY (2017 ESTIMATED POPULATION: 65,625). THE COUNTY IS LOCATED IMMEDIATELY WEST OF THE STATE CAPITAL OF ALBANY AND MANY OF ITS RESIDENTS COMMUTE TO JOBS IN ALBANY AND THE OTHER COUNTIES COMPRISING NEW YORK'S CAPITAL REGION.SCHENECTADY COUNTY PUBLIC HEALTH SERVICES (SCPHS), A UNIT OF COUNTY GOVERNMENT, IS RESPONSIBLE FOR ALL PUBLIC HEALTH AND ENVIRONMENTAL HEALTH ACTIVITIES AND ENFORCEMENT THROUGHOUT THE CITY AND COUNTY. THE COUNTY CONTAINS A SINGLE NON-PROFIT ACUTE CARE HOSPITAL - ELLIS HOSPITAL (ALSO KNOWN BY THE TRADE NAME ELLIS MEDICINE), AND A SINGLE FEDERALLY QUALIFIED HEALTH CENTER (FQHC) - SCHENECTADY FAMILY HEALTH SERVICES D/B/A HOMETOWN HEALTH CENTER. THERE IS ALSO A NON-PROFIT SPECIALTY HOSPITAL (SUNNYVIEW REHABILITATION HOSPITAL) WHICH IS A MEMBER OF THE ALBANY-BASED ST. PETER'S HEALTH PARTNERS SYSTEM. THERE IS ONE MEDICALLY UNDERSERVED POPULATION; THE HOMEBOUND POPULATION OF SCHENECTADY COUNTY (ID #06211). THE ENTIRE CITY OF SCHENECTADY IS DESIGNATED A HEALTH PROFESSIONS SHORTAGE AREA (HPSA) FOR THE MEDICAID POPULATION FOR MENTAL HEALTH AND DENTAL HEALTH. IN ADDITION, EIGHT CENSUS TRACTS IN THE HAMILTON HILL/MONT PLEASANT NEIGHBORHOODS, WHICH ARE IMMEDIATELY ADJACENT TO THE ELLIS MCCLELLAN STREET HEALTH CENTER, ARE DESIGNATED HEALTH PROFESSIONS SHORTAGE AREAS FOR THE MEDICAID POPULATION FOR PRIMARY CARE. HOMETOWN HEALTH CENTER, THE ELLIS DENTAL HEALTH CENTER, AND THE ELLIS OUTPATIENT MENTAL HEALTH CLINIC HAVE BEEN DESIGNATED BY HRSA AS NATIONAL HEALTH SERVICE CORPS PRACTICE SITES.SCHENECTADY COUNTY IS DIRECTLY SERVED BY ONE DSRIP PERFORMING PROVIDER SYSTEM (PPS), THE ALLIANCE FOR BETTER HEALTH (AFBH), AND IS ADJACENT TO THE SERVICE AREA OF THE ALBANY MEDICAL CENTER PPS.RESIDENTS OF THE CITY OF SCHENECTADY ARE GENERALLY LESS AFFLUENT AND LESS HEALTHY THAN RESIDENTS OF THE SURROUNDING TOWNS, WHILE RESIDENTS OF THE COUNTY AS A WHOLE ARE LESS AFFLUENT THAN THE STATE AS A WHOLE, HOWEVER THE COUNTY'S POVERTY RATE IS BELOW THAT OF THE STATE (SEE FIGURE 1). FOR EXAMPLE, THE MEDIAN HOUSEHOLD INCOME FOR THE CITY IS ONLY ABOUT TWO-THIRDS THAT OF THE COUNTY AS A WHOLE, WHICH IS BELOW THAT OF THE STATE. THE POVERTY RATE (2014 DATA) IN THE CITY (23.8%) IS NEARLY DOUBLE THAT OF THE COUNTY AS A WHOLE (13.2%). STATE HEALTH DEPARTMENT DATA (2008-09) SHOW THAT HOSPITALIZATIONS FOR CONDITIONS WHICH COULD HAVE BEEN TREATED IN THE COMMUNITY (""PREVENTION QUALITY INDICATORS"") RANGE AS HIGH AS 202% OF THE EXPECTED RATE IN CERTAIN CITY NEIGHBORHOODS, BUT ARE AS LOW AS 49% OF THE EXPECTED RATE IN THE RURAL TOWNS. IN ONE DRAMATIC DISPARITY, HOSPITALIZATIONS FOR CONDITIONS RELATED TO DIABETES RANGE FROM 604/100,000 IN THE CITY'S HAMILTON HILL NEIGHBORHOOD (12307) TO 62/100,000 IN THE NEARBY SUBURB OF NISKAYUNA (12309).A SIGNIFICANT MINORITY POPULATION IN THE CITY OF SCHENECTADY IS COMPRISED OF GUYANESE OF WEST INDIAN DESCENT. THE RESULT OF SECONDARY MIGRATION FROM NEW YORK CITY PROMOTED BY A PREVIOUS MAYOR ALONG WITH PRIMARY MIGRATION FROM GUYANA, THE INFLUX IS CREDITED WITH REVERSING YEARS OF POPULATION DECLINE IN THE CITY. SCHENECTADY COUNTY PUBLIC HEALTH SERVICES LED MULTIPLE INITIATIVES TO IDENTIFY AND ADDRESS HEALTH DISPARITIES RELATING TO THE WEST INDIAN POPULATION. RESEARCH CONDUCTED BY PHYSICIANS AT ELLIS MEDICINE REVEALED SPECIFIC HEALTH ISSUES REGARDING THE WEST INDIAN POPULATION. IN PARTICULAR, THE UNEXPECTED PREVALENCE OF DIABETES AMONG NON-OBESE GUYANESE MALES IS THE SUBJECT OF JOURNAL ARTICLES (SEE FOR EXAMPLE: HOSLER, PRATT, SEN, BUCKENMEYER, SIMAO, BACK, SAVADATTI, KAHN, HUNT, ""HIGH PREVALENCE OF DIABETES AMONG INDO-GUYANESE ADULTS, SCHENECTADY, NEW YORK,"" PREVENTING CHRONIC DISEASE 2013; 10:120211) AND HELPED LEAD TO AWARDING OF A FEDERAL RACIAL AND ETHNIC APPROACHES TO COMMUNITY HEALTH (REACH) GRANT TO SCPHS IN 2010. THE INITIAL PLANNING STAGE OF THE REACH GRANT FUNDED AN EXTENSIVE COMMUNITY SURVEY OF DIABETES PREVALENCE, PILOT TRAINING OF A DOZEN INDIGENOUS DIABETES HEALTH PROMOTERS, AN ELEMENTARY SCHOOL DIABETES PREVENTION EDUCATION PROGRAM, AND A DIABETES HEALTH SCREENING PROGRAM FOR AT-RISK WEST INDIAN RESIDENTS. THE WEST INDIAN DIABETES ACTION COALITION UTILIZED A MAPP PROCESS TO DEVELOP A COMMUNITY ACTION PLAN (CAP). UNFORTUNATELY, SHIFTING PRIORITIES AT THE CENTERS FOR DISEASE CONTROL (CDC) ENDED FUNDING FOR THE PROJECT BEFORE ITS IMPLEMENTATION PHASE. IN 2014, SCPHS WAS AWARDED A ""PARTNERSHIPS TO IMPROVE COMMUNITY HEALTH"" (PICH) GRANT, FUNDED BY THE CDC. ONE OF THE GOALS OF THIS GRANT IS TO INCREASE SCREENING RATES FOR TYPE-2 DIABETES IN THE WEST INDIAN POPULATION THAT ARE SEEN AT ELLIS FAMILY HEALTH CENTER, AN ELLIS MEDICINE PRIMARY CARE SITE.OVERALL, HOWEVER, SCHENECTADY COUNTY RESIDENTS ARE MORE LIKELY THAN THE AVERAGE NEW YORK STATE RESIDENT TO HAVE HEALTH INSURANCE (SEE FIGURE 2). THE VAST MAJORITY OF PRIMARY MEDICAL CARE AND DENTAL CARE FOR LOW-INCOME RESIDENTS IS PROVIDED BY THE HOMETOWN HEALTH FQHC AND THE COMMUNITY PRACTICES OF THE ELLIS MEDICAL GROUP. BOTH HAVE ACHIEVED RECOGNITION BY THE NATIONAL COMMITTEE FOR QUALITY ASSURANCE (NCQA) AS PATIENT-CENTERED MEDICAL HOMES (PCMH).SEE SCHEDULE O."

In the quantitative analysis, multiple sources provided the reportable statistics including the New York State Community Health Indicators, the County Health Rankings Report, as well as internal data from Cayuga Medical Center. The data collected for the quantitative assessment was then sorted into the following health categories: * Demographics and socioeconomic status * Access to health care * Health Status of overall population and priority populations * Risk factor behaviors and conditions related to top 5 causes of death * Child health * Infectious diseases * Natural environment * Social and Mental Health environment * Resources/Assets. For every indicator, comparisons were made utilizing the mean value for each individual county, the aggregate value for the total community, the New York State w/o New York City (NYC) state value, and the U.S. value where applicable to generate context for interpretation. Information for this assessment was collected in a different manner this year, as the CHNA and Community Health Improvement Plan (CHIP) was a combined effort with the Local Health Department of Tompkins County. The CHNA/CHIP team was comprised of representatives from Tompkins County, Cayuga Medical Center and several community-based non-profit organizations. Much of the information driving the selection/confirmation of our priorities was gathered through conversations with service providers, and through panels and presentations by peers and providers. Key data indicators were reviewed to guide selection decisions for our priority focus areas. For example, data on hospitalizations related to mental health and substance abuse showed steep increases over the last 2-10 years, indicating that mental health and substance abuse continues to be a priority for Tompkins County. Finally, review of chronic disease indicators revealed that Tompkins County is in the second quartile statewide, indicating the need to continue our efforts to focus on underserved populations, particularly in the rural parts of the county."

Many of these areas are designated rural counties and Tompkins County is NYS's smallest Metropolitan Statistical Area. The total service area spans approximately 1,000 square miles in the middle of the state with an average population density of fewer than 125 persons per square mile. There are several distinct health and health-related factors affecting residents of this area: A)The Region is home to an older community. According to HANYS, 11.3% of adults are 55-64 years of age. Since the 2000 Census, growth in the 65+ age cohort has ranged from 15% to 32% across the region and is projected to increase by 18% between 2016-2021. Issues with chronic disease and psychological distress are well documented for this demographic. Overall, 22.9% of adults aged 55 and over are likely to be in fair or poor health, ranging from 19.6% of those aged 55-64 to 32.1% of those aged 85 and over (National Health Statistics Reports, Health Characteristics of Adults Aged 55 Years and Over: United States, 2004-2007, CDC, 2009). B) Access to health care professionals within the Region is problematic. Many of the counties have zip codes within that county with Health Professional Shortage Areas (HPSAs) designations for physician, dental, and mental health care for Medicaid beneficiaries. Even when a provider is available, the rural environment, defined by hilly terrains and lakes as geographic barriers, creates transportation challenges that can limit access. C) In aggregate, residents of the service area are fiscally challenged. The median salary within the Region is $52,624, which is $6,645 below the state average (ACS 5-year Estimate, Census Bureau)."

201813189349308681,550357045,Part III Line 3,"The estimated bad debt attributable to patients eligible for charity care of 109,884 should be considered community benefit due to the fact that anyone with outstanding balances of 15,000 or greater usually qualifies as catastrophic if the patient completes the application process. In our charity care policy, we define catastrophic care as any illness or injury that will likely require continuous or frequent treatment for more than one year. Regardless, that bad debt should be considered community benefit as we provide services to those in need regardless of their ability to pay."
201813189349308681,550357045,Part III Line 4,"Reynolds Memorial Hospitals financial statements are prepared on a consolidated basis as a member of the WV United Health System. The footnote for Accounts Receivable is as follows Patient accounts receivable are reported at net realizable value. Accounts are written off when they are determined to be uncollectible based upon managements assessment of individual accounts. In evaluating the collectability of patient accounts receivable, the System analyzes its past history and identifies trends for each of its major payor sources of revenue to estimate the appropriate allowance for doubtful accounts and provision for bad debts. For receivables associated with services provided to patients who have third-party coverage, the System analyzes contractual amounts due and provides an allowance for doubtful accounts and a provision for bad debts, if necessary. For receivables associated with self-pay patients, which includes both patients without insurance and insured patients with deductible and copayment balances, the System records a significant provision for bad debts in the period of service on the basis of its past experience, which indicates that many patients are unable or unwilling to pay the portion of their bill for which they are financially responsible. The difference between the billed rates and the amounts actually collected after all reasonable collection efforts have been exhausted is charged off against the allowance for doubtful accounts. The Systems allowance for doubtful accounts for self-pay patients increased to 60 of self-pay accounts receivable at December 31, 2017, from 57 of self-pay accounts receivable at December 31, 2016. In addition, the Systems self-pay write-offs net of recoveries increased to approximately 61,142,000 in 2017, from approximately 51,775,000 in 2016, which is the result of a slightly higher payor mix percentage of individuals without insurance and a slightly higher exposure to self-pay balances from high deductible third-party insurance plans. The System does not maintain a material allowance for doubtful accounts from third-party payors, nor does it have a history of significant write-offs from third-party payors. The System grants credit without collateral to its patients, most of whom are local residents and are insured under third-party payor agreements, primarily with Medicare, Medicaid, and various commercial insurance companies. The System maintains allowances for potential credit losses and such losses have historically been within managements expectations. The mix of receivables at December 31, 2017 and 2016 from patients and third-party payors is as follows. For 2017, Medicare 29, Medicaid 14, Blue Cross 21, Commercial/HMO/Other 32, Patients 4, Total 100. For 2016, Medicare 31, Medicaid 14, Blue Cross 21, Commercial/HMO/Other 30, Patients 4, Total 100."

IF PATIENTS ON THE 20% TO 80% SLIDING FEE SCALE ARE RESPONSIBLE FOR QUALIFIED OUT-OF-POCKET PAID MEDICAL EXPENSES IN EXCESS OF 30% OF THEIR GROSS ANNUAL INCOME (I.E. BILLS UNPAID BY OTHER PARTIES), THEN THE AMOUNT IN EXCESS OF 30% IS CONSIDERED HOSPITAL CARE PAYMENT ASSISTANCE. ASSET CRITERIA: CHARITY CARE INCLUDES ASSET ELIGIBILITY THRESHOLDS WHICH STATES THAT INDIVIDUAL ASSETS CANNOT EXCEED $7,500 AND FAMILY ASSETS CANNOT EXCEED $15,000 AS OF THE DATE OF SERVICE. CHARITY CARE MAY BE AVAILABLE TO NON-NEW JERSEY RESIDENTS, REQUIRING IMMEDIATE MEDICAL ATTENTION FOR AN EMERGENCY MEDICAL CONDITION. NEW JERSEY UNINSURED DISCOUNT (PUBLIC LAW 2008, C. 60) ------------------------------------------------------ UNINSURED PATIENTS WITH FAMILY GROSS INCOME LESS THAN 500% OF FPG MAY BE ELIGIBLE FOR DISCOUNTED CARE UNDER THIS PROGRAM.

RECEIVABLES FOR PATIENT CARE ---------------------------- PATIENT ACCOUNTS RECEIVABLE FOR WHICH THE NETWORK RECEIVES PAYMENT UNDER COST REIMBURSEMENT, PROSPECTIVE PAYMENT FORMULAE OR NEGOTIATED RATES, WHICH COVER THE MAJORITY OF PATIENT SERVICES, ARE STATED AT THE ESTIMATED NET AMOUNTS RECEIVABLE FROM PAYORS, WHICH ARE GENERALLY LESS THAN THE ESTABLISHED BILLING RATES OF THE NETWORK.

FOR RECEIVABLES ASSOCIATED WITH SERVICES PROVIDED TO PATIENTS WHO HAVE THIRD-PARTY COVERAGE (WHICH INCLUDES BOTH PATIENTS WITH DEDUCTIBLE AND COPAYMENT BALANCES DUE FOR WHICH THIRD-PARTY COVERAGE EXISTS FOR PART OF THE BILL), THE NETWORK ANALYZES CONTRACTUALLY DUE AMOUNTS AND PROVIDES AN ALLOWANCE FOR DOUBTFUL ACCOUNTS, IF NECESSARY. THE DIFFERENCE BETWEEN THE BILLED RATES AND THE AMOUNTS ACTUALLY COLLECTED AFTER ALL REASONABLE COLLECTION EFFORTS HAVE BEEN EXHAUSTED IS CHARGED OFF AGAINST NET PATIENT SERVICE REVENUE. CHARITY CARE ------------ CERTAIN ENTITIES WITHIN THE NETWORK HAVE A PATIENT ACCEPTANCE POLICY, WHICH IS BASED ON ITS MISSION STATEMENT AND ITS CHARITABLE PURPOSES. ACCORDINGLY, THESE ENTITIES ACCEPT ALL PATIENTS REGARDLESS OF THEIR ABILITY TO PAY. A PATIENT IS CLASSIFIED AS A CHARITY PATIENT BY REFERENCE TO CERTAIN FINANCIAL CRITERIA ESTABLISHED BY THE STATE OF NEW JERSEY AND THE NETWORKS POLICY.

201803199349301330,210634484,"SCHEDULE H, PART III, SECTION B; QUESTION 8","MEDICARE COSTS WERE DERIVED FROM THE 2017 MEDICARE COST REPORT. MEDICARE UNDERPAYMENTS AND BAD DEBT ARE COMMUNITY BENEFIT AND ASSOCIATED COSTS ARE INCLUDABLE ON THE FORM 990, SCHEDULE H, PART I. THE ORGANIZATION FEELS THAT MEDICARE UNDERPAYMENTS (SHORTFALL), BAD DEBT AND ASSOCIATED COSTS ARE COMMUNITY BENEFIT AND ARE INCLUDABLE ON THE FORM 990, SCHEDULE H, PART I. AS OUTLINED MORE FULLY BELOW, THE ORGANIZATION BELIEVES THAT THESE SERVICES AND RELATED COSTS PROMOTE THE HEALTH OF THE COMMUNITY AS A WHOLE AND ARE RENDERED IN CONJUNCTION WITH THE ORGANIZATION'S CHARITABLE TAX-EXEMPT PURPOSES AND MISSION IN PROVIDING MEDICALLY NECESSARY HEALTHCARE SERVICES TO ALL INDIVIDUALS IN A NON-DISCRIMINATORY MANNER WITHOUT REGARD TO RACE, COLOR, CREED, SEX, NATIONAL ORIGIN OR ABILITY TO PAY AND CONSISTENT WITH THE COMMUNITY BENEFIT STANDARD PROMULGATED BY THE IRS. THE COMMUNITY BENEFIT STANDARD IS THE CURRENT STANDARD FOR A HOSPITAL FOR RECOGNITION AS A TAX-EXEMPT AND CHARITABLE ORGANIZATION UNDER INTERNAL REVENUE CODE (""IRC"") 501(C)(3). THE ORGANIZATION IS RECOGNIZED AS A TAX-EXEMPT ENTITY AND CHARITABLE ORGANIZATION UNDER 501(C)(3) OF THE IRC. ALTHOUGH THERE IS NO DEFINITION IN THE TAX CODE FOR THE TERM ""CHARITABLE"" A REGULATION PROMULGATED BY THE DEPARTMENT OF THE TREASURY PROVIDES SOME GUIDANCE AND STATES THAT ""THE TERM CHARITABLE IS USED IN SECTION 501(C)(3) IN ITS GENERALLY ACCEPTED LEGAL SENSE,PROVIDES EXAMPLES OF CHARITABLE PURPOSES, INCLUDING THE RELIEF OF THE POOR OR UNPRIVILEGED; THE PROMOTION OF SOCIAL WELFARE; AND THE ADVANCEMENT OF EDUCATION, RELIGION, AND SCIENCE. NOTE IT DOES NOT EXPLICITLY ADDRESS THE ACTIVITIES OF HOSPITALS. IN THE ABSENCE OF EXPLICIT STATUTORY OR REGULATORY REQUIREMENTS APPLYING THE TERM ""CHARITABLE"" TO HOSPITALS, IT HAS BEEN LEFT TO THE IRS TO DETERMINE THE CRITERIA HOSPITALS MUST MEET TO QUALIFY AS IRC 501(C)(3) CHARITABLE ORGANIZATIONS. THE ORIGINAL STANDARD WAS KNOWN AS THE CHARITY CARE STANDARD. THIS STANDARD WAS REPLACED BY THE IRS WITH THE COMMUNITY BENEFIT STANDARD WHICH IS THE CURRENT STANDARD. CHARITY CARE STANDARD IN 1956, THE IRS ISSUED REVENUE RULING 56-185, WHICH ADDRESSED THE REQUIREMENTS HOSPITALS NEEDED TO MEET IN ORDER TO QUALIFY FOR IRC 501(C)(3) STATUS. ONE OF THESE REQUIREMENTS IS KNOWN AS THE ""CHARITY CARE STANDARD."" UNDER THE STANDARD, A HOSPITAL MUST PROVIDE, TO THE EXTENT OF ITS FINANCIAL ABILITY, FREE OR REDUCED-COST CARE TO PATIENTS WHO CANNOT PAY FOR SUCH SERVICES. A HOSPITAL THAT EXPECTED FULL PAYMENT DID NOT, ACCORDING TO THE RULING, PROVIDE CHARITY CARE BASED ON THE FACT THAT SOME PATIENTS ULTIMATELY FAILED TO PAY. THE RULING EMPHASIZED THAT A LOW LEVEL OF CHARITY CARE DID NOT NECESSARILY MEAN THAT A HOSPITAL HAD FAILED TO MEET THE REQUIREMENT SINCE THAT LEVEL COULD REFLECT ITS FINANCIAL ABILITY TO PROVIDE SUCH CARE. THE RULING ALSO NOTED THAT PUBLICLY SUPPORTED COMMUNITY HOSPITALS WOULD NORMALLY QUALIFY AS CHARITABLE ORGANIZATIONS BECAUSE THEY SERVE THE ENTIRE COMMUNITY AND A LOW LEVEL OF CHARITY CARE WOULD NOT AFFECT A HOSPITAL'S EXEMPT STATUS IF IT WAS DUE TO THE SURROUNDING COMMUNITY'S LACK OF CHARITABLE DEMANDS. COMMUNITY BENEFIT STANDARD IN 1969, THE IRS ISSUED REVENUE RULING 69-545, WHICH ""REMOVED"" FROM REVENUE RULING 56-185 ""THE REQUIREMENTS RELATING TO CARING FOR PATIENTS WITHOUT CHARGE OR AT RATES BELOW COST."" UNDER THE STANDARD DEVELOPED IN REVENUE RULING 69-545, WHICH IS KNOWN AS THE ""COMMUNITY BENEFIT STANDARD,"" HOSPITALS ARE JUDGED ON WHETHER THEY PROMOTE THE HEALTH OF A BROAD CLASS OF INDIVIDUALS IN THE COMMUNITY. THE RULING INVOLVED A HOSPITAL THAT ONLY ADMITTED INDIVIDUALS WHO COULD PAY FOR THE SERVICES (BY THEMSELVES, PRIVATE INSURANCE, OR PUBLIC PROGRAMS SUCH AS MEDICARE), BUT OPERATED A FULL-TIME EMERGENCY ROOM THAT WAS OPEN TO EVERYONE. THE IRS RULED THAT THE HOSPITAL QUALIFIED AS A CHARITABLE ORGANIZATION BECAUSE IT PROMOTED THE HEALTH OF PEOPLE IN ITS COMMUNITY. THE IRS REASONED THAT BECAUSE THE PROMOTION OF HEALTH WAS A CHARITABLE PURPOSE ACCORDING TO THE GENERAL LAW OF CHARITY, IT FELL WITHIN THE ""GENERALLY ACCEPTED LEGAL SENSE"" OF THE TERM ""CHARITABLE,"" AS REQUIRED BY THE DEPARTMENT OF TREASURY REG. 1.501(C)(3)-1(D)(2). THE IRS RULING STATED THAT THE PROMOTION OF HEALTH, LIKE THE RELIEF OF POVERTY AND THE ADVANCEMENT OF EDUCATION AND RELIGION, IS ONE OF THE PURPOSES IN THE GENERAL LAW OF CHARITY THAT IS DEEMED BENEFICIAL TO THE COMMUNITY AS A WHOLE EVEN THOUGH THE CLASS OF BENEFICIARIES ELIGIBLE TO RECEIVE A DIRECT BENEFIT FROM ITS ACTIVITIES DOES NOT INCLUDE ALL MEMBERS OF THE COMMUNITY, SUCH AS INDIGENT MEMBERS OF THE COMMUNITY, PROVIDED THAT THE CLASS IS NOT SO SMALL THAT ITS RELIEF IS NOT OF BENEFIT TO THE COMMUNITY. THE IRS CONCLUDED THAT THE HOSPITAL WAS ""PROMOTING THE HEALTH OF A CLASS OF PERSONS THAT IS BROAD ENOUGH TO BENEFIT THE COMMUNITY"" BECAUSE ITS EMERGENCY ROOM WAS OPEN TO ALL AND IT PROVIDED CARE TO EVERYONE WHO COULD PAY, WHETHER DIRECTLY OR THROUGH THIRD-PARTY REIMBURSEMENT. OTHER CHARACTERISTICS OF THE HOSPITAL THAT THE IRS HIGHLIGHTED INCLUDED THE FOLLOWING: ITS SURPLUS FUNDS WERE USED TO IMPROVE PATIENT CARE, EXPAND HOSPITAL FACILITIES, AND ADVANCE MEDICAL TRAINING, EDUCATION AND RESEARCH; IT WAS CONTROLLED BY A BOARD OF TRUSTEES THAT CONSISTED OF INDEPENDENT CIVIC LEADERS; AND HOSPITAL MEDICAL STAFF PRIVILEGES WERE AVAILABLE TO ALL QUALIFIED PHYSICIANS. MEDICARE UNDERPAYMENTS AND BAD DEBT ARE COMMUNITY BENEFIT AND ASSOCIATED COSTS ARE INCLUDABLE ON THE FORM 990, SCHEDULE H, PART I. THE AMERICAN HOSPITAL ASSOCIATION (""AHA"") FEELS THAT MEDICARE UNDERPAYMENTS (SHORTFALL) AND BAD DEBT ARE COMMUNITY BENEFIT AND THUS INCLUDABLE ON THE FORM 990, SCHEDULE H, PART I. THIS ORGANIZATION AGREES WITH THE AHA'S POSITION. AS OUTLINED IN THE AHA'S LETTER TO THE IRS DATED AUGUST 21, 2007 WITH RESPECT TO THE FIRST PUBLISHED DRAFT OF THE NEW FORM 990 AND SCHEDULE H, THE AHA FELT THAT THE IRS SHOULD INCORPORATE THE FULL VALUE OF THE COMMUNITY BENEFIT THAT HOSPITALS PROVIDE BY COUNTING MEDICARE UNDERPAYMENTS (SHORTFALL) AS QUANTIFIABLE COMMUNITY BENEFIT FOR THE FOLLOWING REASONS: - PROVIDING CARE FOR THE ELDERLY AND SERVING MEDICARE PATIENTS IS AN ESSENTIAL PART OF THE COMMUNITY BENEFIT STANDARD - MEDICARE, LIKE MEDICAID, DOES NOT PAY THE FULL COST OF CARE. FROM THE LATEST DATA PROVIDED BY THE AMERICAN HOSPITAL ASSOCIATION, AS OF 2012, MEDICARE REIMBURSES HOSPITALS ONLY 86 CENTS FOR EVERY DOLLAR THEY SPEND TO TAKE CARE OF MEDICARE PATIENTS. THE MEDICARE PAYMENT ADVISORY COMMISSION (""MEDPAC""), IN ITS MARCH 2013 REPORT TO CONGRESS, STATES THAT BENEFICIARIES WILL GROW NOTABLY FASTER IN THE NEXT 10 YEARS THAN IN THE PAST DECADE AS THE BABY-BOOM GENERATION AGES INTO THE PROGRAM. IN ADDITION, THE POPULATION AGING INTO THE MEDICARE PROGRAM WILL PRESENT A NEW SET OF CHALLENGES SINCE RISING OBESITY LEVELS PUT THIS POPULATION AT A GREATER RISK THAN PREVIOUS GENERATIONS FOR CHRONIC DISEASE. - MANY MEDICARE BENEFICIARIES, LIKE THEIR MEDICAID COUNTERPARTS, ARE POOR. MORE THAN 42 PERCENT OF MEDICARE SPENDING IS FOR BENEFICIARIES WHOSE INCOME IS BELOW 200 PERCENT OF THE FEDERAL POVERTY LEVEL. MANY OF THOSE MEDICARE BENEFICIARIES ARE ALSO ELIGIBLE FOR MEDICAID -- SO CALLED ELIGIBLE."" THERE IS EVERY COMPELLING PUBLIC POLICY REASON TO TREAT MEDICARE AND MEDICAID UNDERPAYMENTS SIMILARLY FOR PURPOSES OF A HOSPITAL'S COMMUNITY BENEFIT AND INCLUDE THESE COSTS ON FORM 990, SCHEDULE H, PART I. MEDICARE UNDERPAYMENT MUST BE SHOULDERED BY THE HOSPITAL IN ORDER TO CONTINUE TREATING THE COMMUNITY'S ELDERLY AND POOR. THESE UNDERPAYMENTS REPRESENT A REAL COST OF SERVING THE COMMUNITY AND SHOULD COUNT AS A QUANTIFIABLE COMMUNITY BENEFIT. BOTH THE AHA AND THIS ORGANIZATION ALSO FEEL THAT PATIENT BAD DEBT IS A COMMUNITY BENEFIT AND THUS INCLUDABLE ON THE FORM 990, SCHEDULE H, PART I. LIKE MEDICARE UNDERPAYMENT (SHORTFALLS), THERE ALSO ARE COMPELLING REASONS THAT PATIENT BAD DEBT SHOULD BE COUNTED AS QUANTIFIABLE COMMUNITY BENEFIT AS FOLLOWS: - A SIGNIFICANT MAJORITY OF BAD DEBT IS ATTRIBUTABLE TO LOW-INCOME PATIENTS, WHO, FOR MANY REASONS, DECLINE TO COMPLETE THE FORMS REQUIRED TO ESTABLISH ELIGIBILITY FOR HOSPITALS' CHARITY CARE OR FINANCIAL ASSISTANCE PROGRAMS. A 2006 CONGRESSIONAL BUDGET OFFICE (""CBO"") REPORT, NONPROFIT HOSPITALS AND THE PROVISION OF COMMUNITY BENEFITS, CITED TWO STUDIES INDICATING THAT ""THE GREAT MAJORITY OF BAD DEBT WAS ATTRIBUTABLE TO PATIENTS WITH INCOMES BELOW 200% OF THE FEDERAL POVERTY LINE."" - THE REPORT ALSO NOTED THAT A SUBSTANTIAL PORTION OF BAD DEBT IS PENDING CHARITY CARE. UNLIKE BAD DEBT IN OTHER INDUSTRIES, HOSPITAL BAD DEBT IS COMPLICATED BY THE FACT THAT HOSPITALS FOLLOW THEIR MISSION TO THE COMMUNITY AND TREAT EVERY PATIENT THAT COMES THROUGH THEIR EMERGENCY DEPARTMENT, REGARDLESS OF ABILITY TO PAY. PATIENTS WHO HAVE OUTSTANDING BILLS ARE NOT TURNED AWAY, UNLIKE OTHER INDUSTRIES. BAD DEBT IS FURTHER COMPLICATED BY THE AUDITING INDUSTRY'S STANDARDS ON REPORTING CHARITY CARE.

THE CHIW IS MADE UP OF REPRESENTATIVES FROM EACH HOSPITAL AS WELL AS PUBLIC HEALTH EXPERTS FROM THE MCDPH AND COMMUNITY MEMBER EXPERTS FROM FLHSA. IN ADDITION TO THE CHIW, SEVERAL OTHER ORGANIZATIONS COLLABORATED IN THE DEVELOPMENT OF THE CHNA. THESE ORGANIZATIONS AND PROGRAMS INCLUDE: THE CENTER FOR COMMUNITY HEALTH; THE GREATER ROCHESTER CHAMBER OF COMMERCE; THE SMOKING AND HEALTH ACTION COALITION; CENTER FOR TOBACCO FREE FINGER LAKES; NATIONAL CENTER FOR DEAF HEALTH RESEARCH; ROCHESTER-MONROE ANTI-POVERTY INITIATIVE; DELIVERY SYSTEM REFORM INCENTIVE PAYMENT (DSRIP) PROGRAM; AND TRANSFORMING PRIMARY CARE DELIVERY: MONROE COUNTY CMMI GRANT. THE MONROE COUNTY CHNA BEGAN WITH A REVIEW OF THE 2013 CHNA AND THE STATE-REQUIRED PROGRESS REPORT OF 2015 OF THE COMMUNITY HEALTH IMPROVEMENT PLAN BASED ON THE 2013 CHNA. THE PRIMARY CONSISTENT SOURCE OF DATA USED TO PRIORITIZE THE HEALTH NEEDS OF OUR COMMUNITY WAS THE COUNTY LEVEL DASHBOARDS OF THE NEW YORK STATE PREVENTION AGENDA.

FINALLY, NEW DATA SOURCES WERE REVIEWED INCLUDING ACCIDENTAL DEATHS RELATED TO HEROIN/FENTANYL, AND ADVERSE CHILDHOOD EXPERIENCES FROM THE 2014-2015 MONROE COUNTY YOUTH RISK BEHAVIOR SURVEY. THE CHIW IDENTIFIED 44 COUNTY LEVEL COMMUNITY HEALTH INDICATORS SPANNING FIVE FOCUS AREAS WHERE MONROE COUNTY DID NOT MEET THE PREVENTION AGENDA TARGETS AND AN ADDITIONAL 13 HIGH NEED HEALTH TOPIC AREAS FROM THE FROM THE MONROE COUNTY YOUTH RISK BEHAVIOR SURVEY. ALL MEMBERS OF THE CHIW ARE CRITICALLY AWARE OF THE DISPARITIES THAT EXIST IN OUR COMMUNITY FOR VIRTUALLY EVERY HEALTH OUTCOME BASED ON RACE, ETHNICITY AND SOCIOECONOMIC STATUS INCLUDING POVERTY, INCOME AND EDUCATION. SEVERAL HEALTH DISPARITIES WERE IDENTIFIED WITHIN THE DATA REVIEWED. AS A RESULT, THE CHIW EXPLORED DISPARITY EXTENSIVELY WITH THE ASSISTANCE OF REPORTS PUBLISHED BY FLHSA THAT HIGHLIGHT SIGNIFICANT HEALTH DISPARITIES IN SOCIOECONOMICALLY DISADVANTAGED AREAS OF THE CITY OF ROCHESTER. THE CHIW CONSIDERED THIS INFORMATION IN ITS ASSESSMENT AND DETERMINATION OF PRIORITY AREAS WITHIN THE CHNA. THE PROCESS FOR PRIORITIZING COMMUNITY HEALTH NEEDS AND SERVICES WAS DETERMINED THROUGH LISTENING TO THE OPINIONS OF MEMBERS OF CHIW AS WELL AS LEADERS FROM DSRIP AND SEVERAL COMMUNITY HEALTH EXPERTS. A PRIORITIZATION TOOL WAS DEVELOPED TO ALLOW MEMBERS TO RANK IDENTIFIED HEALTH ISSUES BASED ON:- IMPORTANCE - NUMBER OF PEOPLE AFFECTED, HOW MUCH DISABILITY AND ILLNESS IS CAUSED BY THE ISSUE AND THE LONG TERM IMPACT ON HEALTH- LIKELIHOOD OF IMPACTFUL SUCCESS - WILL THIS RESULT IN SUBSTANTIAL HEALTH IMPROVEMENT IN 3 - 5 YEARS- COMMUNITY SUPPORT - HOW MUCH SUPPORT IS THERE AMONGST COMMUNITY LEADERS, PARTNER ORGANIZATIONS AND RESIDENTS- HOSPITAL SUPPORT - HOW MUCH SUPPORT IS THERE AMONGST HOSPITAL LEADERS- FILL A GAP - WILL THIS FILL A GAP IN SERVICES/INITIATIVES CURRENTLY PROVIDED IN MONROE COUNTY - LARGE HEALTH DISPARITY - DOES THIS INITIATIVE ADDRESS AN IMPORTANT DISPARITY? COMMUNITY INPUT WAS STRONGLY CONSIDERED THROUGHOUT THIS PROCESS. THE CHIW REVIEWED RESULTS FROM VARIOUS PROJECTS THAT RECENTLY GATHERED COMMUNITY INPUT RELATED TO HEALTH ISSUES AFFECTING RESIDENTS. CHIW ALSO CONSIDERED SERVICES ALREADY BEING PROVIDED IN THE COMMUNITY, AND HOW WE COULD BEST DEVELOP SYNERGY WITH EXISTING PROCESSES. ONE FINAL STEP WAS CONDUCTED TO ASSURE ADEQUATE COMMUNITY INPUT. A SURVEY WAS CONDUCTED (VIA SURVEY MONKEY) OF HOSPITAL LEADERSHIP AND ANYONE ELSE THE CHIW FELT NEEDED TO BE HEARD. THE SURVEY PROVIDED PROVIDED A DETAILED LIST OF 12 HEALTH AREAS OF NEED FOR MONROE COUNTY AND INCLUDED A LIST OF EVIDENCE BASED INTERVENTIONS FOR EACH.

The footnote for Accounts Receivable is as follows Patient accounts receivable are reported at net realizable value. Accounts are written off when they are determined to be uncollectible based upon managements assessment of individual accounts. In evaluating the collectability of patient accounts receivable, the System analyzes its past history and identifies trends for each of its major payor sources of revenue to estimate the appropriate allowance for doubtful accounts and provision for bad debts. For receivables associated with services provided to patients who have third-party-coverage, the System analyzes contractual amounts due and provides an allowance for doubtful accounts and a provision for bad debts, if necessary. For receivables associated with self-pay patients, which includes both patients without insurance and insured patients with deductible and copayment balances, the System records a significant provision for bad debts in the period of service on the basis of its past experience, which indicates that many patients are unable or unwilling to pay the portion of their bill for which they are financially responsible. The difference between the billed rates and the amounts actually collected after all reasonable collection efforts have been exhausted is charged off against the allowance for doubtful accounts. The Systems allowance for doubtful accounts for self-pay patients increased to 60 of self-pay accounts receivable at December 31, 2017, from 57 of self-pay accounts receivable at December 31, 2016. In addition, the Systems self-pay write-offs net of recoveries increased to approximately 61,142,000 in 2017, from approximately 51,775,000 in 2016, which is the result of a slightly higher payor mix percentage of individuals without insurance and a slightly higher exposure to self-pay balances from high deductible third-party insurance plans. The System does not maintain a material allowance for doubtful accounts from third-party payors, nor does it have a history of significant write-offs from third-party payors. The System grants credit without collateral to its patients, most of whom are local residents and are insured under third-party payor agreements, primarily with Medicare, Medicaid, and various commercial insurance companies. The System maintains allowances for potential credit losses and such losses have historically been within managements expectations. The mix of receivables at December31, 2017 and 2016 from patients and third-party payors is as follows. For 2017, Medicare 29, Medicaid 14, Blue Cross 21 , Commercial/HMO/Other 32, Patients 4, Total 100. For 2016, Medicare 31, Medicaid 14, Blue Cross 21, Commercial/HMO/Other 30, Patients 4, Total 100."

An outsourced self-pay billing agency will contact the guarantor to set up payment arrangements. Financial assistance discounts are offered to guarantors who meet the charity guidelines.Self pay patients receive a 35% discount off total charges. They are also eligible for a 10% prompt payment discount if they pay the balance during the discussion. Discounts may be combined if all requirements are met. In pursuit of collections, the hospital and its agents will not: attach liens on property, garnish wages, pursue legal actions (unless recommended by the self pay billing entities), sell accounts, or send bankrupt guarantors to collection agencies."

MANAGEMENT REGULARLY REVIEWS DATA ABOUT THESE MAJOR PAYOR SOURCES OF REVENUE IN EVALUATING THE SUFFICIENCY OF THE ALLOWANCE FOR DOUBTFUL ACCOUNTS. FOR RECEIVABLES ASSOCIATED WITH SERVICES PROVIDED TO PATIENTS WHO HAVE THIRD-PARTY COVERAGE, THE HOSPITAL ANALYZES CONTRACTUALLY DUE AMOUNTS AND PROVIDES AN ALLOWANCE FOR DOUBTFUL ACCOUNTS AND A PROVISION FOR BAD DEBTS, IF NECESSARY (FOR EXAMPLE, FOR EXPECTED UNCOLLECTIBLE DEDUCTIBLES AND COPAYMENTS ON ACCOUNTS FOR WHICH THE THIRD-PARTY PAYOR HAS NOT YET PAID, OR FOR PAYORS WHO ARE KNOWN TO HAVE FINANCIAL DIFFICULTIES THAT MAKE THE REALIZATION OF AMOUNTS DUE UNLIKELY). FOR RECEIVABLES ASSOCIATED WITH SELF-PAY PATIENTS (WHICH INCLUDES BOTH PATIENTS WITHOUT INSURANCE AND PATIENTS WITH DEDUCTIBLE AND COPAYMENT BALANCES DUE FOR WHICH THIRD-PARTY COVERAGE EXISTS FOR PART OF THE BILL), THE HOSPITAL RECORDS A SIGNIFICANT PROVISION FOR BAD DEBTS IN THE PERIOD OF SERVICE ON THE BASIS OF ITS PAST EXPERIENCE, WHICH INDICATES THAT MANY PATIENTS ARE UNABLE OR UNWILLING TO PAY THE PORTION OF THEIR BILL FOR WHICH THEY ARE FINANCIALLY RESPONSIBLE.

THE PURPOSE OF THE PLAN IS TO PROVIDE DIRECTION AND CONTEXT FOR HOSPITAL DECISION MAKING AND RESOURCE ALLOCATION CONSISTENT WITH LOCAL HEALTH CARE NEEDS AND MARKET OPPORTUNITIES. TO ACCOMPLISH THIS TASK, THE COMMITTEE CREATED A COMPREHENSIVE, PARTICIPATORY PROCESS TO SOLICIT INPUT FROM ALL LEVELS OF THE ORGANIZATION AND THE COMMUNITY. A MULTI-STEP PLANNING PROCESS WAS INITIATED.STEP 1 INVOLVED THE REVIEW AND REVISION OF THE HOSPITAL'S MISSION AND VISION STATEMENTS. BOTH STATEMENTS WERE MODIFIED FROM WHAT HAD PREVIOUSLY EXISTED. A CONCISE, VALUE DRIVEN MISSION STATEMENT WAS DEVELOPED IN RESPONSE TO THE NEED FOR MISSION STATEMENTS TO DESCRIBE ""WHO WE ARE."" ADDITIONALLY, SEVERAL CORE VALUES WERE DELINEATED IN SUPPORT OF THE MISSION STATEMENT. THE VISION STATEMENT WAS DEVELOPED IN RESPONSE TO THE QUESTION OF ""WHAT DO WE WISH TO BECOME"" WITH THE UNDERSTANDING THAT VISION STATEMENTS SHOULD BE REALISTIC, CREDIBLE, AND POSSESS THE ABILITY TO INSPIRE AND MOTIVATE. STEP 2 IDENTIFIED A SERIES OF CRITICAL ISSUES FACING THE HOSPITAL THAT WILL PROVIDE THE CONTEXT FOR THE HOSPITAL'S NEAR TERM OPERATING ENVIRONMENT WITH RESPECT TO CARE DELIVERY, REGULATION, COMPETITION, FINANCE AND KEY PUBLICS. STEP 3 INVOLVED THE DEVELOPMENT OF A COMPREHENSIVE ENVIRONMENTAL ANALYSIS, INCLUDING AN INTERNAL AND EXTERNAL ASSESSMENT OF THE HOSPITAL. THE INTERNAL ASSESSMENT WAS PROVIDED VIA MULTIPLE FOCUS GROUPS - OPEN DISCUSSIONS ABOUT THE HOSPITAL'S STRENGTHS, WEAKNESSES, OPPORTUNITIES AND THREATS. THESE FOCUS GROUPS, FACILITATED BY AN OUTSIDE CONSULTANT RETAINED BY THE HOSPITAL, PROVIDED INPUT FROM PHYSICIANS, EMPLOYEES, VOLUNTEERS AND THE COMMUNITY AND PROVIDED SIGNIFICANT INSIGHT INTO STRENGTHS, WEAKNESSES, AND OPPORTUNITIES FOR IMPROVEMENT. THE EXTERNAL ASSESSMENT WAS DEVELOPED FROM THE COMPILATION OF UTILIZATION, MARKET SHARE DEMOGRAPHIC AND FINANCIAL DATA AND PHYSICIAN WORKFORCE INFORMATION SPECIFIC TO THE HOSPITAL'S SERVICE AREA.STEPS 4, 5 AND 6 IDENTIFIED GOALS, STRATEGIES, AND OBJECTIVES THAT WILL SERVE AS OLEAN GENERAL HOSPITAL'S PRIORITIES THROUGH 2019. THE PLAN WAS REVIEWED IN JUNE 2016 AND INITIATIVES ADDED THAT WERE CARRIED OUT IN 2016. GOALS RESPOND TO THE QUESTION ""WHAT ARE THE KEY PRIORITIES?"" A SERIES OF STRATEGIES WERE DEVELOPED WHICH RESPOND TO THE QUESTION ""HOW DO WE ACHIEVE OUR PRIORITIES?"" FINALLY, A NUMBER OF SPECIFIC OBJECTIVES WERE DEVELOPED WHICH RESPOND TO THE QUESTION ""WHAT WILL BE ACCOMPLISHED ANNUALLY?"" OBJECTIVES WERE GENERATED BY SENIOR MANAGEMENT AND FORM THE BASIS FOR NEAR TERM ADMINISTRATIVE WORKPLANS.ESSENTIAL TO THE SUCCESS OF ANY STRATEGIC PLAN IS THE HOSPITAL'S ABILITY TO BOTH IMPLEMENT RECOMMENDATIONS MADE WITHIN THE PLAN AND TO RECOGNIZE THE DOCUMENT AS A DYNAMIC AND FLEXIBLE TOOL TO BE USED AS A GUIDE FOR THE FUTURE. SPECIFIC GOALS AND STRATEGIES MAY OR MAY NOT BE OBTAINED AND, UPON EVALUATION AND THE AVAILABILITY OF NEW INFORMATION AND DEVELOPMENTS, MAY NEED TO BE MODIFIED. A SUCCESSFUL STRATEGIC PLAN RECOGNIZES THIS POTENTIAL FOR CHANGE AND IS FLEXIBLE ENOUGH TO ACCOMMODATE NEW OR DIFFERENT OPPORTUNITIES AND CHALLENGES.CRITICAL HEALTH CARE ISSUESTHE ENACTED HEALTHCARE REFORM LEGISLATION UNDERSCORES MANY OF THE SIGNIFICANT ISSUES CURRENTLY FACING HOSPITALS. FOLLOWING IS LISTING OF CRITICAL ISSUES THAT WILL IMPACT HOSPITALS OVER THE NEXT SEVERAL YEARS. 1. QUALITY: HEALTH CARE QUALITY AND SAFETY ARE NOW STRATEGICALLY IMPORTANT, NOT JUST PROFESSIONALLY IMPORTANT. THE ADVENT OF WIDESPREAD PUBLIC REPORTING OF HOSPITAL QUALITY RESULTS ASSURES THAT A HOSPITAL'S QUALITY PERFORMANCE IS NO LONGER ONLY VISIBLE TO THE DIRECTOR OF QUALITY, QA COMMITTEE MEMBERS AND VARIOUS REGULATORS. THE NET EFFECT OF THIS TRANSPARENCY TREND OVER THE NEXT 5 YEARS WILL BE THAT THE DEFINITION OF A ""GOOD HOSPITAL"" WILL SHIFT SIGNIFICANTLY. NO LONGER WILL IT BE ENOUGH TO HAVE ATTRACTIVE FACILITIES, GOOD TECHNOLOGIES AND SKILLED DOCTORS AND NURSES. HOSPITALS WILL NEED TO MARSHAL THOSE RESOURCES INTO A QUALITY AND SAFETY SYSTEM CAPABLE OF RELIABLY PRODUCING MEASURED QUALITY RESULTS. PROVIDER PAYMENTS WILL INCREASINGLY BE A FUNCTION OF QUALITY OUTCOMES AND QUALITY BONUSES WILL BE DRAWN FROM ANNUAL PAYMENT UPDATES. INFORMATION SYSTEMS CAPABLE OF PROVIDING VALID AND RELIABLE QUALITY AND OUTCOME INDICATORS WILL BE A NECESSITY AS WILL THE USE OF EVIDENCE BASED GUIDELINES BY CLINICAL PROVIDERS. CONSUMERS WILL SEEK AND USE PERFORMANCE INFORMATION, INCLUDING PATIENT SATISFACTION INFORMATION, TO GUIDE THEIR CHOICE OF PROVIDERS.2. INFORMATION TECHNOLOGY: HEALTH INFORMATION TECHNOLOGY INCLUDES COMPUTER BASED TOOLS DEVELOPED SPECIFICALLY FOR HEALTH CARE DELIVERY. THESE TOOLS CAN PROVIDE CLINICIANS UP-TO-DATE INFORMATION ON THEIR PATIENTS, ACCESS TO THE LATEST MEDICAL KNOWLEDGE AND BEST PRACTICES THROUGH DECISION SUPPORT SYSTEMS. IT IS UNDERSTOOD THAT INVESTMENTS IN NEW CLINICAL AND INFORMATION TECHNOLOGY CAN SIGNIFICANTLY ENHANCE PATIENT SAFETY AND CLINICAL OUTCOMES. COMPUTERIZED PHYSICIAN ORDER ENTRY (CPOE), BAR CODING AND ITS POTENTIAL TO REDUCE MEDICATION ERRORS, AND ELECTRONIC MEDICAL RECORDS (EMRS) AND THEIR POSITIVE IMPACT ON MEDICAL ERRORS ARE ALL EXAMPLES OF HEALTH CARE'S USE OF IT SOLUTIONS TO IMPROVE QUALITY. THE FEDERAL GOVERNMENT HAS HIGHLIGHTED THE ROLE OF HEALTH INFORMATION TECHNOLOGY AS A MEANS TO IMPROVE HEALTH CARE QUALITY, SAFETY AND NOW IS PROVIDING STIMULUS AND INCENTIVE PAYMENTS TO PROVIDERS TO FACILITATE AND HASTEN THEIR ADOPTION INTO THE CARE DELIVERY PROCESS. EMR'S WILL BECOME A PREREQUISITE OF ANY DELIVERY SYSTEM THAT INTENDS TO PROVIDE COORDINATED COST EFFECTIVE CARE.3. PHYSICIANS: PHYSICIANS HAVE EMERGED AS CRITICAL OPERATIONAL AND STRATEGIC PARTNERS TO HOSPITALS. THOSE THAT ARE SUCCESSFUL IN ENGAGING AND COLLABORATING WITH THEIR MEDICAL STAFF WILL BE BEST ABLE TO DEMONSTRATE HIGH QUALITY CARE AND COMPLIANCE WITH HEALTH REFORM'S VALUE BASED PURCHASING AND OTHER QUALITY MANDATES. ADDITIONALLY, GIVEN THE INCREASE IN DEMAND FOR HEALTHCARE SERVICES THAT WILL BE OCCASIONED BY REFORM, THE ABILITY TO SUCCESSFULLY RECRUIT PHYSICIANS WILL BE CRITICAL. AT A TIME WHEN HEALTHCARE REFORM INITIATIVES EMPHASIZE THE ROLE OF PRIMARY CARE, THERE IS A SPECIAL NEED TO INTENSIFY EFFORTS TO RECRUIT PRIMARY CARE PROVIDERS. BECAUSE THE VAST MAJORITY OF NEW PHYSICIANS PREFER EMPLOYMENT AS THEIR PRACTICE PREFERENCE, THE ABILITY OF HOSPITALS TO BE ABLE TO OFFER PHYSICIANS A CONTEMPORARY AND COMPETITIVE ""EMPLOYMENT PLATFORM"" IS ESSENTIAL.4. FINANCE AND CAPITAL: FINANCIAL PERFORMANCE AND ACCESS TO CAPITAL WILL CONTINUE TO BE AMONG THE MOST CRITICAL ISSUES CONFRONTING HOSPITALS. EVEN WITH HEALTHCARE REFORM, HEALTHCARE COSTS WILL CONTINUE TO OUTPACE INFLATION. INCREASING WAGE AND SALARY COSTS, AND RISING HEALTH CARE COSTS IN GENERAL WILL CONTINUE TO IMPACT OPERATING PERFORMANCE AND PRESS HOSPITALS TO CONTINUE A RELENTLESS FOCUS ON COST MANAGEMENT. ADDITIONALLY, REVENUE STRATEGIES WILL NEED TO BE DEVELOPED TO GENERATE PROFITABLE GROWTH IN PATIENT VOLUME, AS WILL THE NEED TO ENSURE OPTIMAL MANAGEMENT OF ALL REVENUE CYCLE ACTIVITIES. HOSPITALS ARE FACING SIGNIFICANT PAYMENT REDUCTIONS IN TERMS OF DECREASES IN MEDICARE UPDATES, DISPROPORTIONATE SHARE, SNF AND HOMECARE PAYMENTS. AS HOSPITALS CONTINUE TO POST LOW OR NO PROFIT MARGINS, INVESTMENT INCOME WILL BE MORE IMPORTANT THAN EVER. HOWEVER, GIVEN THE FACT THAT INVESTMENT INCOME IS A HIGHLY UNCERTAIN COMPONENT OF A HOSPITAL'S OVERALL FINANCIAL HEALTH, HOSPITALS WILL BE DRIVEN TO PURSUE MORE PHILANTHROPY. HOSPITAL CAPITAL SPENDING WILL BE DRIVEN BY GROWING DEMANDS FOR ADVANCED TECHNOLOGY NEEDED TO ENSURE PATIENT QUALITY AND SAFETY, THE NEED TO REPLACE AND UPDATE AGING FACILITIES, AND THE DESIRE AND NEED TO IMPROVE TECHNOLOGY BASED SERVICES.IN 2016 OGH'S BOARD OF DIRECTORS VOTED TO BECOME PART OF THE KALEIDA HEALTH SYSTEM, A BUFFALO, NEW YORK-BASED HEALTH SYSTEM. THIS DECISION WAS BASED ON A FIVE YEAR LONG-TERM FINANCIAL PLAN THAT WAS DEVELOPED FOR OGH AND ITS SISTER HOSPITAL UNDER OGH'S PARENT COMPANY- UPPER ALLEGHENY HEALTH SYSTEM (UAHS), WHICH DEMONSTRATED A FUTURE INABILITY TO REMAIN FINANCIALLY VIABLE GIVEN THE DOWNWARD PRESSURES ON REVENUE IN THE HEALTH CARE INDUSTRY AS WELL AS RISING COSTS TO PROVIDE CARE. OGH IS NOT UNIQUE IN THIS VULNERABLE POSITION. HOSPITALS ACROSS AMERICA, ESPECIALLY RURAL HOSPITALS, FACE A DAUNTING CHALLENGE OF SURVIVAL. SIGNIFICANT TIME WAS SPENT ANALYZING OGH'S AND UAHS' FINANCES AND EVALUATING KALEIDA HEALTH AS A PARTNER. A DECISION TO AFFILIATE WAS MADE IN THE FALL OF 2016. THE AFFILIATION WAS FORMALLY COMPLETED ON JULY 3, 2017. FINANCIAL IMPROVEMENT OF OVER $10M ANNUALLY AT UAHS IS EXPECTED UNDER THE AFFILIATION PLAN WHEN IMPROVEMENTS ARE FULLY IMPLEMENTED.SEE CONTINUATION AT THE END OF PART VI."

A COST ACCOUNTING SYSTEM WAS USED TO DETERMINE THE AMOUNTS REPORTED IN THE TABLE FOR PART I, LINES 7E, 7F, 7G, AND 7I. PART VI, LINE 1 - DESCRIPTION FOR PART I, 7E ADVOCATE HEALTH & HOSPITALS CORPORATION PROVIDES COMMUNITY HEALTH IMPROVEMENT SERVICES TO THE COMMUNITIES IN WHICH IT SERVES. AHHC PROVIDES LANGUAGE SERVICES TO ALL THOSE IN NEED IN ORDER TO PROVIDE BETTER ACCESS TO CARE FOR ALL COMMUNITY MEMBERS. IN ADDITION, OTHER PROGRAMS ARE CARRIED OUT WITH THE EXPRESS PURPOSE OF IMPROVING COMMUNITY HEALTH, ACCESS TO HEALTH SERVICES AND GENERAL HEALTH KNOWLEDGE. THESE SERVICES DO NOT GENERATE PATIENT BILLS, HOWEVER, CERTAIN PROGRAMS OR SERVICES MAY HAVE NOMINAL FEES. THESE SERVICES AND PROGRAMS INCLUDE SENIOR BREAKFAST CLUBS WHICH INCLUDE EDUCATIONAL SPEAKERS FOCUSING ON HEALTH AND WELLNESS AND INCLUDE BLOOD PRESSURE SCREENINGS; CANCER SUPPORT GROUPS FOR VARIOUS TYPES OF CANCER INCLUDING, PROSTATE, BREAST AND SKIN CANCERS. THESE GROUPS FOCUS ON EDUCATING THE NEWLY DIAGNOSED AND PROVIDING INFORMATION ON BETTER LIVING FOR SURVIVORS. SKIN CANCER SCREENINGS ARE ALSO PROVIDED; VARIOUS PROGRAMS REGARDING JOINT PAIN AND REPLACEMENT INCLUDING TREATMENT OPTIONS AND INFORMATION ON PAIN RELIEF; VARIOUS WOMEN AND BABY, BREASTFEEDING, MULTIPLES AND CHILDBIRTH CLASSES; VARIOUS EDUCATIONAL PROGRAMS AND SUPPORT GROUPS TO RAISE AWARENESS OF HEART DISEASE RISK FACTORS AND TREATMENT OPTIONS AND EDUCATION FOR LIVING WITH THE DISEASE; THERE ARE VARIOUS PROGRAMS REGARDING HEALTHY EATING AND THE RISKS OF BEING OVERWEIGHT FOR BOTH ADULTS AND ADOLESCENTS.

CAREER COUNSELING, MENTORING AND JOB SHADOWING ARE ALSO OFFERED TO STUDENTS WHO EXPLORE CAREER POSSIBILITIES IN HEALTH CARE. CERTAIN PROGRAMS ARE GEARED TO LOW INCOME AND DIVERSE STUDENT POPULATIONS. PART VI, LINE 1 - DESCRIPTION FOR PART I, LINE 7G ADVOCATE HEALTH & HOSPITALS CORPORATION PROVIDES SUBSIDIZED HEALTH SERVICES TO THE COMMUNITY. THESE SERVICES ARE PROVIDED DESPITE CREATING A FINANCIAL LOSS FOR AHHC. THESE SERVICES ARE PROVIDED BECAUSE THEY MEET AN IDENTIFIED COMMUNITY NEED. IF AHHC DID NOT PROVIDE THE CLINICAL SERVICE, IT IS REASONABLE TO CONCLUDE THAT THESE SERVICES WOULD NOT BE AVAILABLE TO THE COMMUNITY. THE SERVICES INCLUDED ARE BOTH INPATIENT AND OUTPATIENT PROGRAMS FOR AIDS/HIV, TRAUMA, EMERGENCY, GERIATRICS, INFECTIOUS DISEASE, NEONATOLOGY, OB/NEWBORN, ORTHOPEDIC AND HOSPICE SERVICES. PART VI, LINE 1 - DESCRIPTION FOR PART I, LINE 7H AHHC CONDUCTS NUMEROUS RESEARCH ACTIVITIES FOR THE ADVANCEMENT OF MEDICAL AND HEALTH CARE SERVICES. HOWEVER, THE UNREIMBURSED COST OF SUCH RESEARCH ACTIVITIES IS NOT READILY DETERMINABLE AND NO AMOUNT IS BEING REPORTED FOR PURPOSES OF THE 2017 FORM 990, SCHEDULE H. PART VI, LINE 1 - DESCRIPTION FOR PART I, LINE 7, COLUMN (F) $149,300,541 OF BAD DEBT EXPENSE WAS INCLUDED ON FORM 990, PART IX, LINE 25, COLUMN (A), BUT WAS REMOVED FROM THE DENOMINATOR FOR PURPOSES OF SCHEDULE H, PART I, LINE 7, COLUMN (F). PART VI, LINE 1 - DESCRIPTION FOR PART II N/A PART VI, LINE 1 - DESCRIPTION FOR PART III, LINES 2, 3, AND 4 THE FOOTNOTES TO ADVOCATE HEALTH CARE NETWORK AND SUBSIDIARIES' AUDITED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS DO NOT SPECIFICALLY ADDRESS BAD DEBT EXPENSE; RATHER, THE FOOTNOTE DESCRIBES ADVOCATE'S PATIENT ACCOUNTS RECEIVABLE POLICY AND THE PERCENTAGE OF ACCOUNTS RECEIVABLE THAT THE ALLOWANCE FOR DOUBTFUL ACCOUNTS COVERS (SEE PAGE 11 OF THE AUDITED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS). FOR 2017, FOR AHHC, THE ALLOWANCE FOR DOUBTFUL ACCOUNTS COVERED 19.21% OF NET PATIENT ACCOUNTS RECEIVABLE. PATIENT ACCOUNTS RECEIVABLE ARE STATED AT NET REALIZABLE VALUE. AHHC EVALUATES THE COLLECTABILITY OF ITS ACCOUNTS RECEIVABLE BASED ON THE LENGTH OF TIME THE RECEIVABLE IS OUTSTANDING, PAYER CLASS, HISTORICAL COLLECTION EXPERIENCE, AND TRENDS IN HEALTH CARE INSURANCE PROGRAMS. ACCOUNTS RECEIVABLE ARE CHARGED TO THE ALLOWANCE FOR UNCOLLECTIBLE ACCOUNTS WHEN THEY ARE DEEMED UNCOLLECTIBLE. THE COSTING METHODOLOGY USED IN DETERMINING THE AMOUNTS REPORTED ON LINES 2 AND 3 IS BASED ON THE RATIO OF PATIENT CARE COST TO CHARGES. THE UNREIMBURSED COST OF BAD DEBT WAS CALCULATED BY APPLYING THE ORGANIZATION'S COST TO CHARGE RATIO FROM THE MEDICARE COST REPORTS (CMS 2252-96 WORKSHEET C, PART 1, PPS INPATIENT RATIOS) TO THE ORGANIZATION'S BAD DEBT PROVISION PER GENERALLY ACCEPTED ACCOUNTING PRINCIPLES, LESS ANY PATIENT OR THIRD PARTY PAYOR PAYMENTS RECEIVED. ADVOCATE MAKES EVERY EFFORT TO IDENTIFY THOSE PATIENTS WHO ARE ELIGIBLE FOR FINANCIAL ASSISTANCE BY STRICTLY ADHERING TO ITS FINANCIAL ASSISTANCE POLICY. WE BELIEVE THAT ADVOCATE HAS A POPULATION OF PATIENTS WHO ARE UNINSURED OR UNDERINSURED BUT WHO DO NOT COMPLETE THE FINANCIAL ASSISTANCE APPLICATION. THE ESTIMATED AMOUNT OF BAD DEBT EXPENSE (AT COST) WHICH COULD BE REASONABLY ATTRIBUTABLE TO PATIENTS WHO WOULD LIKELY QUALIFY FOR FINANCIAL ASSISTANCE UNDER THE ORGANIZATION'S FINANCIAL ASSISTANCE POLICY, IF SUFFICIENT INFORMATION HAD BEEN AVAILABLE TO MAKE A DETERMINATION OF THEIR ELIGIBILITY, WAS BASED UPON SELF PAY PATIENT ACCOUNTS WHICH HAD AMOUNTS WRITTEN OFF TO BAD DEBTS. OUR METHOD WAS TO BEGIN WITH THE SELF-PAY PORTION OF BAD DEBT EXPENSE PROVISION. THE SELF-PAY PORTION EXCLUDES THOSE PATIENTS WHO HAD FINANCIAL ASSISTANCE APPLICATIONS PENDING AT THE TIME OF SERVICE. THIS COST WAS THEN REDUCED BY CHARGES IDENTIFIED AS TRUE BAD DEBT EXPENSE, INCLUDING COPAYS FOR PATIENTS WHO QUALIFIED FOR LESS THAN 100% FINANCIAL ASSISTANCE. THE COST TO CHARGE RATIO WAS THEN APPLIED TO THE REMAINING CHARGES, TO DETERMINE THE VALUE (AT COST) OF PATIENT ACCOUNTS THAT DID NOT COMPLETE FINANCIAL COUNSELING AND WERE ASSIGNED TO BAD DEBT. WE BELIEVE THIS PROCESS IS A REASONABLE BASIS FOR OUR ESTIMATE. AS WE ARE ONLY CONSIDERING SELF-PAY ACCOUNTS WRITTEN OFF TO BAD DEBT FOR THIS ESTIMATE, THIS ESTIMATE DOES NOT INCLUDE THE IMMEDIATE 20% DISCOUNT TO CHARGES WHICH IS APPLIED TO ALL SELF-PAY PATIENTS. IT ALSO DOES NOT INCLUDE ACCOUNT BALANCES OR CO-PAYS OF NON-SELF PAY ACCOUNTS WHICH ARE WRITTEN OFF TO BAD DEBT WHEN THE PATIENT HAS NO OTHER FINANCIAL RESOURCES TO PAY THESE AMOUNTS AND THE PATIENT DOES NOT APPLY FOR FINANCIAL ASSISTANCE. BAD DEBT AMOUNTS HAVE BEEN EXCLUDED FROM OTHER COMMUNITY BENEFIT AMOUNTS REPORTED THROUGHOUT SCHEDULE H. PART VI, LINE 1 - DESCRIPTION FOR PART III, LINE 8 THE SHORTFALL OF $175,306,322 ON PART III, LINE 7 IS THE UNREIMBURSED COST OF PROVIDING SERVICES FOR MEDICARE PATIENTS AND SHOULD BE TREATED AS COMMUNITY BENEFIT BECAUSE PROVIDING THESE SERVICES WITHOUT REIMBURSEMENT LESSENS THE BURDENS OF GOVERNMENT OR OTHER CHARITIES THAT WOULD OTHERWISE BE NEEDED TO SERVE THE COMMUNITY. FOR ADVOCATE HEALTH AND HOSPITALS CORPORATION'S OPERATIONS, THE UNREIMBURSED COST OF MEDICARE WAS CALCULATED BY APPLYING THE ORGANIZATION'S COST TO CHARGE RATIO FROM THE MEDICARE COST REPORTS (CMS 2252-96 WORKSHEET C, PART 1, PPS INPATIENT RATIOS) AND FOR NON-HOSPITAL OPERATIONS THE COST TO CHARGE RATIO CALCULATED ON WORKSHEET 2 RATIO OF PATIENT CARE COST TO CHARGES TO THE ORGANIZATION'S MEDICARE, LESS ANY PATIENT OR THIRD PARTY PAYOR PAYMENTS AND/OR CONTRIBUTIONS RECEIVED THAT WERE DESIGNATED FOR THE PAYMENT OF MEDICARE PATIENT BILLS. PART VI, LINE 1 - DESCRIPTION FOR PART III, LINE 9B ADVOCATE HEALTH AND HOSPITALS CORPORATION MAINTAINS BOTH WRITTEN FINANCIAL ASSISTANCE AND BAD DEBT/COLLECTION POLICIES. THE BAD DEBT/COLLECTION POLICY DOES NOT APPLY TO THOSE PATIENTS KNOWN TO QUALIFY FOR FINANCIAL ASSISTANCE; THEREFORE SUCH PATIENTS ARE NOT SUBJECT TO COLLECTION PRACTICES."

THE KOREAN COMMUNITY ASSESSMENT, DESCRIBED EARLIER IN THE DOCUMENT, WAS AN ADDITIONAL WAY OF ASSESSING THE NEEDS OF THE KOREAN COMMUNITY. ADVOCATE CHILDRENS HOSPITAL WORKS CLOSELY WITH LOCAL SCHOOL DISTRICTS, SCHOOL NURSES, THE HOSPITALS FAMILY ADVISORY COUNCIL, THE PARTNERSHIP FOR RESILIENCE, THE HEALTHY SCHOOLS CAMPAIGN AND THE CHICAGO PUBLIC SCHOOLS OFFICE OF STUDENT WELLNESS TO IDENTIFY HEALTH ISSUES AFFECTING CHILDREN. HEALTHIER DES PLAINES AREA SURVEY AND PROJECT LUTHERAN GENERAL HOSPITAL LED HEALTHIER DES PLAINES AREA SURVEY AND PROJECT, MENTIONED ABOVE, IN 2015 AND IN 2016. THE COALITION WAS COMPRISED OF OVER 30 ORGANIZATIONS INCLUDING REPRESENTATIVES FROM LOCAL GOVERNMENT, POLICE/FIRE/PARAMEDICS, COMMUNITY-BASED AGENCIES, FAITH COMMUNITIES AND SCHOOLS. IN 2016, THE SURVEY WAS DISTRIBUTED TO 7,000 RANDOMIZED HOUSEHOLDS WITH 500 SURVEYS RETURNED. THE RESULTS WERE PRESENTED TO THE COMMUNITY THROUGH VARIOUS PRESENTATIONS TO COMMUNITY LEADERS AND ORGANIZATIONS, WITH THE MAYOR AND CITY COUNCIL INCLUDED. HEALTH IMPACT COLLABORATIVE OF COOK COUNTY (HICCC) SURVEYS AS PART OF THE HICCC CHNA, THE COLLABORATIVE COLLECTED APPROXIMATELY 5,200 RESIDENT SURVEYS, WHICH REFLECTED THE DIVERSITY OF COOK COUNTY. THE NORTH REGION HAD 1,700 SURVEYS RETURNED. OF THESE, 19 PERCENT IDENTIFIED AS HISPANIC/LATINO, THE SAME PERCENTAGE OF HISPANIC/LATINO IN LUTHERAN GENERAL HOSPITALS PRIMARY SERVICE AREA, MAKING THIS POPULATION THE HOSPITALS MOST DIVERSE. APPROXIMATELY EIGHT PERCENT OF THE NORTH REGION SURVEY RESPONDENTS IDENTIFIED AS POLISH AND SIX PERCENT AS KOREAN. HICCC ALSO CONDUCTED EIGHT FOCUS GROUPS IN THE NORTH REGION FOR CHNA INPUT FROM FALL 2015 THROUGH SPRING 2016. THE COLLABORATIVE ENSURED THAT THE FOCUS GROUPS INCLUDED POPULATIONS WHO ARE TYPICALLY UNDER-REPRESENTED IN COMMUNITY HEALTH NEEDS ASSESSMENTS. SOME EXAMPLES OF THE POPULATIONS INCLUDED ARE RACIAL AND ETHNIC MINORITIES, IMMIGRANTS, THE LGBQIA AND TRANSGENDER COMMUNITY, FORMERLY INCARCERATED INDIVIDUALS, VETERANS AND SENIORS. ADVOCATE GOOD SAMARITAN HOSPITAL GOOD SAMARITAN HOSPITAL HAS BEEN ACTIVELY ENGAGED IN THE IMPACT DUPAGE STEERING COMMITTEE, WHICH IDENTIFIES AND ADDRESSES THE COUNTYS HEALTH NEEDS THROUGH VARIOUS PARTNERSHIPS AND PROGRAMS. IMPACT DUPAGES TARGET COMMUNITIES OVERLAP WITH THE HOSPITALS PRIMARY SERVICE AREA, THEREFORE THE HEALTH NEEDS AND PRIORITIES ADDRESSED THROUGH IMPACT DUPAGE ALSO ADDRESS SOME OF THE HEALTH NEEDS OUTLINED IN THE HOSPITALS 2013-2016 CHNA. GOOD SAMARITAN HOSPITAL ALSO CONTINUES TO PARTICIPATE IN THE FIGHTING OBESITY REACHING A HEALTHY WEIGHT AMONG RESIDENTS OF DUPAGE (FORWARD) COALITION, WHICH ADDRESSES OBESITY AND HEALTHY LIFESTYLES AMONG RESIDENTS LIVING IN DUPAGE COUNTY. THE HOSPITAL IS A MEMBER OF FORWARDS HEALTHY HOSPITAL COALITION, WHICH IS A GROUP OF DUPAGE COUNTY HOSPITALS WORKING TO IMPROVE THE HEALTH AND WELLNESS OF EMPLOYEES, PATIENTS AND THEIR FAMILIES THROUGH CREATING A HEALTHY HOSPITAL ENVIRONMENT. IN 2016, THE HOSPITAL COMPLETED A CENTERS FOR DISEASE CONTROL AND PREVENTION (CDC) WORKSITE WELLNESS ASSESSMENT, WHICH SUPPORTED THE DEVELOPMENT OF THE HOSPITALS SODIUM REDUCTION ACTION PLAN. TO SUPPORT THE IMPLEMENTATION OF STRATEGIES, THE HOSPITAL WAS AWARDED A SODIUM REDUCTION MINI GRANT BY THE DUPAGE COUNTY HEALTH DEPARTMENT AND FORWARD. WITH GREAT TEAM EFFORT, THE GOOD SAMARITAN HOSPITAL BETTER FOR US COMMITTEE (THE HOSPITALS WORKSITE WELLNESS COMMITTEE) AND SODIUM REDUCTION SUB-COMMITTEE WERE ABLE TO SUCCESSFULLY IMPLEMENT ALL OF THE SODIUM REDUCTION ACTION PLAN STRATEGIES. AFFORDABLE HOUSING WAS IDENTIFIED AS A NEED FOR DUPAGE COUNTY BY THE IMPACT DUPAGE STEERING COMMITTEE. HOUSING CAN HAVE A MAJOR IMPACT ON HEALTH AND IS CONSIDERED A SOCIAL DETERMINANT OF HEALTH. THE HOSPITALS COMMUNITY HEALTH MANAGER IS A MEMBER OF THE IMPACT DUPAGE AFFORDABLE HOUSING SUBCOMMITTEE AND HAS BEEN VERY ENGAGED IN THE ASSESSMENT AND PLAN DEVELOPMENT PROCESS. AS A PART OF THE ASSESSMENT AND PLANNING PROCESS, THE SUBCOMMITTEE WORKED WITH THE CHICAGO METROPOLITAN AGENCY FOR PLANNING TO COMPLETE THE DUPAGE COUNTY AFFORDABLE HOUSING ASSESSMENT AND PLAN. THE HOSPITAL RECOGNIZES THE IMPORTANCE AND IMPACT OF SOCIAL DETERMINANTS OF HEALTH AND WILL CONTINUE TO PARTICIPATE AND BE ENGAGED IN THE DEVELOPMENT AND IMPLEMENTATION OF THE AFFORDABLE HOUSING PLAN. ADVOCATE GOOD SHEPHERD HOSPITAL IN ADDITION TO THE FORMAL SURVEYS CONDUCTED FOR THE ASSESSMENT, THE HOSPITAL PARTNERS WITH LOCAL COMMUNITY GROUPS AND CONGREGATIONS TO HELP ASSESS NEEDS AND PROVIDE RESOURCES TO IMPROVE THE HEALTH STATUS OF INDIVIDUALS WITHIN THESE GROUPS. THE MISSION AND SPIRITUAL CARE TEAM AT THE HOSPITAL WORK CLOSELY WITH SEVERAL COMMUNITY CONGREGATIONS TO SURVEY AND RESPOND TO SPECIFIC NEEDS IDENTIFIED THROUGH THIS PROCESS.

ADVOCATE SOUTH SUBURBAN HOSPITAL HEALTH IMPACT COLLABORATIVE OF COOK COUNTY (NOW NAMED THE ALLIANCE FOR HEALTH EQUITY) SOUTH SUBURBAN HOSPITAL IS A MEMBER OF THE HEALTH IMPACT COLLABORATIVE OF COOK COUNTY (HICCC). HICCC IS A PARTNERSHIP OF HOSPITALS, HEALTH DEPARTMENTS AND COMMUNITY ORGANIZATIONS WORKING TO ASSESS COMMUNITY HEALTH NEEDS AND ASSETS, AND TO IMPLEMENT A SHARED PLAN TO MAXIMIZE HEALTH EQUITY AND WELLNESS IN CHICAGO AND COOK COUNTY. THIS COLLABORATIVE WAS DEVELOPED SO THAT PARTICIPATING ORGANIZATIONS COULD EFFICIENTLY SHARE RESOURCES AND WORK TOGETHER ON DATA COLLECTION, PRIORITY SETTING AND IMPLEMENTATION PLANNING. COOK COUNTY WAS DIVIDED INTO NORTH, CENTRAL AND SOUTH REGIONS TO ENABLE THE INVOLVEMENT OF OTHER LOCAL STAKEHOLDERS AND IDENTIFY THE LOCAL NEEDS OF THIS DIVERSE COUNTY. SOUTH SUBURBAN HOSPITAL PARTICIPATED IN THE HICCC SOUTH REGION ASSESSMENT. THE METHODOLOGY FOR THE CHNA HAD THREE COMPONENTS: 1) THE MAPP PROCESS USED BY THE HEALTH IMPACT COLLABORATIVE OF COOK COUNTY (2/2015-6/2016); 2) USE OF THE HEALTHY COMMUNITIES INSTITUTE (HCI) PLATFORM TO REVIEW COUNTY, SERVICE AREA AND ZIP CODE DATA (3/2014-8/2016); AND 3) REVIEW OF OTHER AVAILABLE NATIONAL AND LOCAL DATA (1/2016-8/2016). MAPP PROCESS THE HEALTH IMPACT COLLABORATIVE OF COOK COUNTY (HICCC) CONDUCTED A COLLABORATIVE CHNA BETWEEN FEBRUARY 2015 AND JUNE 2016. THE ILLINOIS PUBLIC HEALTH INSTITUTE (IPHI) DESIGNED AND FACILITATED A COLLABORATIVE, COMMUNITY-ENGAGED ASSESSMENT BASED ON THE MOBILIZING FOR ACTION THROUGH PLANNING AND PARTNERSHIPS (MAPP) FRAMEWORK. MAPP IS A COMMUNITY-DRIVEN STRATEGIC PLANNING FRAMEWORK THAT WAS DEVELOPED BY THE NATIONAL ASSOCIATION FOR COUNTY AND CITY HEALTH OFFICIALS (NACCHO) AND THE CENTERS FOR DISEASE CONTROL AND PREVENTION (CDC). BOTH THE CHICAGO AND COOK COUNTY DEPARTMENTS OF PUBLIC HEALTH USE THE MAPP FRAMEWORK FOR COMMUNITY HEALTH ASSESSMENT AND PLANNING. THE MAPP FRAMEWORK PROMOTES A SYSTEM FOCUS, EMPHASIZING THE IMPORTANCE OF COMMUNITY ENGAGEMENT, PARTNERSHIP DEVELOPMENT AND THE DYNAMIC INTERPLAY OF FACTORS AND FORCES WITHIN THE PUBLIC HEALTH SYSTEM. THE HEALTH IMPACT COLLABORATIVE OF COOK COUNTY CHOSE THIS INCLUSIVE, COMMUNITY-DRIVEN PROCESS SO THAT THE ASSESSMENT AND IDENTIFICATION OF PRIORITY HEALTH ISSUES WOULD BE INFORMED BY THE DIRECT PARTICIPATION OF STAKEHOLDERS AND COMMUNITY RESIDENTS. THE MAPP FRAMEWORK EMPHASIZES PARTNERSHIPS AND COLLABORATION TO UNDERSCORE THE CRITICAL IMPORTANCE OF SHARED RESOURCES AND RESPONSIBILITY TO MAKE THE VISION FOR A HEALTHY FUTURE A REALITY. HICCC USED THE COUNTY HEALTH RANKINGS MODEL TO GUIDE THE SELECTION OF ASSESSMENT INDICATORS. IPHI WORKED WITH THE HEALTH DEPARTMENTS, HOSPITALS, AND COMMUNITY STAKEHOLDERS TO IDENTIFY AVAILABLE DATA RELATED TO HEALTH OUTCOMES, HEALTH BEHAVIORS, CLINICAL CARE, PHYSICAL ENVIRONMENT, AND SOCIAL AND ECONOMIC FACTORS. THE COLLABORATIVE DECIDED TO ADD MENTAL HEALTH AS AN ADDITIONAL CATEGORY OF DATA INDICATORS. AS PART OF CONTINUING EFFORTS TO ALIGN AND INTEGRATE COMMUNITY HEALTH ASS"

COMMUNITY INFORMATION","DEFINITION OF COMMUNITY ADVOCATE CHRIST MEDICAL CENTER LOCATED IN OAK LAWN, ILLINOIS, CHRIST MEDICAL CENTER SERVES AN AREA THAT LIES PRIMARILY WITHIN COOK COUNTY AND THE CHICAGO CITY LIMITS. IN ADDITION TO PARTICIPATING IN THE HEALTH IMPACT COLLABORATIVE OF COOK COUNTY SOUTH REGION CHNA, CHRIST MEDICAL CENTER CONDUCTED A COMMUNITY HEALTH NEEDS ASSESSMENT TARGETING ITS DEFINED COMMUNITY - THE HOSPITALS PRIMARY SERVICE AREA (PSA). THIS AREA INCLUDES APPROXIMATELY 947,915 INDIVIDUALS WITHIN 27 ZIP CODES IN CHICAGO AND SUBURBAN COOK COUNTY. THE DIVERSE POPULATION SERVED IS 59% WHITE, 23% AFRICAN-AMERICAN, 2% ASIAN AND 13% OTHER. BY ETHNICITY, THE PSA IS 29.4% HISPANIC. NEARLY 17% OF THE PSA POPULATION OVER THE AGE OF 25 DOES NOT HAVE A HIGH SCHOOL DIPLOMA AS COMPARED TO 12% FOR ILLINOIS, WHILE ALMOST 13% OF ALL FAMILIES LIVE BELOW THE FEDERAL POVERTY LEVEL COMPARED TO 11% FOR ILLINOIS. THE MEDIAN AGE FOR THE PSA IS 37.56 YEARS. CHRIST MEDICAL CENTER HAS FOUR ZIP CODES IN ITS PRIMARY SERVICE AREA WITH A RANKING OF FIVE FOR THE SOCIONEEDS INDEX - ALL WITHIN CHICAGO - WHICH REPRESENT THE AREAS WITH THE HIGHEST SOCIOECONOMIC NEEDS: WEST ENGLEWOOD (99.2), BRIGHTON PARK (96.3), CHICAGO LAWN (97.6), AND AUBURN GRESHAM (95.3). THE INDEX VALUES EACH OF THESE ZIP CODES ARE OVER 90/100, THUS REPRESENTING SOME OF THE HIGHEST AREAS OF NEED IN THE COUNTRY. ADVOCATE CHILDRENS HOSPITAL, WHICH IS INTEGRATED AS PART OF ADVOCATE CHRIST HOSPITAL IN OAK LAWN AND ADVOCATE LUTHERAN GENERAL HOSPITAL IN PARK RIDGE, HAS A TOTAL SERVICE AREA (TSA) THAT INCLUDES COMMUNITIES SERVED BY CHRIST MEDICAL CENTER, AS WELL AS GEOGRAPHIC AREAS OR COMMUNITIES SERVED BY ADVOCATE TRINITY HOSPITAL ON CHICAGOS SOUTH AND SOUTHEAST SIDES, ADVOCATE SOUTH SUBURBAN HOSPITAL IN CHICAGOS SOUTH SUBURBS, AND ADVOCATE GOOD SAMARITAN HOSPITAL IN THE WEST AND SOUTHWEST SUBURBAN CHICAGO AREA. THE TOTAL PEDIATRIC POPULATION, AGES 0-17 YEARS, WITHIN THE CHILDRENS HOSPITAL OAK LAWN TSA IS 591,263 CHILDREN IN 77 COMMUNITIES OR 25% OF THE TOTAL POPULATION WITHIN THE SAME AREA. THE HOSPITALS DIVERSE SERVICE AREA IS 37% BLACK/NON-HISPANIC, 35% WHITE/NON-HISPANIC AND 24% HISPANIC. WITHIN THE TSA, 56.3% OF ADVOCATE CHILDRENS HOSPITAL PATIENTS (CHILDREN AGES 0-17) RECEIVE MEDICAID, 38.9% ARE COVERED BY MANAGED CARE HEALTH INSURANCE AND 4.5% HAVE OTHER PAYMENT PLANS. HOUSEHOLD INCOME STATISTICS SHOW THAT 26% OF HOUSEHOLDS IN THE TSA EARN LESS THAN $25,000/YEAR AND 46% HAVE A HIGH SCHOOL EDUCATION OR LESS.

JOSEPH MEDICAL CENTER, ROSELAND COMMUNITY HOSPITAL, SILVER CROSS HOSPITAL, SOUTH SHORE HOSPITAL, ST. ANTHONY HOSPITAL, ST. BERNARD HOSPITAL AND UNIVERSITY OF CHICAGO MEDICAL CENTER. HIGH RISK AREAS AND COMMUNITIES OF HIGH NEED WERE FURTHER DETERMINED BY USE OF THE SOCIAL VULNERABILITY INDEX, WHICH IS AN AGGREGATE MEASURE OF THE CAPACITY OF COMMUNITIES TO PREPARE FOR AND RESPOND TO EXTERNAL STRESSORS ON HUMAN HEALTH, SUCH AS NATURAL OR HUMAN-CAUSED DISASTERS, OR DISEASE OUTBREAKS. THE SOCIAL VULNERABILITY INDEX RANKS EACH CENSUS TRACT ON 14 SOCIAL FACTORS, INCLUDING POVERTY, LACK OF VEHICLE ACCESS AND CROWDED HOUSING. COMMUNITIES WITH HIGH SOCIAL VULNERABILITY INDEX SCORES HAVE LESS CAPACITY TO DEAL WITH OR PREPARE FOR EXTERNAL STRESSORS AND, AS A RESULT, ARE MORE VULNERABLE TO THREATS ON HUMAN HEALTH. MANY COMMUNITIES IN ADVOCATE CHILDRENS HOSPITALS TSA RANK HIGH IN SOCIAL VULNERABILITY WHICH CAN HAVE A NEGATIVE IMPACT ON CHILDRENS HEALTH. SUCH COMMUNITIES INCLUDE BLUE ISLAND, CALUMET PARK, DIXMOOR, FORD HEIGHTS AND HARVEY IN THE SOUTH SUBURBS, ALONG WITH THE CHICAGO LAWN, ENGLEWOOD AND GAGE PARK NEIGHBORHOODS IN CHICAGO. ANOTHER MEASURE IN DETERMINING NEED WAS THE CHILDHOOD OPPORTUNITY INDEX WHICH IS BASED ON SEVERAL INDICATORS IN EACH OF THE FOLLOWING CATEGORIES: DEMOGRAPHICS AND DIVERSITY; EARLY CHILDHOOD EDUCATION; RESIDENTIAL AND SCHOOL SEGREGATION; MATERNAL AND CHILD HEALTH; NEIGHBORHOOD CHARACTERISTICS OF CHILDREN; AND CHILD POVERTY. CHILDREN WHO LIVE IN AREAS OF LOW OPPORTUNITY HAVE AN INCREASED RISK FOR A VARIETY OF NEGATIVE HEALTH INDICATORS, SUCH AS PREMATURE MORTALITY, ARE MORE LIKELY TO BE EXPOSED TO SERIOUS PSYCHOLOGICAL DISTRESS AND ARE MORE LIKELY TO HAVE POOR SCHOOL PERFORMANCE. COMMUNITIES IN THE ADVOCATE CHILDRENS HOSPITAL TSA INCLUDE FORD HEIGHTS, DIXMOOR, DOLTON AND HARVEY IN THE SOUTH SUBURBS, AS WELL AS THE ARCHER HEIGHTS, AUBURN-GRESHAM, BRIGHTON PARK AND CHICAGO LAWN NEIGHBORHOODS IN CHICAGO.

THE PRIMARY SERVICE AREA (PSA) DESIGNATION IS DETERMINED BY THE ADVOCATE HEALTH CARE STRATEGIC PLANNING DEPARTMENT, GENERALLY NOTED AS THE GEOGRAPHIC AREA WHERE 75 PERCENT OF PATIENTS RESIDE. ALL 25 LUTHERAN GENERAL HOSPITAL PSA ZIP CODE COMMUNITIES IN COOK COUNTY WERE PART OF THE GEOGRAPHIC AREA WITHIN THE NORTH REGION OF HICCC. SOCIOECONOMIC NEED WAS DETERMINED BY THE HEALTHY COMMUNITIES INSTITUTES (HCI) CALCULATIONS TO CREATE AN INDEX USING SIX MAJOR SOCIONEEDS INDICATORS THAT ARE CORRELATED WITH POOR HEALTH OUTCOMES. THE INDICATORS INCLUDE INCOME, UNEMPLOYMENT, OCCUPATION, EDUCATION, LANGUAGE AND POVERTY. LUTHERAN GENERAL HOSPITALS PSA INCLUDES THE FOLLOWING COMMUNITIES, LISTED IN ORDER FROM GREATEST NEED TO LOWEST NEED COMMUNITIES: IRVING PARK/PORTAGE (60641), DUNNING (60634), DES PLAINES (60018), ELMWOOD PARK (60707), HARWOOD HEIGHTS (60706), JEFFERSON PARK (60630), PALATINE (60074), MOUNT PROSPECT (60656), NILES (60714), SKOKIE (60077), PROSPECT HEIGHTS (60070), WHEELING (60090), DES PLAINES (60016), SKOKIE (60076), MORTON GROVE (60053), HARWOOD HEIGHTS (60056), NORWOOD PARK (60631), ARLINGTON HEIGHTS (60005), FOREST GLEN (60646), ARLINGTON HEIGHTS (60004), GLENVIEW (60025), PARK RIDGE (60068), BUFFALO GROVE (60089), PALATINE (60067), NORTHBROOK (60062), GLENVIEW (60026), LAKE ZURICH (60047) AND DEERFIELD (60015).

IN 1993, ADVOCATE BROMENN MEDICAL CENTER PARTNERED WITH OSF HEALTHCARE ST. JOSEPH MEDICAL CENTER, ALSO LOCATED IN MCLEAN COUNTY, TO OPEN THE COMMUNITY HEALTH CARE CLINIC. THE COMMUNITY HEALTH CARE CLINIC PROVIDES SERVICES TO THE MEDICALLY UNDERSERVED POPULATION OF MCLEAN COUNTY TO ENSURE THAT ALL POPULATIONS IN THE COMMUNITY HAVE ACCESS TO HEALTHCARE. TO BE ELIGIBLE FOR CARE AT THE CLINIC, AN INDIVIDUAL MUST HAVE A TOTAL HOUSEHOLD INCOME LESS THAN 185 PERCENT OF FEDERAL POVERTY GUIDELINES, HAVE NO ACCESS TO THIRD PARTY INSURANCE (MEDICAID, MEDICARE, ALL KIDS, VETERAN'S BENEFITS, DISABILITY OR EMPLOYER-SPONSORED INSURANCE) AND RESIDE IN MCLEAN COUNTY. ALL EMERGENCY ROOM VISITS, DIAGNOSTIC TESTING AND HOSPITAL SERVICES ARE PROVIDED FREE OF CHARGE BY ADVOCATE BROMENN MEDICAL CENTER AND OSF HEALTHCARE ST. JOSEPH MEDICAL CENTER. THE COMMUNITY HEALTH CARE CLINIC SAW 1,022 PATIENTS IN 2017, PROVIDED 2,941 PATIENT VISITS AND PRESCRIBED OVER 21,775 PRESCRIPTION MEDICATIONS AT NO CHARGE TO UNINSURED INDIVIDUALS. THE CLINIC IS IN A BUILDING OWNED BY ADVOCATE BROMENN MEDICAL CENTER, FOR WHICH THE HOSPITAL PAID $81,191 FOR THE MAINTENANCE AND UPKEEP OF THE FACILITY IN 2017. IN ADDITION TO THE ABOVE, ADVOCATE BROMENN MEDICAL CENTER SERVES AS AN EMERGENCY MEDICAL SERVICES (EMS) RESOURCE FOR EDUCATION AND TRAINING FOR MCLEAN COUNTY, PROVIDING A $293,951 BENEFIT TO THE COMMUNITY. THE HOSPITAL ALSO CONTRIBUTES TO THE HEALTH OF THE COMMUNITY BY MAINTAINING AND OFFERING COMMUNITY MEMBERS, NURSING STUDENTS, RESIDENTS, PHYSICIANS AND OTHER HEALTH CARE PROFESSIONALS ACCESS TO THE A.E. LIVINGSTON HEALTH SERVICES LIBRARY. THIS ACCESS IS PROVIDED FREE OF CHARGE TO THESE INDIVIDUALS. THE COST OF THIS SERVICE, IN 2017 $103,461, WAS ABSORBED BY THE HOSPITAL. ADVOCATE BROMENN MEDICAL CENTER ALSO PROVIDES A GREAT BENEFIT TO THE COMMUNITY BY PAYING FOR ATHLETIC TRAINERS TO ASSIST AT AREA SCHOOLS TO AID IN THEIR ATHLETIC PROGRAMS. THE COST TO THE HOSPITAL TO PROVIDE THIS SERVICE FROM JANUARY-JULY 2017 WAS $75,939. THE PROGRAM WAS DISCONTINUED IN JULY 2017. ADVOCATE BROMENN MEDICAL CENTER IS ALSO AN AMERICAN HEART ASSOCIATION TRAINING CENTER FOR THE COMMUNITY. THE COST OF PROVIDING THIS SERVICE IS $43,697. THE NUMEROUS OTHER WAYS ADVOCATE BROMENN MEDICAL CENTER PROMOTES THE HEALTH OF THE COMMUNITY RANGE FROM PROVIDING PET THERAPY AND CLINICAL PASTORAL EDUCATION PROGRAMS TO OFFERING MEETING SPACE TO COMMUNITY NOT-FOR-PROFIT GROUPS AND BEING A TEACHING HOSPITAL FOR BOTH FAMILY PRACTICE, NEUROLOGY AND NEUROSURGERY RESIDENTS. ADVOCATE BROMENN MEDICAL CENTER HAD A FEW SIGNIFICANT CAPITAL PROJECTS THAT BEGAN OR WERE COMPLETED IN 2017 THAT IMPROVED PATIENT CARE OR CONTRIBUTED TO A HEALTHIER COMMUNITY ENVIRONMENT. IN 2017, CAPITAL FUNDS WERE ALLOCATED FOR THE RENOVATION AND EXPANSION OF THE INPATIENT MENTAL HEALTH UNIT. THE UNIT IS LICENSED FOR 19 BEDS, BUT CAPS BED CAPACITY AT 12 BEDS DUE TO THE CONDITION AND PHYSICAL CONSTRAINTS OF THE EXISTING SPACE.

201843189349304009,362169147,"PART VI, LINE 6. AFFILIATED HEALTH CARE SYSTEM","IN SERVICE OF ITS MISSION, ADVOCATE HEALTH CARE SUPPORTS SYSTEM-WIDE PROGRAMS THAT ADDRESS THE HEALTH NEEDS OF PATIENTS, FAMILIES AND THE COMMUNITIES SERVED. ADVOCATE HEALTH CARE'S BOARD OF DIRECTORS, SENIOR LEADERSHIP AND ASSOCIATES (EMPLOYEES) ARE COMMITTED TO POSITIVELY AFFECTING THE HEALTH STATUS AND QUALITY OF LIFE OF INDIVIDUALS AND POPULATIONS IN COMMUNITIES SERVED BY ADVOCATE THROUGH PROGRAMS AND PRACTICES THAT REFLECT ADVOCATES WHOLISTIC PHILOSOPHY. TO THAT END, THEY CONTINUE TO DEVELOP AND SUPPORT INITIATIVES THAT ENHANCE ACCESS TO HEALTH AND WELLNESS SERVICES WITHIN THE DIVERSE COMMUNITIES THAT ADVOCATE SERVES. SYSTEM LEADERSHIP DIRECTS AND SUPPORTS THE HOSPITALS IN THEIR EFFORTS TO ADDRESS IDENTIFIED COMMUNITY HEALTH NEEDS. ADVOCATE HEALTH CARE CREATED A COMMUNITY HEALTH DEPARTMENT IN 2016, LED BY A SYSTEM EXECUTIVE AND STAFFED WITH PUBLIC/COMMUNITY HEALTH SPECIALISTS TO EXECUTE COMMUNITY NEEDS ASSESSMENTS, EVIDENCE BASED PROGRAM DEVELOPMENT AND COLLABORATIVE PARTNERSHIPS WITHIN THE COMMUNITIES SERVED BY ADVOCATE. PRIOR TO THIS TIME, THE COMMUNITY FACING FUNCTION WAS LED BY A TEAM OF SYSTEM-LEVEL INDIVIDUALS WHOSE JOB RESPONSIBILITIES INCLUDED VARIOUS COMMUNITY ROLES MORE CLOSELY ALIGNED WITH COMMUNITY RELATIONS. DURING THE INITIAL 2011-2013 COMMUNITY HEALTH NEEDS ASSESSMENT (CHNA) CYCLE, THE SYSTEM LEADERS PROVIDED OVERSIGHT AND SUPPORT TO THE HOSPITALS FOR DEVELOPING THEIR CHNAS AND SUBSEQUENT PROGRAMMING. IN 2016, ADVOCATES NEW COMMUNITY HEALTH TEAM CONDUCTED COMPREHENSIVE CHNAS (2014-2016) AND POSTED GOVERNANCE-APPROVED CHNA REPORTS AND CHNA IMPLEMENTATION PLANS ON ADVOCATE'S WEBPAGE IN COMPLIANCE WITH THE AFFORDABLE CARE ACT. AT THE DIRECTION OF THE SYSTEM LEVEL, COMMUNITY HEALTH DEPARTMENT LEADERSHIP ALSO MET MONTHLY IN LATE 2016 THROUGH FIRST QUARTER 2017 TO SIGNIFICANTLY REVISE ADVOCATE HEALTH CARE'S COMMUNITY BENEFITS PLAN. THE PLANS GOALS AND OBJECTIVES WERE CRAFTED AND EXPANDED TO BUILD ON RECENT LEARNINGS AND INCREASED FOCUS ON COMMUNITY HEALTH. THE PLAN'S BROAD GOALS AND OBJECTIVES WERE DESIGNED TO STRUCTURE SYSTEM-WIDE COMMUNITY BENEFITS ACTIVITIES WITHIN A STRATEGIC FRAMEWORK. INCLUDED IN THE COMMUNITY BENEFITS PLAN ARE GOALS FOCUSED ON SYSTEM-WIDE EFFORTS TO ADDRESS THE BROADER ISSUES OF DISPARITY AND ACCESS, AND TO ALIGN HOSPITAL COMMUNITY HEALTH PLANS WITH SYSTEM STRATEGY AS COMMUNITY HEALTH PLANS AND IMPLEMENTATION STRATEGIES EVOLVE. ADVOCATE'S COMMUNITY BENEFITS PLAN ALSO SETS THE COURSE FOR STRENGTHENING EXISTING PARTNERSHIPS AND BUILDING NEW ONES TO LEVERAGE AND MAXIMIZE THE IMPACT OF ADVOCATES PROGRAMS IN ITS SERVICE AREAS. ADVOCATE'S COMMUNITY BENEFITS PLAN GOALS AND SPECIFIC EXAMPLES OF PROGRAMS AND SERVICES THAT ARE DIRECTED AND MANAGED AT THE SYSTEM LEVEL ARE PROVIDED BELOW. GOAL A: OPTIMIZE ADVOCATE'S CAPACITY TO MANAGE AN EFFECTIVE COMMUNITY HEALTH STRATEGY BY IMPLEMENTING REGULAR COMMUNITY HEALTH ASSESSMENTS (CHNAS) AND USING DATA FROM THESE ASSESSMENTS TO GUIDE PROGRAM DEVELOPMENT. DURING 2016, ALL ELEVEN ADVOCATE HEALTH CARE HOSPITALS COMPLETED COMPREHENSIVE COMMUNITY HEALTH NEEDS ASSESSMENTS IN COLLABORATION WITH HEALTH DEPARTMENTS, OTHER HOSPITALS, AND COMMUNITY ORGANIZATIONS. ADVOCATE CHILDRENS HOSPITAL, WITH INTEGRATED SITES AT BOTH ADVOCATE LUTHERAN GENERAL HOSPITAL AND ADVOCATE CHRIST MEDICAL CENTER, CONTRIBUTED TO ASSESSMENTS AT THOSE TWO HOSPITALS. ALL THE ADVOCATE HOSPITAL ASSESSMENTS ARE AVAILABLE THROUGH THE ADVOCATE HEALTH CARE WEBSITE AT: HTTP://WWW.ADVOCATEHEALTH.COM/CHNAREPORTS AS A FIRST STEP TOWARD DEVELOPING A 2017-2019 IMPLEMENTATION PLAN, THE SYSTEM DIRECTED THE HOSPITAL COMMUNITY HEALTH LEADERS AND STAFF TO IDENTIFY THE STRENGTHS AND OPPORTUNITIES FOR IMPROVEMENT WITHIN THE JUST COMPLETED CYCLE (2014-2016), AS WELL AS IDEAS FOR NEW DATA SOURCES, AND NEEDS FOR PROFESSIONAL DEVELOPMENT RELATED TO THE OVERALL CHNA PROCESS. A NUMBER OF STRENGTHS WERE IDENTIFIED INCLUDING DEVELOPMENT OF LOCAL COMMUNITY HEALTH COUNCILS (CHC), INVOLVEMENT OF HOSPITAL GOVERNING COUNCIL MEMBERS IN THE CHCS, PARTNERSHIPS WITH HEALTH DEPARTMENTS, DATA FROM THE HEALTHY COMMUNITIES INSTITUTE, ESPECIALLY THE ZIP CODE LEVEL HOSPITALIZATION AND EMERGENCY ROOM UTILIZATION DATA, AND THE SHARING OF TEMPLATES AND APPROACHES ACROSS HOSPITAL SITES. ADDITIONAL PROFESSIONAL DEVELOPMENT REGARDING DATA RETRIEVAL, ANALYSIS, AND SUMMARIZATION AS WELL AS PROGRAM DEVELOPMENT WERE IDENTIFIED. A PROFESSIONAL DEVELOPMENT PLAN WAS IMPLEMENTED FOR ALL INTERNAL COMMUNITY HEALTH STAFF IN 2017. CHNA DATA TRAINING WAS CONDUCTED USING THE HEALTHY COMMUNITIES INSTITUTE (HCI) PLATFORM WITH THE TEAM RECEIVING TRAINING REGARDING RUNNING VARIOUS TYPES OF REPORTS AND CROSS COMPARING DATA IN HCI. UPDATE PRESENTATIONS WERE HELD AT SELECTED MONTHLY STAFF MEETINGS REGARDING NEW CAPACITIES OF THE HCI PLATFORM FOR REPORTS AND DATA PRESENTATION. ADDITIONALLY, ALL STAFF PROVIDED INPUT REGARDING TRAINING NEEDS RESULTING IN THE ESTABLISHMENT OF A SET OF MINIMUM STANDARD DATA REQUIREMENTS ADVOCATE WILL BE USING FOR THE NEXT CHNA CYCLE. COMMUNITY HEALTH STAFF PULLED DATA AS PART OF LEARNING EXERCISES AND SHARED FINDINGS FROM THEIR UNIQUE SERVICE AREAS WITH PEERS IN A PEER REVIEW MODEL. IN 2018, THE TRAINING FOCUS WILL BE ON DATA ANALYSIS, DATA INTERPRETATION AND PROGRAM DEVELOPMENT AND EVALUATION. GOAL B: UNDERTAKE OR SUPPORT INITIATIVES THAT ENHANCE ACCESS TO HEALTH CARE, PREVENTION AND WELLNESS SERVICES ACROSS THE LIFESPAN AND WITHIN THE DIVERSE COMMUNITIES ADVOCATE SERVES. CHARITY CARE AS A NON-PROFIT HEALTH CARE SYSTEM, ADVOCATE PROVIDES CHARITY AND FINANCIAL ASSISTANCE TO PATIENTS IN NEED. ALTHOUGH ADVOCATES SYSTEM-WIDE CHARITY CARE POLICY IS VERY GENEROUS, ADVOCATE CONTINUES TO REVIEW AND REFINE ITS POLICY IN AN ONGOING EFFORT TO ENSURE THAT FINANCIAL ASSISTANCE IS AVAILABLE TO THOSE IN NEED IN A TIMELY MANNER. WHILE EACH HOSPITAL HAS A CHARITY CARE COUNCIL TO REVIEW APPLICATIONS AND DETERMINE ELIGIBILITY, SYSTEM FINANCE LEADERS ARE RESPONSIBLE FOR ONGOING POLICY REVIEW AND REFINEMENTS TO ASSURE THAT ADVOCATE CONTINUES TO PROVIDE FINANCIAL ASSISTANCE TO INDIVIDUALS WHO NEED HELP, WHEN THEY NEED IT. FEDERALLY QUALIFIED HEALTH CENTERS IN ADDITION, ADVOCATES SYSTEM LEADERS ENCOURAGE AND SUPPORT ITS HOSPITALS INITIATIVES TO PARTNER WITH FEDERALLY QUALIFIED HEALTH CENTERS (FQHC), PUBLIC HEALTH DEPARTMENTS AND COMMUNITY CLINICS IN ORDER TO ASSIST THE UNINSURED IN FINDING INSURANCE COVERAGE AND MEDICAL SERVICES. FOR EXAMPLE, ADVOCATE SOUTH SUBURBAN HOSPITAL HAS A PARTNERSHIP WITH AUNT MARTHAS YOUTH SERVICE CENTER, AN FQHC, TO IMPROVE ACCESS TO PRIMARY CARE SERVICES FOR UNINSURED AND UNDERINSURED INDIVIDUALS IN ITS SERVICE AREA. ADVOCATE BROMENN MEDICAL CENTER MAINTAINS A COMMUNITY HEALTH CLINIC IN COLLABORATION WITH OSF ST. JOSEPHS HOSPITAL, WHEREBY ADVOCATE BROMENN MEDICAL CENTER IS RESPONSIBLE FOR A PORTION OF THE HOSPITAL CARE FOR THE CLINIC PATIENTS HOSPITAL CARE THROUGHOUT THE YEAR. BROMENN IS ALSO THE SOLE PROVIDER OF THE CLINICS INFORMATION TECHNOLOGY (IT) SUPPORT AND PROVIDES THE SPACE OCCUPIED BY THE CLINIC. IN ADDITION, BROMENN MEDICAL CENTER, THROUGH AN INFORMAL REFERRAL AGREEMENT IN PLACE SINCE 2010, COLLABORATES WITH CHESTNUT HEALTH SYSTEMS. CHESTNUT HEALTH SYSTEMS OWNS AND OPERATES AN FQHC IN BLOOMINGTON AND PATIENTS ARE SOMETIMES REFERRED TO BROMENN MEDICAL CENTER FOR SERVICES. WORKING WITH OTHER AREA HOSPITALS, ADVOCATE GOOD SAMARITAN HOSPITAL PROVIDES SUPPORT THROUGH THE DUPAGE HEALTH COALITION TO SUSTAIN THE ACCESS DUPAGE COMMUNITY PROGRAM A COMMUNITY COLLABORATION DESIGNED TO PROVIDE LOW-COST PRIMARY MEDICAL CARE SERVICES TO THE LOW-INCOME, MEDICALLY UNINSURED RESIDENTS OF DUPAGE COUNTY.

ADVOCATE HEALTH CARE ALSO WORKS TO IMPROVE THE PROVISION OF SERVICES TO INDIVIDUALS AND FAMILIES WHO ARE COVERED BY MEDICARE AND MEDICAID AND SEEK SERVICES FROM ADVOCATE'S OVER 400 SITES OF CARE. ADVOCATE COLLABORATES WITH VARIOUS COMMUNITY-BASED ORGANIZATIONS (CBOS) AND FQHC'S IN INNOVATIVE WAYS TO ESTABLISH PRIMARY CARE RELATIONSHIPS FOR MEDICAID AND UNINSURED PATIENTS. ADVOCATE ACCOUNTABLE CARE ENTITY (ACE) AS ONE OF THE LARGEST PROVIDERS OF HEALTH CARE SERVICES TO MEDICARE AND MEDICAID PATIENTS IN CHICAGO AND THE SURROUNDING SUBURBS, ADVOCATE HEALTH CARE'S MEDICAID ACCOUNTABLE CARE ORGANIZATION (ACO), ALSO KNOWN AS THE ADVOCATE ACCOUNTABLE CARE ENTITY, TRANSITIONED TO MERIDIAN FAMILY HEALTH PLAN (FHP) OF ILLINOIS AS PART OF AN INTEGRATED CARE MODEL ON APRIL 1, 2016. THE ADVOCATE/MERIDIAN FHP PARTNERSHIP AND COLLABORATION WAS DRIVEN LARGELY BY CHANGES TO THE MEDICAID PROGRAM IN ILLINOIS AND WAS DESIGNED TO ENSURE CURRENT MEDICAID MEMBERS CONTINUE TO RECEIVE HIGH-QUALITY AND WELL-COORDINATED CARE DELIVERED"

THE FIRST RELEASE OF THE BOOK OCCURRED AT AN EVENT AT CHICAGO THEOLOGICAL SEMINARY AND WAS PLANNED AND EXECUTED BY ADVOCATE HEALTH CARE STAFF AND STAFF OF THE CENTER FOR FAITH AND COMMUNITY HEALTH TRANSFORMATION. STAKEHOLDER HEALTH ASPIRES TO IDENTIFY AND ACTIVATE A MENU OF PROVEN COMMUNITY HEALTH PRACTICES AND PARTNERSHIPS THAT WORK FROM THE TOP OF THE MISSION STATEMENT TO THE BOTTOM LINE. SPARKED BY A SERIES OF STAKEHOLDER MEETINGS AT THE WHITE HOUSE WITH REPRESENTATIVES OF THE DEPARTMENT OF HEALTH & HUMAN SERVICES CENTER FOR FAITH-BASED & NEIGHBORHOOD PARTNERSHIPS, THE GROUP IS A SELF-ORGANIZED LEARNING COLLABORATIVE OF OVER 50 HOSPITALS AND HEALTH SYSTEMS THAT HAVE ENGAGED IN A SERIES OF MEETINGS ACROSS THE COUNTRY OVER THE PAST FOUR YEARS. MEMBERS OF STAKEHOLDER HEALTH SHARE A COMMITMENT TO THE OPTIMAL FULFILLMENT OF THEIR CHARITABLE MISSION, FOCUSING THEIR EFFORTS IN COMMUNITIES WHERE HEALTH INEQUITIES ARE MOST PREVALENT. INSPIRED BY THE PASSAGE OF THE PATIENT PROTECTION AND AFFORDABLE CARE ACT, AND MOTIVATED BY THE RECOGNITION OF THE NEED TO TRANSFORM OUR ORGANIZATIONS AND OUR COMMUNITIES, THE GROUP MADE A COMMITMENT TO ACCELERATE THIS TRANSFORMATIONAL PROCESS. THE AIM IS TO DO SO BY FOSTERING THE SHARING OF INNOVATIVE PRACTICES THAT IMPROVE POPULATION HEALTH AND THROUGH THE DEVELOPMENT OF COORDINATED STRATEGIES THAT TAKE INNOVATION TO SCALE. SUSTAINABLE BUILDING SUSTAINABILITY, SAFETY AND EFFICIENCY ARE CORE ELEMENTS OF ALL ADVOCATE CONSTRUCTION PROJECTS. IN 2017, 82% OR 2,535 TONS OF ADVOCATE CONSTRUCTION WASTE WAS RECYCLED. ADVOCATE IS PURSUING LEADERSHIP IN ENERGY AND ENVIRONMENTAL DESIGN (LEED) CERTIFICATION ON ALL NEW MAJOR BUILDINGS AND HAS DEVELOPED A NEW TOOL, THE HEALTHY SPACES ROADMAP, TO ENSURE SUSTAINABILITY IN ALL RENOVATIONS AND PROJECTS THROUGHOUT ADVOCATE.

GOAL E: LEVERAGE RESOURCES AND MAXIMIZE COMMUNITY ENGAGEMENT BY BUILDING AND STRENGTHENING COMMUNITY PARTNERSHIPS WITH HEALTH DEPARTMENTS AND OTHER DIVERSE COMMUNITY ORGANIZATIONS. A KEY OBJECTIVE UNDER THIS GOAL IS ALIGNING INITIATIVES WITH LOCAL HEALTH DEPARTMENTS AND THEIR COMMUNITY HEALTH PRIORITIES. ALL ADVOCATE HOSPITALS COLLABORATED WITH THEIR RESPECTIVE HEALTH DEPARTMENTS DURING THE 2014-2016 COMMUNITY HEALTH NEEDS ASSESSMENT (CHNA) CYCLE. ONE OF THE PRIMARY VALUES OF ADVOCATES COMMUNITY HEALTH DEPARTMENT IS COLLABORATION WITH PARTNERS, PREFERABLY THROUGH A COLLECTIVE IMPACT MODEL. ONE OF THE PRINCIPAL PARTNERS IN PROVIDING FOR COMMUNITY NEEDS IS THE LOCAL HEALTH DEPARTMENT. WHILE AT THE DIRECTION OF THE SYSTEM, ALL HOSPITALS ACTIVELY PARTICIPATED IN COLLABORATIVE ASSESSMENTS AND HEALTH IMPROVEMENT PLANNING WITH THEIR LOCAL HEALTH DEPARTMENTS FOR THE 2014-2016 CHNA PROCESS AND ARE DOING SO AGAIN FOR THE 2017-2019 PROCESS. THERE IS ONE NOTABLE COLLABORATION IN PARTICULAR IN WHICH ADVOCATE SYSTEM LEVEL LEADERSHIP PLAYED A VITAL ROLE. HEALTH IMPACT COLLABORATIVE OF COOK COUNTY (HICCC).

In fiscal year 2015, Crisis Nursery served 549 families, comprised of 886 children and 852 caregivers (unduplicated count) and provided nearly 29,000 hours of crisis care. Of our admissions, 43% were due to parental stress, 17% were for medical or mental health related reasons, and 2% were for substance abuse or domestic violence related reasons. Crisis Nursery programming consists of two components: Safe Children and Strong Families. The Safe Children program is available for families who are experiencing a crisis/emergency, need child care, and have no other resources available to help. If needed, basic care items such as diapers, wipes, formula, and clothing may be available. The Strong Families program provides additional support to families, including crisis counseling, home visits, parent-child interaction groups, support groups, parent education, and referrals for resources and follow-ups. Identified Need: Behavioral Health Mental Health First Aid In response to a demonstrated system and state-wide need of addressing barriers to accessing and utilizing mental health services, Presence Health and its community partners implemented an evidence-based program, Mental Health First Aid (MHFA), to reduce the stigma associated with mental illness and improve the coordination of mental health care throughout a six county service area. A system-wide action team was created to oversee the process, with administrative, local and behavioral health representatives that earned support from applicable Senior and Executive leadership teams. Community stakeholders partnered in the development of the strategy and its implementation throughout the process, recruiting trainees, identifying resources, and disseminating findings. Program participants increased recognition of mental health disorders, increased understanding of appropriate treatments, improved confidence in providing help to others during crisis situations, and decreased stigmatizing attitudes. Having demonstrated its effectiveness, the program continues to expand and add both participants and partners."

The University of Miami Hospital and Anne Bates Leach Eye Hospital are reimbursed under the Medicare Prospective Payment System (PPS). For inpatient services, the reimbursement methodology is the Inpatient Prospective Payment System (IPPS), which uses the Diagnostic Related Groups (DRGS) methodology to reimburse the hospital. The DRG amounts are updated by the Medicare program annually by an updating factor. However, the amount of the updating factor is always significantly less than the actual healthcare inflation factor because the Medicare program includes a ""budget neutrality"" factor for the overall Medicare program. Thus, the hospital does not receive full reimbursement of its cost for inpatient services. For outpatient services, the reimbursement methodology is the Outpatient Prospective Payment System (OPPS), which uses ambulatory payment classifications (APCS) to reimburse the hospital. The APC amounts are updated by the Medicare program annually by an updating factor. However, the amount of the updating factor is always significantly less than the actual healthcare inflation factor because the Medicare program includes a ""budget neutrality"" factor for the overall Medicare program. Thus, the hospital does not receive full reimbursement for its cost for outpatient services. The University of Miami Hospital and Clinics is a cancer specialty hospital and, as such, is cost based reimbursed for both inpatient and outpatient services. For inpatient services, the limit is the TEFRA target limit. The hospital, on occasion, exceeds the target rate and does not receive full cost reimbursement. The TEFRA target amount is updated by the Medicare program annually by the TEFRA updating factor. However, the amount of the TEFRA updating factor is always significantly less than the actual healthcare inflation factor because the Medicare program includes a ""budget neutrality"" factor for the overall Medicare program. For outpatient services, the limit is the payment to cost ratio (PCR). The PCR was established using a base year, which was 1996, at a rate of 85.5% of cost. The PCR for all exempt cancer centers was 92% through 12/31/16, and then 91% from 1/1/17 to 5/31/17; therefore, the hospital currently does not receive payment for a range of 8% to 9% of its outpatient cost."

The Rockefeller University Hospital is a unique institution. As an institution solely committed to conducting clinical research our community/service area is defined as the New York Metropolitan Area. The Rockefeller University Hospital has provided an array of clinical research and patient care services since its founding in 1910. The Rockefeller University Hospital community served/service area is determined based on research being conducted. Principal Investigators identify an area of interest and submit a protocol for review and approval by our institutional review board. If and when the protocol is approved, our recruitment office works with the investigator to develop and submit advertisements in local newspapers, magazines and online. Identification of lucrative places to advertise is determined by current trends in readership among local newspapers, magazines and visits to particular websites such as Craigslist and Facebook. Research participants are culled from all over New York City as well as through collaborations with neighboring hospitals, Universities, and clinics. As a result, our enrolled research participant demographics are similar to those of New York City overall. In calendar year 2018 15% of research participants identified as Hispanic, 34% identified as Black or African-American and 42% identified as white (RUH subject race and ethnicity report 2018), which is similar to the geographic makeup of New York City (42.8% white, 24.3% Black or African-American, and 29.1% Hispanic) https://www.census.gov/quickfacts/fact/table/newyorkcitynewyork,US/PST045218."

Thus, all research participants are volunteers, and as such are important partners in the research process.

201931339349303508,421264647,Pt VI Supplemental Information,"Schedule H Part 1 Line 6a The Annual Report that includes the Hospitals community benefit information is normally contained in a report prepared by the former parent organization, Wheaton Franciscan Services, Inc. However, effective May 1, 2016, the Iowa region of Wheaton Franciscan Healthcare was transferred to Mercy Health Network. As a result of this transfer, the Iowa region conducted their own audit, and prepared their own Community Benefit Report for Fiscal 2018. This is available upon request. Schedule H Part 1 Line 7 Community Benefit amounts are reported using total actual costs per the hospitals managerial accounting system in use, which includes all patient segments including inpatient, outpatient, emergency room, private insurance, Medicaid, Medicare, Medicare HMO, uninsured, and self-pay patients. Medicare is reported using the most recently filed cost report at the time the Annual Report and related community benefit information is published. Amounts are summarized using a software application recommended by the Catholic Health Association in conjunction with the Iowa Hospital Association, because it has the ability to provide the information in a format suitable for Schedule H presentation. After the data is entered by the Site Finance Directors, its accuracy is verified by employees who are trained in community benefit reporting, and then approved by the Chief Financial Officer and the President/CEO of the Iowa organization. After amounts are verified and approved, community benefit amounts become finalized. Finally, the information is compiled with the assistance of CBISA software for presentation in IRS Forms 990 Schedule H and Statement of Program Service Accomplishments Part III. The Iowa hospital facilities are not required to report community benefit information to the State of Iowa, but do make the information readily available on certain websites, and report the information to the Iowa Hospital Association. Schedule H Part 1 Line 7 Column f Iowa Hospitals follow guidelines established by the Catholic Health Association and the Iowa Hospital Association, who recommend that bad debt expense not be included in community benefit amounts. As a result of this applied methodology, a total amount of $7,064,710 has not been included in the denominator of the calculation that determines the percentages reported on Schedule H Line 7 Column f. Schedule H Part 1 Line 7g In the Iowa region, clinic operations are included as a department of the hospital, Covenant Medical Center, Inc. Clinic operations for the Iowa clinics are included only in the community benefit reporting of charity care, government sponsored health care, and Medicare shortfall. Therefore, costs related to physician clinics are not included in subsidized health services reported on Schedule H Part I Line 7g. Schedule H Part III Section A Lines 1-3 In determining bad debt amounts, the Iowa organizations use a two-level scoring process as follows: First, for any patient account that is categorized as having no insurance, when the amount becomes 60 days overdue or greater, the patients account is reviewed for financial assistance qualification. If the patient is found to qualify for financial assistance, the necessary steps are taken to apply, and the needed adjustments are made so as to treat as charity care and not as bad debt. A similar scoring process is completed for those patients who do have insurance, but after 120 days or greater, still have not paid the patient responsibility portion. Again, these patient accounts are reviewed for financial assistance, and if they qualify, similar steps are taken to remove from bad debt. As a result of these scoring procedures, Iowas position is therefore that none of the patients resulting in uncollectible accounts would have qualified as charity care patients as this determination is made at the time of admission, or later with the timing of the scoring procedures mentioned above. Bad debt is therefore only determined for each organization at the time the amount due is truly determined to be uncollectible, after financial assistance has been determined, and after many months of collection efforts. Additionally, the organization followed guidelines established by the Catholic Health Association and the Iowa Hospital Association, who recommends that no bad debt amounts be included in community benefit amounts. For these reasons, Part III Section A Line 3 is reported at zero. Schedule H Part III Section A Line 4 Covenant Medical Center, Inc. is included in the consolidated financial statements of Wheaton Franciscan Healthcare - Iowa, Inc. The following is the text of the footnote from the financial statements which addresses the allowance for doubtful accounts. This footnote can be found on page 12 of the attached consolidated financial statements. The Hospitals recognize patient service revenue associated with services provided to patients who have third-party payor coverage on the basis of contractual rates for the services rendered. For uninsured patients that do not qualify for charity care, the Hospitals recognize revenue for services provided (on the basis of discounted rates, as provided by policy). On the basis of historical experience, a portion of the Hospital's uninsured patients will be unable or unwilling to pay for the services provided. Thus, the Hospitals record a provision for bad debts related to uninsured patients in the period the services are provided. Schedule H Part III Section B Line 6-8 Schedule H Part III Section B Line 6 reports allowable costs of care as taken from the most recently filed Medicare cost report available at the time the Community Benefit Report is published. The Medicare cost report calculates its allowable total costs based on applicable Medicare regulations. Medicare and Medicaid cost is determined using individual cost center cost-to-charge ratios. This cost to charge ratio is determined using all payer cost and all payer charges. The cost to charge ratio is applied to the actual Medicare and Medicaid charges to determine the Medicare and Medicaid cost. This organization has adopted the cost and charge practices as recommended by the Catholic Health Association and the Iowa Hospital Association, and therefore, does not count any Medicare shortfall numbers in its annual reporting of Community Benefit amounts. Schedule H Part III Section C Line 9b Iowa organizations follow a policy that outlines all collection practices for patients who are known to qualify for government programs and for our charity care program. We make every attempt to assist the patient in enrolling in government insurance plans or our own charity care program allowing for free or discounted care. If the patient does not qualify for any type of aid or charity care, declines to establish a reasonable payment plan or pay the liability, the patient will be moved into a bad debt status, and the account is sent to a collection agency. This does not occur before the patient has received several notices and a final written warning. Please also see Schedule H Part III Section A Lines 1-3 narrative response. Schedule H Part V Section A and Section C: Affiliates of the Iowa region have defined and reported hospital facilities to include only those bricks and mortar buildings that actually have inpatient beds, in addition to meeting all other criteria under Iowa state law required for hospital licensing. Although there may be other facilities within our system built to hospital specifications, performing hospital-based billing, and conforming to other hospital standards under state law, until there is further guidance from the IRS, these facilities have been reported in Section C, due to their lack of having state certified inpatient beds. Schedule H Part VI Line 2 Iowa assesses the needs of the communities it serves by reviewing admission and discharge data, analyzing information from the community health departments and other community leaders, and by aligning our services with the Healthy People 2020 and other current year initiatives. The Iowa hospital organizations complete a Community Health Needs Assessment and Implementation Plan every three years. Please reference Schedule H Part V Section B Lines 1-12 for additional information. Schedule H Part VI Line 3 Iowa provides its patients with several opportunities to gain knowledge and awareness of its Community Care (Charity Care/Financial Assistance) program. Notices regarding the availability of financial assistance are displayed in highly visible locations where there is a significant volume of inpatient or outpatient traffic such as: patient admitting and registration areas in both inpatient and outpatient settings, physician offices, and emergency departments. Additionally, brochures describing the policy are available upon request in the same locations and on Iowas website. The policy is also discussed at the time of registration or pre-registration"

Based on the ATFs recommendation, the hospital identified North Central Baltimore City as its Community Benefit Service Area (CBSA), which includes residents living in ZIP codes 21211, 21213 and 21218. The hospital selected this geographic area based on hospital utilization and secondary public health data as well as its close proximity to the hospital, coupled with a high density of low-income residents and high rates of chronic disease prevalence. The ATF used population-level data, community health needs survey findings and feedback from community input sessions to create recommendations for the hospitals health priorities, potential implementation strategies, and to identify key partners. Based on the ATFs recommendation, the hospital health priorities for the CBSA include health and wellness (chronic disease prevention and management, behavioral health), access to care and services (mental health services, substance use services, transportation) and social determinants of health (employment, neighborhood violence and safety, housing). The hospitals FY18 CHNA and three-year Implementation Strategies were endorsed by MUMH Board of Directors and approved by the MedStar Health Board of Directors. The document became available on the hospitals website on June 30, 2018. As a proud member of MedStar Health, representatives from MUMH routinely participate in the MedStar Health community benefit workgroup. The workgroup is comprised of community health professionals who represent all ten MedStar hospitals. The team analyzes local and regional community health data, establishes system-wide community health programming performance and evaluation measures and shares best practices."

MedStar Health and its healthcare facilities will: * Treat all patients equitably, with dignity, respect, and compassion. * Serve the emergency health care needs of everyone who presents to our facilities regardless of a patient's ability to pay for care. * Assist those patients who are admitted through our admission process for non-urgent, medically necessary care who cannot pay for the care they receive. * Balance needed financial assistance for some patients with broader fiscal responsibilities in order to keep its hospitals' doors open for all who may need care in the community. In meeting its commitments, MedStar Healths facilities will work with their uninsured patients seeking emergency and medically necessary care to gain an understanding of each patients financial resources. Based on this information and eligibility determination, MedStar Health facilities will provide financial assistance to uninsured patients who reside within the communities we serve in one or more of the following ways: * Assist with enrollment in publicly-funded entitlement programs (e.g., Medicaid). * Refer patients to State or Federal Insurance Exchange Navigator resources. * Assist with consideration of funding that may be available from other charitable organizations. * Provide financial assistance according to applicable policy guidelines. * Provide financial assistance for payment of facility charges using a sliding-scale based on the patients household income and financial resources. * Offer periodic payment plans to assist patients with financing their healthcare services. Each facility publicizes the MedStar Financial Assistance Policy by: * Providing access to the MedStar Financial Assistance Policy, Financial Assistance Applications, and MedStar Patient Information Sheet on all hospital websites and patient portals. * Providing hard copies of the MedStar Financial Assistance Policy, MedStar Uniform Financial Assistance Application, and MedStar Patient Information Sheet to patients upon request. * Providing notification and information about the MedStar Financial Assistance Policy by offering copies as part of all registration or discharges processes, and answering questions on how to apply for assistance. * Providing written notices on billing statements. * Displaying MedStar Financial Assistance Policy information at all hospital registration points. * Translating the MedStar Financial Assistance Policy, MedStar Uniform Financial Assistance Application, and the Medstar Patient Information Sheet into primary languages of all significant populations with Limited English Proficiency. MedStar Health provides a financial assistance probable and likely eligibility determination to the patient within two business days from receipt of the initial financial assistance application. Final eligibility determinations are made and communicated to the patient based on receipt and review of a completed application. MedStar Health believes that its patients have personal responsibilities related to the financial aspects of their healthcare needs. Financial assistance and periodic payment plans available under this policy will not be available to those patients who fail to fulfill their responsibilities. For purposes of this policy, patient responsibilities include: * Complying with providing the necessary financial disclosure forms to evaluate their eligibility for publicly-funded healthcare programs, charity care programs, and other forms of financial assistance (these disclosure forms must be completed accurately, truthfully, and timely to allow MedStar Healths facilities to properly counsel patients concerning the availability of financial assistance). * Working with the facilitys Patient Advocates and Patient Financial Services staff to ensure there is a complete understanding of the patients financial situation and constraints. * Making applicable payments for services in a timely fashion, including any payments made pursuant to deferred and periodic payment schedules. * Providing updated financial information to the facilitys Patient Advocates or Customer Service Representatives on a timely basis as the patients financial circumstances may change. * It is the responsibility of the patient to inform the MedStar hospital of their existing eligibility under a medical hardship during the 12-month period. * In the event a patient fails to meet these responsibilities, MedStar reserves the right to pursue additional billing and collection efforts. In the event of non-payment billing, and collection efforts are defined in the MedStar Billing and Collection Policy. A free copy is available on all hospital websites and patient portals or by calling customer service at 1-800-280-9006.

THE ORGANIZATION BELIEVES THAT MEDICARE UNDERPAYMENTS (SHORTFALL) AND THE COST OF BAD DEBT ARE COMMUNITY BENEFIT AND SHOULD BE INCLUDED ON FORM 990, SCHEDULE H, PART I. AS OUTLINED MORE FULLY BELOW, THE ORGANIZATION BELIEVES THAT THESE SERVICES AND RELATED COSTS PROMOTE THE HEALTH OF THE COMMUNITY AS A WHOLE AND ARE RENDERED IN CONJUNCTION WITH THE ORGANIZATION'S CHARITABLE TAX-EXEMPT PURPOSES AND MISSION IN PROVIDING MEDICALLY NECESSARY HEALTHCARE SERVICES TO ALL INDIVIDUALS IN A NON- DISCRIMINATORY MANNER WITHOUT REGARD TO RACE, COLOR, CREED, SEX, NATIONAL ORIGIN, RELIGION OR ABILITY TO PAY AND IS CONSISTENT WITH THE COMMUNITY BENEFIT STANDARD PROMULGATED BY THE IRS. THE COMMUNITY BENEFIT STANDARD IS THE CURRENT STANDARD FOR A TAX-EXEMPT AND CHARITABLE ORGANIZATION UNDER THE INTERNAL REVENUE CODE (""IRC"") 501(C)(3). SATISFYING THE ""COMMUNITY BENEFIT STANDARD,"" AS ARTICULATED BY THE INTERNAL REVENUE SERVICE (IRS) IN REVENUE RULING 69-545, IS CURRENTLY REQUIRED FOR A HOSPITAL TO BE RECOGNIZED AS A CHARITABLE ORGANIZATION UNDER INTERNAL REVENUE CODE (IRC) 501(C)(3). THIS RULING REMOVED THE PREVIOUS REQUIREMENT OF REVENUE RULING 56-185, KNOWN AS THE ""CHARITY CARE STANDARD,"" THAT IN ORDER TO BE A CHARITABLE ORGANIZATION, A HOSPITAL HAD TO PROVIDE, TO THE EXTENT OF ITS FINANCIAL ABILITY, FREE OR REDUCED-COST CARE TO PATIENTS UNABLE TO PAY FOR THEIR CARE. THIS EARLIER RULING EMPHASIZED THAT A LOW LEVEL OF CHARITY CARE DID NOT MEAN THAT A HOSPITAL WAS CHARITABLE SINCE THAT LEVEL COULD REFLECT THE HOSPITAL'S FINANCIAL ABILITY TO PROVIDE SUCH CARE. REVENUE RULING 56-185 ALSO NOTED THAT PUBLICLY SUPPORTED COMMUNITY HOSPITALS WOULD NORMALLY QUALIFY AS CHARITABLE BECAUSE THEY SERVE THE ENTIRE COMMUNITY AND A LOW LEVEL OF CHARITY CARE WOULD NOT IMPACT A HOSPITAL'S CHARITABLE STATUS IF IT WAS DUE TO THE SURROUNDING COMMUNITY'S LACK OF CHARITABLE DEMANDS. AS DEVELOPED IN REVENUE RULING 69-545, UNDER THE COMMUNITY BENEFIT STANDARD, HOSPITALS WERE JUDGED ON WHETHER THEY PROMOTE THE HEALTH OF A BROAD CLASS OF INDIVIDUALS IN THE COMMUNITY. THIS RULING INVOLVED A HOSPITAL THAT ONLY ADMITTED THOSE WHO COULD PAY FOR THE SERVICES EITHER BY THEMSELVES, THROUGH PRIVATE INSURANCE OR PUBLIC PROGRAMS SUCH AS MEDICARE. IN ADDITION, THE HOSPITAL OPERATED A FULL-TIME EMERGENCY ROOM THAT WAS OPEN TO EVERYONE. THE IRS RULED THAT THE HOSPITAL WAS CHARITABLE BECAUSE IT PROMOTED THE HEALTH OF PEOPLE IN ITS COMMUNITY. THE IRS REASONED THAT BECAUSE THE PROMOTION OF HEALTH WAS A CHARITABLE PURPOSE ACCORDING TO THE GENERAL LAW OF CHARITY, IT FELL WITHIN THE ""GENERALLY ACCEPTED LEGAL SENSE"" OF THE TERM CHARITABLE, AS REQUIRED BY TREASURY REGULATION SECTION 1.501 (C)(3)-1(D)(2). THE IRS RULED THAT THE PROMOTION OF HEALTH, LIKE RELIEF OF POVERTY AND THE ADVANCEMENT OF EDUCATION AND RELIGION, IS ONE OF THE PURPOSES OF THE GENERAL LAW OF CHARITY THAT IS DEEMED BENEFICIAL TO THE COMMUNITY AS A WHOLE EVEN THOUGH THE CLASS OF BENEFICIARIES ELIGIBLE TO RECEIVE A DIRECT BENEFIT FROM ITS ACTIVITIES DOES NOT INCLUDE ALL MEMBERS OF THE COMMUNITY, SUCH AS INDIGENT MEMBERS OF THE COMMUNITY, PROVIDED THAT THE CLASS IS NOT SO SMALL THAT ITS RELIEF IS NOT OF BENEFIT TO THE COMMUNITY. THE IRS CONCLUDED THAT THE HOSPITAL WAS ""PROMOTING THE HEALTH OF A CLASS OF PERSONS THAT IS BROAD ENOUGH TO BENEFIT THE COMMUNITY"" BECAUSE ITS EMERGENCY ROOM WAS OPEN TO ALL AND IT PROVIDED CARE TO THOSE WHO COULD PAY, WHETHER DIRECTLY OR THROUGH THIRD-PARTY REIMBURSEMENT. OTHER FACTORS THAT DEMONSTRATED COMMUNITY BENEFIT INCLUDED: SURPLUS FUNDS WERE USED TO IMPROVE PATIENT CARE, EXPAND FACILITIES AND ADVANCE MEDICAL TRAINING, EDUCATION AND RESEARCH; AND IT WAS CONTROLLED BY A BOARD OF DIRECTORS THAT CONSISTED OF INDEPENDENT CIVIC LEADERS. THE AMERICAN HOSPITAL ASSOCIATION (""AHA"") BELIEVES THAT MEDICARE UNDERPAYMENTS (SHORTFALLS) AND BAD DEBT SHOULD BE REPORTED AS COMMUNITY BENEFIT ON FORM 990, SCHEDULE H, PART I, LINE 7. THIS ORGANIZATION AGREES WITH THE AHA'S LETTER TO THE IRS DATED AUGUST 21, 2007 RESPONDING TO A DRAFT OF THE NEW FORM 990 AND SCHEDULE H, THE AHA ARGUED THAT MEDICARE UNDERPAYMENTS (SHORTFALLS) IS COMMUNITY BENEFIT FOR THE FOLLOWING REASONS: -PROVIDING CARE FOR THE ELDERLY AND SERVING MEDICARE PATIENTS REMAINS AN ESSENTIAL PART OF THE COMMUNITY BENEFIT STANDARD. -MEDICARE, LIKE MEDICAID, DOES NOT PAY THE FULL COST OF CARE. RECENTLY, MEDICARE REIMBURSES ONLY 92 CENTS FOR EVERY DOLLAR HOSPITALS SPEND TO CARE FOR MEDICARE PATIENTS. -MANY MEDICARE PATIENTS, LIKE THEIR MEDICAID COUNTERPARTS, ARE POOR. MORE THAN 46% OF MEDICARE SPENDING IS FOR BENEFICIARIES WHOSE INCOME IS BELOW 200% OF THE FEDERAL POVERTY LEVEL. MANY ARE ALSO ELIGIBLE FOR MEDICAID, SO CALLED -DUAL ELIGIBLES"". PENNSYLVANIA REQUIRES NON-PROFIT HOSPITALS TO PROVIDE A MINIMUM LEVEL OF COMMUNITY BENEFIT TO RETAIN EXEMPTION FROM STATE AND LOCAL TAXES. ACCORDING TO STATE GUIDANCE AND CASE LAW, THE UNREIMBURSED COST OF MEDICARE AND BAD DEBT IS CONSIDERED TO BE COMMUNITY BENEFIT FOR STATE TAX EXEMPTION PURPOSES. PART III, LINE 6 ONLY INCLUDES THOSE COSTS THAT ARE PERMITTED TO BE REPORTED IN THE HOSPITAL'S MEDICARE COST REPORT THAT IS REQUIRED TO BE FILED WITH THE FEDERAL GOVERNMENT. THE HOSPITAL CONSIDERS THE TOTAL MEDICARE UNDERPAYMENTS (SHORTFALL) OF 32,616,944 SHOULD BE REPORTED AS COMMUNITY BENEFIT ON THE FORM 990, SCHEDULE H, PART I, LINE 7. ALONG WITH PROVIDING CARE TO MEDICAID PATIENTS AND PROVIDING FREE OR DISCOUNTED CARE TO OTHER LOW INCOME PATIENTS, THE IRS COMMUNITY BENEFIT STANDARD INCLUDES THE PROVISION OF CARE TO THE ELDERLY AND MEDICARE PATIENTS. LIKE MEDICAID, MEDICARE DOES NOT PAY THE FULL COST OF PROVIDING CARE TO THESE PATIENTS, FORCING THE HOSPITAL TO USE OTHER FUNDS TO COVER THE SHORTFALL. MEDICARE SHORTFALLS MUST BE ABSORBED BY THE HOSPITAL IN ORDER TO CONTINUE TREATING THE ELDERLY IN OUR COMMUNITIES. THE HOSPITAL PROVIDES CARE REGARDLESS OF THE MEDICARE SHORTFALL AND IS THEREBY PROVIDING ACCESS TO MEDICAL SERVICES FOR THE ELDERLY AND RELIEVING THE FEDERAL GOVERNMENT OF THE BURDEN OF PAYING THE FULL COST FOR PROVIDING CARE TO MEDICARE PATIENTS. ABSENT THE MEDICARE PROGRAM, IT IS LIKELY THAT MANY MEDICARE PATIENTS WOULD BE ELIGIBLE FOR CHARITY CARE OR OTHER NEED BASED GOVERNMENT PROGRAMS. THE AMOUNT EXPENDED TO COVER THE SHORTFALL IS MONEY NOT AVAILABLE FOR FINANCIAL ASSISTANCE AND OTHER COMMUNITY BENEFIT NEEDS. BOTH THE HOSPITAL AND THE AHA BELIEVE THAT PATIENT BAD DEBT BE REPORTED AS A COMMUNITY BENEFIT ON FORM 990, SCHEDULE H, PART I, LINE 7. LIKE MEDICARE UNDERPAYMENTS (SHORTFALLS), BAD DEBT SHOULD BE REPORTED AS COMMUNITY BENEFIT BECAUSE: -A SIGNIFICANT PORTION OF BAD DEBT IS ATTRIBUTABLE TO LOW-INCOME PATIENTS, WHO FOR MANY REASONS DECLINE TO COMPLETE THE FORMS REQUIRED TO ESTABLISH ELIGIBILITY UNDER THE HOSPITAL'S CHARITY CARE OR FINANCIAL ASSISTANCE POLICY (FAP). A 2006 CONGRESSIONAL BUDGET OFFICE (""CBO""), ""NONPROFIT HOSPITALS AND THE PROVISION OF COMMUNITY BENEFIT"", CITED TWO STUDIES INDICATING THAT ""THE GREAT MAJORITY OF BAD DEBT WAS ATTRIBUTABLE TO PATIENTS WITH INCOMES BELOW 200% OF THE FEDERAL POVERTY LINE."" -THE CBO REPORT ALSO NOTED THAT A SUBSTANTIAL PORTION OF THE BAD DEBT IS PENDING CHARITY CARE. UNLIKE BAD DEBT IN OTHER INDUSTRIES, HOSPITAL BAD DEBT IS COMPLICATED BY THE FACT THAT HOSPITALS FOLLOW THEIR CHARITABLE MISSION TO THE COMMUNITY AND TREAT EVERY PATIENT THAT COMES THROUGH THE EMERGENCY DEPARTMENT, REGARDLESS OF ABILITY TO PAY. PATIENTS WHO HAVE OUTSTANDING BILLS ARE NOT TURNED AWAY, UNLIKE OTHER INDUSTRIES. BAD DEBT IS FURTHER COMPLICATED BY THE AUDITING INDUSTRY'S STANDARDS ON REPORTING CHARITY CARE. MANY PATIENTS CANNOT OR DO NOT PROVIDE THE NECESSARY DOCUMENTATION REQUIRED TO BE DEEMED CHARITY CARE BY AUDITORS. AS A RESULT, ACCORDING TO THE CBO REPORT, ROUGHLY 40% OF BAD DEBT IS PENDING CHARITY CARE. (IN FY 2018, APPROXIMATELY 15% OF THE HOSPITAL'S BAD DEBT WAS SUBSEQUENTLY RECLASSIFIED TO CHARITY CARE.) THE CBO CONCLUDED THAT ITS FINDINGS ""SUPPORT THE VALIDITY OF THE USE OF UNCOMPENSATED CARE (BAD DEBT AND CHARITY CARE) AS A MEASURE OF COMMUNITY BENEFITS"" ASSUMING THE FINDINGS ARE GENERALIZED NATIONALLY. THE EXPERIENCE OF HOSPITALS NATIONWIDE REINFORCE THAT THEY ARE GENERALIZABLE. AS OUTLINED BY THE AHA, DESPITE THE HOSPITAL'S BEST EFFORTS AND DUE DILIGENCE, PATIENT BAD DEBT IS A PART OF THE CHARITABLE MISSION AND CHARITABLE PURPOSES. BAD DEBT REPRESENTS PART OF THE BURDEN HOSPITALS' BEAR IN SERVING ALL PATIENTS REGARDLESS OF RACE, COLOR, CREED, SEX, NATIONAL ORIGIN, RELIGION OR ABILITY TO PAY. IN ADDITION, THE HOSPITAL INVESTS SIGNIFICANT RESOURCES IN SYSTEMS AND STAFF TRAINING TO ASSIST PATIENTS THAT ARE IN NEED OF FINANCIAL ASSISTANCE. FOR FISCAL YEAR ENDED 6/30/2018, THE HOSPITAL'S COST OF PROVIDING PATIENT CARE FOR SERVICES ACCOUNTED FOR AS BAD DEBT WAS 1,696,098."

GEISINGER FOUNDED THE GEORGE F. GEISINGER MEMORIAL HOSPITAL IN MEMORY OF HER HUSBAND. FROM THE BEGINNING, THE NEW HOSPITAL WAS DESIGNED AS A COMPREHENSIVE HEALTHCARE INSTITUTION THAT WOULD OFFER SPECIALIZED MEDICAL CARE TO PEOPLE IN THE RURAL AREAS OF CENTRAL AND NORTHEASTERN PENNSYLVANIA. UNLIKE MOST HEALTHCARE SYSTEMS, WHICH EVOLVED WITH A HOSPITAL FOCUS, GEISINGER'S HISTORY AND TRADITION IS THAT OF A PHYSICIAN-LED AND PHYSICIAN-DRIVEN HEALTHCARE ORGANIZATION. THIS TRADITION BEGAN WHEN MRS. GEISINGER BROUGHT DR. HAROLD FOSS, A MAYO CLINIC TRAINED PHYSICIAN, TO BE HER HOSPITAL'S FIRST CHIEF OF STAFF. TODAY, GEISINGER IS REGARDED AS A NATIONAL MODEL OF HEALTHCARE DELIVERY CENTERED ON A SOPHISTICATED MULTISPECIALTY GROUP PRACTICE.

201921309349304237,521272129,NEEDS ASSESSMENT,"PART VI, LINE 2: In FY18, MedStar Washington Hospital Center (MWHC) conducted a Community Health Needs Assessment (CHNA) in accordance with the guidelines established by the Patient Protection and Affordable Care Act and the Internal Revenue Service. A 28 member Advisory Task Force (ATF) led the MWHC CHNA process. The ATF included a diverse group of individuals, including hospital leaders, grassroots activists, community residents, faith-based leaders, hospital representatives, public health leaders and other stakeholder organizations, such as representatives from local health departments. The ATF reviewed national, state, and local health and disparity data, public health priorities and community health improvement plans as well as county-level ZIP code and neighborhood level data (when available). Based on their findings, ATF members designed a CHNA survey tool consisting of open and closed-ended questions about healthcare access, health equity, health condition concerns, social determinants and community strengths and assets. Community members responded to the survey by attending a community input session or completing it online or via hardcopy. Based on the ATF's recommendation, the hospital identified District of Columbia Wards 7 and 8 as its Community Benefit Service Area (CBSA), which includes residents living in ZIP codes 20011, 20019 and 20020. The hospital selected this geographic area based on hospital utilization and secondary public health data as well as its close proximity to the hospital, coupled with an opportunity to build upon longstanding programs and services. The ATF used population-level data, community health needs survey findings and feedback from community input sessions to create recommendations for the hospital's health priorities, potential implementation strategies, and to identify key partners. Based on the ATF's recommendation, the hospital health priorities for the CBSA include health and wellness (chronic disease prevention and management, behavioral health), access to care and services (mental health, linkage to resources and services, transportation) and social determinants of health (food access, employment, housing). The hospital's FY18 CHNA and three-year Implementation Strategies were endorsed by MWHC Board of Directors and approved by the MedStar Health Board of Directors. The document became available on the hospital's website on June 30, 2018. As a proud member of MedStar Health, representatives from MWHC routinely participate in the MedStar Health community benefit workgroup. The workgroup is comprised of community health professionals who represent all ten MedStar hospitals. The team analyzes local and regional community health data, establishes system-wide community health programming performance and evaluation measures and shares best practices."

In meeting its commitments, MedStar Healths facilities will work with their uninsured patients seeking emergency and medically necessary care to gain an understanding of each patients financial resources. Based on this information and eligibility determination, MedStar Health facilities will provide financial assistance to uninsured patients who reside within the communities we serve in one or more of the following ways: * Assist with enrollment in publicly-funded entitlement programs (e.g., Medicaid); * Refer patients to State or Federal Insurance Exchange Navigator resources; * Assist with consideration of funding that may be available from other charitable organizations; * Provide financial assistance according to applicable policy guidelines; * Provide financial assistance for payment of facility charges using a sliding-scale based on the patients household income and financial resources; * Offer periodic payment plans to assist patients with financing their healthcare services.

Final eligibility determinations are made and communicated to the patient based on receipt and review of a completed application. MedStar Health believes that its patients have personal responsibilities related to the financial aspects of their healthcare needs. Financial assistance and periodic payment plans available under this policy will not be available to those patients who fail to fulfill their responsibilities. For purposes of this policy, patient responsibilities include: * Complying with providing the necessary financial disclosure forms to evaluate their eligibility for publicly-funded healthcare programs, charity care programs, and other forms of financial assistance (these disclosure forms must be completed accurately, truthfully, and timely to allow MedStar Healths facilities to properly counsel patients concerning the availability of financial assistance); * Working with the facilitys Patient Advocates and Patient Financial Services staff to ensure there is a complete understanding of the patients financial situation and constraints; * Making applicable payments for services in a timely fashion, including any payments made pursuant to deferred and periodic payment schedules; * Providing updated financial information to the facilitys Patient Advocates or Customer Service Representatives on a timely basis as the patients financial circumstances may change. * It is the responsibility of the patient to inform the MedStar hospital of their existing eligibility under a medical hardship during the 12-month period. * In the event a patient fails to meet these responsibilities, MedStar reserves the right to pursue additional billing and collection efforts. In the event of non-payment billing, and collection efforts are defined in the MedStar Billing and Collection Policy. A free copy is available on all hospital websites and patient portals or by calling customer service at 1-800-280-9006.

All other costs are accounted for using an internal software called CBISA (Community benefit Inventory for Social Accountability), which features a blend of both statistical and narrative information.In October 2010, CMS approved legislation enacted by the State of California that provided for supplemental Medi-Cal payments to be paid to certain hospitals from funds collected from participating hospitals under the State's Quality Assurance Fee Program. Such amounts were allocated and paid to CHLA based on prior year patient data, which includes Medi-Cal patients. If these amounts had not been included, the Hospital would have reported a total community benefit percentage in excess of 20%.Provider Fee and DSH revenue were greater than the Medicaid shortfall, which would create a negative community benefit expense. As such, CHLA is reporting $0 for Medicaid."

The CHLA Community Health Outreach Network - Children's Hospital Los Angeles's Office of Community Affairs collaborated with the CHLA Salud ""Promotoras"" to reach over 10,000 individuals to promote healthy behaviors and providing information and referrals to assist in identifying available health coverage through outreach campaigns at more than 60 community events.CHLA's Department of Community Affairs/Government & Public Policy partnered with the Diabetes and Obesity Program's Kids N Fitness (KNF) staff to present at Los Angeles City Councilmember Mitch O'Farrell's Annual Fitness Challenge to promote physical fitness and healthy lifestyles for children in City of LA's Thirteenth Council District. Over 125 students and teachers from Ramona Elementary (East Hollywood), Glenfeliz Elementary (Atwater Village), Grant Elementary (Hollywood), Fletcher Drive Elementary (Glassell Park), Union Elementary (Echo Park), participated in mini nutrition lessons and physical activity. A registered dietitian from CHLA talked about the importance of the My Plate food guide and red-light/green-light foods. After a mini nutrition lesson, each class was challenged to create their healthy My Plate in teams by running across the park field to get a cut-out image of a food group and then run back to their team to complete their healthy plate to emphasize the importance of maintaining a balanced diet and a physically-active lifestyle.Careers in Health and Mentorship Program (CHAMP) CHLA's CHAMP provides underrepresented adults from the Los Angeles community the opportunity to participate in a series of comprehensive job readiness and leadership development workshops that are led by CHLA staff and hospital partners. Since its inception, over 100 young adults entered the CHLA CHAMP. After successfully completing the workshop series, ""CHAMPers"" are placed in nonclinical, project-based internships in participating hospital departments.Camp CHLA, a health careers exploration program, provides high school students a firsthand look into the daily lives of health care professionals. Since its inception in 2006, over 1,000 students from our community have had the opportunity to: job-shadow health care professionals, participate in hands-on skills labs, gain exposure to different health career paths, and share their experiences with other campers. CHLA continues to deepen its commitment to the community at large through the innovation and implementation of its community services and programs to improve the community's health and safety.

The allowances for contractual adjustments and doubtful accounts are recorded on an accrual basis, using historical experience and established billing rates. In evaluating the collectibility of patient accounts receivable, the Hospital estimates the allowance for doubtful accounts by major payor type, based on historical experience for each type.

201941309349301919,231352187,"PART III, LINE 8 - MEDICARE EXPLANATION","PART III, LINE 3 - BAD DEBT: LINE 6 ONLY INCLUDES THOSE COSTS THAT ARE ALLOWED TO BE REPORTED IN THE HOSPITAL'S MEDICARE COST REPORT THAT IS REQUIRED TO BE FILED WITH THE FEDERAL GOVERNMENT. THE ORGANIZATION BELIEVES THAT MEDICARE UNDERPAYMENTS (SHORTFALL) AND THE COST OF BAD DEBT ARE COMMUNITY BENEFIT AND SHOULD BE INCLUDED ON FORM 990, SCHEDULE H, PART I. AS OUTLINED MORE FULLY BELOW, THE ORGANIZATION BELIEVES THAT THESE SERVICES AND RELATED COSTS PROMOTE THE HEALTH OF THE COMMUNITY AS A WHOLE AND ARE RENDERED IN CONJUNCTION WITH THE ORGANIZATION'S CHARITABLE TAX-EXEMPT PURPOSES AND MISSION IN PROVIDING MEDICALLY NECESSARY HEALTHCARE SERVICES TO ALL INDIVIDUALS IN A NON- DISCRIMINATORY MANNER WITHOUT REGARD TO RACE, COLOR, CREED, SEX, NATIONAL ORIGIN, RELIGION OR ABILITY TO PAY AND IS CONSISTENT WITH THE COMMUNITY BENEFIT STANDARD PROMULGATED BY THE IRS. THE COMMUNITY BENEFIT STANDARD IS THE CURRENT STANDARD FOR A TAX-EXEMPT AND CHARITABLE ORGANIZATION UNDER THE INTERNAL REVENUE CODE (""IRC"") 501(C)(3). SATISFYING THE ""COMMUNITY BENEFIT STANDARD,"" AS ARTICULATED BY THE INTERNAL REVENUE SERVICE (IRS) IN REVENUE RULING 69-545, IS CURRENTLY REQUIRED FOR A HOSPITAL TO BE RECOGNIZED AS A CHARITABLE ORGANIZATION UNDER INTERNAL REVENUE CODE (IRC) 501(C)(3). THIS RULING REMOVED THE PREVIOUS REQUIREMENT OF REVENUE RULING 56-185, KNOWN AS THE ""CHARITY CARE STANDARD,"" THAT IN ORDER TO BE A CHARITABLE ORGANIZATION, A HOSPITAL HAD TO PROVIDE, TO THE EXTENT OF ITS FINANCIAL ABILITY, FREE OR REDUCED-COST CARE TO PATIENTS UNABLE TO PAY FOR THEIR CARE. THIS EARLIER RULING EMPHASIZED THAT A LOW LEVEL OF CHARITY CARE DID NOT MEAN THAT A HOSPITAL WAS CHARITABLE SINCE THAT LEVEL COULD REFLECT THE HOSPITAL'S FINANCIAL ABILITY TO PROVIDE SUCH CARE. REVENUE RULING 56-185 ALSO NOTED THAT PUBLICLY SUPPORTED COMMUNITY HOSPITALS WOULD NORMALLY QUALIFY AS CHARITABLE BECAUSE THEY SERVE THE ENTIRE COMMUNITY AND A LOW LEVEL OF CHARITY CARE WOULD NOT IMPACT A HOSPITAL'S CHARITABLE STATUS IF IT WAS DUE TO THE SURROUNDING COMMUNITY'S LACK OF CHARITABLE DEMANDS. AS DEVELOPED IN REVENUE RULING 69-545, UNDER THE COMMUNITY BENEFIT STANDARD, HOSPITALS WERE JUDGED ON WHETHER THEY PROMOTE THE HEALTH OF A BROAD CLASS OF INDIVIDUALS IN THE COMMUNITY. THIS RULING INVOLVED A HOSPITAL THAT ONLY ADMITTED THOSE WHO COULD PAY FOR THE SERVICES EITHER BY THEMSELVES, THROUGH PRIVATE INSURANCE OR PUBLIC PROGRAMS SUCH AS MEDICARE. IN ADDITION, THE HOSPITAL OPERATED A FULL-TIME EMERGENCY ROOM THAT WAS OPEN TO EVERYONE. THE IRS RULED THAT THE HOSPITAL WAS CHARITABLE BECAUSE IT PROMOTED THE HEALTH OF PEOPLE IN ITS COMMUNITY. THE IRS REASONED THAT BECAUSE THE PROMOTION OF HEALTH WAS A CHARITABLE PURPOSE ACCORDING TO THE GENERAL LAW OF CHARITY, IT FELL WITHIN THE ""GENERALLY ACCEPTED LEGAL SENSE"" OF THE TERM CHARITABLE, AS REQUIRED BY TREASURY REGULATION SECTION 1.501 (C)(3)-1(D)(2). THE IRS RULED THAT THE PROMOTION OF HEALTH, LIKE RELIEF OF POVERTY AND THE ADVANCEMENT OF EDUCATION AND RELIGION, IS ONE OF THE PURPOSES OF THE GENERAL LAW OF CHARITY THAT IS DEEMED BENEFICIAL TO THE COMMUNITY AS A WHOLE EVEN THOUGH THE CLASS OF BENEFICIARIES ELIGIBLE TO RECEIVE A DIRECT BENEFIT FROM ITS ACTIVITIES DOES NOT INCLUDE ALL MEMBERS OF THE COMMUNITY, SUCH AS INDIGENT MEMBERS OF THE COMMUNITY, PROVIDED THAT THE CLASS IS NOT SO SMALL THAT ITS RELIEF IS NOT OF BENEFIT TO THE COMMUNITY. THE IRS CONCLUDED THAT THE HOSPITAL WAS ""PROMOTING THE HEALTH OF A CLASS OF PERSONS THAT IS BROAD ENOUGH TO BENEFIT THE COMMUNITY"" BECAUSE ITS EMERGENCY ROOM WAS OPEN TO ALL AND IT PROVIDED CARE TO THOSE WHO COULD PAY, WHETHER DIRECTLY OR THROUGH THIRD-PARTY REIMBURSEMENT. OTHER FACTORS THAT DEMONSTRATED COMMUNITY BENEFIT INCLUDED: SURPLUS FUNDS WERE USED TO IMPROVE PATIENT CARE, EXPAND FACILITIES AND ADVANCE MEDICAL TRAINING, EDUCATION AND RESEARCH; AND IT WAS CONTROLLED BY A BOARD OF DIRECTORS THAT CONSISTED OF INDEPENDENT CIVIC LEADERS. THE AMERICAN HOSPITAL ASSOCIATION (""AHA"") BELIEVES THAT MEDICARE UNDERPAYMENTS (SHORTFALLS) AND BAD DEBT SHOULD BE REPORTED AS COMMUNITY BENEFIT ON FORM 990, SCHEDULE H, PART I, LINE 7. THIS ORGANIZATION AGREES WITH THE AHA'S LETTER TO THE IRS DATED AUGUST 21, 2007 RESPONDING TO A DRAFT OF THE NEW FORM 990 AND SCHEDULE H, THE AHA ARGUED THAT MEDICARE UNDERPAYMENTS (SHORTFALLS) IS COMMUNITY BENEFIT FOR THE FOLLOWING REASONS: -PROVIDING CARE FOR THE ELDERLY AND SERVING MEDICARE PATIENTS REMAINS AN ESSENTIAL PART OF THE COMMUNITY BENEFIT STANDARD. -MEDICARE, LIKE MEDICAID, DOES NOT PAY THE FULL COST OF CARE. RECENTLY, MEDICARE REIMBURSES ONLY 92 CENTS FOR EVERY DOLLAR HOSPITALS SPEND TO CARE FOR MEDICARE PATIENTS. -MANY MEDICARE PATIENTS, LIKE THEIR MEDICAID COUNTERPARTS, ARE POOR. MORE THAN 46% OF MEDICARE SPENDING IS FOR BENEFICIARIES WHOSE INCOME IS BELOW 200% OF THE FEDERAL POVERTY LEVEL. MANY ARE ALSO ELIGIBLE FOR MEDICAID, SO CALLED -DUAL ELIGIBLES"". PENNSYLVANIA REQUIRES NON-PROFIT HOSPITALS TO PROVIDE A MINIMUM LEVEL OF COMMUNITY BENEFIT TO RETAIN EXEMPTION FROM STATE AND LOCAL TAXES. ACCORDING TO STATE GUIDANCE AND CASE LAW, THE UNREIMBURSED COST OF MEDICARE AND BAD DEBT IS CONSIDERED TO BE COMMUNITY BENEFIT FOR STATE TAX EXEMPTION PURPOSES. PART III, LINE 6 ONLY INCLUDES THOSE COSTS THAT ARE PERMITTED TO BE REPORTED IN THE HOSPITAL'S MEDICARE COST REPORT THAT IS REQUIRED TO BE FILED WITH THE FEDERAL GOVERNMENT. THE HOSPITAL CONSIDERS THE TOTAL MEDICARE UNDERPAYMENTS (SHORTFALL) OF 11,912,765 SHOULD BE REPORTED AS COMMUNITY BENEFIT ON THE FORM 990, SCHEDULE H, PART I, LINE 7. ALONG WITH PROVIDING CARE TO MEDICAID PATIENTS AND PROVIDING FREE OR DISCOUNTED CARE TO OTHER LOW-INCOME PATIENTS, THE IRS COMMUNITY BENEFIT STANDARD INCLUDES THE PROVISION OF CARE TO THE ELDERLY AND MEDICARE PATIENTS. LIKE MEDICAID, MEDICARE DOES NOT PAY THE FULL COST OF PROVIDING CARE TO THESE PATIENTS, FORCING THE HOSPITAL TO USE OTHER FUNDS TO COVER THE SHORTFALL. MEDICARE SHORTFALLS MUST BE ABSORBED BY THE HOSPITAL IN ORDER TO CONTINUE TREATING THE ELDERLY IN OUR COMMUNITIES. THE HOSPITAL PROVIDES CARE REGARDLESS OF THE MEDICARE SHORTFALL AND IS THEREBY PROVIDING ACCESS TO MEDICAL SERVICES FOR THE ELDERLY AND RELIEVING THE FEDERAL GOVERNMENT OF THE BURDEN OF PAYING THE FULL COST FOR PROVIDING CARE TO MEDICARE PATIENTS. ABSENT THE MEDICARE PROGRAM, IT IS LIKELY THAT MANY MEDICARE PATIENTS WOULD BE ELIGIBLE FOR CHARITY CARE OR OTHER NEED-BASED GOVERNMENT PROGRAMS. THE AMOUNT EXPENDED TO COVER THE SHORTFALL IS MONEY NOT AVAILABLE FOR FINANCIAL ASSISTANCE AND OTHER COMMUNITY BENEFIT NEEDS. BOTH THE HOSPITAL AND THE AHA BELIEVE THAT PATIENT BAD DEBT BE REPORTED AS A COMMUNITY BENEFIT ON FORM 990, SCHEDULE H, PART I, LINE 7. LIKE MEDICARE UNDERPAYMENTS (SHORTFALLS), BAD DEBT SHOULD BE REPORTED AS COMMUNITY BENEFIT BECAUSE: -A SIGNIFICANT PORTION OF BAD DEBT IS ATTRIBUTABLE TO LOW-INCOME PATIENTS, WHO FOR MANY REASONS DECLINE TO COMPLETE THE FORMS REQUIRED TO ESTABLISH ELIGIBILITY UNDER THE HOSPITAL'S CHARITY CARE OR FINANCIAL ASSISTANCE POLICY (FAP). A 2006 CONGRESSIONAL BUDGET OFFICE (""CBO""), ""NONPROFIT HOSPITALS AND THE PROVISION OF COMMUNITY BENEFIT"", CITED TWO STUDIES INDICATING THAT ""THE GREAT MAJORITY OF BAD DEBT WAS ATTRIBUTABLE TO PATIENTS WITH INCOMES BELOW 200% OF THE FEDERAL POVERTY LINE."" -THE CBO REPORT ALSO NOTED THAT A SUBSTANTIAL PORTION OF THE BAD DEBT IS PENDING CHARITY CARE. UNLIKE BAD DEBT IN OTHER INDUSTRIES, HOSPITAL BAD DEBT IS COMPLICATED BY THE FACT THAT HOSPITALS FOLLOW THEIR CHARITABLE MISSION TO THE COMMUNITY AND TREAT EVERY PATIENT THAT COMES THROUGH THE EMERGENCY DEPARTMENT, REGARDLESS OF ABILITY TO PAY. PATIENTS WHO HAVE OUTSTANDING BILLS ARE NOT TURNED AWAY, UNLIKE OTHER INDUSTRIES. BAD DEBT IS FURTHER COMPLICATED BY THE AUDITING INDUSTRY'S STANDARDS ON REPORTING CHARITY CARE. MANY PATIENTS CANNOT OR DO NOT PROVIDE THE NECESSARY DOCUMENTATION REQUIRED TO BE DEEMED CHARITY CARE BY AUDITORS. AS A RESULT, ACCORDING TO THE CBO REPORT, ROUGHLY 40% OF BAD DEBT IS PENDING CHARITY CARE. (IN FY 2018, APPROXIMATELY 55% OF THE HOSPITAL'S BAD DEBT WAS SUBSEQUENTLY RECLASSIFIED TO CHARITY CARE.) THE CBO CONCLUDED THAT ITS FINDINGS ""SUPPORT THE VALIDITY OF THE USE OF UNCOMPENSATED CARE (BAD DEBT AND CHARITY CARE) AS A MEASURE OF COMMUNITY BENEFITS"" ASSUMING THE FINDINGS ARE GENERALIZED NATIONALLY. THE EXPERIENCE OF HOSPITALS NATIONWIDE REINFORCE THAT THEY ARE GENERALIZABLE. AS OUTLINED BY THE AHA, DESPITE THE HOSPITAL'S BEST EFFORTS AND DUE DILIGENCE, PATIENT BAD DEBT IS A PART OF THE CHARITABLE MISSION AND CHARITABLE PURPOSES. BAD DEBT REPRESENTS PART OF THE BURDEN HOSPITALS' BEAR IN SERVING ALL PATIENTS REGARDLESS OF RACE, COLOR, CREED, SEX, NATIONAL ORIGIN, RELIGION OR ABILITY TO PAY. IN ADDITION, THE HOSPITAL INVESTS SIGNIFICANT RESOURCES IN SYSTEMS AND STAFF TRAINING TO ASSIST PATIENTS THAT ARE IN NEED OF FINANCIAL ASSISTANCE. FOR FISCAL YEAR ENDED 6/30/2018, THE HOSPITAL'S COST OF PROVIDING PATIENT CARE FOR SERVICES ACCOUNTED FOR AS BAD DEBT WAS 840,251."

THIS RURAL AREA CONTAINS SOME 145,000 PEOPLE SPREAD OVER MORE THAN 2,500 SQUARE MILES OF RUGGED TERRAIN LOCATED IN THE HEART OF THE APPALACHIAN MOUNTAINS IN CENTRAL PENNSYLVANIA. THE AVERAGE POPULATION DENSITY IS APPROXIMATELY 60 PERSONS PER SQUARE MILE. THE JUNIATA RIVER RUNS ALONG THE VERDANT VALLEYS AND SLICES THROUGH NARROW MOUNTAIN PASSES TO CONNECT OUR RESIDENTS TOGETHER, WHICH IS WHY OUR AREA IS CALLED THE JUNIATA VALLEY. TRANSPORTATION BARRIERS PLAY A MAJOR ROLE IN ACCESS TO HEALTHCARE IN OUR REGION. THESE NATURAL BARRIERS INCLUDE NARROW ROADS THAT EITHER MEANDER ALONG STREAMS AND CREEKS OR CROSSOVER THE MOUNTAIN RANGES THAT TRAVERSE OUR APPALACHIAN RIDGE REGION. THESE BARRIERS ARE EVEN MORE DAUNTING GIVEN HAZARDOUS WINTER DRIVING CONDITIONS CAUSED BY SNOW OR ICE COVERED ROADS. LOW-INCOME AND SENIOR CITIZENS ALSO FACE TRANSPORTATION ISSUES, AS THERE IS NO PUBLIC TRANSPORTATION IN OUR SERVICE AREA. SENIOR CITIZENS AND MEDICAID-ELIGIBLE PERSONS CAN USE THE ""CARS"" VAN SYSTEM FOR TRANSPORTATION TO REGULARLY SCHEDULED APPOINTMENTS WITH A WEEKS' NOTICE BUT NOT FOR URGENT OR EMERGENCY CARE. LOW INCOME CITIZENS HAVE NO ACCESS TO ANY PUBLIC TRANSPORTATION AT ALL IN OUR COMMUNITY. IF A TRIP TO A SPECIALIST IS REQUIRED THE MAJOR SUPPORT HOSPITALS ARE AT LEAST A ONE AND HALF HOUR DRIVE AWAY. THE POPULATION OF OUR TOTAL SERVICE AREA IS JUST ABOUT 145,000 PERSONS BASED ON 2010 US CENSUS DATA. MIFFLIN COUNTY HAS A RELATIVELY FLAT GROWTH RATE WITH A POPULATION CHANGE OF 0.4% FROM 2000 TO 2010. JUNIATA COUNTY, ON THE OTHER HAND, HAS SEEN SIGNIFICANT GROWTH WITH A 10.6% INCREASE IN POPULATION FROM 2000 TO 2010. IT IS BELIEVED THAT THIS GROWTH IS MOSTLY COMING FROM PEOPLE WHO WORK IN THE NEARBY HARRISBURG AREA WHO ARE LOOKING FOR A LOWER COST OF LIVING. WITH THE RECENT COMPLETION OF A NEW FOUR-LANE HIGHWAY NORTH OF HARRISBURG, THE COMMUTE TO HARRISBURG HAS BECOME MORE CONVENIENT RESULTING IN AN INCREASE IN JUNIATA COUNTY'S POPULATION AS PEOPLE MOVE FURTHER AWAY FROM THE URBAN AREAS TO LIVE IN THE COUNTRY. HIGHER GROWTH IN FULTON COUNTY IS EXPLAINED BY MIGRATION FROM MARYLAND AS PEOPLE TRY TO MOVE AWAY FROM HIGHER HOUSING COSTS IN MARYLAND. HUNTINGDON COUNTY'S GROWTH IS MOSTLY OCCURRING IN THE NORTHERN PORTION OF THE COUNTY THAT IS CLOSE ENOUGH TO STATE COLLEGE TO ALLOW RESIDENTS TO COMMUTE TO PENN STATE UNIVERSITY. THESE GROWTH RATES ARE STILL VERY LOW WHEN COMPARED TO A NATIONAL GROWTH RATE OF OVER 13%. OTHER IMPORTANT DEMOGRAPHIC STATISTICS ARE OUTLINED BELOW.

THE PENNSYLVANIA AVERAGE FOR THIS STATISTIC IS 15.4%. BOTH MIFFLIN AND JUNIATA COUNTIES HAVE HIGHER PERCENTAGES OF PERSONS LESS THAN 18 YEARS OF AGE, 23.1% AND 24.0% RESPECTIVELY, THAN THE PA AVERAGE OF 22.0%. BOTH OF THESE GROUPS REQUIRE MORE HEALTH CARE RESOURCES THAN OTHER AGE GROUPS IN OUR COMMUNITY. MIFFLIN COUNTY HAS 16.6% OF THE POPULATION WITH INCOME BELOW THE POVERTY LINE AND 28.1% OF CHILDREN UNDER 18 LIVING IN POVERTY. JUNIATA COUNTY HAS 11.1% OF THE POPULATION WITH INCOME BELOW THE POVERTY LINE, WHILE HUNTINGDON AND SNYDER COUNTIES ARE 13% AND 14% RESPECTIVELY.

201941289349301414,231352222,"Part III, Line 3 - Methodology of Estimated Amount & Rationale for Including in Community Benefit",The estimate of bad debt attributable to charity care policy was calculated by dividing the bad debt amount that was originally coded bad debt but later found to qualify as charity care by the amount coded to the charity care write-off codes. This ratio is applied to the bad debt cost factor expense.

These records include the amount of charges forgone based on established rates for services and supplies furnished under its charity care and community service policies and the estimated cost of these services. Payments from Medicare are generally less than York Hospital's costs of providing the service.

Upon final PARO (Payment Assistance Rank Ordering) scoring, if a patient qualifies for presumptive charity, their account would not be forwarded to any third party collections. It shall be the policy of Patient Administrative Services to recommend accounts to Bad Debt on a timely basis. Inpatient/Outpatient accounts will go to bad debt automatically after the account has been in the financial class Pending Bad Debt for 30 days. All accounts must follow the approved limits for refunds and write offs, as established in Policy PF-102, before being transferred. The primary agencies will work the accounts for 6 months or until they feel it is uncollectable and return the account. The accounts are forwarded to secondary agencies from the primary agencies Closed and Return Reports. The financial class is changed to Bad Debt Other after the Closed and Return Reports are received from the Secondary Agency. The agencies must get written approval from the manager in the relatively rare instance of legal action being taken to collect the debt."
201941289349301414,231352222,"Part VI, Line 2 - Needs Assessment","WellSpan Health and its entities have a long history of understanding and responding to the needs of the communities and populations it serves. This commitment was strengthened in 1998 when, in partnership with the Healthy York County Coalition, WellSpan conducted its first Community Health Needs Assessment (CHNA). Five subsequent CHNAs were conducted in 2000, 2005, 2008, 2012 and 2015. These assessments one method for collecting diverse information on a community and which involves surveying a representative sample of community members on their demographics, chronic health conditions, lifestyle behaviors, finances, access to health services, and related topics have been administered before the Affordable Care Act (ACA) requirement. As previously noted, the WellSpan CHNA process, which includes survey development, data collection and analysis, and result dissemination, was led by both county-level health coalitions Healthy Adams County and the Healthy York County Coalition. These coalitions receive financial support from WellSpan Health and its entities, and other community stakeholders. The following community organizations partnered to provide guidance and support to the 2015 CHNA: County of York; Family First Health; Hanover Hospital; TrueNorth Wellness Services; United Way of York County; York City Health Bureau; York College of Pennsylvania, and; York County Community Foundation. Additional consulting support was provided through a contract with the Floyd Institute for Public Policy at Franklin and Marshall College. Dr. Berwood Yost, Institute Director and Project has an extensive background conducting and analyzing community and corporate surveys, and has been integral to the prior two CHNAs (2008 and 2012). This collaboration of community stakeholders: determined the survey questions to be asked of the community; discussed data collection methodology, including sample size and method of obtaining data; reviewed the raw data and supporting charts/graphs; identified potential community health priorities, and; developed the process by which results and priorities were to be shared with the community.The 2015 CHNA planning process engaged a wide range of community organizations serving the diverse interests of all partners without burdening CHNA respondents with too many questions. Committee members reviewed questions asked in the 2012 CHNA and edited accordingly based on the current health care environment and areas of interest. Survey questions were derived from the Behavioral Risk Factor Surveillance System (BRFSS), a validated survey tool utilized by the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC), and organized into four categories: healthcare access, behavioral risk, health conditions, and prevention behaviors and context. A representative sample of 1,028 adult residents in York County were interviewed between October 27 and December 12, 2014. Supplemental secondary data from the Robert Wood Johnson Foundation (RWJF) annual County Health Rankings and from the Pennsylvania Department of Health was compiled and integrated into the 2015 CHNA. Data collected and analyzed by the Floyd Institute for Public Policy included breakdowns by age, gender, geographic area, race/ethnicity, and income level, and enabled the development of charts/graphs focused on: quantity of residents affected; health risks and disability-adjusted life years; correlates of obesity and depression (two significant health priorities); health disparities, and; social determinants of health impact. This information is included in the 2015 Community Health Needs Assessment Summary Report available at www.wellspan.org. In 2015, CHNA results and related priorities identified by the Healthy York County Coalition were shared with the system-wide Planning Committee at WellSpan Health. This Committee is comprised of community members and leaders that represent each of WellSpans primary entities and service areas, in addition to corporate leadership. Planning Committee members reviewed the CHNA data, adopted HYCCs priorities of adult overweight/obesity, depression/mental health, and maternal/child health while also identifying two additional priorities pertinent to WellSpan Health: access related to gaps in care caused by high-deductible insurance plans and the emerging opioid misuse and abuse issue facing the community. These five priorities and associated data were subsequently presented to the WellSpan-York Hospital Board for their adoption. Board members discussed the data and identified priorities within the context of existing staffing and financial resources, current and future entity initiatives, and community partnership opportunities to address systemic community change."
201941289349301414,231352222,"Part VI, Line 5 - Promotion of Community Health","As a charitable, community-based healthcare organization, our commitment to improving the lives and well-being of the people and communities we serve is evident in our mission statement:working as one to improve health through exceptional care for all, lifelong wellness, and healthier communities.""Employees live out this mission statement every day by engaging in community benefit activities that address community needs, especially the five health priorities identified in the 2015 CHNA - adult overweight/obesity; access related to gaps in care caused by high-deductible insurance plans; depression/mental health; maternal/child health, and opioid misuse and abuse. Below are a few examples of the work accomplished to address each:*Access to healthcare and medications for uninsured community members or those with high out-of-pocket costs is often financially challenging. Healthy Community Network, a collaborative between WellSpan Health, physicians and community partners to support prospective enrollment, the management and support of patients, and coordination of care, serves as a support for those individuals, offering free or discounted resources based on need. In addition, through support of the Family First Health Hannah Penn Center, 2,639 acute and preventative visits were provided to underserved adults and children.*In 2018, WellSpan Health encouraged community members, local employers and employees, and WellSpan staff and patients to engage in the 6th annual 10 Pound Throwdown initiative. The 10 Pound Throwdown is a 10-week community challenge that encourages participants to lose or maintain a healthy weight through healthier eating and increased physical activity. The initiative was created to address the growing issue of adult overweight/obesity, and utilizes a core website (www.10poundthrowdown.com) to encourage team participation and to offer an online weight tracker, badges to encourage healthier choices, and diverse health education resources. Nearly 5800 community members across four southcentral Pennsylvania counties -Adams, Lancaster, Lebanon, and York- participated in the 2018 iteration of the 10 Pound Throwdown program. *Feeling Blue is a depression awareness campaign that engages community members, clients of services, and mental health professionals in efforts to reduce the stigma and enhance the awareness of depression in York County. The Feeling Blue group teamed up with the Jewish Community Center and a locally owned theatre arts group to provide a theatrical event and group discussion of mental health in spring 2018. The event, named Breaking Blue, was sponsored by a WellSpan Community Partnership Grant. The Breaking Blue event also featured a resource fair, highlighting the services available in the region. One of the many resources highlighted was the National Alliance on Mental Illness (NAMI), who also received Community Partnership grant funds. NAMI utilized the funds to implement healthy cooking classes and nutrition education for individuals with mental illness. *Community Partnership Grant funds also assisted with the establishment of safe, comfortable and compassionate end-of-life care in York County. WellSpan Health worked with community partners to support the development of Pappus House, a special home dedicated to offering personalized end-of-life care for individuals and their families, in collaboration with hospice providers. WellSpan worked with Pappus House to identify patients who would benefit from care in the homes unique environment. *Celebrating more than a decade of promoting summertime physical activity, Get Outdoors (GO) York!, a partnership between WellSpan-York Hospital and York County Libraries, 9,000 children participated in an adaptation of letterboxing, an international hobby where participants use written clues to find items hidden in various places. More than 1,143 participants (12.7%) submitted their program rubbing sheets and collectively walked a total of 22,250 miles.*Opioid use, as in other communities across the United States, has become a crisis in York County. A WellSpan Family Physician and faculty member, who also serves as the Medical Director at York City Bureau of Health, leads the York Regional Opiate Collaborative. WellSpan continues to support this position financially along with key community partners committed to this cause. In 2018 alone, faith leaders, business managers, and school nurses attended educational presentations on the topic of opioid use and misuse provided by WellSpan staff.*WellSpan Health -York Hospital primary care practices in York County participated in the Market Bucks program- 15 practices engaged over 130 patients- to address food insecurity and increase the consumption of fruits and vegetables. This program reaches those with an elevated Body Mass Index (BMI) who also experience a comorbidity associated with diet. The program provides fruit and vegetable vouchers to be redeemed at local farmers markets and encourages healthy eating. Market Bucks boasts an astounding 86% redemption rate and contributes over $27,000 to the regional economy each year, in addition to demonstrating increased fruit and vegetable consumption for participants. Historically, WellSpan Health and its entities have taken planned steps to build community capacity that addresses complex health issues, as identified by the Community Health Needs Assessment (CHNA). Through financial and management support of a county health coalition, the Healthy York County Coalition (HYCC), more than 200 York County community members have been engaged in community health improvement initiatives. HYCC consists of three committees -Access and Empowerment; Community Engagement, and; Prevention and Wellness, each of which continue to attract new community members, leaders, and professionals. These committees foster partnerships and collaboration between entities to ensure that efforts to address and impact identified community health needs are coordinated and successful.Additional examples of how WellSpan-York Hospital fulfilled its community mission in York County may be found in the 2018 WellSpan Community Benefit Report - It's What Neighbors Do - available online at www.wellspan.org."

For inpatient services, the limit is the TEFRA target limit. The hospital, on occasion, exceeds the target rate and does not receive full cost reimbursement. The TEFRA target amount is updated by the Medicare program annually by the TEFRA updating factor. However, the amount of the TEFRA updating factor is always significantly less than the actual healthcare inflation factor because the Medicare program includes a ""budget neutrality"" factor for the overall Medicare program. For outpatient services, the limit is the payment to cost ratio (PCR). The PCR was established using a base year, which was 1996, at a rate of 85.5% of cost. The PCR for all exempt cancer centers was 91% through 12/31/17, and then 88% from 1/1/18 to 5/31/18; therefore, the hospital currently does not receive payment for a range of 9% to 12% of its outpatient cost."

The charges for clinical departments are matched to the total cost for these departments for a cost-to-charge ratio.

Northwell uses FPG to determine eligibility and utilizes the New York State Department of Health (NYSDOH) guidelines regarding the consideration of assets. Asset tests cannot be used to deny financial assistance, but only to upgrade a patients level of obligation, up to the legal maximum permitted under the financial assistance law. Part I, Line 6a: The Community Benefit report is prepared by the hospital, in conjunction with an affiliated entity (Northwell) of the hospital. The Community Benefit Report is accessible to the public and can be accessed on the Northwell website: https://www.northwell.edu/about/our-organization/office-community-and-publ ic-health/reports. Part I, 7: Row (a) The cost of charity care was determined by utilizing the ratio of cost to charges (RCC) calculated on Worksheet 2 applied to gross charges written off for patients qualifying for charity under the hospitals financial assistance policy. Bad Debt was not reported in any row of Part I, Line 7. Row (b) The Ratio of Cost to Charges method (or RCC) is used to determine the cost of ancillary services. A RCC is developed from these costs, and that RCC is applied to total Medicaid gross ancillary services charges to determine the cost of services provided to Medicaid patients. Row (e) Costs associated with Community Health Improvement Services were determined by adding indirect or overhead costs to the direct costs of the activity. Indirect costs were calculated as a percentage of direct costs. Direct costs for staff expenses were calculated using average system hourly rates, and were adjusted to account for fringe benefits, using a blended rate based on the ratio of total employee benefit expenses to total salary and wages. Row (f) The Bad Debt Expense that appears on Form 990, Part IX, Line 25 column (A), but not included for purposes of calculating the percentage in this column is equal to the amount reported on Form 990, Part X. The costs related to health professions education were determined by utilizing the step down method of cost finding. Row (h) Costs associated with research activities were determined by adding indirect, or overhead, costs to the direct costs of the activity. Indirect costs were calculated as a percentage of costs. Row (i) The cost of in-kind contributions to community groups is comprised of the direct costs of personnel whose compensated time was donated to various charities and community groups. The salaries and wages were adjusted to include benefits using a rate based on the ratio of total employee benefit expenses to total salary and wages. Indirect costs were calculated as a percentage of direct costs. Column (f) for Rows (c)-(k) The percentage of Net Community Benefit Expense divided by Total Expense for the hospital (to calculate the percent of total expense). Note: For the entire Northwell Health Inc. and affiliates, Part I, Line 7 (Row K, Column F) is approximately 11.96 as a percentage of expenses. Part II: All community building activities improve access to health services and address federal, state, or local public health priorities, as well as leverage public health department activities, and in doing so, they provide relief of government burden. These activities broadly serve low-income, underserved patients, and include: collaboration with various community coalitions, system-wide recycling initiative, organizational response to worldly disasters, and bioterrorism efforts. Northwells bioterrorism & disaster preparedness includes Center for Emergency Medical Services, has a designated Bioterrorism Resource Center, and has conducted staff training for more than 100 hospitals and area first responders and invested heavily in the infrastructure needed for large-scale emergencies. During catastrophes (both natural and terrorism), Northwell provides a safe haven for thousands of patients, outside nursing home residents, and community members seeking shelter. Northwell assists with the transport of patients and stand ready to contribute food, medicine, and blankets for both affiliated and non-affiliated hospital patients. Investment in a field hospital has furthered the public health infrastructure needed for mass casualties that could result from a terrorist attack, natural attack, or large-scale emergency. Part III, Line 2: For patients who were determined by Northwell to have the ability to pay but did not, the uncollected amounts are recorded as bad debt expense. The amount of gross charges written off is reduced by any charity care or other discounts provided to the patient, as well as any payments received. Bad debt expense reported on this line is reported net of governmental or private offsetting funds. Part III, Line 3: N/A Part III, Line 4: For patients who were determined by Northwell to have the ability to pay but did not, the uncollected amounts are recorded as bad debt expense. Part III, Line 8: Medicare costs are determined utilizing a combination of the step down method of cost findings and a cost per unit of service. Cost per unit of service is used to calculate the routine cost of services provided to Medicare patients. The Ratio of Cost to Charges method (or RCC) is used to determine the cost of ancillary services. An RCC is developed from these costs, and that RCC is applied to total Medicare gross ancillary services charges to determine the cost of services provided to Medicare patients. Part III, Line 9b: The organizations collection policy is standard to all accounts regardless of insurance status (e.g. insured, underinsured, and uninsured). The hospitals collection policy states that they will not send patient accounts to collection if a decision on a financial assistance application is pending, or if a patient is determined to be eligible for Medicaid at the time services were rendered and for which services Medicaid payment is available. Question 2: NEEDS ASSESSMENT: The Community Health Needs Assessment (CHNA) is performed on an ongoing basis. Northwell conducts and participates in population, demographic, and health status evaluations of our respective hospitals service areas based on county regions and the communities we serve. There is a special effort to include individuals with health disparities and organizations who serve these communities in the CHNA process. The CHNA includes the analysis of primary and secondary data. Multi-year analyses, trends and projections are developed, which identify areas of need for the continuum of health care services. Primary data is obtained through a combination of qualitative analysis of community-based organization (CBO), informant interviews and surveys, individual community member surveys, and participation in collaborative partner meetings. These meetings include representatives from the Departments of Health, CBOs, academic institutions, government agencies, and hospitals. Ongoing input concerning our communities needs is also obtained through: our Board of Trustees/Directors who are all area residents and leaders in their respective communities; facility based advisory boards and councils, and; the feedback received by our facility administrators and clinicians that serve on local community agency boards. Secondary data analysis includes: internal hospital data, including Prevention Quality Indicators (PQI); Department of Health Community Health Assessments; local regional NYS Prevention Agenda data sources; and Statewide Planning and Research System (SPARCS) data. The Committee on Community Health, a committee of the Board of Trustees, provides recommendations that concern Northwells community health priorities and interventions based on the CHNA. Committee discussions focus on New York State (NYS) Prevention Agenda Priority Areas, including strategies and intervention outcomes related to chronic disease prevention, women and childrens health, healthy safe environments, health access, mental health and substance abuse, HIV/AIDS/STDs and community immunizations. Regional departments of health (I.E. Nassau County Department of Health, Suffolk County Department of Health Services, and NYC Department of Health and Mental Hygiene) perform additional community health assessments (CHA) with the input of hospital and community stakeholders. These regional partners use strategies such as community member surveys, CBO surveys, and public listening sessions to solicit information on community needs. Together with other healthcare organizations and CBOs, Northwell participates in meetings organized by these regional departments of health academic organizations to discuss the shared responsibility of public health planning within the NYS Prevention Agenda. These meetings provide an opportunity for general discussion regarding the public health goals of the NYS Prevention Agenda and the selection of shared priorities for collaborative regional planning.

C., Living Centers and the Homestead estimate the amount to be recognized in the consolidated financial statements for doubtful accounts by analyzing specific patient and resident accounts for collectability and also by applying historically established percentages for self-pay and various third-party payers to the aging categories in the accounts receivable aging for each operation. Accounts for which no payments have been received for a significant amount of time are considered delinquent and the accounts are written-off when customary collection efforts are exhausted. There were no significant changes in the calculation of the allowance for doubtful accounts in 2017.Part III, Section A, 3Costing Methodology:HFMA P&P Board Statement 15, IX. Valuation and Disclosure of Bad Debts, 9.1 has been applied to the amount reported on line 2. The bad debt amount is recorded at the amount that the payer is expected to pay. The amount reported on line 3 is valued at patient care cost, i. e. the expected payment amount included in line 2 has been multiplied by the ratio of patient care cost to charges (34.5%). Based upon an analysis of income levels for accounts included in bad debts we estimated that 27% were eligible under the financial assistance program.Rationale for including a portion of bad debt amount as community benefit:It is not always possible to obtain sufficient information to make a determination of eligibility for financial assistance or reclassify bad debts as charity care. When income levels are learned we identify individuals unable to pay for services. Having provided services to those individuals we believe represents a community benefit."

We are developing initiatives, and designing our facilities with patient-centered, evidence-based, outcome driven goals in mind. Our team has been working to achieve the best quality care outcomes to keep patients healthy and to develop prevention-oriented programs aimed at creating and sustaining healthy communities. We base programming on areas of health and wellness that matter most in our communities. That is determined by conducting health needs assessments in our communities.Finger Lakes Health collaborates with public health departments in our service area, as well as the S2AY Rural Health Network, Finger Lakes Health Systems Agency (now Common Ground Health), and other human services providers in our service area, to use the framework of the NYS Health Commissioner's ""Prevention Agenda"" as a basis for our community health planning.

THE SUBSTANTIAL DIFFERENCES IN THE SOCIO-DEMOGRAPHICS BETWEEN RESIDENTS OF SYRACUSE AND THE REST OF ONONDAGA COUNTY LEAD TO GEOGRAPHIC DISPARITIES IN HEALTH STATUS AND ARE A CRUCIAL CONSIDERATION DURING THE COMMUNITY HEALTH PLANNING PROCESS. IN ONONDAGA COUNTY THE MEDIAN AGE IS 38.8 YEARS WHILE IN SYRACUSE THE MEDIAN AGE IS 29.9 YEARS. WOMEN COMPRISE 51.8% OF THE POPULATION IN THE COUNTY AND 53% IN SYRACUSE.

Mercy Hospital obtained information about the requirements and sought to implement them accordingly, but later identified some compliance gaps.The issues were discovered in fiscal year 2018 during an internal audit of Mercy Hospitals compliance with Sections 501(r). To ensure full compliance with Section 501(r) regulations, Northern Light Healths Community Health and Revenue Cycle Departments perform routine reviews to assure Mercy Hospital is in compliance with Section 501(r). In addition, Northern Light Health continues to engage Northern Light Health Internal Audit to review Mercy Hospitals compliance with Section 501(r).Specific issues and corrections:1. Incorrect calculation of Amounts Generally Billed (AGB) a. Requirement: A hospital facility may determine AGB for any emergency or other medically necessary care it provides to a FAP-eligible individual by multiplying the hospital facilitys gross charges for the care by one or more percentages of gross charges (AGB percentage(s)). A hospital facility using this method must calculate its AGB percentage(s) at least annually by dividing the sum of the amounts of all of its claims for emergency and other medically necessary care that have been allowed by health insurers during a prior 12-month period by the sum of the associated gross charges for those claims.b. Condition: Mercy Hospital incorrectly calculated the AGB because it did not use actual amounts allowed by health insurers or associated gross charges in its calculation of AGB. Instead, Mercy Hospital used adjusted net patient revenue divided by adjusted gross patient revenue in calculating the AGB.c. Corrective Action: In response, Mercy Hospital recalculated the AGB using the required data and retroactively adjusted its AGB for FY 2017 and 2018 to the correct percentage. Mercy Hospital has identified 1246 patient accounts affected by the correction and to date has corrected 972 accounts and has adjusted $67,979 in order to restore each affected individual to the position in which he or she would have been had the failure not have occurred. Of this total adjustment amount, $12,409 was actually required to be refunded to the individual; the remainder was in the form of accounting adjustments only. At this time Mercy Hospital has 274 accounts remaining to be corrected with an anticipated total adjustment of $39,956. d. Date Corrected: The new AGB was calculated in December 2018 and for 501(r) compliance purposes Mercy Hospital applied the correct AGB to all patient accounts as of the beginning of October 2018. By October 1, 2019, Mercy Hospital expects to restore each remaining affected individual to the position in which he or she would have been had the failure not have occurred.2. Widely Publicizeda. Requirement: In order to ensure the FAP is widely publicized, a hospital must take several actions, one of which is to make the FAP, FAP application form and a plain language summary of the FAP widely available on a Web site.b. Condition: On October 22, 2018, it was discovered that the link from Mercy Hospitals Billing Help Web page did not map correctly to the Northern Light Health Financial Assistance page.c. Corrective Action: Northern Light Health Information Technology was contacted to resolve the mapping issue.

WE PROVIDE EXCELLENT AND COMPASSIONATE CARE AND RESPONSIVE SERVICE. AS WE SEEK TO UNDERSTAND AND FULLY MEET OUR PATIENTS' CURRENT AND FUTURE NEEDS AND EXPECTATIONS, WE RECOGNIZE OUR RESPONSIBILITY TO PRUDENTLY USE THE SCARCE RESOURCES ENTRUSTED TO US. LAWS, REGULATIONS, CATASTROPHIC ILLNESSES AND THE RISING COSTS OF NEW TECHNOLOGY HAVE CREATED A CATEGORY OF PATIENTS WHO ARE EITHER UNINSURED OR UNDERINSURED. THIS CHARITY CARE PROGRAM HAS BEEN DEVELOPED TO HELP THE HOSPITAL MEET THE NEEDS OF THESE PATIENTS AND, CONCURRENTLY, MAINTAIN THE FINANCIAL VIABILITY OF THE HOSPITAL FOR FUTURE GENERATIONS. THIS CHARITY CARE POLICY EXPLAINS HOW THE HOSPITAL ASSISTS PATIENTS WHO CANNOT PAY FOR PART OR ALL OF THE ESSENTIAL MEDICAL CARE THEY RECEIVE. PRINCIPLES: STRONG MEMORIAL HOSPITAL PROACTIVELY CONVEYS INFORMATION ABOUT THIS CHARITY CARE POLICY TO PATIENTS AND THEIR FAMILIES. - WE BELIEVE THAT FEAR OF A HOSPITAL BILL SHOULD NEVER GET IN THE WAY OF ESSENTIAL HEALTH SERVICES. THE PROVISION OF URGENT OR EMERGENT HEALTHCARE IS NEVER DELAYED PENDING A FINANCIAL ASSISTANCE DETERMINATION. SIGNS ANNOUNCING THE CHARITY CARE PROGRAM ARE POSTED IN THE HOSPITAL (E.G. EMERGENCY DEPARTMENT, ADMITTING OFFICE) TO PROACTIVELY CONVEY THIS MESSAGE TO PROSPECTIVE PATIENTS AND THE PUBLIC IN GENERAL. - WE MAINTAIN FINANCIAL AID POLICIES THAT ARE CONSISTENT WITH THE MISSION, VALUES AND CAPACITY OF THE HOSPITAL AND THAT TAKE INTO ACCOUNT EACH INDIVIDUAL'S ABILITY TO CONTRIBUTE TO THE COST OF HIS OR HER CARE. - WE COMMUNICATE THE AVAILABILITY OF FINANCIAL AID IN A MANNER THAT IS CLEAR, UNDERSTANDABLE, SENSITIVE TO THE PATIENT'S DIGNITY, AND IN MULTIPLE LANGUAGES. A NOTICE IS AVAILABLE AT REGISTRATION SITES THAT INFORMS PATIENTS OF THIS PROGRAM AND PROVIDES THE PHONE NUMBER TO CALL TO OBTAIN MORE INFORMATION AND TO APPLY FOR THIS PROGRAM. DESIGNATED STAFF ARE PROVIDED DETAILED TRAINING SO THAT THEY CAN PROVIDE INFORMATION AND ANSWER QUESTIONS ABOUT THE CHARITY CARE PROGRAM. INFORMATION IS GENERALLY AVAILABLE IN BOTH ENGLISH AND SPANISH. WHEN REQUESTED, IT WILL ALSO BE MADE AVAILABLE IN OTHER LANGUAGES. - INFORMATION REGARDING OUR CHARITY CARE PROGRAM IS ALSO AVAILABLE ON THE URMC WEBSITE. - WE IMPLEMENT FINANCIAL AID PROCEDURES THAT ARE CONSUMER-FRIENDLY, RESPECTFUL, AND CONFIDENTIAL, AS WELL AS DEBT COLLECTION POLICIES THAT REFLECT THE MISSION AND VALUES OF THIS HOSPITAL. - WE WORK WITH GOVERNMENT, PAYERS, BUSINESS, CONSUMER GROUPS AND OTHERS TO ADDRESS THE UNDERLYING PROBLEM THAT TOO MANY NEW YORKERS LACK HEALTH INSURANCE. GENERAL GUIDELINES: AS PART OF FINANCIAL PLANNING ASSISTANCE, WE PROVIDE PATIENTS, AND/OR THEIR LEGAL REPRESENTATIVE, WITH INFORMATION ABOUT THE CRITERIA THAT MUST BE MET IN ORDER TO OBTAIN MEDICAID, MEDICARE, OR OTHER HEALTH INSURANCES. PATIENTS ARE ASSISTED IN MAKING APPLICATIONS FOR ANY OF THESE INSURANCES OR DISCOUNTED FEE PLANS. PATIENTS ARE EXPECTED TO PARTICIPATE FULLY IN ALL EFFORTS TO OBTAIN ANY INSURANCE FOR WHICH THEY MAY QUALIFY. UNDER CERTAIN CIRCUMSTANCES, AS DETERMINED BY THE FINANCIAL CASE MANAGERS OR OTHER HOSPITAL SENIOR ADMINISTRATORS. APPLICATIONS FOR MEDICAID, MEDICARE OR OTHER INSURANCE PROGRAMS MAY BE WAIVED WHEN DEEMED UNNECESSARY. IF AVAILABLE INSURANCE BENEFITS ARE NOT SUFFICIENT TO COVER THE COST OF THEIR CARE, PATIENTS MAY THEN APPLY FOR ASSISTANCE FROM THE CHARITY CARE PROGRAM. CHARITY CARE APPLICATIONS MUST BE COMPLETED AND RETURNED TO THE HOSPITAL WITH THE REQUESTED INCOME DOCUMENTATION. PATIENTS WILL NOT RECEIVE CHARITY CARE ASSISTANCE IF THEY (A) DO NOT COMPLETE THE APPLICATION PROCESS FOR MEDICAID OR OTHER INSURANCE FOR WHICH THEY MAY QUALIFY, (B) ELECT NOT TO MAKE APPLICATION FOR CHARITY CARE, OR (C) HAVE ADEQUATE RESOURCES OR INCOME TO PAY PRIVATELY FOR THEIR CARE. IN THESE SITUATIONS, THEY WILL REMAIN FINANCIALLY RESPONSIBLE FOR FULL PAYMENT OF THEIR HOSPITAL BILLS. CHARITY CARE ASSISTANCE IS AVAILABLE FOR PATIENTS WHO RESIDE IN NEW YORK STATE AND RECEIVE EMERGENCY HOSPITAL SERVICES, INCLUDING EMERGENCY TRANSFERS, AND TO PATIENTS WHO RESIDE IN STRONG MEMORIAL HOSPITAL'S PRIMARY SERVICE AREA IN NEW YORK STATE WHO RECEIVE SERVICES IN DESIGNATED STRONG MEMORIAL HOSPITAL PROGRAMS, INCLUDING MOST INPATIENT AND OUTPATIENT SERVICES. IN ADDITION, THE HOSPITAL MAY, IN ITS DISCRETION, GRANT CHARITY CARE TO INDIVIDUALS WHO RESIDE OUTSIDE OF NEW YORK STATE. CHARITY CARE ASSISTANCE DOES NOT COVER MEDICALLY UNNECESSARY CARE, COSMETIC ALTERATION, TELEPHONE, TELEVISION AND PRIVATE ROOM CHARGES. IT DOES NOT COVER SERVICES GENERATED BY AN INSURED PATIENT WHO CHOOSES TO RECEIVE CARE AT AN OUT-OF-NETWORK HOSPITAL, OR WHO FAILS TO COMPLY WITH INSURANCE POLICY REQUIREMENTS (E.G. UNAUTHORIZED SERVICES) NOR DOES IT APPLY TO NON-RESIDENT ALIENS (UNLESS APPROVED IN ADVANCE OF CARE BEING PROVIDED), TO DRUGS NOT ADMINISTERED IN THE HOSPITAL, TO TRANSPORTATION FURNISHED BY THIRD PARTY VENDORS, OR TO CARE, SERVICES, DRUGS OR SUPPLIES FOR THE PURPOSE OF GENDER CHANGE PROCEDURE. SPECIFIC QUESTIONS ABOUT SERVICES THAT ARE NOT COVERED SHOULD BE DIRECTED TO THE PATIENT ACCOUNTS MANAGER OR THEIR DELEGATE. FINANCIAL GUIDELINES: FINANCIAL AID IS INTENDED TO ASSIST THOSE INDIVIDUALS WHO CANNOT AFFORD TO PAY IN PART OR IN FULL FOR THEIR CARE. IT SHOULD TAKE INTO ACCOUNT EACH INDIVIDUAL'S ABILITY TO CONTRIBUTE TO THE COST OF HIS OR HER CARE. HOSPITAL FINANCIAL AID SHOULD NOT BE VIEWED AS A SUBSTITUTE FOR EMPLOYER-SPONSORED OR INDIVIDUALLY PURCHASED INSURANCE. PATIENTS WITHOUT INSURANCE AND WITH INCOME THAT WOULD QUALIFY THEM FOR THE CHARITY CARE PROGRAM BUT ALSO HAVE SUBSTANTIAL RESOURCES (OTHER THAN TAX-DEFERRED OR COMPARABLE RETIREMENT SAVINGS OR COLLEGE SAVINGS ACCOUNTS) MAY BE EXPECTED TO PAY PART OF THEIR BILLS(S). CHARITY CARE ASSISTANCE IS GENERALLY AVAILABLE TO INDIVIDUALS WHOSE INCOME IS LESS THAN OR EQUAL TO 400% OF THE FEDERAL POVERTY LEVEL. HOWEVER, PATIENTS WHO HAVE EXHAUSTED THEIR INSURANCE BENEFITS, EXCEEDED FINANCIAL ELIGIBILITY CRITERIA, FACE EXTRAORDINARY MEDICAL COSTS, OR WHO HAVE OTHER UNIQUE CIRCUMSTANCES MAY BE CONSIDERED FOR CHARITY CARE APPROVAL IN THE HOSPITAL'S SOLE DISCRETION. WHILE APPLICATION FOR MEDICAID OR OTHER INSURANCE IS USUALLY REQUIRED, THE HOSPITAL MAY, AT ITS SOLE DISCRETION, IN APPROPRIATE CASES, ALSO CONSIDER PATIENTS FOR CHARITY CARE WHEN THEY MEET THE FINANCIAL CRITERIA OF THIS PROGRAM, BUT HAVE NOT SATISFACTORILY COMPLETED ALL THE REQUIREMENTS OF THE CHARITY CARE APPLICATION PROCESS. THIS MAY INCLUDE PATIENTS WHO HAVE BEEN SANCTIONED BY MEDICAID, HAVE FILED BANKRUPTCY OR APPEAR TO BE ELIGIBLE FOR CHARITY CARE ASSISTANCE BASED ON AVAILABLE INFORMATION. ELIGIBILITY DETERMINATIONS IN COMPLEX CASE CIRCUMSTANCES WILL BE MADE AFTER CONSIDERATION BY THE CHARITY CARE REVIEW TEAM THAT INCLUDES THE CHARITY CARE OFFICER, FINANCIAL CASE MANAGER AND/OR THEIR MANAGERS, OR MAY BE MADE BY SENIOR HOSPITAL ADMINISTRATORS. THE AMOUNT OF THE DISCOUNT AFFORDED TO QUALIFIED CHARITY CARE PATIENTS WILL BE DETERMINED THROUGH ASSESSMENT OF THE RESPONSIBLE PARTY'S ANNUAL HOUSEHOLD INCOME AND THE NUMBER OF PEOPLE IN THE HOME, AS A PERCENTAGE OF THE FEDERAL POVERTY GUIDELINE AMOUNTS FOR SAME SIZE HOUSEHOLDS. THE FINANCIAL GUIDELINES WILL BE UPDATED ANNUALLY IN CONJUNCTION WITH THE FEDERAL POVERTY UPDATES PUBLISHED BY CMS. PATIENTS MAY RECEIVE FULL OR PARTIAL DISCOUNT FROM THE COST OF CARE, DEPENDING ON THE PERCENTAGE OF THE GUIDELINES MATCHED BY THE PATIENT'S HOUSEHOLD INCOME. ANY BILL AMOUNT REMAINING AFTER APPLICATION OF A PARTIAL CHARITY CARE DISCOUNT IS THE RESPONSIBILITY OF THE PATIENT. THE AMOUNT AN APPROVED CHARITY CARE PATIENT WILL GENERALLY BE EXPECTED TO PAY FOR SERVICES COVERED BY THE POLICY WILL BE LIMITED TO THE LOWER OF THE AMOUNT THAT THE HOSPITAL WOULD HAVE RECEIVED FOR THE SAME SERVICE UNDER MEDICARE PARTS A AND B, (INCLUDING COINSURANCE, CO-PAYMENTS AND DEDUCTIBLES) OR THE USUAL AND CUSTOMARY CHARGES. THE PATIENT WILL BE ASSISTED BY THE HOSPITAL IN MAKING ARRANGEMENTS TO SATISFY ANY BALANCE REMAINING ON THE ACCOUNT(S) AFTER THE APPLICATION OF THE APPROPRIATE CHARITY CARE DISCOUNT BY USE OF A PAYMENT PLAN. THE MONTHLY PAYMENTS UNDER SUCH PLANS SHALL NOT EXCEED TEN PERCENT (10%) OF THE ELIGIBLE PATIENT'S GROSS MONTHLY INCOME. THE RATE OF INTEREST ON UNPAID BALANCES SHALL NOT EXCEED THE US TREASURY RATE FOR 90 DAY SECURITIES PLUS 0.5%. HOSPITAL PATIENT FINANCIAL AID STATUTE DISCOUNTING REQUIREMENTS DISCOUNT / GROSS INCOME AS % OF FEDERAL POVERTY LEVEL 100% / UP TO 200% 80% / BETWEEN 201-250% 60% / BETWEEN 251-300% 40% / BETWEEN 301-350% 20% / BETWEEN 351-400% 0% / OVER 401% PROCESS: APPLICATIONS WILL BE ACCEPTED IMMEDIATELY BEFORE, DURING OR AFTER CARE IS PROVIDED. THE HOSPITAL WILL STRIVE TO ASSIST PATIENTS RECEIVING HIGH-COST SERVICES AS THEY OCCUR. PATIENTS MAY BE APPROVED FOR CHARITY CARE ON AN ACCOUNT-BY-ACCOUNT BASIS OR FOR A PERIOD OF TIME (FOR A COURSE OF TREATMENT). F"

THE ORGANIZATION FEELS THAT MEDICARE UNDERPAYMENTS (SHORTFALL) AND BAD DEBT ARE COMMUNITY BENEFIT AND ASSOCIATED COSTS ARE INCLUDABLE ON THE FORM 990, SCHEDULE H, PART I. AS OUTLINED MORE FULLY BELOW THE ORGANIZATION BELIEVES THAT THESE SERVICES AND RELATED COSTS PROMOTE THE HEALTH OF THE COMMUNITY AS A WHOLE AND ARE RENDERED IN CONJUNCTION WITH THE ORGANIZATION'S CHARITABLE TAX-EXEMPT PURPOSES AND MISSION IN PROVIDING MEDICALLY NECESSARY HEALTHCARE SERVICES TO ALL INDIVIDUAL'S IN A NON-DISCRIMINATORY MANNER WITHOUT REGARD TO RACE, COLOR, CREED, SEX, NATIONAL ORIGIN OR ABILITY TO PAY AND CONSISTENT WITH THE COMMUNITY BENEFIT STANDARD PROMULGATED BY THE INTERNAL REVENUE SERVICE (""IRS""). THE COMMUNITY BENEFIT STANDARD IS THE CURRENT STANDARD FOR A HOSPITAL FOR RECOGNITION AS A TAX-EXEMPT AND CHARITABLE ORGANIZATION UNDER INTERNAL REVENUE CODE (""IRC"") 501(C)(3). THE ORGANIZATION IS RECOGNIZED AS A TAX-EXEMPT ENTITY AND CHARITABLE ORGANIZATION UNDER 501(C)(3) OF THE IRC. ALTHOUGH THERE IS NO DEFINITION IN THE TAX CODE FOR THE TERM ""CHARITABLE"", A REGULATION PROMULGATED BY THE DEPARTMENT OF THE TREASURY PROVIDES SOME GUIDANCE AND STATES THAT ""[T]HE TERM CHARITABLE IS USED IN 501(C)(3) IN ITS GENERALLY ACCEPTED LEGAL SENSE,PROVIDES EXAMPLES OF CHARITABLE PURPOSES, INCLUDING THE RELIEF OF THE POOR OR UNPRIVILEGED; THE PROMOTION OF SOCIAL WELFARE; AND THE ADVANCEMENT OF EDUCATION, RELIGION, AND SCIENCE. NOTE: IT DOES NOT EXPLICITLY ADDRESS THE ACTIVITIES OF HOSPITALS. IN THE ABSENCE OF EXPLICIT STATUTORY OR REGULATORY REQUIREMENTS APPLYING THE TERM ""CHARITABLE"" TO HOSPITALS, IT HAS BEEN LEFT TO THE IRS TO DETERMINE THE CRITERIA HOSPITALS MUST MEET TO QUALIFY AS IRC 501(C)(3) CHARITABLE ORGANIZATIONS. THE ORIGINAL STANDARD WAS KNOWN AS THE CHARITY CARE STANDARD. THIS STANDARD WAS REPLACED BY THE IRS WITH THE COMMUNITY BENEFIT STANDARD WHICH IS THE CURRENT STANDARD. CHARITY CARE STANDARD IN 1956, THE IRS ISSUED REVENUE RULING 56-185, WHICH ADDRESSED THE REQUIREMENTS HOSPITALS NEEDED TO MEET IN ORDER TO QUALIFY FOR IRC 501(C)(3) STATUS. ONE OF THESE REQUIREMENTS IS KNOWN AS THE ""CHARITY CARE STANDARD."" UNDER THE STANDARD, A HOSPITAL HAD TO PROVIDE, TO THE EXTENT OF ITS FINANCIAL ABILITY, FREE OR REDUCED-COST CARE TO PATIENTS UNABLE TO PAY FOR IT. A HOSPITAL THAT EXPECTED FULL PAYMENT DID NOT, ACCORDING TO THE RULING, PROVIDE CHARITY CARE BASED ON THE FACT THAT SOME PATIENTS ULTIMATELY FAILED TO PAY. THE RULING EMPHASIZED THAT A LOW LEVEL OF CHARITY CARE DID NOT NECESSARILY MEAN THAT A HOSPITAL HAD FAILED TO MEET THE REQUIREMENT SINCE THAT LEVEL COULD REFLECT ITS FINANCIAL ABILITY TO PROVIDE SUCH CARE. THE RULING ALSO NOTED THAT PUBLICLY SUPPORTED COMMUNITY HOSPITALS WOULD NORMALLY QUALIFY AS CHARITABLE ORGANIZATIONS BECAUSE THEY SERVE THE ENTIRE COMMUNITY AND A LOW LEVEL OF CHARITY CARE WOULD NOT AFFECT A HOSPITAL'S EXEMPT STATUS IF IT WAS DUE TO THE SURROUNDING COMMUNITY'S LACK OF CHARITABLE DEMANDS. COMMUNITY BENEFIT STANDARD IN 1969, THE IRS ISSUED REVENUE RULING 69-545, WHICH ""REMOVE[D]"" FROM REVENUE RULING 56-185 ""THE REQUIREMENTS RELATING TO CARING FOR PATIENTS WITHOUT CHARGE OR AT RATES BELOW COST."" UNDER THE STANDARD DEVELOPED IN REVENUE RULING 69-545, WHICH IS KNOWN AS THE ""COMMUNITY BENEFIT STANDARD,"" HOSPITALS ARE JUDGED ON WHETHER THEY PROMOTE THE HEALTH OF A BROAD CLASS OF INDIVIDUALS IN THE COMMUNITY. THE RULING INVOLVED A HOSPITAL THAT ONLY ADMITTED INDIVIDUALS WHO COULD PAY FOR THE SERVICES (BY THEMSELVES, PRIVATE INSURANCE, OR PUBLIC PROGRAMS SUCH AS MEDICARE), BUT OPERATED A FULL-TIME EMERGENCY ROOM THAT WAS OPEN TO EVERYONE. THE IRS RULED THAT THE HOSPITAL QUALIFIED AS A CHARITABLE ORGANIZATION BECAUSE IT PROMOTED THE HEALTH OF PEOPLE IN ITS COMMUNITY. THE IRS REASONED THAT BECAUSE THE PROMOTION OF HEALTH WAS A CHARITABLE PURPOSE ACCORDING TO THE GENERAL LAW OF CHARITY, IT FELL WITHIN THE ""GENERALLY ACCEPTED LEGAL SENSE"" OF THE TERM ""CHARITABLE,"" AS REQUIRED BY TREAS. REG. 1.501(C)(3)-1(D)(2). THE IRS RULING STATED THAT THE PROMOTION OF HEALTH, LIKE THE RELIEF OF POVERTY AND THE ADVANCEMENT OF EDUCATION AND RELIGION, IS ONE OF THE PURPOSES IN THE GENERAL LAW OF CHARITY THAT IS DEEMED BENEFICIAL TO THE COMMUNITY AS A WHOLE EVEN THOUGH THE CLASS OF BENEFICIARIES ELIGIBLE TO RECEIVE A DIRECT BENEFIT FROM ITS ACTIVITIES DOES NOT INCLUDE ALL MEMBERS OF THE COMMUNITY, SUCH AS INDIGENT MEMBERS OF THE COMMUNITY, PROVIDED THAT THE CLASS IS NOT SO SMALL THAT ITS RELIEF IS NOT OF BENEFIT TO THE COMMUNITY. THE IRS CONCLUDED THAT THE HOSPITAL WAS ""PROMOTING THE HEALTH OF A CLASS OF PERSONS THAT IS BROAD ENOUGH TO BENEFIT THE COMMUNITY"" BECAUSE ITS EMERGENCY ROOM WAS OPEN TO ALL AND IT PROVIDED CARE TO EVERYONE WHO COULD PAY, WHETHER DIRECTLY OR THROUGH THIRD-PARTY REIMBURSEMENT. OTHER CHARACTERISTICS OF THE HOSPITAL THAT THE IRS HIGHLIGHTED INCLUDED THE FOLLOWING: ITS SURPLUS FUNDS WERE USED TO IMPROVE PATIENT CARE, EXPAND HOSPITAL FACILITIES, AND ADVANCE MEDICAL TRAINING, EDUCATION, AND RESEARCH; IT WAS CONTROLLED BY A BOARD OF TRUSTEES THAT CONSISTED OF INDEPENDENT CIVIC LEADERS; AND HOSPITAL MEDICAL STAFF PRIVILEGES WERE AVAILABLE TO ALL QUALIFIED PHYSICIANS. THE AMERICAN HOSPITAL ASSOCIATION (""AHA"") FEELS THAT MEDICARE UNDERPAYMENTS (SHORTFALL) AND BAD DEBT ARE COMMUNITY BENEFIT AND THUS INCLUDABLE ON THE FORM 990, SCHEDULE H, PART I. THIS ORGANIZATION AGREES WITH THE AHA POSITION. AS OUTLINED IN THE AHA LETTER TO THE IRS DATED AUGUST 21, 2007 WITH RESPECT TO THE FIRST PUBLISHED DRAFT OF THE NEW FORM 990 AND SCHEDULE H, THE AHA FELT THAT THE IRS SHOULD INCORPORATE THE FULL VALUE OF THE COMMUNITY BENEFIT THAT HOSPITALS PROVIDE BY COUNTING MEDICARE UNDERPAYMENTS (SHORTFALL) AND BAD DEBT AS QUANTIFIABLE COMMUNITY BENEFIT FOR THE FOLLOWING REASONS: - PROVIDING CARE FOR THE ELDERLY AND SERVING MEDICARE PATIENTS IS AN ESSENTIAL PART OF THE COMMUNITY BENEFIT STANDARD. - MEDICARE, LIKE MEDICAID, DOES NOT PAY THE FULL COST OF CARE. RECENTLY, MEDICARE REIMBURSES HOSPITALS ONLY 92 CENTS FOR EVERY DOLLAR THEY SPEND TO TAKE CARE OF MEDICARE PATIENTS. THE MEDICARE PAYMENT ADVISORY COMMISSION (""MEDPAC"") IN ITS MARCH 2007 REPORT TO CONGRESS CAUTIONED THAT UNDERPAYMENT WILL GET EVEN WORSE, WITH MARGINS REACHING A 10-YEAR LOW AT NEGATIVE 5.4 PERCENT. - MANY MEDICARE BENEFICIARIES, LIKE THEIR MEDICAID COUNTERPARTS, ARE POOR. MORE THAN 46 PERCENT OF MEDICARE SPENDING IS FOR BENEFICIARIES WHOSE INCOME IS BELOW 200 PERCENT OF THE FEDERAL POVERTY LEVEL. MANY OF THOSE MEDICARE BENEFICIARIES ARE ALSO ELIGIBLE FOR MEDICAID -- SO CALLED ELIGIBLES."" THERE IS EVERY COMPELLING PUBLIC POLICY REASON TO TREAT MEDICARE AND MEDICAID UNDERPAYMENTS SIMILARLY FOR PURPOSES OF A HOSPITAL'S COMMUNITY BENEFIT AND INCLUDE THESE COSTS ON FORM 990, SCHEDULE H, PART I. MEDICARE UNDERPAYMENT MUST BE SHOULDERED BY THE HOSPITAL IN ORDER TO CONTINUE TREATING THE COMMUNITY'S ELDERLY AND POOR. THESE UNDERPAYMENTS REPRESENT A REAL COST OF SERVING THE COMMUNITY AND SHOULD COUNT AS A QUANTIFIABLE COMMUNITY BENEFIT. BOTH THE AHA AND THIS ORGANIZATION ALSO FEEL THAT PATIENT BAD DEBT IS A COMMUNITY BENEFIT AND THUS INCLUDABLE ON THE FORM 990, SCHEDULE H, PART I. THERE ARE COMPELLING REASONS THAT PATIENT BAD DEBT SHOULD BE COUNTED AS QUANTIFIABLE COMMUNITY BENEFIT AS FOLLOWS: - A SIGNIFICANT MAJORITY OF BAD DEBT IS ATTRIBUTABLE TO LOW-INCOME PATIENTS, WHO, FOR MANY REASONS, DECLINE TO COMPLETE THE FORMS REQUIRED TO ESTABLISH ELIGIBILITY FOR HOSPITALS' CHARITY CARE OR FINANCIAL ASSISTANCE PROGRAMS. A 2006 CONGRESSIONAL BUDGET OFFICE (""CBO"") REPORT, NONPROFIT HOSPITALS AND THE PROVISION OF COMMUNITY BENEFITS, CITED TWO STUDIES INDICATING THAT ""THE GREAT MAJORITY OF BAD DEBT WAS ATTRIBUTABLE TO PATIENTS WITH INCOMES BELOW 200% OF THE FEDERAL POVERTY LINE."" - THE REPORT ALSO NOTED THAT A SUBSTANTIAL PORTION OF BAD DEBT IS PENDING CHARITY CARE. UNLIKE BAD DEBT IN OTHER INDUSTRIES, HOSPITAL BAD DEBT IS COMPLICATED BY THE FACT THAT HOSPITALS FOLLOW THEIR MISSION TO THE COMMUNITY AND TREAT EVERY PATIENT THAT COMES THROUGH THEIR EMERGENCY DEPARTMENT, REGARDLESS OF ABILITY TO PAY. PATIENTS WHO HAVE OUTSTANDING BILLS ARE NOT TURNED AWAY, UNLIKE OTHER INDUSTRIES. BAD DEBT IS FURTHER COMPLICATED BY THE AUDITING INDUSTRY'S STANDARDS ON REPORTING CHARITY CARE. MANY PATIENTS CANNOT OR DO NOT PROVIDE THE NECESSARY, EXTENSIVE DOCUMENTATION REQUIRED TO BE DEEMED CHARITY CARE BY AUDITORS. AS A RESULT, ROUGHLY 10% OF BAD DEBT IS PENDING CHARITY CARE. - THE CBO CONCLUDED THAT ITS FINDINGS ""SUPPORT THE VALIDITY OF THE USE OF UNCOMPENSATED CARE [BAD DEBT AND CHARITY CARE] AS A MEASURE OF COMMUNITY BENEFITS"" ASSUMING THE FINDINGS ARE GENERALIZABLE NATIONWIDE; THE EXPERIENCE OF HOSPITALS AROUND THE NATION REINFORCES THAT THEY ARE GENERALIZABLE. AS OUTLINED BY THE AHA, DESPITE THE HOSPITAL'S BEST EFFORTS AND DUE DILIGENCE, PATIENT BAD DEBT IS A PART OF THE HOSPITAL'S MISSION AND CHARITABLE PURPOSES. BAD DEBT REPRESENTS"

PART III, LINES 2 AND 4 NET PATIENT ACCOUNTS RECEIVABLE AND NET PATIENT SERVICE REVENUE LESS THE PROVISION FOR BAD DEBTS ARE RECORDED AT ESTIMATED AMOUNTS EXPECTED TO BE COLLECTED. THESE ESTIMATED AMOUNTS ARE SUBJECT TO FURTHER ADJUSTMENTS UPON REVIEW BY THIRD-PARTY PAYORS. THE PROVISION FOR BAD DEBTS IS BASED UPON MANAGEMENT'S ASSESSMENT OF HISTORICAL AND EXPECTED NET COLLECTIONS CONSIDERING CURRENT BUSINESS AND ECONOMIC CONDITIONS, TRENDS IN HEALTH CARE COVERAGE AND OTHER COLLECTION INDICATORS. PERIODICALLY THROUGHOUT THE YEAR, MANAGEMENT ASSESSES THE ADEQUACY OF THE ALLOWANCE FOR UNCOLLECTIBLE ACCOUNTS BASED UPON HISTORICAL WRITE-OFF EXPERIENCE OF SELF-PAY ACCOUNTS RECEIVABLE INCLUDING THOSE BALANCES AFTER INSURANCE PAYMENTS AND NOT COVERED BY INSURANCE. THE RESULTS OF THIS REVIEW ARE THEN USED TO MAKE ANY MODIFICATIONS TO THE PROVISION FOR BAD DEBTS TO ESTABLISH AN APPROPRIATE ALLOWANCE FOR UNCOLLECTIBLE ACCOUNTS. THE ESTIMATED AMOUNT FOR THE HOSPITAL'S BAD DEBT EXPENSE (AT COST) ATTRIBUTABLE TO PATIENTS ELIGIBLE UNDER TCH'S CHARITY CARE POLICY REPORTED ON PART III, LINE 3 WAS DETERMINED USING MANAGEMENT'S BEST ESTIMATE BASED ON AVAILABLE PATIENT DATA.

Part III, section B In addition to hospital-based revenue and allowable cost generated from Medicare (including DSH and IME) eligible participants reported in Part III Section B, The Christ Hospital provides hospital-based services to other Medicare eligible participants, through Medicare plans sponsored by managed care providers (Medicare Managed Care Plans). Medicare Managed Care Plans are Health Maintenance Organizations (HMOs) or Preferred Provider Organizations (PPOs) that provide basic Medicare coverage plus other coverages to fill gaps in Medicare coverage. These plans have arrangements with certain physicians, hospitals and health care providers to serve patients who are plan members at a contracted rate. Below is the shortfall related to hospital-based revenue and allowable costs under Medicare Managed Care Plans: Revenue received from Medicare Managed Care Plans $101,344,000 Allowable cost of care related to payments from above $131,212,000 ------------ Shortfall from Medicare Managed Care Plans $(29,868,000) Also, The Christ Hospital has certain Medicare Part B (physician-based) revenue and allowable cost related to services rendered on behalf of Medicare eligible participants by employed physicians of The Christ Hospital. This would include services provided under traditional Medicare, as well as Medicare Managed Care Plans.

TO DO SO WE CONSIDERED A NUMBER OF RELEVANT FACTS AND CIRCUMSTANCES, INCLUDING THE GEOGRAPHIC AREA WE SERVE, THE TARGET POPULATIONS WE SERVE, AND OUR PRINCIPAL FUNCTIONS AS A HOSPITAL, WHICH INCLUDE OUR SERVICE LINES. IN DEFINING THE COMMUNITY WE SERVE, WE SPECIFICALLY INCLUDED THE MEDICALLY UNDERSERVED, LOW INCOME AND THE MINORITY POPULATIONS WHO LIVE IN THE GEOGRAPHIC AREA FROM WHICH WE DRAW PATIENTS. IN ADDITION, WE INCLUDED ALL PATIENTS WITHOUT REGARD TO WHETHER (OR HOW MUCH) THEY OR THEIR INSURERS PAY FOR CARE RECEIVED OR WHETHER THEY ARE ELIGIBLE FOR ASSISTANCE UNDER OUR FINANCIAL ASSISTANCE POLICY. WE ASSESSED THE HEALTH NEEDS OF THE COMMUNITY IN COLLABORATION WITH OTHER NONPROFIT HOSPITALS WHOSE COMMUNITIES OVERLAPPED WITH OURS AND THE HEALTH COLLABORATIVE. THE HEALTH COLLABORATIVE IS A NONPROFIT ORGANIZATION SERVING THE GREATER CINCINNATI AREA. IT WORKS WITH ITS MEMBER HOSPITALS ON HEALTH CARE IMPROVEMENT PROJECTS AND SHARES BEST PRACTICES. THE HEALTH COLLABORATIVE BROUGHT 20 HOSPITALS TOGETHER, INCLUDING THE CHRIST HOSPITAL, TO CONDUCT A COMPREHENSIVE, COLLABORATIVE COMMUNITY HEALTH NEEDS ASSESSMENT (COLLABORATIVE CHNA). THE COLLABORATIVE CHNA ALSO PROVIDES A DETAILED DESCRIPTION OF (1) HOW THE COLLABORATIVE CHNA TEAM SOLICITED AND TOOK INTO ACCOUNT INPUT RECEIVED FROM PERSONS WHO REPRESENT THE BROAD INTERESTS OF THE COMMUNITY, INCLUDING THOSE WITH SPECIAL KNOWLEDGE OF, OR EXPERTISE IN, PUBLIC HEALTH, (2) HOW AND OVER WHAT PERIOD OF TIME SUCH INPUT WAS PROVIDED, (3) THE NAMES OF ORGANIZATIONS PROVIDING INPUT AND THE NATURE AND EXTENT OF THE ORGANIZATIONS INPUT, (4) DESCRIPTIONS OF THE MEDICALLY UNDERSERVED, LOW INCOME OR MINORITY POPULATIONS BEING REPRESENTED BY ORGANIZATIONS OR INDIVIDUALS THAT PROVIDED INPUT. IN ADDITION, THE CHRIST HOSPITAL REVIEWED ANY WRITTEN COMMENTS RECEIVED REGARDING THE 2013 COMMUNITY HEALTH NEEDS ASSESSMENT AND IMPLEMENTATION STRATEGY. TO DATE, TO THE BEST OF OUR KNOWLEDGE, NO WRITTEN COMMENTS HAVE BEEN RECEIVED AND, THUS, WRITTEN COMMENTS WERE NOT AVAILABLE FOR CONSIDERATION IN THIS ASSESSMENT. FOR EASE OF REFERENCE, THE FOLLOWING PROVIDES AN EXECUTIVE OVERVIEW OF SOME OF THE PROCESSES, METHODS AND DATA INPUT COLLECTION AND ANALYSIS USED TO CONDUCT THE COLLABORATIVE CHNA. REPRESENTATIVES FROM 11 HEALTHCARE SYSTEMS (REPRESENTING 20 HOSPITALS), INCLUDING THE CHRIST HOSPITAL) MET FIVE TIMES AND COMPRISED THE COLLABORATIVE CHNA COMMITTEE. THIS GROUP ASSISTED IN PROCESS DESIGN, PROVIDED FEEDBACK TO THE CONSULTANT AND THE HEALTH COLLABORATIVE AND SHARED BEST PRACTICES WITH EACH OTHER. THE COLLABORATIVE CHNA COMMITTEE ALSO INCLUDED REPRESENTATIVES FROM THE CINCINNATI HEALTH DEPARTMENT, HAMILTON COUNTY PUBLIC HEALTH, INTERACT FOR HEALTH (A REGIONAL PHILANTHROPIC ORGANIZATION) AND A PHYSICIAN/PROFESSOR FROM XAVIER UNIVERSITY. CONSISTENT SOURCES OF COMPARABLE DATA WERE AVAILABLE ONLY AT THE STATE AND COUNTY LEVELS, AND THEREFORE EACH PARTICIPATING HOSPITAL IDENTIFIED WHICH COUNTIES CONTAINED THEIR SERVICES AREAS. SERVICE AREAS SPANNED 19 COUNTIES OVER THREE STATES. THE CINCINNATI-MIDDLETOWN METROPOLITAN STATISTICAL AREA INCLUDES AN ADDITIONAL FOUR COUNTIES (BRACKEN, GALLATIN, GRANT, AND PENDLETON), AND SO THE COLLABORATIVE CHNA ASSESSED THE NEEDS OF CITIZENS FOR 23 COUNTIES IN TOTAL. RESULTS IN THE COLLABORATIVE CHNA INCLUDE DATA FROM A STRUCTURED SURVEY, QUALITATIVE DATA FROM MULTIPLE FOCUS GROUPS, AN ANALYSIS OF AVAILABLE SECONDARY DATA AND FINDINGS FROM HEALTH DEPARTMENT INTERVIEWS AND SURVEYS. THE CHNA TEAM COLLECTED 106 MEASURES FROM PUBLICLY AVAILABLE SOURCES, STARTING WITH THE COUNTY HEALTH RANKINGS. CRITERIA FOR INCLUSION INCLUDED AVAILABILITY OF TREND DATA AT THE COUNTY LEVEL AND EASE OF COMPARISON AND UPDATING. PRIMARY DATA COLLECTION INVOLVED INTERVIEWS OF PUBLIC HEALTH OFFICIALS; ONLINE AND PAPER SURVEYS; AND COMMUNITY FOCUS GROUPS. THERE WERE FOUR DISTINCT STAKEHOLDER GROUPS WITH SEPARATE ANALYSIS FOR COMPARISON: (1) CONSUMERS AND ORGANIZATIONS WHICH ATTENDED MEETINGS, (2) INDIVIDUALS SURVEYED, (3) ORGANIZATIONS SURVEYED AND (4) HEALTH DEPARTMENTS (COLLECTIVELY, STAKEHOLDERS). ALL RESPONDENTS ANSWERED QUESTIONS ABOUT SERIOUS HEALTH ISSUES, ISSUES HANDLED WELL, ISSUES NOT ADDRESSED ENOUGH, AND BARRIERS TO CARE. HOSPITALS INVITED NONPROFIT AGENCIES AND ORGANIZATIONS SERVING THE MEDICALLY UNDERSERVED, LOW-INCOME, AND MINORITY POPULATIONS TO ATTEND MEETINGS AND COMPLETE SURVEYS.

BECAUSE LOCAL ACTION IS ESSENTIAL TO PUBLIC HEALTH PROGRESS, UMSRH IS A KEY STAKEHOLDER IN THE MID-SHORE HEALTH IMPROVEMENT COALITION, A PARTNERSHIP OF PUBLIC SECTOR AGENCIES, HEALTH CARE PROVIDERS AND COMMUNITY-BASED PARTNERS. THE COALITION WAS FORMED IN DECEMBER 2011 IN RESPONSE TO A SHIP. IN ADDITION TO PROVIDING THE COALITION WITH LEADERSHIP, A VARIETY OF CLINICAL AND NON-CLINICAL UMSRH ASSOCIATES SERVE ON VARIOUS COALITION WORKGROUPS. THE WORK OF THE COALITION BEGAN BY REVIEWING AND PRIORITIZING OBJECTIVES IDENTIFIED BY THE MARYLAND DEPARTMENT OF HEALTH AND MENTAL HYGIENE'S (DHMH) SHIP. SHIP, LAUNCHED IN SEPTEMBER 2011, FOCUSES ON IMPROVING THE HEALTH OF MARYLAND RESIDENTS IN SIX VISION AREAS: HEALTHY BABIES, HEALTHY SOCIAL ENVIRONMENTS, SAFE PHYSICAL ENVIRONMENTS, INFECTIOUS DISEASE, CHRONIC DISEASE AND HEALTH CARE ACCESS. UNDER SHIP'S UMBRELLA, THE COALITION DEVELOPS AND IMPLEMENTS STRATEGIES THAT WILL IMPROVE LOCAL PUBLIC HEALTH. THE COALITION DECIDED TO FOCUS ON THREE HEALTH PRIORITIES: (1) ADOLESCENT OBESITY, (2) ADOLESCENT TOBACCO USE, AND (3) DIABETES RELATED EMERGENCY DEPARTMENT VISITS.

UMSRH'S SERVICE AREA IS DEFINED AS THE MARYLAND COUNTIES OF CAROLINE, DORCHESTER, TALBOT, QUEEN ANNE'S AND KENT. UMC AT EASTON IS SITUATED AT THE CENTER OF THE MID-SHORE AREA AND THUS SERVES A LARGE RURAL GEOGRAPHICAL AREA (ALL 5 COUNTIES OF THE MID-SHORE). UMC AT DORCHESTER IS LOCATED APPROXIMATELY 18 MILES FROM EASTON AND PRIMARILY SERVES DORCHESTER COUNTY AND PORTIONS OF CAROLINE COUNTY. UMC AT CHESTERTOWN LOCATED IN CHESTERTOWN, IN KENT COUNTY MERGED WITH SHORE REGIONAL HEALTH IN JULY 2013. UMC AT CHESTERTOWN SERVES THE RESIDENTS OF KENT COUNTY, PORTIONS OF QUEEN ANNE'S AND CAROLINE COUNTIES AND THE SURROUNDING AREAS. THE FIVE COUNTIES OF THE MID-SHORE COMPRISE 20% OF THE LANDMASS OF THE STATE OF MARYLAND AND 2% OF THE POPULATION. THE ENTIRE REGION HAS OVER 4,400 EMPLOYERS WITH NEARLY 45,000 WORKERS. ONLY 50 OF THOSE EMPLOYERS EMPLOY 100 OR MORE WORKERS. THE ECONOMIC CONDITION VARIES SIGNIFICANTLY THROUGHOUT THE REGION, ESPECIALLY FOR CAROLINE, DORCHESTER, AND KENT COUNTIES. IT SHOULD BE NOTED THAT TALBOT COUNTY APPEARS TO HAVE A SIGNIFICANTLY HIGHER MEDIAN INCOME THAN CAROLINE AND DORCHESTER, HOWEVER, A LARGE PERCENTAGE OF THE POPULATION HAS INCOMES IN LINE WITH THOSE OF CAROLINE AND DORCHESTER. THE FIGURES FOR TALBOT ARE SOMEWHAT SKEWED DUE TO LARGE INCOMES OF A FEW INDIVIDUAL FAMILIES AND HIGH NET WORTH INDIVIDUALS. UMSRH'S SERVICE AREA HAS A HIGHER PERCENTAGE OF POPULATION AGED 65 AND OLDER AS COMPARED TO MARYLAND OVERALL. TALBOT COUNTY HAS A 27.2% RATE FOR THIS AGE GROUP AND KENT COUNTY HAS 25.3% OF ITS RESIDENTS AGE 65 YEARS OR OLDER. THESE RATES ARE 65% HIGHER THAN MARYLAND'S PERCENTAGE, AND HIGHER THAN OTHER RURAL AREAS IN THE STATE BY ALMOST A QUARTER. TODAY, MORE THAN TWO-THIRDS OF ALL HEALTH CARE COSTS ARE FOR TREATING CHRONIC ILLNESSES. AMONG HEALTH CARE COSTS FOR OLDER AMERICANS, 95% ARE FOR CHRONIC DISEASES. THE COST OF PROVIDING HEALTH CARE FOR ONE PERSON AGED 65 OR OLDER IS THREE TO FIVE TIMES HIGHER THAN THE COST FOR SOMEONE YOUNGER THAN 65.

A 33 member Advisory Task Force (ATF) led the MHH CHNA process. The ATF included a diverse group of individuals, including hospital leaders, grassroots activists, community residents, faith-based leaders, hospital representatives, public health leaders and other stakeholder organizations, such as representatives from local health departments. The ATF reviewed national, state, and local health and disparity data, public health priorities and community health improvement plans as well as county-level ZIP code and neighborhood level data (when available). Based on their findings, ATF members designed a CHNA survey tool consisting of open and closed-ended questions about healthcare access, health equity, health condition concerns, social determinants and community strengths and assets. Community members responded to the survey by attending a community input session or completing it online or via hardcopy. Based on the ATF's recommendation, the hospital identified Southern Baltimore City and Northern Anne Arundel County as its Community Benefit Service Area (CBSA), which includes all residents living in ZIP code 21225. The hospital selected this geographic area based on hospital utilization data and secondary public health data as well as its high poverty rate and proximity to the hospital. The ATF used population-level data, community health needs survey findings and feedback from community input sessions to create recommendations for the hospital's health priorities, potential implementation strategies, and to identify key partners. Based on the ATF's recommendation, the hospital health priorities for the CBSA include health and wellness (chronic disease prevention and management, behavioral health), access to care and services (mental health, linkage to resources and services, transportation) and social determinants of health (employment, food access and insecurity, housing). The hospital's FY18 CHNA and three-year Implementation Strategies were endorsed by MHH Board of Directors and approved by the MedStar Health Board of Directors. The document became available on the hospital's website on June 30, 2018. As a proud member of MedStar Health, representatives from MHH routinely participate in the MedStar Health community benefit workgroup. The workgroup is comprised of community health professionals who represent all ten MedStar hospitals. The team analyzes local and regional community health data, establishes system-wide community health programming performance and evaluation measures and shares best practices."

MedStar Health and its healthcare facilities will: * Treat all patients equitably, with dignity, respect, and compassion. * Serve the emergency health care needs of everyone who presents to our facilities regardless of a patient's ability to pay for care. * Assist those patients who are admitted through our admission process for non-urgent, medically necessary care who cannot pay for the care they receive. * Balance needed financial assistance for some patients with broader fiscal responsibilities in order to keep its hospitals' doors open for all who may need care in the community. In meeting its commitments, MedStar Healths facilities will work with their uninsured patients seeking emergency and medically necessary care to gain an understanding of each patients financial resources. Based on this information and eligibility determination, MedStar Health facilities will provide financial assistance to uninsured patients who reside within the communities we serve in one or more of the following ways: * Assist with enrollment in publicly-funded entitlement programs (e.g., Medicaid). * Refer patients to State or Federal Insurance Exchange Navigator resources. * Assist with consideration of funding that may be available from other charitable organizations. * Provide financial assistance according to applicable policy guidelines. * Provide financial assistance for payment of facility charges using a sliding-scale based on the patients household income and financial resources. * Offer periodic payment plans to assist patients with financing their healthcare services. Each facility publicizes the MedStar Financial Assistance Policy by: * Providing access to the MedStar Financial Assistance Policy, Financial Assistance Applications, and MedStar Patient Information Sheet on all hospital websites and patient portals. * Providing hard copies of the MedStar Financial Assistance Policy, MedStar Uniform Financial Assistance Application, and MedStar Patient Information Sheet to patients upon request. * Providing notification and information about the MedStar Financial Assistance Policy by offering copies as part of all registration or discharges processes, and answering questions on how to apply for assistance. * Providing written notices on billing statements. * Displaying MedStar Financial Assistance Policy information at all hospital registration points. * Translating the MedStar Financial Assistance Policy, MedStar Uniform Financial Assistance Application, and the Medstar Patient Information Sheet into primary languages of all significant populations with Limited English Proficiency. MedStar Health provides a financial assistance probable and likely eligibility determination to the patient within two business days from receipt of the initial financial assistance application. Final eligibility determinations are made and communicated to the patient based on receipt and review of a completed application. MedStar Health believes that its patients have personal responsibilities related to the financial aspects of their healthcare needs. Financial assistance and periodic payment plans available under this policy will not be available to those patients who fail to fulfill their responsibilities. For purposes of this policy, patient responsibilities include: * Complying with providing the necessary financial disclosure forms to evaluate their eligibility for publicly-funded healthcare programs, charity care programs, and other forms of financial assistance (these disclosure forms must be completed accurately, truthfully, and timely to allow MedStar Healths facilities to properly counsel patients concerning the availability of financial assistance). * Working with the facilitys Patient Advocates and Patient Financial Services staff to ensure there is a complete understanding of the patients financial situation and constraints. * Making applicable payments for services in a timely fashion, including any payments made pursuant to deferred and periodic payment schedules. * Providing updated financial information to the facilitys Patient Advocates or Customer Service Representatives on a timely basis as the patients financial circumstances may change. * It is the responsibility of the patient to inform the MedStar hospital of their existing eligibility under a medical hardship during the 12-month period. * In the event a patient fails to meet these responsibilities, MedStar reserves the right to pursue additional billing and collection efforts. In the event of non-payment billing, and collection efforts are defined in the MedStar Billing and Collection Policy. A free copy is available on all hospital websites and patient portals or by calling customer service at 1-800-280-9006. Uninsured patients of MedStar Healths facilities may be eligible for full financial assistance or partial sliding-scale financial assistance under this policy. The Patient Advocate and Patient Financial Services staff will determine eligibility for full financial assistance and partial sliding-scale financial assistance based on review of income for the patient and their family (household), other financial resources available to the patients family, family size, and the extent of the medical costs to be incurred by the patient."
201941309349304264,520491660,COMMUNITY INFORMATION,"PART VI, LINE 4 GEOGRAPHIC: MedStar Harbor Hospital's community benefit service area (CBSA) includes all residents of the hospital's zip code, 21225. This area covers Southern Baltimore City and Northern Anne Arundel County, and includes four neighborhoods: Brooklyn, Brooklyn Park, Cherry Hill, and Pumphrey. The geographic areas was selected based on hospital utilization data by zip code, as well as secondary public health data as well as it high poverty rate and proximity to the hospital. Demographics: Cherry Hill is historically a Black/African American neighborhood, with roots going back to the 17th century. After World War II, more than 600 housing units were built there by the United States War Housing Administration, specifically for African American war workers. Shortly after the war, these units were made into low-income housing. Additional low-income housing units have been added throughout the years, making Cherry Hill one of the largest housing projects east of Chicago. 90.3% of Cherry Hill residents are Black/African American. 60.3% of Cherry Hill residents age 25 years and older have a high school education or less. The median household income for Cherry Hill in is $22,659, compared to $37,992 for the entire CBSA and approximately 57.2% of Cherry Hill families live in poverty. In terms of health care, the Cherry Hill community houses MHH, as well as a local branch of the Family Health Centers of Baltimore, which is a Federally Qualified Health Center (FQHC) providing health care services on a sliding fee scale. In addition, Baltimore City Health Department programs operate city-wide, and various mobile services - such as a needle exchange program, violence prevention, maternal and infant nursing, lead poisoning and abatement programs and others - in the Cherry Hill area According to the Cherry Hill Health Profile, the life expectancy at birth of a Cherry Hill resident is 69.5, compared to 73.6 in Baltimore City. The all cause mortality rate In Cherry Hill is 124.6; the all cause mortality rate in Baltimore City is 99.5. High rates of type 2 diabetes and heart disease, including stroke, occur in this community. For a variety of reasons, including the high poverty rate and low rate of health care insurance coverage, many Cherry Hill residents often use the MedStar Harbor Hospital emergency department for primary care services. A steady decrease is anticipated in this area over the next few fiscal years as patients become insured through the Affordable Care Act. Despite the convenient neighborhood location of a FQHC, many residents do not utilize a primary care physician. Typically, a chronic condition, such as diabetes or heart disease, presents severe enough symptoms to warrant a trip to the emergency department. In many cases, several co-morbidities are found to be present at this time. Without primary care follow-up, however, these conditions usually cannot be addressed fully in the time allotted for the emergent issue. In other cases, patients may have symptoms of a much less serious illness - a simple cold, for example - but, since they do not have a primary health care provider, they also visit the emergency department for these ailments. As a result, many of their most basic health needs often are not met."

This pilot follows HUD definitions and guidelines and provides both bridge and permanent, supportive housing to individuals in need. Rush has invested $55,000 in this programEconomic DevelopmentIn FY18, Rush made strategic investments worth $2.08M in social impact projects through Community Development Financial Institutions (CDFIs) - Chicago Community Loan Fund (CCLF) and IFF - with the long term goal to impact the social determinants of health. As part of these ventures Rush invested $1.08M in Chicago Neighborhood Rebuild Pilot Program and People's Community Development Association of Chicago (PCDAC). The Rebuild Pilot Program was announced by the City of Chicago and aims at acquiring and rehabilitating vacant homes in Chicago neighborhoods that need investment and jobs. The goal of the program is to create opportunities for local businesses and at-risk youth while supporting affordable ownership and community stability. The PCDAC investment involved acquiring land adjacent to Harvest Homes located in the East Garfield Park neighborhood for future development. We invested another $1M in The Hatchery Project which is a local incubator for food and beverage related businesses in East Garfield Park.Rush is also committed to buying and sourcing locally. For example, Rush intentionally does business with vendors in our West Side communities and creates business incubation opportunities for vendors. Rush launched the Business of the Week and Shop the West Side initiatives in FY18-bringing these local businesses onto the Rush campus. Some of the vendors included Arise Creations, Accessorize Me, Against the Grain Designs (watches and glasses), At Her Leisure (travel accessories and wearable art), and the Chicago Lighthouse Industries (planners, calendars, banners, ergonomic footrests, monitor arms, and cooking thermometers). Rush has also worked with new West Side vendors for services such as IPromo - Promotional Items and SS Media 7 - Awards Services Vendor, Catering Out of the Box and Inspiration Kitchens. Environmental Improvements Rush understands that in its commitment to improving health, it must also be aware of its environmental footprint. As a result, Rush developed The Green Team at Rush University Medical Center and continued to support The Green Team at Rush Oak Park Hospital. Each of the green teams have adopted a mission to improve the social and physical wellbeing of the patients, students, employees and community we serve through a culture of environmental sustainability. Institute a task force to focus on inbound and outbound environmentally friendly programs through: Energy and water conservation; Reduction of our carbon footprint; Recycling program and waste reduction; Local & sustainable food; Establishing sourcing relationships with environmentally conscious vendors. Rush has also engaged Practice Green Health, which is an advisory service to attain green culture. In early 2018 Rush became the first academic health system in the region to adopt a comprehensive clean air policy. This policy includes guidelines for all new construction on the downtown and Oak Park campuses that will adopt the cleanest diesel policies for our air quality and also developed guidelines to limit all unnecessary idling on.

They are committed to increasing the vitality of Rush's region and reducing disparity between neighborhoods by working across the three pillars of a vibrant, inclusive economy: growth, prosperity, and inclusion. Their vision in Economic Vitality is to grow an economy that works for everyone while reducing inequities between communities.West Side ConnectEDRush is a founding member of West Side ConnectED, a collaborative of 4 West Side hospitals working to improve our efforts on social determinants of health with support from Catholic Charities. The group is particularly focused on implementing screening about primary care/insurance, food security, housing, utilities, and transportation in the Emergency Departments. In FY18 Rush dedicated staff time equivalent of $5,500. The coalition also secured funding from the Illinois Health and Hospital Association (IHA) and WSU to secure a project manager and screening connections with the Patient Innovation Center.Community Health Improvement AdvocacyIn FY18, Rush supported the Alliance for Health Equity in its Tobacco 21 campaign for the State of Illinois. Workforce DevelopmentRush's Employment Preference Initiative focuses on hiring individuals from our West Side communities into frontline positions within the organization. We have partnered with non-profit organizations including Skills for Chicagoland's Future and the Cara Program that refer qualified candidates and provide wrap around support services. We hired 15 individuals in FY18 through the Employment Preference Initiative and 16% of all of our new hires were from our West Side communities. We are also dedicated to utilizing local labor for Capital Projects such as Rush's South Loop Clinic where we had 7.7% of construction hours worked by West Side residents in FY18. Finally, the newly launched Talent Development Initiative includes creating targeted career pathway programs for incumbent employees to help them advance in their careers. In FY18 we dedicated resources to organizing and planning the launch of two programs, the Medical Assistant Pathway Program and the Patient Care Technician Program.Rush Oak Park Hospital also supports career development of students with special needs in partnership with Oak Park River Forest High School. ROPH employs students throughout the hospital as a job development program.Employee Volunteer Program (EVP)EVP is a program to support volunteer activities that enhance and serve the communities where Rush system employee's work and live. Rush has made a commitment to working closely with our West Side of Chicago and Western Suburb communities to address social conditions that contribute to poor health outcomes for residents. Rush specifically seeks to address issues that improve health, well-being and quality of life for our neighbors, and to provide volunteer opportunities that enrich and inspire our employees. During the pilot phase of this program, there were a total of 631 volunteer hours spent in the community and planning this initiative."

This reduces the bad debt expense of $38,908,257 to cost of $12,594,529. Due to the process that Rush and other hospitals must facilitate to prove a patient's eligibility for discounted or free care, the precise amount of charity care often can be indistinguishable from other categories of uncompensated care. Without the cooperation of the patient in providing appropriate documentation, Rush cannot correctly distinguish patients who meet the defined charity care policies and appropriately categorize those individuals as charity care write-offs. Instead these patient cases can be classified as bad debt write-offs due to a lack of support information. This can create a situation in which patient scan be mistakenly classified as bad debt that could actually be classified as charity care, but cannot be confirmed. As a matter of policy, this wouldn't happen, but can on occasion."

There is language in all billing statements that financial assistance is available and a plain language summary is provided on all statements prior to placing accounts with bad debt collection agency. In addition our collection agencies will attempt to notify patients of Rush's financial assistance policy before placing accounts with the credit bureau. The policy also has provisions for engaging in extraordinary collection activities. The collection agencies on behalf of Rush will issue a written notice that (i) describes the specific collection activities it intends to initiate (ii) provides a deadline after which such action(s) will be initiated (or resumed). Rush will also make a reasonable effort to orally notify the patient about the financial assistance policy and how he or she can get help with the financial assistance application process. Rush may initiate collection activities no sooner than 30 days from the date on which it issues the ECA Initiation Notice, either by mail or electronic mail."
201941359349306924,362174823,"Part VI, Line 2:","As an academic health system, Rush assessed the health needs of the communities which it serves in a very collaborative approach and continues to do so beyond the Community Health Needs Assessment (CHNA) process. Chicago, like any large urban city, surveys the health services it provides to its citizens. The Chicago Department of Public Health (CDPH) established a strategic planning process aimed to focus the energies of the department into a plan, Healthy Chicago 2.0, which set organizational priorities and guides the allocation of public health resources. Rush worked to align around these areas of improvement.In addition to the work completed in our 2016 Community Health Needs Assessment, Rush has been continuously surveying our communities, stakeholders, and individuals about health needs and our efforts to help create West Side United with our partners at UI Health, Cook County Health, and Presence Health/AMITA. As a follow up to the CHNA, Rush conducted a ""What We Heard Tour"", which involved surveying eight neighborhoods (added Humboldt Park to west side effort), 480 participants, and 21 formal community listening sessions at partner organizations. These organizations included:BUILDCoalition of HopeEl ValorEnlaceEvery Block a VillageGarfield Park Community CouncilGreater Galilee Baptist ChurchKedvale New Mt. Zion M.B.

Rush is actively bringing its message across the West Side organizations and working to learn about what health needs might exist and receive feedback on programmatic decisions. Rush has also ensured that community partners are involved in all of our respective Community Health Implementation Plan workgroups."

The maintenance of this service for our patients has a significant impact on decreasing the amount of charity care provided and ensuring that patients have the opportunity to obtain insurance. In addition to achieving appropriate, available coverage for our patients' medical services, this eligibility service also obtains eligibility for SSI or SSA benefits for applicable patients. Guiding the patient through this often time-consuming and arduous process is extremely beneficial to the patient, as once SSI/SSA eligibility is approved, the patient will begin receiving a monthly assistance check which provided a benefit well beyond their health care at RUMC.To assist the patient in deciding which is the right program for them, RUMC offers the services of Financial Counselors and Billing Customer Service Representatives. These individuals will assist patients in completion of financial application forms, obtaining an estimated cost of anticipated hospital services, providing an explanation and copy of their hospital bill, and notary services. RUMC makes all financial assistance information and policies available on the hospital's website."
201941359349306924,362174823,"Part VI, Line 4:","Rush provides patient care services to a much broader audience than is defined in its Community Health Needs Assessment (CHNA), but Rush defines its respective community as the West Side of Chicago and near city suburbs of Oak Park, Forest Park, and River Forest. Rush purposely chose to define its community for the CHNA as the geographic area between the two hospitals because this is an area of great need and some hardship and we are in their backyard. Rush's patient population is varied in regard to ethnicity, economic status and insurance status, but many on the west side face hardship and are members of more vulnerable populations - racial/ethnic minorities, lower socio-economic status, crowded housing, higher levels of joblessness and less access to education, transportation, and other community resources such as grocery stores and healthcare centers. Rush's defined community, most specifically the West Side of Chicago, while incredibly resilient, faces some of the greatest hardship and health disparities in the City of Chicago - Rush hopes to serve as an anchor to alleviate some of these issues through the empowerment of communities and the wonderful individuals that call the West Side home. Some of the general population demographics are that we are seeing a great deal of diversity in our communities served. For example, there are approximately 500,000 people living in our defined west sides communities. The racial / ethnic breakdowns of our communities are quite diverse, with Austin, West and East Garfield Park, and North Lawndale averaging at least 85% of the population identifying as black, South Lawndale and Lower West Side being over 80% Hispanic/Latino and Forest Park, Oak Park, and River Forest being more varied, with whites making up the majority. We also recognize that there are a great number of youth in our communities, with 19 and under making up in some communities close to a third of the population.The City of Chicago's hardship index ranks each community area's socioeconomic hardship on a scale of 0-100, with a higher number representing a greater level of hardship. The index measures: socioeconomic indicators of public health significance; the percentage of occupied housing units with more than one person per room; the percentage of households living below the federal poverty level; the percentage of people over 16 who are unemployed; the percentage of people over 25 without a high school diploma; the percentage of the population that is under 18 or over 64; per capita income. We know that most of our communities fall under the definition of ""high hardship"" in particular East Garfield Park, West Garfield Park, Austin, North Lawndale, South Lawndale, Lower West Side, and Austin.Some highlighted demographic information of our respective communities is that they face some of the greatest hardship in the City of Chicago. For example, life expectancy varies widely on the West Side of Chicago, as if you travel from the Loop to the West Side, in particular the West Garfield Park Community, life expectancy goes from 85 years to just under 69 years. If you look at issues such as insurance status, we have some of the highest need communities, with 34.8% of the population in South Lawndale lacking health insurance. Income segregation and employment is also of high need in some of our areas, with North Lawndale having a median household income of $23,066 and an unemployment rate of 27.4 in West Garfield Park. There are many other hospitals serving these communities, but we know that access to care and community resources is still of great need and that we must work together to improve the health of our communities. Based on market scan and our community health needs assessment, we have identified 15+ hospitals located in our communities. For more information on our neighborhood breakdowns and specific demographic information, please visit our FY17-FY19 CHNA at https://www.rush.edu/sites/default/files/rush-chna-2016.pdf and the community health needs assessment plan at https://www.rush.edu/sites/default/files/community-health-implementation-plan.pdf"

Given Rush's recent system focus, the Office of Community Engagement has expanded its efforts to include alignment with system programming and talks about Rush as one entity, and lists efforts for both hospitals, including numbers. The numbers are broken down in the financials, but the description is comprehensive and the same for both hospitals - we are one Rush and have described it as suchGoal 1: Reduce inequities caused by the social, economic and structural determinants of health Rush Education and Career Hub (REACH)The Rush Education and Career Hub (REACH) extends Rush's 28-year legacy of support for Chicago school communities. Since 1990, thousands of students from pre-kindergarten to college have participated in science and math enrichment learning experiences. The REACH model provides these offerings and integrates them into a cradle-to-career pathway with a mission of increasing diversity in STEM/health care professions. Our overall goals are to increase high school graduation rates, college matriculation, interest in healthcare/STEM careers; and to build skills for the 21st-century workforce, including communication, collaboration, critical thinking, creativity, and leadership. Through enrichment, engagement, skills training and high-quality work-based learning, Rush is preparing underrepresented youth for success in the healthcare industry. Rush's dedication to promoting a healthy community has fostered a strong commitment to supporting the growth and development of our local neighborhoods; including school communities. In FY18, REACH deepened its collaboration with five partner elementary schools and four high schools with STEM and/or healthcare programs. Rush University Medical Center is uniquely situated to increase the diversity of the healthcare workforce; addressing educational opportunity gaps, and cultivating a pipeline of health professionals focused on reducing health disparities for west side neighborhoods. REACH provides programming across the pre-K-16 educational continuum through the initiatives highlighted below:Elementary Outreach (Gr. Pre-K-5)In 1998, REACH developed its preschool program to introduce preschool children to science, math, and literacy skills. REACH later expanded to include primary grades and currently provides education outreach in 6 public and private schools. The goal of the REACH Elementary Initiative is to provide a stimulating environment for the development of science, math, and literacy skills by providing science /STEM labs and materials appropriate for young children. REACH works with educators to facilitate understanding of fundamental science and math concepts and support student development of inquiry skills by using their natural curiosity to explore their surroundings. In addition to academic enrichment, Rush exposes students and their families to a variety of STEM/healthcare career pathways to inspire future career plans. REACH believes that early parental involvement is crucial for children to be successful in school and supportive in planning for college and career success. In FY18, 1038 students, 50 teachers and 300 parents participated in this program.Middle School Outreach (Gr. 6-8th)Middle school students participating in the College Preparatory Enrichment Program kicked off the year with a college campus experience at Benedictine University. Students received instruction in math, science, and technology, coupled with exposure to campus life. During the school year, students worked collaboratively to solve real-world challenges from the healthcare field. They used robotics to design a solution for medical triage in a disaster and developed an approach to counteract a flu epidemic. Students showcased their learning of inquiry-based science, technology and math integration at the annual STEM Celebration. In FY18, over 100 students participated in this program.In FY18, preparations also began for new programming targeted for 6th-8th grade students in the 2018-19 School Year. One of the new programs is the Future Ready Learning Lab, supported in part by Michael Reese Health Trust. Future Ready Learning Lab is an enrichment elective focused on building interest and awareness of careers in the STEM/healthcare field, increasing sense of self-efficacy, developing 21st century learning skills and transitioning to high school. The elective would be incorporated into the school day and include opportunities for parent and community engagement. Targeted schools are Nathaniel Dett Elementary and Washington Irving Elementary Schools.High School Outreach (Gr. 9-12)REACH's programs for grades 9 through 12 include academic, college and career development. Initiatives include specialized courses, site visits, job shadowing and summer internships at Rush that expose students to a wide range of health care careers. REACH also supports dual-credit enrollment opportunities, help student's complete college applications, provide mentoring and more. In FY18, REACH provided intensive experiences for 250 high school students.During the summer of 2018, Rush provided work-based learning experiences for over 200 youth across the medical campus. MedSTEM Pathways, our signature high school program, is designed to introduce teens to a wide range of clinical and non-clinical healthcare careers, develop leadership skills and build academic skills. MedSTEM Pathways provides pre-internships for rising sophomores, juniors, and internships for rising juniors and seniors. By leveraging resources from across Rush University Medical Center, we provide students with comprehensive, engaging experiences including personal development workshops, industry-recognized certifications, and networking with career professionals.In addition, with a generous grant from JP Morgan Chase, we completed a pilot of our Health IT program at Richard T. Crane Medical Preparatory High School (Crane). We ultimately served 55 students and saw 7 students complete their EPIC certifications over the summer. The Health IT program expanded to year-round programming and will include the creation of a playbook for scale-up and replication across the city. Chicago Public Schools Career and Technical Education Program Richard T. Crane Medical Preparatory High School (Crane) is part of the Chicago Pubic School (CPS) Career and Technical Education (CTE) Program established by the Cook County President's and the City of Chicago Mayor's offices to increase the number of Chicago's youth recruited into Chicago's healthcare workforce. Rush is a part of the CPS CTE program and collaborates with Crane. Through Rush Community Service Initiatives Program (RCSIP), Rush student and faculty volunteers provide mentorship and activities to facilitate the Crane students' efforts to successfully pursue their interest in health careers. CPS CTE activities are focused on awareness, exploration, and application of the health sciences. In addition to mentorship and educational services to all students at Crane, over 65 first-year high school students had paid healthcare related internships at Rush this past year. College (2yr- 4yr)Highly motivated college students can participate in a variety of postsecondary opportunities geared towards workforce development and academic research experiences. In preparation for summer 2019, we will refine and expand the career pathway opportunities for the College Workforce Development Program; offering paid internships and other resources to help students move quickly into full-time, living-wage employment after graduation. During FY18, 16 undergraduate students participated in college internships.Malcolm X College Partnership Malcolm X College (MXC), and Rush have a rich, multi-year history of collaboration. The partnership includes hosting students' clinical rotations in nursing, surgical technology, radiologic technology, EMT/paramedic, and respiratory care at Rush University Hospital and providing anatomy labs for MXC health occupations students. Rush also provides guest lecturers and recently began offering a monthly inter-professional lunch and learn series for MXC students and faculty. MXC wants to ensure that its graduates have the knowledge, skills and professional attributes they will need to function in the healthcare system, both now and in the future. To help achieve that goal, Rush participates in MXC advisory committees and provides transfer programs for graduates of the MXC radiologic technology and respiratory care programs to allow students the opportunity to obtain a bachelor's degree in their fields."
201941359349306924,362174823,"Part VI, Line 5","Mini Medical School The RCSIP Mini Medical School is a ten-week program that runs from late September to mid-March for students in fourth and fifth grade, from Chicago Public Schools on Chicago's West Side. The main objective of the program is to expose young students to the health sciences. This program is held at Rush University and includes an orientation, anatomy and physiology lectures, activities on the five major body systems, dissections, homework, and a completion celebration. Rush student and physician volunteers plan the curriculum, implement activities, and assist the youth during these sessions. Nearly 100 students attended.Goal 2: Improve access to mental and behavioral health services Rush School-Based Health Centers Rush has a 30-year history of providing health care at School-Based Health Centers (SBHC). Rush currently has three SBHCs located within Chicago Public Schools that include, Orr Academy High School, Richard T. Crane Medical Preparatory High School, and Simpson Academy for Young Women. Crane and Orr have students in grades 9-12 and Simpson is for girls in grades six to 12 that are pregnant, parenting, or both. All three schools have student bodies from underserved populations, and are located in neighborhoods with high poverty levels and hardship.The Rush SBHC's act as safety nets for these vulnerable students. Wide-ranging clinic services are provided by advanced practice nurses, registered nurses, collaborating physicians and large numbers of Rush's inter-professional students. The services include physicals, immunizations, treatment of injuries, primary care, intermittent care, mental health services, prenatal care, pregnancy prevention programs, heath education programs and health care for the children of the students. Outcomes of this health care and education collaboration include improved immunization rates, decreased incidence of infectious disease, decreased emergency room usage, detecting and treating illness, healthy baby deliveries, increased access to mental health services, success in pregnancy prevention programs, and students establishing healthy living patterns aimed at chronic disease prevention and improved graduation rates. In FY18, these health centers provided 3,105 healthcare encounters to 941 students.Adolescent Family Center The Rush Adolescent Family Center (AFC) has existed for over forty years. The AFC provides reproductive healthcare, prenatal care, gynecological care, pregnancy prevention programs, sexually transmitted infection (STI) testing and treatment, and community health education to underserved Chicago-area youth. All of AFC's services are provided regardless of income or ability to pay for care. Although AFC draws patients from over 107 Chicago-area zip codes, the majority of patients served reside in the Chicago West Side communities of East Garfield Park, West Garfield Park, North Lawndale, Austin, Humboldt Park and the Near West Side. As part of AFC's community education program, staffs regularly travel off-site to Chicago-area high schools and middle schools to provide community education on pregnancy prevention, reproductive anatomy, contraception, sexually transmitted infection prevention and reproductive health. AFC also offers free prenatal education classes to pregnant teens and their partners. In FY18, AFC provided clinic services to 517 youth - in total 2,117 healthcare encounters - and provided 13,830 hours of reproductive health education to youth at 22 different schools through community education encounters. The Road Home Program at the Center for Veterans and Their Families at Rush The Road Home Program provides care for the ""invisible wounds of war"" for veterans and their families. Services for veterans deployed in Iraq and Afghanistan include: an adult mental health clinic that specializes in post-traumatic stress disorder; child and family services such as support groups, counseling and guidance for parenting; traumatic brain injury clinic; a military sexual trauma clinic; and an Intensive Outpatient Program (IOP). The IOP is a three-week program where veterans locally, and from all around the country fly in to receive intensive treatment Monday thru Friday, 8:00am to 4:00pm. This past year the Road Home Program provided clinical services to 725 veterans and their family members for a total of 7,523 encounters. In addition, the Road Home Program conducted veteran outreach to 14,578 people within the community (veteran organizations, veterans, and veteran family members) in the past year and has reached a total of 33,890 individuals to date.College of Nursing Faculty Practice ProgramThe College of Nursing (CON) has a 30-year history of providing healthcare services to underserved individuals, families, and communities at a variety of diverse community practice sites through the CON Faculty Practice Program. These sites are deployed where individuals live, learn and work and include a wellness and health program for the Children's School at the Lighthouse for the Blind, a women's health clinic, a case management program for chronic medical and mental illness, a work-place health clinic for the working poor and nurse practitioner led primary healthcare sites. Most recipients of care at the faculty practice sites are uninsured or underinsured and rely on the sites as their main healthcare source. In addition to the hours of care provided by Rush CON faculty practitioners, Rush nursing students deliver healthcare and health education services at the various sites. The students' efforts greatly enhance the volume of health services provided. In addition, Rush University nursing, medical, physician assistant and health systems management students volunteer at these sites developing and delivering health education programs. Nearly two-thousand health encounters are provided per year through the CON Faculty Practice Program. Goal 3: Prevent and reduce chronic disease by focusing on risk factors 5 + 1 = 20 5 + 1 = 20 is a Rush Community Service Initiatives Program (RCSIP) that aims to educate high school students at Chicago Public Schools on the five diseases prevalent in the surrounding underserved community (asthma, hypertension, HIV, diabetes, and cancer). 5 + 1 = 20 is based on the idea that knowledge of these 5 common conditions plus 1 informed high school student (or person) can extend one's life by 20 years (individuals without health insurance have a life expectancy of 20 years less than the general US population). Twice a month, Rush student volunteers teach a health topic related to the five diseases to high school students. The content of the interactive health lectures ranges from disease prevention to practical skills such checking blood pressure. The high school students have opportunities to spread their knowledge through 5 + 1 = 20 health fairs at their schools. Health fair activities include body mass index calculations, blood pressure screenings, vision screenings, glucose level checks, referrals, and health education. Health fair participants include families and friends of the students as well as other members of their communities. This past year, 5 + 1 = 20 provided health education and screenings to approximately 3,845 community members.Mini Health Fairs Rush's Professional Nursing staff helps provide Mini Health Fairs for patients receiving care at Thresholds, an organization that provides services to individuals with chronic mental illness. The Mini Health Fairs provide health education and screenings. This is important since those living with chronic mental illness have a lifespan that is 25 years less than the general population related to chronic medical diseases. This past year, PNS provided health education and screenings to approximately 75 community members.Oak Park Hospital Health & Wellness FairIn FY18 the annual ROPH health and wellness fair provided more than 366 health screenings to participants which include blood pressure, fasting glucose and lipid profile blood tests. Many departments participated by hosting health information booths. These booths were staffed with clinicians who were provided information on diabetes, stroke, cancer, weight management, breast imaging and more. In addition, primary care doctors from Rush Oak Park Physicians Group were on hand to answer health related questions. A healthy breakfast was provided to attendees. Project Lifestyle ChangeFor the sixth consecutive year, ROPH's Project Lifestyle Change, a group education and support program that informs on pre-diabetes health, continued to make an impact in the community. The program teaches blood glucose monitoring, restricted fat and calorie meal planning, exercise and behavior modification at no charge."

Facing Forward is a housing first program that provides permanent housing to homeless individuals with histories of substance abuse. In addition to their substance abuse histories approximately 60% have other mental health issues and a high burden of chronic diseases. The Wellness Center utilizes a holistic and diverse approach to address the mental and physical health issues of the population. The weekly sessions are supported by inter-professional student volunteers and faculty from Rush University in addition to other community partners. The Rush University students receive training in motivational interviewing to enhance their skills as life coaches when assisting participants in their decisions to make healthier life-style choices. The two hour weekly sessions incorporate blood pressures and weight checks, life coach counseling, health education lectures, healthy cooking demonstrations and 30 minutes of exercise. This program has assisted many of the women in decreasing tobacco use and reducing anxiety. Outcomes to date include an increased consciousness of the importance of taking control of one's health, healthier eating habits, increased activity, sustained weight loss, and smoking reduction. This past year, Facing Forward provided health education and screenings to approximately 44 residents.A weekly student-led community program at Rush Wellness Center at Facing Forward was designed to offer health screening and health coaching to underserved women and children, and enhance students' ability to provide team-based care for diverse populations. There are approximately 13-16 participants in the program and about 21 student health coaches. The health coaches are formally trained in motivational interviewing. Within two years the outcomes of this initiative included 62% of participants lost an average of 11 pounds of weight, 79% participants said that the program motivated them to eat healthier, 59% said that the program motivated them to exercise more and 14% said that the program motivated them to reduce smoking.Rush Department of Social Work and Community Health The health promotion/disease prevention focus of the Rush Department of Social Work and Community Health (SWACH) provides patients, their families, and community members access to an array of programs that provide support and promote wellness through educational programs, physical activity classes, support groups and workshops. Rush Generations, a free health affinity membership program of approximately 15,000 members, offers older adults and their caregivers the opportunity to benefit from health and wellness educational programs. Rush Generations offers its members a free quarterly newsletter, monthly e-newsletter, access to community health fairs and screenings, and opportunities to become more active and engaged by joining the Generations volunteer ambassador program. Transitional care to support patients and caregivers after hospital stays using the Bridge Model, addressing medical and non-medical issues as part of an inter-professional care team. Outpatient social work care management with social workers integrated into primary and specialty care to assess and address psychosocial issues related to care, using the AIMS Model. Mental health and collaborative care, including psychotherapy, supportive services, and coordination with primary care to support patients 12+ years old who screen positively for depression.SWACH operates the Anne Bryon Waud Resource Center and the Tower Resource Center (TRC), which are both open daily to the public. Each center is staffed by a licensed clinical social worker who is available to help with a myriad of issues related to health and chronic health issues that particularly impact adults and caregivers. The Senior Health Insurance Program (SHIP), which provides free options counseling to assist with navigation of Medicare and related benefits. SWACH is also leading the Social Determinants of Health initiative, which identifies, measures, and mitigates the social determinants of health of patients and community members by offering closed-loop referrals to services and resources to alleviate health disparities.SWACH also operates the Center for Health and Social Care Integration, which provides technical assistance and a peer learning community to support practice and systems change with community-based organizations and health systems across the country. The Center teaches lessons from research and applies them to clinical and community settings, improving how health professionals deliver care and prevent diseases. The Center does this by having its health care provider members work closely together and share information, providing services and collaborating across five core areas: Research, Older Adult and Family Care, Education, Community Health Equity and Policy.Tour de West Side Started by a Rush medical student's Summer Dean's Project, Rush began to sponsor five 5Ks on the West Side given its commitment to improving health. This idea was well received, with a committee meeting occurring on a monthly basis and an aim to encourage employees and students to sign up for the annual neighborhood 5Ks in Garfield Park, Austin, North Lawndale, Pilsen, and Little Village. Rush subsidized the cost of participation for employees. West Side Walk to WellnessThe West Side Walk to Wellness, another student's Summer Dean's Project, was developed to enhance exercise and walking in our West Side communities, create a sense of engagement, and level of safety to be outside in the community. The program, which lasted 8 weeks, engaged 125 unique community members from Rush and the communities we serve. Goal 4: Increase access to care and community servicesRCSIP Clinics RCSIP Clinics are run by Rush volunteers, more specifically a physician lead and an inter-professional team of Rush student volunteers. The clinics offer various services to patients such as physical exams, health education, free basic medications, and procedures such as wound care and use referrals to help patients establish primary and/or specialty care relationships that are affordable or available through charity care. Examples of these clinics include:1.RCSIP Clinic at Franciscan Outreach is located within the Franciscan House homeless shelter for adult men and women. Over 1,892 healthcare encounters/visits were provided during FY18.2.RCSIP Clinic at Freedom Center serves adult males that are in rehabilitation for substance abuse issues. The clinic is housed within the Salvation Army's Harbor Light Center and provided healthcare to over 158 men during FY18. 3.RCSIP Clinic at Chicago City Church serves homeless and other at-risk adults. Over 157 patients were seen at this clinic during FY 18. Additional Community Benefit ProgrammingRush maintains many partnerships and programs in order to improve the health of the communities that we serve. Programs related to community benefit, are listed below.Adopt-a-Family (AAF) and Adopt-A-Rush-Family (AARF)AAF is a program that occurs around the winter Holiday season, where families from surrounding communities are adopted to help make their holidays a little brighter. Rush employees from both hospitals donate presents for families. Most of these families are experiencing poverty or homelessness, and living at 200% or more below the poverty line. The AARF program is a new addition to this platform in which Rush employees who are experiencing hardships during the holiday season are adopted. During FY18, Rush adopted a total of 200 families, 14 of which were Rush employees.Blood Drives In collaboration with the American Red Cross (ARC), Rush hosts blood drives within both hospitals. The Donate Life event invites all of Rush and the public to join us in one convenient location to participate and sign-up for the National Marrow Donor Program (NMDP), Organ and Tissue Registration, Rush Blood and Platelet donor programs and ARC Blood Drive. By providing a central location as well as employee and student volunteers for these events, Rush provides a much needed life resources to the people of Chicago and beyond. In FY18, approximately 373 whole blood units were collected."

The goals of this project are to improve education, employment, and health outcomes of the underserved West Side and South Side communities of Chicago served by Rush. This is being achieved through creating new models of care that focus on inter-professional teams and proactive care coordination, developing and training a workforce from the community that supports these new models of care, and rigorously measuring and evaluating each project component for sustainability and replication. One of the major focuses of this project is to develop and train a workforce to deliver high value population-based health care. Embedding training opportunities within existing models of care will improve quality, efficiency, and reduce costs. There are five components of workforce development that include the Rush Community Investments Initiative, and Curriculum Development for Allied Health Professionals, Scholarships for Rush Bachelor of Science in Health Sciences, Continuing Education Training for existing healthcare providers, and Health Disparities Research and Evaluation Fellowships. These components target different levels of the healthcare workforce thus creating a pipeline of educational programs. The program components are described in further detail below. Charitable ContributionsCharitable contributions are a series of donations to community based organizations and nonprofits determined by the Senior Leadership Team on behalf of Rush. The funds are intended to support community initiatives and events throughout the fiscal year. In FY18, Rush corporate funds for the hospitals were donated to 37 organizations totaled approximately $415,100. Chicago Healthcare System Coalition for Preparedness and Response Since 2008, Rush has been an active member of the Hospital Preparedness Program (HPP), administered by the Department of Health and Human Services. The HPP's mission is to improve the ability of hospitals and healthcare systems to respond to public health emergencies. The heart of the HPP is the Chicago Healthcare System Coalition for Preparedness and Response (CHSCPR). The purpose of the CHSCPR is to develop plans to unify, coordinate and manage emergency planning and response for the healthcare system within the City of Chicago. During a planned event or unplanned disaster or emergency, the CHSCPR participates and supports response efforts in coordination with the Chicago Department of Public Health [CDPH]. The support shall be in the form of sharing information and subject matter expertise that will enhance emergency preparedness capacity and proficiency across the healthcare system during emergencies. In June 2012, the HPP aligned with the Public Health Emergency Preparedness (PHEP) grant program to develop capabilities based processes targeting disaster preparedness and resiliency at the community level. The functional units of CHSCPR are working committees, which address HPP - PHEP capabilities. The committees are led by co-chairs chosen through an application process by the CHSCPR's executive committee. Rush has been actively involved in this program by co-chairing the Medical Surge Capability which has been divided into three distinct committees: Pediatrics Planning Committee, Crisis Standards of Care Planning Committee and Behavioral Health Committee.Continuing Education Training for existing healthcare providers Continuing Education Training is being offered to existing care coordinators, outreach workers, and clinicians at federally qualified health centers within the Medical Home Network Accountable Care Organization, to prepare them for future healthcare needs. The modules offered include motivational interview training, leading change, mental health first aid, and disease-specific trainings. Approximately 850 clinicians and care team members have been trained so far.Curriculum Development for Allied Health ProfessionalsA competency and assessment based basic certificate program for community health workers (CHW) has been launched at Malcolm X College in fall 2014. The goal is to allow students graduating from these programs to enroll and transfer credits to a bachelor program, thus creating career ladders for these students. We have had a completion rate of 56% from the first cohort of the CHW basic certificate program.Extreme Weather AssistanceIn conjunction with the Village of Oak Park, ROPH offers space in its emergency room for those without adequate air conditioning or heat in instances of extreme temperatures. This effort helps prevent hypothermia and frostbite in extreme cold; and heat stroke and other heat-related illnesses when the thermometers spike. Health Disparities Research and Evaluation FellowshipsThe Health Disparities Fellowship program is designed to develop a cadre of well-trained health care researchers with a passion for creating sustainable ways for providing access to high-quality care for individuals in underserved communities. The fellowship targets individuals with PhDs, MDs, and other terminal degrees with a strong foundation in research methods and knowledge of the health care field. Expertise in health services research, epidemiology, bioinformatics, community health, public health, or health economics is preferred. These mentored fellowships involve development and evaluation of new ways to educate and deploy community-based providers, and evaluation of the new models of care in which they will be working. Fellowships span over a five-year period with a timeframe of two-three years for each cohort. The third cohort began their fellowships January of 2018. Each fellow has identified an area of research that is directly aligned with the priorities of community health and quality of life improvement, with a particular focus on the communities served by Rush. Their projects will focus on care coordination, mental health, social determinants of health, education program evaluation and career pathways. Within this first year of the fellowship the second cohort has completed 19 external presentations, and had 1 manuscript accepted for publication.Illinois Medical District Hospital Emergency Preparedness CoalitionRush is a founding and active member of the Illinois Medical District Hospital Emergency Preparedness Coalition (IMD HEPC). The mission of this coalition is to create and maintain a community wide emergency management within one of the nation's largest urban healthcare, educational, research and technology districts resulting in minimal loss of life and reduced collateral damage to surrounding structures and the environment during a disaster.Medical Home Network Accountable Care OrganizationThe Medical Home Network (MHN) is a public private partnership founded by the Comer Science and Education Foundation to address the healthcare needs of underserved individuals living on the South and Southwest sides of Chicago. Most recently, MHN created the MHN Accountable Care Organization (MHN ACO), which is a partnership of 3 area hospitals (including Rush) and 9 Federally Qualified Health Centers (FQHCs) working to improve access, quality, and utilization for all of their primary care Medicaid patients enrolled in County Care. This organization is utilizing best practices in the industry to reach the most vulnerable of patients and providing care coordination enhancements to improve the lives of their patients. Rush takes a leadership role in MHN in many ways. For example, Rush's Vice President, Population Health has served on the MHN ACO board and our CEO previously served as chair for four years. As an Academic Medical Center, Rush provides the Better Care Teams educational program to MHN ACO clinicians and to the entire ACO network with the Centralized Complex Care Coordination (4C) program. 4C at Rush is a dedicated wrap-around, inter-professional care team model, which aims to provide complex care coordination and management for the highest needs ACO network patients.Rush Heart Walk The Rush University Hospital and ROPH Heart Walk team promotes heart health and associate camaraderie while raising lifesaving funds. For this event, Rush University Hospital and ROPH are closely aligned with the American Heart Association's mission of building healthier lives free of cardiovascular diseases and stroke. Our partnership is evidenced in our patient care, community education and employee wellness programs, and Heart Walk participation. Rush University Hospital and ROPH employees raised over $113,049 for this cause this past year with Rush contributing through providing internal resources for the annual Heart Walk."

The network provides access to vascular neurology services for ischemic stroke patients that present in one of our affiliate emergency rooms 24-hours a day, seven days a week, 365 days a year. Board-certified vascular neurologists from the Rush Stroke Program assess patients and help the affiliate emergency department physicians determine if a patient is a candidate for tissue plasminogen activator (TPA) through an FDA-cleared telemedicine platform. Telemedicine allows consulting physicians to speak face-to-face with patients and their families, as well as remote clinical staff. The telemedicine assessment includes reviewing CT scans and vital signs, and the high-definition camera allows the Rush neurologist to even view a patient's pupils. The physician has access to the patient's medical information through an electronic health record. Within minutes, the stroke neurologist, along with the remote clinical staff, can determine a plan of care and then turn over the treatment to the emergency physician or initiate a transfer if the patient requires advanced neurological care such as an endovascular procedure. This is particularly important, as time is of the essence, and this helps remove any transportation limitations for our patients to better serve the community. During FY18, the services provided by Rush health professionals through this 12-site network impacted the lives of over 1,200 patients.Ruth M. Rothstein CORE CenterRush and the Cook County Health and Hospitals System collaborated to create the Ruth M. Rothstein CORE Center in 1998. The CORE Center is the nation's first public-private outpatient facility dedicated to the care of people with HIV/AIDS. Today, it is the largest, most comprehensive provider of HIV/AIDS treatment in the Midwest. Faculty members from Rush and Stroger Hospital work side-by-side delivering care to this population. The Center also serves patients with tuberculosis, hepatitis and other infectious diseases. Clinical research projects at the center seek new answers in screening, treating and halting the spread of infectious diseases. In addition, Larry Goodman, MD, chief executive officer at Rush University Medical Center, serves on the Board of the CORE Foundation. The Foundation built the CORE Center and completed a major facility improvement project in 2012. Rush's partnership with CORE is particularly important. While HIV is now a manageable disease in which individuals can lead healthy lives, the disease persists. In its Healthy Chicago 2.0 strategy, the Chicago Department of Public Health specifically highlights goals to end transmission.Scholarships and Internships for Rush Bachelor of Science in Health Sciences Students In an attempt to create career ladders for individuals from low-income underserved communities, a ""pipeline program"" is funded through this project. Individuals from the Malcolm X City College can enroll and transfer credits to the Rush Bachelor of Science in Health Sciences program. These students are offered scholarships for two years. We have offered approximately $56,000 in scholarships over a period of two years.United Way of Metropolitan Chicago The United Way of Metropolitan Chicago seeks to assist local communities of greatest need around income, education and health - the building blocks to a good quality of life. Each year through the Rush United Way Campaign, Rush employees raise money through an annual campaign to support the United Way mission, focused on the social determinants of health for individuals and families across the Chicagoland region. In 2018, Rush University Hospital and ROPH employees donated $258,204 with Rush contributing through providing internal resources for Rush's United Way campaign."

This application was available for usage by Financial Counselors and could be mailed to patients that call Customer Service requesting financial assistance. Rush also had a Spanish plain language summary available directly from the financial counselors. However, Rush was not compliant in having the full financial assistance policy translated into Spanish for all of FY18.

Rush estimates that this affected approximately 14,000 RUMC patients who received the written notice about upcoming ECAs without the plain language summary. Rush implemented procedures to ensure compliance with this requirement going forward. As of May 2, 2018 Rush began including the plain language summary as part of the last collection statement that Rush sends out before placing accounts with bad debt vendors.

Rush's AGB calculation had last been completed in January of 2016 using the look-back method based on claims allowed by Medicare fee-for-service and all private health insurers that pay claims to the hospital facility during a prior 12-month period. However, Rush did not calculate AGB on an annual basis after that calculation was completed in January 2016 as required. This was discovered in November 2017 as Rush worked with tax consultants on Schedule H. Rush calculated what AGB would have been for FY17 on February 2, 2018. This was evaluated by determining the AGB for claims allowed in FY17 and comparing that to the discounts offered to patients who qualify for financial assistance under the FAP (either 75% discount or 100% discount, depending on patient eligibility). Rush identified three instances where the patient remitted payment for a percent of charges exceeding AGB. These payments, totaling $305.62, were made by the patient prior to applying for and obtaining FAP eligibility. The charges in excess of AGB weren't made or requested as a pre-condition of RUMC providing medically necessary care and refunds were initiated on all three payments in FY19. Rush has provided additional training to the credit balance team and has implemented a checklist of items that will ensure compliance with the AGB requirement. The AGB calculation has been moved to a standard schedule within the accounting department to ensure this does not occur again and the most recent AGB calculation was implemented by April 1, 2019. In addition to above, in FY17 the language in the FAP was updated to include a hyperlink to the actual AGB percentage calculated, however for part of FY18 that hyperlink was not functional and the AGB percentage could not be found online.

If no proof of income is provided or a guarantor's income is greater than 201% of the federal poverty level, the appropriate discount according to the established criteria up to 600% of the federal poverty level will be applied. The amount of money not collected from those self-pay patients who are not eligible for charity care is reported as bad debt.

Nonetheless, the Medicare program, in many cases, does not provide payment that covers the full cost of the care provided. Since it is the mission of the hospital to respond to community need, hospital leadership continually advocates for improved Medicare payment so that the cost of quality care to those patients who are not able to afford it is not compromised and is fairly subsidized by all payers. The IRS does not classify this shortfall in Medicare payments as Community Benefit. However, we believe it is an important contribution made by the hospital to the health and well-being of the community. If the Medicare program did not exist, many Medicare patients would be eligible for financial assistance or other means-tested government programs. Further, by absorbing this shortfall and providing care below cost to these individuals, St. John's Hospital is relieving the burden of the government. Accordingly, this shortfall restricts St. John's Hospital's ability to make funds available to provide for financial assistance and other Community Benefit. The hospital Medicare shortfall at cost for fiscal year 2018 was $19,583,968."

If the patient qualified for charity/community care for the full balance of their account, the entire amount is written off to charity/community care and hence no debt collection is pursued. If the patient qualified for charity/community care for a portion of their account balance, that portion is written off to charity/community care, with the patient being responsible for the remainder of the balance. Additionally, reasonable effort will be made to obtain third-party or government payer reimbursement on behalf of the patient. If those efforts are not fruitful, an offer will be extended to the patient to make installment payments on their balance. Only at such point that the patient defaults on installment payments or refuses to cooperate with the hospital's efforts to be reimbursed will the account be sent to collections. The hospital will make reasonable efforts to determine whether a patient is eligible under the financial assistance policy before it engages in an ECA. To the extent a patient is determined to be eligible for financial assistance under the FAP, the hospital will take all reasonably available measures to reverse any ECA taken against the patient to obtain payment for the care."

Throughout the three-year CHNA cycle, the hospital continuously reviews updated local and state data, Illinois Comp Data, patient surveys and feedback, program pre/post surveys and local needs assessments conducted by community groups. Additionally, the hospital received input from public health officials, community groups including the Ministerial Alliance, and community boards on an ongoing basis. The information received and reviewed is used to inform ongoing strategic initiatives developed to meet CHNA health priorities; as well as new areas of need that are going unmet. When appropriate the hospital will develop or enhance services, community programs, or strategies to meet newly identified needs. For example, in FY2015 the hospital did not prioritize the following needs identified through the CHNA process: child abuse, dental care, diabetes; however, as data pointed to the increase in need surrounding these areas the hospital developed strategies to meet those needs. See below for examples. 1. Child abuse: In FY2018, St. John's, Prevent Child Abuse, and the Department of Children and Family Services partnered to promote awareness and education opportunities during April: Child Abuse Prevention month. Additionally, three screenings of the film Resilience were held to bring awareness to the impact of child abuse and adversity on children and adults. 2. Dental care: While this was not originally selected, opportunity presented for HSHS St. John's Hospital to partner with Central Counties Health Center, a federally qualified health center, to host a dental clinic in the hospital. St. John's provides the space and overhead costs free of charge; and CCHC provides the dentist, supplies and equipment. 3.

The Financial Assistance Program brochure and application are available in English and Spanish. The organization has a representative on site to assist patients who may be eligible for Medicaid assistance through the Illinois Department of Public Assistance. They work with patients to determine if they may be eligible, and if so, assist in pulling together the necessary application for submission. One-on-one conversations to educate patients about financial assistance often stem from patients receiving a statement or a pre-collection letter. At that point, the customer service representative or cashier, or other qualified staff, will inform/educate the caller about financial assistance options. The first pre-collection letter reminds the patient their account is in delinquent status. It also informs them they may be eligible for financial assistance through the organization's charity care program. The letter provides direct contact information to begin the application process for charity care and lists the Internet address where the policy can be obtained. A system called Pay Now is now being utilized after failed attempts made by the hospital and our law firm to work out payment arrangements. That system accesses credit and other information and allows us to see the probability of a patient being able to pay their bill.

Founded in 1875, the hospital brings a healing presence and improves the health of our community, especially those persons who are sick, poor, and disadvantaged. Because of the hospital's mission and heritage, the hospital is dedicated to promoting the health of Springfield and surrounding areas. The hospital is governed by a Board of Directors, most of whom reside in the hospital's primary service area and who are neither employees nor independent contractors of the hospital (nor family members thereof). The Board ensures that St. John's Hospital is responding to community need. In FY2018, for example, the Board reviewed the Community Health Needs Assessment and approved an Implementation Plan for addressing selected health focus areas. The hospital also has a Patient and Family Advisory Council, Foundation Board, Caregiver Interfaith Volunteer Services Committee, and Samaritan Volunteers that help the hospital connect with the community. Consistent with its exempt purpose, St. John's Hospital has an open medical staff with privileges available to all qualified physicians in the area. The hospital also operates an emergency department that is open 24 hours to all persons regardless of their ability to pay. As a not-for-profit hospital, St. John's Hospital reinvests surplus funds to support the mission of the organization and promote the health of the community rather than distributing surplus funds as profits to shareholders or individuals. Funds not committed to ongoing operations are generally used to upgrade facilities, secure new technologies, improve patient care, and support initiatives designed to promote health and ensure access for all, provide medical education and conduct medical research. For example, St. John's Hospital provided $436,500 for financial counselors to assist patients and community members in accessing charity care, signing up for Medicare / Medicaid, and enrolling through the Marketplace. Additionally, St. John's provided $129,206 to support community health worker programs to meet high risk, underserved patients and community members in their home. St. John's provided $190,709 for medical research and $13,676,543 for medical education. In FY2018, St. John's made an $8 million investment in facilities upgrades to improve technologies and patient care. These projects included a new Siemens 3T MRI, Stryker's Robotic-Arm Assisted System for total knee replacement, bronchoscopes, sleep lab cameras, da Vinci Xi Robot scopes, Advanced Telehealth ICU Care and patient bed mattresses. These investments will allow us to deliver exceptional and high-quality care with state of the art equipment and advance technologies. St. John's also made substantial investments to upgrade hospital floors including a $2 million remodel of more than 20 pediatric rooms, refreshing the ICU waiting room, remodeling the 11th floor, beautifying the cath lab waiting room and installing new flooring in the wound care center. In FY2018, St. John's largest investment was the implementation of the new EPIC electronic health record. A brand-new cardiac ICU (CVICU) opened in July 2018 to replace the cardiac ICUs that separated surgical and non-surgical heart patients within the hospital. The new CIVICU helps facilitate collaboration between heart surgeons, cardiologists, ICU physicians, specialists and support staff while incorporating technology that will help the hospital better engage patients and their families. It is the most recent step in our continued commitment to providing the best heart care in the central and southern Illinois regions. St. John's opened its newly renovated cancer center in August 2018. The new center includes an infusion center, medical oncology physician clinics and radiation oncology, as well as lab services, all inside the St. John's Pavilion. Patients can now be seen by their oncologist and radiation oncologist, have lab work completed and receive chemotherapy treatments and any transfusions deemed necessary by their oncologist all under one roof. St. John's Hospital collaborated with SIU Medicine and HSHS Med Group to build a new Women and Children's Center to be opened in December 2018. The clinic will be the new home for St. John's pediatric rehabilitation services, SIU pediatric and subspecialty clinics, SIU OB/GYN clinics, the SIU maternal-fetal medicine clinic and HSHS Medical Group pediatric surgical services. In addition, the facility will offer St. John's outpatient services, including diagnostic imaging, mammography, laboratory, pediatric cardiodiagnostics and a cafe with a variety of food and beverage offerings. A full-service pharmacy is also planned on the first floor of the center. St. John's Hospital also devotes significant resources to access for patients who cannot afford care, along with other Community Benefits. In FY2018, St. Johns' Hospital provided $42,727,511 in Community Benefit, including financial assistance at cost, unpaid costs of Medicaid and other public programs, and a range of diverse programs designed to enhance access and improve community health. Additionally, in FY2018, St. John's provided $1.8 million (at cost) in uncompensated care to patients who did not qualify for charity care or public assistance and more than $19.6 million (at cost) in excess of Medicare payment for health care services. St. John's Hospital provides a range of Community Benefit initiatives and programs that further our mission and long-standing commitment to our community. In many cases, these Community Benefits would not exist without the leadership role played by St. John's Hospital and they often relieve a burden that would otherwise be carried by government."

However, the organization is included in the consolidated financial statements of Catholic Health Initiatives. The consolidated footnote reads as follows: The provision for bad debts is based upon management's assessment of historical and expected net collections, taking into consideration historical business and economic conditions, trends in health care coverage, and other collection indicators. Management routinely assesses the adequacy of the allowances for uncollectible accounts based upon historical write-off experience by payor category. The results of these reviews are used to modify, as necessary, the provision for bad debts and to establish appropriate allowances for uncollectible net patient accounts receivable. After satisfaction of amounts due from insurance, CHI follows established guidelines for placing certain patient balances with collection agencies, subject to the terms of certain restrictions on collection efforts as determined by each facility. The provision for bad debts is presented in the consolidated statement of operations as a deduction from patient services revenues (net of contractual allowances and discounts) since CHI accepts and treats all patients without regard to the ability to pay."
201911339349302481,470757164,"Schedule H, Part III, Line 8 Community benefit & methodology for determining medicare costs","Using essentially the same Medicare cost report principles as to the allocation of general services costs and ""apportionment"" methods, the ""CHI Workbook"" calculates a payers' gross allowable costs by service (so as to facilitate a corresponding comparison between gross allowable costs and ultimate payments received). The term ""gross allowable costs"" means costs before any deductibles or co-insurance are subtracted. Alegent Creighton Health's ultimate reimbursement will be reduced by any applicable copayment/deductible. Where Medicare is the secondary insurer, amounts due from the insured's primary payer were not subtracted from Medicare allowable costs because the amounts are typically immaterial. Although not presented on the Medicare cost report, in order to facilitate a more accurate understanding of the ""true"" cost of services (for ""shortfall"" purposes) the CHI Workbook allows a health care facility not to offset costs that Medicare considers to be non-allowable, but for which the facility can legitimately argue are related to the care of the facility's patients. In addition, although not reportable on the Medicare cost report, the CHI workbook includes the cost of services that are paid via a set fee-schedule rather than being reimbursed based on costs (e.g. outpatient clinical laboratory). Finally, the CHI Workbook allows a facility to include other health care services performed by a separate facility (such as a physician practice) that are maintained on separate books and records (as opposed to the main facility's books and records which has its costs of service included within a cost report). True costs of Medicare computed using this methodology: Total Medicare Revenue: $47,420,990 Total Medicare costs: $110,264,303 Surplus or Shortfall: ($62,843,313) Alegent Creighton Health believes that excluding Medicare losses from community benefit makes the overall community benefit report more credible for these reasons: Unlike subsidized areas such as burn units or behavioral-health services, Medicare is not a differentiating feature of tax-exempt health care organizations. In fact, for-profit hospitals focus on attracting patients with Medicare coverage, especially in the case of well-paid services that include cardiac and orthopedics. Significant effort and resources are devoted to ensuring that hospitals are reimbursed appropriately by the Medicare program. The Medicare Payment Advisory Commission (MedPAC), an independent Congressional agency, carefully studies Medicare payment and the access to care that Medicare beneficiaries receive. The commission recommends payment adjustments to Congress accordingly. Though Medicare losses are not included by Catholic hospitals as community benefit, the Catholic Health Association guidelines allow hospitals to count as community benefit some programs that specifically serve the Medicare population. For instance, if hospitals operate programs for patients with Medicare benefits that respond to identified community needs, generate losses for the hospital, and meet other criteria, these programs can be included in the CHA framework in Category C as ''subsidized health services''. Medicare losses are different from Medicaid losses, which are counted in the CHA community benefit framework, because Medicaid reimbursements generally do not receive the level of attention paid to Medicare reimbursement. Medicaid payment is largely driven by what states can afford to pay, and is typically substantially less than what Medicare pays."
201911339349302481,470757164,"Schedule H, Part III, Line 9b Collection practices for patients eligible for financial assistance","The organization's billing and collections policy applies to all individuals presenting for emergency or other medically necessary care. The policy contains provisions for collecting amounts due from those patients who the organization knows to qualify for financial assistance either through the traditional financial assistance application process or through presumptive eligibility processes. Before engaging in extraordinary collection actions (ECAs) to obtain payment for EMCare, Hospital Facilities must make reasonable efforts through its billing and collections processes, pursuant to Treas. Reg. 1.501(r)-6(c), to determine whether an individual is eligible for Financial Assistance. In no event will an ECA be initiated prior to 120 days from the date the Facility provides the first post-discharge billing statement (i.e., during the Notification Period) unless all reasonable efforts have been made. Hospital Facilities will not refer accounts for collection where the patient has initially applied for Financial Assistance, and the Hospital Facility has not yet made reasonable efforts with respect to the account. For patients and Guarantors who are unable to provide required documentation, a Hospital Facility may grant Presumptive Financial Assistance based on information obtained from other resources. Patients who qualify for Medicaid are presumed to qualify for full charity write off. Any charges for days or services written off (excluding Medicaid denials related to timeliness of billing, insufficient medical record documentation, missing invoices, authorization, or eligibility issues) as a result of a Medicaid are booked as charity. Some Medicaid plans offer coverage for a limited or restricted list of services. If a patient is eligible for Medicaid, any charges for days or services not covered by the patient's coverage may be written off to charity without a completed application. This does not include any Share of Cost (SOC) or other patient cost-sharing amounts such as deductibles or copayments, as such costs are determined by the state to be an amount that the patient must pay before the patient is eligible for Medicaid. Health and Human Services (HSS) uses the term ""Spend Down"" instead of Share of Cost. All collection activities conducted by the Facility, a Designated Supplier, or its third-party collection agents will be in conformance with all federal and state laws governing debt collection practices. All third-party agreements governing collection and recovery activities must include a provision requiring compliance with the hospital facilities' financial assistance and billing and collections policy and indemnification for failures as a result of its noncompliance. This includes, but is not limited to, agreements between third parties who subsequently sell or refer debt of the Hospital Facility."

PRC is a nationally recognized healthcare consulting firm with extensive experience conducting CHNAs across the United States since 1994. Along with several other community stakeholders, CHI Health was an active key health partner working with PRC to design, implement, and review the data. The Omaha Metro Area CHNA, conducted by PRC, utilized both primary and secondary data collected through the PRC Community Health Survey (primary); Online Key Informant Survey (primary); and public health, vital statistics, and other data collection (secondary). Please reference the complete CHNA for more in-depth details regarding the CHNA process. The process of identifying the community health needs across Pierce County was accomplished by utilizing the Mobilizing for Action through Planning and Partnerships (MAPP) strategy led by the North Central District Health Department (NCDHD). * North Central District Health Department (NCDHD) is a state-approved district health department that serves nine rural Nebraska counties-Antelope, Boyd, Brown, Cherry, Holt, Keya Paha, Knox, Pierce, and Rock. NCDHD has been state-approved as a multi-county public health department, a government body at the county level, since December 2001, providing education and services to the nine-county area. NCDHD completed a Community Health Needs Assessment for all nine counties within their district. * Ionia Research- Joseph Nitzke, PhD- North Central District Health Department and the partnering district hospitals contracted with Dr. Joseph Nitzke for data collection, compilation, analysis, and presentation for this community health assessment process. Facilitated by public health leaders, MAPP is a community-driven strategic planning approach used to improve community health through applying strategic thinking to prioritize public health issues and identify the resources to address them. This approach utilized both primary and secondary data collected throughout the process. Primary data included four MAPP assessments and secondary data consisted of public health, vital statistics, and other data collection. The assessment also incorporates a broad range of both qualitative and quantitative data. The quantitative data is primary (as derived from the North Central District Health Department Community Health Survey) and secondary (as derived from statistics from large datasets, as well as hospital-specific data); these resources allow for trend analysis and comparisons to both state and national levels. Qualitative data input is also derived from the North Central District Health Department Community Health Survey and focus group meetings.

A request for assistance may be made by the patient or a family member, close friend, or associate of the patient, subject to applicable privacy laws. In addition, Hospital registration clerks are trained to provide consultation to those who have no insurance or potentially inadequate insurance concerning their financial options including application for Medicaid and for assistance under the Financial Assistance Policy. Counselors assist Medicare eligible patients in enrollment by providing referrals to the appropriate government agencies. Once it is determined that the patient does not qualify for any third party funding, the patient is verbally notified about the existence of Financial Assistance Application and additional screening takes place by a Hospital employee to determine if the patient is eligible for charity service prior to discharge. Upon registration (and once all EMTALA requirements are met), patients who are identified as uninsured (and not covered by Medicare or Medicaid) are provided with a packet of information that addresses the Financial Assistance Policy, the plain language summary of that policy, and an application for assistance. Hospital registration clerks read the organization's medical assistance policy to those who appear to be incapable of reading, and provide translators for non-English-speaking individuals. Patients that have been discharged prior to charity screening, such as emergency room patients, receive a written notification of possible eligibility for services. If the patient is determined not to be eligible for government assistance, he/she may notify the hospital that they seek charity assistance. The appropriate charity form is sent to the patient/guarantor for completion and then returned to the hospital for evaluation and qualification. Once determination of eligibility is made, the patient is sent a notice informing him/her if they qualify for full, partial, or no charity care services.

The organizations financial assistance policy (""fap"") exists to offer financial assistance for medically necessary care to both uninsured and under-insured individuals based upon their ability to pay. The granting of financial assistance will not take into account age, gender, race, social status, sexual orientation or religious affiliation. Patients seeking emergency care shall be treated without regard to ability to pay for such care. As reflected in schedule h, part v, section b, question 13, in addition to federal poverty guidelines (""fpg"") AMH uses the following criteria when determining a patients eligibility for free or discounted financial assistance: - asset level; - medical indigency; - insurance status; - underinsurance status; and - residency. In accordance with the organizations fap, a patient may qualify for discounts on medical care if there is no health insurance available, or has health insurance, but that insurance does not fully cover the medical care needed, such as exhausted benefits, and all of the following apply: - the patient is not eligible for state medical assistance or other available assistance programs; - the patient meets the criteria for financial assistance described in this policy, and - the patient provides the necessary documents and completes necessary paperwork. Eligibility for financial assistance is based upon financial need. Patients that fall below 299% of the fpl, based on total household income, with sufficient supporting documentation provided, will receive a 100% discount. Patients at 300% or above, up to a maximum of 600% of the fpl, are eligible for financial assistance based upon a sliding scale discount. These discounts are applied against the medicare fee-for-service rates in place at time of determination. Eligibility for financial assistance is also determined by the patients or guarantors ability to pay after all insurance has been utilized or liquid resources exhausted (excluding retirement funds). AMH will not consider the patients house, car, retirement accounts, and other ""non-liquid"" assets. However, it is recognized that there is a small percent of the uninsured patient population that has substantial assets and could easily afford to pay for healthcare services, but whom, because of having tax-exempt income, will not have income reflected on a tax return. Such individuals may not qualify for financial assistance. For uninsured patients, there is an automatic initial discount which shall equate to 50% off total charges for services rendered. In addition, for emergency department and observation services for those treated and released (not admitted as inpatient) there will be a maximum liability of $1,600. For laboratory services, there is a further discount that is generally greater than 50% off charges. A patient unable to pay the uninsured rate is eligible to apply for financial assistance."

The system's allowance for doubtful accounts (bad debt expense) methodology and financial assistance policies are consistently applied across all hospital affiliates. The attached text was obtained from the footnotes to the audited consolidated financial statements of the organization and its affiliates. Charitable medical care provided Tju provides medically necessary services to all patients regardless of their ability to pay. Some patients qualify for charity care based on policies established by tju and are therefore not responsible for payment for all or a part of their healthcare services. These policies allow for the provision of free or discounted care in circumstances where requiring payment would impose financial hardship on the patient. Charges for services rendered to patients who meet tjus guidelines for charity care are not separately recorded in the accompanying consolidated financial statements. Tju maintains records to identify and monitor the level of charity care provided. These records include the amount of charges foregone for services and supplies furnished. Such amounts have been excluded from net patient service revenue. Management estimates that the cost of charity care provided by tju was $36.9 million and $28.6 million for the years ended june 30, 2018 and 2017, respectively. These amounts are not included in the provision for bad debts of $132.8 million and $124.8 million in 2018 and 2017, respectively, which are reflected as deductions in net patient service revenue. The estimated costs of providing charity services are based on a calculation which applies a ratio of costs to charges to the gross uncompensated charges associated with providing care to charity patients. The ratio of cost to charges is calculated based on the tju total expenses divided by gross patient service revenue. Net patient service revenue Net patient service revenue is reported at the estimated net realizable amounts from patients, third-party payers and others for services rendered, including estimated retroactive adjustments under reimbursement agreements with third-party payers. Retroactive adjustments are considered in the recognition of revenue on an estimated basis in the period the related services are rendered and are adjusted in future periods as final settlements are determined. Revenue from the medicare and medicaid fee-for-service programs accounted for approximately 33.3% and 8.8%, respectively, and 34.4% and 6.5%, respectively of net patient service revenue in 2018 and 2017, respectively. Most payments to tju from the medicare and pennsylvania medicaid programs for inpatient hospital services are made on a prospective basis. Under these programs, payments are made at a pre-determined specific rate for each discharge based on a patients diagnosis. Additional payments are made to tju teaching and disproportionate share hospitals, as well as for cases that have unusually high costs. Laws governing the medicare and medicaid programs are complex and subject to interpretation. Services billed to the medicare program are subject to external review for both medical necessity and billing compliance. Medicare cost reports for all years, except 2011, 2015, 2016, 2017 and 2018 have been audited and final settled as of june 30, 2018. No significant adjustments are expected.

201941359349307069,231352152,"SCHEDULE H, PART III, SECTION B; LINE 8","Financial information listed on schedule h part iii lines 5, 6 & 7 were derived from the hospital's cost accounting system and not the 2017 filed Medicare cost report. Using the cost report would result in a decrease to the amount on line 5 of $14,571,751 and a decrease to line 6 of $21,127,010. Medicare underpayments and bad debt are community benefit and associated costs are includable on the form 990, schedule h, part i. The organization believes that medicare underpayments (shortfall) and bad debt are community benefit and associated costs are includable on the form 990, schedule h, part i. As outlined more fully below the organization believes that these services and related costs promote the health of the community as a whole and are rendered in conjunction with the organization's charitable tax-exempt purposes and mission in providing medically necessary healthcare services to all individuals in a non-discriminatory manner without regard to race, color, national origin, gender, gender identity or expression, sexual orientation, age, status as an individual with a handicap/disability or ability to pay and consistent with the community benefit standard promulgated by the irs. The community benefit standard is the current standard for a hospital for recognition as a tax-exempt and charitable organization under internal revenue code (""irc"") 501(c)(3). The organization is recognized as a tax-exempt entity and charitable organization under 501(c)(3) of the irc. Although there is no definition in the tax code for the term ""charitable"" a regulation promulgated by the department of the treasury provides some guidance and states that ""the term charitable is used in section 501(c)(3) in its generally accepted legal sense,provides examples of charitable purposes, including the relief of the poor or unprivileged; the promotion of social welfare; and the advancement of education, religion, and science. Note it does not explicitly address the activities of hospitals. In the absence of explicit statutory or regulatory requirements applying the term ""charitable"" to hospitals, it has been left to the irs to determine the criteria hospitals must meet to qualify as irc 501(c)(3) charitable organizations. The original standard was known as the charity care standard. This standard was replaced by the irs with the community benefit standard which is the current standard. Charity care standard In 1956, the irs issued revenue ruling 56-185, which addressed the requirements hospitals needed to meet in order to qualify for irc 501(c)(3) status. One of these requirements is known as the ""charity care standard."" under the standard, a hospital had to provide, to the extent of its financial ability, free or reduced-cost care to patients unable to pay for it. A hospital that expected full payment did not, according to the ruling, provide charity care based on the fact that some patients ultimately failed to pay. The ruling emphasized that a low level of charity care did not necessarily mean that a hospital had failed to meet the requirement since that level could reflect its financial ability to provide such care. The ruling also noted that publicly supported community hospitals would normally qualify as charitable organizations because they serve the entire community and a low level of charity care would not affect a hospital's exempt status if it was due to the surrounding community's lack of charitable demands. Community benefit standard In 1969, the irs issued revenue ruling 69-545, which ""remove(d)"" from revenue ruling 56-185 ""the requirements relating to caring for patients without charge or at rates below cost."" under the standard developed in revenue ruling 69-545, which is known as the ""community benefit standard,"" hospitals are judged on whether they promote the health of a broad class of individuals in the community. The ruling involved a hospital that only admitted individuals who could pay for the services (by themselves, private insurance, or public programs such as medicare), but operated a full-time emergency room that was open to everyone. The irs ruled that the hospital qualified as a charitable organization because it promoted the health of people in its community. The irs reasoned that because the promotion of health was a charitable purpose according to the general law of charity, it fell within the ""generally accepted legal sense"" of the term ""charitable,"" as required by treas. Reg. 1.501(c)(3)-1(d)(2). The irs ruling stated that the promotion of health, like the relief of poverty and the advancement of education and religion, is one of the purposes in the general law of charity that is deemed beneficial to the community as a whole even though the class of beneficiaries eligible to receive a direct benefit from its activities does not include all members of the community, such as indigent members of the community, provided that the class is not so small that its relief is not of benefit to the community. The irs concluded that the hospital was ""promoting the health of a class of persons that is broad enough to benefit the community"" because its emergency room was open to all and it provided care to everyone who could pay, whether directly or through third-party reimbursement. Other characteristics of the hospital that the irs highlighted included the following: its surplus funds were used to improve patient care, expand hospital facilities, and advance medical training, education, and research; it was controlled by a board of trustees that consisted of independent civic leaders; and hospital medical staff privileges were available to all qualified physicians. The american hospital association (""aha"") believes that medicare underpayments (shortfall) and bad debt are community benefit and thus includable on the form 990, schedule h, part i. This organization agrees with the aha position. As outlined in the aha letter to the irs dated august 21, 2007 with respect to the first published draft of the new form 990 and schedule h, the aha felt that the irs should incorporate the full value of the community benefit that hospitals provide by counting medicare underpayments (shortfall) as quantifiable community benefit for the following reasons: - providing care for the elderly and serving medicare patients is an essential part of the community benefit standard. - medicare, like medicaid, does not pay the full cost of care. Recently, medicare reimburses hospitals only 92 cents for every dollar they spend to take care of medicare patients. The medicare payment advisory commission (""medpac"") in its march 2007 report to congress cautioned that underpayment will get even worse, with margins reaching a 10-year low at negative 5.4 percent. - many medicare beneficiaries, like their medicaid counterparts, are poor. More than 46 percent of medicare spending is for beneficiaries whose income is below 200 percent of the federal poverty level. Many of those medicare beneficiaries are also eligible for medicaid -- so called eligibles."" There is every compelling public policy reason to treat medicare and medicaid underpayments similarly for purposes of a hospital's community benefit and include these costs on form 990, schedule h, part i. Medicare underpayment must be shouldered by the hospital in order to continue treating the community's elderly and poor. These underpayments represent a real cost of serving the community and should count as a quantifiable community benefit. Both the aha and this organization also feel that patient bad debt is a community benefit and thus includable on the form 990, schedule h, part i. Like medicare underpayment (shortfalls), there also are compelling reasons that patient bad debt should be counted as quantifiable community benefit as follows: - a significant majority of bad debt is attributable to low-income patients, who, for many reasons, decline to complete the forms required to establish eligibility for hospitals' charity care or financial assistance programs. A 2006 congressional budget office (""cbo"") report, nonprofit hospitals and the provision of community benefits, cited two studies indicating that ""the great majority of bad debt was attributable to patients with incomes below 200% of the federal poverty line."" - the report also noted that a substantial portion of bad debt is pending charity care. Unlike bad debt in other industries, hospital bad debt is complicated by the fact that hospitals follow their mission to the community and treat every patient that comes through their emergency department, regardless of ability to pay. Patients who have outstanding bills are not turned away, unlike other industries. Bad debt is further complicated by the auditing industry's standards on reporting charity care. Many patients cannot or do not provide the necessary, extensive documentation required to be deemed charity care by auditors. As a result, roughly 40% of bad debt is pending charity care. - the cbo c"
201941359349307069,231352152,"SCHEDULE H, PART III, SECTION C; QUESTION 9B","AMH provides inpatient, outpatient, and emergency services without regard to a patient's ability to pay. To fulfill its mission of providing compassionate, high quality care to all patients it serves, AMH must also ensure its own financial viability. In order to secure reimbursement of costs for services provided, every effort is made to assist patients in obtaining insurance coverage through medical assistance (ma), children's health insurance program (chip) or other federal, state, or city care coverage sources. AMH provides financial assistance to those patients who are unable to pay based upon the eligibility criteria included in their financial assistance policy. Billing & collection efforts ---------------------------- While qualification for financial assistance is ideally determined prior to, or at the time of service, AMH continues to review such determinations as other financial resources are discovered during the billing and collection process. After an uninsured or under-insured patient's account is reduced to the uninsured discount or the financial assistance discount rate, whichever is applicable, the patient is responsible for the remainder of any outstanding patient balances. Patients will receive an initial statement indicating their balance due along with information regarding the availability of financial assistance and who to contact. Self-pay balances go through a pre-collection agency placement process that may entail the mailing of statements or letters and/or phone calls in order to collect payment on open balances. Once open balance accounts complete the pre-collection dunning cycle, (120 days or more) with no payment or proof of eligibility for financial assistance or other programs, the accounts will be transferred to a professional collection agency. If a financial assistance application and appropriate supporting documents have been submitted and a decision is pending, the account will be held from agency placement. In some cases, a patient eligible for financial assistance may not have been identified prior to sending the account to an external collection agency. Each agency will be made aware of the financial assistance policy and will work with the provider to ascertain patient eligibility. Extraordinary collection actions (""ecas"") will not be undertaken during the initial notification period of the 120 days from the first post-discharge billing statement and until such time as a 30 day initiation of eca notice has been sent to the individual. The 30 day eca initiation notice will contain the eca action that the provider intends to undertake and the date at which time this would occur. A copy of the organizations plain language summary will accompany the 30 day eca initiation notice. If the patient submits a financial assistance application, AMH will suspend any ecas until the patients financial assistance eligibility is determined and the patient is informed of their eligibility. If a patient account is referred to an outside agency, that agency must first agree to abide by AMHs financial assistance policy in relation to its collection efforts. No external collection agency are permitted to engage in ecas unless authorized by AMH. After the above-described steps have been taken, AMH may use ecas with the respect to the patient account of an uninsured or under-insured and may further consider credit bureau reporting and/or legal action as appropriate. AMHs general counsel is required to all lawsuits prior to the eca commencing. Final authority for determining that AMH has made adequate attempts to inform a patient of the financial assistance policy, and thus may initiate the use ecas, rests with the organizations vice president director of revenue cycle operations."

The collaborative process for ah including abington memorial hospital and lansdale hospital corporation began in may 2015 when ah leaders reached out to our new jefferson colleagues at the center for urban health to begin a dialogue for the 2016 chna process. The enterprise team was formed with meetings, conference calls and discussions immediately following. Together a new chna model was created and together we agreed to continue with public health management corporation (""phmc"") household health survey for data and quantitative information. Numerous secondary data and literature sources, and internal experts and external representatives of healthcare and community based organizations who have knowledge of health and social conditions of these communities were represented in key interviews and small group meetings during the chna process. The community health needs assessment provides a definition of the community, the demographic and socioeconomic characteristics of the residents, and the existing healthcare resources. Immediately following were the needs assessments process and methods; findings; identification of unmet needs and asset mapping. Quantitative information from the u.s. census, pennsylvania department of health vital statistics and phmc's southeastern pa household health survey was analyzed for the hospital's service area using the statistical program for social sciences (""spss""). The unmet healthcare needs for this service area were identified and prioritized by comparing the health status, access to care, health behaviors, and utilization of services for residents of the service area to results for the county and state and the healthy people 2020 goals for the nation. In addition, for household health survey measures, tests of significance were conducted to identify and prioritize. This organization conducts a review of key factor information annually which includes: a review of healthcare utilization of its service area population by services (urology, cardiology, obstetrics, etc.) For determining increased or decreased health needs; healthcare service estimates and forecasts (both inpatient and outpatient); assessments of local demographic and socioeconomic information; and, a review of health status/needs assessments and studies conducted by external parties including phmc household health survey data; healthy people 2020; pa department of health, bureau of health statistics and research; behavioral risks of pa adults; minority health disparities in pennsylvania; death rates in pa, montgomery county and southeastern pennsylvania; county health rankings; national organization websites, i.e., american diabetes association, american heart association and american stroke association. Using the quantitative and qualitative data presented in the chna and a prioritization process, ah identified the most important priority health needs for the population of AMH'S community benefit areas which include: mental health services; social and healthcare needs of the older adults; obesity; alcohol/substance abuse; womens cancer; chronic disease management (diabetes, heart disease and hypertension, stroke, asthma); health education, social services and regular source of care.

AMH continues to attend local and regional community organization meetings and county collaboratives for the greater abington area. Regional county collaboratives include the healthcare system with representation from local politicians, local community health centers, emergency health providers and other community health leaders. AMH worked with area hospitals and non-profits to form the montgomery county health alliance which received pa state designation of ship status (state health improvement plan). In addition, during the chna process, abington health joined coach and the montgomery county hospital partnership WHICH FOCUSED ON FOOD INSECURITY, FUTURE CHNA AND MENTAL HEALTH."

The guiding principles behind this policy are to treat all patients equally, with dignity and respect, to serve the emergency healthcare needs of everyone in the community, to assist patients who cannot pay and to balance appropriate financial assistance for patients with fiscal responsibility.

201911349349302701,232825878,"Part II, Community Building Activities:","Temple University Hospital engages in numerous community building activities throughout the year. These are activities, separate from our ""community health improvement"" activities that advance the health or safety of the neighborhoods we serve.COMMUNITY SUPPORT:(1) Violence Prevention and Intervention. Under the leadership of our Department of Surgery, our Trauma Unit conducts a number of programs that address the financial, emotional and social costs of gun violence in Philadelphia. Our ""Cradle to Grave"" program is a collaborative program with the Juvenile Justice Department and local schools that works with at-risk youth to break the cycle of gun violence. Last year, we reached more than 950 youth. ""Fighting Chance"" teaches residents in high violence neighborhoods to administer first aid to gunshot victims until first responders arrive. ""Safe Bet"" provides gun locks to families to reduce accidental shootings. ""Turning Point,"" with a focus on survivors, helps change attitudes toward gun violence and encourages victims to alter their paths.(2) Emergency Preparedness and Research. This program helps ensure that our staff and hospital facilities are prepared to continue to provide safe, quality patient care under the most austere conditions. This Program is a critical link in federal, state and local disaster response plans. Our Emergency Preparedness Department is involved in three local committees, including the North Philadelphia Emergency Healthcare Support Zone, the Regional Hospital Subcommittee; and the Emergency Support Function-8 Work Group. These committees are focused on creation of drills, policy development, and continuing education.(3) Safe-T Program. In addition to the personal education about newborn care and safety, all mothers that deliver at TUH receive a Safe Sleeper kit complete with a sleep-safe baby box, layette items such as fleece and cotton clothing, sheets and blanket, a baby book (provided in English and Spanish), diapers, thermometer, nasal aspirator, baby wash, smoke detectors (provided by the Philadelphia Fire Department) and educational materials and resource referrals. Last year 4,930 moms and babies participated. This program has also been found to reduce co-sleeping by 25% - a dangerous practice in which parents and babies share the same bed.(4) Philadelphia MOM. Temple University Hospital assists the Philadelphia Department of Health in providing early interventions for healthy newborns. After identification at Temple University Hospital, city social workers make home visitations through the child's 6th birthday to ensure they have access to healthcare and educational resources.(5) Prenatal Education: All expectant mothers at Temple University Hospital receive counseling on pre-natal nutrition and other topics to promote healthy pregnancy. We provide free childbirth classes covering labor and delivery techniques, breastfeeding basics, postnatal recovery and newborn needs. Our free yoga classes also help expectant mothers with stress reduction, fitness, breathing and overall wellness.(6) Blood Drives. Temple University Hospital works closely with the American Red Cross to support its mission of providing a safe and reliable blood supply that helps ensure quality outcomes and save lives. This year, Temple helped collect 447 pints of blood from employees and physicians.(7) Mental Health Training. Our staff members provide several hours of free training annually to community-based providers and non-profit organizations on topics such as patient safety and crisis response.(8) At Your Service. Temple University Hospital's volunteer intern program connected undergraduate students who engage in proactive non-clinical rounding on inpatient and outpatient units and interact with patients and families. Volunteer interns gain familiarity with hospital settings while enhancing the experience of patients and visitors. Total volunteer hours logged last year was 15,431 serving 74,951 patients.(9) Temple Center for Population Health (TCPH). Serves as an interface with federal, state and local agencies and with community based organizations to collaborate on initiatives to improve the health of our low-income, diverse, medically complex population. This program served 1,950 community members last year. TCPH's ""Temple Care Transitions"" program also employs Community Health Workers and Nurse Navigators to identify patients with complex social and medical health issues through intakes conducted in the hospital, community and by telephone. They also assist with scheduling appointments, coordinating transportation, obtaining home support, and educating patients on how they can manage health issues and avoid future hospitalization.(10) Southeast Pennsylvania Collaborative Opportunities to Advance Community Health (COACH) initiative. In partnership with the U.S. Department of Health & Human Services, Philadelphia Department of Health and the Healthcare Improvement Foundation, Temple helps address food insecurity. In selected clinical settings, a member of our hospital staff asks patients about their access to sufficient food. If a patient indicates food insecurity, we refer the patient to community resources for SNAP food assistance, food banks and other needs.(11) Employee Community Engagement. Temple University Hospital conducts numerous engagement activities throughout the year, including collections for new coats and clothing, holiday gifts, food, and school supplies to benefit low income families living in our communities. We are particularly proud of the support that we provide to local public schools, where many families have limited resources to purchase warm weather clothing and school supplies for young children. (12) Temple University Hospital partners with Temple University's Lewis Katz School of Medicine ""Block by Block and other programs to establishes partnerships with surrounding communities to improve research and community health. (13) Support Groups: Temple University Hospital's Episcopal Campus is home to free support groups for patients and family members affected by mental health issues, as well as those fighting addiction. Our Caregivers Group also provides education and support to transplant patients and their caregivers and families post-transplant.(14) Addressing Philadelphia's Opioid Epidemic. Temple Health is working closely with the Commonwealth of Pennsylvania and City of Philadelphia Department of Behavioral Health and Disability Services' (DBHIDS) Office of Addiction Services (OAS) to address Philadelphia's opioid epidemic. Temple University Hospital's Episcopal Campus is located at the epicenter of the our State's opioid crisis and has the highest number of opioid related deaths in Philadelphia. With support from the Commonwealth, we are expanding medication-assisted treatment programs to several community-based sites throughout Philadelphia using multidisciplinary care teams and social supports. With Temple's Department of Family Medicine's TRUST Clinic (Temple Recovery Using Scientific Treatment) central to this ""hub-and-spoke"" model, we are coordinating services among our emergency departments, local health centers, physician offices and outreach organizations. Additionally, in partnership with the City, our ""Recovery Overdose Survivor Project"" employs certified peer recovery specialists that help link overdose patients and their families with needed services and provide follow-up 48 hours after treatment in our Emergency Department or Crisis Response Center. We are also working with Philadelphia's Office of Homeless Services to establish a 40-bed respite center to address homelessness among opioid users. (15) Support for Early Learning.

The purpose of this program is to build local workforce and improve skills sets needed to deliver quality healthcare. This involves comprehensive training and education to help workers living in our community adapt and improve skills to enable them to participate in a changing healthcare workplace. About half the students are union members and half from the general community, including laid-off workers and those receiving public assistance. Career pathways include nursing, behavioral health, allied health, childcare, and health IT. Education services include GED classes and testing as well as ESL and safety instruction.(2)Community Health Worker Program. In partnership with Temple University's Center for Social Policy, District Council 1199C Training and Upgrade Fund and Philadelphia Workforce Development Corporation, this program trains unemployed members of our community to become Community Health Workers. Through this program, we are helping residents develop valuable job skills while also achieving national goals of improving healthcare quality, outcomes and cost.Part III, Line 2:Bad debt expense is calculated based on the product of monthly gross charges and a rolling six month average of the ratio of bad debt transfers to gross charges. This ratio is derived by dividing the cumulative bad debt transfers with discharge dates between 12 to 18 months prior to each closing month by the corresponding gross charges in the same 12 to 18 month period."

If no patient response is received, a write-off request form will be completed by the collection specialist and submitted for proper signature authority for agency referral. Once approved, the account will be transferred to the Bad Debt Financial Class. The account will be forwarded to the collection agency for additional collection effort. Collection vendors are required to include in their collection notifications notice that TUH provides free and/or reduced price care to persons who qualify, that TUH provides assistance in applying for and obtaining government funded insurance, and that patients can contact TUH's Financial Services Department for assistance."

PFACs connected with six separate practice locations in our community and the PFAC of the Temple University Hospital Hearth and Vascular Institute. These groups are organized under Temple University Hospital's Department of Patient Experience.*In addition to data sources, we also work closely with local government offices and not-for-profit community-based health and social services organizations and actively participate in local, regional and state level workgroups to address specific needs of vulnerable populations.As the primary safety net hospital serving Philadelphia and its surrounding counties, Temple University Hospital maintains strong relationships with area community Health Centers, including the City of Philadelphia Department of Human Services, its Health Centers and many Federally Qualified Health Centers (FQHCs). These partnerships enable Temple University Hospital to coordinate care delivery in both the inpatient and outpatient settings. In Women's Health Temple University Hospital collaborates with three FQHCs, Esperanza Community Health Center, Maria de los Santos Health Center, and Greater Philadelphia Health Action to provide Obstetrical Care. Through this partnership community physicians are integrated with the Temple faculty and community practices to provide a full range of obstetrical services for their patients. In addition, TUH participates with the City of Philadelphia MOM Program. This early intervention program consists of frequent phone calls and home visits to encourage mothers to have their babies immunized on schedule and to participate in needed developmental and educational services. The program seeks to fill the gap between children's need for services and mothers' ability to assure their children's participation in those services.Temple University Hospital also works closely with our community partners to provide adult health services. The Public Health Management Corporation operates a clinic adjacent to the TUH Emergency Department. The physicians of Esperanza Community Health Center maintain staff privileges and provide continuity of care for their patients at TUH. The group participates in the Temple University Internal Medicine Residency Programs. Maria de los Santos Health Center and Greater Philadelphia Health Action provide outpatient services and refer patients to TUH for inpatient care.TUH also maintains a close relationship with City of Philadelphia Health Department, its District Health Centers and the Police and Fire Departments. TUH works closely with the city to provide for aftercare following hospitalization and often expedites needed specialty care and diagnostic evaluations.Representatives of Temple University Hospital serve on several health-and safety related boards and committees of the City of Philadelphia, including the Health Department, the Mayor's Task Force to Combat the Opioid Epidemic, the Philadelphia Task Force on Sports-Based Youth Development and the Fire Commissioner's Medical Advisory Board."

These zip codes represent about 70% of where our patients reside seen on an inpatient and observation basis. Our service area's population has a disproportionally high percentage of non-college educated residents living in poverty compared to the City, State, and Nation.Our immediate service area is also reflected in the City of Philadelphia's 2017 Community Health Assessment, and is represented mainly by the City's North, Lower North and Riverward Planning Districts. These planning districts have the lowest life expectancy, poorest health and highest incidents of death before age 75, smoking-attributable mortality rate, level of obesity, cardiovascular disease, HIV diagnosis, cancer-related mortality rate, number of rat complaints and highest homicide rate opioid-related mortality rate and number of adults diagnosed with a mental health condition in the City.A.

201911349349302701,232825878,"Part VI, Line 5:","In addition to the Community Building activities described in Part II above, Temple University hospital organized or participated as a key partner in a number of community health improvement activities. These activities are free to the community, subsidized by Temple University Hospital, do not generate a patient bill, and are carried out for the sole purpose of improving community health.TUH is an indispensable provider of health care in the largest city in America without a public hospital. Among Pennsylvania's full-service safety-net providers, Temple University Hospital serves the greatest volume and highest percentage of patients covered by Medicaid. About 85% of our inpatients are covered by government programs: 40% by Medicare and 45% by Medicaid. Temple University Hospital is located in a medically underserved area. During our FYE June 30, 2018, Temple University Hospital engaged in over 400 programs and events serving more than 45,000 community members. Below are selected highlights.(1) Community Health Fairs. Temple University Hospital participated in numerous health fairs serving our immediate community to build trust and break down barriers to care. We often collaborate with Temple University's Schools of Medicine, Public Health, Dentistry, and Pharmacy to provide health screenings and education on a variety of health issues affecting residents, including diabetes, obesity, cancer, depression, anxiety, addiction, and PTSD. This year we served over 4,500 residents at local community health fairs.(2) Temple Health Force. Health professionals from across Temple University Hospital's departments engaged in numerous outreach activities with government offices and community-based organizations. These include free health screenings and education on cancer, behavioral health, substance abuse, burn prevention, childbirth education and yoga instruction for expecting moms, diabetes care, smoking cessation, LGBTQ health, stroke prevention and other topics.(3) Social Supports. Our Social workers connected more than 29,000 people with community-based social services, including free transportation, legal services, clothing, pharmaceuticals, co-pays and medical supplies. We provide these supports for our vulnerable patient population to ease their transition to home after discharge or outpatient treatment.(4) Behavioral Health Community Education. Our physicians and staff provide community-based education on seeking help for depression, suicidal behavior and other mental health issues. We are proud to partner with the community organization, ""Michael's Giving H.A.N.D."" (Handling Anxiety Navigating Depression), which engages teenagers at area high schools.In addition to the above, Temple University Hospital offers a number of culturally competent services to augment our ability to provide access to high quality care and improve outcomes for our patients and their caregivers. Below are selected highlights.(1) Financial Services. Temple employs 34 Financial Counselors dedicated to helping uninsured and under-insured patients obtain medical coverage as well as providing assistance with out of pocket medical expense. Our team of knowledgeable and caring professionals help patients understand their insurance coverage, limitation and out of pocket obligations. They assist patients and their families by answering their questions regarding the cost of healthcare services, providing information and guidance in comparing health plans, and enrolling them in government funded insurance plans such as Medicaid, Medicare and ACA Marketplace plans. All of our counselors are CMS Certified Application Counselors. In addition, they assist patients in applying for Temple hospitals' Charity Care and Sliding-Scale Financial Assistance program and setting up payment plans. The financial counselors also assist patients in qualifying for patient assistance programs to cover most of the out of pocket costs for expensive medications. Last year we assisted countless patients and processed over 5,000 applications for coverage.(2) Linguistic and Cultural Services. Our nearly 400 language proficient bilingual staff, who we train and credential, performed thousands of interpretations this year. This unique program, known for its excellence, is one of many resources we provide to non-English speaking patients and families. We also assist other area hospitals that call on us to adapt our linguistic services module to their patient populations.(3) Patient Family Advisory Councils (PFACS). Under the leadership of Temple University Hospital's Office of Patient Experience, we continued the six (6) Temple Physicians Inc. (TPI) and one (1) Temple Heart and Vascular Institute (THVI) PFACs established last year. We also created a new Temple Trauma Unit Injury PFAC, for a new total of eight (8) PFACs. The goal of these committees is to engage and encourage the participation of patients, their families, and members of the community in evaluating patient satisfaction. Our PFACs are currently setting priorities as well as developing recommendations for improving Temple University Hospital's services, programs, communications and policies to better meet the needs of patients and families with the full support of Temple Health leadership."

Part III, Line 3 RATIONALE FOR INCLUDING BAD DEBT AMOUNTS IN COMMUNITY BENEFIT The organization's bad debt expense consists solely of self-pay patients accounts deemed uncollectable. It is UPMC Jameson's contention that the cost of bad debt should be stated in Part I Line 7 of Schedule H as they represent the costs for provision of services to patients for which the entity has exhausted all recourse for reimbursement. The services provided to patients who present themselves are provided regardless of a patient's ability to pay AND IS IN line with the organization's charitable mission and service to our community. These expenses are incurred regardless of the efficiency of the provision of the related medical care and are deemed to have been medically necessary for the patient. PROCESS FOR REALLOCATION FROM BAD DEBT TO CHARITY CARE UPMC RECLASSIFIES BAD DEBT ACCOUNTS AS CHARITY CARE BY UTILIZING A PREDICTIVE MODEL CALLED PARO (PAYMENT ASSISTANCE RANK ORDER). PARO WAS BUILT AS A SOCIO-ECONOMIC SCORE THAT IDENTIFIES THOSE PATIENTS THAT ARE MOST LIKELY TO BE THE HIGHEST NEED OF FINANCIAL ASSISTANCE. THIS IS ACCOMPLISHED BY ANALYZING CONSUMER DATA AND ACTIVITY, COURT RECORDS, GOVERNMENT RECORDS, PROPERTY FILES, CENSUS DATA AND IRS DATA. PARO PROVIDES A SYSTEMATIC APPROACH TO FINANCIAL ASSISTANCE: "" PREDICTIVE MODEL THAT ENCOMPASSES HEALTHCARE ECONOMICS AND CREDIT POLICIES;"" UNIFORM ASSESSMENT MEASURE FOR EVERY PATIENT REGARDLESS OF FINANCIAL STANDING; "" ACCOUNTS FOR PATIENTS THAT ARE UNRESPONSIVE, ILLITERATE, OR OTHERWISE CHALLENGED TO APPLY; "" ELIMINATES BARRIER TO APPLICATION AND MEETS INCREASED PRESSURE TO PROVIDE ADDITIONAL FINANCIAL RESOURCES TO CONSUMERS; "" IDENTIFY AND SUPPORT THOSE COMMUNITY NEEDS EFFORTS TO PROVIDE ASSISTANCE TO THOSE CONSUMERS IN NEED."" THERE ARE TWO DATA POINTS RETURNED TO UPMC IN ORDER TO MAKE THE DECISION WHETHER THE PATIENT WOULD QUALIFY FOR CHARITY CARE. THE FIRST IS THE ESTIMATED INCOME LEVEL BASED ON THE FEDERAL POVERTY LEVEL GUIDELINES. THE SECOND IS THE PARO SCORE WHICH UTILIZES AN ALGORITHM BASED APPROACH AND RETURNS A SCORE BASED ON PERSONAL ATTRIBUTES OF THE PATIENT. DATA ELEMENTS WERE COMBINED TO CREATE TWO PRIMARY INDICATORS OF NEED, THE PARO SCORE AND THE FEDERAL POVERTY LEVEL. PARO ANALYZED OUR HISTORICAL CHARITY CARE APPROVALS TO DETERMINE OUR PARO THRESHOLD AND THE FPL THRESHOLD FOR THE HISTORICAL APPROVALS. THE APPROVED CHARITY CARE ACCOUNTS WERE COMPARED AGAINST ACCOUNTS THAT WERE IN ACTIVE ACCOUNTS RECEIVABLE. THIS WAS DONE TO DETERMINE IF THE DISTRIBUTIONS WERE SIMILAR OR IF ANY PATTERN EXISTED BASED ON THE APPROVED ACCOUNTS AND THE UNKNOWN ACCOUNTS. IF THE PATIENT'S ESTIMATED INCOME AND PARO SCORE ARE WITHIN THE SCORES IDENTIFIED BY THE CALIBRATION OF UPMC EXISTING CHARITY CARE PATIENTS, THE ACCOUNT IS RECLASSIFIED FROM BAD DEBT TO CHARITY CARE. EVERY PATIENT IS ABLE TO APPLY FOR CHARITY CARE; HOWEVER, THE AUTOMATED STRATEGY FOCUSES ON PATIENTS THAT DO NOT COMPLETE THE APPLICATIONS PROCESS. THE US DEPARTMENT OF EDUCATION ESTIMATES THAT 1 IN 5 CONSUMERS ARE FUNCTIONALLYILLITERATE. THIS, COUPLED WITH THE LOW LEVELS OF PARTICIPATION IN TRADITIONAL BANKING METHODS, MAKES THE APPLICATION PROCESS VIRTUALLY IMPOSSIBLE FOR SOME CONSUMERS.

The method is in line with those described in Schedule H, Worksheet 2, ""Ratio of Patient Costs to Charges"". It is UPMC Jameson's contention that all amounts calculated to be shortfalls in reimbursement for services provided to Medicare patients are truly uncompensated care that should be stated in Part I Line 7 of Schedule H of Form 990 as they represent costs for provision of services to patients for which the entity is unable to collect, regardless of the efficiency of provision of the related care costs. Part III, Line 9A and B UPMC has a debt collection policy outlining collection practices for patients. If at any time the patient expresses an inability to pay, they are sent a Financial Assistance application. Information regarding Financial Assistance is printed on all collection letters.

When a patient 65+ comes to our Emergency Department, they are not just treated for the ailment that brought them to the hospital. A multi disciplinary team also performs a special assessment to guage the patient's status and whether they may have medication issues, be a fall risk or suffer from ailments like dementia and depression.

Founded by the Sisters of Mercy in 1893, Mercy is Des Moines' longest continually operating hospital and one of the largest employers in the state, with more than 6,600 employees and a medical staff of more than 950 physicians and allied health professionals. As the first Catholic hospital to serve the community, Mercy embraced the mission of the founding religious congregation, which has since joined with other religious congregations to form Catholic Health Initiatives. CHI serves as the parent corporation of its MBOs which are comprised of 101 hospitals, including four academic medical centers, and 30 critical access facilities; community health service organizations; accredited nursing colleges; home health agencies; and other facilities that span the inpatient and outpatient continuum of care. Together, these facilities provided $1.14 billion in charity care and community benefit in the 2018 fiscal year, including services for the poor, free clinics, education and research. Financial assistance and community benefit totaled approximately $2.1 billion with the inclusion of the unpaid costs of Medicare. Mercy is one of the Midwest's largest referral centers, offering a variety of specialty services that are unique to Iowa and the region. In addition, a 24-hour emergency room is open to all individuals regardless of ability to pay. While a participant in Medicare and Medicaid, Mercy also deploys a robust financial assistance program for the uninsured and underserved, meeting the needs of all seeking care. Dedicated to serving our entire community, Mercy is enriched by a board of directors comprised of civic-minded leaders. Working in conjunction with this esteemed team, Mercy's leadership evaluates and dedicates resources to the promotion of a healthy community and an improvement in the lives of those we serve. One example of Mercy's commitment to unmet needs exists in the House of Mercy. Initially developed to provide safe and supportive housing for vulnerable women and their children, the House of Mercy is now one of Iowa's largest providers of transitional housing and clinical services for parenting women with addiction. The House of Mercy is dedicated to assisting pregnant, parenting/non-parenting, and adolescent/adult women in developing personal responsibility and independence through counseling, education, and medical care in collaboration with other caring individuals. It is home to 11 vital human service and health care related programs and, on average, houses nearly 170 women and children in the residential treatment program. During their stay, women gain the skills they need to live independently, deal with addiction, overcome the effects of trauma and effectively parent their children. Mercy Medical Center - Des Moines is included in the Official Catholic Directory as a tax-exempt hospital."

201941339349305744,420680448,"Schedule H, Part III, Line 4 Bad debt expense - financial statement footnote","Catholic Health Initiatives - Iowa Corp does not issue separate company audited financial statements. However, the organization is included in the consolidated financial statements of Catholic Health Initiatives. The consolidated footnote reads as follows: The provision for bad debts is based upon management's assessment of historical and expected net collections, taking into consideration historical business and economic conditions, trends in health care coverage, and other collection indicators. Management routinely assesses the adequacy of the allowances for uncollectible accounts based upon historical write-off experience by payor category. The results of these reviews are used to modify, as necessary, the provision for bad debts and to establish appropriate allowances for uncollectible net patient accounts receivable. After satisfaction of amounts due from insurance, CHI follows established guidelines for placing certain patient balances with collection agencies, subject to the terms of certain restrictions on collection efforts as determined by each facility. The provision for bad debts is presented in the consolidated statement of operations as a deduction from patient services revenues (net of contractual allowances and discounts) since CHI accepts and treats all patients without regard to the ability to pay."
201941339349305744,420680448,"Schedule H, Part III, Line 8 Community benefit & methodology for determining medicare costs","Using essentially the same Medicare cost report principles as to the allocation of general services costs and ""apportionment"" methods, the ""CHI Workbook"" calculates a payers' gross allowable costs by service (so as to facilitate a corresponding comparison between gross allowable costs and ultimate payments received). The term ""gross allowable costs"" means costs before any deductibles or co-insurance are subtracted. CHI Iowa Corp's ultimate reimbursement will be reduced by any applicable copayment/ deductible. Where Medicare is the secondary insurer, amounts due from the insured's primary payer were not subtracted from Medicare allowable costs because the amounts are typically immaterial. Although not presented on the Medicare cost report, in order to facilitate a more accurate understanding of the ""true"" cost of services (for ""shortfall"" purposes) the CHI Workbook allows a health care facility not to offset costs that Medicare considers to be non-allowable, but for which the facility can legitimately argue are related to the care of the facility's patients. In addition, although not reportable on the Medicare cost report, the CHI workbook includes the cost of services that are paid via a set fee-schedule rather than being reimbursed based on costs (e.g. outpatient clinical laboratory). Finally, the CHI Workbook allows a facility to include other health care services performed by a separate facility (such as a physician practice) that are maintained on separate books and records (as opposed to the main facility's books and records which has its costs of service included within a cost report). True costs of Medicare computed using this methodology: Total Medicare Revenue: $188,616,663 Total Medicare costs: $201,765,261 Surplus or Shortfall ($13,148,598) CHI Iowa Corp believes that excluding Medicare losses from community benefit makes the overall community benefit report more credible for these reasons: Unlike subsidized areas such as burn units or behavioral-health services, Medicare is not a differentiating feature of tax-exempt health care organizations. In fact, for-profit hospitals focus on attracting patients with Medicare coverage, especially in the case of well-paid services that include cardiac and orthopedics. Significant effort and resources are devoted to ensuring that hospitals are reimbursed appropriately by the Medicare program. The Medicare Payment Advisory Commission (MedPAC), an independent Congressional agency, carefully studies Medicare payment and the access to care that Medicare beneficiaries receive. The commission recommends payment adjustments to Congress accordingly. Though Medicare losses are not included by Catholic hospitals as community benefit, the Catholic Health Association guidelines allow hospitals to count as community benefit some programs that specifically serve the Medicare population. For instance, if hospitals operate programs for patients with Medicare benefits that respond to identified community needs, generate losses for the hospital, and meet other criteria, these programs can be included in the CHA framework in Category C as ""subsidized health services."" Medicare losses are different from Medicaid losses, which are counted in the CHA community benefit framework, because Medicaid reimbursements generally do not receive the level of attention paid to Medicare reimbursement. Medicaid payment is largely driven by what states can afford to pay, and is typically substantially less than what Medicare pays."
201941339349305744,420680448,"Schedule H, Part III, Line 9b Collection practices for patients eligible for financial assistance","The organization's billing and collections policy applies to all individuals presenting for emergency or other medically necessary care. The policy contains provisions for collecting amounts due from those patients who the organization knows to qualify for financial assistance either through the traditional financial assistance application process or through presumptive eligibility processes. Before engaging in extraordinary collection actions (ECAs) to obtain payment for EMCare, Hospital Facilities must make reasonable efforts through its billing and collections processes, pursuant to Treas. Reg. 1.501(r)-6(c), to determine whether an individual is eligible for Financial Assistance. In no event will an ECA be initiated prior to 120 days from the date the Facility provides the first post-discharge billing statement (i.e., during the Notification Period) unless all reasonable efforts have been made. Hospital Facilities will not refer accounts for collection where the patient has initially applied for Financial Assistance, and the Hospital Facility has not yet made reasonable efforts with respect to the account. For patients and Guarantors who are unable to provide required documentation, a Hospital Facility may grant Presumptive Financial Assistance based on information obtained from other resources. Patients who qualify for Medicaid are presumed to qualify for full charity write off. Any charges for days or services written off (excluding Medicaid denials related to timeliness of billing, insufficient medical record documentation, missing invoices, authorization, or eligibility issues) as a result of a Medicaid are booked as charity. Some Medicaid plans offer coverage for a limited or restricted list of services. If a patient is eligible for Medicaid, any charges for days or services not covered by the patient's coverage may be written off to charity without a completed application. This does not include any Share of Cost (SOC) or other patient cost-sharing amounts such as deductibles or copayments, as such costs are determined by the state to be an amount that the patient must pay before the patient is eligible for Medicaid. Health and Human Services (HSS) uses the term ""Spend Down"" instead of Share of Cost. All collection activities conducted by the Facility, a Designated Supplier, or its third-party collection agents will be in conformance with all federal and state laws governing debt collection practices. All third-party agreements governing collection and recovery activities must include a provision requiring compliance with the hospital facilities' financial assistance and billing and collections policy and indemnification for failures as a result of its noncompliance. This includes, but is not limited to, agreements between third parties who subsequently sell or refer debt of the Hospital Facility."

Such notices and summary information shall include a contact number and shall be provided in English, Spanish, and other primary languages spoken by the population served by an individual Hospital Facility, as applicable. Referral of patients for Financial Assistance may be made by any member of the CHI Hospital Organization non-medical or medical staff, including physicians, nurses, financial counselors, social workers, case managers, chaplains, and religious sponsors. A request for assistance may be made by the patient or a family member, close friend, or associate of the patient, subject to applicable privacy laws. In addition, Hospital registration clerks are trained to provide consultation to those who have no insurance or potentially inadequate insurance concerning their financial options including application for Medicaid and for assistance under the Financial Assistance Policy. Counselors assist Medicare eligible patients in enrollment by providing referrals to the appropriate government agencies. Once it is determined that the patient does not qualify for any third party funding, the patient is verbally notified about the existence of Financial Assistance Application and additional screening takes place by a Hospital employee to determine if the patient is eligible for charity service prior to discharge. Upon registration (and once all EMTALA requirements are met), patients who are identified as uninsured (and not covered by Medicare or Medicaid) are provided with a packet of information that addresses the Financial Assistance Policy, the plain language summary of that policy, and an application for assistance. Hospital registration clerks read the organization's medical assistance policy to those who appear to be incapable of reading, and provide translators for non-English-speaking individuals. Patients that have been discharged prior to charity screening, such as emergency room patients, receive a written notification of possible eligibility for services. If the patient is determined not to be eligible for government assistance, he/she may notify the hospital that they seek charity assistance. The appropriate charity form is sent to the patient/guarantor for completion and then returned to the hospital for evaluation and qualification. Once determination of eligibility is made, the patient is sent a notice informing him/her if they qualify for full, partial, or no charity care services. Hospital Facilities must make reasonable efforts through its billing and collections processes, pursuant to Treas. Reg. 1.501(r)-6(c), to determine whether any individual is eligible for Financial Assistance."

The narrative below reflects the activities of the organization's affiliate, CHI, as of and for the year ended 6/30/18: CHI, a nonprofit, faith-based health system formed in 1996 through the consolidation of four Catholic health systems, expresses its mission each day by creating and nurturing healthy communities in the hundreds of sites across the nation where we provide care. One of the nation's largest nonprofit health systems, Englewood, Colorado-based CHI serves as the Parent company of the system. It operates in 18 states and comprises 100 hospitals, including two academic health centers, major teaching hospitals as well as 29 critical-access facilities; community health-services organizations; accredited nursing colleges; home-health agencies; living communities; and other facilities and services that span the inpatient and outpatient continuum of care. In fiscal year 2018, CHI provided more than $1.1 billion in financial assistance and community benefit for programs and services for the poor, free clinics, education and research. Financial assistance and community benefit totaled more than $2.0 billion with the inclusion of the unpaid costs of Medicare. The health system, which generated operating revenues of $14.98 billion in fiscal year 2018, has total assets of approximately $20.6 billion. CHI provides strategic planning and management services as well as centralized ""share services"" for the MBOs. The provision of centralized management and shared services including areas such as accounting, human resources, payroll and supply chain provides economies of scale and purchasing power to the MBOs. The cost savings achieved through CHI's centralization enable MBOS to dedicate additional resources to high-quality health care and community outreach services to the most vulnerable members of our society."

These lines require use of the Medicare Cost Report as prepared by the required guidelines which disallows numerous costs of hospitals, particularly if they are part of an integrated system such as Sacred Heart Health Services. In these cases the entity must file a home office cost report which ""steps down"" overhead to non-cost report entities disproportionately to actual allowable share and essentially removing the costs from the hospital's cost report entirely. Examples of non-cost report entities operated by Sacred Heart Health Services include clinics, long-term care facilities, and other health care related businesses. There are also costs completely disallowed by cost report rules such as bad debt expense, marketing, CRNA's, and interest expense. In addition to these disallowed costs within the Hospital, Sacred Heart Health Services operates clinics, long-term care facilities, and other health care related businesses which do not file a cost report.Medicare allowable costs of care are based on the Medicare cost report. The Medicare Cost Report is completed based on the rules and regulations set forth by Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services. Sacred Heart Health Services follows the CHA guidelines in reporting community benefits and therefore any Medicare shortfall is excluded from our community benefit report. However, Medicare is the organization's largest payer and patients with Medicare coverage are accepted regardless of whether or not a surplus or deficit is realized from providing the services.

Approximately 414,000 people live in this part of Eastern Riverside County in Inland Southern California.The Coachella Valley as the community was determined by the senior leadership of the Betty Ford Center. It includes all residents in a defined geographic area surrounding the hospital and does not exclude low-income or underserved populations. The decision was based on geography and patient origin; approximately 19% of patients in 2017 live in the Coachella Valley (more than 400 patients). Specifically, the three most common hometowns of patients include Rancho Mirage (122 patients), Palm Desert (78 patients), and Indio (60 patients), all of which are within the Coachella Valley.About a quarter of residents (24.4%) are minors and another third (31.4%) can be considered seniors (ages 55 and older). In fact, 5.3% of the Coachella Valley is age 80 and over (more than 21,500 people).The percent of adults that are seniors is significantly higher in the Coachella Valley than in California as a whole. Specifically, 32% of California adults are age 55 and older, while in the Coachella Valley, approximately 42% of adults are age 55 and older.Approximately 11.9% of Coachella Valley adults identify as lesbian, gay, bisexual, or other sexual orientation. This is significantly higher than the rate in the state of California as a whole, where only 6.7% identify as lesbian, gay, bisexual or other sexual orientation. Thus, Betty Ford Center must have strong competencies in LGBT-specific care and be able to provide culturally competent care to this population.The majority of the Coachella Valley speaks either English (54.4%) or Spanish (41.0%) at home, and thus, Betty Ford Center must provide culturally competent care in Spanish if they are to truly meet the needs of their population. Less than 5% of the population speaks a language other than English or Spanish, and thus, those languages are less necessary to meeting the needs of this community.Local children are more likely to be Hispanic than local adults. This illustrates the unique nature of the Coachella Valley, which includes many white retirees who relocated to the area as well as local Hispanic families with children.About 38.9% of local adults (ages 18+) have a high school degree or less. This indicates that more than 60,000 local adults lack a high school degree. Thus, Betty Ford Center must be sure to provide materials to individuals with low literacy levels in order to serve this segment of the population. About a quarter of locals live in a household with an annual income under $20,000.Poverty was calculated using the number of people living in the home and the household income level. More than a quarter of local adults live below the federal poverty level (FPL), as do more than a third of local children.Thus, Betty Ford Center must continue to offer significant financial aid if they are to meet the needs of this substantial low-income community.Financial aid is especially important for uninsured adults, who are unable to bill their insurance for services. Approximately 13.9% of working age adults in the Coachella Valley remain uninsured. Virtually all seniors have health insurance due to Medicare."

The provision for doubtful accounts and the allowance for doubtful accounts relate primarily to amounts due directly from patients. Management relies on the results of detailed reviews of historical write-offs and recoveries as a primary source of information to utilize in estimating the collectability of the Company's accounts receivable. The results of the detailed reviews of historical write-offs and recoveries, adjusted for changes in trends and conditions, are used to estimate the allowance for doubtful accounts for the current period.

The primary collection risks relate to uninsured patient accounts, including patient accounts for which the primary insurance carrier has paid the amounts covered by the applicable agreement, but patient responsibility amounts (deductibles and copayments) remain outstanding. The provision for doubtful accounts and the allowance for doubtful accounts relate primarily to amounts due directly from patients. An estimated allowance for doubtful accounts is recorded for all uninsured accounts, regardless of the aging of those accounts. Accounts are written off when all reasonable internal and external collections efforts have been performed. Our collection policies include a review of all accounts against certain standard collection criteria, upon completion of our internal collection efforts. Accounts determined to possess positive collectability attributes are forwarded to a secondary external collections agency and the other accounts are written off. The accounts that are not collected by the secondary external collection agency are written off when they are returned to us by the collection agency (usually within 12 months). Write-offs are based upon specific identification and the write-off process requires a write-off adjustment entry to the patient accounting system. We do not pursue collection of amounts related to patients that meet our guidelines to qualify as charity care. The methodology to determine the bad debt expense reported at cost on Part III, Line 2 is to take the ratio of patient care costs to gross patient charges and multiply this resulting ratio by the gross charges for bad debt accounts."

When discounts are extended to self-pay patients, these patient account discounts are recorded as a reduction in revenue, not as bad debt expense."
201921349349305412,470757164,"Schedule H, Part III, Line 3 Bad Debt Expense Methodology",Alegent Creighton Health does not believe that any portion of bad debt expense could reasonably be attributed to patients who qualify for financial assistance since amounts due from those individuals' accounts will be reclassified from bad debt expense to charity care within 30 days following the date that the patient is determined to qualify for charity care.
201921349349305412,470757164,"Schedule H, Part III, Line 4 Bad debt expense - financial statement footnote","Alegent Creighton Health does not issue separate company audited financial statements. However, the organization is included in the consolidated financial statements of Catholic Health Initiatives. The consolidated footnote reads as follows: The provision for bad debts is based upon management's assessment of historical and expected net collections, taking into consideration historical business and economic conditions, trends in health care coverage, and other collection indicators. Management routinely assesses the adequacy of the allowances for uncollectible accounts based upon historical write-off experience by payor category. The results of these reviews are used to modify, as necessary, the provision for bad debts and to establish appropriate allowances for uncollectible net patient accounts receivable. After satisfaction of amounts due from insurance, CHI follows established guidelines for placing certain patient balances with collection agencies, subject to the terms of certain restrictions on collection efforts as determined by each facility. The provision for bad debts is presented in the consolidated statement of operations as a deduction from patient services revenues (net of contractual allowances and discounts) since CHI accepts and treats all patients without regard to the ability to pay."
201921349349305412,470757164,"Schedule H, Part III, Line 8 Community benefit & methodology for determining medicare costs","Using essentially the same Medicare cost report principles as to the allocation of general services costs and ""apportionment"" methods, the ""CHI Workbook"" calculates a payers' gross allowable costs by service (so as to facilitate a corresponding comparison between gross allowable costs and ultimate payments received). The term ""gross allowable costs"" means costs before any deductibles or co-insurance are subtracted. Alegent Creighton Health's ultimate reimbursement will be reduced by any applicable copayment/deductible. Where Medicare is the secondary insurer, amounts due from the insured's primary payer were not subtracted from Medicare allowable costs because the amounts are typically immaterial. Although not presented on the Medicare cost report, in order to facilitate a more accurate understanding of the ""true"" cost of services (for ""shortfall"" purposes) the CHI Workbook allows a health care facility not to offset costs that Medicare considers to be non-allowable, but for which the facility can legitimately argue are related to the care of the facility's patients. In addition, although not reportable on the Medicare cost report, the CHI workbook includes the cost of services that are paid via a set fee-schedule rather than being reimbursed based on costs (e.g. outpatient clinical laboratory). Finally, the CHI Workbook allows a facility to include other health care services performed by a separate facility (such as a physician practice) that are maintained on separate books and records (as opposed to the main facility's books and records which has its costs of service included within a cost report). True costs of Medicare computed using this methodology: Total Medicare Revenue: $47,420,990 Total Medicare costs: $110,264,303 Surplus or Shortfall: ($62,843,313) Alegent Creighton Health believes that excluding Medicare losses from community benefit makes the overall community benefit report more credible for these reasons: Unlike subsidized areas such as burn units or behavioral-health services, Medicare is not a differentiating feature of tax-exempt health care organizations. In fact, for-profit hospitals focus on attracting patients with Medicare coverage, especially in the case of well-paid services that include cardiac and orthopedics. Significant effort and resources are devoted to ensuring that hospitals are reimbursed appropriately by the Medicare program. The Medicare Payment Advisory Commission (MedPAC), an independent Congressional agency, carefully studies Medicare payment and the access to care that Medicare beneficiaries receive. The commission recommends payment adjustments to Congress accordingly. Though Medicare losses are not included by Catholic hospitals as community benefit, the Catholic Health Association guidelines allow hospitals to count as community benefit some programs that specifically serve the Medicare population. For instance, if hospitals operate programs for patients with Medicare benefits that respond to identified community needs, generate losses for the hospital, and meet other criteria, these programs can be included in the CHA framework in Category C as ''subsidized health services''. Medicare losses are different from Medicaid losses, which are counted in the CHA community benefit framework, because Medicaid reimbursements generally do not receive the level of attention paid to Medicare reimbursement. Medicaid payment is largely driven by what states can afford to pay, and is typically substantially less than what Medicare pays."
201921349349305412,470757164,"Schedule H, Part III, Line 9b Collection practices for patients eligible for financial assistance","The organization's billing and collections policy applies to all individuals presenting for emergency or other medically necessary care. The policy contains provisions for collecting amounts due from those patients who the organization knows to qualify for financial assistance either through the traditional financial assistance application process or through presumptive eligibility processes. Before engaging in extraordinary collection actions (ECAs) to obtain payment for EMCare, Hospital Facilities must make reasonable efforts through its billing and collections processes, pursuant to Treas. Reg. 1.501(r)-6(c), to determine whether an individual is eligible for Financial Assistance. In no event will an ECA be initiated prior to 120 days from the date the Facility provides the first post-discharge billing statement (i.e., during the Notification Period) unless all reasonable efforts have been made. Hospital Facilities will not refer accounts for collection where the patient has initially applied for Financial Assistance, and the Hospital Facility has not yet made reasonable efforts with respect to the account. For patients and Guarantors who are unable to provide required documentation, a Hospital Facility may grant Presumptive Financial Assistance based on information obtained from other resources. Patients who qualify for Medicaid are presumed to qualify for full charity write off. Any charges for days or services written off (excluding Medicaid denials related to timeliness of billing, insufficient medical record documentation, missing invoices, authorization, or eligibility issues) as a result of a Medicaid are booked as charity. Some Medicaid plans offer coverage for a limited or restricted list of services. If a patient is eligible for Medicaid, any charges for days or services not covered by the patient's coverage may be written off to charity without a completed application. This does not include any Share of Cost (SOC) or other patient cost-sharing amounts such as deductibles or copayments, as such costs are determined by the state to be an amount that the patient must pay before the patient is eligible for Medicaid. Health and Human Services (HSS) uses the term ""Spend Down"" instead of Share of Cost. All collection activities conducted by the Facility, a Designated Supplier, or its third-party collection agents will be in conformance with all federal and state laws governing debt collection practices. All third-party agreements governing collection and recovery activities must include a provision requiring compliance with the hospital facilities' financial assistance and billing and collections policy and indemnification for failures as a result of its noncompliance. This includes, but is not limited to, agreements between third parties who subsequently sell or refer debt of the Hospital Facility."

(PRC) is a third-party agent contracted by local health systems and local health departments ( see list below) to conduct the Community Health Needs Assessment for a four-county area, referred to as the Omaha Metro Area that includes Douglas, Sarpy, and Cass Counties, Nebraska, and Pottawattamie County, Iowa. PRC is a nationally recognized healthcare consulting firm with extensive experience conducting CHNAs across the United States since 1994. Along with several other community stakeholders, CHI Health was an active key health partner working with PRC to design, implement, and review the data. The Omaha Metro Area CHNA, conducted by PRC, utilized both primary and secondary data collected through the PRC Community Health Survey (primary); Online Key Informant Survey (primary); and public health, vital statistics, and other data collection (secondary). Please reference the complete CHNA for more in-depth details regarding the CHNA process. The process of identifying the community health needs across Pierce County was accomplished by utilizing the Mobilizing for Action through Planning and Partnerships (MAPP) strategy led by the North Central District Health Department (NCDHD). * North Central District Health Department (NCDHD) is a state-approved district health department that serves nine rural Nebraska counties-Antelope, Boyd, Brown, Cherry, Holt, Keya Paha, Knox, Pierce, and Rock. NCDHD has been state-approved as a multi-county public health department, a government body at the county level, since December 2001, providing education and services to the nine-county area. NCDHD completed a Community Health Needs Assessment for all nine counties within their district. * Ionia Research- Joseph Nitzke, PhD- North Central District Health Department and the partnering district hospitals contracted with Dr. Joseph Nitzke for data collection, compilation, analysis, and presentation for this community health assessment process. Facilitated by public health leaders, MAPP is a community-driven strategic planning approach used to improve community health through applying strategic thinking to prioritize public health issues and identify the resources to address them. This approach utilized both primary and secondary data collected throughout the process. Primary data included four MAPP assessments and secondary data consisted of public health, vital statistics, and other data collection. The assessment also incorporates a broad range of both qualitative and quantitative data. The quantitative data is primary (as derived from the North Central District Health Department Community Health Survey) and secondary (as derived from statistics from large datasets, as well as hospital-specific data); these resources allow for trend analysis and comparisons to both state and national levels. Qualitative data input is also derived from the North Central District Health Department Community Health Survey and focus group meetings.

Such notices and summary information shall include a contact number and shall be provided in English, Spanish, and other primary languages spoken by the population served by an individual Hospital Facility, as applicable. Referral of patients for Financial Assistance may be made by any member of the CHI Hospital Organization non-medical or medical staff, including physicians, nurses, financial counselors, social workers, case managers, chaplains, and religious sponsors. A request for assistance may be made by the patient or a family member, close friend, or associate of the patient, subject to applicable privacy laws. In addition, Hospital registration clerks are trained to provide consultation to those who have no insurance or potentially inadequate insurance concerning their financial options including application for Medicaid and for assistance under the Financial Assistance Policy. Counselors assist Medicare eligible patients in enrollment by providing referrals to the appropriate government agencies. Once it is determined that the patient does not qualify for any third party funding, the patient is verbally notified about the existence of Financial Assistance Application and additional screening takes place by a Hospital employee to determine if the patient is eligible for charity service prior to discharge. Upon registration (and once all EMTALA requirements are met), patients who are identified as uninsured (and not covered by Medicare or Medicaid) are provided with a packet of information that addresses the Financial Assistance Policy, the plain language summary of that policy, and an application for assistance. Hospital registration clerks read the organization's medical assistance policy to those who appear to be incapable of reading, and provide translators for non-English-speaking individuals. Patients that have been discharged prior to charity screening, such as emergency room patients, receive a written notification of possible eligibility for services. If the patient is determined not to be eligible for government assistance, he/she may notify the hospital that they seek charity assistance. The appropriate charity form is sent to the patient/guarantor for completion and then returned to the hospital for evaluation and qualification. Once determination of eligibility is made, the patient is sent a notice informing him/her if they qualify for full, partial, or no charity care services. Hospital Facilities must make reasonable efforts through its billing and collections processes, pursuant to Treas.

THE ATTACHED TEXT WAS OBTAINED FROM THE FOOTNOTES TO THE AUDITED CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS OF THE ORGANIZATION AND ITS AFFILIATES. CHARITABLE MEDICAL CARE PROVIDED -------------------------------- TJU PROVIDES MEDICALLY NECESSARY SERVICES TO ALL PATIENTS REGARDLESS OF THEIR ABILITY TO PAY. SOME PATIENTS QUALIFY FOR CHARITY CARE BASED ON POLICIES ESTABLISHED BY TJU AND ARE THEREFORE NOT RESPONSIBLE FOR PAYMENT FOR ALL OR A PART OF THEIR HEALTHCARE SERVICES. THESE POLICIES ALLOW FOR THE PROVISION OF FREE OR DISCOUNTED CARE IN CIRCUMSTANCES WHERE REQUIRING PAYMENT WOULD IMPOSE FINANCIAL HARDSHIP ON THE PATIENT. CHARGES FOR SERVICES RENDERED TO PATIENTS WHO MEET TJUS GUIDELINES FOR CHARITY CARE ARE NOT SEPARATELY RECORDED IN THE ACCOMPANYING CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS. TJU MAINTAINS RECORDS TO IDENTIFY AND MONITOR THE LEVEL OF CHARITY CARE PROVIDED. THESE RECORDS INCLUDE THE AMOUNT OF CHARGES FOREGONE FOR SERVICES AND SUPPLIES FURNISHED.

THESE AMOUNTS ARE NOT INCLUDED IN THE PROVISION FOR BAD DEBTS OF $132.8 MILLION AND $124.8 MILLION IN 2018 AND 2017, RESPECTIVELY, WHICH ARE REFLECTED AS DEDUCTIONS IN NET PATIENT SERVICE REVENUE. THE ESTIMATED COSTS OF PROVIDING CHARITY SERVICES ARE BASED ON A CALCULATION WHICH APPLIES A RATIO OF COSTS TO CHARGES TO THE GROSS UNCOMPENSATED CHARGES ASSOCIATED WITH PROVIDING CARE TO CHARITY PATIENTS. THE RATIO OF COST TO CHARGES IS CALCULATED BASED ON THE TJU TOTAL EXPENSES DIVIDED BY GROSS PATIENT SERVICE REVENUE. NET PATIENT SERVICE REVENUE --------------------------- NET PATIENT SERVICE REVENUE IS REPORTED AT THE ESTIMATED NET REALIZABLE AMOUNTS FROM PATIENTS, THIRD-PARTY PAYERS AND OTHERS FOR SERVICES RENDERED, INCLUDING ESTIMATED RETROACTIVE ADJUSTMENTS UNDER REIMBURSEMENT AGREEMENTS WITH THIRD-PARTY PAYERS. RETROACTIVE ADJUSTMENTS ARE CONSIDERED IN THE RECOGNITION OF REVENUE ON AN ESTIMATED BASIS IN THE PERIOD THE RELATED SERVICES ARE RENDERED AND ARE ADJUSTED IN FUTURE PERIODS AS FINAL SETTLEMENTS ARE DETERMINED.

ADDITIONAL PAYMENTS ARE MADE TO TJU TEACHING AND DISPROPORTIONATE SHARE HOSPITALS, AS WELL AS FOR CASES THAT HAVE UNUSUALLY HIGH COSTS. LAWS GOVERNING THE MEDICARE AND MEDICAID PROGRAMS ARE COMPLEX AND SUBJECT TO INTERPRETATION. SERVICES BILLED TO THE MEDICARE PROGRAM ARE SUBJECT TO EXTERNAL REVIEW FOR BOTH MEDICAL NECESSITY AND BILLING COMPLIANCE.

201901359349306445,230596940,"SCHEDULE H, PART III, LINE 8","MEDICARE COSTS WERE DERIVED FROM THE MEDICARE COST REPORT FILED BY THE ORGANIZATION. THE ORGANIZATION FEELS THAT MEDICARE UNDERPAYMENTS (SHORTFALL) AND BAD DEBT ARE COMMUNITY BENEFIT AND ASSOCIATED COSTS ARE INCLUDABLE ON THE FORM 990, SCHEDULE H, PART I. AS OUTLINED MORE FULLY BELOW THE ORGANIZATION BELIEVES THAT THESE SERVICES AND RELATED COSTS PROMOTE THE HEALTH OF THE COMMUNITY AS A WHOLE AND ARE RENDERED IN CONJUNCTION WITH THE ORGANIZATION'S CHARITABLE TAX-EXEMPT PURPOSES AND MISSION IN PROVIDING MEDICALLY NECESSARY HEALTHCARE SERVICES TO ALL INDIVIDUALS IN A NON-DISCRIMINATORY MANNER WITHOUT REGARD TO RACE, COLOR, CREED, SEX, NATIONAL ORIGIN OR ABILITY TO PAY AND CONSISTENT WITH THE COMMUNITY BENEFIT STANDARD PROMULGATED BY THE INTERNAL REVENUE SERVICE (""IRS""). THE COMMUNITY BENEFIT STANDARD IS THE CURRENT STANDARD FOR A HOSPITAL FOR RECOGNITION AS A TAX-EXEMPT AND CHARITABLE ORGANIZATION UNDER INTERNAL REVENUE CODE (""IRC"") 501(C)(3). THE ORGANIZATION IS RECOGNIZED AS A TAX-EXEMPT ENTITY AND CHARITABLE ORGANIZATION UNDER 501(C)(3) OF THE IRC. ALTHOUGH THERE IS NO DEFINITION IN THE TAX CODE FOR THE TERM ""CHARITABLE"", A REGULATION PROMULGATED BY THE DEPARTMENT OF THE TREASURY PROVIDES SOME GUIDANCE AND STATES THAT ""[T]HE TERM CHARITABLE IS USED IN 501(C)(3) IN ITS GENERALLY ACCEPTED LEGAL SENSE,PROVIDES EXAMPLES OF CHARITABLE PURPOSES, INCLUDING THE RELIEF OF THE POOR OR UNPRIVILEGED; THE PROMOTION OF SOCIAL WELFARE; AND THE ADVANCEMENT OF EDUCATION, RELIGION, AND SCIENCE. NOTE: IT DOES NOT EXPLICITLY ADDRESS THE ACTIVITIES OF HOSPITALS. IN THE ABSENCE OF EXPLICIT STATUTORY OR REGULATORY REQUIREMENTS APPLYING THE TERM ""CHARITABLE"" TO HOSPITALS, IT HAS BEEN LEFT TO THE IRS TO DETERMINE THE CRITERIA HOSPITALS MUST MEET TO QUALIFY AS IRC 501(C)(3) CHARITABLE ORGANIZATIONS. THE ORIGINAL STANDARD WAS KNOWN AS THE CHARITY CARE STANDARD. THIS STANDARD WAS REPLACED BY THE IRS WITH THE COMMUNITY BENEFIT STANDARD WHICH IS THE CURRENT STANDARD. CHARITY CARE STANDARD IN 1956, THE IRS ISSUED REVENUE RULING 56-185, WHICH ADDRESSED THE REQUIREMENTS HOSPITALS NEEDED TO MEET IN ORDER TO QUALIFY FOR IRC 501(C)(3) STATUS. ONE OF THESE REQUIREMENTS IS KNOWN AS THE ""CHARITY CARE STANDARD."" UNDER THE STANDARD, A HOSPITAL HAD TO PROVIDE, TO THE EXTENT OF ITS FINANCIAL ABILITY, FREE OR REDUCED-COST CARE TO PATIENTS UNABLE TO PAY FOR IT. A HOSPITAL THAT EXPECTED FULL PAYMENT DID NOT, ACCORDING TO THE RULING, PROVIDE CHARITY CARE BASED ON THE FACT THAT SOME PATIENTS ULTIMATELY FAILED TO PAY. THE RULING EMPHASIZED THAT A LOW LEVEL OF CHARITY CARE DID NOT NECESSARILY MEAN THAT A HOSPITAL HAD FAILED TO MEET THE REQUIREMENT SINCE THAT LEVEL COULD REFLECT ITS FINANCIAL ABILITY TO PROVIDE SUCH CARE. THE RULING ALSO NOTED THAT PUBLICLY SUPPORTED COMMUNITY HOSPITALS WOULD NORMALLY QUALIFY AS CHARITABLE ORGANIZATIONS BECAUSE THEY SERVE THE ENTIRE COMMUNITY AND A LOW LEVEL OF CHARITY CARE WOULD NOT AFFECT A HOSPITAL'S EXEMPT STATUS IF IT WAS DUE TO THE SURROUNDING COMMUNITY'S LACK OF CHARITABLE DEMANDS. COMMUNITY BENEFIT STANDARD IN 1969, THE IRS ISSUED REVENUE RULING 69-545, WHICH ""REMOVE[D]"" FROM REVENUE RULING 56-185 ""THE REQUIREMENTS RELATING TO CARING FOR PATIENTS WITHOUT CHARGE OR AT RATES BELOW COST."" UNDER THE STANDARD DEVELOPED IN REVENUE RULING 69-545, WHICH IS KNOWN AS THE ""COMMUNITY BENEFIT STANDARD,"" HOSPITALS ARE JUDGED ON WHETHER THEY PROMOTE THE HEALTH OF A BROAD CLASS OF INDIVIDUALS IN THE COMMUNITY. THE RULING INVOLVED A HOSPITAL THAT ONLY ADMITTED INDIVIDUALS WHO COULD PAY FOR THE SERVICES (BY THEMSELVES, PRIVATE INSURANCE, OR PUBLIC PROGRAMS SUCH AS MEDICARE), BUT OPERATED A FULL-TIME EMERGENCY ROOM THAT WAS OPEN TO EVERYONE. THE IRS RULED THAT THE HOSPITAL QUALIFIED AS A CHARITABLE ORGANIZATION BECAUSE IT PROMOTED THE HEALTH OF PEOPLE IN ITS COMMUNITY. THE IRS REASONED THAT BECAUSE THE PROMOTION OF HEALTH WAS A CHARITABLE PURPOSE ACCORDING TO THE GENERAL LAW OF CHARITY, IT FELL WITHIN THE ""GENERALLY ACCEPTED LEGAL SENSE"" OF THE TERM ""CHARITABLE,"" AS REQUIRED BY TREAS. REG. 1.501(C)(3)-1(D)(2). THE IRS RULING STATED THAT THE PROMOTION OF HEALTH, LIKE THE RELIEF OF POVERTY AND THE ADVANCEMENT OF EDUCATION AND RELIGION, IS ONE OF THE PURPOSES IN THE GENERAL LAW OF CHARITY THAT IS DEEMED BENEFICIAL TO THE COMMUNITY AS A WHOLE EVEN THOUGH THE CLASS OF BENEFICIARIES ELIGIBLE TO RECEIVE A DIRECT BENEFIT FROM ITS ACTIVITIES DOES NOT INCLUDE ALL MEMBERS OF THE COMMUNITY, SUCH AS INDIGENT MEMBERS OF THE COMMUNITY, PROVIDED THAT THE CLASS IS NOT SO SMALL THAT ITS RELIEF IS NOT OF BENEFIT TO THE COMMUNITY. THE IRS CONCLUDED THAT THE HOSPITAL WAS ""PROMOTING THE HEALTH OF A CLASS OF PERSONS THAT IS BROAD ENOUGH TO BENEFIT THE COMMUNITY"" BECAUSE ITS EMERGENCY ROOM WAS OPEN TO ALL AND IT PROVIDED CARE TO EVERYONE WHO COULD PAY, WHETHER DIRECTLY OR THROUGH THIRD-PARTY REIMBURSEMENT. OTHER CHARACTERISTICS OF THE HOSPITAL THAT THE IRS HIGHLIGHTED INCLUDED THE FOLLOWING: ITS SURPLUS FUNDS WERE USED TO IMPROVE PATIENT CARE, EXPAND HOSPITAL FACILITIES, AND ADVANCE MEDICAL TRAINING, EDUCATION, AND RESEARCH; IT WAS CONTROLLED BY A BOARD OF TRUSTEES THAT CONSISTED OF INDEPENDENT CIVIC LEADERS; AND HOSPITAL MEDICAL STAFF PRIVILEGES WERE AVAILABLE TO ALL QUALIFIED PHYSICIANS. THE AMERICAN HOSPITAL ASSOCIATION (""AHA"") FEELS THAT MEDICARE UNDERPAYMENTS (SHORTFALL) AND BAD DEBT ARE COMMUNITY BENEFIT AND THUS INCLUDABLE ON THE FORM 990, SCHEDULE H, PART I. THIS ORGANIZATION AGREES WITH THE AHA POSITION. AS OUTLINED IN THE AHA LETTER TO THE IRS DATED AUGUST 21, 2007 WITH RESPECT TO THE FIRST PUBLISHED DRAFT OF THE NEW FORM 990 AND SCHEDULE H, THE AHA FELT THAT THE IRS SHOULD INCORPORATE THE FULL VALUE OF THE COMMUNITY BENEFIT THAT HOSPITALS PROVIDE BY COUNTING MEDICARE UNDERPAYMENTS (SHORTFALL) AND BAD DEBT AS QUANTIFIABLE COMMUNITY BENEFIT FOR THE FOLLOWING REASONS: - PROVIDING CARE FOR THE ELDERLY AND SERVING MEDICARE PATIENTS IS AN ESSENTIAL PART OF THE COMMUNITY BENEFIT STANDARD. - MEDICARE, LIKE MEDICAID, DOES NOT PAY THE FULL COST OF CARE. RECENTLY, MEDICARE REIMBURSES HOSPITALS ONLY 92 CENTS FOR EVERY DOLLAR THEY SPEND TO TAKE CARE OF MEDICARE PATIENTS. THE MEDICARE PAYMENT ADVISORY COMMISSION (""MEDPAC"") IN ITS MARCH 2007 REPORT TO CONGRESS CAUTIONED THAT UNDERPAYMENT WILL GET EVEN WORSE, WITH MARGINS REACHING A 10-YEAR LOW AT NEGATIVE 5.4 PERCENT. - MANY MEDICARE BENEFICIARIES, LIKE THEIR MEDICAID COUNTERPARTS, ARE POOR. MORE THAN 46 PERCENT OF MEDICARE SPENDING IS FOR BENEFICIARIES WHOSE INCOME IS BELOW 200 PERCENT OF THE FEDERAL POVERTY LEVEL. MANY OF THOSE MEDICARE BENEFICIARIES ARE ALSO ELIGIBLE FOR MEDICAID -- SO CALLED ELIGIBLES."" THERE IS EVERY COMPELLING PUBLIC POLICY REASON TO TREAT MEDICARE AND MEDICAID UNDERPAYMENTS SIMILARLY FOR PURPOSES OF A HOSPITAL'S COMMUNITY BENEFIT AND INCLUDE THESE COSTS ON FORM 990, SCHEDULE H, PART I. MEDICARE UNDERPAYMENT MUST BE SHOULDERED BY THE HOSPITAL IN ORDER TO CONTINUE TREATING THE COMMUNITY'S ELDERLY AND POOR. THESE UNDERPAYMENTS REPRESENT A REAL COST OF SERVING THE COMMUNITY AND SHOULD COUNT AS A QUANTIFIABLE COMMUNITY BENEFIT. BOTH THE AHA AND THIS ORGANIZATION ALSO FEEL THAT PATIENT BAD DEBT IS A COMMUNITY BENEFIT AND THUS INCLUDABLE ON THE FORM 990, SCHEDULE H, PART I. THERE ARE COMPELLING REASONS THAT PATIENT BAD DEBT SHOULD BE COUNTED AS QUANTIFIABLE COMMUNITY BENEFIT AS FOLLOWS: - A SIGNIFICANT MAJORITY OF BAD DEBT IS ATTRIBUTABLE TO LOW-INCOME PATIENTS, WHO, FOR MANY REASONS, DECLINE TO COMPLETE THE FORMS REQUIRED TO ESTABLISH ELIGIBILITY FOR HOSPITALS' CHARITY CARE OR FINANCIAL ASSISTANCE PROGRAMS. A 2006 CONGRESSIONAL BUDGET OFFICE (""CBO"") REPORT, NONPROFIT HOSPITALS AND THE PROVISION OF COMMUNITY BENEFITS, CITED TWO STUDIES INDICATING THAT ""THE GREAT MAJORITY OF BAD DEBT WAS ATTRIBUTABLE TO PATIENTS WITH INCOMES BELOW 200% OF THE FEDERAL POVERTY LINE."" - THE REPORT ALSO NOTED THAT A SUBSTANTIAL PORTION OF BAD DEBT IS PENDING CHARITY CARE. UNLIKE BAD DEBT IN OTHER INDUSTRIES, HOSPITAL BAD DEBT IS COMPLICATED BY THE FACT THAT HOSPITALS FOLLOW THEIR MISSION TO THE COMMUNITY AND TREAT EVERY PATIENT THAT COMES THROUGH THEIR EMERGENCY DEPARTMENT, REGARDLESS OF ABILITY TO PAY. PATIENTS WHO HAVE OUTSTANDING BILLS ARE NOT TURNED AWAY, UNLIKE OTHER INDUSTRIES. BAD DEBT IS FURTHER COMPLICATED BY THE AUDITING INDUSTRY'S STANDARDS ON REPORTING CHARITY CARE. MANY PATIENTS CANNOT OR DO NOT PROVIDE THE NECESSARY, EXTENSIVE DOCUMENTATION REQUIRED TO BE DEEMED CHARITY CARE BY AUDITORS. AS A RESULT, ROUGHLY 10% OF BAD DEBT IS PENDING CHARITY CARE. - THE CBO CONCLUDED THAT ITS FINDINGS ""SUPPORT THE VALIDITY OF THE USE OF UNCOMPENSATED CARE [BAD DEBT AND CHARITY CARE] AS A MEASURE OF COMMUNITY BENEFITS"" ASSUMING THE FINDINGS ARE GENERALIZABLE NATIONWIDE; THE EXPERIENCE OF HOSPITALS AROUND THE NATION REINFORCES THAT THEY ARE GENERALIZABLE. AS OUTLINED BY THE AHA, DESPITE THE HOSPITAL'S BEST EFFORTS AND DUE DILIGENCE, PATIENT BAD DEBT IS A PART OF THE HOSPITAL'S MISSION AND CHARITABLE PURPOSES. BAD DEBT REPRESENTS"

IN ORDER TO SECURE REIMBURSEMENT OF COSTS FOR SERVICES PROVIDED, EVERY EFFORT IS MADE TO ASSIST PATIENTS IN OBTAINING INSURANCE COVERAGE THROUGH MEDICAL ASSISTANCE (MA), CHILDREN'S HEALTH INSURANCE PROGRAM (CHIP) OR OTHER FEDERAL, STATE, OR CITY CARE COVERAGE SOURCES. JHNE PROVIDES FINANCIAL ASSISTANCE TO THOSE PATIENTS WHO ARE UNABLE TO PAY BASED UPON THE ELIGIBILITY CRITERIA INCLUDED IN THEIR FINANCIAL ASSISTANCE POLICY. BILLING & COLLECTION EFFORTS ---------------------------- WHILE QUALIFICATION FOR FINANCIAL ASSISTANCE IS IDEALLY DETERMINED PRIOR TO, OR AT THE TIME OF SERVICE, JHNE CONTINUES TO REVIEW SUCH DETERMINATIONS AS OTHER FINANCIAL RESOURCES ARE DISCOVERED DURING THE BILLING AND COLLECTION PROCESS. AFTER AN UNINSURED OR UNDER-INSURED PATIENT'S ACCOUNT IS REDUCED TO THE UNINSURED DISCOUNT OR THE FINANCIAL ASSISTANCE DISCOUNT RATE, WHICHEVER IS APPLICABLE, THE PATIENT IS RESPONSIBLE FOR THE REMAINDER OF ANY OUTSTANDING PATIENT BALANCES. PATIENTS WILL RECEIVE AN INITIAL STATEMENT INDICATING THEIR BALANCE DUE ALONG WITH INFORMATION REGARDING THE AVAILABILITY OF FINANCIAL ASSISTANCE AND WHO TO CONTACT. SELF-PAY BALANCES GO THROUGH A PRE-COLLECTION AGENCY PLACEMENT PROCESS THAT MAY ENTAIL THE MAILING OF STATEMENTS OR LETTERS AND/OR PHONE CALLS IN ORDER TO COLLECT PAYMENT ON OPEN BALANCES. ONCE OPEN BALANCE ACCOUNTS COMPLETE THE PRE-COLLECTION DUNNING CYCLE, (120 DAYS OR MORE) WITH NO PAYMENT OR PROOF OF ELIGIBILITY FOR FINANCIAL ASSISTANCE OR OTHER PROGRAMS, THE ACCOUNTS WILL BE TRANSFERRED TO A PROFESSIONAL COLLECTION AGENCY. IF A FINANCIAL ASSISTANCE APPLICATION AND APPROPRIATE SUPPORTING DOCUMENTS HAVE BEEN SUBMITTED AND A DECISION IS PENDING, THE ACCOUNT WILL BE HELD FROM AGENCY PLACEMENT. IN SOME CASES, A PATIENT ELIGIBLE FOR FINANCIAL ASSISTANCE MAY NOT HAVE BEEN IDENTIFIED PRIOR TO SENDING THE ACCOUNT TO AN EXTERNAL COLLECTION AGENCY. EACH AGENCY WILL BE MADE AWARE OF THE FINANCIAL ASSISTANCE POLICY AND WILL WORK WITH THE PROVIDER TO ASCERTAIN PATIENT ELIGIBILITY. EXTRAORDINARY COLLECTION ACTIONS (""ECAS"") WILL NOT BE UNDERTAKEN DURING THE INITIAL NOTIFICATION PERIOD OF THE 120 DAYS FROM THE FIRST POST-DISCHARGE BILLING STATEMENT AND UNTIL SUCH TIME AS A 30 DAY INITIATION OF ECA NOTICE HAS BEEN SENT TO THE INDIVIDUAL. THE 30 DAY ECA INITIATION NOTICE WILL CONTAIN THE ECA ACTION THAT THE PROVIDER INTENDS TO UNDERTAKE AND THE DATE AT WHICH TIME THIS WOULD OCCUR. A COPY OF THE ORGANIZATIONS PLAIN LANGUAGE SUMMARY WILL ACCOMPANY THE 30 DAY ECA INITIATION NOTICE. IF THE PATIENT SUBMITS A FINANCIAL ASSISTANCE APPLICATION, JHNE WILL SUSPEND ANY ECAS UNTIL THE PATIENTS FINANCIAL ASSISTANCE ELIGIBILITY IS DETERMINED AND THE PATIENT IS INFORMED OF THEIR ELIGIBILITY. IF A PATIENT ACCOUNT IS REFERRED TO AN OUTSIDE AGENCY, THAT AGENCY MUST FIRST AGREE TO ABIDE BY JHNES FINANCIAL ASSISTANCE POLICY IN RELATION TO ITS COLLECTION EFFORTS. NO EXTERNAL COLLECTION AGENCY ARE PERMITTED TO ENGAGE IN ECAS UNLESS AUTHORIZED BY JHNE. AFTER THE ABOVE-DESCRIBED STEPS HAVE BEEN TAKEN, JHNE MAY USE ECAS WITH THE RESPECT TO THE PATIENT ACCOUNT OF AN UNINSURED OR UNDER-INSURED AND MAY FURTHER CONSIDER CREDIT BUREAU REPORTING AND/OR LEGAL ACTION AS APPROPRIATE. JHNES GENERAL COUNSEL IS REQUIRED TO ALL LAWSUITS PRIOR TO THE ECA COMMENCING. FINAL AUTHORITY FOR DETERMINING THAT JHNE HAS MADE ADEQUATE ATTEMPTS TO INFORM A PATIENT OF THE FINANCIAL ASSISTANCE POLICY, AND THUS MAY INITIATE THE USE ECAS, RESTS WITH THE ORGANIZATIONS VICE PRESIDENT DIRECTOR OF REVENUE CYCLE OPERATIONS."

JHNE COMMUNITY BENEFIT (CB) AREAS ARE DEFINED AS THE AREAS PROXIMATE TO THE HOSPITALS WHERE APPROXIMATELY 90% OF PATIENTS RESIDE. THIS INCLUDES COMMUNITIES IN BUCKS AND PHILADELPHIA COUNTIES THAT ARE AGGREGATED INTO 5 GEOGRAPHICALLY CONTIGUOUS REGIONS DEFINED BY ZIP CODES. FOR COMPARISON, THE COMBINED DATA FOR BUCKS AND PHILADELPHIA COUNTIES IS PROVIDED. TWO COMPARATORS ARE WARRANTED DUE TO THE DISPARATE POPULATIONS OF PHILADELPHIA AND ITS SUBURBS. ALMOST 1,044,000 PEOPLE LIVE IN THE JEFFERSON HEALTH NORTHEASTS CB AREA. THIS REPRESENTS 48% OF ALL RESIDENTS OF BUCKS AND PHILADELPHIA COUNTIES COMBINED. LOWER NE/N PHILADELPHIA HAS A HIGHER PERCENT OF YOUTH AGES 0-17 AND LOWER BUCKS WEST HAS A HIGHER PERCENTAGE OF ADULTS AGED 65+ THAN OTHER CB AREAS, BUCKS, PHILADELPHIA, AND THE UNITED STATES. LOWER BUCKS WEST IS THE LEAST RACIAL/ETHNIC DIVERSE, WITH 88% OF THE POPULATION IDENTIFYING AS NON-HISPANIC WHITE. THE HIGHEST PROPORTION OF ASIAN AND PACIFIC ISLANDERS LIVE IN NORTHEAST PHILADELPHIA (12%), AND THE HIGHEST CONCENTRATION OF BLACK NON-HISPANICS (34%) LIVE IN LOWER NE/N PHILADELPHIA. THE HIGHEST CONCENTRATION OF HISPANICS RESIDE IN LOWER NE/N PHILADELPHIA (36%). JHNES COMMUNITY BENEFIT AREA IS AN AREA WITH DIVERSE UNDERLYING ECONOMIC AND STRUCTURAL BARRIERS SUCH AS INCOME, CULTURE/LANGUAGE, EDUCATION, INSURANCE, AND HOUSING THAT AFFECT OVERALL HEALTH. ACCORDING TO ITS MOST RECENTLY CONDUCTED CHNA ALMOST 2.2 MILLION PEOPLE LIVE IN BUCKS (627,000) AND PHILADELPHIA (1,557,000) COUNTIES. ACCORDING TO THE COUNTY HEALTH RANKINGS AND ROADMAPS 2018, THE POPULATION OF BUCKS COUNTY IS 86% NON-HISPANIC WHITE, 4% NON-HISPANIC AFRICAN AMERICAN, 5% HISPANIC OR LATINO, AND 5% ASIAN. THE RACIAL/ETHNIC DISTRIBUTION PHILADELPHIAS POPULATION IS VERY DIFFERENT: 36% NON-HISPANIC WHITE, 41% NON-HISPANIC AFRICAN AMERICAN, 14% HISPANIC OR LATINO, AND 7% ASIAN. THE PROPORTION OF RESIDENTS AGED LESS THAN 18 IN BUCKS COUNTY (20.5%) IS LOWER THAN IN PHILADELPHIA (22.6%) AND THE US (23.2%). THE PROPORTION AGE 65+ IS 17.8% IN BUCKS COUNTY, 14.7% IN THE US, AND 13% IN PHILADELPHIA. MEDIAN HOUSEHOLD INCOME IN BUCKS COUNTY ($80,100) IS SIGNIFICANTLY HIGHER THAN FOR PENNSYLVANIA ($56,900), WHILE THE MEDIAN HOUSEHOLD INCOME IN PHILADELPHIA IS MUCH LOWER ($41,500). TWO PERCENT ARE NOT PROFICIENT IN ENGLISH IN PENNSYLVANIA AND BUCKS COUNTY, AND 6% IN PHILADELPHIA LACK ENGLISH PROFICIENCY. INCOME AND POVERTY ------------------ JHNES CB AREA IS RELATIVELY HIGH IN SUBURBAN COMMUNITIES AND LOWER IN PHILADELPHIA. HOUSEHOLD INCOME IN LOWER NE/N PHILADELPHIA IS VERY LOW. WHILE THE MAJORITY OF THE POPULATION IN SUBURBAN AREAS ENJOY HOUSEHOLD INCOMES OF MORE THAN $75,000, POVERTY IS CONCENTRATED IN SOME COMMUNITIES, NOTABLY LOWER NE/N PHILADELPHIA, AND POVERTY IS DISPERSED THROUGHOUT THE JEFFERSON HEALTH NORTHEAST CB SERVICE AREAS. POVERTY CAN RESULT IN AN INCREASED RISK OF MORTALITY, PREVALENCE OF MEDICAL CONDITIONS AND DISEASE INCIDENCE, DEPRESSION, INTIMATE PARTNER VIOLENCE, AND POOR HEALTH BEHAVIORS. THE PERCENTAGE OF PEOPLE LIVING BELOW 200% OF THE FPL IN EACH REGION IS MUCH HIGHER COMPARED TO PEOPLE LIVING BELOW THE 100% FPL. FOR EXAMPLE, WHILE 5.8% OF PEOPLE IN LOWER BUCKS EAST WERE BELOW THE 100% FPL, ALMOST 18% ARE BELOW THE 200% FPL. IN ADDITION, THERE ARE PEOPLE LIVING IN DEEP POVERTY, DEFINED AS BELOW 50% OF THE FEDERAL POVERTY LEVEL, IN THE JEFFERSON HEALTH NORTHEAST CB AREA. THE HIGHEST CONCENTRATION DEEP POVERTY IS IN LOWER NE/N PHILADELPHIA. EDUCATION --------- THE LEVEL OF EDUCATION AMONG RESIDENTS IN JHNE CB AREA VARIES. RESIDENTS LIVING IN LOWER BUCKS WEST ARE MORE LIKELY TO HAVE COLLEGE DEGREES OR HIGHER (41%) COMPARED TO PHILADELPHIA (25%). ALMOST 28% OF RESIDENTS OF LOWER NE/N PHILADELPHIA DID NOT GRADUATE FROM HIGH SCHOOL COMPARED TO PHILADELPHIA (18%). EMPLOYMENT AND JOB TRAINING --------------------------- AS OF DECEMBER 2017, UNEMPLOYMENT IN BUCKS (3.7%) WAS AMONG THE LOWEST IN THE METROPOLITAN AREA, AND WAS LOWER THAN THE U.S. AVERAGE OF 3.9%. THE UNEMPLOYMENT RATE IN PHILADELPHIA WAS 5.6%. UNEMPLOYMENT DECREASED .2% TO .3% IN THESE COUNTIES FROM THE PRIOR YEAR. FOR JEFFERSON HEALTH NORTHEAST CB AREA'S VULNERABLE ADULTS, FINDING A JOB WITH FAMILY-SUSTAINING WAGES IS ONLY THE FIRST HURDLE ON THE PATH TO ECONOMIC STABILITY. BECAUSE OF PHYSICAL AND MENTAL HEALTH CHALLENGES, A LACK OF PEER SUPPORT AND LIMITED WORK EXPERIENCE, LOW SKILLED ADULTS OFTEN FIND IT DIFFICULT TO NOT ONLY OBTAIN JOBS, BUT TO RETAIN THEIR JOBS. ONCE EMPLOYED, MANY RESIDENTS IN THESE COMMUNITIES NEED TO RECEIVE ON-GOING COUNSELING AND SUPPORT SERVICES TO IMPROVE THEIR WORK HABITS, MANAGE WORK-RELATED STRESS, BALANCE FAMILY AND WORK OBLIGATIONS, AND EFFECTIVELY MANAGE CHRONIC HEALTH CONDITIONS. HEALTH INSURANCE ---------------- UNDER THE AFFORDABLE CARE ACT, MILLIONS OF AMERICANS BECAME ELIGIBLE FOR NEW COVERAGE OPPORTUNITIES IN 2014. IN 2017, 8.8 MILLION AMERICANS ENROLLED FOR HEALTH INSURANCE COVERAGE THROUGH THE FEDERAL MARKETPLACE DESPITE CUTS IN FUNDING AND LENGTH OF THE ENROLLMENT PERIOD, INCLUDING MORE THAN A MILLION GAINING NEW COVERAGE. THE HEALTHY PEOPLE 2020 GOAL IS INSURANCE FOR EVERYONE. IN BUCKS AND PHILADELPHIA, 6.0% AND 12.4% OF ADULTS AGED 18-64 RESPECTIVELY ARE UNINSURED.

LITERACY -------- HEALTH LITERACY IS A STRONGER PREDICTOR OF INDIVIDUAL HEALTH STATUS THAN AGE, INCOME, EMPLOYMENT STATUS, EDUCATION LEVEL OR RACIAL/ETHNIC GROUP. INADEQUATE HEALTH LITERACY, AS MEASURED BY READING FLUENCY, INDEPENDENTLY PREDICTS ALL-CAUSE MORTALITY AND CARDIOVASCULAR DEATH AMONG COMMUNITY DWELLING ELDERLY PERSONS. HEALTH LITERACY ALSO CONTRIBUTES TO DISPARITIES ASSOCIATED WITH RACE/ETHNICITY AND EDUCATIONAL ATTAINMENT IN SELF-RATED HEALTH AND SOME PREVENTIVE MEASURES. RACE/ETHNICITY (AFRICAN AMERICAN AND LATINO/HISPANIC), AGE (OLDER THAN 65), NOT COMPLETING HIGH SCHOOL, POVERTY, AND NOT SPEAKING ENGLISH PRIOR TO ENTERING SCHOOL HAVE ALSO BEEN ASSOCIATED WITH LOWER LITERACY LEVELS. OLDER ADULTS ARE DISPROPORTIONATELY MORE LIKELY TO HAVE BELOW BASIC HEALTH LITERACY THAN ANY OTHER AGE GROUP. ALMOST THREE IN TEN (29%) OF PEOPLE AGE 65 AND OVER HAVE A HEALTH LITERACY LEVEL OF BELOW BASIC COMPARED WITH 13% OF PEOPLE AGE 5064 AND 11% OF PEOPLE AGE 40-49.

201902199349300865,362340313,"SCHEDULE H - PART VI, LINE 2 - NEEDS ASSESSMENT","THE 2018 COMMUNITY HEALTH NEEDS ASSESSMENT WAS CONDUCTED INDEPENDENTLY BY THE HOSPITAL INSTEAD OF BEING OUTSOURCED TO A VENDOR. THE HOSPITAL BELIEVED DOING ITS OWN ASSESSMENT WOULD YIELD MORE MEANINGFUL RESULTS AND A CLEARER SNAPSHOT OF THE COMMUNITY IT SERVES. THE ASSESSMENT WAS COMPRISED OF DATA COLLECTED FROM QUANTITATIVE, QUALITATIVE OR A COMBINATION OF BOTH RESOURCES. THE HOSPITAL CONTRACTED WITH SG2, AN INDUSTRY LEADER IN HEALTHCARE ANALYTICS AND CONSULTING, FOR QUANTITATIVE DATA. SG2 PROVIDED COMPREHENSIVE DEMOGRAPHIC INFORMATION OF THE HOSPITAL'S SERVICE AREA. THEY ALSO PROVIDED POPULATION GROWTH PROJECTIONS FOR THE COMMUNITY BY TOWN, AGE, GENDER, ETHNICITY/RACE, INCOME AND EDUCATION. IN ADDITION, THEY FORECASTED THE PROJECTED GROWTH OF CHRONIC DISEASE AREAS BY BOTH INPATIENT AND OUTPATIENT FOR THE HOSPITAL'S SERVICE AREA. CHANGES IN COMMUNITY DEMOGRAPHICS HAVE A DIRECT CORRELATION WITH HEALTHCARE NEEDS AND HOW TO ADDRESS THEM. ADDITIONAL QUANTITATIVE DATA WAS COLLECTED THROUGH COMMUNITY COMMONS, A WEB PORTAL (COMMUNITYCOMMONS.ORG) THAT ALLOWS ACCESS TO DATA IN MULTIPLE CATEGORIES WHICH CAN BE USED TO EXPLORE COMMUNITY HEALTH. THESE CATEGORIES INCLUDE DEMOGRAPHICS, SOCIAL AND ECONOMIC FACTORS, PHYSICAL ENVIRONMENT, CLINICAL CARE, HEALTH BEHAVIORS AND HEALTH OUTCOMES. THE GOAL OF COMMUNITY COMMONS IS TO INCREASE THE IMPACT OF THOSE WORKING TOWARD HEALTHY, EQUITABLE, AND SUSTAINABLE COMMUNITIES. CUSTOM TOOLS ALLOWED THE HOSPITAL TO FILTER DATA BY ZIP CODE AND CREATE A REPORT SPECIFICALLY FOR ITS COMMUNITY. IT ALSO ALLOWED THE HOSPITAL TO CREATE A CUSTOM REPORT WHICH HIGHLIGHTS ITS COMMUNITY'S GREATEST AREAS OF CONCERN. THE LAST SOURCE OF QUANTITATIVE DATA WAS THE 2018 COUNTY HEALTH RANKINGS AND ROADMAPS REPORT (COUNTYHEALTHRANKINGS.ORG), COLLABORATION BETWEEN THE ROBERT WOOD JOHNSON FOUNDATION AND THE UNIVERSITY OF WISCONSIN POPULATION HEALTH INSTITUTE. THIS REPORT RANKS U.S. COUNTIES IN EVERY STATE ON VARIOUS HEALTH OUTCOMES, HEALTH FACTORS, SOCIAL AND ECONOMIC CONDITIONS, AND THE PHYSICAL ENVIRONMENT. THE MAJOR GOAL OF THE RANKINGS IS TO RAISE AWARENESS ABOUT THE MANY FACTORS THAT INFLUENCE HEALTH AND THAT HEALTH VARIES FROM PLACE TO PLACE. BECAUSE THE COUNTY WHERE THE HOSPITAL IS LOCATED (COOK) IS SO LARGE AND DIVERSE, THE COOK COUNTY DEPARTMENT OF PUBLIC HEALTH RECOGNIZED THE UNIQUENESS AND IDENTIFIED INDICATORS FROM THE RANKINGS FOR WHICH LOCAL DATA EXISTED AND CREATED A REPORT SPECIFICALLY FOR SUBURBAN COOK COUNTY. THE HOSPITAL UTILIZED THIS REPORT AS WELL. QUALITATIVE DATA WAS PRIMARY COLLECTED THROUGH FOCUS GROUPS. THE HOSPITAL REALIZED THE IMPORTANCE OF GATHERING OPINIONS AND FEEDBACK FROM VULNERABLE POPULATIONS IN THE COMMUNITY WHO HAVE SOME OF THE GREATEST HEALTHCARE NEEDS. A PROFESSIONAL MODERATOR WAS HIRED TO CONDUCT THREE FOCUS GROUPS IN FEBRUARY 2018: ONE WITH SENIORS; ONE WITH SPANISH- SPEAKING UNDER-RESOURCED COMMUNITY MEMBERS AND ONE WITH ENGLISH-SPEAKING UNDER-RESOURCED COMMUNITY MEMBERS. POTENTIAL PARTICIPANTS WERE GIVEN A SHORT SCREENING QUESTIONNAIRE TO ENSURE THEY LIVED IN THE HOSPITAL'S SERVICE AREA AND SO THAT PARTICIPANTS WOULD VARY IN AGE, GENDER, INSURANCE STATUS, INCOME AND EDUCATIONAL LEVELS. THE FOCUS GROUPS FOLLOWED A GUIDELINE WHICH MIRRORED QUESTIONS INCLUDED IN THE COMMUNITY AND KEY INFORMANT SURVEYS SO THAT THE INFORMATION GATHERED COULD BE USED TO COMPARE WITH THE SURVEY RESULTS. THE MODERATOR SUMMARIZED THE RESULTS OF THE FOCUS GROUPS WHICH WERE USED AS ONE OF THE TOOLS IN IDENTIFYING THE MOST PREDOMINANT COMMUNITY NEEDS. TWO DIFFERENT SURVEYS WERE DEVELOPED TO COLLECT A COMBINATION OF BOTH QUANTITATIVE AND QUALITATIVE DATA. A COMPREHENSIVE ONLINE COMMUNITY HEALTH SURVEY WAS CONDUCTED IN ORDER TO TAKE INTO ACCOUNT INPUT FROM PERSONS WHO REPRESENT THE BROAD INTERESTS OF THE COMMUNITY SERVED BY THE HOSPITAL. THE SURVEY ASKED PARTICIPANTS TO ""GRADE"" THEIR COMMUNITIES OVERALL HEALTH AND PROVIDE FEEDBACK ON ACCESS TO CARE, BEHAVIORAL HEALTH, CHRONIC DISEASE/HEALTH ISSUES, FAMILY ISSUES AND MODIFIABLE RISK FACTORS. IT ALSO ASKED THE PARTICIPANTS TO RANK THEIR ""TOP FIVE HEALTH CONCERNS"" FOR THE COMMUNITY. THE COMMUNITY WAS INVITED TO PARTICIPATE IN THE ONLINE SURVEY THROUGH A MEDIA RELEASE AND A PAID ADVERTISEMENT IN A LOCAL NEWSPAPER, THE HOSPITAL'S ELECTRONIC COMMUNITY NEWSLETTER ""A HEALTHIER YOU"", THE HOSPITAL'S ELECTRONIC VOLUNTEER AND EMPLOYEE NEWSLETTERS AND THROUGH SOCIAL MEDIA. THE SURVEY LINK, LOCATED ON THE HOME PAGE OF THE HOSPITAL'S WEBSITE (NCH.ORG), WAS OPEN FROM FEBRUARY 21 TO MARCH 14, 2018 AND 414 PEOPLE RESPONDED. IN ADDITION, AN ONLINE SURVEY FOR KEY INFORMANTS WAS CONDUCTED SPECIFICALLY TO SOLICIT INPUT FROM KEY INFORMANTS AS DESCRIBED IN PART V, SECTION B, QUESTION 5. IN APRIL 2018, THE HOSPITAL CONVENED AN INTERNAL, MULTIDISCIPLINARY COMMITTEE WHICH MET MULTIPLE TIMES TO REVIEW THE RESULTS OF THE COMMUNITY HEALTH NEEDS ASSESSMENT, AFFIRM AND PRIORITIZE NEEDS AND TO IDENTIFY THE MOST QUALIFIED INTERNAL AND EXTERNAL PERSONS TO DEVELOP IMPLEMENTATION PLANS TO ADDRESS EACH PRIORITY NEED.

IN ADDITION, THE CHAIRMAN OF THE NCH BOARD OF DIRECTORS AND THE EXECUTIVE VICE PRESIDENT CHIEF LEGAL COUNSEL PARTICIPATED IN THE COMMITTEE. THE COMMITTEE MEMBERS RECEIVED A SUMMARY AND COMPARISON DOCUMENT WHICH WAS USED AS A TOOL TO REVIEW ALL OF THE QUANTITATIVE AND QUALITATIVE FINDINGS. THE FINDINGS FROM THE FOCUS GROUPS, COMMUNITY SURVEY AND KEY INFORMANT SURVEY WERE COMPARED AND THE SECONDARY DATA PROVIDED SUPPLEMENTAL INFORMATION. THE MOST COMMON THEMES AND COMMENTS FROM THE NARRATIVE PORTION OF THE SURVEYS WERE ALSO HIGHLIGHTED IN THE DOCUMENT. IN ADDITION, THE COMMITTEE WAS GIVEN WEB ACCESS TO THE COMPLETE SURVEY RESULTS, FOCUS GROUPS SUMMARIES AND ALL SECONDARY DATA. THE COMMITTEE WAS GIVEN TWO WEEKS TO REVIEW THE SUMMARY AND COMPARISON DOCUMENT AND TO ACCESS THE ADDITIONAL RESOURCES AND THEN RECONVENED TO RANK OR PRIORITIZE THE ISSUES. THE COMMITTEE USED MAGNITUDE, IMPACT/SERIOUSNESS, FEASIBILITY AND CONSEQUENCES OF INACTION AS THE CRITERIA TO IDENTIFY WHICH HEALTH NEEDS WOULD BE ADDRESSED OVER THE NEXT THREE YEARS. TAKING INTO ACCOUNT HOSPITAL RESOURCES AND OVERALL ALIGNMENT WITH THE HOSPITAL'S MISSION, GOALS AND STRATEGIC PRIORITIES - IT WAS DETERMINED THAT NCH WOULD FOCUS THE MAJORITY OF ITS EFFORTS ON DEVELOPING AND/OR SUPPORTING STRATEGIES AND INITIATIVES TO IMPROVE THE FOLLOWING PRIORITY AREAS: ACCESS TO CARE FOR THE UNDER-RESOURCED, BEHAVIORAL HEALTH (MENTAL HEALTH AND SUBSTANCE ABUSE), OBESITY/PHYSICAL ACTIVITY/WEIGHT, CANCER (SMOKING/TOBACCO) AND CHRONIC DISEASE (DIABETES, HEART DISEASE, STROKE, RESPIRATORY AND KIDNEY). INTERNAL COMMITTEES WERE FORMED TO DEVELOP IMPLEMENTATION PLANS FOR EACH OF THE PRIORITY AREA AS DESCRIBED IN PART V, SECTION C, QUESTION 11. THE COMMUNITY HEALTH NEEDS ASSESSMENT AND IMPLEMENTATION PLAN WAS REVIEWED AND APPROVED BY THE COMMUNITY HEALTH AND OUTREACH COMMITTEE OF THE BOARD ON JUNE 13, 2018 AND PRESENTED TO THE ENTIRE BOARD OF DIRECTORS ON JUNE 25, 2018. IT WAS ALSO PRESENTED FOR APPROVAL TO THE COMMUNITY BENEFIT REGULATORY COMMITTEE, A COMMITTEE THAT ENSURES THE HOSPITAL IS MEETING ALL OF THE MANDATED REGULATORY REQUIREMENTS ON JUNE 12, 2018.

THE IMPLEMENTATION PLAN IS ASSESSED AND UPDATED ON THE HOSPITAL'S WEBSITE ON AN ANNUAL BASIS. THE WEBSITE ALSO HAS A LINK WHICH PROVIDES THE COMMUNITY WITH THE OPPORTUNITY TO OFFER COMMENTS AND FEEDBACK ABOUT THE ASSESSMENT AND/OR IMPLEMENTATION PLAN. NO COMMENTS HAVE BEEN RECEIVED SINCE THE COMMUNITY HEALTH NEEDS ASSESSMENT AND IMPLEMENTATION PLAN WERE POSTED. THE HOSPITAL WILL PROVIDE ANY INDIVIDUAL REQUESTING A COPY OF THE WRITTEN REPORT WITH THE DIRECT WEBSITE ADDRESS, OR URL, WHERE THE DOCUMENT CAN BE ACCESSED. NCH WILL ALSO MAINTAIN AT ITS FACILITIES A HARD COPY OF THE REPORTS THAT MAY BE VIEWED BY ANY WHO REQUEST IT. AS MENTIONED PREVIOUSLY, THE HOSPITAL MAINTAINS A FULL TIME COMMUNITY SERVICES DEPARTMENT WHO IS IN CONSTANT COLLABORATION WITH COMMUNITY ORGANIZATIONS, LOCAL GOVERNMENT, SCHOOLS, CHURCHES AND SOCIAL SERVICE AGENCIES TO IDENTIFY AND ADDRESS UNMET NEEDS. THE EXECUTIVE DIRECTOR OF THE COMMUNITY SERVICES DEPARTMENT IS ON THE BOARD OF DIRECTORS OF PARTNERS FOR OUR COMMUNITIES (POC), A LOCAL NOT FOR PROFIT THAT HELPS THE HOSPITAL RUN A COMMUNITY RESOURCE CENTER IN THE HOSPITAL'S PRIMARY SERVICE AREA.

This report also includes the annual financial commitment of the local system to the community, detailing monetary contributions for government sponsored healthcare shortfall, community benefit programs and charity care at cost. This report is available to the public each year on or around January 24, commemorating Founding Day of the Sisters of Bon Secours. This report is available online at https://bonsecours.com/richmond/about-us."
201941929349300504,540793767,"Part I, Line 7:","Part I, line 7a: Charity Care at cost is computed by applying a cost-to-charge ratio to the aggregate charity adjustments recorded in the general ledger. Part I, line 7b: Unreimbursed Medicaid is computed by determining the cost of Medicaid services supplied less payments received for these services. To determine the cost of Medicaid services provided, a cost-to-charge ratio is applied to traditional and managed Medicaid gross charges captured in the patient accounting system and general ledger. Payments include payments for individual claims, payments from the Medicaid program paid outside the claim process (such as medical education payments) and expected or actual cost report settlements.For Part I, Line 7 a-c computations: The cost-to-charge ratio is derived using the suggested computation in Worksheet 2, Ratio of Patient Care Cost-to-Charges. Operating expenses and Gross patient charges are taken from the general ledger. Expenses for nonpatient care activities recorded in operating expenses are approximated as directly equaling other operating revenue, assuming these activities do not provide profit. Part I, line 7e: Community health improvement services and community benefit operations are accumulated throughout the year and reported at actual cost in a software program that specifically addresses this purpose.Part I, line 7f: Health professions education cost is determined as the direct and indirect cost of qualifying education activities as traditionally reported in columns 21-24 on Worksheet B of the Medicare cost report as a Medical Education program, nursing school or other allied health program."

Estimates are based on historical collection rates.When an uninsured patient is billed for patient care services, the charges are automatically discounted and the patient is requested to only pay the amount after discount. The discount is recorded as an adjustment to gross revenue and is not recorded in bad debt expense. If the balance after discount is not paid or not paid in full, the unpaid amount will be written off to bad debt expense. When a patient remits a payment on an account that has already been written off to bad debt expense, the payment is recorded as a recovery of bad debt, which reduces bad debt expense."
201941929349300504,540793767,"Part III, Line 3:","The organization does not report an estimate for the portion of bad debt expense that may have been likely to qualify for financial assistance under the hospital's charity care policy. The organization takes the position that ample opportunity and assistance is provided to the patient to qualify under the financial assistance policy. If sufficient information is not provided, the organization must assume the patient does not qualify."

201941929349300504,540793767,"Part III, Line 8:","Medicare allowable costs reflected in Part III come directly from the facility's Medicare cost report. The cost report segregates the total facility actual expenses into costs for support departments, clinical departments (routine and ancillary) and nonreimburseable departments. The cost report uses appropriate statistical bases to ""step down"" support costs to allowable clinical and nonreimburseable departments. The charges for clinical departments are matched to the total cost for these departments for a cost-to-charge ratio. Medicare-specific allowable costs for in- and outpatient ancillary departments are computed by applying the department-specific cost-to-charge ratio to the Medicare program charges by department. For routine departments, a per diem total cost is computed and applied to Medicare program days for the Medicare routine program cost.The organization feels the total shortfall of Medicare reimbursement compared to computed Medicare allowable costs should be treated as community benefit. The hospital improves access to patient care by providing services regardless of a patient's ability to pay or the hospital's ability to receive full cost reimbursement for services. The hospital also relieves the government of a financial burden when it provides care to publicly insured patients where reimbursement is less than cost of providing the service."

Collection efforts are not pursued on any pending FAP account.Specific criteria exists for how much financial assistance, partial or total, will be provided to the patient based on the assessed need. Criteria is based on Federal Poverty Guidelines and is reviewed and updated annually. Once a patient has been deemed eligible for the Patient Financial Assistance Program (FAP), the patient is notified by letter within 60 days after receipt of the application and supporting documentation. The patient retains eligibility for a period of eight months from the date of the application. This eligibility is identified by hospital admissions, billing and collection staff by the assignment of a specific financial class with accompanying eligibility dates.

The hospital facility is committed to creating healthier communities and understands that many state and federal mandated community benefit programs and services are not sufficent to address ethnic, racial and economic health disparities and inequities. The hospital embraces the traditional definition of ""health"" to include economic opportunity, affordable housing, quality education, safe neighborhoods, food security, social and racial justice, and the arts/culture - all elements that are needed for individuals, families and communities to thrive. The hospital provides many valuable services, resources, programs and financial support - beyond the walls of the hospital and into the communities and homes of the people we serve; including grants and sponsorship of local community-based organizations and the involvement of Baystate leadership with various community boards that align with our mission. Baystate Medical Center provided $215,023 as Payment in Lieu of Taxes (PILOT) to the City of Springfield for our facilities at 3400 Main Street & 11 Wilbraham Road.

The portion of bad debt that reasonably could be attributable to patients who may qualify for financial assistance under the hospital's charity care program (reported in Part III line 3) was calculated by applying the percentage of bad debts by zip code (for which the average household income for each zip code is less than 200% of the federal poverty level) to the total cost of bad debt reported in Part III line 2. Since this portion of bad debt is attributable to patients residing in an area where the average income is less than 200% of the Federal poverty level, it is highly likely these patients would have qualified for the organization's charity care program had they applied. For this reason, we believe the amount, totalling $798,637, should be treated as community benefit expense in Part I. As noted above, the organization adopted Accounting Standards Update 2011-07 effective October 1, 2012, which changed the way entities report and disclose certain financial information including the provision for bad debts. See footnote #2 (Significant Accounting Policies) on page 12 and 13 of the audited financial statements under the caption ""Allowance for Uncollectible Accounts"" for a description of the organization's reporting of its provision for bad debts.If a patient is determined eligible for financial assistance, the appropriate adjustment is made to the patient account based on their income level.

The hospital not only offers free and reduced cost care to the financially needy as required by law, but has also voluntarily established discount and financial assistance programs that provide additional free and reduced cost care to more patients residing within the communities served by the hospital.The hospital recognizes that the billing and collection process can be bewildering and burdensome for patients and has implemented procedures to make the process understandable for patients; to inform patients about discount and financial assistance options; and to ensure that patients are not subject to aggressive collection activities. Consistent with its patient commitment the hospital is required to maintain a financial assistance policy and a billing and collection policy that reflects its financial assistance options and patient billing and collection procedures and complies with applicable state and federal laws and regulations.The hospital has financial counselors available to help patients apply for financial assistance programs that may cover unpaid hospital bills, including a variety of federal and state programs as well as financial assistance through the hospital. Hospital financial counselors have all been trained and certified by the state as Certified Account Counselors to assist patients in applying for available state and federal programs. The hospital is committed to ensuring that patients or prospective patients in the community are aware of financial assistance programs. For uninsured or underinsured patients, the hospital will assist in applying for available financial assistance programs. The hospital notifies patients of the availability of assistance in both the initial bill sent to patients as well as in general notices posted throughout the hospital.When applicable, the hospital also assists patients in applying for coverage of services as a Medical Hardship based on the patient's documented income and allowable medical expenses. The hospital provides, upon request, specific information about the eligibility process to be a Low Income Patient under either the Massachusetts Health Safety Net Program or additional assistance for patients who are low income through BMC's own internal financial assistance program. The hospital also notifies patients about available payment plans based on their family size and income. Our Financial Assistance Policy and Billing and Collection Policy are posted on the baystatehealth.org website at https://www.baystatehealth.org/-/media/files/patients-and-visitors/billing-and-financial-assistance/baystate-health-hospitals-billing-collections-policy-91516.pdf?la=en. The goal of posting the Financial Assistance Policy and the Billing and Collection Policy is to ensure that patients or prospective patients in our community are aware of our financial assistance programs. Signs about the availability of financial assistance programs at the hospital are translated into Spanish, and Russian as Spanish and Russian are primarily spoken by more than 1000 residents or 1% of the residents in the hospital's service area. Signs are large enough to be clearly visible. Hospital signs are 8.5 x 11 inches and the header print font is 24 pts. Notice of availability of Financial Assistance Programs are posted in the following locations; inpatient, clinic, emergency department admissions and/or registration areas, central admission/registration area, patient financial counselor areas and business office areas that are open to patients."

Baystate Medical Center serves as a regional resource for specialty medical care and research, while providing comprehensive primary medical services to the community. The service area for Baystate Medical Center includes all 23 communities within Hampden County, including the third largest city in Massachusetts -- Springfield (population over 150,000). Three adjacent cities (Holyoke, Chicopee and West Springfield) create a densely-populated urban core that includes over half of the population of the service area (around 270,000 people). Smaller, suburban communities exist to the east and west of this central core area. Many of these communities have populations under 20,000 people. Urban areas, as defined by the U.S. Census Bureau consist of census tracts and/or blocks meeting the minimum population density requirement (2,500-49,999 for urban clusters and over 50,000 for urbanized areas) or are adjacent and meet additional criteria. The service area has more racial and ethnic diversity than many other parts of Western Massachusetts. County-wide, 22% of the population identifies as Hispanic or Latino, 9% Black or African American, and 2% as Asian (ACS, 2010-2014). However, this diversity is not equally spread throughout the region and tends to be concentrated in the urban core. The Pioneer Valley Transit Authority, the second largest public transit system in the state, serves 11 communities in the service area and connects suburban areas to the core cities and services. Paratransit service is also available for people with disabilities within 3/4 mile of a fixed route to facilitate access to medical care. Economically, the Baystate Medical Center service area is home to many of the largest employers in the region as well as numerous colleges and universities, and provides a strong economic engine for the broader region. The largest industries and employers include health care, service and wholesale trade and manufacturing. At the same time, the county struggles with higher rates of unemployment and poverty, lower household incomes and lower rates of educational attainment as compared to the state. The median household income in the service area is about $50,000 ($17,000 less than the state) (ACS 2010-2014). The poverty rate is more than 5% higher than that statewide, and the child poverty rate is an alarming 27%, more than 10% higher than the state rate (ACS, 2010-2014). Despite being at the core of the Knowledge Corridor region, only 26% of the population age 25 and over has a bachelor's degree. Hampden County's unemployment rate of 6.8% is higher than the state average of 4.9%. The unemployment rate is based on the number of people who are either working or actively seeking work. The median age for the service area is similar to that of Massachusetts, though the population over 45 years old is growing as a percentage of the total population."

In assessing a patient's inability to pay, the Hospital utilizes the generally recognized federal poverty income guidelines, but also includes certain cases where incurred charges are significant when compared to a responsible party's income and their countable assets. Those charges are not included in net patient service revenue for financial reporting purposes. Because the hospital is not paid for these services, they are considered to be community benefit. When private pay patients are sent to the collection agency their account is considered to be a bad debt. Subsequently, Medicaid may be granted for some of those patients. At that time those accounts would become charity care or a community benefit."

ADDITIONS TO THE ALLOWANCE FOR UNCOLLECTIBLE ACCOUNTS RESULT FROM THE PROVISION FOR UNCOLLECTIBLE ACCOUNTS. ACCOUNTS WRITTEN OFF AS UNCOLLECTIBLE ARE DEDUCTED FROM THE ALLOWANCE FOR UNCOLLECTIBLE ACCOUNTS. The Hospital's estimation of the allowance for uncollectible accounts is based primarily upon the type and age of the patient accounts receivable and the effectiveness of the Hospital's collection efforts. The Hospital's policy is to reserve a portion of all self-pay receivables, including amounts due from the uninsured and amounts related to co-payments and deductibles, as these charges are provided. On a monthly basis, the Hospital reviews its accounts receivable balances and various analytics to support the basis for its estimates. These efforts primarily consist of reviewing the following: Historical write-off and collection experience using a hindsight or look-back approach; Revenue and volume trends by payor, particularly the self-pay components; Changes in the aging and payor mix of accounts receivable, including increased focus on accounts due from the uninsured and accounts that represent co-payments and deductibles due from patients; Cash collections as a percentage of net patient revenue less the provision for uncollectible accounts; and Trending of days revenue in accounts receivable The Hospital regularly performs hindsight procedures to evaluate historical write-off and collection experience throughout the year to assist in determining the reasonableness of its process for estimating the allowance for uncollectible accounts. The Hospital's primary concentration of credit risk is patient accounts receivable, which consists of amounts owed by various governmental agencies, insurance companies and private patients."
201942279349300919,060646597,"PART III, LINE 8 - EXPLANATION OF SHORTFALL AS COMMUNITY BENEFIT","Danbury Hospital's Medicare shortfall should be treated as a community benefit as the organization strives to provide 24/7 coverage, improved patient access, highest clinical quality as well as addressing the needs of the community by offering critical services to our geographic area. As a result, the organization must balance the cost of these programs against the continued decreasing government reimbursement levels, uninsured population and community needs. A cost accounting system is used to calculate the shortfall, which is Medicare Net Patient Revenue less applicable costs. Part III, Line 9b - Provisions On Collection Practices For Qualified Patients It is the policy of Danbury Hospital to provide ""Financial Assistance"" (either free care or reduced patient obligations) to persons or families where: (i) there is limited or no health insurance available; (ii) the patient fails to qualify for governmental assistance (for example Medicare or Medicaid); (iii) the patient cooperates with the Hospital in providing the requested information; (iv) the patient demonstrates financial need; and (v) Danbury Hospital makes an administrative determination that Financial Assistance is appropriate. After the Hospital determines that a patient is eligible for Financial Assistance, the Hospital will determine the amount of Financial Assistance available to the patient by utilizing the Charitable Assistance Guidelines, which are based upon the most recent federal poverty guidelines. Danbury Hospital shall regularly review this Financial Assistance Policy to ensure that at all times it: (i) reflects the philosophy and mission of the Hospital; (ii) explains the decision processes of who may be eligible for Financial Assistance and in what amounts; and (iii) complies with all applicable state and federal laws, rules, and regulations concerning the provision of financial assistance to indigent patients. Consistent with this mission, Danbury Hospital recognizes its obligation to the community it serves to provide financial assistance to indigent persons within the community. In furtherance of its charitable mission, Danbury Hospital will provide both (i) emergency treatment to any person requiring such care; and (ii) essential, non-emergent care to patients who are permanent residents of its primary service area who meet the conditions and criteria set forth in this Policy, without regard to the patients' ability to pay for such care. Elective procedures generally will not be considered essential, non-emergent care and usually will not be eligible for Financial Assistance. Danbury Hospital will collect from individuals on financial assistance if they received a partial charitable discount. All patients can apply for charitable care on balances they feel that they cannot afford. Part VI, Line 2 - Needs Assessment Part VI, Line 2: Needs Assessment: Through Western CT Health Networks annual Planning Process, an environmental assessment is conducted to identify healthcare gaps and"

These forces are considered and incorporated in meeting the healthcare needs of the community by helping to frame the priorities, goals and initiatives of Western CT Health Networks long range and annual strategic plans. In 2018, Danbury Hospital, along with the Community Action Planning Steering Committee consisting of various community members, began the process for the next CHNA cycle. A meeting was held in January with DataHaven and other local hospitals and healthcare organizations to discuss the Community Wellbeing Survey, its content, and areas that will be targeted. Further planning will take place throughout the year. Part VI, Line 3 - Patient Education of Eligibility for Assistance PART VI,LINE 3: The Hospital has messages on all statements providing information regarding how the patient can get assistance with their hospital bill. Also signs are posted throughout the hospital and counselors are available to provide further assistance. All uninsured inpatients are interviewed by financial counselors and assessed for eligibility for assistance programs. The hospital provides informational handouts to all uninsured patients at the time of registration which refers them to financial counseling if they would like assistance with their bills. Further, the hospital mails notices to all self-pay accounts referring them to financial counseling if they need assistance. The collection department will also refer patients to financial counseling when a patient indicates that they cannot afford their balances; and finally, schedulers refer uninsured patients to financial counseling prior to their test or procedure. The policy and applications for assistance are also available on line, as well as upon request at the hospital. Part VI, Line 4 - Community Information Part VI, Line 4: Community Information: Danbury Hospital and New Milford Hospital campuses serve an area with a population of about 265,000 people. The Primary Service Area includes Bethel, Bridgewater, Brookfield, Danbury, New Fairfield, New Milford, Newtown, Ridgefield, and Southbury (in CT). This service area is comprised of a densely populated core of the urban/suburban City of Danbury surrounded by moderately affluent residential and rural towns. Danbury is also listed as a Medically Underserved Area, or MUA. Danbury has a median household income of $67,430 and a poverty rate of 11.2%, while New Milford has a household income of $81,350 and a poverty rate of 6.3%. The overall uninsured population rate for the state is estimated to be 6%. The population of the primary service areas is expected to remain stable from 2010 to 2020, the cohort aged 65 and over is expected to have a compound annual growth rate of approximately 2.0% in Danbury and 4.0% in New Milford."
201942279349300919,060646597,"Part VI, Line 4 - Community Building Activities","Schedule H, PART II: COMMUNITY BUILDING ACTIVITIES: Relates to Line #3, Community Support and Line #6, Coalition Building, totaling $76,523: In conducting the current CHNA, Danbury Hospital collaborated with various community organizations to develop, implement, and monitor strategies to address identified priorities in the CHIP. Workgroups were created for chronic disease, mental health/substance abuse, access, and healthy aging. The community benefit in the Coalition Building category was provided through planning and development meetings, as well as programs for each priority area: Chronic Disease: The Coalition for Healthy Kids (20 community partners) was formed in 2009, and launched two initiatives to address rising childhood obesity rates. The Go! 5-2-1-0 Wellness Initiative and Students Can Run and Move (SCRAM) initiative focus on low income Hispanic children attending Title 1 elementary schools. In year 1 (2015 to 2016) Go! Engaged 1,351 children ages 2-19 and their parents in healthy eating and physical activity engagement opportunities. In Year two-2754 children and parents, Year 3- 2219 children and parents In our current cycle, October 2018 to September 30, 2019 (year 4) the program has already out-reached 3519 adults, families and children with direct programs and strategic initiatives that includes Go! 5-2-1-0 murals in Danbury elementary school cafeterias. These numbers do not include the outreach made by our 7 pediatric healthcare partners (17,300 patients). Go! 5-2-1-0 Program has signed memorandums of understanding with 39 community sector sites in Danbury, including Childcare, After school, Camp programs, local pediatricians, and Danbury Public Schools. A spring 2018 agency survey revealed policy work around screen time and support for breastfeeding were new priorities of focus. Efforts are underway to improve these policies in the childcare and after school sectors and include training programs offered in collaboration with EdAdvance and the Regional YMCA of Western CT. The Students Can Run and Move Program (SCRAM) is an after school program that has reached over 2,900 children (2011 to 2019) with after school programming offering 45 minutes of physical activity after school and weekly nutrition lessons including garden education spring and summer. A fully funded program offers 90 hours of PA fitness programming per year, access to healthy snacks, and nutrition education. The program also educates families using the Go! 5-2-1-0 wellness message to reinforce healthy behaviors at home. Both Go! 5-2-1-0 and SCRAM are grant funded initiatives and future success depends on adequate funding. Funding availability for 2020 is currently unknown. All childhood obesity initiatives were successful in reaching children in various settings and improving fitness levels and BMI 33% from 2012-2016 for all students participating. Chronic Disease Prevention Sub-Committee- Greater Danbury includes local health directors. The 2016-2019 Chronic Disease Prevention Strategy Plan included support and referral for the YMCAs Diabetes Prevention program and Blood Pressure Self-Monitoring Program both offered for adults in English and Spanish. Over 3000 health screens are completed annually in Greater Danbury by local health departments and VNA partners to increase awareness of health risks. An emphasis in the current strategic plan was added to target fall prevention initiatives including Moving for Better Balance championed by Pomperaug Health District and Enhance fitness championed by the YMCA. A Danbury Pilot program lead by WCHN Sandra Gianvito and Matt Cassavecchia with Danbury Ambulance was launched summer of 2018. The sub-committee also conducted an inventory of all community prevention and maintenance programs, bridging the gap between healthcare and CPMP, and expanding health equity for low income populations through grants for Evidence Based Health Initiatives. Data Haven was contracted to conduct Self-reported health data in 2015 and again in 2018. (www.datahaven.org). Diabetes rate declined from 9% on 2015 to 7% in 2018. Diabetes rates for Danbury adults over 55+ declined from 14% to 10% and for those earning less than $75,000 per year from 25% to 16% in the same time period. During that time frame more than 250 Danbury residents participated in the year- long YMCA DPP Program many subsidized through grant funded programs offered by the Regional YMCA of Western CT. Community Health Resource Guide: In 2018 a Guide was developed and distributed to physicians and healthcare providers to refer their patients to existing community health programs. All inventoried community health programs were uploaded to the CT 211 information web portal for on line search and access. Mental Health and Substance Abuse: In January 2015, Danbury Hospital launched a community care team with the goal of targeting mental health and substance abuse populations. The formation of the Greater Danbury Community Care Team (CCT) has allowed us to deliver enhanced care to individuals with complex medical and psychosocial challenges. This broad community initiative provides wrap around services to individuals with housing instability suffering from mental health and/or substance abuse issues or serious medical conditions. Danbury Hospital's Greater Danbury CCT consists of approximately 35 representatives from local programs, agencies and institutions. The CCT meets weekly in the community to develop, review, implement, and monitor treatment plans for vulnerable populations. The CCT Navigator works to improve outcomes by referring targeted individuals to appropriate community-based mental health and substance abuse services and serving as a liaison to coordinate and leverage existing community-based resources. As of September 30, 2018, individualized care plans have been developed for more than 181 individuals. Outcomes for patients with care plans in place include maintained sobriety, mental health stabilization, improved access to care, a 30% reduction in inappropriate Emergency Department (ED) visits and reduced homelessness with more than 82 individuals assisted in finding stable housing. Healthy Aging: Healthy aging is core work for this initiative is accomplished though collaboration efforts of the Age Well Community Council, focused on supporting those planning for healthy aging and those managing immediate needs for services and support. Their goal is to enhance education, advocacy, access, and communication to support ability of seniors to age in place. Initiatives include the CT Healthy Living Collective, Aging Mastery Program, and Living Well with Diabetes. Related to Line #2, Economic Development, and Line #7, Community Health Improvement Advocacy totaling $4,490: Various WCHN officials participated in Chamber of Commerce meetings and events, working to promote economic development in the Danbury Hospital area. State and local elected officials and agency heads were lobbied in support of maintaining patient access to essential services for the uninsured and under insured. The total Advocacy Investment for FY2018 is $58,161, which includes indirect and direct staffing expenses."

RESEARCH HAS CONTINUALLY SHOWN THAT WHEN THE FACTORS INFLUENCING HEALTH ARE EXPLORED, HEALTH CARE ACTUALLY PLAYS THE SMALLEST ROLE PROPORTIONATELY. A REPORT IN THE JOURNAL OF AMERICAN MEDICAL ASSOCIATION AND THE CENTER FOR DISEASE CONTROL (MCGINNIS, 1996) SUGGESTS THAT THE FACTORS IMPACTING HEALTH ARE AS FOLLOWS: LIFESTYLE AND BEHAVIORS, 50%, ENVIRONMENT (HUMAN AND NATURAL), 20%, GENETICS AND HUMAN BIOLOGY, 20%, AND HEALTH CARE, 10%. COMMUNITY BUILDING ACTIVITIES HELP TO ADDRESS THE OTHER INDICATORS OUTSIDE OF THE ROLE TRADITIONALLY PLAYED BY HEALTH-CARE ORGANIZATIONS. THESE ACTIVITIES ARE ALMOST EXCLUSIVELY DONE IN SOME FORM OF PARTNERSHIP IN WHICH THE COMMUNITY OR OTHER ORGANIZATIONS ARE BETTER SUITED TO ADDRESS. HEALTH-CARE ORGANIZATIONS GENERALLY PROVIDE TIMELY AND SPECIFIC RESOURCES TO HELP THESE ISSUES. HEALTH-CARE ORGANIZATIONS CAN BE A RICH AND VALUABLE COMMUNITY RESOURCE IN WAYS NOT TYPICALLY CONSIDERED. OFTEN THE MOST EFFECTIVE WAY TO HELP IMPACT AND IMPROVE THE COMMUNITY HEALTH STATUS IS TO SUPPORT OTHER AGENCIES AND ORGANIZATIONS IN A VARIETY OF WAYS OUTSIDE OF HEALTH SERVICES. THIS IS OFTEN DONE THROUGH CASH OR IN-KIND SERVICES TO SUPPORT OTHER NON-PROFITS, DONATIONS OF DURABLE MEDICAL EQUIPMENT AND SUPPLIES TO CERTAIN AGENCIES, OR THROUGH LEADERSHIP AND EDUCATIONAL EXPERTISE. THE HOSPITAL CONTRIBUTES FINANCIALLY TO A WIDE VARIETY OF COMMUNITY ORGANIZATIONS THAT ADDRESS THE BROADER NEEDS OF THE COMMUNITY.

SINCE COMPLETION OF THE CHNA, BRYAN HEALTH HAS EXPANDED ITS USE OF NURSE NAVIGATORS TO INCLUDE THREE ONCOLOGY NAVIGATORS THAT FOCUS ON PATIENTS WITH LUNG, BREAST, AND COLORECTAL CANCER. BRYAN ALSO PROVIDES PATIENT NAVIGATORS FOR ORTHOPEDICS AND PULMONARY DISEASES. AS PART OF BRYAN HEALTH, BRYAN HEART HAS ALSO IMPLEMENTED HEART FAILURE NURSE NAVIGATORS TO IDENTIFY POTENTIAL CARE GAPS THAT CAN LEAD TO READMISSIONS. THESE INDIVIDUALS ASSIST PATIENTS AND THEIR FAMILIES TO MAKE INFORMED HEALTH CARE DECISIONS AND ACCESS APPROPRIATE HEALTHCARE SERVICES. BRYAN HEALTH ALSO CONTINUES TO SUPPORT COMMUNITY HEALTH CENTERS, SUCH AS BLUESTEM HEALTH AND CLINIC WITH A HEART, THAT SERVE INDIVIDUALS THAT MIGHT NOT OTHERWISE BE ABLE TO AFFORD PRIMARY CARE SERVICES. Beginning in 2018, BRYAN HEALTH HAS MADE PROGRESS IN DEVELOPING THE INFRASTRUCTURE NEEDED TO CREATE A MEDICAL HOME WITH THE ROLLOUT OF MYCHART, THE PATIENT PORTAL TIED TO EPIC, BRYAN HEALTH'S NEW ELECTRONIC HEALTH RECORDS SYSTEM. TO PROVIDE ADDITIONAL ACCESS TO PRIMARY CARE SERVICES, BRYAN HEALTH ALSO HAS CONTINUED ITS EZVISIT SERVICE, WHICH IS A VIRTUAL CARE MODEL WITH 24/7 ACCESS TO A NEBRASKA BOARD CERTIFIED PHYSICIAN VIA COMPUTER OR MOBILE DEVICE. BRYAN'S ED CONNECTIONS PROGRAM CONTINUES to find medical homes for patients who have been using the emergency department for their primary care. WITHIN LANCASTER COUNTY AND BEYOND, BRYAN HEALTH OFFERS ONLINE, MOBILE, AND ON-SITE SCREENINGS TO IDENTIFY INDIVIDUALS WITH HIGH-RISK FOR CERTAIN CONDITIONS AND TO ENSURE THEY GET TIMELY ACCESS TO PREVENTATIVE CARE. A SCREENING THAT HAS BEEN EMBRACED IS FOR FAMILY MEMBERS OF PATIENTS WITH BICUSPID AORTIC VALVE (BAV). Close relatives of those diagnosed with BAV also are at risk for an aneurysm of the aortic root and ascending aorta. Early detection is critical since up to 40 percent of BAV patients will experience complications by the time they reach 50. To assist with the lack of mental health providers and services in the vast underserved areas of the state, Bryan Health offers behavioral health evaluations via telehealth to several emergency department providers across the state. By providing this service we assist with providing a quality evaluation and plan recommendations that reduce preventable inpatient admissions and assignment to other higher levels of care. BRYAN HEALTH ALSO PARTNERS WITH MANY CITY OF LINCOLN DEPARTMENTS AS WELL AS PRIVATE BUSINESSES TO PROVIDE MOBILE SCREENINGS, EDUCATION AND HEALTH FAIRS. ONE OF THE MAJOR ACTIONS THAT BRYAN HEALTH HAS TAKEN TO INCREASE ACCESS IS THE DECISION SEVERAL YEARS AGO TO PROVIDE AN ADDITIONAL SUBSIDY FOR HEALTH INSURANCE PREMIUMS FOR BRYAN HEALTH EMPLOYEES UNDER A CERTAIN WAGE LEVEL. THIS PROGRAM WAS CREATED BECAUSE A LARGE GROUP OF LOWER WAGE EMPLOYEES ELECTED NOT TO ENROLL IN BRYAN'S INSURANCE PLAN, AND ELECTED TO REMAIN UNINSURED DUE TO PREMIUM COSTS. THE ADDITIONAL SUBSIDY HAS PROVIDED ACCESS TO INSURANCE FOR CLOSE TO 400 EMPLOYEES AND THEIR DEPENDENTS ON AN ANNUAL BASIS. WE BELIEVE THIS IS A SMALL STEP TOWARD ASSISTING UNINSURED INDIVIDUALS IN OUR COMMUNITY AS INSURED INDIVIDUALS GENERALLY HAVE BETTER ACCESS TO SERVICES. DURING 2017, BRYAN MEDICAL CENTER PROVIDED LIFE-SAVING PROCEDURES AND MEDICATIONS FOR 9,891 INDIVIDUALS WHO WERE NOT ELIGIBLE FOR ANY GOVERNMENT OR STATE SUPPORT, AND DID NOT HAVE THE FINANCIAL RESOURCES TO PAY THEIR HEALTH CARE SERVICES. THERE ARE MANY REASONS BEHIND LACK OF ACCESS TO HEALTH CARE SERVICES; THE SHORTAGE OF HEALTH CARE PROFESSIONALS IS JUST ONE OF THESE REASONS. BRYAN HEALTH IS A HUGE SUPPORTER OF EDUCATION FOR HEALTH CARE PROFESSIONALS - INCLUDING ONGOING FINANCIAL SUPPORT FOR: 1) THE BRYAN COLLEGE OF HEALTH SCIENCES, WITH MORE THAN 670 STUDENTS ENROLLED IN GRADUATE AND UNDERGRADUATE DEGREE PROGRAMS THROUGH BRYAN'S SCHOOL OF NURSING, HEALTH PROFESSION AND NURSE ANESTHESIA PROGRAMS, AND 2) THE LINCOLN MEDICAL EDUCATION PARTNERSHIP RESIDENCY PROGRAM FOR FUTURE PRIMARY CARE PROVIDERS. IN ADDITION, BRYAN ALSO SERVES AS A CLINICAL TRAINING SITE FOR A LONG LIST OF HEALTH CARE DISCIPLINES; INCLUDING RADIOLOGY, LAB, PHYSICAL THERAPY, PHARMACY, EMTS AND PARAMEDICS, ETC. THIS COMMITMENT TO EDUCATION OF THE NEXT GENERATION OF HEALTH CARE PROFESSIONALS ULTIMATELY IMPROVES ACCESS TO HEALTHCARE IN OUR REGION. MADONNA IS THE DESIGNATED ORGANIZATION IN THE LINCOLN COMMUNITY THAT PROVIDES HANDICAP-ACCESSIBLE BUS TRANSPORTATION FOR COMMUNITY MEMBERS TO/FROM DOCTORS' APPOINTMENTS, THERAPY AND OTHER OUTPATIENT APPOINTMENTS. BRYAN PROVIDES AN ANNUAL CONTRIBUTION OF $25,000 FOR THESE SERVICES SO THAT FINANCIALLY CHALLENGED MEMBERS OF OUR COMMUNITY WILL HAVE ACCESS TO MEDICAL CARE. MANY PRIVATE PRACTICE PHYSICIANS IN LINCOLN HAVE ELECTED NOT TO SERVE MEDICAID AND/OR MEDICARE PATIENTS IN THEIR OUTPATIENT CLINICS FOR FINANCIAL REASONS. BRYAN PHYSICIAN NETWORK PHYSICIANS ACCEPT MEDICAID/MEDICARE PATIENTS INTO THEIR PRACTICE BY POLICY; THEREFORE, AS BRYAN PHYSICIAN NETWORK CONTINUES TO EXPAND WITHIN THE COMMUNITY, SO DOES ACCESS TO PHYSICIAN CARE FOR AREA MEDICAID/MEDICARE PATIENTS. THE COMMUNITY HEALTH ENDOWMENT (CHE) IS THE DESIGNATED ORGANIZATION IN LINCOLN TO COORDINATE A WIDE VARIETY OF COMMUNITY HEALTH EFFORTS TO FURTHER THE HEALTH AND SAFETY OF THE COMMUNITY. CHE'S MISSION IS FOR LINCOLN TO BE THE HEALTHIEST CITY IN THE NATION. BRYAN FULLY SUPPORTS CHE's WORK. Continued Below."

FURTHERMORE, BRYAN HEALTH SUPPORTS EFFORTS IN THE COMMUNITY TO PROVIDE AN INTEGRATED BEHAVIORAL HEALTH SAFETY NET AND EXPAND ACCESS TO BEHAVIORAL HEALTH PROVIDERS WHO SERVE POOR, UNINSURED, AND MEDICAID ELIGIBLE POPULATIONS. THESE EFFORTS INCLUDE PROVIDING A SEGREGATED MENTAL HEALTH EMERGENCY DEPARTMENT STAFFED WITH SPECIALLY TRAINED BEHAVIORAL HEALTH NURSES, SOCIAL WORKERS AND PEER SPECIALISTS. In order to further leverage these specially trained staff to assist with the lack of mental health providers and services in the vast underserved areas of the state, Bryan Health offers behavioral health evaluations via telehealth to several emergency department providers across the state. By providing this service we assist with providing a quality evaluation and plan recommendations that reduce preventable inpatient admissions and assignment to other higher levels of care. IN A SPECIAL PROJECT, BRYAN HEALTH'S MENTAL HEALTH EMERGENCY DEPARTMENT HAS PARTNERED WITH SEVERAL COMMUNITY PROVIDERS TO CREATE COMMUNITY PLANS FOR AN IDENTIFIED HIGH USER PATIENT GROUP TO AIDE IN PREVENTING REPEAT HOSPITAL INPATIENT ADMISSIONS. ALSO IN THIS AREA, BRYAN HEALTH UTILIZES PEER SPECIALISTS WHO HOLD THREE COMMUNITY WELLNESS GROUPS A WEEK AT NO COST TO THE PARTICIPANTS. THIS INCLUDES A SEPARATE GROUP FOR AGES 14-18. AS THE ONLY ACUTE CARE HOSPITAL IN LINCOLN PROVIDING BEHAVIORAL HEALTH SERVICES, BRYAN ACTIVELY ENGAGES WITH AREA PROVIDERS TO SUPPORT THE EXPANDED ROLE OF BEHAVIORAL HEALTH TREATMENT IN THE COMMUNITY AND REGION. BRYAN HAS MADE IT A PRIORITY TO SERVE AS A TRAINING SITE FOR COUNSELORS, SOCIAL WORKERS, NURSES, PHYSICIAN ASSISTANTS, AND PRIMARY CARE PHYSICIANS THROUGH THE LINCOLN MEDICAL EDUCATION PROGRAM, SOUTHEAST COMMUNITY COLLEGE, DOANE COLLEGE, BRYAN COLLEGE OF HEALTH SCIENCES, UNIVERSITY OF NEBRASKA AND OTHER EDUCATIONAL INSTITUTIONS. ONLINE SCREENINGS FOR DEPRESSION, ANXIETY, POST-TRAUMATIC STRESS DISORDER, ALCOHOL ABUSE AND ADOLESCENT DEPRESSION ARE AVAILABLE AT NO COST TO THE PUBLIC ON THE BRYAN HEALTH WEBSITE. FINALLY, BRYAN HEALTH WORKS WITH OTHER LINCOLN PROVIDERS AND GROUPS ACROSS THE STATE TO ADDRESS GAPS AND SPECIAL NEEDS IN THE POPULATION AS WELL AS THOSE WHO ARE UNDERSERVED. THESE INCLUDE HEALTH 360 INTEGRATED HOME; THE BRIDGE BEHAVIORAL HEALTH TO IMPROVE COORDINATION OF CARE FOR CLIENTS REQUIRING EMERGENCY DETOXIFICATION; THE BEHAVIORAL HEALTH EDUCATION CENTER OF NEBRASKA FOR WORKFORCE DEVELOPMENT OF Behavioral Health Providers; and Nebraska Department of Health and Human Services. WE ARE PROUD TO CO-SPONSOR AND HOST MENTAL ILLNESS AWARENESS WEEK TO PROVIDE COMMUNITY EDUCATION WITH ADDITIONAL OFFERINGS THROUGHOUT THE YEAR ON TOPICS SUCH AS, TRAUMA INFORMED CARE, ELDER ABUSE, GUARDIANSHIPS, Chronic pain and opioid use, NE Prescription Drug Monitoring System, Holistic Self-Care, ETC. BRYAN MEDICAL CENTER MENTAL HEALTH HAS BEEN A LEADER IN SUICIDE PREVENTION FOR OUR COMMUNITY AND STATE. ONE OF THE MANAGERS FOR BRYAN MENTAL HEALTH helped to start the Nebraska State Suicide Prevention Coalition in 1999 and continues to SERVE on the Executive Committee AS THE past CO-CHAIR OF THE NEBRASKA STATE SUICIDE PREVENTION COALITION AND SERVES ON THE LEADERSHIP GROUP of THE LINCOLN SUICIDE PREVENTION coalition. IN ADDITION, THIS BRYAN MENTAL HEALTH MANAGER PROVIDED LEADERSHIP IN DEVELOPING THE FIRST LOCAL OUTREACH TO SUICIDE SURVIVORS (LOSS) TEAM IN NEBRASKA AND IS ASSISTING WITH PROVIDING DIRECTION IN THE DEVELOPMENT OF LOSS TEAMS IN OTHER PARTS OF THE STATE. Additional teams have been developed in Omaha, Kearney and Norfolk. Plans are to have a LOSS team developed in each of the six behavioral health regions by 2019. DEVELOPING AND IMPLEMENTING THE LOSS TEAM WAS A COLLABORATIVE EFFORT IN WORKING WITH LAW ENFORCEMENT AND POLICE CHAPLAINS AS WELL AS OTHER COMMUNITY AND COUNTY AGENCIES. A LOSS TEAM IS A GROUP OF THREE PEOPLE WHO ARE ONCALL (TWO PEOPLE WHO HAVE LOST SOMEONE TO SUICIDE AND A CLINICIAN) AND THEY RESPOND TO FAMILIES WHO HAVE LOST SOMEONE TO SUICIDE AND PROVIDE RESOURCES. CONNECTING SUICIDE SURVIVORS TO OTHER SUICIDE SURVIVORS AND RESOURCES IS CONSIDERED SUICIDE POSTVENTION WHICH IS ALSO PREVENTION. Continued Below."

THE MEDIAN INCOME IN LANCASTER COUNTY WAS ESTIMATED AT $53,730, AND 14.3% OF THE POPULATION HAD FAMILY INCOMES BELOW THE POVERTY LEVEL. THE PERCENT OF UNINSURED ADULTS AGED 18 TO 64 in the state of Nebraska HAS BEEN ESTIMATED AT A RATE OF 12.6% IN 2017. CANCER REMAINED THE LEADING CAUSE OF DEATH FOR LANCASTER COUNTY IN 2016, FOLLOWED BY HEART DISEASE, CHRONIC LUNG DISEASE, CEREBROVASCULAR DISEASE, ALZHEIMER'S DISEASE, ACCIDENTAL DEATHS AND RENAL DISEASE. BRYAN AND CHI HEALTH-ST. ELIZABETH ARE THE PRIMARY HOSPITALS SERVING LANCASTER COUNTY. THE CENSUS BUREAU REPORTS THAT THE COUNTY'S POPULATION GREW FROM 250,291 IN 2000 TO AN ESTIMATED 314,358 IN 2017. POPULATION IS PROJECTED TO BE OVER 412,000 BY 2040, WITH GROWTH EXPECTED AMONG ALL MAJOR AGE GROUPS. THE 65 AND OVER AGE GROUP IS PROJECTED TO HAVE THE HIGHEST RATE OF GROWTH, INCREASING FROM AN ESTIMATED 42,000 IN 2017 TO AN ESTIMATED 75,000 IN 2040.

201911299349302276,370663567,"Schedule H, Part II Community Building Activities","Community Building activities are programs that address underlying causes of health problems and thus improve health status and quality of life. They focus on root causes of health problems such as poverty, homelessness, and environmental hazards. These activities enhance community assets by offering the expertise and resources of the health care organization. Workforce (non-hospital) development: Bridges Connections District 201 Bridges Connections District 201 is designed to help special needs students learn marketable skills through on the job training. Up to three students receive two hours of supervised job training for each day during the school year. Each student progresses through a three-phase program. Bridges enhances this high-risk population's ability to be productive members of our community. The Bridges program has successfully transitioned two students into part-time colleagues at St. Elizabeth's. Providing opportunities to special needs young adults builds one's confidence and encourages them to seek employment. Leadership Development: Leadership Belleville Partnerships with community business leaders is an important part of furthering positive perceptions of St. Elizabeth's as a healing and caring organization. One HSHS St. Elizabeth's leader participated in many community functions to further convey our message of commitment to Southwestern Illinois. Leadership Belleville is a 9-month commitment and unique training program for individuals who have demonstrated high leadership qualities. HSHS St. Elizabeth's is committed to this program on an annual basis by hosting an event at the hospital and ensuring one leader is actively involved each year. Coalition Building: BASIC Initiative (Belleville Achieves Strength in Character) BASIC is a partnership of schools, the City of Belleville, and the business community to strengthen character in our youth and in the community. BASIC encourages youth and adults to be productive citizens in our community. The BASIC initiative is very active in the schools and builds a child's spirit of self-worth and value. HSHS St. Elizabeth's is an active board member of this organization. Annually, students and adults are recognized for service to the community, emphasizing the value of each awardee from all walks of life. Coalition Building: St. Clair County Health Commission St. Elizabeth's Hospital initiated practices that later became part of the health department when they formed in 1985. A member of St. Elizabeth's participates in the Health Care Commission. The Health Care Commission, founded in 1991, is a 20 plus member organization that serves as a public health system to establish priority health issues, mobilize resources to meet identified needs, and promote the health and well-being of the all-county residents. As a result of the policy summit in spring of 2017, a collective impact movement is now underway to address specific health issues in the county. Community Support: Emergency Management and Disaster Preparedness- St. Elizabeth's is a community leader for emergency management. Our EMS coordinator is on the advisory council for two counties and is certified by the National Incident Management System (NIMS) and Incident Command Structure (ICS). In conjunction with our sister hospital, St. Anthony Memorial Hospital in Effingham, he taught 84 students NIMS and ICS. However, it is his involvement in the Local Emergency Planning Committees (LEPC) that integrates and prepares St. Elizabeth's to respond effectively in a disaster. Three HSHS St. Elizabeth's colleagues trained in emergency management served as instructors and evaluators at a local full scale railroad derailment mass casualty exercise and a full scale active shooter exercise. In addition, St. Elizabeth's is now the St. Clair County EMS resource hospital. The EMS team provides local support for world events such as the 2017 eclipse, as well as Songs for Soldiers and the Belleville Marathon. Community Support: Pregnancy Care Center The hospital provides space for the Pregnancy Care Center (PCC) on the hospital campus. The PCC provides free services including pregnancy tests, referrals for medical care, WIC and other resource information; the hospital supports these efforts. In addition, the PCC provides clothing and supplies to those with financial needs. Due to the recent move of the hospital, the PCC moved into a renovated space that creates a warm and welcoming environment for their clients. The Mother Child Department collects items for the PCC and annually a community baby shower is held to obtain donations for the center; often colleagues give generously to this organization. Community Support: Social Agency Donations Food, hygiene products, and school supply drives were conducted in collaboration with local social agencies such as St Vincent DePaul, Catholic Urban Programs, the Violence Prevention Center. Seventy-six school back packs stuffed with school supplies were donated to colleagues' students in need and an additional 75 pounds were donated to the Violence Prevention Center, a women's shelter. HSHS St. Elizabeth's partners with the local blood services and provides a location for blood donation and contributes to incentives to encourage colleagues and the public to participate. A colleague also serves on the board for the Center of Autism. St. Elizabeth's has a positive long standing relationship with St. Vincent DePaul (SVDP) in East St. Louis. The building that houses Cosgrove's Soup Kitchen and a thrift store underwent a complete remodel, and needed many items. Through careful planning and inventorying of resources at the old facility and after the move, HSHS St. Elizabeth's facilitated the donation of numerous items needed for the renovation, thus reducing St. Vincent DePaul's overhead costs. The hospital also donated canned and frozen food, metal rolling racks, kitchen supplies, and paper products. With the hospital move from Belleville to O'Fallon, some equipment was either obsolete or incompatible with the new technology at the new hospital. This surplus allowed for generous donations to the community and HSHS Mission Outreach, our regional medical surplus partner. Mission Outreach received their largest donation ever from St. Elizabeth's Hospital. In addition, many local agencies benefited and obtained items that would either improve their work or make life more comfortable. Such agencies included the local health department, a high school, a priest retirement home and a low-income school. Community Health improvement and advocacy: Behavioral Health Care HSHS St. Elizabeth's is a member of the Metro-East Behavioral Health Network Council. This is a group of agencies within our community that share resources and implement new treatment strategies for our patients with psychiatric needs. Even though St. Elizabeth's does not have mental health services, it is aligned with area facilities and specialists that accommodate our patient population. To facilitate the care of mental health patients a mental health nurse practitioner is on staff to assess the needs of this patient population. Athletes Advantage Sports Medicine HSHS Athletes Advantage Sports Medicine provides certified athletic trainers to local schools. Although the program has been in effect for 15 years, HSHS St. Elizabeth's joined forces in 2017 by providing resources to two area high schools. The commitment to provide on-site, quality medical care to local athletes was and continues to be our goal. With the addition of the ImPACT Concussion program in 2015, Athletics Advantage provides baselines free of charge to partner schools. The Athletes Advantage team consists of certified athletic trainers, board-certified sports medicine physicians with over 30 years of combined experience and credentialed ImPACT consultants, board-certified orthopedic surgeons with specialties in sports medicine and fracture care, and licensed physical therapists with emphasis on rehabilitating sports injuries. they work in conjunction with the certified athletic trainers to ensure a comprehensive rehabilitation and timely return to activity. Community Building activities also included attending the Illinois Hospital Association Advocacy Day where staff and other local health care organizations met our legislators to discuss health care legislation."
201911299349302276,370663567,"Schedule H, Part III, Line 2 Bad debt expense - methodology used to estimate amount","Self-pay patients are screened for verification of no insurance coverage. Once verification of no coverage has been completed, the guarantors will be screened for charity or uninsured discounts based on income levels. Those guarantors who do not qualify for charity through the screening process will be asked to provide proof of income in the form of a recent pay stub and/or recent tax return to determine the level of uninsured discounting. If no proof of income is provided or a guarantor's income is greater than 201% of the federal poverty level, the appropriate discount according to the established criteria up to 600% of the federal poverty level will be applied. The amount of money not collected from those self-pay patients who are not eligible for charity care is reported as bad debt. Allowances for Doubtful Accounts have been recorded based on an historical matrix, using collectability percentages by payor and aging category in accordance with HSHS Executive Policy #F-23, Valuation of Net Accounts Receivable. Percentages are based on historical experience at the hospital and adjusted for known limitations. The Hospital reports bad debt in accordance with Generally Accepted Accounting Principles (GAAP)."
201911299349302276,370663567,"Schedule H, Part III, Line 3 Bad Debt Expense Methodology","The hospital strongly believes that its charity care, and the related community benefit obtained from such care, is understated because of those patients who potentially qualify for charity care but do not wish to apply for it. In addition, some care is not classified as charity because of missing documentation on patient resources. Thus, the hospital's bad debt includes a portion that could be classified as charity care if application for such care was sought and/or completed. While the hospital feels their bad debt expense includes amounts attributable to patients who would qualify for financial assistance under the hospital's financial assistance policy, the hospital is unable to estimate this amount."
201911299349302276,370663567,"Schedule H, Part III, Line 4 Bad debt expense - financial statement footnote",The text of the footnote to the organization's financial statements that describes bad debt expense can be found on page 20 of the HSHS Consolidated Audit Report.
201911299349302276,370663567,"Schedule H, Part III, Line 8 Community benefit & methodology for determining medicare costs","HSHS St. Elizabeth's Hospital continually strives to provide excellent patient care in the most cost effective fashion. Nonetheless, the Medicare program, in many cases, does not provide payment that covers the full cost of the care provided. Since it is the mission of the hospital to respond to community need, hospital management continually advocates for improved Medicare payment so that the cost of quality care to those patients who are not able to afford it is not compromised and is fairly subsidized by all payers. While this shortfall in Medicare payments is not classified as community benefit by the IRS, we nonetheless believe it is an important contribution made by the hospital to the health and well-being of the community. If the Medicare program did not exist, many Medicare patients would be eligible for charity care or other means-tested government programs. Further, by absorbing this payment shortfall and providing care below cost to these individuals, HSHS St Elizabeth's is relieving the burdens of the government. Accordingly, this shortfall restricts HSHS St Elizabeth's ability to make funds available to provide for charity care and other community benefits. The hospital Medicare shortfall at cost for fiscal year 2018 was $14,034,067."
201911299349302276,370663567,"Schedule H, Part III, Line 9b Collection practices for patients eligible for financial assistance","Every effort is made prior to, during and after provision of medical services to determine whether a patient is eligible for charity/community care and to assist the patient in completing the application and provide adequate documentation. If the patient qualified for charity/community care for the full balance of their account, the entire amount is written off to charity/community care and hence no debt collection is pursued. If the patient qualified for charity/community care for a portion of their account balance, that portion is written off to charity/community care, with the patient being responsible for the remainder of the balance. Additionally, reasonable effort will be made to obtain third-party or government payer reimbursement on behalf of the patient. If those efforts are not fruitful, an offer will be extended to the patient to make installment payments on their balance. Only at such point that the patient defaults on installment payments or refuses to cooperate with the hospital's efforts to be reimbursed will the account be sent to collections. The hospital will make reasonable efforts to determine whether a patient is eligible under the financial assistance policy before it engages in an ECA. To the extent a patient is determined to be eligible for financial assistance under the FAP, the hospital will take all reasonably available measures to reverse any ECA taken against the patient to obtain payment for the care."

Having this presence in the under-served community and having leaders committed to a variety of different community groups, the leaders hear about opportunities that allow the hospital to connect more effectively. Due to this participation, one leader serves on the steering committee of a newly formed nonprofit that serves low income areas. Because of our presence in the community, St. Elizabeth's is approached and asked to provide care, education or resources to under-served areas. The hospital also continually assesses the needs of the community through pre- and post-evaluations, patient surveys, the hospital advisory council, and patient family advisory council. in addition, colleagues who participate in community events complete a survey about their experience. The survey includes a place to add community connections and suggestions from other agencies who may ask us to participate in other events. The community can also visit the hospital's website and submit a request for hospital participation. The community benefit/hospital advisory council meets quarterly and discusses opportunities to community involvement."
201911299349302276,370663567,"Schedule H, Part VI, Line 3 Patient education of eligibility for assistance","HSHS St. Elizabeth's Hospital collaborates with our physician partners and financial assistance information is available in the Medical Group offices. Financial assistance posters are displayed in the registration and the emergency department waiting areas. During the registration process, a patient may request a financial assistance program brochure and application. This packet contains a letter identifying financial assistance opportunities offered to our patients as well as a financial assistance application. Information about the hospital's financial assistance policy is easily accessible on our website. The hospital has onsite advocates to assist patients with enrollment in several federal, state and local government programs. These advocates visit patients while in the hospital or contact them by phone once discharged. The advocates will also make home visits as needed in order to assist patients with enrollment as well as gathering necessary documents for application. If the patient is not eligible, the advocates refer them to our financial assistance program and they follow-up with the patients. HSHS St. Elizabeth's Hospital makes its financial assistance program brochure, application and standard response letters available in Spanish as well as English. Financial assistance program information is also available in English and Spanish on the hospital's website. Each billing statement that a patient receives contains information about our financial assistance program and a phone number for assistance with applying. Any patient visiting the onsite financial counselor, as well as contacting the hospital via phone, is given information about payment options including our financial assistance program options. Even after an account is sent to a collection agency, but no later than 12 months from placement, and/or anytime in the process they believe a patient may be eligible for financial assistance, the account is returned to the hospital for evaluation. Patients are also provided a Fair Billing Act notification at the point of registration regarding separate physician billing they can expect to receive, plus information about the patient's financial responsibility if their insurance plan is out of network. A system called Through Passport is used after failed attempts made by the hospital, but before sending to a collection agency. That system accesses credit and other information and allows us to see the probability of a patient being able to pay their bill. After assessing that information, the hospital determines whether to grant financial assistance or continue collection efforts."
201911299349302276,370663567,"Schedule H, Part VI, Line 4 Community information","HSHS St. Elizabeth's provides services for patients in four counties (St. Clair, Clinton, Madison, and Monroe counties), a total population of more than 600,000 residents. The FY2018 CHNA, however, focused on St. Clair County which has an approximate population of 262,000 which is slightly smaller that Madison County by 3,000 residents. It is the eighth most populous county in the state. However, both counties saw a decrease in population. St. Clair County lost approximately 3% of its residents. Clinton and Monroe counties have a population of 37,00 and 33,000 respectively and are considered rural counties. Belleville, the county seat for St. Clair County, has roughly 44,000 residents. St. Clair County is the oldest county in Illinois and its western border is formed by the Mississippi River and comprises 674 square miles and includes urban, suburban and rural areas. As an organization, HSHS St. Elizabeth's does not exclude Medically Under-served Areas (MUAs), low income or minority populations from its service area. Although the population is aging, the average age is 37.8 years old. The greatest shift in population occurred in the 65 years and older with an increase of 16.8% from the 2010 census. The younger population ages 18-64 and under 5 years of age showed a decline in population of 6% and 7 % respectfully. The population consists mostly of white (62.1%), African American (30.4%). All races and ethnicities increased except white (non-Hispanics). The Hispanic and Latino population showed a significant growth in 6 years with 29% increase in population. Native American group grew by 50%, however, overall the makeup is only 0.3% of the population. Along with the aging population comes increased health care costs with chronic disease studies showing that the health of the aging population can be maintained and chronic disease reduced by promoting healthy behaviors and expanding preventive health services. The average income is $50,006 in St. Clair county. Although it went up, it remains the lowest of the four counties in the service area. In addition, it is $9,000 and the 3% increase was also the lowest of the four counties. St. Clair county also suffers from a high rate of poverty with 18.23% living at 100% below the federal poverty line and 35% living at 200% below the federal poverty line. This is a 1% increase from the last CHNA. This indicator is relevant because poverty creates barriers to access health services, nutritional food and other necessities that contribute to poor health status. Of the four counties included in the St. Elizabeth's service area, all have a lower uninsured rate than the state. However, St. Clair County has a higher rate of uninsured children, a lower percentage of privately insured residents and a higher rate of publicly insured residents when compared to the state rate. In St. Clair county 9.2% of the population is uninsured. Of those who are insured 36.8% are publicly insured which is higher than the state average of 31%. Violent crime in St. Elizabeth's service area is almost double the state rate - 749 vs 397 per 100,000. Violent crime is defined as offenses involving face-to-face confrontation (e.g. assault, rape, robbery). Violent crime impacts health because it limits interaction with others, prevents children from playing outdoors, lacks community organization and creates chronic stress. Four hospitals serve the local community; one hospital in Belleville, the county seat for St. Clair County, has a satellite hospital in the community where St. Elizabeth's resides. In 2017 St. Elizabeth's built and moved into its replacement hospital in O'Fallon to meet and address the needs of the larger community and provide a higher level of care with the support of advanced technology. The aging facility in Belleville could no longer meet the needs of the area. A Federally Qualified Health Care Facility also serves southern Illinois and has a hospital with mental health services in the East St Louis area."
201911299349302276,370663567,"Schedule H, Part VI, Line 5 Promotion of community health","As a healing ministry of the Catholic Church and an affiliate of Hospital Sisters Health System (HSHS), HSHS St. Elizabeth's Hospital is committed to delivering high quality, compassionate, and cost-effective health care services to all. Founded in 1875, the hospital brings a healing presence and improves the health of our community, especially those persons who are sick, poor, and disadvantaged. Because of the hospital's mission and heritage, the hospital is dedicated to promoting the health of St. Clair County and surrounding areas. The hospital is governed by a board of directors, most of whom reside in the hospital's primary service area and who are neither employees nor independent contractors of the hospital (nor family members thereof). The board ensures that HSHS St. Elizabeth's is responding to community need. In FY2018, for example, the board reviewed and approved the Community Health Needs Assessment and Implementation Plan. They were impressed and look forward to hearing more about the collective impact project that is happening throughout the county called Healthier Together 2025. In addition, the hospital advisory/community benefit committee expanded membership to complement the CHNA priority needs. Along with this committee, the Foundation and our volunteer auxiliary group advocate on behalf of the hospital in the community. Consistent with its exempt purpose, St. Elizabeth's has an open medical staff with privileges available to all qualified physicians in the area. The hospital also operates an emergency department that is open 24 hours to all persons regardless of their ability to pay. As a not-for-profit hospital, St. Elizabeth's reinvests surplus funds to support the mission of the organization and promote the health of the community rather than distributing surplus funds as profits to shareholders or individuals. Funds not committed to ongoing operations are generally used to upgrade facilities, secure new technologies, improve patient care, and support initiatives designed to promote health and ensure access for all. Replacement Hospital HSHS St. Elizabeth's largest capital investment is the replacement hospital. With the support of the Hospital Sisters and HSHS, St. Elizabeth's began the journey many years ago, and completed the move on November 4, 2017. The investment in the new hospital was not merely an investment in bricks and mortar, but in state-of-the-art equipment and patient care. The 144-bed, patient centered facility is built on a 120-acre campus with an adjoining ambulatory care center. The new campus provides St. Elizabeth's with the opportunity to develop an integrated care delivery model that serves residents from across Southwestern Illinois from now and for decades to come. The hospital offers the latest technology in nearly every department. For example, the lab is automated and dramatically saves in the precious medical laboratory scientists (MLS) resources to complete the more advanced testing; pharmacy has an automatic dispensing unit; and ultrasound offers four-dimensional (4D) capability. When St. Elizabeth's transitioned to O'Fallon, we also changed our electronic health record (EHR) platform to EPIC. Although the change was significant, it enhanced the patient experience from all levels. By implementing EPIC, care providers have constant access to a patient's medical history, reducing the chance of errors. No matter where the patient had previously received treatment, the healthcare providers presently treating the patient will be able to see all the patient's medical history, including facilities where patients are referred outside of the HSHS system. Many of our referring hospitals or physicians utilize EPIC, thus allowing all providers the ability to impact the patient outcome through the whole continuum of care and assure that the patient is receiving timely and pertinent treatment. The transition to the new hospital included a state-of-the-art communication system, Vocera, which delivers secure, integrated, and intelligent communication solutions. It enables care teams to collaborate more efficiently and deliver the highest-quality care to our patients. The system alerts colleagues of a patient's change in status through a handheld device that records the patient's EKG. The nurse can then request additional resources through the escalation process with a touch of a button. Help is on the way in seconds! This patient centered-system is also integrated into the EHR. Medications scanned with the handheld device are automatically documented in EPIC. Colleagues communicate more efficiently; the Vocera message comes directly to them, and they can accept the call and problem-solve on the spot. The move to O'Fallon allowed the purchase of a hybrid operating room and to expand our cardiac program. This has proven to be very effective, and within a few short months the structural heart program expanded by adding new procedures to further improve the health of our patients and the community. Education St. Elizabeth's is a strong supporter of education and provides mentoring to individuals in the clinical disciples as well those outside of the clinical setting. In conjunction with St Louis University, Southern Illinois Health Foundation (FQHC), and Scott Air Force Base, the hospital supports a family practice residency. Other disciplines that receive on site education and mentoring include nursing, pharmacy, pharmacy informatics, respiratory, radiology, occupational, physical and speech therapies, and phlebotomy. Nonclinical education includes administrative secretary, medical records, and masters of health administration. Breast Health Awareness October is Breast Health Awareness month. Annually, HSHS St. Elizabeth's Hospital works to enhance community awareness and connect with the community to educate and raise awareness of the importance of breast health. In FY2018, the hospital partnered with the local newspaper, our regional HQHC, a local business, and the HSHS Southern Illinois Division to host a community Health Fair at the large local mall. the community health fair included breast health information, mammography scheduling, bone density screenings, cardiac and stroke information, blood pressure and BMI screenings, diabetes information with a diabetes risk assessment, and an on-demand glucose screening. In- Kind Donations for The Community, the Poor, and the Vulnerable St. Elizabeth's provides and donates a plethora of donations to various social and educational agencies. For example, conference room space is donated to a variety of organizations that are aligned with our mission and principles. An example of such space includes providing meeting space for support groups, blood drives, and housing the county morgue. St. Elizabeth's donates printing services and office supplies for two small local non-profit organizations. For many years, St. Elizabeth's provided space for the Pregnancy Care Center that provides free services to mothers and babies. Immunization Clinic for the Under-served Flu vaccines were provided to members in the community that were homeless or attended the soup kitchen. HSHS St. Elizabeth's Hospital also devotes significant resources to access for patients who cannot afford care, along with other Community Benefits. In FY2018, St. Elizabeth's provided more than $19.8 million in Community Benefit, including financial assistance at cost, unpaid costs of Medicaid and other public programs, and a range of diverse programs designed to enhance access and improve community health. Additionally, in FY2018, St. Elizabeth's provided $13.1 million (at cost) in uncompensated care to patients who did not qualify for charity care or public assistance and more than $14.0 million (at cost) in excess of Medicare payment for health care services. HSHS St. Elizabeth's Hospital provides a range of Community Benefit initiatives and programs that further our mission and long-standing commitment to our community. In many cases, these Community Benefits would not exist without the leadership role played by HSHS St. Elizabeth's and they often relieve a burden that would otherwise be carried by government."
