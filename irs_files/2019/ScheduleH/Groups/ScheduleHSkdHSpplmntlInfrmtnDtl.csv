201803199349318125,263162145,"Schedule H, Part I, Line 3c - Other Factors Used in Determining Elig.","IU Health Arnett uses several factors other than Federal Poverty Guidelines (""FPGs"") in determining eligibility for free care under its FAP. These factors include the following: 1. Indiana Residency Requirement Financial Assistance will only be made available to residents of the State of Indiana and those eligible for assistance under 42 U.S.C.A. 1396b(v). IU Health Arnett will employ the same residency test as set forth in Indiana Code 6-3-1-12 to define an Indiana resident. The term Resident includes any individual who was domiciled in Indiana during the taxable year, or any individual who maintains a permanent place of residence in Indiana and spends more than one hundred eight-three (183) days of the taxable year in Indiana. Patients residing in the state of Indiana while attending an institution of higher education may be eligible for assistance under the FAP if they meet the aforementioned residency test and are not claimed as a dependent on a parents or guardians federal income tax return. 2. IU Healths Individual Solutions Department Prior to seeking Financial Assistance under the FAP, all patients or their guarantors must consult with a member of IU Healths Individual Solutions department to determine if healthcare coverage may be obtained from a government insurance/assistance product or from the Health Insurance Exchange Marketplace. 3. Uninsured Patients All Uninsured Patients presenting for services at IU health Arnett eligible under the FAP will not be charged more than the AGB as described in the FAP. 4. Services Rendered by Individual Providers The FAP does not cover services rendered by individual providers. A full listing of providers and services not covered by the FAP is available at https://iuhealth.org/pay-a-bill/financial-assistance and is updated on a quarterly basis. 5. Alternate Sources of Assistance When technically feasible, a patient will exhaust all other state and federal assistance programs prior to receiving an award from IU Health Arnetts Financial Assistance Program. Patients who may be eligible for coverage under an applicable insurance policy, including, but not limited to, health, automobile, and homeowners, must exhaust all insurance benefits prior to receiving an award from IU Health Arnetts Financial Assistance Program. This includes patients covered under their own policy and those who may be entitled to benefits from a third-party policy. Patients may be asked to show proof that such a claim was properly submitted to the proper insurance provider at the request of IU Health Arnett. Eligible patients who receive medical care from IU Health Arnett as a result of an injury proximately caused by a third party, and later receive a monetary settlement or award from said third party, may receive Financial Assistance for any outstanding balance not covered by the settlement or award to which IU Health Arnett is entitled. In the event a Financial Assistance Award has already been granted in such circumstances, IU Health Arnett reserves the right to reverse the award in an amount equal to the amount IU Health Arnett would be entitled to receive had no Financial Assistance been awarded. 6. Alternate Methods of Eligibility Determination IU Health Arnett will conduct a quarterly review of all accounts placed with a collection agency partner for a period of no less than one hundred and twenty (120) days after the account is eligible for an ECA. Said accounts may be eligible for assistance under the FAP based on the patients individual scoring criteria. To ensure all patients potentially eligible for Financial Assistance under the FAP may receive Financial Assistance, IU Health Arnett will deem patients/guarantors to be presumptively eligible for Financial Assistance if they are found to be eligible for one of the following programs, received emergency or direct admit care, and satisfied his/her required co-pay/deductible: - Indiana Childrens Special Health Care Services - Medicaid - Healthy Indiana Plan - Patients who are awarded Hospital Presumptive Eligibility (HPE) - Enrolled in a state and/or federal program that verifies the patient's gross household income is less than or equal to 200% of the Federal Poverty Level 7. Additional Considerations Financial Assistance may be granted to a deceased patients account if said patient is found to have no estate. Additionally, IU Health Arnett will deny or revoke Financial Assistance for any patient or guarantor who falsifies any portion of a Financial Assistance application. 8. Patient Assets IU Health Arnett may consider patient/guarantor Assets in the calculation of a patient's true financial burden. A patient's/guarantor's primary residence and one (1) motor vehicle will be exempted from consideration in most cases. A patient's primary residence is defined as the patient's principal place of residence and will be excluded from a patient's extraordinary asset calculation so long as the patient's equity is less than five-hundred thousand dollars ($500,000) and the home is occupied by the patient/guarantor, patient's/guarantor's spouse or child under twenty-one (21) years of age. One (1) motor vehicle may be excluded as long as the patient's equity in the vehicle is less than fifty-thousand dollars ($50,000). IU Health Arnett reserves the right to request a list of all property owned by the patient/guarantor and adjust a patient's award of Financial Assistance if the patient demonstrates a claim or clear title to any extraordinary Asset not excluded from consideration under the above guidance. 9. Non-Emergent Services Down Payment Uninsured Patients presenting for scheduled or other non-emergent services will not be charged more than the AGB for their services. Patients will receive an estimated AGB cost of their care prior to IU Health Arnett rendering the services and will be asked to pay a down-payment percentage of the AGB adjusted cost prior to receiving services. In the event a patient is unable to fulfill the down-payment, their service may be rescheduled for a later date as medically prudent and in accordance with all applicable federal and state laws and/or regulations. 10. Emergency Services Non-Refundable Deposit This section will be implemented with a strict adherence to EMTALA and IU Health Policy ADM 1.32, Screening and Transfer of Emergency or Unstable Patients. Amount of Non-Refundable Deposit All Uninsured Patients presenting for services at IU Health Arnetts Emergency Department, via transfer from another hospital facility, or direct admission, will be responsible for a one-hundred dollar ($100.00) non-refundable deposit for services rendered. Patients/guarantors will be responsible for any copays and/or deductibles required by their plan prior to full Financial Assistance being applied. Uninsured Patients wishing to make an application for Financial Assistance greater than the AGB must fulfill their non-refundable deposit prior to IU Health Arnett processing said application. Uninsured Patients making payments toward their outstanding non-refundable deposit balance will have said payments applied to their oldest application on file, if applicable."

IU Health and its related hospital entities across the State of Indiana (""IU Health Statewide System"") invest in economic development efforts across the state, collaborate with like-minded organizations through coalitions that address key issues, and advocate for improvements in the health status of vulnerable populations. This includes making contributions to community-building activities by providing investments and resources to local community initiatives that addressed economic development, community support and workforce development. Several examples include IU Healths support of the following organizations and initiatives that focus on some of the root causes of health issues, such as lack of education, employment and poverty: - Riggs Community Health Center - Starfish Initiative - Teach for America - United Way Additionally, through the IU Health Statewide Systems team member community benefit service program team members across the state make a difference in the lives of thousands of Hoosiers every year."

201803199349318125,263162145,"Schedule H, Part III, Line 4 - Bad Debt Expense","IU Health Arnett is a subsidiary in the consolidated financial statements of IU Health. IU Healths bad debt expense footnote is as follows: The Indiana University Health System does not require collateral or other security for the delivery of health care services from its patients, substantially all of whom are residents of the state of Indiana. However, assignment of benefit payments payable under patients health insurance programs and plans (e.g., Medicare, Medicaid, health maintenance organizations, and commercial insurance policies) is routinely obtained, consistent with industry practice. The provision for uncollectible accounts, for all payers, is recognized when services are provided based upon managements assessment of historical and expected net collections, taking into consideration business and economic conditions, changes and trends in health care coverage, and other collection indicators. Periodically, management assesses the adequacy of the allowance for uncollectible accounts based upon accounts receivable payer composition and aging, the significance of individual payers to outstanding accounts receivable balances, and historical write-off experience by payer category, as adjusted for collection indicators. The results of this review are then used to make any modifications to the provision for uncollectible accounts and the allowance for uncollectible accounts. In addition, the Indiana University Health System follows established guidelines for placing certain past-due patient balances with collection agencies. Patient accounts that are uncollected, including those placed with collection agencies, are initially charged against the allowance for uncollectible accounts in accordance with collection policies of the Indiana University Health System and, in certain cases, are reclassified to charity care if deemed to otherwise meet financial assistance policies of the Indiana University Health System."
201803199349318125,263162145,"Schedule H, Part III, Line 8 - Medicare Shortfall","The amount reported on Schedule H, Part III, Line 6 is calculated, in accordance with the Form 990 instructions, using ""allowable costs"" from the IU Health Arnett Medicare Cost Report. ""Allowable costs"" for Medicare Cost Report purposes, however, are not reflective of all costs associated with IU Health Arnett's participation in Medicare programs. For example, the Medicare Cost Report excludes certain costs such as billed physician services, the costs of Medicare Parts C and D, fee schedule reimbursed services, and durable medical equipment services. Inclusion of all costs associated with IU Health Arnett's participation in Medicare programs would significantly increase the Medicare shortfall reported on Schedule H, Part III, Line 7. IU Health West Arnett's Medicare shortfall is attributable to reimbursements that are less than the cost of providing patient care and services to Medicare beneficiaries and does not include any amounts that result from inefficiencies or poor management. IU Arnett accepts all Medicare patients knowing that there may be shortfalls; therefore it has taken the position that any shortfall should be counted as part of its community benefit. Additionally, it is implied in Internal Revenue Service Revenue Ruling 69-545 that treating Medicare patients is a community benefit. Revenue Ruling 69-545, which established the community benefit standard for nonprofit hospitals, states that if a hospital serves patients with governmental health benefits, including Medicare, then this is an indication that the hospital operates to promote the health of the community."
201803199349318125,263162145,"Schedule H, Part III, Line 9b - Written Debt Collection Policy","IU Health Arnetts FAP and Written Debt Collection Policy describe the collection practices applicable to patients, including those who may qualify for financial assistance. 1. Financial Assistance Application Patients or their guarantors wishing to apply for Financial Assistance are encouraged to submit a Financial Assistance Application within ninety (90) days of their discharge. Patients or their guarantors may submit an application up to two-hundred and forty (240) days from the date of their first billing statement from IU Health, however, accounts may be subject to ECA as soon as one hundred and twenty (120) days after having received their first billing statement. Patients or their guarantors submitting an incomplete application will receive written notification of the applications deficiency upon discovery by IU health. The application will be pended for a period of forty-five (45) days from the date the notification is mailed. IU Health will suspend any ECA until the application is complete, or the patient fails to cure any deficiencies in their application in the allotted period. Patients with limited English proficiency may request to have a copy of the FAP, a FAP Application, and FAP Plain Language Summary in one of the below languages: - Arabic - Burmese - Burmese-Falam - Burmese-Hakha Chin - Mandarin/Chinese - Spanish The patient, and/or their representative, such as the patients physician, family members, legal counsel, community or religious groups, social services or hospital personnel may request a FAP Application to be mailed to a patients primary mailing address free of charge.

Eligibility Determination IU Health Arnett will inform patients or guarantors of the results of their application by providing the patient or guarantor with a Financial Assistance Determination within ninety (90) days of receiving a completed Application and all requested documentation. If a patient or guarantor is granted less than full charity assistance and the patient or guarantor provides additional information for reconsideration, IU Health Revenue Cycle Services may amend a prior Financial Assistance Determination. If a patient or guarantor seeks to appeal the Financial Assistance Determination further, a written request must be submitted, along with the supporting documentation, to the Financial Assistance Committee for additional review/reconsideration. All decisions of the Financial Assistance Committee are final. A patients Financial Assistance Application and eligibility determination are specific to each individual date(s) of service and related encounters. 3. Extraordinary Collection Actions IU Health Arnett may refer delinquent patient accounts to a third-party collection agency after utilizing reasonable efforts to determine a patients eligibility for assistance under the FAP. IU Health and its third-party collection agencies may initiate ECA against a patient or their guarantor in accordance with this Policy and 26 C.F.R. 1.501(r). Said ECA may include the following: - Selling a patients or their guarantors outstanding financial responsibility to a third party. - Reporting adverse information about the patient or their guarantor to consumer credit reporting agencies or credit bureaus. - Deferring or denying, or requiring a payment before providing, medically necessary care because of a patients or their guarantors nonpayment of one or more bills for previously provided care covered under the FAP. - Actions requiring a legal or judicial process, including but not limited to placing a lien on patients or their guarantors property, foreclosing on a patients or their guarantors real property attaching or seizing a patients or their guarantors bank account or other personal property, commencing a civil action against a patient or their guarantor, causing a patient or guarantors arrest, causing a patient and/or guarantor to be subject to a writ of body attachment, and garnishing a patient or guarantors wages. When it is necessary to engage in such action, IU Health Arnett and its third party collection agencies, will engage in fair, respectful and transparent collections activities. Patients or guarantors currently subject to an ECA who have not previously applied for Financial Assistance may apply for assistance up to two-hundred and forty (240) days of the date of their first billing statement from IU Health. IU Health and their third-party collection agencies will suspend any ECA engaged on a patient or their guarantor while an Application is being processed and considered. 4. Refunds Patients eligible for assistance under the FAP who remitted payment to IU Health Arnett in excess of their patient responsibility will be alerted to the overpayment as promptly after discovery as is reasonable given the nature of the overpayment. Patients with an outstanding account balance on a separate account not eligible for assistance under the FAP will have their refund applied to the outstanding balance. Patients without an outstanding account balance described above will be issued a refund check for their overpayment as soon as technically feasible."

Research conducted by IU School of Medicine faculty gives IU Health physicians and patients access to the most leading-edge and comprehensive treatment options. In 2012, IU Health and the IU School of Medicine announced that they would invest $150 million over five years in the Strategic Research Initiative, a new research collaboration that has enhanced the institutions joint capabilities in fundamental scientific investigation, translational research and clinical trials. The initial focus is on projects in the fields of neuroscience, cancer and cardiovascular disease with the goal to fund transformative proposals that will fundamentally change our understanding of these diseases and lead to important new therapies for patients. The three target research areas represent research strengths at IU School of Medicine, key strategic service lines for IU Health, and important medical needs in a time of an aging population and rising healthcare costs: - Cancer: One of the initiative's primary goals is to enable the IU Health Melvin and Bren Simon Cancer Center to attain the National Cancer Institute's top status of ""comprehensive,"" which would recognize it as one of the top-tier cancer centers in the nation. - Neuroscience: The neurosciences research program will tackle a broad range of brain injuries, neurodegenerative disorders and neurodevelopmental disorders. - Cardiovascular: The cardiovascular research initiative will develop a comprehensive program for the study and treatment of heart failure, from newborns to older adults. A top priority is developing a cardiovascular genetics program. The Strategic Research Initiative will provide patients with access to internationally renowned physicians and to new therapies developed through translational research and clinical trials, and will make use of the latest genetic tools to develop personalized therapies that are more effective for individuals and efficient for healthcare providers. IU Health Statewide System IU Health is a part of the IU Health Statewide System which continues to broaden its reach and positive impact throughout the state of Indiana. IU Health is Indianas most comprehensive academic health center and consists of IU Health Methodist Hospital, IU Health University Hospital, Riley Hospital for Children at IU Health, and IU Health Saxony Hospital. Other hospitals in the IU Health Statewide System include the following: - IU Health Arnett Hospital - IU Health Ball Memorial Hospital - IU Health Bedford Hospital - IU Health Blackford Hospital - IU Health Bloomington Hospital - IU Health Frankfort Hospital - IU Health North Hospital - IU Health Paoli Hospital - IU Health Tipton Hospital - IU Health West Hospital - IU Health White Memorial Hospital Although each hospital in the IU Health Statewide System prepares and submits its own community benefits plan relative to the local community, the IU Health Statewide System considers its community benefit plan as part of an overall vision for strengthening Indianas overall health. A comprehensive community outreach strategy and community benefit plan is in place that encompasses the academic medical center downtown Indianapolis, suburban Indianapolis and statewide entities around priority areas that focus on health improvement efforts statewide. IU Health is keenly aware of the positive impact it can have on the communities of need in the state of Indiana by focusing on the most pressing needs in a systematic and strategic way. Some ways we address our community health priorities as a system include: IU Health Day of Service The annual IU Health Days of Service is a high-impact event aimed at engaging IU Health team members in activities that address an identified community priority. Each year, more than 2,000 IU Health team members volunteer during the Days of Service. Community Health Initiatives With investments in high-quality and impactful initiatives to address community health needs statewide, IU Health is helping Indiana residents improve their health and their quality of life. In 2017, IU Health impacted many people statewide through presentations, health risk screenings, health education programs, and additional health educational opportunities made available to the community, especially to our community members in the greatest need of such services. Examples of the types of programming and investment we make in community outreach areas include: Access to Healthcare IU Health is committed to providing quality and complete healthcare for Hoosiers. Access to healthcare was a leading community health need identified in all communities served by IU Health across the state. IU Health is focusing on the needs of the underserved to create initiatives and support efforts that: - Educate community members to understand and navigate the healthcare system - Increase the availability of low-cost services and provide financial assistance IU Health provides free or reduced-cost care and supports a number of clinics to provide free or reduced-cost care to individuals without access to insurance or the ability to pay the full cost of their healthcare. These clinics include: - IU Student Outreach Clinic - Hope Healthcare Services - Gennesaret Free Clinics - Trinity Free Clinic Healthy Weight & Nutrition Like most of the nation, Hoosiers see the alarming rise of obesity in their communities as a leading concern. Nationally, Indiana has the 15th highest adult obesity rate in the nation (The State of Obesity: Better Policies for a Healthier America, 2016). Obesity prevention was a critical community health need identified in IU Health communities across the state. IU Health is committed to launching innovative efforts aimed at preventing and reversing obesity in our communities to help community members get active, get healthy and get strong. IU Health is working to create initiatives and support efforts to: - Improve access to healthy foods - Create healthier school environments - Increase access to safe places for community members to be physically active IU Health initiatives aimed at preventing and reversing obesity in our communities include: - Strong Schools - Change the Play - Youth Diabetes Prevention Clinic Healthy Food Access Grant The Healthy Food Access Grant is an extension of the work started in 2011 with the Garden on the Go program to address obesity in the Indianapolis community. According to the USDA, between 25 and 30 million (9%) Americans are currently living in communities that do not provide adequate access to healthy food within a mile of their home. In Indianapolis, it is estimated that over 300,000 (36%) residents live in food deserts and have limited access to healthy and affordable food options. Indianapolis is reported as having the highest incidence of food deserts in the country (USDA, 2014). The lack of consumption and lack of access to healthy affordable food, particularly fresh produce, contributes to a poor diet and often can lead to higher rates of obesity and other diet-related diseases, such as diabetes and heart disease. Approximately 31% of Marion County residents are considered obese, up nearly 7% from 2010. When controlling for obesity, weight-related health problems, and health of environment, the Indianapolis area ranks among the worst metropolitan areas in the United States in terms of health. In sum, obesity is on the rise while increasingly more Indianapolis residents have less access to healthy and affordable food, which can contribute to lower consumption rates of fresh fruits and vegetables and higher rates of diet-related diseases. To address this important community and population health issue, IU Health Community Outreach and Engagement launched a new Healthy Food Access Grant Initiative specifically aimed at addressing t"

For inpatient services, the reimbursement methodology is the Inpatient Prospective Payment System (IPPS), which uses the Diagnostic Related Groups (DRGS) methodology to reimburse the hospital. The DRG amounts are updated by the Medicare program annually by an updating factor. However, the amount of the updating factor is always significantly less than the actual healthcare inflation factor because the Medicare program includes a ""budget neutrality"" factor for the overall Medicare program. Thus, the hospital does not receive full reimbursement of its cost for inpatient services. For outpatient services, the reimbursement methodology is the Outpatient Prospective Payment System (OPPS), which uses ambulatory payment classifications (APCS) to reimburse the hospital. The APC amounts are updated by the Medicare program annually by an updating factor.

For inpatient services, the limit is the TEFRA target limit. The hospital, on occasion, exceeds the target rate and does not receive full cost reimbursement. The TEFRA target amount is updated by the Medicare program annually by the TEFRA updating factor. However, the amount of the TEFRA updating factor is always significantly less than the actual healthcare inflation factor because the Medicare program includes a ""budget neutrality"" factor for the overall Medicare program. For outpatient services, the limit is the payment to cost ratio (PCR). The PCR was established using a base year, which was 1996, at a rate of 85.5% of cost. The PCR for all exempt cancer centers was 92% through 12/31/16, and then 91% from 1/1/17 to 5/31/17; therefore, the hospital currently does not receive payment for a range of 8% to 9% of its outpatient cost."

The Rockefeller University Hospital is a unique institution. As an institution solely committed to conducting clinical research our community/service area is defined as the New York Metropolitan Area. The Rockefeller University Hospital has provided an array of clinical research and patient care services since its founding in 1910. The Rockefeller University Hospital community served/service area is determined based on research being conducted. Principal Investigators identify an area of interest and submit a protocol for review and approval by our institutional review board. If and when the protocol is approved, our recruitment office works with the investigator to develop and submit advertisements in local newspapers, magazines and online. Identification of lucrative places to advertise is determined by current trends in readership among local newspapers, magazines and visits to particular websites such as Craigslist and Facebook. Research participants are culled from all over New York City as well as through collaborations with neighboring hospitals, Universities, and clinics. As a result, our enrolled research participant demographics are similar to those of New York City overall. In calendar year 2018 15% of research participants identified as Hispanic, 34% identified as Black or African-American and 42% identified as white (RUH subject race and ethnicity report 2018), which is similar to the geographic makeup of New York City (42.8% white, 24.3% Black or African-American, and 29.1% Hispanic) https://www.census.gov/quickfacts/fact/table/newyorkcitynewyork,US/PST045218."

WE PROVIDE EXCELLENT AND COMPASSIONATE CARE AND RESPONSIVE SERVICE. AS WE SEEK TO UNDERSTAND AND FULLY MEET OUR PATIENTS' CURRENT AND FUTURE NEEDS AND EXPECTATIONS, WE RECOGNIZE OUR RESPONSIBILITY TO PRUDENTLY USE THE SCARCE RESOURCES ENTRUSTED TO US. LAWS, REGULATIONS, CATASTROPHIC ILLNESSES AND THE RISING COSTS OF NEW TECHNOLOGY HAVE CREATED A CATEGORY OF PATIENTS WHO ARE EITHER UNINSURED OR UNDERINSURED. THIS CHARITY CARE PROGRAM HAS BEEN DEVELOPED TO HELP THE HOSPITAL MEET THE NEEDS OF THESE PATIENTS AND, CONCURRENTLY, MAINTAIN THE FINANCIAL VIABILITY OF THE HOSPITAL FOR FUTURE GENERATIONS. THIS CHARITY CARE POLICY EXPLAINS HOW THE HOSPITAL ASSISTS PATIENTS WHO CANNOT PAY FOR PART OR ALL OF THE ESSENTIAL MEDICAL CARE THEY RECEIVE. PRINCIPLES: STRONG MEMORIAL HOSPITAL PROACTIVELY CONVEYS INFORMATION ABOUT THIS CHARITY CARE POLICY TO PATIENTS AND THEIR FAMILIES. - WE BELIEVE THAT FEAR OF A HOSPITAL BILL SHOULD NEVER GET IN THE WAY OF ESSENTIAL HEALTH SERVICES. THE PROVISION OF URGENT OR EMERGENT HEALTHCARE IS NEVER DELAYED PENDING A FINANCIAL ASSISTANCE DETERMINATION. SIGNS ANNOUNCING THE CHARITY CARE PROGRAM ARE POSTED IN THE HOSPITAL (E.G. EMERGENCY DEPARTMENT, ADMITTING OFFICE) TO PROACTIVELY CONVEY THIS MESSAGE TO PROSPECTIVE PATIENTS AND THE PUBLIC IN GENERAL. - WE MAINTAIN FINANCIAL AID POLICIES THAT ARE CONSISTENT WITH THE MISSION, VALUES AND CAPACITY OF THE HOSPITAL AND THAT TAKE INTO ACCOUNT EACH INDIVIDUAL'S ABILITY TO CONTRIBUTE TO THE COST OF HIS OR HER CARE. - WE COMMUNICATE THE AVAILABILITY OF FINANCIAL AID IN A MANNER THAT IS CLEAR, UNDERSTANDABLE, SENSITIVE TO THE PATIENT'S DIGNITY, AND IN MULTIPLE LANGUAGES. A NOTICE IS AVAILABLE AT REGISTRATION SITES THAT INFORMS PATIENTS OF THIS PROGRAM AND PROVIDES THE PHONE NUMBER TO CALL TO OBTAIN MORE INFORMATION AND TO APPLY FOR THIS PROGRAM. DESIGNATED STAFF ARE PROVIDED DETAILED TRAINING SO THAT THEY CAN PROVIDE INFORMATION AND ANSWER QUESTIONS ABOUT THE CHARITY CARE PROGRAM. INFORMATION IS GENERALLY AVAILABLE IN BOTH ENGLISH AND SPANISH. WHEN REQUESTED, IT WILL ALSO BE MADE AVAILABLE IN OTHER LANGUAGES. - INFORMATION REGARDING OUR CHARITY CARE PROGRAM IS ALSO AVAILABLE ON THE URMC WEBSITE. - WE IMPLEMENT FINANCIAL AID PROCEDURES THAT ARE CONSUMER-FRIENDLY, RESPECTFUL, AND CONFIDENTIAL, AS WELL AS DEBT COLLECTION POLICIES THAT REFLECT THE MISSION AND VALUES OF THIS HOSPITAL. - WE WORK WITH GOVERNMENT, PAYERS, BUSINESS, CONSUMER GROUPS AND OTHERS TO ADDRESS THE UNDERLYING PROBLEM THAT TOO MANY NEW YORKERS LACK HEALTH INSURANCE. GENERAL GUIDELINES: AS PART OF FINANCIAL PLANNING ASSISTANCE, WE PROVIDE PATIENTS, AND/OR THEIR LEGAL REPRESENTATIVE, WITH INFORMATION ABOUT THE CRITERIA THAT MUST BE MET IN ORDER TO OBTAIN MEDICAID, MEDICARE, OR OTHER HEALTH INSURANCES. PATIENTS ARE ASSISTED IN MAKING APPLICATIONS FOR ANY OF THESE INSURANCES OR DISCOUNTED FEE PLANS. PATIENTS ARE EXPECTED TO PARTICIPATE FULLY IN ALL EFFORTS TO OBTAIN ANY INSURANCE FOR WHICH THEY MAY QUALIFY. UNDER CERTAIN CIRCUMSTANCES, AS DETERMINED BY THE FINANCIAL CASE MANAGERS OR OTHER HOSPITAL SENIOR ADMINISTRATORS. APPLICATIONS FOR MEDICAID, MEDICARE OR OTHER INSURANCE PROGRAMS MAY BE WAIVED WHEN DEEMED UNNECESSARY. IF AVAILABLE INSURANCE BENEFITS ARE NOT SUFFICIENT TO COVER THE COST OF THEIR CARE, PATIENTS MAY THEN APPLY FOR ASSISTANCE FROM THE CHARITY CARE PROGRAM. CHARITY CARE APPLICATIONS MUST BE COMPLETED AND RETURNED TO THE HOSPITAL WITH THE REQUESTED INCOME DOCUMENTATION. PATIENTS WILL NOT RECEIVE CHARITY CARE ASSISTANCE IF THEY (A) DO NOT COMPLETE THE APPLICATION PROCESS FOR MEDICAID OR OTHER INSURANCE FOR WHICH THEY MAY QUALIFY, (B) ELECT NOT TO MAKE APPLICATION FOR CHARITY CARE, OR (C) HAVE ADEQUATE RESOURCES OR INCOME TO PAY PRIVATELY FOR THEIR CARE. IN THESE SITUATIONS, THEY WILL REMAIN FINANCIALLY RESPONSIBLE FOR FULL PAYMENT OF THEIR HOSPITAL BILLS. CHARITY CARE ASSISTANCE IS AVAILABLE FOR PATIENTS WHO RESIDE IN NEW YORK STATE AND RECEIVE EMERGENCY HOSPITAL SERVICES, INCLUDING EMERGENCY TRANSFERS, AND TO PATIENTS WHO RESIDE IN STRONG MEMORIAL HOSPITAL'S PRIMARY SERVICE AREA IN NEW YORK STATE WHO RECEIVE SERVICES IN DESIGNATED STRONG MEMORIAL HOSPITAL PROGRAMS, INCLUDING MOST INPATIENT AND OUTPATIENT SERVICES. IN ADDITION, THE HOSPITAL MAY, IN ITS DISCRETION, GRANT CHARITY CARE TO INDIVIDUALS WHO RESIDE OUTSIDE OF NEW YORK STATE. CHARITY CARE ASSISTANCE DOES NOT COVER MEDICALLY UNNECESSARY CARE, COSMETIC ALTERATION, TELEPHONE, TELEVISION AND PRIVATE ROOM CHARGES. IT DOES NOT COVER SERVICES GENERATED BY AN INSURED PATIENT WHO CHOOSES TO RECEIVE CARE AT AN OUT-OF-NETWORK HOSPITAL, OR WHO FAILS TO COMPLY WITH INSURANCE POLICY REQUIREMENTS (E.G. UNAUTHORIZED SERVICES) NOR DOES IT APPLY TO NON-RESIDENT ALIENS (UNLESS APPROVED IN ADVANCE OF CARE BEING PROVIDED), TO DRUGS NOT ADMINISTERED IN THE HOSPITAL, TO TRANSPORTATION FURNISHED BY THIRD PARTY VENDORS, OR TO CARE, SERVICES, DRUGS OR SUPPLIES FOR THE PURPOSE OF GENDER CHANGE PROCEDURE. SPECIFIC QUESTIONS ABOUT SERVICES THAT ARE NOT COVERED SHOULD BE DIRECTED TO THE PATIENT ACCOUNTS MANAGER OR THEIR DELEGATE. FINANCIAL GUIDELINES: FINANCIAL AID IS INTENDED TO ASSIST THOSE INDIVIDUALS WHO CANNOT AFFORD TO PAY IN PART OR IN FULL FOR THEIR CARE. IT SHOULD TAKE INTO ACCOUNT EACH INDIVIDUAL'S ABILITY TO CONTRIBUTE TO THE COST OF HIS OR HER CARE. HOSPITAL FINANCIAL AID SHOULD NOT BE VIEWED AS A SUBSTITUTE FOR EMPLOYER-SPONSORED OR INDIVIDUALLY PURCHASED INSURANCE. PATIENTS WITHOUT INSURANCE AND WITH INCOME THAT WOULD QUALIFY THEM FOR THE CHARITY CARE PROGRAM BUT ALSO HAVE SUBSTANTIAL RESOURCES (OTHER THAN TAX-DEFERRED OR COMPARABLE RETIREMENT SAVINGS OR COLLEGE SAVINGS ACCOUNTS) MAY BE EXPECTED TO PAY PART OF THEIR BILLS(S). CHARITY CARE ASSISTANCE IS GENERALLY AVAILABLE TO INDIVIDUALS WHOSE INCOME IS LESS THAN OR EQUAL TO 400% OF THE FEDERAL POVERTY LEVEL. HOWEVER, PATIENTS WHO HAVE EXHAUSTED THEIR INSURANCE BENEFITS, EXCEEDED FINANCIAL ELIGIBILITY CRITERIA, FACE EXTRAORDINARY MEDICAL COSTS, OR WHO HAVE OTHER UNIQUE CIRCUMSTANCES MAY BE CONSIDERED FOR CHARITY CARE APPROVAL IN THE HOSPITAL'S SOLE DISCRETION. WHILE APPLICATION FOR MEDICAID OR OTHER INSURANCE IS USUALLY REQUIRED, THE HOSPITAL MAY, AT ITS SOLE DISCRETION, IN APPROPRIATE CASES, ALSO CONSIDER PATIENTS FOR CHARITY CARE WHEN THEY MEET THE FINANCIAL CRITERIA OF THIS PROGRAM, BUT HAVE NOT SATISFACTORILY COMPLETED ALL THE REQUIREMENTS OF THE CHARITY CARE APPLICATION PROCESS. THIS MAY INCLUDE PATIENTS WHO HAVE BEEN SANCTIONED BY MEDICAID, HAVE FILED BANKRUPTCY OR APPEAR TO BE ELIGIBLE FOR CHARITY CARE ASSISTANCE BASED ON AVAILABLE INFORMATION. ELIGIBILITY DETERMINATIONS IN COMPLEX CASE CIRCUMSTANCES WILL BE MADE AFTER CONSIDERATION BY THE CHARITY CARE REVIEW TEAM THAT INCLUDES THE CHARITY CARE OFFICER, FINANCIAL CASE MANAGER AND/OR THEIR MANAGERS, OR MAY BE MADE BY SENIOR HOSPITAL ADMINISTRATORS. THE AMOUNT OF THE DISCOUNT AFFORDED TO QUALIFIED CHARITY CARE PATIENTS WILL BE DETERMINED THROUGH ASSESSMENT OF THE RESPONSIBLE PARTY'S ANNUAL HOUSEHOLD INCOME AND THE NUMBER OF PEOPLE IN THE HOME, AS A PERCENTAGE OF THE FEDERAL POVERTY GUIDELINE AMOUNTS FOR SAME SIZE HOUSEHOLDS. THE FINANCIAL GUIDELINES WILL BE UPDATED ANNUALLY IN CONJUNCTION WITH THE FEDERAL POVERTY UPDATES PUBLISHED BY CMS. PATIENTS MAY RECEIVE FULL OR PARTIAL DISCOUNT FROM THE COST OF CARE, DEPENDING ON THE PERCENTAGE OF THE GUIDELINES MATCHED BY THE PATIENT'S HOUSEHOLD INCOME. ANY BILL AMOUNT REMAINING AFTER APPLICATION OF A PARTIAL CHARITY CARE DISCOUNT IS THE RESPONSIBILITY OF THE PATIENT. THE AMOUNT AN APPROVED CHARITY CARE PATIENT WILL GENERALLY BE EXPECTED TO PAY FOR SERVICES COVERED BY THE POLICY WILL BE LIMITED TO THE LOWER OF THE AMOUNT THAT THE HOSPITAL WOULD HAVE RECEIVED FOR THE SAME SERVICE UNDER MEDICARE PARTS A AND B, (INCLUDING COINSURANCE, CO-PAYMENTS AND DEDUCTIBLES) OR THE USUAL AND CUSTOMARY CHARGES. THE PATIENT WILL BE ASSISTED BY THE HOSPITAL IN MAKING ARRANGEMENTS TO SATISFY ANY BALANCE REMAINING ON THE ACCOUNT(S) AFTER THE APPLICATION OF THE APPROPRIATE CHARITY CARE DISCOUNT BY USE OF A PAYMENT PLAN. THE MONTHLY PAYMENTS UNDER SUCH PLANS SHALL NOT EXCEED TEN PERCENT (10%) OF THE ELIGIBLE PATIENT'S GROSS MONTHLY INCOME. THE RATE OF INTEREST ON UNPAID BALANCES SHALL NOT EXCEED THE US TREASURY RATE FOR 90 DAY SECURITIES PLUS 0.5%. HOSPITAL PATIENT FINANCIAL AID STATUTE DISCOUNTING REQUIREMENTS DISCOUNT / GROSS INCOME AS % OF FEDERAL POVERTY LEVEL 100% / UP TO 200% 80% / BETWEEN 201-250% 60% / BETWEEN 251-300% 40% / BETWEEN 301-350% 20% / BETWEEN 351-400% 0% / OVER 401% PROCESS: APPLICATIONS WILL BE ACCEPTED IMMEDIATELY BEFORE, DURING OR AFTER CARE IS PROVIDED. THE HOSPITAL WILL STRIVE TO ASSIST PATIENTS RECEIVING HIGH-COST SERVICES AS THEY OCCUR. PATIENTS MAY BE APPROVED FOR CHARITY CARE ON AN ACCOUNT-BY-ACCOUNT BASIS OR FOR A PERIOD OF TIME (FOR A COURSE OF TREATMENT). F"

WITH THE INPUT OF THE MONROE COUNTY DEPARTMENT OF PUBLIC HEALTH (MCDPH), SEVERAL DATA SOURCES ARE REVIEWED, PRIMARILY NATALITY AND MORTALITY DATA, HOSPITALIZATION DATA THROUGH THE STATEWIDE PLANNING AND RESEARCH COOPERATIVE SYSTEMS (SPARCS) FILES, DISEASE AND SPECIFIC CONDITION DATA, AND THE NY STATE PREVENTION AGENDA DASHBOARD DATA. SEVERAL REPORTS ARE CONDUCTED PERIODICALLY BY COMMON GROUND HEALTH INCLUDING THE HEALTH EQUITY CHARTBOOK AND THE MONROE COUNTY HEALTH PROFILES, AND BY THE MCDPH INCLUDING THE YOUTH RISK BEHAVIOR SURVEY REPORT AND CHRONIC DISEASES IN MONROE COUNTY REPORT. THESE REPORTS INFORM THE HOSPITAL OF THE HEALTH CARE NEEDS OF THE COMMUNITY. THE CHIW GROUP BEGAN MEETING MONTHLY IN MAY 2012 AND CONTINUES TO MEET EVERY MONTH TO ASSESS THE NEEDS OF THE MONROE COUNTY COMMUNITY AND TO MONITOR SUCCESSES OF IMPLEMENTATION OF THE COMMUNITY HEALTH IMPROVEMENT PLAN. IN ADDITION, COMMUNITY INPUT IS PERIODICALLY SOUGHT FROM RESIDENTS, THE GREATER ROCHESTER CHAMBER OF COMMERCE, THE AFRICAN AMERICAN HEALTH COALITION AND THE LATINO HEALTH COALITION.

THE MEDICAL CENTER PROVIDES SALARY SUPPORT FOR FACULTY AND STAFF TO CONTRIBUTE THEIR ACADEMIC AND CLINICAL EXPERTISE TO HELP IDENTIFY AND IMPLEMENT THE MOST EFFECTIVE INTERVENTIONS ON THE HEALTH PRIORITY NEEDS. THE CENTER FOR COMMUNITY HEALTH AND PREVENTION (CCHP) WAS ESTABLISHED IN 2006 AS THE LINK BETWEEN THE COMMUNITY AND THE UNIVERSITY. AS PART OF THAT LINK, THE CENTERS FACULTY AND STAFF ARE FREQUENTLY ENGAGED WITH THE COMMUNITY FOR PROGRAMS, MEETINGS, INFORMATION SHARING AND RESEARCH. THE COMMUNICABLE DISEASE SECTION OF THE CCHP MONITORS INFECTIOUS DISEASE PREVALENCE AND TRENDS FOR OUR COMMUNITY AND SHARES DATA BOTH LOCALLY AND NATIONALLY. THE CANCER PREVENTION SECTION IN THE CCHP FOLLOWS TRENDS IN CANCER RATES AS WELL AS SCREENING RATES. FACULTY AND STAFF FROM WITHIN THE CCHP AS WELL AS AROUND THE INSTITUTION FREQUENTLY ATTEND COMMUNITY MEETINGS AND EVENTS TO GAUGE THE NEEDS OF COMMUNITY MEMBERS. IN ADDITION, THE CCHP SUPPORTS THE COMMUNITY ADVISORY COUNCIL (CAC), A LARGE COLLABORATIVE OF COMMUNITY LEADERS THAT INFORMS THE UNIVERSITY ABOUT ON-GOING AND EMERGING CONCERNS. THE COMMUNITY ADVISORY COUNCIL (CAC) WAS CREATED IN 2006 TO REPRESENT THE VOICE OF THE COMMUNITY AND TO GUIDE AND SUPPORT THE MISSION OF THE URMC. THE THIRTY-NINE MEMBER CAC REPRESENTS TWENTY-ONE COMMUNITY-BASED ORGANIZATIONS, INCLUDING HEALTH AND SOCIAL SERVICE AGENCIES, THE FAITH COMMUNITY, LOCAL GOVERNMENT, THE CITY SCHOOL DISTRICT AND MEDIA.

In 1995, Adventist Health System entered into a joint venture with Emory Healthcare, thus creating the first hospital co-owned by two leading healthcare providers. The facility was renamed Emory-Adventist Hospital. In 2015, Emory University acquired Emory-Adventist Hospital and renamed it Emory University Hospital Smyrna.

The provision for doubtful accounts and the allowance for doubtful accounts relate primarily to amounts due directly from patients. Management relies on the results of detailed reviews of historical write-offs and recoveries as a primary source of information to utilize in estimating the collectability of the Company's accounts receivable. The results of the detailed reviews of historical write-offs and recoveries, adjusted for changes in trends and conditions, are used to estimate the allowance for doubtful accounts for the current period. Adverse changes in general economic conditions, business office operations, payer mix, or trends in federal or state governmental health care coverage could affect the Company's collection of accounts receivable, cash flows, and results of operations."

Collection of outstanding receivables from third-party payers (Medicare, managed care payers, etc.) is the Hospitals' primary source of cash and is critical to our ability to fund operations. The primary collection risks relate to uninsured patient accounts, including patient accounts for which the primary insurance carrier has paid the amounts covered by the applicable agreement, but patient responsibility amounts (deductibles and copayments) remain outstanding. The provision for doubtful accounts and the allowance for doubtful accounts relate primarily to amounts due directly from patients. An estimated allowance for doubtful accounts is recorded for all uninsured accounts, regardless of the aging of those accounts. Accounts are written off when all reasonable internal and external collections efforts have been performed. Our collection policies include a review of all accounts against certain standard collection criteria, upon completion of our internal collection efforts. Accounts determined to possess positive collectability attributes are forwarded to a secondary external collections agency and the other accounts are written off. The accounts that are not collected by the secondary external collection agency are written off when they are returned to us by the collection agency (usually within 12 months). Write-offs are based upon specific identification and the write-off process requires a write-off adjustment entry to the patient accounting system. We do not pursue collection of amounts related to patients that meet our guidelines to qualify as charity care. The methodology to determine the bad debt expense reported at cost on Part III, Line 2 is to take the ratio of patient care costs to gross patient charges and multiply this resulting ratio by the gross charges for bad debt accounts."
