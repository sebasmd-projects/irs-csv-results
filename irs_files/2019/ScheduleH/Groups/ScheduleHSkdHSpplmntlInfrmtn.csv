201803199349303295,111631796,PART V LINE 5,"NewYork-Presbyterian/Brooklyn Methodist Hospital (NYP/BMH) conducted a community needs assessment. Community input that was solicited and taken into account was sought from the public in a number of ways. Several meetings with key informants from local organizations were held, during which there was discussion of the communitys needs. A list of the organizations with whom we worked follows: Senior Umbrella Network of Brooklyn (SUN-B) St. Georges Episcopal Church in Crown Heights, Brooklyn Investors Bank Foundation Heights and Hills Senior Services New York Citys Department of Health and Mental Diabetes Prevention Program Liaison, Primary Care Information Project Environmental Gerontologist, Parsons School of Design United Federation of Teachers Good Neighbors of Park Slope (GNPS) Everyone with Diabetes Counts New York/IPRO/ Improvement Healthcare for the Common Good NYC DOHMH Center for Health Equity, Office of the First Deputy Commissioner Minister of New Creation Community Health Empowerment, Inc. (NCCHE) Brooklyn Public Library (BPL) Brooklyn Childrens Museum A Community Health Needs Survey was created and made available on Survey Monkey called for submission and survey completion to appear on the homepage of NYP/BMHs public website, www.nyp/brooklyn.org, and via social media platforms like Facebook and Twitter. The survey also appeared in the spring/summer 2016 issue of our community health magazine Thrive (circulation 250,000 Brooklyn residents); readers were encouraged to fill it out and mail it back or respond online. Hard copies of the survey were distributed at health fairs and community lectures. Respondents included people of all ages, races and education levels. Over 50 percent of respondents represented minority groups and those who are medically underserved.

201803199349303295,111631796,PART V LINE 11,"Our 2016 Community Health needs assessment revealed that some of Brooklynites major health needs are in the areas of diabetes, obesity, and preventing falls and injuries. Therefore, NYPBMH aimed to increase already existing programming in these areas by partnering with local coalitions, churches, schools and community-based organizations, as well as by creating new programming. As part of our state-mandated community service plan, we chose to focus on preventing chronic disease, with a special focus on diabetes; preventing chronic disease with a focus on childhood obesity; and promoting a healthy and safe environment by reducing fall risk amongst our most vulnerable populations. We regularly address community concerns regarding chronic diseases by providing free screenings and health lectures both on and off the hospitals main campus. We are addressing diabetes prevention and treatment in a number of ways. We offer a free monthly diabetes support group that is open to the community. In addition, in conjunction with IPRO, NYPBMH now hosts six-session diabetes management education seminars, offered several times a year. Clinically, NYPBMH also offers a comprehensive weight management program. With regard to childhood obesity, we were working to identify partners who would provide instruction and space for us to run weekly exercise and dance programs for children and their parents in underserved communities. An earlier program, Dance Your Healthy, enjoyed success, but was terminated when we lost space that had previously been available. The hospital did not have success reinstating this program in 2017. NYPBMH is now looking to partner with schools to offer cooking and nutrition demonstrations in the classroom or during after-school programming. NYPBMH also runs a free weekly breastfeeding support group which encourages and teaches new mothers to provide wholesome nutrition to their infants in the form of breast milk and this group is being expanded beyond NYPBMHs community to reach women in medically underserved areas. Several major studies have indicated that, along with other benefits of breastfeeding, babies who are breastfed face a lower risk of childhood obesity. As a result of the findings in the community health needs assessment, NYPBMH has also developed a Fall Prevention Program, which seeks to give older adults the confidence and tools they need to help them age safely. The program includes seminars on home safety, healthy living, and avoiding falls, given by experts in trauma and injury prevention, environmental gerontology, and public health. These seminars are offered at NYPBMH, as well as at various sites throughout Brooklyn. In addition, two staff members have been trained in Stepping On and two have been trained in Matter of Balance. These are both evidence-based programs that promote balance and behavioral change among seniors who have an increased fear of, or risk of falling. In 2017, the hospital experienced some difficulties with our collaborating partner, in that we were not able to use their data tracking software and therefore could not implement any classes in 2017. The hospital has now decided to collect the data manually. The classes are slated to begin later in 2018. NYPBMH also provides all participants in any fall prevention activities with a fall prevention kit, equipped with a variety of effective items (EG., Nightlight, Glowtape, Non-skid socks, etc.) to help seniors safeguard themselves within their homes. In 2017, the hospital added Promoting Healthy Women, Infants and Children with a focus on Maternal and Infant Health, as an additional priority to their existing interventions. NYPBMH is on the journey to becoming a Baby-Friendly USA Hospital in collaboration with other Brooklyn Hospitals and the DOHMH, which promotes best practices in infant-feeding and care. Our goal is to increase exclusive breastfeeding rates at discharge. The hospital is also seeking to address disparities by offering additional support group classes in underserved neighborhoods where breastfeeding rates are statistically lower. Several major studies have indicated that, along with other benefits of breastfeeding, babies who are breastfed face a lower risk of childhood obesity. In addition to the specific need areas identified in the CHNA, we continue to provide a general community outreach program which hosts roughly 400 annual events, featuring health lectures and support groups targeting various health concerns, including cancer, Hepatitis C, Stroke, and Pulmonary Hypertension.

THE GOAL OF THIS INITIATIVE WAS TO WORK COLLABORATIVELY ON A COUNTY-WIDE CHNA AND IMPLEMENTATION PLAN ONCE PRIORITIES HAD BEEN IDENTIFIED. THE ILLINOIS PUBLIC HEALTH INSTITUTE (IPHI) SERVED AS THE BACKBONE ORGANIZATION FOR THE COLLABORATIVE. IN JANUARY 2016, ILLINOIS MASONIC MEDICAL CENTER'S COMMUNITY HEALTH DIRECTOR RE-FORMED A COMMUNITY HEALTH COUNCIL (CHC) FOR THE MEDICAL CENTER. THE CHC SERVED AS A DECISION-MAKING AND ADVISORY BODY TO ILLINOIS MASONIC MEDICAL CENTER'S LEADERSHIP AND THE GOVERNING COUNCIL REGARDING COMMUNITY HEALTH ASSESSMENT, STRATEGIES AND PROGRAMS. A PRINCIPAL RESPONSIBILITY OF THE CHC WAS PARTICIPATION IN THE MEDICAL CENTER'S COMMUNITY HEALTH NEEDS ASSESSMENT PROCESS. THE MEDICAL CENTER'S COMMUNITY HEALTH COUNCIL CONSISTED OF TWENTY-TWO MEMBERS - 45 PERCENT OF WHICH WERE REPRESENTATIVES FROM THE COMMUNITY AND/OR PUBLIC HEALTH ORGANIZATIONS.

Chronic Disease Implementation Activities: Goal: Asthma - By March 2019, the Chronic Disease Task Force will show a decrease in the number of asthma attacks that require emergency room services or treatment. Congestive Heart Failure - By March 2018, the Chronic Disease Task Force will work to decrease the number of readmissions among unaffiliated CHF patients (those without a primary care physician) within 30-90 days of discharge by establishing primary care providers/medical homes for 50% of patients. Diabetes - By March 2018, the Chronic Disease Task Force will increase the number of patients completing diabetes education courses by adding ADA-certified sites in Clark County. Oral health - The Chronic Disease Task Force will campaign for fluoride to be added to the Clark County water supply to decrease the prevalence of tooth decay and tooth extractions. 2017 Strategies and Outcomes: Springfield Regional Medical Center (SRMC) participates in the Chronic Disease Task Force. The following actions were taken by the hospital or the Task Force: *Asthma- Reviewed current practices as well as the physician and hospital procedures and referral of clients to the program in 2017. The data from Springfield Regional Medical Center on emergency department visits and hospital admissions for asthmatics shows that in 2017 the number of emergency department visits declined, but the number of hospital admissions increased. *Asthma - Engaged strategic partners to develop an effective home-based environmental assessment program. In 2017, these partners included PCP, ED physicians, school nurses, Rocking Horse Center (FQHC) and Head Start. *Congestive Heart Failure (CHF) - Collected data on the number of patients discharged with CHF without a primary care physician (PCP). In 2017, a program was established to work with Rocking House Center to identify and follow unaffiliated patients who were accepted by a PCP/medical home and track the following metrics: weight, medication compliance, symptoms and readmissions at 30, 60 and 90 days. *Congestive Heart Failure (CHF)- Identified the admission and discharge criteria at Springfield Regional Medical Center in 2017. *Congestive Heart Failure (CHF)- Established a case manager for congestive heart failure in 2017. *Congestive Heart Failure (CHF)- In partnership with Rocking Horse Center (RHC), notified RHC on day of admission of qualifying CHF patients for initial post-discharge visit and home health referral. In 2017, there was a slow start due to staff changes. *Diabetes - Established an ADA certified site at The Rocking Horse Center in Clark County in 2017. *Diabetes - In 2017, there were 166 referrals by PCP/medical homes to education programs. *Diabetes - The hospital measured attainment of patient-defined goals and patient outcomes using appropriate measurement techniques to evaluate the effectiveness of the educational intervention. In 2017, 82% of patients participated in eye exams, 92% of patients conducted daily foot exams, 91% of patients met their nutrition goals, 62% of patients met their exercise goals, and 93% of patients met their weight loss goals. *Oral Health- In 2017, Clark County Combined Health District staff collected data, developed a presentation and presented to community members. *Oral Health- In 2017, the Health Commissioner reached out to the three local manufacturers regarding the impact of adding fluoride to their business process and all three said it would not affect their process. *Oral Health- In 2017, a focused education and engagement program was presented in the community to improve understanding of scientific support of the addition of fluoride to city water supply to reduce and prevent tooth decay. *Oral health- In 2017, fluoridation ordinance was not placed on the ballot. It is expected to be on the 2018 ballot. Mental Health Implementation Activities: Goal: By March 2019, the Mental Health Task Force will redirect emergency medical service (EMS) frequent users to appropriate care and reduce all EMS overuse as evidenced by the development of pre-hospital treatment protocols and related collaborative multiprovider agreements supporting the implementation of Mobile Integrated Health Care or similar system management concepts. 2017 Strategies and Outcomes: SRMC participates in the Mental Health Task Force. The following actions were taken by the hospital or the Task Force: *Researched and evaluated frequent users of EMS with mental health concerns for trends and conditions, involving EMS, hospital and Mental Health Services for Clark and Madison Counties, Inc., for data and analysis in 2017. Data collection was established in 2017 and continues. A community initiative to gather leaders representing healthcare, fire & rescue, EMS, higher education, government representatives, police, sheriff's office and the health department has established a task force to review the data and look at best practices in other communities to support the needs in the Springfield community. Health Births and Sexuality Implementation Activities: Goal: To promote, implement and support the practice of Kangaroo Care for all mothers and their newborn infants at SRMC; To work collaboratively with community agencies for early recognition of pregnant women using drugs and to promote healthier pregnancies. 2017 Strategies and Outcomes: *Promoted, implemented and supported the practice of Kangaroo Care for all mothers and their newborn infants at the hospital.

Clients are assessed at Mercy REACH for referrals to SRMC for detox services. A REACH therapist makes rounds on clients daily while in SRMC to encourage treatment with REACH program. The hospital continues to establish an inpatient detox program at SRMC, and to focus on successfully operationalizing the program. There was an increase in the number of clients assessed for detox services from 83 in 2016 to 197 in 2017. Of the 197 clients assessed for detox services, 151 patients completed the program in 2017. *Mercy REACH opened an Intensive Outpatient Program (IOP) for patients discharged from the inpatient detox program to establish sobriety skills. In 2017, there were 600 encounters in (IOP) as individual clients will attend (IOP) 3 times a week for a period of 30-90 days. REACH offers incentives to reduce barriers to treatment and maintaining sobriety. Under a United Way Grant, the hospital offered $10.00 Gas Cards for clients that attend an IOP for the full week and provided transportation tokens for the bus. REACH also offered Free YMCA Day Passes to clients interested in sober activities. *Mercy REACH established the MAT VIVITROL program to provide injections to help prevent relapse to opioid dependence. Clients may receive the MAT Vivitrol treatment for several months ranging from 2-3 months up to 8-9 months depending on the need of the client. In 2017, 37 clients participated in the MAT program compared to 17 individuals participating in the MAT program in 2016.

Nutrition and Wellness (Healthy Living) Implementation Activities: Goal: To promote healthy diet and education about healthy eating into a regular lifestyle for adults with BMI 25-30 (overweight) and BMI 30 and above (obese). By March 2018, the Healthy Living Task Force will increase the number of patients completing diabetes self-management education courses, as documented by increased physician referrals and expansion of programs to include evening hours. 2017 Strategies and Outcomes: *Mercy Health - Urbana Hospital (Urbana Hospital) is working to develop a plan for nutrition education at the Urbana Hospital Chronic Disease Clinic. The Chronic Disease Clinic was relocated and is working to re-establish the nutrition education program. In 2017, the hospital took the following actions: *Within the first 12 months, developed a nutrition-education plan using the American Diabetes Association (ADA) Diabetes Management (DM) Program for patients referred by physician practices at the Urbana Hospital Chronic Disease Clinic. The program was offered through the Department of Health and the local YMCA in 2017. *Collaborated with Springfield Regional Medical Group (SRMG) physician practices to develop a referral process to the Urbana Hospital Dietitian. *The hospital has partnered with the schools to develop and promote healthy-eating education programs to be presented once a year for the middle and high schools in Champaign County. Hospital representatives worked with students and are in process of developing video presentations that will be presented to elementary school students on healthy eating and exercise. In 2017, education programs were presented to 38 students at Graham High School. The hospital also presented to and played educational games under the 5-2-1 Almost None program with 250 parents and kids at a healthy kids day. *Urbana Hospital is developing a plan for diabetic education at the Urbana Hospital Chronic Disease Clinic. In 2017, the hospital took the following actions: *Established extended-hour appointments and offered 6 diabetic educational classes in the evenings. *Tracked the number of referrals by PCP/Medical Homes to education programs and provided SRMG with appropriate educational materials to share with patients during appointments to promote referrals to the classes. 8 patients were referred by their PCP to the diabetic education programs in 2017. Additionally, 2 patients were independent. *Of the patients who participated in the diabetic education programs, 5 patients (or 50%) completed all the components of the program and met their goals as it relates to improve their overall health. Mental Health Implementation Activities: Goal: To investigate precision medicine as a tool for physicians to individualize therapeutic drug choice by using genotype to predict positive clinical outcomes, adverse reactions and levels of drug metabolism for effective support of patients' depression disorders. 2017 Strategies and Outcomes: *In 2017, Pharmacogenics (Precision Medicine) Technology was introduced to 30 Mercy Health physicians and advance practice nurses to track treatment effectiveness and results for patients diagnosed with depression. *The hospital's Chronic Care Clinic utilized the results from a study focused on pharmacogenomics to improve response and remission for major depressive disorder. The study involved 1,167 patients through a randomized controlled trial (RCT). Mercy was not involved in the study, but utilized the results to support the care of patients with depression. *In 2017, insurance providers used by patients were surveyed to determine if mental health testing by GeneSight is covered. It was determined that GeneSight is covered by approximately 50% commercial insurance companies and 100% covered by Medicare, Medicaid, Buckeye, Molina, Care Source and Tri Care. *The hospital continues to investigate grant funding for testing to support patients without insurance coverage. Substance Abuse Implementation Activities: Goal: Patients discharged from Urbana Hospital with an overdose-related diagnoses be referred to Urbana Hospital Chronic Clinic and/or Community Mercy REACH program for substance abuse prevention treatment and support 2017 Strategies and Outcomes: *Urbana Hospital continues to focus on identifying and admitting patients to the inpatient detox treatment program at Springfield Regional Medical Center (SRMC) through Mercy REACH. Clients are scheduled in identified detox appointment times to avoid waiting list. Upon completion of an assessment, a therapist contacts SRMC to refer client for first available bed and SRMC will call client for admission. Mercy REACH had appointment openings identified as detox assessment only to avoid clients waiting to receive services. The hospital's goal is to provide detox services to as many patients as needed. In 2017, 13 clients were referred to the detox treatment program from Champaign County compared to 9 clients in 2016. *Mercy REACH opened an Intensive Outpatient Program (IOP) at SRMC for patients discharged from the inpatient detox program to establish sobriety skills. In 2017, 209 patients were assessed for the IOP program. Of those 209 patients, 190 attended the program and 151 completed the program in 2017. *Worked with Urbana Hospital Chronic Care Clinic to establish a Vivitrol injection program. The program supports client eligible for monthly Vivitrol injections to help prevent relapse to opioid dependence. Clients interested in receiving the Vivitrol injection are reviewed by Medical Director for appropriate referral to Chronic Care Clinic to schedule injection, and the number of injections and length of stay (2-3 months up to 9-10 months) can vary depending on clients' sobriety needs. In 2017, approximately 12 people received Vivitrol injections compared to approximately 8 people receiving the Vivitrol injections in 2016.

Carilion Clinic's CHNAs are community-driven projects and success is highly dependent on involving citizens, health and human service agencies, businesses, and community leaders. Community stakeholder collaborations known as ""Community Health Assessment Teams"" (CHAT) lead the CHNA projects. The CHAT consists of: health and human service agency leaders; persons with special knowledge of, or expertise in, public health; the local health department; and leaders, representatives, or members of populations that are medically underserved, low-income, minority, and suffer from chronic diseases. The following organizations served on the CHAT for the 2018 (tax year 2017) RVCHNA: Blue Blaze Consulting, Blue Ridge Behavioral Healthcare, Bradley Free Clinic, Carilion Clinic, Community Health Improvement Plan of Roanoke Valley (CHIP), City of Roanoke Lead Safe Roanoke, Family Service of Roanoke Valley, Freedom First Credit Union, HRV, High Street Baptist Church, Jefferson College of Health Sciences, Local Environmental Agricultural Project (LEAP), New Horizons Healthcare, Rescue Mission Ministries, Inc., Roanoke College, Roanoke Redevelopment and Housing Authority, Roanoke Regional Chamber of Commerce, Salem VA Medical Center, United Way of Roanoke Valley, and the Virginia Department of Health.In addition to the CHAT, the RVCHNA conducted focus groups among stakeholders and target populations, and administered a community health survey. Stakeholders: Throughout the CHNA process, community stakeholders, leaders, and providers were encouraged to complete the Stakeholder Survey. This survey provided an additional perspective to the health needs and barriers facing our community. Stakeholder focus groups were held and Stakeholder Surveys distributed, to ensure all responses were captured. The survey was available online and in print, and was distributed at meetings and focus groups. Stakeholder focus groups were conducted with the City of Roanoke (Fire/EMS Station #5 & #6, and Police Department), HRV partners and friends (brought together for a Stakeholder Forum), and the Roanoke Valley Palliative Care Partnership. Target populations: Target population focus groups were conducted to capture the needs and barriers to health for the uninsured, underinsured, low-income, minority, senior, and chronically ill populations. Focus group locations were chosen based on their proximity to target populations, and where existing groups meet. Ten target population focus groups were held and were asked questions related to health needs and barriers to health, as well as access to primary, oral, and mental health care. Target population focus groups were conducted with AARP members, a women's group comprised of former immigrants to the United States, a Blue Ridge Literacy English for Speakers of Other Languages (ESOL) class, Bradley Free Clinic patients, residents of Roanoke Redevelopment Housing Authority's Melrose Towers (in the NW Roanoke City MUA) and Morningside Manor (in the SE Roanoke City MUA), certified peer recovery specialists, Presbyterian Community Center parents and staff, and Roanoke Rescue Mission guests. Community Survey: A 39-question survey instrument was developed including questions about: socioeconomic factors; access to medical, dental, and mental health care; health behaviors; physical environment; health outcomes; and demographics. The survey instrument included commonly used questions and metrics from previously validated community surveys: Community Themes and Strengths Assessments, National Association of County and City Health Officials (NACCHO), Mobilizing for Action through Planning and Partnerships (MAPP) Community Healthy Living Index, YMCA Behavioral Risk Factor Surveillance System, Centers for Disease Control (CDC) National Health Interview Survey, Youth Risk Behavior Surveillance System, Martin County Community Health Assessment, Martin County, North Carolina Previous Roanoke Valley Community Health Surveys Both English and Spanish versions were available (Appendix 4: Community Health Survey). The CHAT and HRV Data Tracking and Quality Improvement Action Team identified target populations, collection sites, and methods of survey distribution. The population of interest was Roanoke Valley residents 18 years of age and older. The Roanoke Valley included the CHNA service area: Bedford, Botetourt, Craig and Roanoke counties, and Roanoke City, and Salem City. Special efforts were made to ensure inclusion of these subpopulations: Underserved/vulnerable populations disproportionately impacted by the social determinants of health including:o Incomeo Race/ethnicityo Educationo Insurance statusThe survey was also made available to all residents living in the Roanoke Valley, and oversampling of the target populations occurred through targeted outreach efforts. In total, 2,308 surveys were collected."

201942279349303564,540506332,"Part V, Section B, line 11:","The following explanation applies to both Facility 1 and Facility 2.Carilion Medical Center's two hospital facilities, Carilion Roanoke Memorial Hospital and Carilion Roanoke Community Hospital, partnered with HRV to conduct the 2018 RVCHNA during the 2017 tax year. HRV, operating under the auspices of the United Way of Roanoke Valley, was formed in 2012 as a community response to needs identified in Carilion Medical Center's triennial Roanoke Valley CHNA.Carilion Clinic is a not-for-profit, integrated healthcare system located in Virginia's Blue Ridge Mountains with its flagship hospital in the heart of the City of Roanoke, the largest urban hub in western Virginia. There, through a comprehensive network of hospitals, primary and specialty physician practices, wellness centers and other complimentary services, the system provides quality care close to home for nearly one million Virginians. Carilion roots go back to 1899, when a group of dedicated citizens came together and built a hospital to meet the healthcare needs of the community. Today, Carilion is a key anchor institution focusing on more than just healthcare; Carilion is dedicated to its mission of improving the health of the communities we serve. With an enduring commitment to the health of our region, Carilion advances care through clinical services, medical education, research and community health investments. Carilion believes in service, collaboration and caring for all. Through ongoing investment in discovering and responding to the health needs of the community comes the understanding that the involvement of additional stakeholders is essential to effectively address community health issues and create change. The purpose of this implementation strategy is to describe what Carilion Medical Center (CMC), comprised of Carilion Roanoke Memorial Hospital (CRMH) and Carilion Roanoke Community Hospital (CRCH), plans to do to address the community health needs identified in the 2018 RVCHNA.After all primary and secondary data collection was completed, the CHAT reviewed all data then identified and prioritized the ten most pertinent community needs using the Robert Wood Johnson Foundation (RWJF) framework for what influences health. The data were combined and overall priorities chosen based on the number of times a category was selected in the top 10, with the average ranking serving as a tie-breaker. Once the priorities were clearly identified, the CHAT rated the feasibility and potential impact of solutions for each health issue. HRV hosted strategic planning and action team tactical planning meetings focused on each identified priority need. The findings of the 2018 RVCHNA revealed 10 priority health-related issues in the community, identified by the CHAT after review of the data collected. 1. Poverty / low average household income2. Transportation / transit system3. Access to mental / behavioral health servicesa. Access to substance use services4. Culture: healthy behaviors not a priority5. High uninsured / underinsured population6. Affordable / safe housing7. Access to dental care8. Poor diet9. High cost of care10. Educational attainmentSignificant Health Needs to be AddressedCMC Implementation PlanAccording to the RWJF County Health Rankings , where an individual lives, works and plays is a strong predictor of their health outcomes. Currently in the United States, a person's zip code can help predict their life expectancy due to its direct link to the social determinants of health such as poverty, race/ethnicity, education and employment status in these areas . These factors are so important to our overall health, that they were added to the 10-year national Healthy People 2020 objectives with a goal to create social and physical environments that promote good health for all."" Carilion responds to community health needs in innovative ways: making sure our regions have access to state-of-the-art health care close to home; providing community grants and sponsorships to extend our mission and support other organizations addressing health needs; creating and implementing community-wide strategies to reduce barriers, coordinate resources and enhance community strengths; and providing community-based health and wellness programs. Carilion's response strategies are organized by the RWJF framework for what influences health: health behaviors; social and economic factors; clinical care access and quality; and physical environment. CommitmentCommitment to community service is evident at all levels of the organization. In 2016, Carilion committed more than $170 million toward activities that improve community health and social determinants of health. Carilion's commitment to community health is evidenced by its commitment to a population health infrastructure including an entire Community Health and Outreach (CHO) department dedicated to assessing and addressing community need. The department is responsible for leading and facilitating the CHIP, CHNAs, the system's community grant process, community health education, community benefit collection, and neighborhood health initiatives. CHO has staff at the system level and at each community hospital and works with each hospital's Board of Directors and Carilion Clinic's Board of Governors to create health improvement strategies to address community health need. Each Carilion Clinic hospital has a Community Benefit Team which oversees the local hospital's plan to address community need in partnership with the local CHAT. There is also a Community Benefit Council at the system level providing oversight for Carilion Clinic as a whole. This council is responsible for overseeing and strategically guiding Carilion's community health improvement work and for community benefit strategy, collection and submission.Community Partnerships Carilion believes in the power of collaboration and understands community health issues must be addressed in cooperation with the community. To ensure lasting community impact from the health assessment and community health improvement process, Carilion participates in and provides financial and in-kind support to community health coalitions that address health needs in the Roanoke Valley such as HRV. In addition, Carilion partners with multiple community and business organizations on initiatives to improve health and wellness and to impact the social determinants of health for all who live in the Roanoke Valley.Healthy Roanoke ValleyForming a true community collaborative with lasting impact is no small feat. In 2012, using the Strive Collective Impact model, Carilion and United Way played key convening roles, bringing together strategic community partners to create HRV. An initiative of United Way of Roanoke Valley, HRV is now a partnership of more than 50 organizations striving to enhance health equity related to these priorities as a means to create a ""culture of wellness"" across the Roanoke Valley.For years, HRV has been serving as a key partner with Carilion. HRV's strategic framework, which is updated every three years to align with the triennial CHNA, is community-driven and a major component of Carilion's Health Improvement Implementation Strategy for the Roanoke Valley. In 2012 and again in 2015, HRV identified three priorities for improving health outcomes in the Roanoke Valley for underserved populations: access to services (primary care, behavioral health, and oral health); coordination of care; and wellness. HRV will conduct a planning retreat with its steering committee and tactical planning with its action teams in response to the health priorities identified in the 2018 RVCHNA. Carilion provides both financial and in-kind support to HRV with representatives active on the HRV steering committee and all five action teams: wellness; mental health; primary care; oral health; and coordination of care.Through HRV, multiple programs and strategies have arisen in response to community needs, such as Fresh Foods Rx and the Pathways Community HUB. Carilion provides additional support to implement these strategies in the Roanoke Valley."
201942279349303564,540506332,"Part V, Section B, Line 11 Continued","Fresh Foods RxFresh Foods Rx is a 12-week program providing patients with weekly health education, peer and physician support and vouchers for fresh local fruits and vegetables from the LEAP Mobile Market. The program is designed to address both social determinants of health, particularly environments and behaviors linked to healthy nutrition choices and fruit and vegetable consumption, and the clinical care needs of patients. The program works with low-income, uninsured and publicly insured adult patients living in MUAs who are overweight or obese and who have been diagnosed with diabetes.Community partners include: HRV, New Horizons Healthcare, LEAP for Local Food, Virginia Cooperative Extension, and YMCA of Roanoke Valley.Pathways Community HUBThe Pathways Community HUB is a community-based care coordination system anchored by community health workers strategically located in two Carilion teaching practices in the City of Roanoke, at Carilion Community Care and at partners' clinics. The model addresses social determinants of health. Community Health Workers link clients and their families to resources and services. The program works to reduce barriers to good health for uninsured adults who regularly visit the CRMH emergency department and have chronic disease diagnoses.Community partners include: Bradley Free Clinic, the Rescue Mission's G. Wayne Fralin Free Clinic, Mental Health America of Roanoke Valley, New Horizons Healthcare and United Way of Roanoke Valley's HRV. Community Grants Carilion is committed to improving the health of the communities we serve by addressing key health priorities identified through our triennial CHNA. Carilion fulfills this commitment in many ways, one of which is through targeted grants for community health improvement programs and those affecting the social determinants of health. Carilion provides a multitude of community grants and community health sponsorships to help local charitable organizations fulfill their missions as they relate to the health and well-being of our communities. Community grant dollars are allocated across the entire Carilion Clinic service area based on requests received. During this three-year Implementation Strategy cycle, Carilion Clinic intends to target additional grant support by initiating a Request for Proposal (RFP) process, looking for organizations that can impact specific community health priorities in identified geographic areas.Targeted Neighborhood InitiativesCMC's community health goal is to improve health and well-being for the entire Roanoke Valley, especially for those individuals living in MUAs. The City of Roanoke tends to perform worse than other Roanoke Valley communities in many health and social determinant indicators. Therefore, efforts are often focused on the MUAs in the Northwest and Southeast areas of the City of Roanoke. CMC plans to address key community health needs identified in the 2018 assessment by focusing additional investment in the Southeast MUA, located adjacent to CRMH. Through greater access to clinical care and community outreach programs, creative community partnerships and focused financial and in-kind support of initiatives, CMC plans to improve community health in the Southeast neighborhood. Key focus areas of this health improvement project over the next three years include access to services, coordination of care and wellness. Fallon Park ProjectCarilion is working with Roanoke City Public Schools and other partners to expand access to health care services and wellness opportunities for children and families and to create a community space in the updated Fallon Park Elementary School, located in the Southeast area of the city. The first phase of work is programmatic: to address students with chronic conditions such as asthma at the school. The goal is to reduce the number of sick days, emergency department visits and hospitalizations, and to improve asthma control scores. This partnership will transform the school nursing program to utilize a more integrated, holistic and proactive approach to health; provide families with community space and health education; and make Community Health Workers available to assist families with coordination of care and social determinant of health needs. Community partners include: Roanoke City Public Schools; Carilion Community Health and Outreach; Virginia Tech Cooperative Extension; HRV; Big Brothers Big Sisters; Carilion Wellness; Carilion departments of Psychiatry, Pediatrics and Family and Community Medicine; Delta Dental; Freedom First Credit Union; and the Fralin Biomedical Research Institute.Significant Health Priorities to be Addressed:Health BehaviorsNeeds: culture: healthy behaviors not a priority; poor diet.Carilion addressed health behavior-related priorities from the 2018 RVCHNA. Improving poor diets and the general health culture served as a start to making healthy behaviors more of a priority. Carilion provides a variety of free health education classes, screenings and flu immunizations in community settings. Community health education is provided by the CHO department as well as by Trauma Outreach, dieticians, Carilion Wellness, homecare, hospice and select other departments. Health and wellness education topics include: general wellness; healthy eating and activity; anti-inflammatory diet; tobacco cessation; infant safe sleep; infant and child safety; wilderness medicine; emergency care in the case of gun wound; exercise for balance and confidence building for seniors; stress management; warning signs for heart attack and stroke; women's health; and other topics as requested. Health educators also lead guided public walks and hikes and Carilion supports Roanoke's local Bikeshare program, organized by Ride Solutions, helping improve access to exercise and transportation. Resources committed to these programs include staff time, volunteer hours, and food and giveaway items that encourage healthy behaviors. The Morningside Urban Farm will host many health education classes, encouraging people to learn to eat healthy and grow fresh produce for their consumption. Programs such as Fresh Foods Rx encourage healthy eating through prescription vouchers to access healthy food paired with education and coaching. In addition to community events, Carilion works to encourage healthy behaviors by offering classes to its employees and through partnerships with other employers in the Roanoke Valley. As the largest employer in the region, efforts to engage employees and their families in their own health impact community health overall. Carilion has rolled out the Virgin Pulse program to employees. This program enables employees to connect personal activity trackers and include others on the platform to encourage daily healthy behaviors such as exercise, climbing stairs, and planning healthy diets. Support groups also often contribute to wellness. Support groups are offered for grief and loss counseling, cancer treatment and recovery, and attention to diabetes and other chronic conditions.A key part of wellness is compliance with safety and preventive behaviors. CMC coordinates child passenger safety trainings and child safety seat checks to reduce injuries from car accidents. Carilion family practices will also offer gun locks for free to members of the community to encourage gun safety. As part of infant safe sleep classes, Carilion provides participants with a free Pack and Play as well as a free Sleep Sack, when available. Infants born in Carilion hospitals also receive a free Sleep Sack, when available, to encourage safe sleep practices.Carilion remains committed to addressing poor diets. Through the Local Foods Program, Carilion provides hundreds of thousands of dollars of support to improve access to healthy foods. Community grants, such as one doubling the value of Supplemental Nutrition Assistance Program (SNAP) benefits, makes health foods more affordable and accessible in the Roanoke Valley. In addition to community grants, CMC makes a Farm Share program available to its employees and their families through payroll deduction. CMC also serves as an additional pick-up option for community members participating in the Farm Share. Carilion remains committed to the Healthier Hospital Initiative pledge and continues to work to improve quantities of healthy, local, sustainable foods purchased and served through its cafeterias. Carilion's Morningside Urban Farm will bring fresh foods to the Southeast Roanoke City community and will enable new opportunities for health education and incentives."
201942279349303564,540506332,"Part V, Section B, Line 11 Continued","Clinical CareNeeds: access to mental health and substance use services; access to dental care; high uninsured/underinsured population; high cost of care.Issues with access to care are a focus for CMC when addressing community health needs. In addition to providing financial support to qualifying patients who cannot afford care, Carilion is working to improve affordable access to care and resources.To improve access to primary care and resources for adolescents, CMC partners with Roanoke City Public Schools to operate Adolescent Health Clinics in Patrick Henry High School and William Fleming High School in the City of Roanoke, plus a stand-alone clinic in downtown Roanoke. With parent waivers signed at the start of the school year, students can visit health professionals as needed at clinics conveniently located in the schools, regardless of students' ability to pay. Mental health and substance use servicesThrough a new program, #AllIn, Carilion is providing additional access to non-traditional services for mental health and substance use. A key component of #AllIn, peer support, has expanded the type of care people in the Roanoke Valley can access. Carilion trained peer recovery specialists in the Roanoke Valley to provide support groups in community and clinical settings as well as support for patients who come to the hospital with mental health or substance use issues. Peer recovery specialists have a unique perspective into mental health and substance use diseases, having personally experienced these conditions. In addition, the #AllIn program is offering Mental Health First Aid trainings in the community and helping to initiate college-level advocacy groups. Carilion's Opioid Task Force brings together expertise from throughout the Carilion system to better understand and address the opioid epidemic in Southwest Virginia. The Opioid Task Force is working to address this epidemic internally and in the community. Efforts arising from this task force include: developing system-wide guidelines and a system dashboard for opioid prescriptions; developing treatment pathways for opioid addiction in specific high-risk groups; developing best practices for risk assessment, treatment and standard orders in Carilion's electronic medical record system, EPIC; developing an inventory of community resources related to prevention, treatment and recovery services for opioid patients and community members; and providing locations for free, safe, prescription drug returns or deactivation bags.Carilion provides both financial and in-kind support for the Mental Health America Collaborative. This program increases access to psychiatric care and medication for people without health insurance in the Roanoke Valley. Carilion psychiatry residents and physicians volunteer their time and provide in-kind services through this program. Physicians and residents also provide in-kind services to individuals through the Rescue Mission's Fralin Free Clinic. Dental careCarilion hosts pediatric and adult dental clinics in Roanoke and operates a dental residency program. Dental residents provide in-kind dental services through the Rescue Mission's Fralin Free Clinic. Located in Southeast Roanoke, the Rescue Mission is a comprehensive crisis intervention center for men, women and children. Oral health is also prioritized through the HRV Oral Health Action Team with support provided by the DentaQuest Foundation.High uninsured / underinsured population and high cost of careCarilion is committed to helping improve access to affordable medical care in our communities. With expansion of Medicaid in the Commonwealth of Virginia, Carilion will work diligently in the coming months to develop a plan for outreach and enrollment in Medicaid for newly eligible beneficiaries. Additionally, Carilion will work to find medical homes for those newly enrolled. Carilion will also work closely with its FQHC partners to understand their Medicaid enrollment efforts. Community Health Workers, managed by Healthy Roanoke Valley through the Pathways HUB, and other partners will also have additional opportunities to help clients complete insurance pathways and to pair them with appropriate services once they are enrolled.Carilion physicians provide in-kind services to uninsured people through the Bradley Free Clinic. Individuals can access regular care and medications as well as coordinate lab services through Carilion financial assistance. Medication access for Bradley Free Clinic patients is improved through RX Partnership, which Carilion supports with financial resources.Social and Economic FactorsNeeds: poverty; transportation; affordable / safe housing; educational attainment.The City of Roanoke was recently identified as a City of Opportunity by the National League of Cities. With this title comes a wealth of support and guidance as the City of Roanoke, with Carilion as a key partner, works to improve health outcomes for residents. The Cities of Opportunity project improves health by impacting the social determinants of health such as: education opportunities; affordable, safe housing; economic opportunities for residents; transportation; safe neighborhoods; and affordable, healthy foods. Carilion has committed to be a partner in this work as it aligns directly with the findings of the 2018 RVCHNA. The direction of the action plan will guide investments Carilion makes in the social determinants of health. In its commitment to reducing inequity of care, Carilion provides financial support for people who cannot afford insurance or health care. Carilion also makes available a Medication Assistance Program helping people gain access to affordable medication. Carilion also replenishes medication carried aboard emergency medical services vehicles. Support is also provided to a variety of not-for-profit organizations, helping to reduce the impacts of poverty on health through investments in social determinants such as housing, transportation, employment, education, access to healthy foods and many other important causes. Each year, Carilion Clinic coordinates a system-wide United Way campaign through which employees can provide additional support to these causes.The Pathways HUB model employs community health workers to help people navigate the barriers to good health and find solutions to health care needs. Many of the Pathways are related to social determinants such as education, employment, transportation or affordable/safe housing. This coordination of care model will help people find ways to reduce these types of barriers to good health. Community health workers will also be engaged through the Fallon Park Elementary School project to provide guidance on care and social determinants of health for families.The Virginia Tech Carilion Health Sciences and Technology Campus in the City of Roanoke will spur economic growth for the region through job growth, spending at the campus, student populations and research grant funds. Growth is expected to continue through at least 2026. Community partners, including Carilion, start early outreach in schools to inspire future health care workers and to create education pathways for all. The community, Virginia Western Community College and local universities have partnered to make it possible for local students to access affordable or free education. TransportationCarilion recognizes the impact that lack of reliable transportation can have on health in the community. In an effort to improve access to transportation for the purpose of accessing regular health care, Carilion provides support for the City of Roanoke's Trolley. The Trolley provides free transportation from downtown Roanoke to Carilion Roanoke Memorial Hospital and points in between, including the Riverside Center campus that is home to Virginia Tech Carilion and many Carilion clinical services. Carilion has forged a partnership with Lyft to begin assisting people with access to safe, reliable transportation to regular primary care appointments. If successful, Carilion will explore ways to expand the program.Physical EnvironmentWhile physical environment did not necessarily arise as a top priority in the 2018 RVCHNA, Carilion still recognizes the impact the environment has on the health of our communities. Therefore, efforts continue to improve the efficiency of Carilion's hospitals and other structures, the utilization of recycling and recyclable or bio-degradable materials where possible, the reduction of waste and the utilization of local, sustainable foods.In addition, as part of the aforementioned Fallon Park Elementary School project in Southeast Roanoke, partners will address air quality and other environmental issues that contribute to poor health, specifically breathing-related conditions."
201942279349303564,540506332,"Part V, Section B, Line 11 Continued","Implementation and MeasurementCarilion has invested in multiple systems to help manage data and track outcomes of our community work. Clear Impact software will be utilized to develop community, system-wide, hospital-specific and project-specific scorecards with appropriate outcome measures. Community health education programs and screenings will contain program level outcomes assigned based on the topic. These outcomes will be tracked with pre- and post-tests as well as through screening results. Community programs supported by Carilion grants will be responsible for regularly reporting program outcomes. Scorecards will be developed with key secondary data points at the zip code and county level, with yearly updates to track impact of community health initiatives. Carilion will track and measure impact on certain aligned indicators contributing to the Robert Wood Johnson Foundation County Health Factors Ranking and County Health Outcomes Ranking. Our goal is to improve County Health Rankings for the entire Roanoke Valley, but we understand that by the nature of County Health Rankings, improvements are relative to improvements in other communities within the Commonwealth of Virginia. Another software program, REDCap, will enable internal data to be utilized at the aggregate level to display outcomes of targeted health initiatives for research teams, such as one focus on asthma interventions at Fallon Park Elementary School. Esri ArcMap will enable Carilion to communicate outcomes and impact through story maps. Outcome results will be utilized for future planning and decision making.Healthy Roanoke Valley will also develop outcomes to be measured based on the results of its planning retreat and action team tactical planning in fall 2018.Priority Areas Not being Addressed and the ReasonsA community approach to determine and address priority needs as described earlier in this document was used to determine which needs cannot be immediately addressed. The needs not identified as ""priority"" are those that will not be actively addressed in this time period.

Through IPHI's Center for Community Capacity Development, IPHI supports non-profit hospitals, local health departments, and other community groups to conduct community health assessment and planning activities to improve health and increase health equity. The CHNA process included three community input data collection methods: a focus group with NorthShore staff, a focus group with community leaders, and an online survey sent to all Community Advisory Committee members. Priority health issues were identified by NorthShore staff in partnership with IPHI by looking at findings from across all the assessment data and perspectives. The NorthShore staff leaders focus group was comprised of 18 staff members representing a range of departments throughout NorthShore including Emergency Medicine, Family Medicine, Kellogg Cancer Center, Nursing, Internal Medicine, Social Services, Cardiology, Psychiatry, Quality Improvement, and Infection Control. The group discussed prominent health and wellness issues and barriers and assets to health in the communities NorthShore serves. Finally, participants discussed potential strategies to address barriers to community health and well-being. The community leaders focus group was comprised of about 20 representatives from NorthShore's Community Advisory Committees.

NorthShore evaluates the impact of the initiatives developed to address the identified needs by collecting data on how many individuals utilize components of the initiative. Measurement of the impact was also assessed by gathering ongoing feedback from the hospitals' Community Advisory Committees, along with feedback from senior and physician leadership. The needs identified in the most recently conducted CHNA were: Access and Coordination of Care, Access to Behavioral Health, Health Literacy and Navigating the Health Care Environment, Access to Healthy and Affordable Food, Access to Oral Health Care, Chronic Disease Risk Factors (obesity, tobacco use, hypertension), Behavioral Health, Oral Health, Cardiovascular Disease and Stroke, Diabetes, Cancer, Alzheimer's/Dementia, Lung Health, and Material and Child Health.

IT INCLUDES CVPH AND CCHD PLANNED ACTIONS, ANTICIPATED IMPACT, AND A PLAN TO EVALUATE THESE ACTIONS FOR THE TWO AREAS OF PRIORITIZED.NEED: OBESITY IN CHILDREN AND ADULTS AND ACCESS TO HIGH QUALITY CHRONIC DISEASE PREVENTIVE CARE AND MANAGEMENT IN CLINICAL AND COMMUNITY SETTINGS AND PREVENT SUBSTANCE ABUSE AND OTHER MENTAL, EMOTIONAL AND BEHAVIORAL DISORDERS. EVIDENCE BASED INTERVENTIONS ARE UTILIZED THROUGHOUT THE PLAN WITH SPECIFIC DATA RESOURCES THAT WILL BE TRACKED. IT SHOULD BE NOTED THAT THIS IS A THREE YEAR PLAN. WHILE THE GOALS, OBJECTIVES, AND STRATEGIES ARE LONG TERM, THE ACTIVITIES ARE PRIMARILY FOCUSED FOR THE FIRST YEAR. EACH YEAR, THE ACTIVITIES WILL BE EVALUATED AND ADJUSTED AS NEEDED. SOME OF THE ACTIVITIES COULD ROLL OVER AND REMAIN THE SAME, BE CHANGED SLIGHTLY, OR BE ADJUSTED ENTIRELY IF IT IS DETERMINED THEY ARE NOT MOVING US TOWARDS OUR GOALS AND OBJECTIVES. HEALTH PRIORITY 1: PREVENT CHRONIC DISEASETHE PURPOSE OF THIS PRIORITY IS TO ASSIST NYS IN ADDRESSING CHRONIC DISEASES AND THEIR CAUSES TO EFFECTIVELY STEM THE TIDE OF ESCALATING HEALTH CARE COSTS AND ENSURE THAT NEW YORKERS LEAD HEALTHY AND PRODUCTIVE LIVES. CHRONIC DISEASES SUCH AS CANCER, DIABETES, HEART DISEASE, STROKE AND ASTHMA ARE CONDITIONS OF LONG DURATION AND GENERALLY SLOW PROGRESSION. THEY ARE AMONG THE MOST PREVENTABLE OF ALL DISEASES. THREE MODIFIABLE RISK BEHAVIORS - LACK OF PHYSICAL ACTIVITY, UNHEALTHY NUTRITION, AND TOBACCO USE - ARE LARGELY RESPONSIBLE FOR THE INCIDENCE, SEVERITY AND ADVERSE OUTCOMES OF CHRONIC DISEASE.THE NEW YORK STATE PREVENTION AGENDA PLACES EMPHASIS ON THREE KEY AREAS IN REGARDS TO PREVENTING CHRONIC DISEASE: 1) HEALTH PROMOTION ACTIVITIES TO ENCOURAGE HEALTHY LIVING AND LIMIT THE ONSET OF CHRONIC DISEASES; 2) EARLY DETECTION OPPORTUNITIES THAT INCLUDE SCREENING POPULATIONS AT RISK; AND 3) SUCCESSFUL MANAGEMENT STRATEGIES FOR EXISTING DISEASES AND RELATED COMPLICATIONS.FOCUS AREA 1: REDUCE OBESITY IN CHILDREN AND ADULTSTHE GOAL AROUND THIS FOCUS AREA IS CREATING COMMUNITY ENVIRONMENTS THAT PROMOTE AND SUPPORT HEALTHY FOOD AND BEVERAGE CHOICES AND PHYSICAL ACTIVITY. THE TWO EVIDENCE BASED LONG TERM OBJECTIVES CHOSEN ARE AROUND DECREASING THE PERCENTAGE OF CLINTON COUNTY ADULTS WHO REPORT PARTICIPATING IN NO LEISURE TIME ACTIVITY AND INCREASE THE PERCENTAGE OF CLINTON COUNTY ADULTS REPORTING ADEQUATE DAILY FRUIT AND VEGETABLE CONSUMPTION. THE FOLLOWING STATISTICS/INFORMATION WERE USED AS SUPPORT AND RATIONALE IN THE SELECTION OF THIS AS A PRIORITY:- 26.8% OF ADULTS IN CLINTON COUNTY ARE OBESE, COMPARED TO 24.6% IN NYS. THE PREVENTION AGENDA GOAL FOR 2013-2018 IS 23.2% (HEALTHYADK)- 64.0% OF ADULTS IN CLINTON COUNTY ARE OVERWEIGHT OR OBESE, COMPARED TO 60.5% IN NYS (HEALTHYADK)- 37.5% OF ELEMENTARY STUDENTS IN CLINTON COUNTY ARE OVERWEIGHT OR OBESE, COMPARED TO 33.1% IN NYS. THIS HAS GOTTEN 0.2% WORSE IN THE LATEST MEASUREMENT PERIOD (HEALTHYADK)- 41.6% OF MIDDLE AND HIGH SCHOOL STUDENTS IN CLINTON COUNTY ARE OVERWEIGHT OR OBESE. ONLY 35.2% ARE IN THIS CATEGORY FOR NYS (HEALTHYADK)- ONLY 66.8% OF ADULTS IN CLINTON COUNTY HAVE ACCESS TO EXERCISE OPPORTUNITIES, WHILE 90.7% OF ADULTS IN NYS DO (HEALTHYADK) OF THE SUBCATEGORIES UNDER PREVENTING CHRONIC DISEASE, 53% OF SURVEY RESPONDENTS SELECTED THIS FOCUS AREA REDUCE OBESITY IN CHILDREN AND ADULTS).THERE ARE SEVERAL STRATEGIES CVPH AND CCHD WILL BE UTILIZING TO ADDRESS THIS FOCUS AREA AND ACHIEVE THE GOAL AND OBJECTIVES. THEY ARE AS FOLLOWS:- CONDUCT GENERAL EDUCATION FOR HEALTH PROFESSIONALS ON DIET AND EXERCISE WITH A FOCUS ON THE DEVELOPMENT OF A PROGRAM TARGETING NURSES IN CONJUNCTION WITH THE MAGNET APPLICATION PROCESS TO FOCUS ON DIET, EXERCISE, STRESS, COPING, OBESITY AND DISABILITIES. CURRENTLY, THERE ARE NO PROGRAMS LIKE THIS OCCURRING, BUT THE HOPE IS TO COMPLETE ONE PROGRAM PER YEAR AT CVPH WITH THE OPPORTUNITY TO OPEN THIS UP TO NURSES AT THE CCHD.- IMPLEMENTATION OF PROGRAMS TO INCREASE ACCESS TO LEISURE TIME ACTIVITIES FOR MEMBERS OF THE COMMUNITY WITH A FOCUS ON CONTINUATION OF YEAR TWO OF THE FITNESS IN THE PARKS GRANT. SIGNIFICANT PROGRESS HAS BEEN MADE IN YEAR ONE AND THE FOCUS OF YEAR TWO WILL BE AROUND SOCCER GOLF, PICKLE BALL, AND TRANSITIONING OF FITNESS IN PARKS TO THE TOWNS. CVPH WILL WORK TO MAKE TRAIL MAPS PROVIDED BY CCHD AVAILABLE IN HOSPITAL LOCATIONS. THE CCHD WILL FINALIZE ENHANCEMENTS TO ONE ADDITIONAL RECREATIONAL SPACE TO SUPPORT ACTIVITY AS WELL AS FACILITATE COMMUNITY ENTITIES TO SUBMIT PROJECTS TO THE HEALTH FOUNDATION'S MATCHING FUNDS PROGRAM. - CONTINUATION AND EXPANSION OF THE DIABETES PROGRAM WHICH CVPH HAS IMPLEMENTED AND SEEN SIGNIFICANT SUCCESS WITH.- CONTINUED USAGE OF HEALTHY MEAL AND BEVERAGE STANDARDS FOR MEALS SOLD AND SERVED IN THE HOSPITAL WITH A FOCUS ON USING HEALTHY, LOCALLY GROWN FOODS IN THE CAFETERIA AND PATIENT MEALS. THIS WILL FOCUS ON A REGULAR REVIEW OF MENUS, NO SUGAR ADDED OPTIONS, AND INCLUSION OF NUTRITIONALS ON FOOD TO EMPOWER EMPLOYEES AND PATIENTS TO TAKE CONTROL OF THEIR FOOD CHOICES. - EXPAND PARTICIPATION IN LOCAL BETTER CHOICES CERTIFICATION PROGRAM BY RECRUITING AND PROMOTING LOCALLY OWNED RESTAURANTS TO PARTICIPATE IN SEVERAL PROGRAMS. - SUPPORT AND PROMOTE USE OF LOCALLY GROWN FRUITS AND VEGETABLES THROUGHOUT THE CLINTON COUNTY FOOD ENVIRONMENT BY WORKING WITH LOCAL FARMS, INSTITUTE ENVIRONMENTAL CHANGES AT LOCAL FOOD PANTIES, AND DESIGNING AND LAUNCHING A TARGETED MEDIA CAMPAIGN AIMED AT INCREASING DONATIONS TO FOOD PANTRIES. THERE IS SIGNIFICANT OPPORTUNITY TO PROVIDE THIS SUPPORT AND PROMOTION THROUGH THE CVPH MALNUTRITION PROGRAM.CONTINUED ON SCHEDULE O"

THE COMMITTEE BEGAN MEETING IN JUNE 2015 AND WAS COMPRISED OF HOSPITAL, ACADEMIC AND PUBLIC HEALTH PARTNERS. THE COMMITTEE CREATED A SURVEY AND THE FOCUS OF THIS SURVEY WAS TO GARNER FEEDBACK FROM RESIDENTS IN THE REGION ON PRIORITIZING ISSUES THAT ARE BARRIERS TO IMPROVED HEALTH. IN ADDITION, THE COMMITTEE DETERMINED THAT THERE WAS SIGNIFICANT VALUE IN OBTAINING PERSPECTIVES ON HEALTH FROM BOTH INDIVIDUALS AND ORGANIZATIONS THAT PROVIDE SERVICES TO THE COMMUNITY. AS A RESULT, AN ADDITIONAL SURVEY THAT HAD MINOR ADJUSTMENTS MADE FOR THE ORGANIZATIONAL PERSPECTIVE WAS ALSO ADMINISTERED. AFTER THE SURVEY WAS DEVELOPED, IT WAS APPROVED THROUGH THE INSTITUTIONAL REVIEW BOARD THROUGH THE OFFICE OF RESEARCH ADMINISTRATION AT MISSOURI STATE UNIVERSITY AND TRANSLATED INTO SPANISH. THE FULL SURVEY CAN BE FOUND IN THE APPENDIX J OF THE REPORT. SURVEY MONKEY WAS USED TO STREAMLINE THE DATA COLLECTION, COMPILATION AND ANALYSIS. THE SURVEY INCLUDED FOUR POTENTIAL PATHS BASED ON 2 LINKS (ENGLISH AND SPANISH) AND THE FIRST QUESTION (INDIVIDUAL OR ORGANIZATION). THE ANNOUNCEMENT OF THE SURVEY WAS MADE THROUGH A JOINT EFFORT OF ALL PARTICIPATING PARTNERS WITH A COORDINATED PRESS RELEASE. INDIVIDUAL ORGANIZATIONS PROMOTED THE COMPLETION OF THE SURVEY THROUGH EMAIL, NETWORKING, SOCIAL MEDIA AND PROMOTION AT POINT OF SERVICE WITHIN FACILITIES. INCENTIVES WERE NOT OFFERED TO PARTICIPANTS AT ANY POINT OF SURVEY COLLECTION. TO MAXIMIZE THE RESPONSE RATE, THE SURVEY WAS KEPT OPEN AND PROMOTED FROM AUGUST 2015 UNTIL DECEMBER 2015. PRELIMINARY RESULTS WERE COLLECTED AT THE BEGINNING OF NOVEMBER 2015 TO INFORM THE LINE OF QUESTIONING DEVELOPED FOR THE FOCUS GROUPS. FINAL RESULTS WERE THEN TABULATED IN DECEMBER 2015 AND JANUARY 2016. FOCUS GROUPS WERE ALSO USED TARGETING UNDERSERVED, CHRONICALLY ILL AND LOW-POPULATIONS IN EACH COMMUNITY. A RESEARCHER FROM MISSOURI STATE UNIVERSITY'S SOCIOLOGY DEPARTMENT WAS CONTRACTED TO COMPLETE THE FOCUS GROUPS. THE RESEARCHER HAS EXPERIENCE WITH HEALTHCARE AND FOCUS GROUPS. THE RESEARCHER ALSO SERVED ON THE SURVEY COMMITTEE AND WAS AN INTEGRAL PART OF THE PROCESS. AFTER THE TOPICS OF FOCUS WERE IDENTIFIED IN AUGUST 2015, THE RESEARCHER DEVELOPED THE FOCUS GROUP QUESTIONS AND SUBMITTED THEM TO THE SURVEY COMMITTEE AND THE STEERING COMMITTEE TO REVIEW AND PROVIDE FEEDBACK. THE SURVEY COMMITTEE ALSO HELPED DETERMINE THE NUMBER OF FOCUS GROUPS AND THE TARGET AUDIENCE FOR THE FOCUS GROUPS. THE COMMITTEE DETERMINED THAT RESIDENTS WERE THE MOST IMPORTANT GROUP FROM WHICH TO RECEIVE IN-DEPTH FEEDBACK. ADDITIONALLY, THE COMMITTEE DETERMINED THAT IT WAS NECESSARY TO CONDUCT FOCUS GROUPS IN EACH OF THE NINE COMMUNITIES DUE TO VARIANCES IN LOCAL PERCEPTIONS AND BARRIERS. FOCUS GROUP FACILITATOR TRAININGS WERE CONDUCTED IN SEPTEMBER AND OCTOBER 2015, WITH FOCUS GROUPS OCCURRING IN NOVEMBER AND DECEMBER 2015. IN ADDITION, SECONDARY DATA WAS COLLECTED FROM COMMUNITYCOMMONS.ORG AND OTHER SOURCES AND EMERGENCY DEPARTMENT DATA WAS OBTAINED FROM HOSPITAL PARTNERS."

INCREASE PATIENT ENGAGEMENT IN CHRONIC CONDITION SELF-MANAGEMENT -THE CENTER FOR HEALTH IMPROVEMENT EMPLOYS A SKILLED TEAM OF HEALTHCARE PROFESSIONALS WHO DELIVER SUPPORT AND EDUCATION FOR CHRONIC DISEASE MANAGEMENT, NUTRITION SERVICES, AND ADVANCED CARE PLANNING. THEY PROVIDE TOOLS DESIGNED TO INCREASE SELF-MANAGEMENT OF CHRONIC CONDITIONS INCLUDING DIABETES, LUNG DISEASE, CHRONIC PAIN, AND MORE. -IN THE FIRST QUARTER CALENDAR YEAR 2018, A CURRENT STATE ASSESSMENT OF THE CENTER FOR HEALTH IMPROVEMENT WAS CONDUCTED TO DETERMINE THE EFFICACY OF VARIOUS PROGRAMS. AS A RESULT OF THE ASSESSMENT, THE TEAM IS REFINING THE SCOPE OF OFFERINGS TO AN EVIDENCE-BASED, TARGETED PROGRAM SUITE THAT FOCUSES HEAVILY ON IMPROVING CHRONIC CONDITION MANAGEMENT OF PATIENTS. THIS REORGANIZATION AND RESTRUCTURE REMAINS IN PROCESS WITH PLANS FOR FULL IMPLEMENTATION IN THE NEAR FUTURE. -THE NURSING EDUCATION DEPARTMENT AND THE JOINT REPLACEMENT EDUCATORS AT MEYER ORTHOPEDIC CENTER DEVELOPED A PROCESS TO INCREASE TIGR VIDEO EDUCATION VIEWS. MANDATORY EDUCATION WAS EXPANDED TO INCLUDE ALL ADULT PATIENTS WITH A DIAGNOSIS OF PNEUMONIA, HEART FAILURE, ACUTE MI, TOTAL HIP/KNEE REPLACEMENT, OR COPD TO HELP ACHIEVE BEST OUTCOMES WHILE REDUCING READMISSIONS. -AS A RESULT OF THIS INTERVENTION, TIGR VIDEO VIEWS INCREASED FROM 1,618 VIEWS IN JUNE 2017, TO 4,694 VIEWS IN MAY 2018. 2. REDUCE AVOIDABLE HOSPITAL READMISSIONS -IN FEBRUARY 2017, COXHEALTH IMPLEMENTED A PATIENT READMISSION INTERVIEW FORM. WHEN A PATIENT IS READMITTED WITHIN THIRTY DAYS, A CASE MANAGER MEETS WITH THE PATIENT TO DISCUSS THE READMISSION. TO INCREASE THE NUMBER OF PATIENTS INTERVIEWED, COXHEALTH NURSING ADMINISTRATION BEGAN TRAINING NURSES ON LIGHT DUTY TO COMPLETE THE INTERVIEWS IN 2018. TOPICS COVERED IN THE INTERVIEW INCLUDE: >FREQUENCY OF GOOD COMMUNICATION IN THE HOSPITAL REGARDING DIAGNOSIS AND MEDICATIONS. >COMMUNICATION ABOUT DISCHARGE INSTRUCTIONS AND ABILITY TO UNDERSTAND INSTRUCTIONS. >MEDICATION COMPLIANCE AND REASONS FOR ANY DIFFICULTY REMAINING COMPLIANT. >FOLLOW UP APPOINTMENTS WITH A PCP BEING SCHEDULED AND ATTENDED. >REASONS FOR READMISSION, FROM THE PATIENT'S PERSPECTIVE. >>THE INFORMATION GATHERED BY THE CASE MANAGER COMES DIRECTLY FROM THE PATIENT AND IS ENTERED INTO REPORTABLE FIELDS THAT ALLOW FOR DATA COLLECTION. COMMON THEMES FOR AVOIDABLE READMISSIONS WILL BE EASIER TO IDENTIFY AND PREVENT THROUGH THIS PROCESS. -EVIDENCE-BASED BEST PRACTICES TO REDUCE AVOIDABLE READMISSIONS HAVE BEEN IMPLEMENTED AND CONTINUE TO EXPAND. >COXHEALTH HIRED TRANSITIONAL CARE PHARMACISTS WHO DEDICATE THEIR TIME WORKING WITH PATIENTS BEING DISCHARGED TO ENSURE THE PATIENT LEAVES THE HOSPITAL WITH THEIR MEDICATIONS. >NEW EFFORTS ARE IN PLACE TO INCREASE THE NUMBER OF PATIENTS WHO LEAVE THE HOSPITAL WITH THEIR MEDICATIONS THROUGH THE USE OF A FOCUSED, FAST-PACED I-90 PROJECT. >THE CLINIC SUPPORT TEAM HAS BEEN INSTRUMENTAL IN SCHEDULING FOLLOW-UP APPOINTMENTS WITH PATIENTS. THE MAJORITY OF INPATIENT UNITS ARE COVERED BY THE CLINIC SUPPORT TEAM, WHICH MEANS MOST PATIENTS HAVE A FOLLOW UP APPOINTMENT SCHEDULED PRIOR TO LEAVING THE HOSPITAL. >A SUBGROUP COMPRISED OF FRONTLINE STAFF, LEADERS, AND QUALITY IMPROVEMENT EXPERTS HAS FORMED TO FOCUS SPECIFICALLY ON REDUCING HEART FAILURE READMISSIONS. THE GROUP WILL USE DATA TO INFORM DECISIONS ON HOW TO BEST MANAGE OUR PATIENTS WITH FREQUENT INPATIENT STAYS DUE TO HEART FAILURE. 3. INCREASE ACCESS TO TOBACCO CESSATION RESOURCES FOR PATIENTS AND FAMILIES PRESENTING TO OUR HOSPITALS AND CLINICS -AN ASSET ASSESSMENT AND GAP ANALYSIS OF THE SYSTEM'S CURRENT TOBACCO TREATMENT OFFERINGS WAS CONDUCTED EARLIER THIS YEAR. RECOMMENDATIONS FROM THAT ASSESSMENT INCLUDE CREATION AND IMPLEMENTATION OF A CLEARLY OUTLINED REFERRAL PROCESS AND DEFINED RESOURCES; PROMOTION OF THE ASK, ADVISE, ACT/REFER MODEL TO INITIATE INTERVENTION; DEVELOPMENT AND IMPLEMENTATION OF PREOPERATIVE PROTOCOL TO PROMOTE TOBACCO CESSATION 12 HOURS PRE- AND POST-SURGERY. -EARLIER THIS YEAR, WE PROVIDED TRAINING TO 12 KEY COXHEALTH STAFF MEMBERS AND 3 COMMUNITY EDUCATORS. COMPLETION OF THE UMASS EDUCATION CURRICULUM, REQUIRED EXAMS, AND PRACTICE HOURS MAKE CLASS PARTICIPANTS ELIGIBLE FOR CERTIFICATION AS TOBACCO TREATMENT SPECIALISTS. AS A RESULT OF THIS EDUCATION, THERE WILL BE A LARGE INCREASE IN THE AMOUNT OF CESSATION RESOURCES AVAILABLE WITHIN THE SYSTEM. -THE QUIT RATE FOR OUR MFH STONE AND TANEY COUNTIES TOBACCO CESSATION GRANT HAS STEADILY INCREASED SINCE ITS INCEPTION IN 2013, WITH THE CURRENT QUIT RATE FOR 2018 TO DATE AT 75%. AVERAGING ACROSS THE HISTORY OF THE PROGRAM, THE AGGREGATED QUIT RATE IS 53%. -DUE TO THE SUCCESS OF THIS PROGRAM, FOLLOWING THE GRANT'S END ON MAY 31, 2018, WE WERE ABLE TO HIRE A FULL TIME TOBACCO CESSATION COORDINATOR WHO WILL BE RESPONSIBLE FOR COORDINATING SYSTEM EFFORTS TO STANDARDIZE POLICIES AND REFERRAL PROCESSES ACROSS ALL CAMPUSES AND SETTINGS. 4. DECREASE CHILDHOOD OBESITY -THE CARDIAC KIDS PROGRAM IS IMPLEMENTED IN 13 RURAL SCHOOLS IN THE COXHEALTH SERVICE AREA. ITS MAIN OBJECTIVE IS TO SCREEN 5TH GRADE STUDENTS FOR HEALTH INDICATORS THAT PUT THEM AT HIGH RISK FOR DEVELOPING CARDIAC DISEASE. SCREENING BY COXHEALTH STAFF INCLUDES HEIGHT AND WEIGHT MEASUREMENT, BMI CONSULT, AND HEALTH/NUTRITION EDUCATION. -APPROXIMATELY 400 CHILDREN ARE SCREENED ANNUALLY. THOSE WHO ARE DEEMED HIGH RISK ARE REFERRED TO THE COMMITTED TO KIDS PROGRAM. THIS 8-WEEK PROGRAM IS AN INTENSIVE INTERVENTION FOR AT-RISK CHILDREN AND THEIR FAMILIES FOCUSING ON HEATHY BEHAVIOR AND NUTRITION EDUCATION. -PLANS ARE IN PLACE TO FURTHER INTEGRATE THE TWO PROGRAMS TO PROVIDE A COHESIVE UNIT AND BETTER UTILIZE RESOURCES TO SERVE AT-RISK COMMUNITIES. 5. INCREASE THE NUMBER OF WOMEN WHO BREASTFEED THEIR INFANTS AFTER DELIVERY -COXHEALTH AND THE SPRINGFIELD-GREENE COUNTY HEALTH DEPARTMENT ARE CURRENTLY ENGAGED IN A COMMUNITY BREASTFEEDING COALITION WITH THE GOAL OF STRATEGICALLY ALIGNING EFFORTS TO HELP MOVE THE CHIP INITIATIVE FORWARD. -IN ADDITION TO EDUCATION PRESENTED IN OUR GENERAL PRENATAL CLASSES, THE COXHEALTH LACTATION CONSULTANTS FACILITATE A MONTHLY BREASTFEEDING SUPPORT GROUP CALLED THE LACTATION CLUB. -THE ANNUAL COXHEALTH BABY FAIR IS A FREE EVENT THAT FEATURES VENDOR DISPLAYS, DEMONSTRATIONS, DOOR PRIZES, AND CLASSES WITH A VARIETY OF TOPICS INCLUDING BREASTFEEDING. 6. INCREASE DETECTION AND TREATMENT OF THE EARLIEST STAGES OF LUNG CANCER NODULES -COXHEALTH OFFERS LOW-DOSE CT SCANS AS A DIAGNOSTIC SCREENING FOR LUNG CANCER. LOW-DOSE CT SCANS USE LOWER AMOUNTS OF RADIATION TO HELP IDENTIFY LUNG NODULES IN THE EARLIEST STAGES OF LUNG CANCER WHEN IT IS MOST TREATABLE. STUDIES HAVE SHOWN THAT PATIENTS WHO PARTICIPATE IN A LOW-DOSE CT LUNG CANCER PROGRAM ARE 20% LESS LIKELY TO DIE FROM LUNG CANCER THAN THOSE WHO WERE NOT SCREENED WHEN APPROPRIATE. -SINCE THE PROGRAM BEGAN, THE NUMBER OF INDIVIDUALS WHO HAD A LOW-DOSE CT SCAN COMPLETED HAS INCREASED NEARLY THREE-FOLD. AS A RESULT, 354 PEOPLE HAVE BEEN SCREENED FOR EARLY STAGE LUNG CANCER USING LOW-DOSE CT SCAN TECHNOLOGY. -THE GOAL OF DEVELOPING A REFERRAL PATHWAY BETWEEN THE CLINIC AND SYSTEM TOBACCO CESSATION RESOURCES IS UNDERWAY. 7. INCREASE REFERRALS TO COMMUNITY ORAL HEALTH RESOURCES FOR PATIENTS PRESENTING TO THE ED FOR DENTAL ISSUES -COMMUNITY PARTNERSHIPS WITH LOCAL RESOURCES HAVE BEEN STRENGTHENED AND REFINED TO ENSURE STAFF FEEL EMPOWERED TO REFER PATIENTS TO FACILITIES LIKE THE JORDAN VALLEY COMMUNITY HEALTH CENTER (JVCHC) FOR THE APPROPRIATE LEVEL OF CARE FOR ORAL HEALTH ISSUES. -WHEN EVALUATING THE CHIEF COMPLAINTS OF PATIENTS THAT PRESENTED TO THE EMERGENCY DEPARTMENT (ED) FIVE OR MORE TIMES IN A 12-MONTH PERIOD FOR NON-EMERGENT CARE, DENTAL COMPLAINTS RANKED AMONG THE HIGHEST. -PROTOCOLS WERE DEVELOPED FOR PATIENTS THAT PRESENT WITH TOOTH PAIN IN THE ED. AFTER THE MEDICAL SCREENING EXAM COMPLETION, THE PATIENT IS TRANSITIONED TO JVCHC FOR IMMEDIATE DENTAL CARE. -COXHEALTH WORKED IN COLLABORATION WITH JVCHC TO APPLY FOR A GRANT THAT ALLOWED FOR THE HIRE OF ADDITIONAL DENTISTS. TO ENSURE SAME-DAY OR NEXT DAY APPOINTMENTS, THE DENTAL CLINIC EXPANDED TO ADD SATURDAY HOURS. -QUICK ACCESS TO THE DENTAL CLINIC ALLOWED COXHEALTH ED PHYSICIANS TO DISCONTINUE PRESCRIBING NARCOTICS TO PATIENTS WHO PRESENTED WITH TOOTH PAIN. IN 2017, 2,098 INDIVIDUALS WHO PRESENTED TO THE SPRINGFIELD ED WITH NON-EMERGENT DENTAL PAIN WERE REFERRED TO JORDAN VALLEY FOR TREATMENT. OF THOSE INDIVIDUALS, 1,061 (50.5%) RECEIVED TREATMENT. -FOLLOWING A JOINT EFFORT BETWEEN PROGRAM ADMINISTRATORS AT COXHEALTH AND JORDAN VALLEY TO IMPROVE COMMUNICATION AND DATA REPORTING, THE MONTHLY REFERRAL COMPLETION RATE TO DATE HAS INCREASED EXPONENTIALLY TO 91.0%. -IN 2017, OF THE 612 INDIVIDUALS WHO PRESENTED TO COX BRANSON ED WITH DENTAL PAIN, 426 WERE REFERRED TO APPROPRIATE DENTAL CARE. OF THOSE REFERRAL PATIENTS WHO COULD BE REACHED FOR FOLLOW-UP, 31.5% HAD FULFILLED THEIR REFERRAL APPOINTMENT. THE LOW COMPLETION RATE CAN BE COR"

The survey, coordinated with the Maine CDC, engaged public health expertise throughout the process. The survey was administered using a snowball approach where stakeholder agencies agreed to send the surveys to their members and stakeholders for participation. 1,639 people, representing more than 80 organizations and businesses in Maine, completed the survey. Respondents represented health care agencies, public health agencies, law enforcement, municipalities, schools, local businesses, social service agencies, and nongovernmental organizations. In addition to the stakeholder survey, each county conducted a number of community engagement opportunities (forums) to ensure broad interests of the local community were represented; Obtain stakeholder input on identifying significant health needs based on review of shared CHNA data; Solicit stakeholder feedback on prioritizing significant health needs, and; Identify local assets and resources that potentially may address local health priorities. The local forums were conducted in collaboration with the Maine CDC to solicit input from individuals representing populations with health disparities. The following organizations were in attendance at the January 11, 2016 Cumberland County Shared CHNA Community Engagement Forum and provided valuable feedback on the Shared CHNA.Details about organizations: Sample of organizations United Way, ME Health Access Foundation, Southern ME Area Agency on Aging, Preble St. Resource Center, legislator, Somali community members, USM/UNE/SMCC/Tufts medical School, ME Health Mgt Coalition, MaineMedical Center (hospital facility), Spring Harbor Hospital, Mercy Hospital, Bridgton Hospital, HMP, & Portland Public Health.

Chronic Disease Implementation Activities: Goal: Asthma - By March 2019, the Chronic Disease Task Force will show a decrease in the number of asthma attacks that require emergency room services or treatment. Congestive Heart Failure - By March 2018, the Chronic Disease Task Force will work to decrease the number of readmissions among unaffiliated CHF patients (those without a primary care physician) within 30-90 days of discharge by establishing primary care providers/medical homes for 50% of patients. Diabetes - By March 2018, the Chronic Disease Task Force will increase the number of patients completing diabetes education courses by adding ADA-certified sites in Clark County. Oral health - The Chronic Disease Task Force will campaign for fluoride to be added to the Clark County water supply to decrease the prevalence of tooth decay and tooth extractions. 2018 Strategies and Outcomes: Springfield Regional Medical Center (SRMC) participates in the Chronic Disease Task Force. The following actions were taken by the hospital or the Task Force: * Asthma- Visited 81% of PCP offices to provide information and to solicit referrals. This solicitation resulted in an average of 1.56 follow-up visits per office. Applied for the Community Health Foundation Grant. * Asthma- Maintained 7 school contacts and scheduled 7 training/education/information meetings per school. * Congestive Heart Failure (CHF) - Collected data on the number of patients discharged with CHF without a primary care physician (PCP). In 2018, appointments were made after discharge for 70 Congestive Heart Failure (CHF) patients via a previously established program with Rocking House Center to identify and follow unaffiliated patients who were accepted by a PCP/medical home and track the following metrics: weight, medication compliance, symptoms and readmissions at 30, 60 and 90 days. * Diabetes - Maintained ADA certification at The Rocking Horse Center in Clark County. -Continue to track the number of referrals by PCP/medical homes to education programs and track the number of participants completing the programs. In 2018, there was an increase in the number of new patients by 40 from 2017 for the education programs. * Diabetes - The hospital measured attainment of patient-defined goals and patient outcomes using appropriate measurement techniques to evaluate the effectiveness of the educational intervention. In 2018, 30 unduplicated patients were seen with 52 educational visits completed. * Oral Health- The hospital was involved in efforts to educate the community on the benefits of Fluoridation in the city water with a goal to pass the Fluoridation Issue on the November 2018 ballet. In 2018, the Health Commissioner met with local businesses to survey if passing the Fluoridation Issue would have a negative outcome. Following the failure of the levy, the committee reviewed stats and discussed other ways to educate the community on the issue. Mental Health Implementation Activities: Goal: By March 2019, the Mental Health Task Force will redirect emergency medical service (EMS) frequent users to appropriate care and reduce all EMS overuse as evidenced by the development of pre-hospital treatment protocols and related collaborative multiprovider agreements supporting the implementation of Mobile Integrated Health Care or similar system management concepts. 2018 Strategies and Outcomes: SRMC participates in the Mental Health Task Force. While the original goal of the Mental Health Task Force was terminated in 2018 based on the collaborative's inability to garner community and financial support, SRMC has employed Behavioral Health Nurses in the Emergency Department. When a patient with mental health related conditions is received, the BH Nurse does a crisis assessment to determine if the patient is safe to return to home and receive outpatient therapy or if the patient needs to be placed in an inpatient facility. If placement in inpatient facility is required, the Mercy Health Access Center arranges for placement and transportation. The collaborative will continue to investigate best practices in other similar communities to find a workable solution to the issues faced. Health Births and Sexuality Implementation Activities: Goal: To promote, implement and support the practice of Kangaroo Care for all mothers and their newborn infants at SRMC; To work collaboratively with community agencies for early recognition of pregnant women using drugs and to promote healthier pregnancies. 2018 Strategies and Outcomes: * Promoted, implemented and supported the practice of Kangaroo Care for all mothers and their newborn infants at the hospital. The hospital's goal is to improve the breastfeeding initiation rate by 1% annually over a three-year period from January 2016 to December 2019. The previously established Kangaroo Care program continued within SRMC birthing center and the breastfeeding initiation rates, according to the Clark County Combined Health district's data, have increased by 4.4% from the previous year. * Continue the ""Quiet Hours"" program to promote uninterrupted time for mother and baby. * Universal drug screenings were established in 2017 and continued in 2018 for all pregnant patients admitted to the birthing center on their first visit. If the drug screening is positive, the patient is screened on every encounter that follows. In 2018, the case manager referred an average of 5 patients per week with a positive drug screen. Nutrition Implementation Activities: Goal: To promote healthy food and education into a regular lifestyle for adults with BMI 25 - 30 (overweight) and BMI 30 and above (obese). 2018 Strategies and Outcomes: * In prior years, the hospital developed and placed in practice a nutrition education plan at the SRMG Health Resource Center for patients referred by physician practices. The Health Resources Center has evolved into a Walk-In Clinic to respond to the needs of our population that does not have a primary care physician. The need for nutrition education continues and will be addressed by the newly formed Clark County Local Foods Council. * Collaborated with Clark County and established the Clark County Local Foods Council. Elected members to the board of the food council and established bylaws for the board to follow. The Council also established long term plan, goals, and measurements for 2019 - 2020.

Clients are assessed at Mercy REACH for referrals to SRMC for detox services. A REACH therapist makes rounds on clients daily while in SRMC to encourage treatment with REACH program. The hospital continues to establish an inpatient detox program at SRMC, and to focus on successfully operationalizing the program. During 2018, 134 clients were referred to this program with 116 accepting a bed for detox treatment. Of the 116 clients who accepted treatment, 95 completed the detox treatment program. * Mercy REACH continued to operate an Intensive Outpatient Program (IOP) for patients discharged from the inpatient detox program to establish sobriety skills. In 2018, 508 people from both Urbana and Springfield participated in the Mercy REACH treatment, with 49 clients participating in an Intensive Outpatient Program (IOP). Participants attending IOP attend three days a week, for 9 hours. The length of stay varies on the clients' degree of addiction, struggling with sobriety, and setbacks during the course of treatment. * Mercy REACH continues the MAT VIVITROL program to provide injections to help prevent relapse to opioid dependence. Clients may receive the MAT Vivitrol treatment for several months ranging from one month up to 5-8 months depending on the need of the client. In 2018, 31 clients participated in the MAT program.

By March 2018, the Healthy Living Task Force will increase the number of patients completing diabetes self-management education courses, as documented by increased physician referrals and expansion of programs to include evening hours. 2018 Strategies and Outcomes: * Mercy Health - Urbana Hospital (Urbana Hospital) is working to develop a plan for nutrition education at the Urbana Hospital Chronic Disease Clinic. The Chronic Disease Clinic was working to develop and schedule monthly classes for the nutrition education program. In 2018, the hospital took the following actions: 1) Continued to provide a nutrition-education plan using the American Diabetes Association (ADA) Diabetes Management (DM) Program for patients referred by physician practices at the Urbana Hospital Chronic Disease Clinic. The program was offered through the Department of Health and the local YMCA in 2018 and 8 classes were scheduled. 2) Collaborated with Springfield Regional Medical Group (SRMG) physician practices to develop a referral process to the Urbana Hospital Dietitian. 3) Established a process with central scheduling to route referrals to Urbana Hospital education programs. In 2018, 4 referred patients were scheduled, and 2 were seen. 4) Provided all SRMG physicians with appropriate educational materials to share with patients during appointments and to promote referrals to the classes. * The hospital has partnered with the schools to develop and promote healthy-eating education programs to be presented once a year for the middle and high schools in Champaign County. Hospital representatives worked with students and are in process of developing video presentations that will be presented to elementary school students on healthy eating and exercise. In 2018, education programs were presented to 295 students at Graham High School during their healthy kids' day. The Hospital continues efforts to work with the Graham and Urbana City schools with coordination from the YMCA and CCHD to track cafeteria menu changes, but further meetings are required for success. * Urbana Hospital is developing a plan for diabetic education at the Urbana Hospital Chronic Disease Clinic. In 2018, the hospital took the following actions: 1) Provided Diabetic Educational Classes at various times based off patients' needs. The Hospital continues to update class times to meet the various transportation schedules and work schedules for the clients. In 2018, the Hospital worked around client schedules to provide one-on-one education for those clients. 2) Tracked one patient outcome via EPIC after goals were set to measure the effectiveness for diabetic education. The tracked patient completed 5 of the goals to 100% and completed 1 goal to 75%. Mental Health Implementation Activities: Goal: To investigate precision medicine as a tool for physicians to individualize therapeutic drug choice by using genotype to predict positive clinical outcomes, adverse reactions and levels of drug metabolism for effective support of patients' depression disorders. 2018 Strategies and Outcomes: * In 2018, the provider responsible for the use of Pharmacogenics (Precision Medicine) Technology was moved to full time in the senior behavioral unit at Urbana Hospital. At this time, the hospital has implemented a program for patients discharged from the SBU to be seen, by the above-mentioned provider, with a follow up appointment to ensure they have their prescriptions and future appointments scheduled. There is also a counselor in house, working with this provider, that will follow-up with these patients to establish them in counseling sessions. Substance Abuse Implementation Activities: Goal: Patients discharged from Urbana Hospital with an overdose-related diagnoses be referred to Urbana Hospital Chronic Clinic and/or Community Mercy REACH program for substance abuse prevention treatment and support 2018 Strategies and Outcomes: * Urbana Hospital continues to focus on identifying and admitting patients to the inpatient detox treatment program at Springfield Regional Medical Center (SRMC) through Mercy REACH. The primary detox assessment is conducted at the Springfield REACH office. Upon completion of an assessment, a therapist contacts SRMC to refer client for first available bed and SRMC will call client for admission. The hospital's goal is to provide detox services to as many patients as needed. During 2018, 134 clients were referred to the Mercy REACH program at SRMC with 116 accepting a bed for detox treatment. Of the 116 clients who accepted treatment, 95 completed the detox treatment program. * Mercy REACH opened an Intensive Outpatient Program (IOP) at SRMC for patients discharged from the inpatient detox program to establish sobriety skills.

Multiple conversations and meetings were convened internally and with external partners and a thorough review of the data was conducted. Multiple data sources were used to support the identification and selection of the priority items which were identified, selected and reviewed with the partners. The collection of primary data from a sample of the Westchester County residents was an important element of the development of the Community Health Needs Assessment. Montefiore engaged with the Westchester County Department of Health's online Community Resident and Provider Health Surveys to facilitate the implementation of the primary data collection process for the Community Health Needs Assessment for Westchester County and to assist in the facilitation of these community level connections thereby alleviating additional surveying overload. An online survey was collaboratively developed and made available across Westchester County over the summer of 2016. During this process, Westchester County compiled feedback from over 1,300 responders and identified community concerns by municipality to support CHNA efforts of hospitals for inclusion into their implementation plans. In addition to collaborative input from the local Department of Health, Montefiore worked closely with it communities, organized partnerships and collaboratives and other providers in lower Westchester as well as extensive work with representatives of the affected communities to help Montefiore to identify health care needs and determine the appropriate configuration of services."

The two priority areas identified were (1)Preventing Chronic Disease and (2)Promoting Healthy Women, Infants and Children. As part of the submission for the New York State Health Improvement Plan for 2016-2018, required by the New York State Department of Health, Montefiore has elected to retain these two priority areas, Prevent Chronic Disease and Promote Healthy Women, Infants and Children and has selected three broad focus areas to implement programs. These broad focus areas are (1)reducing obesity in children and adults, (2)Increase access to high quality chronic disease Preventive care and management in both clinical and community settings and (3) Improving maternal and infant Health. Across these focus areas, various goals, with specific interventions, performance measures and time frames, were delineated; - Create community environments that promote and support healthy food and beverage choices and physical activity; - Increase screening rates for cardiovascular disease, diabetes and breast, cervical and colorectal cancers, especially among disparate populations; - Reduce premature births. Despite each of the different methods and approached to primary data collection in gathering community input, there was a consistent focus on obesity and related behaviors and outcomes among the main community health concerns. Obesity and its related behaviors have significant impact on chronic disease, therefore, it is intended that the programs that are detailed specifically for the reduction of obesity will also impact the prevalence of diabetes, hypertension, asthma, cancer and cardiovascular disease in Westchester County. Montefiore has a vast portfolio of programs and services that address a majority of the significant community health needs identified in the Community Health Needs Assessment. The breadth and depth of the programs and services vary, but each address a need identified in the community. In particular, there are programs underway in collaboration with Hudson River Healthcare and Westchester Local Government units to work with bodegas on healthy snack displays and creating walking paths in parks and communities. In addition to the multiple resources that have been developed at Montefiore independently and through partnership with other organizations, there is an extensive need for community-based programs and resources that can augment Montefiore's program and services. Knowing how to access those resources is a particular challenge for the health care sector. However, since the last CHNA report in 2013, multiple free and low cost online search tools have been developed, such as www.auntbertha.com, www.hitesite.org, www.nowpow.com, among others. These are a much more comprehensive and practical alternative to the home-grown referral guides that many health care providers have had to use in the past. Those were hard to keep-up-to date and difficult to search, a problem that is largely addressed by the online version. Many Montefiore sites have been introduced to these new online resources and work is underway to more seamlessly integrate this kind of solution into the various workflows across the ambulatory, ED and inpatient settings."

ELLIS IS A SUBCONTRACTOR UNDER THE GRANT.THE PICH GRANT ALSO SUPPORTED TRAINING OF ELLIS DIABETES CARE STAFF AS LIFESTYLE COACHES FOR THE NATIONAL DIABETES PREVENTION PROGRAM (DPP), WHICH IS OFFERED AT ELLIS MEDICINE LOCATIONS STARTING IN OCTOBER 2016.AN EMBEDDED DIABETES CARE MANAGER WAS PLACED AT ELLIS FAMILY HEALTH CENTER AS PART OF THE PICH GRANT TO WORK ON POLICIES AND SYSTEMS RELATED TO DIABETES MANAGEMENT IN A PRIMARY CARE SETTING, INCLUDING REFERRALS TO THE DIABETES SELF-MANAGEMENT EDUCATION PROGRAM.WITH ASSISTANCE FROM ELLIS MEDICINE IT STAFF, A REGISTRY OF PATIENTS WITH DIABETES WAS DEVELOPED FOR ELLIS FAMILY HEALTH CENTER TO FACILITATE IMPROVED CARE.ELLIS STAFF AND LOCAL COLLEGE STUDENTS MET WITH NEIGHBORHOOD ASSOCIATIONS TO CONDUCT A COMMUNITY ASSET MAPPING; THIS INVENTORY IS TO BE USED TO ASSESS THE VIABILITY OF A CITY-WIDE PHYSICAL ACTIVITY PROGRAM.ELLIS HELD A PHYSICAL ACTIVITY FIELD DAY FOR LOCAL YOUTH IN PARTNERSHIP WITH UNION COLLEGE.ELLIS ENGAGED ITS OWN EMPLOYEES IN COMPETITIVE WALKING EVENTS AND OTHER WEIGHT-LOSS ACTIVITY; PARTICIPATION COUNTS TOWARD REDUCTIONS IN HEALTH INSURANCE PREMIUMS.THE HEALTHY FOOD ACCESS WORKGROUP, RENAMED THE DIABETES/OBESITY WORKGROUP, MET THREE TIMES DURING 2017. AVERAGE ATTENDANCE FOR THE MEETINGS WAS 13 PEOPLE. THIS GROUP'S MAIN FOCUS DURING THE YEAR WAS TO STEER THE FOOD ACCESS FOCUSED WORK OF THE ""PARTNERSHIPS TO IMPROVE COMMUNITY HEALTH"" (PICH) GRANT WHICH HAD BEEN AWARDED TO SCHENECTADY COUNTY PUBLIC HEALTH SERVICES. THIS GROUP WORKED WITH SIX FOOD PANTRIES IN SCHENECTADY COUNTY TO INCREASE THE AVAILABILITY OF HEALTHY OPTIONS DISTRIBUTED TO CLIENTS. THIS INCLUDES INCREASING OPTIONS FOR FRUITS AND VEGETABLES AS WELL AS WHOLE GRAINS AND LOW-FAT DAIRY. IMPLEMENTATION EFFORTS AT FOOD PANTRIES INCLUDE ""POLICY, SYSTEMS AND ENVIRONMENTAL"" (PSE) IMPROVEMENTS. EXAMPLES OF THESE PSE STRATEGIES INCLUDE SIGNAGE TO PROMOTE THE FOOD GROUPS WITH A NUTRITION MESSAGE, MOVING ITEMS ON SHELVES TO HIGHLIGHT FRUITS AND VEGETABLES AT EYE LEVEL, AND IMPROVING THE DISPLAYS FOR FRESH PRODUCE TO MAKE THE FOOD PANTRIES LOOK MORE LIKE A MARKET. RECIPES AND COOKING DEMONSTRATIONS WERE ALSO DONE AT FOOD PANTRIES TO INCREASE THE LIKELIHOOD OF CLIENTS CHOOSING THE HEALTHIER OPTIONS. EACH PANTRY THAT IS ENGAGED IN THIS WORK IN SCHENECTADY COUNTY IS DOING A DIFFERENT COMBINATION OF INTERVENTIONS TO INCREASE THE AVAILABILITY OF HEALTHY OPTIONS BECAUSE EACH PANTRY USES A SLIGHTLY DIFFERENT MODEL TO DELIVER FOODS TO CLIENTS. SOME PANTRIES ARE A CHOICE MODEL, WHERE CLIENTS GET TO CHOOSE ALL THE FOODS THEY TAKE WITH THEM WHILE SOME PROVIDE PRE-PACKED FOOD BOXES AND SOME ARE A MIX OF BOTH MODELS. THE DIFFERENT PANTRY MODELS LEND THEMSELVES TO DIFFERENT INTERVENTIONS WORKING BETTER THAN OTHERS. THE DIABETES/OBESITY WORKGROUP ASSISTED PANTRIES IN DECIDING WHAT INTERVENTIONS WOULD WORK BEST FOR THEIR MODEL.IN OCTOBER 2016, ELLIS HOSPITAL'S DIABETES CARE PROGRAM STARTED THE FIRST DIABETES PREVENTION PROGRAM (DPP) IN THE COMMUNITY IN A NUMBER OF YEARS. THE DPP IS A LIFESTYLE CHANGE PROGRAM TO PREVENT DIABETES. IT RUNS 16 CONSECUTIVE WEEKS AND THEN MONTHLY FOLLOW UP SESSIONS FOR THE REMAINDER OF A YEAR. FROM OCTOBER 2016 ON, THERE HAVE BEEN THREE CLASSES STARTED WITH AN AVERAGE OF 14 PEOPLE ATTENDING EACH CLASS. AS OF OCTOBER 2017, ONE CLASS WAS COMPLETED, ONE WAS IN THE MAINTENANCE PHASE AND ONE WAS IN THE INITIAL 16 WEEKS. SCHENECTADY'S DPP IS WORKING TOWARD BECOMING A CDC-RECOGNIZED PROGRAM SO THEY WILL BE REIMBURSED FOR THEIR SERVICES WHEN MEDICARE BEGINS TO COVER THEM IN 2018.IN ADDITION TO THE DPP, ELLIS DIABETES CARE ALSO OFFERS DIABETES SELF-MANAGEMENT EDUCATION (DSME) PROGRAMS FOR INDIVIDUALS ALREADY DIAGNOSED WITH DIABETES. THEY RECEIVE REFERRALS FROM ELLIS PRACTICES ALONG WITH COMMUNITY BASED ORGANIZATIONS AND OTHER MEDICAL PROVIDERS IN THE COMMUNITY. ONE OF THE GOALS WAS TO INCREASE REFERRALS TO DSME AND TO INCREASE THE NUMBER OF INDIVIDUALS WHO FOLLOW THROUGH ON THEIR REFERRAL AND ATTEND AT LEAST ONE SESSION OF DSME. FROM OCTOBER 2016 - SEPTEMBER 2017, DSME RECEIVED 647 REFERRALS FROM ALL SOURCES. OF THOSE, 168 (26%) PATIENTS ATTENDED AT LEAST ONE DSME SESSION. (THE DATA IS ONLY AVAILABLE UP UNTIL SEPTEMBER 2017 BECAUSE OF LACK OF STAFFING AVAILABLE TO ENTER DATA SO SOME 2016 DATA IS INCLUDED TO MAKE A FULL 12 MONTHS OF DATA.) SCPHS PROVIDED FUNDING THROUGH THE PICH GRANT TO TRAIN ELLIS MEDICINE STAFF AS ""LIFESTYLE COACHES"" TO DELIVER THE DPP. SCPHS ALSO SUPPORTED THE PROMOTION OF THE CLASSES THROUGH ADVERTISEMENTS IN THE LOCAL NEWSPAPER AND SHARING FLYERS WITH LOCAL PARTNERS. THE PICH GRANT WAS ABLE TO PURCHASE INCENTIVES FOR THE PROGRAM TO HELP PEOPLE TO CONTINUE COMING TO THE PROGRAM. ELLIS MEDICINE PROVIDES STAFF FOR RUNNING BOTH THE DPP AND DSME PROGRAMS, BOTH OF WHICH ARE HOUSED IN ELLIS DIABETES CARE. THEY ALSO PROVIDE RESOURCES TO PROMOTE THESE PROGRAMS IN THE COMMUNITY AND TO THEIR EMPLOYEES. ELLIS DIABETES CARE COLLECTS ALL THE DATA THAT IS NEEDED FOR THESE PROGRAMS AND MONITORS PROGRESS WITH REFERRALS. SUNNYVIEW HOSPITAL ALSO PROVIDES REFERRALS TO THE DPP AND DSME PROGRAMS.SEE CONTINUATION ON SCHEDULE O"

Information for this assessment was collected in a different manner this year, as the CHNA and Community Health Improvement Plan (CHIP) was a combined effort with the Local Health Department of Tompkins County. The CHNA/CHIP team was comprised of representatives from Tompkins County, Cayuga Medical Center and several community-based non-profit organizations. Much of the information driving the selection/confirmation of our priorities was gathered through conversations with service providers, and through panels and presentations by peers and providers. Key data indicators were reviewed to guide selection decisions for our priority focus areas. For example, data on hospitalizations related to mental health and substance abuse showed steep increases over the last 2-10 years, indicating that mental health and substance abuse continues to be a priority for Tompkins County. Finally, review of chronic disease indicators revealed that Tompkins County is in the second quartile statewide, indicating the need to continue our efforts to focus on underserved populations, particularly in the rural parts of the county."

201813189349303776,262037695,"Schedule H, Part V, Section B, Line 11-GRADY MEMORIAL HOSPITAL","SINCE GRADY'S MOST RECENT CHNA WAS CONDUCTED IN 2016 AND OUR IMPLEMENTATION STRATEGY (IS) WAS ADOPTED AT THE END OF 2016. Listed below are a sample of activities related to the priorities identified in the 2016 CHNA: 1. Improve coordination of care for Grady patients with diabetes, hypertension, prostate cancer, HIV/AIDS and behavioral health conditions. To improve care coordination for high risk patients and reduce unnecessary emergency department utilization, Grady launched the Chronic Care Clinic in 2017. The goal of the program is to engage patients in their care to identify and remove barriers and foster self-management. The multi-disciplinary care team establishes patient-specific care goals, and patients received monthly clinic visits with home visits and telephone follow-ups in between. Patients enrolled in the program have reduced emergency department use and inpatient admissions. Grady partnered with the Atlanta Regional Commission (ARC) and MARTA to address a significant barrier to accessing health care: transportation. Through the Rides to Wellness pilot program, funded by the Federal Transportation Administration, about 200 Grady patients who were missing appointments received six months of free rides on public transportation. Eligible patients also received travel training and assistance with enrolling in MARTA's Paratransit or Reduced Fare programs. As the pilot phase of the program concludes, Grady and the partners are exploring ways of sustaining this critical resource. The Georgia Cancer Center for Excellence at Grady was selected by the Merck Foundation as one of six sites across the nation to participate in the Alliance to Advance Patient-Centered Cancer Care. Through this initiative, Grady has expanded nurse navigation to improve timely access to and coordination of care, began a rigorous patient-centered designation process with Planetree to enhance patient-provider communication and patient engagement, and expanded partnerships with community organizations to strengthen psychosocial and supportive care for patients. Grady has remained committed to community collaboration through the Atlanta Regional Collaborative for Health Improvement (ARCHI). Grady has representation on the Steering Committee and has continued to participate in the diabetes hospital collaborative launched in 2016. Through this effort, Grady is working with Kaiser Permanente, Wellstar and Piedmont Healthcare to implement digital diabetes self-management education (DSME) and coaching. 2. Increase opportunities for all Georgians, with a focus on persons served by Grady Health System, to access healthcare coverage.Grady has engaged a number of resources to assist patients in gaining access to Medicaid and Marketplace health insurance. In 2017, Grady assisted 63 patients with Marketplace insurance enrollment, and submitted about 7,500 Medicaid applications for patients. Through our Food as Medicine Partnership, the Atlanta Community Food Bank and Wholesome Wave Georgia submitted 63 Medicaid applications and 502 SNAP applications on behalf of our patients. 3. Increase patient and community engagement in healthy behaviors to prevent diabetes, hypertension, HIV, unintentional injuries, and homicide. Through a CDC Foundation grant funded by the Robert Wood Johnson Foundation, Grady Memorial Hospital and DeKalb County Police Department are partnering to prevent violence and make communities safer. The Partnership uses the Cardiff Model established in Europe to collect anonymous information on the location and timing of violent events reported at the hospital. Along with existing law enforcement records, they create local maps of where violence occurs, and identify hot spots throughout the county. This information and predictive analysis has been used to develop public health strategies and environmental approaches to address violence in South DeKalb. In 2017, the Injury Prevention Research Center at Emory University, along with Grady Memorial Hospital and collaborators at the University of Michigan, were awarded a five-year, $4 million grant to study metro-Atlanta motor vehicle crashes that result in injuries treated at Grady. The goal of this project, funded by the National Highway Traffic Safety Administration (NHTSA), is to improve vehicle safety and support injury prevention. The Emory/Grady center is one of seven designated Crash Injury Research and Engineering Network (CIREN) centers in the U.S. After successfully launching a Fruit and Vegetable Prescription (FVRx) Program in partnership with Wholesome Wave Georgia in 2016, Grady expanded its commitment to addressing food insecurity. In 2017, the Food as Medicine Partnership was established to bring innovative food and nutrition solutions to Grady patients, staff and community. Grady worked with WWG, Open Hand, and the Atlanta Community Food Bank to create a comprehensive plan, which was approved by Grady's leadership. The plan includes expanding the FVRx program, establishing an onsite food pharmacy, opening a healthy caf and farmers market, and strategies to better connect patients with existing resources like SNAP and local food pantries. Several components began in 2017 and the full plan will be implemented throughout 2018 and 2019. Grady continues to partner with the Atlanta Beltline to increase access to safe parks, trails and health education. In 2017, Grady received a Health Grant to support a wellness program for community members. Grady's comprehensive program, Walk the Line, launched in September in collaboration with the opening of the BeltLine's Westside Trail. Walk the Line is a 10 week, healthy lifestyle class targeting African American adults. The lower priorities of Grady's 2016 CHNA-low birth weight, obesity, breast cancer, poverty, and high school education non-attainment-were not included as areas of focus for several reasons. First, Grady already offers a robust women's program to address low birth weight as well as continuously working to improve our services for breast cancer. For the other priorities, Grady does not have the resources or expertise to significantly address these community health needs but these are being supplemented by other ARCHI partners with the appropriate resources and expertise to significantly address those needs."

201813189349304906,210634462,"Part V, Section B","The Community Health Needs Assessment (CHNA) was conducted from February to October of 2016 with the purpose of gathering information about local health needs and health behaviors. The assessment used both primary and secondary research to illustrate and compare health trends and disparities across the region. Primary research solicited input from key community stakeholders representing the broad interests of the community, including experts in public health and individuals representing medically underserved, low-income, and minority populations. Secondary research identified demographic and health trends across geographic areas and populations. The Cooper Board of Trustees met on December 21, 2016 to review the findings of the CHNA and the recommended implementation strategy. The board voted to adopt the final summary report and the implementation strategy and provide the necessary resources and support to carry out the initiatives therein. Question 5: The Burlington, Camden, Gloucester, and Ocean County Health Departments participated in the design and completion of Cooper's Community Health Needs Assessment, including meetings to identify and prioritize health needs. Specific research methods: - A review of secondary health and socioeconomic indicators for the service area. - An analysis and comparison of hospital utilization data. - Partner forums with community representatives and leaders to identify community health priorities and facilitate population health strategy collaboration. - Focus groups with health consumers. Question 6: The Health Assessment Collaborative included the following partners: Cooper University Hospital, Deborah Heart and Lung Center, Kennedy Health System, Lourdes Health System, Virtua Health, and the Health Departments of Burlington, Camden, Gloucester, and Ocean Counties. Question 7A & 10A: WWW.COOPERHEALTH.ORG/about-us/community-health-needs-assessment - The implementation strategy is on pages 17 & 18. Question 11: A voting system based on the criteria of scope, severity, and ability to impact was used to help participants in the assessment prioritize local health needs. The prioritized list of health needs is as follows: 1. behavioral health and chronic disease comorbidities 2. linkages to care - access 3. substance abuse Cooper is addressing the significant needs identified in the recently conducted CHNA as follows: Behavioral health/chronic disease comorbidities: -creation of an advanced care center with implementation of an innovative multidisciplinary group visit model -Patients with similar diagnoses meet together and learn best practices of care together -community education programs and support groups linkages to care - access: -partnered with a third party vendor to assist patients in completing applications for financial assistance, medicaid, etc. -trained staff as certified application counselors to assist patients in obtaining insurance -launched urgent care services in three locations -implemented dedicated schedule slots with primary care physicians to ensure available follow-up appointments for patients within two weeks after hospital discharge Substance abuse: -implemented standardized, systematic mental health screening for all patients admitted to Cooper -launched an initiative to address the gaps in behavioral health resources and identify partnership opportunities in service provision -hosted and supported many community events in collaboration with the county's addiction awareness task force Rationale for community health needs not specifically addressed: Cooper recognizes that partnerships with community agencies have the broadest reach to improve community health issues. While additional disease specific and population specific needs were identified, the group found that other resources, such as the Southern New Jersey Perinatal Cooperative and disease specific resources were available and the health systems would be more effective in utilizing the available resources in addressing the prioritized needs.

The CHNA process began with a thorough review of the previous cycles needs assessment report. Although there were very pertinent and important findings in the report, it was agreed that this CHNA process would try to surpass the input from the previous needs assessment and focus on reaching a substantial number of individuals for input outside of the Morgantown area and outside the WVU Hopsitals organization. The 2016 CHNA took input from persons who represented a broad interest of the community served including but not limited to the Monongalia County Health Department Director, Chair of the WVUH Pediatric Department/Director of the Rural Health Institute, a transportation official, an elected county official, county school representatives, WVUH representatives, Executive Director of Milan Puskar Health Right Free-Clinic, Morgantown Chamber of Commerce members, as well as others from various community organizations.

WVUH is worked towards additional ways to address the identified needs listed in the CHNA while partnering with area organizations to help address needs identified by the CNHA but not directly being addressed by WVUH such as STDs and STIs. The issue of STDs and STIs is being addressed through the WVUH Infectious Disease Department collabortaing with the Center for Disease Control. This program is funded by grants and is not an expense to WVUH. WVUH felt that this was the most effective way to deal with certain needs as to not duplicate services or cause confusion related to where the community can seek help for such needs. An update on WVUHs progress on the needs identified is being prepared and will be released in 2019.

A. Access to Mental Health Care and Poor Mental Health Status The 2017 MSBI CHNA found that the mental health status is poor for many residents because of day-to-day pressures, substance abuse, and psychiatric disorders. The supply of mental health providers is insufficient to meet the demand for mental health services. Planned activities to increase access to mental health care and improve the mental health status of community residents are described below. These activities are in addition to the MSBI activities that impact multiple needs. Health professions education The health professions education activities of MSBI respond to both the current and future community health needs for mental health services. MSBI actively participates in over two dozen residency and fellowship programs. Current residency and fellowship programs that are especially related to mental health care services are as follows: - Clinical Psychology Internship Program - Geriatric Psychiatry Fellowship - Psychiatry Residency Mental Health Services Mental health care services are available at the hospital campuses, outpatient facilities, and physician practices throughout the community. As part of the Mount Sinai Health System, integrated resources such as electronic health records facilitate the referral of patients to needed services provided by other Mount Sinai Health System hospitals and health professionals. Specific mental health services available include the following: Mount Sinai's Department of Psychiatry and Behavioral Sciences. The Department of Psychiatry and Behavioral Sciences at Mount Sinai Beth Israel provides comprehensive inpatient, emergency, and outpatient services. Specific programs, centers, and services of the Department include the following: - Outpatient mental health clinic services - Assertive Community Treatment Team (ACT) - Mobile Crisis Services - Addiction Institute of Mount Sinai at Beth Israel (AIMS-BI): - Outpatient Chemical Dependence Clinic/Rehab - Ambulatory Detoxification - Opioid Treatment Programs - Inpatient detoxification and rehabilitation services - Integrated Behavioral Health and Primary Care services - Comprehensive Psychiatric Emergency Service (CPEP) - Inpatient Psychiatric services Outpatient behavioral health services The MSBI outpatient mental health services unit provides comprehensive, whole health care. It includes a broad spectrum of clinical services including comprehensive psychiatric evaluations, medication management, individual and family psychotherapy, and group psychotherapy. It also runs one of the state-approved ACT teams, providing intensive community-based treatment for people with the most severe mental illnesses.

As part of the prioritization process, Roper St. Francis Healthcare conducted an inventory of existing system-based outreach programs, community partnerships, and other collaborative resources that currently address each of the priority areas:After examining the range of services currently available, the expertise, outreach, and capacity of the RSFH System, and the resources available to best address needs through other community organizations, Roper St. Francis Healthcare senior leadership chose the following 5 issues as priorities to implement for its current CHNA: Access to Care; Clinical Preventive Services; Mental Health; Obesity/Nutrition/Physical Activity; Social Determinants; and Maternal, Infant, and Child Health.For the Healthy People 2020 topics that were not identified through the CHNA as strategic priority areas of need (Injury and Violence; Substance Abuse; Environmental Quality; Oral Health; Sexual Health; Tobacco Use), Roper St. Francis Healthcare is committed to providing support and collaboratively working with local partners, new and existing, to ensure these needs are acknowledged.The Roper St. Francis Community Needs Assessment Team developed implementation strategies for each health issue identified as a strategic priority. This implementation plan will be rolled out over the next 3 years. Strategies are to be clearly defined with a matrix of which areas each RSFH hospital will address. Some strategies may be addressed by more than one RSFH hospital or the system as a whole. The team will develop a monitoring method at the conclusion of the implementation planning process to provide status updates to community partners, stakeholders, and the community-at-large."

IN 2015, ALL FIVE ADVOCATE HEALTH CARE HOSPITALS PRINCIPALLY SERVING COOK COUNTY, INCLUDING ADVOCATE CHRIST MEDICAL CENTER, WERE FOUNDING MEMBERS OF THE HEALTH IMPACT COLLABORATIVE OF COOK COUNTY (HICCC). HICCC MERGED WITH THE HEALTHY CHICAGO HOSPITAL COLLABORATIVE. THE MERGER ALLOWED PARTNERS TO FURTHER ALIGN THEIR EFFORTS AND ACHIEVE GREATER COLLECTIVE IMPACT IN CHICAGO AND COOK COUNTY. ON JUNE 30, 2017, HOSPITAL PARTNERS FROM BOTH COLLABORATIVES MET TO KICK OFF THE START OF A FULLY MERGED INITIATIVE. THE NAME SELECTED FOR THE MERGER WAS THE ALLIANCE FOR HEALTH EQUITY (AFHE). THE ALLIANCE FOR HEALTH EQUITY IS A PARTNERSHIP BETWEEN THE ILLINOIS PUBLIC HEALTH INSTITUTE (IPHI), HOSPITALS, HEALTH DEPARTMENTS AND COMMUNITY ORGANIZATIONS ACROSS CHICAGO AND COOK COUNTY. THIS INITIATIVE IS ONE OF THE LARGEST COLLABORATIVE HOSPITAL-COMMUNITY PARTNERSHIPS IN THE COUNTRY WITH THE CURRENT INVOLVEMENT OF 30+ NONPROFIT AND PUBLIC HOSPITALS, SEVEN LOCAL HEALTH DEPARTMENTS, AND REPRESENTATIVES OF MORE THAN 100 COMMUNITY ORGANIZATIONS SERVING ON ACTION TEAMS. PARTNERS ARE COMING TOGETHER WITH THE GOAL OF WORKING ON STRATEGIES TO ADDRESS THE PRESSING ISSUES IN OUR COMMUNITIES TO ACHIEVE GREATER COLLECTIVE IMPACT. GIVEN THE SIZE AND DIVERSITY OF COOK COUNTY, THE COLLABORATIVE CREATED THREE REGIONS - NORTH, CENTRAL AND SOUTH - FOR PURPOSES OF ORGANIZING THE ASSESSMENT PROCESS. CHRIST MEDICAL CENTER WAS APPROPRIATELY ASSIGNED TO THE SOUTH REGION CONSISTING OF BOTH THE SOUTH SIDE OF CHICAGO AND THE SOUTH SUBURBS OF COOK COUNTY. A REGIONAL LEADERSHIP TEAM WAS FORMED INCLUDING REPRESENTATIVES FROM THE HOSPITALS AND HEALTH DEPARTMENTS IN THE REGION. A REGIONAL STAKEHOLDER GROUP WAS ALSO ORGANIZED INCLUDING MEMBERS OF COMMUNITY ORGANIZATIONS REPRESENTING VARIOUS SECTORS. FROM FEBRUARY 2015 THROUGH JUNE OF 2016, THE COLLABORATIVE COMPLETED AN EXTENSIVE COMMUNITY HEALTH NEEDS ASSESSMENT PROCESS WITHIN EACH OF THE THREE REGIONS USING THE PUBLIC HEALTH PROCESS-MAPP-MOBILIZING FOR ACTION THROUGH PARTNERSHIPS AND PLANNING. ADDITIONALLY, FOR PURPOSES OF THE 2014-2016 CHNA CYCLE, THE HOSPITAL FORMED A COMMUNITY HEALTH COUNCIL (COUNCIL) CONSISTING OF 25 COMMUNITY AND MEDICAL CENTER LEADERS. THIS COUNCIL, IN PARTNERSHIP WITH THE COMMUNITY HEALTH DEPARTMENT, WAS CONVENED TO OVERSEE THE ASSESSMENT. DATA FROM THE HEALTH IMPACT COLLABORATIVE OF COOK COUNTY WAS PRESENTED TO THE COUNCIL INCLUDING THE PRIORITY-SETTING PROCESS THAT IDENTIFIED SOCIAL DETERMINANTS OF HEALTH, MENTAL HEALTH AND SUBSTANCE ABUSE, ACCESS TO CARE, AND CHRONIC DISEASE AS THE FOUR COUNTY-WIDE PRIORITIES. ALL HOSPITALS THAT PARTICIPATED IN THE COLLABORATIVE AGREED TO ACCEPT SOCIAL DETERMINANTS AS ONE OF THEIR PRIORITIES, WITH CHRIST MEDICAL CENTER IDENTIFYING THAT ONE OF THEIR STRATEGIES WITHIN THIS PRIORITY WOULD BE VIOLENCE PREVENTION. IN ADDITION, MULTIPLE INDICATORS FROM THE HEALTHY COMMUNITIES INSTITUTE (HCI) DATA PLATFORM WERE SHARED WITH THE CHRIST MEDICAL CENTERS COMMUNITY HEALTH COUNCIL. MANY OF THESE INDICATORS WERE PARTICULARLY USEFUL TO THE ASSESSMENT BECAUSE THE HOSPITALIZATION AND EMERGENCY ROOM VISIT RATES WERE AVAILABLE BY ZIP CODE, THUS PERMITTING A DEEPER LOOK INTO THE HEALTH STATUS OF THE MEDICAL CENTERS PRIMARY SERVICE AREA (PSA). A CONSENSUS VOTING PROCESS WAS USED BY THE COUNCIL TO SELECT THE SECOND AND THIRD PRIORITIES FOR THE 2014-2016 CHNA CYCLE-ASTHMA AND DIABETES. CANCER, HEART DISEASE AND HYPERTENSION (STROKE) WERE NOT SELECTED PRIMARILY BECAUSE THE MEDICAL CENTER ALREADY HAS INSTITUTES ADDRESSING EACH OF THESE IMPORTANT HEALTH NEEDS. THE THREE PRIORITIES SELECTED BY CHRIST MEDICAL CENTER ARE VIOLENCE PREVENTION, ASTHMA AND DIABETES. CHRIST MEDICAL CENTER HAS DEVELOPED IMPLEMENTATION PLANS FOR EACH OF THE THREE SELECTED PRIORITIES. COMMUNITY HEALTH STAFF WILL ALSO BE PARTICIPATING IN THE ACTION PLANNING TEAMS ON COMMUNITY SAFETY AND CHRONIC DISEASE PREVENTION CONVENED AS PART OF THE AFHE. FOR VIOLENCE PREVENTION AS A SOCIAL DETERMINANT, THE MEDICAL CENTER PLANS TO CONTINUE ITS WORK WITH CEASEFIRE AND COLLABORATE WITH COMMUNITY ORGANIZATIONS TO INVESTIGATE HOW RESTORATIVE JUSTICE PRACTICES CAN IMPACT THE VIOLENCE ON CHILDREN. FOR THE ASTHMA AND DIABETES PRIORITIES, TEAMS WILL BE DEVELOPING EDUCATIONAL, OUTREACH AND ENVIRONMENTAL STRATEGIES IN COLLABORATION WITH ADVOCATE CHILDRENS HOSPITAL AND COMMUNITY PARTNERS TO IMPROVE THE MANAGEMENT OF THESE DISEASES. IN 2014, ADVOCATE HEALTH CARE BEGAN ORGANIZING RESOURCES TO IMPLEMENT THE 2014-2016 CHNA CYCLE. THE SYSTEM SIGNED A THREE-YEAR CONTRACT WITH THE HEALTHY COMMUNITIES INSTITUTE (HCI), NOW A XEROX COMPANY, TO PROVIDE AN INTERNET-BASED DATA RESOURCE FOR THEIR ELEVEN HOSPITALS DURING THE 2014-2016 CHNA CYCLE. THIS ROBUST PLATFORM OFFERED THE HOSPITALS 171 HEALTH AND DEMOGRAPHIC INDICATORS INCLUDING THIRTY-ONE (31) HOSPITALIZATION AND EMERGENCY DEPARTMENT (ED) VISIT INDICATORS AT THE SERVICE AREA AND ZIP CODE LEVELS. IN ADDITION, SYSTEM LEADERS COLLABORATED WITH THE STRATEGIC PLANNING DEPARTMENT TO CREATE SETS OF DEMOGRAPHIC, MORTALITY AND UTILIZATION DATA FOR EACH HOSPITAL SITE. THIS COLLABORATION WITH STRATEGIC PLANNING CONTINUED DURING THE THREE-YEAR CYCLE ENSURING THAT EACH HOSPITAL SITE HAD DETAILED INPATIENT, OUTPATIENT AND EMERGENCY DEPARTMENT DATA. BY THE END OF 2014, A NEW DEPARTMENT OF COMMUNITY HEALTH WAS ESTABLISHED UNDER MISSION AND SPIRITUAL CARE, A VICE-PRESIDENT NAMED TO LEAD THE DEPARTMENT, AND A PLAN DEVELOPED TO ENSURE THAT EACH HOSPITAL IN THE SYSTEM WOULD HAVE A COMMUNITY HEALTH EXPERT TO COORDINATE ITS COMMUNITY HEALTH WORK. THIS NEW SYSTEM LEVEL DEPARTMENT EXPANDED STAFFING RESOURCES AT CHRIST MEDICAL CENTER BY ADDING A NEW COORDINATOR POSITION DEDICATED TO THE MEDICAL CENTER AND THE POSITION OF SOUTH REGION DIRECTOR FOR CHRIST MEDICAL CENTER, AS WELL AS ADVOCATE TRINITY AND ADVOCATE SOUTH SUBURBAN HOSPITALS. COMMUNITY HEALTH COUNCIL CHRIST MEDICAL CENTER, IN COLLABORATION WITH ADVOCATE CHILDRENS HOSPITAL, CONVENED A COMMUNITY HEALTH COUNCIL TO OVERSEE ITS COMPREHENSIVE COMMUNITY HEALTH NEEDS ASSESSMENT. THIS COUNCIL WAS CHAIRED BY A MEMBER OF THE MEDICAL CENTERS GOVERNING COUNCIL AND COMPRISED OF REPRESENTATIVES FROM THE MEDICAL CENTERS COMMUNITY HEALTH TEAM, PATIENT ADVOCACY, COMMUNITY HEALTH RELATIONS, AND BUSINESS DEVELOPMENT DEPARTMENTS.

DIABETES REDUCE THE INCIDENCE OF DIABETES IN PSA COMMUNITIES THAT HAVE THE HIGHEST SOCIONEEDS INDEX - AUBURN GRESHAM, CHICAGO LAWN, BRIGHTON PARK, AND WEST ENGLEWOOD. CREATED BY THE HEALTHY COMMUNITIES INSTITUTE, THE SOCIONEEDS INDEX IS A MEASURE OF SOCIOECONOMIC NEED THAT IS CORRELATED WITH POOR HEALTH OUTCOMES. INDICATORS FOR THE INDEX ARE WEIGHTED TO MAXIMIZE THE CORRELATION OF THE INDEX WITH PREMATURE DEATH RATES AND PREVENTABLE HOSPITALIZATION RATES. THIS INDEX COMBINES MULTIPLE SOCIOECONOMIC INDICATORS INTO A SINGLE COMPOSITE VALUE. AS A SINGLE INDICATOR, THE INDEX CAN SERVE AS A CONCISE WAY TO EXPLAIN WHICH AREAS ARE OF HIGHEST NEED. THE SCORES CAN RANGE FROM 1 TO 100. A SCORE OF 100 REPRESENTS THE HIGHEST SOCIOECONOMIC NEED. STRATEGIES INCLUDE: 1. IMPLEMENTATION OF THE CENTER OF DISEASE CONTROL (CDC) NATIONAL DIABETES PREVENTION PROGRAM'S (DPP) PREVENT T2 IN TARGETED COMMUNITY AREAS IN PARTNERSHIP WITH COMMUNITY-BASED ORGANIZATIONS AND FAITH COMMUNITIES; 2.

THE COUNCIL IS COMPOSED OF VARIOUS KEY STAKEHOLDERS FROM COMMUNITIES WITHIN LUTHERAN GENERAL HOSPITAL'S SERVICE AREA. AFTER REVIEWING PRIMARY AND SECONDARY DATA, THE COUNCIL SELECTED THREE HEALTH NEEDS AS PRIORITIES FOR HOSPITAL ACTION: HEART DISEASE, HEALTH LITERACY AND WORKFORCE DEVELOPMENT. THE HOSPITAL'S COMMUNITY HEALTH COUNCIL MET QUARTERLY DURING THE 2014-2016 CHNA PROCESS. THERE WERE TWO ADDITIONAL MEETINGS IN 2016 FOR DATA REVIEW AND PRIORITIZATION OF HEALTH NEEDS. OUTLINED BELOW ARE THE THREE SELECTED PRIORITIES AND RESPECTIVE 2017 UPDATES FOR EACH PRIORITY. LUTHERAN GENERAL HOSPITALS SELECTED HEALTH NEEDS TO ADDRESS HEALTH LITERACY NAVIGATING THE HEALTH CARE SYSTEM PROGRAM-STRATEGY ONE: PARTNER WITH ADVOCATE CHILDREN'S HOSPITAL PARK RIDGE TO ENGAGE AND SUPPORT LOCAL SCHOOL DISTRICTS IN IMPLEMENTING THE NAVIGATING THE HEALTH CARE SYSTEM, A HEALTH LITERACY CURRICULUM. 2017 NAVIGATING THE HEALTH CARE SYSTEM-STRATEGY ONE UPDATES/PROGRESS *PARTNERED WITH THREE SCHOOLS IN DISTRICT 207 (MAINE EAST, WEST AND SOUTH) TO IMPLEMENT THE NAVIGATING THE HEALTH CARE SYSTEM PROGRAM. *THREE TEACHERS WERE TRAINED IN THE NAVIGATING THE HEALTH CARE SYSTEM CURRICULUM. *FOUR CLASSES WERE OFFERED TO THE NIGHT SCHOOL STUDENTS OF DISTRICT 207. *FORTY-FIVE STUDENTS COMPLETED THE NAVIGATING THE HEALTH CARE SYSTEM CURRICULUM. *THERE WAS A 10% INCREASE IN KNOWLEDGE AMONG DISTRICT 207 STUDENTS MEASURED BY THE HEALTH LITERACY POST-TEST.

201843189349304009,362169147,CULTURAL HEALTH DISPARITIES,"AS INDICATED IN THE 2011-2013 CHNA, CULTURAL HEALTH DISPARITIES STILL EXIST, BUT THIS AREA WAS NOT CHOSEN AS A PRIORITY FOR THE 2014-2016 CHNA. AS STATED IN AN EARLIER SECTION, LUTHERAN GENERAL HOSPITAL HAS CONTINUED TO EXPAND AND ENHANCE ITS CULTURAL INITIATIVES TO ADDRESS HEALTH EQUITY. THESE INITIATIVES INCLUDE THE SOUTH ASIAN CARDIOVASCULAR CENTER AND PROGRAMS FOR THE KOREAN, POLISH AND HISPANIC COMMUNITIES. ADVOCATE CHILDRENS HOSPITAL HEALTH NEEDS NOT SELECTED TO ADDRESS CHILDHOOD OBESITY ADVOCATE CHILDREN'S HOSPITAL DID NOT SELECT CHILDHOOD OBESITY AS A HEALTH NEED. THE HOSPITAL IS, HOWEVER, ADDRESSING CHILDHOOD OBESITY THROUGH THE HOSPITALS HEALTHY ACTIVE LIVING PROGRAM-A WEIGHT MANAGEMENT PROGRAM FOR OVERWEIGHT AND OBESE CHILDREN LARGELY INSURED THROUGH MEDICAID. COMPONENTS OF THE PROGRAM ARE OFFERED TO STUDENTS IN THE EXPANDED LEARNING PROGRAM OF EAST MAINE SCHOOL DISTRICT 63. ASTHMA HOSPITAL UTILIZATION DATA SHOWS THAT DES PLAINES AND WHEELING-AREAS WITH LARGE VOLUMES OF MEDICAID MANAGED CARE PARTICIPANTS-ARE TWO OF THE TOP NINE COMMUNITIES ACCOUNTING FOR SIXTY-ONE PERCENT OF ALL ASTHMA DISCHARGES. DATA ALSO SHOWS THAT THE EMERGENCY ROOM (ER) RATE DUE TO PEDIATRIC ASTHMA HAS STEADILY RISEN SINCE 2009. WHILE ASTHMA WAS NOT SPECIFICALLY SELECTED AS A HEALTH NEED, ASTHMA EDUCATION AND TREATMENT ARE A FOCUS OF PRIMARY CARE SERVICES BEING PROVIDED AS PART OF THE SCHOOL-BASED MODEL DESCRIBED ABOVE. SELECT SCHOOLS WITH LARGE CONCENTRATIONS OF CHILDREN WHO EXPERIENCE ASTHMA, AS IDENTIFIED BY STAFF OF THE RONALD MCDONALD CARE MOBILE, WILL RECEIVE THE AMERICAN LUNG ASSOCIATION'S KICKIN' ASTHMA PROGRAM. THIS PROGRAM OFFERS SMALL GROUP EDUCATION REGARDING TRIGGERS, SYMPTOMS AND PROPER MANAGEMENT OF THE DISEASE. ADVOCATE GOOD SAMARITAN HOSPITAL 2014-2016 CHNA HEALTH NEEDS SELECTED TO ADDRESS HEALTHY LIFESTYLES OBESITY AND POOR NUTRITION ARE THE MAIN CAUSES OF MANY CHRONIC DISEASES AND HEALTH ISSUES INCLUDING HEART DISEASE, STROKE, SOME CANCERS AND DIABETES. TAKING THIS INTO CONSIDERATION, THE CHC SELECTED HEALTHY LIFESTYLES AS ONE OF THE TWO HEALTH PRIORITIES TO ADDRESS, DUE TO THE LARGE IMPACT IT HAS ON QUALITY OF LIFE AND OVERALL HEALTH STATUS. THE PREVENTION OF OBESITY, PROPER NUTRITION AND PHYSICAL ACTIVITY HAVE THE POTENTIAL TO DECREASE THE RATE OF CHRONIC DISEASE THUS INCREASING LIFE EXPECTANCY AND QUALITY OF LIFE. THE TERM HEALTHY LIFESTYLES IS USED TO ENCOMPASS MULTIPLE FACTORS THAT CAUSE OBESITY AND IMPACT QUALITY. DATA ALSO REVEALED THAT LOW-INCOME POPULATIONS WITHIN DUPAGE COUNTY HAVE HIGHER RATES OF OBESITY INDICATING OBESITY PREVENTION AND NUTRITION EDUCATION IS AN ESSENTIAL NEED IN THE MORE VULNERABLE COMMUNITIES WITHIN THE HOSPITAL'S PRIMARY SERVICE AREA (PSA). BELOW, ARE STRATEGIES THAT THE HOSPITAL WILL IMPLEMENT TO ADDRESS THE HEALTHY LIFESTYLES PRIORITY IN THE HOSPITALS DEFINED COMMUNITY. FOOD PANTRY WORKSHOPS-STRATEGY ONE: PARTNER WITH UNIVERSITY OF ILLINOIS EXTENSION, NORTHERN ILLINOIS FOOD BANK AND LOCAL FOOD PANTRIES TO IMPLEMENT HEALTHY LIFESTYLE WORKSHOPS IN FOOD PANTRIES WITHIN GOOD SAMARITAN HOSPITAL'S PSA. 2017 FOOD PANTRY WORKSHOP-STRATEGY ONE UPDATES/PROGRESS A SERIES OF 4 WORKSHOPS PER PANTRY WERE IMPLEMENTED IN 2017. PEOPLES RESOURCE CENTER (WESTMONT) HAD 16 PARTICIPANTS (CONSISTENT THROUGHOUT SERIES) AND WEST SUBURBAN COMMUNITY FOOD PANTRY HAD 20 PARTICIPANTS (CONSISTENT THROUGHOUT SERIES). THERE WERE TWO FOOD PANTRIES THAT PARTICIPATED-PEOPLES RESOURCE CENTER (WESTMONT) AND WEST SUBURBAN COMMUNITY FOOD PANTRY. AN AVERAGE OF 65 PERCENT OF WORKSHOP SERIES PARTICIPANTS REPORTED THAT THEY PLANNED ON MAKING AT LEAST ONE HEALTHY CHANGE IN THEIR LIFESTYLE AS A RESULT OF THE WORKSHOP(S). 72 PERCENT OF WORKSHOP PARTICIPANTS REPORTED THAT THEY ""MOST OF THE TIME""ALMOST ALWAYS"" THINK ABOUT HEALTHY FOOD CHOICES WHEN FEEDING THEIR FAMILY AS A RESULT OF THE WORKSHOP(S). AN AVERAGE OF 90 PERCENT OF WORKSHOP PARTICIPANTS ""AGREED"" TO ""STRONGLY AGREED"" THAT THEY LEARNED NEW AND PRACTICAL INFORMATION AS A RESULT OF THE WORKSHOPS. AN UNEXPECTED ADDITIONAL POSITIVE OUTCOME OF THE WORKSHOP SERIES HAS BEEN THAT THE PARTICIPANTS HAVE BEGUN TO SHARE RECIPES AND IDEAS ABOUT IMPROVING THEIR LIFESTYLES WITH EACH OTHER, CREATING AN INFORMAL PEER SUPPORT GROUP. HEALTHY SCHOOLS PROGRAM-STRATEGY TWO: PARTNER WITH ACTION FOR HEALTHY KIDS TO SUPPORT SCHOOLS IN GOOD SAMARITAN HOSPITAL'S PSA IN CREATING A HEALTHY SCHOOL ENVIRONMENT AND BECOMING RECOGNIZED AS A CERTIFIED HEALTHY SCHOOL UNDER THE USDA'S HEALTHIER US SCHOOLS CHALLENGE. 2017 HEALTHY SCHOOLS PROGRAM - STRATEGY TWO UPDATES/PROGRESS GOOD SAMARITAN HOSPITAL AND ACTION FOR HEALTHY KIDS (AFHK) IS COLLABORATING WITH TWO SCHOOLS IN THE HOSPITAL'S PSA. BOTH SCHAFER AND SIPLEY ELEMENTARY SCHOOLS HAVE 50 PERCENT OF STUDENTS WHO ARE LOW-INCOME AND ELIGIBLE FOR FREE/REDUCED LUNCH. BOTH PARTNER SCHOOLS HAVE ACTIVE SCHOOL HEALTH TEAMS THAT ARE ENGAGED IN THE IMPLEMENTATION OF ACTION PLAN STRATEGIES. IN 2017, THERE HAVE BEEN AT LEAST 15 TECHNICAL ASSISTANCE INTERACTIONS WITH EACH PARTNER SCHOOL. THE AVERAGE SHI SCORE WAS 71.95% (SIPLEY 66.67%, SCHAFER 77.22%). BOTH SCHOOLS IMPLEMENTED AT LEAST ONE PHYSICAL ACTIVITY IMPROVEMENT STRATEGY. BOTH SCHOOLS SHARED INFORMATION ON PHYSICAL ACTIVITY AND NUTRITION WITH PARENTS THROUGH THE SCHOOL NEWSLETTER. PROACTIVE KIDS-STRATEGY THREE: GOOD SAMARITAN HOSPITAL, IN PARTNERSHIP WITH EDWARD-ELMHURST HEALTH SYSTEM, WILL IMPLEMENT AN 8-WEEK HEALTHY LIFESTYLE PROGRAM FOR OBESE AND OVERWEIGHT CHILDREN LIVING IN GOOD SAMARITAN HOSPITALS PSA. 2017 PROACTIVE KIDS - STRATEGY THREE UPDATES/PROGRESS GOOD SAMARITAN HOSPITAL AND EDWARD-ELMHURST HEALTH OFFERED ONE PAK SESSION AT THE LOMBARD PARK DISTRICT. -10 KIDS WERE IN ATTENDANCE FOR THE FIRST PAK SESSION AT THE LOMBARD PARK DISTRICT. -48 PERCENT OF PAK REGISTRANTS ATTENDED THE FIRST CLASS OF EACH SESSION. -7 OUT OF THE 10 (70 PERCENT) KIDS GRADUATED FROM THE PROGRAM. -40 PERCENT OF PARTICIPANTS RECOGNIZED A SIGNIFICANT TO SOLID IMPROVEMENT IN THEIR COMMITMENT TO FITNESS AT THE CONCLUSION OF THE 8-WEEK PROGRAM. -40 PERCENT OF PROGRAM PARTICIPANTS REPORTED RECOGNIZING A SIGNIFICANT TO SOLID IMPROVEMENT IN THEIR DIET AND NUTRITION AT THE CONCLUSION OF THE 8-WEEK PROGRAM. CARDIOVASCULAR WORKSHOPS - STRATEGY FOUR: THE GOOD SAMARITAN HOSPITAL CARDIOVASCULAR (CV) SERVICE LINE WILL CREATE AND IMPLEMENT 2-3 HEALTHY LIFESTYLE WORKSHOPS IN THE HOSPITALS PSA. 2017 CARDIOVASCULAR WORKSHOPS - STRATEGY FOUR UPDATES/PROGRESS GOOD SAMARITAN HOSPITAL'S CV SERVICE LINE IMPLEMENTED 2 WORKSHOPS IN 2017. -63 PEOPLE PARTICIPATED IN HEALTHY LIFESTYLE WORKSHOPS IN 2017. -100 PERCENT OF PARTICIPANTS WERE ABLE TO IDENTIFY AT LEAST TWO RISK FACTORS FOR HEART AND BRAIN ATTACKS AT THE CONCLUSION OF THE WORKSHOP. -2 ORGANIZATIONS HOSTED THE WORKSHOP IN 2017-GLORIA DEI LUTHERAN CHURCH AND VILLA ST. BENEDICT. MENTAL HEALTH THE CHC SELECTED MENTAL HEALTH AS THE SECOND HEALTH NEED PRIORITY. DATA TRENDS INDICATED THAT MENTAL HEALTH ISSUES ARE INCREASING AND THE NEED FOR MENTAL HEALTH SERVICES AND PROGRAMMING IS CONTINUING TO GROW. THIS IS A HEALTH NEED THAT IS ALSO CORRELATED WITH SUBSTANCE ABUSE AS MANY SUBSTANCE USERS/ABUSERS ALSO EXPERIENCE MENTAL HEALTH ISSUES AND MANY INDIVIDUALS WITH MENTAL HEALTH DISORDERS EXPERIENCE SUBSTANCE ABUSE ISSUES. THE NATIONAL ALLIANCE FOR MENTAL ILLNESS (NAMI), ONE OF THE LEADING MENTAL HEALTH AGENCIES IN DUPAGE COUNTY, PROVIDED MENTAL HEALTH DATA THAT ALSO INDICATED THE NEED FOR RESILIENCE AND MENTAL HEALTH CRISIS TRAINING AMONG ADOLESCENTS AND YOUNG ADULTS. THE HIGH RATES OF ED VISITS AND HOSPITALIZATION DUE TO MENTAL HEALTH ISSUES ARE PREVENTABLE THROUGH EMPLOYING COPING MECHANISMS AND RESILIENCE TRAINING. THE CHC IS SPECIFICALLY INTERESTED IN PROGRAMS THAT PREVENT MENTAL HEALTH EMERGENCIES AND DECREASE ED VISITS AND HOSPITALIZATION DUE TO MENTAL HEALTH ISSUES. BELOW, ARE STRATEGIES THAT THE HOSPITAL WILL IMPLEMENT TO ADDRESS MENTAL HEALTH IN THE HOSPITALS PSA. ENDING THE SILENCE-STRATEGY ONE: PARTNER WITH NATIONAL ALLIANCE ON MENTAL ILLNESS (NAMI DUPAGE) TO IMPLEMENT THE ENDING THE SILENCE (ETS) PROGRAM IN MIDDLE AND HIGH SCHOOLS WITHIN GOOD SAMARITAN HOSPITAL'S PSA. 2017 ENDING THE SILENCE - STRATEGY ONE UPDATES/PROGRESS: -IN 2017, OVER 11 ETS CLASSES WERE HELD AT WESTMONT HIGH AND EISENHOWER MIDDLE SCHOOLS. -OVER 200 STUDENTS PARTICIPATED AND COMPLETED THE ETS PROGRAM. -2 SCHOOLS HOSTED THE ETS PROGRAM IN 2017 - WESTMONT HIGH SCHOOL AND EISENHOWER MIDDLE SCHOOL. -92 PERCENT OF WESTMONT HIGH SCHOOL STUDENTS REPORTED THEY KNEW THE SIGNS OF MENTAL ILLNESS IN THE POST EVALUATION SURVEY. -63 PERCENT OF WESTMONT HIGH SCHOOL STUDENTS REPORTED FEELING MORE COMFORTABLE TALKING ABOUT MENTAL ILLNESS ON THE POST EVALUATION SURVEY. -74 PERCENT OF WESTMONT HIGH SCHOOL STUDENTS REPORTED LEARNING NEW INFORMATION ABOUT MENTAL ILLNESS ON THE POST EVALUATION SURVEY. MENTAL HEALTH FIRST AID - STRATEGY TWO: PROVIDE MENTAL HEALTH FIRST AID (MHFA) TO HOSPITAL ASSOCIATES AND STAFF AND COMMUNITY ORGANIZATIONS/BUSINESSES SERV"
201843189349304009,362169147,ADVOCATE GOOD SHEPHERD HOSPITAL,"2014-2016 CHNA GOOD SHEPHERD HOSPITAL CONDUCTED A COMPREHENSIVE COMMUNITY HEALTH NEEDS ASSESSMENT WHICH INCLUDED THE SELECTION OF HEALTH PRIORITIES THROUGH A CONSENSUS PRIORITIZATION PROCESS BY THE COMMUNITY HEALTH COUNCIL. THE COUNCIL RECOMMENDED, AND THE HOSPITAL GOVERNING COUNCIL APPROVED, TWO HEALTH AREAS FOR PRIORITY ACTION: OBESITY AND MENTAL HEALTH. STEPS BEING TAKEN TO ADDRESS THE TWO PRIORITIES ARE BELOW. NEEDS SELECTED TO ADDRESS OBESITY GOOD SHEPHERD HOSPITAL IS ADDRESSING OBESITY IN THE SERVICE AREA THROUGH THREE EVIDENCE-BASED PROGRAMS. THE FIRST PROGRAM IS THE NUTRITION AND PHYSICAL ACTIVITY SELF-ASSESSMENT FOR CHILD CARE (GO NAP SACC) PROGRAM. THE GO NAP SACC PROGRAM IS AN EVIDENCE-BASED EARLY INTERVENTION PROGRAM TARGETING INFANTS THROUGH PRE-KINDERGARTEN WHICH AIMS TO ADVANCE THE CHILDCARE ENVIRONMENT BY IMPROVING NUTRITION, PHYSICAL ACTIVITY AND POLICIES IN THE CHILD CARE CENTER. THE HOSPITAL WILL LEAD THE GO NAP SACC ASSESSMENT PROCESS WITH CHILDCARE CENTERS IN COMMUNITIES WITH HIGH SOCIONEEDS INDEX SCORES WITHIN THE HOSPITAL SERVICE AREA. SOCIOECONOMIC NEED WAS DETERMINED BY THE HEALTHY COMMUNITIES INSTITUTES (HCI) CALCULATIONS TO CREATE AN INDEX USING SIX MAJOR SOCIO-NEEDS INDICATORS THAT ARE CORRELATED WITH POOR HEALTH OUTCOMES. THE INDICATORS INCLUDE INCOME, UNEMPLOYMENT, OCCUPATION, EDUCATION, LANGUAGE, AND POVERTY. GOOD SHEPHERD HOSPITAL HAS PARTNERED WITH ADVOCATE CONDELL MEDICAL CENTER AND ADVOCATE SHERMAN HOSPITAL TO MAKE THIS PROGRAM A REGIONAL INITIATIVE. IN 2017, ADVOCATE HEALTH CARE LED THE LAUNCH OF A MULTI-STAKEHOLDER CHICAGOLAND COALITION TO RAISE FUNDS FOR THE WEB-BASED GO NAP SACC PROGRAM FOR THE STATE OF ILLINOIS. THE UNIVERSITY OF NORTH CAROLINA PERFORMED ON-LINE DEMONSTRATIONS OF GO NAP SACC TO COALITION MEMBERS AND COMMUNITY PARTNERS. GOOD SHEPHERD HOSPITAL STAFF HELD MULTIPLE PLANNING MEETINGS WITH THE LAKE COUNTY HEALTH DEPARTMENT AND COMPLETED A NAP SACC TRAINING. THE COMMUNITY HEALTH STAFF ALSO DEVELOPED A NAP SACC INFORMATION GUIDE AND PROMOTIONAL MATERIALS FOR RECRUITING CHILDCARE CENTERS IN THE COMMUNITY. THE SECOND OBESITY-PREVENTION PROGRAM IS THE CENTERS FOR DISEASE CONTROL AND PREVENTION (CDC) WORKSITE WELLNESS PROGRAM WHICH TARGETS ADULTS IN THE WORKPLACE. THE PROGRAM FOLLOWS THE CDC FOUR-STEP WORKPLACE HEALTH MODEL AND INVOLVES USING THE CDC WORKSITE HEALTH SCORECARD. WORKSITE NUTRITION AND PHYSICAL ACTIVITY PROGRAMS ARE DESIGNED TO IMPROVE HEALTH-RELATED BEHAVIORS AND HEALTH OUTCOMES. GOOD SHEPHERD HOSPITAL COMMUNITY HEALTH STAFF IS WORKING WITH THE HOSPITALS COMMUNITY RELATIONS DIRECTOR TO PROVIDE WORKSITE HEALTH TRAINING AND PROGRAMS TO CHAMBERS OF COMMERCE AND SMALL BUSINESSES WITHIN THE SERVICE AREA. IN 2017, GOOD SHEPHERD HOSPITAL ESTABLISHED RELATIONSHIPS WITH THE ALGONQUIN/LAKE IN THE HILLS (LITH) CHAMBER OF COMMERCE AND THE CRYSTAL LAKE CHAMBER OF COMMERCE. THE CHAMBERS ASSISTED IN FACILITATING RELATIONSHIPS WITH LOCAL SMALL BUSINESSES THAT WERE INTERESTED IN CREATING AND IMPLEMENTING A WORKSITE WELLNESS PROGRAM. HOSPITAL STAFF PROVIDED A WORKSITE WELLNESS PRESENTATION TO 17 CHAMBER BUSINESSES THROUGH THE ALGONQUIN/LITH CHAMBER OF COMMERCE. CASA (COURT APPOINTED SPECIAL ADVOCATE) MCHENRY COUNTY COMPLETED THE CDC WORKSITE WELLNESS SCORECARD ASSESSMENT AND DRAFTED AN ACTION PLAN FOR 2018. AFTER CASA REVIEWED THEIR WORKSITES STRENGTHS AND WEAKNESSES, THEY SELECTED TO TARGET STAFF EDUCATION AND POLICIES IN THEIR 2018 ACTION PLAN. THE THIRD OBESITY PREVENTION INITIATIVE IS FOOD INSECURITY (FI) SCREENING AND RESOURCE REFERRAL. THE FI SCREEN RAPIDLY IDENTIFIES HOUSEHOLDS AT RISK FOR FOOD INSECURITY, ENABLING PROVIDERS TO TARGET SERVICES THAT AMELIORATE THE ASSOCIATED HEALTH AND DEVELOPMENTAL CONSEQUENCES. THE TWO - ITEM EVIDENCE-BASED FI SCREEN TOOL WAS ORIGINALLY DESIGNED TO BE SENSITIVE, SPECIFIC AND VALID AMONG LOW-INCOME FAMILIES WITH YOUNG CHILDREN. THE HOSPITAL WILL COLLABORATE WITH SENIOR SERVICE ORGANIZATIONS IN THE GOOD SHEPHERD HOSPITAL SERVICE AREA TO SCREEN SENIORS FOR FOOD INSECURITY, USING THE HUNGER VITAL SIGN FI QUESTIONNAIRE. INDIVIDUALS WHO ARE IDENTIFIED AS FOOD INSECURE ARE REFERRED TO COMMUNITY RESOURCES (FOOD PANTRIES, SUPPLEMENTAL NUTRITION ASSISTANCE PROGRAM (SNAP), MEALS ON WHEELS, CONGREGATE MEAL PROGRAMS, FARMERS MARKETS AND COMMUNITY GARDENS. IN 2017, GOOD SHEPHERD HOSPITAL STAFF CREATED THE GOOD SHEPHERD HOSPITAL FOOD AND NUTRITION RESOURCE GUIDE WITH 45 RESOURCES THROUGHOUT THE COMMUNITY. THIS GUIDE IS AVAILABLE TO ANY COMMUNITY MEMBER AND IS PROVIDED TO ALL SENIORS SCREENING POSITIVE FOR FOOD INSECURITY AT THE LOCAL SENIOR PARTNER LOCATIONS. COMMUNITY HEALTH STAFF RECRUITED AND TRAINED TWO AGENCIES WHO COUNSEL AND ASSIST SENIORS IN THE COMMUNITY, THE GOOD SHEPHERD HOSPITAL SENIOR SERVICES DEPARTMENT AND THE BARRINGTON AREA COUNCIL ON AGING (BACOA). EACH OF THESE AGENCIES INCORPORATED THE HUNGER VITAL SIGN FI SCREENING INTO THEIR COUNSELING APPOINTMENTS WITH SENIORS. IN 2017, 180 SENIORS COMPLETED THE HUNGER VITAL SIGN SCREENING AND SEVEN SENIORS SCREENED POSITIVE FOR FOOD INSECURITY (FOUR PERCENT). MENTAL HEALTH THE HOSPITAL IS ADDRESSING MENTAL HEALTH IN THE GOOD SHEPHERD HOSPITAL SERVICE AREA THROUGH THREE STRATEGIES. THE FIRST STRATEGY UTILIZES MENTAL HEALTH FIRST AID TRAINING. MENTAL HEALTH FIRST AID IS AN INTERNATIONAL EVIDENCE-BASED PROGRAM, DESIGNED TO HELP PEOPLE RECOGNIZE INDIVIDUALS WITH MENTAL HEALTH PROBLEMS AND PROVIDE SKILLS TO HELP THOSE WHO ARE HAVING A MENTAL HEALTH CRISIS TO ACCESS HELP. THE HOSPITAL WILL HOLD MULTIPLE EIGHT-HOUR MENTAL HEALTH FIRST AID SESSIONS IN MCHENRY COUNTY. USING THE MENTAL HEALTH YOUTH FIRST AID CURRICULUM, THE HOSPITAL WILL TARGET TEACHERS, PHYSICAL EDUCATION (PE) INSTRUCTORS AND COACHES. THE HOSPITAL WILL ALSO HOLD EIGHT-HOUR MENTAL HEALTH FIRST AID SESSIONS FOR GOOD SHEPHERD HOSPITAL CARE MANAGERS, SOCIAL WORKERS AND ONCOLOGY NURSE NAVIGATORS. FINALLY, THE HOSPITAL WILL ENSURE THE TRAINING OF TWO INDIVIDUALS TO BECOME MENTAL HEALTH FIRST AID INSTRUCTORS, WHICH REQUIRES COMPLETING A 40-HOUR TRAINING COURSE. IN 2017, GOOD SHEPHERD HOSPITAL HOSTED ONE MENTAL HEALTH FIRST AID TRAINING IN PUBLIC SAFETY TO 23 FIRST RESPONDERS IN WAUCONDA AND THROUGHOUT THE COMMUNITY. THIS SESSION WAS HELD IN PARTNERSHIP WITH ADVOCATE CONDELL MEDICAL CENTER. POST-SURVEY RESULTS SHOWED ONE HUNDRED PERCENT OF PARTICIPANTS HAD AN INCREASED KNOWLEDGE OF DE-ESCALATION TECHNIQUES AND WERE MORE CONFIDENT ABOUT RECOGNIZING AND CORRECTING MISCONCEPTIONS ABOUT MENTAL HEALTH AND MENTAL ILLNESSES. THROUGH COLLABORATION WITH CONDELL MEDICAL CENTER, THE HOSPITAL ALSO SPONSORED ONE POLICE OFFICER FROM THE WAUCONDA POLICE DEPARTMENT TO COMPLETE THE 40-HOUR MENTAL HEALTH FIRST AID PUBLIC SAFETY INSTRUCTOR COURSE. THIS POLICE OFFICER NOW IS INSTRUCTING OTHER POLICE OFFICERS AND FIRST RESPONDERS IN THE COMMUNITY IN THE 8-HOUR MENTAL HEALTH FIRST AID CLASS. AFTER MULTIPLE MEETINGS WITH SCHOOL DISTRICTS, DISCUSSING MENTAL HEALTH YOUTH FIRST AID TRAINING, IT WAS DISCOVERED THAT AN EIGHT-HOUR COURSE IS DIFFICULT TO SCHEDULE FOR TEACHERS DURING THE SCHOOL DAY. DUE TO THIS, THE HOSPITAL ARRANGED A ONE-HOUR QUESTION, PERSUADE AND REFER (QPR) AND STRESS MANAGEMENT TRAINING FOR 64 HEINEMAN MIDDLE SCHOOL STAFF AND ADMINISTRATORS. QPR IS AN EVIDENCE-BASED SUICIDE PREVENTION TRAINING DESIGNED TO EMPOWER A PERSON WITH THE TOOLS TO IDENTIFY IF SOMEONE IS SUICIDAL AND REFER THEM TO PROFESSIONAL RESOURCES. WAUCONDA HIGH SCHOOL SCHEDULED A MENTAL HEALTH YOUTH FIRST AID TRAINING SESSION FOR FEBRUARY OF 2018, WITH THE CURRICULUM TAILORED TO FIT INTO THE SCHOOL PROFESSIONAL DEVELOPMENT SCHEDULE. THE SECOND STRATEGY TO ADDRESS MENTAL HEALTH IS TO INCREASE THE NUMBER OF ADULTS WHO ARE SCREENED FOR DEPRESSION AND, IF POSITIVE, REFERRED TO SUPPORTIVE SERVICES BY HEALTH CARE PROFESSIONALS. COLLABORATIVE CARE FOR THE MANAGEMENT OF DEPRESSIVE DISORDERS IS A MULTICOMPONENT, HEALTHCARE SYSTEM-LEVEL INTERVENTION THAT USES CASE MANAGERS TO LINK PRIMARY CARE PROVIDERS, PATIENTS AND MENTAL HEALTH SPECIALISTS. THIS COLLABORATION IS DESIGNED TO IMPROVE THE ROUTINE SCREENING AND DIAGNOSIS OF DEPRESSIVE DISORDERS, INCREASE PROVIDER USES OF EVIDENCE-BASED PROTOCOLS FOR THE PROACTIVE MANAGEMENT OF DIAGNOSED DEPRESSIVE DISORDERS, AND IMPROVE CLINICAL AND COMMUNITY SUPPORT FOR ACTIVE PATIENT ENGAGEMENT IN TREATMENT GOAL SETTING AND SELF-MANAGEMENT. GOOD SHEPHERD HOSPITAL IS SCREENING HOSPITAL PATIENTS, AGE 65 AND OLDER, OBSTETRIC PATIENTS AND CARDIOLOGY PATIENTS. HOSPITAL HEALTH CARE PROFESSIONALS REFER INDIVIDUALS WHO SCREEN POSITIVE TO COMMUNITY AND MENTAL HEALTH SUPPORT SERVICES. IN 2017, GOOD SHEPHERD HOSPITAL STRENGTHENED RELATIONSHIPS WITH THE LAKE COUNTY HEALTH DEPARTMENT AND THE MCHENRY COUNTY MENTAL HEALTH BOARD WITH THE GOAL OF IMPROVING THE REFERRAL PROCESS. COMMUNITY HEALTH STAFF COMPLETED VERIFICATION THAT DEPRESSION SCREENINGS USING THE PHQ-9 SCREENING TOOL ARE OCCURRING AT GOOD SHEPHERD HOSPITAL. REFERRALS TO MENTAL HEALTH PROVIDERS ARE BEING COMPLETED BY PHYSICIANS"
201843189349304009,362169147,ADVOCATE SOUTH SUBURBAN HOSPITAL,"2014-2016 CHNA AS AN IMPORTANT PART OF THE CHNA PROCESS, SOUTH SUBURBAN HOSPITAL'S COMMUNITY HEALTH TEAM REVIEWED HICCC DATA AS WELL AS ADDITIONAL SERVICE AREA SPECIFIC DATA FROM PRIMARY AND SECONDARY SOURCES. THIS DATA HIGHLIGHTED THE PREVALENT HEALTH ISSUES WITHIN THE HOSPITAL'S PRIMARY AND SECONDARY SERVICE AREA. AFTER REVIEW OF EXTENSIVE DATA, THE LEADING CAUSES OF DEATH, HOSPITALIZATIONS AND OVERARCHING HEALTH ISSUES WERE SUMMARIZED AND PRESENTED TO THE HOSPITAL'S COMMUNITY HEALTH COUNCIL FOR PRIORITIZATION. DATA PRESENTED TO THE CHC TARGETED THE FOLLOWING HEALTH CONDITIONS IDENTIFIED AS IMPORTANT IN SOUTH SUBURBAN HOSPITAL'S PRIMARY AND SECONDARY SERVICE AREA: ASTHMA, CANCER, DIABETES, HEART DISEASE, HYPERTENSION AND STROKE. THE FOLLOWING CRITERIA WERE ALSO CONSIDERED IN DETERMINING PRIORITIES: *DEGREE TO WHICH COMMUNITY PARTNERS ARE INVOLVED IN SOLVING/ADDRESSING THE HEALTH ISSUE; *HOSPITAL AND COMMUNITY RESOURCES AVAILABLE TO ADDRESS THE HEALTH ISSUE; *HOSPITAL'S CAPACITY TO ADDRESS THE HEALTH ISSUES; *IMPORTANCE OF THE HEALTH PROBLEM TO THE COMMUNITY; AND *DEGREE TO WHICH EFFECTIVE PROGRAMS ARE AVAILABLE TO THE COMMUNITY. AFTER DISCUSSION AND REVIEW OF SIGNIFICANT DATA FINDINGS, THE CHC MEMBERS WERE INSTRUCTED TO RANK THE SEVEN HEALTH CONDITIONS BY VOTING ON THOSE THAT THEY PERCEIVED TO BE THE MOST IMPORTANT TO ADDRESS FOR THE COMMUNITIES WITHIN THE HOSPITAL'S PRIMARY SERVICE AREA. THE MULTI-VOTING STRATEGY RESULTED IN ASTHMA AND DIABETES RECEIVING THE HIGHEST NUMBER OF VOTES. HOUSING WAS SELECTED AS A FOCUS AREA BY CHC MEMBERS AS THE SOCIAL, ECONOMIC OR STRUCTURAL DETERMINANT OF HEALTH RELATED TO THE HICCC PRIORITY. THEREFORE, FOR THE 2014-2016 CHNA, SOUTH SUBURBAN HOSPITAL SELECTED THREE PRIORITIES FOR IMPLEMENTATION PLANNING: 1) ASTHMA; 2) DIABETES; AND 3) HOUSING AS A SOCIAL DETERMINANT OF HEALTH (SDOH). NEEDS SELECTED AS PRIORITIES TO ADDRESS ASTHMA ASTHMA AND OTHER RESPIRATORY-RELATED DISEASES WITHIN SOUTH SUBURBAN HOSPITAL'S PSA WERE SELECTED AS THE TOP HEALTH NEED TO ADDRESS. AN EXAMINATION OF SOUTH SUBURBAN HOSPITAL'S INPATIENT ADMISSIONS AND EMERGENCY DEPARTMENT UTILIZATION DATA SHOWED THERE WERE A SIGNIFICANT NUMBER OF INDIVIDUALS THAT SEEK SERVICES FOR ASTHMA/RESPIRATORY HEALTH ISSUES FROM THE HOSPITAL. IN FACT, PULMONARY ADMISSIONS WERE THE SECOND MOST PREVALENT TYPE OF INPATIENT ADMISSION AND THE EIGHTH MOST PREVALENT REASON FOR EMERGENCY DEPARTMENT VISITS. THE SEVERITY AND PREVALENCE OF ASTHMA IS MOST EVIDENT IN LOW-INCOME, MINORITY COMMUNITIES. TO ADDRESS ASTHMA IN THE HIGH-RISK COMMUNITIES THE HOSPITAL SERVES, THE HOSPITAL HAS DIRECTED ITS KICKIN' ASTHMA PROGRAM TOWARD THE MOST VULNERABLE COMMUNITIES IN ITS SERVICE AREA. THESE COMMUNITIES INCLUDE: CHICAGO HEIGHTS, 60411; HARVEY, 60426; MARKHAM, 60428; HAZEL CREST, 60429; AND COUNTRY CLUB HILLS, 60478. THE FOLLOWING OUTCOMES WERE ACHIEVED DURING 2017: STRATEGY 1: EXPAND THE KICKIN ASTHMA PROGRAM TO SCHOOLS IN THE FOLLOWING ZIP CODES: 60411, 60426, 60428, 60429 AND 60478. *3 PARTNER SCHOOLS HOSTED THE KICKIN ASTHMA PROGRAM IN 2017. *31 STUDENTS PARTICIPATED IN THE PROGRAM AT A PARTICIPATION RATE OF 88%. *ZERO OF THE 31 STUDENTS WHO TOOK THE KICKIN' ASTHMA CLASS HAD AN ED VISIT WITHIN 3 MONTHS POST PROGRAM. STRATEGY 2: WORK WITH THE SOUTH SUBURBAN HOSPITAL ASTHMA COMMITTEE TO IMPROVE DISEASE SELF-MANAGEMENT SKILLS FOR PATIENTS AND FAMILIES WITH ASTHMA*. *87% OF PEDIATRIC PATIENTS AGE 5-17 YEARS WITH A DIAGNOSIS OF ASTHMA SYMPTOMS IN THE ED RECEIVED AN ASTHMA ACTION PLAN. *78% OF PEDIATRIC PATIENTS AGE 5-17 YEARS WITH A DIAGNOSIS OF ASTHMA SYMPTOMS IN THE ED RECEIVED ASTHMA EDUCATION AS DOCUMENTED IN THE CHART. *93% OF PEDIATRIC PATIENTS WITH A DIAGNOSIS OF ASTHMA SYMPTOMS IN THE ED WERE DISCHARGED WITH STEROIDS. *100% OF PEDIATRIC PATIENTS WITH A PRIMARY DIAGNOSIS OF ASTHMA SYMPTOMS IN THE ED HAD PARENTS OR GUARDIANS WHO INDICATED THE DISCHARGE PRESCRIPTIONS WERE FILLED AS VERIFIED BY A POST-DISCHARGE CALL. *READMISSIONS/REVISITS RATES FOR 2017 WAS 4% OF ED PEDIATRIC VISITS FOR ASTHMA THAT REPRESENTED READMISSIONS FOR ASTHMA FOR THE CALENDAR YEAR. THERE WERE 229 ED VISITS WITH ONLY 10 READMISSIONS/REVISITS. IT SHOULD BE NOTED THAT DATA FROM JULY THROUGH DECEMBER WAS NOT CAPTURED BY THE RESPIRATORY DEPARTMENT DUE TO SIGNIFICANT STAFF CHANGES. STRATEGY 3: PROVIDE ASTHMA EDUCATION THROUGH PARTNERSHIPS WITH COMMUNITY ORGANIZATIONS THAT TEACH PARTICIPANTS WHAT ADULTS SHOULD DO IN CASE A CHILD EXPERIENCES AN ASTHMA ATTACK. *THERE WERE 7 PARTNERSHIPS ESTABLISHED WITH COMMUNITY-BASED ORGANIZATIONS IN 2017 WITH A TOTAL OF 17 HOURS OF ASTHMA EDUCATION OFFERED. *24 PARTICIPANTS FROM THE 7 PARTNER ORGANIZATIONS WERE TRAINED IN ASTHMA EDUCATION. *ALL ATTENDEES INDICATED AN INCREASED KNOWLEDGE OF ASTHMA DURING A POST TRAINING POLL. DIABETES ACCORDING TO THE ILLINOIS DEPARTMENT OF PUBLIC HEALTH, MORE THAN 29 MILLION PEOPLE IN THE UNITED STATES HAVE DIABETES MELLITUS. ABOUT ONE-THIRD OF THESE PEOPLE ARE UNAWARE THAT THEY HAVE DIABETES AND ARE NOT UNDER MEDICAL CARE. EACH YEAR, 1.9 MILLION NEW CASES OF DIABETES ARE DIAGNOSED IN PEOPLE AGE 20 YEARS AND OLDER. IN ILLINOIS, APPROXIMATELY 800,000 PEOPLE 18 YEARS OF AGE AND OLDER HAVE DIAGNOSED DIABETES, WITH ANOTHER 500,000 PEOPLE UNAWARE THEY HAVE THE DISEASE. INDIVIDUALS WITH DIABETES ARE AT INCREASED RISK FOR HEART DISEASE, BLINDNESS, KIDNEY FAILURE, AND LOWER EXTREMITY AMPUTATIONS (NOT RELATED TO INJURIES). DIABETES AND ITS COMPLICATIONS OCCUR AMONG ALL AGE, RACIAL AND ETHNIC GROUPS. TO ADDRESS DIABETES IN THE HIGHER RISK COMMUNITIES IT SERVES, THE HOSPITAL IS SEEKING TO BECOME A CDC RECOGNIZED FACILITY TO IMPLEMENT THE PREVENT T2 DIABETES PREVENTION PROGRAM. THE HOSPITAL HAS PARTNERED WITH LOCAL CHURCHES AND COMMUNITY PARTNERS TO HOST THE PROGRAM. THE PROGRAM IS DESIGNED TO EDUCATE INDIVIDUALS WHO HAVE BEEN DIAGNOSED WITH PRE-DIABETES TO PREVENT OR DELAY THE ONSET OF DIABETES THROUGH EDUCATION, DIET AND EXERCISE. THE FOLLOWING OUTCOMES WERE ACHIEVED DURING 2017: STRATEGY 1: HIRE A LIFESTYLE COACH TO IMPLEMENT THE NATIONAL DIABETES PREVENTION PROGRAM (DPP), PREVENT T2, IN MARKHAM (60428) AND CHICAGO HEIGHTS (60411) IN COLLABORATION WITH COMMUNITY ORGANIZATIONS. *THE HOSPITAL COMMUNITY HEALTH COORDINATOR RECEIVED TRAINING TO BECOME A LIFESTYLE COACH TO FACILITATE THE 2017 SESSION. *2 CONTRACTUAL LIFESTYLE COACHES RECEIVED TRAINING IN NOVEMBER 2017 TO EXECUTE ADDITIONAL SESSIONS IN 2018. *THERE WAS 1 COHORT IN PROGRESS DURING 2017 WITH 16 CLASSES HELD. *SOUTH SUBURBAN HOSPITAL PARTNERED WITH ABUNDANT LIVING CHRISTIAN CENTER IN DOLTON, ILLINOIS, TO HOST THE INAUGURAL SESSION IN 2017 *60% OF THE PARTICIPANTS WERE ELIGIBLE TO PARTICIPATE IN THE PREVENT T2 PROGRAM BASED ON THEIR A1C LEVEL. *40% OF THE ORIGINAL PROGRAM PARTICIPANTS ARE STILL IN THE PROGRAM. *IMPACT INDICATOR MEASUREMENTS WILL NOT BE AVAILABLE UNTIL ONE YEARS WORTH OF DATA IS CAPTURED AND EXAMINED. STRATEGY 2: ESTABLISH SOUTH SUBURBAN HOSPITAL AS A CDC DESIGNATED DIABETES PREVENTION PROGRAM APPROVED SITE. *SOUTH SUBURBAN HOSPITAL COMPLETED, SUBMITTED AND RECEIVED CDC PENDING APPROVAL ON MAY 3, 2017, TO BECOME A CDC APPROVED SITE. *A TIMELINE FOR PROGRAM IMPLEMENTATION WAS DEVELOPED FOR THE PREVENT T2 PROGRAM IN JULY 2017. *THE FIRST PREVENT T2 PROGRAM BEGAN ON TUESDAY, AUGUST 22, 2017. *50% OF PARTICIPANTS IN THE PROGRAM SELF-REPORTED = 150 MINUTES OF MODERATE PHYSICAL ACTIVITY. STRATEGY 3: RAISE AWARENESS OF PREDIABETES THROUGH EDUCATION PROGRAMS IN FAITH-BASED ORGANIZATIONS IN MARKHAM (60428) AND CHICAGO HEIGHTS (60411). *6 COMMUNITY PARTNERS WERE IDENTIFIED TO HOST PREDIABETES AWARENESS SESSIONS. *5 EDUCATION SESSIONS WERE CONDUCTED REGARDING DIABETES AWARENESS. *189 INDIVIDUALS RECEIVED EDUCATIONAL INFORMATION AT COMMUNITY PARTNER SITES REGARDING PREDIABETES. *SOUTH SUBURBAN HOSPITALS DIETITIAN PROVIDED COUNSELING TO 50 INDIVIDUALS AT VICTORY APOSTOLIC CHURCH IN JULY 2017 TO HELP THEM UNDERSTAND HOW FOOD IMPACTS DIABETES. *SOUTH SUBURBAN HOSPITALS DIETITIAN AND PHYSICIAN PROVIDED DIABETES EDUCATION TO 186 INDIVIDUALS IN 2017, WITH 10 INDIVIDUALS REFERRED TO THE PREVENT T2 PROGRAM."

ASTHMA ASTHMA IS A CONDITION IN WHICH A PERSONS AIR PASSAGES BECOME INFLAMED, AND THE NARROWING OF THE RESPIRATORY PASSAGES MAKES IT DIFFICULT TO BREATHE. ASTHMA IS ONE OF THE MOST COMMON LONG-TERM DISEASES OF CHILDREN. ADDITIONALLY, IT AFFECTS 15.7 MILLION NON-INSTITUTIONALIZED ADULTS NATIONWIDE. SYMPTOMS CAN INCLUDE TIGHTNESS IN THE CHEST, COUGHING, AND WHEEZING. THESE SYMPTOMS ARE OFTEN BROUGHT ON BY EXPOSURE TO INHALED ALLERGENS (DUST, POLLEN, CIGARETTE SMOKE, ANIMAL DANDER, ETC.). AN ASTHMA ATTACK CAN ALSO BE BROUGHT ON BY EXERTION AND STRESS. THERE IS NO CURE FOR ASTHMA BUT, FOR MOST PEOPLE, THE SYMPTOMS CAN BE MANAGED THROUGH A COMBINATION OF LONGER-ACTING MEDICATIONS FOR PREVENTATIVE MAINTENANCE AND SHORT-TERM RESCUE INHALERS FOR ACUTE ATTACKS. IN SOME CASES, HOWEVER, ASTHMA SYMPTOMS ARE SEVERE ENOUGH TO WARRANT HOSPITALIZATION, AND THE DISEASE CAN EVEN RESULT IN DEATH (HEALTHY COMMUNITIES INSTITUTE (HCI), 2016). TRINITY HOSPITALS GOAL IS TO DECREASE THE AGE-ADJUSTED EMERGENCY ROOM/HOSPITALIZATION RATE DUE TO ADULT ASTHMA IN PRIMARY SERVICE AREA (PSA) COMMUNITIES: 60617 AND 60619. THE KEY STRATEGY WILL BE TO EXPAND THE COMMUNITY HEALTH WORKER PROGRAM TO ENGAGE PATIENTS AND CONDUCT HOME VISTS TO IDENTIFY TRIGGERS AND BARRIERS TO ASTHMA MANAGEMENT. TRINITY HOSPITAL WILL PARTNER WITH THE METROPOLITAN TENANTS ORGANIZATION TO DELIVER THE HEALTHY HOMES INITIATIVE TO COMMUNITY MEMBERS. THE HEALTHY HOMES INITIATIVE WORKS WITH COMMUNITY MEMBERS TO REMEDIATE ANY ISSUES IN THEIR HOME THAT MAY IMPACT THEIR ASTHMA. PROGRAM RESULTS FOR 2017 WERE AS FOLLOWS: *ESTABLISHED A NEW PROCESS TO CONDUCT ASTHMA CONTROL TESTS (ACT) WITH HOSPITAL INPATIENTS AND ER PATIENTS AS PART OF THE PROJECT HEALTH PROGRAM. *25 ASTHMA CONTROL TESTS WERE PROVIDED TO TRINITY HOSPITAL ER PATIENTS AND INPATIENTS PRESENTING WITH ASTHMA SYMPTOMS. *4% OF ER PATIENTS SCORED GREATER THAN 19 ON THEIR ACT SCORE AT 3-MONTHS POST DISCHARGE AS COMPARED TO THEIR ER ACT SCORE. *A CONTRACT WITH METROPOLITAN TENANT ORGANIZATION (MTO) WAS EXCUTED IN DECEMBER 2017.

IN BRIEF, THE FOLLOWING STEPS OCCURRED DURING THE PRIORITIZATION PROCESS WITH THE CENTRAL ILLINOIS COMMUNITY HEALTH COLLABORATIVE. *DATA WAS PRESENTED FOR HEALTH CONCERNS FOR THE TRI-COUNTY REGION *DISCUSSION OCCURRED REGARDING THE ISSUES AND POTENTIAL GROUPING OF ISSUES *THE PEARL TEST WAS APPLIED FROM THE HANLON METHOD *THE COLLABORATIVE COUNCIL VOTED TO NARROW ISSUES *THE COLLABORATIVE COUNCIL VOTED A SECOND TIME BASED ON MAGNITUDE, SEVERITY AND ABILITY TO IMPACT THROUGH COLLABORATION *CONSENSUS WAS AGREED UPON FOR TWO HEALTH PRIORITIES FOR THE TRI-COUNTY REGION THE TWO NEEDS IDENTIFIED DURING THE PRIORITIZATION PROCESS ARE: *HEALTHY EATING/ACTIVE LIVING; AND *MENTAL HEALTH HEALTH NEED SELECTED MENTAL HEALTH THE COMMUNITY HEALTH NEEDS ASSESSMENT TEAM AT ADVOCATE EUREKA HOSPITAL SELECTED MENTAL HEALTH AS A HEALTH PRIORITY FOR SEVERAL REASONS. IN ADDITION TO MENTAL HEALTH BEING IDENTIFIED AS A TOP HEALTH PRIORITY FOR THE CENTRAL ILLINOIS COMMUNITY HEALTH COLLABORATIVE, BEHAVIORAL HEALTH WAS ALSO IDENTIFIED AS ONE OF THREE HEALTH PRIORITIES FOR THE TRI-COUNTY HEALTH DEPARTMENT COLLABORATION. THE HEALTH DEPARTMENTS UTILIZED THE MOBILIZING FOR ACTION THROUGH PLANNING AND PARTNERSHIPS (MAPP) PROCESS TO DETERMINE THE HEALTH PRIORITIES. SPECIFIC TO WOODFORD COUNTY, ON DECEMBER 3, 2015, SEVERAL STAFF MEMBERS FROM ADVOCATE EUREKA HOSPITAL, INCLUDING THE ADMINISTRATOR OF ADVOCATE EUREKA HOSPITAL, PARTICIPATED IN THE LOCAL FORCES OF CHANGE ASSESSMENT CONDUCTED BY THE WOODFORD COUNTY HEALTH DEPARTMENT AS A PART OF THE TRI-COUNTY MAPP PROCESS. MENTAL HEALTH WAS IDENTIFIED AS ONE OF THE TOP THREE FORCES OF CHANGE BY THE 30 INDIVIDUALS THAT PARTICIPATED IN THE ASSESSMENT. FORCES OF CHANGE ARE DEFINED AS THOSE THINGS THAT INFLUENCE THE HEALTH AND QUALITY OF LIFE FOR WOODFORD COUNTY RESIDENTS. A SECOND REASON MENTAL HEALTH WAS SELECTED AS A KEY HEALTH PRIORITY IS THAT WOODFORD COUNTY RESIDENTS THAT PARTICIPATED IN THE 2016 TRI-COUNTY COMMUNITY HEALTH SURVEY PERCEIVED MENTAL HEALTH AS THE SECOND MOST IMPORTANT HEALTH ISSUE IN THE COMMUNITY. IN ADDITION TO THE ABOVE SURVEY DATA AND LOCAL FORCES OF CHANGE ASSESSMENT RESULTS, THE NUMBER OF SUICIDE ATTEMPTS IN WOODFORD COUNTY FOR THE FIRST HALF OF 2016 HAS EXCEEDED THE NUMBER OF ATTEMPTS FOR THE ENTIRE YEAR IN BOTH 2014 AND 2015. THE NUMBER OF DEATHS DUE TO SUICIDE ALSO INCREASED FROM 2014-2015. AS STATED ABOVE, MENTAL HEALTH WAS ALSO PREVIOUSLY SELECTED AS A KEY HEALTH PRIORITY FOR THE 2011-2013 COMMUNITY HEALTH NEEDS ASSESSMENT BY BOTH EUREKA HOSPITAL AND THE WOODFORD COUNTY HEALTH DEPARTMENT. IT IS CLEAR FROM COMMUNITY INPUT AND CURRENT DATA THAT CONTINUED EFFORTS ARE NEEDED TO REDUCE THE STIGMA ASSOCIATED WITH MENTAL HEALTH AND GIVE FURTHER MOMENTUM TO THE EFFORTS OF IMPROVING MENTAL HEALTH FOR COUNTY RESIDENTS. HIGHLIGHTS FOR STEPS TAKEN IN 2017 TO ADDRESS MENTAL HEALTH ARE LISTED BELOW: *THREE MENTAL HEALTH FIRST AID (MHFA) COURSES WERE HOSTED AT ADVOCATE EUREKA HOSPITAL. *THE ADVOCATE EUREKA HOSPITAL MHFA INSTRUCTOR: *RECEIVED ADDITIONAL MHFA CERTIFICATIONS IN OLDER ADULTS AND HIGHER EDUCATION *TAUGHT TWO SESSIONS ON DEPRESSION AND ANXIETY FOR FRESHMAN FROM EUREKA HIGH SCHOOL AT EUREKA COLLEGE *TAUGHT A MHFA COURSE TO 21 RESIDENTIAL ASSISTANTS AT EUREKA COLLEGE *SERVED AS A MEMBER OF THE TRI-COUNTY BEHAVIORAL HEALTH IMPLEMENTATION PLAN SUBCOMMITTEE *ONE HUNDRED AND SIXTEEN COUNSELING AND PSYCHIATRIC SERVICES WERE OFFERED ON-SITE AT EUREKA HOSPITAL. THE SERVICES WERE PROVIDED BY THE TAZWOOD CENTER FOR WELLNESS AT THE HOSPITAL AND ALLOWED RESIDENTS TO RECEIVE CARE LOCALLY VERSUS TRAVELING OUTSIDE OF THE COUNTY FOR CARE. *TELEPSYCHIATRY CONSULTS WERE AVAILABLE AT ADVOCATE EUREKA HOSPITAL BEGINNING IN AUGUST 2017, THUS EXPANDING ACCESS TO PSYCHIATRIC CARE. HEALTH NEED NOT SELECTED HEALTHY BEHAVIORS ADVOCATE EUREKA HOSPITAL DID NOT SELECT HEALTHY BEHAVIORS AS A PRIORITY HEALTH NEED FOR THE HOSPITALS 2014-2016 COMMUNITY HEALTH NEEDS ASSESSMENT. THE HOSPITAL COMMUNITY HEALTH NEEDS ASSESSMENT TEAM WANTED TO FOCUS ITS EFFORTS ON ONE MAJOR INITIATIVE AS ITS RESOURCES ARE LIMITED AS A CRITICAL ACCESS HOSPITAL. THE HOSPITAL WILL, HOWEVER, CONTINUE TO SUPPORT THE EFFORTS OF THE TRI-COUNTY HEALTHY EATING/ACTIVE LIVING IMPLEMENTATION SUBCOMMITTEE. A STAFF MEMBER FROM THE HOSPITAL HAS SERVED ON THIS COMMITTEE TO ASSIST IN PROMOTING HEALTHY EATING AND ACTIVE LIVING IN THE TRI-COUNTY REGION. THE HOSPITAL ALSO EMPLOYS NURSES IN MOST OF THE PUBLIC SCHOOLS IN WOODFORD COUNTY WHO CAN REINFORCE HEALTHIER EATING HABITS AND INCREASED EXERCISE AMONG STUDENTS.

The 2017-2022 Vermilion County Community Health Plan (IPLAN) was accomplished with direct contribution from the Vermilion County Health Department, the Executive Committee, the Regional Community Health Plan Coordinator and over 50 individuals representing a variety of agencies and organizations (see list of Executive Committee Members and Community Advisory Committee Members) from across the county. In addition, we received direct input from over 1500 county residents via a community survey. Development of this plan was truly a collaborative effort working with our community partners, our local schools of nursing, our local and state government representatives, and input from our county residents. In 2015, the Vermilion County Board of Health asked the Vermilion County Health Department to develop a 5-year strategic plan (IPLAN) to identify the challenges facing the health department and to capitalize on its strengths and opportunities. The Board of Health seeks to ensure ongoing viability and sustainability for the health department as the health department continues to serve the critical needs of the residents of Vermilion County. The overall 5-year strategic plan was approved by the Board of Health on November 10th, 2015 and the plan itself was completed in late 2017. One of the outcomes of the IPLAN was the Presence United Samaritans Medical Center CHNA, approved in December 2017. The community phase of the process began during the summer of 2016, as staff worked to compile relevant data for the Executive Committee and the Community Advisory Committee to review during its assessment of needs. The Vermilion County Health Department and the Regional Community Health Plan Coordinator worked collaboratively with a Presence Intern in researching and compiling much of the data used. An array of representative community leaders were identified and invited to join in the IPLAN process. The community partner phase of the IPLAN began in January 2017. The community advisory committee invested a great deal of thought and effort into identifying the priority areas. In the past we have only addressed three priority areas. The community advisory committee demonstrated a genuine concern to weigh and balance all the information provided including the data presented, their own beliefs, experiences and perceptions as community stakeholders, as well as the information obtained from our county residents. The committee expressed considerable concern about how we, as a community, can address many of the health issues as the state fiscal crisis continues and funding sources diminish. There was extended dialogue about how much our challenges are interrelated with many of the contributing factors being the same for all priority areas including education, abuse, and a lack of hope and dreams of a future. The community advisory committee discussed strategies about being proactive in our approaches and ensuring action and a way to measure those actions. After discussion from the first meeting, the group consensus was reached that we were not finished with the current priorities and still had a lot of work to accomplish them, so group decided to maintain the current priorities, but wanted to add a fourth priority, mental health. As the planning process moved forward, we addressed each priority by setting attainable goals with measurable outcomes throughout the 2017-2022 Plan."

IN 2016, THE WILL COUNTY MAPP COLLABORATIVE CONVENED TO CONDUCT THE THIRD ITERATION OF THE MAPP PROCESS. MAPP IS A COMMUNITY-DRIVEN, STRATEGIC PLANNING FRAMEWORK THAT ASSISTS COMMUNITIES IN DEVELOPING AND IMPLEMENTING EFFORTS AROUND THE PRIORITIZATION OF PUBLIC HEALTH ISSUES AND THE IDENTIFICATION OF RESOURCES TO ADDRESS THEM, AS DEFINED BY THE 10 ESSENTIAL PUBLIC HEALTH SERVICES. THE MAPP PROCESS HAS SIX PHASES WHICH INCLUDE FOUR ASSESSMENTS. COMMUNITY HEALTH STATUS ASSESSMENT THE COMMUNITY HEALTH STATUS ASSESSMENT (CHSA) IS ONE OF FOUR ASSESSMENTS CONDUCTED AS A PART OF THE MAPP PROCESS. DURING THIS ASSESSMENT, INFORMATION REGARDING DEMOGRAPHICS, HEALTH STATUS, HEALTH BEHAVIORS, AND SOCIAL DETERMINANTS IN THE COMMUNITY IS GATHERED AND ANALYZED. DATA IS COLLECTED FROM A VARIETY OF RESOURCES AND ANALYZED COMPARING LOCAL, STATE, AND NATIONAL BENCHMARKS WHEN AVAILABLE. THE CHSA WAS CONDUCTED MAY - NOVEMBER 2016. COMMUNITY THEMES AND STRENGTHS ASSESSMENT THE COMMUNITY THEMES AND STRENGTHS ASSESSMENT (CTSA) AIMS TO GATHER COMMUNITY MEMBERS' PERCEPTIONS, THOUGHTS, OPINIONS, AND CONCERNS REGARDING QUALITY OF LIFE IN WILL COUNTY. THIS INPUT PROVIDES VALUABLE INSIGHT INTO THE ISSUES OF IMPORTANCE TO THE COMMUNITY. THE CTSA WAS CONDUCTED DECEMBER 2016 - MARCH 2017. FORCES OF CHANGE ASSESSMENT THE FORCES OF CHANGE ASSESSMENT (FOCA) AIMS TO IDENTIFY ALL THE FORCES AND ASSOCIATED OPPORTUNITIES AND THREATS THAT CAN AFFECT, EITHER NOW OR IN THE FUTURE, THE LOCAL PUBLIC HEALTH SYSTEM. FORCES MAY BE SOCIAL, ECONOMIC, POLITICAL, TECHNOLOGICAL, ENVIRONMENTAL, SCIENTIFIC, LEGAL, AND/OR ETHICAL IN NATURE. FORCES CAN BE TRENDS, FACTORS, OR EVENTS. THE FOCA WAS CONDUCTED SEPTEMBER - DECEMBER 2016. LOCAL PUBLIC HEALTH SYSTEM ASSESSMENT THE LOCAL PUBLIC HEALTH SYSTEM ASSESSMENT (LPHSA) WAS CONDUCTED ON DECEMBER 1, 2016. THE LPHSA IS USED TO UNDERSTAND THE OVERALL STRENGTHS AND WEAKNESSES OF THE PUBLIC HEALTH SYSTEM BASED ON THE 10 ESSENTIAL PUBLIC HEALTH SERVICES. THE WILL COUNTY MAPP COLLABORATIVE WAS FORMED FOLLOWING THE COMPLETION OF THE MAPP PROJECT IN 2011. THE SECOND ITERATION OF THE MAPP PROCESS BEGAN IN SEPTEMBER 2012 AND WAS COMPLETED IN MAY 2014. THE THIRD ROUND OF THE MAPP PROCESS BEGAN IN JANUARY 2016. THE MAPP EXECUTIVE COMMITTEE MEETS BI-MONTHLY TO PROVIDE OVERSIGHT TO THE ONGOING MAPP PROCESS AND MAKE RECOMMENDATIONS TO THE OVERALL OPERATIONS OF THE MAPP COLLABORATIVE. A PROGRAM COORDINATOR WAS APPOINTED IN MARCH 2013. THE COORDINATOR IS A FULL-TIME STAFF MEMBER OF THE WILL COUNTY HEALTH DEPARTMENT, WITH PARTIAL FUNDING BY THE WILL COUNTY MAPP COLLABORATIVE. ACTION TEAMS WERE ESTABLISHED AROUND THE IDENTIFIED PRIORITIES AND HAVE BEEN IMPLEMENTING ACTION PLANS AND STRATEGIES TO ADDRESS THOSE NEEDS. THE ACTION TEAMS ARE LED BY CHAIRS AND CO-CHAIRS FROM PARTNER ORGANIZATIONS. MOST OF THE TEAMS MEET MONTHLY OR BI-MONTHLY AS NEEDED. ORGANIZATIONS INVOLVED IN THE MAPP EXECUTIVE COMMITTEE ARE LISTED BELOW. * AMITA HEALTH ADVENTIST MEDICAL CENTER BOLINGBROOK * AUNT MARTHA'S YOUTH SERVICES * CATHOLIC CHARITIES * CHESTNUT HEALTH SYSTEMS * EASTERSEALS JOLIET REGION, INC. * EDWARD HOSPITAL * GOVERNORS STATE UNIVERSITY * NEW LIFE CHURCH * PRESENCE SAINT JOSEPH MEDICAL CENTER * SENIOR SERVICES OF WILL COUNTY * SILVER CROSS HOSPITAL * STEPPING STONES, INC. * UNITED WAY OF WILL COUNTY * WILL COUNTY COMMUNITY HEALTH CENTER * WILL COUNTY EXECUTIVE'S OFFICE * WILL COUNTY HEALTH DEPARTMENT * WILL-GRUNDY MEDICAL CLINIC PRIORITIZATION OF STRATEGIC ISSUES ON APRIL 7, 2017, FORTY-ONE WILL COUNTY PUBLIC HEALTH STAKEHOLDERS PARTICIPATED IN A PLANNING SESSION AT PRESENCE SAINT JOSEPH MEDICAL CENTER TO REVIEW KEY FINDINGS FROM THE FOUR MAPP ASSESSMENTS, IDENTIFY CROSS-CUTTING THEMES AND POTENTIAL STRATEGIC ISSUES, AND PRIORITIZE A SET OF STRATEGIC ISSUES. THE MEETING WAS FACILITATED BY THE ILLINOIS PUBLIC HEALTH INSTITUTE. ATTENDEES IDENTIFIED FIVE POTENTIAL STRATEGIC ISSUES BUT COULD NOT COME TO CONSENSUS. IN MAY OF 2017, MAPP EXECUTIVE COMMITTEE MEMBERS WERE ASKED TO USE A PRIORITIZATION CRITERIA AND PLANNING WORKSHEET DURING THE DISCUSSION OF THE PREVIOUSLY IDENTIFIED STRATEGIC ISSUES. ALL ATTENDEES AGREED THAT TRANSPORTATION IS A CONCERN, BUT THAT IT COULD BE NESTED UNDER ALL STRATEGIC ISSUES AND BECOME A GOAL OF THE MAPP EXECUTIVE COMMITTEE. ACCESS TO HEALTHY LIFESTYLE CHOICES WOULD ALSO BE NESTED IN ALL ISSUES AS A STRATEGY. MAPP EXECUTIVE COMMITTEE MEMBERS DECIDED THAT BEHAVIORAL HEALTH, ACCESS TO DENTAL AND PRIMARY CARE, AND CHRONIC DISEASE WOULD BE THE TOP THREE STRATEGIC ISSUES FOR THE NEXT THREE YEARS."

On May 10th, 2018, the Kane County Health Department and the collaborating hospital partners convened a group of community stakeholders (representing a cross-section of community-based agencies and organizations) to evaluate, discuss and prioritize health issues for community, based on findings of this Community Health Needs Assessment (CHNA). Professional Research Consultants, Inc. (PRC) began the meeting with a presentation of key findings from the CHNA, highlighting the significant health issues identified from the research (see Areas of Opportunity above). Following the data review, PRC answered any questions and facilitated a group dialogue, allowing participants to advocate for any of the health issues discussed. Afterward, participants were provided an overview of the prioritization exercise that followed. To solicit input from key informants, those individuals who have a broad interest in the health of the community, an Online Key Informant Survey also was implemented as part of this process. A list of recommended participants was provided by Kane County Health Department and collaborating partner organizations; this list included names and contact information for physicians, public health representatives, other health professionals, social service providers, and a variety of other community leaders. Potential participants were chosen because of their ability to identify primary concerns of the populations with whom they work, as well as of the community overall. Key informants were contacted by email, introducing the purpose of the survey and providing a link to take the survey online; reminder emails were sent as needed to increase participation. In all, 157 community stakeholders took part in the Online Key Informant Survey. Presence Mercy Medical Center will use the information from this Community Health Needs Assessment to develop an Implementation Strategy to address the significant health needs in the community. While the hospital will likely not implement strategies for all of the health issues listed above, the results of this prioritization exercise will be used to inform the development of the hospital's action plan to guide community health improvement efforts in the coming years."

Key informants were contacted by email, introducing the purpose of the survey and providing a link to take the survey online; reminder emails were sent as needed to increase participation. In all, 157 community stakeholders took part in the Online Key Informant Survey. Presence Saint Joseph Hospital will use the information from this Community Health Needs Assessment to develop an Implementation Strategy to address the significant health needs in the community. While the hospital will likely not implement strategies for all of the health issues listed above, the results of this prioritization exercise will be used to inform the development of the hospital's action plan to guide community health improvement efforts in the coming years."

SFMC TRENTON HAS IMPLEMENTED PROGRAMS AND STRATEGIES RELATED TO THE ESTABLISHED GOALS AND OBJECTIVES OF THE CHIP PLAN. IT HAS AN ACTIVE ROLE IN THREE OUT OF THE FIVE CHNA PRIORITY AREAS WHICH INCLUDE THE FOLLOWING: CHRONIC DISEASE AND OBESITY, AND HEALTH LITERACY AND DISPARITIES. COMMUNITY FORUM INPUT CONFIRMED THAT THE PRIORITIES IDENTIFIED IN 2013 CONTINUE TO BE CONCERNS FOR THE COMMUNITY. A NUMBER OF ADDITIONAL ISSUES WERE RAISED, WHICH SFMC IS NOT ADDRESSING DUE TO FINANCIAL RESTRICTIONS AND THE ABILITY OF OTHER AGENCIES TO ADDRESS THE SAME ISSUES. THE HOSPITAL WILL CONTINUE TO ACKNOWLEDGE THE IMPACT OF THESE ISSUES WHILE IT FOCUSES ON THE EMERGING PRIORITIES IDENTIFIED BY QUANTITATIVE DATA AND COMMUNITY ENGAGEMENT EFFORTS.CHRONIC DISEASE AND OBESITY IN 2017-18, THE SFMC DSRIP PROGRAM SCREENED 6,272 PATIENTS FROM REFERRAL SOURCES, WHICH REFLECTS AN INCREASE OF 75%. DIABETIC EDUCATION WAS PROVIDED TO 585 IN-PATIENT CONSULTS, 7 IN-PATIENT ED CONSULTS AND 30 CLINIC CONSULTATIONS.

IN ORDER TO ADDRESS THIS CONCERN, SFMC PARTNERED WITH A LOCAL FARMER TO BRING FRESH FRUITS AND VEGETABLES TO OUR HOSPITAL EMPLOYEES AND TO THE COMMUNITY BY ESTABLISHING A FARMERS MARKET ON CAMPUS. THE MARKET ACCEPTED ALL STATE AND FEDERAL ASSISTANCE PROGRAMS INCLUDING SNAP, WIC, FMNP AND SENIOR VOUCHERS. THIS MARKET WAS HELD ON A WEEKLY BASIS AND WAS EXTREMELY WELL-RECEIVED BY OUR EMPLOYEES AND OUR COMMUNITY.SFMC TRENTON IS ALSO PARTNERING WITH THE THT TO TRANSFORM OUR LOCAL CORNER STORES INTO HEALTHY CORNER STORES BY OFFERING FRESH PRODUCE AND OTHER HEALTHY OPTIONS TO COMMUNITY MEMBERS. IN 2017-2018, WORKING WITH THT, THE FOOD TRUST AND THE NJ PARTNERSHIP FOR HEALTHY KIDS, THE LUCKY STAR DELI, LOCATED IN THE CITY OF TRENTON, PARTICIPATED IN THE HEALTHY CORNER STORE NETWORK. ONCE A MONTH HEART SMARTS BROUGHT NUTRITION LESSONS TO THE DELI. CUSTOMERS LEARNED ABOUT SELECTING HEALTHY FOODS SUCH AS HEART HEALTHY WHOLE GRAINS AND TASTED RECIPES MADE FROM HEALTHY PRODUCTS AVAILABLE IN THE STORE. FOLLOWING A BLOOD PRESSURE SCREENING BY A SFMC TRENTON NURSE, EACH PARTICIPANT RECEIVED FOUR HEART BUCKS (EACH $1) TO REDEEM FOR ANY HEART HEALTHY ITEMS IN THE STORE AS WELL AS OTHER INCENTIVES AND INFORMATION TO ENCOURAGE HEALTHY EATING. CHRONIC DISEASE: PREVENTING AND DISCOURAGING SMOKINGSTATISTICS HAVE SHOWN THAT SMOKING IS THE LEADING CAUSE OF PREVENTABLE DEATH. IN ADDITION, 95% OF ADULT SMOKERS BEGIN BEFORE THE AGE OF 21. SFMC TRENTON, WORKING IN CONJUNCTION WITH THT, DEVELOPED AN ACTION PLAN TO ENACT REGULATIONS TO CONTROL TOBACCO USE IN THE TRENTON COMMUNITY BY RAISING THE MINIMUM AGE FOR PURCHASE AND SALE OF TOBACCO PRODUCTS AND ELECTRONIC SMOKING DEVICES FROM 19 TO 21 YEARS OF AGE. THE LEGISLATION WAS ENDORSED BY SFMC TRENTON AND THT AS WELL AS A COALITION OF OTHER ORGANIZATIONS, INCLUDING THE HUNTERDON MERCER REGIONAL TOBACCO COLLABORATIVE, THE NEW JERSEY QUIT LINE, MOMS QUIT CONNECTION, TOBACCO-FREE FOR A HEALTHY NEW JERSEY, OUR CONCERNED PASTORS ORGANIZATION AND OUR HOSPITAL EMPLOYEES. SFMC TRENTON ALSO WORKED EXTENSIVELY WITH THE TRINITY HEALTH SYSTEM, OUR PARENT ORGANIZATION, TO PROVIDE THE EXTENSIVE MEDIA AND EDUCATIONAL INFORMATION NECESSARY TO INFORM OUR CITY COUNCIL AND OUR COMMUNITY OF THE IMPORTANCE OF THIS BILL.THIS ACTIVE COALITION WAS ABLE TO BUILD COMMUNITY SUPPORT THROUGH THIS MEDIA CAMPAIGN AND EDUCATIONAL EFFORTS REGARDING THE HAZARDS OF TOBACCO USE, ESPECIALLY ITS IMPACT ON YOUNG PEOPLE. IN FEBRUARY OF 2017, THE CITY OF TRENTON PASSED THE TOBACCO 21 LEGISLATION, BECOMING THE 22ND CITY IN THE STATE OF NEW JERSEY TO ENACT TOBACCO 21. IN JULY OF 2017, TOBACCO 21, NJ S359 (16R), WAS SIGNED INTO LAW BY THE GOVERNOR, GOV. CHRIS CHRISTIE. THIS BILL RAISED THE LEGAL AGE TO BUY AND SELL TOBACCO PRODUCTS, INCLUDING E-CIGARETTES, FROM 19 TO 21 YEARS OLD.

ACCORDING TO THE DELAWARE HEALTH TRACKER, INACCURATE DATA ON THE POPULATION AT RISK IN SMALL GEOGRAPHIC AREAS CONTINUES TO COMPLICATE EPIDEMIOLOGIC STUDIES IN COMMUNITY SETTINGS. CENSUS DATA ARE LESS ACCURATE FOR CITIES OR COUNTIES THAN FOR STATES. THEREFORE, AN IDEAL APPROACH INCORPORATES BOTH PRIMARY AND SECONDARY DATA. IN ORDER TO FULLY INCORPORATE THE PRIMARY DATA ELEMENTS, THE CHNA TEAM CONDUCTED FOCUS GROUPS, TOWN HALL MEETINGS, STAKEHOLDER INTERVIEWS, AND ONLINE SURVEYS. BY GATHERING INFORMATION FROM LOCAL RESIDENTS AND AREA ORGANIZATIONS, THE ORGANIZATION HOPES TO GAIN A BETTER INSIGHT TO THE PRIORITY NEEDS OF THOSE LIVING IN THE SERVICE AREA. ADDITIONAL DATA WAS ALSO COLLECTED THROUGH COMPLETION OF A COMMUNITY HEALTH SURVEY BY AREA RESIDENTS, COMMUNITY BASED ORGANIZATIONS AND HEALTH CARE PROVIDERS. IN 2015, WITH THE HELP OF THE DELAWARE DIVISION OF SOCIAL SERVICES MOBILE CRISIS UNIT, A PORTION OF THE SUSSEX COUNTY HOMELESS POPULATION WAS SURVEYED AT THE LOCAL HOMELESS SHELTERS.

STAFF ALSO CONDUCTED A COMMUNITY ASSETS AND RESOURCE ANALYSIS, WHICH WAS INCLUDED IN THE OVERALL ASSESSMENT AND RATIONALE FOR PRIORITIZED COMMUNITY NEEDS.

KEY DATA SOURCES IN THE CHNA INCLUDED: CHNA PLANNING: A SERIES OF PLANNING MEETINGS WAS FACILITATED BY TRIPP UMBACH AND THE CHNA OVERSIGHT COMMITTEE, CONSISTING OF REPRESENTATIVES FROM CMC AND OTHER PARTICIPATING HOSPITALS AND ORGANIZATIONS (I.E., GEISINGER MEDICAL CENTER, GEISINGER HEALTHSOUTH REHABILITATION HOSPITAL, GEISINGER COMMUNITY MEDICAL CENTER, GEISINGER LEWISTOWN HOSPITAL, GEISINGER BLOOMSBURG HOSPITAL AND EVANGELICAL COMMUNITY HOSPITAL.) SECONDARY DATA: THE HEALTH OF THE COMMUNITY IS LARGELY RELATED TO THE CHARACTERISTICS OF ITS RESIDENTS. AN INDIVIDUAL'S AGE, RACE, GENDER, EDUCATION AND ETHNICITY OFTEN DIRECTLY OR INDIRECTLY IMPACT HEALTH STATUS AND ACCESS TO CARE. TRIPP UMBACH COMPLETED COMPREHENSIVE ANALYSIS OF HEALTH STATUS AND SOCIO-ECONOMIC FACTORS RELATED TO THE HEALTH OF THE COMMUNITY RESIDENTS FROM EXISTING DATA SOURCES SUCH AS, STATE AND COUNTY PUBLIC HEALTH AGENCIES, THE CENTERS FOR DISEASE CONTROL AND PREVENTION, COUNTY HEALTH RANKINGS, THOMPSON REUTERS, CNI, HEALTHY PEOPLE 2020 AND OTHER DATA SOURCES. TRENDING FROM 2012 CHNA: IN 2012, CMC CONTRACTED WITH TRIPP UMBACH TO COMPLETE A CHNA FOR THE SAME SERVICE AREA, (LACKAWANNA, LUZERNE AND WAYNE COUNTIES.) THE DATA SOURCES USED WERE NOT THE SAME DATA SOURCES USED IN THE 2012 CHNA. HOWEVER, TRIPP UMBACH USED DATA FOR THE SAME YEARS WHICH MADE IT POSSIBLE TO REVIEW TRENDS AND CHANGES ACROSS THE HOSPITAL SERVICE AREA. DATA AND FINDINGS FROM THE PREVIOUS CHNA WERE CONSIDERED AND CARRIED OVER TO THIS CHNA WHEN APPLICABLE. THERE WERE SEVERAL DATA SOURCES WITH CHANGES IN THE DEFINITION OF SPECIFIC INDICATORS, WHICH RESTRICTED THE USE OF TRENDING IN SEVERAL CASES. THE FACTORS THAT COULD NOT BE TRENDED ARE CLEARLY DEFINED IN THE SECONDARY DATA. INTERVIEWS WITH KEY STAKEHOLDERS: TRIPP UMBACH WORKED CLOSELY WITH THE COLLABORATING ORGANIZATIONS TO IDENTIFY LEADERS FROM ORGANIZATIONS THAT 1) HAD PUBLIC HEALTH EXPERTISE, 2)WERE PROFESSIONALS WITH ACCESS TO HEALTH- RELATED DATA AND 3) WERE REPRESENTATIVES OF UNDERSERVED POPULATIONS (I.E., CHILDREN, SENIORS, LOW-INCOME RESIDENTS, HOMELESS, DISABLED AND RESIDENTS THAT OF THE LATINO(A), AND RESIDENTS THAT WERE UNINSURED). A SERIES OF 17 INTERVIEWS WERE COMPLETED WITH KEY STAKEHOLDERS IN THE COMMUNITY, INCLUDING: ADVOCACY ALLIANCE, ALLIED SERVICES FOUNDATION, CATHOLIC SOCIAL SERVICES, GEISINGER FAMILY, LACKAWANNA COUNTY MEDICAL SOCIETY, NORTHEAST PENNSYLVANIA HEALTHCARE FOUNDATION, NORTHEAST PENNSYLVANIA INITIATIVE, PANUSKA COLLEGE FOR PROFESSIONAL STUDIES PA OFFICE OF RURAL HEALTH, PA DEPARTMENT OF HEALTH-NORTHEAST DIVISION, REHABILITATION COMMUNITY PROVIDER ASSOCIATION, SCRANTON CHAMBER OF COMMERCE, SCRANTON SCHOOL DISTRICT, SENIOR CENTERS, THE WRIGHT CENTER, UNITED NEIGHBORHOOD CENTERS, UNITED WAYS OF WYOMING VALLEY, LACKAWANNA AND WAYNE COUNTIES, VOLUNTEERS IN MEDICINE FREE CLINIC AND WILKES-BARRE CITY HEALTH DEPARTMENT. SURVEY OF VULNERABLE POPULATIONS: TRIPP UMBACH WORKED CLOSELY WITH THE CHNA OVERSIGHT COMMITTEE TO ENSURE THAT COMMUNITY MEMBERS, INCLUDING UNDERREPRESENTED RESIDENTS, WERE INCLUDED IN THE NEEDS ASSESSMENT THROUGH A SURVEY PROCESS. A TOTAL OF 266 SURVEYS WERE COLLECTED IN THE CMC SERVICE AREA. TRIPP UMBACH WORKED WITH THE OVERSIGHT COMMITTEE TO DESIGN A 33- QUESTION HEALTH STATUS SURVEY. THE SURVEY WAS ADMINISTERED BY COMMUNITY BASED ORGANIZATIONS (I.E., THE VOLUNTEERS IN MEDICINE FREE CLINIC, THE DENTAL HEALTH CLINIC, THE UNITED WAY OF WYOMING VALLEY, WAYNE COUNTY CAREERLINK, NHS HUMAN SERVICES, THE EDWARD R. LEAHY JR. CENTER CLINIC FOR THE UNINSURED, TREHAB, THE WRIGHT CENTER, AND LOCAL SENIOR CENTERS AND HOME HEALTH AGENCIES) PROVIDING SERVICES TO VULNERABLE POPULATIONS IN THE HOSPITAL SERVICE AREA. COMMUNITY BASED ORGANIZATIONS WERE TRAINED TO ADMINISTER THE SURVEY USING HAND-DISTRIBUTION. SURVEYS WERE ADMINISTERED ONSITE AND SECURELY MAILED TO TRIPP UMBACH FOR TABULATION AND ANALYSIS. SURVEYS WERE ANALYZED USING SPSS SOFTWARE. VULNERABLE POPULATIONS WERE IDENTIFIED BY THE CHNA OVERSIGHT COMMITTEE AND THROUGH STAKEHOLDER INTERVIEWS. VULNERABLE POPULATIONS TARGETED BY THE SURVEYS WERE SENIORS, LOW-INCOME RESIDENTS (INCLUDING FAMILIES), AND RESIDENTS THAT ARE UNDER/UNINSURED. PRIORITIZATION OF TOP COMMUNITY HEALTH NEEDS: TOP HEALTH NEEDS WERE IDENTIFIED BY COMMUNITY LEADERS DURING A REGIONAL COMMUNITY HEALTH NEEDS IDENTIFICATION FORUM HELD ON MARCH 5, 2015. CONSULTANTS PRESENTED TO COMMUNITY LEADERS THE CHNA FINDINGS FROM ANALYZING SECONDARY DATA, KEY STAKEHOLDER INTERVIEWS AND SURVEYS. COMMUNITY LEADERS DISCUSSED THE DATA PRESENTED, SHARED THEIR VISIONS AND PLANS FOR COMMUNITY HEALTH IMPROVEMENT IN THEIR COMMUNITIES, AND IDENTIFIED AND PRIORITIZED THE TOP COMMUNITY HEALTH NEEDS WITHIN THE HOSPITAL'S COMMUNITY. PUBLIC COMMENT REGARDING THE 2012 CHNA AND IMPLEMENTATION PLAN: TRIPP UMBACH SOLICITED PUBLIC COMMENTARY FROM COMMUNITY LEADERS AND RESIDENTS. COMMENTERS WERE PROVIDED ACCESS AND ASKED TO REVIEW THE CHNA AND ACTION PLAN ADOPTED FOR THE FISCAL YEAR BEGINNING JULY 1, 2013. COMMENTERS WERE THEN ASKED TO RESPOND TO A QUESTIONNAIRE WHICH PROVIDED OPEN AND CLOSED RESPONSE QUESTIONS. THE PRIOR CHNA AND IMPLEMENTATION PLAN ALONG WITH THE QUESTIONNAIRE WERE OFFERED IN HARD COPY AT TWO LOCATIONS INSIDE THE HOSPITAL AND WERE ALSO PROVIDED ELECTRONICALLY USING A WEB-BASED PLATFORM. THERE WERE NO RESTRICTIONS OR QUALIFICATIONS REQUIRED OF PUBLIC COMMENTERS. FLYERS WERE CIRCULATED AND ELECTRONIC INVITATIONS WERE MADE FOR PUBLIC COMMENT THROUGHOUT THE PROCESS WHICH LASTED FROM DECEMBER 2014 THROUGH FEBRUARY 2015. THROUGHOUT THIS DOCUMENT THE TERMS ""SYSTEM- OR ""GEISINGER"" SHALL REFER TO THE ENTIRE HEALTHCARE SYSTEM COMPRISED OF GEISINGER HEALTH (""GH"") AS PARENT AND ALL SUBSIDIARY ENTITIES COMPRISING THE SYSTEM."

201921309349300807,240862246,"FACILITY 1, COMMUNITY MEDICAL CENTER - PART V, LINE 11","BELOW ARE SYSTEM-WIDE PROGRAMS OFFERED BY GEISINGER TO FULFILL COMMUNITY NEEDS THAT WERE IDENTIFIED IN THE HOSPITAL'S 2015 CHNA. SOME PROGRAMS ARE COMPLETELY OPERATED OR FUNDED BY GEISINGER AND SOME ARE OFFERED IN COOPERATION WITH LOCAL HEALTH AND HUMAN SERVICE AGENCIES. FOR MORE SPECIFIC NEEDS FOUND IN OUR LOCAL COMMUNITIES, WE OFFER PROGRAMS TO SERVE PATIENTS CLOSE TO HOME. THE TOP THREE NEEDS IDENTIFIED IN THE MOST RECENT AND/OR PAST CHNA SURVEYS FALL INTO ONE OF THREE COMMUNITY NEED CATEGORIES: 1)IMPROVING ACCESS TO HEALTHCARE: THE MOST SIGNIFICANT NEED IDENTIFIED WAS FOR BETTER, FASTER, MORE CONVENIENT AND LESS COSTLY ACCESS TO HEALTHCARE SERVICES. GEISINGER IS TAKING INNOVATIVE STEPS TO ADDRESS BARRIERS TO HEALTHCARE AND HELP PROVIDE PHYSICAL, MENTAL, REHABILITATIVE AND PREVENTIVE SERVICES TO PATIENTS, REGARDLESS OF THEIR HEALTH INSURANCE STATUS. THE TOPICS ADDRESSED INCLUDE: HOW TO FIND THE RIGHT DOCTOR, PROVIDER OR FACILITY; SPECIAL SERVICES PROVIDED TO PATIENTS WITH SPECIFIC NEEDS (SUCH AS THE ELDERLY, UNDERINSURED OR UNINSURED); TRAUMA PREVENTION AND TREATMENT; AND MANY OTHERS. 2)ADDRESSING BEHAVIORAL HEALTH AND SUBSTANCE ABUSE: GEISINGER HAS A WIDE RANGE OF PROGRAMS TO HELP PATIENTS FIND HEALTHCARE SERVICES WHEN THEY ARE FACING BEHAVIORAL HEALTH CHALLENGES OR STRUGGLING WITH ADDICTION. ALZHEIMER'S DISEASE AND OTHER AGING BRAIN ISSUES AS WELL AS ALCOHOLISM AND OPIOID ABUSE ARE ADDRESSED IN A LARGE AND GROWING NUMBER OF PROGRAMS SPECIFICALLY AIMED AT EXPANDING SERVICES. 3)IMPROVING HEALTHY BEHAVIORS: GEISINGER HAS NUMEROUS EDUCATIONAL PROGRAMS TO HELP PATIENTS LIVE WELL. EFFORTS INCLUDE COMMUNITY AND OUTREACH PROGRAMS THAT BRING HEALTHCARE PROFESSIONALS, EDUCATION, NUTRITION AND MEDICATION TO THE PEOPLE. OUR GOAL IS TO ASSIST PATIENTS WITH THEIR HEALTH BEFORE A SERIOUS PROBLEM ARISES SENDING THEM TO THE HOSPITAL. IMPROVING ACCESS TO HEALTHCARE COMPLEX CARE, CLOSER TO HOME: CARE FOR COMPLEX CONDITIONS SUCH AS HEART, LUNG AND KIDNEY DISEASE ARE USUALLY FOUND AT LARGE HEALTH FACILITIES. LONG DRIVES TO A HOSPITAL, LACK OF TRANSPORTATION OPTIONS AND OF SPECIALISTS IN THE AREA MAKES ACCESS TO CARE DIFFICULT. OUR SPECIALISTS TRAVEL SO PATIENTS ARE PROVIDED WITH NEEDED, CONVENIENT SPECIALTY CARE, WITHOUT LONG DRIVES OR THE CHALLENGES OF SEEKING CARE ONLY AT A HOSPITAL. INSTEAD OUR SPECIALISTS TRAVEL ACROSS THE REGION TO CLINICS THAT PROVIDE ADVANCED CARE, WITH THE BENEFIT OF BETTER TRACKING OF PATIENTS WITH CHRONIC CONDITIONS. CLINICS ARE STAFFED WITH DOCTORS, NURSES AND OTHER HEALTHCARE PROFESSIONALS AND DIAGNOSTIC LAB AND IMAGING SERVICES. MANY LOCATIONS ALSO OFFER SPECIALTY PEDIATRIC AND WOMEN'S HEALTH SERVICES. OUR SPECIALISTS, INCLUDING CARDIOLOGY, DERMATOLOGY, COMPLEX ORTHOPAEDIC AND THORACIC SURGERY AND NEUROSURGERY ARE AVAILABLE IN MORE THAN 30 COMMUNITIES ACROSS NORTHEAST AND CENTRAL PA. GEISINGER HEALTH PLAN (GHP): COMPREHENSIVE COVERAGE FOR THE UNINSURED AND SENIORS: GHP, A NONPROFIT HMO, OFFERS AFFORDABLE HEALTH PLANS THAT SERVES THE MOST VULNERABLE IN OUR COMMUNITIES: UNINSURED ADULTS, CHILDREN AND SENIORS. GHP FAMILY IS A MEDICAL-ASSISTANCE, MANAGED-CARE PLAN THAT OFFERS COMPREHENSIVE COVERAGE TO UNINSURED AND UNDERINSURED RESIDENTS OF 22 COUNTIES IN PA. MANY SERVICES ARE PROVIDED AT NO COST, INCLUDING DOCTOR'S OFFICE VISITS, EMERGENCY CARE, PREVENTIVE SERVICES (INCLUDING IMMUNIZATIONS AND SCREENINGS), DIABETES CARE, MATERNITY CARE, DENTAL AND VISION SERVICES AND PRESCRIPTION DRUGS. THERE IS ALSO 24-HOUR ACCESS TO E-NURSES AND HEALTH COACHES. GHP KIDS OFFERS HEALTH COVERAGE TO UNINSURED CHILDREN UNDER 20 YEARS OF AGE IN 40 COUNTIES THROUGH PA'S CHILDREN'S HEALTH INSURANCE PROGRAM (CHIP). FOR MOST CHIP IS FREE AND INCLUDES ROUTINE CHECKUPS AND IMMUNIZATIONS, PRESCRIPTION DRUGS, VISION AND DENTAL SERVICES AND EMERGENCY CARE. FOR SENIORS, NAVIGATING THE COMPLEXITIES OF HEALTHCARE COVERAGE CAN BE OVERWHELMING. GHP OFFERS A DUAL ELIGIBILITY PLAN FOR SENIORS WHO QUALIFY FOR MEDICARE PARTS A AND B COVERAGE AS WELL AS MEDICAID. GEISINGER GOLD SECURE RX IS DESIGNED TO MAKE MEDICAL EXPENSES MORE PREDICTABLE, ALLOW BETTER COORDINATION AMONG PROVIDERS AND LOWER OUT-OF-POCKET EXPENSES FOR SENIORS. THIS PLAN OFFERS CONVENIENT BENEFITS WITH LOW OR NO PREMIUMS, A SINGLE ID CARD, PRESCRIPTION DRUG COVERAGE, DENTAL AND VISION SERVICES, FITNESS PROGRAMS AND CARE MANAGEMENT NURSES. PROVENHEALTH NAVIGATOR: IS A TEAM-ORIENTED MEDICAL HOME. A MEDICAL ""HOME"" IS A PATIENT-CENTERED MODEL OF CARE LED BY THE PATIENT'S PRIMARY DOCTOR AND A TEAM OF HEALTHCARE PROFESSIONALS WORKING TOGETHER TO ENSURE THE PROPER CARE. THE TEAM OF SPECIALISTS, CARE MANAGERS, PHARMACISTS, SOCIAL WORKERS AND COMMUNITY HEALTH ASSISTANTS WORK WITH THE PATIENT, FAMILY AND CAREGIVERS TO PLAN CARE THAT WILL PREVENT URGENT/EMERGENT CARE VISITS AND HOSPITALIZATIONS. RESEARCH HAS SHOWN THAT PATIENTS UNDER THE MEDICAL HOME MODEL ARE HEALTHIER AND SPEND LESS TIME HOSPITALIZED. MEDICAL HOME CARE FOCUSES ON FREQUENT DOCTOR VISITS AND CONSISTENT FOLLOW-UP BY THE TEAM, WHICH HAS SHOWN TO BENEFIT THOSE WITH CHRONIC ILLNESSES (DIABETES, HEART DISEASE, ETC.) MEDICAL HOME PATIENTS ALSO HAVE ACCESS TO DOCTORS AND PHN CARE MANAGERS 24/7. CARE MANAGERS HELP PATIENTS NAVIGATE THE COMPLEX HEALTHCARE SYSTEM, COORDINATING CARE AND COMMUNICATING WITH THE TEAM OF PROVIDERS. CARE MANAGERS, SOCIAL WORKERS AND COMMUNITY HEALTH ASSISTANTS ARE ALSO AVAILABLE TO HELP OUR PATIENTS ADDRESS DIFFICULT CHALLENGES, SUCH AS COPING WITH MENTAL ILLNESS, ADDICTION, ABUSE AND LOSS AND MANAGING DISABILITIES. THE TEAM ALSO COORDINATES COMMUNITY RESOURCES THAT ARE AVAILABLE AND ASSISTS THE PATIENT WITH THEIR NEEDS. BY EXPANDING OUR SUCCESSFUL MEDICAL HOME INITIATIVE, WE'RE ENSURING THAT OUR PATIENTS HAVE ACCESS TO THE MOST EFFECTIVE MODELS OF CARE. GEISINGER TELEMEDICINE BRINGS HEALTHCARE CLOSER TO HOME: IN OUR 31-COUNTY SERVICE AREA, NEARLY HALF OF OUR PATIENT POPULATION RESIDES IN RURAL AREAS, AND MORE THAN 60 PERCENT OF PATIENTS HAVE CHRONIC HEALTH CONDITIONS. OUR TELEMEDICINE PROGRAM ALLOWS PATIENTS TO STILL RECEIVE SPECIALIZED CARE LOCALLY. OUR PROGRAM USES HIGH-DEFINITION AUDIO/VIDEO TECHNOLOGY AND TOOLS SUCH AS DIGITAL STETHOSCOPES TO CONNECT REMOTE PATIENTS TO OUR HOSPITALS AND PRIMARY CARE CLINICS, AS WELL AS TO NON-GEISINGER FACILITIES. INPATIENTS ARE DIAGNOSED EARLIER, BEGIN TREATMENT SOONER AND AVOID HOSPITAL TRANSFERS, SINCE THEIR PHYSICIANS CAN CONSULT OUR SPECIALISTS ANYWHERE WITHIN OUR SYSTEM. OUR SPECIALISTS HAVE ACCESS TO PATIENTS AT CLINICS ACROSS THE STATE WITHOUT THE PATIENT TRAVELING TO A HOSPITAL TO SEE THE SPECIALIST. THIS SAVES TIME AND REDUCES TRAVEL COSTS AND ALLOWS THE SUPPORT OF LOVED ONES AT HOME. EARLIER DIAGNOSIS REDUCES COSTS FOR EVERYONE. THIS PROGRAM ALLOWS PATIENTS TO CONNECT WITH THE RIGHT SPECIALIST WHEN NEEDED. BY CONNECTING PATIENTS TO OUR SPECIALISTS, ACCESS TO HEALTHCARE IS AVAILABLE TO EVERY PATIENT IN OUR COMMUNITIES. SUPPORT FOR SENIORS AT HOME: LIFE GEISINGER (LIVING INDEPENDENTLY FOR ELDERS) HELPS SENIORS STAY AT HOME, STAY INDEPENDENT AND STAY HEALTHY. THE LIFE GEISINGER TEAM IS ON CALL 24/7, PROVIDING SUPPORT FOR SENIORS AND THEIR LOVED ONES. A PROVIDER TEAM ASSESSES PATIENTS' NEEDS, DEVELOPS CARE PLANS AND DELIVERS THE SERVICES SENIORS AND FAMILIES NEED. TRANSPORTATION SERVICES MAKE HOME DELIVERIES OF SUPPLIES AND/OR MEDICATIONS, CARRY SENIORS TO MEDICAL AND OTHER APPOINTMENTS AND DELIVER LIFE PARTICIPANTS TO AND FROM OUR ADULT DAY CENTERS FOR SCHEDULED VISITS. SENIOR DAY CENTERS OFFER SENIORS COMPREHENSIVE MEDICAL AND SOCIAL SERVICES AND OPPORTUNITIES TO SOCIALIZE AND EXERCISE. OUR ADULT DAY CENTERS ARE OPEN TO ALL SENIORS, REGARDLESS OF WHETHER THEY PARTICIPATE IN LIFE GEISINGER. HIGH-QUALITY, NON-EMERGENCY CARE: FOR PATIENTS EXPERIENCING A NON-EMERGENT INJURY OR ILLNESS, GEISINGER CAREWORKS CLINICS OFFER HIGH-QUALITY MEDICAL SERVICES AT CONVENIENT LOCATIONS THROUGHOUT PA. THESE URGENT CARE CLINICS PROVIDE ECONOMICAL AND CONVENIENT HEALTHCARE FROM HIGHLY TRAINED CERTIFIED NURSE PRACTITIONERS AND PHYSICIAN ASSISTANTS. CAREWORKS ATTENDS TO THE MEDICAL NEEDS OF ADULTS AND CHILDREN 12 MONTHS OR OLDER, AND NO APPOINTMENT IS NECESSARY. THE OFFICES COMMUNICATE WITH THE PRIMARY CARE PHYSICIAN ABOUT THE PATIENT'S VISIT. CAREWORKS KEEPS FAMILIES WELL BY INCREASING ACCESS TO OUR PROVIDERS, PROFESSIONALS AND SERVICES IN CONVENIENT COMMUNITY LOCATIONS. BRIDGING THE COMMUNICATIONS GAP: AT GEISINGER, WE SEE PATIENTS WHO HAVE DIFFERENT LEVELS OF HEARING ABILITY AND LITERACY. THEY SPEAK HUNDREDS OF LANGUAGES. TO GIVE OUR PATIENTS THE BEST EXPERIENCE POSSIBLE, WE USE ADVANCED TECHNOLOGY AND CONTINUOUS TRAINING. OUR GOAL IS TO HELP PATIENTS CLEARLY UNDERSTAND HOW BEST TO MANAGE THEIR CONDITION. STRATUS IS A VIDEO-INTERPRETING DEVICE USED FOR PATIENTS WHO ARE HEARING-IMPAIRED OR WHO HAVE LIMITED ENGLISH SKILLS. THERE ARE NOW OVER 250 STRATUS DEVICES ACROSS THE SYSTEM. AVAILABLE 24 HRS/DAY IN MORE THAN 200 LANGUAGES, INCLUDING AMERICAN SIGN LANGUAGE, STRATUS IS OPERATED BY TRAINED"

Other institutions, organizations and agencies as well as members of the Children's Hospital Community Benefit Advisory Committee also contributed time and resources to assist with this assessment.The CNM team has extensive experience through being involved in and conducting more than 30 CHNA's for hospitals throughout Los Angeles County and San Diego County. In 2013, CNM conducted CHNA's for three Kaiser Foundation Hospitals (Baldwin Park, Los Angeles and West Los Angeles), Citrus Valley Health Partners, The Glendale Hospitals Collaborative (Glendale Adventist Medical Center, Glendale Memorial Hospital and US Verdugo Hills Hospital) and the Metro Hospitals Collaborative (California Hospital Medical Center, Good Samaritan Hospital and St. Vincent Medical Center) and assisted an additional two Kaiser Foundation Hospitals (Panorama City and San Diego) in community benefit planning based on the needs assessments. More recently, the CNM team conducted the 2014 CHNA for CASA Colina Hospital and Centers for Healthcare, and for Hope Street Family Center. The CNM team has also conducted 2016 CHNAs for two Kaiser Foundation Hospitals (West Los Angeles and Baldwin Park), Citrus Valley Health Partners, The Glendale Hospitals Collaborative and The Metro Hospitals Collaborative as well as CHLA's 2016 CHNA.CHLA has conducted a Community Health Needs Assessment (CHNA) in an effort to understand the health and social needs of the community and as required by state and federal law. The CHNA is a primary tool used by the Hospital to determine its community benefit plan. This assessment incorporates components of primary data collection and secondary data analysis that focus on the health and social needs of the service area. Sources of data include the U.S. Census 2010 Decennial Census and American Community Survey, California Health Interview Survey, California Department of Public Health, California Employment Development Department, Los Angeles County Health Survey, Los Angeles Homeless Services Authority, CDC National Health Statistics, National Cancer Institute, U.S. Department of Education, and others. When pertinent, these data sets are presented in the context of California State. The 2016 Community Health Needs Assessment methodology and process involved the collection of both secondary data and primary data. Approximately 300 secondary data indicators on a variety of health, social, economic, and environmental topics were collected by zip code, service planning area (SPA), county, and state levels (as available). In addition, primary data collection included an online survey, a youth-led photovoice project and a community forum with individuals who represent the broad interests of the community served by the Hospital. Additionally, input was obtained from Los Angeles County Department of Public Health Officials. For the community forum, community stakeholders identified by key departments at Children's Hospital Los Angeles were contacted and asked to participate in the prioritization of needs process. Participants included individuals who are leaders and representatives of medically underserved, low-income, minority and chronic disease populations, or regional, state or local health or other departments or agencies that have current data or other information relevant to the health needs of the community served by the hospital facility."

THE IMPLEMENTATIN PLAN, WHICH COVERS A THREE YEAR SPAN, OUTLINES SPECIFIC STRATEGIES FOR EACH PRIORITY AREA THAT WILL BE IMPLEMENTED THROUGH A VARIETY OF METHODS INCLUDING INPUT FROM EXPERT PROVIDERS, COMMUNITY OUTREACH, AND COLLABORATIONS AND PARTNERSHIPS WITH COMMUNITY ORGANIZATIONS. AN OVERVIEW OF EACH PRIORITY FOLLOWS: OBESITY - THE LONG TERM GOALS OF THE OBESITY PRIORITY INCLUDE REDUCING THE NUMBER OF OVERWEIGHT AND OBESE BERKS COUNTY RESIDENTS, AS WELL AS CONVENING A COMMUNITY COALITION OF DIVERSE STAKEHOLDERS. TO DO THIS, READING HOSPITAL AND COMMUNITY PARTNERS PLAN TO CONDUCT AN EDUCATIONAL MARKETING CAMPAIGN FOCUSING ON THE IMPORTANCE OF MAKING HEALTH CHOICES AND HIGHLIGHTING EVIDENCE BASED PROGRAMS VIA EDUCATION, COOKING CLASSES AND DEMOS, AND COMMUNITY HEALTH SCREENINGS, PROMOTING THE IMPLEMENTATION OF WORKPLACE WELLNESS PROGRAMS IN PARTNERSHIP WITH THE GREAT READING CHAMBER OF COMMERCE, INCREASING ACCESS TO HEALTH FOOD THROUGH SUPPORT OF LOCAL FARMER'S MARKETS AND HEALTHY FOOD DRIVES, AND PROMOTING INCREASED PHYSICAL ACTIVITY AND EXERCISE THROUGH READING HOSPITAL'S FITT PROGRAM AND PROMOTION OF COMMUNITY WALKING PROGRAMS. MENTAL HEALTH - THE LONG TERM GOAL OF THE MENTAL HEALTH PRIORITY IS TO INCREASE ACCESS TO AND INTEGRATION OF MENTAL HEALTH SERVICES IN BERKS COUNTY. THIS WILL BE ACHIEVED THROUGH THE INTEGRATION OF MENTAL HEALTH SERVICES WITH PRIMARY CARE THROUGH TRAINING AND REFERRAL PROCESSES, THE IMPROVEMENT OF ACCESS TO MENTAL HEALTH SERVICES THROUGH TELEPSYCHIATRY AND WEB BASED MENTAL HEALTH THERAPIES, AND THE PARTICIPATION IN A LOCAL COALITION TO ADDRESS THE MENTAL HEALTH IN THE COMMUNITY THROUGH ANTI-STIGMA MARKETING CAMPAIGNS, SUICIDE PREVENTION TRAINING, AND EXPLORING THE POSSIBILITY OF A CRISIS RESIDENTIAL CENTER. ADDICTION - THE LONG TERM GOAL OF THE ADDICTION PRIORITY IS TO INCREASE COORDINATION AND AVAILABILITY OF SERVICES TO TREAT ADDICTION. THIS WILL BE ADDRESSED THROUGH SUPPORTING THE DEVELOPMENT OF COMMUNITY-BASED SERVICES TO REDUCE UNNECESSARY HOSPITALIZATION VIA COMMUNITY BASED CARE TEAMS TO AID IN ADDICTION RECOVERY, EXPLORING THE CREATION OF A COMMUNITY-BASED PAIN MANAGEMENT CLINIC, AND COORDINATED DISCHARGE FOR ADDICTED PATIENTS, AS WELL AS CONVENING A COMMUNITY LEARNING NETWORK WHICH WOULD HELP PROVIDE SUPPORT SERVICES TO AID IN ADDICTION RECOVERY AND COMMUNITY BASED PROGRAMS THAT PROVIDE SUPPORT WITH PATIENTS THAT HAVE A DUAL DIAGNOSIS, WHO NEED NA/AA SUPPORT GROUPS IN SPANISH, AND WHO NEED PROGRAMS THAT COMBINE MEDICATION- ASSISTED TREATMENT WITH THE TWELVE STEP APPROACH USED BY NA/AA. ACCESS TO CARE - THE LONG TERM GOAL OF THE ACCESS TO CARE PRIORITY IS TO DECREASE BARRIERS TO ACCESS QUALITY HEALTHCARE. READING HOSPITAL WILL UTILIZE GIS TECHNOLOGY TO IDENTIFY SUBPOPULATIONS WHO ARE AT RISK FOR HIGHER READMISSION RATES AND CHRONIC CONDITIONS OR DISEASES AND OVERLAY THIS WITH DATA SETS TO HELP SUPPORT PROGRAM DEVELOPMENT, PLACEMENT OF SERVICES, AND MESSAGING. THIS WILL BE ACCOMPLISHED THROUGH THE SUPPORT AND DEVELOPMENT OF PROGRAMS THAT DELIVER CARE TO VULNERABLE POPULATIONS (I.E. STREET MEDICINE, COMMUNITY PARAMEDICINE), ASSESSING NON-EMERGENT ED USE AND DEVELOPING STRATEGIES TO REDUCE THE USE OF EMERGENCY SERVICES, AND EXPANDING AND PROMOTING PROGRAMS THAT EDUCATE THE COMMUNITY ABOUT CAREERS IN HEALTHCARE. READING HOSPITAL WILL ALSO WORK TO IMPROVE THE CULTURAL COMPETENCY OF ITS STAFF THROUGH IMPLEMENTATION OF CULTURAL COMPETENCY TRAINING FOR PROVIDERS AND OTHER HEALTHCARE EMPLOYEES AND TAKING AN INVENTORY OF THE NEED FOR INTERPRETING SERVICES AT THMG PRIMARY CARE OFFICES AND IMPLEMENTING A PLAN TO PROVIDE NEEDED SERVICES. ACCESS FOR HEALTHCARE SERVICES WILL BE ADDRESSED THROUGH EXPLORING STRATEGIES TO REMOVE TRANSPORTATION BARRIERS AND THE ANALYSIS OF DATA TO MONITOR HOW LONG MEDICAID AND MEDICARE (SEPARATELY) PATIENTS WAIT TO SEE AN THMG PRIMARY CARE PHYSICIAN. LIST OF HEALTH NEEDS THE FACILITY DOES NOT PLAN TO ADDRESS: TOWER HEALTH DOES NOT INTEND TO ADDRESS DIABETES, DENTAL HEALTH, HEART DISEASE, CANCER, MATERNAL/INFANT HEALTH, TOBACCO, STDS AND STROKE. DIABETES WILL BE CATEGORIZED AS A CHRONIC DISEASE AND WILL BE ADRESSED IN THE OBESITY/OVERWEIGHT STRATEGY. DENTAL HEALTH, HEART DISEASE, CANCER, MATERNAL/INFANT HEALTH, TOBACCO, STDS AND STROKE WILL BE ADDRESSED THROUGH ONGOING HEALTH SYSTEM INITIATIVES OR IN COLLABORATION WITH ESTABLISHED AND PROVEN COMMUNITY ORGANIZATIONS."

A COMMUNITY HEALTH NEEDS ASSESSMENT WAS CONDUCTED BETWEEN OCTOBER 2014 AND MARCH 2015 THAT IDENTIFIES THE NEEDS OF THE RESIDENTS SERVED BY GLH. AS A PARTNERING HOSPITAL OF A REGIONAL COLLABORATIVE EFFORT TO ASSESS COMMUNITY HEALTH NEEDS; GLH COLLABORATED WITH HOSPITALS AND OUTSIDE ORGANIZATIONS IN THE SURROUNDING REGION (INCLUDING JUNIATA AND MIFFLIN COUNTIES) DURING THE COMMUNITY HEALTH NEEDS ASSESSMENT PROCESS. THE FOLLOWING IS A LIST OF ORGANIZATIONS THAT PARTICIPATED IN THE COMMUNITY HEALTH NEEDS ASSESSMENT PROCESS IN SOME WAY: AREA AGENCY ON AGING, JUNIATA BEHAVIORAL & DEVELOPMENTAL SERVICES, JUNIATA COUNTY COMMISSIONERS, JV TRI-COUNTY DRUG & ALCOHOL, MIFFLIN COUNTY COMMISSIONERS, MIFFLIN COUNTY INDUSTRIAL DEVELOPMENT CORPORATION, MIFFLIN-JUNIATA SPECIAL NEEDS CENTER, PA OFFICE OF RURAL HEALTH, SACRED HEART CATHOLIC SCHOOL, STATE HEALTH CENTER, AND UNITED WAY OF MIFFLIN-JUNIATA. TRIPP UMBACH, HEADQUARTERED IN PITTSBURGH, PA, IS A RECOGNIZED NATIONAL LEADER IN CONDUCTING CHNAS, HAVING CONDUCTED MORE THAN 250 CHNAS OVER THE PAST 20 YEARS, WITH MORE THAN 50 HAVING BEEN COMPLETED WITHIN THE LAST 2 YEARS. TODAY, MORE THAN 1 IN 5 AMERICANS LIVE IN A COMMUNITY WHERE TRIPP UMBACH HAS COMPLETED A CHNA. PAUL UMBACH, FOUNDER AND PRESIDENT OF TRIPP UMBACH, IS AMONG THE MOST EXPERIENCED COMMUNITY HEALTH PLANNERS IN THE NATION, HAVING DIRECTED PROJECTS IN EVERY STATE AND INTERNATIONALLY. TRIPP UMBACH HAS WRITTEN TWO NATIONAL GUIDE BOOKS ON THE TOPIC OF COMMUNITY HEALTH AND HAS PRESENTED AT MORE THAN 50 STATE AND NATIONAL HEALTH CONFERENCES. THE ADDITIONAL TRIPP UMBACH TEAM BROUGHT MORE THAN 30 YEARS OF COMBINED EXPERIENCE TO THE PROJECT. KEY DATA SOURCES IN THE CHNA INCLUDED: CHNA PLANNING: A SERIES OF PLANNING MEETINGS WAS FACILITATED BY TRIPP UMBACH AND THE CHNA OVERSIGHT COMMITTEE, CONSISTING OF REPRESENTATIVES FROM GLH AND OTHER PARTICIPATING HOSPITALS AND ORGANIZATIONS (I.E., GEISINGER MEDICAL CENTER, GEISINGER HEALTHSOUTH REHABILITATION HOSPITAL, GEISINGER WYOMING VALLEY MEDICAL CENTER, GEISINGER COMMUNITY MEDICAL CENTER, GEISINGER-LEWISTOWN HOSPITAL AND GEISINGER-BLOOMSBURG HOSPITAL.) SECONDARY DATA: THE HEALTH OF A COMMUNITY IS LARGELY RELATED TO THE CHARACTERISTICS OF ITS RESIDENTS. AN INDIVIDUAL'S AGE, RACE, GENDER, EDUCATION AND ETHNICITY OFTEN DIRECTLY OR INDIRECTLY IMPACT HEALTH STATUS AND ACCESS TO CARE. TRIPP UMBACH COMPLETED COMPREHENSIVE ANALYSIS OF HEALTH STATUS AND SOCIO-ECONOMIC ENVIRONMENTAL FACTORS RELATED TO THE HEALTH OF RESIDENTS OF THE GLH COMMUNITY FROM EXISTING DATA SOURCES SUCH AS STATE AND COUNTY PUBLIC HEALTH AGENCIES, THE CENTERS FOR DISEASE CONTROL AND PREVENTION, COUNTY HEALTH RANKINGS, THOMPSON REUTERS, CNI, HEALTHY PEOPLE 2020, AND OTHER DATA SOURCES. TRENDING FROM 2012 CHNA: IN 2012, GLH COMPLETED A CHNA FOR THE SAME COUNTIES INCLUDED IN THE SERVICE AREA (JUNIATA AND MIFFLIN COUNTIES). TRIPP UMBACH DID NOT COMPLETE THE 2012 CHNA. AS A RESULT, THE DATA SOURCES USED WERE NOT THE SAME DATA SOURCES FROM THE 2012 CHNA. HOWEVER, TRIPP UMBACH PROVIDED DATA FOR THE SAME YEARS WHICH MADE IT POSSIBLE TO REVIEW TRENDS AND CHANGES ACROSS THE HOSPITAL SERVICE AREA. WHEN POSSIBLE, FINDINGS FROM THE PREVIOUS CHNA HAVE BEEN INCLUDED IN THE EXECUTIVE SUMMARY ""KEY COMMUNITY HEALTH PRIORITIES"". THERE WERE SEVERAL DATA SOURCES WITH CHANGES IN THE DEFINITION OF SPECIFIC INDICATORS, WHICH RESTRICTED THE USE OF TRENDING IN SEVERAL CASES. THE FACTORS THAT COULD NOT BE TRENDED ARE CLEARLY DEFINED IN THE SECONDARY DATA. INTERVIEWS WITH KEY COMMUNITY STAKEHOLDERS: TRIPP UMBACH WORKED CLOSELY WITH THE COLLABORATING ORGANIZATIONS TO IDENTIFY LEADERS FROM ORGANIZATIONS THAT 1) HAD PUBLIC HEALTH EXPERTISE; 2) WERE PROFESSIONALS WITH ACCESS TO COMMUNITY HEALTH RELATED DATA; AND 3) WERE REPRESENTATIVES OF UNDERSERVED POPULATIONS (I.E., SENIORS, LOW-INCOME RESIDENTS, LATINO(A) RESIDENTS, AND RESIDENTS THAT ARE UNINSURED). SUCH PERSONS WERE INTERVIEWED AS PART OF THE NEEDS ASSESSMENT PLANNING PROCESS. A SERIES OF 20 INTERVIEWS WERE COMPLETED WITH KEY STAKEHOLDERS IN THE GLH COMMUNITY, INCLUDING: AREA AGENCY ON AGING, JUNIATA BEHAVIORAL & DEVELOPMENTAL SERVICES, JUNIATA COUNTY COMMISSIONERS, JV TRI-COUNTY DRUG & ALCOHOL, MIFFLIN COUNTY COMMISSIONERS, MIFFLIN COUNTY INDUSTRIAL DEVELOPMENT CORPORATION, MIFFLIN-JUNIATA SPECIAL NEEDS CENTER, PA OFFICE OF RURAL HEALTH, SACRED HEART CATHOLIC SCHOOL, STATE HEALTH CENTER, AND UNITED WAY OF MIFFLIN-JUNIATA. SURVEY OF VULNERABLE POPULATIONS: VULNERABLE POPULATIONS WERE IDENTIFIED BY THE CHNA OVERSIGHT COMMITTEE AND THROUGH STAKEHOLDER INTERVIEWS. VULNERABLE POPULATIONS TARGETED BY THE SURVEYS WERE SENIORS, LOW-INCOME RESIDENTS (INCLUDING FAMILIES), AND RESIDENTS WITH SPECIAL NEEDS. A TOTAL OF 154 SURVEYS WERE COLLECTED IN THE GLH SERVICE AREA. TRIPP UMBACH WORKED WITH THE OVERSIGHT COMMITTEE TO DESIGN A 33 QUESTION HEALTH STATUS SURVEY. THE SURVEY WAS ADMINISTERED BY COMMUNITY BASED ORGANIZATIONS (I.E., MIFFLIN-JUNIATA SPECIAL NEEDS CENTER AND AREA AGENCY ON AGING) PROVIDING SERVICES TO VULNERABLE POPULATIONS IN THE HOSPITAL SERVICE AREA. COMMUNITY BASED ORGANIZATIONS WERE TRAINED TO ADMINISTER THE SURVEY USING HAND-DISTRIBUTION. SURVEYS WERE ADMINISTERED ONSITE AND SECURELY MAILED TO TRIPP UMBACH FOR TABULATION AND ANALYSIS. IDENTIFICATION OF TOP COMMUNITY HEALTH NEEDS: TOP COMMUNITY HEALTH NEEDS WERE IDENTIFIED AND PRIORITIZED BY COMMUNITY LEADERS DURING A REGIONAL COMMUNITY HEALTH NEEDS IDENTIFICATION FORUM HELD ON MARCH 12, 2015. CONSULTANTS PRESENTED TO COMMUNITY LEADERS THE CHNA FINDINGS FROM ANALYZING SECONDARY DATA, KEY STAKEHOLDER INTERVIEWS, AND SURVEYS. COMMUNITY LEADERS DISCUSSED THE DATA PRESENTED, SHARED THEIR VISIONS AND PLANS FOR COMMUNITY HEALTH IMPROVEMENT IN THEIR COMMUNITIES, AND IDENTIFIED AND PRIORITIZED THE TOP COMMUNITY HEALTH NEEDS IN THE GLH COMMUNITY. PUBLIC COMMENT REGARDING THE 2012 CHNA AND IMPLEMENTATION PLAN: TRIPP UMBACH SOLICITED PUBLIC COMMENTARY FROM COMMUNITY LEADERS AND RESIDENTS. COMMENTERS WERE ASKED TO REVIEW THE CHNA AND ACTION PLAN ADOPTED BY GLH IN 2013 AND WERE PROVIDED ACCESS TO EACH DOCUMENT FOR REVIEW. COMMENTERS WERE THEN ASKED TO RESPOND TO A QUESTIONNAIRE WHICH PROVIDED OPEN AND CLOSED RESPONSE QUESTIONS. THE PRIOR CHNA AND IMPLEMENTATION PLAN AND A QUESTIONNAIRE WERE OFFERED IN HARD COPY AT TWO LOCATIONS INSIDE THE HOSPITAL AND WERE ALSO PROVIDED ELECTRONICALLY USING A WEB-BASED PLATFORM.

SOME PROGRAMS ARE COMPLETELY OPERATED OR FUNDED BY GEISINGER AND SOME ARE OFFERED IN COOPERATION WITH LOCAL HEALTH AND HUMAN SERVICE AGENCIES. FOR MORE SPECIFIC NEEDS FOUND IN OUR LOCAL COMMUNITIES, WE OFFER PROGRAMS TO SERVE PATIENTS CLOSE TO HOME. THE TOP THREE NEEDS IDENTIFIED IN THE MOST RECENT AND/OR PAST CHNA SURVEYS FALL INTO ONE OF THREE COMMUNITY NEED CATEGORIES: 1)IMPROVING ACCESS TO HEALTHCARE: THE MOST SIGNIFICANT NEED IDENTIFIED WAS FOR BETTER, FASTER, MORE CONVENIENT AND LESS COSTLY ACCESS TO HEALTHCARE SERVICES. GEISINGER IS TAKING INNOVATIVE STEPS TO ADDRESS BARRIERS TO HEALTHCARE AND HELP PROVIDE PHYSICAL, MENTAL, DENTAL, REHABILITATIVE AND PREVENTIVE SERVICES TO PATIENTS, REGARDLESS OF THEIR HEALTH INSURANCE STATUS. THE TOPICS ADDRESSED INCLUDE: HOW TO FIND THE RIGHT DOCTOR, PROVIDER OR FACILITY; SPECIAL SERVICES PROVIDED TO PATIENTS WITH SPECIFIC NEEDS (SUCH AS THE ELDERLY, UNDERINSURED OR UNINSURED); TRAUMA PREVENTION AND TREATMENT; AND MANY OTHERS. 2)ADDRESSING BEHAVIORAL HEALTH AND SUBSTANCE ABUSE: GEISINGER HAS A WIDE RANGE OF PROGRAMS TO HELP PATIENTS FIND HEALTHCARE SERVICES WHEN THEY ARE FACING BEHAVIORAL HEALTH CHALLENGES OR STRUGGLING WITH ADDICTION. ALZHEIMER'S DISEASE AND OTHER AGING BRAIN ISSUES AS WELL AS ALCOHOLISM AND OPIOID ABUSE ARE ADDRESSED IN A LARGE AND GROWING NUMBER OF PROGRAMS SPECIFICALLY AIMED AT EXPANDING SERVICES. 3)IMPROVING HEALTHY BEHAVIORS: GEISINGER HAS NUMEROUS EDUCATIONAL PROGRAMS TO HELP PATIENTS LIVE WELL. EFFORTS INCLUDE COMMUNITY AND OUTREACH PROGRAMS THAT BRING HEALTHCARE PROFESSIONALS, EDUCATION, NUTRITION AND MEDICATION TO THE PEOPLE. OUR GOAL IS TO ASSIST PATIENTS WITH THEIR HEALTH BEFORE A SERIOUS PROBLEM ARISES SENDING THEM TO THE HOSPITAL. IMPROVING ACCESS TO HEALTHCARE COMPLEX CARE, CLOSER TO HOME: CARE FOR COMPLEX CONDITIONS SUCH AS HEART, LUNG AND KIDNEY DISEASE ARE USUALLY FOUND AT LARGE HEALTH FACILITIES. LONG DRIVES TO A HOSPITAL, LACK OF TRANSPORTATION OPTIONS AND OF SPECIALISTS IN THE AREA MAKES ACCESS TO CARE DIFFICULT. OUR SPECIALISTS TRAVEL SO PATIENTS ARE PROVIDED WITH NEEDED, CONVENIENT SPECIALTY CARE, WITHOUT LONG DRIVES OR THE CHALLENGES OF SEEKING CARE ONLY AT A HOSPITAL. INSTEAD OUR SPECIALISTS TRAVEL ACROSS THE REGION TO CLINICS THAT PROVIDE ADVANCED CARE, WITH THE BENEFIT OF BETTER TRACKING OF PATIENTS WITH CHRONIC CONDITIONS. CLINICS ARE STAFFED WITH DOCTORS, NURSES AND OTHER HEALTHCARE PROFESSIONALS AND DIAGNOSTIC LAB AND IMAGING SERVICES. MANY LOCATIONS ALSO OFFER SPECIALTY PEDIATRIC AND WOMEN'S HEALTH SERVICES. OUR SPECIALISTS, INCLUDING CARDIOLOGY, DERMATOLOGY, COMPLEX ORTHOPAEDIC AND THORACIC SURGERY AND NEUROSURGERY ARE AVAILABLE IN MORE THAN 30 COMMUNITIES ACROSS NORTHEAST AND CENTRAL PA. GEISINGER HEALTH PLAN (GHP): COMPREHENSIVE COVERAGE FOR THE UNINSURED AND SENIORS: GHP, A NONPROFIT HMO, OFFERS AFFORDABLE HEALTH PLANS THAT SERVES THE MOST VULNERABLE IN OUR COMMUNITIES: UNINSURED ADULTS, CHILDREN AND SENIORS. GHP FAMILY IS A MEDICAL-ASSISTANCE, MANAGED-CARE PLAN THAT OFFERS COMPREHENSIVE COVERAGE TO UNINSURED AND UNDERINSURED RESIDENTS OF 22 COUNTIES IN PA. MANY SERVICES ARE PROVIDED AT NO COST, INCLUDING DOCTOR'S OFFICE VISITS, EMERGENCY CARE, PREVENTIVE SERVICES (INCLUDING IMMUNIZATIONS AND SCREENINGS), DIABETES CARE, MATERNITY CARE, DENTAL AND VISION SERVICES AND PRESCRIPTION DRUGS. THERE IS ALSO 24-HOUR ACCESS TO E-NURSES AND HEALTH COACHES.

FOR MOST CHIP IS FREE AND INCLUDES ROUTINE CHECKUPS AND IMMUNIZATIONS, PRESCRIPTION DRUGS, VISION AND DENTAL SERVICES AND EMERGENCY CARE. FOR SENIORS, NAVIGATING THE COMPLEXITIES OF HEALTHCARE COVERAGE CAN BE OVERWHELMING. GHP OFFERS A DUAL ELIGIBILITY PLAN FOR SENIORS WHO QUALIFY FOR MEDICARE PARTS A AND B COVERAGE AS WELL AS MEDICAID. GEISINGER GOLD SECURE RX IS DESIGNED TO MAKE MEDICAL EXPENSES MORE PREDICTABLE, ALLOW BETTER COORDINATION AMONG PROVIDERS AND LOWER OUT-OF-POCKET EXPENSES FOR SENIORS. THIS PLAN OFFERS CONVENIENT BENEFITS WITH LOW OR NO PREMIUMS, A SINGLE ID CARD, PRESCRIPTION DRUG COVERAGE, DENTAL AND VISION SERVICES, FITNESS PROGRAMS AND CARE MANAGEMENT NURSES. PROVENHEALTH NAVIGATOR: IS A TEAM-ORIENTED MEDICAL HOME. A MEDICAL ""HOME"" IS A PATIENT-CENTERED MODEL OF CARE LED BY THE PATIENT'S PRIMARY DOCTOR AND A TEAM OF HEALTHCARE PROFESSIONALS WORKING TOGETHER TO ENSURE THE PROPER CARE. THE TEAM OF SPECIALISTS, CARE MANAGERS, PHARMACISTS, SOCIAL WORKERS AND COMMUNITY HEALTH ASSISTANTS WORK WITH THE PATIENT, FAMILY AND CAREGIVERS TO PLAN CARE THAT WILL PREVENT URGENT/EMERGENT CARE VISITS AND HOSPITALIZATIONS. RESEARCH HAS SHOWN THAT PATIENTS UNDER THE MEDICAL HOME MODEL ARE HEALTHIER AND SPEND LESS TIME HOSPITALIZED. MEDICAL HOME CARE FOCUSES ON FREQUENT DOCTOR VISITS AND CONSISTENT FOLLOW-UP BY THE TEAM, WHICH HAS SHOWN TO BENEFIT THOSE WITH CHRONIC ILLNESSES (DIABETES, HEART DISEASE, ETC.) MEDICAL HOME PATIENTS ALSO HAVE ACCESS TO DOCTORS AND PHN CARE MANAGERS 24/7. CARE MANAGERS HELP PATIENTS NAVIGATE THE COMPLEX HEALTHCARE SYSTEM, COORDINATING CARE AND COMMUNICATING WITH THE TEAM OF PROVIDERS. CARE MANAGERS, SOCIAL WORKERS AND COMMUNITY HEALTH ASSISTANTS ARE ALSO AVAILABLE TO HELP OUR PATIENTS ADDRESS DIFFICULT CHALLENGES, SUCH AS COPING WITH MENTAL ILLNESS, ADDICTION, ABUSE AND LOSS AND MANAGING DISABILITIES. THE TEAM ALSO COORDINATES COMMUNITY RESOURCES THAT ARE AVAILABLE AND ASSISTS THE PATIENT WITH THEIR NEEDS. BY EXPANDING OUR SUCCESSFUL MEDICAL HOME INITIATIVE, WE'RE ENSURING THAT OUR PATIENTS HAVE ACCESS TO THE MOST EFFECTIVE MODELS OF CARE. GEISINGER TELEMEDICINE BRINGS HEALTHCARE CLOSER TO HOME: IN OUR 31COUNTY SERVICE AREA, NEARLY HALF OF OUR PATIENT POPULATION RESIDES IN RURAL AREAS, AND MORE THAN 60 PERCENT OF PATIENTS HAVE CHRONIC HEALTH CONDITIONS. OUR TELEMEDICINE PROGRAM ALLOWS PATIENTS TO STILL RECEIVE SPECIALIZED CARE LOCALLY. OUR PROGRAM USES HIGH-DEFINITION AUDIO/VIDEO TECHNOLOGY AND TOOLS SUCH AS DIGITAL STETHOSCOPES TO CONNECT REMOTE PATIENTS TO OUR HOSPITALS AND PRIMARY CARE CLINICS, AS WELL AS TO NON-GEISINGER FACILITIES. INPATIENTS ARE DIAGNOSED EARLIER, BEGIN TREATMENT SOONER AND AVOID HOSPITAL TRANSFERS, SINCE THEIR PHYSICIANS CAN CONSULT OUR SPECIALISTS ANYWHERE WITHIN OUR SYSTEM. OUR SPECIALISTS HAVE ACCESS TO PATIENTS AT CLINICS ACROSS THE STATE WITHOUT THE PATIENT TRAVELING TO A HOSPITAL TO SEE THE SPECIALIST. THIS SAVES TIME AND REDUCES TRAVEL COSTS AND ALLOWS THE SUPPORT OF LOVED ONES AT HOME. EARLIER DIAGNOSIS REDUCES COSTS FOR EVERYONE. THIS PROGRAM ALLOWS PATIENTS TO CONNECT WITH THE RIGHT SPECIALIST WHEN NEEDED. BY CONNECTING PATIENTS TO OUR SPECIALISTS, ACCESS TO HEALTHCARE IS AVAILABLE TO EVERY PATIENT IN OUR COMMUNITIES. SUPPORT FOR SENIORS AT HOME: LIFE GEISINGER (LIVING INDEPENDENTLY FOR ELDERS) HELPS SENIORS STAY AT HOME, STAY INDEPENDENT AND STAY HEALTHY. THE LIFE GEISINGER TEAM IS ON CALL 24/7, PROVIDING SUPPORT FOR SENIORS AND THEIR LOVED ONES. A PROVIDER TEAM ASSESSES PATIENTS' NEEDS, DEVELOPS CARE PLANS AND DELIVERS THE SERVICES SENIORS AND FAMILIES NEED. TRANSPORTATION SERVICES MAKE HOME DELIVERIES OF SUPPLIES AND/OR MEDICATIONS, CARRY SENIORS TO MEDICAL AND OTHER APPOINTMENTS AND DELIVER LIFE PARTICIPANTS TO AND FROM OUR ADULT DAY CENTERS FOR SCHEDULED VISITS. SENIOR DAY CENTERS OFFER SENIORS COMPREHENSIVE MEDICAL AND SOCIAL SERVICES AND OPPORTUNITIES TO SOCIALIZE AND EXERCISE. OUR ADULT DAY CENTERS ARE OPEN TO ALL SENIORS, REGARDLESS OF WHETHER THEY PARTICIPATE IN LIFE GEISINGER. HIGH-QUALITY, NON-EMERGENCY CARE: FOR PATIENTS EXPERIENCING A NON-EMERGENT INJURY OR ILLNESS, GEISINGER CAREWORKS CLINICS OFFER HIGH-QUALITY MEDICAL SERVICES AT CONVENIENT LOCATIONS THROUGHOUT PA. THESE URGENT CARE CLINICS PROVIDE ECONOMICAL AND CONVENIENT HEALTHCARE FROM HIGHLY TRAINED CERTIFIED NURSE PRACTITIONERS AND PHYSICIAN ASSISTANTS.

The Healthy York County Coalition (HYCC) a local health coalition representing the diversity of the community has led each of the six CHNAs that have been conducted. For the 2015 CHNA, HYCC partnered with its sister health coalition in Adams County Healthy Adams County to form a CHNA Planning Committee comprised of representatives from health and human service agencies, government entities, community-based organizations, higher education institutions, and other interested community members to assist with survey development, data review and analysis, and results distribution. This core committee also assisted with sharing the data and associated community health priorities, once identified by Coalition leadership, to community members at a public form in June 2016. WellSpan-York Hospital is a funding partner and governance leader within the Healthy York County Coalition and served on the CHNA Planning committee. In that regard, York Hospital partners to conduct the CHNA, disseminate its results both among hospital leadership and in the community, and integrate evidence-based strategies that impact identified community health needs into its annual planning process. Whether in meetings with community stakeholders or system/hospital leaders or at larger public forums, WellSpan-York Hospital is committed to obtaining community input to ensure that the CHNA and its associated implementation strategies appropriately address the identified needs of the entire community. Additional details of how community members were engaged is included in Part VI-Needs Assessment."

In 2015, CHNA results and related priorities identified by the Healthy York County Coalition were shared with the system-wide Planning Committee at WellSpan Health. This Committee is comprised of community members and leaders that represent each of WellSpans primary entities and service areas, in addition to corporate leadership. Planning Committee members reviewed the CHNA data, adopted HYCCs priorities of adult overweight/obesity, depression/mental health, and maternal/child health while also identifying two additional priorities: access related to gaps in care caused by high-deductible insurance plans and the emerging opioid misuse and abuse issue facing the community. These five priorities and associated data were subsequently presented to the WellSpan-York Hospital Board for their adoption. The Healthy York County Coalition communicated the CHNA results and identified priorities to approximately 200 community members at a public forum held on June 11, 2016. During that forum, community members discussed the opportunities and risks associated with each priority, as well as how the organization which they represent can have an impact on the priority. In addition to these venues, CHNA results are available on the Healthy York County Coalition (www.healthyyork.org) and WellSpan Health (www.wellspan.org) websites, and may also be obtained upon request. The corresponding WellSpan Community Health Improvement Plan is also available on the WellSpan Health website."

A focus on improving healthy eating and physical activity behaviors and reducing tobacco use has demonstrated efficacy in reducing the impact of various chronic conditions. A few cardiovascular indicators were ranked high by Community Benefit Council members, but not selected as priorities. These include those who have high blood pressure and high cholesterol, and those who have been told that they have heart disease, heart attack, or stroke risk indicators. Council members felt that the root causes of these conditions - unhealthy eating, physical inactivity, and tobacco use - were already part of the selected priorities - adult overweight/obesity and tobacco use."

WellSpan is proud to be a leading partner in the Healthy Community Network, which works to address the needs of uninsured and underinsured individuals in our community. In addition, the health system recently enhanced its financial assistance policy and the discounts that it provides on services. For example, if a patients income is less than 300 percent of the federal poverty level, that patient would be eligible for a 100 percent discount on the services provided. Additionally, significant discounts are available for patients whose income is between 300 percent and 400 percent of the federal poverty level.

Some notable achievements during the 2017 year include:- The Community Referral Coordinator (CRC) program at Mercy Hospital St. Louis has evolved to a 65% appointment kept rate when encountered by a CRC which works in the department (ED) in order to provide patients without a medical home assistance in finding a primary care or specialty care provider, along with social service support, as appropriate. - Mercy Hospital St. Louis implemented several behavioral health programming; Hospital Community Linkages (HCL) Project, the Youth Emergency Room Enhancement Project which mirrors the Emergency Room Enhancement Project for adults. These programs focus on enhancing support for adult and youth high utilizers of ER with the primary goal of reducing preventable hospital contacts across the region by fostering engagement through support, intensive outreach and improving outcomes through connection to community. Mercy Hospital St. Louis also implemented the Engaging Patients in the Care Coordination Program also known as EPICC, this program provides intensive referral and linkage services by Recovery Coaches, peers with lived experience, to impact those who have overdosed on opioids to establish immediate linkages to substance use and medication assisted treatment services. - Mercy Hospital St. Louis in partnership with Generate Health, Barnes Jewish Hospital and SSM Health System continued their collaborative work on the BUILD Health Challenge Grant which focuses on decreasing Maternal/Child Health and infant mortality rates by addressing disparities and transportation.- Mercy Hospital St. Louis continued the Diabetes Empowerment Education Program for minorities battling diabetes in North St. Louis County.- 2017 - Mercy Hospital Washington's McAuley Clinic Women's Program began tracking the number of expectant women who were using drugs, alcohol or tobacco at the time of their first appointment until they delivered. The women were counseled on these unhealthy behaviors for their sake and their babies. Many were referred to treatment programs such as the onsite Mercy Intensive Outpatient Program.- 2017 - Mercy Hospital Washington, in partnership with the Multi-County Drug Task Force and Franklin County Sheriff's Office, began training first responders in several counties so that they could begin carrying and utilizing Narcan to revive overdosed patients while waiting for the ambulance to arrive. The local Mercy hospital stored the Narcan in their pharmacy.- 2017 - Emergency Department Social Workers began using the Mercy PCP weblink portal in establishing ED patients with Primary Care Physicians for follow-up care and educating the patient on possibly more affordable options when needing care.Additional needs being addressed by the Mercy Hospital St. Louis and Mercy Hospital Washington include: - Violence: Domestic, Elderly, Child Abuse, and TraffickingMHSL - MHSL and Alternatives to Living in Violent Environments (ALIVE), a St. Louis based domestic violence agency, have implemented Project HOPE, the only program in the St. Louis area that allows domestic violence survivors to file for, and potentially have granted, orders of protection while still in a hospital setting. Information regarding ALIVE's programming and services is distributed throughout MHSL, with Spanish translations provided to better reach patients who speak limited English. MHSL is also actively involved in the Coalition Against Trafficking and Exploitation (CATE), and partners with St. Martha's Hall, a Catholic Charities organization that provides shelter and services to women and children who have survived domestic violence. Mercy will continue its collaboration and involvement with these groups, as well as the awareness and education campaigns it has begun with restroom resource posters, a training video, and the incorporation of a screening question/referral process in Mercy's Electronic Medical Record (EMR). However, it was felt by Mercy's CHC that while continued attention to this issue was important, the issues of access, health equity, and the community's crisis with behavioral health and addiction demanded Mercy's focus at this time. Inpatient care management is currently looking into expanding this resource to MHJ.MHW - MHW works closely with domestic violence, sex trafficking and family services agencies, such as Alternatives to Living in Violent Environments (ALIVE) and local law enforcement to insure patients are given safe choices while in a hospital setting. Mercy has begun safety awareness and educational campaigns which includes internal training videos, restroom resource posters, and the incorporation of a safety screening/referral question which cues up in each patient's Mercy's Electronic Medical Record (EMR).- Obesity/Poor Nutrition/Physical InactivityMHSL & MHW - Although neither chose healthy lifestyles as a priority community health need to be addressed, Mercy has focused on its own coworkers, 10,000+ in the East Community, as a start to addressing this need. A robust initiative, Mercy's Healthification program, provides comprehensive health evaluation, screening, education, and incentives to increase healthy behaviors and improve health among Mercy coworkers. Mercy Clinic also offers a variety of programs and services to address chronic conditions and a healthy lifestyle.- Chronic Conditions: Heart Disease, Diabetes, or Asthma and AllergiesA significant concern relating to chronic conditions is the disparity in health outcomes and treatment for Blacks/African-Americans and Whites/Caucasians. MHSL recently signed an American Hospital Association Health Equity pledge and is beginning to implement ""Call to Action"" goals aimed at identifying and, subsequently, addressing areas of health disparity and service gaps. As the leader in St Louis County for newborn deliveries, MHSL has decided to take on the significant issue of health equity by beginning with maternal/child health disparities and addressing some of the region's needs with low birth weight babies. Mercy has also committed to addressing health equity in the Inner North region community of Wellston; Mercy is outlining a collaborative community plan to address overall health equity with these community members.- Cancers and Tobacco UseMHSL & MHW - Community cancer screenings and education continue to be offered regionally. Efforts to address tobacco cessation will continue through Mercy's Certified Health and Wellness Coach/Mercy Road to Freedom program though Mercy's Cardiopulmonary Rehab area. Additionally, Mercy will continue to advocate around measures that promote tobacco cessation. For example, Tobacco 21, a bill introduced by a MHSL physician in 2016 to raise the tobacco products purchase age to 21 in St. Louis County. The bill was passed and the new tobacco products purchase age law will go into effect on December 1, 2016. MHW will look for opportunities to expand this legislation to Franklin County. Other identified needs not being addressed and why not, if applicable.The following needs are not being addressed:- Sexually Transmitted InfectionsMHSL & MHW - Infectious disease physicians at Mercy will continue to address this issue through collaborative work. Mercy will not, however, take a lead role on this issue as there are some limitations to the organization's partnerships in this area as a Catholic Health System. - Physical Environment: Air/Water Quality and HousingMHW - In the category of Physical Environment, MHW has chosen Transportation, under the Access to Care priority. Collaboration with local coalitions addressing homelessness and housing will continue as will Mercy's support of industry, government, non-governmental organizations and the public in addressing air and water quality in our area."

Improve recovery rates and reduce public health crisis related to alcohol and substance use disorders.3. Improve behavioral health and substance use disorders screening, wellness, and awareness through education and self-management programs. Progress toward these goals has included: * Avera Queen of Peace provided leadership expertise for the Mitchell Chamber Community Health and Wellness Fair. The wellness fair was open to the public free of charge. Vendors and programs that address behavioral health awareness and substance use disorders were invited and participated in the fair. * AQOP staff collaborated with local experts during Mitchell Chamber Community Health and Wellness Fair. B. Access to CareAccess to primary and mental healthcare services was identified as a priority of the community. Our goal is to improve access to primary care and mental health care services.

Increasing access to primary care, specialties, and care coordination teams contributes to improved health outcomes. Access to services, early intervention, education, and support are critical to achieve improved long-term outcome for individuals and communities. Avera Queen of Peace continues to actively recruit family practice, internal medicine, obstetrics and gynecology, clinical psychology, radiology, and pediatric providers. Fiscal year 2018 recruitments included two hospitalists in the creation of a new program, along with new e-Hospitalist program to extend hours. Radiology was moved from a contracted service to and employment model. C. Prevention, Wellness, Screening and EducationOngoing education related to how physical and mental health issues impact overall health of an individual and learning to manage chronic disease conditions was identified to be a priority of the community. As the focus on community and population health increases, it becomes more critical to invest resources and create partnerships related to prevention, wellness, screenings and education. The hospital's education programs, participation in health fairs, and support group programs are intended to address community education and support. Personalized chronic disease management education and support are also essential to improve the overall health of individuals and communities. Partnerships and collaborations with health agencies, providers, and community organizations are essential to increase breadth and depth of prevention, wellness, screening, and education knowledge. The hospital has developed the following goals to address this need.1. Build a culture of health through collaborative prevention, wellness, screening and education. 2. Engage and empower individuals to actively manage their chronic disease through education and support. Progress toward these goals has included: * Added Planet Heart screening to our radiology menu of services. * Diabetic supply assistance to patients who cannot afford supplies (11 patients). * During year two of the Rural Electronic Gestational Diabetes Grant (eGDM) 61 patients were enrolled, 47 patients delivered and services were expanded to Yankton, Pierre, Gregory, and Wagner areas. * Stop the Bleed presentations and kits (Dakota Fest, 1st Aid education) * Avera Queen of Peace Foundation funded: 31 health screenings for breast and colorectal health, two educational events, 25 overnight stays for cancer patients, and 652 meals for cancer patients."

CHNA Needs Not Addressed:Though Avera Weskota Memorial Hospital is a leader in identifying the needs of the community, some needs fall outside the span of control of the hospital. Unmet needs identified by the 2016 Community Health Needs Assessment will be addressed by recommended community organizations. These unmet needs include: * Assisted Living: Assisted living was identified as a need in the community for the 2013 and 2016 CHNA. In 2013, this issue was referred to Weskota Manor Avera. Developing assisted living is in the nursing home's long range strategic plan, but it is not financially feasible at this time. The health care community, hospital advisory board, and nursing home governing board will be educated regarding this plan. Avera Weskota Memorial Hospital will refer the identified need to Weskota Manor Avera for consideration in their long range strategic planning.In-home services are available to assist tenants in the independent living apartments. Services include: skilled home health and hospice services, hot meal programs, bus transit services and homemaker programs. * Recruitment of Healthcare Workers: Recruitment of healthcare staff was also identified as a concern. Low unemployment rate as well as a shortage of healthcare and home maker program applicants is a problem across the state. The facility will continue to apply creative ideas to recruitment and will not pursue this as a community health needs priority. Avera Weskota Memorial Hospital and the other healthcare facilities will continue to work with this issue. The hospital is using the South Dakota Retention Bonus as an incentive to recruit and retain professional staff, in addition to loan forgiveness and bonuses. This incentive has helped recruit and retain some, but not all, staff. Avera Weskota is participating in a Margaret A. Cargill Foundation Grant with Dakota Wesleyan University to educate and prepare Certified Nursing Assistants (CNA) and nurses in rural communities. In addition, the hospital will participate with University of South Dakota and United States Department of Agriculture (USDA) project, a project whereby student education is delivered via telemedicine to rural students at the facility."

The survey was offered in Spanish and English. 65 individuals completed the survey in Spanish and 694 completed the survey in English. Individuals were invited to participate based on their ability to represent: underserved, low-income and minority population needs; needs of chronically ill patients; and awareness of healthcare needs in their respective communities. Participants were asked to share their viewpoints on: Important health concerns in the community; Significant service gaps in the community; Ideas for addressing concerns and service gaps.To gauge the importance of various health concerns, respondents were asked to ""Choose the top 5 priorities you think should be addressed in your community"" from a list of 34 health concerns. Respondents were then asked to rate their overall health, the health of the community, and the quality of life of the community. Other questions included reviewing lists of services typically important to addressing health concerns and how strong the community was in providing those services. Respondents were then asked to indicate services that needed to be strengthened in terms of availability, access, and quality. Open-ended response items were provided for participants to indicate additional service gaps in the community and ideas for addressing concerns and service gaps. Community ConversationsFive Community Conversations were held as part of the CHNA process in which 78 individuals participated from all of the core jurisdictions of Hanover, Henrico, Chesterfield, and Richmond City. Overall, the racial and geographical diversity of the participants represented a healthy mix of the region's residents. The purpose of the conversation was to elicit feedback from community members about publicly available health data describing health conditions in the services area, and to review the online survey results to further explore findings. Attendees were asked to 1) rank the health issues identified in the Community Survey according to the issues that impact them and the people close to them the most and 2) rank the issues needing to be addressed to improve the overall health of the region from a community view.Priority Needs Bon Secours Richmond convened a CHNA Advisory Board to support the process by engaging community members and providing feedback on the findings. The CHNA Advisory Board included individuals with special knowledge of public health and underserved populations and included the following: Directors from the Richmond City Health Department and the Chickahominy Health District, an Executive Director of a Free Clinic, a Vice President from VCU Health, Vice Presidents from the Better Housing Coalition and United Methodist Family Services, and the Executive Director of the Richmond Academy of Medicine. A group conversation was facilitated by Becky Clay Christensen and included a review of all qualitative and quantitative data gathered from the Community Survey, Community Conversations, and publicly available secondary health data. Advisory Board members were asked to categorize issues as high or low need in the community using a Strategy Grid. They were also asked to determine the feasibility of the community's ability to make an impact on the issues."

201921929349300807,541744931,"Memorial Regional Medical Center, Inc.","Part V, Section B, Line 11: The Implementation Plan focuses on 4 broad areas including Access to Care for the Uninsured with Chronic Disease, Mental Health, Transportation, and Education. Goals and objectives were created for each area and were based on Healthy People 2020 objectives, Virginia's Plan for Well-Being 2016-2020 goals, and other evidence-based sources.The overarching goal for Access to Care for the Uninsured with Chronic Disease is to improve access to high quality health care services. This has been achieved in part by supporting the many community partners who work with the uninsured population to include: the Free Clinic Network, the Capital Region Collaborative, and the two other hospital systems in the region. Additionally, Bon Secours Mercy Health provides services to the uninsured through the Care-A-Van, St. Joseph's Outreach Clinic, and the Community Nutrition program. Partnerships to achieve this objective include Churches, nutrition and healthy food providers, St. Joseph's Villa and The Daily Planet (FQHC).The goal in addressing Mental Health is to improve mental health status by ensuring access to appropriate, quality mental health services. We aim to achieve this by increasing the proportion of people who receive appropriate treatment for mental health disorders. Increasing the use of depression screenings and integrating behavioral health with primary care are two strategies that have been implemented to impact this goal. Partners in this work include The Daily Planet, the National Alliance on Mental Health, United Methodist Family Services, Childsavers, Stop Child Abuse Now, and the Bon Secours Bereavement Center. Additionally, Henrico Area Mental Health and Development Services, Chesterfield Department of Mental Health Support Services, the City of Richmond Department of Health, and the two other health systems in the region will be influential partners to impact Mental Health.Transportation is being addressed by increasing safe, healthy, and reliable transportation options for residents in the Richmond service area. Bon Secours Mercy Health promotes active transportation through advocacy for and provision of place making in the neighborhoods we serve. Additionally, we are an advocate for the expansion of public transportation options to increase access for those in underserved areas and improve ridership through a community-based design. One place making activity included the opening of the Sarah Garland Jones Center for Health Communities. Additionally, advocacy efforts include the expansion of safe walking and biking opportunities and the redesign of the public bus system to ensure timely access for all those we serve. Bon Secours Mercy Health also provides transportation to and from Richmond Community Hospital.The goal for Education is to promote student success in schools to improve health and quality of life for the Richmond community and future generations. Our efforts have focused on kindergarten readiness, 3rd grade Standards of Learning (SOL)reading test scores, and high school graduation rates. The Care-A-Van provides no cost vaccines and school physicals to children to ensure school readiness as well as enrolls eligible children in FAMIS Medicaid. Partners to support this work include, Commonwealth Parenting, Excel VCU, Faison School for Autism, Friends Association, Richmond Cycling Corps, First Things First, Reach Out and Read, Sacred Heart Center, Virginia Literacy Foundation, YMCA, YWCA, Peter Paul Development Center, Armstrong Priorities Freshman Academy, Anna Julie Cooper School, Church Hill Activities and Tutoring, Great Aspirations Scholarship Program, United Way, Higher Achievement, Salvation Army Boys and Girls Club, and many others providing direct education and workforce readiness training.Needs Not AddressedAccess to care for Medicaid and Medicare beneficiaries, adult and childhood obesity, jobs with fair wages, families living in poverty and seniors were identified as high needs in the community. The CHNA Advisory Board also identified these needs as having high feasibility meaning there was sufficient community support to make an impact.During the Community Conversations, older adults with Medicare shared they had challenges finding community physicians who accepted Medicare patients. This is being addressed by Bon Secours Richmond Health System that includes Bon Secours Medical Group and VCU Health in that they accept Medicaid and Medicare patients.Adult and childhood obesity are being addressed in the community by multiple organizations including Active RVA, City of Richmond's Corner Store initiative, Faces of Hope, Fit 4 Kids, the Seventh District Health and Wellness Initiative, Shalom Farms, Sports Backers/Richmond Strikers, Tricycle Gardens, Virginia Recreation and Parks and the YMCA.Jobs with Fair Wages is being addressed by the City of Richmond Community Wealth Building, Goodwill, Richmond Technical Center, Chesterfield Career and Technical Center, The Hanover Center for Trades and Technology, Henrico County Public Schools Career and Technical Education, United Way of Greater Richmond & Petersburg and the Virginia Interfaith Center.A family living in poverty is a multi-factorial issue which may be impacted through enhanced education and transportation, both areas of focus for the 2016 CHNA. Organizations presently engaged in breaking the cycle of poverty include Area Congregations Together in Service, Better Housing Coalition, Capital Region Collaboration, City of Richmond Community Wealth Building, Commonwealth Catholic Charities, Local Initiative Support Corporation (LISC), Peter Paul Development Center, Richmond Cycling Corps, Richmond Hill, Richmond Redevelopment and Housing Authority, Salvation Army Boys and Girls Club.The needs of the older adult population in the greater metro Richmond area or seniors are being addressed by Circle Center Adult Day Services, Old Dominion Partnership, Peter Paul Development Center, Rebuilding Together Richmond, Senior Connections, Senior Navigator and Shepherd's Center of Chesterfield."

201823169349303242,131624135,"PART V, LINE 5","A 54-question survey was developed through a collective effort by a five-member HSS CHNA steering committee, community partners, internal stakeholders and the public. The CHNA steering committee identified validated research questions to be addressed, drafted the individual survey questions, and identified community partners and internal stakeholders to review and provide input to survey development. Collaboration with the public, community partners and internal stakeholders was crucial to the success of this survey with valuable feedback provided on survey construction and length. In an effort to reach a culturally diverse community, the survey was translated into Spanish and Chinese using a culturally sensitive back translation approach. Below outlines the list of community partners involved in survey construction: . Arthritis Foundation New York Chapter . Clinical & Translational Science Center (CTSC) Weill Cornell Medicine . Memorial Sloan Kettering Cancer Center . New York Presbyterian Hospital . Lenox Hill Neighborhood House . Medicare Rights Center . NYC DOHMH Office of Policy, Planning and Strategic Data Use . New York City Department of Aging . S.L.E. Lupus Foundation . Self Help Innovative Senior . Isabella Geriatric . Touro College Graduate School of Social Work HSS facilitated systematic, scheduled input and feedback from its varied constituents internal stakeholders, the public, and community partners based on the CHNA results to guide the selection of the health needs and services to address in its community programming. Relevant national, state and city health data and needs assessment results were also utilized to drive community programming. Our approach in identifying, prioritizing and selecting significant health needs is described below: Input from Internal Stakeholders- Recognizing that the development of community health programming requires a concerted effort by all members of the organization, we involved various representatives from HSS departments. The knowledge and experience of physicians, nurses, social workers and other staff that have a vested interest in serving the community was essential in identifying and addressing the communitys health needs. An internal stakeholder meeting was held on May 26, 2016 with 15 HSS staff to discuss identified health priorities and explore areas for implementing initiatives, using results from the CHNA and stakeholders awareness of community needs to guide the discussion. The group discussed focusing on increasing access to high quality, culturally relevant chronic disease preventive care and management of musculoskeletal and rheumatologic conditions and reducing obesity in adults and children, which aligns with the NYSDOH CSP priority areas. Input from Community Partners- Feedback from community partner organizations was critical to driving the assessment and selection of public health priorities for the Hospital. Using results of the CHNA as the basis for discussion, HSS and its partners exchanged valuable information regarding community needs, explored areas for future collaboration, and solidified a mutual commitment to advancing public health. Furthermore, community partner knowledge of their respective community helped to identify gaps in community programming or more specifically, areas where HSS could use its areas of expertise to make a lasting public health impact. Overall, feedback from these meetings solidified the direction for programs that improve the communitys diet and increase physical activity to combat obesity among children and adults, examine specific communities in need of chronic disease preventive care and management of musculoskeletal and rheumatologic conditions, and provide culturally relevant education regarding musculoskeletal and rheumatologic issues. HSS met with the Greater New York Hospital Association (GNYHA), a trade association, to inform the structure and process for selecting its public health priorities. In-person meetings and conference calls with GNYHA were held on 07/21/15, 07/28/15, 01/15/16, 03/11/16, 04/8/16, 04/13/16, 04/28/16, and 05/09/16 to discuss the NYS DOH CSP requirements and federal requirements for the CHNA. HSS also attended one of the 29 community consultations hosted by the NYC DOHMH Take Care New York on January 26, 2016 in Central Harlem to foster continued partnership in improving health needs of New Yorkers. These community consultations provided New Yorkers the opportunity to rank health indicators outlined in the TCNY 2020, and discuss health goals of the community and resources that help meet these goals. Our involvement in this process provided valuable insight into the publics needs and helped in guiding the selection of public health needs to ensure it resonates with the health care needs of New Yorkers. In addressing the NYS prevention agenda, conference calls and in-person meetings were held with the NYCDOH on 03/21/16, 04/18/16 and 06/08/16 to explore areas of partnership. Furthermore, a community partners meeting was held on May 25, 2016. Nine individuals from the community partner organizations attended this meeting at which we shared the CHNA results, elicited feedback and ranked health issues according to the communities they serve. CHNA results were received positively and there was extensive discussion about how results accurately depicted the various communities served and how these results could be used to impact the community at large. Specifically, there were discussions about access to educational programs and ways in which HSS could extend the reach of its programs. Input from the General Public- To further HSS commitment to developing programs that improve community health, obtaining feedback from the public and patient community was also instrumental in driving the Hospitals selection of significant health needs. Our approach in soliciting input from the public is described below. Community Forums- Four community forums were held to allow community members an opportunity to prioritize health needs that provided HSS with the appropriate direction in selecting its public health priorities. The main communication channel for notifying the public about the forums were through flyers distributed at HSS community programs and outpatient clinics and posting on digital media (web, Facebook and twitter). In addition, announcements were made during public and patient programs held at HSS, and a poster was strategically placed in a high traffic area of the Hospital to publicize the meeting. Furthermore, in order to reach at-risk and minority populations, HSS partnered with Senior Centers in Manhattan and Chinatown to advertise community forums to their community members. Specific dates, locations, and attendance for these Community forums were as follows: . May 17, 2016 at Lenox Hill Neighborhood House, Manhattan (11 people present) . May 21, 2016 at the Living Healthy with Lupus Workshop, HSS (50 people present) . May 23, 2016 at Chinatown Community Center, Visiting Nurses Services New York (35 people present) . May 25, 2016 at the Senior Health and Fitness Day, HSS (17 people present) Community members were asked to rank the health needs most important to them and give their perspective on community health issues in an open discussion. Each significant health need identified in the CHNA results were ranked from 1 to 22. All rankings were added together across each location and health issues were re-ranked based on their overall score. Community health needs that were considered significant were ranked among the top five of identified needs, which are . Osteoarthritis/Osteoporosis/Rheumatoid Arthritis . Muscle, Bone and Joint Pain . Fatigue . Falls . Obesity"

Program 1: HSS Nursing Community Education Outreach Initiative This initiative targets underserved older adults living in the community. The programs overall goal is to deliver evidence-based educational content germane to issues appropriate for older adults. The quality educational sessions use teaching strategies and educational principles deigned to improve knowledge, skills and confidence to manage and prevent chronic diseases. Educational lectures are mainly delivered by HSS nursing staff, and topics are selected based upon needs assessment results and participant feedback, such as management of chronic conditions (i.e. osteoarthritis, osteoporosis and rheumatoid arthritis), falls prevention, nutrition and medication safety. The anticipated program impact includes increase in knowledge about managing their chronic conditions, maintaining a healthy lifestyle, identifying increased risk of falls and preventing likelihood of falls. Program 2: Musculoskeletal Health Wellness Initiative (MHI) To address the public health issue of musculoskeletal conditions, HSS developed the Musculoskeletal Health Wellness Initiative (MHI), comprised of educational and exercise programs, to raise awareness, educate and reduce the impact of musculoskeletal conditions in the community. The initiative offers lectures, workshops and webinars about musculoskeletal health specific topics such as osteoarthritis, osteoporosis, and rheumatoid arthritis and some of the symptoms associated with these conditions (falls, fatigue, stiffness, and muscle, bone and joint pain), in addition to maintaining a healthy lifestyle. The exercise component of the initiative is comprised of weekly exercise classes such as Yoga, Pilates, Tai Chi, Dance, and Yogalates specifically designed for individuals that are suffering from or at risk of musculoskeletal and rheumatologic conditions. The anticipated program impact includes improved musculoskeletal health by decreasing musculoskeletal pain, stiffness, fatigue and falls, and increasing frequency of physical activity and self-efficacy. Program 3: Pain and Stress Management Series In response to the lack of confidence in managing chronic conditions, and mental health issues identified in the CHNA, HSS developed the pain and stress management series. This is comprised of educational, and mindfulness based coping techniques to raise awareness, educate and improve the ability to cope with pain and stress. This program offers mind/body workshops, exercises such as Yoga, and expert-guided meditation to help reduce physical and mental stressors. All the educational programs are taught by experienced physicians, nurses, physical and occupational therapists, while Yoga workshops are led by certified yoga instructors. The anticipated program impact includes improving confidence in managing chronic conditions and its symptoms such as pain, and improving ability to cope with stress. Program 4: HSS Asian Community Bone Health Initiative In response to the health needs of the growing number of Asian older adults living in NYCs Chinatown community and the CHNA results where Asians reported that they were told by their doctor to engage in more physical activity, HSS developed the Asian Community Bone Health Initiative (ACBHI). The overall goal of this initiative is to improve Asian seniors management of their chronic musculoskeletal conditions (such as osteoarthritis and osteoporosis) and its symptoms (e.g. falls, stiffness, fatigue, muscle bone and joint pain) while also increasing access to care in this medically underserved community. The ACBHI is comprised of culturally relevant musculoskeletal health lectures and workshops, self-management education, yoga and low impact chair exercise programs. The anticipated program impact includes improved musculoskeletal health by decreasing musculoskeletal pain, stiffness, fatigue and falls, and increasing frequency of physical activity and self-efficacy. Program 5: Resident Geriatric Training Program This program is designed to enhance communication skills of third-year orthopedic surgery residents with older adults that are suffering from or at risk of musculoskeletal and rheumatologic conditions. The program includes meetings with the Program Coordinator, a licensed social worker, for the residents to explore their attitudes toward older patients, weekly resident rounds for selected residents to present and illustrate specific geriatric needs, and presentations to participants of the HSS Greenberg Academy for Successful Aging. Presentations cover topics such as management of musculoskeletal conditions (i.e. osteoarthritis and osteoporosis) and some of the symptoms associated with these conditions (such as muscle, back, bone and joint pain), and falls prevention. The anticipated program impact includes improving the ability of older adults to manage their musculoskeletal conditions and symptoms and improved doctor/patient communication. Program 6: VOICES 60+ Senior Advocacy Program This program was launched in recognition of the multiple challenges older adults face in effectively utilizing high quality chronic disease care to optimize health outcomes, and access needed social support, particularly for those who are from low-income and Spanish speaking communities. VOICES 60+ is designed to enhance the medical care experience of low income, ethnically diverse (primarily Hispanic) HSS patients 60 and older in these areas. The program helps patients to navigate and access support, education and communication resources needed to manage their rheumatologic or musculoskeletal conditions and its symptoms to improve their quality of life. In addition, the program provides services focused on identifying and addressing communication barriers between older adult patients and healthcare providers to optimize health outcomes. Anticipated program impact includes improved provider/patient communication that will enhance communication skills of older adults and management of rheumatologic or musculoskeletal conditions and its symptoms. Program 7: Rheumatoid Arthritis (RA) Support and Education Programs This initiative addresses the psychoeducational needs of community members and their families living with long-standing rheumatoid arthritis, and for people newly diagnosed. These monthly programs feature a lecture on an RA-specific topic its management, presented by healthcare professionals, and are followed by a support group, co-facilitated by a social worker and a rheumatology nurse. Anticipated program impact includes enhancing self-management skills and self-efficacy around managing RA and its symptoms. Program 8: LANtern Lupus Asian Network In response to the CHNA results highlighting health disparities in the Asian community specifically related to lupus, HSS has implemented LANtern, which is a national model for support and education of Asian Americans with lupus and their families. LANtern is the only hospital based support and education program designed specifically for Asians/Asian Americans with lupus. Through its bilingual (Chinese) SupportLine, publications, community and professional programs, and capacity building, the program seeks to enhance awareness, understanding, coping and knowledge for Asian Americans with lupus and their loved ones. Anticipated program impact includes increased knowledge about high quality preventive care for the Asian community and improved clinical management of lupus and its symptoms. Program 9: Charla de Lupus/Lupus Chat The Charla de Lupus/Lupus Chat (""Charla"") program addresses health disparities among African Americans and Latinos with lupus according to the CHNA findings. This social work led program engages and trains peer volunteers to become empowering role models by providing culturally relevant strategies to help increase understanding of this complex illness and its treatment, improve medical adherence, and enhance coping and healthy behaviors. Comprehensive bilingual (English/Spanish) services include: the Charla Line, a toll-free national support and education helpline; weekly Onsite Peer Support Outreach at four hospital-based clinics, monthly Charla Teen and Parent Lupus Chat Groups; numerous community, professional education and government collaborations. Anticipated program impact includes increased knowledge and self-management skills of lupus and its symptoms.

The facilities serve a diverse population in Westchester County and share an authorized body which adopted the assessment in 2017. The St. John's CHNA was developed during 2016 in collaboration with the Westchester County Department of Health's 'Health and Hospital Planning Teamthe Montefiore Hudson Valley Collaborative Performing Provider System (PPS) Hospital Group, and referenced the 'One Region, One CNA' - An Eight County Community Needs Assessment Undertaken in Collaboration With: Westchester Medical Center, Montefiore Medical Center, Refuah Health Center and Health Alliance of the Hudson Valley, December 2016. The Westchester County Department of Health (WCDOH), http://health.westchestergov.com/, and the Montefiore Hudson Valley Collaborative PPS, http://www.montefiore.org/hudson-valley-collaborative, Community Health Needs Assessments, which meet both IRS and NYS needs assessment and service plan requirements, contain more detailed information and data on the health status of the population and distribution of health issues based on analysis of demographic factors and identification of the main health challenges facing the community; as well as a discussion of the contributing causes of these challenges, including broad determinants of health. Our partner sessions gave the opportunity for area hospitals to discuss NYS Prevention Agenda priorities, feedback from their public needs assessments, services provided, gaps in service and best practices. While all hospitals in Westchester County share the same priorities, each hospital selected priorities that aligned with their mission, were attainable, and created a program that best suited its institution and patient service area. The public input process also encompassed collaboration with the following partners: City of Yonkers/SJRH's Healthy Yonkers Initiative and the SJRH community advisory committee. A multidisciplinary group was involved in assessing community health needs in Westchester County with public participation solicited via a survey sponsored by the WCDOH and community partners. The collaborative process was beneficial in researching current health data, conducting health needs assessments within our communities, sharing of best practice interventions and leveraging of resources. To determine the most pressing health needs of our community, we surveyed members of the medically underserved, low-income, and minority population in the SJRH service area, who represent the health interests of our patients and their families. St. John's leadership also considered its own resources, strengths, and abilities in the selection of SJRH's priority community needs. To help support and coordinate this collaboration, the WCDOH invited all Westchester hospitals to attend a kick-off meeting in April 2017. To support in the selection of priorities the WCDOH's Health and Hospital Planning Team held collaborative meetings from April through November 2017. The collection of primary data from a sample of the Westchester County residents was an important element of the development of the Community Health Needs Assessment. SJRH engaged with the WCDOH's on-line Community Resident and Provider Health Surveys to facilitate the implementation of the data collection process. We identified the following partners to help implement interventions identified in our community health needs ASSESSMENT: Hudson River HealthCare FQHC, Hudson Community Health Alliance's Local IMPACT Initiative, primary practice offices, Cancer Coalition of Westchester, Healthy Yonkers Initiative, SJRH Behavioral Health Services, SJRH Community Advisory Team, Westchester County Department of Health and the Montefiore Hudson Valley Collaborative. Our planning team also conducted a survey of selected stakeholders representing health care and service-providing agencies within the county. The purpose of the study was to provide feedback from community service providers in order to: 1) guide strategic planning, 2) highlight topics for increased public awareness, 3) identify areas for training, and 4) inform the statewide Prevention Agenda. The survey was developed through a collaborative effort by an eighteen-member survey committee representing county public health department and local hospitals during the spring-summer of 2017. A total of 1,318 community surveys and 218 provider surveys were conducted May 16 to June 30, 2017. To ensure a broad assessment of our community health needs, we engaged a variety of participants including, but not limited to, the community-at-large through local residents participating in SJRH speaker's bureau's health education programs. We shared health data and sought feedback through the following SJRH groups: community advisory committee, pastoral care committee, physician alignment committee, radiology advisory committee, wellness committee, board of trustees and our employees. SJRH also gathered information from external sources by conducting public forums at the Cross County Shopping Center in Yonkers, New York and other health sessions held at select locations to address the community that represented the diverse population that we serve. We plan to provide ongoing opportunities for hospitals and other stakeholders, i.e. community-based organizations, to strategize on how to address health priorities. We will also work with partners to provide more refined data to track and evaluate progress in achieving goals related to selected priorities. SJRH will continue to communicate with other community-based organizations regarding advocacy, participation in local community events, and exchange of referral information. Engaging local community members in our efforts enables us to involve our health care institution and the community in the activities of national health advocacy organizations, including walks, fairs, and other awareness-raising activities for health issues that impact the community.

The survey, coordinated with the Maine CDC, engaged public health expertise throughout the process. The survey was administered using a snowball approach where stakeholder agencies agreed to send the surveys to their members and stakeholders for participation. 1,639 people, representing more than 80 organizations and businesses in Maine, completed the survey. Respondents represented health care agencies, public health agencies, law enforcement, municipalities, schools, local businesses, social service agencies, and nongovernmental organizations. In addition to the stakeholder survey, each county conducted a number of community engagement opportunities (forums) to ensure broad interests of the local community were represented; Obtain stakeholder input on identifying significant health needs based on review of shared CHNA data; Solicit stakeholder feedback on prioritizing significant health needs, and; Identify local assets and resources that potentially may address local health priorities. The local forums were conducted in collaboration with the Maine CDC to solicit input from individuals representing populations with health disparities. The following organizations were in attendance at the January 11, 2016 Cumberland County Shared CHNA Community Engagement Forum and provided valuable feedback on the Shared CHNA.Details about organizations: Sample of organizations United Way, ME Health Access Foundation, Southern ME Area Agency on Aging, Preble St. Resource Center, legislator, Somali community members, USM/UNE/SMCC/Tufts medical School, ME Health Mgt Coalition, MaineMedical Center (hospital facility), Spring Harbor Hospital, Mercy Hospital, Bridgton Hospital, HMP, & Portland Public Health.

THIS GROUP, CALLED THE COMMUNITY HEALTH IMPROVEMENT WORKGROUP (CHIW) MEETS MONTHLY TO CONDUCT THE CHNA WHEN INDICATED AND TO IMPLEMENT THE COMMUNITY-WIDE IMPROVEMENT STRATEGY. COMMUNITY INPUT IS CRITICAL THROUGHOUT THE CHNA PROCESS, THE IMPROVEMENT PLANNING PROCESS, AND THE IMPLEMENTATION PROCESS. ONGOING COMMUNITY ENGAGEMENT IS VITAL TO INFORM OUR AGENDA. EACH OF THE HOSPITAL SYSTEMS INCLUDED IN THE CHNA: UNIVERSITY OF ROCHESTER STRONG MEMORIAL HOSPITAL, HIGHLAND HOSPITAL, ROCHESTER REGIONAL HEALTH, AND UNITY HOSPITAL TOOK INTO ACCOUNT INPUT FROM PERSONS WHO REPRESENT THE COMMUNITY. THE MONROE COUNTY DEPARTMENT OF PUBLIC HEALTH WAS REPRESENTED AT EACH CHIW MEETING BY ANNE KERN, PUBLIC HEALTH PROGRAM COORDINATOR, AND KATHY CARELOCK, MANAGER OF THE DIVISION OF EPIDEMIOLOGY.

SPECIFICALLY FOR THE 2016 CHNA, COMMUNITY INPUT WAS ACQUIRED BY REVIEWING EXISTING COMMUNITY REPORTS AND BY DISCUSSIONS WITH EXISTING COMMUNITY BASED GROUPS ABOUT THE DATA-IDENTIFIED NEEDS. THE CHIW REVIEWED SEVERAL RECENTLY CONDUCTED COMMUNITY ENGAGED REPORTS AROUND COMMUNTY HEALTH IN MONROE COUNTY, PRIMARILY THOSE CONDUCTED FOR DSRIP IN LATE 2015. FOCUS GROUPS AND KEY INFORMANT INTERVIEWS WERE CONDUCTED BY COMMON GROUND HEALTH FOR THE DSRIP COMMUNITY NEEDS ASSESSMENT IN 2015. (*1) THE FOCUS GROUP FINDINGS PROVIDED INSIGHT INTO ISSUES IMPACTING HEALTH OF THE MEDICAID POPULATION. THREE KEY THEMES THAT EMERGED FROM THE FOCUS GROUPS INCLUDED 1. THE EFFECT OF SOCIAL DETERMINANTS INCLUDING POVERTY ON HEALTH, 2. HEALTH LITERACY AND THE IMPACT IT HAS ON PEOPLES ABILITY TO MANAGE THEIR HEALTH AND 3. THE IMPORTANCE OF CULTURALLY APPROPRIATE CARE. IN LATE 2014, COMMON GROUND HEALTH, IN COLLABORATION WITH THE HIGH BLOOD PRESSURE COLLABORATIVE OF THE ROCHESTER CHAMBER OF COMMERCE, CONDUCTED A SERIES OF FOCUS GROUPS WITH PEOPLE DIAGNOSED WITH HIGH BLOOD PRESSURE. KEY THEMES IDENTIFIED DURING THE FOCUS GROUPS INCLUDED A NEED TO SUPPORT PEOPLE IN MAKING LIFESTYLE CHANGES, HEALTH LITERACY, AND STRATEGIES AROUND MEDICATION COMPLIANCE. THE ROCHESTER-MONROE ANTI-POVERTY INITIATIVE AT UNITED WAY (RMAPI), IN 2015, FORMED SIX WORKGROUPS INCLUDING HEALTH & NUTRITION, EDUCATION, HOUSING, JOBS, JUSTICE SYSTEM AND SAFE NEIGHBORHOODS WITH CROSS-SECTION REPRESENTATION INCLUDING COMMUNITY MEMBERS. RECOMMENDATIONS FROM THE HEALTH AND NUTRITION WORK GROUP CENTERED AROUND FOOD ACCESS, SCREENING FOR FOOD INSECURITY, FOOD LITERACY, AND PREVENTING AND ADDRESSING TRAUMA ACROSS THE LIFESPAN (INCLUDING EMPOWERING EVERY WOMAN IN HER SEXUAL AND REPRODUCTIVE CHOICES.)

201901349349310300,160743209,"PART V, SECTION B, LINE 11 - ADDRESSING THE NEEDS IDENTIFIED IN THE CHNA","THE CHIW STUDIED DATA FROM A VARIETY OF SOURCES; THE DETAILS OF WHICH ARE EXPLAINED IN THEIR ENTIRETY WITHIN THE COMMUNITY HEALTH NEEDS ASSESSMENT (CHNA). IN SHORT, THE WORKGROUP EXTENSIVELY REVIEWED THE NEW YORK STATE PREVENTION AGENDA WITH PARTICULAR INTEREST IN THE COUNTY LEVEL DASHBOARDS. THE CHIW GROUP EXAMINED AREAS IN WHICH MONROE COUNTY WAS IDENTIFIED AS WORSE THAN NEW YORK STATE AS A WHOLE OR IN WHICH MONROE COUNTY WAS NOT PREVIOUSLY ABLE TO MEET THE PREVENTION AGENDA TARGET. ADDITIONALLY, THE GROUP LOOKED FOR NEW OR EMERGING TROUBLESOME HEALTH TRENDS THAT MAY NOT HAVE BEEN IDENTIFIED AS A PREVENTION AGENDA TARGET. THIRTEEN AREAS OF PARTICULAR CONCERN WERE IDENTIFIED AND WERE PRIORITIZED ACCORDING TO WHERE THE COMMUNITY HAD THE GREATEST POTENTIAL FOR MAKING THE MOST IMPACT WITHIN THE 3-6 YEAR TIMEFRAME. THE FOLLOWING HEALTH NEEDS WERE IDENTIFIED AND PRIORITIES SELECTED: Selected: Tobacco Use Chronic Disease Care Childhood Health Unplanned Pregnancy Substance Abuse Additional areas of concern: Obesity STD morbidity Colorectal Cancer Adverse childhood experiences Violence Suicide Premature Birth Teen pregnancy INTERVENTIONS WERE PLANNED AROUND THE SELECTED AREAS OF TOBACCO CESSATION, CHRONIC DISEASE MANAGEMENT, CHILDHOOD HEALTH, UNPLANNED PREGNANCY AND SUBSTANCE ABUSE. THE OTHER AREAS OF CONCERN WERE NOT ADDRESSED IN THE IMPROVEMENT PLAN, PRIMARILY BECAUSE OF LIMITED RESOURCES, LACK OF FUNDING AND TIME, AS WELL AS AVOIDING MISSION CREEP FOR THE HOSPITALS. OBESITY, ALTHOUGH A MAJOR PROBLEM IN OUR COMMUNITY WAS NOT SELECTED BECAUSE THE CHIW WAS NOT CLEAR ON AN EFFECTIVE INTERVENTION GIVEN THE 3-YEAR IMPLEMENTATION PERIOD. COLORECTAL CANCER SCREENINGS ARE BEING ADDRESSED THROUGH THE CANCER SERVICES DEPARTMENT WITHIN THE CENTER FOR COMMUNITY HEALTH, AND ONLY IMPACTS A SMALLER SUBSET OF THE POPULATION. ADVERSE CHILDHOOD EXPRIENCES, VIOLENCE AND SUICIDE PREVENTION ALL CENTER AROUND MENTAL HEALTH WHICH IS THE PRIMARY FOCUS OF THE DSRIP INITIATIVE IN OUR COMMUNITY, AND VIOLENCE PREVENTION WAS THOUGHT TO BE BEYOND THE MISSION OF THE HOSPITALS AT THIS TIME. STDS, PREMATURE BIRTHS AND TEEN PREGNANCIES SOMEWHAT OVERLAP WITH THE UNPLANNED PREGNANCY PRIORITY AREA THAT WAS SELECTED. EDUCATION AROUND AVOIDING RISKY SEXUAL BEHAVIOR, AS RECOMMENDED TO ADDRESS UNPLANNED PREGNANCY, WILL ALSO IMPACT THESE AREAS OF CONCERN. OF COURSE, WITH UNLIMITED RESOURCES, WE WOULD ADDRESS ALL THESE AREAS, BUT UNFORTUNATELY WE NEED TO PRIORITIZE FOR THE GIVEN TIME PERIOD. THE HOSPITAL IS ADDRESSING THE SIGNIFICANT NEEDS IDENTIFIED IN THE 2016 CHNA THROUGH MANY INTERVENTIONS DESCRIBED IN THE IMPLEMENTATION STRATEGY. PROGRESS ON THE IMPLEMENTATION STRATEGY IS WIDELY AVAILABLE TO THE PUBLIC AND CAN BE FOUND ON THE SAME WEBSITE AS THE CHNA: (https://www.urmc.rochester.edu/community.aspx). TOBACCO USE: IMPLEMENTATION EFFORTS CONTINUE FOR SMOKING CESSATION, AT THE TIME OF THE CHNA 2016, UNIVERSITY OF ROCHESTER STRONG AND HIGHLAND WERE WORKING TO ADOPT AN OPT-TO-QUIT POLICY WHERE IDENTIFIED SMOKERS WILL BE AUTOMATICALLY REFERRED TO THE NY STATE QUIT LINE. EMR CHANGES WERE IN PROCESS AND THE POLICY HAS BEEN IMPLEMENTED AT STRONG HIGHLAND. THE OBJECTIVES FOR THIS FOCUS AREA INCLUDE: Objective 1.1: UR STRONG will enact a tobacco cessation policy that incorporates the opt-to-quit program and will implement that policy thereby electronically linking tobacco using patients to the NYS quit line. Objective 1.3: UR STRONG WILL WORK TO decrease the percent of women who smoke during pregnancy from 11% of births (2013 vital statistics) to less than 10% of births, and to especially concentrate on those women who receive Medicaid baseline 20% of births were smoking during pregnancy. UR STRONG AGREES WITH THE CONCEPT OF REFERRING ALL TOBACCO USERS TO THE NY STATE QUITLINE VIA THE EMR. IMPLEMENTATION EFFORTS FOR THE 2016-18 TIME PERIOD WILL INCLUDE ESTABLISHING THE EMR CHANGES, ASSURING PRIVATE TRANSFER OF DATA TO THE QUITLINE, ESTABLISHING FEEDBACK TO THE REFERRING PHYSICIANS AND EVALUATING THE INCREASE IN REFERRALS TO THE QUITLINE. UR STRONG IS ALSO ADDRESSING SMOKING DURING PREGNANCY BY LINKING PATIENTS WITHIN THE BABY LOVE PROGRAM WITH THE MOMMY AND ME TOBACCO FREE PROGRAM TO INCREASE CESSATION. CHRONIC DISEASE CARE: OUR WORK HERE FOCUSES ON HYPERTENTION CONTROL. TO ADDRESS BLOOD PRESSURE CONTROL, UR CONTINUES TO BE AN ACTIVE MEMBER OF THE ROCHESTER BUSINESS ALLIANCE (CHAMBER OF COMMERCE) HEALTH CARE PLANNING TEAM THAT MEETS WEEKLY AND IS FOCUSING ON HYPERTENSION. UR HAS MANAGED A COMMUNITY HEALTH WORKER PROGRAM THAT CONCENTRATED ON BLOOD PRESSURE CONTROL BUT IS NO LONGER ACTIVE, CONTRIBUTES TO A REGIONAL REGISTRY OF HYPERTENSIVE PATIENTS, HELPS FUND IMPROVEMENT INITIATIVES, AND PARTICIPATES IN THE PRACTICE IMPROVEMENT CONSULTANT PROGRAM TO INCREASE CONTROL RATES. THE OBJECTIVES FOR THIS FOCUS AREA INCLUDE: Objective 2.1: By December 2018, decrease the disparity among hypertensive residents in the local registry who have their blood pressure in control by increasing the control rate among Monroe County African Americans [58.8% and Latinos (61.5%) compared to Whites (75.4%)] Objective 2.2: Increase the control rate for hypertensive patients who also have diabetes ADDRESSING DISPARITY IN HYPERTENSION CONTROL RATES WILL INCLUDE COLLABORATION WITH THE DSRIP CULTURAL COMPETENCY WORKGROUP AS WELL AS THE REGISTRY REPORTING FUNCTION. CHILDHOOD HEALTH: UR STRONG IS WORKING TO IMPROVING CHILDHOOD HEALTH BY FOLLOWING THE APA GUIDELINE TO SCREEN ALL CHILDREN FOR FOOD INSECURITY AT WELL CHILD VISITS. THE OBJECTIVE FOR THIS FOCUS AREA IS: Objective 4.1: Decrease the percent of children living in food insecure households from 20.5% (Feeding America, 2014) while also striving to decrease the percent of adults who experienced food insecurity in the past year worried or stressed about having enough money to buy nutritious meals (EBRFSS2013-4) from 23% in Monroe County. AT LEASE ONE PEDIATRIC CLINIC IN STRONG IS CURRENTLY SCREENING FOR FOOD INSECURITY AND UR STRONG COMMITS TO ENHANCING THIS PROCESS WITH ACTIVE REFERRAL AS WELL AS EXPANDING THE MODEL TO OTHER CLINICS WITHIN UR AS WELL AS WITHIN OTHER HOSPITALS AND OFFICES IN MONROE COUNTY. WE WILL ALSO ASSURE THAT RESOURCES TO FOOD FOR FAMILIES WHO POSITIVELY SCREEN FOR FOOD INSECURITY ARE KNOWN AND ACCESSIBLE AND UPDATED. UNPLANNED PREGNANCY: THE CHIW AND UR STRONG ARE COMMITTED TO REDUCING THE UNPLANNED PREGNANCY RATE IN MONROE COUNTY AND TO ADDRESSING THE SIGNIFICANT DISPARITIES THAT EXIST BY RACE, ZIP CODE AND ECONOMIC STATUS. WE HAVE THE FOLLOWING OBJECTIVES: Objective 3.1: By December 2018, reduce significant barriers to the use of LARC (Long-Acting Reversible Contraception), particularly among at-risk women of reproductive age Objective 3.2: By December 2018, increase the number of youth reached with evidence-based sexual health education (baseline measure of current youth being reached is needed) PRIMARY TO THE BARRIERS TO THE USE OF LARC IS THE MEDICAID REIMBURSEMENT RULES IN NEW YORK THAT DO NOT ACCOUNT FOR PLACEMENT OF LARC IN MEDICAID MANAGED CARE PARTICIPANTS (AT THE TIME OF THE CHNA/IMPROVEMENT PLANNING). UR STRONG IS COMMITTED TO CHANGING THIS RULE AND ASSURING THE MEDICAID CLIENTS CAN RECEIVE LARC AT DELIVERY IF DESIRED. THIS RULE WAS CHANGED IN 2017 AND STRONG ASSURED THAT POST PARTUM LARC WAS REIMBURSED FOR MEDICAID PATIENTS. OTHER BARRIERS TO BE ADDRESSED INCLUDE LACK OF EDUCATION AND LACK OF TRAINING ON INSERTION. IN ADDITION TO LOGISTICAL BARRIERS TO LARC, UNPLANNED PREGNANCY CAN BE REDUCED BY WORKING TO EDUCATE YOUTH IN OUR COMMUNITY AROUND SAFE SECUARY HEALTH AND GOAL SETTING, ETC. UR AND THE CHIW WILL WORK WITH COMMUNITY AGENCIES, PARTICULARY THE METRO COUNCIL FOR TEEN POTENTIAL. SUSTANCE ABUSE: UR STRONG WILL JOIN OTHER LEAD AGENCIES TO ADDRESS THE OPIOID EPIDEMIC PLAGUING OUR COMMUNITY. ADDRESSING THIS PROBLEM HAS MANY PREVENTION STRATEGIES FROM PREVENTING SUBSTANCE ABUSE TO DECREASING DEATHS DUE TO OPIOID OVERDOSE AND TREATMENT FOR THOSE WHO ARE ADDICTED. OUR OBJECTIVE FOCUSES ON DEATHS DUE TO OVERDOSE: Objective 5.1: By December 2018, decrease the number of deaths due to opioid overdose from 69 in 2015 (Medical Examiners report of 2015). THERE IS A MONROE COUNTY TASK FORCE ADDRESSING OPIOID MISUSE AND UR STRONG COMMITS TO SENDING REPRESENTATION TO THE TASK FORCE AND SUPPORTING ANY PLANS THAT COME FROM THAT GROUP OF EXPERTS. IN ADDITION, THERE IS NOW A URMC OPIOID TASK FORCE THAT MEETS MONTHLY WITH SUBCOMMITTEES CONCENTRATING ON PREVENTION, IDENTIFICATION AND TREATMENT OF OPIOID MISUSE.

ONE OF OUR PRIMARY PARTNERS IN THIS ENDEAVOR WAS THE HEALTH COLLABORATIVE, A NONPROFIT ORGANIZATION THAT WORKS WITH ITS MEMBER HOSPITALS ON HEALTHCARE IMPROVEMENT PROJECTS AND SHARES BEST PRACTICES. THE HEALTH COLLABORATIVE BROUGHT 20 HOSPITALS TOGETHER, INCLUDING THE CHRIST HOSPITAL, AND LED THE EFFORT TO BETTER UNDERSTAND THE HEALTH NEEDS OF THE COMMUNITY. ALONG WITH THE DATA PRODUCED BY THE HEALTH COLLABORATIVE, WE ANALYZED A NUMBER OF DATA SOURCES INCLUDING PUBLIC HEALTH DATA, HEALTH RISK FACTOR SURVEYS, SOCIOECONOMIC NEEDS ASSESSMENTS, ENVIRONMENTAL STANDARDS AND EXISTING PROGRAMS THAT HAD BEEN DEVELOPED FOR RESIDENTS IN THE GREATER CINCINNATI REGION. IN ADDITION, THE CHRIST HOSPITAL ALSO SOUGHT TO REVIEW ANY WRITTEN COMMENTS RECEIVED REGARDING COMMUNITY HEALTH NEEDS IN THE PREVIOUS ASSESSMENT. TO DATE, TO THE BEST OF OUR KNOWLEDGE, NO WRITTEN COMMENTS HAVE BEEN RECEIVED AND, THUS, WRITTEN COMMENTS WERE NOT AVAILABLE FOR CONSIDERATION IN THIS IMPLEMENTATION STRATEGY. THE PREVALENT HEALTH CONCERNS IDENTIFIED IN THE HAMILTON COUNTY AREA THROUGH THIS NEEDS ASSESSMENT INCLUDE: - ACCESS TO CARE - DIABETES AND OBESITY - INFANT MORTALITY - LUNG CANCER - MENTAL HEALTH THROUGH A COLLABORATIVE AND WELL-THOUGHT-OUT PROCESS, THE CHRIST HOSPITAL AND ITS COMMUNITY PARTNERS HAVE REVIEWED THE MOST PREVALENT HEALTH CONCERNS IN HAMILTON COUNTY AND HAVE ESTABLISHED A COURSE OF ACTION. THIS PLAN FOCUSES ON PROGRAMS, RESEARCH AND EDUCATION THAT SPECIFICALLY TARGET SOME OF THE MOST PRESSING HEALTH CONCERNS FACING THE RESIDENTS OF HAMILTON COUNTY WITH THE HOPE OF MAKING MEASURABLE IMPACT ON THE HEALTH OF OUR COMMUNITY. WE RECOGNIZE THAT COMMUNITY HEALTH NEEDS ARE BROAD AND COMPREHENSIVE, AND WHILE WE BRING OUR EXPERTISE AND LEADERSHIP TO ADDRESSING SELECT NEEDS, WE ALSO UNDERSTAND THAT ONE ENTITYS EXPERTISE CANNOT BE BROAD ENOUGH TO BE THE SOLE ANSWER. BECAUSE OF THIS, COLLABORATIONS AND PARTNERSHIPS ARE KEY TO MEETING THOSE NEEDS, AND WE PARTNER WITH COMMUNITY ORGANIZATIONS THAT COMPLEMENT OUR RESOURCES. THIS IMPLEMENTATION PLAN WAS APPROVED BY THE CHRIST HOSPITAL BOARD OF DIRECTORS IN TAX YEAR 2016. TO INCREASE ACCESS TO CARE, THE CHRIST HOSPITAL WILL SEEK TO DEVELOP A COMMUNITY PARAMEDICINE PROGRAM IN PARTNERSHIP WITH THE CINCINNATI FIRE DEPARTMENT THAT PROVIDES POST-ACUTE CHECKS TO PATIENTS WITH A HIGH RISK OF REHOSPITALIZATION. PRIMARY COLLABORATION WILL BE WITH THE CINCINNATI FIRE DEPARTMENT, WHO WILL PROVIDE THE COMMUNITY PARAMEDICS, VEHICLES, AND EQUIPMENT TO DELIVER MEDICAL SERVICES TO PATIENTS. MEDICAL SERVICES WILL INCLUDE IN-PERSON HEALTH ASSESSMENTS OF PATIENTS IN THEIR HOMES, COMPLIANCE WITH DISCHARGE ORDERS AND MEDICATIONS, PATIENT SAFETY AT HOME, AND MONITORING FOR ANY CHANGES THAT COULD RESULT IN PREVENTABLE HOSPITAL READMISSION. SECONDARY COLLABORATION WILL OCCUR WITH LOCAL SOCIAL SERVICES SUCH AS THE UNITED WAY AND COUNCIL ON AGING, WHO WILL SERVE AS A REFERRAL SOURCE TO PROVIDE NON-MEDICAL RESOURCES NEEDED TO IMPROVE PATIENT INDEPENDENCE, EXPERIENCE, AND OUTCOMES. DIABETES AND EDUCATION SERVICES AT THE CHRIST HOSPITAL PROVIDE EDUCATION FOR BOTH BLOOD SUGAR CONTROL AND OBESITY WITHIN THE DIABETIC POPULATION, RESULTING IN IMPROVED HEALTH METRICS AND REDUCED COMPLICATIONS. THE DIABETES AND EDUCATION SERVICES WILL HOST CLASSES AND EMPLOY SPECIALLY TRAINED NURSES AND REGISTERED DIETICIANS. THE DIABETES AND EDUCATION SERVICES CURRENTLY HAVE OVER 7.0 FULL-TIME EMPLOYEES (""FTES"") WHO SUPPORT PATIENTS WITH DIABETES. THIS INCLUDES INPATIENT AND OUTPATIENT NURSES AND DIETICIANS WHO ARE CERTIFIED DIABETES EDUCATORS. THEY WILL CONTINUE TO USE THESE EMPLOYEES TO HOST CLASSES, PROVIDE ONE-ON-ONE CONSULTATIONS AND CONTINUED SUPPORT FOR PATIENTS NEEDING ASSISTANCE IN MANAGING THEIR DIABETES. ADDITIONALLY, THESE NURSES AND DIETICIANS HELP COORDINATE THE EFFORTS OF BOTH INPATIENT AND OUTPATIENT EDUCATION. THEY VERIFY AMERICAN DIABETES ASSOCIATION COMPLIANCE AS IT RELATES TO THE SUBJECT OF CLASSES AND INFORMATION PROVIDED TO PATIENTS. CLASSES PROVIDED BY THESE INDIVIDUALS INCLUDE SPECIFIC SUBJECT MATTER SUCH AS: GESTATIONAL DIABETES, PREDIABETES, MEDICAL NUTRITION THERAPY AND DIABETES SELF-MANAGEMENT TRAINING. PARTICIPATION IN OPPORTUNITIES TO EDUCATE PATIENTS AND THE COMMUNITY ON INFANT MORTALITY AND SAFE SLEEP PRACTICES WILL LEAD TO SAFE SLEEP COMPLIANCE FOR FAMILIES WITH NEW BABIES. CURRENTLY, 100% OF PARENTS WITHIN THE CHRIST HOSPITAL ARE PRACTICING SAFE SLEEP TECHNIQUES. THE GOAL WAS MET BY FISCAL YEAR 2018. THE CHRIST HOSPITAL WILL UTILIZE A COORDINATED TEAM OF EDUCATORS, NURSES, NURSE PRACTITIONERS AND MEDICAL DIRECTORS TO IMPROVE EDUCATION REGARDING INFANT MORTALITY AND DISSEMINATE THAT INFORMATION IN A TIMELY MANNER. THIS TEAM WILL ALSO COLLABORATIVELY WORK WITH CRADLE CINCINNATI, THE MARCH OF DIMES, THE NATIONAL INSTITUTE FOR HEALTH AND THE CINCINNATI HEALTH DEPARTMENT AS WELL AS CRIBS FOR KIDS TO ASSIST FAMILIES IN NEED AND EDUCATE THE PUBLIC AND HEALTHCARE PROVIDERS ALIKE. THIS WILL OCCUR IN THE HOSPITAL SETTING AS WELL AS IN CHILDBIRTH EDUCATION CLASSES AND IN VARIOUS COMMUNITY OUTREACH SETTINGS. THE PARTNERSHIPS WITH THESE ORGANIZATIONS ASSIST US IN ACQUIRING EDUCATIONAL MATERIALS FOR STAFF AS WELL AS FOR THE PUBLIC, AND ASSIST US IN ACQUIRING SUPPLIES AS WELL. THE CHRIST HOSPITAL WILL INCREASE THE NUMBER OF LOW-DOSE CT LUNG CANCER SCREENINGS IN OUR PRIMARY CARE OFFICES AND MONITOR THE PERCENT OF PATIENT SCREENED. CURRENTLY THE NUMBER OF LOW-DOSE CT LUNG CANCER SCREENINGS IS 27 PER YEAR, WITH THE GOAL OF IMPROVING THAT TO 52 PER YEAR. THERE WILL ALSO BE UTILIZATION OF THE LUNG NODULE PROGRAM TO MONITOR PATIENTS AT HIGH RISK FOR LUNG CANCER, AND TO FOLLOW HIGH RISK PATIENTS REGULARLY TO FACILITATE EARLY DETECTION FOR THOSE WHO DEVELOP LUNG CANCER. THE CHRIST HOSPITAL WILL IMPLEMENT THESE STRATEGIES WITH THE COLLABORATION OF ORGANIZATIONS SUCH AS: AMERICAN LUNG ASSOCIATION, LUNG CANCER ALLIANCE, AMERICAN LUNG ASSOCIATION, CANCER FAMILY CARE, CANCER SUPPORT COMMUNITY, AMERICAN CANCER SOCIETY, NATIONAL CANCER INSTITUTE, NATIONAL COALITION FOR CANCER SURVIVORSHIP AND NATIONAL COMPREHENSIVE CANCER NETWORK. THE CHRIST HOSPITAL WILL WORK TO CREATE A COMPREHENSIVE OUTPATIENT PROGRAM THAT ADDRESSES THE NEEDS OF PATIENTS WITH MENTAL HEALTH CONDITIONS. THIS PROGRAM WILL INCLUDE EDUCATIONAL SERVICES, FACILITATION OF SUPPORT GROUPS AND MORE SPECIFIC SERVICES TO ADDRESS MENTAL HEALTH CONCERNS. THIS PROGRAM WILL ALLOW THE CHRIST HOSPITAL TO TREAT THE MENTAL HEALTH POPULATION WITH CARE APPROPRIATE FOR THEIR CONDITIONS. THIS TARGETED CARE WILL ALSO CONTRIBUTE TO THE OVERALL UNDERSTANDING OF MENTAL HEALTH NEEDS, HELPING TO DEBUNK MYTHS AND MISUNDERSTANDINGS. A TEAM OF COORDINATED PRACTITIONERS, INCLUDING CLINICAL THERAPISTS, NURSE PRACTITIONERS, PSYCHIATRISTS AND MEDICAL DIRECTORS WILL WORK TO IMPROVE ACCESS TO MENTAL HEALTH SERVICES FOR PATIENTS AND MAKE CARE RECEIVED MORE COMPREHENSIVE. OUR ONGOING WORK HAS YIELDED FAVORABLE RESULTS. ACROSS ALL SECTORS PROGRESS IS BEING MADE TO MEET OUR GOALS. SPECIFICALLY, THE DIABETES CENTER PATIENTS BMI AVERAGE AND A1C SCORES HAVE DECREASED FROM FY15. THERE WAS 100% PARTICIPATION IN SAFE SLEEP PRACTICES AND TECHNIQUES IN THE LAST 4 QUARTERS OF FY 2017. THIS IS AN 18% INCREASE OVER FY 2015 QUARTER 4 REPORT AND HAS EXCEED GOAL BY 3%. ADDITIONALLY, THERE HAS BEEN AN INCREASE IN THE NUMBER OF LOW DOSE CT SCREENINGS PROVIDED BY OUR PRIMARY CARE OFFICES. ALTHOUGH SOME DATA IS NOT REFLECTIVE, DUE TO A LAG IN OUR SYSTEM, A MORE ACCURATE REFLECTION OF OUR WORK WILL BE AVAILABLE CLOSER TO THE END OF OUR FISCAL YEAR. LASTLY, a partner to help establish the hospital's comprehensive outpatient mental health program has been identified and significant efforts are underway to build the program."

At Rush, the process was led by the Center for Community Health Equity (www.healthequitychicago.org), coordinated by the Office of Community Engagement, and overseen by the Building Healthy Communities Steering Committee (which has transformed into the Community Health Equity leadership group in 2017). First, the Rush team reviewed its initial CHNA reports from the previous iteration, benchmarked it against others produced three years ago in the region and assessed whether the reports contained the right content to enable us to make an impact. We sought to include more stakeholders in our process of developing the CHNA. We began by gathering input from community members as well as from Rush faculty, students and staff (especially those who live in our service area). We sought perspective from our colleagues at health systems and public health entities in the area; community leaders and members; our colleagues in the Center for Community Health Equity based at Rush University and DePaul University; and those participating in the Alliance for Health Equity (formerly the Health Impact Collaborative of Cook County (HICCC) and the Healthy Chicago Hospital Collaborative, as the two collaborates merged in 2017 - the lead for the CHNA was the former). The Alliance for Health Equity is a collaborative group convened by the Illinois Public Health Institute and consisted at the time of 26 hospitals, seven health departments and more than 100 community-based organizations working together on a joint CHNA process. As described, this group has since grown with the merging of HICCC and the Healthy Chicago Hospital Collaborative. As we developed our recommended actions for this iteration of the CHNA, we again sought input from our key stakeholders. To see a list of those who engaged in this process and Rush worked with at the time, please view our CHNA online and proceed to Appendix 2 on Page 73."

There have been seven work-groups formed around the CHIP strategies consisting of Rush leaders, community partners, and community residents in order to collaboratively tackle these with a collective impact approach. Our CHIP is as follows, as well highlights of some of our efforts:Goal 1: Reduce inequities caused by the social, economic and structural determinants of health a.Improve educational attainment Rush has been working to improve educational attainment through long standing programs such as our partnership with Malcolm X College, Richard T. Crane Medical Preparatory High School, and the K-12 program in affiliation with our Science and Math Excellence Network (SAME) program. Most recently, Rush has made strategic decisions to align these programs under one organizational effort - REACH, the Rush Education and Career Hub.

In FY18, the programs served more than 1,400 students, 300 parents and more than 51 teachers.b.Identify, measure and mitigate the social determinants of health among those at risk - particularly children, young adults and people with chronic illness.During the fiscal year, Rush implemented a screening tool to identify non-medical barriers to good health, such as food insecurity, homelessness, lack of utilities, transportation barriers, and lack of primary care/insurance. This screening tool was implemented in the Rush University Hospital Emergency Department, primary care settings, and community based settings. Patients screened for these social determinants of health (SDOH) were connected to services via a partnership with NowPow, a locally-based, resource directory company which provides curated, personalized resources that are shared with patients. During the pilot this past fiscal year, we screened 928 patients in the ED of which 291 were identified with need referred to social and other services. This led to a commitment to expand based on demonstrated need.Rush joined the Alliance for Health Equity (AHE) early on and is a member of the steering committee. In addition, a Rush representative chairs several work-groups, including the Food Security and Social Determinants workgroups. Rush is particularly invested in helping guide AHE to focus on our identified needs and improvements. Rush also has a leadership role data, policy, and trauma informed care work groups. Goal 2: Improve access to mental and behavioral health services a.Address psychological trauma through screening tools and referral programs in school-based health centers and faith-based organizationsRush is working to address the mental and behavioral health needs of our patients and communities by having social work services offered to our primary care, inpatient, and emergency department patients. The College of Nursing and Rush Community Based Practices offers mental health services in the community at Simpson Academy for Young Women and the College of Nursing Faculty Practice sites. Rush offers mental/behavioral health services through the Health Legacy Program for Women.School Based Students seen in the SBHCs are receiving age-appropriate risk screening and evaluation for mental health issues. Those identified with mental health issues are referred for in-SBHC or community-based counseling and psychiatric services. In FY18, 941 risk screenings were completed, resulting in 175 referrals for additional mental health services. Of those 175, 116 were successfully linked to care. Among the 116 are 18 pregnant teens who have been referred to home visiting services through the ACEs in Pregnancy program. Through a partnership with the Rush Department of Psychiatry, psychiatric services, provided both in-SBHC and by telehealth visits, launched in January 2018. Faith Based A total of 25 congregants from 7 partner churches were trained in Mental Health First Aid, which teaches lay people how to help someone who is developing a mental health problem or experiencing a mental health crisis. Further, ninety-five (95) congregants were trained in Bridges of Hope Mental Health Awareness to educate faith communities about mental illness so that they can create stronger safety nets and welcoming communities of faith for people affected by mental illness. Grief workshops were also conducted with 19 congregants from 7 West Side partner churches to provide tools for dealing with loss. b.Expand access to other screenings and servicesThrough a partnership with the Rush Department of Psychiatry launched in January of 2018, Rush provided psychiatric services, in-SBHCs and by telehealth visits. From January through June 2018, 116 screenings resulted in 18 student referrals for psychiatric care. Nearly two thousand hours of education that focused on trauma, mental health, identification of mental health issues, and skill building for resilience was provided to 825 students through school outreach activities Goal 3: Prevent and reduce chronic disease by focusing on risk factors a.Reduce risk factors through assessments, disease management programs and improved access to healthy food The Food Surplus Project was created to alleviate food insecurity in the greater community by redistributing unused food from hospitals to local food pantries and other community based partners. This is a collaborative community effort that arose from an ROPH nurse's leadership program at Dominican University. Representatives from several local organizations, including ROPH, the Oak Park-River Forest Day School, Oak Park-River Forest High School, Thrive Counseling Center and the Oak Park-River Forest Food Pantry, worked together to create the infrastructure of the program and implement strategies to reduce food insecurity. Rush has provided over 25,000 free meals to the organizations. In FY18, 741 unique Rush employees participated in this program. ROPH's community wellness program screens and connects individuals to resources for at Oak Park River Forest Food Pantry, a nursing led screening program. It provides free educational seminars and fitness classes, which are designed to help community members lead healthier lives and address chronic disease. Healthy Motivations provided education on topics such as heart and vascular disease, preventive health, depression and more. FY2018, the program provided services to over 350 women and families. The Metropolitan Chicago Breast Cancer Task Force launched in 2007 as an independent nonprofit based at Rush, with the goal of reducing the disparity in breast cancer deaths between black women and white women in Chicago. After these initiatives launched, the disparities began to decrease. In addition, ROPH provides free mammograms to uninsured or underinsured women who live in Oak Park, River Forest and Proviso Township. In the past fiscal year, Rush has been working on standardizing its approach to tobacco control and cessation per our defined needs and our work with the Chicago Department of Public Health's (CDPH) Healthy Chicago 2.0 Chicago Quits grant in partnership with Respiratory Health Association. Rush is working with West Side entities to bring Courage to Quit and Counsel to Quit, the Respiratory Health Association's tobacco cessation programming, to our west side community partners. Goal 4: Increase access to care and community services In 2016 Rush established a formal partnership with CommunityHealth, the largest free clinic in the City of Chicago. Rush attending physicians, medical residents and students volunteer their time and skills through rotations to provide medical, dental, mental health and free prescription services at CommunityHealth. The formal partnership serves as a way to better connect patients to primary care and insurance. If the patients need insurance or primary care, they are referred to Rush's Transitional Care Program (TCP) where patient navigators determine the best place of service for the patient. CommunityHealth offers health services ranging from routine physicals and immunization programs to a full laboratory and pharmacy as well as free services for medications and dental. In FY18, 279 patients have been referred to CommunityHealth."

HSHS St. John's Hospital is committed to addressing community health needs in collaboration with local organizations and other area health care institutions. In response to the FY2015 CHNA, the hospital planned, implemented and evaluated strategies to address the top four identified community health needs: pediatric asthma, mental health, childhood obesity and access to care. The FY2018 CHNA built on that collaboration, and actively sought input from a cross section of community stakeholders with the goal of reaching consensus on priorities to mutually focus human, material and financial resources. The external advisory committee was used as the primary stakeholder group to review and force rank data. During three meetings, community stakeholders were asked to review data presented and provide additional sources for priority areas not listed. The external advisory committee also helped develop the community survey tool and outcomes and recommendations on the final priorities. The external advisory committee also helped identify community assets and gaps which were weighed when considering the magnitude and feasibility of the priority areas. Lastly, their feedback was instrumental in developing the implementation plan. Members of the CHNA external advisory council were chosen based on their unique expertise and experience, informed perspectives and community involvement. The CHNA external Advisory Council members were responsible for: offering insight into issues affecting existing data; identifying local community assets and gaps and offering advice on which issues are the highest priority. The University of Illinois Office of Survey Research (UIS SRO) circulated an electronic survey on behalf of the core group in January 2018. In total 1,079 individuals completed the survey. UIS SRO analyzed and provided the results to the external and internal advisory teams. The results were used to guide further discussion around final priority selection. Focus groups were conducted around the final priority areas selected and helped determine the implementation plan adopted by the board of directors. More information about the focus groups can be found in the implementation plan document. HSHS and St. John's Hospital are committed to promoting and defending human dignity, caring for persons living in poverty and other vulnerable persons, promoting the common good and stewarding resources. We believe the CHNA process must be informed by input from the poor and vulnerable populations we seek to serve. To ensure the needs of these groups were adequately represented, we included representatives from such organizations as noted below. These organizations serve the under-resourced in our community, including low-income seniors, children living in poverty and families who struggle with shelter and food. Representatives of these organizations have extensive knowledge and quantifiable data regarding the needs of their service populations. Actively including these organizations in the CHNA process was critical to ensure that needs of the most vulnerable persons in our communities were addressed in the CHNA: -Gail O'Neil and Jim Stone: Sangamon County Department of Public Health (core group)* -Kimberly Luz and Megan Williams: HSHS St. John's Hospital (core group)* -Paula Gramley, Mike Curtis, Kevin England: Memorial Medical Center (core group)* -John Kelker and Katrina Hayes: United Way of Central Illinois* -Mr. Murphy: Springfield Urban League* -Jason Wind: Springfield School District 186* -Deputy Chief Kenneth Scarlette: Springfield Police Department* -Dr. Wendy El Amin: SIU School of Medicine* -Dr. Janet Albers: SIU Center for Family Medicine, federally qualified health center (FQHC)* -Steve Roach: Catholic Charities* -Heather Burton: Central Counties Health Centers, FQHC* -Chris Hembrough: Greater Springfield Chamber of Commerce -Michael Phelon: Lincoln Land Community College Open Doors Mentorship Program* -Jan Gambach: Memorial Behavioral Health* -Sharmin Doering: Sangamon County Department of Community Resources* *Organizations that serve medically underserved, low-income and minority populations."

The organization's most recently conducted CHNA was completed for the fiscal year ended 6/30/18. The related implementation strategy that was adopted is for the period July 1, 2018 through June 30, 2021. The information below pertains to the 3rd year cycle of the implementation strategy from the CHNA conducted in the fiscal year 2015. Outcomes of the FY2015 CHNA Process: ACCESS TO CARE I. Enos Park Access to Care Collaborative: St. John's Hospital partnered with Memorial Medical Center and Southern Illinois University's Center for Family Medicine, a federally qualified health center, to develop a community health worker program to increase access to health care and coordination of care for residents of Enos Park Neighborhood. Data collected in the FY2015 CHNA indicated a high incidence of unmanaged chronic conditions such as hypertension, diabetes, pediatric asthma and mental illness. Data also pointed to a higher incidence of social determinants impacting health including single parent households, unsafe housing, violence and crime, poverty and lack of access to healthcare and healthcare coverage. Outcomes: At the end of year two* of the three-year access to care program, the program had 300 clients enrolled in the community health worker program. Services rendered include basic needs and health care access. Program outcomes measured an individual's increase in access to care in addition to their progression to self-sufficiency. The following increases in standards of self-sufficiency were reported at the end of year two: employment by 69%, income by 52%, access to nutritive food by 31% and safe housing by 74%. Summer engagement camps provided mentorship and skills training to 89 youth aged 9-14. In moving this initiative to sustainability, a new clinic model at a local federally qualified health center was developed that established a strong multi-disciplinary team approach to addressing determinants and inequities in the care of the most vulnerable. The clinic has a 90% show rate and a high level of billing by both the primary care provider and mental health specialists. The clinic grew from twice per month to six times per month due to the demand and reception of the clinic model by clients. In FY2019, the community health worker model is being expanded to at least one neighborhood in Springfield where current data and focus groups have suggested the need is great. *Data for year three will not be available until November 2018. Updates to the 2018 CHNA Outcomes Appendix will be made at that time. II. Beyond the NICU: The early life experiences of a child have tremendous effects on their physical and mental development. Unfortunately, children living in poverty are more likely to have parents without a high school education and less likely to be raised in a nurturing or educationally stimulating environment prior to entering kindergarten. Preterm birth disproportionally affects socially disadvantaged pregnant women. As a result, prematurity is an added challenge for many infants in poverty which puts them at additional risk for poor growth and development. Outcomes: In FY18, St. John's launched the Beyond the NICU program to provide in-home follow-up and care to babies born 32 weeks. The program uses trained home health nurses to give vulnerable parents of premature children support in providing for their at-risk babies. The program also assesses and works to improve maternal mental health, infant neurodevelopment and infant musculoskeletal development. Since inception, 54 babies have been enrolled in the program. Services run 18-months, and program outcomes and measurements will be available in December 2018. To date, 70% of program families come from ZIP codes in Sangamon and Macon counties ranking high on the socio-needs index, and 64% of families live below the poverty level. Twenty percent of the babies require weekly weight checks which are done in the home, 40% of the families need diaper assistance, 15% of mothers in the program have been diagnosed with postpartum depression and are being monitored closely and contacted daily. In 13% of the homes nurses assessed the infants did not have safe sleeping arrangements. Through interventions and supply assistance that has been changed. Acting as a first responder, our home health nurses intervened in high-risk situations resulting in three DCFS cases being opened. MENTAL HEALTH: I. School-Based Behavioral Health Specialist: Increase access to mental health screening, intervention and educational services through provision of a behavioral health specialist at McClernand Elementary School. 96% of students who attend McClernand Elementary School qualify for the free lunch program, and 30% of students are considered homeless. The behavioral health specialist also worked closely with community health workers to address behavioral health needs in individuals and families in Enos Park neighborhood. Outcomes: Increased access to mental health screening, intervention and educational services for high risk, underserved elementary school students and their caregivers. In school years 2015-2016, 2016-2017 and 2017-2018; all students enrolled at McClernand Elementary School were offered a social/emotional screening. For the three-year reporting period, 1,573 screenings were completed (students were screened at the beginning of each semester). Of those screenings, 89 students were highly elevated, and 190 students were elevated. 99 students received behavioral health intervention. II. Trauma Informed Care Education and Training: Increased general medical knowledge for health, social and behavioral health colleagues to better inform them of their patient/client's current conditions and reactions. Increased general medical knowledge about Adverse Childhood Experiences (ACEs) and the Social Determinants of Health (SDH) and their impact on health outcomes. Outcomes: Beginning in FY2017, Trauma Informed Care (TIC) training was introduced to health, social and behavioral services colleagues. Since then, HSHS St. John's Hospital has provided training to 290 individuals - 153 in FY2017 and 137 in FY2018. The trainings taught professionals how to use a person's history to better inform them of the patient/client's current condition and reactions. PEDIATRIC ASTHMA Asthma Home Assessments: Create an asthma home assessment program for an eastside neighborhood, which includes subsidized housing units. According to heat maps created using St. John's ED data, there are a high number of super utilizers using the ED for unmanaged chronic conditions between the ages of 0 - 5 years old in Brandon Court and surrounding neighborhoods. St. John's partnered with SIU School of Medicine and Springfield Community Federation to create an asthma home assessment program to identify particles within the home triggering asthma attacks and/or breathing difficulties; and to develop a three-month trigger mitigation plan. Outcomes: 25 households including 30 children were enrolled in the study which provided each family with a home assessment, trigger reduction plan and weekly home visits for three months. Smoking cessation resources were provided when the assessments identified 88% of households had an adult smoker. As a result, 64% of adult smokers agreed to smoke outside and remove their outer jacket / wrap before entering the house. 100% of households received mattress and pillow covers in rooms where children slept. Additionally, all households received cleaning kits and instructions. In the post-survey, 47% of households reported they no longer mix ammonia and bleach while cleaning. The program connected two families living in substandard conditions with Land of Lincoln Legal Assistance to address non-compliant landlords. The program addressed enforcement of pest control and regular air filter changes with the housing authority in appropriate housing units. One key finding of the initiative was that asthma may be significantly under-diagnosed in low-income populations. In many cases, once the families graduated the three-month program they reported cleaner environments and the post-assessments reported better air quality in the home. The study concluded that addressing asthma triggers alone will not prevent unnecessary emergency department visits or reduce missed school days. When our community health workers worked with families to address access to care issues, specifically healthcare coverage and medical home enrollment, improvements in quality of life and client health increased. Following the study conclusion, the asthma home assessment initiative partnered with the local federal qualified health center to support a community health worker program for Springfield's eastside. This program works with families and individuals to address social determinants of health including healthcare access and provides referrals to wraparound services."

Childhood Obesity: Expand Gotta Dance initiatives to increase the number of physical activity minutes for children in school and at home as well as to develop life skills to improve a child's overall mental and emotional function. Life skills programs seek to build capacity of individuals to positively impact their lives and the lives of those around them through the actions they take. Developing life skills in childhood decreases the likelihood of risky behavior and increases the child's capability to grow into a healthy, independent adult. Developing these skills builds resilience and strengthens emotional, mental, social and physical health. Outcomes: A school component called, Gotta Dance and Move More, was created to get dance as physical activity in the schools. This program was combined with an existing program - Jump Start - to add at least 12 minutes of non-PE physical activity time to every child's school day. Teachers were provided with 'brain breaks' which are 30 to 90 second physical activities to do with children throughout the school day in to a twelve-minute activity done at the beginning of the school day. Additionally, classes were added to the free weekly dance program, Gotta Dance. The addition of classes provided opportunity to increase capacity and serve 200 kids annually. In the last three years, we have held a combined 21-weekly dance classes for 527 children in first through eighth grades. Through pre- and post-test reporting, students and parents reported a 75% increase in the child's self-confidence, 33% increase in self-esteem; 68% of participants reported exercising more frequently at home. While this program is not geared toward weight loss, the increase in consistent physical activity led to healthy weight loss in 25% or program participants, and 62% of participants reported making healthier food choices. Other positive outcomes included: teacher-reported improved behavior in the classroom, decreased incidences of bullying in one school, positive leadership development in middle-school children and improved focus during class time. Needs identified in the FY2015 CHNA that are not being addressed: In some cases, the focus area is currently being addressed by another organization in the community or there is another organization within the community better equipped to address the need. While the list below was not a primary focus for St. John's, the hospital participated in efforts with other organizations as appropriate. 1. Child abuse: In FY2018, St. John's, Prevent Child Abuse, and the Department of Children and Family Services partnered to promote awareness and education opportunities during April: Child Abuse Prevention month. Additionally, three screenings of the film Resilience were held to bring awareness to the impact of child abuse and adversity on children and adults. a. In 2014 the Illinois Department of Children and Family Services entered a year-long contract with the Mental Health Centers of Central Illinois to revamp the state's child protection training. b. The goal of this partnership is to provide experiential training through simulated real-life situations to better train child welfare workers with the necessary skills to protect children. 2. Dental care: While this was not originally selected, opportunity presented for HSHS St. John's Hospital to partner with Central Counties Health Center, a federally qualified health center, to host a dental clinic in the hospital. St. John's provides the space and overhead costs free of charge; and CCHC provides the dentist, supplies and equipment. a. Dental care was not identified through the existing data sets; however, it was an issue brought to our attention by our advisory council and during the community forums. b. During our assets and gaps process it was noted the Federally Qualified Health Centers are preparing to expand their dental services. Additionally, there are new services such as Familia Dental which provide affordable dental care. 3. Diabetes: In FY2017, St. John's Hospital sent three individuals to the Stanford Training for the Diabetes Self-Management Program. This is an evidenced based course that teaches individuals how to understand, control, and manage their diabetes. a. St. John's Hospital has representation on the Prairie Diabetes Alliance (PDA) which is run through the Central Illinois American Diabetes Association. Through our ongoing work with PDA and our initiatives around a FY12 identified needs: metabolic syndrome. We will continue our efforts around diabetes prevention and management. 4. Food insecurity a. St. John's Hospital continues to sponsor, organize and run the Eastside Farmers Market which began as a result of the FY12 CHNA. b. St. John's Hospital also works closely with other organizations in the community who are actively addressing food security issues: genHkids Coalition, Illinois Stewardship Alliance, Downtown Springfield, Inc., to name a few. 5. Heart disease a. Prairie Heart Institute at St. John's Hospital is committed to ongoing community education and outreach around heart disease. b. The American Heart Association has a very active chapter in Sangamon County."

However, through the joint implementation plan in partnership with CHI Health Immanuel and CHI Health Creighton University Medical Center-Bergan Mercy strategies addressing heart disease and stroke are identified and are being addressed within the community by CHI Health Creighton University Medical Center-Bergan Mercy and CHI Health Immanuel. Cancer. CHI Health will continue to perform existing cancer outreach throughout the community but did not feel cancer should be a top priority based on the considerations above and in order to focus and meaningfully impact other areas of need. Diabetes. CHI Health will continue performing diabetes outreach and education across the Omaha Metro Area while also addressing diabetes within the priority access to care. Notably, the area of nutrition, physical activity, and weight is a priority which relates to several root causes for diabetes and other chronic disease. Respiratory Diseases. This was not determined as a priority area based on the considerations above and in order to focus and meaningfully impact other areas of need. Sexually Transmitted Disease. There is extensive existing work by community partners currently taking place around sexually transmitted diseases across the Omaha Metro area.

The hospital will not address the following health needs for the following reasons: In acknowledging the range of priority health issues that emerged from the CHNA process, CHI Health Plainview prioritized the health issues above in order to most effectively focus resources and meaningfully impact the selected health issues. As described in the process above, the hospital took into consideration health disparities, in order to select the priorities. The following identified needs will not be prioritized in this implementation plan for the following reasons. Access to Healthcare Services. By providing care as a critical access hospital, CHI Health Plainview allows for increased access to services along with providing charity care to for patients who are low income. Increased access to behavioral health services is also being addressed in the priority area chosen. Aging Population & Related Illnesses.

To that end the healthcare improvement foundation, Philadelphia, pennsylvania, in partnership with the hospital and health system association of pennsylvania and the u.s. department of health and human services (region 3) convened the regions hospitals in the collaborative opportunities to advance community health (""coach"") project. The goals of coach are to: gather input from public health authorities and key community stakeholders; explore A growing number of health and epidemiologic data sources; and collaborate with public health and other stakeholders to prioritize needs, coordinate interventions, and establish measures for evaluating results. Additionally, the health care improvement foundation began facilitation in fy16 of a Montgomery county hospital partnership. The partnerships role, similar to coach, has an exclusive focus on Montgomery county, pennsylvania, and all hospitals, whether profit or non-profit for involvement. THIS INITIATIVE CONTINUED IN FY18. Abington Memorial Hospital (""amh"") community health and community benefit leaders worked diligently with the Montgomery county hospital partnership and Jefferson health colleagues, as part of a newly formed organization, to conduct the 2016 chna for Abington health including AMH and Lansdale Hospital Corporation (""LHC""). Community health leaders scheduled meetings, conference calls and follow up conversations, obtained meeting venues, contacted potential participants, and encouraged attendance. Meeting participants were not compensated. Input from all participants, including county and local health department officials and public health experts, was used to further identify and prioritize unmet needs, local problems with access to care and populations with special healthcare needs. Several follow up telephone calls resulted in additional information shared between the non-profit providers and the hospital leaders as the process ensued. Information on the health status and healthcare needs of the residents of AMH's service area was also collected through interviews and meetings and guided by a set of written questions finalized by AMH, LHC and Jefferson/Jefferson Health colleagues in community health and community benefit. Almost 30 interviews were conducted with individuals representing healthcare and community-based organizations who have knowledge of the health and underlying social conditions that affect health of people in their neighborhood and broader community. These interviews were conducted by community health and community benefit leaders to gain insight about health needs and priorities, barriers to improving community health, and the community assets and efforts already in place or being planned to address these issues and concerns. In addition, interviews were conducted with health providers of Abington health to gain their perspective about the health issues of their patients and community and to identify AMHs and others efforts to address these issues. Interviewees were asked to prioritize the needs/recommendations discussed during their interview. AMH interviews and meetings included: hospital senior leaders, emergency room nursing leadership, corporate departments, population health, women and childrens services, muller institute for senior health staff and human resources and hospitalists to name a few. Community organizations were represented from: Montgomery county health department, Montgomery county intermediate unit, north penn community health foundation leadership [NOW KNOWN AS HEALTHSPARK FOUNDATION], north penn mosque, north penn school district, north penn united way, souderton area school district nurse coordinator, vna foundation of north penn, wissahickon school district nurse coordinator, manna on main street executive director, north penn ymca and Philadelphia freedom valley ymcas of ambler leaders.

The strategy of the implementation plans identifies the means through which the hospital plans to address needs that are consistent with the hospitals charitable mission as part of its community benefit programs from 2016 through 2019. Beyond programs discussed in the strategy, the hospital is addressing many of these needs simply by providing care to all, regardless of ability to pay. The hospital anticipates health needs and resources may change, and thus a flexible approach was adopted in the development of its strategy to address needs identified in the 2016 chna. Themes emerged from the chna meetings and were analyzed and coded with all quantitative data. Recognition of themes were discussed and the resulting analysis in the community health needs assessment was organized into major topic or domain areas. Overall, the health of the populations served in the AMH service area is good, ranking higher than the montgomery county and pennsylvania state populations as a whole.

The strategy will focus on the priority health needs that are most important in the domain of access to care: mental health services, access to care and healthy lifestyle behaviors especially for social and healthcare needs of older adults and health education, social services and regular source of care. In the chronic disease management domain, most important was obesity followed by diabetes, heart disease and hypertension, stroke and asthma. Healthy lifestyle behaviors and community environment domain includes alcohol/substance abuse and womens cancer. The domain of health screening and early detection includes colon cancer.

201911349349304636,231365353,"PART V, SECTION B, LINE 11 - ADDRESSING NEEDS","ENGAGED STAKEHOLDERS AND COMMUNITY HEALTH LEADERSHIP FROM BOTH HEALTH SYSTEMS USED THE FOLLOWING CRITERIA FOR DETERMINING HEALTH PRIORITIES: SCOPE OF PROBLEM, SERIOUSNESS OF PROBLEM AND ABILITY TO IMPACT LOCALLY. BASED ON THE IDENTIFIED NEEDS FOR LANCASTER COUNTY FROM THE 2016 CHNA AND THE VALUABLE INPUT RECEIVED FROM COMMUNITY HEALTH STAKEHOLDERS, THE BOARD OF TRUSTEES FOR LG HEALTH/PENN MEDICINE APPROVED THE DEVELOPMENT OF A 2017-2019 IMPLEMENTATION STRATEGY FOCUSED ON IMPROVING OBESITY, MENTAL WELL-BEING, AND SUBSTANCE ABUSE, WHILE ADDRESSING DISPARITIES, POVERTY, AND ACCESS WITHIN EACH HEALTH TOPIC. BOARD APPROVAL WAS OBTAINED ON MARCH 10, 2016. THESE PRIORITIES HAVE BEEN ADOPTED INTO LG HEALTHS ANNUAL OPERATING PLAN AND BUDGET. ALTHOUGH ACCESS TO CARE HAS BEEN AN ORGANIZATIONAL PRIORITY AT LG HEALTH FOR MANY YEARS, THIS TARGETED AND SYSTEMIC APPROACH TO IMPACT THE SOCIAL DETERMINANTS OF HEALTH ILLUSTRATES A SHIFT IN HEALTH IMPROVEMENT. THIS APPROACH TO BOTH CARE DELIVERY AND COMMUNITY HEALTH IMPROVEMENT IS VALIDATED BY FEDERALLY DEVELOPED PROGRAMS SUCH AS THE ACCOUNTABLE HEALTH COMMUNITIES MODEL (CENTERS FOR MEDICARE AND MEDICAID SERVICES) AND THE HI-5 HEALTH IMPACT IN 5 YEARS INITIATIVE (CENTERS FOR DISEASE CONTROL AND PREVENTION). TO APPROPRIATELY ADDRESS THE NEEDS OF OUR FRIENDS AND NEIGHBORS IN LANCASTER COUNTY, THE 2017-2019 STRATEGIES FOR COMMUNITY HEALTH IMPROVEMENT WILL BE DEPLOYED AT 3 LEVELS: ENGAGEMENT OF PATIENTS THAT WE SEE WITHIN OUR ENTITIES, UNDER RESOURCED COMMUNITIES THAT HAVE BEEN IDENTIFIED AS THOSE WITH THE HIGHEST SOCIOECONOMIC NEED BASED ON HIGH POVERTY, LOW EDUCATIONAL ATTAINMENT, AND LIMITED ACCESS TO CARE. ENGAGEMENT OF PATIENTS THAT WE SEE WITHIN OUR ENTITIES ARE THE IDENTIFIED COMMUNITIES: LANCASTER CITY (SOUTH OF KING STREET), COLUMBIA, PEQUEA VALLEY SCHOOL DISTRICT, AND SOLANCO SCHOOL DISTRICT AS WELL AS THE COMMUNITY AT LARGE (LANCASTER COUNTY). PARTNERSHIPS WITHIN THE UNDER RESOURCED COMMUNITIES AS WELL AS THE COUNTY AT LARGE, ARE VITAL TO ACHIEVING LASTING IMPACT ON HEALTH OUTCOMES. WE WILL WORK COLLABORATIVELY WITH SPECIFIC KEY PARTNERS THAT HAVE: COMMITTED TO ADDRESS SOCIAL AND ENVIRONMENTAL DETERMINANTS OF HEALTH, AGREED TO A COMMON AGENDA TO ADDRESS ROOT CAUSES OF HEALTH PROBLEMS AND HEALTH DISPARITIES IN LANCASTER COUNTY, AGREED TO MEASURE HEALTH RELATED INDICATORS AND REGULARLY REPORT PROGRESS TOWARDS IMPROVING THESE INDICATORS, DEMONSTRATED ORGANIZATIONAL CAPACITY TO ACHIEVE GOALS. EVIDENCE-BASED TACTICS TO ADDRESS OBESITY, MENTAL WELL-BEING, AND SUBSTANCE MISUSE/ABUSE ARE ADDRESSED AND WILL BE OUTLINED IN THE COMMUNITY HEALTH IMPROVEMENT PLAN THAT WILL BE RELEASED PUBLICALLY AT THE END OF 2016. THESE TACTICS WILL ADDRESS EACH LEVEL OF THE SOCIO-ECOLOGICAL MODEL AND ARE FOCUSED SPECIFICALLY ON: AWARENESS, EDUCATION, BEHAVIORAL CHANGE, SYSTEMS CHANGE, POLICY CHANGE (BOTH ORGANIZATIONAL/LOCAL POLICIES, AS WELL AS LEGISLATIVE CHANGE), AND ENVIRONMENTAL CHANGE. THIS TARGETED AND SYSTEMIC APPROACH HAS BEEN VETTED THROUGH OUR BOARD OF TRUSTEES, PHYSICIAN LEADERS, KEY PARTNERS, AND COMMUNITY NURSES AT VARIOUS MEETINGS DURING JUNE, JULY, AND AUGUST OF 2016. THE HEALTH NEED NOT BEING ADDRESSED IS ASTHMA. LANCASTER COUNTYS POOR AIR QUALITY IS NOT ENTIRELY A RESULT OF THE ACTIVITIES OF THOSE WHO WORK AND LIVE IN LANCASTER COUNTY. POOR AIR QUALITY IS ALSO A RESULT OF THE PROXIMITY OF SIGNIFICANT SOURCES AND THE PREVAILING WINDS FROM THOSE SOURCES. IN ADDITION TO THE AIR POLLUTION THAT IS PRODUCED IN THE COUNTY, POLLUTION TRAVELS ON THE WIND FROM NEARBY CITIES SUCH AS THE BALTIMORE-WASHINGTON METRO AREA AND LARGE INDUSTRIAL NEIGHBOR COUNTIES SUCH AS YORK COUNTY, AS WELL AS FROM MORE DISTANT UPWIND AREAS SUCH AS WESTERN PENNSYLVANIA AND THE OHIO RIVER VALLEY. LANCASTER COUNTY IS NOT DIRECTLY RESPONSIBLE FOR ITS POOR AIR QUALITY AND CANNOT CHANGE THE LAND OR WIND PATTERNS; ENCOURAGING RESIDENTS TO ADOPT MORE ENVIRONMENTALLY FRIENDLY LIFESTYLES MAY MAKE A SUBTLE DIFFERENCE. LG HEALTH DOES NOT PLAN TO INCLUDE AIR QUALITY AND ENVIRONMENTAL CHANGE AS A KEY PRIORITY. HOWEVER, LG HEALTH PLANS TO ADDRESS CHRONIC DISEASES THROUGH ADDRESSING OBESITY AND TOBACCO. BY ADDRESSING THESE KEY PRIORITIES, LG HEALTH WILL HELP TO REDUCE THE NUMBER OF INDIVIDUALS IN LANCASTER COUNTY WHO DEVELOP A CHRONIC DISEASE, THUS REDUCING THE NUMBER OF INDIVIDUALS IN LANCASTER COUNTY WHO ARE AT A HIGHER RISK FOR COMPLICATIONS DUE TO POOR AIR QUALITY. LG HEALTH WILL ALSO INCLUDE ADDRESSING ASTHMA AND LUNG DISEASE AS PART OF THE TOBACCO HEALTH IMPROVEMENT PLAN AND WILL CONTINUE TO MONITOR THIS INDICATOR. IF THIS INDICATOR WERE TO CHANGE FOR THE WORSE, LG HEALTH WILL REASSESS ANNUAL PARTICLE POLLUTION AND TAKE APPROPRIATE ACTIONS. -------------------------"

201921349349303922,250965406,"Part V, Section B","Schedule H, Part V, Section B, Line 5-Group A - BKD, LLC worked together with Lawrence County Community Health Needs Steering Committee to develop a broad list of community leaders to interview. These community members were selected based on their involvement within the community and because they provided distinctive backgrounds and a variety of perspective on the state of the community and health care. Interviews were conducted with a number of directors and staff members from the community health centers, members from social service organizations, educational leaders, religious groups and elected officials. The selected participants give an overarching viewpoint of the community and through these interviews the health needs from the perspective of the community were identified. BKD, LLP was engaged to conduct a formal community health needs assessment. The community health needs assessment was conducted from January 2016 through May 2016. Based on current literature and other guidance from the treasury and the IRS, the following steps were conducted as part of the Health System's community health needs assessment. An evaluation of the impact of actions taken to address the significant health needs identified in the prior community health needs assessment was completed and an implementation strategy scorecard was prepared to understand the effectiveness of the Health System's current strategies and programs. The ""community"" served by the Health System was defined by utilizing inpatient and outpatient data regarding patient origin. This process is further described in Community Served by the Health System. Population demographics and socioeconomic characteristics of the community were gathered and reported utilizing various third parties. The health status of the community was then reviewed. Information on the leading causes of death and morbidity information was analyzed in conjunction with health outcomes and factors reported for the community by CountyHealthRankings.org. Health factors with significant opportunity for improvement were noted. Community input was provided through key informant interviews. Results and findings are described in the Key informant section of the formal report. Information gathered in the steps above was analyzed and reviewed to identify health issues of uninsured persons, low income persons and minority groups and the community as a whole. Health needs were ranked utilizing a weighting method that weighs the following: the size of the problem; the seriousness of the problem; impact of the issues on vulnerable populations; the prevalence of common themes; how important the issue is to the community; how the issue aligns with the Health System's strategic plan. An inventory of health care facilities and other community resources potentially available to address the significant health needs identified through the CHNA was prepared and collaborative efforts were identified. Health needs were then prioritized taking into account the perceived degree of influence the Health System has to impact the need and the health needs impact on overall health for the community. Information gaps identified during the prioritization process have been reported. SCHEDULE H, PART V, SECTION B, LINE 11 GROUP A UPMC JAMESON MADE MEASURABLE PROGRESS ON IMPROVING COMMUNITY HEALTH IN THE PERIOD FROM FISCAL YEAR 2014 THROUGH 2018. PROGRAMS AND INITIATIVES FOCUSED ON ALL OF THE SIGNIFICANT HEALTH NEEDS IDENTIFIED IN THE JUNE 30, 2013 CHNA AND THE JUNE 30, 2016 CHNA, WHICH INCLUDED: OBESITY AND NUTRITION, HEART DISEASE, BEHAVIORAL HEALTH (INCLUDING SUBSTANCE ABUSE), AND ACCESS TO PRIMARY CARE AND SPECIALTY CARE. IMPLEMENTATION PLANS DEVELOPED BY UPMC JAMESON DRAW SUPPORT FROM AN ARRAY OF ACTIVE AND ENGAGED COMMUNITY PARTNERS, AS WELL AS FROM THE LARGER UPMC SYSTEM, AND INCLUDE NUMEROUS INITIATIVES, UTILIZING BOTH EVIDENCE-BASED, NATIONALLY RECOGNIZED PROGRAMS AND INTERNALLY DESIGNED PILOT PROGRAMS. THE BOARD OF DIRECTORS AT UPMC JAMESON REGULARLY MONITORS THE PROGRESS OF THE COMMUNITY HEALTH IMPROVEMENT PLANS. DURING FISCAL YEARS 2014 THROUGH 2018, UPMC JAMESON MADE MEASURABLE PROGRESS IN ALL AREAS IDENTIFIED THROUGH THE CHNA PROCESS. IN SOME CASES, UPMC IMPOVED AND EXPANDED EXISTING PROGRAMS - REACHING OUT NOT ONLY TO MORE PEOPLE, BUT ALSO TARGETING PEOPLE WHO COULD BENEFIT MOST. UPMC ALSO DEVELOPED NEW PROGRAMS AND INITIATIVES, WHICH REQUIRED THE CREATION OF OPERATING INFRASTRUCTURE, AND ESTABLISHMENT OF GOALS AND ASSOCIATED ASSESSMENT TOOLS. UPMC JAMESON DEVELOPED AND ENHANCED PARTNERSHIPS WITH OTHER COMMUNITY ORGANIZATIONS TO BETTER COORDINATE RESOURCES. EXAMPLES OF UPMC JAMESONS PROGRESS DURING FISCAL YEARS 2014 THROUGH 2018 INCLUDE: PROMOTED HEALTHY EATING AND EXERCISE TO IMPROVE THE OVERALL HEALTH OF THE COMMUNITY THROUGH EDUCATION INITIATIVES, DEVELOPMENT OF SPECIALIZED PROGRAMS, AND USE OF TECHNOLOGY TOOLS. UPMC JAMESON OFFERED VARIOUS NUTRITION EDUCATION PROGRAMS TO SCHOOL-AGE CHILDREN, ADULTS, AND SENIORS. THE HOSPITAL COLLABORATES WITH LOCAL ORGANIZATIONS TO ACHIEVE THIS GOAL. FOR EXAMPLE, UPMC JAMESON PARTNERS WITH MEALS ON WHEELS AND CHALLENGES: OPTIONS IN AGING TO HELP EDUCATE THE COMMUNITY ABOUT NUTRITION AND HEALTHY EATING, REACHING OUT THROUGH INDIVIDUAL COUNSELING, HEALTH FAIRS, AND AFTER-SCHOOL PROGRAMS.

IMPROVED MANAGEMENT AND PREVENTION OF HEART DISEASE BY EXPANDING LOCAL ACCESS TO EXPERT CARDIOVASCULAR CARE AND PROVIDING COMMUNITY EDUCATION. IN JULY 2017, THE HOSPITAL OPENED THE UPMC HEART AND VASCULAR INSTITUTE (HVI) AT UPMC JAMESON TO SERVE AS A REGIONAL HUB ACROSS MERCER AND LAWRENCE COUNTIES. HVI PROVIDES COMPREHENSIVE CARDIOVASCULAR SERVICES TO THE LOCAL COMMUNITY, INCLUDING ADVANCED DIAGNOSTIC TESTING AND INTERVENTIONAL CARDIAC CATHETERIZATIONS. ADDITIONALLY, UPMC JAMESON CONTINUES TO RAISE AWARENESS ABOUT HEART DISEASE THROUGH A RANGE OF COMMUNITY PROGRAMS, SUCH AS OFFERING ROUTINE BLOOD PRESSURE SCREENINGS AT CHALLENGES: OPTIONS IN AGING; HOSTING THE HEALTHY LIVING EDUCATION SERIES; AND PROVIDING UPMC EMPLOYEES, AREA BUSINESSES, AND SCHOOLS WITH CPR TRAINING THAT INCORPORATES CURRICULUM ABOUT HEART DISEASE FROM THE AMERICAN HEART ASSOCIATION. EXPANDED ACCESS TO BEHAVIORAL HEALTH SERVICES WITH A FOCUS ON SUBSTANCE USE DISORDERS THROUGH THE PARTIAL HOSPITALIZATION PROGRAM, CONSULT AND LIAISON SERVICES, AND THE PEER NAVIGATOR PROGRAM. THE UPMC JAMESON PARTIAL HOSPITALIZATION PROGRAM IS A STRUCTURED, INTENSIVE MENTAL HEALTH TREATMENT SERVICE FOR ADULTS. THIS PROGRAM COMBINES INDIVIDUAL, GROUP, AND FAMILY THERAPY SESSIONS. IN 2017, 133 PATIENTS DEVELOPED THE SKILLS TO MANAGE THEIR SYMPTOMS, TRANSITION BACK TO THEIR HOMES, AND REINTEGRATE INTO THEIR COMMUNITIES. UPMC JAMESON, IN PARTNERSHIP WITH UPMC HORIZON, PROVIDED CONSULT AND LIAISON SERVICES TO HOSPITALIZED AND EMERGENCY DEPARTMENT PATIENTS. SERVICES OFFERED INCLUDED ASSESSMENTS, REFERRALS, CONNECTIONS TO RESOURCES, SUPPORT, AND TELEMEDICINE CONSULTATIONS WITH UPMC WESTERN PSYCHIATRIC HOSPITAL.

USING TELEPSYCHIATRY, THE HOSPITAL QUICKLY CONNECTED PATIENTS WITH A UNIVERSITY OF PITTSBURGH PHYSICIANS PSYCHIATRIST. THIS NEW SERVICE IMPROVED PATIENTS LEVEL OF ACCESS TO A FACE-TO-FACE CONSULTATION WITH A PHYSICIAN, AND BRINGS THE EVIDENCE-BASED, EXPERT CARE OF UPMC WESTERN PSYCHIATRIC HOSPITAL TO LOCAL PATIENTS. LASTLY, UPMC JAMESON PARTICIPATES IN THE PEER NAVIGATOR PROGRAM, WHICH OFFERS PATIENTS WITH MENTAL HEALTH DISORDERS AND SUBSTANCE USE DISORDERS AN OPPORTUNITY TO ENGAGE WITH AN INDIVIDUAL IN RECOVERY WHO HAS EXPERIENCED ADDICTION. PEER NAVIGATORS SUPPORT THE INDIVIDUAL ON THEIR JOURNEY TO WELLNESS BY OFFERING PATIENT-CENTERED, RECOVERY-ORIENTED, AND EVIDENCE-BASED SERVICES, SUCH AS WELLNESS COACHING, REFERRALS TO COMMUNITY RESOURCES, AND HELP WITH REACHING TREATMENT GOALS. EXPANDED LOCAL ACCESS TO PRIMARY AND SPECIALTY CARE THROUGH RECRUITMENT AND TELEMEDICINE SERVICES. UPMC JAMESON COMPLETED AN ASSESSMENT OF PHYSICIAN NEEDS ACROSS MERCER AND LAWRENCE COUNTIES. AFTER IDENTIFYING AREAS OF PHYSICIAN NEED, THE HOSPITAL DEVELOPED A RECRUITMENT PLAN AND HAS SUCCESSFULLY RECRUITED MORE THAN 20 PHYSICIANS TO PRACTICE IN THE REGION. ADDITIONALLY, UPMC JAMESON DEVELOPED A TELEMEDICINE PROGRAM IN 2017 THAT ENABLES PATIENTS TO MEET, BY VIDEO CONFERENCE, WITH UPMC SPECIALISTS IN PITTSBURGH.

There was a review of the identified needs followed by a wide-ranging discussion. After which the participants were asked to rank each of the needs. Based on data analysis, surveys, focus groups, and interviews, these are the top community health needs and priorities identified for the MidState Medical Center focus area: - Common themes surfaced around access to housing and transportation. When the lack of access to transportation impact the ability to access healthcare, the population usually foregoes healthcare services. Transportation schedules and routes do not service many outpatient or urgent care clinics; however, they do service the hospital, leading to overutilization of the ED. - Lack of affordable, secure, and stable housing - Access to care *Emergency departments often used for primary care *Patient hand-offs between caregivers are not well coordinated or followed-up on *Underutilized preventative care - Availability of healthy foods, especially fruits and vegetables, with a significant impact on seniors and children outside school-based programs - Childhood obesity including a lack of resources/facilities to safely exercise and cost of food - Mental health issues including substance abuse and addiction *Shortage of providers o Lack of affordable treatment options *Limited comprehensive outpatient care *Lack of insurance coverage for behavioral health *No same-day access - Stressing of social networks - Meriden scored significantly worse in physical and mental health indicators (including healthy weight, cigarette smoking, asthma, and depression) relative to the rest of the focus area and the state of Connecticut - Despite a significant number of outstanding ongoing community health initiatives, the majority of stakeholders who participated in focus groups and interviews said that a lack of coordination among and between providers and community-based organizations limits the overall effectiveness of the programs and the funding that is going to help serve the populations most in need. The results were then grouped into 3 Areas of Concern that were addressed in Community Health Improvement Plan (CHIP):1. Enhance Coordination of Services: this category includes Access to Care and TransportationCHIP addressed this need in the following manner:a. Evaluate and use information exchange portal resources, linking healthcare providers with community-based organizations.b. Improve IT resources to enable community focus and better measurement of outcomes.c. Develop a playbook for infrastructure, dashboard of health, governance, and community workflows.d. Enable dynamic and up-to-date asset mapping.e. Develop innovation network for learning, research, co-creation, and rapid knowledge dissemination (bi-directional communication platform).f. Implement new or increased use of Community Health Workers (CHW).g. Evaluate and use adaptive technology (e.g., geo-fencing, GIS mapping, artificial intelligence, biometric risk assessment, Epic tie-ins).2. Promote Healthy Behaviors and Lifestyle: this category includes Access to Healthy Food and Poor Physical and Mental Health. CHIP addresses this need in the following manner:a. Screen for healthy food need identification in community population and provide assessment at points of care. b. Enhance Promotion and Marketing, including adopting 5-2-1-0 initiative, at schools, workplaces, public spaces, faith communities, and healthcare events. c. Provide voucher/prescription programs for fruits and vegetablesd. Promote and improve healthy food donation e. Further partnerships with food pantries/banks and food providers and suppliersf. Create more access points for healthy foodsg. Develop urban gardens, community gardens, hospital campus gardens, farmer's markets (fresh food)h. Evaluate and use mobile food programsi. Create and support food policy councils3. Improve community Behavioral Health: this category includes Mental Health and Substance Abuse. CHIP addresses this need in the following manner: a. Embed behavioral health services in primary care (ongoing).b. Recruit more mental health providers, with focus on community outpatient services (e.g., family therapists).c. Implement Recovery Coach program in ED.d. Provide more depression screening growth and at more points of care with referrals.(including at public schools) and integrate into Epic.e. Further Mental Health First Aid training and grow community behavioral health training at the local level.f. Enhance services in virtual mental health, including tele-psychiatry.Areas of Opportunity, identified but not prioritized were housing and safety issues including a lack of affordable housing, neighborhood safety, and housing conditions. It was determined that Midstate Medical Center does not have the resources or expertise to address these issues but will certainly support the efforts of other city and community agencies and organizations."

IN ADDITION, MERCY HAS COMPLETED AN UPDATED COMMUNITY HEALTH NEEDS ASSESSMENT AND IMPLEMENTATION STRATEGY IN JUNE 2018. THIS UPDATED VERSION IS AVAILABLE ON THE MERCY HEALTH SERVICES WEBSITE.PRIOR TO 2013, MERCY'S COMMUNITY BENEFIT OUTREACH WAS FOCUSED ON A LARGE GEOGRAPHIC AREA WITHIN BALTIMORE CITY. THE HOSPITAL PRIMARY SERVICE AREA HISTORICALLY COVERED 17 ZIP CODES IN WHICH 60% OF ALL INPATIENT ADMISSIONS ORIGINATED. 15 OF THESE 17 ZIP CODES WERE PREVIOUSLY SELECTED AS MERCY'S COMMUNITY BENEFIT SERVICE AREA (""CBSA"") BASED ON THE PREVALENCE AND CONCENTRATION OF EMERGENCY ROOM VISITS. WHILE APPROPRIATE AND WELL INTENTIONED, THE USE OF ZIP CODES AS THE BASIS FOR MERCY'S CBSA HAS PROVED CUMBERSOME FOR THE FOLLOWING REASONS:- ZIP CODES ARE BY NATURE LARGE. MERCY'S PREVIOUS CBSA COVERED ALMOST 70 SQUARE MILES WITHIN THE CITY-THE TOTAL LAND AREA IN BALTIMORE IS 81 SQUARE MILES. OTHER PEER HOSPITALS HAVE DESIGNATED A MUCH SMALLER CBSA FOOTPRINT THAT TENDS TO FOCUS ON THE IMMEDIATE NEIGHBORHOOD(S) IN WHICH THEY RESIDE.- A CONCENTRATION OF EMERGENCY ROOM VISITS (OR ANY OTHER VARIABLE) MAY ONLY EXIST IN A SMALL PORTION OF A ZIP CODE. YET THE ENTIRE ZIP CODE WAS BEING ADDED INTO OUR CBSA. - ACCESSIBLE, TIMELY, AND HIGH QUALITY COMMUNITY HEALTH PROFILES HAVE ALREADY BEEN CREATED BY THE BALTIMORE CITY HEALTH DEPARTMENT. BUT THESE COMMUNITY HEALTH PROFILES ARE ORGANIZED BY MUCH SMALLER COMMUNITY STATISTICAL AREAS (CSAS), NOT ZIP CODES.- FINALLY, ZIP CODES ARE FACELESS, IMPERSONAL DESIGNATIONS THAT DO NOT CARRY THE SAME CONNECTION AND IMPACT AS A SPECIFICALLY NAMED COMMUNITY. MERCY'S COMMUNITY BENEFITS COMMITTEE BELIEVES THAT WE SHOULD FOCUS ATTENTION ON OUR NEIGHBORS IN ""MIDTOWN OR ""MT. VERNON"", AND NOT ""21202"".DURING A SERIES OF MEETINGS, MERCY'S COMMUNITY BENEFITS COMMITTEE DISCUSSED THE SOCIOECONOMIC AND HEALTH PARAMETERS THAT SHOULD HELP DEFINE MERCY'S ""COMMUNITY"" FOR PURPOSES OF THIS CHNA. THE SISTERS OF MERCY WERE ORIGINALLY FOUNDED IN DUBLIN, IRELAND TO CARE FOR HOMELESS, ABUSED AND NEGLECTED WOMEN AND CHILDREN. THIS TIMELESS LEGACY INFLUENCED THE COMMITTEE TO FOCUS ATTENTION ON CERTAIN TARGET POPULATIONS, SUCH AS INFANTS, WOMEN, AND THE IMPOVERISHED. WITH A STRONG DESIRE TO BE DATA-DRIVEN AND MISSION FOCUSED, THE COMMITTEE IDENTIFIED THREE RELEVANT FACTORS TO HELP SHAPE THE COMMUNITY IN WHICH MERCY WILL FOCUS ITS LIMITED FINANCIAL RESOURCES AS PART OF THE CHNA PROCESS: - LOW BIRTH WEIGHT BABIES BORN AT MERCY- REPEAT EMERGENCY ROOM VISITORS (10+ VISITS IN ONE YEAR)- CHARITY CARE RECIPIENTSADDITIONALLY, SINCE THE IMPLEMENTATION OF THE NEW MARYLAND ALL-PAYER MODEL WHICH FOLLOWED THE COMPLETION OF MERCY'S 2013 CHNA, MERCY IS INCREASINGLY FOCUSED ON HIGH-UTILIZER PATIENTS, INCLUDING THOSE WITHIN OUR PREVIOUSLY-DEFINED CHNA COMMUNITY BENEFIT SERVICE AREA. AS EXPECTED, THERE IS SIGNIFICANT GEOGRAPHIC OVERLAP OF HIGH UTILIZER PATIENT ORIGIN AND OUR PREVIOUSLY-DEFINED CBSA, ESPECIALLY IN THE IMMEDIATE AREAS WHERE THE MOST VULNERABLE POPULATIONS RESIDE. THE SIMILARITY OF GEOGRAPHY PRESENTS AN ONGOING OPPORTUNITY TO INCREASE ALIGNMENT BETWEEN MERCY'S COMMUNITY BENEFIT ACTIVITIES AND MERCY'S FOCUSED POPULATION HEALTH INTERVENTIONS TO REDUCE POTENTIALLY AVOIDABLE UTILIZATION AS IDENTIFIED IN MERCY'S HSCRC STRATEGIC HOSPITAL TRANSFORMATION PLAN. MERCY BELIEVES OUR POPULATION HEALTH STRATEGIES ARE INTEGRAL TO OUR CHNA FOCUS AREAS:- IMPROVING ACCESS TO CARE AND THE FREQUENCY OF CARE FOR OUR HOMELESS NEIGHBORS.- IDENTIFYING TACTICS AND STRATEGIES TO IMPROVE BIRTH OUTCOMES AND PRE-NATAL CARE FOR EXPECTANT MOTHERS.- FACILITATING BETTER CARE COORDINATION WITH THE CITY'S FEDERALLY QUALIFIED HEALTH CENTERS.- PROVIDING SUPPORT TO VICTIMS OF VIOLENCE AND ADDICTION.- PROVIDING NARROWLY TAILORED HEALTH EDUCATION TO SEGMENTS OF THE POPULATION WITHIN OUR COMMUNITY."

201931359349310463,710240352,"FORM 990, SCHEDULE H, PART V, SECTION B, LINE 11","MERCY HOSPITAL FORT SMITH IS ADDRESSING THE SIGNIFICANT NEEDS IDENTIFIED IN ITS MOST RECENTLY CONDUCTED CHNA BY FOCUSING PROGRAMMING, SERVICES AND EDUCATION AND AWARENESS AROUND: (1) ACCESS TO CARE, (2) MENTAL HEALTH, AND (3) NUTRITION. THE COMMUNITY HEALTH IMPROVEMENT PLAN (CHIP) WILL DESCRIBE THE ACTIONS THAT THE HOSPITAL INTENDS TO TAKE TO ADDRESS THE HEALTH NEEDS, THE ANTICIPATED IMPACT OF THESE ACTIONS, AND THE PLAN TO EVALUATE SUCH IMPACT; IDENTIFY THE PROGRAMS AND RESOURCES THAT THE HOSPITAL PLANS TO COMMIT TO ADDRESS THE HEALTH NEEDS AND DESCRIBE ANY PLANNED COLLABORATION BETWEEN THE HOSPITAL AND OTHER AGENCIES IN ADDRESSING THE HEALTH NEED. THE FIRST IDENTIFIED NEED IS ACCESS TO CARE. WHILE HAVING ACCESS TO CARE IS VITAL TO IMPROVING TREATMENT AND HEALTH FOR PEOPLE, ACCESSING APPROPRIATE CARE IS EQUALLY IMPORTANT. THIS INCLUDES ENSURING INDIVIDUALS HAVE A PLAN TO COVER THE COST OF CARE AND MAKING SURE THAT THERE IS APPROPRIATE PROVIDER COVERAGE IN COMMUNITIES. ANOTHER IMPORTANT COMPONENT IS CHANGING THE CULTURE TO ACCESS CARE APPROPRIATELY. EFFORTS TO ADDRESS EACH HEALTH ISSUE SHOULD FOCUS ON IMPROVING THE SYSTEMS AROUND THE INDIVIDUAL TO IMPROVE HEALTH AND ACCESS TO APPROPRIATE CARE AND WORK TO MODIFY THE WAY THAT INDIVIDUALS CONSUME HEALTH SERVICES TO ENSURE CARE IS EFFECTIVE AND EFFICIENT. MERCY HOPE CLINIC OPENED IN SEPTEMBER 2017 AT THE HOPE CAMPUS TO SERVE THE MARGINALIZED AND HOMELESS IN THE COMMUNITY. MERCY FORT SMITH HAS PARTNERED WITH FIVE LOCAL ELEMENTARY SCHOOLS IN ECONOMICALLY AND MEDICALLY UNDERSERVED AREAS (ZIP CODES 72901 AND 72904) TO PROVIDE FREE KINDERGARDEN PHYSICALS TO ENSURE ENROLLMENT. MERCY IS PARTNERING WITH THE SISTERS OF MERCY MINISTRIES INTERNATIONALLY TO LEARN AND SHARE INFORMATION AND SERVICES ON WAYS TO SERVE THE MOST VULNERABLE POPULATIONS, PARTICULARLY IN AREAS OF PERU. THE SECOND IDENTIFIED NEED IS MENTAL HEALTH AWARENESS AND EMOTIONAL WELLBEING. MENTAL HEALTH IS A COMMON THREAD IN MANY CHRONIC HEALTH CONDITIONS. DEPRESSION HAS BEEN LINKED TO HIGHER RATES OF CARDIOVASCULAR DISEASE AND DIABETES. ADDITIONALLY, PERSONS WITH DEPRESSION TEND TO ENGAGE IN MORE RISK BEHAVIORS FOR THESE DISEASES SUCH AS SMOKING, POOR DIET OR LACK OF EXERCISE THAN PERSONS WITHOUT DEPRESSION. A 2006 STUDY SUGGESTS THAT 80% OF THOSE DIAGNOSED WITH SCHIZOPHRENIA USE TOBACCO PRODUCTS. A GROWING BODY OF EVIDENCE SUGGESTS THAT THE LACK OF SOCIAL CONNECTEDNESS, PARTICULARLY IN OLDER ADULTS, CONTRIBUTES TO POOR HEALTH OUTCOMES. MERCY WILL IMPLEMENT STRATEGIES TO PROMOTE IMPROVED MENTAL HEALTH AND EMOTIONAL WELLBEING BY IDENTIFYING GAPS AND PROMOTING/DEVELOPING STRATEGIES TO EVIDENCED BASED STRATEGIES TO CLOSE THE GAP; WORK TO INCREASE THE NUMBER OF PEOPLE ABLE TO ACCESS APPROPRIATE, QUALITY MENTAL HEALTH TREATMENT/CARE; ADVOCATE AND SUPPORT THE SEBASTIAN COUNTY SHERIFF'S DEPARTMENT FOR THE DEVELOPMENT OF A STABILIZATION UNIT TO DIVERT PERSONS SUFFERING FROM A MENTAL HEALTH CRISIS AND TO ENSURE APPROPRIATE LEVEL OF CARE IS RECEIVED; ADVOCATE FOR LEGISLATION TO IMPROVE MENTAL HEALTH SERVICE DELIVERY THROUGH OUR STATE REPRESENTATIVES AND LEGISLATURE AND SUPPORT THE HOPE CAMPUS TO ENSURE THE HOMELESS AND UNDERSERVED RECEIVE ASSISTANCE IN OBTAINING THE APPROPRIATE LEVEL OF CARE. MERCY IS ALSO WORKING WITH RESTORE HOPE, A TASK FORCE APPOINTED BY THE CURRENT ARKANSAS GOVERNOR, TO IDENTIFY AND ADDRESS THE HIGH RECIDIVISM RATES IN SEBASTIAN COUNTY AND THE INCREASING NUMBER OF CHILDREN ENTERING THE FOSTER CARE SYSTEM. THE THIRD IDENTIFIED NEED IS PHYSICAL ACTIVITY AND NUTRITION. REGULAR PHYSICAL ACTIVITY IMPROVES OVERALL HEALTH AND WELL-BEING AND REDUCES THE RISK OF CHRONIC DISEASES AND OBESITY. MORE THAN 80% OF ADULTS AND ADOLESCENTS DO NOT MEET THE GUIDELINES FOR PHYSICAL ACTIVITY. PEOPLE WHO ARE PHYSICALLY ACTIVE TEND TO LIVE LONGER AND HAVE LOWER RISK FOR CARDIOVASCULAR DISEASE, DIABETES, DEPRESSION AND CANCER. PHYSICAL ACTIVITY CAN ALSO HELP WITH WEIGHT CONTROL, AND INACTIVE ADULTS HAVE A HIGHER RISK FOR PREMATURE DEATH. POOR DIETS ARE NOT ONLY A RISK FACTOR FOR OBESITY, BUT FOR OTHER CHRONIC DISEASES AS WELL. FEWER THAN 1 IN 3 ADULTS AND AN EVEN LOWER PROPORTION OF ADOLESCENTS EAT THE RECOMMENDED AMOUNT OF FRUITS AND VEGETABLES EACH DAY. MERCY WILL WORK TO PROMOTE A HEALTHY LIFESTYLE AND IMPROVE ACCESS AND EDUCATION TO NUTRITIOUS FOODS AND PHYSICAL ACTIVITY TO INCREASE THE PERCENTAGE OF PEOPLE LIVING AT A HEALTHY WEIGHT BY EXPLORING FOOD SYSTEMS IN THE FORT SMITH COMMUNITY AND IDENTIFY PARTNERSHIP OPPORTUNITIES THAT INCREASE HEALTHY FOOD CHOICES AND ACCESS TO HEALTHY FOODS, ENGAGE AND EDUCATE MERCY FORT SMITH COMMUNITY EMPLOYEES TO HELP ADDRESS FOOD INSECURITIES AND OBESITY RATES IN THE COMMUNITIES THEY SERVE; SUPPORT AND COLLABORATE WITH LOCAL COMMUNITY GARDENS AND FOOD PANTRIES TO OFFER HEALTHY FOOD CHOICES IN TARGETED FOOD INSECURITY AREAS; PROVIDE COOKING CLASSES WITH FOOD PREPARED FROM THE COMMUNITY GARDENS AND FOOD PANTRIES AND CONTINUE TO SUPPORT LOCAL HEALTHIFICATION ACTIVITIES IN THE COMMUNITIES SERVED; AND PARTNER WITH THE FITNESS CENTER TO PROVIDE EXERCISE CLASSES OUT IN THE COMMUNITY.

The following applies to both Des Moines and Westlake. The two facilities are in close proximity to one another, define their community the same and share resources. The Central Iowa Health Needs Assessment (CHNA) was a collaboration among the three community based hospitals in our community - Mercy Medical Center-Des Moines, Unity Point - Des Moines, and Broadlawns Medical Center. These three hospitals serve multi-county areas, so the CHNA process included Polk, Warren and Dallas counties. Each county brought the information from their own county assessment to the table for discussion. As the workgroups refined the data and community input, a CHNA Steering Committee provided a final level of analysis and structure. The final report addresses six priorities, based on the potential for implementation and depth of impact. Those priorities include: A. Increase opportunities for expanded and alternative means of healthcare delivery to address issues limiting access to care To expand its patient reach and services, Mercy will: * Explore the development of a 23-hour observation crisis unit to be staffed by 1-2 nurses. This area would be for patients who are ready to be discharged home but don't have the family or support system to assist with their discharge and treatment plan. * Implement creative ways to treat all types of behavioral health patients as the need for this growing population intensifies and access to care moves to the forefront of behavioral health service needs in Iowa. * Examine opportunities to meet the health needs of the most vulnerable, especially the chronically homeless * Assess locations with increasing need and capacity B. Establish more vibrant communities and neighborhoods characterized by mixed- and joint-use spaces and facilities that are accessible and available to everyone, including public gathering places for diverse and integrated engagement, and designs that promote healthy lifestyles To enhance the surroundings for all to feel safe and welcome, Mercy will: * Provide volunteer teams for community activities, especially clean up and restoration activities for the most vulnerable residents. * Sponsor the Multi-cultural Market The 6th Avenue Corridor, Inc. , a summer-long festival featuring a diverse array of ethnic and multicultural products (textiles, artisan goods, food) while encouraging neighborhood activity and community-building. * Work with the city and county leaders as well as other partners to support success of a new streetscape. This will include new pedestrian safety features, aesthetic improvements, and sustainability concepts C. Expand statewide training efforts for all professionals working with children across the various health and child-serving systems in Trauma Informed Care, cultural competency, and mental health first aid To improve the care of children through the education of their providers, Mercy will: * Mercy will host, at minimum, two training opportunities per year for health care staff on the topics of trauma-informed care, the impact of adverse childhood experiences, toxic stress, and/or mental health first aid. These trainings will continue to increase awareness and gain understanding of these important issues. Trainings will also offer potential responses to consider implementing within our systems of care. * Mercy Children's Hospital and Clinics will continue to share the Connections Matter training with medical staff and communities by having other staff complete the train-the-presenter Connections Matter workshop and offer Connections Matter trainings. * Knowing that early intervention is key in reducing the impacts of trauma and that the foundations of mental health are set in the first five years of life, Mercy will re-engage staff and medical providers within our clinics to increase referrals to our local 1st Five program. D. Identify additional sources of funding to create new and expand existing training programs in Psychiatry and Psychology and improve the mental health and disabilities training of primary care doctors and other primary care providers To work for an increase of behavioral health services, Mercy will: * Develop an assessment of current and emerging trends in Behavioral Health services; * Develop a forecast for the next 3 to 5 years; * Compare the current supply and resources compared to the projected resource needs based on the forecast of future demand. * While exploring collaboration alternatives, maximize the investment and services of Mercy's Behavioral Health service line * Provide increased mental health services to the underserved via House of Mercy programming E. Ensure access to high-quality pre-K and K-12 education for Central Iowa children To contribute to the education of all children in grades K-12, Mercy will: * Provide support and human resources to programs seeking volunteers in school settings * Maintain supportive mental health and substance abuse counselling for children and families in need of assistance through the House of Mercy * Provide learning opportunities to students interested in health care fields * Participate in Project SEARCH for young adults with learning disabilities * Partner with schools via GIRL POWER, an empowerment program to increase self-esteem and reduce risk behaviors F. Ensure access to health care services and education for Central Iowa's newcomer population To improve health care for the newest Iowans with diverse backgrounds, Mercy will: * Provide cultural and linguistic support to Limited English Proficiency (LEP) refugees served by the USCRI * Increase access to physical and mental health resources for Limited English Proficiency (LEP) refugees * Build the capacity of health care providers to provide culturally and linguistically appropriate services to refugees * Provide direct case management services to refugees in the community under supervision of USCRI Wellness Program staff * Conduct home visits, intakes and assessments of clients referred to the Wellness Program under supervision of Wellness Program staff; * Coordinate appointments and services, maintain appointment notes for clients enrolled in the Wellness Program; * Communicate with healthcare providers about ongoing barriers or needs of clients served in the Wellness Program, and work to eliminate these barriers."

201922489349300312,410682405,Betty Ford Center,"Part V, Section B, Line 11: Since Betty Ford Center provides substance use treatment and provision of mental health services and is not a general hospital providing primary care or preventative care, the health needs identified through this CHNA are more focused on behavioral health than in most hospitals' CHNAs.This is not to suggest that other health needs in the community do not exist; especially prevalent issues include the following: disability, major disease, obesity, prevention of sexually transmitted diseases/infection and sleep deprivation.As a drug and alcohol rehabilitation facility, Betty Ford Center's mission and purpose is focused around substance abuse treatment, not general physical health. Thus, there is a relative lack of expertise to address needs like arthritis, obesity, and STDs. Other organizations in the region-such as the three hospitals in the community, the federally-qualified health centers (FQHCs), etc.-are much better suited to tackle these issues, and many have strong existing programs designed to address these needs.Instead, Betty Ford Center will focus considerable resources and expertise on the local needs relating to behavioral health; specifically:access to care for low-income and or/uninsured, mental health care and substance abuse treatment.The identified need of access to care will be met through three strategies:-Financial assistance for the uninsured, under-insured, and/or low-income community-Contribute to local efforts to ""grow our own"" behavioral health workforce locally, thereby increasing the number of providers available -Make Betty Ford Center more physically accessible to people with mobility issues.The identified need of mental health care will be met through four strategies:-Provide Betty Ford Center patients with a multi-disciplinary treatment team that is competent with both substance use and mental health treatment-Hire new staff that will enhance Betty Ford Center's mental health competencies-Contribute to local efforts to ""grow our own"" behavioral health workforce locally, thereby increasing the number of providers available-Provide education and outreach efforts to the community about the relationship between substance use and mental health.The identified need of substance use treatment will be met through two strategies:-Provide education and outreach regarding substance use-Use the expertise and specialized knowledge at the Betty Ford Center to train professionals in substance use treatment.Dut to the timing of the completion of the current process, the organization has not conducted any current year activites to address these needs. However, during the current year they undertook the following activities with respect to the prior CHNA:-Betty Ford Center opened an outpatient clinic in San Diego in 2016 in order to serve more patients. In 2018, nearly 70% more patients received service compared to 2017.-Collaborated with schools and school districts in the service area to reach more students. Staff of the Children's Program participated in the Red Ribbon Campaign at numerous schools in California.-Early prevention education and recovery awareness events were held in communities and schools, along with training sessions for school administrators, principlas, counselors andteachers to provide information, resources and tools regarding the family disease of addiction. The training session, called Tools for the Journey, is also open to therapists, counselors, non-profits and other organizations that work with children."

As stated in the 2016 CHNA, among the most identified pressing needs of the community that will be targeted include: 1. Prevention and management of chronic disease 2. Reduce obesity in children and adults 3. Cancer Prevention & Screening 4. Healthy & Safe Environment (Fall Prevention) These will be addressed through educational programs (e.g. Stanford Program for Chronic Disease Prevention, 5-2-1-0 Obesity Prevention Program and Tai Chi for Arthritis and Fall Prevention), screenings, and various community outreach activities. Plan revisions, resource limitations and re-prioritization of goals may impact individual programs. Two additional identified needs include 1) Mental Health and Substance Abuse and 2) women & children's Health. Due to limited resources, Winthrop will not address these two initiatives formally, however, please see the following: Mental Health - Winthrop has expanded its psychiatric division and maintains a strong referral system. We are in the stages of investigating Mental Health stress management initiatives that will be introduced to the community at Hospital-based educational programs.

SIMULTANEOUSLY WITH DEVELOPING THE FY19-FY21 IMPLEMENTATION STRATEGIES FOR THE NEEDS IDENTIFIED IN THE 2018 COMMUNITY HEALTH NEEDS ASSESSMENT, THE HOSPITAL ALSO CONTINUED TO ADDRESS THE NEEDS IDENTIFIED IN THE PREVIOUS ASSESSMENT WHICH WAS CONDUCTED IN 2015. THE PRIORITY NEEDS IDENTIFIED IN THE 2015 CHNA WERE ACCESS TO CARE (PRIMARY, ORAL AND BEHAVIORAL HEALTHCARE), CANCER, DIABETES/NUTRITION/PHYSICAL ACTIVITY/OBESITY AND HEART DISEASE/STROKE. IN ACKNOWLEDGING THE WIDE RANGE OF HEALTH ISSUES THAT EMERGED FROM THE CHNA PROCESS, THE HOSPITAL DETERMINED IT COULD ONLY EFFECTIVELY FOCUS ON THOSE WHICH IT DEEMED MOST PRESSING, MOST UNDER-ADDRESSED, AND MOST WITHIN IT'S ABILITY TO INFLUENCE. THE COMMUNITY HEALTH NEEDS THAT THE HOSPITAL IS UNABLE TO ADDRESS ARE: ACCESS TO SPECIALTY AND VISION CARE, CHRONIC KIDNEY DISEASE, DEMENTIA/ALZHEIMERS, CHILD ABUSE AND DOMESTIC VIOLENCE. THE HOSPITAL BELIEVES ACCESS TO SPECIALTY AND VISION CARE WILL BE ADDRESSED THROUGH REFERRALS FROM PRIMARY CARE PHYSICIANS. THE HOSPITAL BELIEVES THAT CHRONIC KIDNEY DISEASE WILL BE ADDRESSED THROUGH THE HEART FAILURE AND DIABETES INITIATIVES THAT WERE DEVELOPED. THE HOSPITAL BELIEVES THERE ARE SUFFICIENT COMMUNITY RESOURCES INCLUDING PRIMARY CARE PHYSICIANS TO DIAGNOSE AND NURSING HOMES AND MEMORY CARE FACILITIES TO TREAT DEMENTIA AND ALZHEIMERS. THE HOSPITAL COLLABORATES WITH THREE LOCAL NOT-FOR-PROFIT COMMUNITY AGENCIES (CHILDREN'S ADVOCACY CENTER, NORTHWEST CASA AND WINGS) TO ADDRESS CHILD ABUSE AND DOMESTIC VIOLENCE. THE HOSPITAL SUPPORTS THE EFFORTS OF OTHERS TO ADDRESS THESE AREAS AND WILL FOCUS ITS LIMITED RESOURCES ON THE MORE PREDOMINANT NEEDS IDENTIFIED.

The survey was offered in Spanish and English. 65 individuals completed the survey in Spanish and 694 completed the survey in English. Individuals were invited to participate based on their ability to represent: underserved, low-income and minority population needs; needs of chronically ill patients; and awareness of healthcare needs in their respective communities. Participants were asked to share their viewpoints on: Important health concerns in the community; Significant service gaps in the community; Ideas for addressing concerns and service gaps.To gauge the importance of various health concerns, respondents were asked to ""Choose the top 5 priorities you think should be addressed in your community"" from a list of 34 health concerns. Respondents were then asked to rate their overall health, the health of the community, and the quality of life of the community. Other questions included reviewing lists of services typically important to addressing health concerns and how strong the community was in providing those services. Respondents were then asked to indicate services that needed to be strengthened in terms of availability, access, and quality. Open-ended response items were provided for participants to indicate additional service gaps in the community and ideas for addressing concerns and service gaps. Community ConversationsFive Community Conversations were held as part of the CHNA process in which 78 individuals participated from all of the core jurisdictions of Hanover, Henrico, Chesterfield, and Richmond City. Overall, the racial and geographical diversity of the participants represented a healthy mix of the region's residents. The purpose of the conversation was to elicit feedback from community members about publicly available health data describing health conditions in the services area, and to review the online survey results to further explore findings. Attendees were asked to 1) rank the health issues identified in the Community Survey according to the issues that impact them and the people close to them the most and 2) rank the issues needing to be addressed to improve the overall health of the region from a community view.Priority Needs Bon Secours Richmond convened a CHNA Advisory Board to support the process by engaging community members and providing feedback on the findings. The CHNA Advisory Board included individuals with special knowledge of public health and underserved populations and included the following: Directors from the Richmond City Health Department and the Chickahominy Health District, an Executive Director of a Free Clinic, a Vice President from VCU Health, Vice Presidents from the Better Housing Coalition and United Methodist Family Services, and the Executive Director of the Richmond Academy of Medicine. A group conversation was facilitated by Becky Clay Christensen and included a review of all qualitative and quantitative data gathered from the Community Survey, Community Conversations, and publicly available secondary health data. Advisory Board members were asked to categorize issues as high or low need in the community using a Strategy Grid. They were also asked to determine the feasibility of the community's ability to make an impact on the issues."

201941929349300504,540793767,"St. Mary's Hospital of Richmond, Inc.","Part V, Section B, Line 11: The Implementation Plan focuses on 4 broad areas including Access to Care for the Uninsured with Chronic Disease, Mental Health, Transportation, and Education. Goals and objectives were created for each area and were based on Healthy People 2020 objectives, Virginia's Plan for Well-Being 2016-2020 goals, and other evidence-based sources.The overarching goal for Access to Care for the Uninsured with Chronic Disease is to improve access to high quality health care services. This will be achieved in part by supporting the many community partners who work with the uninsured population to include: the Free Clinic Network, the Capital Region Collaborative, and the two other hospital systems in the region. Additionally, Bon Secours Mercy Health will provide services to the uninsured through the Care-A-Van, St. Joseph's Outreach Clinic, and the Community Nutrition program. Partnerships to achieve this objective include Churches, nutrition and healthy food providers, St. Joseph's Villa and The Daily Planet (FQHC).The goal in addressing Mental Health is to improve mental health status by ensuring access to appropriate, quality mental health services. We aim to achieve this by increasing the proportion of people who receive appropriate treatment for mental health disorders. Increasing the use of depression screenings and integrating behavioral health with primary care are two strategies to impact this goal. Partners in this work include The Daily Planet, the National Alliance on Mental Health, United Methodist Family Services, Childsavers, Stop Child Abuse Now, and the Bon Secours Bereavement Center. Additionally, Henrico Area Mental Health and Development Services, Chesterfield Department of Mental Health Support Services, the City of Richmond Department of Health, and the two other health systems in the region will be influential partners to impact Mental Health.Transportation is being addressed by increasing safe, healthy, and reliable transportation options for residents in the Richmond service area. Bon Secours Mercy Health promotes active transportation through advocacy for and provision of place making in the neighborhoods we serve. Additionally, we are an advocate for the expansion of public transportation options to increase access for those in underserved areas and improve ridership through a community-based design. One place making activity included opening the Sarah Garland Jones Center for Health Communities. Additionally, advocacy efforts include the expansion of safe walking and biking opportunities and the redesign of the public bus system to ensure timely access for all those we serve. Bon Secours Mercy Health also provides transportation to and from Richmond Community Hospital.The goal for Education is to promote student success in schools to improve health and quality of life for the Richmond community and future generations. Our efforts have focused on kindergarten readiness, 3rd grade Standards of Learning (SOL) reading test scores, and high school graduation rates. The Care-A-Van provides no cost vaccines and school physicals to children to ensure school readiness as well as enrolls eligible children in FAMIS Medicaid. Partners to support this work include, Commonwealth Parenting, Excel VCU, Faison School for Autism, Friends Association, Richmond Cycling Corps, First Things First, Reach Out and Read, Sacred Heart Center, Virginia Literacy Foundation, YMCA, YWCA, Peter Paul Development Center, Armstrong Priorities Freshman Academy, Anna Julie Cooper School, Church Hill Activities and Tutoring, Great Aspirations Scholarship Program, United Way, Higher Achievement, Salvation Army Boys and Girls Club, and many others providing direct education and workforce readiness training.Needs Not AddressedAccess to care for Medicaid and Medicare beneficiaries, adult and childhood obesity, jobs with fair wages, families living in poverty and seniors were identified as high needs in the community. The CHNA Advisory Board also identified these needs as having high feasibility meaning there was sufficient community support to make an impact.During the Community Conversations, older adults with Medicare shared they had challenges finding community physicians who accepted Medicare patients. This is being addressed by Bon Secours Richmond Health System that includes Bon Secours Medical Group and VCU Health in that they accept Medicaid and Medicare patients.Adult and childhood obesity are being addressed in the community by multiple organizations including Active RVA, City of Richmond's Corner Store initiative, Faces of Hope, Fit 4 Kids, the Seventh District Health and Wellness Initiative, Shalom Farms, Sports Backers/Richmond Strikers, Tricycle Gardens, Virginia Recreation and Parks and the YMCA.Jobs with Fair Wages is being addressed by the City of Richmond Community Wealth Building, Goodwill, Richmond Technical Center, Chesterfield Career and Technical Center, The Hanover Center for Trades and Technology, Henrico County Public Schools Career and Technical Education, United Way of Greater Richmond & Petersburg and the Virginia Interfaith Center.A family living in poverty is a multi-factorial issue which may be impacted through enhanced education and transportation, both areas of focus for the 2016 CHNA. Organizations presently engaged in breaking the cycle of poverty include Area Congregations Together in Service, Better Housing Coalition, Capital Region Collaboration, City of Richmond Community Wealth Building, Commonwealth Catholic Charities, Local Initiative Support Corporation (LISC), Peter Paul Development Center, Richmond Cycling Corps, Richmond Hill, Richmond Redevelopment and Housing Authority, Salvation Army Boys and Girls Club.The needs of the older adult population in the greater metro Richmond area or seniors are being addressed by Circle Center Adult Day Services, Old Dominion Partnership, Peter Paul Development Center, Rebuilding Together Richmond, Senior Connections, Senior Navigator and Shepherd's Center of Chesterfield."

For example, certain community health needs may become more pronounced and require changes to the initiatives identified by the hospital in the Strategy. Other community organizations may address certain needs, indicating that the hospital's strategies should be refocused on alternative community health needs or assume a different focus on the needs identified in the 2016 CHNA.Hospital resource inputs that will help address priority health needs include, Community Benefits Investments, Community Relations Investments, Better Together Grant Program, hospital-based community benefits activities, external grants received by hospital, and other hospital-based program/services.The hospital facility views a community benefits implementation strategy as a ""LIVING"" document. Due to the evolving climate in health care, the hospital's financial health year to year remains unknown; therefore hospital resources and inputs may increase, decrease, or need to be modified. The hospital's implementation strategy work plan provides an opportunity for the hospital to be strategic and focused, yet flexible in its community health planning and improvement efforts. The hospital facility, in partnership with its Community Benefits Advisory Council updates the work plan with annual outputs and outcomes for each input and activity.No health care system or hospital facility can address all the health needs present in its community. The hospital facility is committed to adhering to its mission and remaining financially healthy so that it can continue to enhance its clinical excellence and patient experience, as well as continue community health planning and improvement efforts. The hospital facility's implementation strategy does not explicitly address all the priority community health needs identified in the 2016 CHNA due to; 1. the hospital's limited resources (time, talent and financial), 2. other hospitals or community organizations within service area are addressing the need; 3. the need falls outside of the hospitals' mission or limited resource capacity. However, many, if not all of the CHNA priority health needs will be addressed INDIRECTLY by the hospital and/or community partners through existing community health planning and improvement efforts.Needs being addressed by the hospital include, basic needs (such as housing), care coordination, community safety, cultural humility, health equity, institutional racism, insurance challenges, limited availability of providers, maternal/infant/child health, mental health and substance use disorders, physical activity and healthy diet, and transportation. Needs not directly being addressed by the hospital include, chronic health conditions, environmental concerns, food deserts/insecurity, health literacy, and sexual health."

201942279349300919,060646597,"Part V, Line 5 - Account input from person who represent the community","Facility: A In conducting the current CHNA, the Hospital took into account input from persons who represented the broad interests of the community it serves. Quantitative data was collected by DataHaven, a non-profit organization that works to improve quality of life by collecting, interpreting, and sharing public data for effective decision-making. They conducted a state-wide Community Wellbeing Survey from May through October 2015. The survey was administered via randomly-selected land and cell phones in both English and Spanish. Interviews were weighted to be statistically representative of adults in each sub-region, and zip codes were targeted to supplement samples of hard-to-reach populations. Over 1000 interviews were completed in the Greater Danbury Region. The process also included integrating existing data regarding social, economic, and health indicators in the region with qualitative information. To provide feedback and guidance to Danbury Hospital on the assessment, an advisory committee, the Community Action Planning Steering Committee (CAPSC), was engaged. In place since the 2012 Community Report Card and 2013 CHIP, the group, comprised of approximately 20 individuals from key partner agencies and organizations, was involved to advise on the current process, support data collection, and participate in the development and implementation of programs and policies to address priority issues. Engagement of community members and partners was expanded throughout the project to include over 50 individuals, including representatives from housing, transportation, social services, education, business, local government, and neighboring health departments. CAPSC met as a whole in December 2015, March 2016, and June 2016. These community members agreed to assist in the CHNA. Specifically, the committee was asked to provide existing quantitative and qualitative data; identify additional appropriate secondary data sources; provide input on primary data collection; motivate and recruit community members to participate in the assessment process; provide technical assistance in their areas of expertise; identify priority issues for health improvement; and to develop and implement programs and policies to address priority issues. The United Way of Western Connecticut shared the ALICE (Asset Limited, Income Constrained, Employed) Community Conversations and Survey 2015 Summary report, the Regional YMCA of Western Connecticut provided their 2016 Online CHNA Summary report, and the Pomperaug Health District provided their Community Survey results. Information from these sources was reviewed and incorporated into the community health needs assessment. Throughout the process, information was provided to all CAPSC members through email allowing participants to be informed on the progress of the project and the opportunities to share their expertise. Another qualitative data tool, online key informant surveys (KIS) were developed and sent via email to 200 community leaders in the Greater Danbury Region; including elected officials, social service organizations, schools, libraries, housing, police, and community health agencies. The survey was designed to better understand the health needs of the Greater Danbury region and included questions on community health initiatives, strengths and challenges, health concerns and limitations, and vulnerable populations. A 21% participation rate was achieved. A follow-up CAPSC Forum was held in August 2016 and preliminary findings were shared with this group. Key themes that emerged across all groups were identified, as well as unique issues that were noted for specific populations. While community differences are noted where appropriate, analyses emphasized findings common across the Greater Danbury Area. The group then completed a ranking voting exercise to determine health priorities, and identify resources needed for the Community Health Improvement Plan (CHIP) process.

Any needs not being addressed are those that the Hospital does not have the funds or control over, such as housing or environmental health. In order to address the significant needs identified in the CHNA, a Steering Committee comprised of health care providers, community-based providers, and local government agencies was formed. They identified mental health, obesity and substance abuse, access, and healthy aging as the main priorities to address. They created the 2016 CHIP which details specific goals and metrics for each identified need, and community benefit programs that would help achieve these goals.

THESE EFFORTS FLOW FROM THE WELLSTAR MISSION AND VISION AND TO MEET THE REQUIREMENTS OF FEDERAL GOVERNMENT (AFFORDABLE CARE ACT SECTION 9007) OF SYSTEM-WIDE OVERSIGHT AND GUIDANCE REGARDING TRACKING COMMUNITY BENEFIT ACTIVITIES, ASSESSING COMMUNITY HEALTH NEEDS AND DEVELOPING STRATEGIC PLANS THAT PRIORITIZE COMMUNITY BENEFIT PROGRAMMING. 1. WELLSTAR 4-1 CARE NETWORK: CLINICAL CARE INTERVENTION PROGRAM - PRIORITY NEED ADDRESSED FROM THE 2015 JOINT CHNA: UNDERUSE OF PRIMARY CARE: INCLUDES ED UTILIZATION AND INCREASED CARE CAPACITY AT COMMUNITY SAFETY NET CLINICS GOALS: - EXPAND THE WELLSTAR PATIENT EXPERIENCE TO PARTNERING COMMUNITY SAFETY NET CLINICS TO REDUCE HEALTH DISPARITIES THROUGH IMPROVED ACCESS TO VOLUNTEER PRIMARY CARE PHYSICIANS AND OTHER SPECIALTY MEDICAL SERVICES TO VULNERABLE POPULATIONS - BUILD A COST-EFFICIENT MODEL OF CARE - DEVELOP AND EDUCATE ABOUT AVAILABLE HEALTH RESOURCES AND FACILITIES TO ""PRESCRIBE"" TO THE MEDICALLY UNDERSERVED AND UNINSURED - DECREASE ED UTILIZATION AND READMISSIONS FOR NON-EMERGENT NEEDS TO DELIVER THE RIGHT CARE AT THE RIGHT PLACE TO THE MEDICALLY UNDERSERVED AND UNINSURED. THE NAME REFERS TO THE AIM OF THE LOW-COST HEALTHCARE DELIVERY SYSTEM IN THE COMMUNITY TO CARE ""FOR ONE"" ANOTHER BY ADDRESSING THE UNDERUSE OF PRIMARY CARE AND REDUCING ED UTILIZATION AND READMISSIONS FOR NON-EMERGENT ISSUES THAT POTENTIALLY COULD BE TREATED IN AN OUTPATIENT SETTING. IT ALSO REFLECTS INCREASING SAFETY NET CLINIC CAPACITY, EDUCATION AND RESOURCES VIA WELLSTAR MEDICAL GROUP (WMG) CITIZENSHIP, WITH MDS AND NPS VOLUNTEERING FOUR HOURS ONE TIME PER MONTH. 2. LIVE WELL: HEALTHY BEHAVIORS INTERVENTION PROGRAM - PRIORITY HEALTH NEEDS ADDRESSED FROM THE 2015 JOINT CHNA: CANCER, CARDIOVASCULAR DISEASE, COPD/ASTHMA, OBESITY, TYPE 2 DIABETES GOAL: - IMPROVE THE HEALTH OF MEDICALLY UNDERSERVED AND UNINSURED RESIDENTS THROUGH TARGETED PREVENTIVE SERVICES, EDUCATION AND OUTREACH. LIVE WELLS TARGETED OUTREACH TO VULNERABLE POPULATIONS TO ADDRESS HEALTHY LIFESTYLE-RELATED PRIORITY HEALTH NEEDS LEVERAGES THE WELLSTAR 4-1 CARE NETWORK PARTNERS BY DELIVERING HEALTH NEED-SPECIFIC EDUCATION, EVENTS AND PREVENTIVE SCREENINGS ON-SITE AND IN OTHER HIGH-NEED SITE LOCATIONS. LIVE WELL WORKS IN TANDEM WITH 4-1 CARE AND OTHER COLLABORATIVE PARTNERSHIPS TO HELP REDUCE THE PREVALENCE OF CHRONIC DISEASE AND ITS COMPLICATIONS THROUGH PREVENTION AND WELLNESS ACTIVITIES AND THE PROMOTION OF HEALTHY LIFESTYLES. ALIGNING THE RESOURCES OF THE WELLSTAR COMMUNITY EDUCATION & OUTREACH TEAM, LIVE WELL ALSO WILL PARTNER WITH OTHER COMMUNITY GROUPS AND ORGANIZATIONS PROXIMATE TO COMMUNITY SAFETY NET CLINICS FOR VOLUNTEERISM, HEALTH NAVIGATION, TRANSPORTATION, AND OTHER SUPPORTIVE SERVICES. UNADDRESSED CHNA NEEDS - HEALTH NEEDS NOT IDENTIFIED AS PRIORITY FALL INTO ONE OF THREE CATEGORIES: 1) BEYOND THE SCOPE OF WELLSTAR SERVICES, E.G. DENTAL CARE WHICH IS ADDRESSED BY SAFETY NETS CLINICS 2) NEEDS FURTHER INTERVENTION, BUT NO PLANS FOR EXPANDING CURRENT COMMUNITY BENEFIT SERVICES AT THIS TIME, E.G. MATERNAL/INFANT HEALTH 3) RELYING ON COMMUNITY PARTNERS TO LEAD EFFORTS WITH EXPERTISE IN THESE AREAS WITH WELLSTAR IN A SUPPORTIVE ROLE, E.G. SUBSTANCE ABUSE, VIOLENCE, SUICIDE, STDS, TRANSPORTATION. TO IDENTIFY THE SIX PRIORITY HEALTH NEEDS WELLSTARS LEGACY HOSPITALS WILL ADDRESS, LEADERS OF KENNESAW STATE UNIVERSITYS A.L. BURRUSS INSTITUTE OF PUBLIC SERVICE & RESEARCH WERE SOLICITED TO GUIDE THE WELLSTAR COMMUNITY HEALTH COLLABORATIVE TASK FORCE (MADE UP OF WELLSTAR INTERNAL TEAM MEMBERS AND COMMUNITY STAKEHOLDERS) THROUGH THE PRIORITIZATION PROCESS. HEALTH NEEDS DATA SUMMARIES WERE ADVANCED AHEAD OF THE HEALTH NEEDS SUMMIT ON FEBRUARY 25, 2016 FOR REVIEW. FROM THE SIGNIFICANT HEALTH NEEDS IDENTIFIED BY CHNA RESEARCH CONDUCTED IN THE FALL/WINTER OF 2015, THE PRIORITY HEALTH NEEDS WERE DETERMINED VIA AN ONLINE SURVEY TOOL FOR THE COMMUNITY WELLSTAR LEGACY HOSPITALS SERVE."

Participants were invited by the Glendale Hospital Collaborative, leveraging its extensive networks and relationships within the greater Glendale area and the Glendale Healthier Community Coalition. These stakeholders represented a broad range of geographic, public health, and population interest in compliance with the ACA. The goal of this component of the CHNA was to identify broad health outcomes and drivers (which, combined are health needs), as well as assets and gaps in resources, through the perceptions and knowledge of varied and multiple stakeholders. The CHNA included the collection of over 300 data indicators that helped illustrate the health states of the community. Secondary data were collected from a wide range of local, county, state, and national sources to present demographics, mortality, morbidity, health behaviors, clinical care, social and economic factors, and physical environment.

For each health need the hospital plans to address, the Implementation Strategy describes: actions the hospital intends to take, including programs and resources it plans to commit, planned collaboration between the hospital and community organizations, and anticipated impacts of these actions. In addition to the specific strategies for the selected priority health needs, USC Verdugo Hills Hospital will investigate the development of a community grants program to provide financial and in-kind support to community organizations addressing these needs. Other health needs were identified but are not specifically addressed in the Implementation Strategy. These include: cardiovascular disease, geriatric support,communicable/infectious diseases, dental care, homelessness/housing, poverty, preventive wellness, STDs, substance abuse, transportation, and violence/injury. While these issues are addressed on a day-to-day basis in the normal course of operations, the hospital has chosen not to focus this Implementation Plan on these other needs as it believes that it can have a greater impact on the priority health needs that were selected. These other health needs are less aligned with the Hospitals strategic initiatives. Additionally, while some of these needs are not being directly addressed, it should also be noted that health needs can influence one another.

HSHS St. Elizabeth's Hospital completed a 10-month planning and implementation effort to develop the CHNA, identify and prioritize community health needs for its service area and formulate an implementation plan to guide ongoing population health initiatives with like-missioned partners and collaborators. The process and methods used to conduct the assessment required leveraging both internal and external individuals and groups. These planning and development activities included the following internal and external steps: HSHS St. Elizabeth's senior leadership engaged University of Illinois Survey Research Office in Springfield, to provide quantitative and secondary data and community health data on the HSHS St. Elizabeth's service area. In addition, the team, along with members of the community benefits committee, identified additional data sets to review and discuss. Additional data included the top 10 emergency department discharge diagnosis, the top 10 inpatient diagnosis and a review of two of the surveys that were conducted as part of the St. Clair County MAPP process (mobilizing action through process and partnerships). In addition, they took into serious consideration the information provided by the stakeholder community leader focus group. The team also reviewed the FY2015 CHNA. A core group of HSHS St. Elizabeth's colleagues provided valuable input for the FY2018 CHNA. This focus group discussed the data, shared insights from their perspective vantage point and identified their top three healthcare areas of focus. HSHS St. Elizabeth's Hospital also leveraged existing relationships that provided diverse input for a comprehensive review and analysis of community health needs in the hospital's service area. External components and steps included working in concert with the St. Clair County Health Department IPLAN process. In anticipation of the HSHS St. Elizabeth's CHNA, the hospital worked collaboratively with the St. Clair County Health Department as a partner to lead one aspect of the MAPP process. In addition, the hospital fully supported all aspects of the IPLAN development. St. Clair County hosted their annual Healthcare Policy Summit with keynote speaker Tyler Norris and a panel of regional health care leaders. The summit generated collective energy around the county health rankings and an unprecedented commitment by community leaders to get involved. This increased awareness by a broad section of the community offers great potential for further collaboration throughout the county. For the first time, two other local hospitals partnered with HSHS St. Elizabeth's to conduct a focus group on the perceptions of the health needs of St. Clair County residents from the perspective of community leaders. Community leaders were invited based on their awareness and expertise in the needs of our community. There was particular attention, roughly 30%, afforded to those who work with the under-served, low income, and minority populations.

Taught hands only CPR in area grade schools. One 5th grade participant recognized that her father was not feeling well and asked if she should call 911 since her mother was not at home. The ambulance arrived and the father had a cardiac arrest on the way to the hospital.
