201803199349318125,263162145,"Schedule H, Part V, Section B, Line 3e Prioritized Health Needs",IU Health Arnett's 2015 Community Health Needs Assessment (CHNA) Report includes a prioritized description of significant health needs in the community. The CHNA report identified the following four needs as priorities for IU Health Arnett: - Nutrition and Active Living - Access to Healthcare - Behavioral Health - Chronic Disease Management
201803199349318125,263162145,"Schedule H, Part V, Section B, Line 5 Input from Community","IU Health Arnett's approach to gathering qualitative data for its CHNA consisted of a multi-component approach to identify and verify community health needs for the IU Health Arnett service area. This included the following two components: 1. Hosting a one-and-a-half to two-hour community conversation focus group with public health officials and community leaders to discuss the healthcare needs of the service area and what role IU Health Arnett could play in addressing the identified needs. 2. Surveying the community-at-large through the hospital's website and in paper surveys, with special attention paid to gathering input from low income, uninsured or minority groups. Local leaders with a stake in the community's health were invited to attend focus group sessions held at IU Health Arnett. Attendees from organizations, such as the Tippecanoe County Health Department, Mental Health America, Wabash Center, YMCA, United Way, and the Salvation Army among others participated in the focus group. To obtain a more complete picture of the factors that play into the health of people living in Tippecanoe County, input from local health leaders was gathered through two separate focus group sessions. The session lasted two hours and was held live at IU Health Arnett Hospital. IU Health Arnett facilitators mailed letters and made follow-up telephone calls inviting public health officials and community leaders to attend the focus group discussion, paying special attention to include organizations that represent the interest of low-income, minority and uninsured individuals. The goal of soliciting these leaders feedback was to gather insights into the quantitative data that may not be easily identified from the secondary statistical data alone. Upon arrival at the focus group, participants were asked to identify and prioritize five health needs for the IU Health Arnett community that they believed to be most important. These responses were collected and aggregated into a comprehensive list of identified needs to be further discussed later in the session and ranked for severity of need within the community. IU Health Arnett facilitators then provided participants with a presentation featuring the mission of IU Health, current outreach priorities and local health data which included demographics, insurance information, poverty rates, county health rankings, causes of death, physical activity, chronic conditions, preventive behaviors and a community needs index. Upon completion of the data presentation, IU Health facilitated a discussion on the comprehensive list of identified needs collected earlier in the session. The objective of this method was to inspire candid discussion. After the discussion, each participant again prioritized five health needs. The votes on the five prioritized health needs were tallied and final input from the group was encouraged during this process in order to validate the previously identified needs. Following additional discussion, participants were also asked to address what they thought the role of IU Health Arnett could be in meeting the local health needs."

201803199349318125,263162145,"Schedule H, Part V, Section B, Line 11 Addressing Identified Needs","IU Health Arnett prioritized and determined which of the community health needs identified in its most recently conducted CHNA were most critical for it to address by using the Hanlon Method of prioritization. This method prioritizes identified needs based upon the prevalence and severity of the need and the effectiveness of interventions available to address the needs. Based upon the Hanlon Method of prioritization, IU Health Arnett selected the following four needs to be addressed: - Access to Healthcare - Nutrition and Active Living - Behavioral Health - Chronic Disease Management Access to Healthcare IU Health Arnett's implementation strategy to address the identified need of access to healthcare includes the following: - Provide financial assistance and information on prescription assistance to those in need - Prescription Discount Cards - Low cost physicals for high school athletes - Car safety seat checks - Support groups (Cancer/Obesity/Breastfeeding/diabetes) - Work with city bus to obtain route to the hospital and new medical office building Nutrition and Active Living IU Health Arnett's implementation strategy to address the identified need of nutrition and active living includes the following: - Community Walking programs - Strong Schools Glen Acres, Murdock, Oakland & Miller - Nutrition Education at Farmer's Markets (4H fair or Farmer's Markets) - Health & Safety Fair - Medical Weight Loss Clinical Trial - Educational Programs at local senior residences - Meals on Wheels Behavioral Health IU Health Arnett's implementation strategy to address the identified need of behavioral health includes the following: - Identify patients who need intervention for drug/alcohol abuse - Educate community members to know the warning signs of those in mental crisis - Teen Texting Program - Tobacco Cessation/1-800-QUIT-NOW - Provide outpatient access to community members requiring behavioral health services - Work in collaboration with Sycamore Springs, River Bend Hospital to serve community members in need of inpatient behavioral health services Chronic Disease Management IU Health Arnett's implementation strategy to address the identified need of chronic disease management includes the following: - Community events that provide health education including, blood pressure and cholesterol screenings, Sleep Quiz, Support Groups and Diabetes education - Aging Brain Program - Provide support for patients/family members supporting those with dementia Also, based upon the Hanlon Method of prioritization, the following identified community health needs were not amongst the needs chosen to be addressed: - Prenatal Health - Injury Prevention - Pre K-12 Education After completing a gap analysis, IU Health Arnett determined that the severity and lack of resources available to address the four needs chosen to be addressed outweigh the severity of and resources available to address the three needs not chosen."
201803199349318125,263162145,"Schedule H, Part V, Section B, Line 13b Income Level Other than FPG","In addition to FPG, IU Health Arnett may take into consideration a patients income and/or ability to pay in calculation of a financial assistance award."
201803199349318125,263162145,"Schedule H, Part V, Section B, Line 13h Other FAP Factors","IU Health Arnett takes into consideration several other factors in determining patient eligibility for financial assistance. These factors include the following: 1. IU Healths Individual Solutions Department Prior to seeking Financial Assistance under the FAP, all patients or their guarantors must consult with a member of IU Healths Individual Solutions department to determine if healthcare coverage may be obtained from a government insurance/assistance product or from the Health Insurance Exchange Marketplace. 2. Alternate Sources of Assistance When technically feasible, a patient will exhaust all other state and federal assistance programs prior to receiving an award from IU Health Arnetts Financial Assistance Program. Patients who may be eligible for coverage under an applicable insurance policy, including, but not limited to, health, automobile, and homeowners, must exhaust all insurance benefits prior to receiving an award from IU Health Arnetts Financial Assistance Program. This includes patients covered under their own policy and those who may be entitled to benefits from a third-party policy. Patients may be asked to show proof that such a claim was properly submitted to the proper insurance provider at the request of IU Health Arnett. Eligible patients who receive medical care from IU Health Arnett as a result of an injury proximately caused by a third party, and later receive a monetary settlement or award from said third party, may receive Financial Assistance for any outstanding balance not covered by the settlement or award to which IU Health Arnett is entitled. In the event a Financial Assistance Award has already been granted in such circumstances, IU Health Arnett reserves the right to reverse the award in an amount equal to the amount IU Health Arnett would be entitled to receive had no Financial Assistance been awarded. 3. Alternate Methods of Eligibility Determination IU Health Arnett will conduct a quarterly review of all accounts placed with a collection agency partner for a period of no less than one hundred and twenty (120) days after the account is eligible for an Extraordinary Collection Action (""ECA""). Said accounts may be eligible for assistance under the FAP based on the patients individual scoring criteria. To ensure all patients potentially eligible for Financial Assistance under the FAP may receive Financial Assistance, IU Health Arnett will deem patients/guarantors to be presumptively eligible for Financial Assistance if they are found to be eligible for one of the following programs, received emergency or direct admit care, and satisfied his/her required co-pay/deductible: - Indiana Childrens Special Health Care Services - Medicaid - Healthy Indiana Plan - Patients who are awarded Hospital Presumptive Eligibility (HPE) - Enrolled in a state and/or federal program that verifies the patient's gross household income is less than or equal to 200% of the Federal Poverty Level 4. Additional Considerations Financial Assistance may be granted to a deceased patients account if said patient is found to have no estate. Additionally, IU Health Arnett will deny or revoke Financial Assistance for any patient or guarantor who falsifies any portion of a Financial Assistance application. 5. Non-Emergent Services Down Payment Uninsured Patients presenting for scheduled or other non-emergent services will not be charged more than the Amounts Generally Billed (""AGB"") AGB for their services. Patients will receive an estimated AGB cost of their care prior to IU Health Arnett rendering the services and will be asked to pay a down-payment percentage of the AGB adjusted cost prior to receiving services. In the event a patient is unable to fulfill the down-payment, their service may be rescheduled for a later date as medically prudent and in accordance with all applicable federal and state laws and/or regulations. 6. Emergency Services Non-Refundable Deposit This section will be implemented with a strict adherence to EMTALA and IU Health Policy ADM 1.32, Screening and Transfer of Emergency or Unstable Patients. Amount of Non-Refundable Deposit All Uninsured Patients presenting for services at IU Health Arnetts Emergency Department, via transfer from another hospital facility, or direct admission, will be responsible for a one-hundred dollar ($100.00) non-refundable deposit for services rendered. Patients/guarantors will be responsible for any copays and/or deductibles required by their plan prior to full Financial Assistance being applied. Uninsured Patients wishing to make an application for Financial Assistance greater than the AGB must fulfill their non-refundable deposit prior to IU Health Arnett processing said application. Uninsured Patients making payments toward their outstanding non-refundable deposit balance will have said payments applied to their oldest application on file, if applicable."

These measures include the following: 1. Conspicuous public displays will be posted in appropriate acute care settings such as the emergency department and registration areas describing the available assistance and directing eligible patients to the Financial Assistance Application. 2. IU Health Arnett will include a conspicuous written notice on all patient billing statements that notifies the patient about the availability of this Policy, and the telephone number of its Customer Service Department which can assist patients with any questions they may have regarding this Policy. 3. IU Health Customer Service representatives will be available via telephone Monday through Friday, excluding major holidays, from 8:00 a.m. to 7:00 p.m. Eastern Time to address questions related to this Policy. 4. IU Health Arnett will broadly communicate this Policy as part of its general outreach efforts. 5.

IN SHORT, THE WORKGROUP EXTENSIVELY REVIEWED THE NEW YORK STATE PREVENTION AGENDA WITH PARTICULAR INTEREST IN THE COUNTY LEVEL DASHBOARDS. THE CHIW GROUP EXAMINED AREAS IN WHICH MONROE COUNTY WAS IDENTIFIED AS WORSE THAN NEW YORK STATE AS A WHOLE OR IN WHICH MONROE COUNTY WAS NOT PREVIOUSLY ABLE TO MEET THE PREVENTION AGENDA TARGET. ADDITIONALLY, THE GROUP LOOKED FOR NEW OR EMERGING TROUBLESOME HEALTH TRENDS THAT MAY NOT HAVE BEEN IDENTIFIED AS A PREVENTION AGENDA TARGET. THIRTEEN AREAS OF PARTICULAR CONCERN WERE IDENTIFIED AND WERE PRIORITIZED ACCORDING TO WHERE THE COMMUNITY HAD THE GREATEST POTENTIAL FOR MAKING THE MOST IMPACT WITHIN THE 3-6 YEAR TIMEFRAME. THE FOLLOWING HEALTH NEEDS WERE IDENTIFIED AND PRIORITIES SELECTED: Selected: Tobacco Use Chronic Disease Care Childhood Health Unplanned Pregnancy Substance Abuse Additional areas of concern: Obesity STD morbidity Colorectal Cancer Adverse childhood experiences Violence Suicide Premature Birth Teen pregnancy INTERVENTIONS WERE PLANNED AROUND THE SELECTED AREAS OF TOBACCO CESSATION, CHRONIC DISEASE MANAGEMENT, CHILDHOOD HEALTH, UNPLANNED PREGNANCY AND SUBSTANCE ABUSE. THE OTHER AREAS OF CONCERN WERE NOT ADDRESSED IN THE IMPROVEMENT PLAN, PRIMARILY BECAUSE OF LIMITED RESOURCES, LACK OF FUNDING AND TIME, AS WELL AS AVOIDING MISSION CREEP FOR THE HOSPITALS. OBESITY, ALTHOUGH A MAJOR PROBLEM IN OUR COMMUNITY WAS NOT SELECTED BECAUSE THE CHIW WAS NOT CLEAR ON AN EFFECTIVE INTERVENTION GIVEN THE 3-YEAR IMPLEMENTATION PERIOD. COLORECTAL CANCER SCREENINGS ARE BEING ADDRESSED THROUGH THE CANCER SERVICES DEPARTMENT WITHIN THE CENTER FOR COMMUNITY HEALTH, AND ONLY IMPACTS A SMALLER SUBSET OF THE POPULATION. ADVERSE CHILDHOOD EXPRIENCES, VIOLENCE AND SUICIDE PREVENTION ALL CENTER AROUND MENTAL HEALTH WHICH IS THE PRIMARY FOCUS OF THE DSRIP INITIATIVE IN OUR COMMUNITY, AND VIOLENCE PREVENTION WAS THOUGHT TO BE BEYOND THE MISSION OF THE HOSPITALS AT THIS TIME. STDS, PREMATURE BIRTHS AND TEEN PREGNANCIES SOMEWHAT OVERLAP WITH THE UNPLANNED PREGNANCY PRIORITY AREA THAT WAS SELECTED. EDUCATION AROUND AVOIDING RISKY SEXUAL BEHAVIOR, AS RECOMMENDED TO ADDRESS UNPLANNED PREGNANCY, WILL ALSO IMPACT THESE AREAS OF CONCERN. OF COURSE, WITH UNLIMITED RESOURCES, WE WOULD ADDRESS ALL THESE AREAS, BUT UNFORTUNATELY WE NEED TO PRIORITIZE FOR THE GIVEN TIME PERIOD. THE HOSPITAL IS ADDRESSING THE SIGNIFICANT NEEDS IDENTIFIED IN THE 2016 CHNA THROUGH MANY INTERVENTIONS DESCRIBED IN THE IMPLEMENTATION STRATEGY. PROGRESS ON THE IMPLEMENTATION STRATEGY IS WIDELY AVAILABLE TO THE PUBLIC AND CAN BE FOUND ON THE SAME WEBSITE AS THE CHNA: (https://www.urmc.rochester.edu/community.aspx). TOBACCO USE: IMPLEMENTATION EFFORTS CONTINUE FOR SMOKING CESSATION, AT THE TIME OF THE CHNA 2016, UNIVERSITY OF ROCHESTER STRONG AND HIGHLAND WERE WORKING TO ADOPT AN OPT-TO-QUIT POLICY WHERE IDENTIFIED SMOKERS WILL BE AUTOMATICALLY REFERRED TO THE NY STATE QUIT LINE. EMR CHANGES WERE IN PROCESS AND THE POLICY HAS BEEN IMPLEMENTED AT STRONG HIGHLAND. THE OBJECTIVES FOR THIS FOCUS AREA INCLUDE: Objective 1.1: UR STRONG will enact a tobacco cessation policy that incorporates the opt-to-quit program and will implement that policy thereby electronically linking tobacco using patients to the NYS quit line. Objective 1.3: UR STRONG WILL WORK TO decrease the percent of women who smoke during pregnancy from 11% of births (2013 vital statistics) to less than 10% of births, and to especially concentrate on those women who receive Medicaid baseline 20% of births were smoking during pregnancy. UR STRONG AGREES WITH THE CONCEPT OF REFERRING ALL TOBACCO USERS TO THE NY STATE QUITLINE VIA THE EMR. IMPLEMENTATION EFFORTS FOR THE 2016-18 TIME PERIOD WILL INCLUDE ESTABLISHING THE EMR CHANGES, ASSURING PRIVATE TRANSFER OF DATA TO THE QUITLINE, ESTABLISHING FEEDBACK TO THE REFERRING PHYSICIANS AND EVALUATING THE INCREASE IN REFERRALS TO THE QUITLINE. UR STRONG IS ALSO ADDRESSING SMOKING DURING PREGNANCY BY LINKING PATIENTS WITHIN THE BABY LOVE PROGRAM WITH THE MOMMY AND ME TOBACCO FREE PROGRAM TO INCREASE CESSATION. CHRONIC DISEASE CARE: OUR WORK HERE FOCUSES ON HYPERTENTION CONTROL. TO ADDRESS BLOOD PRESSURE CONTROL, UR CONTINUES TO BE AN ACTIVE MEMBER OF THE ROCHESTER BUSINESS ALLIANCE (CHAMBER OF COMMERCE) HEALTH CARE PLANNING TEAM THAT MEETS WEEKLY AND IS FOCUSING ON HYPERTENSION. UR HAS MANAGED A COMMUNITY HEALTH WORKER PROGRAM THAT CONCENTRATED ON BLOOD PRESSURE CONTROL BUT IS NO LONGER ACTIVE, CONTRIBUTES TO A REGIONAL REGISTRY OF HYPERTENSIVE PATIENTS, HELPS FUND IMPROVEMENT INITIATIVES, AND PARTICIPATES IN THE PRACTICE IMPROVEMENT CONSULTANT PROGRAM TO INCREASE CONTROL RATES. THE OBJECTIVES FOR THIS FOCUS AREA INCLUDE: Objective 2.1: By December 2018, decrease the disparity among hypertensive residents in the local registry who have their blood pressure in control by increasing the control rate among Monroe County African Americans [58.8% and Latinos (61.5%) compared to Whites (75.4%)] Objective 2.2: Increase the control rate for hypertensive patients who also have diabetes ADDRESSING DISPARITY IN HYPERTENSION CONTROL RATES WILL INCLUDE COLLABORATION WITH THE DSRIP CULTURAL COMPETENCY WORKGROUP AS WELL AS THE REGISTRY REPORTING FUNCTION. CHILDHOOD HEALTH: UR STRONG IS WORKING TO IMPROVING CHILDHOOD HEALTH BY FOLLOWING THE APA GUIDELINE TO SCREEN ALL CHILDREN FOR FOOD INSECURITY AT WELL CHILD VISITS. THE OBJECTIVE FOR THIS FOCUS AREA IS: Objective 4.1: Decrease the percent of children living in food insecure households from 20.5% (Feeding America, 2014) while also striving to decrease the percent of adults who experienced food insecurity in the past year worried or stressed about having enough money to buy nutritious meals (EBRFSS2013-4) from 23% in Monroe County.

UR STRONG IS COMMITTED TO CHANGING THIS RULE AND ASSURING THE MEDICAID CLIENTS CAN RECEIVE LARC AT DELIVERY IF DESIRED. THIS RULE WAS CHANGED IN 2017 AND STRONG ASSURED THAT POST PARTUM LARC WAS REIMBURSED FOR MEDICAID PATIENTS. OTHER BARRIERS TO BE ADDRESSED INCLUDE LACK OF EDUCATION AND LACK OF TRAINING ON INSERTION. IN ADDITION TO LOGISTICAL BARRIERS TO LARC, UNPLANNED PREGNANCY CAN BE REDUCED BY WORKING TO EDUCATE YOUTH IN OUR COMMUNITY AROUND SAFE SECUARY HEALTH AND GOAL SETTING, ETC. UR AND THE CHIW WILL WORK WITH COMMUNITY AGENCIES, PARTICULARY THE METRO COUNCIL FOR TEEN POTENTIAL. SUSTANCE ABUSE: UR STRONG WILL JOIN OTHER LEAD AGENCIES TO ADDRESS THE OPIOID EPIDEMIC PLAGUING OUR COMMUNITY.

Certain other health needs were identified but are not specifically addressed in the Implementation Strategy. These include, for example: dental health, mental health, community safety, STDs and substance abuse. While the hospitals address these issues on a day to day basis in the normal course of operations, they have chosen not to focus these Implementation Plans on these other needs because they believe they can have a greater impact on the priority health needs selected.

Participants were invited by the Glendale Hospital Collaborative, leveraging its extensive networks and relationships within the greater Glendale area and the Glendale Healthier Community Coalition. These stakeholders represented a broad range of geographic, public health, and population interest in compliance with the ACA. The goal of this component of the CHNA was to identify broad health outcomes and drivers (which, combined are health needs), as well as assets and gaps in resources, through the perceptions and knowledge of varied and multiple stakeholders. The CHNA included the collection of over 300 data indicators that helped illustrate the health states of the community. Secondary data were collected from a wide range of local, county, state, and national sources to present demographics, mortality, morbidity, health behaviors, clinical care, social and economic factors, and physical environment. These categories are based on the Mobilizing Action Toward Community Health (MATCH) framework, which illustrates the interrelationships among the elements of health and their relationship to each other: social and economic factors, health behaviors, clinical care, physical, environmental, and health outcomes.

PART V, SECTION B, LINE 11: The significant health needs identified from the CHNA were prioritized by community stakeholders through a structured process using defined criteria. This Implementation Strategy focuses on the priority health needs that will be addressed by USC Verdugo Hills Hospital through its community benefit programs and activities. They are: - Access to care - Cancer - Diabetes - Mental health - Overweight/obesity The Implementation Strategy adopted by USC Verdugo Hills Hospital actively addresses health needs that were identified in the CHNA as priority health needs. USC Verdugo Hills Hospital plans to meet the identified priority health needs through a commitment of resources with specific programs and services. For each health need the hospital plans to address, the Implementation Strategy describes: actions the hospital intends to take, including programs and resources it plans to commit, planned collaboration between the hospital and community organizations, and anticipated impacts of these actions. In addition to the specific strategies for the selected priority health needs, USC Verdugo Hills Hospital will investigate the development of a community grants program to provide financial and in-kind support to community organizations addressing these needs. Other health needs were identified but are not specifically addressed in the Implementation Strategy. These include: cardiovascular disease, geriatric support,communicable/infectious diseases, dental care, homelessness/housing, poverty, preventive wellness, STDs, substance abuse, transportation, and violence/injury. While these issues are addressed on a day-to-day basis in the normal course of operations, the hospital has chosen not to focus this Implementation Plan on these other needs as it believes that it can have a greater impact on the priority health needs that were selected. These other health needs are less aligned with the Hospitals strategic initiatives. Additionally, while some of these needs are not being directly addressed, it should also be noted that health needs can influence one another. For example, reducing weight and improving nutrition and physical activity have been shown to positively influence cardiovascular disease.
