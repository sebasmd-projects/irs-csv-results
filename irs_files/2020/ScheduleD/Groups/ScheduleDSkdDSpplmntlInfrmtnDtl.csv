The College is also recognized by the Franchise Tax Board as exempt from California state tax on related income under Section 23701d of the California Revenue and Taxation Code. The College has identified and evaluated significant tax positions in its significant tax jurisdictions which are the federal and California state tax jurisdictions. The College has also determined that the open tax years are generally three years for federal and four years for California tax purposes. Thus, the general open tax years are the years ended June 30, 2015 through June 30, 2018 for federal purposes and the years ended June 30, 2014 through June 30, 2018 for California purposes. For federal there is an unrelated business income net operating loss carryover of approximately $1,797,000 and $1,795,000 as of June 30, 2019 and 2018, respectively. For California there is an unrelated business income net operating loss carryover of approximately $1,829,000 and $1,745,000 as of June 30, 2019 and 2018, respectively. A net operating loss can only be reflected as a benefit (deferred tax asset) on the statement of financial position when it is likely that the loss would be utilized against taxable income in another tax year. Since there is not presently a likelihood of taxable income in another tax year, the College has recorded a full valuation allowance for the deferred tax assets on the statement of financial position for these net operating loss carryovers. There have been no related tax penalties or interest, which would be classified as tax expense in the statement of activities. The net operating loss carryover will begin to expire June 30, 2025 for federal purposes and June 30, 2019 for California purposes. The College applied ASC 740-10-25, Accounting for Uncertainty in Income Taxes, to all tax positions for which the statute of limitations remained open and determined there were no material unrecognized tax benefits as of the year ended June 30, 2019 and the year ended June 30, 2018, nor are any changes anticipated in the twelve months following June 30, 2019."

The University files a Form 990 annually. When these returns are filed , it is highly certain that some positions taken would be sustained upon examination by the taxing authorities, while others are subject to uncertainty about the merits of the tax position taken or the amount of the position that would ultimately be sustained. Examples of tax positions common to universities include such matters as the following: the tax exempt status of each entity and various positions relative to potential sources of unrelated business income tax (UBIT). UBIT is reported on Form 990-T, as appropriate. The benefit of a tax position is recognized in the financial statements in the period during which, based on all available evidence, management believes that it is more likely than not that the position will be sustained upon examination, including the resolution of appeals or litigation processes, if any. Tax positions are not offset or aggregated with other positions. Tax positions that meet the ""more likely than not"" recognition threshold are measured as the largest amount of tax benefit that is more than 50% likely to be realized on settlement with the applicable taxing authority. The portion of the benefits associated with tax positions taken that exceeds the amount measured as described above would be reflected as a liability for uncertain tax benefits in the accompanying statements of financial position along with any associated interest and penalties that would be payable to the taxing authorities upon examination. As of June 30, 2019 and 2018, there were no uncertain tax positions identified. The University does not expect the total amount of unrecognized tax benefits to significantly change in the next 12 months. Forms 990 and 990-T filed by the University are subject to the examination by the IRS up to three years from the extended due date of each return. Management believes the Forms 990 and 990-T have been filed appropriately. The University would recognize interest and penalties related to unrecognized tax positions in interest and income tax expense, respectively. The University has no amounts accrued for interest or penalties as of June 30, 2019 and 2018."

The IRS issued a determination letter in January 1938 that recognized the University as exempt from federal income tax under Section 501(c)(3). The IRS confirmed in 2008 that this exemption still applies. The University has 10 subsidiary corporations that are included in the consolidated financial statements. Two of these subsidiary corporations are exempt from federal income taxes under 501(c)(2), one is exempt under 501(c)(3), one is exempt under 501(c)(4), four are exempt under 501(c)(25) and two are subject to taxation. The University is classified as an organization that is not a private foundation under Section 509(a) of the Internal Revenue Code because it is described in Sections 509(a)(1) and 170(b)(1)(A)(ii) and, as such, gifts to the University qualify for deduction as charitable contributions to the extent provided by law. The University and its subsidiary corporations that are exempt from federal income tax are required to pay federal income tax on unrelated business income. The amount of income tax expense for unrelated business income for the University and its subsidiary corporations was immaterial for the years ended June 30, 2019 and 2018, respectively. The Tax Cuts and Jobs Act of 2017 (the Act) contained a provision affecting private colleges and universities with at least 500 tuition-paying students and assets of at least $500,000 per student. Because the University meets those criteria, beginning in fiscal 2019 it became part of a small group of universities that are subject to an excise tax of 1.4% on the University's net investment income and the net investment income of its subsidiary corporations. The excise tax is an expense that is recognized as a reduction of the University's investment returns. The University and its subsidiary corporations recorded an estimated income tax liability of $7,500 for the excise tax for the year ended June 30, 2019. The University has reflected the tax liabilities in the financial statements based on reasonable estimates under the currently available regulatory guidance on the Act. US GAAP requires the University to evaluate its tax positions to recognize a tax liability (or asset) if the University has taken an uncertain tax position that, more likely than not, would not be sustained upon examination by the IRS. The University has analyzed the tax positions taken and has concluded that as of June 30, 2019, there are no significant uncertain positions taken or expected to be taken, apart from those impacted by the Act."

The Foundation does not expect the total amount of unrecognized tax benefits to significantly change in the next 12 months.

The Foundation did not have any amounts accrued for interest and penalties at June 30, 2019 and 2018. As a not-for-profit entity, the Foundation is exempt from federal and state income taxes.

The Hood Museum of Art at Dartmouth College is one of the oldest and largest college museums in the country. The collections of the Hood, which number some 65,000 objects, are rich, diverse, and available for the use by both Dartmouth and the broader community. Access to works of art is provided through permanent collection displays, the online collections database, special exhibitions, the website, scholarly publications, and programs and events. These exhibits and programs are an exciting learning resource for students and the academic community. The Hood offers a vital curricular resource, a source for lectures, gallery talks, symposia, and receptions for the public, and an on-line database of thousands of works. The Dartmouth College Library is committed to partnering with faculty and students to enhance and showcase Dartmouth scholarly output and entreprenurial endeavors. The Library provides immersive and transformative learning experiences, prepares students for a lifetime of learning and responsible leadership, and proactively supports undergraduate, graduate, and professional student academic success through innovative educational programs. The Library offers creative workspaces for individual and collaborative scholarly enquiry and aims to promote well-being as well as stimulate innovative thinking. The Rauner Special Collections Library houses Dartmouth's Archives, the Rare Books Collections, and the Manuscripts Collection. Dartmouth's Archives documents the history of the College through the historical records of the institution and the three professional schools, as well as the history of the surrounding area through selected collections related to local businesses and organizations. Totaling more than 100,000 volumes, Dartmouth's rare book collections constitute a resource of major importance to the institution and the scholarly world at large. The manuscript collections contain over six and a half million unique and original items.

The endowment is composed of both restricted funds, for which donors designate a specific purpose for their gifts, and unrestricted funds. There are over 6,000 separate funds that make up Dartmouth's endowment. Dartmouth's endowment spending policy seeks to balance the competing objectives of supporting the current generation of students and faculty with the need to preserve the endowment's purchasing power for future generations.

The OCIO managing the majority of the University investments is The Investment Fund for Foundation (TIFF). The University owns interests in two different products structured as a partnership fund which invests with a wide variety of investment products and vehicles. Since the University does not own a direct interest in the underlying investments themselves but gains exposure through the ownership interest in the overarching fund, the investments are classified as alternative investments although the actual underlying exposure is much more typical of a common university endowment portfolio. The assets comprising the alternative investments reported are investments in TIFF's Multi-Asset Fund (""MAF""), TIFF's The Keystone Fund (""TKF""), and certain legacy private equity investments managed by Hirtle Callaghan. The MAF has daily liquidity, and is comprised of underlying investments in funds focused on equity, debt, and commodity securities employing a variety of strategies. Asset types for the MAF include global equities, high yield bonds, resource-related equity, real estate investment trusts hedge funds, asset-backed securities, commodity futures, opportunistic credit assets, conventional bonds, treasury inflation-protected securities, and cash. TKF, has quarterly liquidity with 180 days' notice, and similar to the MAF, TKF invests in the same types of investments as the MAF with the addition of private equity investments. The University's exposure to private investments when taking into account the underlying assets of the MAF and TKF, was approximately $25.8 million and $24.1 million as of June 30, 2019 and 2018, respectively. This equates to 23.6% and 23.1% of the total endowment balances for June 30, 2019 and 2018, respectively.

This guidance requires the university to reclassify its net assets i.e., previously unrestricted, temporarily restricted, and permanently restricted into two categories net assets with donor restrictions and net assets without donor restrictions. Per the instructions to the 990, the university has opted to leave the temporarily restricted endowment funds blank and has reported all endowed assets subject to donor-imposed restrictions on Line 2b. This is consistent with how the university reported endowed assets within the audited financial statements."

The Tax Cuts and Jobs Act the Act was enacted on December 22, 2017. The Act impacts the university in several ways, including new excise taxes on executive compensation and net investment income, increases to unrelated business taxable income UBTI by the amount of certain fringe benefits for which a deduction is not allowed, changes to the net operating loss rules, repeal of the alternative minimum tax AMT, and the computation of UBTI separately for each unrelated trade or business. Further, the Act reduces the U.S. federal corporate tax rate and federal corporate unrelated business income tax rate from 35 to 21. The overall impact of the Act remains uncertain and the full impact of the Act will not be known until further regulatory guidance is provided to assist the university with calculating income and excise tax liabilities. The university continues to evaluate the impact of tax reform on the organization. As of June 30, 2019, the university has made a reasonable estimate of the determinable effects of the enactment of the Act on existing deferred tax balances. These amounts are provisional, subject to change and not material to the universitys consolidated finanacial statements. Management believes the university has no uncertain tax positions that result in material unrecognized tax expense/benefits."

ENDOWMENT FUNDS INCLUDE INVESTED GIFTS AND CASH. AS REQUIRED BY GENERALLY ACCEPTED ACCOUNTING PRINCIPLES, THE COLLEGE CLASSIFIES AS DONOR RESTRICTED NET ASSETS (A) THE ORIGINAL VALUE OF GIFTS DONATED TO THE PERMANENT ENDOWMENT, (B) THE ORIGINAL VALUE OF SUBSEQUENT GIFTS TO THE PERMANENT ENDOWMENT, AND (C) ACCUMULATIONS TO THE PERMANENT ENDOWMENT MADE IN ACCORDANCE WITH THE DIRECTION OF THE APPLICABLE DONOR GIFT INSTRUMENT AT THE TIME THE ACCUMULATION IS ADDED TO THE FUND.

IN ACCORDANCE WITH THE UNIFORM PRUDENT MANAGEMENT OF INSTITUTIONAL FUNDS ACT, THE COLLEGE MAY CONSIDER THE FOLLOWING FACTORS IN MAKING A DETERMINATION TO APPROPRIATE OR ACCUMULATE DONOR-RESTRICTED ENDOWMENT FUNDS: THE DURATION AND PRESERVATION OF THE FUND; THE PURPOSES OF THE COLLEGE AND THE DONOR-RESTRICTED ENDOWMENT FUND; GENERAL ECONOMIC CONDITIONS; THE POSSIBLE EFFECT OF INFLATION AND DEFLATION; THE EXPECTED TOTAL RETURN FROM INCOME AND THE APPRECIATION OF INVESTMENTS; OTHER RESOURCES OF THE COLLEGE; AND THE INVESTMENT POLICIES OF THE COLLEGE. THE COLLEGE HAS ADOPTED INVESTMENT AND SPENDING POLICIES FOR ITS BOARD-DESIGNATED AND OTHER ENDOWMENT ASSETS THAT ATTEMPT TO PROVIDE A PREDICTABLE STREAM OF FUNDING FOR ITS PROGRAMS WHILE SEEKING TO MAINTAIN THE PURCHASING POWER OF THE ENDOWMENT ASSETS. UNDER THIS POLICY, AS APPROVED BY THE BOARD, THE ENDOWMENT ASSETS ARE INVESTED IN A PORTFOLIO OF DEBT AND EQUITY SECURITIES WITH THE OBJECTIVE OF ACHIEVING LONG-TERM CAPITAL APPRECIATION WHILE MODERATING THE LEVEL OF INVESTMENT RISK. ACTUAL RETURNS IN ANY GIVEN YEAR MAY VARY FROM THIS AMOUNT. TO SATISFY ITS LONG-TERM RATE-OF-RETURN OBJECTIVES, THE COLLEGE RELIES ON A TOTAL RETURN STRATEGY IN WHICH INVESTMENT RETURNS ARE ACHIEVED THROUGH BOTH CAPITAL APPRECIATION (REALIZED AND UNREALIZED) AND CURRENT YIELD (INTEREST AND DIVIDENDS). THE COLLEGE HAS INVESTED IN DEBT AND EQUITY SECURITIES THAT TARGET A DIVERSIFIED ASSET ALLOCATION THAT PLACES A GREATER EMPHASIS ON EQUITY-BASED INVESTMENTS TO ACHIEVE ITS LONG-TERM RETURN OBJECTIVES WITHIN PRUDENT RISK CONSTRAINTS. THE COLLEGE HAS A POLICY OF APPROPRIATING FOR DISTRIBUTION EACH YEAR 5.00% OF THE TWELVE QUARTER AVERAGE FAIR MARKET VALUE OF THE ENDOWMENT CALCULATED AS OF JUNE 30 FOR THE PRECEDING THE YEAR IN WHICH THE DISTRIBUTION IS PLANNED. IN ESTABLISHING THIS POLICY, THE COLLEGE CONSIDERED THE LONG-TERM EXPECTED RETURN ON ITS ENDOWMENT. THIS IS CONSISTENT WITH THE COLLEGE'S OBJECTIVE TO MAINTAIN THE PURCHASING POWER OF ITS ENDOWMENT. FROM TIME TO TIME, THE FAIR VALUE OF ASSETS ASSOCIATED WITH INDIVIDUAL DONOR-RESTRICTED ENDOWMENT FUNDS MAY FALL BELOW THE LEVEL THAT THE DONOR IMPOSED RESTRICTIONS REQUIRE THE COLLEGE TO RETAIN AS A FUND OF PERPETUAL DURATION.

THE FOLLOWING FOOTNOTE IS INCLUDED IN THE SYSTEMS AUDITED CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS THAT ADDRESSES THE SYSTEM'S ENDOWMENT FUNDS: THOMAS JEFFERSON UNIVERSITY'S (""TJU'S"") ENDOWMENTS CONSIST OF 1,056 INDIVIDUAL FUNDS ESTABLISHED FOR A VARIETY OF PURPOSES. THE ENDOWMENT INCLUDES BOTH DONOR-RESTRICTED ENDOWMENT FUNDS AND FUNDS DESIGNATED BY THE BOARD OF TRUSTEES TO FUNCTION AS ENDOWMENTS. NET ASSETS ASSOCIATED WITH EACH OF THESE GROUPS OF FUNDS ARE CLASSIFIED AND REPORTED BASED UPON THE EXISTENCE OR ABSENCE OF DONOR-IMPOSED RESTRICTIONS. FROM TIME TO TIME, THE FAIR VALUE OF ASSETS ASSOCIATED WITH INDIVIDUAL DONOR-RESTRICTED ENDOWMENT FUNDS MAY FALL BELOW THE LEVEL THAT THE DONOR REQUIRES TJU TO RETAIN AS A FUND OF PERPETUAL DURATION. SHORTFALLS OF THIS NATURE, WHICH ARE REPORTED IN UNRESTRICTED NET ASSETS, WERE $1.3 MILLION AND $1.4 MILLION AS OF JUNE 30, 2019 AND 2018, RESPECTIVELY. THESE SHORTFALLS RESULTED FROM UNFAVORABLE MARKET FLUCTUATIONS THAT OCCURRED SHORTLY AFTER THE INVESTMENT OF NEW PERMANENTLY RESTRICTED CONTRIBUTIONS AND CONTINUED APPROPRIATION FOR CERTAIN PROGRAMS THAT WAS DEEMED PRUDENT BY TJU. THE COMMONWEALTH OF PENNSYLVANIA HAS NOT ADOPTED THE UNIFORM MANAGEMENT OF INSTITUTIONAL FUNDS ACT (UMIFA) OR THE UNIFORM PRUDENT MANAGEMENT OF INSTITUTIONAL FUNDS ACT (UPMIFA). RATHER, THE PENNSYLVANIA ACT GOVERNS THE INVESTMENT, USE AND MANAGEMENT OF TJUS ENDOWMENT FUNDS. THE PENNSYLVANIA ACT ALLOWS A NONPROFIT TO ELECT TO APPROPRIATE FOR EXPENDITURE AN INVESTMENT POLICY THAT SEEKS THE LONG-TERM PRESERVATION OF THE REAL VALUE OF THE INVESTMENTS. IN ACCORDANCE WITH THE PENNSYLVANIA ACT, THE OBJECTIVES OF TJUS INVESTMENT POLICY IS TO PROVIDE A LEVEL OF SPENDABLE INCOME WHICH IS SUFFICIENT TO MEET THE CURRENT AND FUTURE BUDGETARY REQUIREMENTS OF TJU AND WHICH IS CONSISTENT WITH THE GOAL OF PROTECTING THE PURCHASING POWER OF THE INVESTMENTS. THE CALCULATION OF THE SPENDABLE INCOME FOR ENDOWMENT FUNDS OF TJU IS BASED ON 75% OF THE PRIOR YEAR SPENDABLE INCOME AND 25% OF THE CALCULATED TWO YEAR AVERAGE OF THE ENDOWMENT MARKET VALUE MULTIPLIED BY 4.75%; THE SUM OF WHICH IS ADJUSTED BY AN INFLATION FACTOR."

The University is not classified as a private foundation. The University files a Form 990 (Return of Organization Exempt from Income Tax) annually. When these returns are filed, it is highly certain that some positions taken would be sustained upon examination by the taxing authorities, while others are subject to uncertainty about the merits of the tax position taken or the amount of the position that would ultimately be sustained. Examples of tax positions common to universities include such matters as the following: the tax exempt status of each entity and various positions relative to potential sources of unrelated business income tax (""UBIT""). UBIT is reported on Form 990-T, as appropriate. The benefit of a tax position is recognized in the financial statements in the period during which, based on all available evidence, management believes that it is more likely than not that the position will be sustained upon examination, including the resolution of appeals or litigation processes, if any. Tax positions are not offset or aggregated with other positions. Tax positions that meet the ""more likely than not"" recognition threshold are measured as the largest amount of tax benefit that is more than 50% likely to be realized on settlement with the applicable taxing authority. The portion of the benefits associated with tax positions taken that exceeds the amount measured as described above would be reflected as a liability for uncertain tax benefits in the accompanying statements of financial position along with any associated interest and penalties that would be payable to the taxing authorities upon examination. As of May 31, 2019 and 2018, there were no uncertain tax positions identified. The University does not expect the total amount of unrecognized tax benefits to significantly change in the next 12 months. Forms 990 and 990-T filed by the University are subject to examination by the Internal Revenue Service (IRS) up to three years from the extended due date of each return. Management believes the Forms 990 and 990-T have been filed appropriately. Forms 990 and 990-T filed by the University are no longer subject to examination for the fiscal years ended May 31, 2014 and prior. The University would recognize interest and penalties related to unrecognized tax positions in interest and income tax expense, respectively.

TODAY, STANFORD'S ENDOWMENT CONSISTS OF THOUSANDS OF INDIVIDUAL FUNDS, MANY OF WHICH ARE RESTRICTED TO PARTICULAR USES (E.G., SCHOLARSHIP FUNDS FOR UNDERGRADUATES, FELLOWSHIP FUNDS TO SUPPORT GRADUATE STUDENTS, RESEARCH FUNDS DIRECTED TO MANY DIFFERENT AREAS, PROGRAM SUPPORT FUNDS, FUNDS TO SUPPORT PROFESSORS, FUNDS TO SUPPORT LECTURES, FUNDS TO PROVIDE BUILDING AND GROUND MAINTENANCE, FUNDS TO SUPPORT THE UNIVERSITY'S MUSEUM, FUNDS TO SUPPORT THE ACQUISITION OF LIBRARY MATERIALS). THE FUNDS ARE INVESTED IN PERPETUITY FOR LONG TERM GROWTH AND THE PAYOUT IS USED FOR THE PURPOSE SET FORTH IN THE GIFT DOCUMENT. SOME ENDOWMENT FUNDS DO NOT HAVE PURPOSE RESTRICTIONS AND THE PAYOUT FROM THESE FUNDS IS USED TO SUPPORT THE GENERAL OPERATIONS AND INFRASTRUCTURE OF THE UNIVERSITY AS WELL AS MANY OTHER PARTS OF THE UNIVERSITY. ENDOWMENT PAYOUT IS A RELIABLE SOURCE OF CONTINUING SUPPORT AND IS CRITICAL TO THE FUNDING OF THE MANY LONG TERM COMMITMENTS THAT THE UNIVERSITY MUST MAKE. THE ENDOWMENT MAKES STANFORD LESS DEPENDENT ON OTHER MORE VARIABLE SOURCES OF INCOME. THE ENDOWMENT PAYOUT COVERS APPROXIMATELY 22% OF STANFORD'S TOTAL EXPENSES. STANFORD IS CURRENTLY DIRECTING CONSIDERABLE RESEARCH AND EDUCATION EFFORTS TOWARD ADDRESSING THE CHALLENGES CRITICAL TO THE WORLD. IN PARTICULAR, IT IS SEEKING SOLUTIONS TO SOME OF THE MOST CHALLENGING PROBLEMS IN HUMAN HEALTH, INTERNATIONAL PEACE AND SECURITY AND THE ENVIRONMENT AND SUSTAINABILITY. ONE OF THE UNIVERSITY'S HIGHEST PRIORITIES IS TO REMAIN AFFORDABLE AND ACCESSIBLE TO THE MOST TALENTED STUDENTS, REGARDLESS OF THEIR FINANCIAL CIRCUMSTANCES. THE UNIVERSITY'S ADMISSION PROCESS FOR UNDERGRADUATE STUDENTS FROM THE UNITED STATES IS NEED-BLIND, WHICH MEANS THAT STUDENTS ARE ADMITTED IRRESPECTIVE OF THEIR ABILITY TO PAY; THE UNIVERSITY PROVIDES THE FINANCIAL AID NECESSARY TO MAKE STANFORD AFFORDABLE TO EVERY ADMITTED STUDENT. FOR INTERNATIONAL STUDENTS, THE UNIVERSITY IS NEED-AWARE: STANFORD ANALYZES THE NEED FOR AID AND AIMS TO MEET THE DETERMINED NEED. SINCE 2000, THE UNIVERSITY HAS CONTINUED TO ENHANCE ITS FINANCIAL AID PROGRAMS FOR BOTH ITS UNDERGRADUATE AND GRADUATE STUDENTS. CURRENTLY, FAMILIES OF UNDERGRADUATE STUDENTS FROM THE U.S. WITH INCOMES BELOW $150,000 AND ASSETS TYPICAL OF THAT INCOME LEVEL RECEIVE AT LEAST ENOUGH SCHOLARSHIP TO COVER THE COST OF TUITION. THOSE WITH INCOMES BELOW $65,000 AND TYPICAL ASSETS RECEIVE ENOUGH SCHOLARSHIP ASSISTANCE TO COVER TUITION, ROOM AND BOARD, AND OTHER EXPENSES. IN FY19, APPROXIMATELY 48% OF UNDERGRADUATES WERE AWARDED NEED-BASED FINANCIAL AID FROM STANFORD. GRADUATE STUDENT FINANCIAL AID AND OTHER SUPPORT IS AWARDED BASED ON ACADEMIC MERIT AND THE AVAILABILITY OF AID. IN THE FACE OF DIMINISHING FEDERAL SUPPORT, STANFORD HAS ASSUMED MORE OF THE FINANCIAL WEIGHT OF SUPPORTING ITS GRADUATE STUDENTS. IN FY19, APPROXIMATELY 81% OF GRADUATE STUDENTS RECEIVED FINANCIAL SUPPORT. FOR THE YEAR ENDED AUGUST 31, 2019, ENDOWMENT PAYOUT SUPPORT INCLUDED THE FOLLOWING BROAD FUNCTIONS OF THE UNIVERSITY: INSTRUCTION AND RESEARCH $371,798,832 STUDENT FINANCIAL AID $298,183,610 LIBRARIES $22,197,142"

No provision has been made for income taxes in the accompanying financial statements, as the Institute has had no significant unrelated business income. The Institute follows guidance issued by the Financial Accounting Standards Board (FASB) with respect to accounting for uncertainty in income taxes. A tax position is recognized as a benefit only if it is more likely than not that the tax position would be sustained in a tax examination, with a tax examination being presumed to occur. The amount recognized is the largest amount of tax benefit that is greater than 50% likely of being realized on examination. For tax positions not meeting the more likely than not test, no tax benefit is recorded.

Its endowment includes both donor-restricted endowment funds and funds designated by the Board of Trustees to function as endowments. As required by U.S. generally accepted accounting principles (GAAP), net assets associated with endowment funds, including funds designated by the Board of Trustees to function as endowments, are classified and reported based on the existence or absence of donor-imposed restrictions. The College has adopted investment and spending policies for endowment assets that attempt to provide a predictable stream of funding to programs supported by its endowment while seeking to maintain the purchasing power of the endowment assets. Endowment assets include those assets of donor-restricted funds that the College must hold in perpetuity or for a donor-specified period(s) as well as board-designated funds. Under this policy, as approved by the Board of Trustees, the endowment assets are invested in a manner that is intended to produce results that exceed the price and yield results of appropriate market indices while assuming a moderate level of investment risk. The College's investment objectives are to provide a total return sufficient to support the College's operating budget while preserving the assets against inflation. To meet these objectives the Board seeks a total return of at least 5% greater than the rate of inflation as measured by the Consumer Price Index (U.S. CPI-U) over a long-term horizon. Total return is defined as dividends or interest income, plus or minus realized and unrealized capital appreciation or depreciation at fair market value, net of fees. The maximum amount of endowment income utilization is determined by a spending formula approved by the Board of Trustees. The amount available for spending is set at 5% of the previous three-year average market value for the years ended June 30, 2018 and 2017, respectively. The amounts available to be distributed, net of unspent endowment income, under the spending policy were $633,367 and $596,399 for the years ended June 30, 2018 and 2017, respectively. These amounts are included in change in net assets from operations. Investment income greater or less than the amounts available to be distributed under the spending policy is reported as nonoperating income."
