The procedure was last evaluated with the full board in March 2011. The procedure requires three elements as follows: 1) The terms of transactions are approved by the organization's governing body, or a committee thereof, whose members have no conflict of interest with respect to the arrangement. The Board of Trustees delegated authority to the CORD Committee to act on behalf of the Board in these matters at its meeting on March 25, 1999. Compensation arrangements are reviewed and approved by the CORD Committee before the effective date. Members of the CORD Committee recuse themselves from any vote in which there is a potential or actual conflict of interest. 2) The governing body or committee obtains and relies upon appropriate, comparable data before making its determination. Rice participates in the annual survey by Willis Towers Watson of select universities' executive compensation, and additional appropriate peer surveys. These reports reflect executive compensation in universities of a stature similar to that of Rice, and with which Rice competes for faculty and staff. The CORD Committee may also seek and rely on other relevant information, including compensation paid by other taxable and tax-exempt organizations for functionally comparable positions, geographic market forces, and actual written offers from similar institutions competing for services. The CORD Committee relies on this data and documents any determinations that reasonable compensation is an amount more than the range of comparable data. 3) The governing body or committee adequately documents the basis for making determinations concurrently with making decisions. Minutes documenting the deliberations of the CORD Committee are prepared contemporaneously for review and approval at its next meeting."

The university did not utilize chartered flights for air travel. Extensive travel is required of the position of president and they are encouraged by the Board of Trustees to travel business or first class on flights of two hours or more. This provision is made for several reasons 1) business or first-class travel allows for the most flexibility to accommodate a travel schedule that must frequently be altered, often at the last minute to accommodate donors' schedules, add critical meetings, or to take advantage of other strategic opportunities for the university, 2) circumstances sometimes call for the president to return to campus without notice, or to remain on campus when a trip was planned, and first or business-class travel best accommodates these changing conditions, and 3) the Board of Trustees wishes the president to be at their best performance representing and seeking funding for the university during often grueling travel itineraries for meetings frequently critical to the institution's well-being. This accommodation was not treated as taxable compensation. President was accompanied by his spouse to attend a conference for a bona fide business purpose. H0USING ALLOWANCE OR RESIDENCE FOR PERSONAL USE: The president is required to live on campus in the university-owned president's residence where they regularly hold university events. Because the president accepts this requirement as a condition of employment, the residence is on university premises, and it is provided for the convenience of the university, under IRS rules it is not considered a taxable benefit to the president.
