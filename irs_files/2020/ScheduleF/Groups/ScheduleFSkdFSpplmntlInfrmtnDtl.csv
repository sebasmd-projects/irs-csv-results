Financial aid from the University and other sources is viewed only as supplementary to the efforts of the student and the student's family. Students requesting financial aid are expected to contribute toward their educational expenses through summer or university employment and/or loans in any reasonable combination. Financial aid is an important factor for many students, and 100 percent of eligible Manchester University students receive some combination of grants, scholarships, loans, and work. Student Financial Services will determine a student's eligibility for financial aid by using the results of the Free Application for Federal Student Aid (FAFSA); the estimated family contribution (EFC) and review of edit (c-codes), as well as the student's academic records and funds available. Manchester University utilizes an awarding matrix based on a combination of academic and financial need criteria referenced above. Student Financial Services administers financial aid from federal, state, and institutional resources utilizing the federal guidelines established by the U.S. Department of Education. The following steps must be taken by a student to receive a financial aid package from Manchester University: 1. Apply for admission and be admitted to Manchester University. Eligibility for academic scholarships from the University is determined through the admission process. 2. Submit a FAFSA. Eligibility for federal, state and institutional need based grants and loans is determined through this process. The student must designate the results be sent to Manchester University, and Indiana students must have a receipt date between Oct.1 and April 15 to be considered for state grant eligibility. 3. Submit any additional documentation requested by Student Financial Services. Enrollment Requirements. Students receiving financial aid must maintain full-time enrollment, (a minimum of 12 semester hours) in each of the fall and spring semesters. There are circumstances in which part-time students demonstrating need may be awarded financial aid depending on the guidelines and availability of federal, state and institutional funding. Part-time students must enroll in a minimum of six hours to maintain eligibility for institutional funds and loans. Degree Requirements. Students must be working toward their first baccalaureate degree to be eligible for federal, state or institutional grants and scholarships.

THE REGION IN WHICH INVESTMENTS ARE REPORTED ON SCHEDULE F IS BASED ON THE INVESTMENT ENTITY'S LEGAL DOMICILE (I.E., COUNTRY WHOSE LAWS GOVERN THE ENTITY'S AFFAIRS) AND IS NOT INTENDED TO BE AN INDICATION OF WHERE THE INVESTMENT MANAGER DEPLOYS ASSETS. ACCORDINGLY, SUCH INFORMATION ON SCHEDULE F MAY NOT REFLECT THE REGIONS OF THE WORLD WHERE THE UNIVERSITY'S ASSETS ARE ACTUALLY INVESTED. STANFORD MANAGEMENT COMPANY (""SMC""), A DIVISION OF THE UNIVERSITY, ACTIVELY MANAGES THE UNIVERSITY'S MERGED POOL, WHICH COMPRISES THE SUBSTANTIAL MAJORITY OF STANFORD'S INVESTABLE ASSETS. THE PORTFOLIO IS CONSTRUCTED TO GENERATE ATTRACTIVE LONG-TERM RETURNS, ADJUSTED FOR RISK, SO THAT THE ENDOWMENT CAN PROVIDE MEANINGFUL ANNUAL SUPPORT TO THE OPERATING BUDGET OF THE UNIVERSITY WHILE PRESERVING PURCHASING POWER ACROSS GENERATIONS. STANFORD'S INVESTMENT PROGRAM IS CONSISTENT WITH ITS FIDUCIARY RESPONSIBILITIES UNDER THE CALIFORNIA UNIFORM PRUDENT INVESTOR ACT. TO EXECUTE ITS INVESTMENT STRATEGY, STANFORD INVESTS THROUGH ONSHORE AND OFFSHORE INVESTMENT VEHICLES. OFTEN, WHEN ACCESSING INTERNATIONAL OPPORTUNITIES, THERE IS NO ONSHORE OPTION. STANFORD REPORTS ITS HOLDINGS TO THE IRS AND OTHER TAX AUTHORITIES AND MAKES EVERY EFFORT TO BE FULLY COMPLIANT WITH ALL APPLICABLE DOMESTIC AND FOREIGN LAWS. OFFSHORE VEHICLES ARE STILL TAXED IN THE U.S., SPECIFICALLY ON INCOME THAT IS EFFECTIVELY CONNECTED TO THEIR OPERATIONS IN THE U.S., AS WELL AS ON DIVIDENDS RECEIVED FROM OPERATIONS DOMICILED IN THE U.S. IN SUMMARY, THE UNIVERSITY'S LONG-TERM INVESTMENT STRATEGY RELIES ON A PORTFOLIO DIVERSIFIED BY ASSET CLASS AND GEOGRAPHY, CONTINUALLY REFINED TO ACHIEVE DESIRED OVERALL RISK AND RETURN CHARACTERISTICS. COMBINED WITH A DISCIPLINED PAYOUT POLICY, STANFORD'S TRUSTEES AIM TO PROVIDE ROBUST ANNUAL SUPPORT FOR THE CURRENT OPERATING ACTIVITIES AND TO PRESERVE THE PURCHASING POWER OF THE ENDOWMENT FOR FUTURE GENERATIONS OF STUDENTS AND SCHOLARS. II) ALSO REPORTED AS INVESTMENTS ARE STANFORD'S INVESTMENTS IN RELATED OPERATING SUBSIDIARIES THROUGH WHICH THE UNIVERSITY CONDUCTS ONGOING PROGRAM ACTIVITIES IN CERTAIN FOREIGN COUNTRIES. 3.GRANTMAKING: STANFORD UNIVERSITY IS NOT A ""GRANT MAKER"" PER SE IN THAT ITS FUNDAMENTAL MISSION, AND PURPOSE FOR TAX-EXEMPTION, RELATES TO TEACHING, RESEARCH AND PATIENT CARE ACTIVITIES. HOWEVER, IN THE COURSE OF THESE MISSION-BASED ACTIVITIES, THE UNIVERSITY DOES MAKE PAYMENTS THAT MEET THE CRITERIA FOR 'GRANTMAKING' AS DEFINED BY THE INSTRUCTIONS TO IRS 990 SCHEDULE F. ACCORDINGLY, THESE GRANTS ARE REPORTED ON SCHEDULE F, PART I, AND ALSO REPORTED ON PARTS II AND III AS REQUIRED BY THE INSTRUCTIONS. FOR MOST UNITED STATES INSTITUTIONS OF HIGHER EDUCATION, PROVISION OF FINANCIAL AID TO STUDENTS IS AN IMPORTANT ACTIVITY ENABLING QUALIFIED STUDENTS TO OBTAIN A COLLEGE EDUCATION AT THE UNDERGRADUATE, GRADUATE OR POSTDOCTORAL LEVEL. STANFORD IS COMMITTED TO A ""NEED-BLIND"" ADMISSION POLICY FOR U.S. CITIZENS AND PERMANENT RESIDENTS; IT ADMITS QUALIFIED STUDENTS WITHOUT REGARD TO THEIR ABILITY TO PAY, AND PROVIDES A COMPREHENSIVE FINANCIAL AID PROGRAM FOR ALL ADMITTED US STUDENTS WHO HAVE UNIVERSITY-COMPUTED NEED, AND WHO MEET STATED FINANCIAL AID ELIGIBILITY REQUIREMENTS. FOR THE FISCAL YEAR ENDED AUGUST 31, 2019 (FY 2019), 48% OF UNDERGRADUATE AND ABOUT 81% OF GRADUATE STUDENTS RECEIVED SOME FORM OF FINANCIAL AID, WITH A TOTAL OF $501,527,223 OF FINANCIAL AID DISBURSED TO ALL STANFORD STUDENTS. APPROXIMATELY 64% OF THIS AID TOOK THE FORM OF TRANSFERS FROM INTERNAL UNIVERSITY FUNDS (OFTEN IN ACCORDANCE WITH DONOR TERMS) TO OFFSET TUITION AND OTHER UNIVERSITY CHARGES THAT WOULD OTHERWISE HAVE BEEN RECEIVED BY THE UNIVERSITY. THE BALANCE OF $179,470,712 REPRESENTS DISBURSEMENTS, PRIMARILY TO GRADUATE STUDENTS, FOR STIPENDS, FELLOWSHIPS AND OTHER STUDENT AID IN SUPPORT OF ACADEMIC EFFORT. GRANTS TO ORGANIZATIONS ARE PRIMARILY IN THE FORM OF RESEARCH SUBAWARDS. SUBAWARDS ARE PAYMENTS TO THIRD PARTY RECIPIENTS FOR PERFORMING A PORTION OF A STANFORD RESEARCH PROGRAM, MOST OFTEN A SPONSORED-RESEARCH PROJECT. MANY SUBAWARDS ARE AGREEMENTS FOR CONTRACTUALLY DEFINED DELIVERABLES, USUALLY REQUIRING HIGHLY SPECIFIC EXPERTISE. AS SUCH THEY COULD BE DESCRIBED AS RESEARCH CONTRACTS. HOWEVER, CERTAIN SUBAWARDS ARE CATEGORIZED AS GRANTS, DEPENDING ON THE NATURE OF THE ORIGINATING PRIME FUNDING SOURCE, SINCE THE TERMS AND CONDITIONS OF THE ORIGINATING FUNDING SOURCE GENERALLY FLOW THROUGH TO THE SUBAWARD. ACCORDINGLY, GRANT-FUNDED SUBAWARDS ARE REPORTED IN PART II. CONTRACT-FUNDED SUBAWARDS TO FOREIGN RECIPIENTS ARE REPORTED IN PART I, LINE 3 AS PROGRAM SERVICES - RESEARCH.
