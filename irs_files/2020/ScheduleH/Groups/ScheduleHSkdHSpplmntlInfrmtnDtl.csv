The Rockefeller University Hospital is a unique institution. As an institution solely committed to conducting clinical research our community/service area is defined as the New York Metropolitan Area. The Rockefeller University Hospital has provided an array of clinical research and patient care services since its founding in 1910. The Rockefeller University Hospital community served/service area is determined based on research being conducted. Principal Investigators identify an area of interest and submit a protocol for review and approval by our institutional review board. If and when the protocol is approved, our recruitment office works with the investigator to develop and submit advertisements in local newspapers, magazines and online. Identification of lucrative places to advertise is determined by current trends in readership among local newspapers, magazines and visits to particular websites such as Craigslist and Facebook. Research participants are culled from all over New York City as well as through collaborations with neighboring hospitals, Universities, and clinics. As a result, our enrolled research participant demographics are similar to those of New York City overall. In calendar year 2018 15% of research participants identified as Hispanic, 33% identified as Black or African-American and 41% identified as white (RUH subject race and ethnicity report 2018), which is similar to the geographic makeup of New York City (42.8% white, 24.3% Black or African-American, and 29.1% Hispanic) https://www.census.gov/quickfacts/fact/table/newyorkcitynewyork,US/PST045218."

Unlike most hospitals, the Rockefeller University Hospital does not routinely provide standard diagnostic and treatment services. Admission is selective; research participants (patients) are enrolled in studies by hospital Licensed Independent Practitioners (LIP's) solely because they meet the inclusion criteria of the illness or condition being studied, or because they are healthy volunteers and are also needed for study. Thus, all research participants are volunteers, and as such are important partners in the research process. Without volunteers, significant advances in biomedical knowledge could not otherwise be achieved."

WE PROVIDE EXCELLENT AND COMPASSIONATE CARE AND RESPONSIVE SERVICE. AS WE SEEK TO UNDERSTAND AND FULLY MEET OUR PATIENTS' CURRENT AND FUTURE NEEDS AND EXPECTATIONS, WE RECOGNIZE OUR RESPONSIBILITY TO PRUDENTLY USE THE SCARCE RESOURCES ENTRUSTED TO US. LAWS, REGULATIONS, CATASTROPHIC ILLNESSES AND THE RISING COSTS OF NEW TECHNOLOGY HAVE CREATED A CATEGORY OF PATIENTS WHO ARE EITHER UNINSURED OR UNDERINSURED. THIS CHARITY CARE PROGRAM HAS BEEN DEVELOPED TO HELP THE HOSPITAL MEET THE NEEDS OF THESE PATIENTS AND, CONCURRENTLY, MAINTAIN THE FINANCIAL VIABILITY OF THE HOSPITAL FOR FUTURE GENERATIONS. THIS CHARITY CARE POLICY EXPLAINS HOW THE HOSPITAL ASSISTS PATIENTS WHO CANNOT PAY FOR PART OR ALL OF THE ESSENTIAL MEDICAL CARE THEY RECEIVE. PRINCIPLES: STRONG MEMORIAL HOSPITAL PROACTIVELY CONVEYS INFORMATION ABOUT THIS CHARITY CARE POLICY TO PATIENTS AND THEIR FAMILIES. - WE BELIEVE THAT FEAR OF A HOSPITAL BILL SHOULD NEVER GET IN THE WAY OF ESSENTIAL HEALTH SERVICES. THE PROVISION OF URGENT OR EMERGENT HEALTHCARE IS NEVER DELAYED PENDING A FINANCIAL ASSISTANCE DETERMINATION. SIGNS ANNOUNCING THE CHARITY CARE PROGRAM ARE POSTED IN THE HOSPITAL (E.G. EMERGENCY DEPARTMENT, ADMITTING OFFICE) TO PROACTIVELY CONVEY THIS MESSAGE TO PROSPECTIVE PATIENTS AND THE PUBLIC IN GENERAL. - WE MAINTAIN FINANCIAL AID POLICIES THAT ARE CONSISTENT WITH THE MISSION, VALUES AND CAPACITY OF THE HOSPITAL AND THAT TAKE INTO ACCOUNT EACH INDIVIDUAL'S ABILITY TO CONTRIBUTE TO THE COST OF HIS OR HER CARE. - WE COMMUNICATE THE AVAILABILITY OF FINANCIAL AID IN A MANNER THAT IS CLEAR, UNDERSTANDABLE, SENSITIVE TO THE PATIENT'S DIGNITY, AND IN MULTIPLE LANGUAGES. A NOTICE IS AVAILABLE AT REGISTRATION SITES THAT INFORMS PATIENTS OF THIS PROGRAM AND PROVIDES THE PHONE NUMBER TO CALL TO OBTAIN MORE INFORMATION AND TO APPLY FOR THIS PROGRAM. DESIGNATED STAFF ARE PROVIDED DETAILED TRAINING SO THAT THEY CAN PROVIDE INFORMATION AND ANSWER QUESTIONS ABOUT THE CHARITY CARE PROGRAM. INFORMATION IS GENERALLY AVAILABLE IN BOTH ENGLISH AND SPANISH. WHEN REQUESTED, IT WILL ALSO BE MADE AVAILABLE IN OTHER LANGUAGES. - INFORMATION REGARDING OUR CHARITY CARE PROGRAM IS ALSO AVAILABLE ON THE URMC WEBSITE. - WE IMPLEMENT FINANCIAL AID PROCEDURES THAT ARE CONSUMER-FRIENDLY, RESPECTFUL, AND CONFIDENTIAL, AS WELL AS DEBT COLLECTION POLICIES THAT REFLECT THE MISSION AND VALUES OF THIS HOSPITAL. - WE WORK WITH GOVERNMENT, PAYERS, BUSINESS, CONSUMER GROUPS AND OTHERS TO ADDRESS THE UNDERLYING PROBLEM THAT TOO MANY NEW YORKERS LACK HEALTH INSURANCE. GENERAL GUIDELINES: AS PART OF FINANCIAL PLANNING ASSISTANCE, WE PROVIDE PATIENTS, AND/OR THEIR LEGAL REPRESENTATIVE, WITH INFORMATION ABOUT THE CRITERIA THAT MUST BE MET IN ORDER TO OBTAIN MEDICAID, MEDICARE, OR OTHER HEALTH INSURANCES. PATIENTS ARE ASSISTED IN MAKING APPLICATIONS FOR ANY OF THESE INSURANCES OR DISCOUNTED FEE PLANS. PATIENTS ARE EXPECTED TO PARTICIPATE FULLY IN ALL EFFORTS TO OBTAIN ANY INSURANCE FOR WHICH THEY MAY QUALIFY. UNDER CERTAIN CIRCUMSTANCES, AS DETERMINED BY THE FINANCIAL CASE MANAGERS OR OTHER HOSPITAL SENIOR ADMINISTRATORS. APPLICATIONS FOR MEDICAID, MEDICARE OR OTHER INSURANCE PROGRAMS MAY BE WAIVED WHEN DEEMED UNNECESSARY. IF AVAILABLE INSURANCE BENEFITS ARE NOT SUFFICIENT TO COVER THE COST OF THEIR CARE, PATIENTS MAY THEN APPLY FOR ASSISTANCE FROM THE CHARITY CARE PROGRAM. CHARITY CARE APPLICATIONS MUST BE COMPLETED AND RETURNED TO THE HOSPITAL WITH THE REQUESTED INCOME DOCUMENTATION. PATIENTS WILL NOT RECEIVE CHARITY CARE ASSISTANCE IF THEY (A) DO NOT COMPLETE THE APPLICATION PROCESS FOR MEDICAID OR OTHER INSURANCE FOR WHICH THEY MAY QUALIFY, (B) ELECT NOT TO MAKE APPLICATION FOR CHARITY CARE, OR (C) HAVE ADEQUATE RESOURCES OR INCOME TO PAY PRIVATELY FOR THEIR CARE. IN THESE SITUATIONS, THEY WILL REMAIN FINANCIALLY RESPONSIBLE FOR FULL PAYMENT OF THEIR HOSPITAL BILLS. CHARITY CARE ASSISTANCE IS AVAILABLE FOR PATIENTS WHO RESIDE IN NEW YORK STATE AND RECEIVE EMERGENCY HOSPITAL SERVICES, INCLUDING EMERGENCY TRANSFERS, AND TO PATIENTS WHO RESIDE IN STRONG MEMORIAL HOSPITAL'S PRIMARY SERVICE AREA IN NEW YORK STATE WHO RECEIVE SERVICES IN DESIGNATED STRONG MEMORIAL HOSPITAL PROGRAMS, INCLUDING MOST INPATIENT AND OUTPATIENT SERVICES. IN ADDITION, THE HOSPITAL MAY, IN ITS DISCRETION, GRANT CHARITY CARE TO INDIVIDUALS WHO RESIDE OUTSIDE OF NEW YORK STATE. CHARITY CARE ASSISTANCE DOES NOT COVER MEDICALLY UNNECESSARY CARE, COSMETIC ALTERATION, TELEPHONE, TELEVISION AND PRIVATE ROOM CHARGES.

SPECIFIC QUESTIONS ABOUT SERVICES THAT ARE NOT COVERED SHOULD BE DIRECTED TO THE PATIENT ACCOUNTS MANAGER OR THEIR DELEGATE. FINANCIAL GUIDELINES: FINANCIAL AID IS INTENDED TO ASSIST THOSE INDIVIDUALS WHO CANNOT AFFORD TO PAY IN PART OR IN FULL FOR THEIR CARE. IT SHOULD TAKE INTO ACCOUNT EACH INDIVIDUAL'S ABILITY TO CONTRIBUTE TO THE COST OF HIS OR HER CARE. HOSPITAL FINANCIAL AID SHOULD NOT BE VIEWED AS A SUBSTITUTE FOR EMPLOYER-SPONSORED OR INDIVIDUALLY PURCHASED INSURANCE. PATIENTS WITHOUT INSURANCE AND WITH INCOME THAT WOULD QUALIFY THEM FOR THE CHARITY CARE PROGRAM BUT ALSO HAVE SUBSTANTIAL RESOURCES (OTHER THAN TAX-DEFERRED OR COMPARABLE RETIREMENT SAVINGS OR COLLEGE SAVINGS ACCOUNTS) MAY BE EXPECTED TO PAY PART OF THEIR BILLS(S). CHARITY CARE ASSISTANCE IS GENERALLY AVAILABLE TO INDIVIDUALS WHOSE INCOME IS LESS THAN OR EQUAL TO 400% OF THE FEDERAL POVERTY LEVEL.

THIS MAY INCLUDE PATIENTS WHO HAVE BEEN SANCTIONED BY MEDICAID, HAVE FILED BANKRUPTCY OR APPEAR TO BE ELIGIBLE FOR CHARITY CARE ASSISTANCE BASED ON AVAILABLE INFORMATION. ELIGIBILITY DETERMINATIONS IN COMPLEX CASE CIRCUMSTANCES WILL BE MADE AFTER CONSIDERATION BY THE CHARITY CARE REVIEW TEAM THAT INCLUDES THE CHARITY CARE OFFICER, FINANCIAL CASE MANAGER AND/OR THEIR MANAGERS, OR MAY BE MADE BY SENIOR HOSPITAL ADMINISTRATORS. THE AMOUNT OF THE DISCOUNT AFFORDED TO QUALIFIED CHARITY CARE PATIENTS WILL BE DETERMINED THROUGH ASSESSMENT OF THE RESPONSIBLE PARTY'S ANNUAL HOUSEHOLD INCOME AND THE NUMBER OF PEOPLE IN THE HOME, AS A PERCENTAGE OF THE FEDERAL POVERTY GUIDELINE AMOUNTS FOR SAME SIZE HOUSEHOLDS. THE FINANCIAL GUIDELINES WILL BE UPDATED ANNUALLY IN CONJUNCTION WITH THE FEDERAL POVERTY UPDATES PUBLISHED BY CMS. PATIENTS MAY RECEIVE FULL OR PARTIAL DISCOUNT FROM THE COST OF CARE, DEPENDING ON THE PERCENTAGE OF THE GUIDELINES MATCHED BY THE PATIENT'S HOUSEHOLD INCOME. ANY BILL AMOUNT REMAINING AFTER APPLICATION OF A PARTIAL CHARITY CARE DISCOUNT IS THE RESPONSIBILITY OF THE PATIENT. THE AMOUNT AN APPROVED CHARITY CARE PATIENT WILL GENERALLY BE EXPECTED TO PAY FOR SERVICES COVERED BY THE POLICY WILL BE LIMITED TO THE LOWER OF THE AMOUNT THAT THE HOSPITAL WOULD HAVE RECEIVED FOR THE SAME SERVICE UNDER MEDICARE PARTS A AND B, (INCLUDING COINSURANCE, CO-PAYMENTS AND DEDUCTIBLES) OR THE USUAL AND CUSTOMARY CHARGES. THE PATIENT WILL BE ASSISTED BY THE HOSPITAL IN MAKING ARRANGEMENTS TO SATISFY ANY BALANCE REMAINING ON THE ACCOUNT(S) AFTER THE APPLICATION OF THE APPROPRIATE CHARITY CARE DISCOUNT BY USE OF A PAYMENT PLAN. THE MONTHLY PAYMENTS UNDER SUCH PLANS SHALL NOT EXCEED TEN PERCENT (10%) OF THE ELIGIBLE PATIENT'S GROSS MONTHLY INCOME.

201923189349314362,263162145,"Schedule H, Part I, Line 3c - Other Factors Used in Determining Elig.","IU Health Arnett uses several factors other than Federal Poverty Guidelines (""FPGs"") in determining eligibility for free care under its FAP. These factors include the following: 1. Indiana Residency Requirement Financial Assistance will only be made available to residents of the State of Indiana and those eligible for assistance under 42 U.S.C.A. 1396b(v). IU Health Arnett will employ the same residency test as set forth in Indiana Code 6-3-1-12 to define an Indiana resident. The term Resident includes any individual who was domiciled in Indiana during the taxable year, or any individual who maintains a permanent place of residence in Indiana and spends more than one hundred eight-three (183) days of the taxable year in Indiana. Patients residing in the state of Indiana while attending an institution of higher education may be eligible for assistance under the FAP if they meet the aforementioned residency test and are not claimed as a dependent on a parents or guardians federal income tax return. 2. IU Healths Individual Solutions Department Prior to seeking Financial Assistance under the FAP, all patients or their guarantors must consult with a member of IU Healths Individual Solutions department to determine if healthcare coverage may be obtained from a government insurance/assistance product or from the Health Insurance Exchange Marketplace. 3. Uninsured Patients All Uninsured Patients presenting for services at IU health Arnett eligible under the FAP will not be charged more than the AGB as described in the FAP. 4. Services Rendered by Individual Providers The FAP does not cover services rendered by individual providers. A full listing of providers and services not covered by the FAP is available at https://iuhealth.org/pay-a-bill/financial-assistance and is updated on a quarterly basis. 5. Alternate Sources of Assistance When technically feasible, a patient will exhaust all other state and federal assistance programs prior to receiving an award from IU Health Arnetts Financial Assistance Program. Patients who may be eligible for coverage under an applicable insurance policy, including, but not limited to, health, automobile, and homeowners, must exhaust all insurance benefits prior to receiving an award from IU Health Arnetts Financial Assistance Program. This includes patients covered under their own policy and those who may be entitled to benefits from a third-party policy. Patients may be asked to show proof that such a claim was properly submitted to the proper insurance provider at the request of IU Health Arnett. Eligible patients who receive medical care from IU Health Arnett as a result of an injury proximately caused by a third party, and later receive a monetary settlement or award from said third party, may receive Financial Assistance for any outstanding balance not covered by the settlement or award to which IU Health Arnett is entitled. In the event a Financial Assistance Award has already been granted in such circumstances, IU Health Arnett reserves the right to reverse the award in an amount equal to the amount IU Health Arnett would be entitled to receive had no Financial Assistance been awarded. 6. Alternate Methods of Eligibility Determination IU Health Arnett will conduct a quarterly review of all accounts placed with a collection agency partner for a period of no less than one hundred and twenty (120) days after the account is eligible for an ECA. Said accounts may be eligible for assistance under the FAP based on the patients individual scoring criteria. To ensure all patients potentially eligible for Financial Assistance under the FAP may receive Financial Assistance, IU Health Arnett will deem patients/guarantors to be presumptively eligible for Financial Assistance if they are found to be eligible for one of the following programs, received emergency or direct admit care, and satisfied his/her required co-pay/deductible: - Indiana Childrens Special Health Care Services - Medicaid - Healthy Indiana Plan - Patients who are awarded Hospital Presumptive Eligibility (HPE) - Enrolled in a state and/or federal program that verifies the patient's gross household income is less than or equal to 200% of the Federal Poverty Level 7. Additional Considerations Financial Assistance may be granted to a deceased patients account if said patient is found to have no estate. Additionally, IU Health Arnett will deny or revoke Financial Assistance for any patient or guarantor who falsifies any portion of a Financial Assistance application. 8. Patient Assets IU Health Arnett may consider patient/guarantor Assets in the calculation of a patient's true financial burden. A patient's/guarantor's primary residence and one (1) motor vehicle will be exempted from consideration in most cases. A patient's primary residence is defined as the patient's principal place of residence and will be excluded from a patient's extraordinary asset calculation so long as the patient's equity is less than five-hundred thousand dollars ($500,000) and the home is occupied by the patient/guarantor, patient's/guarantor's spouse or child under twenty-one (21) years of age. One (1) motor vehicle may be excluded as long as the patient's equity in the vehicle is less than fifty-thousand dollars ($50,000). IU Health Arnett reserves the right to request a list of all property owned by the patient/guarantor and adjust a patient's award of Financial Assistance if the patient demonstrates a claim or clear title to any extraordinary Asset not excluded from consideration under the above guidance. 9. Non-Emergent Services Down Payment Uninsured Patients presenting for scheduled or other non-emergent services will not be charged more than the AGB for their services. Patients will receive an estimated AGB cost of their care prior to IU Health Arnett rendering the services and will be asked to pay a down-payment percentage of the AGB adjusted cost prior to receiving services. In the event a patient is unable to fulfill the down-payment, their service may be rescheduled for a later date as medically prudent and in accordance with all applicable federal and state laws and/or regulations. 10. Emergency Services Non-Refundable Deposit This section will be implemented with a strict adherence to EMTALA and IU Health Policy ADM 1.32, Screening and Transfer of Emergency or Unstable Patients. Amount of Non-Refundable Deposit All Uninsured Patients presenting for services at IU Health Arnetts Emergency Department, via transfer from another hospital facility, or direct admission, will be responsible for a one-hundred dollar ($100.00) non-refundable deposit for services rendered. Patients/guarantors will be responsible for any copays and/or deductibles required by their plan prior to full Financial Assistance being applied. Uninsured Patients wishing to make an application for Financial Assistance greater than the AGB must fulfill their non-refundable deposit prior to IU Health Arnett processing said application. Uninsured Patients making payments toward their outstanding non-refundable deposit balance will have said payments applied to their oldest application on file, if applicable."

TO CAPTURE ALL PATIENTS WHO ARE POTENTIALLY ELIGIBLE FOR FINANCIAL ASSISTANCE UNDER THE IU HEALTH FINANCIAL ASSISTANCE POLICY, IU HEALTH WILL DEEM PATIENTS/GUARANTORS TO BE PRESUMPTIVELY ELIGIBLE FOR FINANCIAL ASSISTANCE IF THEY ARE FOUND TO BE ELIGIBLE FOR ONE OF THE FOLLOWING PROGRAMS, RECEIVED EMERGENCY OR DIRECT ADMIT CARE, AND SATISFIED THE REQUIRED CO-PAY/DEDUCTIBLE: 1.

201923189349314362,263162145,"Schedule H, Part III, Line 4 - Bad Debt Expense","IU HEALTH'S CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS, FOOTNOTE 4, ADDRESSES BAD DEBT EXPENSE AS FOLLOWS: THE INDIANA UNIVERSITY HEALTH SYSTEM DOES NOT REQUIRE COLLATERAL OR OTHER SECURITY FROM ITS PATIENTS, SUBSTANTIALLY ALL OF WHOM ARE RESIDENTS OF THE STATE, FOR THE DELIVERY OF HEALTH CARE SERVICES. HOWEVER, CONSISTENT WITH INDUSTRY PRACTICE, THE INDIANA UNIVERSITY HEALTH SYSTEM ROUTINELY OBTAINS ASSIGNMENT OF (OR IS OTHERWISE ENTITLED TO RECEIVE) PATIENTS' BENEFITS PAYABLE UNDER THEIR HEALTH INSURANCE PROGRAMS, PLANS OR POLICIES (E.G., MEDICARE, MEDICAID, MANAGED CARE PAYERS, AND COMMERCIAL INSURANCE POLICIES). THE INDIANA UNIVERSITY HEALTH SYSTEM USES A PORTFOLIO APPROACH TO ACCOUNT FOR CATEGORIES OF PATIENT CONTRACTS AS A COLLECTIVE GROUP, RATHER THAN RECOGNIZING REVENUE ON AN INDIVIDUAL CONTRACT BASIS. THE PORTFOLIOS CONSIST OF MAJOR PAYER CLASSES FOR INPATIENT REVENUE AND OUTPATIENT REVENUE. BASED ON THE HISTORICAL COLLECTION TRENDS AND OTHER ANALYSIS, THE INDIANA UNIVERSITY HEALTH SYSTEM BELIEVES THAT REVENUE RECOGNIZED BY UTILIZING THE PORTFOLIO APPROACH APPROXIMATES THE REVENUE THAT WOULD HAVE BEEN RECOGNIZED IF AN INDIVIDUAL CONTRACT APPROACH WERE USED. IN SUPPORT OF ITS MISSION, THE INDIANA UNIVERSITY HEALTH SYSTEM PROVIDES CARE TO UNINSURED AND UNDERINSURED PATIENTS. THE INDIANA UNIVERSITY HEALTH SYSTEM PROVIDES CHARITY CARE TO PATIENTS WHO LACK FINANCIAL RESOURCES AND ARE DEEMED TO BE MEDICALLY INDIGENT. UNDER ITS FINANCIAL ASSISTANCE POLICY, THE INDIANA UNIVERSITY HEALTH SYSTEM PROVIDES MEDICALLY NECESSARY CARE TO UNINSURED PATIENTS WITH INADEQUATE FINANCIAL RESOURCES AT CHARITABLE DISCOUNTS EQUIVALENT TO THE AMOUNTS GENERALLY BILLED, AND IT PROVIDES ELIGIBILITY FOR FULL CHARITY FOR EMERGENT ENCOUNTERS FOR UNINSURED PATIENTS WHO EARN LESS THAN 200% OF THE FEDERAL POVERTY LEVEL AND WHO MEET APPLICATION CRITERIA. PATIENTS WHOSE LIABILITY IS DEEMED CATASTROPHIC RELATIVE TO THEIR ANNUAL HOUSEHOLD INCOME ARE ALSO ELIGIBLE FOR REDUCED CHARGES. SINCE THE INDIANA UNIVERSITY HEALTH SYSTEM DOES NOT PURSUE COLLECTION OF THESE AMOUNTS, THE DISCOUNTED AMOUNTS ARE NOT REPORTED AS PATIENT SERVICE REVENUE. THE INDIANA UNIVERSITY HEALTH SYSTEM USES PRESUMPTIVE ELIGIBILITY SCREENING PROCEDURES FOR FREE CARE AND RECOGNIZES NET PATIENT SERVICE REVENUE ON SERVICES PROVIDED TO SELF-PAY PATIENTS AT THE DISCOUNTED RATE AT THE TIME SERVICES ARE RENDERED. THE ESTIMATED COST OF CHARITY CARE, USING THE CONSOLIDATED COST TO CHARGE RATIO, WAS $94,886,000 AND $85,295,000 IN 2018 AND 2017, RESPECTIVELY."
201923189349314362,263162145,"Schedule H, Part III, Line 8 - Medicare Shortfall","The amount reported on Schedule H, Part III, Line 6 is calculated, in accordance with the Form 990 instructions, using ""allowable costs"" from the IU Health Arnett Medicare Cost Report. ""Allowable costs"" for Medicare Cost Report purposes, however, are not reflective of all costs associated with IU Health Arnett's participation in Medicare programs. For example, the Medicare Cost Report excludes certain costs such as billed physician services, the costs of Medicare Parts C and D, fee schedule reimbursed services, and durable medical equipment services. Inclusion of all costs associated with IU Health Arnett's participation in Medicare programs would significantly increase the Medicare shortfall reported on Schedule H, Part III, Line 7. IU Health West Arnett's Medicare shortfall is attributable to reimbursements that are less than the cost of providing patient care and services to Medicare beneficiaries and does not include any amounts that result from inefficiencies or poor management. IU Arnett accepts all Medicare patients knowing that there may be shortfalls; therefore it has taken the position that any shortfall should be counted as part of its community benefit. Additionally, it is implied in Internal Revenue Service Revenue Ruling 69-545 that treating Medicare patients is a community benefit. Revenue Ruling 69-545, which established the community benefit standard for nonprofit hospitals, states that if a hospital serves patients with governmental health benefits, including Medicare, then this is an indication that the hospital operates to promote the health of the community."

Financial Assistance Application Patients or their guarantors wishing to apply for Financial Assistance are encouraged to submit a Financial Assistance Application within ninety (90) days of their discharge. Patients or their guarantors may submit an application up to two-hundred and forty (240) days from the date of their first billing statement from IU Health, however, accounts may be subject to ECA as soon as one hundred and twenty (120) days after having received their first billing statement. Patients or their guarantors submitting an incomplete application will receive written notification of the applications deficiency upon discovery by IU health. The application will be pended for a period of forty-five (45) days from the date the notification is mailed. IU Health will suspend any ECA until the application is complete, or the patient fails to cure any deficiencies in their application in the allotted period. Patients with limited English proficiency may request to have a copy of the FAP, a FAP Application, and FAP Plain Language Summary in one of the below languages: - Arabic - Burmese - Burmese-Falam - Burmese-Hakha Chin - Mandarin/Chinese - Spanish The patient, and/or their representative, such as the patients physician, family members, legal counsel, community or religious groups, social services or hospital personnel may request a FAP Application to be mailed to a patients primary mailing address free of charge.

Eligibility Determination IU Health Arnett will inform patients or guarantors of the results of their application by providing the patient or guarantor with a Financial Assistance Determination within ninety (90) days of receiving a completed Application and all requested documentation. If a patient or guarantor is granted less than full charity assistance and the patient or guarantor provides additional information for reconsideration, IU Health Revenue Cycle Services may amend a prior Financial Assistance Determination. If a patient or guarantor seeks to appeal the Financial Assistance Determination further, a written request must be submitted, along with the supporting documentation, to the Financial Assistance Committee for additional review/reconsideration. All decisions of the Financial Assistance Committee are final. A patients Financial Assistance Application and eligibility determination are specific to each individual date(s) of service and related encounters. 3. Extraordinary Collection Actions IU Health Arnett may refer delinquent patient accounts to a third-party collection agency after utilizing reasonable efforts to determine a patients eligibility for assistance under the FAP. IU Health and its third-party collection agencies may initiate ECA against a patient or their guarantor in accordance with this Policy and 26 C.F.R. 1.501(r). Said ECA may include the following: - Selling a patients or their guarantors outstanding financial responsibility to a third party. - Reporting adverse information about the patient or their guarantor to consumer credit reporting agencies or credit bureaus. - Deferring or denying, or requiring a payment before providing, medically necessary care because of a patients or their guarantors nonpayment of one or more bills for previously provided care covered under the FAP. - Actions requiring a legal or judicial process, including but not limited to placing a lien on patients or their guarantors property, foreclosing on a patients or their guarantors real property attaching or seizing a patients or their guarantors bank account or other personal property, commencing a civil action against a patient or their guarantor, causing a patient or guarantors arrest, causing a patient and/or guarantor to be subject to a writ of body attachment, and garnishing a patient or guarantors wages. When it is necessary to engage in such action, IU Health Arnett and its third party collection agencies, will engage in fair, respectful and transparent collections activities. Patients or guarantors currently subject to an ECA who have not previously applied for Financial Assistance may apply for assistance up to two-hundred and forty (240) days of the date of their first billing statement from IU Health. IU Health and their third-party collection agencies will suspend any ECA engaged on a patient or their guarantor while an Application is being processed and considered. 4. Refunds Patients eligible for assistance under the FAP who remitted payment to IU Health Arnett in excess of their patient responsibility will be alerted to the overpayment as promptly after discovery as is reasonable given the nature of the overpayment. Patients with an outstanding account balance on a separate account not eligible for assistance under the FAP will have their refund applied to the outstanding balance. Patients without an outstanding account balance described above will be issued a refund check for their overpayment as soon as technically feasible."
