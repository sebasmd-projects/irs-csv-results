COMMUNITY BENEFITS PROVIDED TO THE BROADER COMMUNITY INCLUDE THE COSTS OF PROVIDING SERVICES TO OTHER POPULATIONS WHO MAY NOT QUALIFY AS INDIGENT BUT MAY NEED SPECIAL SERVICES AND SUPPORT. THIS TYPE OF COMMUNITY BENEFIT INCLUDES THE COSTS OF: SERVICES SUCH AS HEALTH PROMOTION AND EDUCATION, HEALTH SCREENINGS, ALL OF WHICH ARE NOT BILLED OR CAN BE OPERATED ONLY ON A DEFICIT BASIS; UNPAID PORTIONS OF TRAINING HEALTH PROFESSIONALS SUCH AS MEDICAL RESIDENTS, STUDENTS IN ALLIED HEALTH PROFESSIONS; AND THE UNPAID PORTIONS OF TESTING MEDICAL EQUIPMENT AND CONTROLLED STUDIES OF THERAPEUTIC PROTOCOLS. THE COSTS OF CHARITY CARE AND OTHER COMMUNITY BENEFIT ACTIVITIES ARE DERIVED FROM BOTH ESTIMATED AND ACTUAL DATA. THE ESTIMATED COST OF CHARITY CARE INCLUDES THE DIRECT AND INDIRECT COST OF PROVIDING SUCH SERVICES AND IS ESTIMATED UTILIZING THE HOSPITAL'S RATIO OF COST TO GROSS CHARGES, WHICH IS THEN MULTIPLIED BY THE GROSS UNCOMPENSATED CHARGES ASSOCIATED WITH PROVIDING CARE TO CHARITY PATIENTS. THE HOSPITAL RECEIVES PAYMENTS FROM THE NEW JERSEY HEALTH CARE SUBSIDY FUNDS FOR CHARITY CARE AND SUCH AMOUNTS TOTALED APPROXIMATELY $900,000 AND $655,000 FOR THE YEARS ENDED DECEMBER 31, 2018 AND 2017, RESPECTIVELY. THIS AMOUNT IS SUBJECT TO CHANGE FROM YEAR TO YEAR BASED ON AVAILABLE STATE AMOUNTS AND ALLOCATION METHODOLOGIES. CHARITY CARE SUBSIDIES AND DISTRIBUTIONS SUBSEQUENT TO JUNE 30, 2019 ARE PRESENTLY UNKNOWN. OTHER THIRD-PARTY PAYORS ------------------------ THE HOSPITAL ALSO HAS ENTERED INTO PAYMENT AGREEMENTS WITH CERTAIN COMMERCIAL INSURANCE CARRIERS AND HEALTH MAINTENANCE ORGANIZATIONS. THE BASIS FOR PAYMENT TO THE HOSPITAL UNDER THESE AGREEMENTS INCLUDES PROSPECTIVELY DETERMINED RATES PER DISCHARGE OR DAYS OF HOSPITALIZATION AND DISCOUNTS FROM ESTABLISHED CHARGES. SOME OF THESE AGREEMENTS HAVE RETROSPECTIVE AUDIT CLAUSES, ALLOWING THE PAYOR TO REVIEW AND ADJUST CLAIMS SUBSEQUENT TO INITIAL PAYMENT. THE HOSPITAL RECOGNIZES PATIENT SERVICE REVENUE ASSOCIATED WITH SERVICES PROVIDED TO PATIENTS WHO HAVE THIRD-PARTY PAYOR COVERAGE ON THE BASIS OF THESE ESTABLISHED RATES FOR THE SERVICES RENDERED. FOR UNINSURED PATIENTS THAT DO NOT QUALIFY FOR CHARITY CARE, THE HOSPITAL RECOGNIZES REVENUES ON THE BASIS OF ITS STANDARD RATES, DISCOUNTED IN ACCORDANCE WITH THE HOSPITAL'S POLICY. ON THE BASIS OF HISTORICAL EXPERIENCE, A SIGNIFICANT PORTION OF THE HOSPITAL'S UNINSURED PATIENTS WILL BE UNABLE OR UNWILLING TO PAY FOR THE SERVICES PROVIDED. THUS, THE HOSPITAL RECORDS A SIGNIFICANT PROVISION OF BAD DEBTS RELATED TO UNINSURED PATIENTS IN THE PERIOD THE SERVICES ARE PROVIDED. FOR THE YEARS ENDED DECEMBER 31, 2018 AND 2017, NET PATIENT SERVICE REVENUE WAS INCREASED BY APPROXIMATELY $9,820,000 AND $5,091,000, RESPECTIVELY, FOR FAVORABLE ADJUSTMENTS AND SETTLEMENTS RELATED TO PRIOR YEARS."
201933199349301858,221487173,"SCHEDULE H, PART III, SECTION B; QUESTION 8","MEDICARE COSTS WERE DERIVED FROM THE 2018 MEDICARE COST REPORT. THE ORGANIZATION FEELS THAT MEDICARE UNDERPAYMENTS (SHORTFALL), BAD DEBT AND ASSOCIATED COSTS ARE COMMUNITY BENEFIT AND ARE INCLUDABLE ON THE FORM 990, SCHEDULE H, PART I. AS OUTLINED MORE FULLY BELOW, THE ORGANIZATION BELIEVES THAT THESE SERVICES AND RELATED COSTS PROMOTE THE HEALTH OF THE COMMUNITY AS A WHOLE AND ARE RENDERED IN CONJUNCTION WITH THE ORGANIZATION'S CHARITABLE TAX-EXEMPT PURPOSES AND MISSION IN PROVIDING MEDICALLY NECESSARY HEALTHCARE SERVICES TO ALL INDIVIDUALS IN A NON-DISCRIMINATORY MANNER WITHOUT REGARD TO RACE, COLOR, CREED, SEX, NATIONAL ORIGIN OR ABILITY TO PAY AND CONSISTENT WITH THE COMMUNITY BENEFIT STANDARD PROMULGATED BY THE IRS. THE COMMUNITY BENEFIT STANDARD IS THE CURRENT STANDARD FOR A HOSPITAL FOR RECOGNITION AS A TAX-EXEMPT AND CHARITABLE ORGANIZATION UNDER INTERNAL REVENUE CODE (""IRC"") 501(C)(3). THE ORGANIZATION IS RECOGNIZED AS A TAX-EXEMPT ENTITY AND CHARITABLE ORGANIZATION UNDER 501(C)(3) OF THE IRC. ALTHOUGH THERE IS NO DEFINITION IN THE TAX CODE FOR THE TERM ""CHARITABLE"" A REGULATION PROMULGATED BY THE DEPARTMENT OF THE TREASURY PROVIDES SOME GUIDANCE AND STATES THAT ""THE TERM CHARITABLE IS USED IN SECTION 501(C)(3) IN ITS GENERALLY ACCEPTED LEGAL SENSE,PROVIDES EXAMPLES OF CHARITABLE PURPOSES, INCLUDING THE RELIEF OF THE POOR OR UNPRIVILEGED; THE PROMOTION OF SOCIAL WELFARE; AND THE ADVANCEMENT OF EDUCATION, RELIGION, AND SCIENCE. NOTE IT DOES NOT EXPLICITLY ADDRESS THE ACTIVITIES OF HOSPITALS. IN THE ABSENCE OF EXPLICIT STATUTORY OR REGULATORY REQUIREMENTS APPLYING THE TERM ""CHARITABLE"" TO HOSPITALS, IT HAS BEEN LEFT TO THE IRS TO DETERMINE THE CRITERIA HOSPITALS MUST MEET TO QUALIFY AS IRC 501(C)(3) CHARITABLE ORGANIZATIONS. THE ORIGINAL STANDARD WAS KNOWN AS THE CHARITY CARE STANDARD. THIS STANDARD WAS REPLACED BY THE IRS WITH THE COMMUNITY BENEFIT STANDARD WHICH IS THE CURRENT STANDARD. CHARITY CARE STANDARD IN 1956, THE IRS ISSUED REVENUE RULING 56-185, WHICH ADDRESSED THE REQUIREMENTS HOSPITALS NEEDED TO MEET IN ORDER TO QUALIFY FOR IRC 501(C)(3) STATUS. ONE OF THESE REQUIREMENTS IS KNOWN AS THE ""CHARITY CARE STANDARD."" UNDER THE STANDARD, A HOSPITAL MUST PROVIDE, TO THE EXTENT OF ITS FINANCIAL ABILITY, FREE OR REDUCED-COST CARE TO PATIENTS WHO CANNOT PAY FOR SUCH SERVICES. A HOSPITAL THAT EXPECTED FULL PAYMENT DID NOT, ACCORDING TO THE RULING, PROVIDE CHARITY CARE BASED ON THE FACT THAT SOME PATIENTS ULTIMATELY FAILED TO PAY. THE RULING EMPHASIZED THAT A LOW LEVEL OF CHARITY CARE DID NOT NECESSARILY MEAN THAT A HOSPITAL HAD FAILED TO MEET THE REQUIREMENT SINCE THAT LEVEL COULD REFLECT ITS FINANCIAL ABILITY TO PROVIDE SUCH CARE. THE RULING ALSO NOTED THAT PUBLICLY SUPPORTED COMMUNITY HOSPITALS WOULD NORMALLY QUALIFY AS CHARITABLE ORGANIZATIONS BECAUSE THEY SERVE THE ENTIRE COMMUNITY AND A LOW LEVEL OF CHARITY CARE WOULD NOT AFFECT A HOSPITAL'S EXEMPT STATUS IF IT WAS DUE TO THE SURROUNDING COMMUNITY'S LACK OF CHARITABLE DEMANDS. COMMUNITY BENEFIT STANDARD IN 1969, THE IRS ISSUED REVENUE RULING 69-545, WHICH ""REMOVED"" FROM REVENUE RULING 56-185 ""THE REQUIREMENTS RELATING TO CARING FOR PATIENTS WITHOUT CHARGE OR AT RATES BELOW COST."" UNDER THE STANDARD DEVELOPED IN REVENUE RULING 69-545, WHICH IS KNOWN AS THE ""COMMUNITY BENEFIT STANDARD,"" HOSPITALS ARE JUDGED ON WHETHER THEY PROMOTE THE HEALTH OF A BROAD CLASS OF INDIVIDUALS IN THE COMMUNITY. THE RULING INVOLVED A HOSPITAL THAT ONLY ADMITTED INDIVIDUALS WHO COULD PAY FOR THE SERVICES (BY THEMSELVES, PRIVATE INSURANCE, OR PUBLIC PROGRAMS SUCH AS MEDICARE), BUT OPERATED A FULL-TIME EMERGENCY ROOM THAT WAS OPEN TO EVERYONE. THE IRS RULED THAT THE HOSPITAL QUALIFIED AS A CHARITABLE ORGANIZATION BECAUSE IT PROMOTED THE HEALTH OF PEOPLE IN ITS COMMUNITY. THE IRS REASONED THAT BECAUSE THE PROMOTION OF HEALTH WAS A CHARITABLE PURPOSE ACCORDING TO THE GENERAL LAW OF CHARITY, IT FELL WITHIN THE ""GENERALLY ACCEPTED LEGAL SENSE"" OF THE TERM ""CHARITABLE,"" AS REQUIRED BY THE DEPARTMENT OF TREASURY REG. 1.501(C)(3)-1(D)(2). THE IRS RULING STATED THAT THE PROMOTION OF HEALTH, LIKE THE RELIEF OF POVERTY AND THE ADVANCEMENT OF EDUCATION AND RELIGION, IS ONE OF THE PURPOSES IN THE GENERAL LAW OF CHARITY THAT IS DEEMED BENEFICIAL TO THE COMMUNITY AS A WHOLE EVEN THOUGH THE CLASS OF BENEFICIARIES ELIGIBLE TO RECEIVE A DIRECT BENEFIT FROM ITS ACTIVITIES DOES NOT INCLUDE ALL MEMBERS OF THE COMMUNITY, SUCH AS INDIGENT MEMBERS OF THE COMMUNITY, PROVIDED THAT THE CLASS IS NOT SO SMALL THAT ITS RELIEF IS NOT OF BENEFIT TO THE COMMUNITY. THE IRS CONCLUDED THAT THE HOSPITAL WAS ""PROMOTING THE HEALTH OF A CLASS OF PERSONS THAT IS BROAD ENOUGH TO BENEFIT THE COMMUNITY"" BECAUSE ITS EMERGENCY ROOM WAS OPEN TO ALL AND IT PROVIDED CARE TO EVERYONE WHO COULD PAY, WHETHER DIRECTLY OR THROUGH THIRD-PARTY REIMBURSEMENT. OTHER CHARACTERISTICS OF THE HOSPITAL THAT THE IRS HIGHLIGHTED INCLUDED THE FOLLOWING: ITS SURPLUS FUNDS WERE USED TO IMPROVE PATIENT CARE, EXPAND HOSPITAL FACILITIES, AND ADVANCE MEDICAL TRAINING, EDUCATION AND RESEARCH; IT WAS CONTROLLED BY A BOARD OF TRUSTEES THAT CONSISTED OF INDEPENDENT CIVIC LEADERS; AND HOSPITAL MEDICAL STAFF PRIVILEGES WERE AVAILABLE TO ALL QUALIFIED PHYSICIANS. THE AMERICAN HOSPITAL ASSOCIATION (""AHA"") FEELS THAT MEDICARE UNDERPAYMENTS (SHORTFALL) AND BAD DEBT ARE COMMUNITY BENEFIT AND THUS INCLUDABLE ON THE FORM 990, SCHEDULE H, PART I. THIS ORGANIZATION AGREES WITH THE AHA'S POSITION. AS OUTLINED IN THE AHA'S LETTER TO THE IRS DATED AUGUST 21, 2007 WITH RESPECT TO THE FIRST PUBLISHED DRAFT OF THE NEW FORM 990 AND SCHEDULE H, THE AHA FELT THAT THE IRS SHOULD INCORPORATE THE FULL VALUE OF THE COMMUNITY BENEFIT THAT HOSPITALS PROVIDE BY COUNTING MEDICARE UNDERPAYMENTS (SHORTFALL) AS QUANTIFIABLE COMMUNITY BENEFIT FOR THE FOLLOWING REASONS: - PROVIDING CARE FOR THE ELDERLY AND SERVING MEDICARE PATIENTS IS AN ESSENTIAL PART OF THE COMMUNITY BENEFIT STANDARD - MEDICARE, LIKE MEDICAID, DOES NOT PAY THE FULL COST OF CARE. FROM THE LATEST DATA PROVIDED BY THE AHA, AS OF 2017, MEDICARE REIMBURSES HOSPITALS ONLY 87 CENTS FOR EVERY DOLLAR THEY SPEND TO TAKE CARE OF MEDICARE PATIENTS. - MANY MEDICARE BENEFICIARIES, LIKE THEIR MEDICAID COUNTERPARTS, ARE POOR. MORE THAN 42 PERCENT OF MEDICARE SPENDING IS FOR BENEFICIARIES WHOSE INCOME IS BELOW 200 PERCENT OF THE FEDERAL POVERTY LEVEL. MANY OF THOSE MEDICARE BENEFICIARIES ARE ALSO ELIGIBLE FOR MEDICAID -- SO CALLED ELIGIBLE."" THERE IS EVERY COMPELLING PUBLIC POLICY REASON TO TREAT MEDICARE AND MEDICAID UNDERPAYMENTS SIMILARLY FOR PURPOSES OF A HOSPITAL'S COMMUNITY BENEFIT AND INCLUDE THESE COSTS ON FORM 990, SCHEDULE H, PART I. MEDICARE UNDERPAYMENT MUST BE SHOULDERED BY THE HOSPITAL IN ORDER TO CONTINUE TREATING THE COMMUNITY'S ELDERLY AND POOR. THESE UNDERPAYMENTS REPRESENT A REAL COST OF SERVING THE COMMUNITY AND SHOULD COUNT AS A QUANTIFIABLE COMMUNITY BENEFIT. BOTH THE AHA AND THIS ORGANIZATION ALSO FEEL THAT PATIENT BAD DEBT IS A COMMUNITY BENEFIT AND THUS INCLUDABLE ON THE FORM 990, SCHEDULE H, PART I. LIKE MEDICARE UNDERPAYMENT (SHORTFALLS), THERE ALSO ARE COMPELLING REASONS THAT PATIENT BAD DEBT SHOULD BE COUNTED AS QUANTIFIABLE COMMUNITY BENEFIT AS FOLLOWS: - A SIGNIFICANT MAJORITY OF BAD DEBT IS ATTRIBUTABLE TO LOW-INCOME PATIENTS, WHO, FOR MANY REASONS, DECLINE TO COMPLETE THE FORMS REQUIRED TO ESTABLISH ELIGIBILITY FOR HOSPITALS' CHARITY CARE OR THOSE WHO DO NOT PAY ALL, OR A PORTION OF THE ALREADY DISCOUNTED BILLED AMOUNTS UNDER OUR FINANCIAL ASSISTANCE POLICY. A 2006 CONGRESSIONAL BUDGET OFFICE (""CBO"") REPORT, NONPROFIT HOSPITALS AND THE PROVISION OF COMMUNITY BENEFITS, CITED TWO STUDIES INDICATING THAT ""THE GREAT MAJORITY OF BAD DEBT WAS ATTRIBUTABLE TO PATIENTS WITH INCOMES BELOW 200% OF THE FEDERAL POVERTY LINE."" - THE REPORT ALSO NOTED THAT A SUBSTANTIAL PORTION OF BAD DEBT IS PENDING CHARITY CARE. UNLIKE BAD DEBT IN OTHER INDUSTRIES, HOSPITAL BAD DEBT IS COMPLICATED BY THE FACT THAT HOSPITALS FOLLOW THEIR MISSION TO THE COMMUNITY AND TREAT EVERY PATIENT THAT COMES THROUGH THEIR EMERGENCY DEPARTMENT, REGARDLESS OF ABILITY TO PAY. PATIENTS WHO HAVE OUTSTANDING BILLS ARE NOT TURNED AWAY, UNLIKE OTHER INDUSTRIES. BAD DEBT IS FURTHER COMPLICATED BY THE AUDITING INDUSTRY'S STANDARDS ON REPORTING CHARITY CARE. MANY PATIENTS CANNOT OR DO NOT PROVIDE THE NECESSARY, EXTENSIVE DOCUMENTATION REQUIRED TO BE DEEMED CHARITY CARE BY AUDITORS. AS A RESULT, ROUGHLY 40% OF BAD DEBT IS PENDING CHARITY CARE. THE CBO CONCLUDED THAT ITS FINDINGS ""SUPPORT THE VALIDITY OF THE USE OF UNCOMPENSATED CARE [BAD DEBT AND CHARITY CARE] AS A MEASURE OF COMMUNITY BENEFIT"" ASSUMING THE FINDINGS ARE GENERALIZABLE NATIONWIDE; THE EXPERIENCE OF HOSPITALS AROUND THE NATION REINFORCES THAT THEY ARE GENERALIZABLE. AS OUTLINED BY THE AHA, DESPITE THE HOSPITAL'S BEST EFFORTS AND DUE DILIGENCE, PATIENT BAD DEBT IS A PART OF THE HOSPITAL'S MISSION AND CHARITABLE PURPOSES. BAD DEBT REPRESENTS PART OF THE BURDEN HOSPITALS SHOULDER IN SERVING ALL"

THE PURPOSE OF THE PLAN IS TO PROVIDE DIRECTION AND CONTEXT FOR HOSPITAL DECISION MAKING AND RESOURCE ALLOCATION CONSISTENT WITH LOCAL HEALTH CARE NEEDS AND MARKET OPPORTUNITIES. TO ACCOMPLISH THIS TASK, THE COMMITTEE CREATED A COMPREHENSIVE, PARTICIPATORY PROCESS TO SOLICIT INPUT FROM ALL LEVELS OF THE ORGANIZATION AND THE COMMUNITY. A MULTI-STEP PLANNING PROCESS WAS INITIATED.STEP 1 INVOLVED THE REVIEW AND REVISION OF THE HOSPITAL'S MISSION AND VISION STATEMENTS. BOTH STATEMENTS WERE MODIFIED FROM WHAT HAD PREVIOUSLY EXISTED. A CONCISE, VALUE DRIVEN MISSION STATEMENT WAS DEVELOPED IN RESPONSE TO THE NEED FOR MISSION STATEMENTS TO DESCRIBE ""WHO WE ARE."" ADDITIONALLY, SEVERAL CORE VALUES WERE DELINEATED IN SUPPORT OF THE MISSION STATEMENT. THE VISION STATEMENT WAS DEVELOPED IN RESPONSE TO THE QUESTION OF ""WHAT DO WE WISH TO BECOME"" WITH THE UNDERSTANDING THAT VISION STATEMENTS SHOULD BE REALISTIC, CREDIBLE, AND POSSESS THE ABILITY TO INSPIRE AND MOTIVATE. STEP 2 IDENTIFIED A SERIES OF CRITICAL ISSUES FACING THE HOSPITAL THAT WILL PROVIDE THE CONTEXT FOR THE HOSPITAL'S NEAR TERM OPERATING ENVIRONMENT WITH RESPECT TO CARE DELIVERY, REGULATION, COMPETITION, FINANCE AND KEY PUBLICS. STEP 3 INVOLVED THE DEVELOPMENT OF A COMPREHENSIVE ENVIRONMENTAL ANALYSIS, INCLUDING AN INTERNAL AND EXTERNAL ASSESSMENT OF THE HOSPITAL. THE INTERNAL ASSESSMENT WAS PROVIDED VIA MULTIPLE FOCUS GROUPS - OPEN DISCUSSIONS ABOUT THE HOSPITAL'S STRENGTHS, WEAKNESSES, OPPORTUNITIES AND THREATS. THESE FOCUS GROUPS, FACILITATED BY AN OUTSIDE CONSULTANT RETAINED BY THE HOSPITAL, PROVIDED INPUT FROM PHYSICIANS, EMPLOYEES, VOLUNTEERS AND THE COMMUNITY AND PROVIDED SIGNIFICANT INSIGHT INTO STRENGTHS, WEAKNESSES, AND OPPORTUNITIES FOR IMPROVEMENT. THE EXTERNAL ASSESSMENT WAS DEVELOPED FROM THE COMPILATION OF UTILIZATION, MARKET SHARE DEMOGRAPHIC AND FINANCIAL DATA AND PHYSICIAN WORKFORCE INFORMATION SPECIFIC TO THE HOSPITAL'S SERVICE AREA.STEPS 4, 5 AND 6 IDENTIFIED GOALS, STRATEGIES, AND OBJECTIVES THAT WILL SERVE AS OLEAN GENERAL HOSPITAL'S PRIORITIES THROUGH 2019. THE PLAN WAS REVIEWED IN JUNE 2016 AND INITIATIVES ADDED THAT WERE CARRIED OUT IN 2016. GOALS RESPOND TO THE QUESTION ""WHAT ARE THE KEY PRIORITIES?"" A SERIES OF STRATEGIES WERE DEVELOPED WHICH RESPOND TO THE QUESTION ""HOW DO WE ACHIEVE OUR PRIORITIES?"" FINALLY, A NUMBER OF SPECIFIC OBJECTIVES WERE DEVELOPED WHICH RESPOND TO THE QUESTION ""WHAT WILL BE ACCOMPLISHED ANNUALLY?"" OBJECTIVES WERE GENERATED BY SENIOR MANAGEMENT AND FORM THE BASIS FOR NEAR TERM ADMINISTRATIVE WORKPLANS.ESSENTIAL TO THE SUCCESS OF ANY STRATEGIC PLAN IS THE HOSPITAL'S ABILITY TO BOTH IMPLEMENT RECOMMENDATIONS MADE WITHIN THE PLAN AND TO RECOGNIZE THE DOCUMENT AS A DYNAMIC AND FLEXIBLE TOOL TO BE USED AS A GUIDE FOR THE FUTURE. SPECIFIC GOALS AND STRATEGIES MAY OR MAY NOT BE OBTAINED AND, UPON EVALUATION AND THE AVAILABILITY OF NEW INFORMATION AND DEVELOPMENTS, MAY NEED TO BE MODIFIED. A SUCCESSFUL STRATEGIC PLAN RECOGNIZES THIS POTENTIAL FOR CHANGE AND IS FLEXIBLE ENOUGH TO ACCOMMODATE NEW OR DIFFERENT OPPORTUNITIES AND CHALLENGES.CRITICAL HEALTH CARE ISSUESHEALTHCARE REFORM LEGISLATION UNDERSCORES MANY OF THE SIGNIFICANT ISSUES CURRENTLY FACING HOSPITALS. FOLLOWING IS LISTING OF CRITICAL ISSUES THAT WILL IMPACT HOSPITALS OVER THE NEXT SEVERAL YEARS. 1.QUALITY: HEALTH CARE QUALITY AND SAFETY ARE NOW STRATEGICALLY IMPORTANT, NOT JUST PROFESSIONALLY IMPORTANT. THE ADVENT OF WIDESPREAD PUBLIC REPORTING OF HOSPITAL QUALITY RESULTS ASSURES THAT A HOSPITAL'S QUALITY PERFORMANCE IS NO LONGER ONLY VISIBLE TO THE DIRECTOR OF QUALITY, QA COMMITTEE MEMBERS AND VARIOUS REGULATORS. THE NET EFFECT OF THIS TRANSPARENCY TREND OVER THE NEXT 5 YEARS WILL BE THAT THE DEFINITION OF A ""GOOD HOSPITAL"" WILL SHIFT SIGNIFICANTLY. NO LONGER WILL IT BE ENOUGH TO HAVE ATTRACTIVE FACILITIES, GOOD TECHNOLOGIES AND SKILLED DOCTORS AND NURSES. HOSPITALS WILL NEED TO MARSHAL THOSE RESOURCES INTO A QUALITY AND SAFETY SYSTEM CAPABLE OF RELIABLY PRODUCING MEASURED QUALITY RESULTS. PROVIDER PAYMENTS WILL INCREASINGLY BE A FUNCTION OF QUALITY OUTCOMES AND QUALITY BONUSES WILL BE DRAWN FROM ANNUAL PAYMENT UPDATES. INFORMATION SYSTEMS CAPABLE OF PROVIDING VALID AND RELIABLE QUALITY AND OUTCOME INDICATORS WILL BE A NECESSITY AS WILL THE USE OF EVIDENCE BASED GUIDELINES BY CLINICAL PROVIDERS. CONSUMERS WILL SEEK AND USE PERFORMANCE INFORMATION, INCLUDING PATIENT SATISFACTION INFORMATION, TO GUIDE THEIR CHOICE OF PROVIDERS.2.INFORMATION TECHNOLOGY: HEALTH INFORMATION TECHNOLOGY INCLUDES COMPUTER BASED TOOLS DEVELOPED SPECIFICALLY FOR HEALTH CARE DELIVERY. THESE TOOLS CAN PROVIDE CLINICIANS UP-TO-DATE INFORMATION ON THEIR PATIENTS, ACCESS TO THE LATEST MEDICAL KNOWLEDGE AND BEST PRACTICES THROUGH DECISION SUPPORT SYSTEMS. IT IS UNDERSTOOD THAT INVESTMENTS IN NEW CLINICAL AND INFORMATION TECHNOLOGY CAN SIGNIFICANTLY ENHANCE PATIENT SAFETY AND CLINICAL OUTCOMES. COMPUTERIZED PHYSICIAN ORDER ENTRY (CPOE), BAR CODING AND ITS POTENTIAL TO REDUCE MEDICATION ERRORS, AND ELECTRONIC MEDICAL RECORDS (EMRS) AND THEIR POSITIVE IMPACT ON MEDICAL ERRORS ARE ALL EXAMPLES OF HEALTH CARE'S USE OF IT SOLUTIONS TO IMPROVE QUALITY. THE FEDERAL GOVERNMENT HAS HIGHLIGHTED THE ROLE OF HEALTH INFORMATION TECHNOLOGY AS A MEANS TO IMPROVE HEALTH CARE QUALITY, SAFETY PROVIDED STIMULUS AND INCENTIVE PAYMENTS TO PROVIDERS TO FACILITATE AND HASTEN THEIR ADOPTION INTO THE CARE DELIVERY PROCESS. EMR'S HAVE BECOME A PREREQUISITE OF ANY DELIVERY SYSTEM THAT INTENDS TO PROVIDE COORDINATED COST EFFECTIVE CARE.3.PHYSICIANS: PHYSICIANS HAVE EMERGED AS CRITICAL OPERATIONAL AND STRATEGIC PARTNERS TO HOSPITALS. THOSE THAT ARE SUCCESSFUL IN ENGAGING AND COLLABORATING WITH THEIR MEDICAL STAFF WILL BE BEST ABLE TO DEMONSTRATE HIGH QUALITY CARE AND COMPLIANCE WITH HEALTH REFORM'S VALUE BASED PURCHASING AND OTHER QUALITY MANDATES. ADDITIONALLY, GIVEN THE INCREASE IN DEMAND FOR HEALTHCARE SERVICES THAT WILL BE OCCASIONED BY REFORM, THE ABILITY TO SUCCESSFULLY RECRUIT PHYSICIANS WILL BE CRITICAL. AT A TIME WHEN HEALTHCARE REFORM INITIATIVES EMPHASIZE THE ROLE OF PRIMARY CARE, THERE IS A SPECIAL NEED TO INTENSIFY EFFORTS TO RECRUIT PRIMARY CARE PROVIDERS. BECAUSE THE VAST MAJORITY OF NEW PHYSICIANS PREFER EMPLOYMENT AS THEIR PRACTICE PREFERENCE, THE ABILITY OF HOSPITALS TO BE ABLE TO OFFER PHYSICIANS A CONTEMPORARY AND COMPETITIVE ""EMPLOYMENT PLATFORM"" IS ESSENTIAL.4.FINANCE AND CAPITAL: FINANCIAL PERFORMANCE AND ACCESS TO CAPITAL WILL CONTINUE TO BE AMONG THE MOST CRITICAL ISSUES CONFRONTING HOSPITALS. EVEN WITH HEALTHCARE REFORM, HEALTHCARE COSTS WILL CONTINUE TO OUTPACE INFLATION. INCREASING WAGE AND SALARY COSTS, AND RISING HEALTH CARE COSTS IN GENERAL WILL CONTINUE TO IMPACT OPERATING PERFORMANCE AND PRESS HOSPITALS TO CONTINUE A RELENTLESS FOCUS ON COST MANAGEMENT. ADDITIONALLY, REVENUE STRATEGIES WILL NEED TO BE DEVELOPED TO GENERATE PROFITABLE GROWTH IN PATIENT VOLUME, AS WILL THE NEED TO ENSURE OPTIMAL MANAGEMENT OF ALL REVENUE CYCLE ACTIVITIES. HOSPITALS ARE FACING SIGNIFICANT ANNUAL PAYMENT REDUCTIONS IN TERMS OF DECREASES IN MEDICARE UPDATES, DISPROPORTIONATE SHARE, SNF AND HOMECARE PAYMENTS. AS HOSPITALS CONTINUE TO POST LOW OR NO PROFIT MARGINS, INVESTMENT INCOME WILL BE MORE IMPORTANT THAN EVER. HOWEVER, GIVEN THE FACT THAT INVESTMENT INCOME IS A HIGHLY UNCERTAIN COMPONENT OF A HOSPITAL'S OVERALL FINANCIAL HEALTH, HOSPITALS WILL BE DRIVEN TO PURSUE MORE PHILANTHROPY. HOSPITAL CAPITAL SPENDING WILL BE DRIVEN BY GROWING DEMANDS FOR ADVANCED TECHNOLOGY NEEDED TO ENSURE PATIENT QUALITY AND SAFETY, THE NEED TO REPLACE AND UPDATE AGING FACILITIES, AND THE DESIRE AND NEED TO IMPROVE TECHNOLOGY BASED SERVICES.IN 2016 OGH'S BOARD OF DIRECTORS VOTED TO BECOME PART OF THE KALEIDA HEALTH SYSTEM, A BUFFALO, NEW YORK-BASED HEALTH SYSTEM. THIS DECISION WAS BASED ON A FIVE YEAR LONG-TERM FINANCIAL PLAN THAT WAS DEVELOPED FOR OGH AND ITS THEN SISTER HOSPITAL UNDER OGH'S PARENT COMPANY- UPPER ALLEGHENY HEALTH SYSTEM (UAHS), WHICH DEMONSTRATED A FUTURE INABILITY TO REMAIN FINANCIALLY VIABLE GIVEN THE DOWNWARD PRESSURES ON REVENUE IN THE HEALTH CARE INDUSTRY AS WELL AS RISING COSTS TO PROVIDE CARE. OGH IS NOT UNIQUE IN THIS VULNERABLE POSITION. HOSPITALS ACROSS AMERICA, ESPECIALLY RURAL HOSPITALS, FACE A DAUNTING CHALLENGE OF SURVIVAL. SIGNIFICANT TIME WAS SPENT ANALYZING OGH'S AND UAHS' FINANCES AND EVALUATING KALEIDA HEALTH AS A PARTNER. A DECISION TO AFFILIATE WAS MADE IN THE FALL OF 2016. THE AFFILIATION WAS FORMALLY COMPLETED ON JULY 3, 2017.

The footnote for Accounts Receivable is as follows Patient accounts receivable are reported at net realizable value. For receivables associated with services provided to patients who have third-party coverage, the System estimates net realizable value based on the estimated contractual reimbursement percentage, which in turn is based on current contract provisions and historical paid claims by payor. For self-pay accounts, including uninsured and patient responsibility accounts, the net realizable value is determined using historical collection experience, adjusted for estimated conversions of patient responsibility portions, expected recoveries and changes in trends to estimate implicit price concessions in 2018 or the provision for bad debts in 2017. Management continually reviews the estimated net realizable value of accounts receivable by monitoring cash collections, economic conditions and trends, changes in payor mix, changes in federal or state healthcare coverage and other matters. The System grants credit without collateral to its patients, most of whom are local residents and are insured under third-party agreements, primarily with Medicare, Medicaid, and various commercial insurance companies. The System records accounts receivable net of estimated price concessions in 2018 and allowances for bad debts in 2017 and such amounts have historically been within managements expectations. The mix of accounts receivable at December 31, 2018 and 2017, from patients and third-party payors is as follows. For 2018, Medicare 29, Medicaid 18, Blue Cross 24, Commercial/Managed Care/Other 26, Patients 3, Total 100.

The difference between the billed rates and the amounts actually collected after all reasonable collection efforts have been exhausted is charged off against the allowance for doubtful accounts."

The hospitals FY18 CHNA and three-year Implementation Strategies were endorsed by MWHCs Board of Directors and approved by the MedStar Health Board of Directors. The document became available on the hospitals website on June 30, 2018. During FY19, key revisions were made across MedStar Health to more effectively impact the communities served throughout Maryland and Washington, DC. Several internal meetings were convened with leadership from each MedStar Health Hospital to review current practices and strategies. As a result of these meetings, the approach to the current CHNA for the remainder of the three-year cycle (FY19-FY21) was revised. A key revision to the CHNA is a greater focus on hospital area strategies that are most appropriate for the local communities served. The number of strategies each hospital is accountable for executing was reduced to encourage more meaningful reach within key areas contrasted with broader reach with reduced impact. Using the standard categories, Health and Wellness, Access to Care and Social Determinants of Health to determine what to prioritize for the CHNA IRS requirements, each hospital agreed to select two to three strategies as priorities that have size and scale impact and measurable outcomes. All other programming was integrated as part of the hospitals overall community health portfolio. These additional programs were captured in the inventory for the whole picture of contributing to the health of the communities served as well as sorted for what counts as community benefit for regulatory reporting. The hospitals Community Benefit Service Area (CBSA) remains the same, based on the Advisory Task Force (ATF) recommendation. The hospital identified District of Columbia Wards 7 and 8 as its CBSA, which includes all residents living in ZIP codes 20011, 20019 and 20020. The hospital selected this geographic area based on hospital utilization data and secondary public health data as well as its proximity to the hospital. The ATF included a diverse group of individuals, including hospital leaders, grassroots activists, community residents, faith-based leaders, hospital representatives, public health leaders and other stakeholder organizations, such as representatives from local health departments. MWHCs health priorities for the CBSA include health and wellness (chronic disease prevention and management) and social determinants of health (social needs screening). As a proud member of MedStar Health, representatives from MWHC routinely participate in the MedStar Health community health workgroup. The workgroup is comprised of community health professionals who represent all ten MedStar hospitals. The team analyzes local and regional community health data, establishes system-wide community health programming performance and evaluation measures and shares best practices."

The Rockefeller University Hospital is a unique institution. As an institution solely committed to conducting clinical research our community/service area is defined as the New York Metropolitan Area. The Rockefeller University Hospital has provided an array of clinical research and patient care services since its founding in 1910. The Rockefeller University Hospital community served/service area is determined based on research being conducted. Principal Investigators identify an area of interest and submit a protocol for review and approval by our institutional review board. If and when the protocol is approved, our recruitment office works with the investigator to develop and submit advertisements in local newspapers, magazines and online. Identification of lucrative places to advertise is determined by current trends in readership among local newspapers, magazines and visits to particular websites such as Craigslist and Facebook. Research participants are culled from all over New York City as well as through collaborations with neighboring hospitals, Universities, and clinics. As a result, our enrolled research participant demographics are similar to those of New York City overall. In calendar year 2018 15% of research participants identified as Hispanic, 33% identified as Black or African-American and 41% identified as white (RUH subject race and ethnicity report 2018), which is similar to the geographic makeup of New York City (42.8% white, 24.3% Black or African-American, and 29.1% Hispanic) https://www.census.gov/quickfacts/fact/table/newyorkcitynewyork,US/PST045218."

AS OUTLINED IN PART V, SECTION B, QUESTION 13, OTHER FACTORS TO DETERMINE ELIGIBILITY INCLUDE: - ASSET LEVEL; - MEDICAL INDIGENCY; - INSURANCE STATUS; - UNDERINSURANCE STATUS; AND - RESIDENCY. ADDITIONAL INFORMATION WITH RESPECT TO THE ORGANIZATION'S ELIGIBILITY CRITERIA FOR FINANCIAL ASSISTANCE IS OUTLINED BELOW. NEW JERSEY HOSPITAL CHARITY CARE PAYMENT ASSISTANCE PROGRAM (""CHARITY CARE"") ------------------------------------------------------------------------- CHARITY CARE IS A NEW JERSEY PROGRAM IN WHICH FREE OR DISCOUNTED CARE IS AVAILABLE TO PATIENTS WHO RECEIVE INPATIENT AND OUTPATIENT SERVICES AT ACUTE CARE HOSPITALS THROUGHOUT THE STATE OF NEW JERSEY. HOSPITAL ASSISTANCE AND REDUCED CHARGE CARE ARE ONLY AVAILABLE FOR NECESSARY EMERGENCY OR OTHER MEDICALLY NECESSARY CARE. PATIENTS MAY BE ELIGIBLE FOR CHARITY CARE IF THEY ARE NEW JERSEY RESIDENTS WHO: 1) HAVE NO HEALTH COVERAGE OR HAVE COVERAGE THAT PAYS ONLY PART OF THE HOSPITAL BILL (UNINSURED OR UNDERINSURED); 2) ARE INELIGIBLE FOR ANY PRIVATE OR GOVERNMENTAL SPONSORED COVERAGE (SUCH AS MEDICAID); AND 3) MEET THE FOLLOWING INCOME AND ASSET ELIGIBILITY CRITERIA DESCRIBED BELOW. INCOME CRITERIA: PATIENTS WITH FAMILY GROSS INCOME LESS THAN OR EQUAL TO 200% OF FEDERAL POVERTY GUIDELINES (""FPG"") ARE ELIGIBLE FOR 100% CHARITY CARE COVERAGE. PATIENTS WITH FAMILY GROSS INCOME GREATER THAN 200% AND LESS THAN OR EQUAL TO 300% OF FPG ARE ELIGIBLE FOR DISCOUNTED CARE. FREE CARE OR PARTIALLY COVERED CHARGES WILL BE DETERMINED BY USE OF THE NEW JERSEY DEPARTMENT OF HEALTH FEE SCHEDULE. IF PATIENTS ON THE 20% TO 80% SLIDING FEE SCALE ARE RESPONSIBLE FOR QUALIFIED OUT-OF-POCKET PAID MEDICAL EXPENSES IN EXCESS OF 30% OF THEIR GROSS ANNUAL INCOME (I.E. BILLS UNPAID BY OTHER PARTIES), THEN THE AMOUNT IN EXCESS OF 30% IS CONSIDERED HOSPITAL CARE PAYMENT ASSISTANCE. ASSET CRITERIA: CHARITY CARE INCLUDES ASSET ELIGIBILITY THRESHOLDS WHICH STATES THAT INDIVIDUAL ASSETS CANNOT EXCEED $7,500 AND FAMILY ASSETS CANNOT EXCEED $15,000 AS OF THE DATE OF SERVICE. CHARITY CARE MAY BE AVAILABLE TO NON-NEW JERSEY RESIDENTS, REQUIRING IMMEDIATE MEDICAL ATTENTION FOR AN EMERGENCY MEDICAL CONDITION. NEW JERSEY UNINSURED DISCOUNT (PUBLIC LAW 2008, C. 60) ------------------------------------------------------ UNINSURED PATIENTS WITH FAMILY GROSS INCOME LESS THAN 500% OF FPG MAY BE ELIGIBLE FOR DISCOUNTED CARE UNDER THIS PROGRAM. ELIGIBLE INDIVIDUALS MUST BE NEW JERSEY RESIDENTS. NJ FAMILYCARE ------------- NJ FAMILYCARE IS NEW JERSEY'S PUBLICLY FUNDED HEALTH INSURANCE PROGRAM WHICH INCLUDES CHIP, MEDICAID AND MEDICAID EXPANSION POPULATIONS.

NJ FAMILYCARE IS FOR PEOPLE WHO DO NOT HAVE EMPLOYER INSURANCE. FINANCIAL ELIGIBILITY FOR INDIVIDUALS SEEKING ELIGIBILITY FOR NJ FAMILYCARE WILL BE BASED ON THEIR MODIFIED ADJUSTED GROSS INCOME (""MAGI""). NJFAMILYCARE ELIGIBILITY GUIDELINES ARE ESTABLISHED BY THE STATE OF NEW JERSEY AND CAN BE FOUND AT WWW.NJFAMILYCARE.ORG. NEW JERSEY CANCER EDUCATION AND EARLY DETECTION (""NJCEED"") ---------------------------------------------------------- THE NJCEED PROGRAM PROVIDES COMPREHENSIVE OUTREACH, EDUCATION AND SCREENING SERVICES FOR BREAST, CERVICAL, COLORECTAL AND PROSTATE CANCERS. A PATIENT MUST BE UNINSURED OR UNDERINSURED AND MUST HAVE FAMILY GROSS INCOME AT OR BELOW 250% OF FPG TO BE ELIGIBLE.

201943199349301934,210634484,"SCHEDULE H, PART III, SECTION B; QUESTION 8","MEDICARE COSTS WERE DERIVED FROM THE 2018 MEDICARE COST REPORT. THE ORGANIZATION FEELS THAT MEDICARE UNDERPAYMENTS (SHORTFALL), BAD DEBT AND ASSOCIATED COSTS ARE COMMUNITY BENEFIT AND ARE INCLUDABLE ON THE FORM 990, SCHEDULE H, PART I. AS OUTLINED MORE FULLY BELOW, THE ORGANIZATION BELIEVES THAT THESE SERVICES AND RELATED COSTS PROMOTE THE HEALTH OF THE COMMUNITY AS A WHOLE AND ARE RENDERED IN CONJUNCTION WITH THE ORGANIZATION'S CHARITABLE TAX-EXEMPT PURPOSES AND MISSION IN PROVIDING MEDICALLY NECESSARY HEALTHCARE SERVICES TO ALL INDIVIDUALS IN A NON-DISCRIMINATORY MANNER WITHOUT REGARD TO RACE, COLOR, CREED, SEX, NATIONAL ORIGIN OR ABILITY TO PAY AND CONSISTENT WITH THE COMMUNITY BENEFIT STANDARD PROMULGATED BY THE IRS. THE COMMUNITY BENEFIT STANDARD IS THE CURRENT STANDARD FOR A HOSPITAL FOR RECOGNITION AS A TAX-EXEMPT AND CHARITABLE ORGANIZATION UNDER INTERNAL REVENUE CODE (""IRC"") 501(C)(3). THE ORGANIZATION IS RECOGNIZED AS A TAX-EXEMPT ENTITY AND CHARITABLE ORGANIZATION UNDER 501(C)(3) OF THE IRC. ALTHOUGH THERE IS NO DEFINITION IN THE TAX CODE FOR THE TERM ""CHARITABLE"" A REGULATION PROMULGATED BY THE DEPARTMENT OF THE TREASURY PROVIDES SOME GUIDANCE AND STATES THAT ""THE TERM CHARITABLE IS USED IN SECTION 501(C)(3) IN ITS GENERALLY ACCEPTED LEGAL SENSE,PROVIDES EXAMPLES OF CHARITABLE PURPOSES, INCLUDING THE RELIEF OF THE POOR OR UNPRIVILEGED; THE PROMOTION OF SOCIAL WELFARE; AND THE ADVANCEMENT OF EDUCATION, RELIGION, AND SCIENCE. NOTE IT DOES NOT EXPLICITLY ADDRESS THE ACTIVITIES OF HOSPITALS. IN THE ABSENCE OF EXPLICIT STATUTORY OR REGULATORY REQUIREMENTS APPLYING THE TERM ""CHARITABLE"" TO HOSPITALS, IT HAS BEEN LEFT TO THE IRS TO DETERMINE THE CRITERIA HOSPITALS MUST MEET TO QUALIFY AS IRC 501(C)(3) CHARITABLE ORGANIZATIONS. THE ORIGINAL STANDARD WAS KNOWN AS THE CHARITY CARE STANDARD. THIS STANDARD WAS REPLACED BY THE IRS WITH THE COMMUNITY BENEFIT STANDARD WHICH IS THE CURRENT STANDARD. CHARITY CARE STANDARD IN 1956, THE IRS ISSUED REVENUE RULING 56-185, WHICH ADDRESSED THE REQUIREMENTS HOSPITALS NEEDED TO MEET IN ORDER TO QUALIFY FOR IRC 501(C)(3) STATUS. ONE OF THESE REQUIREMENTS IS KNOWN AS THE ""CHARITY CARE STANDARD."" UNDER THE STANDARD, A HOSPITAL MUST PROVIDE, TO THE EXTENT OF ITS FINANCIAL ABILITY, FREE OR REDUCED-COST CARE TO PATIENTS WHO CANNOT PAY FOR SUCH SERVICES. A HOSPITAL THAT EXPECTED FULL PAYMENT DID NOT, ACCORDING TO THE RULING, PROVIDE CHARITY CARE BASED ON THE FACT THAT SOME PATIENTS ULTIMATELY FAILED TO PAY. THE RULING EMPHASIZED THAT A LOW LEVEL OF CHARITY CARE DID NOT NECESSARILY MEAN THAT A HOSPITAL HAD FAILED TO MEET THE REQUIREMENT SINCE THAT LEVEL COULD REFLECT ITS FINANCIAL ABILITY TO PROVIDE SUCH CARE. THE RULING ALSO NOTED THAT PUBLICLY SUPPORTED COMMUNITY HOSPITALS WOULD NORMALLY QUALIFY AS CHARITABLE ORGANIZATIONS BECAUSE THEY SERVE THE ENTIRE COMMUNITY AND A LOW LEVEL OF CHARITY CARE WOULD NOT AFFECT A HOSPITAL'S EXEMPT STATUS IF IT WAS DUE TO THE SURROUNDING COMMUNITY'S LACK OF CHARITABLE DEMANDS. COMMUNITY BENEFIT STANDARD IN 1969, THE IRS ISSUED REVENUE RULING 69-545, WHICH ""REMOVED"" FROM REVENUE RULING 56-185 ""THE REQUIREMENTS RELATING TO CARING FOR PATIENTS WITHOUT CHARGE OR AT RATES BELOW COST."" UNDER THE STANDARD DEVELOPED IN REVENUE RULING 69-545, WHICH IS KNOWN AS THE ""COMMUNITY BENEFIT STANDARD,"" HOSPITALS ARE JUDGED ON WHETHER THEY PROMOTE THE HEALTH OF A BROAD CLASS OF INDIVIDUALS IN THE COMMUNITY. THE RULING INVOLVED A HOSPITAL THAT ONLY ADMITTED INDIVIDUALS WHO COULD PAY FOR THE SERVICES (BY THEMSELVES, PRIVATE INSURANCE, OR PUBLIC PROGRAMS SUCH AS MEDICARE), BUT OPERATED A FULL-TIME EMERGENCY ROOM THAT WAS OPEN TO EVERYONE. THE IRS RULED THAT THE HOSPITAL QUALIFIED AS A CHARITABLE ORGANIZATION BECAUSE IT PROMOTED THE HEALTH OF PEOPLE IN ITS COMMUNITY. THE IRS REASONED THAT BECAUSE THE PROMOTION OF HEALTH WAS A CHARITABLE PURPOSE ACCORDING TO THE GENERAL LAW OF CHARITY, IT FELL WITHIN THE ""GENERALLY ACCEPTED LEGAL SENSE"" OF THE TERM ""CHARITABLE,"" AS REQUIRED BY THE DEPARTMENT OF TREASURY REG. 1.501(C)(3)-1(D)(2). THE IRS RULING STATED THAT THE PROMOTION OF HEALTH, LIKE THE RELIEF OF POVERTY AND THE ADVANCEMENT OF EDUCATION AND RELIGION, IS ONE OF THE PURPOSES IN THE GENERAL LAW OF CHARITY THAT IS DEEMED BENEFICIAL TO THE COMMUNITY AS A WHOLE EVEN THOUGH THE CLASS OF BENEFICIARIES ELIGIBLE TO RECEIVE A DIRECT BENEFIT FROM ITS ACTIVITIES DOES NOT INCLUDE ALL MEMBERS OF THE COMMUNITY, SUCH AS INDIGENT MEMBERS OF THE COMMUNITY, PROVIDED THAT THE CLASS IS NOT SO SMALL THAT ITS RELIEF IS NOT OF BENEFIT TO THE COMMUNITY. THE IRS CONCLUDED THAT THE HOSPITAL WAS ""PROMOTING THE HEALTH OF A CLASS OF PERSONS THAT IS BROAD ENOUGH TO BENEFIT THE COMMUNITY"" BECAUSE ITS EMERGENCY ROOM WAS OPEN TO ALL AND IT PROVIDED CARE TO EVERYONE WHO COULD PAY, WHETHER DIRECTLY OR THROUGH THIRD-PARTY REIMBURSEMENT. OTHER CHARACTERISTICS OF THE HOSPITAL THAT THE IRS HIGHLIGHTED INCLUDED THE FOLLOWING: ITS SURPLUS FUNDS WERE USED TO IMPROVE PATIENT CARE, EXPAND HOSPITAL FACILITIES, AND ADVANCE MEDICAL TRAINING, EDUCATION AND RESEARCH; IT WAS CONTROLLED BY A BOARD OF TRUSTEES THAT CONSISTED OF INDEPENDENT CIVIC LEADERS; AND HOSPITAL MEDICAL STAFF PRIVILEGES WERE AVAILABLE TO ALL QUALIFIED PHYSICIANS. THE AMERICAN HOSPITAL ASSOCIATION (""AHA"") FEELS THAT MEDICARE UNDERPAYMENTS (SHORTFALL) AND BAD DEBT ARE COMMUNITY BENEFIT AND THUS INCLUDABLE ON THE FORM 990, SCHEDULE H, PART I. THIS ORGANIZATION AGREES WITH THE AHA'S POSITION. AS OUTLINED IN THE AHA'S LETTER TO THE IRS DATED AUGUST 21, 2007 WITH RESPECT TO THE FIRST PUBLISHED DRAFT OF THE NEW FORM 990 AND SCHEDULE H, THE AHA FELT THAT THE IRS SHOULD INCORPORATE THE FULL VALUE OF THE COMMUNITY BENEFIT THAT HOSPITALS PROVIDE BY COUNTING MEDICARE UNDERPAYMENTS (SHORTFALL) AS QUANTIFIABLE COMMUNITY BENEFIT FOR THE FOLLOWING REASONS: - PROVIDING CARE FOR THE ELDERLY AND SERVING MEDICARE PATIENTS IS AN ESSENTIAL PART OF THE COMMUNITY BENEFIT STANDARD - MEDICARE, LIKE MEDICAID, DOES NOT PAY THE FULL COST OF CARE. FROM THE LATEST DATA PROVIDED BY THE AHA, AS OF 2017, MEDICARE REIMBURSES HOSPITALS ONLY 87 CENTS FOR EVERY DOLLAR THEY SPEND TO TAKE CARE OF MEDICARE PATIENTS. - MANY MEDICARE BENEFICIARIES, LIKE THEIR MEDICAID COUNTERPARTS, ARE POOR. MORE THAN 42 PERCENT OF MEDICARE SPENDING IS FOR BENEFICIARIES WHOSE INCOME IS BELOW 200 PERCENT OF THE FEDERAL POVERTY LEVEL. MANY OF THOSE MEDICARE BENEFICIARIES ARE ALSO ELIGIBLE FOR MEDICAID -- SO CALLED ELIGIBLE."" THERE IS EVERY COMPELLING PUBLIC POLICY REASON TO TREAT MEDICARE AND MEDICAID UNDERPAYMENTS SIMILARLY FOR PURPOSES OF A HOSPITAL'S COMMUNITY BENEFIT AND INCLUDE THESE COSTS ON FORM 990, SCHEDULE H, PART I. MEDICARE UNDERPAYMENT MUST BE SHOULDERED BY THE HOSPITAL IN ORDER TO CONTINUE TREATING THE COMMUNITY'S ELDERLY AND POOR. THESE UNDERPAYMENTS REPRESENT A REAL COST OF SERVING THE COMMUNITY AND SHOULD COUNT AS A QUANTIFIABLE COMMUNITY BENEFIT. BOTH THE AHA AND THIS ORGANIZATION ALSO FEEL THAT PATIENT BAD DEBT IS A COMMUNITY BENEFIT AND THUS INCLUDABLE ON THE FORM 990, SCHEDULE H, PART I. LIKE MEDICARE UNDERPAYMENT (SHORTFALLS), THERE ALSO ARE COMPELLING REASONS THAT PATIENT BAD DEBT SHOULD BE COUNTED AS QUANTIFIABLE COMMUNITY BENEFIT AS FOLLOWS: - A SIGNIFICANT MAJORITY OF BAD DEBT IS ATTRIBUTABLE TO LOW-INCOME PATIENTS, WHO, FOR MANY REASONS, DECLINE TO COMPLETE THE FORMS REQUIRED TO ESTABLISH ELIGIBILITY FOR HOSPITALS' CHARITY CARE OR THOSE WHO DO NOT PAY ALL, OR A PORTION OF THE ALREADY DISCOUNTED BILLED AMOUNTS UNDER OUR FINANCIAL ASSISTANCE POLICY. A 2006 CONGRESSIONAL BUDGET OFFICE (""CBO"") REPORT, NONPROFIT HOSPITALS AND THE PROVISION OF COMMUNITY BENEFITS, CITED TWO STUDIES INDICATING THAT ""THE GREAT MAJORITY OF BAD DEBT WAS ATTRIBUTABLE TO PATIENTS WITH INCOMES BELOW 200% OF THE FEDERAL POVERTY LINE."" - THE REPORT ALSO NOTED THAT A SUBSTANTIAL PORTION OF BAD DEBT IS PENDING CHARITY CARE. UNLIKE BAD DEBT IN OTHER INDUSTRIES, HOSPITAL BAD DEBT IS COMPLICATED BY THE FACT THAT HOSPITALS FOLLOW THEIR MISSION TO THE COMMUNITY AND TREAT EVERY PATIENT THAT COMES THROUGH THEIR EMERGENCY DEPARTMENT, REGARDLESS OF ABILITY TO PAY. PATIENTS WHO HAVE OUTSTANDING BILLS ARE NOT TURNED AWAY, UNLIKE OTHER INDUSTRIES. BAD DEBT IS FURTHER COMPLICATED BY THE AUDITING INDUSTRY'S STANDARDS ON REPORTING CHARITY CARE. MANY PATIENTS CANNOT OR DO NOT PROVIDE THE NECESSARY, EXTENSIVE DOCUMENTATION REQUIRED TO BE DEEMED CHARITY CARE BY AUDITORS. AS A RESULT, ROUGHLY 40% OF BAD DEBT IS PENDING CHARITY CARE. THE CBO CONCLUDED THAT ITS FINDINGS ""SUPPORT THE VALIDITY OF THE USE OF UNCOMPENSATED CARE [BAD DEBT AND CHARITY CARE] AS A MEASURE OF COMMUNITY BENEFIT"" ASSUMING THE FINDINGS ARE GENERALIZABLE NATIONWIDE; THE EXPERIENCE OF HOSPITALS AROUND THE NATION REINFORCES THAT THEY ARE GENERALIZABLE. AS OUTLINED BY THE AHA, DESPITE THE HOSPITAL'S BEST EFFORTS AND DUE DILIGENCE, PATIENT BAD DEBT IS A PART OF THE HOSPITAL'S MISSION AND CHARITABLE PURPOSES. BAD DEBT REPRESENTS PART OF THE BURDEN HOSPITALS SHOULDER IN SERVING ALL"

PART I, LINE 7 THE CHRIST HOSPITAL (TCH) APPLIES A COST-TO-CHARGE RATIO FROM WORKSHEET 2 OF THE FORM 990, SCHEDULE H INSTRUCTIONS TO DETERMINE FINANCIAL ASSISTANCE PROVIDED AT COST. PART III, LINES 2 AND 4 The provision for bad debts is based upon management's assessment of historical and expected net collections considering historical business and economic conditions, trends in health care coverage, and other collection indicators. Periodically throughout the year, management assesses the adequacy of the allowance for uncollectible accounts based upon historical write-off experience by payor category. The results of this review are then used to make modifications to the provision for bad debts to establish an appropriate allowance for uncollectible accounts. As a result of certain changes required by ASU 2014-09, the majority of the Network's provision for bad debts is recorded as a direct reduction to net patient service revenue instead of being presented as a separate line on the consolidated statements of operations and changes in net assets. The adoption of ASU 2014-09 has no impact on the Network's patient accounts receivable as it was historically recorded net of the allowance for uncollectible accounts and contractual adjustments on the consolidated balance sheets. PART III, LINE 8 COSTS REPORTED ON LINE 6 ARE OBTAINED FROM THE MEDICARE COST REPORT WHICH IS BASED ON A COST TO CHARGE RATIO. PART III, LINE 9B PATIENTS KNOWN TO QUALIFY FOR CHARITY CARE AND FINANCIAL ASSISTANCE ARE NOT SENT TO COLLECTIONS UNLESS A DETERMINATION IN ACCORDANCE WITH THE FINANCIAL ASSISTANCE POLICY HAS BEEN MADE THAT THE PATIENT HAS THE FINANCIAL RESOURCES TO PAY SOME PORTION OF THEIR BILL BUT REFUSES TO DO SO. Part III, section B In addition to hospital-based revenue and allowable cost generated from Medicare (including DSH and IME) eligible participants reported in Part III Section B, The Christ Hospital provides hospital-based services to other Medicare eligible participants, through Medicare plans sponsored by managed care providers (Medicare Managed Care Plans). Medicare Managed Care Plans are Health Maintenance Organizations (HMOs) or Preferred Provider Organizations (PPOs) that provide basic Medicare coverage plus other coverages to fill gaps in Medicare coverage. These plans have arrangements with certain physicians, hospitals and health care providers to serve patients who are plan members at a contracted rate. Below is the shortfall related to hospital-based revenue and allowable costs under Medicare Managed Care Plans: Revenue received from Medicare Managed Care Plans $108,278,009 Allowable cost of care related to payments from above $(142,090,408) ------------ Shortfall from Medicare Managed Care Plans $(33,812,399) Also, The Christ Hospital has certain Medicare Part B (physician-based) revenue and allowable cost related to services rendered on behalf of Medicare eligible participants by employed physicians of The Christ Hospital. This would include services provided under traditional Medicare, as well as Medicare Managed Care Plans. Below is the shortfall related to the disregarded entities of the Hospital: Revenue received from Medicare Part B Plans (physician-based) $ 100,408,996 Allowable cost of care related to payments from above $(136,321,364) ------------- Shortfall related to the Medicare Part B Plans $ (35,912,368) (physician-based) Part VI NEEDS ASSESSMENT Our first step in conducting our 2019 Community Health Needs Assessment was to define the community we serve. To do so we considered a number of relevant facts and circumstances, including the geographic area we serve, the target populations we serve, and our principle functions as a hospital, which include our service lines. In defining the community we serve, we specifically included the medically underserved, low income and the minority populations who live in the geographic area from which we draw patients. In addition, we included all patients without regard to whether (or how much) they or their insurers pay for care received or whether they are eligible for assistance under our financial assistance policy. We assessed the health needs by engaging the Health Collaborative to conduct a comprehensive and collaborative Community Health Needs Assessment. The Health Collaborative is a nonprofit organization serving the Greater Cincinnati area. It works with its member hospitals on health care improvement projects and shares best practices. The Health Collaborative brought 35 hospitals and 28 local health departments together, including The Christ Hospital, to conduct a comprehensive, collaborative community health needs assessment (Collaborative CHNA). The Collaborative Report also provides a comprehensive and detailed description of (1) how the Collaborative CHNA Team solicited and took into account input received from persons who represent the broad interests of the community, including those with special knowledge of, or expertise in, public health, (2) how and over what period of time such input was provided, (3) the names of organizations providing input and the nature and extent of the organizations input, (4) descriptions of the medically underserved, low income or minority populations being represented by organizations or individuals that provided input. Collectively within 25 counties over 35 hospitals, 28 health departments, including Hamilton County Department of Health, 100 community groups and organizations, and participation of community members. Over 140 data measures were deployed including primary and secondary data over 1400 qualitative surveys. The CHNA team reached out to the local health departments in the spring of 2017 to take the first steps towards the State of Ohio's requirement that health departments and hospitals align their assessments starting in 2020. As a result, the CHNA team has researched more secondary data measures, included hospital utilization data, oversampled vulnerable populations, and engaged more participants. A total of 1,416 people or organizations completed a survey or attended a meeting. A significant part of the increase was due to local health departments helping to promote and conduct meetings. PATIENT EDUCATION OF ELIGIBILITY AND ASSISTANCE TCH POSTS ITS CHARITY CARE POLICY AND FINANCIAL ASSISTANCE CONTRACT INFORMATION IN ADMISSIONS AREAS, EMERGENCY DEPARTMENT, AND OTHER AREAS OF THE ORGANIZATION'S FACILITIES IN WHICH ELIGIBLE PATIENTS ARE LIKELY TO BE PRESENT.

201943199349310439,840166760,"SCHEDULE H, PART II","IN 2018, CHILDRENS HOSPITAL COLORADO PROVIDED $1,284,632 IN COMMUNITY BUILDING ACTIVITIES. THESE ACTIVITIES ARE DESIGNED TO PROMOTE THE HEALTH OF THE BROADER COMMUNITY. WE CONTINUE TO BUILD ON OUR LONG AND STRONG RECORD OF COLLABORATION WITH COMMUNITY GROUPS, BUSINESSES, ACADEMIC INSTITUTIONS AND GOVERNMENTAL AND NON-GOVERNMENTAL ORGANIZATIONS, WITH THE GOAL OF IMPROVING HEALTH OUTCOMES AND REDUCING HEALTH DISPARITIES FOR CHILDREN AND THEIR FAMILIES. ADDITIONALLY, SIGNIFICANT RESOURCES WERE ALLOCATED IN 2018 TO SUPPORT EFFORTS TO ENGAGE COMMUNITY MEMBERS IN ADVOCATING FOR ACCESS TO HEALTH CARE AS WELL AS PROVIDING EDUCATIONAL SESSIONS FOR BOTH POLICYMAKERS AND ADVOCATES ON CHILD HEALTH ISSUES OF IMPORTANCE. IMPROVING THE HEALTH OF THE COMMUNITY THROUGH ENVIRONMENTAL EFFORTS WAS ALSO A PRIORITY, INCLUDING LONG-STANDING RECYCLING AND RETRO COMMISSIONING EFFORTS. FINALLY, THE HOSPITAL CONTRIBUTED SUBSTANTIAL RESOURCES TO PROGRAMS, SUCH AS OUR HIRE LOCAL PROGRAM, THAT PROVIDE A PIPELINE FOR AT-RISK HIGH SCHOOL STUDENTS, AND UNDERSERVED COMMUNITY MEMBERS TO PURSUE HEALTHCARE SPECIFIC CAREERS. SELECTED COMMUNITY BUILDING ACTIVITIES ARE HIGHLIGHTED BELOW. ADVOCACY FOR COMMUNITY HEALTH IMPROVEMENTS AND SAFETY. DURING THE 2018 COLORADO LEGISLATIVE SESSION, THE CHILDRENS HOSPITAL COLORADO GOVERNMENT AFFAIRS TEAM WORKED WITH INTERNAL AND EXTERNAL PARTNERS TO KEEP KIDS OUT OF THE HOSPITAL BY SUPPORTING LAWS THAT WOULD IMPROVE KIDS' HEALTH-AND DEFENDING AGAINST THOSE THAT WOULD NOT. WE BUILT PARTNERSHIPS WITH OUR ALLIES AND ADVOCATES ACROSS THE STATE, ENGAGED OUR HEALTHCARE PROFESSIONALS AND OTHER TEAM MEMBERS AND GAVE A VOICE TO OUR PATIENTS AND FAMILIES. TOGETHER, WE ADVANCED A NUMBER OF POLICY AND ADVOCACY GOALS THAT HAVE THE POTENTIAL TO LIFT THE TRAJECTORY OF A CHILDS LIFE. FOR EXAMPLE: MODERNIZING NEWBORN SCREENING: COLORADOS NEWBORN SCREENING PROGRAM AIMS TO ENSURE EVERY COLORADO BABY RECEIVES A GENETIC, METABOLIC AND HEARING SCREENING UPON BIRTH. THESE SCREENINGS HELP IDENTIFY POTENTIALLY LIFE-THREATENING CONDITIONS, AS WELL AS HEARING LOSS. IF THESE CONDITIONS ARENT IDENTIFIED VERY EARLY IN LIFE, THEY CAN LEAD TO SEVERE HEALTH CONSEQUENCES AND DEVELOPMENTAL DELAYS OR EVEN DEATH. HOWEVER, THAT LAW DATES BACK TO THE 1990S AND DID NOT INCLUDE SCREENING FOR MANY CONDITIONS THAT ARE STANDARD IN OTHER STATES. COLORADO'S SCREENING PROGRAM AIMS TO ENSURE EVERY ONE OF THE 67,000 BABIES BORN EACH YEAR IN THE STATE RECEIVES A SCREENING FOR POTENTIALLY LIFE-THREATENING MEDICAL CONDITIONS AND HEARING PROBLEMS. HOUSE BILL 18-1006 MAKES THE NEWBORN SCREENING PROGRAM MORE COMPREHENSIVE, ENSURES TIMELINESS OF SCREENING RESULTS AND OFFERS AN ENHANCED PROGRAM FOR THE 2,000 BABIES EACH YEAR WHO FAIL THEIR HEARING SCREENING. THE SCREENING ENSURES THAT BABIES AND FAMILIES ARE SWIFTLY CONNECTED TO CARE IF THERE IS A RISK FOR A MEDICAL CONDITION OR HEARING LOSS THAT NEEDS FURTHER EVALUATION. CLINICIANS AT CHILDRENS HOSPITAL COLORADO, INCLUDING PULMONOLOGISTS, APPROACHED OUR GOVERNMENT AFFAIRS TEAM WITH CONCERNS ABOUT THESE GAPS. WITH HELP FROM COMMUNITY PARTNERS, WE ADVOCATED TO MODERNIZE COLORADOS NEWBORN SCREENING PROGRAM BY EXPANDING TESTING TO COVER NEW DISEASES, IMPROVING THE FOLLOW-UP PROCESS FOR BABIES NEEDING ADDITIONAL TESTING, AND ENSURING ADEQUATE PROGRAM RESOURCES. PULMONARY FACULTY MEMBERS PROVIDED GUIDANCE ON BILL DEVELOPMENT AND TESTIMONY AT THE COLORADO LEGISLATURE. THIS BILL WAS SIGNED INTO LAW ON JUNE 8, 2018. FOOD INSECURITY: DURING THE 2018 STATE LEGISLATIVE SESSION, WE JOINED A COALITION OF ANTI-HUNGER ORGANIZATIONS TO SUPPORT SENATE BILL 13, WHICH EXPANDS THE STATE COVERAGE FOR FREE LUNCHES THROUGH THE NATIONAL SCHOoL LUNCH PROGRAM FOR MIDDLE SCHOOL STUDENTS. SB13 PASSED BOTH HOUSES OF THE LEGISLATURE AND WAS SIGNED INTO LAW. WE ALSO COLLABORATED WITH PARTNERS INVOLVED IN THE COLORADO BLUEPRINT TO END HUNGER INITIATIVE TO PASS A COLORADO STATE BOARD OF HUMAN SERVICES RULE CHANGE. ONE OF OUR PEDIATRICIANS TESTIFIED BEFORE THE STATE HUMAN SERVICES BOARD IN SUPPORT OF THE CHANGE TO INCREASE THE SNAP INCOME ELIGIBILITY THRESHOLD FOR ALL COLORADOANS TO 200% OF THE FEDERAL POLICY LEVEL. THIS CHANGE PROTECTS CHILDREN AND LOW-INCOME FAMILIES FROM LOSING SNAP BENEFITS BY BEING SLIGHTLY OVER THE PREVIOUS ELIGIBILITY THRESHOLD, WITH EXPANDED ACCESS TO THESE CRITICAL BENEFITS FOR OUR FAMILIES. ADDITONALLY, THROUGH OUR GRASSROOTS ADVOCACY NETWORK, CHILD HEALTH CHAMPIONS, WE HARNESS THE POWER OF OUR MEMBERS ACROSS COLORADO TO PUSH FOR BETTER CHILD HEALTH THROUGH PUBLIC POLICY. THIS LEGISLATIVE SESSION, WE ADDED 707 NEW MEMBERS TO THE NETWORK, INCREASING OUR TOTAL NUMBER OF ADVOCATES TO OVER 7,000. MORE THAN 1,200 OF THESE ADVOCATES WROTE EMAILS TO THEIR LAWMAKERS ON POLICY ISSUES THAT IMPACT KIDS AND FAMILIES. WE ALSO CO-HOSTED THE SEVENTH ANNUAL SPEAK UP FOR KIDS DAY AT THE CAPITOL, TRAINING 190 NEW ADVOCATES FROM ACROSS THE STATE AT AN INTENSIVE, INSPIRING AND HANDS-ON EVENT THAT CONNECTS THEM WITH THEIR LOCAL LEGISLATORS TO HAVE CONVERSATIONS ABOUT PENDING KIDS HEALTH LEGISLATION. PARTNERSHIPS ARE AN ESSENTIAL COMPONENT TO CHILDRENS COMMUNITY HEALTH WORK. THE HOSPITAL HAS PARTNERED WITH AN ARRAY OF LOCAL, STATE AND NATIONAL ORGANIZATIONS TO COORDINATE, COLLABORATE AND SHARE KEY FINDINGS AND LESSONS LEARNED IN IMPROVING HEALTH AND QUALITY OF LIFE FOR CHILDREN IN COLORADO. BELOW ARE A FEW EXAMPLES OF CHILDRENS COLLABORATIONS ADDRESSING COMMUNITY BUILDING AND HEALTH IMPROVEMENT. COALITION BUILDING. IN 2016, CHILDRENS HOSPITAL COLORADO JOINED FORCES WITH EIGHT OTHER STATEWIDE HEALTH AND EDUCATION ORGANIZATIONS TO FORM THE COLORADO ALLIANCE FOR SCHOOL HEALTH (THE ""ALLIANCE""). THE ALLIANCE AIMS TO TRANSFORM HOW HEALTH CARE AND EDUCATION PARTNERS COLLABORATE TO CREATE SUSTAINABLE SYSTEMS THAT RESULT IN HEALTH EQUITY AMONG ALL COLORADO STUDENTS. OVER THE PAST YEAR, THE ALLIANCE IDENTIFIED ADVOCACY PRIORITIES THAT INCLUDE FUNDING FOR SCHOOL HEALTH SERVICES, ACCESS TO INTEGRATED CARE FOR STUDENTS AND FAMILIES, AND EFFORTS TO DEVELOP A COMMON, COMPREHENSIVE, APPROACH TO SHARING DATA ACROSS SYSTEMS TO INFORM PLANNING, DOCUMENT PROGRESS, AND ULTIMATELY IMPROVE THE HEALTH, DEVELOPMENT, LEARNING, AND SUCCESS OF CHILDREN AND THEIR SCHOOL COMMUNITIES. IN 2018, THE ALLIANCE ESTABLISHED THEIR ADVOCACY AGENDA, PUBLISHING A CALL TO ACTION IN EARLY 2019; ITS INTENT IS TO DEFINE SCHOOL HEALTH SERVICES, ELEVATE THE IMPORTANCE OF THESE SERVICES, OUTLINE OPPORTUNITIES FOR HEALTH AND EDUCATION TO WORK TOGETHER TO MEET THE HEALTHCARE NEEDS OF EVERY STUDENT AND IDENTIFY ACTIONS WE CAN TAKE RIGHT NOW TO IMPROVE THE HEALTH OF ALL COLORADO STUDENTS. PHYSICAL IMPROVEMENTS AND HOUSING. AT CHILDRENS COLORADO, WE SERVE A DIVERSE PATIENT POPULATION WHOSE EXPERIENCES WITH SOCIAL DETERMINANTS OF HEALTH VARY GREATLY. TO BETTER UNDERSTAND THESE EXPERIENCES, WE HAVE BEGUN SYSTEMATICALLY SCREENING PATIENTS FOR BARRIERS TO WELLNESS AND UTILIZING PATIENT NAVIGATORS TO HELP FAMILIES ADDRESS THESE BARRIERS. OUR PSYCHOSOCIAL SCREENING PROGRAM WAS PILOTED IN OUR CHILD HEALTH CLINIC, A PRIMARY CARE CLINIC FOR CHILDREN FROM BIRTH TO ADOLESCENCE, AND HAS BEEN EXPANDED TO ADDITIONAL CLINICAL AREAS, INCLUDING SPECIFIC INPATIENT UNITS AND OUR PRIMARY CARE CLINIC FOR CHILDREN WITH COMPLEX HEALTHCARE NEEDS. IN 2018, 14,878 SCREENINGS OCCURRED WITH 8,548 UNIQUE PATIENTS. HOUSING WAS THE SIXTH MOST FREQUENTLY REPORTED CONCERN, WITH 10.5% OF PATIENTS SCREENED BEING REFERRED TO A NAVIGATOR FOR ASSISTANCE WITH HOUSING. AS A NON-PROFIT HOSPITAL, WE COMPLETE A FORMAL COMMUNITY HEALTH NEEDS ASSESSMENT EVERY THREE YEARS TO ENSURE THAT OUR PATIENTS, FAMILIES, AND COMMUNITY PARTNERS ARE ABLE TO GUIDE OUR POPULATION HEALTH EFFORTS. OUR MOST RECENT NEEDS ASSESSMENT WAS COMPLETED IN DECEMBER 2018 AND INCLUDED INPUT FROM MORE THAN 40 PARTNER ORGANIZATIONS AND NEARLY 600 COMMUNITY MEMBERS. IN THIS PROCESS, STAKEHOLDERS WERE ASKED TO PRIORITIZE THE MOST ""CRITICAL HEALTH NEEDS""OTHER CRITICAL NEEDS"" IN THEIR COMMUNITY. HOUSING, IDENTIFIED AS AN ""OTHER CRITICAL NEED"" BECAUSE IT IS NOT CONDITION-SPECIFIC, WAS RATED AS THE SIXTH MOST IMPORTANT NEED IN THE COMMUNITIES CHILDREN'S COLORADO SERVES. WE HAVE ALSO BEEN APPROACHED BY SEVERAL ADVOCACY PARTNERS ON HOUSING-RELATED MEASURES AT THE STATE AND FEDERAL LEVELS, INCLUDING EFFORTS TO IMPROVE TENANT RIGHTS, ESTABLISH A STATEWIDE EVICTION PREVENTION FUND, AND ASSESS THE HEALTH IMPACT OF MILITARY HOUSING. AS A RESULT OF FEEDBACK FROM COMMUNITY PARTNERS AND RESIDENTS, CHILDRENS COLORADO IS ALSO WORKING WITH THE UNIVERSITY OF COLORADO DENVER TO CONDUCT AN ENVIRONMENTAL NEEDS ASSESSMENT OF LIVING CONDITIONS IN THE COMMUNITY IMMEDIATELY SURROUNDING OUR AURORA HOSPITAL. THIS PROJECT, FUNDED BY PHILANTHROPIC DONATIONS TO CHILDRENS COLORADO, WILL PROVIDE HYPERLOCAL DATA ON HOUSING CONDITIONS AND THE RELATED HEALTH IMPACTS ON CHILDREN AND FAMILIES; OUR INTENTION IS TO PROVIDE THE RESULTS TO COMMUNITY MEMBERS TO USE IN THEIR OWN ADVOCACY AND PROGRAMMATIC EFFORTS.

IN 2018, CHCO FORMALIZED A POPULATION HEALTH STRATEGY. DELIVERING CARE TO KIDS ISN'T A ONE-SIZE-FITS-ALL MODEL. CONSIDERING THEIR DIFFERENT BARRIERS TO WELLNESS IS NECESSARY TO CHANGE THE WAY WE DELIVER HEALTHCARE, AND EMPOWERING COMMUNITIES TO FOCUS ON PREVENTION IS KEY.

SCHOOL HEALTH: AIMING TO INCREASE ACCESS OF TYPE 1 DIABETES-SPECIFIC PROFESSIONAL DEVELOPMENT OPPORTUNITIES FOR COLORADO SCHOOL NURSES, WHILE ALSO BUILDING PROFESSIONAL NETWORKS, THE SCHOOL HEALTH PROGRAM AT CHILDREN'S HOSPITAL COLORADO (CHCO) PARTNERED WITH EXTENSION FOR COMMUNITY HEALTH OUTCOMES (ECHO) COLORADO TO ENVISION, DESIGN, AND EVALUATE A ""SCHOOL NURSES MANAGING DIABETES CARE"" ECHO LEARNING SERIES. FIELD EXPERTS FROM THE CHCO SCHOOL HEALTH PROGRAM, BARBARA DAVIS CENTER FOR CHILDHOOD DIABETES, AND ECHO COLORADO CAME TOGETHER TO DEVELOP A MULTI-COHORT, FOUR-WEEK EDUCATIONAL ECHO SERIES, WHICH LAUNCHED IN FEBRUARY AND APRIL 2018, AND INCLUDED THE FOLLOWING CURRICULUM: 1) PATHOPHYSIOLOGY OF DIABETES; 2) INSULIN TECHNOLOGY; 3) INSULIN MANAGEMENT; AND, 4) DEVELOPMENTALLY-APPROPRIATE CARE FOR SCHOOL-AGED CHILDREN. TWENTY-NINE PARTICIPANTS ATTENDED THE FIRST DIABETES CARE ECHO LEARNING SERIES. DIFFERENT FROM WEBINAR FORMAT, ECHO SERIES ARE PROVIDED VIA A VIDEOCONFERENCING PLATFORM, WHICH CREATES AN INTERACTIVE, ENGAGING FORUM FOR THE CONSISTENT DISSEMINATION OF SCHOOL NURSING BEST PRACTICE AND EVIDENCE-BASED STANDARDS OF CARE. THIS ECHO SERIES ALLOWED SCHOOL NURSES TO OBTAIN EDUCATION FROM CONTENT MATTER EXPERTS, SHARE PEER-TO-PEER KNOWLEDGE AND EXPERTISE, COLLABORATE WITH COLLEAGUES, AND BUILD A SENSE OF COMMUNITY REGARDING THE MANAGEMENT OF DIABETES IN SCHOOLS. SCHOOL NURSES WERE RECRUITED THROUGHOUT COLORADO, INCLUDING URBAN AND RURAL SETTINGS, AND A TOTAL OF FORTY-EIGHT SCHOOL NURSES ATTENDED COHORTS 1 AND 2 OF THE SERIES. EVALUATION FINDINGS SHOWED THAT THE SERIES IS A PROMISING APPROACH TO INCREASE THE SELF-EFFICACY OF SCHOOL NURSES FOR MANAGING DIABETES CARE, REDUCE PROFESSIONAL ISOLATION, AND IMPROVE CARE OF STUDENTS. AS A RESULT OF THE IMPACTS OF THIS SERIES, THE FOLLOWING TOOK PLACE: 1) A ""SCHOOL NURSES MANAGING NEUROLOGICAL CONDITIONS"" ECHO LEARNING SERIES WAS DEVELOPED, IMPLEMENTED AND EVALUATED IN OCTOBER, 2018, WITH TWENTY-TWO SCHOOL NURSES IN ATTENDANCE; 2) A MONTHLY ECHO COMMUNITY OF PRACTICE SERIES FOR COLORADO SCHOOL NURSE LEADERS WAS DEVELOPED AND LAUNCHED IN OCTOBER, 2018; 3) TWO MORE COHORTS OF THE ""SCHOOL NURSE MANAGING DIABETES CARE"" HAVE BEEN SCHEDULED FOR 2019, AND 4) ONE MORE COHORT OF THE ""SCHOOL NURSES MANAGING NEUROLOGICAL CONDITIONS"" HAS BEEN SCHEDULED FOR 2019. AS SCHOOL NURSES CONTINUE TO SERVE AS POPULATION HEALTH LEADERS, PROVIDING HIGHLY COMPLEX COORDINATED CARE TO INCREASING NUMBERS OF CHILDREN IN EDUCATIONAL SETTINGS, THE NEED FOR ONGOING CONTINUING EDUCATION OFFERINGS IN COLLABORATIVE PEER-TO-PEER LEARNING ENVIRONMENTS IS CRITICAL TO ENSURING THEIR ABILITIES TO SUPPORT THE HEALTH OF CHILDREN IN SCHOOLS.

THE CHN WORKFORCE DIFFERS FROM THE CLINICALLY BASED FAMILY NAVIGATORS IN THAT THEY WORK WITH FAMILIES IN PRIMARY CARE CLINICS, COMMUNITY BASED-SETTINGS AND CONDUCT HOME VISITS TO ENSURE THE MAXIMUM SUPPORT TO OUR FAMILIES. CHNS PROVIDE ASSISTANCE TO PATIENTS AND FAMILIES WITH BARRIERS TO CARE AND RESOURCE NEEDS. THE RELATIONSHIP BETWEEN SOCIAL DETERMINANTS OF HEALTH AND HEALTH OUTCOMES IS WELL DOCUMENTED. ADDRESSING SOCIAL DETERMINANTS OF HEALTH IS IMPORTANT FOR IMPROVING HEALTH OUTCOMES AND REDUCING HEALTH DISPARITIES. SINCE 2016, THE TEAM HAS EXPANDED FROM 6 NAVIGATORS IN THREE UNIQUE SETTINGS TO 13 NAVIGATORS IN 9 SETTINGS. THE POPULATION SERVED IS PRIMARILY MEDICAID OR UNINSURED FAMILIES WITH A SIGNIFICANT NUMBER OF NON-ENGLISH-SPEAKING FAMILIES. IN 2018, THE TEAM PROVIDED SUPPORT TO 5,135 PATIENTS/FAMILIES. TOP NEEDS INCLUDE: FINANCIAL ASSISTANCE, PUBLIC BENEFIT ASSISTANCE, FOOD INSECURITY, HOUSING AND ASSISTANCE FINDING A PRIMARY CARE PROVIDER FOR THE CAREGIVER. THIS INITIATIVE ALSO PROVED AN OPPORTUNITY TO EXPAND OUR PARTNERSHIP WITH PUBLIC HEALTH. IN 2016, TWO NAVIGATORS WERE PLACED IN A TRI-COUNTY HEALTH DEPARTMENT WIC OFFICE. THIS FEDERAL PROGRAM PROVIDES SUPPLEMENTAL NUTRITIONAL SUPPORT FOR WOMEN, INFANTS AND CHILDREN (WIC) FOR LOW-INCOME PREGNANT, BREASTFEEDING, AND NON-BREASTFEEDING POSTPARTUM WOMEN AND TO INFANTS AND CHILDREN UP TO THE AGE OF FIVE WHO ARE AT NUTRITIONAL RISK. IN 2018, THE NAVIGATORS PROVIDED RESOURCE SUPPORT TO 590 FAMILIES AND EXPANDED TO A SECOND WIC OFFICE. ADDITIONALLY, THROUGH COMMUNITY ENGAGEMENT EFFORTS THE NAVIGATION TEAM DISCOVERED THAT MANY OF THE NON-ENGLISH SPEAKING AND REFUGEE FAMILIES DID NOT UNDERSTAND HOW TO UTILIZE THEIR FAMILIES WIC BENEFITS. THIS STARTED A NEW COMPONENT OF THE PROGRAM WHERE NAVIGATORS WILL TAKE FAMILIES TO THE GROCERY STORE 1-2 TIMES TO ASSIST THEM WITH WHAT FOODS IN WHAT QUANTITIES THEY WERE ELIGIBLE TO PURCHASE THROUGH THE WIC BENEFITS."

CHILDREN'S HOSPITAL COLORADO'S FULL TIME PATIENT FINANCIAL COUNSELORS ARE DEDICATED TO WORKING WITH FAMILIES TO PROVIDE GUIDANCE REGARDING AVAILABLE FINANCIAL ASSISTANCE WHICH ENSURES THAT ITS PATIENT POPULATION RECEIVES THE CRITICAL CARE IT NEEDS. ADDITIONALLY, CHILDREN'S HOSPITAL COLORADO PROVIDES PATIENT ASSISTANCE TO HELP IDENTIFY COMMUNITY-BASED RESOURCES, FACILITATE SERVICES AND PROVIDE APPROPRIATE REFERRAL ASSISTANCE TO HELP WITH CONTINUITY OF CARE. INPATIENT PROCESS: THIS PROCESS APPLIES TO PATIENTS WHO ARE BEING ADMITTED FOR OBSERVATION, SURGERY OR OTHER INPATIENT SERVICES. IF THE PATIENT IS PRE-SCHEDULED, CHILDREN'S HOSPITAL COLORADO PATIENT ACCESS WORKS TO CONTACT THE FAMILY PRIOR TO ADMISSION TO ARRANGE FOR A FINANCIAL SCREENING APPOINTMENT. REGARDLESS OF WHETHER AN APPOINTMENT IS SET PRIOR TO ADMISSION, THE PATIENT FINANCIAL COUNSELING TEAM WORKS WITH THE FAMILY TO DETERMINE THEIR SELF-PAY STATUS (EITHER NON-COMMERCIAL OR GOVERNMENT INSURANCE) AND SUBSEQUENTLY WORKS WITH THEM TO SCREEN FOR FINANCIAL ASSISTANCE OPTIONS. OUTPATIENT PROCESS: WHEN A PATIENT SCHEDULES A NON-EMERGENT OR URGENT OUTPATIENT CLINIC VISIT, THEY WILL IDENTIFY THEMSELVES AS SELF-PAY IF THEY DO NOT HAVE EITHER COMMERCIAL OR GOVERNMENT INSURANCE. AT THIS POINT, THEY ARE GIVEN TWO OPTIONS: (1) PAY A $200 DEPOSIT AT THE TIME OF APPOINTMENT AND BE BILLED ANY REMAINING BALANCE OR (2) SCHEDULE TIME WITH PATIENT FINANCIAL COUNSELING FOR ASSISTANCE. IF THE PATIENT WAS SEEN IN THE EMERGENCY DEPARTMENT OR URGENT CARE WITHOUT THE PRE-SCREEN, THEY STILL CAN APPLY FOR FINANCIAL ASSISTANCE WITH THE PATIENT FINANCIAL COUNSELING OFFICE. ALL SELF-PAY FAMILIES ARE AUTOMATICALLY GIVEN A 35 PERCENT DISCOUNT. CHILDREN'S HOSPITAL COLORADO HAS A FORMAL POLICY REGARDING ELIGIBILITY CRITERIA FOR CHARITY CARE. THE DECISION TO PROVIDE CHARITY CARE WILL BE, IN ALL CASES, BASED ON A REVIEW OF THE INCOME, ASSETS AND LIABILITIES OF THE FAMILY AT THE TIME OF ADMISSION TO THE HOSPITAL OR CLINIC. THE LEVELS OF CHARITY CARE AND FINANCIAL ASSISTANCE PROVIDED BY CHILDREN'S HOSPITAL COLORADO WILL BE DETERMINED BASED ON FEDERAL POVERTY GUIDELINES WHICH MAY BE ADJUSTED UP TO 200 PERCENT AND REVISED FROM TIME TO TIME. FAMILIES WITH ADJUSTED GROSS INCOME BETWEEN 200 PERCENT AND 400 PERCENT OF FEDERAL POVERTY GUIDELINES MAY ALSO BE CONSIDERED FOR CHARITY CARE WITH A CAP FOR OUT-OF-POCKET RESPONSIBILITY. DETERMINATION OF ELIGIBILITY WILL BE EFFECTIVE FOR SIX MONTHS AND APPLY TO ALL PATIENTS REGARDLESS OF IMMIGRATION STATUS.

CHCO IS COMMITTED TO IMPROVING THE HEALTH OF CHILDREN THROUGH THE PROVISION OF HIGH-QUALITY, COORDINATED PROGRAMS OF PATIENT CARE, EDUCATION, RESEARCH AND ADVOCACY. CHILDRENS HOSPITAL COLORADO WORKS TO DELIVER ON THIS MISSION NOT ONLY IN THE DENVER METRO AREA AND IN THE STATE OF COLORADO, BUT ALSO THROUGHOUT THE ROCKY MOUNTAIN REGION. THERE ARE EXTENSIVE EFFORTS LED BY CHILDRENS HOSPITAL COLORADO THAT POSITIVELY IMPACT THE HEALTH AND SAFETY OF CHILDREN IN THE COMMUNITY. THROUGHOUT 2018, THE HOSPITALS CHILD HEALTH ADVOCACY INSTITUTE AND ITS PARTNERS ENGAGED IN EXTENSIVE EFFORTS TO PROMOTE HEALTH AND PREVENT ILLNESS, IN ACCORDANCE WITH THE CHILDRENS HOSPITAL COLORADO (CHILDRENS COLORADO) 2016-2018 COMMUNITY HEALTH ACTION PLAN (CHAP). IN THE CHAP, CHILDRENS COLORADO FOCUSED ON SIX HEALTH PRIORITY AREAS THAT WERE IDENTIFIED IN THE 2015 COMMUNITY HEALTH NEEDS ASSESSMENT (CHNA) AND LED OR COLLABORATED WITH PARTNERS ON INITIATIVES WITHIN THE HOSPITAL, IN THE COMMUNITY AND ACROSS THE STATE. THESE INITIATIVES INCLUDED EDUCATION AND PUBLIC AWARENESS, TRAININGS, SCREENINGS, DIRECT SERVICES, ACCESS TO CARE, AS WELL AS POLICY AND ADVOCACY EFFORTS. ADDITIONALLY, CHILDRENS COLORADO PRIORITIZED ADDRESSING SOCIAL DETERMINANTS OF HEALTH THAT IMPACT HEALTH OUTCOMES THROUGH DEVELOPMENT OF COMMUNITY PARTNERSHIPS TO ENHANCE REFERRALS AND CONNECTIONS FOR FAMILIES, ALONG WITH CONTINUED EXPANSION OF THE WORKFORCE IN COMMUNITY HEALTH. AS PART OF OUR EFFORTS IN ADDRESSING CHNA PRIORITY AREAS, THE TEAM EPIDEMIOLOGIST CONDUCTS A COMPREHENSIVE ANNUAL EVALUATION OF THE ACTIVITIES IDENTIFIED IN THE 2016-2018 COMMUNITY HEALTH ACTION PLAN. THE EVALUATION PLAN IS AVAILABLE ON-LINE: HTTPS://WWW.CHILDRENSCOLORADO.ORG/COMMUNITY/COMMUNITY-HEALTH/COMMUNITY-HEA LTH-NEEDS-ASSESSMENT/ HIGHLIGHTS OF THIS WORK IN 2018 INCLUDE: MENTAL HEALTH: MENTAL HEALTH IS A TOP CONCERN FOR YOUTH AND FAMILIES, AS IDENTIFIED IN THE CHILDRENS COLORADO COMMUNITY HEALTH NEEDS ASSESSMENT, AS WELL AS ASSESSMENTS CONDUCTED BY NUMEROUS OTHER HOSPITALS, LOCAL PUBLIC HEALTH DEPARTMENTS AND COMMUNITY-BASED ORGANIZATIONS. IN LOOKING FOR WAYS TO ADDRESS MENTAL HEALTH EDUCATION AND DE-STIGMATIZATION, THE CHILDRENS COLORADO PEDIATRIC MENTAL HEALTH INSTITUTE, REVIEWED EXISTING PROGRAMS TARGETING STIGMA REDUCTION AMONG YOUTH AND TURNED TO THE WORK OF OUR MENTAL HEALTH YOUTH ACTION BOARD (YAB). THE YAB WAS CREATED IN 2013 TO GENERATE SOCIAL ACTION AROUND MENTAL HEALTH. EACH YEAR A GROUP OF 15 TEENS FROM ACROSS THE DENVER METRO AREA CREATE AN ARTS-BASED PROJECT TO SHARE WITH THE COMMUNITY TO HELP INCREASE CONVERSATIONS REGARDING THE SPECTRUM OF MENTAL AND EMOTIONAL EXPERIENCES. TWO OF THE YABS GOALS DIRECTLY ADDRESS CHILDRENS COLORADO DESIRE TO SERVE THE COMMUNITY IN THESE WAYS: 1. RAISE AWARENESS OF CHILD AND ADOLESCENT MENTAL HEALTH ISSUES IN THE COMMUNITIES WE SERVE BY CREATING A PROJECT EACH YEAR THAT WILL SUPPORT SOCIAL CHANGE, 2. DEVELOP THE LEADERSHIP AND ADVOCACY SKILLS OF OUR YOUTH. IN 2018, THE TEAM TRANSFORMED THE YAB PROJECTS INTO A TOOLKIT THAT CAN BE USED WITH GROUPS OF YOUTH IN THE COMMUNITY BY TEACHERS, YOUTH PROGRAM LEADERS AND OTHER YOUTH SERVING PROFESSIONALS. THE TOOLKIT WAS COMPLETED IN APRIL 2018, WITH OVER 1000 COPIES DISTRIBUTED TO SCHOOLS AND COMMUNITY-BASED ORGANIZATIONS. PHYSICAL ACTIVITY, NUTRITION AND OBESITY: IN 2018, 72 CHILDREN WERE ENROLLED IN CAMP CHAMPIONS, A CAMP PROGRAM FOR LOW-INCOME, UNDERSERVED YOUTH WHO ARE OVERWEIGHT OR OBESE. CAMP CHAMPIONS AIMS TO IMPROVE HEALTHY LIFESTYLES THROUGH EDUCATION AND ACTIVITIES, DURING WHICH CAMPERS INCREASED THEIR DAILY VIGOROUS PHYSICAL ACTIVITY BY AN AVERAGE OF 27 MINUTES AND INCREASED THEIR DAILY STEP COUNT EXCEEDING RECOMMENDATIONS BY AN AVERAGE OF 3,000 STEPS. ORAL HEALTH: IN PARTNERSHIP WITH AURORA PUBLIC SCHOOLS (APS), CHILDRENS COLORADO WORKED TO ADVANCE THE ORAL HEALTH OF CHILDREN IN THE COMMUNITY THROUGH EDUCATION, SCREENING, AND PREVENTIVE SERVICES. IN 2018, 501 CHILDREN UNDER THE AGE OF 5 ENROLLED IN APS EARLY CHILDHOOD EDUCATION SITES PARTICIPATED IN A LEARNING ACTIVITY ABOUT ORAL HEALTH, AND 216 CHILDREN WERE SCREENED FOR ORAL HEALTH NEEDS AND RECEIVED FLUORIDE VARNISH. ADDITIONALLY, PARENTS OF YOUNG CHILDREN, INCLUDING 24 TEEN PARENTS, WERE ALSO ENGAGED IN EDUCATIONAL SESSIONS AND PROVIDED RESOURCES RELATED TO ORAL HEALTH FOR BOTH THEM AND THEIR CHILD. PREMATURITY AND EARLY CHILDHOOD: IN 2016, CHILDRENS COLORADO LAUNCHED A UNIVERSAL PSYCHOSOCIAL SCREENING PROGRAM IN THE CHILD HEALTH CLINIC TO IDENTIFY FAMILIES WITH PSYCHOSOCIAL NEEDS AND PROVIDE THEM WITH APPROPRIATE LEVELS OF INTERVENTION. IN 2017, NEARLY 8,000 PSYCHOSOCIAL SCREENINGS WERE COMPLETED IN THE CHILD HEALTH CLINIC AND 68% OF FAMILIES WITH PATIENTS UNDER AGE 2 WERE SCREENED. IN 2018 THAT NUMBER CLIMBED TO ALMOST 14,000 SCREENINGS; 63% WERE AGE 2 OR YOUNGER. THROUGH THIS WORK, CHILDRENS COLORADO HAS LEARNED ABOUT THE EVOLVING PSYCHOSOCIAL AND SOCIAL DETERMINANTS OF HEALTH THAT OUR FAMILIES FACE. PEDIATRIC ASTHMA: AS A RESULT OF THE PREVIOUSLY CONDUCTED NEEDS ASSESSMENT FOCUSED ON HIGH RISK ASTHMA PATIENTS SEEN AT CHILDRENS HOSPITAL COLORADO, THE BREATHING INSTITUTE CREATED A HOME VISIT PROGRAM FOR PATIENTS WITH DIFFICULT-TO-CONTROL ASTHMA IN 2016. THE FIRST TWO YEARS WERE FOCUSED ON PROGRAM DEVELOPMENT, HIRING AND TRAINING STAFF, AND CONDUCTING QUARTERLY PDSA QUALITY IMPROVEMENT CYCLES. IN 2018, WE CONCLUDED OUR PILOT PHASE AND INCORPORATED HOME VISITS INTO OUR CLINICAL OPERATIONS AS STANDARD OF CARE FOR HIGH RISK ASTHMA PATIENTS. WE CONDUCTED 116 HOME VISITS WITH 44 PATIENTS. THESE VISITS WERE CONDUCTED BY A NURSE AND COMMUNITY HEALTH NAVIGATORS AND FOCUSED ON ASTHMA EDUCATION, BARRIER IDENTIFICATION AND PATIENT NAVIGATION, HOME ENVIRONMENTAL ASSESSMENT AND TRIGGER REMEDIATION. SUPPORT PROVIDED TO EACH FAMILY VARIES BASED ON BARRIERS IDENTIFIED BUT COMMONLY INCLUDES MEDICATION DEVICE TECHNIQUE TEACHING, HELP WITH APPLICATIONS FOR BENEFITS (E.G., MEDICAID AND WIC PAPERWORK), AND REMEDIATION SUPPLIES SUCH AS HEPA-FILTER VACUUMS, SAFE CLEANING SUPPLIES, AND PEST EXTERMINATION SERVICES. DURING THE PILOT PHASE THAT ENDED IN 2018, WE SAW A 41% REDUCTION IN READMISSIONS/EMERGENCY DEPARTMENT REVISITS FOR ASTHMA IN THE SIX MONTHS FOLLOWING PARTICIPATION IN THE HOME VISIT PROGRAM. INJURY PREVENTION: IN 2018 OUR CONTINUED COLLABORATION WITH COMMUNITY-BASED ORGANIZATIONS, AND PARTNERSHIPS WITH LOCAL AND STATE GOVERNMENT LED TO OVER 700 CHILD RESTRAINT INSPECTIONS AND NEARLY 500 CAR SEAT DISTRIBUTIONS TO LOW-INCOME FAMILIES QUALIFYING FOR FEDERAL ENTITLEMENT PROGRAMS AND RESIDING IN TARGETED NEIGHBORHOODS. THE CPS PROGRAM CONTINUED ITS PARTNERSHIP WITH THE WOMEN, INFANTS, AND CHILDREN (W.I.C.) PROGRAM AT TRI-COUNTY HEALTH DEPARTMENT, WHERE W.I.C CLIENTS IDENTIFIED IN NEED OF SAFE TRANSPORTATION FOR THEIR INFANTS, TODDLERS, AND YOUNG CHILDREN ARE ELIGIBLE TO RECEIVE A SUBSIDIZED-COST CAR SEAT. THIS PARTNERSHIP WITH LOCAL W.I.C. OFFICES REPRESENTS A UNIQUE EXAMPLE IN COLORADO WHERE A PRIVATE, NON-PROFIT HOSPITAL DEDICATES STAFF RESOURCES TO SERVE THE SAFE TRANSPORTATION NEEDS OF FAMILIES ENROLLED IN FEDERALLY-FUNDED SAFETY NET PROGRAM. THROUGH OUR ""CRIBS FOR KIDS"" INFANT SAFE SLEEP AWARENESS AND EDUCATION PROGRAM, COMMUNITY HEALTH NAVIGATORS PROVIDED EDUCATION AND ANTICIPATORY GUIDANCE TO MOTHERS RECEIVING PRIMARY CARE SERVICES AT CHILDRENS COMMUNITY HEALTH CLINICS. IN ADDITION TO HIGHLIGHTING THIS PRIORITY ISSUE WITH PARENTS, THE NAVIGATORS PROVIDED PORTABLE CRIBS TO 34 MOTHERS WHOSE INFANTS WERE IDENTIFIED AS BEING AT HIGH RISK FOR SUDDEN UNEXPLAINED INFANT DEATH (SUID). IN ADDITION TO CHILDRENS COLORADOS HEALTH PRIORITY AREAS, THERE WERE KEY MILESTONES ACHIEVED IN OUR PARTNERSHIPS, COMMUNITY HEALTH AND POLICY AND ADVOCACY EFFORTS. BELOW ARE SOME HIGHLIGHTS OF THOSE EFFORTS. PARTNERSHIP DEVELOPMENT: IN 2018, CHILDRENS COLORADO MADE A CONCERTED EFFORT TO ENHANCE PARTNERSHIPS WITH OTHER SYSTEMS AND SECTORS SERVING CHILDREN AND FAMILIES IN THE COMMUNITY TO IMPROVE COORDINATION OF EFFORTS RELATED TO OUR SHARED POPULATION, AS WELL AS IDENTIFY OPPORTUNITIES TO ENHANCE OUR COLLECTIVE IMPACT ON THE HEALTH AND WELLBEING OF CHILDREN LIVING IN OUR COMMUNITY. SHARED GOALS, INTEGRATED STAFFING MODELS, COLLABORATIVE FUNDING PROPOSALS, AND DATA/INFORMATION SHARING ARE SOME OF THE KEY COMPONENTS OF THIS WORK. CHILDRENS COLORADO INTENDS TO PILOT THESE INNOVATIVE COLLABORATIONS WITH PARTNERS IN THE COMMUNITY IMMEDIATELY SURROUNDING THE HOSPITALS MAIN CAMPUS. KEY PARTNERS INCLUDE THE LOCAL PUBLIC HEALTH DEPARTMENT, THE LOCAL PUBLIC-SCHOOL DISTRICT, CITY PARKS AND RECREATION DIVISION, AND PRIMARY CARE CLINICS SERVING MEDICAID FAMILIES. MANY OTHER COMMUNITY BASED ORGANIZATIONS WILL BE CRITICAL STAKEHOLDERS IN THIS WORK GOING FORWARD AS WELL.

202022309349302177,540506332,"Schedule H, Part V, Section B, Line 11 Addressing Needs Identified in CHNA","(Continued From Part V Section C) -Fresh Foods Rx - Fresh Foods Rx is an 8-week program providing patients with weekly health education, peer and physician support and vouchers for fresh local fruits and vegetables from the LEAP Mobile Market. The program is designed to address both social determinants of health, particularly environments and behaviors linked to healthy nutrition choices and fruit and vegetable consumption, and the clinical care needs of patients. The program works with low-income, uninsured and publicly insured adult patients living in Medically Underserved Areas who are overweight or obese and who have been diagnosed with diabetes. Community partners include: HRV, New Horizons Healthcare, LEAP for Local Food, Virginia Cooperative Extension, and YMCA of Roanoke Valley. -Pathways Community HUB - The Pathways Community HUB is a community-based care coordination system anchored by community health workers strategically located in two Carilion teaching practices in the City of Roanoke, at Carilion Community Care, at Carilion Internal Medicine Riverside 3, and at partners' clinics. The model addresses social determinants of health. Community Health Workers link clients and their families to resources and services. The program works to reduce barriers to good health for uninsured adults who regularly visit the CRMH Emergency Department and have chronic disease diagnoses. Community partners include: Bradley Free Clinic, the Rescue Mission's G. Wayne Fralin Free Clinic, Mental Health America of Roanoke Valley, New Horizons Healthcare and United Way of Roanoke Valley's HRV. -Community Grants - Carilion is committed to improving the health of the communities we serve by addressing key health priorities identified through our triennial CHNA. Carilion fulfills this commitment in many ways, one of which is through targeted grants for community health improvement programs and those affecting the social determinants of health. Carilion provides a multitude of community grants and community health sponsorships to help local charitable organizations fulfill their missions as they relate to the health and well-being of our communities. Community grant dollars are allocated across the entire Carilion Clinic service area based on requests received. During the 2019 fiscal year (2018 tax year), more than $330,000 in grants were awarded to 23 programs to improve mental and dental health access, transportation, disease prevention, literacy services, wellness programming, and to increase the availability of affordable healthy foods, medication and personal rehabilitative equipment. -Targeted Neighborhood Initiatives - CMC's community health goal is to improve health and well-being for the Roanoke Valley, especially for those individuals living in MUAs. The City of Roanoke tends to perform worse than other neighboring communities in many health and social determinant indicators. Therefore, efforts are often focused on the MUAs in the Northwest and Southeast areas of the City of Roanoke. CMC is addressing key community health needs identified in the 2018 assessment by focusing additional investment in the Southeast MUA, located adjacent to CRMH. Through greater access to clinical care and community outreach programs, creative community partnerships and focused financial and in-kind support of initiatives, CMC is improving community health in the Southeast neighborhood. Key focus areas of this health improvement project include access to services, coordination of care and wellness. -LIFT - Carilion is working with Roanoke City Public Schools and other partners to expand access to health care services and wellness opportunities for children and families and to create a community health center in the updated Fallon Park Elementary School, located in the Southeast area of the city. The first phase of work is programmatic: to address students with chronic conditions such as asthma at the school. The focus was established based on surveys of parents and school staff and through focus groups. The goal is to reduce the number of absences due to illness, decrease Emergency Department visits and hospitalizations, and improve asthma control scores. This partnership will: transform the school nursing program to utilize a more integrated, holistic and proactive approach to health; provide a pediatric, dental, and mental health clinic; make Community Health Workers available to assist families with coordination of care and social determinant of health needs and offer financial counseling for families. Community partners include Roanoke City Public Schools, Carilion Planning and Community Development, Virginia Tech Cooperative Extension, HRV, Big Brothers Big Sisters, Carilion Wellness, Carilion departments of Psychiatry, Pediatrics and Family and Community Medicine, Delta Dental, Freedom First Credit Union, and the Fralin Biomedical Research Institute at VTC. -Significant Health Priorities to be Addressed- -Health Behaviors - Needs include a culture of healthy behaviors not a priority, poor diet. Carilion Clinic continues to address health behavior-related priorities from the 2018 RVCHNA. Improving poor diets and the general health culture served as a start to making healthy behaviors more of a priority. Carilion provides a variety of free health education classes, screenings and flu immunizations in community settings. Community health education is provided by the CHO department as well as by Trauma Outreach, dieticians, Carilion Wellness, homecare, hospice and select other departments. Health and wellness education topics include general wellness, healthy eating and activity, anti-inflammatory diet, tobacco cessation, infant safe sleep, infant and child safety, wilderness medicine, emergency care in the case of gun wound, exercise for balance and confidence building for seniors, stress management, warning signs for heart attack and stroke, women's health, and other topics as requested. Health educators also lead guided walks and hikes and Carilion supports Roanoke's local Bikeshare program, organized by Ride Solutions, helping improve access to exercise and transportation. Resources committed to these programs include staff time, volunteer hours, and food and giveaway items that encourage healthy behaviors. In fiscal year 2019 (tax year 2018), the Morningside Urban Farm hosted nearly 1,000 people who attended more than 60 events including health education classes to help learn to eat healthily and grow fresh produce for their consumption. Produce grown on the farm's 31 beds yielded 26 varieties of vegetables. The produce benefitted those attending classes and events at Morningside, programs at the Presbyterian Community Center, wellness-focused workshops, and the Smith Mountain Lake Good Neighbors Program. Programs such as Fresh Foods Rx encourage healthy eating through prescription vouchers to access healthy food paired with education and coaching. In addition to community events, Carilion fosters healthy behaviors by offering classes to employees and through partnerships with other employers in the Roanoke Valley. As the largest employer in the region, efforts to engage employees and their families in healthy lifestyles impact community health overall. Carilion offers the Virgin Pulse program to employees. This program enables employees to connect personal activity trackers and include others on the platform to encourage daily healthy behaviors such as exercise, climbing stairs, and planning healthy meals. Support groups also often contribute to wellness. Support groups are offered for grief and loss counseling, cancer treatment and recovery, and attention to diabetes and other chronic conditions. A key to wellness is compliance with safety and preventive behaviors. CMC coordinates child passenger safety training and child safety seat checks to reduce injuries from car accidents. Carilion family practices also offer gun locks for free to members of the community to encourage gun safety. As part of infant safe sleep classes, Carilion provides participants with a free Pack and Play as well as a free Sleep Sack, when available. Infants born in Carilion hospitals also receive a free Sleep Sack, when available, to encourage safe sleep practices."
202022309349302177,540506332,"Schedule H, Part V, Section B, Line 11 Addressing Needs Identified in CHNA (Continued)","Carilion remains committed to addressing poor diets. Through the Local Foods Program, Carilion provides hundreds of thousands of dollars of support to improve access to healthy foods. Community grants, such as one doubling the value of Supplemental Nutrition Assistance Program (SNAP) benefits, make healthy wholesome foods more affordable and accessible in the Roanoke Valley. In addition to community grants, CMC makes a Farm Share program available to its employees and their families through payroll deduction. In one season, employees purchased 130 shares, widening the impact of nutritious fresh food and diets to include our Carilion staff. CMC also serves as a convenient pick-up site option for community members participating in the Farm Share. Carilion remains committed to the Healthier Hospital Initiative pledge and continues to work to improve quantities of healthy, local, sustainable foods purchased and served through its cafeterias. Carilion's Morningside Urban Farm brings fresh foods to the Southeast Roanoke City community and offers new opportunities for health education and incentives. -Clinical Care - Needs include access to mental health and substance use services, access to dental care, high uninsured/underinsured population, high cost of care. Issues with access to care are important to CMC when addressing community health needs. In addition to providing financial support to qualifying patients who cannot afford care, Carilion is working to improve affordable access to care and resources. To increase access to primary care and resources for adolescents, CMC partners with Roanoke City Public Schools to operate Adolescent Health Clinics in Patrick Henry High School and William Fleming High School in the City of Roanoke, plus a stand-alone clinic in downtown Roanoke. Through parent waivers signed at the start of the school year, students can visit health professionals as needed at clinics conveniently located in the schools, regardless of students' ability to pay. -Mental health and substance use services - Through a new program, #AllIn, Carilion is providing additional access to non-traditional services for mental health and substance use. A key component of #AllIn is peer support which has expanded the type of care people in the Roanoke Valley can access. Carilion trained 70 peer recovery specialists in the Roanoke Valley and hired three who provide support groups in community and clinical settings as well as support patients who come to the hospital with conditions related to mental illness or substance use. Peer recovery specialists have a unique perspective and can connect with patients through shared experiences. Carilion's Opioid Task Force brings together expertise from throughout the Carilion system to better understand and address the opioid epidemic in Southwest Virginia. The Opioid Task Force works to address this epidemic internally and in the community. Efforts arising from this task force include developing system-wide guidelines and a system dashboard for opioid prescriptions; developing treatment pathways for opioid addiction in specific high-risk groups; developing best practices for risk assessment, treatment and standard orders in Carilion's electronic medical record system, EPIC; developing an inventory of community resources related to prevention, treatment and recovery services for patients and community members; and providing locations for free, safe, prescription drug returns or deactivation bags. Carilion provides both financial and in-kind support for the Bradley Free Clinic Mental Health Collaborative program to increase access to psychiatric care and medication for people without health insurance in the Roanoke Valley. Carilion psychiatry residents and physicians volunteer their time and provide in-kind services through this program. Physicians and residents also provide in-kind services to individuals through the Rescue Mission's Fralin Free Clinic. -Dental care - Carilion hosts pediatric and adult dental clinics in Roanoke and operates a dental residency program. Dental residents provide in-kind dental services through the Rescue Mission's Fralin Free Clinic. Located in Southeast Roanoke, the Rescue Mission is a comprehensive crisis intervention center for men, women and children. Oral health is also prioritized through the HRV Oral Health Action Team with support provided by the DentaQuest Foundation. -High uninsured / underinsured population and high cost of care - Carilion is committed to helping improve access to affordable medical care in our communities. With expansion of Medicaid in the Commonwealth of Virginia in 2019, Carilion worked diligently to develop a plan for outreach and enrollment in Medicaid for newly eligible beneficiaries. Nearly 10,000 people enrolled in medicaid as a result of outreach efforts. Community Health Workers, managed by Healthy Roanoke Valley through the Pathways HUB, and other partners also helped clients complete insurance pathways and to pair them with appropriate services once they are enrolled. Carilion physicians regularly serve uninsured people through hours donated in-kind to the Bradley Free Clinic. Medication access for Bradley Free Clinic patients is improved through RX Partnership, which Carilion supports financially. Additionally, Individuals can access regular care and medications as well as coordinate lab services through Carilion financial assistance. - Social and Economic Factors - Needs include poverty, transportation, affordable / safe housing, educational attainment. The City of Roanoke was recently identified as a City of Opportunity by the National League of Cities. With this title comes a wealth of support and guidance as the city, with Carilion as a key partner, works to improve health outcomes for residents. The Cities of Opportunity project improves health by impacting the social determinants of health such as education opportunities, affordable, and safe housing, economic opportunities for residents, transportation, safe neighborhoods, and affordable, healthy foods. Carilion has committed to be a partner in this work as it aligns directly with the findings of the 2018 RVCHNA. The direction of the action plan will guide investments Carilion makes in the social determinants of health. In its commitment to reducing inequities of care, Carilion provides financial support for people who cannot afford insurance or health care. Carilion also makes available a Medication Assistance Program to help people gain access to affordable medication. Carilion also replenishes medication carried aboard emergency medical services vehicles. Support is also provided to a variety of not-for-profit organizations, helping to reduce the impact of poverty on health through investments in social determinants such as housing, transportation, employment, education, access to healthy foods and many other worthwhile causes. Each year, Carilion Clinic coordinates a system-wide United Way campaign through which employees can provide additional support to these causes. The Pathways HUB model employs community health workers to help people navigate the barriers to good health and find solutions to health care needs. Many of the Pathways are related to social determinants such as education, employment, transportation or affordable/safe housing. This coordination of care model will help people find ways to reduce these types of barriers to good health. One Community Health Worker received a referral about a patient who uses a wheelchair and was living in unsanitary conditions. When the Community Health Worker learned the extent of the patient's situation, he partnered with the patient's caregiver to quickly find a solution. Through outreach and assistance from an area nonprofit and a local church, they were able to find the patient a safer home and a replacement wheelchair. The Virginia Tech Carilion Health Sciences and Technology Campus in the City of Roanoke continued to spur economic growth for the region through job growth, spending at the campus, student populations and research grant funds. Growth is expected to continue through at least 2026. Community partners, including Carilion, start early outreach in schools to inspire future health care workers and to create educational pathways for all. The community, Virginia Western Community College and local universities have partnered to make it possible for local students to access affordable or free education."
202022309349302177,540506332,"Schedule H, Part V, Section B, Line 11 Addressing Needs Identified in CHNA, Continued","- Transportation - Carilion recognizes the impact that lack of reliable transportation can have on health in the community. To improve access to transportation for the purpose of accessing regular health care, Carilion provides support for the City of Roanoke's trolleys. The trolleys provide free transportation from downtown Roanoke to Carilion Roanoke Memorial Hospital and points in between, including the Riverside Center campus that is home to Virginia Tech Carilion and many Carilion clinical services. Carilion has also forged a partnership with Lyft to pilot a program assisting people with access to safe, reliable transportation to regular primary care appointments. In addition, through support of the local Bikeshare program, Carilion sponsored bike stations that provide community members with an additional transportation option that also lends itself to exercise. - Physical Environment - While physical environment did not necessarily arise as a top priority in the 2018 RVCHNA, Carilion still recognizes the impact the environment has on the health of our communities. Therefore, efforts continue to make Carilion's hospitals and other facilities more energy efficient, increase recycling and the use of recyclable or bio-degradable materials, reduce waste materials and serve local, sustainable foods to patients and in our cafeterias. - Implementation and Measurement - Carilion has invested in multiple systems to manage data and track outcomes of our community work. In fiscal year 2019 (tax year 2018), Clear Impact software helped develop hospital-specific and project-specific scorecards with appropriate outcome measures. Community health education programs and screenings contained program level outcomes assigned based on the topic. These outcomes were tracked with pre- and post-tests as well as through screening results. Community programs supported by Carilion grants were responsible for regularly reporting program outcomes. Scorecards developed contain key secondary data points which are updated anually to track impact of community health initiatives. Carilion tracked and measured impact on certain aligned indicators contributing to the Robert Wood Johnson Foundation County Health Factors Ranking and County Health Outcomes Ranking. Our goal is to improve County Health Rankings for the entire Roanoke Valley, but we understand that by the nature of County Health Rankings, improvements are relative to progress in other communities in the Commonwealth of Virginia. Another software program, REDCap, enabled internal data to be utilized at the aggregate level to display outcomes of targeted health initiatives for research teams, including through asthma interventions at Fallon Park Elementary School. Outcome results will be utilized for future planning and decision making. Healthy Roanoke Valley also developed outcomes to be measured based on the results of its planning retreat and action team tactical planning following the 2018 Roanoke Valley Community Health Needs Assessment. The strategic goals include reducing barriers to resources that address the social determinants of health, expanding access to quality care and supporting a culture of health, encouraging and supporting lifestyle behaviors tied to improved health and well-being, and supporting environmental initiatives that cultivate vibrant neighborhoods. - Priority Areas Not being Addressed and the Reasons - A community approach to determine and address priority needs as described earlier in this document was used to determine which needs cannot be immediately addressed. Needs not identified as ""priority"" were not actively addressed during this period. CMC intends to address all identified priority health issues through the aforementioned initiatives, programs and/or grants."

Carilion Medical Center educates the public about health risks and steps that can be taken to improve health. Events include regularly scheduled health screenings for blood pressure, blood glucose and cholesterol as well as seasonal screenings to detect facial damage due to exposure to the sun. Carilion Medical Center's community health education department serves as host of the local chapter of the National Safe Kids Coalition and provides education on childhood injury prevention to the community and other providers. In addition, Carilion Medical Center's Safe Kids Coalition coordinator provided free training and national certification on proper car seat installation for other health and safety providers. In efforts to increase access to healthcare, Carilion physicians dedicate hours to providing ongoing care for patients of local free clinics and Carilion offers assistance with enrollment in public health care programs such as Medicaid. Interpreter services for non-English speaking patients also makes healthcare more accessible for all community members and reduces inequity. Community benefit operations include expenses associated with tracking community health improvement activities, and the cost associated with coordinating responses to community health needs identified through the most recent Roanoke Valley Community Health Assessment.

Carilion supported the Partnership's Experience 2019, a one-day conference to develop future leaders for the Roanoke region. Carilion takes an active role in local economic development endeavors by investing in research and technology and communicating with local businesses about the region's current business climate and prospective businesses. Carilion encouraged the growth of local start-up businesses through financial support and providing mentors for cohorts for the RAMP Business Accelerator. Funding provided to the Greater Roanoke Transit Company for the Star Line Trolley provides free transportation around downtown Roanoke and serves as a critical link to the Carilion and Virginia Tech Carilion locations in Roanoke's Innovation Corridor along Jefferson Street. Line 3 - Community support - Research demonstrates the strong connection between social determinants of health such as transportation, housing and education, and the overall health and well-being of communities. Support is provided in a variety of ways for nonprofit organizations addressing barriers to good health arising from these social determinants. Carilion created a section in the Don and Barbara Smith Children's Museum to engage kids in play in a medical setting and to help them learn about good health and develop interest in health professions. Through the support of local partners, Carilion helps provide better education and opportunities for children and families as well as improved housing, better nutrition and additional resources for its neighbors in need, removing a range of obstacles to good health. In fiscal year 2019 (tax year 2018) Carilion worked with the Rescue Mission homeless shelter in support of the Back to School Blast, which provides around 1,200 area students with new backpacks containing school supplies at the start of the school year, engages Carilion physicians in providing physicals and immunizations, and provides 500 children with new athletic shoes. Time is also dedicated to helping children learn through volunteer business education offered in the classroom coordinated through Junior Achievement of Southwest Virginia. Carilion Medical Center is deeply involved with a variety of other health and social determinant-related initiatives and supports local organizations through coordination of activities and participation as volunteers and board members in addition to providing financial support. Through financial donations, Carilion helps to reduce inequity, promote community development and repair, provide for social needs of veterans and seniors, maintain important community building amenities and support events for organizations like Child Health Investment Partnership (CHIP) of Roanoke Valley. Line 4 - Environmental improvements - N/A Line 5 - Leadership development and training for community members - N/A Line 6 - Coalition building - Carilion believes in the power of collaboration and understands that community health issues must be addressed in concert with the community. To ensure lasting community impact from the health assessment and community health improvement process, Carilion participates in community health coalitions that address health, safety and social determinant needs in the Roanoke Valley. In addition, Carilion partners with multiple community and business organizations around initiatives to improve health and wellness and to impact the social determinants of health for everyone living in the Roanoke Valley. An example is Carilion's representation and participation on the Roanoke Valley Collective Response, a partnership of more than 70 cross-sector organizations working together to respond to the opioid crisis in our region. In addition, Carilion representatives participate in Roanoke Area Youth Substance Abuse Coalition (RAYSAC), a group of concerned citizens, parents, youth, teachers, police officers, business people, judges, and other caring individuals striving to prevent the use of alcohol, tobacco, and drugs by youth in the Roanoke Valley and southwest Virginia. Other coalition-building activities include coordination of and/or participation on the Safe Kids coalition, the Sexual Assault Response Team Advisory Council, VHHA's Trafficking Task Force, the Elder Justice Alliance, the Southwest Virginia Action Alliance for SAFE Babies, the Virginia Attorney General's Sexual Assault Kit Initiative, Roanoke Prevention Alliance's Resiliency Collective, the Total Action for Progress Headstart Health Services Advisory Committee and many more.

Accounts will not be placed with a collection agency prior to 120 days from the date the first billing statement is provided except when mailings are returned with no forwarding address and combining multiple accounts of varying age with those already transferred or for legal verification regarding other liabilities. Reasonable efforts will be made to identify appropriate forwarding addresses. When a Financial Assistance Application (FAA) is received during the application period (within 240 days after the date the first billing statement is provided), but after initiation of ECAs, all ECAs will be suspended. Best efforts will be made to process completed applications within 30 days of receipt of the application; financial assistance eligibility will be determined and communicated to the individual. Incomplete applications must be completed within 30 days of the initial notification of additional items required; otherwise, the application will be deemed incomplete and closed. If an individual is eligible for financial assistance, ECAs, other than the sale of debt, will be reversed and any payments related to eligible care refunded to the extent no longer owed. ECAs will be reinstated if the individual is not eligible for financial assistance or does not complete the FAA by the deadline. At least 30 days before initiating an ECA, Carilion will send the patient written notice of intended ECA(s), a plain language summary explaining financial assistance available and the process for determining eligibility, and the deadline for applying for assistance. Carilion will also attempt to call individuals at least 30 days before initiating an ECA to make them aware of the financial assistance available and how to obtain assistance with the application process. Carilion shall enter into a written contract with any collection agency to which it refers bad debt. The contract will obligate the collection agency to observe and comply with Carilion's obligations under this Policy and the Financial Assistance Policy.

Garnish an individual's wages; 5. Sell an individual's debt to another party; or 6. Report the account to credit agencies. Individual account balances greater than $5,000 are not sent to a collection agency. These are handled through the Debt Recovery Department (DRD) for verification of Financial Assistance status before further collection activity occurs. DRD will also investigate any accounts that require special handling. For example, when the billing office becomes aware that a patient is deceased, auto accident or any other unique circumstances requiring special handling, the accounts are placed with the DRD. When all collection efforts have been exhausted, all hospital accounts will be returned and closed as uncollectible. No further collection activity is taken at that time. Accounts with satisfactory payment arrangements, legal activity or accounts with pending payment will be considered active and are not returned."

202022309349302177,540506332,"Schedule H, Part VI, Line 2 Needs assessment","In addition to conducting regular Community Health Needs Assessments, Carilion closely monitors community health indicators and responds to needs as they arise. Each year, Carilion updates scorecards with refreshed County Health Rankings indicators provided by the Robert Wood Johnson Foundation. Carilion is also responsive to needs identified through clinical data and departments. Carilion's call center is available for community members to ask questions and to direct callers to community resources as issues are raised. The Planning department monitors data such as self-pay and Medicaid rates, patient origin and travel time, and age and income distributions to drive Carilion's access to care strategies. Carilion Clinic's community health improvement process was adapted from Associates in Process Improvement's Model for Improvement and the Plan-Do-Study-Act (PDSA) cycle developed by Walter Shewhart. It consists of five steps: (1) conducting the CHNA, (2) strategic planning, (3) creating the implementation strategy, (4) program implementation, and (5) evaluation. This cycle is repeated every three years. Needs are also identified through advisory boards and focus groups conducted, on occasion, in key neighborhoods or aligned with community initiatives. Through ongoing collaboration with community stakeholders, regular communication of community needs occurs and partners can respond cohesively. Carilion Clinic fosters community development in its CHNA and community health improvement processes by using the Strive Collective Impact Model for the CHAT. This evidence-based model focuses on ""the commitment of a group of important players from different sectors to a common agenda for solving a specific social problem(s)"" and has been proven to lead to large-scale changes. It focuses on relationship-building between organizations and the progress towards shared strategies. Carilion Clinic and Healthy Roanoke Valley (HRV) partnered to conduct the 2018 Roanoke Valley Community Health Needs Assessment. This process was community-driven and focused on high levels of community engagement involving health and human services leaders, stakeholders, and providers; the target populations; and the community as a whole. Healthy Roanoke Valley (HRV), operating under the auspices of United Way of Roanoke Valley, was formed in 2012 as a community response to needs identified in Carilion Clinic's triennial Roanoke Valley CHNA. HRV's mission is to mobilize community resources to improve access to care, coordinate services, and promote a culture of wellness. Using the collective impact model, the partnership includes more than 50 organizations representing cross-sector stakeholders and leaders working to implement cost-effective programs resulting in improved health outcomes."

The staff completes applications for Medicaid, Social Security, Social Security Disability and Medicare. The staff provides support services ensuring the applications are processed correctly based on federal and state policy. In addition, the Eligibility staff is trained as Certified Application Counselors and will assist patients in enrollment in the insurance exchange Marketplace.

The MSA is commonly known as the Roanoke Valley and is comprised of the independent cities of Roanoke and Salem and the counties of Botetourt, Craig, Franklin, and Roanoke. It is nestled among the Blue Ridge Mountains with the City of Roanoke at its heart. Roanoke is a destination venue rich in cultural diversity, the arts, shopping, recreational opportunities, natural beauty and services not available in more rural areas of the region. Key safety net providers in the region in addition to Carilion Clinic include New Horizons, a federally qualified health center; free clinics; local offices of the Virginia Department of Health; and other human service organizations. Despite the presence of these entities, thousands of low-income, uninsured, and underinsured residents do not have access to affordable health care services. The 2018 RVCHNA revealed distinct communities with significant differences in size and population and significant disparities both in health and in social determinants. The 2014-2018 American Community Survey (ACS) found the total population of the Roanoke MSA to be 313,291. (U.S. Census Bureau, 2014-2018 5-year American Community Survey, Table S0101 https://data.census.gov/cedsci/table?q=S0101&tid=ACSST5Y2018.S0101&hidePreview=true) The cities of Roanoke and Salem had 99,621 residents and 25,519 people respectively. The counties of Botetourt, Craig, Franklin and Roanoke had 33,222, 5,113, 56,233 and 93,583 residents respectively.

(Virginia Employment Commission Community Profiles (2020) https://virginiaworks.com/community-profiles) Median age in the MSA localities ranges from 38.7 in the City of Roanoke to 48.3 in Craig County, all above the state median of 38.1. (U.S. Census Bureau, 2014-2018 5-year American Community Survey, Table S0101 https://data.census.gov/cedsci/table?q=S0101&tid=ACSST5Y2018.S0101&hidePreview=true) The ACS finds that for most of the Roanoke MSA, a larger percentage of the population is White than in the Commonwealth of Virginia as a whole, with percentages ranging all the way up to 99.6% in Craig County.

Of the population, 6.1% are Hispanic or Latino.(U.S. Census Bureau, 2014-2018 5-year estimates, American Community Survey, Table DP05 https://data.census.gov/cedsci/table?tid=ACSDP5Y2018.DP05&hidePreview=true) The City is divided into quadrants (Northwest, Northeast, Southwest and Southeast) separated geographically by railroad tracks, the Roanoke River, and the Interstate 581. These quadrants vary greatly in the demographic and economic make-up of the residents. Specifically, two of the quadrants - the Northwest and Southeast quadrants - have federal designations as Medically Underserved Areas (MUAs) and are home to a large proportion of the low-income individuals and families in the city who may be uninsured, underinsured and/or Medicaid recipients who often face additional barriers due to cultural differences."

Nearly one million individuals receive quality care through Carilion's comprehensive network of hospitals, primary and specialty physician practices, wellness centers, and other complementary services. Carilion's roots go back more than a century when a group of dedicated citizens came together and built a hospital to meet the community's health care needs. Today, Carilion is a crucial anchor institution focusing on more than just health care; Carilion is dedicated to its mission of improving the health of the communities it serves. With an enduring commitment to the health of our region, care is advanced through clinical services, medical education, research and community health investments.

In the mid-2000s, Carilion made the strategic decision to transform from a collection of hospitals to a physician-led, integrated health care system. It was a courageous move. In every moment since, Carilion has worked to evolve further-developing a multi-specialty physician group, transforming our primary care practices into patient-centered medical homes, implementing electronic health records system-wide, creating a robust partnership with Virginia Tech, and opening a medical school and research institute. Each decision, each adaptation, has fundamentally changed the way Carilion collaborates and provides care.

CENTRAL IOWA HOSPITAL CORPORATION D/B/A UNITYPOINT HEALTH-DES MOINES CONTRIBUTES FINANCIALLY TO A WIDE VARIETY OF COMMUNITY ORGANIZATIONS THAT ADDRESS THE BROADER NEEDS OF THE COMMUNITY. THESE DONATIONS ALLOW OTHER NON-PROFIT ORGANIZATIONS TO FULFILL THEIR MISSIONS TO IMPROVE THE WELL BEING OF THE COMMUNITY AND CONTRIBUTE TO ITS OVERALL HEALTH STATUS IN WAYS THAT MAY DIFFER FROM THE DIRECT SERVICES OF THE HOSPITAL ORGANIZATION. OTHER DONATIONS SUCH AS FOOD OR OTHER DURABLE GOODS PROVIDE AREA SHELTERS AND OTHER ORGANIZATIONS IN THE AREA. THIS ALLOWS THESE ORGANIZATIONS TO MAXIMIZE THE RESOURCES THEY HAVE TO WORK WITH.

These top priorities represent the intersection of documented unmet community health needs and the organization's key strengths and mission. These priorities were identified and approved by the UMMC/Midtown CHI Team and validated with the health experts from the UMB Campus Panel and ultimately approved by the Board. Programming is based on these strategic priorities as identified in the CHNA. 1) Mental Health (in collaboration with City hospitals) 2) Substance Abuse 3) Chronic Disease Management (CVD, Diabetes, HIV) 4) Maternal/Child Health 5) Violence Prevention 6) Workforce Development The University of Maryland Medical Center has community health programming in each of the above strategic community priorities. The following is an example of key initiatives from three of the above priorities. Identified Need/Priority: Substance Abuse Prevention Identified Need: Tobacco Prevention/Cessation Currently, there is a 23% prevalence rate of tobacco use in the targeted population and much higher rates in specific neighborhoods. Hospital Initiative: Tobacco Prevention/Cessation Primary objectives of initiative: 1) Reduce the % of adults who are current smokers (Maryland SHIP) 2) Reduce the % of youths using any kind of tobacco product (high school only) 3) Increase awareness about the dangers of tobacco use Single or multi-year plan: This program is a multi-year, ongoing initiative. Key collaborators in delivery: UMMC Downtown Campus American Lung Association Baltimore City Health Dept. Fox 45 Impact of hospital initiative: Tobacco prevention education and cessation are offered in the community as well as through online and television platforms. Metrics: * # of people educated in the community Evaluation of Outcomes in FY19: * 1,864 individuals (adults and youth) educated in the community Continuation of initiative: UMMC Midtown will continue to monitor performance and outcome measures annually. This priority and the accompanying initiatives will continue until the FY18 CHNA is completed and as long as there continues to be an identified community need. Identified Need/Priority: Diabetes Prevention Identified Need: Diabetes Prevention Currently, there is a 34% prevalence rate of obesity in the targeted population and much higher rates in specific neighborhoods. Diabetes and obesity are major causes of cardiovascular disease and increases an individual's chances for developing co-morbidities and lowers life expectancy. Hospital Initiative: Diabetes Prevention - Diabetes & nutrition education Primary objectives of initiative: 1) Increase the % of adults who are at a healthy weight (Maryland SHIP) 2) Provide education and information on healthy lifestyle through engaging education on diabetes awareness, nutrition, and weight management in the community Single or multi-year plan: This program is a multi-year, ongoing initiative. Key collaborators in delivery: UMMC Downtown Campus American Diabetes Association Senior Centers throughout Baltimore City Impact of hospital initiative: Diabetes prevention education and nutrition/weight management education is offered throughout the community. Metrics: * # of adults enrolled Evaluation of Outcomes: * 214 educated on diabetes prevention (DPP) topics * 1,386 educated on general nutrition topics Continuation of initiative: UMMC Midtown will continue to monitor performance and outcome measures annually. This priority and the accompanying initiatives will continue until the FY18 CHNA is completed and as long as there continues to be an identified community need. Identified Need/Priority: HIV Prevention Identified Need: HIV Prevention Currently, there is a 10% prevalence rate in adults at high risk for HIV and/or Hep C within the targeted population Hospital Initiative: HIV Prevention Primary objectives of initiative: 1) Reduce the % of adults who are current smokers (Maryland SHIP) 2) Reduce the % of youths using any kind of tobacco product (high school only) 3) Increase awareness about the dangers of tobacco use Single or multi-year plan: This program is a multi-year, ongoing initiative. Key collaborators in delivery: UMMC Downtown Campus Institute of Human Virology Star Track Adolescent HIV Clinic, University of Maryland PREP Task Force Baltimore City Health Department University of Maryland Baltimore Community Engagement Center Impact of hospital initiative: Providing free community screenings for HIV and Hep C identifies individuals infected earlier so that they can begin treatment and improve their life expectancy. By identifying partners and others who need the PREP program, this helps to prevent the transmission of both diseases. Community education helps inform the public about the routes of transmission and helps to prevent infection. Metrics: * # of people screened in the community for HIV * # of people screened in the community for Hep C * # of positives for HIV and Hep C * # of positives referred to treatment Evaluation of Outcomes in FY19: * 621 screened for HIV * 396 screened for Hep C * 49 new HIV positives and 100% referred to treatment * 8 new Hep C positives and 100% referred to treatment Continuation of initiative: UMMC Midtown will continue to monitor performance and outcome measures annually. This priority and the accompanying initiatives will continue until the FY18 CHNA is completed and as long as there continues to be an identified community need. UMMC Midtown operates under a unique regulatory system that caps hospital revenues and provides adjustments to allow for population health improvement investments. Under Maryland's global budget revenue model, UMMC Midtown reports on a regular basis how it is investing in efforts to improve population health. UMMC Midtown provides on-going services that are fundamental to addressing the identified community health needs that demonstrate the extent to which our commitment to serve our community is integrated into our care delivery model. We have a strong focus on treating patients with chronic conditions. UMMC Midtown works to coordinate care, ensure smooth transitions and promote disease self-management strategies at every step of a patient's journey - whether at home, in the community, or within our hospital. We operate specialized clinics to enable access to routine outpatient care. Our transitional care services help patients newly diagnosed or those that have had a recent hospitalization transition safely back to the community. Transitional nurse navigators provide patients with disease education and self-management strategies, connect them to primary care providers and specialists, and help them overcome any barriers to making follow up appointments. An urgent care center to address off hours visits and low acuity emergencies is also available. Our coudamin clinic provides anticoagulation medication management, specifically managing and monitoring warfarin (Coumadin) therapy upon physician referral. It also provides patients with ongoing monitoring of their anticoagulation therapy to ensure desired outcomes and decrease adverse events. UMMC Midtown's congestive heart failure clinic provides similar disease-specific services. Additionally, our behavioral health clinic provides a community access point for those in need of outpatient mental health services. Resources are embedded throughout the hospital and in the community so that every patient receives the same level of care coordination. Care managers are embedded within our emergency department, community and hospital, and provide in-home visits as needed. Community health workers reach out to patients who are identified as being high risk for readmission or in need of critical resources. Close relationships are maintained with skilled nursing facilities and home health agencies so that transfers from the hospital to these facilities are smooth, and the highest quality of care is constantly delivered. Strong relationships exist with local emergency medical service (EMS) providers through our mobile integrated health program, which delivers effective and efficient care to patients outside of the hospital. Nurses and community health workers function outside traditional emergency response roles, with a focus on maintaining individuals' health at their homes while also providing convenient access to care in the community. Additional care partners include primary care providers, specialists, local department of health, office on aging and other community based partners."

AND CONSOLIDATED AFFILIATES (THE SYSTEM) AUDITED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS, OF WHICH MELROSEWAKEFIELD HEALTHCARE, INC. IS INCLUDED, RELATING TO CHARITY CARE AND BAD DEBT EXPENSE:2018 CHARITY CARE AND COMMUNITY BENEFIT FOOTNOTECHARITY CARE - THE SYSTEM'S COMMITMENT TO COMMUNITY SERVICE IS EVIDENCED BY SERVICES PROVIDED TO THE POOR AND BENEFITS PROVIDED TO THE PATIENTS THAT IT SERVES. THE SYSTEM PROVIDES HEALTH CARE SERVICES TO PATIENTS WHO MEET CERTAIN CRITERIA UNDER ITS CHARITY CARE POLICY. THESE PATIENTS MAY RECEIVE FULL ASSISTANCE OR MAY BE SUBJECT TO PARTIAL LIABILITY BASED ON INCOME AND FAMILY SIZE. BECAUSE THE SYSTEM DOES NOT PURSUE COLLECTION OF AMOUNTS DETERMINED TO QUALIFY AS CHARITY CARE, SUCH AMOUNTS ARE NOT REPORTED AS NET PATIENT SERVICE REVENUE.MELROSEWAKEFIELD HEALTHCARE, INC. PROVIDED CHARITY CARE, BASED ON CHARGES FORGONE AND THE ESTIMATED COST OF THE CHARITY CARE PROVIDED AMOUNTED TO $621K AND $262K, FOR THE YEAR ENDED SEPTEMBER 30, 2018, AND $1,392K AND $605K, FOR THE YEAR ENDED SEPTEMBER 30, 2017, RESPECTIVELY. THE ESTIMATED COST OF CHARITY CARE IS BASED ON THE RELATIONSHIP OF PATIENT CARE SERVICE CHARGES TO THE RELATED COSTS APPLIED TO CHARITY CARE CHARGES RECOGNIZED DURING THE YEAR ENDED SEPTEMBER 30, 2018 AND SEPTEMBER 30, 2017. PROVISION FOR UNCOLLECTIBLE ACCOUNTS - THE PROVISION FOR UNCOLLECTIBLE ACCOUNTS IN THE ACCOMPANYING CONSOLIDATED STATEMENTS OF OPERATIONS REFLECTS THE CHARGES AT ESTABLISHED RATES FOR SERVICES PROVIDED TO THOSE INDIVIDUALS WHO DO NOT QUALIFY FOR CHARITY CARE UNDER THE GUIDELINES DESCRIBED ABOVE, BUT WHO ARE OTHERWISE UNABLE OR UNWILLING TO PAY THE SYSTEM. THE PROVISION FOR UNCOLLECTIBLE ACCOUNTS OF APPROXIMATELY $9,368K AND $9,570K, RESPECTIVELY, FOR THE YEAR ENDED SEPTEMBER 30, 2018, AND SEPTEMBER 30, 2017 REPRESENTS CHARGES FOR SERVICES PROVIDED THAT ARE DEEMED TO BE UNCOLLECTIBLE. THE ESTIMATED COST OF PROVIDING THESE SERVICES WAS APPROXIMATELY $3,948K AND $4,164K, RESPECTIVELY, FOR THE YEAR ENDED SEPTEMBER 30, 2018, AND SEPTEMBER 30, 2017. SUCH COSTS HAVE BEEN ESTIMATED BASED ON RATIOS OF EXPENSES TO ESTABLISHED PATIENT SERVICE CHARGES.ACCOUNTS RECEIVABLE ARE REDUCED BY AN ALLOWANCE FOR UNCOLLECTIBLE ACCOUNTS. IN EVALUATING THE COLLECTIBILITY OF ACCOUNTS RECEIVABLE, THE SYSTEM ANALYZES ITS PAST HISTORY AND IDENTIFIES TRENDS FOR EACH OF ITS MAJOR PAYOR SOURCES OF REVENUE TO ESTIMATE THE APPROPRIATE PROVISION FOR UNCOLLECTIBLE ACCOUNTS. MANAGEMENT REGULARLY REVIEWS DATA ABOUT THESE MAJOR PAYOR SOURCES OF REVENUE IN EVALUATING THE SUFFICIENCY OF THE ALLOWANCE FOR UNCOLLECTIBLE ACCOUNTS. FOR RECEIVABLES ASSOCIATED WITH SERVICES PROVIDED TO PATIENTS WHO HAVE THIRD-PARTY COVERAGE, THE SYSTEM ANALYZES CONTRACTUALLY DUE AMOUNTS AND HISTORIC PAYMENT TRENDS AND RECORDS ESTIMATED CONTRACTUAL ALLOWANCES. THE SYSTEM RECORDS A SIGNIFICANT PROVISION FOR UNCOLLECTIBLE ACCOUNTS IN THE PERIOD OF SERVICE ON THE BASIS OF ITS PAST EXPERIENCE, WHICH INDICATES THAT MANY PATIENTS ARE UNABLE OR UNWILLING TO PAY THE PORTION OF THEIR BILLS FOR WHICH THEY ARE FINANCIALLY RESPONSIBLE. THE DIFFERENCE BETWEEN THE STANDARD RATES AND THE AMOUNTS ACTUALLY COLLECTED AFTER ALL REASONABLE COLLECTION EFFORTS HAVE BEEN EXHAUSTED IS CHARGED OFF AGAINST THE ALLOWANCE FOR UNCOLLECTIBLE ACCOUNTS.MELROSEWAKEFIELD HEALTHCARE, INC.'S ALLOWANCE FOR UNCOLLECTIBLE ACCOUNTS FOR ALL PATIENTS INCREASED FROM 26% OF ACCOUNTS RECEIVABLE AS OF SEPTEMBER 30, 2017 TO 30% OF ACCOUNTS RECEIVABLE AS OF SEPTEMBER 30, 2018. IN ADDITION, THE MWHC'S WRITE-OFFS, NET OF RECOVERIES, WERE $7,511K AND $6,900K, RESPECTIVELY, FOR THE YEAR ENDED SEPTEMBER 30, 2018, AND SEPTEMBER 30, 2017. THE CHANGES WERE A RESULT OF MANAGEMENT'S REVIEW OF HISTORICAL TRENDS IN UNCOLLECTIBLE ACCOUNTS AND DETERMINATION OF RESERVES, INCLUDING THE IMPACT OF THE PROVISIONS OF THE PATIENT PROTECTION AND AFFORDABLE CARE ACT.THE SYSTEM HAS NOT CHANGED ITS CHARITY CARE OR UNINSURED DISCOUNT POLICIES DURING 2018. THE SYSTEM DOES NOT MAINTAIN A MATERIAL ALLOWANCE FOR UNCOLLECTIBLE ACCOUNTS FROM THIRD-PARTY PAYORS, NOR DID IT HAVE SIGNIFICANT BAD DEBT WRITE-OFFS FROM THIRD-PARTY PAYORS.HEALTH SAFETY NET (HSN) - THE COMMONWEALTH OF MASSACHUSETTS (THE ""COMMONWEALTH"") OPERATES THE HSN, WHICH WAS CREATED BY THE COMMONWEALTH'S HEALTH CARE REFORM ACT TO REPLACE THE STATE'S UNCOMPENSATED CARE POOL. THE HSN ALLOCATES THE COST OF UNCOMPENSATED CARE AMONG THE HOSPITALS IN THE COMMONWEALTH. HOSPITALS HAVE BEEN ASSESSED A UNIFORM ALLOWANCE BASED ON ESTIMATES OF THE STATEWIDE COST OF UNCOMPENSATED CARE AND REIMBURSED FOR A PORTION OF THE COST OF UNCOMPENSATED CARE, SUBJECT TO CERTAIN LIMITATIONS. REIMBURSABLE UNCOMPENSATED CARE INCLUDES NET CHARITY CARE AND CERTAIN UNCOLLECTIBLE ACCOUNTS RELATED TO EMERGENCY SERVICES. HOSPITALS' RECOVERIES FROM THE HSN ARE BASED ON A CLAIMS-BASED PAYMENT METHOD THAT USES MEDICARE PRINCIPLES. REIMBURSEMENT FROM THE HSN FOR UNCOMPENSATED CARE IS RECORDED IN NET PATIENT SERVICE REVENUE IN THE CONSOLIDATED STATEMENT OF OPERATIONS. THE COMMONWEALTH HAS DETERMINED FINAL SETTLEMENTS WITH RESPECT TO THE HSN FOR ALL YEARS PRIOR TO 2014.COMMUNITY BENEFIT - IN FURTHERING ITS CHARITABLE PURPOSE, THE SYSTEM PROVIDES A WIDE VARIETY OF HEALTH CARE SERVICES TO THE COMMUNITY IN ORDER TO PROVIDE ACCESS TO APPROPRIATE CARE FOR POPULATIONS IN NEED. THE SYSTEM HAS DEVELOPED A FORMAL COMMUNITY BENEFIT PLAN THAT RESPONDS TO THE COMPREHENSIVE ASSESSMENT OF HEALTH CARE NEEDS IN THE COMMUNITY. THE COMMUNITY BENEFIT PLAN SUPPORTS SERVICES THAT TARGET NOT ONLY THE GENERAL POPULATION IN THE SYSTEM'S SERVICE AREA, BUT ALSO PARTICULAR POPULATIONS WITH SPECIAL HEALTH CARE NEEDS, INCLUDING THE POOR, ELDERLY, CHILDREN, AND MINORITY POPULATIONS. SUPPORTED SERVICES INCLUDE VARIOUS CLINICS, HEALTH SCREENING PROGRAMS, HEALTH EDUCATION PROGRAMS, AND SUPPORT GROUPS OPERATED IN THE SYSTEM'S SERVICE AREA. THE SYSTEM WORKS ACTIVELY WITH OTHER AREA SERVICE PROVIDERS TO FACILITATE THE DEVELOPMENT OF AN EFFECTIVE COMMUNITY HEALTH NETWORK. THE SYSTEM ALSO PARTICIPATES IN ACTIVITIES DESIGNED TO FOSTER AND ENHANCE THE ECONOMIC AND CIVIC ENVIRONMENT OF ITS SERVICE AREAS.TOTAL MELROSEWAKEFIELD HEALTHCARE, INC. UNCOMPENSATED CARE FOR THE YEARS ENDED SEPTEMBER 30, 2018 AND 2017, WAS AS FOLLOWS: PROVISION FOR CHARITY CARE (AT COST)$262,000 (2018) ; $616,091 (2017)PROVISIONS FOR BAD DEBTS (AT COST)$3,948,000 (2018) ; $4,003,662 (2017)HSN (ASSESSMENTS NET OF REIMBURSEMENT)$1,365,000 (2018) ; $1,958,499 (2017)TOTAL UNCOMPENSATED CARE$5,575,000 (2018) ; $6,578,252 (2017)"

FROM THE FOURTH QUARTER OF FISCAL 2017 AND INTO THE FIRST QUARTER OF FISCAL 2018, IT BECAME APPARENT THAT DUE TO SIGNIFICANT FINANCIAL CHALLENGES FACING THE ORGANIZATION, THE COMMUNITY BENEFITS EXPECTED TO BE DELIVERED TO THE COMMUNITY WOULD NEED TO BE REDUCED. IN FISCAL 2018, THE CHIP WAS AMENDED TO REFLECT THE CHANGES. THE CHANGES ARE POSTED ON THE HEALTH SYSTEMS' WEBSITE.ONGOING MONITORING OF THE CHNA AND ITS IDENTIFIED HEALTH PRIORITIES IS THE RESPONSIBILITY OF THE COMMUNITY BENEFITS ADVISORY COUNCIL (CBAC).

THE CBAC PROVIDES OVERSIGHT FOR THE CHNA, AND DEFINES THE PROCESS FOR RECOGNIZING CURRENT AND EMERGING HEALTH NEEDS IN THE COMMUNITY, AS WELL AS DEVELOPING A MULTI-YEAR COMMUNITY HEALTH IMPLEMENTATION/IMPROVEMENT PLAN (CHIP) TO RESPOND TO THESE NEEDS. THE CBAC MEETS SIX TIMES PER YEAR TO ENSURE COMPLIANCE WITH THE CHIP, REVIEW PROGRAM OUTCOMES, DISCUSS IMPORTANT COMMUNITY HEALTH ISSUES, AND OFFER RECOMMENDATIONS TO THE BOARD OF TRUSTEES RELATED TO COMMUNITY HEALTH NEEDS AND DISPARITIES. THE COUNCIL IS ALSO AVAILABLE ON-LINE TO ADDRESS ANY ISSUES THAT MIGHT ARISE BETWEEN SCHEDULED MEETING TIMES. THE CBAC APPROVES ANY AND ALL AMENDMENTS TO THE CHIP RESULTING FROM EMERGING HEALTH ISSUES OR UNPLANNED CHANGES IN CAPACITY. IT ALSO ENGAGES NEW MEMBERS FROM THE COMMUNITIES SERVED TO JOIN THE GROUP, PRIORITIZING CANDIDATES WHO CAN ASSIST THE CBAC AND MWHC TO BETTER UNDERSTAND COMMUNITY HEALTH NEEDS AND BARRIERS TO ACCESS.

Training materials were revised, new scripting was developed, and training sessions were held for applicable Revenue Cycle employees which required competency sign-off for those who completed the training. Procedures initially implemented included offering a copy of the plain language summary (PLS) to patients as part of the intake process. Individuals were notified about the Financial Assistance Policy (FAP) by receiving a conspicuous written notice about the FAP on their billing statements, and via conspicuous public displays or other measures reasonably calculated to attract patients' attention. As a result of an annual internal review, it was determined that the PLS of Bon Secours Mercy Health's Healthcare FAP was not being offered to all patients at intake during 2018. Immediately upon recognition of the minor oversight, Bon Secours Mercy Health began taking steps to offer a copy of the PLS to all patients who visit the hospital facilities by adding scripting to notify patients of the availability of financial assistance and offering a copy of the PLS to the patient intake process. In addition, Bon Secours Mercy Health added new language to the Consent for Treatment, Payment, and Health Care Operations (Consent) form required to be signed by all patients, including a copy of the PLS attached as an addendum to the Consent to certify that the patient is aware of Bon Secours Mercy Health's FAP and a copy of the PLS was offered. Additional training has also been provided to all applicable staff. Bon Secours Mercy Health widely publicized its FAP, the FAP Application, and the PLS on the organization's website, includes a conspicuous written notice about the FAP on patients' billing statements, posts conspicuous public displays in the Emergency Department and Registration areas of the hospitals, and notifies members of the community about availability of the FAP. Bon Secours Mercy Health will continue to perform an internal audit on a regular and continuous basis at least once per year to ensure compliance. We do not believe the minor oversight to be considered ""willful or egregious"" and Bon Secours Mercy Health has performed internal research to identify how the minor oversight occurred and taken additional steps to ensure compliance going forward."

Fifty years later, St. Mary's has grown into an acute care facility licensed for 391 beds. St. Mary's has over 3,000 full and part-time employees and more than 1,000 associated physicians. The St. Mary's Hospital serves residents primarily from the counties of Chesterfield, Goochland, Hanover, Henrico, and Richmond City. While its core is based in the Richmond metropolitan area, its services reach into the surrounding rural counties. Bon Secours Richmond Health System serves the larger Richmond, Virginia metropolitan area and includes four hospital facilities whose service areas largely overlap. While the hospitals serve patients from many cities and counties, the majority of patients fall within the counties of Chesterfield, Henrico, Hanover and the City of Richmond totaling over 1 million residents. For the purpose of this CHNA, we refer to these as the ""Richmond Core Service Area."" The Richmond Core Service Area is primarily Caucasian and African American. When the demographics of the City of Richmond are viewed alone, we find a much lower percentage of Caucasians and a much higher percentage of African Americans than the community overall. The population age distribution for the Richmond Core Service Area is similar to Virginia overall with the exception of the City of Richmond, which has a higher percentage of 19-64 year olds (69%) and lower percentages of children (18%) and older adults (13%). Median household incomes in the United States are less than those found in Virginia overall. The Richmond Core Service Area counties of Henrico, Hanover and Chesterfield all have higher median household incomes than the U.S. overall.

The System was organized in June 1983 to fulfill the healthcare mission of the United States Province of the Congregation of the Sisters of Bon Secours of Paris, a congregation of religious women of the Roman Catholic Church founded in France in 1824. The System's activities are in the states of New York, Pennsylvania, Maryland, Virginia, Kentucky, Ohio, South Carolina, and Florida, each referred to as a local system. The Ministry of BSMH aids those in need, particularly those who are sick and dying, by offering services that include but are not limited to acute inpatient, outpatient, pastoral, palliative, home health, nursing home, rehabilitative, primary and secondary care and assisted living without regard to race, religion, color, gender, age, marital status, national origin, sexual orientation, or disability. As a member of the Catholic health ministry and a member of BSMH, this organization and its related entities are called to continue the healing ministry of Jesus. We exist to benefit the people living in the communities it serves. Through all of the services offered to the community, the mission is ""to bring compassion to health care and to be good help to those in need, especially those who are poor and dying. As a System of caregivers, we commit ourselves to help bring people and communities to health and wholeness as part of the healing ministry of Jesus Christ and the Catholic Church."" This organization and related organizations share the BSMH Vision. BSMH's vision to partner with communities to create a more humane world, build social justice for all and provide exceptional value for those served is implemented through its Strategic Quality Plan which provides focus in four goal areas for the current three year period (2016-2018). - Co-Create Healthy Communities: We recognize that the factors which drive health outcomes extend well beyond the scope of traditional health care services. Thus, we commit to improve the health of communities through partnership and collaboration with a broad range of constituencies including committed community residents - Be Person Centric: We recognize that those whom we serve are increasingly engaged in their own care and are seeking convenience, affordability and reliability. Thus, we commit to anticipate and respond to the changing expectations of health care consumers, and to ensure that we engage each person in an individualized plan for health with a focus on prevention and wellness. - Serve Those Who Are Vulnerable: We recognize, by our Catholic identity, that the struggle for a more humane world is not an option, but an integral part of spreading the gospel. Thus, we commit to serve those who are vulnerable in many ways, addressing health disparities, sustaining global ministries, healing the environment and working to end violence and oppression. - Strengthen Our Culture and Capabilities: We recognize that the health care delivery system is undergoing rapid change with increasing complexity. Thus, we commit to liberate the potential of our people by strengthening individual and collective capabilities with respect to ministry leadership, knowledge, analytics, innovation and finances. Please see Schedule R for listings of the related organizations. Each of the reported entities play a role in achieving the vision of BSMH and the SQP (Strategic Quality Plan)."

RESEARCH HAS CONTINUALLY SHOWN THAT WHEN THE FACTORS INFLUENCING HEALTH ARE EXPLORED, HEALTH CARE ACTUALLY PLAYS THE SMALLEST ROLE PROPORTIONATELY. A REPORT IN THE JOURNAL OF AMERICAN MEDICAL ASSOCIATION AND THE CENTER FOR DISEASE CONTROL (MCGINNIS, 1996) SUGGESTS THAT THE FACTORS IMPACTING HEALTH ARE AS FOLLOWS: LIFESTYLE AND BEHAVIORS, 50%, ENVIRONMENT (HUMAN AND NATURAL), 20%, GENETICS AND HUMAN BIOLOGY, 20%, AND HEALTH CARE, 10%. COMMUNITY BUILDING ACTIVITIES HELP TO ADDRESS THE OTHER INDICATORS OUTSIDE OF THE ROLE TRADITIONALLY PLAYED BY HEALTH-CARE ORGANIZATIONS. THESE ACTIVITIES ARE ALMOST EXCLUSIVELY DONE IN SOME FORM OF PARTNERSHIP IN WHICH THE COMMUNITY OR OTHER ORGANIZATIONS ARE BETTER SUITED TO ADDRESS. HEALTH-CARE ORGANIZATIONS GENERALLY PROVIDE TIMELY AND SPECIFIC RESOURCES TO HELP THESE ISSUES. HEALTH-CARE ORGANIZATIONS CAN BE A RICH AND VALUABLE COMMUNITY RESOURCE IN WAYS NOT TYPICALLY CONSIDERED. OFTEN THE MOST EFFECTIVE WAY TO HELP IMPACT AND IMPROVE THE COMMUNITY HEALTH STATUS IS TO SUPPORT OTHER AGENCIES AND ORGANIZATIONS IN A VARIETY OF WAYS OUTSIDE OF HEALTH SERVICES.

OUR ORGANIZATION'S MISSION IS TO ""IMPROVE THE HEALTH OF THE PEOPLE AND COMMUNITIES WE SERVE, AND WE HAVE BEEN INTENTIONAL ABOUT THE TYPES OF ACTIVITIES AND ORGANIZATIONS WE SPONSOR. THE MAJORITY OF SPONSORSHIPS WE PROVIDE TO THE COMMUNITY ARE DIRECTLY ALIGNED WITH THE NEEDS IDENTIFIED IN THE COMMUNITY HEALTH NEEDS ASSESSMENT, AND THE KEY FOCUS AREAS FOR THE COMMUNITY HEALTH IMPROVEMENT PLAN. THERE HAS ALSO BEEN AN INTENTIONAL EFFORT TO GO BEYOND THE SPONSORSHIP EXCHANGE WITH ORGANIZATIONS IN ORDER TO WORK WITH THEM TO DEVELOP STRATEGIES AND PROGRAMING TO REACH THE COMMUNITY WITH HEALTH EDUCATION AND SERVICES.

THE PASTOR WAS CONCERNED ABOUT THE PREGNANT WOMEN IN HIS CONGREGATION AND THE UNFAMILIARITY WITH HAVING CHILD IN THE UNITED STATES. AS A RESULT OF THE CONCERN, FOCUS GROUPS WERE HELD TRINITY'S LABOR/DELIVERY TEAM, THE BURMESE COMMUNITY, AND AFRICAN IMMIGRANT COMMUNITY WITH ASSISTANCE FROM WORLD RELIEF. FOLLOWING THE FOCUS GROUPS, PRENATAL CLASSES WERE HELD TO HELP EASE THE STRESS OF EXPECTING MOTHERS AND ALLOW THEM TO HAVE A MORE POSITIVE EXPERIENCE. IN 2016, UNITYPOINT HEALTH - TRINITY FORMED A MILITARY ADVISORY COUNCIL TO HELP IDENTIFY COMMON CHALLENGES IMPACTING VETERANS IN THE LOCAL COMMUNITY. FROM THIS WORK WE FOUND THAT A LOT OF VETERANS IN THE COMMUNITY HAVE VERY LIMITED KNOWLEDGE AROUND THE SERVICES OFFERED TO ASSIST THEM. THE COMMITTEE DEVELOPED A RESOURCE GUIDE TO HELP CONNECT VETERANS TO RESOURCES SUCH AS HOUSING, EMPLOYMENT, STATE AND COUNTY RESOURCES, FOOD, AND MORE. THIS RESOURCE IS ACCESSIBLE TO ANYONE IN THE COMMUNITY TO USE TO ASSIST CONNECTING VETERANS TO NEEDED RESOURCES. UNITYPOINT HEALTH - TRINITY HAS ALSO PARTNERED WITH A NUMBER OF LOCAL VETERAN ORGANIZATIONS TO REACH VETERANS WITH HEALTH INFORMATION, EDUCATION AND SERVICES. WE HOSTED A NUMBER OF EVENTS TO PROVIDE FREE BLOOD PRESSURE SCREENINGS, FLU SHOTS, DIABETES SCREENINGS AND MORE. BY 2018, OUR MILITARY ADVISORY COMMITTEE WAS NOTICED BY THE DEPARTMENT OF VETERANS AFFAIRS FOR THE WORK BEING DONE IN THE LOCAL COMMUNITY.

201913189349310451,420504780,"PART II, COMMUNITY BUILDING ACTIVITIES:","COMMUNITY BUILDING ACTIVITIES ARE ESSENTIAL ROLES FOR HEALTH-CARE ORGANIZATIONS IN THAT THEY ADDRESS MANY OF THE UNDERLYING DETERMINANTS OF HEALTH. RESEARCH HAS CONTINUALLY SHOWN THAT WHEN THE FACTORS INFLUENCING HEALTH ARE EXPLORED, HEALTH CARE ACTUALLY PLAYS THE SMALLEST ROLE PROPORTIONATELY. A REPORT IN THE JOURNAL OF AMERICAN MEDICAL ASSOCIATION AND THE CENTER FOR DISEASE CONTROL (MCGINNIS, 1996) SUGGESTS THAT THE FACTORS IMPACTING HEALTH ARE AS FOLLOWS: LIFESTYLE AND BEHAVIORS, 50%, ENVIRONMENT (HUMAN AND NATURAL), 20%, GENETICS AND HUMAN BIOLOGY, 20%, AND HEALTH CARE, 10%. COMMUNITY BUILDING ACTIVITIES HELP TO ADDRESS THE OTHER INDICATORS OUTSIDE OF THE ROLE TRADITIONALLY PLAYED BY HEALTH-CARE ORGANIZATIONS. THESE ACTIVITIES ARE ALMOST EXCLUSIVELY DONE IN SOME FORM OF PARTNERSHIP IN WHICH THE COMMUNITY OR OTHER ORGANIZATIONS ARE BETTER SUITED TO ADDRESS. HEALTH-CARE ORGANIZATIONS GENERALLY PROVIDE TIMELY AND SPECIFIC RESOURCES TO HELP THESE ISSUES. HEALTH-CARE ORGANIZATIONS CAN BE A RICH AND VALUABLE COMMUNITY RESOURCE IN WAYS NOT TYPICALLY CONSIDERED. OFTEN THE MOST EFFECTIVE WAY TO HELP IMPACT AND IMPROVE THE COMMUNITY HEALTH STATUS IS TO SUPPORT OTHER AGENCIES AND ORGANIZATIONS IN A VARIETY OF WAYS OUTSIDE OF HEALTH SERVICES. THIS IS OFTEN DONE THROUGH CASH OR IN-KIND SERVICES TO SUPPORT OTHER NON-PROFITS, DONATIONS OF DURABLE MEDICAL EQUIPMENT AND SUPPLIES TO CERTAIN AGENCIES, OR THROUGH LEADERSHIP AND EDUCATIONAL EXPERTISE. THE HOSPITAL CONTRIBUTES FINANCIALLY TO A WIDE VARIETY OF COMMUNITY ORGANIZATIONS THAT ADDRESS THE BROADER NEEDS OF THE COMMUNITY. THESE DONATIONS ALLOW OTHER NON-PROFIT ORGANIZATIONS TO FULFILL THEIR MISSIONS TO IMPROVE THE WELL BEING OF THE COMMUNITY AND CONTRIBUTE TO ITS OVERALL HEALTH STATUS IN WAYS THAT MAY DIFFER FROM THE DIRECT SERVICES OF THE HOSPITAL ORGANIZATION AND MAXIMIZE THE RESOURCES THEY HAVE TO WORK WITH. THE HOSPITAL EMPLOYEES ARE ACTIVE IN EDUCATING PARTNERS ON A WIDE VARIETY OF HEALTH SUBJECTS THAT ADVANCE THEIR WORK. FURTHER, THE HOSPITAL EMPLOYEES ARE MEMBERS OF MANY NON-PROFIT BOARDS TO PROVIDE LEADERSHIP OR COLLABORATE TO ADDRESS COMPLEX HEALTH ISSUES.THESE TYPES OF ACTIVITIES SPEAK TO THE BREADTH AND CAPACITY THAT THE HOSPITAL HAS IN IMPACTING THE HEALTH STATUS OF THE COMMUNITY IN A COMPREHENSIVE AND INTENTIONAL APPROACH."

EXAMPLES OF THESE ITEMS INCLUDE PROVIDER BASED PHYSICIAN EXPENSE, SELF INSURANCE EXPENSE, HOME OFFICE EXPENSE AND THE SHORTFALL FROM FEE SCHEDULE PAYMENTS. IN ADDITION TO THESE ITEMS THE MEDICARE COST REPORT AND THE COST ACCOUNTING SYSTEM DO NOT INCLUDE MEDICARE PHYSICIAN FEE SCHEDULE EXPENSE AND OFFSETTING REVENUE.THE HOSPITAL BELIEVES THE ENTIRE AMOUNT OF THE MEDICARE SHORTFALL SHOULD BE TREATED AS COMMUNITY BENEFIT, MORE SPECIFICALLY, AS CHARITY CARE.

202001959349302810,231352187,"PART III, LINE 8 - MEDICARE EXPLANATION","PART III, LINE 3-BAD DEBT: MEDICARE COSTS WERE DERIVED FROM THE MEDICARE COST REPORT AND THE COST ACCOUNTING SYSTEM. THE ORGANIZATION BELIEVES THAT MEDICARE UNDERPAYMENTS (SHORTFALL) AND THE COST OF BAD DEBT ARE COMMUNITY BENEFIT AND SHOULD BE INCLUDED ON FORM 990, SCHEDULE H, PART I. AS OUTLINED MORE FULLY BELOW, THE ORGANIZATION BELIEVES THAT THESE SERVICES AND RELATED COSTS PROMOTE THE HEALTH OF THE COMMUNITY AS A WHOLE AND ARE RENDERED IN CONJUNCTION WITH THE ORGANIZATION'S CHARITABLE TAX-EXEMPT PURPOSES AND MISSION IN PROVIDING MEDICALLY NECESSARY HEALTHCARE SERVICES TO ALL INDIVIDUALS IN A NON- DISCRIMINATORY MANNER WITHOUT REGARD TO RACE, COLOR, CREED, SEX, NATIONAL ORIGIN, RELIGION OR ABILITY TO PAY AND IS CONSISTENT WITH THE COMMUNITY BENEFIT STANDARD PROMULGATED BY THE IRS. THE COMMUNITY BENEFIT STANDARD IS THE CURRENT STANDARD FOR A TAX-EXEMPT AND CHARITABLE ORGANIZATION UNDER THE INTERNAL REVENUE CODE (""IRC"") 501(C)(3). SATISFYING THE ""COMMUNITY BENEFIT STANDARD,"" AS ARTICULATED BY THE INTERNAL REVENUE SERVICE (IRS) IN REVENUE RULING 69-545, IS CURRENTLY REQUIRED FOR A HOSPITAL TO BE RECOGNIZED AS A CHARITABLE ORGANIZATION UNDER INTERNAL REVENUE CODE (IRC) 501(C)(3). THIS RULING REMOVED THE PREVIOUS REQUIREMENT OF REVENUE RULING 56-185, KNOWN AS THE ""CHARITY CARE STANDARD,"" THAT IN ORDER TO BE A CHARITABLE ORGANIZATION, A HOSPITAL HAD TO PROVIDE, TO THE EXTENT OF ITS FINANCIAL ABILITY, FREE OR REDUCED-COST CARE TO PATIENTS UNABLE TO PAY FOR THEIR CARE. THIS EARLIER RULING EMPHASIZED THAT A LOW LEVEL OF CHARITY CARE DID NOT MEAN THAT A HOSPITAL WAS CHARITABLE SINCE THAT LEVEL COULD REFLECT THE HOSPITAL'S FINANCIAL ABILITY TO PROVIDE SUCH CARE. REVENUE RULING 56-185 ALSO NOTED THAT PUBLICLY SUPPORTED COMMUNITY HOSPITALS WOULD NORMALLY QUALIFY AS CHARITABLE BECAUSE THEY SERVE THE ENTIRE COMMUNITY AND A LOW LEVEL OF CHARITY CARE WOULD NOT IMPACT A HOSPITAL'S CHARITABLE STATUS IF IT WAS DUE TO THE SURROUNDING COMMUNITY'S LACK OF CHARITABLE DEMANDS. AS DEVELOPED IN REVENUE RULING 69-545, UNDER THE COMMUNITY BENEFIT STANDARD, HOSPITALS WERE JUDGED ON WHETHER THEY PROMOTE THE HEALTH OF A BROAD CLASS OF INDIVIDUALS IN THE COMMUNITY. THIS RULING INVOLVED A HOSPITAL THAT ONLY ADMITTED THOSE WHO COULD PAY FOR THE SERVICES EITHER BY THEMSELVES, THROUGH PRIVATE INSURANCE OR PUBLIC PROGRAMS SUCH AS MEDICARE. IN ADDITION, THE HOSPITAL OPERATED A FULL-TIME EMERGENCY ROOM THAT WAS OPEN TO EVERYONE. THE IRS RULED THAT THE HOSPITAL WAS CHARITABLE BECAUSE IT PROMOTED THE HEALTH OF PEOPLE IN ITS COMMUNITY. THE IRS REASONED THAT BECAUSE THE PROMOTION OF HEALTH WAS A CHARITABLE PURPOSE ACCORDING TO THE GENERAL LAW OF CHARITY, IT FELL WITHIN THE ""GENERALLY ACCEPTED LEGAL SENSE"" OF THE TERM CHARITABLE, AS REQUIRED BY TREASURY REGULATION SECTION 1.501 (C)(3)-1(D)(2). THE IRS RULED THAT THE PROMOTION OF HEALTH, LIKE RELIEF OF POVERTY AND THE ADVANCEMENT OF EDUCATION AND RELIGION, IS ONE OF THE PURPOSES OF THE GENERAL LAW OF CHARITY THAT IS DEEMED BENEFICIAL TO THE COMMUNITY AS A WHOLE EVEN THOUGH THE CLASS OF BENEFICIARIES ELIGIBLE TO RECEIVE A DIRECT BENEFIT FROM ITS ACTIVITIES DOES NOT INCLUDE ALL MEMBERS OF THE COMMUNITY, SUCH AS INDIGENT MEMBERS OF THE COMMUNITY, PROVIDED THAT THE CLASS IS NOT SO SMALL THAT ITS RELIEF IS NOT OF BENEFIT TO THE COMMUNITY. THE IRS CONCLUDED THAT THE HOSPITAL WAS ""PROMOTING THE HEALTH OF A CLASS OF PERSONS THAT IS BROAD ENOUGH TO BENEFIT THE COMMUNITY"" BECAUSE ITS EMERGENCY ROOM WAS OPEN TO ALL AND IT PROVIDED CARE TO THOSE WHO COULD PAY, WHETHER DIRECTLY OR THROUGH THIRD-PARTY REIMBURSEMENT. OTHER FACTORS THAT DEMONSTRATED COMMUNITY BENEFIT INCLUDED: SURPLUS FUNDS WERE USED TO IMPROVE PATIENT CARE, EXPAND FACILITIES AND ADVANCE MEDICAL TRAINING, EDUCATION AND RESEARCH; AND IT WAS CONTROLLED BY A BOARD OF DIRECTORS THAT CONSISTED OF INDEPENDENT CIVIC LEADERS. THE AMERICAN HOSPITAL ASSOCIATION (""AHA"") BELIEVES THAT MEDICARE UNDERPAYMENTS (SHORTFALLS) AND BAD DEBT SHOULD BE REPORTED AS COMMUNITY BENEFIT ON FORM 990, SCHEDULE H, PART I, LINE 7. THIS ORGANIZATION AGREES WITH THE AHA'S LETTER TO THE IRS DATED AUGUST 21, 2007 RESPONDING TO A DRAFT OF THE NEW FORM 990 AND SCHEDULE H, THE AHA ARGUED THAT MEDICARE UNDERPAYMENTS (SHORTFALLS) IS COMMUNITY BENEFIT FOR THE FOLLOWING REASONS: -PROVIDING CARE FOR THE ELDERLY AND SERVING MEDICARE PATIENTS REMAINS AN ESSENTIAL PART OF THE COMMUNITY BENEFIT STANDARD. -MEDICARE, LIKE MEDICAID, DOES NOT PAY THE FULL COST OF CARE. RECENTLY, MEDICARE REIMBURSES ONLY 92 CENTS FOR EVERY DOLLAR HOSPITALS SPEND TO CARE FOR MEDICARE PATIENTS. -MANY MEDICARE PATIENTS, LIKE THEIR MEDICAID COUNTERPARTS, ARE POOR. MORE THAN 46% OF MEDICARE SPENDING IS FOR BENEFICIARIES WHOSE INCOME IS BELOW 200% OF THE FEDERAL POVERTY LEVEL. MANY ARE ALSO ELIGIBLE FOR MEDICAID, SO CALLED -DUAL ELIGIBLES"". PENNSYLVANIA REQUIRES NON-PROFIT HOSPITALS TO PROVIDE A MINIMUM LEVEL OF COMMUNITY BENEFIT TO RETAIN EXEMPTION FROM STATE AND LOCAL TAXES. ACCORDING TO STATE GUIDANCE AND CASE LAW, THE UNREIMBURSED COST OF MEDICARE AND BAD DEBT IS CONSIDERED TO BE COMMUNITY BENEFIT FOR STATE TAX EXEMPTION PURPOSES. PART III, LINE 6 ONLY INCLUDES THOSE COSTS THAT ARE PERMITTED TO BE REPORTED IN THE HOSPITAL'S MEDICARE COST REPORT THAT IS REQUIRED TO BE FILED WITH THE FEDERAL GOVERNMENT. THE HOSPITAL CONSIDERS THE TOTAL MEDICARE UNDERPAYMENTS (SHORTFALL) OF 11,543,965 SHOULD BE REPORTED AS COMMUNITY BENEFIT ON THE FORM 990, SCHEDULE H, PART I, LINE 7. ALONG WITH PROVIDING CARE TO MEDICAID PATIENTS AND PROVIDING FREE OR DISCOUNTED CARE TO OTHER LOW-INCOME PATIENTS, THE IRS COMMUNITY BENEFIT STANDARD INCLUDES THE PROVISION OF CARE TO THE ELDERLY AND MEDICARE PATIENTS. LIKE MEDICAID, MEDICARE DOES NOT PAY THE FULL COST OF PROVIDING CARE TO THESE PATIENTS, FORCING THE HOSPITAL TO USE OTHER FUNDS TO COVER THE SHORTFALL. MEDICARE SHORTFALLS MUST BE ABSORBED BY THE HOSPITAL IN ORDER TO CONTINUE TREATING THE ELDERLY IN OUR COMMUNITIES. THE HOSPITAL PROVIDES CARE REGARDLESS OF THE MEDICARE SHORTFALL AND IS THEREBY PROVIDING ACCESS TO MEDICAL SERVICES FOR THE ELDERLY AND RELIEVING THE FEDERAL GOVERNMENT OF THE BURDEN OF PAYING THE FULL COST FOR PROVIDING CARE TO MEDICARE PATIENTS. ABSENT THE MEDICARE PROGRAM, IT IS LIKELY THAT MANY MEDICARE PATIENTS WOULD BE ELIGIBLE FOR CHARITY CARE OR OTHER NEED-BASED GOVERNMENT PROGRAMS. THE AMOUNT EXPENDED TO COVER THE SHORTFALL IS MONEY NOT AVAILABLE FOR FINANCIAL ASSISTANCE AND OTHER COMMUNITY BENEFIT NEEDS. BOTH THE HOSPITAL AND THE AHA BELIEVE THAT PATIENT BAD DEBT BE REPORTED AS A COMMUNITY BENEFIT ON FORM 990, SCHEDULE H, PART I, LINE 7. LIKE MEDICARE UNDERPAYMENTS (SHORTFALLS), BAD DEBT SHOULD BE REPORTED AS COMMUNITY BENEFIT BECAUSE: -A SIGNIFICANT PORTION OF BAD DEBT IS ATTRIBUTABLE TO LOW-INCOME PATIENTS, WHO FOR MANY REASONS DECLINE TO COMPLETE THE FORMS REQUIRED TO ESTABLISH ELIGIBILITY UNDER THE HOSPITAL'S CHARITY CARE OR FINANCIAL ASSISTANCE POLICY (FAP). A 2006 CONGRESSIONAL BUDGET OFFICE (""CBO""), ""NONPROFIT HOSPITALS AND THE PROVISION OF COMMUNITY BENEFIT"", CITED TWO STUDIES INDICATING THAT ""THE GREAT MAJORITY OF BAD DEBT WAS ATTRIBUTABLE TO PATIENTS WITH INCOMES BELOW 200% OF THE FEDERAL POVERTY LINE."" -THE CBO REPORT ALSO NOTED THAT A SUBSTANTIAL PORTION OF THE BAD DEBT IS PENDING CHARITY CARE. UNLIKE BAD DEBT IN OTHER INDUSTRIES, HOSPITAL BAD DEBT IS COMPLICATED BY THE FACT THAT HOSPITALS FOLLOW THEIR CHARITABLE MISSION TO THE COMMUNITY AND TREAT EVERY PATIENT THAT COMES THROUGH THE EMERGENCY DEPARTMENT, REGARDLESS OF ABILITY TO PAY. PATIENTS WHO HAVE OUTSTANDING BILLS ARE NOT TURNED AWAY, UNLIKE OTHER INDUSTRIES. BAD DEBT IS FURTHER COMPLICATED BY THE AUDITING INDUSTRY'S STANDARDS ON REPORTING CHARITY CARE. MANY PATIENTS CANNOT OR DO NOT PROVIDE THE NECESSARY DOCUMENTATION REQUIRED TO BE DEEMED CHARITY CARE BY AUDITORS. AS A RESULT, ACCORDING TO THE CBO REPORT, ROUGHLY 40% OF BAD DEBT IS PENDING CHARITY CARE. (IN FY 2019, APPROXIMATELY 25% OF THE HOSPITAL'S BAD DEBT WAS SUBSEQUENTLY RECLASSIFIED TO CHARITY CARE.) THE CBO CONCLUDED THAT ITS FINDINGS ""SUPPORT THE VALIDITY OF THE USE OF UNCOMPENSATED CARE (BAD DEBT AND CHARITY CARE) AS A MEASURE OF COMMUNITY BENEFITS"" ASSUMING THE FINDINGS ARE GENERALIZED NATIONALLY. THE EXPERIENCE OF HOSPITALS NATIONWIDE REINFORCE THAT THEY ARE GENERALIZABLE. AS OUTLINED BY THE AHA, DESPITE THE HOSPITAL'S BEST EFFORTS AND DUE DILIGENCE, PATIENT BAD DEBT IS A PART OF THE CHARITABLE MISSION AND CHARITABLE PURPOSES. BAD DEBT REPRESENTS PART OF THE BURDEN HOSPITALS' BEAR IN SERVING ALL PATIENTS REGARDLESS OF RACE, COLOR, CREED, SEX, NATIONAL ORIGIN, RELIGION OR ABILITY TO PAY. IN ADDITION, THE HOSPITAL INVESTS SIGNIFICANT RESOURCES IN SYSTEMS AND STAFF TRAINING TO ASSIST PATIENTS THAT ARE IN NEED OF FINANCIAL ASSISTANCE. FOR FISCAL YEAR ENDED 6/30/2019, THE HOSPITAL'S COST OF PROVIDING PATIENT CARE FOR SERVICES ACCOUNTED FOR AS BAD DEBT WAS 641,087."

ZIP CODE 17044, LEWISTOWN, HAS THE HIGHEST CNI SCORE, INDICATING THE GREATEST COMMUNITY NEED. THE ZIP CODE HAS THE HIGHEST PERCENTAGE OF HOUSEHOLDS LIVING IN POVERTY AND THE HIGHEST UNEMPLOYMENT RATE. HOWEVER, RESIDENTS ARE MORE LIKELY TO HAVE ATTAINED HIGHER EDUCATION AND LESS LIKELY TO BE WITHOUT HEALTH INSURANCE WHEN COMPARED TO THE COUNTY OVERALL.

THE DEMOGRAPHIC SHIFT IS A STATEWIDE TREND. MINORITY POPULATIONS ARE THE ONLY GROWING DEMOGRAPHIC IN PENNSYLVANIA. THE HISPANIC/LATINO POPULATION IS ONE OF THE FASTEST GROWING DEMOGRAPHIC GROUPS. THE AMISH ARE ALSO A PROMINENT POPULATION GROUP WITHIN THE WESTERN REGION. APPROXIMATELY 8,200 AMISH INDIVIDUALS RESIDE IN SIX SETTLEMENTS ACROSS THE THREE COUNTIES.

MEDICARE SHORTFALLS AS COMMUNITY BENEFIT SCHEDULE H, Part III, Section B, line 8 The amount reported on Part III, Line 6, was calculated in accordance with Schedule H instructions by utilizing the organizations allowable Medicare cost as reported in the Medicare cost report, which is based on a cost to charge ratio. However, the allowable costs in the Medicare cost report do not reflect the actual cost of providing care to patients since the Medicare cost report excludes many direct patient care costs that are essential to provide quality healthcare for Medicare patients. For example, certain coverage fees to physicians, cost of Medicare C and D, and other similar direct patient care expenses are specifically excluded from allowable cost in the Medicare Cost Report. The organization believes that Piedmont Columbus Regionals Medicare shortfall reported on Part III, Line 7 of Schedule H, should be considered a community benefit as the IRS community benefit standard includes the provision of care to elderly and Medicare patients. IRS Revenue Ruling 69-545 provides, in part, that hospitals serving patients with governmental health insurance, such as Medicare, is an indication the hospital operates to promote health in the community. Additionally, Medicare accounted for 12.55% percent of Piedmont Columbus Regionals patient service revenue. Piedmont Columbus Regionals policy is to treat Medicare patients, regardless of the extent to which Medicare actually pays for the treatment. For many services, Medicares reimbursement is less than the cost of the care provided, resulting in shortfalls that are to be absorbed by the hospital in honor of Piedmont Columbus Regionals commitment to treat elderly patients. Many of these patients live on a low, fixed income, and would qualify for financial assistance or other means-tested programs, absent from their enrollment in Medicare. means-tested programs, absent from their enrollment in Medicare.

202031369349303153,581685139,"SCHEDULE H, PART VI, LINE 2: NEEDS ASSESSMENT","As a designated 501(c)(3) nonprofit hospital, Piedmont Columbus Regional is required by the Internal Revenue System to provide to conduct a triennial community health needs assessment (CHNA), in accordance with regulations put forth by the IRS following the 2010 Patient Protection and Affordable Care Act (ACA). Through this assessment, we hope to better understand local health challenges, identify health trends in our community, determine gaps in the current health delivery system and craft a plan to address those gaps and the identified health needs. In FY19, Piedmont Columbus Regional conducted its third triennial CHNA. The Piedmont Columbus Regional CHNA was led by the Piedmont Healthcare community benefits team, with significant input and direction from Piedmont Columbus leadership, including the hospital's community outreach team. Process The CHNA started first with a definition of our community. We started first with the hospitals home county, due to the impact of our tax-exempt status. We estimate property taxes make up the largest segment of a hospitals tax exemption. Because of this, we want to ensure that we are providing equal benefit to our county. Additionally, we take into consideration patient origin, and especially that of our lower-income patients, such as those who qualify for financial assistance or receive insurance coverage through Medicaid. Our secondary communities are considered the areas in which we have the highest concentration of patients fitting that criteria, including ones from nearby DeKalb County. Once we established our primary and secondary community, we then conducted an analysis of available public health data. This included resources from: US Census, US Health and Human Services Community Health Status Indicators, US Department of Agriculture, Economic Research Service, National Center for Education Statistics, Kaiser Family Foundation's State Health Facts, American Heart Association, County Health Rankings and Georgia Online Analytical Statistical Information System (OASIS). All figures are for 2017, unless otherwise noted. Health indicators are estimates provided by County Health Rankings and hospital data were provided by the hospital. An internal survey was also conducted throughout the healthcare system for both clinical and non-clinical employees. Information was gathered on knowledge and understanding of community benefit and current programs, as well as suggestions for how we can better serve our patients and communities. Nearly 900 employees spanning the system responded. Additionally, we conducted a community-based survey in which local stakeholders were asked their thoughts on unmet community health needs and the hospital's role in addressing those needs. These stakeholders included local leaders, nonprofit representatives, elected officials and those with a unique knowledge of the challenges vulnerable populations face. We also evaluated previous community benefit, hospital and community interventions identified in our last CHNA implementation strategies through three lenses: impact, outcomes and sustainability. Interventions and programming considered to have a high score on all three were included in this CHNA and our subsequent strategy. This included our community benefit grants program, our charitable clinic-hospital partnerships and our heart- and stroke-focused community programming. In March 2019, the Piedmont Columbus community outreach team convened a meeting of key stakeholders to discuss health challenges and needs in the local community. Among the 47 stakeholders present were representatives from MercyMed of Columbus charitable clinic, Valley Healthcare System, the Muscogee County School District, the Muscogee County Health Department and Columbus Consolidated Government. The goal of this meeting was to establish community consensus on top unmet health needs the hospital should address. Finally, we conducted direct interviews with 31 state and regional stakeholders and policymakers, with each representing a specific group that tends to be adversely impacted by issues of health equity. These groups included but are not limited to Georgians for a Healthy Future, Georgia Watch, ConsiderHealth, the Community Foundation for Greater Atlanta, the Georgia Charitable Care Network, the Medical Association of Georgia and Healthy Mothers, Healthy Babies. Additionally, we sought and received feedback on our CHNA from public health."
202031369349303153,581685139,Our priorities,"A key component of the CHNA is to identify the top health priorities we WILL address over fiscal years 2020, 2021 and 2022. These priorities guide our community benefit work. They are, in no order: -Increase access to appropriate and affordable health care for all community members, and especially those who are uninsured and those with low incomes -Decrease deaths from cancer and increase access to cancer programming for those with living the disease -Decrease preventable instances of diabetes and decrease the number of patients with uncontrolled diabetes -Reduce rates of obesity and increase access to healthy foods and recreational activities -Decrease the impact of and deaths from stroke -Reduce opioid and related substance abuse and overdose deaths With each priority, we work to achieve greater health equity by reducing the impact of poverty and other socioeconomic indicators. This means that health equity is built into each priority, and that is demonstrated through our implementation strategies. How we determined our priorities: Several key community health needs emerged during the assessment process. The chosen priorities were recommended by the community benefit department with sign-off from hospital and board leadership. The following criteria were used to establish the priorities: -The number of persons affected; -The seriousness of the issue; -Whether the health need particularly affected persons living in poverty or reflected health disparities; and, -Availability of community and/or hospital resources to address the need. The priorities we chose reflected a collective agreement on what hospital leadership, staff and the community felt was most important and within our ability to positively impact the issue. While the priorities reflect clinical access and certain conditions, all priorities are viewed through the lens of health disparities, with particular attention paid to improving outcomes for those most vulnerable due to income and race. This community health needs assessment was unanimously approved by the Piedmont Columbus Regional Board of Directors on June 6, 2019. The Piedmont Columbus Regional implementation strategy was developed in partnership with hospital leadership and community stakeholders to address the identified priorities in our FY19 CHNA. The implementation strategy was designed to be executed over a three-year period and included specific metrics by which we would be able to evaluate our work and its impact. The implementation strategy was developed by utilizing community feedback from the assessment in partnership with the system community benefits department, Piedmont Columbus Regional leadership and the Piedmont Columbus Regional Board of Directors. As mentioned above, we included proven and successful interventions and programming, investing further in work we felt was successful in addressing unmet health needs. The CHNA implementation strategy was unanimously approved October 3, 2019."
202031369349303153,581685139,"SCHEDULE H, PART VI, LINE 3: PATIENT EDUCATION OF ELIGIBILITY FOR ASSIST.","Piedmont Columbus Regional understands that not everyone has the ability to pay their hospital bill due to their insurance status or a limited income, and because of this, we offer financial assistance to qualifying patients. Notification about financial assistance available at Piedmont Columbus Regional includes providing a dedicated contact number, which is disseminated by the hospital to patients by various means. These include, but are not limited to: the publication of notices in patient bills and by posting notices in emergency rooms, in the Conditions of Admission form, at admitting and registration departments, hospital business offices, and patient financial services offices that are located on facility campuses, and at other public places the hospital may elect, including availability at local low-cost clinics primarily treating uninsured populations. Piedmont Columbus Regional also publishes and widely publicizes a plain language summary of this financial assistance care policy on its facility website, which includes a link to full policy. Referral of patients for financial assistance may be made by any staff or medical staff member at the hospital, including physicians, nurses, financial counselors, social workers, case managers, chaplains and religious sponsors. A request for financial assistance may be made by the patient or a family member, close friend, or associate of the patient, subject to applicable privacy laws. Finally, we provide copies of our financial assistance policy to our partner clinics and others who work closely with low-income populations. We offer assistance in understanding the policy, how it relates to their populations and receive feedback in ways our financial assistance programming could be improved. Additionally, Piedmont Healthcare annually publishes a directory of services and programs for low-income community members, and within this resource guide are extensive directions and advice on how to apply for patient financial assistance. Also, in this guide is information on how to apply for certain government assistance programs, resources to help prepare and file tax returns, as well as detailed resources for local sliding scale and free mental, dental and health resources. This guide is widely distributed to the community via hardcopy, is available within our hospitals and is digitally available online. Copies are provided in both English and Spanish."
202031369349303153,581685139,"SCHEDULE H, PART VI, LINE 4: COMMUNITY INFORMATION","Piedmont Columbus Regional is located in Muscogee County, which we consider to be our primary community. In 2017, the last year for which Census data were available, approximately 198,647 people lived in Muscogee County and 97 percent lived in an urban area. That year, about 41 percent of all Muscogee County residents were white, 45 percent were African American, 8 percent were Hispanic or Latino, 2 percent were Asian, and 4 percent were another race. In 2017, the median household income was $43,239, which is lower than both state and national averages. African Americans specifically had a much lower median household income at $31,907. The median age of people living within the county was 34. A quarter of the population were 18 or younger, 18 percent were over the age of 65 and the rest were in between. The population skewed slightly female. Sixty percent of the population has, at a minimum, attended some college and 26 percent has received their bachelors degree or higher. Thirty-six percent of those living in poverty in the county did not graduate high school. In 2017, an estimated 87 percent of county residents graduated high school, right on par with the state average. Of the estimated 46,324 who were employed in 2017, most worked in health care/social assistance, retail and the hospitality industry, in that order. About 20,891 veterans lived in the county in 2017, with more than two-thirds having served in the Gulf War and 29 percent having served in Vietnam. Twenty-two percent of those veterans lived with a disability and about 19 percent lived below the poverty level. About 5 percent of households spoke a language other than English at home in 2017, with the majority of those households speaking Spanish. Most people - about 52 percent - rented their home in 2017, a number much higher than the state average of 37 percent. In Muscogee County, like with the rest of Georgia, heart disease is the number one cause of both age-adjusted and premature death, and this holds true for all races. Age-adjusted allows communities with different age structures to be compared. Premature death is when death happens before the average age for a given community. While COPD is the second leading cause of death for all races combined, diabetes is the second leading cause of death for African Americans. COPD is the second leading cause of death for whites. Information about other races, including Hispanic, Latino and Asian populations, was not available. Heart disease was the leading cause of premature death among all ages and races in aggregate between 2013 and 2017. Certain conditions originating in the perinatal period (the first 28 days of life) was the second leading cause of premature death for African Americans and suicide was the second leading cause of premature death for whites. In Muscogee County, 14 percent of adults were uninsured in 2017, and minorities comprise 90 percent of that figure. There were four designated health professional shortage areas in the community in 2016, all of which are located just north of Columbus: two primary care shortage areas, one mental health shortage area and a dental health shortage area. Throughout Georgia, more than a fifth of all women and a third of all men report having no personal doctor or health home. This is particularly true for minorities, whose rates of not having a doctor are double and triple that of their white counterparts. There were 54 dentists for every 100,000 people in 2015, a figure slightly better than the state average and significantly below the national rate. Seventy-four percent of adults had a routine check-up within the previous year in 2015. Preventable hospital stays among Medicare enrollees significantly has decreased over the last few years (from 51 preventable stays per 1,000 enrollees in 2007 to 37 preventable stays in 2015). Community members have reported an average 4.3 and 4.0 poor physical and mental health days, respectively. Both measures increased since our last CHNA, and poor mental days jumped by about a day, indicating a worsening situation. Twenty-two percent of Muscogee residents reported their health as poor or fair. This is an improvement from 17 percent since our last CHNA. Long commutes are also much lower in Muscogee County than in the rest of the state. Only 16 percent drove more than 30 minutes in 2016 to get to work, as opposed to a 40 percent state average. Eighteen percent of the population lived with at least one disability in 2017, which is significantly higher than the state average of 12 percent. Those age 18 to 64 comprised nearly 60 percent of total disabled. The infant mortality rate is twice as high in Muscogee County than the national average. During that same time, 11 percent of all babies born were at a low birth weight, with African American children more likely to be born at a low birth weight than their white, Asian and Hispanic or Latino counterparts. In 2017, 92 county residents died from stroke. The age-adjusted death rate for stroke was 46.5 per every 100,000 residents that year, a figure that has steadily improved the last three years. For example, in 2015, the age-adjusted death rate for stroke was 50.3 deaths per every 100,000 people. Approximately 14 percent of adults lived with diabetes in Muscogee County in 2015, a figure higher than state and national averages (11 percent and 9 percent, respectively). In 2015, 32 percent of Medicare beneficiaries lived with diabetes. The numbers may be higher for Medicare beneficiaries because that population is more likely to be tested routinely for the disease. Cancer continues to have a devastating impact in Muscogee County. Among all cancers, lung cancer is the most devastating in Muscogee County, having claimed approximately 450 lives between 2013 and 2017. Lung cancer was the fourth cause of death in Muscogee County between 2013 and 2017 for all residents, and the age-adjusted death rate remains high above state and national averages. The overall cancer incidence rate was 134.9 per 100,000 people, which is higher than both state and national averages between 2011 and 2015. Lung cancer rates were particularly high, with an average 133 new cases annually between 2011 and 2015. Chronic obstructive pulmonary disease is the second leading cause of age-adjusted death and is caused almost exclusively from smoking. Violence is an issue in Muscogee County. Homicide was the 9th leading cause of all deaths for African Americans within the county between 2013 and 2017, and the third leading cause of premature deaths. The violent crime rate is far above both state and national averages, with 517 violent crimes per every 100,000 residents. Chlamydia and gonorrhea rates were far above state averages and nearly double national averages in 2016, with both being most prevalent in African American populations. Approximately 913 people lived with HIV in 2015. HIV is a life-threatening communicable disease that disproportionately affects minority populations and may also indicate the prevalence of unsafe sex practices. The Muscogee rate is lower than the state average but about 40 percent higher than the national average. Mental health and behavioral disorders were the 7th leading cause of death for all county residents between 2013 and 2017. We see this particularly in premature death. Suicide was the second leading cause of premature deaths for whites between 2013 and 2017. It is most common among males aged 25 to 34 years of age. There was one mental health provider for every 370 residents in the county in 2017, a rate better than the state average of just one provider for every 870 residents. Opioid prescriptions have decreased over the last few years. In 2007, there were approximately 108.2 retail opioid prescriptions dispensed per 100 persons, according to the CDC. That number has dropped to 86.5 in 2017. Even so, Muscogee County remains much higher than the national average of 58.7 per 100 people and state average of 70.9. We aren't able to tell how many prescriptions are going to a single person, just the overall figure. Drug overdoses in Muscogee County are lower than state averages, with only 10 overdoses per 100,000 people in 2016, versus the state average of 12. Opioid use is directly correlated with increased rates of Hepatitis C, according to numerous studies. Georgia still remains one of the worst states for drug overdose deaths in the country, and this has only gotten worse. For example, there was a 10.5 percent increase in overdose deaths in the state between 2016 and 2017. Six percent of adults were unemployed in 2017, a figure just above the national average of 5 percent. 36 percent of those living in poverty in the county did not graduate high school in the 2015-2016 school year. In 2015, 36 percent of the population had limited access to healthy foods and 21 percent reported having extended periods when they aren't sure how they or their families will eat. There were 109 fast fo"

In FY19, Piedmont Columbus Regional offered various proactive community benefit programs meant to boost the health of the community it serves. This includes its mobile unit, which regularly serves low-income communities throughout Muscogee and surrounding areas. The mobile unit works on monthly rotation schedule to provide blood pressure checks, stroke, diabetes, cancer and opioid education to schools, faith-based organizations, housing areas and other community organizations. The hospital also conducted weekly clinics at Safe House and Valley (alternating locations) to provide medical care to homeless population. Hospital staff partners with key staff members at each location (i.e. case workers) to help establish a continuum of care plan for the individuals. In FY19, the hospital maintained its accredited Diabetes Prevention Program, which focuses on at-risk populations as identified in its CHNA. Activities included: ongoing diabetes education includes information on diabetes management, physical activity, medication usage, complication prevention and how to cope with this chronic disease; nutrition education that focuses on food choices and improving blood sugar control; and education to reduce negative impact of diabetes reduce heart disease risk factors and improve weight management. The hospital also regularly offered stroke awareness educational materials and blood pressure screenings at health fairs and community events to achieve and maintain stroke certification, community awareness. Piedmont Columbus Regional also provided health professions education to students and residents training to be health professionals. In FY19, Piedmont Columbus Regional medical staff oversaw a total training at a cost of $6,967,495. In FY19, the hospital also provided to the community funding to support local not-for-profit organizations with programming that directly aligned with the hospitals CHNA. The hospital funded the Mercy Med of Columbus primary care program and the Sexual Assault Support Centers onsite examination room and equipment. The hospital also provided space on-site at no charge for the Sexual Assault Support Center. As part of a Piedmont Healthcare systemwide effort, Piedmont Columbus Regional was an active participant in anti-opioid work, which included: active participation on the systemwide task force, tracking opioid prescriptions within the hospital and by providers, utilizing Epic EMR tools to monitor opioid use, offering patients and the community ways to safely dispose of unused medication, and providing ongoing education on opioid prescribing. Piedmont Columbus Regional also actively participated in local take-back day activities in FY19 by promoting and supporting a community drive for local residents to safely dispose of medications and needles."

As a tax-exempt organization, MaineHealth provides necessary patient care regardless of the patient's ability to pay for the services. MaineHealth cannot determine the amount of bad debt expense that could be reasonably attributable to patients who likely would qualify for financial assistance under the Hospital's free care policy. In addition, bad debt expense also includes amounts for services provided to individuals experiencing difficult personal or economic circumstances related to a portion of our community based patient population. Their medical bills often place these individuals in untenable positions where they are not able to handle their personal debt and then their new medical debt. However, because of their income level, they do not qualify for free care. By providing necessary healthcare services to those individuals either who fail to apply for financial assistance or who are experiencing difficult personal or economic circumstances, MaineHealth believes that bad debt expense should be included as a community benefit."

WITH A POPULATION OF 468,463 (2015), ONONDAGA IS THE SIXTH MOST POPULOUS COUNTY IN UPSTATE NEW YORK. ONONDAGA COUNTY IS COMPRISED PRIMARILY OF FORESTS AND AGRICULTURAL LANDS, RESULTING IN A POPULATION DENSITY OF 600 PERSONS/MI. THE COUNTY SEAT IS THE CITY OF SYRACUSE, WHERE NEARLY ONE-THIRD OF COUNTY RESIDENTS RESIDE. IN ADDITION TO SYRACUSE, 19 TOWNS, 15 VILLAGES, AND THE ONONDAGA NATION TERRITORY LIE WITHIN THE COUNTY'S BORDERS. INTERSTATES 90 AND 81 ARE MAJOR EAST-WEST AND NORTH-SOUTH HIGHWAYS THAT INTERSECT JUST NORTH OF SYRACUSE.WITH A POPULATION OF 144,142 (2015) SYRACUSE IS THE LARGEST CITY IN THE CENTRAL NEW YORK REGION AND THE FOURTH LARGEST UPSTATE NEW YORK CITY. THE SUBSTANTIAL DIFFERENCES IN THE SOCIO-DEMOGRAPHICS BETWEEN RESIDENTS OF SYRACUSE AND THE REST OF ONONDAGA COUNTY LEAD TO GEOGRAPHIC DISPARITIES IN HEALTH STATUS AND ARE A CRUCIAL CONSIDERATION DURING THE COMMUNITY HEALTH PLANNING PROCESS. IN ONONDAGA COUNTY THE MEDIAN AGE IS 38.8 YEARS WHILE IN SYRACUSE THE MEDIAN AGE IS 29.9 YEARS. WOMEN COMPRISE 51.8% OF THE POPULATION IN THE COUNTY AND 53% IN SYRACUSE. THERE ARE NEARLY 94,000 WOMEN OF CHILDBEARING AGE IN ONONDAGA COUNTY WITH ROUGHLY 37,000 RESIDING IN SYRACUSE. IN ONONDAGA COUNTY 80.4% SELF-IDENTIFY AS WHITE AND 11.1% AS BLACK WHILE IN THE CITY OF SYRACUSE 55% SELF-IDENTIFY AS WHITE AND 29% AS BLACK. ASIAN POPULATION IS 4% IN THE COUNTY AND 7% IN SYRACUSE. OVER 21,000 COUNTY RESIDENTS REPORT HISPANIC ETHNICITY AND AN ESTIMATED 12,000 REFUGEES AND FORMER REFUGEES CURRENTLY RESIDE IN SYRACUSE. CURRENT DATA SHOW THAT SYRACUSE HAS 30 ""EXTREME POVERTY"" CENSUS TRACTS (WHERE MORE THAN 40% OF RESIDENTS LIVE IN POVERTY). THE POVERTY RATE AMONG CHILDREN UNDER AGE 18 IN SYRACUSE IS 50% COMPARED TO 23% OF CHILDREN COUNTY-WIDE. CURRENTLY, ONLY 47.2% OF CHILDREN IN ONONDAGA COUNTY AND 42.8% IN SYRACUSE PARTICIPATE IN PRESCHOOL PROGRAMS. THERE ARE 18 PUBLIC SCHOOL DISTRICTS IN ONONDAGA COUNTY WITH AN ENROLLMENT OF APPROXIMATELY 70,000 STUDENTS, INCLUDING NEARLY 20,000 STUDENTS IN THE SYRACUSE CITY SCHOOL DISTRICT (SCSD). THIRTY-FOUR PRIVATE OR PAROCHIAL SCHOOLS IN THE COUNTY EDUCATE AN ADDITIONAL 8,000 STUDENTS. DISPARITIES IN EDUCATION OUTCOMES BETWEEN SYRACUSE AND THE REST OF THE COUNTY ARE EVIDENT, AS SCSD STUDENTS CONSISTENTLY SCORE SIGNIFICANTLY BELOW THE STATE AVERAGE ON STANDARDIZED TESTS. THE DISTRICT IS GENERALLY CONSIDERED ONE OF THE LOWEST PERFORMING IN NYS. IN ADDITION, THE HIGH SCHOOL DROPOUT RATE IN SYRACUSE WAS 11% FOR THE 2015-2016 SCHOOL YEAR, COMPARED TO 4% COUNTY-WIDE. THE PERCENT OF GRADUATES IN SYRACUSE WHO WILL GO ON TO SOME TYPE OF COLLEGE IS 71%, COMPARED WITH 81% COUNTY-WIDE.HOUSING IN ONONDAGA COUNTY REMAINS RELATIVELY AFFORDABLE. THE AGE AND CONDITION OF HOUSING STOCK VARIES ACROSS THE COUNTY. SYRACUSE IS AN OLDER CITY, WITH 43.7% OF THE HOUSING BUILT PRIOR TO 1940, AND 72.5% BUILT BEFORE 1960. MOST OF THE RECENT NEW HOME BUILDING HAS OCCURRED IN THE COUNTY SUBURBS, THOUGH A RECENT DOWNTOWN REVITALIZATION EFFORT HAS LED TO AN INCREASE IN HIGH END APARTMENTS AND CONDOMINIUMS IN POPULAR BUSINESS AND SHOPPING DISTRICTS. SYRACUSE HOUSING UNITS ARE LESS LIKELY TO BE OWNER-OCCUPIED (38.5%) COMPARED TO ONONDAGA COUNTY (81.0%), WHICH CONTRIBUTES TO SOME OF THE POOR HOUSING CONDITIONS THAT EXIST WITHIN SPECIFIC SYRACUSE NEIGHBORHOODS."

The footnote for Accounts Receivable is as follows Patient accounts receivable are reported at net realizable value. For receivables associated with services provided to patients who have third-party coverage, the System estimates net realizable value based on the estimated contractual reimbursement percentage, which in turn is based on current contract provisions and historical paid claims by payor. For self-pay accounts, including uninsured and patient responsibility accounts, the net realizable value is determined using historical collection experience, adjusted for estimated conversions of patient responsibility portions, expected recoveries and changes in trends to estimate implicit price concessions in 2018 or the provision for bad debts in 2017. Management continually reviews the estimated net realizable value of accounts receivable by monitoring cash collections, economic conditions and trends, changes in payor mix, changes in federal or state healthcare coverage and other matters. The System grants credit without collateral to its patients, most of whom are local residents and are insured under third-party payor agreements, primarily with Medicare, Medicaid, and various commercial insurance companies. The System records accounts receivable net of estimated price concessions in 2018 and allowances for bad debts in 2017 and such amounts have historically been within managements expectations. The mix of accounts receivable at December 31, 2018 and 2017, from patients and third-party payors is as follows. For 2018, Medicare 29, Medicaid 18, Blue Cross 24, Commercial/Managed Care/Other 26, Patients 3, Total 100.

IMC draws at least 75% of its patients from the Central Brooklyn neighborhoods of BedfordStuyvesant,Crown Heights, Prospect Heights, and Brownsville located in in Kings County, which include the primary ZIP codes of 11233, 11213, 11216, 11221, and 11212 and secondary ZIP codes of 11238, 11207, 12206, 11208, and 11225. The service areas are also defined as Brooklyn Community Districts 3 and 8. According to the 2015 NYC Community Health Profile for Brooklyn Community District 3, the population totaled 154,332 with 64% of residents identifying as black or African-American and 32% were ages 25 to 44. The 2015 NYC Community Health Profile for Brooklyn Community District 8 reported a population of 97,772 with 64% of residents identifying as black or African-American and 36% were ages 25 to 44. The hospital provides healthcare to approximately 40,000 unique patients each year, including more than 9,000 inpatient stays, 130,000 outpatient visits, and 36,000 adult & pediatric emergency visits. In 2015, IMC served 175,514 patients (38,924 unduplicated). More than half(51%) of the hospitals patients were female, 36% were ages 18 to 39, 4% were homeless, 80% were African American, 6% were White Hispanic, 4% were Black Hispanic, 4% were white; 65% were covered by Medicaid or a Medicaid HMO, and 5% were uninsured; 13% abused substances, and 21% had mental health issues. Another distinct aspect of the community that IMC serves is the high percentage of individuals who have had incarceration experiences or have been on parole, which exacerbates the observed mental health and substance abuse disparities. According to the Justice Mapping Centers Justice Atlas of Sentencing and Corrections, NYC neighborhoods that are home to 18% of the citys adult population account for more than 50% of prison admission each year. The parolee rate is also disproportionately high for Central Brooklyn. This demographic profile reflects Central Brooklyn as a whole, which is a designated Medically Underserved Area and Health Professional Shortage Area for Dental Health, Mental Health, and Primary Care."

ELLIS SUCCESSFULLY RESTRUCTURED HEALTH CARE SERVICES IN SCHENECTADY FOLLOWING THE NEW YORK STATE-MANDATED HOSPITAL CONSOLIDATION IN 2007-2008, AND HAS SINCE BEEN WORKING TO IMPROVE THE EFFICIENCY AND EFFECTIVENESS OF SERVICES TO ITS COMMUNITY BY ALIGNING ITS INNOVATIVE APPROACHES TO COMMUNITY HEALTH WITH THE SERVICES PROVIDED BY OTHER LOCAL COMMUNITY-BASED PUBLIC AND NOT-FOR-PROFIT ORGANIZATIONS. ELLIS IS NOW THE SOLE ACUTE CARE HOSPITAL IN SCHENECTADY COUNTY, AND IS ONE OF THE LARGEST PRIMARY CARE PROVIDERS, HAVING ASSUMED RESPONSIBILITY FOR THE SERVICES OF TWO FORMER HOSPITALS WHICH CLOSED DURING THE STATE'S ""RIGHTSIZING"" PROCESS. IN THIS IMPORTANT ROLE, ELLIS HAS ENGAGED THE COMMUNITY AND DEVELOPED COALITIONS WITH COMMUNITY PARTNERS IN ORDER TO ENSURE ACCESS TO A FULL RANGE OF HEALTHCARE SERVICES, WITH SPECIAL ATTENTION PAID TO DISADVANTAGED MEMBERS OF OUR COMMUNITY. ELLIS HAS UNDERTAKEN A NUMBER OF SIGNIFICANT CAPITAL PROJECTS TO CONSOLIDATE CARE, ENHANCE ACCESS TO CARE, AND IMPROVE THE OVERALL QUALITY, EFFICIENCY, AND COST-EFFECTIVENESS OF OUR LOCAL HEALTH CARE SYSTEM. ELLIS SERVES AS CO-LEAD AGENCY (WITH SCHENECTADY COUNTY PUBLIC HEALTH SERVICES) OF THE SCHENECTADY COALITION FOR A HEALTHY COMMUNITY (SCHC). ELLIS MAINTAINS FOR SCHC AN E-MAIL LIST OF APPROXIMATELY 335 INDIVIDUALS FROM ABOUT 60 (SEE PART V, SECTION B, LINE 6B NARRATIVE) HEALTH CARE PROVIDERS, MANAGED CARE ORGANIZATIONS, COMMUNITY-BASED ORGANIZATIONS, AND LOCAL GOVERNMENT AGENCIES LOCATED IN OR SERVING PEOPLE IN SCHENECTADY. SCHC MEETS QUARTERLY AT THE ELLIS MCCLELLAN STREET HEALTH CENTER AUDITORIUM. THE FORMAL AGENDA (SEE PART V, SECTION B, LINE 5 NARRATIVE) INCLUDES PRESENTATIONS ON CURRENT TOPICS AND ACTIVITIES OF INTEREST, ALONG WITH REGULAR PRESENTATIONS ON LOCAL DSRIP AND PHIP INITIATIVES, AND PROVIDES TIME FOR INFORMAL INFORMATION SHARING AMONG THE PARTICIPANTS.SCHC SUPPORTS AD HOC COMMITTEES FOCUSED ON LOCAL POPULATION HEALTH NEEDS. THESE HAVE INCLUDED GROUPS FOCUSED ON THE MOST SIGNIFICANT COMMUNITY HEALTH NEEDS - OBESITY/DIABETES AND SUICIDE/MENTAL HEALTH - ALONG WITH THOSE INVESTIGATING EMERGING NEEDS AND RESPONSES, PARTICULARLY TRAUMA-INFORMED COMMUNITIES. THE COMMITTEES ENGAGE DIRECTLY AFFECTED MEMBER ORGANIZATIONS AND REPORT TO THE FULL GROUP. THE COMMITTEES ALSO HELP TO EMPHASIZE ACTIVITIES SUPPORTING THE IMPLEMENTATION STRATEGY.ELLIS IS A VOTING MEMBER OF THE HEALTHY CAPITAL DISTRICT INITIATIVE (HCDI), A COLLABORATIVE MEMBERSHIP ORGANIZATION SUPPORTED BY DUES FROM THE HOSPITALS, FEDERALLY QUALIFIED HEALTH CENTERS, NOT-FOR-PROFIT MANAGED CARE ORGANIZATIONS, AND COUNTY PUBLIC HEALTH DEPARTMENTS IN THE REGION. AN ELLIS EMPLOYEE SERVES ON THE HCDI BOARD OF DIRECTORS, AND WAS NAMED TREASURER AND A MEMBER OF THE EXECUTIVE COMMITTEE IN 2018. IN ADDITION TO SERVING AS A NEUTRAL CONVENER SUPPORTING REGIONAL COLLABORATION, HCDI HAS BEEN DESIGNATED BY THE NEW YORK STATE DEPARTMENT OF HEALTH AS THE POPULATION HEALTH IMPROVEMENT PROGRAM (PHIP) AGENCY FOR THE CAPITAL REGION. THE PHIP RECEIVES STATE FUNDING FOR RESEARCH AND REGIONAL HEALTH PLANNING SUPPORT.IN 2012, ELLIS AND ITS AFFILIATED VISITING NURSE SERVICE OF NORTHEASTERN NEW YORK (VNS) LED SIX COMMUNITY-BASED ORGANIZATIONS AND TEN HOSPITALS IN A TEN-COUNTY REGION COVERING 20% OF THE GEOGRAPHY OF THE STATE OF NEW YORK IN SUCCESSFULLY RECEIVING A CONTRACT AS A MEDICARE COMMUNITY-BASED CARE TRANSITIONS PROGRAM (CCTP). ALTHOUGH THE CCTP WAS HIGHLY SUCCESSFUL IN REDUCING READMISSIONS AMONG THE PATIENTS IT SERVED, IT DID NOT ACHIEVE THE PATIENT VOLUME REQUIRED BY CMS, AND THE CONTRACT FOR THIS REGION WAS NOT RENEWED BY CMS IN 2014. ELLIS AND ITS REGIONAL PARTNERS CONTINUED TO DELIVER CCTP-LIKE SERVICES TO PATIENTS INSURED BY A REGIONAL NOT-FOR-PROFIT MANAGED CARE ORGANIZATION. A DSRIP ""CARE TRANSITIONS"" PROJECT NOW SUSTAINS FUNDING FOR CERTAIN PATIENTS.ELLIS AND VNS ALSO LED COMMUNITY PROVIDERS AND COMMUNITY-BASED ORGANIZATIONS IN ESTABLISHMENT OF ONE OF THE FIRST THREE STATE-RECOGNIZED HEALTH HOMES IN UPSTATE NEW YORK. HEALTH HOMES RECEIVE CAPITATED STATE FUNDING TO DELIVER CARE MANAGEMENT SERVICES TO AT-RISK MEDICAID BENEFICIARIES, SPECIFICALLY THOSE WITH TWO OR MORE CHRONIC CONDITIONS, A SEVERE AND PERSISTENT MENTAL HEALTH DIAGNOSIS, OR A DIAGNOSIS OF HIV/AIDS. MUCH OF THE CARE MANAGEMENT IS DELIVERED BY ""DOWNSTREAM"" COMMUNITY-BASED AGENCIES INCLUDING CATHOLIC CHARITIES CAREGIVERS SERVICE AND THE ALLIANCE FOR POSITIVE HEALTH. IN 2018, ELLIS WITHDREW FROM PROVIDING HEALTH HOME SERVICES IN SCHENECTADY, BUT REMAINS AS A ""DOWNSTREAM PROVIDER"" FOR THE REGIONAL CAPITAL REGION HEALTH CONNECTIONS HEALTH HOME.ELLIS ALSO PROVIDES SERVICES AND EXPERTISE AT NO CHARGE TO COMMUNITY ORGANIZATIONS. MEETING ROOMS, INCLUDING AUDITORIUMS AT BOTH THE NOTT STREET AND MCCLELLAN STREET CAMPUSES, ARE MADE AVAILABLE AT NO CHARGE FOR CERTAIN COMMUNITY MEETINGS AND GROUPS, INCLUDING RED CROSS BLOOD DRIVES. MANY BOARD MEMBERS, PHYSICIANS AND OTHER STAFF DONATE THEIR SERVICES TO COMMUNITY ORGANIZATIONS. AS EXAMPLES, FACULTY PHYSICIANS AT THE FAMILY MEDICINE RESIDENCY SERVE AS OFFICERS OR BOARD MEMBERS OF SUCH ORGANIZATIONS AS CORNELL COOPERATIVE EXTENSION, SOUTHERN MEDICAL ASSOCIATION, NEW YORK COLLEGE OF OSTEOPATHIC MEDICINE EDUCATION AND RESEARCH COMMITTEE, HEPATITIS C TASK FORCE OF THE CAPITAL REGION, NEW YORK STATE ACADEMY OF FAMILY PHYSICIANS, AND HOMETOWN HEALTH CENTERS (FQHC) CREDENTIALING COMMITTEE. A MEMBER OF THE ELLIS BOARD OF TRUSTEES DURING AND PRIOR TO 2018 ALSO SERVES AS CHAIR OF THE BOARD OF HOMETOWN HEALTH CENTERS, AND ANOTHER TRUSTEE CHAIRS THE CITY OF SCHENECTADY MAYOR'S SMART CITY ADVISORY COMMITTEE.ANOTHER EXAMPLE OF ELLIS' COALITION BUILDING ACTIVITIES HAS BEEN ITS PARTICIPATION OVER THE YEARS IN THE SCHENECTADY COUNTY PUBLIC HEALTH SERVICES' FEDERALLY-FUNDED STRATEGIC ALLIANCE FOR HEALTH (SAH), WHICH BRINGS TOGETHER A HOST OF HEALTH CARE AND COMMUNITY ORGANIZATIONS TO ADDRESS CHRONIC DISEASE AND TO PROMOTE DISEASE PREVENTION AND WELLNESS. AN ELLIS REPRESENTATIVE PARTICIPATED WHEN THE SAH BOARD HELD REGULAR MEETINGS. ADDITIONALLY, ELLIS WORKS WITH A NUMBER OF COMMUNITY PARTNERS, SUCH AS THE AMERICAN HEART ASSOCIATION AND THE YMCA, TO PROVIDE HEALTH SCREENINGS TO UNINSURED AND UNDERINSURED POPULATIONS IN OUR SERVICE AREA. IN RECENT YEARS, ELLIS PROVIDED OFFICE SPACE AND OTHER IN-KIND SUPPORT FOR THE STATE-SPONSORED SCHENECTADY COUNTY CANCER SERVICES PROGRAM; AND IN 2018 PROVIDED NO-CHARGE OFFICE SPACE FOR THE VITA INCOME TAX PREPARATION VOLUNTEERS. IN COLLABORATION WITH COMMUNITY PARTNERS, ELLIS OFFERS OUTPATIENT SMOKING CESSATION COURSES AND SPONSORS PEER-DRIVEN MENTAL HEALTH AND CANCER PATIENT SUPPORT GROUPS. AND, ELLIS COOPERATES WITH COMMUNITY GROUPS TO FACILITATE ACCESS TO HEALTHY FOODS FOR PEOPLE THROUGH THE COMMUNITY. IN PAST YEARS, ACTING IN COLLABORATION WITH THE SCHENECTADY COUNTY PLANNING DEPARTMENT AND THE COOPERATIVE EXTENSION, ELLIS HOSTED A WEEKLY FARMERS' MARKET IN THE PARKING LOT OF THE ELLIS HEALTH CENTER DURING THE SUMMER MONTHS. AS PART OF A COUNTY GRANT, IN 2013 AND 2014 PHYSICIANS AT THE FAMILY HEALTH CENTER ""PRESCRIBED"" FRESH VEGETABLES TO AT-RISK PATIENTS. THE ""PRESCRIPTION"" CONSTITUTED A VOUCHER FOR NO-CHARGE LOCALLY-GROWN VEGETABLES WHICH WERE DISTRIBUTED AT A ""FARM STAND"" LOCATED AT THE ELLIS MCCLELLAN STREET HEALTH CENTER. DURING 2018, A ""FOOD FARMACY"" FOOD PANTRY, SPECIFICALLY FOCUSED ON ENSURING THE AVAILABILITY OF HEALTHY FOOD TO PATIENTS RECENTLY DISCHARGED FROM THE HOSPITAL, OPENED AT THE ELLIS MCCLELLAN STREET HEALTH CENTER, FUNDED BY A DSRIP GRANT. IN OTHER RECENT YEARS, ELLIS OFFERED USE OF THE PARKING LOT AT THE MCCLELLAN STREET HEALTH CENTER TO THE SCHENECTADY INNER CITY MINISTRY (SICM) MOBILE MEALS TRUCK WHICH PROVIDES FREE BREAKFASTS AND LUNCHES FOR CHILDREN AGE 18 OR UNDER DURING THE SUMMER WHEN SCHOOLS ARE CLOSED. ONE-HUNDRED PERCENT OF CHILDREN ATTENDING THE SCHENECTADY CITY SCHOOL DISTRICT (SCSD) SCHOOLS ARE ELIGIBLE FOR FREE SCHOOL LUNCHES.MEDICAL RESIDENTS FROM THE ELLIS FAMILY MEDICINE RESIDENCY DONATE THEIR TIME AND EXPERTISE TO STAFF FREE COMMUNITY-BASED MEDICAL CLINICS. RESIDENT-STAFFED FREE CLINICS AT THE SCHENECTADY CITY MISSION - AND, STARTING IN 2018, AT BETHESDA HOUSE - SERVE UNINSURED, HOMELESS INDIVIDUALS IN THE CITY OF SCHENECTADY. ELLIS STAFF MEMBERS ALSO SIT ON NUMEROUS COMMUNITY BOARDS AND HEALTHCARE COALITIONS TO TARGET IMPROVEMENTS IN SUCH AREAS AS DIABETES, LONG TERM CARE, CANCER, HOSPITAL READMISSION RATES, WORKFORCE DEVELOPMENT, AND HEALTHY LIVING."

THE ADJUSTED PATIENT CARE COST IS DIVIDED BY ADJUSTED PATIENT CARE CHARGES RESULTING IN THE RATIO.ELLIS BELIEVES THAT THE MEDICARE SHORTFALL REPORTED ON PART III LINE 7 SHOULD BE TREATED AS A COMMUNITY BENEFIT. FIRST, ELLIS IS THE ONLY ACUTE CARE GENERAL HOSPITAL IN SCHENECTADY, AND THUS PROVIDES VITAL HEALTH CARE SERVICES FOR MEDICARE BENEFICIARIES WHICH WOULD OTHERWISE BE UNAVAILABLE IN THE COMMUNITY. SECOND, THE INCOME LEVEL AND POVERTY RATE IN THE COMMUNITY DEMONSTRATE THE CHALLENGES WHICH WOULD BE FACED IF ELLIS WERE NOT ABLE TO PROVIDE CARE TO ALL PATIENTS, REGARDLESS OF ABILITY TO PAY. FOR EXAMPLE, THE MEDIAN HOUSEHOLD INCOME FOR THE CITY, AT $43,174, IS ONLY ABOUT TWO-THIRDS THAT OF THE COUNTY AS A WHOLE ($61,315), WHICH IN TURN IS BELOW THAT OF THE STATE ($62,765). THE POVERTY RATE IN THE CITY (21.0%) IS NEARLY 40% HIGHER THAN THAT OF THE COUNTY AS A WHOLE (12.8%). (US CENSUS BUREAU, STATE AND COUNTY QUICKFACTS, AS ACCESSED APRIL 23, 2019) THIRD, MEDICARE BENEFICIARIES ARE AMONG THOSE AFFECTED BY INCOME DISPARITIES WITHIN SCHENECTADY. NEARLY HALF (46%) OF THE RESIDENTS OF THE LARGELY MINORITY (67% NON-WHITE) HAMILTON HILL NEIGHBORHOOD ARE BELOW THE FEDERAL POVERTY LEVEL; 7.8% OF THESE RESIDENTS ARE 65 YEARS OF AGE OR OLDER (2009-2013 AMERICAN COMMUNITY SURVEY). RESIDENTS OF THIS NEIGHBORHOOD ARE AMONG THE HEAVIEST USERS OF HOSPITAL SERVICES; FOR EXAMPLE, THE RATE OF EMERGENCY DEPARTMENT UTILIZATION FOR FALLS AMONG PERSONS 65 AND OLDER IN HAMILTON HILL IS 52% ABOVE THE STATEWIDE AVERAGE (2010-2014 SPARCS). FINALLY, ABOUT 25% OF ELLIS' MEDICARE DISCHARGES ARE DUAL-ELIGIBLES (ENROLLED IN BOTH MEDICARE AND MEDICAID) WHO, BY VIRTUE OF THEIR MEDICAID ELIGIBILITY, ARE LOW-INCOME INDIVIDUALS. HENCE, THE FINANCIAL LOSSES INCURRED IN TREATING MEDICARE PATIENTS DETRACT FROM THE ABILITY OF THE HOSPITAL TO SERVE OTHER LOW-INCOME PATIENTS AND RESIDENTS, AND THE ABILITY OF THE HOSPITAL TO FUNCTION IN SPITE OF THESE LOSSES REPRESENTS A COMMUNITY BENEFIT."

(THE DESIGN OF THE ZIP CODE SYSTEM IS NOT ALIGNED WITH COUNTY OR OTHER POLITICAL BOUNDARIES. THE RURAL WESTERNMOST PORTION OF SCHENECTADY COUNTY IS NOT INCLUDED IN THE ZIP CODE-DEFINED PSA DUE TO LOW POPULATION, WHILE CERTAIN AREAS OF ALBANY AND SARATOGA COUNTIES DO FALL WITHIN THE SCHENECTADY ZIP CODES.) ALTHOUGH ELLIS ACTIVELY SERVES PEOPLE WITHIN ITS SECONDARY SERVICE AREA (SSA), THE GEOGRAPHIC BOUNDARIES OF THOSE ADDITIONAL ZIP CODES (THE ADDITIONAL CONTIGUOUS ZIP CODES IN WHICH THE NEXT 20% OF INPATIENTS LIVE, FOR AN APPROXIMATE TOTAL OF 80% OF INPATIENT VOLUME) STRETCH ACROSS FIVE COUNTIES AND INCLUDE PORTIONS OF THE SERVICE AREAS OF AT LEAST SIX OTHER HOSPITALS. RETAINING A FOCUS ON THE SCHENECTADY COMMUNITY WILL PERMIT DEVELOPMENT OF AN ACTIONABLE IMPLEMENTATION PLAN WHICH CAN TARGET COHESIVE POPULATIONS.2) POPULATION AND HEALTH DATA ARE COMMONLY AVAILABLE BY COUNTY. THE NEW YORK STATE DEPARTMENT OF HEALTH AND OTHER STATE GOVERNMENT AGENCIES MAINTAIN DATA BY COUNTY, THE HEALTHY CAPITAL DISTRICT INITIATIVE PROVIDES COMPARISON DATA BY COUNTY WITHIN THE REGION, AND DATA COLLECTED BY THE UNITED STATES CENSUS ARE FREQUENTLY AT THE COUNTY AND CITY LEVEL. ALTHOUGH CONVENIENCE IS NOT IN AND OF ITSELF A REASON TO DEFINE ""COMMUNITY,"" THE AVAILABILITY OF SOLID DATA, INCLUDING BASELINE AND COMPARISON DATA, WILL PROVIDE A BETTER BASIS FOR PLANNING, AND AN EXTERNALLY-VERIFIABLE SOURCE FOR OUTCOME MEASURES.3) ELLIS HAS ESTABLISHED STRONG PARTNERSHIPS WITH OTHER HEALTHCARE AND COMMUNITY SERVICE ORGANIZATIONS WHICH ARE LOCATED IN AND SERVE SCHENECTADY COUNTY. THE ""MEDICAL HOME GROUP,"" A LOOSE AFFILIATION OF COMMUNITY ORGANIZATIONS CREATED AT THE TIME OF THE THREE-HOSPITAL CONSOLIDATION IN 2008, HAS EVOLVED INTO THE SCHENECTADY COALITION FOR A HEALTHY COMMUNITY; OVER 60 COMMUNITY GROUPS INCLUDING BUSINESSES, LOCAL GOVERNMENT AGENCIES, HEALTHCARE AND SOCIAL SERVICES PROVIDERS AND COMMUNITY AGENCIES, FAITH-BASED ORGANIZATIONS, AND ADVOCACY GROUPS WHOSE LEADERS MEET QUARTERLY AT ELLIS. BY FOCUSING ""COMMUNITY"" ON A POPULATION WELL-SERVED BY A COORDINATED ARRAY OF PHYSICAL HEALTH, BEHAVIORAL HEALTH, AND COMMUNITY SERVICE ORGANIZATIONS IN COORDINATION WITH STRONG LOCAL GOVERNMENT AGENCIES, A COMMUNITY-WIDE ACTION PLAN CAN LEVERAGE THE HOSPITAL'S IMPLEMENTATION PLAN THROUGH THE EFFICIENT AND EFFECTIVE USE OF MULTIPLE RESOURCES.4) SELECTION OF SCHENECTADY COUNTY AS THE ""COMMUNITY"" IS CONSISTENT WITH REGULATORY REQUIREMENTS TO ASSURE INCLUSION OF ""MEDICALLY UNDERSERVED, LOW-INCOME, OR MINORITY POPULATIONS,"" AS THESE POPULATIONS REPRESENT A GREATER SHARE OF THE POPULATION IN SCHENECTADY COUNTY THAN THEY WOULD IF DIFFUSED AMONG THE FIVE COUNTIES OF THE SECONDARY SERVICE AREA.SCHENECTADY COUNTY (2018 ESTIMATED POPULATION: 155,350) IS, GEOGRAPHICALLY, THE SECOND SMALLEST COUNTY IN UPSTATE NEW YORK. IT CONSISTS OF FIVE TOWNS, TWO PRIMARILY RURAL AND THREE PRIMARILY SUBURBAN, SURROUNDING THE CENTRALLY-LOCATED CITY OF SCHENECTADY (2010 CENSUS POPULATION: 66,135). THE COUNTY IS LOCATED IMMEDIATELY WEST OF THE STATE CAPITAL OF ALBANY AND MANY OF ITS RESIDENTS COMMUTE TO JOBS IN ALBANY AND THE OTHER COUNTIES COMPRISING NEW YORK'S CAPITAL REGION.SCHENECTADY COUNTY PUBLIC HEALTH SERVICES (SCPHS), A UNIT OF COUNTY GOVERNMENT, IS RESPONSIBLE FOR ALL PUBLIC HEALTH AND ENVIRONMENTAL HEALTH ACTIVITIES AND ENFORCEMENT THROUGHOUT THE CITY AND COUNTY. THE COUNTY CONTAINS A SINGLE NON-PROFIT ACUTE CARE HOSPITAL - ELLIS HOSPITAL (ALSO KNOWN BY THE TRADE NAME ELLIS MEDICINE), AND A SINGLE FEDERALLY QUALIFIED HEALTH CENTER (FQHC) - HOMETOWN HEALTH CENTER. THERE IS ALSO A NON-PROFIT SPECIALTY HOSPITAL (SUNNYVIEW REHABILITATION HOSPITAL) WHICH IS A MEMBER OF THE ALBANY-BASED ST. PETER'S HEALTH PARTNERS SYSTEM. THERE IS ONE MEDICALLY UNDERSERVED POPULATION; THE HOMEBOUND POPULATION OF SCHENECTADY COUNTY (ID #06211). THE ENTIRE CITY OF SCHENECTADY IS DESIGNATED A HEALTH PROFESSIONS SHORTAGE AREA (HPSA) FOR THE MEDICAID POPULATION FOR MENTAL HEALTH AND DENTAL HEALTH. IN ADDITION, EIGHT CENSUS TRACTS IN THE HAMILTON HILL/MONT PLEASANT NEIGHBORHOODS, WHICH ARE IMMEDIATELY ADJACENT TO THE ELLIS MCCLELLAN STREET HEALTH CENTER, ARE DESIGNATED HEALTH PROFESSIONS SHORTAGE AREAS FOR THE MEDICAID POPULATION FOR PRIMARY CARE. HOMETOWN HEALTH CENTER, THE ELLIS DENTAL HEALTH CENTER, AND THE ELLIS OUTPATIENT MENTAL HEALTH CLINIC HAVE BEEN DESIGNATED BY HRSA AS NATIONAL HEALTH SERVICE CORPS PRACTICE SITES. SCHENECTADY COUNTY IS DIRECTLY SERVED BY ONE DSRIP PERFORMING PROVIDER SYSTEM (PPS), THE ALLIANCE FOR BETTER HEALTH (AFBH), AND IS ADJACENT TO THE SERVICE AREA OF THE ALBANY MEDICAL CENTER PPS.RESIDENTS OF THE CITY OF SCHENECTADY ARE GENERALLY LESS AFFLUENT AND LESS HEALTHY THAN RESIDENTS OF THE SURROUNDING TOWNS, WHILE RESIDENTS OF THE COUNTY AS A WHOLE ARE LESS AFFLUENT THAN THE STATE AS A WHOLE; HOWEVER THE COUNTY'S POVERTY RATE IS BELOW THAT OF THE STATE (SEE FIGURE 1). FOR EXAMPLE, THE MEDIAN HOUSEHOLD INCOME FOR THE CITY, AT $43,174, IS ONLY ABOUT TWO-THIRDS THAT OF THE COUNTY AS A WHOLE ($61,315), WHICH IS BELOW THAT OF THE STATE ($62,765). THE POVERTY RATE IN THE CITY (21.0%) IS NEARLY 40% HIGHER THAN THAT OF THE COUNTY AS A WHOLE (12.8%). STATE HEALTH DEPARTMENT DATA (2008-09) SHOW THAT HOSPITALIZATIONS FOR CONDITIONS WHICH COULD HAVE BEEN TREATED IN THE COMMUNITY (""PREVENTION QUALITY INDICATORS"") RANGE AS HIGH AS 202% OF THE EXPECTED RATE IN CERTAIN CITY NEIGHBORHOODS, BUT ARE AS LOW AS 49% OF THE EXPECTED RATE IN THE RURAL TOWNS. IN ONE DRAMATIC DISPARITY CONFIRMED BY MORE RECENT (2012-16) SPARCS HOSPITAL DISCHARGE DATA, EMERGENCY DEPARTMENT VISITS FOR ASTHMA RANGE FROM 229.3/10,000 IN THE CITY'S HAMILTON HILL NEIGHBORHOOD (12307) TO 24.5/10,000 IN THE NEARBY SUBURB OF NISKAYUNA (12309).A SIGNIFICANT MINORITY POPULATION IN THE CITY OF SCHENECTADY IS COMPRISED OF GUYANESE OF WEST INDIAN DESCENT. THE RESULT OF SECONDARY MIGRATION FROM NEW YORK CITY PROMOTED BY A PREVIOUS MAYOR ALONG WITH PRIMARY MIGRATION FROM GUYANA, THE INFLUX IS CREDITED WITH REVERSING YEARS OF POPULATION DECLINE IN THE CITY. SCHENECTADY COUNTY PUBLIC HEALTH SERVICES LED MULTIPLE INITIATIVES TO IDENTIFY AND ADDRESS HEALTH DISPARITIES RELATING TO THE WEST INDIAN POPULATION. RESEARCH CONDUCTED BY PHYSICIANS AT ELLIS MEDICINE REVEALED SPECIFIC HEALTH ISSUES REGARDING THE WEST INDIAN POPULATION. IN PARTICULAR, THE UNEXPECTED PREVALENCE OF DIABETES AMONG NON-OBESE GUYANESE MALES IS THE SUBJECT OF JOURNAL ARTICLES (SEE FOR EXAMPLE: HOSLER, PRATT, SEN, BUCKENMEYER, SIMAO, BACK, SAVADATTI, KAHN, HUNT, ""HIGH PREVALENCE OF DIABETES AMONG INDO-GUYANESE ADULTS, SCHENECTADY, NEW YORK,"" PREVENTING CHRONIC DISEASE 2013; 10:120211) AND HELPED LEAD TO AWARDING OF A FEDERAL RACIAL AND ETHNIC APPROACHES TO COMMUNITY HEALTH (REACH) GRANT TO SCPHS IN 2010. THE INITIAL PLANNING STAGE OF THE REACH GRANT FUNDED AN EXTENSIVE COMMUNITY SURVEY OF DIABETES PREVALENCE, PILOT TRAINING OF A DOZEN INDIGENOUS DIABETES HEALTH PROMOTERS, AN ELEMENTARY SCHOOL DIABETES PREVENTION EDUCATION PROGRAM, AND A DIABETES HEALTH SCREENING PROGRAM FOR AT-RISK WEST INDIAN RESIDENTS. THE WEST INDIAN DIABETES ACTION COALITION UTILIZED A MAPP PROCESS TO DEVELOP A COMMUNITY ACTION PLAN (CAP). UNFORTUNATELY, SHIFTING PRIORITIES AT THE CENTERS FOR DISEASE CONTROL (CDC) ENDED FUNDING FOR THE PROJECT BEFORE ITS IMPLEMENTATION PHASE. IN 2014, SCPHS WAS AWARDED A ""PARTNERSHIPS TO IMPROVE COMMUNITY HEALTH"" (PICH) GRANT, FUNDED BY THE CDC. ONE OF THE GOALS OF THIS GRANT IS TO INCREASE SCREENING RATES FOR TYPE-2 DIABETES IN THE WEST INDIAN POPULATION THAT ARE SEEN AT ELLIS FAMILY HEALTH CENTER, AN ELLIS MEDICINE PRIMARY CARE SITE.SEE SCHEDULE O."

FOR 2018, FOR AHHC, THE ALLOWANCE FOR DOUBTFUL ACCOUNTS COVERED 19.98% OF NET PATIENT ACCOUNTS RECEIVABLE. PATIENT ACCOUNTS RECEIVABLE ARE STATED AT NET REALIZABLE VALUE. AHHC EVALUATES THE COLLECTABILITY OF ITS ACCOUNTS RECEIVABLE BASED ON THE LENGTH OF TIME THE RECEIVABLE IS OUTSTANDING, PAYER CLASS, HISTORICAL COLLECTION EXPERIENCE, AND TRENDS IN HEALTH CARE INSURANCE PROGRAMS. ACCOUNTS RECEIVABLE ARE CHARGED TO THE ALLOWANCE FOR UNCOLLECTIBLE ACCOUNTS WHEN THEY ARE DEEMED UNCOLLECTIBLE.THE COSTING METHODOLOGY USED IN DETERMINING THE AMOUNTS REPORTED ON LINES 2 AND 3 IS BASED ON THE RATIO OF PATIENT CARE COST TO CHARGES. THE UNREIMBURSED COST OF BAD DEBT WAS CALCULATED BY APPLYING THE ORGANIZATION'S COST TO CHARGE RATIO FROM THE MEDICARE COST REPORTS (CMS 2252-96 WORKSHEET C, PART 1, PPS INPATIENT RATIOS) TO THE ORGANIZATION'S BAD DEBT PROVISION PER GENERALLY ACCEPTED ACCOUNTING PRINCIPLES, LESS ANY PATIENT OR THIRD PARTY PAYOR PAYMENTS RECEIVED.ADVOCATE MAKES EVERY EFFORT TO IDENTIFY THOSE PATIENTS WHO ARE ELIGIBLE FOR FINANCIAL ASSISTANCE BY STRICTLY ADHERING TO ITS FINANCIAL ASSISTANCE POLICY. WE BELIEVE THAT ADVOCATE HAS A POPULATION OF PATIENTS WHO ARE UNINSURED OR UNDERINSURED BUT WHO DO NOT COMPLETE THE FINANCIAL ASSISTANCE APPLICATION. THE ESTIMATED AMOUNT OF BAD DEBT EXPENSE (AT COST) WHICH COULD BE REASONABLY ATTRIBUTABLE TO PATIENTS WHO WOULD LIKELY QUALIFY FOR FINANCIAL ASSISTANCE UNDER THE ORGANIZATION'S FINANCIAL ASSISTANCE POLICY, IF SUFFICIENT INFORMATION HAD BEEN AVAILABLE TO MAKE A DETERMINATION OF THEIR ELIGIBILITY, WAS BASED UPON SELF PAY PATIENT ACCOUNTS WHICH HAD AMOUNTS WRITTEN OFF TO BAD DEBTS. OUR METHOD WAS TO BEGIN WITH THE SELF-PAY PORTION OF BAD DEBT EXPENSE PROVISION. THE SELF-PAY PORTION EXCLUDES THOSE PATIENTS WHO HAD FINANCIAL ASSISTANCE APPLICATIONS PENDING AT THE TIME OF SERVICE. THIS COST WAS THEN REDUCED BY CHARGES IDENTIFIED AS TRUE BAD DEBT EXPENSE, INCLUDING COPAYS FOR PATIENTS WHO QUALIFIED FOR LESS THAN 100% FINANCIAL ASSISTANCE. THE COST TO CHARGE RATIO WAS THEN APPLIED TO THE REMAINING CHARGES, TO DETERMINE THE VALUE (AT COST) OF PATIENT ACCOUNTS THAT DID NOT COMPLETE FINANCIAL COUNSELING AND WERE ASSIGNED TO BAD DEBT. WE BELIEVE THIS PROCESS IS A REASONABLE BASIS FOR OUR ESTIMATE. AS WE ARE ONLY CONSIDERING SELF-PAY ACCOUNTS WRITTEN OFF TO BAD DEBT FOR THIS ESTIMATE, THIS ESTIMATE DOES NOT INCLUDE THE IMMEDIATE 20% DISCOUNT TO CHARGES WHICH IS APPLIED TO ALL SELF-PAY PATIENTS. IT ALSO DOES NOT INCLUDE ACCOUNT BALANCES OR CO-PAYS OF NON-SELF PAY ACCOUNTS WHICH ARE WRITTEN OFF TO BAD DEBT WHEN THE PATIENT HAS NO OTHER FINANCIAL RESOURCES TO PAY THESE AMOUNTS AND THE PATIENT DOES NOT APPLY FOR FINANCIAL ASSISTANCE.BAD DEBT AMOUNTS HAVE BEEN EXCLUDED FROM OTHER COMMUNITY BENEFIT AMOUNTS REPORTED THROUGHOUT SCHEDULE H."

201943199349321899,362169147,"PART VI, LINE 5:","ADVOCATE BROMENN'S DEDICATION TO PROMOTING THE HEALTH OF THE COMMUNITY IS EXEMPLIFIED IN NUMEROUS WAYS. THE GOVERNING COUNCIL AT ADVOCATE BROMENN IS COMPRISED OF LOCAL COMMUNITY LEADERS AND PHYSICIANS. GOVERNING COUNCIL MEMBERS SUPPORT HOSPITAL LEADERSHIP IN THEIR PURSUIT OF THE HOSPITAL'S GOALS, REPRESENT THE COMMUNITY'S INTEREST TO THE HOSPITAL AND SERVE AS AMBASSADORS IN THE COMMUNITY. SEVENTY-EIGHT PERCENT OF THE CURRENT GOVERNING COUNCIL MEMBERS REPRESENT THE COMMUNITY. IN ADDITION, THE ORGANIZATION EXTENDS MEDICAL STAFF PRIVILEGES TO ALL QUALIFIED PHYSICIANS IN ITS COMMUNITY FOR SOME OR ALL OF ITS DEPARTMENTS AND SPECIALTIES.A VAST MAJORITY OF THE HOSPITAL'S EXECUTIVE OR LEADERSHIP TEAM ALSO SERVE ON MULTIPLE COMMUNITY BOARDS THAT HELP EITHER DIRECTLY OR INDIRECTLY IMPROVE THE HEALTH OF THE COMMUNITY, INCLUDING, BUT NOT LIMITED TO - UNITED WAY, MCLEAN COUNTY GOVERNMENT BEHAVIORAL HEALTH COORDINATING COUNCIL, HABITAT FOR HUMANITY, FAITH IN ACTION, KIWANIS, COMMUNITY HEALTH CARE CLINIC, JOHN M. SCOTT HEALTH COMMISSION, AMERICAN RED CROSS, BOYS AND GIRLS CLUB, MCLEAN COUNTY CHAMBER OF COMMERCE, MCLEAN COUNTY BOARD OF HEALTH, RECOVERY COURT, PROMISE COUNCIL OF MCLEAN COUNTY, HEARTLAND COMMUNITY COLLEGE FOUNDATION, MCLEAN COUNTY'S TRANSPORTATION ADVISORY COUNCIL, MCLEAN COUNTY SENIOR SERVICES COALITION AND THE ECONOMIC DEVELOPMENT COUNCIL.

THE PRESIDENT AND OTHER MEMBERS OF THE EXECUTIVE TEAM PROVIDE LEADERSHIP TRAINING IN THE COMMUNITY TO GROUPS SUCH AS THE MULTICULTURAL LEADERSHIP PROGRAM AND LEADERSHIP MCLEAN COUNTY. IN ADDITION, A MEMBER OF ADVOCATE BROMENN'S LEADERSHIP TEAM TRAINS STUDENTS FROM THE BLOOMINGTON AREA CAREER CENTER AND ILLINOIS WESLEYAN UNIVERSITY ON THE HEALTH INSURANCE PORTABILITY AND ACCOUNTABILITY ACT TO HELP PREPARE THE STUDENTS TO TAKE THE CERTIFIED NURSING ASSISTANT EXAM.ANOTHER KEY AREA IN WHICH THE HOSPITAL CONTRIBUTES SIGNIFICANTLY TO THE HEALTH OF THE COMMUNITY AND FURTHERS ITS EXEMPT STATUS IS THE COMMUNITY HEALTH CARE CLINIC. IN 1993, ADVOCATE BROMENN PARTNERED WITH OSF HEALTHCARE ST. JOSEPH MEDICAL CENTER, ALSO LOCATED IN MCLEAN COUNTY, TO OPEN THE COMMUNITY HEALTH CARE CLINIC. THE COMMUNITY HEALTH CARE CLINIC PROVIDES SERVICES TO THE MEDICALLY UNDERSERVED POPULATION OF MCLEAN COUNTY TO ENSURE THAT ALL POPULATIONS IN THE COMMUNITY HAVE ACCESS TO HEALTHCARE. TO BE ELIGIBLE FOR CARE AT THE CLINIC, AN INDIVIDUAL MUST HAVE A TOTAL HOUSEHOLD INCOME LESS THAN 185 PERCENT OF FEDERAL POVERTY GUIDELINES, HAVE NO ACCESS TO THIRD PARTY INSURANCE (MEDICAID, MEDICARE, ALL KIDS, VETERAN'S BENEFITS, DISABILITY OR EMPLOYER-SPONSORED INSURANCE) AND RESIDE IN MCLEAN COUNTY. ALL EMERGENCY ROOM VISITS, DIAGNOSTIC TESTING AND HOSPITAL SERVICES ARE PROVIDED FREE OF CHARGE BY ADVOCATE BROMENN AND OSF HEALTHCARE ST. JOSEPH MEDICAL CENTER. THE COMMUNITY HEALTH CARE CLINIC SAW 1,110 PATIENTS IN 2018, PROVIDED 3,279 PATIENT VISITS AND PRESCRIBED OVER 24,065 PRESCRIPTION MEDICATIONS AT NO CHARGE TO UNINSURED INDIVIDUALS. THE CLINIC IS IN A BUILDING OWNED BY ADVOCATE BROMENN, FOR WHICH THE HOSPITAL PAID $82,638 FOR THE MAINTENANCE AND UPKEEP OF THE FACILITY IN 2018. IN ADDITION TO THE ABOVE, ADVOCATE BROMENN SERVES AS AN EMERGENCY MEDICAL SERVICES (EMS) RESOURCE FOR EDUCATION AND TRAINING FOR MCLEAN COUNTY, PROVIDING A $226,026 BENEFIT TO THE COMMUNITY IN 2018. THE HOSPITAL ALSO CONTRIBUTES TO THE HEALTH OF THE COMMUNITY BY MAINTAINING AND OFFERING COMMUNITY MEMBERS, NURSING STUDENTS, RESIDENTS, PHYSICIANS AND OTHER HEALTH CARE PROFESSIONALS' ACCESS TO THE A.E. LIVINGSTON HEALTH SERVICES LIBRARY. THIS ACCESS IS PROVIDED FREE OF CHARGE TO THESE INDIVIDUALS. THE COST OF $72,909 FOR THIS SERVICE, IN 2018, WAS ABSORBED BY THE HOSPITAL. ADVOCATE BROMENN IS ALSO AN AMERICAN HEART ASSOCIATION TRAINING CENTER FOR THE COMMUNITY. THE COST OF PROVIDING THIS SERVICE IS $73,796. THE NUMEROUS OTHER WAYS ADVOCATE BROMENN PROMOTES THE HEALTH OF THE COMMUNITY RANGE FROM PROVIDING PET THERAPY AND CLINICAL PASTORAL EDUCATION PROGRAMS TO OFFERING MEETING SPACE TO COMMUNITY NOT-FOR-PROFIT GROUPS AND BEING A TEACHING HOSPITAL FOR BOTH FAMILY PRACTICE, NEUROLOGY AND NEUROSURGERY RESIDENTS.ADVOCATE BROMENN HAD A FEW SIGNIFICANT CAPITAL PROJECTS THAT BEGAN OR WERE COMPLETED IN 2018 THAT IMPROVED PATIENT CARE OR CONTRIBUTED TO A HEALTHIER COMMUNITY ENVIRONMENT. IN 2018, THE BIOFIRE ANALYZER, THAT IS NOW IN PLACE IN ADVOCATE BROMENN'S MICROBIOLOGY DEPARTMENT, ENABLES THE LAB TO DECREASE TURNAROUND TIMES FOR THE IDENTIFICATION OF PATHOGENS CAUSING BLOOD STREAM INFECTIONS. THIS ANALYZER CAN PROVIDE A DEFINITIVE IDENTIFICATION OF THE ORGANISM(S) CAUSING SUCH INFECTIONS IN ONE HOUR FROM THE START OF THE TEST. WITH CONVENTIONAL TESTING, PLATING A POSITIVE BLOOD CULTURE SPECIMEN TO SPECIFIC AGAR PLATES, WOULD TAKE FROM 15 TO 36 HOURS TO GET THE SAME RESULT. WITH THIS NEW TECHNOLOGY, THE FASTER IDENTIFICATION OF THE ORGANISM ALLOWS FOR COST SAVINGS TO THE PATIENT AND ADVOCATE AURORA HEALTH BY STREAMLINING ANTIMICROBIAL THERAPY FASTER. THIS HAS ALSO SHOWN TO INCREASE POSITIVE PATIENT OUTCOMES, DECREASE DAYS OF ANTIMICROBIAL THERAPY, ALL OF WHICH CAN ULTIMATELY LEAD TO DECREASED LENGTH OF STAY. ADDITIONALLY, IF THE ORGANISM IDENTIFIED IS ONE THAT CONTAINS AN ANTIMICROBIAL RESISTANT GENE, THIS WILL BE IDENTIFIED AS WELL, AGAIN LEADING TO FASTER AND MORE APPROPRIATE THERAPY. IN 2018, THE LAB ALSO ADDED CEREBRAL SPINAL FLUID (CSF) PATHOGEN TESTING. BEING ABLE TO QUICKLY IDENTIFY A POSSIBLE PATHOGEN QUICKLY IN CSF SPECIMENS ALSO ENHANCES TREATMENT TO IMPROVE PATIENT OUTCOMES. ANOTHER CAPITAL PROJECT COMPLETED IN 2018 THAT IMPROVES PATIENT CARE IS MERCI (MEDICAL EMERGENCY RADIO COMMUNICATIONS FOR ILLINOIS). MERCI IS A VITAL TWO-WAY COMMUNICATION TOOL USED BY EMERGENCY MEDICAL SERVICE (EMS) AGENCIES AND HOSPITALS. INCOMING EMS AGENCIES TRANSMIT PATIENT INFORMATION TO THE HOSPITAL PRIOR TO THEIR ARRIVAL INCLUDING PATIENT CONDITION, CURRENT VITAL SIGNS AND CHIEF COMPLAINT. THE EMERGENCY DEPARTMENT'S RADIO REGISTERED NURSE THEN HAS AN OPPORTUNITY TO ASK CLARIFYING QUESTIONS AND/OR TO GIVE MEDICAL DIRECTION/ORDERS FOR ADDITIONAL TREATMENT OR INTERVENTIONS BEFORE THE PATIENT ARRIVES. EARLY NOTIFICATION FOR PATIENTS THAT HAVE TIME-SENSITIVE CONDITIONS (STROKE, HEART ATTACK) ALLOWS THE EMERGENCY DEPARTMENT TO HAVE VITAL SERVICES AVAILABLE TO MEET THE PATIENT UPON ARRIVAL WHICH LEADS TO BETTER PATIENT OUTCOMES. A THIRD CAPITAL PROJECT COMPLETED IN 2018 THAT IMPROVES PATIENT CARE IS THE RENOVATION OF THE ACUTE REHABILITATION UNITY THERAPY GYM AT ADVOCATE BROMENN. THE GYM HAS BEEN REBUILT INTO A SIMULATED LIVING ENVIRONMENT IN A $450,000 PROJECT. THE SIMULATED LIVING OR HOME ENVIRONMENT HELPS PATIENTS AND PATIENT OUTCOMES BECAUSE IT IS DESIGNED TO BETTER PREPARE REHABILITATION PATIENTS FOR THEIR TRANSITION TO HOME. THE RENOVATION ALSO ALLOWS FOR PHYSICAL, OCCUPATIONAL AND SPEECH THERAPY TO BE WORKED ON TOGETHER RATHER THAN IN SEGMENTED SESSIONS. THE SIMULATED ENVIRONMENT INCLUDES A FUNCTIONING KITCHEN WITH A TABLE AND ADAPTIVE UTENSILS, A LOWER COUNTER, A LIVING ROOM, A LAUNDRY ROOM, STAIRS, A FRONT PORCH AND A BEDROOM. ADVOCATE BROMENN ALSO PROMOTES THE ENVIRONMENTAL HEALTH OF THE COMMUNITY. IN 2018, THE MEDICAL CENTER EARNED THE GREENHEALTH EMERALD AWARD. THE AWARD IS EARNED BY HOSPITALS THAT HAVE DEMONSTRATED A STRONG COMMITMENT TO SUSTAINABILITY AND SHOWN LEADERSHIP IN THE LOCAL COMMUNITY AND IN THE HEALTH CARE SECTOR. AWARD WINNERS ARE SETTING THE STANDARD IN ELIMINATING MERCURY, REDUCING AND RECYCLING WASTE, SUSTAINABLE SOURCING AND OTHER AREAS. IN 2018, ADVOCATE BROMENN ALSO RECEIVED A CIRCLE OF EXCELLENCE AWARD FOR CHEMICALS. THIS AWARD RECOGNIZES THE HOSPITAL AS ONE OF THE TOP TEN PERFORMERS OF THE HIGHEST PERFORMING HOSPITALS NATIONWIDE IN THIS AREA OF SUSTAINABILITY EXPERTISE.LASTLY, ADVOCATE BROMENN IS INVOLVED IN COMMUNITY BUILDING ACTIVITIES. NOT IN OUR TOWN AND UNITED WAY OF MCLEAN COUNTY, WITH SUPPORT FROM THE CITY OF BLOOMINGTON, TOWN OF NORMAL AND ADVOCATE BROMENN, HOSTED A COMMUNITY EVENT, ""BUILDING OPPORTUNITIES FOR OUR COMMUNITY'S YOUNG PEOPLE"" IN RESPONSE TO THE RISE IN YOUTH VIOLENCE IN BLOOMINGTON AND NORMAL. TWO MEMBERS OF ADVOCATE BROMENN'S EXECUTIVE LEADERSHIP TEAM ALSO PRESENTED AT UNITED WAY'S ""BREAKFAST CLUB"" TO AT-RISK YOUTH ABOUT EMPLOYMENT OPPORTUNITIES IN HEALTHCARE. IN PARTNERSHIP WITH AN AT-RISK YOUTH EMPLOYMENT PROGRAM WITH PROJECT OZ, ADVOCATE BROMENN HAS SCREENED SEVERAL CANDIDATES FOR EMPLOYMENT AND HAS HIRED A NURSING TECH."

ADVOCATE'S BOARD, LEADERSHIP AND TEAM MEMBERS (STAFF/EMPLOYEES) ARE COMMITTED TO POSITIVELY AFFECTING THE HEALTH STATUS AND QUALITY OF LIFE OF INDIVIDUALS AND POPULATIONS IN COMMUNITIES SERVED BY ADVOCATE THROUGH PROGRAMS AND PRACTICES THAT REFLECT THIS MISSION. THE ORGANIZATION CONTINUES TO DEVELOP AND SUPPORT INITIATIVES THAT ENHANCE ACCESS TO HEALTH AND WELLNESS SERVICES. AS SUCH, SYSTEM LEADERSHIP DIRECTS AND SUPPORTS THE HOSPITALS IN THEIR EFFORTS TO ADDRESS IDENTIFIED COMMUNITY HEALTH NEEDS.IN 2016, ADVOCATE CREATED A COMMUNITY HEALTH DEPARTMENT THAT IS LED BY A SYSTEM EXECUTIVE AND STAFFED WITH PUBLIC/COMMUNITY HEALTH SPECIALISTS TO EXECUTE COMMUNITY NEEDS ASSESSMENTS, EVIDENCE-BASED PROGRAM DEVELOPMENT AND COLLABORATIVE PARTNERSHIPS WITHIN THE COMMUNITIES SERVED BY ADVOCATE. PRIOR TO THIS TIME, THE COMMUNITY FACING FUNCTION WAS LED BY A TEAM OF SYSTEM-LEVEL INDIVIDUALS WHOSE JOB RESPONSIBILITIES INCLUDED VARIOUS COMMUNITY ROLES MORE CLOSELY ALIGNED WITH COMMUNITY RELATIONS. DURING THE INITIAL 2011-2013 COMMUNITY HEALTH NEEDS ASSESSMENT (CHNA) CYCLE, THE SYSTEM LEADERS PROVIDED OVERSIGHT AND SUPPORT TO THE HOSPITALS FOR DEVELOPING THEIR CHNAS AND SUBSEQUENT PROGRAMMING. IN 2016, ADVOCATE'S NEW COMMUNITY HEALTH TEAM CONDUCTED THEIR HOSPITAL'S COMPREHENSIVE CHNAS (2014-2016) AND POSTED GOVERNANCE-APPROVED CHNA REPORTS AND CHNA IMPLEMENTATION PLANS ON ADVOCATE'S WEBPAGE IN COMPLIANCE WITH THE AFFORDABLE CARE ACT.AT THE DIRECTION OF THE SYSTEM LEVEL, COMMUNITY HEALTH DEPARTMENT LEADERSHIP ALSO MET MONTHLY IN LATE 2016 THROUGH FIRST QUARTER 2017 TO SIGNIFICANTLY REVISE ADVOCATE HEALTH CARE'S COMMUNITY BENEFITS PLAN. THE PLANS GOALS AND OBJECTIVES WERE CRAFTED AND EXPANDED TO BUILD ON RECENT LEARNINGS AND INCREASED FOCUS ON COMMUNITY HEALTH. THE PLAN'S BROAD GOALS AND OBJECTIVES WERE DESIGNED TO STRUCTURE SYSTEM-WIDE COMMUNITY BENEFITS ACTIVITIES WITHIN A STRATEGIC FRAMEWORK. INCLUDED IN THE COMMUNITY BENEFITS PLAN ARE GOALS FOCUSED ON SYSTEM-WIDE EFFORTS TO ADDRESS THE BROADER ISSUES OF DISPARITY AND ACCESS, AND TO ALIGN HOSPITAL COMMUNITY HEALTH PLANS WITH SYSTEM STRATEGY AS COMMUNITY HEALTH PLANS AND IMPLEMENTATION STRATEGIES EVOLVE. ADVOCATE'S COMMUNITY BENEFITS PLAN ALSO SETS THE COURSE FOR STRENGTHENING EXISTING PARTNERSHIPS AND BUILDING NEW ONES TO LEVERAGE AND MAXIMIZE THE IMPACT OF ADVOCATE'S PROGRAMS IN ITS SERVICE AREAS. ADVOCATE'S COMMUNITY BENEFITS PLAN GOALS AND SPECIFIC EXAMPLES OF PROGRAMS AND SERVICES THAT ARE DIRECTED AND MANAGED AT THE SYSTEM LEVEL ARE PROVIDED BELOW.GOAL A: OPTIMIZE ADVOCATE'S CAPACITY TO MANAGE AN EFFECTIVE COMMUNITY HEALTH STRATEGY BY IMPLEMENTING REGULAR COMMUNITY HEALTH ASSESSMENTS (CHNAS) AND USING DATA FROM THESE ASSESSMENTS TO GUIDE PROGRAM DEVELOPMENT.DURING 2016, ALL ELEVEN ADVOCATE HEALTH CARE HOSPITALS COMPLETED COMPREHENSIVE COMMUNITY HEALTH NEEDS ASSESSMENTS IN COLLABORATION WITH HEALTH DEPARTMENTS, OTHER HOSPITALS, AND COMMUNITY ORGANIZATIONS. ADVOCATE CHILDREN'S HOSPITAL, WITH INTEGRATED SITES AT BOTH ADVOCATE LUTHERAN GENERAL HOSPITAL (ADVOCATE LUTHERAN GENERAL) AND ADVOCATE CHRIST MEDICAL CENTER (ADVOCATE CHRIST), CONTRIBUTED TO ASSESSMENTS AT THOSE TWO HOSPITALS. ALL THE ADVOCATE HOSPITAL ASSESSMENTS ARE AVAILABLE THROUGH THE ADVOCATE WEBSITE AT: HTTP://WWW.ADVOCATEHEALTH.COM/CHNAREPORTSAS A FIRST STEP TOWARD DEVELOPING A 2017-2019 IMPLEMENTATION PLAN, THE SYSTEM DIRECTED THE HOSPITAL COMMUNITY HEALTH LEADERS AND STAFF TO IDENTIFY THE STRENGTHS AND OPPORTUNITIES FOR IMPROVEMENT WITHIN THE JUST COMPLETED CYCLE (2014-2016), AS WELL AS IDEAS FOR NEW DATA SOURCES, AND NEEDS FOR PROFESSIONAL DEVELOPMENT RELATED TO THE OVERALL CHNA PROCESS. A NUMBER OF STRENGTHS WERE IDENTIFIED INCLUDING DEVELOPMENT OF LOCAL COMMUNITY HEALTH COUNCILS (CHC), INVOLVEMENT OF HOSPITAL GOVERNING COUNCIL MEMBERS IN THE CHCS, PARTNERSHIPS WITH HEALTH DEPARTMENTS, DATA FROM CONDUENT-HEALTHY COMMUNITIES INSTITUTE, ESPECIALLY THE ZIP CODE LEVEL HOSPITALIZATION AND EMERGENCY ROOM UTILIZATION DATA, AND THE SHARING OF TEMPLATES AND APPROACHES ACROSS HOSPITAL SITES. ADDITIONAL PROFESSIONAL DEVELOPMENT REGARDING DATA RETRIEVAL, ANALYSIS AND SUMMARIZATION, AS WELL AS PROGRAM DEVELOPMENT, WERE IDENTIFIED. A PROFESSIONAL DEVELOPMENT PLAN WAS IMPLEMENTED FOR ALL INTERNAL COMMUNITY HEALTH STAFF IN 2017. CHNA DATA TRAINING WAS CONDUCTED USING THE HEALTHY COMMUNITIES INSTITUTE (HCI) PLATFORM WITH THE TEAM RECEIVING TRAINING REGARDING RUNNING VARIOUS TYPES OF REPORTS AND CROSS COMPARING DATA IN HCI. UPDATE PRESENTATIONS WERE HELD AT SELECTED MONTHLY STAFF MEETINGS REGARDING NEW CAPACITIES OF THE HCI PLATFORM FOR REPORTS AND DATA PRESENTATION. ADDITIONALLY, ALL STAFF PROVIDED INPUT REGARDING TRAINING NEEDS RESULTING IN THE ESTABLISHMENT OF A SET OF MINIMUM STANDARD DATA REQUIREMENTS ADVOCATE IS NOW USING FOR THE NEXT CHNA CYCLE. COMMUNITY HEALTH STAFF PULLED DATA AS PART OF LEARNING EXERCISES AND SHARED FINDINGS FROM THEIR UNIQUE SERVICE AREAS WITH PEERS IN A PEER REVIEW MODEL. IN 2018, TRAINING FOCUSED ON DATA ANALYSIS, DATA INTERPRETATION AND PROGRAM DEVELOPMENT AND EVALUATION. GOAL B: UNDERTAKE OR SUPPORT INITIATIVES THAT ENHANCE ACCESS TO HEALTH CARE, PREVENTION AND WELLNESS SERVICES ACROSS THE LIFESPAN AND WITHIN THE DIVERSE COMMUNITIES ADVOCATE SERVES.CHARITY CARE. AS A NON-PROFIT HEALTH CARE SYSTEM, ADVOCATE PROVIDES CHARITY AND FINANCIAL ASSISTANCE TO PATIENTS IN NEED. ALTHOUGH ADVOCATE'S SYSTEM-WIDE CHARITY CARE POLICY IS VERY GENEROUS, ADVOCATE CONTINUES TO REVIEW AND REFINE ITS POLICY IN AN ONGOING EFFORT TO ENSURE THAT FINANCIAL ASSISTANCE IS AVAILABLE TO THOSE IN NEED IN A TIMELY MANNER. WHILE EACH HOSPITAL HAS A CHARITY CARE COUNCIL TO REVIEW APPLICATIONS AND DETERMINE ELIGIBILITY, SYSTEM FINANCE LEADERS ARE RESPONSIBLE FOR ONGOING POLICY REVIEW AND REFINEMENTS TO ASSURE THAT ADVOCATE CONTINUES TO PROVIDE FINANCIAL ASSISTANCE TO INDIVIDUALS WHO NEED HELP, WHEN THEY NEED IT. FEDERALLY QUALIFIED HEALTH CENTERS (FQHC). IN ADDITION, ADVOCATE'S SYSTEM LEADERS ENCOURAGE AND SUPPORT ITS HOSPITALS' INITIATIVES TO PARTNER WITH FQHC'S, PUBLIC HEALTH DEPARTMENTS AND COMMUNITY CLINICS IN ORDER TO ASSIST THE UNINSURED IN FINDING INSURANCE COVERAGE AND MEDICAL SERVICES. FOR EXAMPLE, ADVOCATE SOUTH SUBURBAN HOSPITAL (ADVOCATE SOUTH SUBURBAN) HAS A PARTNERSHIP WITH AUNT MARTHA'S YOUTH SERVICE CENTER, AN FQHC, TO IMPROVE ACCESS TO PRIMARY CARE SERVICES FOR UNINSURED AND UNDERINSURED INDIVIDUALS IN ITS SERVICE AREA. ADVOCATE BROMENN MEDICAL CENTER (ADVOCATE BROMENN) MAINTAINS A COMMUNITY HEALTH CLINIC IN COLLABORATION WITH OSF ST. JOSEPH'S HOSPITAL, WHEREBY ADVOCATE BROMENN IS RESPONSIBLE FOR A PORTION OF THE HOSPITAL CARE FOR THE CLINIC PATIENTS' HOSPITAL CARE THROUGHOUT THE YEAR. ADVOCATE BROMENN IS ALSO THE SOLE PROVIDER OF THE CLINIC'S INFORMATION TECHNOLOGY (IT) SUPPORT AND PROVIDES THE SPACE OCCUPIED BY THE CLINIC. IN ADDITION, ADVOCATE BROMENN, THROUGH AN INFORMAL REFERRAL AGREEMENT IN PLACE SINCE 2010, COLLABORATES WITH CHESTNUT HEALTH SYSTEMS. CHESTNUT HEALTH SYSTEMS OWNS AND OPERATES AN FQHC IN BLOOMINGTON AND PATIENTS ARE SOMETIMES REFERRED TO ADVOCATE BROMENN FOR SERVICES. WORKING WITH OTHER AREA HOSPITALS, ADVOCATE GOOD SAMARITAN HOSPITAL (ADVOCATE GOOD SAMARITAN) PROVIDES SUPPORT THROUGH THE DUPAGE HEALTH COALITION TO SUSTAIN THE ACCESS DUPAGE COMMUNITY PROGRAM - A COMMUNITY COLLABORATION DESIGNED TO PROVIDE LOW-COST PRIMARY MEDICAL CARE SERVICES TO THE LOW-INCOME, MEDICALLY UNINSURED RESIDENTS OF DUPAGE COUNTY. IN ADDITION, THE HOSPITAL PARTNERS WITH THE DUPAGE COUNTY HEALTH DEPARTMENT'S ENGAGE DUPAGE INITIATIVE FOR INDIGENT PATIENT FINANCIAL ELIGIBILITY IN THE EMERGENCY ROOM AND TO ASSIST WITH OUTPLACEMENT SERVICES FOR THOSE PATIENTS WHO COULD BENEFIT FROM TREATMENT PROGRAMS, PLACEMENT WITH A PRIMARY CARE PROVIDER (PCP), DENTAL CARE, ETC.ADVOCATE ALSO WORKS TO IMPROVE THE PROVISION OF SERVICES TO INDIVIDUALS AND FAMILIES WHO ARE COVERED BY MEDICARE AND MEDICAID AND SEEK SERVICES FROM ADVOCATE'S OVER 400 SITES OF CARE. ADVOCATE COLLABORATES WITH VARIOUS COMMUNITY-BASED ORGANIZATIONS (CBO'S) AND FQHC'S IN INNOVATIVE WAYS TO ESTABLISH PRIMARY CARE RELATIONSHIPS FOR MEDICAID AND UNINSURED PATIENTS."
201943199349321899,362169147,"PART VI, LINE 6:","6. AFFILIATED HEALTH CARE SYSTEM- CONTINUEDADVOCATE CARE ORGANIZATION (ACO). AS ONE OF THE LARGEST PROVIDERS OF HEALTH CARE SERVICES TO MEDICARE AND MEDICAID PATIENTS IN CHICAGO AND THE SURROUNDING SUBURBS, ADVOCATE'S MEDICAID ACCOUNTABLE CARE ORGANIZATION (ACO), ALSO KNOWN AS THE ADVOCATE ACCOUNTABLE CARE ENTITY (ACE), TRANSITIONED TO MERIDIAN FAMILY HEALTH PLAN (FHP) OF ILLINOIS AS PART OF AN INTEGRATED CARE MODEL ON APRIL 1, 2016. THE ADVOCATE/MERIDIAN FHP PARTNERSHIP AND COLLABORATION WAS DRIVEN LARGELY BY CHANGES TO THE MEDICAID PROGRAM IN ILLINOIS AND WAS DESIGNED TO ENSURE CURRENT MEDICAID MEMBERS CONTINUE TO RECEIVE HIGH-QUALITY AND WELL-COORDINATED CARE DELIVERED IN AN APPROPRIATE SETTING. ADVOCATE HAS A STRONG HISTORY OF PROVIDING HIGH QUALITY CARE FOR THE MEDICAID POPULATION WITHIN OUR NETWORK WITH KEY FOCUS AREAS, INCLUDING IMPROVED CARE COORDINATION, ACCESS AND QUALITY PERFORMANCE. ADVOCATE HAS AND WILL CONTINUE TO APPLY ITS ACHIEVEMENTS AND LESSONS LEARNED FROM ITS MEDICARE AND COMMERCIAL ACOS TO THE ADVOCATE/MERIDIAN FHP PARTNERSHIP.COMMUNITY HEALTH WORKERS (CHWS). IN 2016, ADVOCATE EMBARKED ON A QUALITY IMPROVEMENT PROJECT TO ENGAGE AND EDUCATE MEDICAID BENEFICIARIES SEEN IN THE ADVOCATE CHRIST EMERGENCY DEPARTMENT ON APPROPRIATE LEVEL OF CARE OPTIONS AVAILABLE TO THEM USING COMMUNITY HEALTH WORKERS. THE MAIN OBJECTIVES OF THE PRIMARY CARE CONNECTIONS INTERVENTION WERE: 1) TO EDUCATE AND SCHEDULE LOW ACUITY PATIENTS WHO VISIT THE ADVOCATE CHRIST EMERGENCY DEPARTMENT REGARDING ALTERNATIVE CARE OPTIONS AVAILABLE TO THEM WITHIN THEIR COMMUNITIES; AND 2) EDUCATE AND SCHEDULE LOW ACUITY MEDICAID PATIENTS FOR FOLLOW-UP APPOINTMENTS WITH THEIR ADVOCATE PRIMARY CARE PHYSICIAN (PCP) OR AN FQHC WHEN THE BENEFICIARY DOES NOT HAVE AN ESTABLISHED PRIMARY CARE MEDICAL HOME.FQHC'S AND COMMUNITY-BASED RESOURCES PROVIDE SERVICES FOR MEDICAID BENEFICIARIES WITH SPECIFIC SOCIAL DETERMINANTS OF HEALTH BARRIERS TO CARE, INCLUDING HOUSING INSECURITY, UTILITY NEEDS AND INTERPERSONAL VIOLENCE, WHICH ARE IMPORTANT TO ADDRESS FOR IMPROVING OUTCOMES FOR VULNERABLE POPULATIONS. IN 2018, THE PROGRAM WAS EXPANDED TO THREE ADDITIONAL ILLINOIS HOSPITALS-ADVOCATE TRINITY HOSPITAL (ADVOCATE TRINITY), ADVOCATE CONDELL MEDICAL CENTER (ADVOCATE CONDELL) AND ADVOCATE SHERMAN HOSPITAL (ADVOCATE SHERMAN). AS OF DEC. 2018, MORE THAN 20,560 PATIENTS WERE ENGAGED, OF WHICH 30% (OVER 6,100 PATIENTS) WERE SCHEDULED FOR A FOLLOW-UP APPOINTMENT WITH AN ADVOCATE PCP OR FQHC. AS A RESULT, 98% OF THESE PATIENTS WHO WERE ENGAGED WITH THE PRIMARY CARE CONNECTION INTERVENTION DID NOT RETURN TO THE EMERGENCY ROOM FOR A LOW ACUITY VISIT.ADVOCATE CONTINUES TO PURSUE QUALITY AND UTILIZATION IMPROVEMENT ACTIVITIES LIKE THE PRIMARY CARE CONNECTIONS INTERVENTION TO ACTIVELY MANAGE AND ENGAGE THE ADVOCATE/MERIDIAN FHP MEMBERS IN ORDER TO ACHIEVE THE QUADRUPLE AIM OF IMPROVED PHYSICIAN AND PATIENT EXPERIENCE, BETTER PATIENT OUTCOMES, AND REDUCTIONS IN THE TOTAL COSTS OF CARE.LANGUAGE SERVICES. ADVOCATE IS ALSO COMMITTED TO PROVIDING ITS PATIENTS AND FAMILIES WITH LANGUAGE AND OTHER CULTURALLY APPROPRIATE SERVICES TO IMPROVE ACCESS TO CARE. A SYSTEM-LEVEL DIRECTOR HAS OVERSIGHT OF LANGUAGE SERVICES THROUGHOUT ADVOCATE. ADVOCATE'S PATIENT ACCESS DEPARTMENT MONITORS AND REFINES ASSOCIATE SCRIPTING TO ENSURE THAT LANGUAGE NEED IS CORRECTLY IDENTIFIED DURING THE REGISTRATION PROCESS. THIS ASSISTS WITH CORRECTLY ROUNDING ON PATIENTS AND ENSURING INTERPRETERS ARE AVAILABLE WHEN NEEDED. IN 2018, ADVOCATE PROVIDED INTERPRETING SERVICES FOR OVER 250,000 PATIENT/FAMILY MEMBER/COMPANION ENCOUNTERS-UP FROM 220,000 ENCOUNTERS THE PREVIOUS YEAR. AS THE NEED FOR THESE SERVICES INCREASES, ADVOCATE CONTINUES TO ANTICIPATE AND IMPLEMENT CHANGES TO MEET THE UNIQUE INTERPRETATION NEEDS OF PATIENTS. ONE SUCH CHANGE, WHICH CONTINUES TO INCREASE THE VOLUME OF INTERPRETER SERVICES EACH YEAR, IS THE USE OF VIDEO REMOTE INTERPRETING (VRI). SIMILAR TO SKYPE TECHNOLOGY, WHEN A TEAM MEMBER (EMPLOYEE/STAFF) CLICKS OR TOUCHES THE SCREEN FOR A NEEDED LANGUAGE, AN INTERPRETER APPEARS ON THE COMPUTER OR IPAD SCREEN TO INTERPRET IN ONE OF 32 AVAILABLE LANGUAGES. IN ADDITION TO VRI, OVER 200 LANGUAGES ARE OFFERED VIA TELEPHONIC INTERPRETING. WHEN TELEPHONIC OR VRI ARE NOT APPROPRIATE FOR THE PATIENT ENCOUNTER, ONSITE AGENCY INTERPRETERS ARE PROVIDED. FIVE (5) ADVOCATE HOSPITALS EMPLOY SPANISH AND POLISH INTERPRETERS DUE TO THE HIGH VOLUME OF PATIENTS SPEAKING THESE LANGUAGES. ADVOCATE TYPICALLY ACCESSES OVER 150 DIFFERENT LANGUAGES PER YEAR TO MEET PATIENTS' NEEDS.IN 2018, A NEW FORM WAS ADDED TO CARE CONNECTION FOR THE NURSING ADMISSION PROCESS. THERE IS ALSO A FORM FOR LANGUAGE SERVICES TO INPUT ANY CHANGES NEEDED-CALLED AN AD HOC FORM. THE FORM SUPPORTS THE NURSE IN IDENTIFYING LANGUAGE ASSISTANCE NEEDS OF THE PATIENT AND FAMILY MEMBERS/COMPANION. VITAL DOCUMENTS CONTINUE TO BE TRANSLATED. SIGNAGE IS POSTED INDICATING THAT INTERPRETING SERVICES ARE AVAILABLE. SEVERAL HOSPITALS CONTINUE TO HAVE PATIENT WHITE BOARDS TRANSLATED INTO SPANISH AND POLISH WITH ENGLISH SUBTITLES SO THAT PATIENTS ARE AWARE OF THEIR PLAN FOR THE DAY IN THEIR LANGUAGE.TO EVALUATE HOW WELL THE SITES ARE DOING WITH PROVIDING INTERPRETING SERVICES, A RESPONSE TO THE STATEMENT, ""IF ENGLISH IS NOT YOUR PRIMARY LANGUAGE, THE DEGREE TO WHICH YOUR COMMUNICATION NEEDS WERE MET,"" IS REQUESTED ON NON-ENGLISH PRESS GANEY SURVEYS. THE PATIENT IS ASKED TO RATE THE SERVICES RECEIVED BETWEEN 1 AND 5, WITH 5 BEING THE HIGHEST SCORE. CURRENTLY THREE HOSPITALS-ADVOCATE CHRIST, ADVOCATE ILLINOIS MASONIC MEDICAL CENTER (ADVOCATE ILLINOIS MASONIC) AND ADVOCATE LUTHERAN GENERAL-PARTICIPATE. THE AVERAGE SCORE FOR 2018 REMAINED AT 89% FAVORABLE. GIVEN THE LOW RATE OF RETURN, THIS NUMBER IS NOT CONSIDERED TO BE STATISTICALLY SIGNIFICANT.THE READMISSION RATE OF NON-ENGLISH SPEAKING PATIENTS IS ALSO TRACKED AND COMPARED TO THE READMISSION RATE OF ENGLISH-SPEAKING PATIENTS. THE NON-ENGLISH READMISSION RATE CONTINUES TO BE CLOSE TO THE ENGLISH-SPEAKING PATIENT READMISSION RATE.ONE QUALITY AUDIT WAS CONDUCTED IN 2018 THAT FOCUSED ON THE KNOWLEDGE OF CLINICAL CARE PROVIDERS. THE OVERALL RESULT WAS ""COMPETENT."" RESULTS WERE CONVEYED AND CORRECTIVE ACTION PLANS COMPLETED AT TWO SITES. LANGUAGE SERVICES CONTINUES TO PARTICIPATE IN PATIENT SAFETY HUDDLES AND REPORTS THE NUMBER OF INDIVIDUALS NEEDING INTERPRETING SERVICES AS WELL AS LANGUAGE SERVICES EVENTS. PATIENT SAFETY EVENTS ARE ALSO REPORTED AT THE SYSTEM SAFETY HUDDLE. THIS ASSISTS WITH IDENTIFYING LANGUAGE SERVICE ISSUES THAT MAY BE OCCURRING ACROSS THE SYSTEM.PARISH NURSE MINISTRY. ADVOCATE FULLY FUNDS THREE FAITH COMMUNITY NURSE POSITIONS SERVING THREE CONGREGATIONS IN LOW-INCOME, HIGH NEED COMMUNITIES. THESE FAITH COMMUNITY NURSES PROVIDE HEALTH EDUCATION, WELLNESS PROMOTION, NAVIGATION AND CARE MANAGEMENT, HEALTH SCREENINGS, ADVOCACY AND SPIRITUAL SUPPORT TO THE MEMBERS OF THEIR CONGREGATIONS AND TO THE WIDER COMMUNITIES THAT THEY SERVE. MANY OF THE PEOPLE SERVED ARE HOMELESS, MARGINALIZED OR CHRONICALLY ILL INDIVIDUALS. IN ADDITION, ADVOCATE SUPPORTS A FAITH COMMUNITY NURSE SUPPORT NETWORK OF 37 NURSES THAT SERVE CONGREGATIONS ACROSS THE CHICAGOLAND REGION. ADVOCATE ALSO FUNDS SYSTEM LEVEL PROGRAMS AND ACTIVITIES FOCUSED ON POSITIVELY AFFECTING THE HEALTH STATUS AND QUALITY OF LIFE OF INDIVIDUALS AND POPULATIONS IN COMMUNITIES SERVED BY ADVOCATE. TWO EXAMPLES OF SUCH PROGRAMS FOLLOW.ADVOCATE BETHANY COMMUNITY HEALTH FUND (BETHANY FUND). ESTABLISHED IN 2006 BY ADVOCATE HEALTH CARE AS PART OF AN ONGOING COMMITMENT TO HELP BUILD, PROMOTE AND SUSTAIN HEALTHY COMMUNITIES ON CHICAGO'S WEST SIDE, THE BETHANY FUND SUPPORTS NONPROFIT ORGANIZATIONS THAT ARE IN THE COMMUNITIES HISTORICALLY SERVED BY ADVOCATE BETHANY HOSPITAL (NOW RML CHICAGO)-AUSTIN, GARFIELD PARK, HUMBOLDT PARK AND NORTH LAWNDALE. THE FUND DOES THIS THROUGH PROGRAM GRANTS, ORGANIZATIONAL CAPACITY BUILDING EVENTS AND PARTNERSHIPS TO BUILD ON THE ASSETS OF THESE VULNERABLE COMMUNITIES. IN 2018, THE BETHANY FUND AWARDED $815,000 IN PROGRAM GRANTS ADDRESSING ITS PRIORITY AREAS OF DIABETES, SCHOOL DROPOUT PREVENTION, VIOLENCE PREVENTION AND WORKFORCE DEVELOPMENT.CENTER FOR FAITH AND COMMUNITY HEALTH TRANSFORMATION. THE CENTER FOR FAITH AND COMMUNITY HEALTH TRANSFORMATION WORKS TO ADVANCE HEALTH EQUITY BY PARTNERING WITH FAITH-BASED AND COMMUNITY ORGANIZATIONS TO BUILD COMMUNITY, NURTURE LEADERS AND CONNECT THE UNIQUE SPIRIT POWER OF FAITH COMMUNITIES TO PROMOTE SOCIAL JUSTICE AND ABUNDANT LIFE FOR INDIVIDUALS, FAMILIES AND COMMUNITIES.

AFFILIATED HEALTH CARE SYSTEM- CONTINUEDPREVENT TRAUMA AND TO BE PLACES OF HEALING FOR THOSE WHO HAVE EXPERIENCED ADVERSITY IN CHILDHOOD OR THROUGHOUT THEIR LIVES.THE CENTER ALSO CONVENES THE COURAGE TO LOVE COLLABORATIVE (CTLC), A PARTNERSHIP COMMITTED TO REDUCING PRE-TERM BIRTH AND INFANT MORTALITY IN THE VULNERABLE AUBURN GRESHAM NEIGHBORHOOD OF CHICAGO. THE COURAGE TO LOVE APPROACH IS ROOTED IN A REPORT BY THE COMMISSION ON INFANT MORTALITY OF THE HEALTH POLICY INSTITUTE OF THE JOINT CENTER FOR POLITICAL AND ECONOMIC STUDIES THAT MAINTAINS THAT SOCIAL COHESION IS THE NECESSARY STRATEGY FOR IMPROVING BIRTH OUTCOMES. THE CTLC HAS INTERVIEWED OR GATHERED INPUT FROM ALMOST 150 COMMUNITY RESIDENTS DOCUMENTING THEIR EXPERIENCES OF STRESS, AND OF LOVE AND CARE IN THEIR COMMUNITIES. ECONOMIC PRESSURES AND COMMUNITY VIOLENCE WERE IDENTIFIED AS MOST STRESSFUL, AND FAMILY, CHURCH AND NEIGHBORS EMERGED AS THE CORE DRIVERS OF SOCIAL CONNECTION. THE COLLABORATIVE CONTINUES TO WORK WITH TEAMS OF COMMUNITY MEMBERS TO DESIGN AN APPROACH TO EXPAND EXISTING NETWORKS OF SOCIAL CONNECTION TO PROVIDE INTENTIONAL SUPPORT FOR PARENTS AND FAMILIES.GOAL C. **NOT USED** GOAL D. EXAMINE AND ADDRESS IN PARTNERSHIP WITH OTHERS THE ROOT CAUSES OF HEALTH INEQUITIES IN ADVOCATE COMMUNITIES INCLUDING, BUT NOT LIMITED TO, UNEMPLOYMENT, LACK OF EDUCATION, POVERTY, ENVIRONMENTAL INJUSTICE AND RACISM.SOCIONEEDS INDEX. IN PREPARATION FOR THE 2014-2016 CHNA, ADVOCATE PURCHASED ACCESS TO A TOOL THAT COULD BE USED BY ALL OF ITS HOSPITALS TO IDENTIFY PRIORITY OPPORTUNITIES TO IMPACT THE SOCIAL DETERMINANTS OF HEALTH IN THE COMMUNITIES SERVED BY ADVOCATE. INCLUDED IN THIS TOOL, DEVELOPED BY THE HEALTHY COMMUNITIES INSTITUTE, IS THE SOCIONEEDS INDEX. THE SOCIONEEDS INDEX IS A MEASURE OF SOCIOECONOMIC NEED THAT IS CORRELATED WITH POOR HEALTH OUTCOMES. INDICATORS FOR THE INDEX ARE WEIGHTED TO MAXIMIZE THE CORRELATION OF THE INDEX WITH PREMATURE DEATH RATES AND PREVENTABLE HOSPITALIZATION RATES. THIS INDEX COMBINES MULTIPLE SOCIOECONOMIC INDICATORS INTO A SINGLE COMPOSITE VALUE. AS A SINGLE INDICATOR, THE INDEX CAN SERVE AS A CONCISE WAY TO EXPLAIN WHICH AREAS ARE OF HIGHEST NEED. A MAP WAS THEN PREPARED FOR EACH HOSPITAL SERVICE AREA ENABLING THE COMMUNITY HEALTH COUNCILS TO FOCUS PRIORITY SETTING AND PROGRAM PLANNING ON COMMUNITIES AT HIGHER LEVELS OF SOCIOECONOMIC NEED. THE INDEX IS ALSO BEING USED FOR THE 2017-2019 CHNA PROCESS.ALLIANCE FOR HEALTH EQUITY (FORMERLY KNOWN AS THE HEALTH IMPACT COLLABORATIVE OF COOK COUNTY). IN 2015, COMMUNITY HEALTH LEADERS FROM ADVOCATE, PRESENCE HEALTH, THE ILLINOIS PUBLIC HEALTH INSTITUTE (IPHA), THE CHICAGO DEPARTMENT OF HEALTH (CDPH) AND THE COOK COUNTY DEPARTMENT OF PUBLIC HEALTH (CCDPH) CAME TOGETHER TO FORM THE HEALTH IMPACT COLLABORATIVE OF COOK COUNTY (HICCC). EVENTUALLY THIS COLLABORATIVE INCLUDED 26 HOSPITALS, INCLUDING FIVE FROM ADVOCATE, SEVEN HEALTH DEPARTMENTS AND NEARLY 100 COMMUNITY ORGANIZATIONS FROM ACROSS CHICAGO AND COOK COUNTY. THE PURPOSE OF HICCC WAS TO CREATE A MORE EFFECTIVE WAY TO ASSESS HEALTH NEEDS ACROSS CHICAGO AND COOK COUNTY AND THEN IMPLEMENT A SHARED ACTION PLAN TO MAXIMIZE HEALTH EQUITY AND WELLNESS. DURING 2016, THE COLLABORATIVE COMPLETED THREE COMPREHENSIVE ASSESSMENTS - ONE EACH FOR THE NORTH, CENTRAL AND SOUTH REGIONS OF COOK COUNTY, INCLUDING CHICAGO. SEE: HTTP://HEALTHIMPACTCC.ORG/REPORTS2016/ THROUGH COLLABORATIVE PRIORITIZATION PROCESSES INVOLVING ALL HOSPITAL AND HEALTH DEPARTMENT MEMBERS OF THE COLLABORATIVE, AS WELL AS STAKEHOLDER ADVISORY GROUPS COMPRISED OF COMMUNITY REPRESENTATIVES, HICCC IDENTIFIED FOUR OVERARCHING FOCUS AREAS INCLUDING:"" IMPROVING SOCIAL, ECONOMIC, AND STRUCTURAL DETERMINANTS OF HEALTH WHILE REDUCING SOCIAL AND ECONOMIC INEQUALITIES;"" IMPROVING MENTAL HEALTH AND DECREASING SUBSTANCE ABUSE;"" PREVENTING AND REDUCING CHRONIC DISEASE, WITH A FOCUS ON RISK FACTORS-NUTRITION, PHYSICAL ACTIVITY AND TOBACCO; AND"" INCREASING ACCESS TO CARE AND COMMUNITY RESOURCES.ALL OF THE HOSPITALS IN THE COLLABORATIVE AGREED TO INCLUDE THE FIRST FOCUS AREA-IMPROVING SOCIAL, ECONOMIC, AND STRUCTURAL DETERMINANTS OF HEALTH-AS A PRIORITY AREA FOR THEIR CHNA AND IMPLEMENTATION PLAN. OF THE FIVE ADVOCATE HOSPITALS IN COOK COUNTY, ADVOCATE ILLINOIS MASONIC AND ADVOCATE TRINITY CHOSE WORKFORCE DEVELOPMENT, ADVOCATE CHRIST SELECTED VIOLENCE PREVENTION, ADVOCATE SOUTH SUBURBAN CHOSE HOUSING AND ADVOCATE LUTHERAN GENERAL SELECTED YOUTH EMPLOYMENT.

AFFILIATED HEALTH CARE SYSTEM- CONTINUEDNONPROFIT AND PUBLIC HOSPITALS, SEVEN LOCAL HEALTH DEPARTMENTS AND MORE THAN 100 COMMUNITY ORGANIZATIONS PARTICIPATED IN THE ASSESSMENT AND ACTION TEAMS.DURING 2015 AND 2016, IPHI, THE PARTICIPATING HOSPITALS AND HEALTH DEPARTMENTS WORKED TOGETHER TO DESIGN A SHARED LEADERSHIP MODEL AND COLLABORATIVE INFRASTRUCTURE TO SUPPORT COMMUNITY-ENGAGED PLANNING PARTNERSHIPS AND STRATEGIC ALIGNMENT OF IMPLEMENTATION PLANS, WHICH WILL FACILITATE MORE EFFECTIVE AND SUSTAINABLE COMMUNITY HEALTH IMPROVEMENT IN THE FUTURE. SURVEYS WERE DISTRIBUTED THROUGHOUT COOK COUNTY WITH A FOCUS ON UNDERSERVED COMMUNITIES. OVER 5,000 SURVEYS WERE COMPLETED PROVIDING A GOOD PICTURE OF THE HEALTH NEEDS OF THE COUNTY. PRIMARY DATA ALSO INCLUDED MULTIPLE FOCUS GROUPS AND HOSPITAL UTILIZATION DATA. A DATA TEAM ANALYZED MULTIPLE SECONDARY DATA SOURCES AS WELL. THIS COLLABORATIVE WORK RESULTED IN THREE REGIONAL CHNA REPORTS.AS A RESULT OF THE ASSESSMENT WORK, ALL PARTNERS DETERMINED FOUR FOCUS AREAS FOR IMPLEMENTATION. ACTION TEAMS HAVE BEEN FORMED AND COMMUNITY HEALTH IMPROVEMENT PLANS ARE BEING DEVELOPED WITH A FOCUS ON ALIGNED ACTIONS AND DATA COLLECTION. IN LATE 2017 AND FOLLOWING HICCC'S MERGER WITH THE HEALTH CHICAGO HOSPITALS COLLABORATE TO CREATE THE ALLIANCE FOR HEALTH EQUITY (AFHE), ADVOCATE HAS CONTINUED TO BE AN ACTIVE MEMBER INVOLVED IN LEADERSHIP AND SERVING ON THE AFHE STEERING COMMITTEE. ANOTHER OBJECTIVE TO STRENGTHEN COMMUNITY PARTNERSHIPS IS FOR ADVOCATE TO EXPLORE NON-TRADITIONAL RELATIONSHIPS, SUCH AS WITH SCHOOL DISTRICTS, EMPLOYMENT AGENCIES, HOUSING GROUPS, FOOD PANTRIES, SHELTERS, ETC. WHILE THERE ARE MANY EXISTING ADVOCATE COMMUNITY PARTNERSHIPS MENTIONED THROUGHOUT THIS DOCUMENT AND EVEN SOME THAT RESULTED FROM OR BEGAN PRIOR TO ADVOCATE'S 2011-2013 CHNA PROCESS, THIS OBJECTIVE IS FOCUSED PRIMARILY ON THE INNOVATIVE NON-TRADITIONAL PARTNERSHIPS THAT HAVE BEGUN AS A RESULT OF THE 2014-2016 CHNA.ADDRESSING FOOD INSECURITY. ONE SUCH EXAMPLE OF A NON-TRADITIONAL COMMUNITY PARTNERSHIP IS ADVOCATE GOOD SAMARITAN'S PARTNERSHIP WITH LOCAL FOOD PANTRIES AND THE UNIVERSITY OF ILLINOIS EXTENSION TO DEVELOP A PROGRAM THAT OFFERS HEALTHY FRESH FOOD, NUTRITION AND COOKING CLASSES TO CLIENTS OF THE FOOD PANTRIES. ANOTHER EXAMPLE IS ADVOCATE GOOD SHEPHERD'S WORK WITH VARIOUS COMMUNITY-BASED ORGANIZATIONS AND LOCAL MUNICIPAL ENTITIES THAT SERVE SENIORS TO IMPLEMENT FOOD SECURITY SCREENING FOR SENIORS. A SCREENING TOOL AND COMPREHENSIVE RESOURCE GUIDE HAVE BEEN DEVELOPED FOR SENIORS THAT SCREEN AS FOOD INSECURE. ADVOCATE GOOD SHEPHERD AND SEVERAL OTHER ADVOCATE HOSPITALS ARE GROWING VEGETABLES ON THEIR CAMPUSES OR IN THE COMMUNITY. ADVOCATE GOOD SHEPHERD HAS PARTNERED WITH A LOCAL NON-PROFIT ORGANIZATION, SMARTFARM, WHOSE MISSION IS TO BE AN EDUCATIONAL RESOURCE ON SUSTAINABLE GARDENING AND HEALTHY EATING. SMART FARM MANAGES THE ON-SITE GARDEN ON OVER 10 ACRES OF LAND OWNED BY ADVOCATE AND THE HARVESTED FRESH VEGETABLES ARE DONATED TO LOCAL FOOD PANTRIES. SIMILAR PARTNERSHIPS EXIST AT ADVOCATE SHERMAN AND ADVOCATE BROMENN. IN 2018, ADVOCATE ILLINOIS MASONIC ESTABLISHED A HOSPITAL-BASED FOOD PANTRY TO ADDRESS THE NEEDS OF FOOD INSECURE ONCOLOGY PATIENTS. IN PARTNERSHIP WITH THE LAKEVIEW FOOD PANTRY, THE MEDICAL CENTER PROVIDES DRY GOOD FOOD BAGS, RE-USABLE WHEELIE GROCERY BAGS AND GIFT CARDS TO LOW-INCOME AND FOOD INSECURE PATIENTS. TWO HOSPITALS, ADVOCATE SOUTH SUBURBAN AND ADVOCATE TRINITY HAVE PARTNERED WITH ADVOCATE'S PRODUCE VENDOR, CRISTINA FOODS, TO HOST THREE PUBLIC FARMERS MARKETS WHERE FRESH PRODUCE WAS PROVIDED TO PATIENTS, SURROUNDING COMMUNITIES AND ADVOCATE TEAM MEMBERS, WITH LEFTOVER FOOD DONATED TO LOCAL FOOD PANTRIES IN 2018.ADVOCATE WORKFORCE INITIATIVE (AWI). IN 2015, JPMORGAN CHASE MADE A GENEROUS DONATION TO THE ADVOCATE CHARITABLE FOUNDATION, THE CHARITABLE ARM OF ADVOCATE, TO DEVELOP THE HEALTHCARE WORKFORCE COLLABORATIVE, A CREATIVE AND MODERN SOLUTION TO THE CITY'S TALENT SHORTAGE AND ECONOMIC DISPARITIES. LED BY ADVOCATE, THIS HEALTH CARE SECTOR SKILLS-BASED TRAINING INITIATIVE CONNECTS CHICAGOLAND'S UNDEREMPLOYED AND UNEMPLOYED RESIDENTS WITH HIGH-QUALITY, IN-DEMAND JOBS IN THE RAPIDLY GROWING HEALTH CARE INDUSTRY. UNEMPLOYMENT RATES ARE AS HIGH AS 31.9% IN SOME NEIGHBORHOODS IN THE METROPOLITAN AREA AS COMPARED TO CHICAGO'S OVERALL UNEMPLOYMENT RATE OF 8.2%. ILLINOIS HAS THE NATION'S HIGHEST UNEMPLOYMENT RATE AMONG AFRICAN-AMERICANS. THE UNEMPLOYMENT RATE OF AFRICAN-AMERICANS AND HISPANICS IN CHICAGO IS THREE TIMES THAT OF THEIR WHITE COUNTERPARTS. THE HEALTH CARE SECTOR IS EXPECTED TO GENERATE 14,000 NEW WELL-PAYING MIDDLE-SKILL JOBS ANNUALLY IN THE CHICAGO REGION THROUGH 2019, BUT LACKS THE SKILLED TALENT NEEDED TO FILL THESE ROLES. ADVOCATE ALSO HELPED LAUNCH THE CHICAGOLAND HEALTHCARE WORKFORCE COLLABORATIVE (CHWC). THE CHWC IS A CONSORTIUM OF LEADING HEALTHCARE EMPLOYERS AND INDUSTRY PARTNERS THAT BELIEVE IN THE NECESSITY OF A STRONG AND DIVERSE LOCAL HEALTHCARE WORKFORCE. BY LEVERAGING RESOURCES AND BEST PRACTICES, THE COLLABORATIVE AIMS TO SUPPORT AN INCLUSIVE HEALTHCARE WORKFORCE, PROVIDE ACCESSIBILITY FOR THE UNEMPLOYED AND UNDEREMPLOYED POPULATIONS, AND DEVELOP INNOVATIVE RESPONSES TO THE EVOLVING NEEDS OF THE HEALTHCARE INDUSTRY. THIS IS ACHIEVED BY IDENTIFYING AND IMPLEMENTING IMPACTFUL, DATA-DRIVEN AND ACTION-ORIENTED SOLUTIONS, WITH A SPECIFIC FOCUS ON POPULATIONS THAT ARE UNDERREPRESENTED IN THE HEALTH CARE WORKFORCE.THIS WORKFORCE DEVELOPMENT PROGRAM:"" ALIGNS TRAINING CURRICULUM TO CURRENT AND EMERGING JOB NEEDS;"" CONNECTS JOB SEEKERS TO EMPLOYMENT OPPORTUNITIES WITHIN ADVOCATE;"" INCREASES DIVERSITY WITHIN THE HEALTHCARE SECTOR;"" PROVIDES CAREER PATHWAYS TO ADVANCED TRAINING OR CAREER OPPORTUNITIES IN HEALTHCARE;"" SUPPORTS ECONOMIC DEVELOPMENT IN VULNERABLE COMMUNITIES;"" ESTABLISHES BEST PRACTICES, CREATING A REGIONAL/NATIONAL MODEL; AND"" PROVIDES SUPPORTIVE SERVICES TO REMOVE BARRIERS TO EMPLOYMENT.TO ENSURE THE INITIATIVE IS BROAD-REACHING AND COMPREHENSIVE, ADVOCATE HAS ESTABLISHED STRATEGIC ALLIANCES WITH THE CITY COLLEGES OF CHICAGO, PRAIRIE STATE COLLEGE, CHICAGO STATE UNIVERSITY, UNIVERSITY OF CHICAGO (URBAN LABS) AND OTHER COMMUNITY-BASED ORGANIZATIONS, SUCH AS PHALANX FAMILY SERVICES, JEWISH VOCATION SERVICES, INSTITUTO DEL PROGRESO LATINO, POLISH AMERICAN ASSOCIATION, NATIONAL LATINO EDUCATION INSTITUTE, KINZIE INDUSTRIAL DEVELOPMENT CORPORATION AND CHICAGO CENTER FOR ARTS AND TECHNOLOGY, TO RECRUIT, TRAIN AND SUPPORT POTENTIAL CANDIDATES. AFTER SUCCESSFUL COMPLETION OF THE TRAINING AND LICENSING EXAM, ALL PARTICIPANTS ARE GUARANTEED AN INTERVIEW WITH ADVOCATE AND RECEIVE JOB PLACEMENT ASSISTANCE. SINCE INCEPTION, THE INITIATIVE HAS TRAINED MORE THAN 800 PARTICIPANTS AND HAS OVER AN 80% GRADUATION RATE. NEARLY 300 GRADUATES FROM THE INITIATIVE ARE NOW EMPLOYED IN THE HEALTH CARE INDUSTRY WITH ABOUT 162 STILL ENROLLED PENDING NEW EMPLOYMENT OPPORTUNITIES. OF THOSE EMPLOYED, 98% HAVE MAINTAINED EMPLOYMENT FOR AT LEAST 90 DAYS. ADVOCATE HAS ALSO LAUNCHED AN INCUMBENT WORKER STRATEGY FOR FRONTLINE TEAM MEMBERS, THE NAVIGATE PROGRAM. NAVIGATE AIMS TO CREATE A MORE INCLUSIVE WORKFORCE, ONE THAT PROVIDES TEAM MEMBERS WITH OPPORTUNITIES TO DEVELOP NEW SKILLS, DETERMINE A CAREER PATHWAY AND CONNECT WITH TOOLS AND RESOURCES. ADVOCATE IS INVESTED IN TEAM MEMBERS' SUCCESS THROUGH LEVERAGING THESE TYPES OF PROGRAMS TO ENSURE ADVOCATE IS A GREAT PLACE FOR TEAM MEMBERS WORK, PATIENTS TO HEAL AND PHYSICIANS TO PRACTICE. THE PROGRAM WAS INITIATED AT ADVOCATE TRINITY IN 2016 AND AS OF YEAR-END 2018, HAS EXPANDED TO ADVOCATE ILLINOIS MASONIC, ADVOCATE CHRIST AND ADVOCATE MEDICAL GROUP, WITH PLANS TO ACTIVATE AT ADVOCATE SOUTH SUBURBAN IN 2019. THE PROGRAM HAS ENROLLED AND SUPPORTED 182 INCUMBENT WORKERS, GUIDED MORE THAN 100 TO IDENTIFY A CAREER PATHWAY AND HAS NEARLY AN 80% GRADUATION RATE. OF THOSE THAT HAVE MOVED INTO AN ADVANCED CAREER PATHWAY, THE AVERAGE WAGE INCREASE IS 24%. VOLUNTEERS FROM THE COMMUNITY. ANOTHER ASPECT OF COMMUNITY ENGAGEMENT IS PROVIDING COMMUNITY MEMBERS WITH AN OPPORTUNITY TO DONATE THEIR TIME SERVING THROUGH A MYRIAD OF VOLUNTEER SERVICE OPPORTUNITIES. EACH YEAR, VOLUNTEERS FROM THE COMMUNITY SHARE THEIR TIME AND TALENTS THROUGH SERVICE AT ADVOCATE'S HOSPITALS, ADVOCATE MEDICAL GROUP AND ADVOCATE AT HOME, AND IN THEIR OWN WAY, FURTHER ADVOCATE'S COMMITMENT TO PROVIDING EXCELLENT HEALTH CARE. IN 2018, ADVOCATE STAFF MANAGED 5,018 ACTIVE COMMUNITY VOLUNTEERS THAT ENGAGED PATIENTS, FAMILIES AND STAFF IN A VARIETY OF ACTIVITIES, SOME OF WHICH WERE: PROVIDING INFORMATION DESK SERVICES TO VISITORS; CLERICAL SUPPORT TO STAFF; SERVING CUSTOMERS IN HOSPITAL GIFT AND RESALE SHOPS; OFFERING COMPASSIONATE CONCERN TO PATIENTS AND THEIR LOVED ONES IN MULTIPLE HOSPITAL AREAS SUCH AS THE EMERGENCY DEPARTMENT, INTENSIVE CARE UNIT,"

ADVOCATE TEAM MEMBERS VOLUNTEERING IN THE COMMUNITY. ADVOCATE'S SYSTEM LEADERSHIP ALSO ENCOURAGES AND PROVIDES OPPORTUNITIES FOR TEAM MEMBERS AND PHYSICIANS TO DONATE TO, VOLUNTEER AT AND HELP RAISE FUNDS FOR COMMUNITY INITIATIVES. IN 2018, ADVOCATE PROMOTED AND SUPPORTED ASSOCIATE, PHYSICIAN AND HOSPITAL PARTICIPATION IN WALKS, RUNS AND RACES, INCLUDING DEVELOPING OFFICIAL ADVOCATE TEAMS FOR THE AMERICAN HEART ASSOCIATION (HEAR WALK), AMERICAN CANCER SOCIETY (MAKING STRIDES AGAINST BREAST CANCER EVENTS AND HEAD FOR THE CURE 5K), ALZHEIMER'S ASSOCIATION (WALK TO END ALZHEIMER'S) AND MARCH OF DIMES (MARCH FOR BABIES). IN 2018, 5,583 ADVOCATE TEAM MEMBERS WALKED IN THESE FUNDRAISERS AND $633,792 IN CHARITABLE CONTRIBUTIONS WAS RAISED TO SUPPORT THESE NONPROFIT PARTNER ORGANIZATIONS THROUGH SUCH EFFORTS. ADVOCATE ALSO HAD THE HONOR OF BEING DESIGNATED THE #1 HEART WALK FUNDRAISING HEALTH CARE COMPANY IN THE NATION BY THE AMERICAN HEART ASSOCIATION IN 2018. IN ADDITION, ADVOCATE'S TEAM MEMBERS AND PHYSICIANS GENEROUSLY SUPPORT MULTIPLE LOCAL COMMUNITY ORGANIZATIONS, PROGRAMS AND INITIATIVES, INCLUDING SOME OF ADVOCATE'S OWN SYSTEM-WIDE AND HOSPITAL-BASED COMMUNITY HEALTH PROGRAMS. IN 2018, ADVOCATE TEAM MEMBERS CONTRIBUTED MORE THAN $2.1 MILLION THROUGH THE ADVOCATE AURORA GIVING CAMPAIGN. IN ADDITION, SYSTEM LEVEL LEADERS ARE SUPPORTIVE OF TEAM MEMBERS VOLUNTEERING DURING WORKTIME ON NONPROFIT COMMUNITY BOARDS, COMMITTEES, COUNCILS, TASK FORCES AND COALITIONS, USING THEIR TALENTS TO SUPPORT A VARIETY OF COMMUNITY-BASED ORGANIZATIONS. GOAL F: PROMOTE ACCOUNTABILITY FOR SYSTEM AND SITE ALIGNMENT BY INCREASING PROGRAM COORDINATION AND DEVELOPING STRONG GOVERNANCE RELATIONSHIPS.KEY TO DEVELOPING STRONG GOVERNANCE RELATIONSHIPS WAS ESTABLISHING SYSTEM BOARD ENGAGEMENT IN SUPPORT OF ADVOCATE'S COMMUNITY HEALTH VISION. AS THE FUNCTION ACCOUNTABLE FOR ADVOCATE'S SYSTEM-WIDE CHNA PROCESS AND BOTH CHNA AND STATE COMMUNITY BENEFITS REGULATORY REPORTING IN ILLINOIS, THE COMMUNITY HEALTH DEPARTMENT PROVIDES PROGRESS UPDATES AT LEAST ANNUALLY TO HOSPITAL AND SYSTEM LEADERSHIP. WHEREAS PRIOR TO THE APRIL 2018MERGER, THE MISSION AND SPIRITUAL CARE COMMITTEE OF THE BOARD OF DIRECTORS WAS RESPONSIBLE FOR THE ADOPTION OF COMMUNITY HEALTH STRATEGY, POST-MERGER THE ADVOCATE HEALTH CARE NETWORK BOARD IS NOW CHARGED WITH THIS RESPONSIBILITY. AS INDICATED EARLIER, ADVOCATE HEALTH CARE ESTABLISHED A COMMUNITY HEALTH DEPARTMENT IN LATE 2015 AND THE DEPARTMENT WAS FULLY STAFFED AND OPERATING BY JANUARY 2016. THE DEPARTMENT'S FIRST ORDER OF BUSINESS WAS TO DEVELOP A MISSION, VALUES AND VISION (MVV) TO GUIDE ITS ACTIONS. THE DEPARTMENT'S MISSION IS ""TO TRANSFORM THE HEALTH AND WELL-BEING OF THE COMMUNITIES WE SERVE BY PROMOTING PREVENTION AND ENSURING HEALTH EQUITY, THROUGH COLLABORATIVE PARTNERSHIPS AND EVIDENCE-BASED PRACTICES."" THE DEPARTMENT'S VALUES ENCOMPASS BEING ""ACCOUNTABLE, COLLABORATIVE, EQUITABLE, INCLUSIVE, RESILIENT, SUSTAINABLE, TRANSFORMATIVE AND TRANSPARENT."" THROUGH THESE ATTRIBUTES, THE VISION - ""TO WORK COLLABORATIVELY TO TRANSFORM OUR ENVIRONMENT INTO COMMUNITIES WHERE HEALTH SERVICES ARE ACCESSIBLE AND INTEGRATED; PEOPLE ARE SUPPORTED; HEALTH EQUITY IS ACHIEVED AND RESULTS ARE MEASURABLE"" - WILL BE ACHIEVED. DURING 2016 AND TO SUPPORT ADVOCATE HOSPITALS' PLANS TO IMPLEMENT PROGRAM STRATEGIES AS OUTLINED IN THEIR CHNA REPORTS DURING 2017, SITE-SPECIFIC COMMUNITY HEALTH DEPARTMENT BUDGETS WERE PUT IN PLACE AT ALL ADVOCATE HOSPITALS BY THE SYSTEM VICE PRESIDENT OF COMMUNITY HEALTH AND FAITH OUTREACH. HOSPITAL COMMUNITY HEALTH BUDGETS, INCLUDING ONGOING PROGRAM IMPLEMENTATION COSTS, STAFF SALARIES, ANNUAL CONTRACTED DATA ACCESS COSTS TO THE CONDUENT-HEALTHY COMMUNITIES INSTITUTE'S CHNA TOOL, FEE TO PARTICIPATE IN THE ALLIANCE FOR HEALTH EQUITY (AHFE) AND FOR ANNUAL SUPPORT FOR AND USE OF THE LYON SOFTWARE CBISA (COMMUNITY BENEFITS INVENTORY OF SOCIAL RESPONSIBILITY) REPORTING TOOL WERE INCLUDED IN THE 2017 AND 2018 BUDGET CYCLE IN PREPARATION FOR YEAR 2019. SYSTEM LEVEL MONITORING OF BUDGETS SUPPORTS APPROPRIATE FUNDING TO SUSTAIN EXISTING AND IMPLEMENT NEW PROGRAMS THAT TARGET SELECTED COMMUNITY HEALTH PRIORITIES. HOSPITAL GOVERNING COUNCILS.

TO THAT END, THE SYSTEM EXPANDED THE ROLE OF THE HOSPITAL GOVERNING COUNCILS TO INCLUDE OVERSIGHT OF THE CHNA PROCESS AND APPROVAL OF THE HOSPITAL CHNA REPORTS AND IMPLEMENTATION STRATEGIES. THIS HAS RESULTED IN COMMUNITY HEALTH BEING STRONGLY INTEGRATED INTO ADVOCATE GOVERNANCE STRUCTURES. COMMUNITY HEALTH COUNCILS COMPRISED OF COMMUNITY EXPERTS AND HOSPITAL LEADERS HAVE BEEN DEVELOPED AT EACH HOSPITAL. THESE COUNCILS ARE CO-LED BY THE HOSPITAL COMMUNITY HEALTH LEADER AND A HOSPITAL GOVERNING COUNCIL MEMBER. A MINIMUM OF 50% OF THE COUNCIL MEMBERS FOR THE 2016 CHNA REPORT CYCLE WERE COMMUNITY REPRESENTATIVES WITH A FOCUS ON PEOPLE WHO REPRESENTED UNDERSERVED AND VULNERABLE POPULATIONS. THE COUNCILS MET AT LEAST FOUR TIMES DURING THE YEAR. HOSPITAL COMMUNITY HEALTH STAFF ANALYZED AND PRESENTED PRIMARY AND SECONDARY COMMUNITY HEALTH DATA TO THE HOSPITALS' COMMUNITY HEALTH COUNCILS. THE COUNCIL MEMBERS IDENTIFIED THE HOSPITAL SERVICE AREAS' SIGNIFICANT HEALTH NEEDS, SUBSEQUENTLY EMPLOYING A CONSENSUS BASED PRIORITY-SETTING PROCESS TO DETERMINE THE NEEDS UPON WHICH TO FOCUS. AS PART OF THE PRIORITIZATION PROCESS, THE COUNCILS SCANNED HOSPITAL AND COMMUNITY CHALLENGES AND ASSETS, AS WELL AS POTENTIAL PARTNERSHIPS WITH OTHER ORGANIZATIONS THAT MIGHT RESULT IN A LARGER HEALTH IMPROVEMENT IMPACT.CHNA DATA ASSESSMENT RESULTS AND RECOMMENDATIONS FOR HEALTH IMPROVEMENT PRIORITIES WERE PRESENTED TO THE FULL HOSPITAL GOVERNING COUNCILS FOR ENDORSEMENT. ONCE THE HEALTH IMPROVEMENT PRIORITIES AND STRATEGIES WERE APPROVED BY THE HOSPITAL GOVERNING COUNCILS, THE RESULTS WERE PRESENTED TO THE MISSION AND SPIRITUAL CARE COMMITTEE OF THE ADVOCATE HEALTH CARE BOARD OF DIRECTORS, CHARGED WITH SYSTEM OVERSIGHT OF COMMUNITY HEALTH PLANNING AT THAT TIME, FOR FINAL APPROVAL. AS INDICATED EARLIER, AS A RESULT OF THE MERGER, THIS RESPONSIBILITY MOVED TO THE ADVOCATE HEALTH CARE NETWORK BOARD IN 2018. SERVICE LINE AND POPULATION HEALTH ENGAGEMENT. TO SUPPORT FURTHER ALIGNMENT WITHIN ADVOCATE, THE SYSTEM COMMUNITY HEALTH DEPARTMENT HAS ALSO WORKED TO ENGAGE SYSTEM DEFINED CLINICAL SERVICE LINES IN EXPANDING THEIR FOCUS ON COMMUNITY HEALTH.

THE SOCIAL VULNERABILITY INDEX RANKS EACH CENSUS TRACT ON 14 SOCIAL FACTORS INCLUDING POVERTY, LACK OF VEHICLE ACCESS AND CROWDED HOUSING. COMMUNITIES WITH HIGH SOCIAL VULNERABILITY INDEX SCORES HAVE LESS CAPACITY TO DEAL WITH OR PREPARE FOR EXTERNAL STRESSORS AND, AS A RESULT, ARE MORE VULNERABLE TO THREATS ON HUMAN HEALTH. MANY COMMUNITIES IN ADVOCATE CHILDREN'S TSA RANK HIGH IN SOCIAL VULNERABILITY WHICH CAN HAVE A NEGATIVE IMPACT ON CHILDREN'S HEALTH.

CHILDREN WHO LIVE IN AREAS OF LOW OPPORTUNITY HAVE AN INCREASED RISK FOR A VARIETY OF NEGATIVE HEALTH INDICATORS, SUCH AS PREMATURE MORTALITY, ARE MORE LIKELY TO BE EXPOSED TO SERIOUS PSYCHOLOGICAL DISTRESS AND ARE MORE LIKELY TO HAVE POOR SCHOOL PERFORMANCE. COMMUNITIES IN THE ADVOCATE CHILDREN'S TSA WHICH ARE LOW ON THE CHILDHOOD OPPORTUNITY INDEX INCLUDE WHEELING IN THE NORTH SUBURBS, AS WELL AS ALBANY PARK, DUNNING, PORTAGE PARK, ROGERS PARK AND IRVING PARK NEIGHBORHOODS IN CHICAGO.RACE, ETHNICITY AND LANGUAGEADVOCATE LUTHERAN GENERAL ADVOCATE LUTHERAN GENERAL SERVES A PREDOMINANTLY WHITE, NON-HISPANIC POPULATION (74.6 PERCENT).

HICCC IS A PARTNERSHIP OF HOSPITALS, HEALTH DEPARTMENTS AND COMMUNITY ORGANIZATIONS WORKING TO ASSESS COMMUNITY HEALTH NEEDS AND ASSETS, AND TO IMPLEMENT A SHARED PLAN TO MAXIMIZE HEALTH EQUITY AND WELLNESS IN CHICAGO AND COOK COUNTY. THIS COLLABORATIVE WAS DEVELOPED SO THAT PARTICIPATING ORGANIZATIONS COULD EFFICIENTLY SHARE RESOURCES AND WORK TOGETHER ON DATA COLLECTION, PRIORITY SETTING AND IMPLEMENTATION PLANNING. COOK COUNTY WAS DIVIDED INTO NORTH, CENTRAL AND SOUTH REGIONS TO ENABLE THE INVOLVEMENT OF OTHER LOCAL STAKEHOLDERS AND IDENTIFY THE LOCAL NEEDS OF THIS DIVERSE COUNTY. ADVOCATE SOUTH SUBURBAN PARTICIPATED IN THE HICCC SOUTH REGION ASSESSMENT. THE METHODOLOGY FOR THE CHNA HAD THREE COMPONENTS: 1) THE MAPP PROCESS USED BY THE HEALTH IMPACT COLLABORATIVE OF COOK COUNTY (2/2015-6/2016); 2) USE OF THE HEALTHY COMMUNITIES INSTITUTE (HCI) PLATFORM TO REVIEW COUNTY, SERVICE AREA AND ZIP CODE DATA (3/2014-8/2016); AND 3) REVIEW OF OTHER AVAILABLE NATIONAL AND LOCAL DATA (1/2016-8/2016). MAPP PROCESSTHE HEALTH IMPACT COLLABORATIVE OF COOK COUNTY (HICCC) CONDUCTED A COLLABORATIVE CHNA BETWEEN FEBRUARY 2015 AND JUNE 2016. THE ILLINOIS PUBLIC HEALTH INSTITUTE (IPHI) DESIGNED AND FACILITATED A COLLABORATIVE, COMMUNITY-ENGAGED ASSESSMENT BASED ON THE MOBILIZING FOR ACTION THROUGH PLANNING AND PARTNERSHIPS (MAPP) FRAMEWORK. MAPP IS A COMMUNITY-DRIVEN STRATEGIC PLANNING FRAMEWORK THAT WAS DEVELOPED BY THE NATIONAL ASSOCIATION FOR COUNTY AND CITY HEALTH OFFICIALS (NACCHO) AND THE CDC. BOTH THE CHICAGO AND COOK COUNTY DEPARTMENTS OF PUBLIC HEALTH USE THE MAPP FRAMEWORK FOR COMMUNITY HEALTH ASSESSMENT AND PLANNING. THE MAPP FRAMEWORK PROMOTES A SYSTEM FOCUS, EMPHASIZING THE IMPORTANCE OF COMMUNITY ENGAGEMENT, PARTNERSHIP DEVELOPMENT AND THE DYNAMIC INTERPLAY OF FACTORS AND FORCES WITHIN THE PUBLIC HEALTH SYSTEM. THE HEALTH IMPACT COLLABORATIVE OF COOK COUNTY CHOSE THIS INCLUSIVE, COMMUNITY-DRIVEN PROCESS SO THAT THE ASSESSMENT AND IDENTIFICATION OF PRIORITY HEALTH ISSUES WOULD BE INFORMED BY THE DIRECT PARTICIPATION OF STAKEHOLDERS AND COMMUNITY RESIDENTS. THE MAPP FRAMEWORK EMPHASIZES PARTNERSHIPS AND COLLABORATION TO UNDERSCORE THE CRITICAL IMPORTANCE OF SHARED RESOURCES AND RESPONSIBILITY TO MAKE THE VISION FOR A HEALTHY FUTURE A REALITY.HICCC USED THE COUNTY HEALTH RANKINGS MODEL TO GUIDE THE SELECTION OF ASSESSMENT INDICATORS. IPHI WORKED WITH THE HEALTH DEPARTMENTS, HOSPITALS, AND COMMUNITY STAKEHOLDERS TO IDENTIFY AVAILABLE DATA RELATED TO HEALTH OUTCOMES, HEALTH BEHAVIORS, CLINICAL CARE, PHYSICAL ENVIRONMENT, AND SOCIAL AND ECONOMIC FACTORS. THE COLLABORATIVE DECIDED TO ADD MENTAL HEALTH AS AN ADDITIONAL CATEGORY OF DATA INDICATORS. AS PART OF CONTINUING EFFORTS TO ALIGN AND INTEGRATE COMMUNITY HEALTH ASSESSMENT ACROSS CHICAGO AND COOK COUNTY, HICCC LEVERAGED RECENT ASSESSMENT DATA FROM LOCAL HEALTH DEPARTMENTS WHERE POSSIBLE FOR THIS CHNA. BOTH THE CHICAGO AND COOK COUNTY DEPARTMENTS OF PUBLIC HEALTH COMPLETED COMMUNITY HEALTH ASSESSMENTS USING THE MAPP MODEL BETWEEN 2014 AND 2015. AS A RESULT, IPHI WAS ABLE TO COMPILE DATA FROM THE TWO HEALTH DEPARTMENTS' RESPECTIVE FORCES OF CHANGE AND LOCAL PUBLIC HEALTH SYSTEM ASSESSMENTS FOR DISCUSSION WITH THE SOUTH STAKEHOLDER ADVISORY TEAM, AND DATA FROM THE COMMUNITY HEALTH STATUS ASSESSMENTS WAS ALSO INCORPORATED INTO THE DATA PRESENTATION FOR THIS CHNA. THE COMMUNITY THEMES AND STRENGTHS ASSESSMENT INCLUDED BOTH FOCUS GROUPS AND COMMUNITY RESIDENT SURVEYS.

THE COMMUNITY RESIDENT SURVEY WAS INTENDED TO COMPLEMENT EXISTING COMMUNITY HEALTH SURVEYS THAT ARE CONDUCTED BY LOCAL HEALTH DEPARTMENTS FOR THEIR IPLAN COMMUNITY HEALTH ASSESSMENT PROCESSES. IPHI REVIEWED APPROXIMATELY 12 EXISTING SURVEYS TO IDENTIFY POSSIBLE QUESTIONS, AND WORKED ITERATIVELY WITH HOSPITALS, HEALTH DEPARTMENTS, AND STAKEHOLDERS FROM THE THREE REGIONS TO HONE IN ON THE MOST IMPORTANT SURVEY QUESTIONS. IPHI CONSULTED WITH THE UIC SURVEY RESEARCH LABORATORY TO REFINE THE SURVEY DESIGN. THE DATA FROM PAPER SURVEYS WAS ENTERED INTO THE ONLINE SURVEYMONKEY SYSTEM SO THAT ELECTRONIC AND PAPER SURVEY DATA COULD BE ANALYZED TOGETHER. SURVEY DATA ANALYSIS WAS CONDUCTED USING STATISTICAL ANALYSIS SOFTWARE, AND MICROSOFT EXCEL WAS USED TO CREATE SURVEY DATA TABLES AND CHARTS. THE MAJORITY OF SURVEY RESPONDENTS FROM THE SOUTH REGION IDENTIFIED AS HETEROSEXUAL (91 PERCENT, N=2146) AND AFRICAN AMERICAN/BLACK (57 PERCENT, N=2146).

THE MAIN GOALS OF THE FOCUS GROUPS WERE TO: - UNDERSTAND NEEDS, ASSETS, AND POTENTIAL RESOURCES IN THE DIFFERENT COMMUNITIES OF CHICAGO AND SUBURBAN COOK COUNTY.- START TO GATHER IDEAS ABOUT HOW HOSPITALS CAN PARTNER WITH COMMUNITIES TO IMPROVE HEALTH. EACH OF THE FOCUS GROUPS WERE HOSTED BY A HOSPITAL OR COMMUNITY-BASED ORGANIZATION, AND THE HOST ORGANIZATION RECRUITED PARTICIPANTS. IPHI FACILITATED THE FOCUS GROUPS, MOST OF WHICH WERE IMPLEMENTED IN 90-MINUTE SESSIONS WITH APPROXIMATELY 8 TO10 PARTICIPANTS. IPHI ADJUSTED THE LENGTH OF SOME SESSIONS TO BE AS SHORT AS 45 MINUTES AND AS LONG AS TWO HOURS TO ACCOMMODATE THE NEEDS OF THE PARTICIPANTS, AND SOME GROUPS INCLUDED AS MANY AS 25 PARTICIPANTS."

THIS COLLABORATIVE WAS DEVELOPED SO THAT PARTICIPATING ORGANIZATIONS COULD EFFICIENTLY SHARE RESOURCES AND WORK TOGETHER ON DATA COLLECTION, PRIORITY SETTING AND IMPLEMENTATION PLANNING. COOK COUNTY WAS DIVIDED INTO NORTH, CENTRAL AND SOUTH REGIONS TO ENABLE THE INVOLVEMENT OF OTHER LOCAL STAKEHOLDERS AND IDENTIFY THE LOCAL NEEDS OF THIS DIVERSE COUNTY. ADVOCATE TRINITY PARTICIPATED IN THE HICCC SOUTH REGION ASSESSMENT.THE METHODOLOGY FOR THE CHNA HAD THREE COMPONENTS: 1) THE MAPP PROCESS USED BY THE HEALTH IMPACT COLLABORATIVE OF COOK COUNTY (2/2015-6/2016); 2) USE OF THE HEALTHY COMMUNITIES INSTITUTE'S PLATFORM TO REVIEW COUNTY, SERVICE AREA AND ZIP CODE DATA (3/2014-8/2016); AND 3) REVIEW OF OTHER AVAILABLE NATIONAL AND LOCAL DATA (1/2016-8/2016).MAPP PROCESS THE HICCC CONDUCTED A COLLABORATIVE CHNA BETWEEN FEBRUARY 2015 AND JUNE 2016. THE ILLINOIS PUBLIC HEALTH INSTITUTE (IPHI) DESIGNED AND FACILITATED A COLLABORATIVE, COMMUNITY-ENGAGED ASSESSMENT BASED ON THE MOBILIZING FOR ACTION THROUGH PLANNING AND PARTNERSHIPS (MAPP) FRAMEWORK. MAPP IS A COMMUNITY-DRIVEN STRATEGIC PLANNING FRAMEWORK THAT WAS DEVELOPED BY THE NATIONAL ASSOCIATION FOR COUNTY AND CITY HEALTH OFFICIALS (NACCHO) AND THE CENTERS FOR DISEASE CONTROL AND PREVENTION (CDC). BOTH THE CHICAGO AND COOK COUNTY DEPARTMENTS OF PUBLIC HEALTH USE THE MAPP FRAMEWORK FOR COMMUNITY HEALTH ASSESSMENT AND PLANNING. THE MAPP FRAMEWORK PROMOTES A SYSTEM FOCUS, EMPHASIZING THE IMPORTANCE OF COMMUNITY ENGAGEMENT, PARTNERSHIP DEVELOPMENT AND THE DYNAMIC INTERPLAY OF FACTORS AND FORCES WITHIN THE PUBLIC HEALTH SYSTEM. THE HEALTH IMPACT COLLABORATIVE OF COOK COUNTY CHOSE THIS INCLUSIVE, COMMUNITY-DRIVEN PROCESS SO THAT THE ASSESSMENT AND IDENTIFICATION OF PRIORITY HEALTH ISSUES WOULD BE INFORMED BY THE DIRECT PARTICIPATION OF STAKEHOLDERS AND COMMUNITY RESIDENTS. THE MAPP FRAMEWORK EMPHASIZES PARTNERSHIPS AND COLLABORATION TO UNDERSCORE THE CRITICAL IMPORTANCE OF SHARED RESOURCES AND RESPONSIBILITY TO MAKE THE VISION FOR A HEALTHY FUTURE A REALITY.THE KEY PHASES OF THE MAPP PROCESS INCLUDE:- ORGANIZING FOR SUCCESS AND DEVELOPING PARTNERSHIPS - VISIONING - CONDUCTING THE FOUR MAPP ASSESSMENTS - IDENTIFYING STRATEGIC ISSUES - FORMULATING GOALS AND STRATEGIES - TAKING ACTION - PLANNING, IMPLEMENTING, EVALUATING THE FOUR MAPP ASSESSMENTS WERE:- COMMUNITY THEMES AND STRENGTHS ASSESSMENT (CTSA) - FORCES OF CHANGE ASSESSMENT (FOCA) - COMMUNITY HEALTH STATUS ASSESSMENT (CHSA) - LOCAL PUBLIC HEALTH SYSTEM ASSESSMENT (LPHSA) HICCC USED THE COUNTY HEALTH RANKINGS MODEL TO GUIDE THE SELECTION OF ASSESSMENT INDICATORS. IPHI WORKED WITH THE HEALTH DEPARTMENTS, HOSPITALS AND COMMUNITY STAKEHOLDERS TO IDENTIFY AVAILABLE DATA RELATED TO HEALTH OUTCOMES, HEALTH BEHAVIORS, CLINICAL CARE, PHYSICAL ENVIRONMENT, AND SOCIAL AND ECONOMIC FACTORS. THE COLLABORATIVE DECIDED TO ADD MENTAL HEALTH AS AN ADDITIONAL CATEGORY OF DATA INDICATORS. AS PART OF CONTINUING EFFORTS TO ALIGN AND INTEGRATE COMMUNITY HEALTH ASSESSMENT ACROSS CHICAGO AND COOK COUNTY, HICCC LEVERAGED RECENT ASSESSMENT DATA FROM LOCAL HEALTH DEPARTMENTS WHERE POSSIBLE FOR THIS CHNA. BOTH THE CHICAGO AND COOK COUNTY DEPARTMENTS OF PUBLIC HEALTH COMPLETED COMMUNITY HEALTH ASSESSMENTS USING THE MAPP MODEL BETWEEN 2014 AND 2015. AS A RESULT, IPHI WAS ABLE TO COMPILE DATA FROM THE TWO HEALTH DEPARTMENTS' RESPECTIVE FORCES OF CHANGE AND LOCAL PUBLIC HEALTH SYSTEM ASSESSMENTS FOR DISCUSSION WITH THE SOUTH STAKEHOLDER ADVISORY TEAM, AND DATA FROM THE COMMUNITY HEALTH STATUS ASSESSMENTS WAS ALSO INCORPORATED INTO THE DATA PRESENTATION FOR THIS CHNA. THE COMMUNITY THEMES AND STRENGTHS ASSESSMENT INCLUDED BOTH FOCUS GROUPS AND COMMUNITY RESIDENT SURVEYS. THE PURPOSE OF COLLECTING THIS COMMUNITY INPUT DATA WAS TO IDENTIFY ISSUES OF IMPORTANCE TO COMMUNITY RESIDENTS, GATHER FEEDBACK ON QUALITY OF LIFE IN THE COMMUNITY AND IDENTIFY COMMUNITY ASSETS THAT CAN BE USED TO IMPROVE COMMUNITIES.COMMUNITY SURVEYBY LEVERAGING ITS PARTNERS AND NETWORKS, THE COLLABORATIVE COLLECTED APPROXIMATELY 5,200 RESIDENT SURVEYS BETWEEN OCTOBER 2015 AND JANUARY 2016, INCLUDING 2,288 IN THE SOUTH REGION. THE SURVEY WAS AVAILABLE ON PAPER AND ONLINE AND WAS DISSEMINATED IN FIVE LANGUAGES - ENGLISH, SPANISH, POLISH, KOREAN AND ARABIC. THE MAJORITY OF THE RESPONSES WERE PAPER-BASED (ABOUT 75 PERCENT) AND ABOUT A QUARTER WERE SUBMITTED ONLINE. THE COMMUNITY RESIDENT SURVEY WAS A CONVENIENCE SAMPLE SURVEY, DISTRIBUTED BY HOSPITALS AND COMMUNITY-BASED ORGANIZATIONS THROUGH TARGETED OUTREACH TO DIVERSE COMMUNITIES IN CHICAGO AND COOK COUNTY, WITH A PARTICULAR INTEREST IN REACHING LOW-INCOME COMMUNITIES AND DIVERSE RACIAL AND ETHNIC GROUPS TO HEAR THEIR INPUT INTO THIS COMMUNITY HEALTH NEEDS ASSESSMENT. THE COMMUNITY RESIDENT SURVEY WAS INTENDED TO COMPLEMENT EXISTING COMMUNITY HEALTH SURVEYS THAT ARE CONDUCTED BY LOCAL HEALTH DEPARTMENTS FOR THEIR IPLAN COMMUNITY HEALTH ASSESSMENT PROCESSES. IPHI REVIEWED APPROXIMATELY 12 EXISTING SURVEYS TO IDENTIFY POSSIBLE QUESTIONS, AND WORKED ITERATIVELY WITH HOSPITALS, HEALTH DEPARTMENTS AND STAKEHOLDERS FROM THE THREE REGIONS TO HONE IN ON THE MOST IMPORTANT SURVEY QUESTIONS. IPHI CONSULTED WITH THE UIC SURVEY RESEARCH LABORATORY TO REFINE THE SURVEY DESIGN. THE DATA FROM PAPER SURVEYS WAS ENTERED INTO THE ONLINE SURVEYMONKEY SYSTEM SO THAT ELECTRONIC AND PAPER SURVEY DATA COULD BE ANALYZED TOGETHER. SURVEY DATA ANALYSIS WAS CONDUCTED USING SAS STATISTICAL ANALYSIS SOFTWARE, AND MICROSOFT EXCEL WAS USED TO CREATE SURVEY DATA TABLES AND CHARTS. THE MAJORITY OF SURVEY RESPONDENTS FROM THE SOUTH REGION IDENTIFIED AS HETEROSEXUAL (91 PERCENT, N=2146) AND AFRICAN AMERICAN/BLACK (57 PERCENT, N=2146). TWENTY-SEVEN PERCENT (27 PERCENT) OF SURVEY RESPONDENTS IDENTIFIED AS WHITE, 2 PERCENT ASIAN/PACIFIC ISLANDER, AND 2 PERCENT NATIVE AMERICAN/AMERICAN INDIAN. APPROXIMATELY 25 PERCENT (N=1651) OF SURVEY RESPONDENTS IN THE SOUTH REGION IDENTIFIED AS HISPANIC/LATINO AND APPROXIMATELY 10 PERCENT IDENTIFIED AS MIDDLE EASTERN (N=1651). TWO-PERCENT OF SURVEY RESPONDENTS FROM THE SOUTH REGION INDICATED THAT THEY WERE LIVING IN A SHELTER AND ONE PERCENT INDICATED THAT THEY WERE HOMELESS (N=2257). THE SOUTH REGION HAD THE HIGHEST PERCENTAGE OF INDIVIDUALS WITH LESS THAN A HIGH SCHOOL EDUCATION (12 PERCENT, N=2027) COMPARED TO THE NORTH AND CENTRAL REGIONS OF COOK COUNTY, AND THE MAJORITY OF RESPONDENTS FROM THE SOUTH REGION (68 PERCENT, N=1824) REPORTED AN ANNUAL HOUSEHOLD INCOME OF LESS THAN $40,000.FOCUS GROUPS IN SOUTH REGIONIPHI CONDUCTED EIGHT FOCUS GROUPS IN THE SOUTH REGION BETWEEN OCTOBER 2015 AND MARCH 2016. THE COLLABORATIVE ENSURED THAT THE FOCUS GROUPS INCLUDED POPULATIONS WHO ARE TYPICALLY UNDERREPRESENTED IN COMMUNITY HEALTH ASSESSMENTS, INCLUDING RACIAL AND ETHNO-CULTURAL GROUPS, IMMIGRANTS, LIMITED ENGLISH SPEAKERS, LOW-INCOME COMMUNITIES, FAMILIES WITH CHILDREN, LGBQIA AND TRANSGENDER INDIVIDUALS AND SERVICE PROVIDERS, INDIVIDUALS WITH DISABILITIES AND THEIR FAMILY MEMBERS, INDIVIDUALS WITH MENTAL HEALTH ISSUES, FORMERLY INCARCERATED INDIVIDUALS, VETERANS, SENIORS AND YOUNG ADULTS. THE MAIN GOALS OF THE FOCUS GROUPS WERE TO: 1. UNDERSTAND NEEDS, ASSETS AND POTENTIAL RESOURCES IN THE DIFFERENT COMMUNITIES OF CHICAGO AND SUBURBAN COOK COUNTY; AND 2. START TO GATHER IDEAS ABOUT HOW HOSPITALS CAN PARTNER WITH COMMUNITIES TO IMPROVE HEALTH. EACH OF THE FOCUS GROUPS WERE HOSTED BY A HOSPITAL OR COMMUNITY-BASED ORGANIZATION, AND THE HOST ORGANIZATION RECRUITED PARTICIPANTS. IPHI FACILITATED THE FOCUS GROUPS, MOST OF WHICH WERE IMPLEMENTED IN 90-MINUTE SESSIONS WITH APPROXIMATELY EIGHT TO 10 PARTICIPANTS. IPHI ADJUSTED THE LENGTH OF SOME SESSIONS TO BE AS SHORT AS 45 MINUTES AND AS LONG AS TWO HOURS TO ACCOMMODATE THE NEEDS OF THE PARTICIPANTS, AND SOME GROUPS INCLUDED AS MANY AS 25 PARTICIPANTS."

Under ASU 2014-09 the estimated uncollectible amounts due from these patients are generally considered implicit price consessions that are a direct reduction to net operating revenues.

202022269349301522,042790311,"Part II, Community Building Activities:","The following description is not quantified specifically in Part II of Schedule H. The hospital facility is committed to creating healthier communities and understands that many state and federal mandated community benefit programs and services are not sufficent to address ethnic, racial and economic health disparities and inequities. The hospital embraces the traditional definition of ""health"" to include economic opportunity, affordable housing, quality education, safe neighborhoods, food security, social and racial justice, and the arts/culture - all elements that are needed for individuals, families and communities to thrive. The hospital provides many valuable services, resources, programs and financial support - beyond the walls of the hospital and into the communities and homes of the people it serves; including grants and sponsorship of local community-based organizations and the involvement of Baystate leadership with various community boards that align with its mission. The hospital facility provided $220,398 as Payment in Lieu of Taxes (PILOT) to the City of Springfield for its facilities at 3400 Main Street and 11 Wilbraham Road. Baystate Medical Center provided $14,850 as a Payment in Lieu of Taxes (PILOT) to the City of Chicopee for an employee parking lot located at Center Street, Chicopee. The hospital facility is a dues paying member of the Economic Development Council of Western Massachusetts (EDC) and the Springfield Regional Chamber of Commerce, in the amount of $86,249. The hospital participates in the EDC and local Chambers as it is the largest employer in the region. The Chamber and its members coordinate activities toward a common purpose of sustainability and economic growth for the region."
202022269349301522,042790311,"Part III, Line 4:","The cost of bad debts reported in Part III, line 2 was calculated by applying a ratio of cost to charges (based on the organization's cost accounting system including all hospital inpatients and outpatients) against total implicit price concessions as reflected in the audited financial statements. The portion of bad debt that reasonably could be attributable to patients who may qualify for financial assistance under the hospital's charity care program (reported in Part III line 3) was calculated by applying the percentage of bad debts by zip code (for which the average household income for each zip code is less than 150% of the federal poverty level) to the total cost of bad debt reported in Part III line 2. Since this portion of bad debt is attributable to patients residing in an area where the average income is less than 150% of the Federal poverty level, it is highly likely these patients would have qualified for the organization's charity care program had they applied. For this reason, we believe the amount, totalling $1,260,637 should be treated as community benefit expense in Part I. As noted above, the organization adopted Accounting Standards Update 2014-09 effective October 1, 2018, which changed the way entities report and disclose certain financial information including implicit price concession (formerly the provision for bad debts). See audited financial statements, footnote #2 (Significant Accounting Policies) on page 15 under the caption ""Net Patient Service Revenue and page 17 under the caption ""Recently Adopted Accounting Pronouncements"" for a description of the organization's reporting of its implicit price concessions (formerly provision for bad debts).If a patient is determined eligible for financial assistance, the appropriate adjustment is made to the patient account based on their income level. Once the necessary approvals are obtained, it then flows to the general ledger.

202022269349301522,042790311,"Part VI, Line 4:","The following ""community information"" description is extracted from the hospital's 2019 CHNA. Baystate Medical Center (Baystate Medical) is a 724-bed academic medical center based in Springfield, Massachusetts. Baystate Medical is home to western New England's only tertiary care referral medical center, Level I Trauma Center and Level II Pediatric Trauma Center, and neonatal and pediatric intensive care units. The medical center also includes Baystate Children's Hospital and the Wesson Women and Infants' Unit, and is the regional campus of the University of Massachusetts Medical School - Baystate. Baystate Medical is also the community's major referral hospital, providing the highest level of care for conditions such as cancer, acute, and chronic cardiovascular illness, nervous system illness, digestive illness, and other diseases that affect the major organs of the body.The service area for Baystate Medical includes all 23 communities within Hampden County, including the third largest city in Massachusetts - Springfield (population over 150,000). Three adjacent cities (Holyoke, Chicopee, and West Springfield) create a densely-populated urban core that includes over half of the population of the service area (270,000 people), and 91% of Hampden County is classified as urban (US Census, 2013-2017). Smaller communities exist to the east and west of this central core area. Many of these communities have populations under 20,000 people. The Pioneer Valley Transit Authority, the second largest public transit system in the state, serves 11 communities in the service area, and connects suburban areas to the core cities and services.The service area has more racial and ethnic diversity than many other parts of western Massachusetts. County-wide, 24% of the population is Latino, 8% is black, and 2% is Asian (ACS, 2013-2017), though this diversity is not equally spread throughout the region and tends to be concentrated in the urban core. A substantial proportion of the county's population is from other countries. In 2017, 22% of the state's immigrants came to western Massachusetts. West Springfield has welcomed the highest proportion in Hampden County; 15% of the city's population are foreign-born (US Census, ACS, 2013-2017). Economically, the Baystate Medical service area is home to many of the largest employers in the region as well as numerous colleges and universities, and provides a strong economic engine for the broader region. The largest industies and employers include health care service, and wholesale trade and manufacturing. At the same time, the county struggles with higher rates of unemployment and poverty, lower household incomes, and lower rates of educational attainment. The median household income in the service area is about $52,000 ($22,000 less than the state). The poverty rate is more than 60% higher than statewide, and the child poverty rate is an alarming 27%, with more than one out of every four children in Hampden County living in poverty (ACS, 2013-2017). Despite being at the core of the Knowledge Corridor region, only 27% of the population age 25 and over has a bachelor's degree, compared to 43% statewide. Unemployment is somewhat higher than the state average. The median age for the service area is similar to that of Massachusetts, although in Springfield the median age is about 33 years of age compared to 39 in Hampden County. The population over 45 years old is growing as a percentage of the total population (Table 2). To give a sense of the change in service needs necessary, by 2035, the proportion of the people over the age of 60 is projected to grow from 20% of the population to 28% in Hampden County, with the number of older adults increasing from approximately 92,000 in 2010 to an estimated 140,000 in 2035. In Hampden County 16% of the population has a disablity compared to the state rate of 12%. In Springfield and Holyoke, disability rates are high at almost 20% and 17% respectively. In Hampden County, 11% of youth under 18 have disabiltiy (state - 7%). By race and ethnicity, 6% of white children, 10% of Latino children, and 6% of black children have a disability (US Census, ACS, 2013-2017). People with disabilities tend to have higher rates of poverty and lower levels of education. In Hampden County, poverty rates among those with a disability (27%) were more than double those among people without a disability (12%). Similarly, 30% of the disabled population did not have a high school diploma compared to 11% among those without a disability (US Census, ACS, 2013-2017)."

Reg 1.501(r)-3, will not be considered a failure to meet a requirement of Section 501(r) if: (1) such omission or error was minor and either inadvertent or due to reasonable cause; and (2) the hospital facility corrects such omission or error as promptly after discovery as is reasonable given the nature of the omission or error.In Tax Year 2018 the hospital conducted its CHNA, which was adopted by the Board of Trustees prior to the September 30, 2019 year end. The hospital inadvertently neglected to timely post the CHNA to the hospital website before the end of the tax year. When it was determined that hospital had not uploaded the current CHNA to the hospital website, the Baystate tax department coordinated the posting of the CHNA with community benefits and the website department. The posting was completed by the website department on November 13, 2019.Baystate has reviewed the current policies and procedures and is adopting a formal Community Benefits Policy to ensure compliance with the requirements of Section 501(r), and related regulations. The system intends to regulary monitor the effectiveness of the adopted policies to ensure the hospital maintains compliance with Section 501(r) on an on-going basis. As part of the process improvements, during future CHNA implementation years, Baystate will post interim reports on the system website in mid-summer, allowing for community and public review and comments, prior to publishing the final CHNA reports approved by the Board of Trustees at the end of September.To the best of our knowledge, the delay did not affect any individuals, therefore the error will not be considered a failure to meed a requirement of Section 501(r). The hospital has corrected and is self-disclosing the inadvertent omission, and as of the filing of this form 990, the hospital is in compliance with Treas. Reg 1.501(r)-3 requirements for completing its community health needs assessment."

ADVOCATE'S BOARD, LEADERSHIP AND TEAM MEMBERS (STAFF/EMPLOYEES) ARE COMMITTED TO POSITIVELY AFFECTING THE HEALTH STATUS AND QUALITY OF LIFE OF INDIVIDUALS AND POPULATIONS IN COMMUNITIES SERVED BY ADVOCATE THROUGH PROGRAMS AND PRACTICES THAT REFLECT THIS MISSION. THE ORGANIZATION CONTINUES TO DEVELOP AND SUPPORT INITIATIVES THAT ENHANCE ACCESS TO HEALTH AND WELLNESS SERVICES. AS SUCH, SYSTEM LEADERSHIP DIRECTS AND SUPPORTS THE HOSPITALS IN THEIR EFFORTS TO ADDRESS IDENTIFIED COMMUNITY HEALTH NEEDS.IN 2016, ADVOCATE CREATED A COMMUNITY HEALTH DEPARTMENT THAT IS LED BY A SYSTEM EXECUTIVE AND STAFFED WITH PUBLIC/COMMUNITY HEALTH SPECIALISTS TO EXECUTE COMMUNITY NEEDS ASSESSMENTS, EVIDENCE-BASED PROGRAM DEVELOPMENT AND COLLABORATIVE PARTNERSHIPS WITHIN THE COMMUNITIES SERVED BY ADVOCATE. PRIOR TO THIS TIME, THE COMMUNITY FACING FUNCTION WAS LED BY A TEAM OF SYSTEM-LEVEL INDIVIDUALS WHOSE JOB RESPONSIBILITIES INCLUDED VARIOUS COMMUNITY ROLES MORE CLOSELY ALIGNED WITH COMMUNITY RELATIONS. DURING THE INITIAL 2011-2013 COMMUNITY HEALTH NEEDS ASSESSMENT (CHNA) CYCLE, THE SYSTEM LEADERS PROVIDED OVERSIGHT AND SUPPORT TO THE HOSPITALS FOR DEVELOPING THEIR CHNAS AND SUBSEQUENT PROGRAMMING. IN 2016, ADVOCATE'S NEW COMMUNITY HEALTH TEAM CONDUCTED THEIR HOSPITAL'S COMPREHENSIVE CHNAS (2014-2016) AND POSTED GOVERNANCE-APPROVED CHNA REPORTS AND CHNA IMPLEMENTATION PLANS ON ADVOCATE'S WEBPAGE IN COMPLIANCE WITH THE AFFORDABLE CARE ACT.AT THE DIRECTION OF THE SYSTEM LEVEL, COMMUNITY HEALTH DEPARTMENT LEADERSHIP ALSO MET MONTHLY IN LATE 2016 THROUGH FIRST QUARTER 2017 TO SIGNIFICANTLY REVISE ADVOCATE HEALTH CARE'S COMMUNITY BENEFITS PLAN. THE PLANS GOALS AND OBJECTIVES WERE CRAFTED AND EXPANDED TO BUILD ON RECENT LEARNINGS AND INCREASED FOCUS ON COMMUNITY HEALTH. THE PLAN'S BROAD GOALS AND OBJECTIVES WERE DESIGNED TO STRUCTURE SYSTEM-WIDE COMMUNITY BENEFITS ACTIVITIES WITHIN A STRATEGIC FRAMEWORK. INCLUDED IN THE COMMUNITY BENEFITS PLAN ARE GOALS FOCUSED ON SYSTEM-WIDE EFFORTS TO ADDRESS THE BROADER ISSUES OF DISPARITY AND ACCESS, AND TO ALIGN HOSPITAL COMMUNITY HEALTH PLANS WITH SYSTEM STRATEGY AS COMMUNITY HEALTH PLANS AND IMPLEMENTATION STRATEGIES EVOLVE. ADVOCATE'S COMMUNITY BENEFITS PLAN ALSO SETS THE COURSE FOR STRENGTHENING EXISTING PARTNERSHIPS AND BUILDING NEW ONES TO LEVERAGE AND MAXIMIZE THE IMPACT OF ADVOCATE'S PROGRAMS IN ITS SERVICE AREAS. ADVOCATE'S COMMUNITY BENEFITS PLAN GOALS AND SPECIFIC EXAMPLES OF PROGRAMS AND SERVICES THAT ARE DIRECTED AND MANAGED AT THE SYSTEM LEVEL ARE PROVIDED BELOW.GOAL A: OPTIMIZE ADVOCATE'S CAPACITY TO MANAGE AN EFFECTIVE COMMUNITY HEALTH STRATEGY BY IMPLEMENTING REGULAR COMMUNITY HEALTH ASSESSMENTS (CHNAS) AND USING DATA FROM THESE ASSESSMENTS TO GUIDE PROGRAM DEVELOPMENT.DURING 2016, ALL ELEVEN ADVOCATE HEALTH CARE HOSPITALS COMPLETED COMPREHENSIVE COMMUNITY HEALTH NEEDS ASSESSMENTS IN COLLABORATION WITH HEALTH DEPARTMENTS, OTHER HOSPITALS, AND COMMUNITY ORGANIZATIONS. ADVOCATE CHILDREN'S HOSPITAL, WITH INTEGRATED SITES AT BOTH ADVOCATE LUTHERAN GENERAL HOSPITAL (ADVOCATE LUTHERAN GENERAL) AND ADVOCATE CHRIST MEDICAL CENTER (ADVOCATE CHRIST), CONTRIBUTED TO ASSESSMENTS AT THOSE TWO HOSPITALS. ALL THE ADVOCATE HOSPITAL ASSESSMENTS ARE AVAILABLE THROUGH THE ADVOCATE WEBSITE AT: HTTP://WWW.ADVOCATEHEALTH.COM/CHNAREPORTSAS A FIRST STEP TOWARD DEVELOPING A 2017-2019 IMPLEMENTATION PLAN, THE SYSTEM DIRECTED THE HOSPITAL COMMUNITY HEALTH LEADERS AND STAFF TO IDENTIFY THE STRENGTHS AND OPPORTUNITIES FOR IMPROVEMENT WITHIN THE JUST COMPLETED CYCLE (2014-2016), AS WELL AS IDEAS FOR NEW DATA SOURCES, AND NEEDS FOR PROFESSIONAL DEVELOPMENT RELATED TO THE OVERALL CHNA PROCESS. A NUMBER OF STRENGTHS WERE IDENTIFIED INCLUDING DEVELOPMENT OF LOCAL COMMUNITY HEALTH COUNCILS (CHC), INVOLVEMENT OF HOSPITAL GOVERNING COUNCIL MEMBERS IN THE CHCS, PARTNERSHIPS WITH HEALTH DEPARTMENTS, DATA FROM CONDUENT-HEALTHY COMMUNITIES INSTITUTE, ESPECIALLY THE ZIP CODE LEVEL HOSPITALIZATION AND EMERGENCY ROOM UTILIZATION DATA, AND THE SHARING OF TEMPLATES AND APPROACHES ACROSS HOSPITAL SITES. ADDITIONAL PROFESSIONAL DEVELOPMENT REGARDING DATA RETRIEVAL, ANALYSIS AND SUMMARIZATION, AS WELL AS PROGRAM DEVELOPMENT, WERE IDENTIFIED. A PROFESSIONAL DEVELOPMENT PLAN WAS IMPLEMENTED FOR ALL INTERNAL COMMUNITY HEALTH STAFF IN 2017. CHNA DATA TRAINING WAS CONDUCTED USING THE HEALTHY COMMUNITIES INSTITUTE (HCI) PLATFORM WITH THE TEAM RECEIVING TRAINING REGARDING RUNNING VARIOUS TYPES OF REPORTS AND CROSS COMPARING DATA IN HCI. UPDATE PRESENTATIONS WERE HELD AT SELECTED MONTHLY STAFF MEETINGS REGARDING NEW CAPACITIES OF THE HCI PLATFORM FOR REPORTS AND DATA PRESENTATION. ADDITIONALLY, ALL STAFF PROVIDED INPUT REGARDING TRAINING NEEDS RESULTING IN THE ESTABLISHMENT OF A SET OF MINIMUM STANDARD DATA REQUIREMENTS ADVOCATE IS NOW USING FOR THE NEXT CHNA CYCLE. COMMUNITY HEALTH STAFF PULLED DATA AS PART OF LEARNING EXERCISES AND SHARED FINDINGS FROM THEIR UNIQUE SERVICE AREAS WITH PEERS IN A PEER REVIEW MODEL. IN 2018, TRAINING FOCUSED ON DATA ANALYSIS, DATA INTERPRETATION AND PROGRAM DEVELOPMENT AND EVALUATION. GOAL B: UNDERTAKE OR SUPPORT INITIATIVES THAT ENHANCE ACCESS TO HEALTH CARE, PREVENTION AND WELLNESS SERVICES ACROSS THE LIFESPAN AND WITHIN THE DIVERSE COMMUNITIES ADVOCATE SERVES.CHARITY CARE. AS A NON-PROFIT HEALTH CARE SYSTEM, ADVOCATE PROVIDES CHARITY AND FINANCIAL ASSISTANCE TO PATIENTS IN NEED. ALTHOUGH ADVOCATE'S SYSTEM-WIDE CHARITY CARE POLICY IS VERY GENEROUS, ADVOCATE CONTINUES TO REVIEW AND REFINE ITS POLICY IN AN ONGOING EFFORT TO ENSURE THAT FINANCIAL ASSISTANCE IS AVAILABLE TO THOSE IN NEED IN A TIMELY MANNER. WHILE EACH HOSPITAL HAS A CHARITY CARE COUNCIL TO REVIEW APPLICATIONS AND DETERMINE ELIGIBILITY, SYSTEM FINANCE LEADERS ARE RESPONSIBLE FOR ONGOING POLICY REVIEW AND REFINEMENTS TO ASSURE THAT ADVOCATE CONTINUES TO PROVIDE FINANCIAL ASSISTANCE TO INDIVIDUALS WHO NEED HELP, WHEN THEY NEED IT. FEDERALLY QUALIFIED HEALTH CENTERS (FQHC). IN ADDITION, ADVOCATE'S SYSTEM LEADERS ENCOURAGE AND SUPPORT ITS HOSPITALS' INITIATIVES TO PARTNER WITH FQHC'S, PUBLIC HEALTH DEPARTMENTS AND COMMUNITY CLINICS IN ORDER TO ASSIST THE UNINSURED IN FINDING INSURANCE COVERAGE AND MEDICAL SERVICES. FOR EXAMPLE, ADVOCATE SOUTH SUBURBAN HOSPITAL (ADVOCATE SOUTH SUBURBAN) HAS A PARTNERSHIP WITH AUNT MARTHA'S YOUTH SERVICE CENTER, AN FQHC, TO IMPROVE ACCESS TO PRIMARY CARE SERVICES FOR UNINSURED AND UNDERINSURED INDIVIDUALS IN ITS SERVICE AREA. ADVOCATE BROMENN MEDICAL CENTER (ADVOCATE BROMENN) MAINTAINS A COMMUNITY HEALTH CLINIC IN COLLABORATION WITH OSF ST. JOSEPH'S HOSPITAL, WHEREBY ADVOCATE BROMENN IS RESPONSIBLE FOR A PORTION OF THE HOSPITAL CARE FOR THE CLINIC PATIENTS' HOSPITAL CARE THROUGHOUT THE YEAR. ADVOCATE BROMENN IS ALSO THE SOLE PROVIDER OF THE CLINIC'S INFORMATION TECHNOLOGY (IT) SUPPORT AND PROVIDES THE SPACE OCCUPIED BY THE CLINIC. IN ADDITION, ADVOCATE BROMENN, THROUGH AN INFORMAL REFERRAL AGREEMENT IN PLACE SINCE 2010, COLLABORATES WITH CHESTNUT HEALTH SYSTEMS. CHESTNUT HEALTH SYSTEMS OWNS AND OPERATES AN FQHC IN BLOOMINGTON AND PATIENTS ARE SOMETIMES REFERRED TO ADVOCATE BROMENN FOR SERVICES. WORKING WITH OTHER AREA HOSPITALS, ADVOCATE GOOD SAMARITAN HOSPITAL (ADVOCATE GOOD SAMARITAN) PROVIDES SUPPORT THROUGH THE DUPAGE HEALTH COALITION TO SUSTAIN THE ACCESS DUPAGE COMMUNITY PROGRAM - A COMMUNITY COLLABORATION DESIGNED TO PROVIDE LOW-COST PRIMARY MEDICAL CARE SERVICES TO THE LOW-INCOME, MEDICALLY UNINSURED RESIDENTS OF DUPAGE COUNTY.

THE ADVOCATE/MERIDIAN FHP PARTNERSHIP AND COLLABORATION WAS DRIVEN LARGELY BY CHANGES TO THE MEDICAID PROGRAM IN ILLINOIS AND WAS DESIGNED TO ENSURE CURRENT MEDICAID MEMBERS CONTINUE TO RECEIVE HIGH-QUALITY AND WELL-COORDINATED CARE DELIVERED IN AN APPROPRIATE SETTING. ADVOCATE HAS A STRONG HISTORY OF PROVIDING HIGH QUALITY CARE FOR THE MEDICAID POPULATION WITHIN OUR NETWORK WITH KEY FOCUS AREAS, INCLUDING IMPROVED CARE COORDINATION, ACCESS AND QUALITY PERFORMANCE. ADVOCATE HAS AND WILL CONTINUE TO APPLY ITS ACHIEVEMENTS AND LESSONS LEARNED FROM ITS MEDICARE AND COMMERCIAL ACOS TO THE ADVOCATE/MERIDIAN FHP PARTNERSHIP.COMMUNITY HEALTH WORKERS (CHWS). IN 2016, ADVOCATE EMBARKED ON A QUALITY IMPROVEMENT PROJECT TO ENGAGE AND EDUCATE MEDICAID BENEFICIARIES SEEN IN THE ADVOCATE CHRIST EMERGENCY DEPARTMENT ON APPROPRIATE LEVEL OF CARE OPTIONS AVAILABLE TO THEM USING COMMUNITY HEALTH WORKERS. THE MAIN OBJECTIVES OF THE PRIMARY CARE CONNECTIONS INTERVENTION WERE: 1) TO EDUCATE AND SCHEDULE LOW ACUITY PATIENTS WHO VISIT THE ADVOCATE CHRIST EMERGENCY DEPARTMENT REGARDING ALTERNATIVE CARE OPTIONS AVAILABLE TO THEM WITHIN THEIR COMMUNITIES; AND 2) EDUCATE AND SCHEDULE LOW ACUITY MEDICAID PATIENTS FOR FOLLOW-UP APPOINTMENTS WITH THEIR ADVOCATE PRIMARY CARE PHYSICIAN (PCP) OR AN FQHC WHEN THE BENEFICIARY DOES NOT HAVE AN ESTABLISHED PRIMARY CARE MEDICAL HOME.FQHC'S AND COMMUNITY-BASED RESOURCES PROVIDE SERVICES FOR MEDICAID BENEFICIARIES WITH SPECIFIC SOCIAL DETERMINANTS OF HEALTH BARRIERS TO CARE, INCLUDING HOUSING INSECURITY, UTILITY NEEDS AND INTERPERSONAL VIOLENCE, WHICH ARE IMPORTANT TO ADDRESS FOR IMPROVING OUTCOMES FOR VULNERABLE POPULATIONS. IN 2018, THE PROGRAM WAS EXPANDED TO THREE ADDITIONAL ILLINOIS HOSPITALS-ADVOCATE TRINITY HOSPITAL (ADVOCATE TRINITY), ADVOCATE CONDELL MEDICAL CENTER (ADVOCATE CONDELL) AND ADVOCATE SHERMAN HOSPITAL (ADVOCATE SHERMAN). AS OF DEC. 2018, MORE THAN 20,560 PATIENTS WERE ENGAGED, OF WHICH 30% (OVER 6,100 PATIENTS) WERE SCHEDULED FOR A FOLLOW-UP APPOINTMENT WITH AN ADVOCATE PCP OR FQHC. AS A RESULT, 98% OF THESE PATIENTS WHO WERE ENGAGED WITH THE PRIMARY CARE CONNECTION INTERVENTION DID NOT RETURN TO THE EMERGENCY ROOM FOR A LOW ACUITY VISIT.ADVOCATE CONTINUES TO PURSUE QUALITY AND UTILIZATION IMPROVEMENT ACTIVITIES LIKE THE PRIMARY CARE CONNECTIONS INTERVENTION TO ACTIVELY MANAGE AND ENGAGE THE ADVOCATE/MERIDIAN FHP MEMBERS IN ORDER TO ACHIEVE THE QUADRUPLE AIM OF IMPROVED PHYSICIAN AND PATIENT EXPERIENCE, BETTER PATIENT OUTCOMES, AND REDUCTIONS IN THE TOTAL COSTS OF CARE.LANGUAGE SERVICES. ADVOCATE IS ALSO COMMITTED TO PROVIDING ITS PATIENTS AND FAMILIES WITH LANGUAGE AND OTHER CULTURALLY APPROPRIATE SERVICES TO IMPROVE ACCESS TO CARE. A SYSTEM-LEVEL DIRECTOR HAS OVERSIGHT OF LANGUAGE SERVICES THROUGHOUT ADVOCATE. ADVOCATE'S PATIENT ACCESS DEPARTMENT MONITORS AND REFINES ASSOCIATE SCRIPTING TO ENSURE THAT LANGUAGE NEED IS CORRECTLY IDENTIFIED DURING THE REGISTRATION PROCESS. THIS ASSISTS WITH CORRECTLY ROUNDING ON PATIENTS AND ENSURING INTERPRETERS ARE AVAILABLE WHEN NEEDED. IN 2018, ADVOCATE PROVIDED INTERPRETING SERVICES FOR OVER 250,000 PATIENT/FAMILY MEMBER/COMPANION ENCOUNTERS-UP FROM 220,000 ENCOUNTERS THE PREVIOUS YEAR. AS THE NEED FOR THESE SERVICES INCREASES, ADVOCATE CONTINUES TO ANTICIPATE AND IMPLEMENT CHANGES TO MEET THE UNIQUE INTERPRETATION NEEDS OF PATIENTS. ONE SUCH CHANGE, WHICH CONTINUES TO INCREASE THE VOLUME OF INTERPRETER SERVICES EACH YEAR, IS THE USE OF VIDEO REMOTE INTERPRETING (VRI). SIMILAR TO SKYPE TECHNOLOGY, WHEN A TEAM MEMBER (EMPLOYEE/STAFF) CLICKS OR TOUCHES THE SCREEN FOR A NEEDED LANGUAGE, AN INTERPRETER APPEARS ON THE COMPUTER OR IPAD SCREEN TO INTERPRET IN ONE OF 32 AVAILABLE LANGUAGES. IN ADDITION TO VRI, OVER 200 LANGUAGES ARE OFFERED VIA TELEPHONIC INTERPRETING. WHEN TELEPHONIC OR VRI ARE NOT APPROPRIATE FOR THE PATIENT ENCOUNTER, ONSITE AGENCY INTERPRETERS ARE PROVIDED. FIVE (5) ADVOCATE HOSPITALS EMPLOY SPANISH AND POLISH INTERPRETERS DUE TO THE HIGH VOLUME OF PATIENTS SPEAKING THESE LANGUAGES. ADVOCATE TYPICALLY ACCESSES OVER 150 DIFFERENT LANGUAGES PER YEAR TO MEET PATIENTS' NEEDS.IN 2018, A NEW FORM WAS ADDED TO CARE CONNECTION FOR THE NURSING ADMISSION PROCESS. THERE IS ALSO A FORM FOR LANGUAGE SERVICES TO INPUT ANY CHANGES NEEDED-CALLED AN AD HOC FORM. THE FORM SUPPORTS THE NURSE IN IDENTIFYING LANGUAGE ASSISTANCE NEEDS OF THE PATIENT AND FAMILY MEMBERS/COMPANION. VITAL DOCUMENTS CONTINUE TO BE TRANSLATED. SIGNAGE IS POSTED INDICATING THAT INTERPRETING SERVICES ARE AVAILABLE. SEVERAL HOSPITALS CONTINUE TO HAVE PATIENT WHITE BOARDS TRANSLATED INTO SPANISH AND POLISH WITH ENGLISH SUBTITLES SO THAT PATIENTS ARE AWARE OF THEIR PLAN FOR THE DAY IN THEIR LANGUAGE.TO EVALUATE HOW WELL THE SITES ARE DOING WITH PROVIDING INTERPRETING SERVICES, A RESPONSE TO THE STATEMENT, ""IF ENGLISH IS NOT YOUR PRIMARY LANGUAGE, THE DEGREE TO WHICH YOUR COMMUNICATION NEEDS WERE MET,"" IS REQUESTED ON NON-ENGLISH PRESS GANEY SURVEYS. THE PATIENT IS ASKED TO RATE THE SERVICES RECEIVED BETWEEN 1 AND 5, WITH 5 BEING THE HIGHEST SCORE. CURRENTLY THREE HOSPITALS-ADVOCATE CHRIST, ADVOCATE ILLINOIS MASONIC MEDICAL CENTER (ADVOCATE ILLINOIS MASONIC) AND ADVOCATE LUTHERAN GENERAL-PARTICIPATE. THE AVERAGE SCORE FOR 2018 REMAINED AT 89% FAVORABLE. GIVEN THE LOW RATE OF RETURN, THIS NUMBER IS NOT CONSIDERED TO BE STATISTICALLY SIGNIFICANT.THE READMISSION RATE OF NON-ENGLISH SPEAKING PATIENTS IS ALSO TRACKED AND COMPARED TO THE READMISSION RATE OF ENGLISH-SPEAKING PATIENTS. THE NON-ENGLISH READMISSION RATE CONTINUES TO BE CLOSE TO THE ENGLISH-SPEAKING PATIENT READMISSION RATE.ONE QUALITY AUDIT WAS CONDUCTED IN 2018 THAT FOCUSED ON THE KNOWLEDGE OF CLINICAL CARE PROVIDERS. THE OVERALL RESULT WAS ""COMPETENT."" RESULTS WERE CONVEYED AND CORRECTIVE ACTION PLANS COMPLETED AT TWO SITES. LANGUAGE SERVICES CONTINUES TO PARTICIPATE IN PATIENT SAFETY HUDDLES AND REPORTS THE NUMBER OF INDIVIDUALS NEEDING INTERPRETING SERVICES AS WELL AS LANGUAGE SERVICES EVENTS. PATIENT SAFETY EVENTS ARE ALSO REPORTED AT THE SYSTEM SAFETY HUDDLE. THIS ASSISTS WITH IDENTIFYING LANGUAGE SERVICE ISSUES THAT MAY BE OCCURRING ACROSS THE SYSTEM.PARISH NURSE MINISTRY. ADVOCATE FULLY FUNDS THREE FAITH COMMUNITY NURSE POSITIONS SERVING THREE CONGREGATIONS IN LOW-INCOME, HIGH NEED COMMUNITIES. THESE FAITH COMMUNITY NURSES PROVIDE HEALTH EDUCATION, WELLNESS PROMOTION, NAVIGATION AND CARE MANAGEMENT, HEALTH SCREENINGS, ADVOCACY AND SPIRITUAL SUPPORT TO THE MEMBERS OF THEIR CONGREGATIONS AND TO THE WIDER COMMUNITIES THAT THEY SERVE. MANY OF THE PEOPLE SERVED ARE HOMELESS, MARGINALIZED OR CHRONICALLY ILL INDIVIDUALS. IN ADDITION, ADVOCATE SUPPORTS A FAITH COMMUNITY NURSE SUPPORT NETWORK OF 37 NURSES THAT SERVE CONGREGATIONS ACROSS THE CHICAGOLAND REGION.ADVOCATE ALSO FUNDS SYSTEM LEVEL PROGRAMS AND ACTIVITIES FOCUSED ON POSITIVELY AFFECTING THE HEALTH STATUS AND QUALITY OF LIFE OF INDIVIDUALS AND POPULATIONS IN COMMUNITIES SERVED BY ADVOCATE. TWO EXAMPLES OF SUCH PROGRAMS FOLLOW. ADVOCATE BETHANY COMMUNITY HEALTH FUND (BETHANY FUND). ESTABLISHED IN 2006 BY ADVOCATE HEALTH CARE AS PART OF AN ONGOING COMMITMENT TO HELP BUILD, PROMOTE AND SUSTAIN HEALTHY COMMUNITIES ON CHICAGO'S WEST SIDE, THE BETHANY FUND SUPPORTS NONPROFIT ORGANIZATIONS THAT ARE IN THE COMMUNITIES HISTORICALLY SERVED BY ADVOCATE BETHANY HOSPITAL (NOW RML CHICAGO)-AUSTIN, GARFIELD PARK, HUMBOLDT PARK AND NORTH LAWNDALE. THE FUND DOES THIS THROUGH PROGRAM GRANTS, ORGANIZATIONAL CAPACITY BUILDING EVENTS AND PARTNERSHIPS TO BUILD ON THE ASSETS OF THESE VULNERABLE COMMUNITIES. IN 2018, THE BETHANY FUND AWARDED $815,000 IN PROGRAM GRANTS ADDRESSING ITS PRIORITY AREAS OF DIABETES, SCHOOL DROPOUT PREVENTION, VIOLENCE PREVENTION AND WORKFORCE DEVELOPMENT.CENTER FOR FAITH AND COMMUNITY HEALTH TRANSFORMATION. THE CENTER FOR FAITH AND COMMUNITY HEALTH TRANSFORMATION WORKS TO ADVANCE HEALTH EQUITY BY PARTNERING WITH FAITH-BASED AND COMMUNITY ORGANIZATIONS TO BUILD COMMUNITY, NURTURE LEADERS AND CONNECT THE UNIQUE SPIRIT POWER OF FAITH COMMUNITIES TO PROMOTE SOCIAL JUSTICE AND ABUNDANT LIFE FOR INDIVIDUALS, FAMILIES AND COMMUNITIES. THE CENTER IS A PARTNERSHIP BETWEEN ADVOCATE AND THE OFFICE FOR COMMUNITY ENGAGEMENT AND NEIGHBORHOOD HEALTH PARTNERSHIPS AT THE UNIVERSITY OF ILLINOIS AT CHICAGO. CURRENTLY, THE CENTER IS CONVENING A TRAUMA INFORMED CONGREGATIONS NETWORK TO SUPPORT THE CAPACITY OF FAITH COMMUNITIES TO PREVENT TRAUMA AND TO BE PLACES OF HEALING FOR THOSE WHO HAVE EXPERIENCED ADVERSITY IN CHILDHOOD OR THROUGHOUT THEIR LIVES."

IN PREPARATION FOR THE 2014-2016 CHNA, ADVOCATE PURCHASED ACCESS TO A TOOL THAT COULD BE USED BY ALL OF ITS HOSPITALS TO IDENTIFY PRIORITY OPPORTUNITIES TO IMPACT THE SOCIAL DETERMINANTS OF HEALTH IN THE COMMUNITIES SERVED BY ADVOCATE. INCLUDED IN THIS TOOL, DEVELOPED BY THE HEALTHY COMMUNITIES INSTITUTE, IS THE SOCIONEEDS INDEX. THE SOCIONEEDS INDEX IS A MEASURE OF SOCIOECONOMIC NEED THAT IS CORRELATED WITH POOR HEALTH OUTCOMES. INDICATORS FOR THE INDEX ARE WEIGHTED TO MAXIMIZE THE CORRELATION OF THE INDEX WITH PREMATURE DEATH RATES AND PREVENTABLE HOSPITALIZATION RATES. THIS INDEX COMBINES MULTIPLE SOCIOECONOMIC INDICATORS INTO A SINGLE COMPOSITE VALUE. AS A SINGLE INDICATOR, THE INDEX CAN SERVE AS A CONCISE WAY TO EXPLAIN WHICH AREAS ARE OF HIGHEST NEED. A MAP WAS THEN PREPARED FOR EACH HOSPITAL SERVICE AREA ENABLING THE COMMUNITY HEALTH COUNCILS TO FOCUS PRIORITY SETTING AND PROGRAM PLANNING ON COMMUNITIES AT HIGHER LEVELS OF SOCIOECONOMIC NEED. THE INDEX IS ALSO BEING USED FOR THE 2017-2019 CHNA PROCESS.ALLIANCE FOR HEALTH EQUITY (FORMERLY KNOWN AS THE HEALTH IMPACT COLLABORATIVE OF COOK COUNTY). IN 2015, COMMUNITY HEALTH LEADERS FROM ADVOCATE, PRESENCE HEALTH, THE ILLINOIS PUBLIC HEALTH INSTITUTE (IPHA), THE CHICAGO DEPARTMENT OF HEALTH (CDPH) AND THE COOK COUNTY DEPARTMENT OF PUBLIC HEALTH (CCDPH) CAME TOGETHER TO FORM THE HEALTH IMPACT COLLABORATIVE OF COOK COUNTY (HICCC). EVENTUALLY THIS COLLABORATIVE INCLUDED 26 HOSPITALS, INCLUDING FIVE FROM ADVOCATE, SEVEN HEALTH DEPARTMENTS AND NEARLY 100 COMMUNITY ORGANIZATIONS FROM ACROSS CHICAGO AND COOK COUNTY. THE PURPOSE OF HICCC WAS TO CREATE A MORE EFFECTIVE WAY TO ASSESS HEALTH NEEDS ACROSS CHICAGO AND COOK COUNTY AND THEN IMPLEMENT A SHARED ACTION PLAN TO MAXIMIZE HEALTH EQUITY AND WELLNESS. DURING 2016, THE COLLABORATIVE COMPLETED THREE COMPREHENSIVE ASSESSMENTS - ONE EACH FOR THE NORTH, CENTRAL AND SOUTH REGIONS OF COOK COUNTY, INCLUDING CHICAGO.

STAKEHOLDER HEALTH ASPIRES TO IDENTIFY AND ACTIVATE A MENU OF PROVEN COMMUNITY HEALTH PRACTICES AND PARTNERSHIPS THAT WORK FROM THE TOP OF THE MISSION STATEMENT TO THE BOTTOM LINE. ADVOCATE AURORA HEALTH CONTINUES TO BE AN ACTIVE MEMBER AND LEADER OF STAKEHOLDER HEALTH.SUSTAINABLE BUILDING. SUSTAINABILITY, SAFETY AND EFFICIENCY ARE CORE ELEMENTS OF ALL ADVOCATE CONSTRUCTION PROJECTS. IN 2018, 74% OR 1,370 TONS OF ADVOCATE CONSTRUCTION WASTE WAS RECYCLED. ADVOCATE IS PURSUING LEADERSHIP IN ENERGY AND ENVIRONMENTAL DESIGN (LEED) CERTIFICATION ON ALL NEW MAJOR BUILDINGS AND HAS DEVELOPED A NEW TOOL, THE HEALTHY SPACES ROADMAP, TO ENSURE SUSTAINABILITY IN ALL RENOVATIONS AND PROJECTS THROUGHOUT ADVOCATE. AS REPORTED FOR 2017, ADVOCATE CHRIST'S EAST TOWER WAS LEED GOLD HEALTHCARE CERTIFIED. IN 2018, HOWEVER, TWO MORE HOSPITALS-ADVOCATE GOOD SAMARITAN FOR ITS WEST TOWER AND ADVOCATE GOOD SHEPHERD FOR ITS MODERNIZATION PROJECT-ACHIEVED LEED FOR HEALTHCARE-SILVER CERTIFICATION IN 2018. SUSTAINABLE WORK SPACES. BEING GREEN AT WORK IS EASIER WHEN THE WORK ENVIRONMENT IS CONDUCIVE TO SUSTAINABLE PRACTICES. AT ADVOCATE, INDOOR AIR QUALITY IS INCREASED AND EXPOSURE TO TOXIC CHEMICALS DECREASED THROUGH ENVIRONMENTALLY-PREFERABLE PURCHASING, INCLUDING FURNITURE, CLEANING PRODUCTS AND MEDICAL SUPPLIES. ADVOCATE'S TEAM MEMBERS ARE EMPOWERED TO CREATE SUSTAINABLE WORK SPACES THROUGH THE GREEN ADVOCATE AND SUSTAINABLE WORK SPACE CERTIFICATION PROGRAMS. ALL TEAM MEMBERS AND VOLUNTEERS ARE ENCOURAGED TO REDUCE WASTE, RECYCLE AND UTILIZE ELECTRICITY EFFECTIVELY. BEING GREEN IS A TEAM EFFORT AND MANY METRICS ARE TRACKED AND REPORTED AT ADVOCATE SITES.BETHANY COMMUNITY HEALTH FUND (""BETHANY FUND""). AS INTRODUCED EARLIER, THE BETHANY FUND ADDRESSES THE UNIQUE HEALTH NEEDS OF FOUR TARGETED UNDERSERVED COMMUNITIES ON CHICAGO'S WEST SIDE [AUSTIN, GARFIELD PARK, HUMBOLDT PARK AND NORTH LAWNDALE] BY AWARDING GRANTS TO PROGRAMS THAT PROMOTE HEALTH AND WELLNESS AND REDUCE HEALTH DISPARITIES AND THEIR DETERMINANTS. PRIORITY AREAS INCLUDE DIABETES, SCHOOL DROPOUT PREVENTION, WORKFORCE DEVELOPMENT, AND VIOLENCE PREVENTION. SINCE THE BOARD WAS ESTABLISHED IN 2007, THE BETHANY FUND HAS AWARDED OVER $9 MILLION THROUGH 381 GRANTS TO SUPPORT ORGANIZATIONS IN ITS FUND COMMUNITIES. IN 2018, THE FUND AWARDED $815,000 TO GRANTEES. THE ADVOCATE BETHANY FUND HAS SUPPORTED A WIDE VARIETY OF PROGRAMS THAT ADDRESS THE SOCIAL DETERMINANTS OF HEALTH, INCLUDING THE FOLLOWING EXAMPLES OF PROGRAMS FUNDED DURING 2018: NEW MOMS (AUSTIN), FOR THEIR WORKFORCE DEVELOPMENT PROGRAM THAT WORKS WITH YOUNG MOMS EXPERIENCING POVERTY AND UTILIZES CANDLE MAKING TO TEACH JOB-READINESS SKILLS; FREE SPIRIT MEDIA (NORTH LAWNDALE) FOR THEIR INDUSTRY AND CAREER PATHWAYS PROGRAM WHICH SERVES YOUTH AND YOUNG ADULTS SEEKING TO BREAK INTO CHICAGO'S ROBUST FILM AND MEDIA INDUSTRIES; MARILLAC ST. VINCENT FAMILY SERVICES (GARFIELD PARK) TO SUPPORT PROJECT HOPE, A PROGRAM FOR PREGNANT AND PARENTING TEENS AND YOUNG ADULTS; AND GREATER WEST TOWN COMMUNITY DEVELOPMENT PROJECT (HUMBOLDT PARK), TO ENRICH THEIR EXISTING VOCATIONAL TRAINING PROGRAM. IN ADDITION TO ITS GRANT MAKING ROLE, THE ADVOCATE BETHANY FUND INVESTS SUBSTANTIAL STAFF TIME AND FINANCIAL RESOURCES IN ORGANIZATIONAL CAPACITY BUILDING. THE ORGANIZATIONS FUNDED ARE PHYSICALLY LOCATED IN ONE OR MORE OF THE PRIORITY WEST-SIDE COMMUNITIES. EACH YEAR, THE FUND SUPPORTS CAPACITY-BUILDING IDEAS DETERMINED FROM RECOMMENDATIONS FROM ITS GRANTEE ORGANIZATIONS AND ITS BOARD MEMBERS (SOME OF WHOM ARE LEADERS AT GRANTEE ORGANIZATIONS). THE FUND HAS OFFERED OVER 80 FORMAL CAPACITY BUILDING/PROFESSIONAL DEVELOPMENT SESSIONS THAT HAVE ENGAGED MORE THAN 1,150 STAFF FROM GRANTEE AND COMMUNITY-BASED ORGANIZATIONS. GOAL E: LEVERAGE RESOURCES AND MAXIMIZE COMMUNITY ENGAGEMENT BY BUILDING AND STRENGTHENING COMMUNITY PARTNERSHIPS WITH HEALTH DEPARTMENTS AND OTHER DIVERSE COMMUNITY ORGANIZATIONS.A KEY OBJECTIVE UNDER THIS GOAL IS ALIGNING INITIATIVES WITH LOCAL HEALTH DEPARTMENTS AND THEIR COMMUNITY HEALTH PRIORITIES. ALL ADVOCATE HOSPITALS COLLABORATED WITH THEIR RESPECTIVE HEALTH DEPARTMENTS DURING THE 2014-2016 COMMUNITY HEALTH NEEDS ASSESSMENT (CHNA) CYCLE. ONE OF THE PRIMARY VALUES OF ADVOCATE'S COMMUNITY HEALTH DEPARTMENT IS COLLABORATION WITH PARTNERS, PREFERABLY THROUGH A COLLECTIVE IMPACT MODEL. ONE OF THE PRINCIPAL PARTNERS IN PROVIDING FOR COMMUNITY NEEDS IS THE LOCAL HEALTH DEPARTMENT. WHILE AT THE DIRECTION OF THE SYSTEM, ALL HOSPITALS ACTIVELY PARTICIPATED IN COLLABORATIVE ASSESSMENTS AND HEALTH IMPROVEMENT PLANNING WITH THEIR LOCAL HEALTH DEPARTMENTS FOR THE 2014-2016 CHNA PROCESS AND ARE DOING SO AGAIN FOR THE 2017-2019 PROCESS. THERE IS ONE NOTABLE COLLABORATION IN PARTICULAR IN WHICH ADVOCATE SYSTEM LEVEL LEADERSHIP PLAYED A VITAL ROLE. ALLIANCE FOR HEALTH EQUITY (FORMERLY THE HEALTH IMPACT COLLABORATIVE OF COOK COUNTY [HICCC]. AS INTRODUCED EARLIER, ADVOCATE HEALTH CARE, PRESENCE HEALTH AND THE ILLINOIS PUBLIC HEALTH INSTITUTE (IPHI) WERE THE THREE FOUNDING ORGANIZATIONS OF THE HEALTH IMPACT COLLABORATIVE OF COOK COUNTY. THESE ORGANIZATIONS INVITED HEALTH DEPARTMENTS AND ALL COOK COUNTY NONPROFIT HOSPITALS TO JOIN THEM IN CREATING ONE OF THE LARGEST CHNA AND COMMUNITY HEALTH IMPROVEMENT COLLABORATIVES IN THE COUNTRY. IPHI SERVES AS THE BACKBONE ORGANIZATION FOR THE COLLABORATIVE AND THE HOSPITALS PROVIDE FUNDING FOR THE SHARED ASSESSMENT AND COMMUNITY HEALTH IMPROVEMENT PLANNING FACILITATION WORK. IN ADDITION TO 27"

AFFILIATED HEALTH CARE SYSTEM- CONTINUEDNONPROFIT AND PUBLIC HOSPITALS, SEVEN LOCAL HEALTH DEPARTMENTS AND MORE THAN 100 COMMUNITY ORGANIZATIONS PARTICIPATED IN THE ASSESSMENT AND ACTION TEAMS.DURING 2015 AND 2016, IPHI, THE PARTICIPATING HOSPITALS AND HEALTH DEPARTMENTS WORKED TOGETHER TO DESIGN A SHARED LEADERSHIP MODEL AND COLLABORATIVE INFRASTRUCTURE TO SUPPORT COMMUNITY-ENGAGED PLANNING PARTNERSHIPS AND STRATEGIC ALIGNMENT OF IMPLEMENTATION PLANS, WHICH WILL FACILITATE MORE EFFECTIVE AND SUSTAINABLE COMMUNITY HEALTH IMPROVEMENT IN THE FUTURE. SURVEYS WERE DISTRIBUTED THROUGHOUT COOK COUNTY WITH A FOCUS ON UNDERSERVED COMMUNITIES. OVER 5,000 SURVEYS WERE COMPLETED PROVIDING A GOOD PICTURE OF THE HEALTH NEEDS OF THE COUNTY. PRIMARY DATA ALSO INCLUDED MULTIPLE FOCUS GROUPS AND HOSPITAL UTILIZATION DATA. A DATA TEAM ANALYZED MULTIPLE SECONDARY DATA SOURCES AS WELL. THIS COLLABORATIVE WORK RESULTED IN THREE REGIONAL CHNA REPORTS.AS A RESULT OF THE ASSESSMENT WORK, ALL PARTNERS DETERMINED FOUR FOCUS AREAS FOR IMPLEMENTATION. ACTION TEAMS HAVE BEEN FORMED AND COMMUNITY HEALTH IMPROVEMENT PLANS ARE BEING DEVELOPED WITH A FOCUS ON ALIGNED ACTIONS AND DATA COLLECTION. IN LATE 2017 AND FOLLOWING HICCC'S MERGER WITH THE HEALTH CHICAGO HOSPITALS COLLABORATE TO CREATE THE ALLIANCE FOR HEALTH EQUITY (AFHE), ADVOCATE HAS CONTINUED TO BE AN ACTIVE MEMBER INVOLVED IN LEADERSHIP AND SERVING ON THE AFHE STEERING COMMITTEE. ANOTHER OBJECTIVE TO STRENGTHEN COMMUNITY PARTNERSHIPS IS FOR ADVOCATE TO EXPLORE NON-TRADITIONAL RELATIONSHIPS, SUCH AS WITH SCHOOL DISTRICTS, EMPLOYMENT AGENCIES, HOUSING GROUPS, FOOD PANTRIES, SHELTERS, ETC. WHILE THERE ARE MANY EXISTING ADVOCATE COMMUNITY PARTNERSHIPS MENTIONED THROUGHOUT THIS DOCUMENT AND EVEN SOME THAT RESULTED FROM OR BEGAN PRIOR TO ADVOCATE'S 2011-2013 CHNA PROCESS, THIS OBJECTIVE IS FOCUSED PRIMARILY ON THE INNOVATIVE NON-TRADITIONAL PARTNERSHIPS THAT HAVE BEGUN AS A RESULT OF THE 2014-2016 CHNA.ADDRESSING FOOD INSECURITY. ONE SUCH EXAMPLE OF A NON-TRADITIONAL COMMUNITY PARTNERSHIP IS ADVOCATE GOOD SAMARITAN'S PARTNERSHIP WITH LOCAL FOOD PANTRIES AND THE UNIVERSITY OF ILLINOIS EXTENSION TO DEVELOP A PROGRAM THAT OFFERS HEALTHY FRESH FOOD, NUTRITION AND COOKING CLASSES TO CLIENTS OF THE FOOD PANTRIES. ANOTHER EXAMPLE IS ADVOCATE GOOD SHEPHERD'S WORK WITH VARIOUS COMMUNITY-BASED ORGANIZATIONS AND LOCAL MUNICIPAL ENTITIES THAT SERVE SENIORS TO IMPLEMENT FOOD SECURITY SCREENING FOR SENIORS. A SCREENING TOOL AND COMPREHENSIVE RESOURCE GUIDE HAVE BEEN DEVELOPED FOR SENIORS THAT SCREEN AS FOOD INSECURE. ADVOCATE GOOD SHEPHERD AND SEVERAL OTHER ADVOCATE HOSPITALS ARE GROWING VEGETABLES ON THEIR CAMPUSES OR IN THE COMMUNITY. ADVOCATE GOOD SHEPHERD HAS PARTNERED WITH A LOCAL NON-PROFIT ORGANIZATION, SMARTFARM, WHOSE MISSION IS TO BE AN EDUCATIONAL RESOURCE ON SUSTAINABLE GARDENING AND HEALTHY EATING. SMART FARM MANAGES THE ON-SITE GARDEN ON OVER 10 ACRES OF LAND OWNED BY ADVOCATE AND THE HARVESTED FRESH VEGETABLES ARE DONATED TO LOCAL FOOD PANTRIES. SIMILAR PARTNERSHIPS EXIST AT ADVOCATE SHERMAN AND ADVOCATE BROMENN. IN 2018, ADVOCATE ILLINOIS MASONIC ESTABLISHED A HOSPITAL-BASED FOOD PANTRY TO ADDRESS THE NEEDS OF FOOD INSECURE ONCOLOGY PATIENTS. IN PARTNERSHIP WITH THE LAKEVIEW FOOD PANTRY, THE MEDICAL CENTER PROVIDES DRY GOOD FOOD BAGS, RE-USABLE WHEELIE GROCERY BAGS AND GIFT CARDS TO LOW-INCOME AND FOOD INSECURE PATIENTS. TWO HOSPITALS, ADVOCATE SOUTH SUBURBAN AND ADVOCATE TRINITY HAVE PARTNERED WITH ADVOCATE'S PRODUCE VENDOR, CRISTINA FOODS, TO HOST THREE PUBLIC FARMERS MARKETS WHERE FRESH PRODUCE WAS PROVIDED TO PATIENTS, SURROUNDING COMMUNITIES AND ADVOCATE TEAM MEMBERS, WITH LEFTOVER FOOD DONATED TO LOCAL FOOD PANTRIES IN 2018.ADVOCATE WORKFORCE INITIATIVE (AWI). IN 2015, JPMORGAN CHASE MADE A GENEROUS DONATION TO THE ADVOCATE CHARITABLE FOUNDATION, THE CHARITABLE ARM OF ADVOCATE, TO DEVELOP THE HEALTHCARE WORKFORCE COLLABORATIVE, A CREATIVE AND MODERN SOLUTION TO THE CITY'S TALENT SHORTAGE AND ECONOMIC DISPARITIES. LED BY ADVOCATE, THIS HEALTH CARE SECTOR SKILLS-BASED TRAINING INITIATIVE CONNECTS CHICAGOLAND'S UNDEREMPLOYED AND UNEMPLOYED RESIDENTS WITH HIGH-QUALITY, IN-DEMAND JOBS IN THE RAPIDLY GROWING HEALTH CARE INDUSTRY. UNEMPLOYMENT RATES ARE AS HIGH AS 31.9% IN SOME NEIGHBORHOODS IN THE METROPOLITAN AREA AS COMPARED TO CHICAGO'S OVERALL UNEMPLOYMENT RATE OF 8.2%. ILLINOIS HAS THE NATION'S HIGHEST UNEMPLOYMENT RATE AMONG AFRICAN-AMERICANS. THE UNEMPLOYMENT RATE OF AFRICAN-AMERICANS AND HISPANICS IN CHICAGO IS THREE TIMES THAT OF THEIR WHITE COUNTERPARTS. THE HEALTH CARE SECTOR IS EXPECTED TO GENERATE 14,000 NEW WELL-PAYING MIDDLE-SKILL JOBS ANNUALLY IN THE CHICAGO REGION THROUGH 2019, BUT LACKS THE SKILLED TALENT NEEDED TO FILL THESE ROLES. ADVOCATE ALSO HELPED LAUNCH THE CHICAGOLAND HEALTHCARE WORKFORCE COLLABORATIVE (CHWC). THE CHWC IS A CONSORTIUM OF LEADING HEALTHCARE EMPLOYERS AND INDUSTRY PARTNERS THAT BELIEVE IN THE NECESSITY OF A STRONG AND DIVERSE LOCAL HEALTHCARE WORKFORCE. BY LEVERAGING RESOURCES AND BEST PRACTICES, THE COLLABORATIVE AIMS TO SUPPORT AN INCLUSIVE HEALTHCARE WORKFORCE, PROVIDE ACCESSIBILITY FOR THE UNEMPLOYED AND UNDEREMPLOYED POPULATIONS, AND DEVELOP INNOVATIVE RESPONSES TO THE EVOLVING NEEDS OF THE HEALTHCARE INDUSTRY. THIS IS ACHIEVED BY IDENTIFYING AND IMPLEMENTING IMPACTFUL, DATA-DRIVEN AND ACTION-ORIENTED SOLUTIONS, WITH A SPECIFIC FOCUS ON POPULATIONS THAT ARE UNDERREPRESENTED IN THE HEALTH CARE WORKFORCE.THIS WORKFORCE DEVELOPMENT PROGRAM:"" ALIGNS TRAINING CURRICULUM TO CURRENT AND EMERGING JOB NEEDS;"" CONNECTS JOB SEEKERS TO EMPLOYMENT OPPORTUNITIES WITHIN ADVOCATE;"" INCREASES DIVERSITY WITHIN THE HEALTHCARE SECTOR;"" PROVIDES CAREER PATHWAYS TO ADVANCED TRAINING OR CAREER OPPORTUNITIES IN HEALTHCARE;"" SUPPORTS ECONOMIC DEVELOPMENT IN VULNERABLE COMMUNITIES;"" ESTABLISHES BEST PRACTICES, CREATING A REGIONAL/NATIONAL MODEL; AND"" PROVIDES SUPPORTIVE SERVICES TO REMOVE BARRIERS TO EMPLOYMENT.TO ENSURE THE INITIATIVE IS BROAD-REACHING AND COMPREHENSIVE, ADVOCATE HAS ESTABLISHED STRATEGIC ALLIANCES WITH THE CITY COLLEGES OF CHICAGO, PRAIRIE STATE COLLEGE, CHICAGO STATE UNIVERSITY, UNIVERSITY OF CHICAGO (URBAN LABS) AND OTHER COMMUNITY-BASED ORGANIZATIONS, SUCH AS PHALANX FAMILY SERVICES, JEWISH VOCATION SERVICES, INSTITUTO DEL PROGRESO LATINO, POLISH AMERICAN ASSOCIATION, NATIONAL LATINO EDUCATION INSTITUTE, KINZIE INDUSTRIAL DEVELOPMENT CORPORATION AND CHICAGO CENTER FOR ARTS AND TECHNOLOGY, TO RECRUIT, TRAIN AND SUPPORT POTENTIAL CANDIDATES. AFTER SUCCESSFUL COMPLETION OF THE TRAINING AND LICENSING EXAM, ALL PARTICIPANTS ARE GUARANTEED AN INTERVIEW WITH ADVOCATE AND RECEIVE JOB PLACEMENT ASSISTANCE. SINCE INCEPTION, THE INITIATIVE HAS TRAINED MORE THAN 800 PARTICIPANTS AND HAS OVER AN 80% GRADUATION RATE. NEARLY 300 GRADUATES FROM THE INITIATIVE ARE NOW EMPLOYED IN THE HEALTH CARE INDUSTRY WITH ABOUT 162 STILL ENROLLED PENDING NEW EMPLOYMENT OPPORTUNITIES. OF THOSE EMPLOYED, 98% HAVE MAINTAINED EMPLOYMENT FOR AT LEAST 90 DAYS. ADVOCATE HAS ALSO LAUNCHED AN INCUMBENT WORKER STRATEGY FOR FRONTLINE TEAM MEMBERS, THE NAVIGATE PROGRAM. NAVIGATE AIMS TO CREATE A MORE INCLUSIVE WORKFORCE, ONE THAT PROVIDES TEAM MEMBERS WITH OPPORTUNITIES TO DEVELOP NEW SKILLS, DETERMINE A CAREER PATHWAY AND CONNECT WITH TOOLS AND RESOURCES. ADVOCATE IS INVESTED IN TEAM MEMBERS' SUCCESS THROUGH LEVERAGING THESE TYPES OF PROGRAMS TO ENSURE ADVOCATE IS A GREAT PLACE FOR TEAM MEMBERS WORK, PATIENTS TO HEAL AND PHYSICIANS TO PRACTICE. THE PROGRAM WAS INITIATED AT ADVOCATE TRINITY IN 2016 AND AS OF YEAR-END 2018, HAS EXPANDED TO ADVOCATE ILLINOIS MASONIC, ADVOCATE CHRIST AND ADVOCATE MEDICAL GROUP, WITH PLANS TO ACTIVATE AT ADVOCATE SOUTH SUBURBAN IN 2019. THE PROGRAM HAS ENROLLED AND SUPPORTED 182 INCUMBENT WORKERS, GUIDED MORE THAN 100 TO IDENTIFY A CAREER PATHWAY AND HAS NEARLY AN 80% GRADUATION RATE. OF THOSE THAT HAVE MOVED INTO AN ADVANCED CAREER PATHWAY, THE AVERAGE WAGE INCREASE IS 24%. VOLUNTEERS FROM THE COMMUNITY. ANOTHER ASPECT OF COMMUNITY ENGAGEMENT IS PROVIDING COMMUNITY MEMBERS WITH AN OPPORTUNITY TO DONATE THEIR TIME SERVING THROUGH A MYRIAD OF VOLUNTEER SERVICE OPPORTUNITIES. EACH YEAR, VOLUNTEERS FROM THE COMMUNITY SHARE THEIR TIME AND TALENTS THROUGH SERVICE AT ADVOCATE'S HOSPITALS, ADVOCATE MEDICAL GROUP AND ADVOCATE AT HOME, AND IN THEIR OWN WAY, FURTHER ADVOCATE'S COMMITMENT TO PROVIDING EXCELLENT HEALTH CARE. IN 2018, ADVOCATE STAFF MANAGED 5,018 ACTIVE COMMUNITY VOLUNTEERS THAT ENGAGED PATIENTS, FAMILIES AND STAFF IN A VARIETY OF ACTIVITIES, SOME OF WHICH WERE: PROVIDING INFORMATION DESK SERVICES TO VISITORS; CLERICAL SUPPORT TO STAFF; SERVING CUSTOMERS IN HOSPITAL GIFT AND RESALE SHOPS; OFFERING COMPASSIONATE CONCERN TO PATIENTS AND THEIR LOVED ONES IN MULTIPLE HOSPITAL AREAS SUCH AS THE EMERGENCY DEPARTMENT, INTENSIVE CARE UNIT, SURGERY WAITING ROOM,"

ADVOCATE TEAM MEMBERS VOLUNTEERING IN THE COMMUNITY. ADVOCATE'S SYSTEM LEADERSHIP ALSO ENCOURAGES AND PROVIDES OPPORTUNITIES FOR TEAM MEMBERS AND PHYSICIANS TO DONATE TO, VOLUNTEER AT AND HELP RAISE FUNDS FOR COMMUNITY INITIATIVES. IN 2018, ADVOCATE PROMOTED AND SUPPORTED ASSOCIATE, PHYSICIAN AND HOSPITAL PARTICIPATION IN WALKS, RUNS AND RACES, INCLUDING DEVELOPING OFFICIAL ADVOCATE TEAMS FOR THE AMERICAN HEART ASSOCIATION (HEAR WALK), AMERICAN CANCER SOCIETY (MAKING STRIDES AGAINST BREAST CANCER EVENTS AND HEAD FOR THE CURE 5K), ALZHEIMER'S ASSOCIATION (WALK TO END ALZHEIMER'S) AND MARCH OF DIMES (MARCH FOR BABIES). IN 2018, 5,583 ADVOCATE TEAM MEMBERS WALKED IN THESE FUNDRAISERS AND $633,792 IN CHARITABLE CONTRIBUTIONS WAS RAISED TO SUPPORT THESE NONPROFIT PARTNER ORGANIZATIONS THROUGH SUCH EFFORTS. ADVOCATE ALSO HAD THE HONOR OF BEING DESIGNATED THE #1 HEART WALK FUNDRAISING HEALTH CARE COMPANY IN THE NATION BY THE AMERICAN HEART ASSOCIATION IN 2018. IN ADDITION, ADVOCATE'S TEAM MEMBERS AND PHYSICIANS GENEROUSLY SUPPORT MULTIPLE LOCAL COMMUNITY ORGANIZATIONS, PROGRAMS AND INITIATIVES, INCLUDING SOME OF ADVOCATE'S OWN SYSTEM-WIDE AND HOSPITAL-BASED COMMUNITY HEALTH PROGRAMS. IN 2018, ADVOCATE TEAM MEMBERS CONTRIBUTED MORE THAN $2.1 MILLION THROUGH THE ADVOCATE AURORA GIVING CAMPAIGN. IN ADDITION, SYSTEM LEVEL LEADERS ARE SUPPORTIVE OF TEAM MEMBERS VOLUNTEERING DURING WORKTIME ON NONPROFIT COMMUNITY BOARDS, COMMITTEES, COUNCILS, TASK FORCES AND COALITIONS, USING THEIR TALENTS TO SUPPORT A VARIETY OF COMMUNITY-BASED ORGANIZATIONS. GOAL F: PROMOTE ACCOUNTABILITY FOR SYSTEM AND SITE ALIGNMENT BY INCREASING PROGRAM COORDINATION AND DEVELOPING STRONG GOVERNANCE RELATIONSHIPS.KEY TO DEVELOPING STRONG GOVERNANCE RELATIONSHIPS WAS ESTABLISHING SYSTEM BOARD ENGAGEMENT IN SUPPORT OF ADVOCATE'S COMMUNITY HEALTH VISION. AS THE FUNCTION ACCOUNTABLE FOR ADVOCATE'S SYSTEM-WIDE CHNA PROCESS AND BOTH CHNA AND STATE COMMUNITY BENEFITS REGULATORY REPORTING IN ILLINOIS, THE COMMUNITY HEALTH DEPARTMENT PROVIDES PROGRESS UPDATES AT LEAST ANNUALLY TO HOSPITAL AND SYSTEM LEADERSHIP. WHEREAS PRIOR TO THE APRIL 2018MERGER, THE MISSION AND SPIRITUAL CARE COMMITTEE OF THE BOARD OF DIRECTORS WAS RESPONSIBLE FOR THE ADOPTION OF COMMUNITY HEALTH STRATEGY, POST-MERGER THE ADVOCATE HEALTH CARE NETWORK BOARD IS NOW CHARGED WITH THIS RESPONSIBILITY. AS INDICATED EARLIER, ADVOCATE HEALTH CARE ESTABLISHED A COMMUNITY HEALTH DEPARTMENT IN LATE 2015 AND THE DEPARTMENT WAS FULLY STAFFED AND OPERATING BY JANUARY 2016. THE DEPARTMENT'S FIRST ORDER OF BUSINESS WAS TO DEVELOP A MISSION, VALUES AND VISION (MVV) TO GUIDE ITS ACTIONS. THE DEPARTMENT'S MISSION IS ""TO TRANSFORM THE HEALTH AND WELL-BEING OF THE COMMUNITIES WE SERVE BY PROMOTING PREVENTION AND ENSURING HEALTH EQUITY, THROUGH COLLABORATIVE PARTNERSHIPS AND EVIDENCE-BASED PRACTICES."" THE DEPARTMENT'S VALUES ENCOMPASS BEING ""ACCOUNTABLE, COLLABORATIVE, EQUITABLE, INCLUSIVE, RESILIENT, SUSTAINABLE, TRANSFORMATIVE AND TRANSPARENT."" THROUGH THESE ATTRIBUTES, THE VISION - ""TO WORK COLLABORATIVELY TO TRANSFORM OUR ENVIRONMENT INTO COMMUNITIES WHERE HEALTH SERVICES ARE ACCESSIBLE AND INTEGRATED; PEOPLE ARE SUPPORTED; HEALTH EQUITY IS ACHIEVED AND RESULTS ARE MEASURABLE"" - WILL BE ACHIEVED. DURING 2016 AND TO SUPPORT ADVOCATE HOSPITALS' PLANS TO IMPLEMENT PROGRAM STRATEGIES AS OUTLINED IN THEIR CHNA REPORTS DURING 2017, SITE-SPECIFIC COMMUNITY HEALTH DEPARTMENT BUDGETS WERE PUT IN PLACE AT ALL ADVOCATE HOSPITALS BY THE SYSTEM VICE PRESIDENT OF COMMUNITY HEALTH AND FAITH OUTREACH. HOSPITAL COMMUNITY HEALTH BUDGETS, INCLUDING ONGOING PROGRAM IMPLEMENTATION COSTS, STAFF SALARIES, ANNUAL CONTRACTED DATA ACCESS COSTS TO THE CONDUENT-HEALTHY COMMUNITIES INSTITUTE'S CHNA TOOL, FEE TO PARTICIPATE IN THE ALLIANCE FOR HEALTH EQUITY (AHFE) AND FOR ANNUAL SUPPORT FOR AND USE OF THE LYON SOFTWARE CBISA (COMMUNITY BENEFITS INVENTORY OF SOCIAL RESPONSIBILITY) REPORTING TOOL WERE INCLUDED IN THE 2017 AND 2018 BUDGET CYCLE IN PREPARATION FOR YEAR 2019. SYSTEM LEVEL MONITORING OF BUDGETS SUPPORTS APPROPRIATE FUNDING TO SUSTAIN EXISTING AND IMPLEMENT NEW PROGRAMS THAT TARGET SELECTED COMMUNITY HEALTH PRIORITIES. HOSPITAL GOVERNING COUNCILS. ALSO KEY TO PROMOTING ACCOUNTABILITY FOR COMMUNITY HEALTH THROUGHOUT ADVOCATE WAS A SYSTEM LEVEL IMPLEMENTED PROCESS FOR ESTABLISHING HOSPITAL-BASED GOVERNANCE OVERSIGHT FOR EACH HOSPITAL'S CHNA PROCESS, INCLUDING REVIEW AND APPROVAL OF THE HOSPITAL CHNA REPORT AND HIGH LEVEL STRATEGIES TO ADDRESS KEY SELECTED NEEDS THAT RESULTED FROM THE PRIORITY-SETTING PROCESS. TO THAT END, THE SYSTEM EXPANDED THE ROLE OF THE HOSPITAL GOVERNING COUNCILS TO INCLUDE OVERSIGHT OF THE CHNA PROCESS AND APPROVAL OF THE HOSPITAL CHNA REPORTS AND IMPLEMENTATION STRATEGIES. THIS HAS RESULTED IN COMMUNITY HEALTH BEING STRONGLY INTEGRATED INTO ADVOCATE GOVERNANCE STRUCTURES. COMMUNITY HEALTH COUNCILS COMPRISED OF COMMUNITY EXPERTS AND HOSPITAL LEADERS HAVE BEEN DEVELOPED AT EACH HOSPITAL. THESE COUNCILS ARE CO-LED BY THE HOSPITAL COMMUNITY HEALTH LEADER AND A HOSPITAL GOVERNING COUNCIL MEMBER. A MINIMUM OF 50% OF THE COUNCIL MEMBERS FOR THE 2016 CHNA REPORT CYCLE WERE COMMUNITY REPRESENTATIVES WITH A FOCUS ON PEOPLE WHO REPRESENTED UNDERSERVED AND VULNERABLE POPULATIONS. THE COUNCILS MET AT LEAST FOUR TIMES DURING THE YEAR. HOSPITAL COMMUNITY HEALTH STAFF ANALYZED AND PRESENTED PRIMARY AND SECONDARY COMMUNITY HEALTH DATA TO THE HOSPITALS' COMMUNITY HEALTH COUNCILS. THE COUNCIL MEMBERS IDENTIFIED THE HOSPITAL SERVICE AREAS' SIGNIFICANT HEALTH NEEDS, SUBSEQUENTLY EMPLOYING A CONSENSUS BASED PRIORITY-SETTING PROCESS TO DETERMINE THE NEEDS UPON WHICH TO FOCUS. AS PART OF THE PRIORITIZATION PROCESS, THE COUNCILS SCANNED HOSPITAL AND COMMUNITY CHALLENGES AND ASSETS, AS WELL AS POTENTIAL PARTNERSHIPS WITH OTHER ORGANIZATIONS THAT MIGHT RESULT IN A LARGER HEALTH IMPROVEMENT IMPACT.CHNA DATA ASSESSMENT RESULTS AND RECOMMENDATIONS FOR HEALTH IMPROVEMENT PRIORITIES WERE PRESENTED TO THE FULL HOSPITAL GOVERNING COUNCILS FOR ENDORSEMENT. ONCE THE HEALTH IMPROVEMENT PRIORITIES AND STRATEGIES WERE APPROVED BY THE HOSPITAL GOVERNING COUNCILS, THE RESULTS WERE PRESENTED TO THE MISSION AND SPIRITUAL CARE COMMITTEE OF THE ADVOCATE HEALTH CARE BOARD OF DIRECTORS, CHARGED WITH SYSTEM OVERSIGHT OF COMMUNITY HEALTH PLANNING AT THAT TIME, FOR FINAL APPROVAL. AS INDICATED EARLIER, AS A RESULT OF THE MERGER, THIS RESPONSIBILITY MOVED TO THE ADVOCATE HEALTH CARE NETWORK BOARD IN 2018. SERVICE LINE AND POPULATION HEALTH ENGAGEMENT. TO SUPPORT FURTHER ALIGNMENT WITHIN ADVOCATE, THE SYSTEM COMMUNITY HEALTH DEPARTMENT HAS ALSO WORKED TO ENGAGE SYSTEM DEFINED CLINICAL SERVICE LINES IN EXPANDING THEIR FOCUS ON COMMUNITY HEALTH. ADVOCATE IS VIEWED AS A LEADER IN THE POPULATION HEALTH MANAGEMENT ARENA. AN EARLY ADOPTER OF MANAGING CARE ACROSS POPULATIONS, ADVOCATE HAS SIGNIFICANT SUCCESS IMPROVING HEALTH OUTCOMES WHILE DECREASING OR MAINTAINING COST OF CARE DELIVERY. ADVOCATE'S COMMUNITY HEALTH DEPARTMENT HAS INTENTIONALLY ALIGNED WITH ADVOCATE POPULATION HEALTH LEADERS AND ADVOCATE SERVICE LINES. THIS ALIGNMENT ASSURES THAT MEMBERS OF THE COMMUNITIES ADVOCATE SERVES AND OUR PATIENTS RECEIVE COMMUNITY-BASED INTERVENTIONS, AS WELL AS EDUCATION AND PROGRAMMING THAT ALIGNS WITH THEIR HEALTH NEEDS. THE FOLLOWING ARE EXAMPLES OF EDUCATION AND PROGRAMMING ALIGNED WITH POPULATION HEALTH AND SERVICE LINE DEVELOPMENT THAT REFLECT THIS INTEGRATED APPROACH. BEHAVIORAL HEALTH. BEHAVIORAL HEALTH COUNCIL INTEGRATION STRATEGIES HAVE INCLUDED COMMUNITY HEALTH STAFF OFFERING MENTAL HEALTH FIRST AID TO TARGETED COMMUNITY MEMBERS FOR THE PURPOSE OF REDUCING STIGMA, AND TRAINING COMMUNITY MEMBERS TO RECOGNIZE MENTAL HEALTH ISSUES AND UNDERSTAND APPROPRIATE INTERVENTIONS. IN 2018, OVER 1,047 COMMUNITY MEMBERS WERE TRAINED IN THE EIGHT-HOUR EVIDENCE-BASED PROGRAM. ADDITIONALLY, ALL HOSPITALS PARTICIPATE IN LOCAL BEHAVIORAL HEALTH AND SUBSTANCE ABUSE COLLABORATIVES.ADVOCATE PHYSICIAN PARTNERS (APP).

UNDERGRADUATE AND GRADUATE (APN/NP/MANAGEMENT) NURSING EDUCATION OCCURS AT TEN ADVOCATE HOSPITALS AND AT MANY ADVOCATE MEDICAL GROUP SITES. NOTABLY, EIGHT ADVOCATE HOSPITALS HAVE EARNED MAGNET RECOGNITION FROM THE AMERICAN NURSE CREDENTIALING CENTER (ANCC), INCLUDING ADVOCATE BROMENN, ADVOCATE CHRIST, ADVOCATE CONDELL, ADVOCATE GOOD SAMARITAN, ADVOCATE GOOD SHEPHERD, ADVOCATE ILLINOIS MASONIC, ADVOCATE LUTHERAN GENERAL AND ADVOCATE SHERMAN. MAGNET STATUS REPRESENTS HOSPITAL-WIDE TEAMWORK AND DEDICATION TO CREATING A POSITIVE ENVIRONMENT, WHICH HELPS ATTRACT THE BEST PHYSICIANS AND NURSES, RESULTING IN BETTER OVERALL PATIENT CARE. EMERGENCY MEDICAL TECHNICIAN (EMT) EDUCATION. ADVOCATE ALSO TAKES A LEADERSHIP ROLE IN THE TRAINING OF EMTS TO TAKE THEIR PLACE IN PROVIDING CARE IN THE COMMUNITY. A MAJORITY OF ADVOCATE'S HOSPITALS PROVIDE EMT EDUCATION FROM BASIC THROUGH PARAMEDIC LEVEL.

202022389349300047,410682405,"Part VI, Line 4:","Betty Ford Center's ""community"" is defined as the Coachella Valley, where the Betty Ford Center is located. The Coachella Valley is a unique community, geographically isolated by mountain ranges so that it almost functions as an island. Approximately 414,000 people live in this part of Eastern Riverside County in Inland Southern California.The Coachella Valley as the community was determined by the senior leadership of the Betty Ford Center. It includes all residents in a defined geographic area surrounding the hospital and does not exclude low-income or underserved populations. The decision was based on geography and patient origin; approximately 19% of patients in 2017 live in the Coachella Valley (more than 400 patients). Specifically, the three most common hometowns of patients include Rancho Mirage (122 patients), Palm Desert (78 patients), and Indio (60 patients), all of which are within the Coachella Valley.About a quarter of residents (24.4%) are minors and another third (31.4%) can be considered seniors (ages 55 and older). In fact, 5.3% of the Coachella Valley is age 80 and over (more than 21,500 people).The percent of adults that are seniors is significantly higher in the Coachella Valley than in California as a whole. Specifically, 32% of California adults are age 55 and older, while in the Coachella Valley, approximately 42% of adults are age 55 and older.Approximately 11.9% of Coachella Valley adults identify as lesbian, gay, bisexual, or other sexual orientation. This is significantly higher than the rate in the state of California as a whole, where only 6.7% identify as lesbian, gay, bisexual or other sexual orientation. Thus, Betty Ford Center must have strong competencies in LGBT-specific care and be able to provide culturally competent care to this population.The majority of the Coachella Valley speaks either English (54.4%) or Spanish (41.0%) at home, and thus, Betty Ford Center must provide culturally competent care in Spanish if they are to truly meet the needs of their population. Less than 5% of the population speaks a language other than English or Spanish, and thus, those languages are less necessary to meeting the needs of this community.Local children are more likely to be Hispanic than local adults. This illustrates the unique nature of the Coachella Valley, which includes many white retirees who relocated to the area as well as local Hispanic families with children.About 38.9% of local adults (ages 18+) have a high school degree or less. This indicates that more than 60,000 local adults lack a high school degree. Thus, Betty Ford Center must be sure to provide materials to individuals with low literacy levels in order to serve this segment of the population. About a quarter of locals live in a household with an annual income under $20,000.Poverty was calculated using the number of people living in the home and the household income level. More than a quarter of local adults live below the federal poverty level (FPL), as do more than a third of local children.Thus, Betty Ford Center must continue to offer significant financial aid if they are to meet the needs of this substantial low-income community.Financial aid is especially important for uninsured adults, who are unable to bill their insurance for services. Approximately 13.9% of working age adults in the Coachella Valley remain uninsured. Virtually all seniors have health insurance due to Medicare."

The Health System estimates the transaction price for patients with deductibles and coinsurance and from those who are uninsured based on historical experience and current market conditions.

INSURANCE COPAYS ARE ATTEMPTED TO BE COLLECTED IN THE EMERGENCY DEPARTMENT IN ACCORDANCE WITH EMTALA REGULATIONS. WHEN THERE IS A BALANCE DUE (SELF-PAY OR BALANCE AFTER INSURANCE) AND NO COLLECTION WAS MADE IN ADVANCE OF OR AT THE TIME OF SERVICE, A STATEMENT WILL BE SENT TO PATIENTS PROVIDING A PHONE NUMBER FOR THEM TO CALL AND DISCUSS PAYMENT OPTIONS. IF THE PATIENT DOES NOT CALL OR MAKE PAYMENT, A HOSPITAL REPRESENTATIVE WILL CALL HIM/HER TO DISCUSS THE AMOUNT DUE AND TO DETERMINE IF THEY ARE ELIGIBLE FOR ANY PROGRAMS OR INSURANCES OR TO MAKE PAYMENT ARRANGEMENTS THAT CAN HELP THE PATIENT. AT ANY POINT IN THE CONVERSATION, IF THE PATIENT SAYS HE/SHE CANNOT AFFORD TO PAY THE BILL, THE PATIENT IS OFFERED A CHARITY CARE APPLICATION.

Northwell conducts and participates in population, demographic, and health status evaluations of our respective hospitals service areas based on county regions and the communities we serve. There is a special effort to include individuals with health disparities and organizations who serve these communities in the CHNA process. The CHNA includes the analysis of primary and secondary data. Multi-year analyses, trends and projections are developed, which identify areas of need for the continuum of health care services. Primary data is obtained through a combination of qualitative analysis of community-based organization (CBO), informant interviews and surveys, individual community member surveys, and participation in collaborative partner meetings. These meetings include representatives from the Departments of Health, CBOs, academic institutions, government agencies, and hospitals. Ongoing input concerning our communities needs is also obtained through: our Board of Trustees/Directors who are all area residents and leaders in their respective communities; facility based advisory boards and councils, and; the feedback received by our facility administrators and clinicians that serve on local community agency boards. Secondary data analysis includes: internal hospital data, including Prevention Quality Indicators (PQI); Department of Health Community Health Assessments; local regional NYS Prevention Agenda data sources; and Statewide Planning and Research System (SPARCS) data. The Committee on Community Health, a committee of the Board of Trustees, provides recommendations that concern Northwells community health priorities and interventions based on the CHNA. Committee discussions focus on New York State (NYS) Prevention Agenda Priority Areas, including strategies and intervention outcomes related to chronic disease prevention, women and childrens health, healthy safe environments, health access, mental health and substance abuse, HIV/AIDS/STDs and community immunizations. Regional departments of health (I.E. Nassau County Department of Health, Suffolk County Department of Health Services, and NYC Department of Health and Mental Hygiene) perform additional community health assessments (CHA) with the input of hospital and community stakeholders. These regional partners use strategies such as community member surveys, CBO surveys, and public listening sessions to solicit information on community needs. Together with other healthcare organizations and CBOs, Northwell participates in meetings organized by these regional departments of health academic organizations to discuss the shared responsibility of public health planning within the NYS Prevention Agenda. These meetings provide an opportunity for general discussion regarding the public health goals of the NYS Prevention Agenda and the selection of shared priorities for collaborative regional planning. The partnership among local health departments, hospitals and CBOs, enables region wide leveraging of resources, consensus on health priorities and collaboration on health promotion strategies.

Midstate is committed and focused on efforts to promote health and wellness.The majority of Midstate Medical Center's regional governing board is comprised of persons who either reside or work in its primary service area, and they are neither employees nor contractors of the Hospital.Midstate Medical Center extends medical staff privileges to all qualified physicians in its community. The Hospital/Medical Center has partnered with the Community Health Center to provide health services to the underserved in the community. In addition, Midstate Medical Center participates in Community Vision to improve community health and well-being.Midstate Medical Center has contracted to use the services of an organization to assist its patients in determining eligibility and applying for state and federal means tested programs such as Medicare and Medicaid, as well as for the Midstate Medical Center Financial Assistance Program. Additionally, the Midstate Emergency Department and satellite MediQuick Urgent Care facilities provide medical care regardless of patients' ability to pay for services. In towns across Central Connecticut, Midstate Medical Center is committed and focused on efforts to promote health and wellness in the communities the Hospital serves. Each year, Midstate Medical Center makes a concerted effort to go above and beyond its call to the community. Our physicians, nurses, and staff reach out to thousands of individuals every year through health-related programs and special events. Additionally, Midstate Medical Center has partnered with various community organizations to improve the quality of life of its residents. These include key opinion leaders, faith communities, business leaders, government officals, and a variety of social service organizations. Senior Emergency Care ServicesIn May 2013, with an eye on the health needs of our aging population, Midstate Medical Center began offering a newer, innovative approach to caring for seniors in its Emergency Department. When a patient 65+ comes to our Emergency Department, they are not just treated for the ailment that brought them to the hospital. A multi disciplinary team also performs a special assessment to guage the patient's status and whether they may have medication issues, be a fall risk or suffer from ailments like dementia and depression. The hope is to identify follow up care before the condition worsens. When patients leave our Emergency Department, we make sure they are transitioning home or to another care setting smoothly by developing individualized care plans following discharge, making follow up appointments."

LAWS, REGULATIONS, CATASTROPHIC ILLNESSES AND THE RISING COSTS OF NEW TECHNOLOGY HAVE CREATED A CATEGORY OF PATIENTS WHO ARE EITHER UNINSURED OR UNDERINSURED. THIS CHARITY CARE PROGRAM HAS BEEN DEVELOPED TO HELP THE HOSPITAL MEET THE NEEDS OF THESE PATIENTS AND, CONCURRENTLY, MAINTAIN THE FINANCIAL VIABILITY OF THE HOSPITAL FOR FUTURE GENERATIONS. THIS CHARITY CARE POLICY EXPLAINS HOW THE HOSPITAL ASSISTS PATIENTS WHO CANNOT PAY FOR PART OR ALL OF THE ESSENTIAL MEDICAL CARE THEY RECEIVE. PRINCIPLES: STRONG MEMORIAL HOSPITAL PROACTIVELY CONVEYS INFORMATION ABOUT THIS CHARITY CARE POLICY TO PATIENTS AND THEIR FAMILIES. - WE BELIEVE THAT FEAR OF A HOSPITAL BILL SHOULD NEVER GET IN THE WAY OF ESSENTIAL HEALTH SERVICES. THE PROVISION OF URGENT OR EMERGENT HEALTHCARE IS NEVER DELAYED PENDING A FINANCIAL ASSISTANCE DETERMINATION. SIGNS ANNOUNCING THE CHARITY CARE PROGRAM ARE POSTED IN THE HOSPITAL (E.G. EMERGENCY DEPARTMENT, ADMITTING OFFICE) TO PROACTIVELY CONVEY THIS MESSAGE TO PROSPECTIVE PATIENTS AND THE PUBLIC IN GENERAL. - WE MAINTAIN FINANCIAL AID POLICIES THAT ARE CONSISTENT WITH THE MISSION, VALUES AND CAPACITY OF THE HOSPITAL AND THAT TAKE INTO ACCOUNT EACH INDIVIDUAL'S ABILITY TO CONTRIBUTE TO THE COST OF HIS OR HER CARE. - WE COMMUNICATE THE AVAILABILITY OF FINANCIAL AID IN A MANNER THAT IS CLEAR, UNDERSTANDABLE, SENSITIVE TO THE PATIENT'S DIGNITY, AND IN MULTIPLE LANGUAGES. A NOTICE IS AVAILABLE AT REGISTRATION SITES THAT INFORMS PATIENTS OF THIS PROGRAM AND PROVIDES THE PHONE NUMBER TO CALL TO OBTAIN MORE INFORMATION AND TO APPLY FOR THIS PROGRAM. DESIGNATED STAFF ARE PROVIDED DETAILED TRAINING SO THAT THEY CAN PROVIDE INFORMATION AND ANSWER QUESTIONS ABOUT THE CHARITY CARE PROGRAM. INFORMATION IS GENERALLY AVAILABLE IN BOTH ENGLISH AND SPANISH. WHEN REQUESTED, IT WILL ALSO BE MADE AVAILABLE IN OTHER LANGUAGES. - INFORMATION REGARDING OUR CHARITY CARE PROGRAM IS ALSO AVAILABLE ON THE URMC WEBSITE. - WE IMPLEMENT FINANCIAL AID PROCEDURES THAT ARE CONSUMER-FRIENDLY, RESPECTFUL, AND CONFIDENTIAL, AS WELL AS DEBT COLLECTION POLICIES THAT REFLECT THE MISSION AND VALUES OF THIS HOSPITAL. - WE WORK WITH GOVERNMENT, PAYERS, BUSINESS, CONSUMER GROUPS AND OTHERS TO ADDRESS THE UNDERLYING PROBLEM THAT TOO MANY NEW YORKERS LACK HEALTH INSURANCE. GENERAL GUIDELINES: AS PART OF FINANCIAL PLANNING ASSISTANCE, WE PROVIDE PATIENTS, AND/OR THEIR LEGAL REPRESENTATIVE, WITH INFORMATION ABOUT THE CRITERIA THAT MUST BE MET IN ORDER TO OBTAIN MEDICAID, MEDICARE, OR OTHER HEALTH INSURANCES. PATIENTS ARE ASSISTED IN MAKING APPLICATIONS FOR ANY OF THESE INSURANCES OR DISCOUNTED FEE PLANS. PATIENTS ARE EXPECTED TO PARTICIPATE FULLY IN ALL EFFORTS TO OBTAIN ANY INSURANCE FOR WHICH THEY MAY QUALIFY. UNDER CERTAIN CIRCUMSTANCES, AS DETERMINED BY THE FINANCIAL CASE MANAGERS OR OTHER HOSPITAL SENIOR ADMINISTRATORS. APPLICATIONS FOR MEDICAID, MEDICARE OR OTHER INSURANCE PROGRAMS MAY BE WAIVED WHEN DEEMED UNNECESSARY. IF AVAILABLE INSURANCE BENEFITS ARE NOT SUFFICIENT TO COVER THE COST OF THEIR CARE, PATIENTS MAY THEN APPLY FOR ASSISTANCE FROM THE CHARITY CARE PROGRAM. CHARITY CARE APPLICATIONS MUST BE COMPLETED AND RETURNED TO THE HOSPITAL WITH THE REQUESTED INCOME DOCUMENTATION. PATIENTS WILL NOT RECEIVE CHARITY CARE ASSISTANCE IF THEY (A) DO NOT COMPLETE THE APPLICATION PROCESS FOR MEDICAID OR OTHER INSURANCE FOR WHICH THEY MAY QUALIFY, (B) ELECT NOT TO MAKE APPLICATION FOR CHARITY CARE, OR (C) HAVE ADEQUATE RESOURCES OR INCOME TO PAY PRIVATELY FOR THEIR CARE.

ANY BILL AMOUNT REMAINING AFTER APPLICATION OF A PARTIAL CHARITY CARE DISCOUNT IS THE RESPONSIBILITY OF THE PATIENT. THE AMOUNT AN APPROVED CHARITY CARE PATIENT WILL GENERALLY BE EXPECTED TO PAY FOR SERVICES COVERED BY THE POLICY WILL BE LIMITED TO THE LOWER OF THE AMOUNT THAT THE HOSPITAL WOULD HAVE RECEIVED FOR THE SAME SERVICE UNDER MEDICARE PARTS A AND B, (INCLUDING COINSURANCE, CO-PAYMENTS AND DEDUCTIBLES) OR THE USUAL AND CUSTOMARY CHARGES.

The consolidated footnote reads as follows: CommonSpirit relies on the results of detailed reviews of historical write-offs and collections in estimating the collectability of accounts receivable. Updates to the hindsight analysis is performed at least quarterly using primarily a rolling eighteen-month collection history and write-off data. Subsequent changes to estimates of the transaction price are generally recorded as adjustments to net patient revenue in the period of change. Subsequent changes that are determined to be the result of an adverse change in a third-party payor's ability to pay are recorded as bad debt expense in purchased services and other in the accompanying consolidated statements of operations and change in net assets. Bad debt expense for 2019 was not significant."
202041929349301624,470757164,"Schedule H, Part III, Line 8 Community benefit & methodology for determining medicare costs","Using essentially the same Medicare cost report principles as to the allocation of general services costs and ""apportionment"" methods, the ""CHI Workbook"" calculates a payers' gross allowable costs by service (so as to facilitate a corresponding comparison between gross allowable costs and ultimate payments received). The term ""gross allowable costs"" means costs before any deductibles or co-insurance are subtracted. Alegent Creighton Health's ultimate reimbursement will be reduced by any applicable copayment/ deductible. Where Medicare is the secondary insurer, amounts due from the insured's primary payer were not subtracted from Medicare allowable costs because the amounts are typically immaterial. Although not presented on the Medicare cost report, in order to facilitate a more accurate understanding of the ""true"" cost of services (for ""shortfall"" purposes) the CHI Workbook allows a health care facility not to offset costs that Medicare considers to be non-allowable, but for which the facility can legitimately argue are related to the care of the facility's patients. In addition, although not reportable on the Medicare cost report, the CHI workbook includes the cost of services that are paid via a set fee-schedule rather than being reimbursed based on costs (e.g. outpatient clinical laboratory). Finally, the CHI Workbook allows a facility to include other health care services performed by a separate facility (such as a physician practice) that are maintained on separate books and records (as opposed to the main facility's books and records which has its costs of service included within a cost report). True costs of Medicare computed using this methodology: Total Medicare Revenue: $47,804,471 Total Medicare costs: $101,480,566 Surplus or Shortfall: ($53,676,095) Alegent Creighton Health believes that excluding Medicare losses from community benefit makes the overall community benefit report more credible for these reasons: Unlike subsidized areas such as burn units or behavioral-health services, Medicare is not a differentiating feature of tax-exempt health care organizations. In fact, for-profit hospitals focus on attracting patients with Medicare coverage, especially in the case of well-paid services that include cardiac and orthopedics. Significant effort and resources are devoted to ensuring that hospitals are reimbursed appropriately by the Medicare program. The Medicare Payment Advisory Commission (MedPAC), an independent Congressional agency, carefully studies Medicare payment and the access to care that Medicare beneficiaries receive. The commission recommends payment adjustments to Congress accordingly. Though Medicare losses are not included by Catholic hospitals as community benefit, the Catholic Health Association guidelines allow hospitals to count as community benefit some programs that specifically serve the Medicare population. For instance, if hospitals operate programs for patients with Medicare benefits that respond to identified community needs, generate losses for the hospital, and meet other criteria, these programs can be included in the CHA framework in Category C as ""subsidized health services."" Medicare losses are different from Medicaid losses, which are counted in the CHA community benefit framework, because Medicaid reimbursements generally do not receive the level of attention paid to Medicare reimbursement. Medicaid payment is largely driven by what states can afford to pay, and is typically substantially less than what Medicare pays."
202041929349301624,470757164,"Schedule H, Part III, Line 9b Collection practices for patients eligible for financial assistance","The organization's billing and collections policy applies to all individuals presenting for emergency or other medically necessary care. The policy contains provisions for collecting amounts due from those patients who the organization knows to qualify for financial assistance either through the traditional financial assistance application process or through presumptive eligibility processes. Before engaging in extraordinary collection actions (ECAs) to obtain payment for EMCare, Hospital Facilities must make reasonable efforts through its billing and collections processes, pursuant to Treas. Reg. 1.501(r)-6(c), to determine whether an individual is eligible for Financial Assistance. In no event will an ECA be initiated prior to 120 days from the date the Facility provides the first post-discharge billing statement (i.e., during the Notification Period) unless all reasonable efforts have been made. Hospital Facilities will not refer accounts for collection where the patient has initially applied for Financial Assistance, and the Hospital Facility has not yet made reasonable efforts with respect to the account. For patients and Guarantors who are unable to provide required documentation, a Hospital Facility may grant Presumptive Financial Assistance based on information obtained from other resources. Patients who qualify for Medicaid are presumed to qualify for full charity write off. Any charges for days or services written off (excluding Medicaid denials related to timeliness of billing, insufficient medical record documentation, missing invoices, authorization, or eligibility issues) as a result of a Medicaid are booked as charity. Some Medicaid plans offer coverage for a limited or restricted list of services. If a patient is eligible for Medicaid, any charges for days or services not covered by the patient's coverage may be written off to charity without a completed application. This does not include any Share of Cost (SOC) or other patient cost-sharing amounts such as deductibles or copayments, as such costs are determined by the state to be an amount that the patient must pay before the patient is eligible for Medicaid. Health and Human Services (HSS) uses the term ""Spend Down"" instead of Share of Cost. All collection activities conducted by the Facility, a Designated Supplier, or its third-party collection agents will be in conformance with all federal and state laws governing debt collection practices. All third-party agreements governing collection and recovery activities must include a provision requiring compliance with the hospital facilities' financial assistance and billing and collections policy and indemnification for failures as a result of its noncompliance. This includes, but is not limited to, agreements between third parties who subsequently sell or refer debt of the Hospital Facility."

(PRC) is a third-party agent contracted by local health systems and local health departments ( see list below) to conduct the Community Health Needs Assessment for a four-county area, referred to as the Omaha Metro Area that includes Douglas, Sarpy, and Cass Counties, Nebraska, and Pottawattamie County, Iowa. PRC is a nationally recognized healthcare consulting firm with extensive experience conducting CHNAs across the United States since 1994. Along with several other community stakeholders, CHI Health was an active key health partner working with PRC to design, implement, and review the data. The Omaha Metro Area CHNA, conducted by PRC, utilized both primary and secondary data collected through the PRC Community Health Survey (primary); Online Key Informant Survey (primary); and public health, vital statistics, and other data collection (secondary). Please reference the complete CHNA for more in-depth details regarding the CHNA process. Under the direction of the NCDHD, the 2019 Community Health Needs Assessment was completed for the nine counties in the North Central Health District. This assessment was conducted in partnership with multiple agencies within the district and will be the basis for the Community Health Improvement Plan (CHIP). It is the goal of the 2019 NCDHD Community Health Needs Assessment to describe the health status of the population, identify areas for health improvement, determine factors that contribute to health issues, and identify assets and resources that can be mobilized to address public health improvement. The CHNA process was accomplished by utilizing the Mobilizing for Action through Planning and Partnerships (MAPP) strategy led by the North Central District Health Department (NCDHD). * North Central District Health Department (NCDHD) is a state-approved district health department that serves nine rural Nebraska counties-Antelope, Boyd, Brown, Cherry, Holt, Keya Paha, Knox, Pierce, and Rock (NCHD). NCDHD has been state-approved as a multi-county public health department, a government body at the county level, since December 2001, providing education and services to the nine-county area. NCDHD completed a Community Health Needs Assessment for all nine counties within their district. This assessment can be found online at http://www.ncdhd.ne.gov. * GIS and Human Dimensions, LLC- NCDHD and the partnering district hospitals contracted with GIS and Human Dimensions, LLC, to assemble this assessment of public health and community well-being under the provision of NCDHD, based largely upon data collected through the process of Mobilizing for Action through Planning and Partnerships (MAPP). The MAPP process is based on four assessments that provide critical insight into the health challenges and opportunities confronting the community. The assessments and the issues addressed in the assessments are listed in the MAPP Methods section of the 2019 NCDHD Community Health Needs Assessment (see the Appendix for an Executive Summary and a link to the full report). MAPP was chosen, in part, because the process allows for input from parties who represent broad interests in the communities. Input from diverse sectors involved in public health, including medically underserved, low-income, minority populations and individuals from diverse age groups, was obtained through surveys and targeted focus groups by way of invitations to community leaders and agencies."

A request for assistance may be made by the patient or a family member, close friend, or associate of the patient, subject to applicable privacy laws. In addition, Hospital registration clerks are trained to provide consultation to those who have no insurance or potentially inadequate insurance concerning their financial options including application for Medicaid and for assistance under the Financial Assistance Policy. Counselors assist Medicare eligible patients in enrollment by providing referrals to the appropriate government agencies. Once it is determined that the patient does not qualify for any third party funding, the patient is verbally notified about the existence of Financial Assistance Application and additional screening takes place by a Hospital employee to determine if the patient is eligible for charity service prior to discharge. Upon registration (and once all EMTALA requirements are met), patients who are identified as uninsured (and not covered by Medicare or Medicaid) are provided with a packet of information that addresses the Financial Assistance Policy, the plain language summary of that policy, and an application for assistance. Hospital registration clerks read the organization's medical assistance policy to those who appear to be incapable of reading, and provide translators for non-English-speaking individuals. Patients that have been discharged prior to charity screening, such as emergency room patients, receive a written notification of possible eligibility for services. If the patient is determined not to be eligible for government assistance, he/she may notify the hospital that they seek charity assistance. The appropriate charity form is sent to the patient/guarantor for completion and then returned to the hospital for evaluation and qualification. Once determination of eligibility is made, the patient is sent a notice informing him/her if they qualify for full, partial, or no charity care services. Hospital Facilities must make reasonable efforts through its billing and collections processes, pursuant to Treas.

Bon Secours Mercy Health hospitals provide programs to improve the physical surroundings and housing in the communities served. Inadequate housing has a negative impact on the health of residents in the area by leading to violence in the neighborhoods. A robust economy positively impacts residents covered by health insurance and improves the capacity of the community to support health services. Social support services such as HELP (Hospital Eligibility Link Program) are also important to support the ability of residents to gain and retain employment and therefore access to health insurance and improved access to health services."

202041959349303514,541744931,"Schedule H, Part III, Line 8 Community benefit & methodology for determining medicare costs","Medicare allowable costs reflected in Part III come directly from the facility's Medicare cost report. The cost report segregates the total facility actual expenses into costs for support departments, clinical departments (routine and ancillary) and non reimbursable departments. The cost report uses appropriate statistical bases to ""step down"" support costs to allowable clinical and non-reimbursable departments. The charges for clinical departments are matched to the total cost for these departments for a cost-to-charge ratio. Medicare-specific allowable costs for in- and outpatient ancillary departments are computed by applying the department-specific cost-to-charge ratio to the Medicare program charges by department. For routine departments, a per diem total cost is computed and applied to Medicare program days for the Medicare routine program cost. The organization feels the total shortfall of Medicare reimbursement compared to computed Medicare allowable costs should be treated as community benefit. The hospital improves access to patient care by providing services regardless of a patient's ability to pay or the hospital's ability to receive full cost reimbursement for services. The hospital also relieves the government of a financial burden when it provides care to publicly insured patients where reimbursement is less than cost of providing the service."

If full assistance is approved, no collection efforts are pursued on that patient's account(s). If partial assistance is approved, the patient is responsible for the adjusted account balance and collection efforts will follow the established practices for all patients where a self-pay balance exists. Collection efforts are not pursued on any pending FAP account. Specific criteria exists for how much financial assistance, partial or total, will be provided to the patient based on the assessed need. Criteria is based on Federal Poverty Guidelines and is reviewed and updated annually. Once a patient has been deemed eligible for the Patient Financial Assistance Program (FAP), the patient is notified by letter within 60 days after receipt of the application and supporting documentation. The patient retains eligibility for a period of eight months from the date of the application. This eligibility is identified by hospital admissions, billing and collection staff by the assignment of a specific financial class with accompanying eligibility dates. At the end of the eight months, the patient is responsible for reapplying for FAP eligibility."

Memorial Regional Medical Center is an acute care facility licensed for 225 beds, serving residents primarily from the counties of Hanover, Henrico, King and Queen, King William and New Kent and Richmond City. Bon Secours Richmond Health System serves the larger Richmond, Virginia metropolitan area and includes four hospital facilities whose service areas largely overlap. While the hospitals serve patients from many cities and counties, the majority of patients fall within the counties of Chesterfield, Henrico, Hanover and the City of Richmond totaling over 1 million residents. For the purpose of this CHNA, we refer to these as the ""Richmond Core Service Area."" The Richmond Core Service Area is primarily Caucasian and African American. When the demographics of the City of Richmond are viewed alone, we find a much lower percentage of Caucasians and a much higher percentage of African Americans than the community overall. The population age distribution for the Richmond Core Service Area is similar to Virginia overall with the exception of the City of Richmond, which has a higher percentage of 19-64 year olds (69%) and lower percentages of children (18%) and older adults (13%). Median household incomes in the United States are less than those found in Virginia overall. The Richmond Core Service Area counties of Henrico, Hanover and Chesterfield all have higher median household incomes than the U.S. overall. In contrast, the City of Richmond has a much lower median household income as compared to the U.S. and Virginia overall. Compared to Virginia, the percentage of uninsured adults is highest in the City of Richmond and lowest in Hanover County. The percentages of uninsured children show a much lower degree of variance."

Thus, we commit to improve the health of communities through partnership and collaboration with a broad range of constituencies including committed community residents - Be Person Centric: We recognize that those whom we serve are increasingly engaged in their own care and are seeking convenience, affordability and reliability. Thus, we commit to anticipate and respond to the changing expectations of health care consumers, and to ensure that we engage each person in an individualized plan for health with a focus on prevention and wellness. - Serve Those Who Are Vulnerable: We recognize, by our Catholic identity, that the struggle for a more humane world is not an option, but an integral part of spreading the gospel. Thus, we commit to serve those who are vulnerable in many ways, addressing health disparities, sustaining global ministries, healing the environment and working to end violence and oppression. - Strengthen Our Culture and Capabilities: We recognize that the health care delivery system is undergoing rapid change with increasing complexity. Thus, we commit to liberate the potential of our people by strengthening individual and collective capabilities with respect to ministry leadership, knowledge, analytics, innovation and finances.

THE HOSPITAL BELIEVED DOING ITS OWN ASSESSMENT WOULD YIELD MORE MEANINGFUL RESULTS AND A CLEARER SNAPSHOT OF THE COMMUNITY IT SERVES. THE ASSESSMENT WAS COMPRISED OF DATA COLLECTED FROM QUANTITATIVE, QUALITATIVE OR A COMBINATION OF BOTH RESOURCES. THE HOSPITAL CONTRACTED WITH SG2, AN INDUSTRY LEADER IN HEALTHCARE ANALYTICS AND CONSULTING, FOR QUANTITATIVE DATA. SG2 PROVIDED COMPREHENSIVE DEMOGRAPHIC INFORMATION OF THE HOSPITAL'S SERVICE AREA. THEY ALSO PROVIDED POPULATION GROWTH PROJECTIONS FOR THE COMMUNITY BY TOWN, AGE, GENDER, ETHNICITY/RACE, INCOME AND EDUCATION. IN ADDITION, THEY FORECASTED THE PROJECTED GROWTH OF CHRONIC DISEASE AREAS BY BOTH INPATIENT AND OUTPATIENT FOR THE HOSPITAL'S SERVICE AREA. CHANGES IN COMMUNITY DEMOGRAPHICS HAVE A DIRECT CORRELATION WITH HEALTHCARE NEEDS AND HOW TO ADDRESS THEM. ADDITIONAL QUANTITATIVE DATA WAS COLLECTED THROUGH COMMUNITY COMMONS, A WEB PORTAL (COMMUNITYCOMMONS.ORG) THAT ALLOWS ACCESS TO DATA IN MULTIPLE CATEGORIES WHICH CAN BE USED TO EXPLORE COMMUNITY HEALTH. THESE CATEGORIES INCLUDE DEMOGRAPHICS, SOCIAL AND ECONOMIC FACTORS, PHYSICAL ENVIRONMENT, CLINICAL CARE, HEALTH BEHAVIORS AND HEALTH OUTCOMES. THE GOAL OF COMMUNITY COMMONS IS TO INCREASE THE IMPACT OF THOSE WORKING TOWARD HEALTHY, EQUITABLE, AND SUSTAINABLE COMMUNITIES. CUSTOM TOOLS ALLOWED THE HOSPITAL TO FILTER DATA BY ZIP CODE AND CREATE A REPORT SPECIFICALLY FOR ITS COMMUNITY. IT ALSO ALLOWED THE HOSPITAL TO CREATE A CUSTOM REPORT WHICH HIGHLIGHTS ITS COMMUNITY'S GREATEST AREAS OF CONCERN. THE LAST SOURCE OF QUANTITATIVE DATA WAS THE 2018 COUNTY HEALTH RANKINGS AND ROADMAPS REPORT (COUNTYHEALTHRANKINGS.ORG), COLLABORATION BETWEEN THE ROBERT WOOD JOHNSON FOUNDATION AND THE UNIVERSITY OF WISCONSIN POPULATION HEALTH INSTITUTE. THIS REPORT RANKS U.S. COUNTIES IN EVERY STATE ON VARIOUS HEALTH OUTCOMES, HEALTH FACTORS, SOCIAL AND ECONOMIC CONDITIONS, AND THE PHYSICAL ENVIRONMENT. THE MAJOR GOAL OF THE RANKINGS IS TO RAISE AWARENESS ABOUT THE MANY FACTORS THAT INFLUENCE HEALTH AND THAT HEALTH VARIES FROM PLACE TO PLACE. BECAUSE THE COUNTY WHERE THE HOSPITAL IS LOCATED (COOK) IS SO LARGE AND DIVERSE, THE COOK COUNTY DEPARTMENT OF PUBLIC HEALTH RECOGNIZED THE UNIQUENESS AND IDENTIFIED INDICATORS FROM THE RANKINGS FOR WHICH LOCAL DATA EXISTED AND CREATED A REPORT SPECIFICALLY FOR SUBURBAN COOK COUNTY. THE HOSPITAL UTILIZED THIS REPORT AS WELL. QUALITATIVE DATA WAS PRIMARY COLLECTED THROUGH FOCUS GROUPS. THE HOSPITAL REALIZED THE IMPORTANCE OF GATHERING OPINIONS AND FEEDBACK FROM VULNERABLE POPULATIONS IN THE COMMUNITY WHO HAVE SOME OF THE GREATEST HEALTHCARE NEEDS. A PROFESSIONAL MODERATOR WAS HIRED TO CONDUCT THREE FOCUS GROUPS IN FEBRUARY 2018: ONE WITH SENIORS; ONE WITH SPANISH- SPEAKING UNDER-RESOURCED COMMUNITY MEMBERS AND ONE WITH ENGLISH-SPEAKING UNDER-RESOURCED COMMUNITY MEMBERS. POTENTIAL PARTICIPANTS WERE GIVEN A SHORT SCREENING QUESTIONNAIRE TO ENSURE THEY LIVED IN THE HOSPITAL'S SERVICE AREA AND SO THAT PARTICIPANTS WOULD VARY IN AGE, GENDER, INSURANCE STATUS, INCOME AND EDUCATIONAL LEVELS. THE FOCUS GROUPS FOLLOWED A GUIDELINE WHICH MIRRORED QUESTIONS INCLUDED IN THE COMMUNITY AND KEY INFORMANT SURVEYS SO THAT THE INFORMATION GATHERED COULD BE USED TO COMPARE WITH THE SURVEY RESULTS. THE MODERATOR SUMMARIZED THE RESULTS OF THE FOCUS GROUPS WHICH WERE USED AS ONE OF THE TOOLS IN IDENTIFYING THE MOST PREDOMINANT COMMUNITY NEEDS. TWO DIFFERENT SURVEYS WERE DEVELOPED TO COLLECT A COMBINATION OF BOTH QUANTITATIVE AND QUALITATIVE DATA. A COMPREHENSIVE ONLINE COMMUNITY HEALTH SURVEY WAS CONDUCTED IN ORDER TO TAKE INTO ACCOUNT INPUT FROM PERSONS WHO REPRESENT THE BROAD INTERESTS OF THE COMMUNITY SERVED BY THE HOSPITAL. THE SURVEY ASKED PARTICIPANTS TO ""GRADE"" THEIR COMMUNITIES OVERALL HEALTH AND PROVIDE FEEDBACK ON ACCESS TO CARE, BEHAVIORAL HEALTH, CHRONIC DISEASE/HEALTH ISSUES, FAMILY ISSUES AND MODIFIABLE RISK FACTORS. IT ALSO ASKED THE PARTICIPANTS TO RANK THEIR ""TOP FIVE HEALTH CONCERNS"" FOR THE COMMUNITY. THE COMMUNITY WAS INVITED TO PARTICIPATE IN THE ONLINE SURVEY THROUGH A MEDIA RELEASE AND A PAID ADVERTISEMENT IN A LOCAL NEWSPAPER, THE HOSPITAL'S ELECTRONIC COMMUNITY NEWSLETTER ""A HEALTHIER YOU"", THE HOSPITAL'S ELECTRONIC VOLUNTEER AND EMPLOYEE NEWSLETTERS AND THROUGH SOCIAL MEDIA. THE SURVEY LINK, LOCATED ON THE HOME PAGE OF THE HOSPITAL'S WEBSITE (NCH.ORG), WAS OPEN FROM FEBRUARY 21 TO MARCH 14, 2018 AND 414 PEOPLE RESPONDED. IN ADDITION, AN ONLINE SURVEY FOR KEY INFORMANTS WAS CONDUCTED SPECIFICALLY TO SOLICIT INPUT FROM KEY INFORMANTS AS DESCRIBED IN PART V, SECTION B, QUESTION 5. IN APRIL 2018, THE HOSPITAL CONVENED AN INTERNAL, MULTIDISCIPLINARY COMMITTEE WHICH MET MULTIPLE TIMES TO REVIEW THE RESULTS OF THE COMMUNITY HEALTH NEEDS ASSESSMENT, AFFIRM AND PRIORITIZE NEEDS AND TO IDENTIFY THE MOST QUALIFIED INTERNAL AND EXTERNAL PERSONS TO DEVELOP IMPLEMENTATION PLANS TO ADDRESS EACH PRIORITY NEED. REPRESENTATIVES FROM THE FOLLOWING DEPARTMENTS SERVED ON THE COMMITTEE: BEHAVIORAL HEALTH, CARE COORDINATION, COMMUNITY SERVICES, COMPLIANCE, DECISION SUPPORT, DIABETES SERVICES, EMERGENCY DEPARTMENT, EMS, FOUNDATION, GUEST SERVICES, IMMEDIATE CARE CENTERS, MARKETING, MEDICAL GROUP, NURSING, PATIENT ACCESS SERVICES, RESEARCH, AND PATIENT EXPERIENCE. IN ADDITION, THE CHAIRMAN OF THE NCH BOARD OF DIRECTORS AND THE EXECUTIVE VICE PRESIDENT CHIEF LEGAL COUNSEL PARTICIPATED IN THE COMMITTEE. THE COMMITTEE MEMBERS RECEIVED A SUMMARY AND COMPARISON DOCUMENT WHICH WAS USED AS A TOOL TO REVIEW ALL OF THE QUANTITATIVE AND QUALITATIVE FINDINGS. THE FINDINGS FROM THE FOCUS GROUPS, COMMUNITY SURVEY AND KEY INFORMANT SURVEY WERE COMPARED AND THE SECONDARY DATA PROVIDED SUPPLEMENTAL INFORMATION. THE MOST COMMON THEMES AND COMMENTS FROM THE NARRATIVE PORTION OF THE SURVEYS WERE ALSO HIGHLIGHTED IN THE DOCUMENT.

202011749349300931,421264647,Pt VI Supplemental Information,"Schedule H Part 1 Line 6a: For Fiscal Years prior to 2017, the Annual Report that included the Hospital's community benefit information was contained in a report prepared by the former parent organization, Wheaton Franciscan Services, Inc. However, effective May 1, 2016, the Iowa region of Wheaton Franciscan Healthcare was transferred to Mercy Health Network, now MercyOne. As a result of this transfer, the Iowa region has conducted their own audit, and prepared their own Community Benefit Reports through Fiscal 2017; followed by one page summaries for subsequent years. These reports can be accessed at this link: http://wfhcia.trinity-health.org/Documents/2017%20Community%20Benefit%20Re port.pdf Schedule H Part 1 Line 7: Community Benefit amounts are reported using total actual costs per the hospital's managerial accounting system in use, which includes all patient segments including inpatient, outpatient, emergency room, private insurance, Medicaid, Medicare, Medicare HMO, uninsured, and self-pay patients. Medicare is reported using the most recently filed cost report at the time the Annual Report and related community benefit information is published. Amounts are summarized using a software application recommended by the Catholic Health Association in conjunction with the Iowa Hospital Association, because it has the ability to provide the information in a format suitable for Schedule H presentation. After the data is entered by the Site Finance Directors, its accuracy is verified by employees who are trained in community benefit reporting, and then approved by the Chief Financial Officer and the President/CEO of the Iowa organization. After amounts are verified and approved, community benefit amounts become finalized. Finally, the information is compiled with the assistance of CBISA software for presentation in IRS Forms 990 Schedule H and Statement of Program Service Accomplishments Part III. The Iowa hospital facilities are not required to report community benefit information to the State of Iowa, but do make the information readily available on certain websites, and report the information to the Iowa Hospital Association. Schedule H Part 1 Line 7 Column f: Iowa Hospitals follow guidelines established by the Catholic Health Association and the Iowa Hospital Association, who recommend that bad debt expense not be included in community benefit amounts. As a result of this applied methodology, a total amount of $5,881,866 has not been included in the denominator of the calculation that determines the percentages reported on Schedule H Line 7 Column f. In addition to the community benefit described above, MercyOne Northeast Iowa also provides care to Medicare and Medicare HMO patients that is not fully reimbursed by the government. According to the most recently filed Medicare cost report, we provided $11,680,289 in unreimbursed Medicare services. We are not including the gap in Medicare reimbursement in accordance with the Catholic Health Association Community Benefit Guidelines. If we included the Medicare shortfall, our total would be $31,538,842. Schedule H Part 1 Line 7g: In the Iowa region, clinic operations are included as a department of the hospital, Covenant Medical Center, Inc. Clinic operations for the Iowa clinics are included only in the community benefit reporting of charity care, government sponsored health care, and Medicare shortfall. Therefore, costs related to physician clinics are not included in subsidized health services reported on Schedule H Part I Line 7g. Schedule H Part III Section A Lines 1-3: In determining bad debt amounts, the Iowa organizations use a two-level scoring process as follows: First, for any patient account that is categorized as having no insurance, when the amount becomes 60 days overdue or greater, the patient's account is reviewed for financial assistance qualification. If the patient is found to qualify for financial assistance, the necessary steps are taken to apply, and the needed adjustments are made so as to treat as charity care and not as bad debt. A similar scoring process is completed for those patients who do have insurance, but after 120 days or greater, still have not paid the patient responsibility portion. Again, these patient accounts are reviewed for financial assistance, and if they qualify, similar steps are taken to remove from bad debt. As a result of these scoring procedures, Iowa's position is therefore that none of the patients resulting in uncollectible accounts would have qualified as charity care patients as this determination is made at the time of admission, or later with the timing of the scoring procedures mentioned above. Bad debt is therefore only determined for each organization at the time the amount due is truly determined to be uncollectible, after financial assistance has been determined, and after many months of collection efforts. Additionally, the organization followed guidelines established by the Catholic Health Association and the Iowa Hospital Association, who recommends that no bad debt amounts be included in community benefit amounts. For these reasons, Part III Section A Line 3 is reported at zero. Schedule H Part III Section A Line 4: Covenant Medical Center, Inc. is included in the consolidated financial statements of MercyOne Northeast Iowa, Inc. The following is the text of the footnote from the financial statements which addresses the allowance for doubtful accounts. This footnote can be found on page 12 of the attached consolidated financial statements. The Company recognizes patient service revenue associated with services provided to patients who have third-party payor coverage on the basis of contractual rates for the services rendered. For uninsured patients that do not qualify for charity care, the Company recognizes revenue for services provided (on the basis of discounted rates, as provided by policy). On the basis of historical experience, a portion of the Company's uninsured patients will be unable or unwilling to pay for the services provided. Thus, the Company records a provision for uncollectible accounts related to uninsured patients in the period the services are provided. Schedule H Part III Section B Line 6-8: Schedule H Part III Section B Line 6 reports allowable costs of care as taken from the most recently filed Medicare cost report available at the time of publishing the Community Benefit Report. The Medicare cost report calculates its allowable total costs based on applicable Medicare regulations. Medicare and Medicaid cost is determined using individual cost center cost-to-charge ratios. This cost to charge ratio is determined using all payer cost and all payer charges. The cost to charge ratio is applied to the actual Medicare and Medicaid charges to determine the Medicare and Medicaid cost. This organization has adopted the cost and charge practices as recommended by the Catholic Health Association and the Iowa Hospital Association, and therefore, does not count any Medicare shortfall numbers in its annual reporting of Community Benefit amounts. Schedule H Part III Section C Line 9b: Iowa organizations follow a policy that outlines all collection practices for patients who are known to qualify for government programs and for our charity care program. We make every attempt to assist the patient in enrolling in government insurance plans or our own charity care program allowing for free or discounted care. If the patient does not qualify for any type of aid or charity care, declines to establish a reasonable payment plan or pay the liability, the patient will be moved into a bad debt status, and the account is sent to a collection agency. This does not occur before the patient has received several notices and a final written warning. Please also see Schedule H Part III Section A Lines 1-4 narrative response. Schedule H Part V Section A and Section C: Affiliates of the Iowa region have defined and reported hospital facilities to include only those bricks and mortar buildings that actually have inpatient beds, in addition to meeting all other criteria under Iowa state law required for hospital licensing. Although there may be other facilities within our system built to hospital specifications, performing hospital-based billing, and conforming to other hospital standards under state law, until there is further guidance from the IRS, these facilities have been reported in Section C, due to their lack of having state certified inpatient beds. Schedule H Part VI Line 2: Iowa assesses the needs of the communities it serves by reviewing admission and discharge data, analyzing information from the community health departments and other community leaders, and by aligning our services with the Healthy People 2020 and other current year initiatives. The Iowa hospital organizations complete a Community Health Needs Assessment and Implementation Plan every three years. Please reference Schedule H Part V Section B Lines 1-"

THAT REVIEW IDENTIFIED THE FOLLOWING FOR THE FAP: 1) THE AMOUNTS TO WHICH ANY DISCOUNT PERCENTAGES UNDER THE FAP WILL BE APPLIED NEEDED TO BE SPECIFIED; 2) A DESCRIPTION OF THE OFFICE, DEPARTMENT, COMMITTEE OR OTHER BODY WITH FINAL AUTHORITY OR RESPONSIBILITY FOR DETERMINING THAT THE HOSPITAL HAS MADE REASONABLE EFFORTS TO DETERMINE WHETHER AN INDIVIDUAL IS FAP-ELIGIBLE NEEDED TO BE INCLUDED; 3) THE LIST OF PROVIDERS DELIVERING EMERGENCY OR OTHER MEDICALLY NECESSARY CARE IN THE HOSPITAL WHO ARE COVERED BY THE FAP AND THE LIST OF PROVIDERS WHO ARE NOT WAS NOT UPDATED IN THE LAST 90 DAYS. 4) COPIES OF THE FAP APPLICATION FORM NEEDED TO BE DISTRIBUTED TO ALL REFERRING STAFF PHYSICIANS.IN RESPONSE TO THE OMISSIONS, ERRORS, AND FAILURES WITH THE FAP CORRECTIONS WERE MADE IMMEDIATELY TO ADDRESS THE ISSUES IDENTIFIED. LANGUAGE WAS ADDED TO THE FAP TO 1) DESCRIBE THE AMOUNTS TO WHICH ANY DISCOUNT PERCENTAGE WOULD BE APPLIED AND 2) DESCRIBE THE DEPARTMENT WITH RESPONSIBILITY FOR DETERMINING THAT THE HOSPITAL HAS MADE REASONABLE EFFORTS TO DETERMINE WHETHER AN INDIVIDUAL IS FAP-ELIGIBLE. 3) THE LIST OF PROVIDERS DELIVERING EMERGENCY OR OTHER MEDICALLY NECESSARY CARE IN THE HOSPITAL WHO ARE COVERED BY THE FAP AND THE LIST OF PROVIDERS WERE REVIEWED AND UPDATED. A PROCESS TO REVIEW AND UPDATE BOTH LISTS EVERY 90 DAYS WAS ALSO PUT IN PLACE. 4) THE PLAIN LANGUAGE SUMMARY WAS DISTRIBUTED TO REFERRING STAFF PHYSICIANS AND A PROCESS IS IN PLACE TO DISTRIBUTE ANNUALLY. IT WAS DETERMINED THAT NO INDIVIDUALS WERE HARMED BY THESE OMISSIONS, ERRORS, AND FAILURES. PATIENTS WHO WERE FAP-ELIGIBLE RECEIVED ALL APPROPRIATE DISCOUNTS AND THE PARTICIPATING AND NON PARTICIPATING PROVIDER LISTS HAD DEPARTMENTS THAT HAD CLOSED OR PROVIDERS THAT HAD LEFT THE ORGANIZATION SO PATIENTS WOULD NOT HAVE RECEIVED CARE IN THOSE AREAS.THE REVIEW ALSO IDENTIFIED THE FOLLOWING FOR THE PLAIN LANGUAGE SUMMARY: LANGUAGE NEEDED TO BE REVISED TO LIST A PHYSICAL LOCATION WHERE AN INDIVIDUAL CAN OBTAIN COPIES OF THE FAP AND HOW TO OBTAIN A FREE COPY OF THE FAP AND APPLICATION FORM BY MAIL.IN RESPONSE TO THE OMISSIONS, ERRORS, AND FAILURES, THE PLAIN LANGUAGE SUMMARY CORRECTIONS WERE MADE IMMEDIATELY TO ADDRESS THE ISSUES IDENTIFIED. LANGUAGE WAS ADDED TO CLARIFY THAT THE LOCATIONS AND PHONE NUMBERS OF THE FINANCIAL COUNSELORS ALREADY LISTED ARE WHERE SOMEONE WOULD OBTAIN FREE COPIES EITHER IN PERSON OR BY MAIL. THE PLAIN LANGUAGE SUMMARY DID NOT SPECIFICALLY STATE FREE, HOWEVER THE ORGANIZATION HAS NEVER CHARGED AN INDIVIDUAL FOR COPIES OF THE FAP DOCUMENTS. IT WAS DETERMINED THAT NO INDIVIDUALS WERE HARMED BY THESE OMISSIONS, ERRORS, AND FAILURES.THE REVIEW ALSO IDENTIFIED THAT THE CREDIT AND COLLECTION POLICY HAD NOT BEEN ADOPTED UNTIL JULY 27, 2017 BY THE AUTHORIZED BOARD. THE CREDIT AND COLLECTION POLICY IS APPROVED BY THE COMMONWEALTH OF MASSACHUSETTS AND HAD BEEN PREVIOUSLY ADOPTED BY THE BOARD OF TRUSTEES IN 2004. IT WAS DETERMINED THAT NO INDIVIDUALS WERE AFFECTED BY THIS ERROR."

A SAMPLE OF CURRENT ACTIVITIES INCLUDE: THE JOINT COMMITTEE FOR CHILDREN'S HEALTHCARE IN EVERETT; THE MALDEN'S PROMISE COALITION; MEDFORD HEALTH MATTERS; LOCAL COUNCILS ON AGING; THE MELROSE COMMUNITY COALITION; LOCAL SUBSTANCE ABUSE PREVENTION COALITIONS IN MALDEN, MELROSE, MEDFORD, READING, STONEHAM, AND WAKEFIELD; AS WELL AS THE REGIONAL MASSACHUSETTS OPIOID ABUSE PREVENTION COLLABORATE (MOAPC) AND SUBSTANCE ABUSE PREVENTION COLLABORATIVE (SAPC), BOTH PROGRAMS OF THE MYSTIC VALLEY PUBLIC HEALTH COALITION. MWHC ALSO FORMALLY PARTNERS WITH THE NORTH SUBURBAN CHILD AND FAMILY RESOURCE NETWORK, SERVING LYNNFIELD, MALDEN, MELROSE, NORTH READING, READING, STONEHAM, WAKEFIELD, AND WINCHESTER; AND THE EVERETT, AND MEDFORD COORDINATED FAMILY AND COMMUNITY ENGAGEMENT (CFCE) GRANT PROGRAMS FUNDED BY THE MA DEPARTMENT OF EARLY EDUCATION AND CARE; THE TRI-CITY HUNGER NETWORK AND A HOST OF OTHER COMMUNITY-BASED AND GUIDED COALITIONS AND INITIATIVES. A SPECIFIC EXAMPLE OF THIS COMMUNITY BUILDING INCLUDES MWHC'S REPRESENTATION ON THE MELROSE ALLIANCE AGAINST VIOLENCE (MAAV). MAAV IS A NON-PROFIT, COMMUNITY-BASED ORGANIZATION THAT FOCUSES ON OUTREACH, EDUCATION AND COMMUNITY COLLABORATION IN ORDER TO RAISE AWARENESS OF THE PROBLEMS OF DOMESTIC VIOLENCE AND SEXUAL ASSAULT IN MELROSE. WORKING CLOSELY WITH THE MELROSE POLICE DEPARTMENT, THE BOARD OF DIRECTORS OF MAAV INCLUDES A REPRESENTATIVE FROM MWHC, AS WELL AS MEMBERS FROM THE MELROSE SCHOOLS, CLERGY, HEALTH DEPARTMENT, STUDENTS, AND COMMUNITY MEMBERS AT LARGE. MELROSE-WAKEFIELD HOSPITAL IS A FOUNDING MEMBER OF THIS IMPORTANT COMMUNITY-BASED AGENCY.IN ADDITION, MWHC HAS CONTINUED TO CONVENE A NUMBER OF COMMUNITY OUTREACH TEAMS TO ASSIST WITH THE COLLECTION OF COMMUNITY HEALTH NEEDS INFORMATION TO OPTIMIZE THE BENEFITS OF COMMUNITY HEALTH EDUCATION AND SCREENINGS. THE TEAMS HAVE SPONSORED AND PARTICIPATED IN EVENTS RANGING FROM INFORMAL (PLANNING HEALTH EVENTS AND SCREENINGS) TO MORE FORMAL (PARTICIPATION ON HEALTHY MELROSE, STONEHAM SUMMER SAFETY DAY, AND THE MOBILE FOOD MARKET IN MALDEN), OFFERING MULTIPLE OPPORTUNITIES TO INTERACT WITH A WIDE RANGE OF COMMUNITY MEMBERS TO FORM TRUSTING RELATIONSHIPS, LISTEN TO THE VOICES OF INDIVIDUAL COMMUNITY MEMBERS, AND FOSTER THE DEVELOPMENT OF RESILIENCE WITHIN EACH COMMUNITY. AS MWHC BEGINS THE LAST YEAR OF ITS IMPLEMENTATION PLAN FOR 2017-2019, IT CONTINUES TO UTILIZE THE COLLECTIVE KNOWLEDGE OF THE TEAM CAPTAINS. THE TEAM'S ORGANIZING CHARTER GUIDES THE MEMBERSHIP TOWARD SALIENT ACTIVITIES. RELEVANT HEALTH DATA AND THE IDENTIFIED TARGET POPULATION LISTS ARE PROVIDED TO EACH TEAM CAPTAIN TO ASSIST THEM IN PLANNING PROGRAMS IN THEIR COMMUNITIES. CURRENTLY, THERE ARE SIX (6) COMMUNITY OUTREACH TEAMS NAMED FOR MALDEN/EVERETT, MEDFORD, MELROSE, WAKEFIELD, READING/NORTH READING AND STONEHAM. SAUGUS DID NOT HAVE A TEAM IN 2018, BUT WAS SERVED BY THE MWHC COMMUNITY SERVICES DEPARTMENT. THE TEAMS CONTINUOUSLY SOLICIT INPUT FROM COMMUNITY LEADERS INCLUDING SUPERINTENDENTS OF SCHOOLS, STATE REPRESENTATIVES, BUSINESS LEADERS, FIRE AND POLICE OFFICIALS AND LOCAL HEALTH DEPARTMENTS. MANY EMPLOYEES SERVING ON TEAMS ALSO PARTICIPATE IN OTHER COMMUNITY GROUPS AND CIVIC ORGANIZATIONS. MORE THAN 40 EMPLOYEES, VOLUNTEERS, AND PHYSICIANS WERE INVOLVED IN TEAM-SPONSORED EVENTS IN FISCAL YEAR 2019/TAX YEAR 2018 (FY 2019/TY 2018).THE COMMUNITY TEAM EFFORTS HAVE BEEN ACKNOWLEDGED BY FOUR AREA CHAMBERS OF COMMERCE, OTHER CIVIC ORGANIZATIONS, THE AMERICAN HOSPITAL ASSOCIATION, AND THE MASSACHUSETTS HOSPITAL ASSOCIATION."

202002309349302630,042767880,"PART III, LINE 4:","THE FOLLOWING IS FROM THE WELLFORCE, INC. AND CONSOLIDATED AFFILIATES (THE SYSTEM) AUDITED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS, OF WHICH MELROSEWAKEFIELD HEALTHCARE, INC. IS INCLUDED, RELATING TO CHARITY CARE AND BAD DEBT EXPENSE:2019 CHARITY CARE AND COMMUNITY BENEFIT FOOTNOTECHARITY CARE - THE SYSTEM'S COMMITMENT TO COMMUNITY SERVICE IS EVIDENCED BY SERVICES PROVIDED TO THE POOR AND BENEFITS PROVIDED TO THE PATIENTS THAT IT SERVES. THE SYSTEM PROVIDES HEALTH CARE SERVICES TO PATIENTS WHO MEET CERTAIN CRITERIA UNDER ITS CHARITY CARE POLICY. THESE PATIENTS MAY RECEIVE FULL ASSISTANCE OR MAY BE SUBJECT TO PARTIAL LIABILITY BASED ON INCOME AND FAMILY SIZE. BECAUSE THE SYSTEM DOES NOT PURSUE COLLECTION OF AMOUNTS DETERMINED TO QUALIFY AS CHARITY CARE, SUCH AMOUNTS ARE NOT REPORTED AS NET PATIENT SERVICE REVENUE.THE SYSTEM PROVIDED CHARITY CARE, BASED ON CHARGES FORGONE AND THE ESTIMATED COST OF THE CHARITY CARE PROVIDED AMOUNTED TO $42,553K AND $16,904K, FOR THE YEAR ENDED SEPTEMBER 30, 2019 AND $33,556K AND $12,228K FOR THE YEAR ENDED SEPTEMBER 30, 2018, RESPECTIVELY. THE ESTIMATED COST OF CHARITY CARE IS BASED ON THE RELATIONSHIP OF PATIENT CARE SERVICE CHARGES TO THE RELATED COSTS APPLIED TO CHARITY CARE CHARGES RECOGNIZED DURING THE YEARS ENDED SEPTEMBER 30, 2019 AND 2018.PROVISION FOR UNCOLLECTIBLE ACCOUNTSACCOUNTS RECEIVABLE ARE REDUCED BY AN ALLOWANCE FOR UNCOLLECTIBLE ACCOUNTS. IN EVALUATING THE COLLECTABILITY OF ACCOUNTS RECEIVABLE, THE SYSTEM ANALYZES ITS PAST HISTORY AND IDENTIFIES TRENDS FOR EACH OF ITS MAJOR PAYER SOURCES OF REVENUE TO ESTIMATE THE APPROPRIATE PROVISION FOR UNCOLLECTIBLE ACCOUNTS. MANAGEMENT REGULARLY REVIEWS DATA ABOUT THESE MAJOR PAYER SOURCES OF REVENUE IN EVALUATING THE SUFFICIENCY OF THE ALLOWANCE FOR UNCOLLECTIBLE ACCOUNTS. FOR RECEIVABLES ASSOCIATED WITH SERVICES PROVIDED TO PATIENTS WHO HAVE THIRD-PARTY COVERAGE, THE SYSTEM ANALYZES CONTRACTUALLY DUE AMOUNTS AND HISTORIC PAYMENT TRENDS AND RECORDS ESTIMATED CONTRACTUAL ALLOWANCES. THE SYSTEM RECORDS A SIGNIFICANT PROVISION FOR UNCOLLECTIBLE ACCOUNTS IN THE PERIOD OF SERVICE ON THE BASIS OF ITS PAST EXPERIENCE, WHICH INDICATES THAT MANY PATIENTS ARE UNABLE OR UNWILLING TO PAY THE PORTION OF THEIR BILLS FOR WHICH THEY ARE FINANCIALLY RESPONSIBLE. THE DIFFERENCE BETWEEN THE STANDARD RATES AND THE AMOUNTS ACTUALLY COLLECTED AFTER ALL REASONABLE COLLECTION EFFORTS HAVE BEEN EXHAUSTED IS CHARGED OFF AGAINST THE ALLOWANCE FOR UNCOLLECTIBLE ACCOUNTS.MWHC'S ALLOWANCE FOR UNCOLLECTIBLE ACCOUNTS FOR ALL PATIENTS WAS 25% OF ACCOUNTS RECEIVABLE AS OF SEPTEMBER 30, 2019 AND 30% OF ACCOUNTS RECEIVABLE AS OF SEPTEMBER 30, 2018. IN ADDITION, THE SYSTEM'S WRITE-OFFS, NET OF RECOVERIES, WERE $8,904K AND $7,199K, RESPECTIVELY, FOR THE YEARS ENDED SEPTEMBER 30, 2019 AND 2018. THE CHANGES WERE A RESULT OF MANAGEMENT'S REVIEW OF HISTORICAL TRENDS IN UNCOLLECTIBLE ACCOUNTS AND DETERMINATION OF RESERVES, INCLUDING THE IMPACT OF THE PROVISIONS OF THE PATIENT PROTECTION AND AFFORDABLE CARE ACT.THE SYSTEM HAS NOT CHANGED ITS CHARITY CARE OR UNINSURED DISCOUNT POLICIES DURING 2019. THE SYSTEM DOES NOT MAINTAIN A MATERIAL ALLOWANCE FOR UNCOLLECTIBLE ACCOUNTS FROM THIRD-PARTY PAYERS, NOR DID IT HAVE SIGNIFICANT BAD DEBT WRITE-OFFS FROM THIRD-PARTY PAYERS.HEALTH SAFETY NET FUND (HSN) - THE COMMONWEALTH OF MASSACHUSETTS (THE ""COMMONWEALTH"") OPERATES THE HSN, WHICH WAS CREATED BY THE COMMONWEALTH'S HEALTH CARE REFORM ACT TO REPLACE THE STATE'S UNCOMPENSATED CARE POOL. THE HSN ALLOCATES THE COST OF UNCOMPENSATED CARE AMONG THE HOSPITALS IN THE COMMONWEALTH. HOSPITALS HAVE BEEN ASSESSED A UNIFORM ALLOWANCE BASED ON ESTIMATES OF THE STATEWIDE COST OF UNCOMPENSATED CARE AND REIMBURSED FOR A PORTION OF THE COST OF UNCOMPENSATED CARE, SUBJECT TO CERTAIN LIMITATIONS. REIMBURSABLE UNCOMPENSATED CARE INCLUDES NET CHARITY CARE AND CERTAIN UNCOLLECTIBLE ACCOUNTS RELATED TO EMERGENCY SERVICES. HOSPITALS' RECOVERIES FROM THE HSN ARE BASED ON A CLAIMS-BASED PAYMENT METHOD THAT USES MEDICARE PRINCIPLES. REIMBURSEMENT FROM THE HSN FOR UNCOMPENSATED CARE IS RECORDED IN NET PATIENT SERVICE REVENUE IN THE CONSOLIDATED STATEMENT OF OPERATIONS. THE COMMONWEALTH HAS DETERMINED FINAL SETTLEMENTS WITH RESPECT TO THE HSN FOR ALL YEARS PRIOR TO 2014.COMMUNITY BENEFIT - IN FURTHERING ITS CHARITABLE PURPOSE, THE SYSTEM PROVIDES A WIDE VARIETY OF HEALTH CARE SERVICES TO THE COMMUNITY IN ORDER TO PROVIDE ACCESS TO APPROPRIATE CARE FOR POPULATIONS IN NEED. THE SYSTEM HAS DEVELOPED A FORMAL COMMUNITY BENEFIT IMPLEMENTATION PLAN THAT RESPONDS TO THE COMPREHENSIVE ASSESSMENT OF HEALTH CARE NEEDS IN THE COMMUNITY. THE COMMUNITY BENEFIT PLAN SUPPORTS SERVICES THAT TARGET NOT ONLY THE GENERAL POPULATION IN THE SYSTEM'S SERVICE AREA, BUT ALSO PARTICULAR POPULATIONS WITH SPECIAL HEALTH CARE NEEDS, INCLUDING THE POOR, ELDERLY, CHILDREN, AND MINORITY POPULATIONS. SUPPORTED SERVICES INCLUDE VARIOUS DIRECT CARE PROGRAMS, HEALTH SCREENING, HEALTH EDUCATION AND SUPPORT GROUPS OPERATED IN THE SYSTEM'S SERVICE AREA. THE SYSTEM WORKS ACTIVELY WITH OTHER AREA SERVICE PROVIDERS TO FACILITATE THE DEVELOPMENT OF AN EFFECTIVE COMMUNITY HEALTH NETWORK. THE SYSTEM ALSO PARTICIPATES IN ACTIVITIES DESIGNED TO FOSTER AND ENHANCE THE ECONOMIC AND CIVIC ENVIRONMENT AND TO IMPROVE THE HEALTH EQUITY OF ITS SERVICE AREA.TOTAL MELROSEWAKEFIELD HEALTHCARE, INC. UNCOMPENSATED CARE FOR THE YEARS ENDED SEPTEMBER 30, 2019 AND 2018, WAS AS FOLLOWS: PROVISION FOR CHARITY CARE (AT COST)$536,000 (2019) ; $262,000 (2018)PROVISIONS FOR BAD DEBTS (AT COST)$4,238,000 (2019) ; $3,948,000 (2018)HSN (ASSESSMENTS NET OF REIMBURSEMENT)$546,000 (2019) ; $1,365,000 (2018)TOTAL UNCOMPENSATED CARE$5,320,000 (2019) ; $5,575,000 (2018)"

THIS EFFORT IS ACHIEVED BY:-INVESTING FUNDS INTO COMMUNITIES THROUGH EVIDENCE-BASED AND EVIDENCE-INFORMED PROGRAMS AND SERVICES, INCLUDING THOSE BASED ON THE SOCIAL DETERMINANTS OF HEALTH.-MAKING SURE THAT CARE IS AVAILABLE TO EVERYONE REGARDLESS OF THE ABILITY TO PAY.-USING COMPASSION AS A CORNERSTONE IN IMPROVING THE HEALTH OF OUR COMMUNITIES.-ATTENDING TO THE NEEDS OF PATIENTS AND THEIR FAMILY MEMBERS BY ADDRESSING THE NEEDS OF THE WHOLE PERSON NOT JUST AS A FACTOR OF THEIR DISEASE OR A DIAGNOSIS.-PROVIDING A RANGE OF SPECIAL BENEFITS TO THE COMMUNITY, SUCH AS PROGRAMS TO MANAGE CARE FOR PERSONS WITH CHRONIC DISEASES, HEALTH EDUCATION AND DISEASE PREVENTION INITIATIVES, PROGRAMS FOR FAMILIES WITH YOUNG CHILDREN, OUTREACH FOR THE ELDERLY, AND CARE FOR PERSONS WHO ARE POOR OR UNINSURED.- ACTING AS A CATALYST, PARTICIPANT, AND LEADER IN IMPROVING THE HEALTH OF THE COMMUNITY THROUGH LOCAL PARTNERSHIPS SUCH AS WITH MALDEN OVERCOMING ADDICTION, MEDFORD HEALTH MATTERS, AND FOOD SECURITY TASKS FORCES BOTH REGIONALLY AND LOCALLY.-OFFERING SPACE AND OTHER IN-KIND SERVICES TO AGENCIES SUCH AS ALCOHOLICS ANONYMOUS, PORTAL TO HOPE, AND MANY OTHERS WHOSE PROGRAMS ALIGN WITH THE HEALTH SYSTEM'S HEALTH PRIORITIES.IN COMPLIANCE WITH IRS GUIDELINES, A YEAR-LONG PROCESS TO DEVELOP A FORMAL COMMUNITY HEALTH NEEDS ASSESSMENT (CHNA) WAS COMPLETED BY MELROSEWAKEFIELD HEALTHCARE (FORMERLY HALLMARK HEALTH SYSTEM, INC.) IN AUGUST 2019, IN COLLABORATION WITH THE INSTITUTE FOR COMMUNITY HEALTH (ICH), A NON-PROFIT ORGANIZATION RECOGNIZED FOR COMMUNITY-BASED PARTICIPATORY RESEARCH, ASSESSMENT, AND DISSEMINATION. THIS PROCESS INCLUDED A REVIEW OF REPUTABLE PUBLIC HEALTH, SOCIO-ECONOMIC, AND FOUNDATION DATA; INPUT FROM THE MELROSEWAKEFIELD HEALTHCARE COMMUNITY BENEFITS ADVISORY COUNCIL, COMMUNITY OUTREACH TEAMS, PATIENT/FAMILY ADVISORY COUNCIL, LOCAL COMMUNITY COALITIONS, AND COMMUNITY RESIDENTS. STAKEHOLDER INTERVIEWS AND SURVEYS, COMMUNITY SURVEYS AND COMMUNITY FORUMS WERE ALSO COMPLETED. SOME OF THE COMMUNITY FORUMS WERE HELD IN COLLABORATION WITH OTHER HEALTH SYSTEMS SERVING THE AREA SUCH AS BETH ISRAEL/LAHEY HEALTH, CAMBRIDGE HEALTH ALLIANCE, THE LOCAL SAFETY NET HEALTH SYSTEM, AND MASSACHUSETTS GENERAL HOSPITAL. IN ADDITION, CAMBRIDGE HEALTH ALLIANCE, MASSACHUSETTS GENERAL HOSPITAL, AND MELROSEWAKEFIELD HEALTHCARE COMPLETED AN ADDITIONAL CHNA FOCUSED ON DETERMINING THE SOCIAL DETERMINANT NEEDS IN EVERETT AND MALDEN. ALL SYSTEMS SERVE THESE CITIES WHICH HAS SOME OF THE LARGEST AND MOST DIVERSE COMMUNITIES IN OUR SERVICE AREA.REFLECTING IRS REQUIREMENTS, AND TO FOSTER TRANSPARENCY, THE ENTIRE CHNA AND PRIOR CHNA AS WELL AS THE EVERETT/MALDEN REPORT ARE POSTED ON THE MWHC WEBSITE AND IN PRINTED VERSIONS AT EACH HOSPITAL CAMPUS AND OTHER KEY EASILY ACCESSIBLE LOCATIONS IN EACH COMMUNITY IN THE CATCHMENT AREA. THE COMMUNITY HEALTH IMPROVEMENT PLAN (CHIP) FOR 2017-2019 IS ALSO POSTED ON MWHC'S WEBSITE. THIS CHIP WAS BOARD APPROVED TO COVER THROUGH 2/15/2020 WHEN THE NEW PLAN WAS COMPLETED, BOARD APPROVED AND PLACED ON THE SYSTEM'S WEBSITE AT HTTPS://WWW.MELROSEWAKEFIELD.ORG/IN-THE-COMMUNITY/COMMUNITY-BENEFITS/COMMUNITY-BENEFITS-PROGRAMS/FROM THE FIRST QUARTER OF FISCAL 2018 AND CONTINUING INTO THE FIRST QUARTER OF FISCAL 2019, IT BECAME APPARENT THAT DUE TO SIGNIFICANT FINANCIAL CHALLENGES FACING THE ORGANIZATION, THE COMMUNITY BENEFITS EXPECTED TO BE DELIVERED TO THE COMMUNITY WOULD NEED TO BE FURTHER REDUCED. IN FISCAL 2019 THE CHIP WAS AMENDED TO REFLECT THESE CHANGES. THE CHANGES ARE POSTED ON THE HEALTH SYSTEMS' WEBSITE.ONGOING MONITORING OF THE CHNA AND ITS IDENTIFIED HEALTH PRIORITIES IS THE RESPONSIBILITY OF THE COMMUNITY BENEFITS ADVISORY COUNCIL (CBAC). AS OF THE END OF FY 2019/TY 2018, THE MWHC COUNCIL INCLUDED: A RECENTLY RETIRED TRUSTEE OF MELROSEWAKEFIELD HEALTHCARE; SYSTEM VICE PRESIDENT OF HOME CARE & COMMUNITY PROGRAMS; EXECUTIVE VICE PRESIDENT & CHIEF LEGAL OFFICER; CHIEF MARKETING OFFICER; TWO MWHC EMPLOYED PHYSICIANS; FISCAL CONTROLLER; DIRECTOR, COMMUNITY SERVICES; MANAGER, CASE MANAGEMENT; MANAGER, CENTRAL SCHEDULING, INSURANCE COORDINATION, AND INTERPRETER SERVICES; MANAGER, COMMUNITY BENEFITS AND OPERATIONS; THE CHIEF COMPLIANCE OFFICER OF MWHC; AND 12 COMMUNITY REPRESENTATIVES.THE CBAC PROVIDES OVERSIGHT FOR THE CHNA, AND THE PROCESS FOR RECOGNIZING CURRENT AND EMERGING HEALTH NEEDS IN THE COMMUNITY, AS WELL AS DEVELOPING A MULTI-YEAR COMMUNITY HEALTH IMPLEMENTATION/IMPROVEMENT PLAN (CHIP) TO RESPOND TO THESE NEEDS. THE CBAC MEETS SIX TIMES PER YEAR TO ENSURE COMPLIANCE WITH THE CHIP, REVIEW PROGRAM OUTCOMES, DISCUSS IMPORTANT COMMUNITY HEALTH ISSUES, AND OFFER RECOMMENDATIONS TO THE BOARD OF TRUSTEES RELATED TO COMMUNITY HEALTH NEEDS AND DISPARITIES. THE COUNCIL IS ALSO AVAILABLE ON-LINE TO ADDRESS ANY ISSUES THAT MIGHT ARISE BETWEEN SCHEDULED MEETING TIMES. THE CBAC APPROVES ANY AND ALL AMENDMENTS TO THE CHIP RESULTING FROM EMERGING HEALTH ISSUES OR UNPLANNED CHANGES IN CAPACITY, BUT SIGNIFICANT AMENDMENTS ALSO RECEIVE BOARD APPROVAL.THE COUNCIL ALSO ENGAGES NEW MEMBERS FROM THE COMMUNITIES SERVED TO JOIN THE GROUP, PRIORITIZING CANDIDATES WHO CAN ASSIST THE CBAC AND MWHC TO BETTER UNDERSTAND COMMUNITY HEALTH NEEDS AND BARRIERS TO ACCESS. IN FY 2019, THE MELROSEWAKEFIELD COMMUNITY BENEFITS ADVISORY COUNCIL ADDED FOUR NEW MEMBERS TO MEET CURRENT ENGAGEMENT STANDARDS SET BY THE MASSACHUSETTS DEPARTMENT OF PUBLIC HEALTH AND ATTORNEY GENERAL'S OFFICE, AND TO REPLACE MEMBERS THAT LEFT THE COUNCIL. THE COUNCIL IS CURRENTLY COMPRISED OF 27 MEMBERS.THE COUNCIL REPORTS TO THE GOVERNANCE COMMITTEE OF THE BOARD OF TRUSTEES AND THE FULL BOARD IS RESPONSIBLE FOR FINAL APPROVAL ON THE CHNA, CHIP, AND OTHER MATTERS OF IMPORTANCE SUCH AS REVIEWING COUNCIL RECOMMENDATIONS FOR SIGNIFICANT AMENDMENTS TO THE COMMUNITY HEALTH IMPLEMENTATION/IMPROVEMENT PLAN.MWHC ALSO ACTIVELY PARTICIPATES WITH THE COMMUNITY THROUGH ITS COMMUNITY OUTREACH TEAMS, SOLICITING INPUT FROM KEY COMMUNITY LEADERS, INCLUDING SUPERINTENDENTS OF SCHOOLS, STATE REPRESENTATIVES, BUSINESS LEADERS, FIRE AND POLICE PERSONNEL AND LOCAL HEALTH DEPARTMENTS. ADDITIONAL APPROACHES INCLUDE WORK AS MEMBERS OF COMMUNITY COALITIONS AND WITH THE COMMUNITY HEALTH NETWORK AREAS (CHNA 15 AND 16) DESIGNATED BY THE MA DEPARTMENT OF PUBLIC HEALTH. THESE STRATEGIES HAVE PROVEN EFFECTIVE IN GAINING VITAL PERSPECTIVE AROUND THE HEALTH NEEDS OF LOCAL RESIDENTS, AND IN TAILORING OUTREACH MESSAGES AND PROGRAMMING BASED ON WHAT CONSTITUENCIES AND COMMUNITIES VALUE MOST. WHILE CHNA 16 IS NO LONGER VERY ACTIVE, THE MEMBERS OF THE CHNA ARE STILL CLOSELY ALIGNED WITH MWHC.(COMMUNITY TEAMS FUNCTIONS ARE FURTHER EXPLAINED IN THE DESCRIPTION OF COMMUNITY ACTIVITIES IN PART II.)ANOTHER WAY THAT MWHC ASSESSED NEEDS WITHIN THE COMMUNITY IS THROUGH THE PATIENT/FAMILY ADVISORY COUNCIL (PFAC). THIS COUNCIL WAS FORMED TO OBTAIN FEEDBACK AND IDEAS FROM COMMUNITY MEMBERS ON HOW THE HOSPITALS CAN BE MORE RECEPTIVE TO THE UNIQUE NEEDS OF COMMUNITY RESIDENTS, ESPECIALLY THOSE OF DIVERSE BACKGROUNDS, AND TO PROMOTE THE HIGHEST QUALITY OF PATIENT-CENTERED SERVICES BY FOSTERING A STRONG PARTNERSHIP THROUGH OUTREACH ACTIVITIES WITH COMMUNITY RESIDENTS. THE PFAC COUNCIL OFTEN ASSISTS MWHC STAFF BY PROVIDING INPUT INTO THE PLANNING OF FUTURE COMMUNITY ACTIVITIES AND INITIATIVES.AS PART OF ITS EFFORTS TO IMPROVE HEALTH STATUS IN THE CATCHMENT AREA, MWHC ALSO PARTICIPATES IN A VARIETY OF BROAD-BASED COMMUNITY COALITIONS AND INITIATIVES THAT WORK TOWARDS ADDRESSING THE SPECIFIC AND GENERAL HEALTH NEEDS IN THESE CITIES AND TOWNS. A SAMPLE OF THESE MEMBERSHIPS INCLUDE: LOCAL COUNCILS ON AGING; THE MIDDLESEX COUNTY DISTRICT ATTORNEY'S OPIOID TASK FORCE: THE SAFE BABY/SAFE KIDS TASK FORCE THROUGH THE MIDDLESEX COUNTY DISTRICT ATTORNEY'S OFFICE; THE PORTAL TO HOPE DOMESTIC VIOLENCE COUNCIL, MEDFORD'S BIG TABLE; THE TRI-CITY HUNGER NETWORK; THE TRI-CITY HOUSING AND HOMELESSNESS COALITION, THE CHINESE CULTURE CONNECTION; SUBSTANCE ABUSE PREVENTION COALITIONS IN MALDEN, MELROSE, MEDFORD, READING, WAKEFIELD, AND STONEHAM; THE MALDEN'S PROMISE COALITION, MA DEPARTMENT OF PUBLIC HEALTH MASS IN MOTION PROGRAMS IN MELROSE-WAKEFIELD, MALDEN, AND EVERETT; AND THE MELROSE, STONEHAM, AND WAKEFIELD ALLIANCES AGAINST VIOLENCE. ONE CENTRAL FOCUS OF MWHC'S COMMUNITY BENEFITS GROUPS AND LOCAL LEADERS, INCLUDES ENHANCING RELATIONSHIPS WITH FAITH-BASED AND GRASSROOTS ORGANIZATIONS. SUCH RELATIONSHIPS PROVIDE INSIGHT INTO HOW THESE GROUPS VIEW MWHC'S ROLE IN THEIR COMMUNITY, HOW OUR SYSTEM CAN IMPROVE THE WAYS WE SERVE DIVERSE RESIDENTS, AND HOW THE SYSTEM SHOULD STRENGTHEN COLLABORATION TO BEST MEET DIVERGENT HEALTH NEEDS.(SEE CONTINUATION LATER)"

FOR THOSE PATIENTS THAT REQUEST SUCH ASSISTANCE MWHC'S CERTIFIED FINANCIAL COUNSELORS ASSIST PATIENTS BY SCREENING THEM FOR ELIGIBILITY IN AVAILABLE PUBLIC ASSISTANCE PROGRAMS OR THE MWHC'S FINANCIAL ASSISTANCE PROGRAM. THIS INFORMATION IS WIDELY SHARED WITH ORGANIZATIONS REPRESENTING THE MOST UNDERSERVED RESIDENTS IN THE COMMUNITY SUCH AS THE LOCAL POVERTY AGENCY, ACTION FOR BOSTON COMMUNITY DEVELOPMENT (ABCD) A COMMUNITY ACTION PROGRAM (CAP), THE JOINT COMMITTEE FOR CHILDREN'S HEALTH CARE IN EVERETT, SOUTH COVE, AND EAST BOSTON NEIGHBORHOOD HEALTH CENTERS AND MANY OTHERS.MWHC FINANCIAL COUNSELORS PROVIDED 26,543 INTERACTIONS WITH COMMUNITY MEMBERS AND COMPLETED APPLICATIONS FOR INDIVIDUALS IN THE STATE HEALTH PROGRAMS; SUCH AS MASS HEALTH, HEALTH CONNECTOR CHILDREN'S MEDICAL SECURITY PLAN AND THE HEALTH SAFETY NET. MASSHEALTH APPLICATIONS WERE DETERMINED TO BE ELIGIBLE FOR A VARIETY OF CATEGORIES SUCH AS: STANDARD, CAREPLUS, COMMONHEALTH, FAMILY ASSISTANCE, LIMITED, CHILDREN'S MEDICAL SECURITY PLAN, PREMIUM ASSISTANCE, BUY-IN, AND HEALTH SAFETY NET. ADDITIONALLY, LONG TERM CARE AS WELL AS HARDSHIP APPLICATIONS WERE COMPLETED. IN THE HEALTH CONNECTOR PLANS, WHICH ARE MAINLY DETERMINED BASED ON THE HOUSEHOLD INCOME, THE APPLICATIONS RESULTED IN APPROVALS FOR CONNECTOR CARE PLANS (1, 2A, 2B, 3A AND 3B) AS WELL AS UNSUBSIDIZED HEALTH CONNECTOR PLANS DIFFERENTIATED BY METALLIC TIERS (BRONZE, SILVER, GOLD AND PLATINUM). ADDITIONAL INTERACTIONS, WHICH ARE NOT QUANTIFIED ABOVE, INCLUDED APPLICATIONS FOR MEDICARE PART D AND EXTRA HELP.

APPLICATIONS ARE REVIEWED AND DETERMINED USING FEDERAL POVERTY GUIDELINES.OTHER FORMS OF COUNSELING INCLUDED EDUCATION FOR RISING MEDICARE ELIGIBLE COMMUNITY MEMBERS TO HELP THEM UNDERSTAND THEIR RIGHTS AND BENEFITS AND TO MEET DEADLINES THAT WOULD OTHERWISE LEAVE THEM UNINSURED AT CRITICAL TIMES. COUNSELORS ALSO PLAYED A VITAL ROLE IN HELPING PATIENTS UNDERSTAND AND DIFFERENTIATE BETWEEN TRADITIONAL MEDICARE AND ADVANTAGE PLANS. CONSEQUENTIALLY, COUNSELORS ALSO DABBLED IN MEDICARE SUPPLEMENTAL INSURANCES FOR THOSE UNWILLING TO APPLY OR UNABLE TO QUALIFY FOR MASSHEALTH BENEFITS.SERVICES PROVIDED BY FINANCIAL COUNSELORS INCLUDED CONTACTING DOCTORS TO COMPLETE FORMS THAT WERE NEEDED TO PROVIDE EMERGENCY MEDICATION OR FREE MEDICINE FROM MANUFACTURERS, ADVOCATING WITH INSURANCE COMPANIES ON THEIR BEHALF, HELPING THEM SETTLE BILLS OR SETTING UP PAYMENT PLANS, CONTACTING OTHER PROVIDERS AND ADVOCATING FOR A REDUCTION OR WRITE OFF OF CHARGES, HELPING THEM SORT THROUGH REAMS OF DOCUMENTS TO HELP THEM PROVIDE REQUIRED DOCUMENTATION FOR INSURANCE OR UTILITY DISCOUNTS.MWHC HAS NO ROLE IN SPECIFICALLY DETERMINING THE ELIGIBILITY FOR ENROLLMENT IN A PUBLIC ASSISTANCE PROGRAM, BUT AT THE PATIENT'S REQUEST MAY TAKE A DIRECT ROLE IN APPEALING OR SEEKING INFORMATION RELATED TO THE COVERAGE DECISION.MWHC PROVIDES ALL SELF-PAY INDIVIDUALS WITH A GENERAL NOTICE OF THE AVAILABILITY OF PUBLIC ASSISTANCE AND FINANCIAL ASSISTANCE PROGRAMS DURING A PATIENT'S INITIAL IN-PERSON PRE-REGISTRATION AT A HOSPITAL LOCATION FOR NON-EMERGENCY SERVICES, BY PHONE CALL OR IN-PERSON INTERVIEWS ONCE A PATIENT IS ADMITTED TO THE HOSPITAL FROM THE EMERGENCY ROOM OR DISCHARGED FROM THE EMERGENCY ROOM, IN ALL BILLING INVOICES THAT ARE SENT TO A PATIENT OR GUARANTOR, AND WHEN THE PROVIDER IS NOTIFIED OR THROUGH ITS OWN DILIGENCE BECOMES AWARE OF A CHANGE IN THE PATIENT'S ELIGIBILITY STATUS FOR PUBLIC OR PRIVATE INSURANCE COVERAGE.IN ADDITION, MWHC ALSO POSTS INFORMATIONAL FLYERS WITH A LIST OF DOCUMENTS NEEDED FOR APPLICATIONS AND THE TELEPHONE NUMBER TO SCHEDULE AN APPOINTMENT THROUGH CENTRAL SCHEDULING.WHEN COMMUNICATING WITH PATIENTS REGARDING FINANCIAL ASSISTANCE, ESPECIALLY DURING SCHEDULED INTERVIEWS, OR ON THE TELEPHONE, MWHC ATTEMPTS TO DO SO IN THE PRIMARY LANGUAGE OF THE PATIENT OR HIS/HER FAMILY, IF REASONABLY POSSIBLE, AND IN A MANNER CONSISTENT WITH ALL APPLICABLE FEDERAL AND STATE LAWS AND REGULATIONS. ADDITIONALLY, THE FAP IS DISTRIBUTED IN MULTIPLE LANGUAGES AT NON-TRADITIONAL LOCATIONS SUCH AS THE MOBILE FOOD MARKET AND FAMILY NETWORKS IN OUR SERVICE AREA. THE FAP IS AVAILABLE ON THE MWHC WEBSITE WHICH ALSO OFFERS A TRANSLATION FEATURE TO ACCOMMODATE VISITS.WHEN LANGUAGE IS AN ISSUE THAT IMPEDES PROPER UNDERSTANDING OF THE APPLICATION PROCESS FOR HEALTH INSURANCE OR ADDITIONAL FINANCIAL ASSISTANCE, FINANCIAL COUNSELORS USE THE LANGUAGE LINE, A TRANSLATION SERVICE, TO ENSURE THAT THE PATIENT UNDERSTANDS ALL ASPECTS OF THE PROCESS IN HIS/HER NATIVE LANGUAGE. THIS IS OF SPECIAL IMPORTANCE AS APPROVALS FOR SOME CATEGORIES REQUIRE THE PATIENT TO CHOOSE A PLAN OR MAKE A PAYMENT AFTER THE INITIAL ENCOUNTER WITH THE FINANCIAL COUNSELOR."

Maryland's State Health Improvement Process (SHIP) provides a framework for continual progress toward a healthier Maryland. Maryland's State Heath Improvement Process (SHIP) began with national, state and local data being reviewed and analyzed by the Maryland Department of Health and Mental Hygiene (DHMH) Office of Population Health as well as by the five Departments of Health (Talbot, Caroline, Dorchester, Queen Anne's, Kent). It has three main components: accountability, local action and public engagement. SHIP includes 39 measures that provide a framework to improve the health of Maryland residents. Twenty-eight of the measures have been identified as critical racial/ethnic health disparities. Each measure has a data source and a target, and where possible, can be assessed at the county level. UM SRH's priorities are aligned with the Maryland State Health Improvement Process vision areas and those objectives outlined by the local health improvement coalition. Health Priorities FY2020-2022 The top five priorities: 1. Access to care 2. Preventable ER visits 3. Chronic Disease management 4. Mental health/substance abuse 5. Cancer Several additional topic areas were identified by UM SRH: safe housing, transportation, and substance abuse. The unmet needs not addressed by UM SRH will continue to be addressed by key governmental agencies and existing community- based organizations. While UM SRH will focus the majority of our efforts on the identified priorities outlined in the CHNA Implementation Plan, we will review the complete set of needs identified in the CHNA for future collaboration and work. These areas, while still important to the health of the community, will be met through other health care organizations with our assistance as available.

Under Maryland's global budget revenue model, UM SRH reports on a regular basis how it is investing in efforts to improve population health. UM SRH provides on-going services that are fundamental to addressing the identified community health needs that demonstrate the extent to which our commitment to serve our community is integrated into our care delivery model. We have a strong focus on treating patients with chronic conditions. UM Shore Regional Health works to coordinate care, ensure smooth transitions and promote disease self-management strategies at every step of a patient's journey - whether at home, in the community, or within our hospital. We operate specialized clinics to enable access to routine outpatient care. Our transitional care services help patients newly diagnosed or those that have had a recent hospitalization transition safely back to the community. Transitional nurse navigators provide patients with disease education and self-management strategies, connect them to primary care providers and specialists, and help them overcome any barriers to making follow up appointments. An urgent care center to address off hours visits and low acuity emergencies is also available. Our coudamin clinic provides anticoagulation medication management, specifically managing and monitoring warfarin (Coumadin) therapy upon physician referral. It also provides patients with ongoing monitoring of their anticoagulation therapy to ensure desired outcomes and decrease adverse events. Additionally, our behavioral health clinic provides a community access point for those in need of outpatient mental health services. Resources are embedded throughout the hospital and in the community so that every patient receives the same level of care coordination. Care managers are embedded within our emergency department and hospital, and provide in-home visits as needed. Community health workers reach out to patients who are identified as being high risk for readmission or in need of critical resources. Close relationships are maintained with skilled nursing facilities and home health agencies so that transfers from the hospital to these facilities are smooth, and the highest quality of care is constantly delivered. Strong relationships exist with local emergency medical service (EMS) providers through our mobile integrated health program, which delivers effective and efficient care to patients outside of the hospital. Nurses and community health workers function outside traditional emergency response roles, with a focus on maintaining individuals' health at their homes while also providing convenient access to care in the community. Additional care partners include primary care providers, specialists, local department of health, office on aging and other community based partners."

We will always do what is right for the patient, no matter where they are in their health journey, and will always strive to have our patients receive care in the community they reside. As a part of the University of Maryland Medical System (UMMS) we are shaping a new paradigm in care delivery that we believe should be the future standard of care."

The Health Services Cost Review Commission, (HSCRC) determines payment through a rate setting process and all payors, including governmental payors, pay the same amount for the same services delivered at the same hospital. Maryland's unique all payor system includes a method for referencing Uncompensated Care in each payors' rates, which does not enable Maryland hospitals to breakout any offsetting revenue related to Uncompensated Care. Community benefit expenses are equal to Medicaid revenues in Maryland, as such, the net effect is zero. Additionally, net revenues for Medicaid should reflect the full impact on the hospital of its share of the Medicaid assessment."

These activities include: active engagement and collaboration with local Health Departments, Chambers of Commerce, and organizations that work to improve the quality of life for the residents of the Mid-Shore (Talbot, Caroline, Dorchester, Queen Anne's, and Kent Counties) Because local action is essential to public health progress, UM Shore Regional Health works in partnership with public sector agencies, health care providers and community-based partners. In addition, a variety of clinical and non-clinical UM SRH associates serve on various coalition workgroups. The work of UM SRH and community-based partners continues on the identified priorities and objectives of the Maryland Department of Health and Mental Hygiene's (DHMH) State Health Improvement Process (SHIP). SHIP, launched in September 2011, focuses on improving the health of Maryland residents in six vision areas: Healthy Babies, Healthy Social Environments, Safe Physical Environments, Infectious Disease, Chronic Disease and Health Care Access. Under SHIP's umbrella, the coalition develops and implements strategies that will improve local public health. UM SRH maintains open communication with the Health Departments of Talbot, Caroline, Dorchester, Queen Anne's, and Kent Counties, Mid-Shore Mental Health System, Choptank Community Health System, local government and schools. UM SRH's community outreach programs can be found in County schools, senior centers, community centers and churches throughout the Mid-Shore. UM SRH's director of community outreach participates in committees and advisory councils, promoting continuous dialogue between the medical center and community stakeholders. This provides opportunities for new ideas and programs to be exchanged, allowing UM SRH to maximize community outreach efforts. UM SRH seeks insight from community members attending educational programs through its outreach events. Program participants are asked to complete a brief survey evaluation, providing feedback and comments about the program they attended, as well as providing suggestions for future program topics."

The legislation established a workgroup on rural health care delivery to oversee a study of healthcare delivery in the Middle Shore region and to develop a plan for meeting the health care needs of the five counties -- Caroline, Dorchester, Kent, Queen Anne's and Talbot. The purpose of the study was to assess the health care of the residents of the five-county study area and the capacities of the health system in the region, and propose options for enhancing health and health care delivery on the Mid-Shore. The research team was asked to consider: (1) the limited availability of health care providers and services; (2) the special needs of vulnerable populations, including the frail and elderly, racial and ethnic minorities, immigrants and patients with persistent behavioral illnesses; (3) barriers to access caused by transportation limitations; and (4) the economic impact of closures, partial closures or conversions of health care facilities.

All patients presenting as self pay and requesting charity relief from their bill will be screened at all points of entry, for possible coverage through state programs and a probable determination for coverage for either Medical Assistance or Financial Assistance (charity care) from the hospital is immediately given to the patient. The process is resource intensive and time consuming for patients and the hospital; however, if patients qualify for one of these programs, then they will have health benefits that they will carry with them beyond their current hospital bills, and allow them to access preventive care services as well. UM Shore Regional Health works with a business partner who will work with our patients to assist them with the state assistance programs, which is free to our patients. If a patient does not qualify for Medicaid or another program, UM Shore Regional Health offers our financial assistance program. UM Shore Regional Health posts notices of our policy in conspicuous places throughout the hospitals- including the emergency department, has information within our hospital billing brochure, educates all new employees thoroughly on the process during orientation, and does a yearly re- education to all existing staff. All staff have copies of the financial assistance application, both in English and Spanish, to supply to patients who, after screening, have a need for assistance. UM Shore Regional Health has a dedicated Financial Assistance Liaison to work with our patients to assist them with this process and expedite the decision process. Shore Health notifies patients of the availability of financial assistance funds prior to service during our calls to patients, through signage at all of our registration locations, through our patient billing brochure and through our discussions with patients during registration. In addition, the patient information sheet is mailed to patients with all statements and/or handed to them if needed. * Shore Health prepares its Financial Assistance Policy (FAP) in a culturally sensitive manner, at a reading comprehension level appropriate to the CBSA's population, and in Spanish. * Shore Health posts its FAP and financial assistance contact information in admissions areas, emergency rooms, and other areas of our facilities in which eligible patients are likely to present; * Shore Health provides a copy of the FAP and financial assistance contact information to patients or their families as part of the intake process; * Shore Health provides a copy of the FAP and financial assistance contact information to patients with discharge materials. * A copy of Shore Health's FAP along with financial assistance contact information, is provided in patient bills; and/or * Shore Health discusses with patients or their families the availability of various government benefits, such as Medicaid or state programs, and assists patients with qualification for such programs, where applicable. * An abbreviated statement advising of Shore Health's financial assistance policy, including a phone number to call for more information, is run annually in the local newspaper (Star Democrat)"
202021839349301407,520610538,"Schedule H, Part VI, Line 4 Community information","Situated on Maryland's Eastern Shore, Shore Regional Health's three hospitals, University of Maryland Medical Center at Easton (UMC at Easton), University of Maryland Medical Center at Dorchester (UMC at Dorchester), University of Maryland Medical Center at Chestertown (UMC at Chestertown) are not- for-profit hospitals offering a complete range of inpatient and outpatient services to over 170,000 people throughout the Mid-Shore of Maryland. Shore Regional Health's service area is defined as the Maryland counties of Caroline, Dorchester, Talbot, Queen Anne's and Kent. UMC at Easton is situated at the center of the mid-shore area and thus serves a large rural geographical area (all five counties of the mid-shore). UMC at Dorchester is located approximately 18 miles from Easton and primarily serves Dorchester County and portions of Caroline County. UMC at Chestertown located in Chestertown, in Kent County merged with Shore Regional Health in July 2013. UMC at Chestertown serves the residents of Kent County, portions of Queen Anne's and Caroline Counties and the surrounding areas. The five counties of the Mid-Shore comprise 20% of the landmass of the State of Maryland and 2% of the population. The entire region has over 4,400 employers with nearly 45,000 workers. Only 50 of those employers employ 100 or more workers. The economic condition varies significantly throughout the region, especially for Caroline, Dorchester, and Kent Counties. It should be noted that Talbot County appears to have a significantly higher median income than Caroline and Dorchester; however, a large percentage of the population has incomes in line with those of Caroline and Dorchester. The figures for Talbot are somewhat skewed due to large incomes of a few individual families and high net worth individuals. Shore Regional Health's service area has a higher percentage of population aged 65 and older as compared to Maryland overall. Talbot County has a 27.2% rate for this age group and Kent County has 25.3% of its residents age 65 years or older. These rates are 65% higher than Maryland's average percentages, and higher than other rural areas in the state by almost a quarter. Today, more than two-thirds of all health care costs are for treating chronic illnesses. Among health care costs for older Americans, 95% are for chronic diseases. The cost of providing health care for one person aged 65 or older is three to five times higher than the cost for someone younger than 65.

Services include medical and senior citizen demand services and fixed route county and regional service. While most of the region is served by the fixed routes, there are gaps in coverage in the less populated areas of the counties. The regional system, Maryland Upper Shore Transit (MUST), provides low cost service for the general public from Kent Island to Ocean City with convenient free transfer points at key locations on the shore. MUST is a coordinated effort of several Upper Shore agencies and governments to provide a regional transit system for Kent, Queen Anne's, Talbot, Caroline, and Dorchester Counties. Transit services are provided by Queen Anne's County Ride (operated by the county) and Delmarva Community Transit (DCT), a private company under contract to the counties.

PARO PROVIDES A SYSTEMATIC APPROACH TO FINANCIAL ASSISTANCE: "" PREDICTIVE MODEL THAT ENCOMPASSES HEALTHCARE ECONOMICS AND CREDIT POLICIES;"" UNIFORM ASSESSMENT MEASURE FOR EVERY PATIENT REGARDLESS OF FINANCIAL STANDING; "" ACCOUNTS FOR PATIENTS THAT ARE UNRESPONSIVE, ILLITERATE, OR OTHERWISE CHALLENGED TO APPLY; "" ELIMINATES BARRIER TO APPLICATION AND MEETS INCREASED PRESSURE TO PROVIDE ADDITIONAL FINANCIAL RESOURCES TO CONSUMERS; "" IDENTIFY AND SUPPORT THOSE COMMUNITY NEEDS EFFORTS TO PROVIDE ASSISTANCE TO THOSE CONSUMERS IN NEED."" THERE ARE TWO DATA POINTS RETURNED TO UPMC IN ORDER TO MAKE THE DECISION WHETHER THE PATIENT WOULD QUALIFY FOR CHARITY CARE. THE FIRST IS THE ESTIMATED INCOME LEVEL BASED ON THE FEDERAL POVERTY LEVEL GUIDELINES. THE SECOND IS THE PARO SCORE WHICH UTILIZES AN ALGORITHM BASED APPROACH AND RETURNS A SCORE BASED ON PERSONAL ATTRIBUTES OF THE PATIENT. DATA ELEMENTS WERE COMBINED TO CREATE TWO PRIMARY INDICATORS OF NEED, THE PARO SCORE AND THE FEDERAL POVERTY LEVEL. PARO ANALYZED OUR HISTORICAL CHARITY CARE APPROVALS TO DETERMINE OUR PARO THRESHOLD AND THE FPL THRESHOLD FOR THE HISTORICAL APPROVALS. THE APPROVED CHARITY CARE ACCOUNTS WERE COMPARED AGAINST ACCOUNTS THAT WERE IN ACTIVE ACCOUNTS RECEIVABLE. THIS WAS DONE TO DETERMINE IF THE DISTRIBUTIONS WERE SIMILAR OR IF ANY PATTERN EXISTED BASED ON THE APPROVED ACCOUNTS AND THE UNKNOWN ACCOUNTS.

IMPORTANTLY, THESE PLANS ADDRESS LOCAL COMMUNITY NEEDS NOT ONLY AT THE HOSPITAL LEVEL, BUT ALSO INCLUDE EFFORTS UNDERTAKEN IN PARTNERSHIP WITH OTHER UPMC HOSPITALS, EXTERNAL ORGANIZATIONS, AND THE LARGER UPMC SYSTEM. KEY THEMES THAT EMERGED AT UPMC HOSPITALS THROUGHOUT PENNSYLVANIA CAN BE GROUPED INTO FOUR BROAD CATEGORIES - CHRONIC DISEASE MANAGEMENT, BEHAVIORAL HEALTH, ACCESS TO CARE AND NAVIGATING RESOURCES, AND PREVENTION AND COMMUNITY-WIDE HEALTHY LIVING. THE 2019 CHNA REPORTS AND 2019-2022 STRATEGIC PLANS FOR EACH UPMC HOSPITAL CAN BE FOUND ON UPMC'S WEBSITE: HTTPS://WWW.UPMC.COM/ABOUT/COMMUNITY-COMMITMENT/COMMUNITY-HEALTH-NEEDS-ASS ESSMENT. UPMC WILLIAMSPORT MADE MEASURABLE PROGRESS ON IMPROVING COMMUNITY HEALTH IN THE PERIOD FROM FISCAL YEARS 2014 THROUGH 2019. THE HOSPITAL IS ADDRESSING THE SIGNIFICANT NEEDS IDENTIFIED IN ITS MOST RECENTLY CONDUCTED CHNA THROUGH A RANGE OF PROGRAMS AND INITIATIVES. TO HELP ADDRESS BEHAVIORAL HEALTH NEEDS, THE HOSPITAL HAS IMPLEMENTED AN ADDICTION MEDICINE PROGRAM TO MONITOR OPIOID ADDICTION AND SUBSTANCE ABUSE AND TO TAILOR SERVICES AS NEEDED. THE HOSPITAL IS ALSO WORKING CLOSELY WITH THE LOCAL SINGLE COUNTY AUTHORITY AND CLEANSLATE, INC. TO HELP PROVIDE WARM HAND-OFFS FOR PATIENTS TO ACCESS COMMUNITY TREATMENT; MORE THAN 100 PATIENTS ARE SEEN PER MONTH. TO HELP ADDRESS ACCESS TO CARE AND NAVIGATING RESOURCES, THE HOSPITAL IS ACTIVELY RECRUITING PRIMARY CARE PROVIDERS - SUCCESSFULLY FILLING PEDIATRICS AND FAMILY MEDICINE POSITIONS AT OFFICES IN MONTOURSVILLE, WILLIAMSPORT, LOYALSOCK, AND DUBOISTOWN. IN ADDITION, PRIMARY CARE OFFICES ARE NOW FULLY OPERATIONAL FOR SAME-DAY AND WALK-IN APPOINTMENTS; BY EXPANDING THE OFFICE APPOINTMENT AVAILABILITY TO NON-TRADITIONAL OFFICE HOURS THAT START IN THE EARLY MORNING, EVENING, AND ON WEEKENDS, PATIENTS HOW HAVE INCREASED ACCESS TO CARE, WHICH ALSO DECREASES THE NUMBER OF PATIENTS VISITING THE EMERGENCY DEPARTMENT FOR TREATMENT. TO HELP ADDRESS PREVENTION AND COMMUNITY-WIDE HEALTH LIVING, THE HOSPITAL CONTINUES TO ENCOURAGE COMMUNITY MEMBERS TO PARTICIPATE IN ROUTINE CHECK-UPS AND HEALTH SCREENINGS - OFFERING EDUCATION AND SCREENINGS FOR BREAST, COLON, AND LUNG CANCER. IN COLLABORATION WITH THE OTHER UPMC HOSPITALS IN THE REGION, UPMC WILLIAMSPORT CONTINUES TO HOST SPIRIT OF WOMEN EVENTS, INCLUDING GIRLS' NIGHT OUT AND DAY OF DANCE; THESE EVENTS HELP MOTIVATE AND INSPIRE WOMEN TO MAKE POSITIVE, HEALTHY CHANGES IN THEIR LIVES. LASTLY, IN PARTNERSHIP WITH THE OTHER UPMC HOSPITALS IN THE REGION, UPMC WILLIAMSPORT IS ADDRESSING INTERPERSONAL SAFETY THROUGH THE STOP THE BLEED PROGRAM. SINCE JULY 1, 2019, THE PROGRAM HAS OFFERED 45 STOP THE BLEED CLASSES, TRAINING A TOTAL OF 1,200 COMMUNITY MEMBERS, INCLUDING EMPLOYEES OF UPMC, TWO SCHOOL DISTRICTS, AND LOCAL BUSINESSES. AFFILIATED HEALTH CARE SYSTEM: - UPMC WILLIAMSPORT IS PART OF THE UPMC INTEGRATED DELIVERY AND FINANCING SYSTEM (IDFS), WHICH COMBINES A MAJOR HEALTH SERVICES DIVISION WITH 40 HOSPITALS AND MORE THAN 700 CLINICAL LOCATIONS, WITH A 3.8 MILLION-MEMBER INSURANCE SERVICES DIVISION. ONE OF THE LARGEST NONPROFIT HEALTH SYSTEMS IN THE UNITED STATES, UPMC SERVES PATIENTS SEEKING HIGHLY SPECIALIZED MEDICAL CARE PRIMARILY FROM COMMUNITIES ACROSS PENNSYLVANIA, AS WELL AS THROUGHOUT THE NATION AND AROUND THE WORLD. UPMC IS ALSO ONE OF THE LARGEST MEDICAL INSURERS IN THE STATE - PROVIDING MEDICAL ASSISTANCE, MEDICARE ADVANTAGE, CHILDREN'S HEALTH INSURANCE, AND BEHAVIORAL HEALTH PRODUCTS. UPMC CONTINUES TO APPLY THE EXPERTISE THAT EXISTS WITHIN ITS ORGANIZATION TO IMPROVE THE DELIVERY OF HEALTH CARE - TO ALIGN INCENTIVES AND IMPROVE MEDICAL PRACTICE THROUGHOUT THE REGION. THE RESULT IS AN EXCEPTIONAL SYNERGY BETWEEN INSURANCE, HEALTH CARE PROVIDERS, PATIENTS, AND LOCAL COMMUNITIES. OVER THE PAST DECADE, UPMC HAS PROVIDED A WIDE VARIETY OF BENEFITS TO THE COMMUNITIES IT SERVES. WORKING IN WAYS BOTH LARGE AND SMALL, UPMC HAS IMPLEMENTED INTITIATIVES THAT CONTINUE TO ENHANCE THE HEALTH OF COMMUNITIES THROUGHOUT PENNSYLVANIA AND BEYOND. COMMITTED TO ITS MISSION OF SERVICE, UPMC PROVIDES APPROXIMATELY $1 BILLION A YEAR IN COMMUNITY BENEFITS - SUCH A MEDICAL EDUCATION, RESEARCH, AND FREE COMMUNITY HEALTH PROGRAMS; AND UPMC DELIVERS MORE CARE TO THE REGION'S POOR AND UNDERSERVED THAN ANY OTHER HEALTH SYSTEM IN THE STATE. UPMC'S SYSTEMWIDE OPERATIONS GENERATED A TOTAL ECONOMIC IMPACT OF MORE THAN $36 BILLION. UPMC STIMULATES THE ECONOMY THROUGH DIRECT HIRING AND BY BRINGING OUTSIDE DOLLARS INTO THE REGION; THE ORGANIZATION'S CAPITAL SPENDING CREATES CONSTRUCTION JOBS DOWNSTREAM. IN ADDITION, UPMC HAS A NUMBER OF PROGRAMS AND INITIATIVES DESIGNED TO FOSTER A PRODUCTIVE AND EQUITABLE ECONOMY. A KEY COMPONENT IN THE ORGANIZATION'S ECONOMIC DEVELOPMENT STRATEGY IS SUPPLIER DIVERSITY, WHICH IS AN INTEGRAL PART OF UPMC'S OVERALL SUPPLY CHAIN MANAGEMENT STRATEGY. DESIGNED TO ENSURE THAT CERTIFIED MINORITY, WOMEN-OWNED, OR DISADVANTAGED BUSINESS ENTERPRISES ARE PROVIDED WITH MAXIMUM OPPORTUNITIES TO PARTICIPATE AS PARTNERS AND SUPPLIERS OF GOODS AND SERVICES, UPMC'S SUPPLIER DIVERSITY PROGRAM ENCOURAGES DEVELOPMENT OF THESE FIRMS TO MAKE THEM COMPETITIVE IN THE OUTSIDE MARKET. UPMC'S SPEND ON SUPPORTING MINORITY AND WOMEN-OWNED BUSINESSES WAS $212 MILLION IN 2019."

201923189349303787,112868878,PART VI - SUPPLEMENTAL INFORMATION,"Question 1: Part I, Line 3c: This hospital is an affiliated entity of Northwell Health Inc. (""Northwell""). Northwell uses FPG to determine eligibility and utilizes the New York State Department of Health (NYSDOH) guidelines regarding the consideration of assets. Asset tests cannot be used to deny financial assistance, but only to ""upgrade"" a patient's level of obligation, up to the legal maximum permitted under the financial assistance law. Part I, Line 6a: The Community Benefit report is prepared by the hospital, in conjunction with an affiliated entity (Northwell) of the hospital. The Community Benefit Report is accessible to the public and can be accessed on the Northwell website: https://www.northwell.edu/about/our-organization/office-community-and-publ ic-health/reports. Part I, 7: Row (a) The cost of charity care was determined by utilizing the ratio of cost to charges (RCC) calculated on Worksheet 2 applied to gross charges written off for patients qualifying for charity under the hospital's financial assistance policy. Bad Debt was not reported in any row of Part I, Line 7. Row (b) The Ratio of Cost to Charges method (or RCC) is used to determine the cost of ancillary services. A RCC is developed from these costs, and that RCC is applied to total Medicaid gross ancillary services charges to determine the cost of services provided to Medicaid patients. Row (e) Costs associated with Community Health Improvement Services were determined by adding indirect or overhead costs to the direct costs of the activity. Indirect costs were calculated as a percentage of direct costs. Direct costs for staff expenses were calculated using average system hourly rates, and were adjusted to account for fringe benefits, using a blended rate based on the ratio of total employee benefit expenses to total salary and wages. Row (f) The Bad Debt Expense that appears on Form 990, Part IX, Line 25 column (A), but not included for purposes of calculating the percentage in this column is equal to the amount reported on Form 990, Part X. The costs related to health professions education were determined by utilizing the step down method of cost finding. Row (h) Costs associated with research activities were determined by adding indirect, or overhead, costs to the direct costs of the activity. Indirect costs were calculated as a percentage of costs. Row (i) The cost of in-kind contributions to community groups is comprised of the direct costs of personnel whose compensated time was donated to various charities and community groups. The salaries and wages were adjusted to include benefits using a rate based on the ratio of total employee benefit expenses to total salary and wages. Indirect costs were calculated as a percentage of direct costs. Column (f) for Rows (c)-(k) The percentage of Net Community Benefit Expense divided by Total Expense for the hospital (to calculate the percent of total expense). Note: For the entire Northwell Health Inc. and affiliates, Part I, Line 7 (Row K, Column F) is approximately 12.32 as a percentage of expenses. Part II: All community building activities improve access to health services and address federal, state, or local public health priorities, as well as leverage public health department activities, and in doing so, they provide relief of government burden. These activities broadly serve low-income, underserved patients, and include: collaboration with various community coalitions, system-wide recycling initiative, organizational response to worldly disasters, and bioterrorism efforts. Northwell's bioterrorism & disaster preparedness includes Center for Emergency Medical Services, has a designated Bioterrorism Resource Center, and has conducted staff training for more than 100 hospitals and area first responders and invested heavily in the infrastructure needed for large-scale emergencies. During catastrophes (both natural and terrorism), Northwell provides a safe haven for thousands of patients, outside nursing home residents, and community members seeking shelter. Northwell assists with the transport of patients and stand ready to contribute food, medicine, and blankets for both affiliated and non-affiliated hospital patients. Investment in a field hospital has furthered the public health infrastructure needed for mass casualties that could result from a terrorist attack, natural attack, or large-scale emergency. Part III, Line 2: For patients who were determined by Northwell to have the ability to pay but did not, the uncollected amounts are recorded as bad debt expense. The amount of gross charges written off is reduced by any charity care or other discounts provided to the patient, as well as any payments received. Bad debt expense reported on this line is reported net of governmental or private offsetting funds. Part III, Line 3: N/A Part III, Line 4: For patients who were determined by Northwell to have the ability to pay but did not, the uncollected amounts are recorded as bad debt expense. Part III, Line 8: Medicare costs are determined utilizing a combination of the step down method of cost findings and a cost per unit of service. Cost per unit of service is used to calculate the routine cost of services provided to Medicare patients. The Ratio of Cost to Charges method (or RCC) is used to determine the cost of ancillary services. An RCC is developed from these costs, and that RCC is applied to total Medicare gross ancillary services charges to determine the cost of services provided to Medicare patients. Part III, Line 9b: The organization's collection policy is standard to all accounts regardless of insurance status (e.g. insured, underinsured, and uninsured). The hospital's collection policy states that they will not send patient accounts to collection if a decision on a financial assistance application is pending, or if a patient is determined to be eligible for Medicaid at the time services were rendered and for which services Medicaid payment is available. Question 2: NEEDS ASSESSMENT: The Community Health Needs Assessment (CHNA) is performed on an ongoing basis. Northwell conducts and participates in population, demographic, and health status evaluations of our respective hospitals' service areas based on county regions and the communities we serve. There is a special effort to include individuals with health disparities and organizations who serve these communities in the CHNA process. The CHNA includes the analysis of primary and secondary data. Multi-year analyses, trends and projections are developed, which identify areas of need for the continuum of health care services. Primary data is obtained through a combination of qualitative analysis of community-based organization (CBO), informant interviews and surveys, individual community member surveys, and participation in collaborative partner meetings. These meetings include representatives from the Departments of Health, CBOs, academic institutions, government agencies, and hospitals. Ongoing input concerning our communities' needs is also obtained through: our Board of Trustees/Directors who are all area residents and leaders in their respective communities; facility based advisory boards and councils, and; the feedback received by our facility administrators and clinicians that serve on local community agency boards. Secondary data analysis includes: internal hospital data, including Prevention Quality Indicators (PQI); Department of Health Community Health Assessments; local regional NYS Prevention Agenda data sources; and Statewide Planning and Research System (SPARCS) data. The Committee on Community Health, a committee of the Board of Trustees, provides recommendations that concern Northwell's community health priorities and interventions based on the CHNA. Committee discussions focus on New York State (NYS) Prevention Agenda Priority Areas, including strategies and intervention outcomes related to chronic disease prevention, women and children's health, healthy safe environments, health access, mental health and substance abuse, HIV/AIDS/STDs and community immunizations. Regional departments of health (I.E. Nassau County Department of Health, Suffolk County Department of Health Services, and NYC Department of Health and Mental Hygiene) perform additional community health assessments (CHA) with the input of hospital and community stakeholders. These regional partners use strategies such as community member surveys, CBO surveys, and public listening sessions to solicit information on community needs. Together with other healthcare organizations and CBOs, Northwell participates in meetings organized by these regional departments of health academic organizations to discuss the shared responsibility of public health planning within the NYS Prevention Agenda. These meetings provide an opportunity for general discussion regarding the public health goals of the NYS Prevention Agenda and the selection of shared priorities for collaborative regiona"

202021409349300727,370663567,"Schedule H, Part II Community Building Activities","Community Building activities are programs that address underlying causes of health problems and thus improve health status and quality of life. They focus on root causes of health problems such as poverty, homelessness, and environmental hazards. These activities enhance community assets by offering the expertise and resources of the health care organization. Workforce (non-hospital) development: Bridges Connections District 201 Bridges Connections District 201 is designed to help special needs students learn marketable skills through on the job training. Up to three students receive two hours of supervised job training for each day during the school year. Each student progresses through a three-phase program. Bridges enhances this high-risk population's ability to be productive members of our community. The Bridges program has successfully transitioned two students into part-time colleagues at St. Elizabeth's. Providing opportunities to special needs young adults builds one's confidence and encourages them to seek employment. Leadership Development: Leadership Belleville Partnerships with community business leaders is an important part of furthering positive perceptions of St. Elizabeth's as a healing and caring organization. One HSHS St. Elizabeth's leader participated in many community functions to further convey our message of commitment to Southwestern Illinois. Leadership Belleville is a 9-month commitment and unique training program for individuals who have demonstrated high leadership qualities. HSHS St. Elizabeth's is committed to this program on an annual basis by hosting an event at the hospital and ensuring one leader is actively involved each year. Coalition Building: BASIC Initiative (Belleville Achieves Strength in Character) BASIC is a partnership of schools, the City of Belleville, and the business community to strengthen character in our youth and in the community. BASIC encourages youth and adults to be productive citizens in our community. The BASIC initiative is very active in the schools and builds a child's spirit of self-worth and value. HSHS St. Elizabeth's is an active board member of this organization. Annually, students and adults are recognized for service to the community, emphasizing the value of each awardee from all walks of life. Coalition Building: St. Clair County Health Commission St. Elizabeth's Hospital initiated practices that later became part of the health department when they formed in 1985. A member of St. Elizabeth's participates in the Health Care Commission. The Health Care Commission, founded in 1991, is a 20 plus member organization that serves as a public health system to establish priority health issues, mobilize resources to meet identified needs, and promote the health and well-being of the all-county residents. As a result of the policy summit in spring of 2017, a collective impact movement is now underway to address specific health issues in the county. Community Support: Emergency Management and Disaster Preparedness- St. Elizabeth's is a community leader for emergency management. Our EMS coordinator is on the advisory council for two counties and is certified by the National Incident Management System (NIMS) and Incident Command Structure (ICS). In conjunction with our sister hospital, St. Anthony Memorial Hospital in Effingham, he taught 84 students NIMS and ICS. However, it is his involvement in the Local Emergency Planning Committees (LEPC) that integrates and prepares St. Elizabeth's to respond effectively in a disaster. Three HSHS St. Elizabeth's colleagues trained in emergency management served as instructors and evaluators at a local full scale railroad derailment mass casualty exercise and a full scale active shooter exercise. In addition, St. Elizabeth's is now the St. Clair County EMS resource hospital. The EMS team provides local support for world events such as the 2017 eclipse, as well as Songs for Soldiers and the Belleville Marathon. Community Support: Pregnancy Care Center The hospital provides space for the Pregnancy Care Center (PCC) on the hospital campus. The PCC provides free services including pregnancy tests, referrals for medical care, WIC and other resource information; the hospital supports these efforts. In addition, the PCC provides clothing and supplies to those with financial needs. Due to the recent move of the hospital, the PCC moved into a renovated space that creates a warm and welcoming environment for their clients. The Mother Child Department collects items for the PCC and annually a community baby shower is held to obtain donations for the center; often colleagues give generously to this organization. Community Support: Social Agency Donations Food, hygiene products, and school supply drives were conducted in collaboration with local social agencies such as St Vincent DePaul, Catholic Urban Programs, the Violence Prevention Center. Seventy-six school back packs stuffed with school supplies were donated to colleagues' students in need and an additional 75 pounds were donated to the Violence Prevention Center, a women's shelter. HSHS St. Elizabeth's partners with the local blood services and provides a location for blood donation and contributes to incentives to encourage colleagues and the public to participate. A colleague also serves on the board for the Center of Autism. St. Elizabeth's has a positive long standing relationship with St. Vincent DePaul (SVDP) in East St. Louis. The building that houses Cosgrove's Soup Kitchen and a thrift store underwent a complete remodel, and needed many items. Through careful planning and inventorying of resources at the old facility and after the move, HSHS St. Elizabeth's facilitated the donation of numerous items needed for the renovation, thus reducing St. Vincent DePaul's overhead costs. The hospital also donated canned and frozen food, metal rolling racks, kitchen supplies, and paper products. With the hospital move from Belleville to O'Fallon, some equipment was either obsolete or incompatible with the new technology at the new hospital. This surplus allowed for generous donations to the community and HSHS Mission Outreach, our regional medical surplus partner. Mission Outreach received their largest donation ever from St. Elizabeth's Hospital. In addition, many local agencies benefited and obtained items that would either improve their work or make life more comfortable. Such agencies included the local health department, a high school, a priest retirement home and a low-income school. Community Health improvement and advocacy: Behavioral Health Care HSHS St. Elizabeth's is a member of the Metro-East Behavioral Health Network Council. This is a group of agencies within our community that share resources and implement new treatment strategies for our patients with psychiatric needs. Even though St. Elizabeth's does not have mental health services, it is aligned with area facilities and specialists that accommodate our patient population. To facilitate the care of mental health patients a mental health nurse practitioner is on staff to assess the needs of this patient population. Athletes Advantage Sports Medicine HSHS Athletes Advantage Sports Medicine provides certified athletic trainers to local schools. Although the program has been in effect for 15 years, HSHS St. Elizabeth's joined forces in 2017 by providing resources to two area high schools. The commitment to provide on-site, quality medical care to local athletes was and continues to be our goal. With the addition of the ImPACT Concussion program in 2015, Athletics Advantage provides baselines free of charge to partner schools. The Athletes Advantage team consists of certified athletic trainers, board-certified sports medicine physicians with over 30 years of combined experience and credentialed ImPACT consultants, board-certified orthopedic surgeons with specialties in sports medicine and fracture care, and licensed physical therapists with emphasis on rehabilitating sports injuries. they work in conjunction with the certified athletic trainers to ensure a comprehensive rehabilitation and timely return to activity. Community Building activities also included attending the Illinois Hospital Association Advocacy Day where staff and other local health care organizations met our legislators to discuss health care legislation."
202021409349300727,370663567,"Schedule H, Part III, Line 2 Bad debt expense - methodology used to estimate amount","Self-pay patients are screened for verification of no insurance coverage. Once verification of no coverage has been completed, the guarantors will be screened for charity or uninsured discounts based on income levels. Those guarantors who do not qualify for charity through the screening process will be asked to provide proof of income in the form of a recent pay stub and/or recent tax return to determine the level of uninsured discounting. If no proof of income is provided or a guarantor's income is greater than 201% of the federal poverty level, the appropriate discount according to the established criteria up to 600% of the federal poverty level will be applied. The amount of money not collected from those self-pay patients who are not eligible for charity care is reported as bad debt. Allowances for Doubtful Accounts have been recorded based on an historical matrix, using collectability percentages by payor and aging category in accordance with HSHS Executive Policy #F-23, Valuation of Net Accounts Receivable. Percentages are based on historical experience at the hospital and adjusted for known limitations. The Hospital reports bad debt in accordance with Generally Accepted Accounting Principles (GAAP)."
202021409349300727,370663567,"Schedule H, Part III, Line 3 Bad Debt Expense Methodology","The hospital strongly believes that its charity care, and the related community benefit obtained from such care, is understated because of those patients who potentially qualify for charity care but do not wish to apply for it. In addition, some care is not classified as charity because of missing documentation on patient resources. Thus, the hospital's bad debt includes a portion that could be classified as charity care if application for such care was sought and/or completed. While the hospital feels their bad debt expense includes amounts attributable to patients who would qualify for financial assistance under the hospital's financial assistance policy, the hospital is unable to estimate this amount."
202021409349300727,370663567,"Schedule H, Part III, Line 4 Bad debt expense - financial statement footnote",The text of the footnote to the organization's financial statements that describes bad debt expense can be found on page 19 of the HSHS Consolidated Audit Report. Please also reference Footnote 2Q on page 14 for an explanation of how the financials account for bad debt.
202021409349300727,370663567,"Schedule H, Part III, Line 8 Community benefit & methodology for determining medicare costs","HSHS St. Elizabeth's Hospital continually strives to provide excellent patient care in the most cost effective fashion. Nonetheless, the Medicare program, in many cases, does not provide payment that covers the full cost of the care provided. Since it is the mission of the hospital to respond to community need, hospital management continually advocates for improved Medicare payment so that the cost of quality care to those patients who are not able to afford it is not compromised and is fairly subsidized by all payers. While this shortfall in Medicare payments is not classified as community benefit by the IRS, we nonetheless believe it is an important contribution made by the hospital to the health and well-being of the community. If the Medicare program did not exist, many Medicare patients would be eligible for charity care or other means-tested government programs. Further, by absorbing this payment shortfall and providing care below cost to these individuals, HSHS St. Elizabeth's is relieving the burdens of the government. Accordingly, this shortfall restricts HSHS St. Elizabeth's ability to make funds available to provide for charity care and other community benefits. The hospital Medicare shortfall at cost for fiscal year 2019 was $8,480,945."
202021409349300727,370663567,"Schedule H, Part III, Line 9b Collection practices for patients eligible for financial assistance","Every effort is made prior to, during and after provision of medical services to determine whether a patient is eligible for charity/community care and to assist the patient in completing the application and provide adequate documentation. If the patient qualified for charity/community care for the full balance of their account, the entire amount is written off to charity/community care and hence no debt collection is pursued. If the patient qualified for charity/community care for a portion of their account balance, that portion is written off to charity/community care, with the patient being responsible for the remainder of the balance. Additionally, reasonable effort will be made to obtain third-party or government payer reimbursement on behalf of the patient. If those efforts are not fruitful, an offer will be extended to the patient to make installment payments on their balance. Only at such point that the patient defaults on installment payments or refuses to cooperate with the hospital's efforts to be reimbursed will the account be sent to collections. The hospital will make reasonable efforts to determine whether a patient is eligible under the financial assistance policy before it engages in an ECA. To the extent a patient is determined to be eligible for financial assistance under the FAP, the hospital will take all reasonably available measures to reverse any ECA taken against the patient to obtain payment for the care."

Having this presence in the underserved community and having leaders committed to a variety of different community groups, the leaders hear about opportunities that allow the hospital to connect more effectively. Due to this participation one leader serves on the steering committee of a nonprofit that serves low income areas. Because of our presence in the community, HSHS St. Elizabeth's is approached and asked to provide care, education or resources to underserved areas. The hospital also continually assesses the needs of the community through pre- and post-evaluations, patient surveys, the Hospital Advisory Council, and Patient Family Advisory Council. In addition, colleagues who participate in community events complete a survey about their experience. The survey includes a place to add community connections and suggestions from other agencies who may ask us to participate in other events. The community can also visit the hospital's website and submit a request for hospital participation. The Community Benefit/Hospital Advisory Council meets quarterly and discusses opportunities to community involvement. HSHS St. Elizabeth's is often approached to assist and provide medical assistance for events. For example, the hospital provides the medical care for the annual Belleville Marathon and financially supports EMS for services during public community festivities. Whenever the hospital hosts community education events, evaluations include suggestions for additional education or services."
202021409349300727,370663567,"Schedule H, Part VI, Line 3 Patient education of eligibility for assistance","HSHS St. Elizabeth's Hospital collaborates with our physician partners and financial assistance information is available in the Medical Group offices. Financial Assistance posters are displayed in the registration and the Emergency Department waiting areas. During the registration process, a patient may request a financial assistance program brochure and application which are readily available. This packet contains a letter identifying financial assistance opportunities offered to our patients as well as a financial assistance application. Information about the hospital's financial assistance policy is easily accessible on our website. The hospital has onsite advocates to assist patients with enrollment in several federal, state and local government programs. These advocates visit patients while in the hospital or contact them by phone once discharged. The advocates will also make home visits as needed in order to assist patient with enrollment as well as gathering necessary documents for application. If the patient is not eligible, the advocates refer them to our financial assistance program and they follow-up with the patients. HSHS St. Elizabeth's Hospital makes its financial assistance program brochure, application and standard response letters available in Spanish, as well as English. Financial Assistance Program information is also available in English and Spanish on the hospital's website. Each billing statement that a patient receives contains information about our financial assistance program and a phone number and email for assistance with applying. Any patient visiting the onsite financial counselor, as well as contacting the hospital via phone, is given information about payment options including our financial assistance program options. Even after an account is sent to a collection agency, but no later than 12 months from placement, and/or anytime in the process they believe a patient may be eligible for Financial Assistance, the account is returned to the hospital for evaluation. Patients are also provided a Fair Billing Act notification at the point of registration regarding separate physician billing they can expect to receive, plus information about the patient's financial responsibility if their insurance plan is out of network. A system called PayNav through Passport is used on self-pay patients after failed attempts made by the hospital, but before sending to a collection agency. That system accesses credit and other information and allows us to see the probability of a patient being able to pay their bill. After assessing that information, the hospital determines whether to grant financial assistance or continue collection efforts."
202021409349300727,370663567,"Schedule H, Part VI, Line 4 Community information","HSHS St. Elizabeth's provides services for patients in four counties (St. Clair, Clinton, Madison, and Monroe counties), a total population of more than 600,000 residents. The FY2018 CHNA, however, focused on St. Clair County which has an approximate population of 262,000 which is slightly smaller than Madison County by 3,000 residents. It is the eighth most populous county in the state, however, both counties saw a decrease in population. St. Clair County lost approximately 3% of their residents. Clinton and Monroe counties have a population of 37,00 and 33,000 respectively and are considered rural counties. Belleville, the county seat for St. Clair County, has roughly 44,000 residents. St. Clair County is the oldest county in Illinois and its western border is formed by the Mississippi River and comprises 674 square miles and includes urban, suburban and rural areas. As an organization, HSHS St. Elizabeth's does not exclude Medically Underserved Areas (MUAs), low income or minority populations from its service area. Although the population is aging, the average age is 37.8 years old. The greatest shift in population occurred in the 65 years and older with an increase of 16.8% from the 2010 census. The younger population ages 18-64 and under 5 years of age showed a decline in population of 6% and 7% respectfully. The population consists mostly of white (62.1%) and African American (30.4%). All races and ethnicities increased except white (non-Hispanics). The Hispanic and Latino population showed a significant growth in six years with 29% increase in population. Native American group grew by 50%, however, overall the makeup is only 0.3% of the population. Along with the aging population comes increased health care costs. Chronic disease studies show that the health of the aging population can be maintained, and chronic disease reduced by promoting healthy behaviors and expanding preventive health services. The average income is $50,006 in St. Clair county. Although it went up it remains the lowest of the four counties in the service area. St. Clair county also suffers from a high rate of poverty with 18.23% living at 100% below the federal poverty line and 35% living at 200% below the federal poverty line. This is a 1% increase from the last CHNA. This indicator is relevant because poverty creates barriers to access health services, nutritional food and other necessities that contribute to poor health status. Of the four counties included in the St. Elizabeth's service area, all have a lower uninsured rate than the state. However, St. Clair County has a higher rate of uninsured children, a lower percentage of privately insured residents and a higher rate of publicly insured residents when compared to the state rate. In St. Clair county 9.2% of the population is uninsured. Of those who are insured 36.8% are publicly insured which is higher than the state average of 31%. Violent crime is defined as offenses involving face to-face confrontation (e.g. assault, rape, robbery) The crime rate in the St. Elizabeth's service area is significantly higher and almost doubling the state rate:749 to 397 per 100,000. Crime impacts health because it limits interaction with others, prevents children from playing outdoors, lacks community organization and creates chronic stress, thus having a negative impact on health and health outcomes. Four hospitals serve the local community; one hospital in Belleville, the county seat for St. Clair County, has a satellite hospital in the community where St. Elizabeth's resides. In 2017 St. Elizabeth's built and moved into its replacement hospital in O'Fallon to meet and address the needs of the larger community and provide a higher level of care with the support of advanced technology. The aging facility in Belleville could no longer meet the needs of the area.

Founded in 1875 the hospital brings a healing presence and improves the health of our community, especially those persons who are sick, poor, and disadvantaged. Because of the hospital's mission and heritage, the hospital is dedicated to promoting the health of St. Clair County and surrounding areas. The hospital is governed by a Board of Directors, most of whom reside in the hospital's primary service area and who are neither employees nor independent contractors of the hospital (nor family members thereof). The Board ensures that HSHS St. Elizabeth's is responding to community need. In FY2019, for example, the board reviewed and approved the many Community Benefits activities that transpire in the community. Monthly they are updated on the events that happen in the community and are kept abreast of the collective impact process happening throughout the county called Healthier Together. In addition, the Hospital Advisory/Community Benefit Committee expanded membership to complement the CHNA priority needs. Along with this committee, the Foundation and our volunteer auxiliary group advocate on behalf of the hospital in the community. Consistent with its exempt purpose, HSHS St. Elizabeth's has an open medical staff with privileges available to all qualified physicians in the area. The hospital also operates an emergency department that is open 24 hours to all persons regardless of their ability to pay. As a not-for-profit hospital, HSHS St. Elizabeth's reinvests surplus funds to support the mission of the organization and promote the health of the community rather than distributing surplus funds as profits to shareholders or individuals. Funds not committed to ongoing operations are generally used to upgrade facilities, secure new technologies, improve patient care, and support initiatives designed to promote health and ensure access for all. HSHS St. Elizabeth's is a strong supporter of education and provides mentoring to individuals in the clinical disciplines as well those outside of the clinical setting. In conjunction with St. Louis University, Southern Illinois Health Foundation (FQHC), and Scott Air Force Base, the hospital supports a three-year Family Practice Residency. Other disciplines that receive on site education and mentoring include nursing, pharmacy, pharmacy informatics, respiratory, radiology, occupational, physical, and speech therapies, and phlebotomy. Nonclinical education includes administrative secretary, medical records, and Master of Health Administration. HSHS St. Elizabeth's, HSHS Medical Group, Prairie Cardiovascular Consultants, and both the St. Clair and Madison County Medical Societies offer a ""Call M.E. Doctor"" Medical Explorers program for high school seniors who are interested in the medical profession. The overall goal of the program is to address the doctor crisis in the United States. The program consisted of three Saturday sessions for the students and featured hands-on activities and presentations from physicians in different clinical areas such as emergency medicine, cardiology, and orthopedic surgery. This event occurs twice a year with a variety of local high school students. HSHS St. Elizabeth's is a community leader for emergency management. The EMS coordinator is on the Advisory Council for two counties and is a certified National Incident Management System (NIMS) and Incident Command Structure (ICS) instructor. He trains St. Elizabeth's colleagues and provides NIMS training to the community. It is his involvement in the Local Emergency Planning Committees (LEPC) that integrates and prepares St. Elizabeth's to respond effectively in a disaster. For example, St. Elizabeth's participated in an active shooter exercise with many community partners in an industrial area. St. Elizabeth's colleagues served as evaluator and as a controller. The exercise focused on pre-hospital care of victims, and the responders were evaluated against FEMA standards and care. HSHS St. Elizabeth's gained knowledge and expertise with these exercises and developed relationships with other agencies. To ensure the community receives cardiac standard of care, HSHS St. Elizabeth's educates community physicians, Scott Air Force Base medical personnel, and community members on a variety of American Heart association classes such as Hands-Only CPR, Advanced Cardiac Life Support (ACLS), Pediatric Advanced Life Support (PALS), and Neonatal resuscitation (NRP) courses. Annually, HSHS St. Elizabeth's Hospital works to enhance community awareness and connect with the community to educate and raise awareness of the importance of breast and cardiac health. In FY2019 the hospital partnered with local businesses and invited the community to participate in two breast health awareness events. In February the community attended a heart health screening and educational program where citizens learned Hands-only CPR, completed glucose and cholesterol screens and learned about cardiac health and innovative heart care procedures. HSHS St. Elizabeth's continues to provide a meal and a health care topic for seniors on fixed incomes every month. Seniors value the meal and the information. It creates social interaction among the group and reduces isolation. HSHS St. Elizabeth's routinely makes cash and in-kind donations to various social and educational agencies. For example, conference room space is donated to a variety of organizations that are aligned with our mission and principles. An example of such space includes providing meeting space for support groups such as Naranon, blood drives, and housing the county morgue. HSHS St. Elizabeth's donates printing services and office supplies for two small local non-profit organizations. HSHS St. Elizabeth's continues to provide space for the Pregnancy Care Center that offers free services to mothers and babies. The hospital provides flu vaccines to members in the community who are homeless or who are served by the soup kitchen. Hearing screens are offered to children in underserved areas. HSHS St. Elizabeth's provides the medical oversight for local emergency services. Recently receiving our EMS Resource Hospital designation through the Illinois Department of Public Health, we incurred the personnel and fiscal responsibility of EMS oversight for O'Fallon EMS's protection district, Washington County ambulance service, and several other rural services that benefit the care and transport of the sick and injured. Included in this responsibility is outreach education related to general health care, emergent decision-making, and accident prevention such as Stop the Bleed and Narcan training education. HSHS St. Elizabeth's also devotes significant resources to access for patients who cannot afford care, along with other Community Benefits. In FY 2019, HSHS St. Elizabeth's provided more than $16.9 million in Community Benefits, including financial assistance at cost, unpaid cost of Medicaid and other public programs, and a range of diverse programs designed to enhance access and improve community health. Additionally, in FY 2019 HSHS St Elizabeth's provided $917,329 (at cost) in uncompensated care to patients who did not quality for charity care or public assistance and more than $8.4 million (at cost) in excess of Medicare payment for health care services. HSHS St. Elizabeth's Hospital provides a range of Community Benefit initiatives and programs that further our mission and long-standing commitment to our community. In many cases, these Community Benefits would not exist without the leadership role played by HSHS St. Elizabeth's and they often relieve a burden that would otherwise be carried by government."
202021409349300727,370663567,"Schedule H, Part VI, Line 6 Affiliated health care system","Headquartered in Springfield, Illinois, Hospital Sisters Health System (HSHS) is a highly integrated, multi-institutional health care system comprised of 15 hospitals and more than 200 physician practice sites in Illinois and Wisconsin. HSHS is sponsored by Hospital Sisters Ministries (HSM), which is a public juridic person of the Roman Catholic Church. HSHS continues the health care ministries begun by its founders, the Hospital Sisters of St. Francis, more than 140 years ago, in rural and midsized communities throughout Illinois and Wisconsin. HSHS provides compassionate, holistic, high quality, and cost-effective health care through its acute care hospitals, physician practices, home health programs, palliative and hospice programs, and community outreach services. In addition, HSHS affiliated hospitals include critical access facilities that offer essential health services that otherwise would not be available in many communities. Our mission calls us to reveal and embody Christ's healing love for all people, and we extend our high quality Franciscan health care ministry beyond the walls of our hospitals by providing community health improvement services with special emphasis on the poor and vulnerable. In addition to providing community health improvement services to the broader community, HSHS cares for everyone who comes to its facilities, regardless of their ability to pay. In tandem with a variety of cross sector community partners, HSHS's Community Benefit initiatives are strategically planned and professionally implemented to improve access to health care services; enhance the health of the community; advance medical or general health care knowledge; and relieve or reduce the burden of government to improve health. In FY2019, HSHS collectively provided $211.7 million in Community Benefit (9.2% of total hospital expenses). This amount included $27.7 million provided for Financial Assistance (a.k.a. Charity Care) and $142.3 million for unreimbursed care provided as part of the Medicaid program. In addition, HSHS hospitals committed significant resources to treat Medicare patients. The cost of providing services to primarily elderly beneficiaries of the Medicare program - in excess of governmental and managed care contract payments - was $279.9 million. HSHS hospitals also recorded $41.1 million in uncollectible accounts. While HSHS does not count the latter two amounts as Community Benefit, they nonetheless reflect our commitment to serving all persons in need of care. In addition to the dollars invested in our Community Benefit programs, HSHS continues to reinvest any surplus revenue from operations and investments into new medical technology, facility infrastructure and health care services in our communities. By doing so, we ensure our ability to meet the ongoing demand for high quality, efficient and easily accessible health care."

202042409349301469,210634484,"SCHEDULE H, PART III, SECTION B; QUESTION 8","MEDICARE COSTS WERE DERIVED FROM THE 2019 MEDICARE COST REPORT. THE ORGANIZATION FEELS THAT MEDICARE UNDERPAYMENTS (SHORTFALL), BAD DEBT AND ASSOCIATED COSTS ARE COMMUNITY BENEFIT AND ARE INCLUDABLE ON THE FORM 990, SCHEDULE H, PART I. AS OUTLINED MORE FULLY BELOW, THE ORGANIZATION BELIEVES THAT THESE SERVICES AND RELATED COSTS PROMOTE THE HEALTH OF THE COMMUNITY AS A WHOLE AND ARE RENDERED IN CONJUNCTION WITH THE ORGANIZATION'S CHARITABLE TAX-EXEMPT PURPOSES AND MISSION IN PROVIDING MEDICALLY NECESSARY HEALTHCARE SERVICES TO ALL INDIVIDUALS IN A NON-DISCRIMINATORY MANNER WITHOUT REGARD TO RACE, COLOR, CREED, SEX, NATIONAL ORIGIN OR ABILITY TO PAY AND CONSISTENT WITH THE COMMUNITY BENEFIT STANDARD PROMULGATED BY THE IRS. THE COMMUNITY BENEFIT STANDARD IS THE CURRENT STANDARD FOR A HOSPITAL FOR RECOGNITION AS A TAX-EXEMPT AND CHARITABLE ORGANIZATION UNDER INTERNAL REVENUE CODE (""IRC"") 501(C)(3). THE ORGANIZATION IS RECOGNIZED AS A TAX-EXEMPT ENTITY AND CHARITABLE ORGANIZATION UNDER 501(C)(3) OF THE IRC. ALTHOUGH THERE IS NO DEFINITION IN THE TAX CODE FOR THE TERM ""CHARITABLE"" A REGULATION PROMULGATED BY THE DEPARTMENT OF THE TREASURY PROVIDES SOME GUIDANCE AND STATES THAT ""THE TERM CHARITABLE IS USED IN SECTION 501(C)(3) IN ITS GENERALLY ACCEPTED LEGAL SENSE,PROVIDES EXAMPLES OF CHARITABLE PURPOSES, INCLUDING THE RELIEF OF THE POOR OR UNPRIVILEGED; THE PROMOTION OF SOCIAL WELFARE; AND THE ADVANCEMENT OF EDUCATION, RELIGION, AND SCIENCE. NOTE IT DOES NOT EXPLICITLY ADDRESS THE ACTIVITIES OF HOSPITALS. IN THE ABSENCE OF EXPLICIT STATUTORY OR REGULATORY REQUIREMENTS APPLYING THE TERM ""CHARITABLE"" TO HOSPITALS, IT HAS BEEN LEFT TO THE IRS TO DETERMINE THE CRITERIA HOSPITALS MUST MEET TO QUALIFY AS IRC 501(C)(3) CHARITABLE ORGANIZATIONS. THE ORIGINAL STANDARD WAS KNOWN AS THE CHARITY CARE STANDARD. THIS STANDARD WAS REPLACED BY THE IRS WITH THE COMMUNITY BENEFIT STANDARD WHICH IS THE CURRENT STANDARD. CHARITY CARE STANDARD IN 1956, THE IRS ISSUED REVENUE RULING 56-185, WHICH ADDRESSED THE REQUIREMENTS HOSPITALS NEEDED TO MEET IN ORDER TO QUALIFY FOR IRC 501(C)(3) STATUS. ONE OF THESE REQUIREMENTS IS KNOWN AS THE ""CHARITY CARE STANDARD."" UNDER THE STANDARD, A HOSPITAL MUST PROVIDE, TO THE EXTENT OF ITS FINANCIAL ABILITY, FREE OR REDUCED-COST CARE TO PATIENTS WHO CANNOT PAY FOR SUCH SERVICES. A HOSPITAL THAT EXPECTED FULL PAYMENT DID NOT, ACCORDING TO THE RULING, PROVIDE CHARITY CARE BASED ON THE FACT THAT SOME PATIENTS ULTIMATELY FAILED TO PAY. THE RULING EMPHASIZED THAT A LOW LEVEL OF CHARITY CARE DID NOT NECESSARILY MEAN THAT A HOSPITAL HAD FAILED TO MEET THE REQUIREMENT SINCE THAT LEVEL COULD REFLECT ITS FINANCIAL ABILITY TO PROVIDE SUCH CARE. THE RULING ALSO NOTED THAT PUBLICLY SUPPORTED COMMUNITY HOSPITALS WOULD NORMALLY QUALIFY AS CHARITABLE ORGANIZATIONS BECAUSE THEY SERVE THE ENTIRE COMMUNITY AND A LOW LEVEL OF CHARITY CARE WOULD NOT AFFECT A HOSPITAL'S EXEMPT STATUS IF IT WAS DUE TO THE SURROUNDING COMMUNITY'S LACK OF CHARITABLE DEMANDS. COMMUNITY BENEFIT STANDARD IN 1969, THE IRS ISSUED REVENUE RULING 69-545, WHICH ""REMOVED"" FROM REVENUE RULING 56-185 ""THE REQUIREMENTS RELATING TO CARING FOR PATIENTS WITHOUT CHARGE OR AT RATES BELOW COST."" UNDER THE STANDARD DEVELOPED IN REVENUE RULING 69-545, WHICH IS KNOWN AS THE ""COMMUNITY BENEFIT STANDARD,"" HOSPITALS ARE JUDGED ON WHETHER THEY PROMOTE THE HEALTH OF A BROAD CLASS OF INDIVIDUALS IN THE COMMUNITY. THE RULING INVOLVED A HOSPITAL THAT ONLY ADMITTED INDIVIDUALS WHO COULD PAY FOR THE SERVICES (BY THEMSELVES, PRIVATE INSURANCE, OR PUBLIC PROGRAMS SUCH AS MEDICARE), BUT OPERATED A FULL-TIME EMERGENCY ROOM THAT WAS OPEN TO EVERYONE. THE IRS RULED THAT THE HOSPITAL QUALIFIED AS A CHARITABLE ORGANIZATION BECAUSE IT PROMOTED THE HEALTH OF PEOPLE IN ITS COMMUNITY. THE IRS REASONED THAT BECAUSE THE PROMOTION OF HEALTH WAS A CHARITABLE PURPOSE ACCORDING TO THE GENERAL LAW OF CHARITY, IT FELL WITHIN THE ""GENERALLY ACCEPTED LEGAL SENSE"" OF THE TERM ""CHARITABLE,"" AS REQUIRED BY THE DEPARTMENT OF TREASURY REG. 1.501(C)(3)-1(D)(2). THE IRS RULING STATED THAT THE PROMOTION OF HEALTH, LIKE THE RELIEF OF POVERTY AND THE ADVANCEMENT OF EDUCATION AND RELIGION, IS ONE OF THE PURPOSES IN THE GENERAL LAW OF CHARITY THAT IS DEEMED BENEFICIAL TO THE COMMUNITY AS A WHOLE EVEN THOUGH THE CLASS OF BENEFICIARIES ELIGIBLE TO RECEIVE A DIRECT BENEFIT FROM ITS ACTIVITIES DOES NOT INCLUDE ALL MEMBERS OF THE COMMUNITY, SUCH AS INDIGENT MEMBERS OF THE COMMUNITY, PROVIDED THAT THE CLASS IS NOT SO SMALL THAT ITS RELIEF IS NOT OF BENEFIT TO THE COMMUNITY. THE IRS CONCLUDED THAT THE HOSPITAL WAS ""PROMOTING THE HEALTH OF A CLASS OF PERSONS THAT IS BROAD ENOUGH TO BENEFIT THE COMMUNITY"" BECAUSE ITS EMERGENCY ROOM WAS OPEN TO ALL AND IT PROVIDED CARE TO EVERYONE WHO COULD PAY, WHETHER DIRECTLY OR THROUGH THIRD-PARTY REIMBURSEMENT. OTHER CHARACTERISTICS OF THE HOSPITAL THAT THE IRS HIGHLIGHTED INCLUDED THE FOLLOWING: ITS SURPLUS FUNDS WERE USED TO IMPROVE PATIENT CARE, EXPAND HOSPITAL FACILITIES, AND ADVANCE MEDICAL TRAINING, EDUCATION AND RESEARCH; IT WAS CONTROLLED BY A BOARD OF TRUSTEES THAT CONSISTED OF INDEPENDENT CIVIC LEADERS; AND HOSPITAL MEDICAL STAFF PRIVILEGES WERE AVAILABLE TO ALL QUALIFIED PHYSICIANS. THE AMERICAN HOSPITAL ASSOCIATION (""AHA"") FEELS THAT MEDICARE UNDERPAYMENTS (SHORTFALL) AND BAD DEBT ARE COMMUNITY BENEFIT AND THUS INCLUDABLE ON THE FORM 990, SCHEDULE H, PART I. THIS ORGANIZATION AGREES WITH THE AHA'S POSITION. AS OUTLINED IN THE AHA'S LETTER TO THE IRS DATED AUGUST 21, 2007 WITH RESPECT TO THE FIRST PUBLISHED DRAFT OF THE NEW FORM 990 AND SCHEDULE H, THE AHA FELT THAT THE IRS SHOULD INCORPORATE THE FULL VALUE OF THE COMMUNITY BENEFIT THAT HOSPITALS PROVIDE BY COUNTING MEDICARE UNDERPAYMENTS (SHORTFALL) AS QUANTIFIABLE COMMUNITY BENEFIT FOR THE FOLLOWING REASONS: - PROVIDING CARE FOR THE ELDERLY AND SERVING MEDICARE PATIENTS IS AN ESSENTIAL PART OF THE COMMUNITY BENEFIT STANDARD - MEDICARE, LIKE MEDICAID, DOES NOT PAY THE FULL COST OF CARE. FROM THE LATEST DATA PROVIDED BY THE AHA, AS OF 2017, MEDICARE REIMBURSES HOSPITALS ONLY 87 CENTS FOR EVERY DOLLAR THEY SPEND TO TAKE CARE OF MEDICARE PATIENTS. - MANY MEDICARE BENEFICIARIES, LIKE THEIR MEDICAID COUNTERPARTS, ARE POOR. MORE THAN 42 PERCENT OF MEDICARE SPENDING IS FOR BENEFICIARIES WHOSE INCOME IS BELOW 200 PERCENT OF THE FEDERAL POVERTY LEVEL. MANY OF THOSE MEDICARE BENEFICIARIES ARE ALSO ELIGIBLE FOR MEDICAID -- SO CALLED ELIGIBLE."" THERE IS EVERY COMPELLING PUBLIC POLICY REASON TO TREAT MEDICARE AND MEDICAID UNDERPAYMENTS SIMILARLY FOR PURPOSES OF A HOSPITAL'S COMMUNITY BENEFIT AND INCLUDE THESE COSTS ON FORM 990, SCHEDULE H, PART I. MEDICARE UNDERPAYMENT MUST BE SHOULDERED BY THE HOSPITAL IN ORDER TO CONTINUE TREATING THE COMMUNITY'S ELDERLY AND POOR. THESE UNDERPAYMENTS REPRESENT A REAL COST OF SERVING THE COMMUNITY AND SHOULD COUNT AS A QUANTIFIABLE COMMUNITY BENEFIT. BOTH THE AHA AND THIS ORGANIZATION ALSO FEEL THAT PATIENT BAD DEBT IS A COMMUNITY BENEFIT AND THUS INCLUDABLE ON THE FORM 990, SCHEDULE H, PART I. LIKE MEDICARE UNDERPAYMENT (SHORTFALLS), THERE ALSO ARE COMPELLING REASONS THAT PATIENT BAD DEBT SHOULD BE COUNTED AS QUANTIFIABLE COMMUNITY BENEFIT AS FOLLOWS: - A SIGNIFICANT MAJORITY OF BAD DEBT IS ATTRIBUTABLE TO LOW-INCOME PATIENTS, WHO, FOR MANY REASONS, DECLINE TO COMPLETE THE FORMS REQUIRED TO ESTABLISH ELIGIBILITY FOR HOSPITALS' CHARITY CARE OR THOSE WHO DO NOT PAY ALL, OR A PORTION OF THE ALREADY DISCOUNTED BILLED AMOUNTS UNDER OUR FINANCIAL ASSISTANCE POLICY. A 2006 CONGRESSIONAL BUDGET OFFICE (""CBO"") REPORT, NONPROFIT HOSPITALS AND THE PROVISION OF COMMUNITY BENEFITS, CITED TWO STUDIES INDICATING THAT ""THE GREAT MAJORITY OF BAD DEBT WAS ATTRIBUTABLE TO PATIENTS WITH INCOMES BELOW 200% OF THE FEDERAL POVERTY LINE."" - THE REPORT ALSO NOTED THAT A SUBSTANTIAL PORTION OF BAD DEBT IS PENDING CHARITY CARE. UNLIKE BAD DEBT IN OTHER INDUSTRIES, HOSPITAL BAD DEBT IS COMPLICATED BY THE FACT THAT HOSPITALS FOLLOW THEIR MISSION TO THE COMMUNITY AND TREAT EVERY PATIENT THAT COMES THROUGH THEIR EMERGENCY DEPARTMENT, REGARDLESS OF ABILITY TO PAY. PATIENTS WHO HAVE OUTSTANDING BILLS ARE NOT TURNED AWAY, UNLIKE OTHER INDUSTRIES. BAD DEBT IS FURTHER COMPLICATED BY THE AUDITING INDUSTRY'S STANDARDS ON REPORTING CHARITY CARE. MANY PATIENTS CANNOT OR DO NOT PROVIDE THE NECESSARY, EXTENSIVE DOCUMENTATION REQUIRED TO BE DEEMED CHARITY CARE BY AUDITORS. AS A RESULT, ROUGHLY 40% OF BAD DEBT IS PENDING CHARITY CARE. THE CBO CONCLUDED THAT ITS FINDINGS ""SUPPORT THE VALIDITY OF THE USE OF UNCOMPENSATED CARE [BAD DEBT AND CHARITY CARE] AS A MEASURE OF COMMUNITY BENEFIT"" ASSUMING THE FINDINGS ARE GENERALIZABLE NATIONWIDE; THE EXPERIENCE OF HOSPITALS AROUND THE NATION REINFORCES THAT THEY ARE GENERALIZABLE. AS OUTLINED BY THE AHA, DESPITE THE HOSPITAL'S BEST EFFORTS AND DUE DILIGENCE, PATIENT BAD DEBT IS A PART OF THE HOSPITAL'S MISSION AND CHARITABLE PURPOSES. BAD DEBT REPRESENTS PART OF THE BURDEN HOSPITALS SHOULDER IN SERVING ALL"

A REPORT IN THE JOURNAL OF AMERICAN MEDICAL ASSOCIATION AND THE CENTER FOR DISEASE CONTROL (MCGINNIS, 1996) SUGGESTS THAT THE FACTORS IMPACTING HEALTH ARE AS FOLLOWS: LIFESTYLE AND BEHAVIORS, 50%, ENVIRONMENT (HUMAN AND NATURAL), 20%, GENETICS AND HUMAN BIOLOGY, 20%, AND HEALTH CARE, 10%.

THESE ACTIVITIES ARE ALMOST EXCLUSIVELY DONE IN SOME FORM OF PARTNERSHIP IN WHICH THE COMMUNITY OR OTHER ORGANIZATIONS ARE BETTER SUITED TO ADDRESS. HEALTH-CARE ORGANIZATIONS GENERALLY PROVIDE TIMELY AND SPECIFIC RESOURCES TO HELP THESE ISSUES.

THE PROJECT ALSO FULFILLS COMMONWEALTH ATTORNEY GENERAL'S OFFICE (AGO) AND FEDERAL INTERNAL REVENUE SERVICE (IRS) REGULATIONS THAT REQUIRE THAT NEBH ASSESS COMMUNITY HEALTH NEEDS, ENGAGE THE COMMUNITY, IDENTIFY PRIORITY HEALTH ISSUES AND CREATE A COMMUNITY HEALTH STRATEGY THAT DESCRIBES HOW NEBH, IN COLLABORATION WITH THE COMMUNITY AND LOCAL HEALTH DEPARTMENT, WILL ADDRESS THE NEEDS AND THE PRIORITIES IDENTIFIED BY THE CHNA.2019 COMMUNITY HEALTH NEEDS ASSESSMENT AND IMPLEMENTATION STRATEGY2019 COMMUNITY HEALTH NEEDS ASSESSMENTTARGETED GEOGRAPHY AND POPULATIONSAS NOTED ABOVE, NEBH COMPLETED ITS LAST ASSESSMENT IN SEPTEMBER 2019. THE GEOGRAPHICAL FOCUS OF THE SEPTEMBER 2019'S MOST RECENTLY COMPLETED CHNA ENCOMPASSES THE MISSION HILL AND ROXBURY NEIGHBORHOODS OF BOSTON, AS WELL AS THE CITIES OF DEDHAM, CHESTNUT HILL (NEWTON) AND BROOKLINE. THESE COMMUNITIES DEFINE NEBH'S COMMUNITY BENEFITS SERVICE AREA (CBSA). IN RECOGNITION OF THE CONSIDERABLE HEALTH DISPARITIES THAT EXIST IN SOME COMMUNITIES, NEBH FOCUSES THE BULK OF ITS COMMUNITY BENEFITS RESOURCES ON IMPROVING THE HEALTH STATUS OF LOW-INCOME AND UNDERSERVED POPULATIONS LIVING IN THE BOSTON NEIGHBORHOODS OF ROXBURY AND MISSION HILL. WHILE THERE ARE CERTAINLY SEGMENTS OF THE POPULATIONS IN BROOKLINE, CHESTNUT HILL, AND DEDHAM THAT ARE VULNERABLE AND UNDERSERVED, THE GREATEST DISPARITIES EXIST IN BOSTON. IN ORDER TO MAXIMIZE THE IMPACT OF ITS COMMUNITY BENEFITS RESOURCES, NEBH'S COMMUNITY BENEFITS ADVISORY COMMITTEE (CBAC) VOTED TO PRIORITIZE AND FOCUS NEBH'S ATTENTION ON THE MORE URBAN, HIGH-NEED COMMUNITIES IN NEBH'S CBSA.TARGET POPULATIONS FOR NEBH'S COMMUNITY BENEFITS INITIATIVES ARE IDENTIFIED THROUGH A COMMUNITY INPUT AND PLANNING PROCESS, COLLABORATIVE EFFORTS AND A CHNA THAT IS CONDUCTED EVERY THREE YEARS IN ACCORDANCE WITH THE REQUIREMENTS UNDER IRC SECTION 501(R).NEBH'S TARGET POPULATIONS FOCUS ON MEDICALLY UNDERSERVED AND VULNERABLE GROUPS, AS FOLLOWS: LOW- AND MODERATE-INCOME POPULATIONS OLDER ADULTS RACIALLY AND ETHNICALLY DIVERSE POPULATIONS/NON-ENGLISH SPEAKERS CHILDREN AND FAMILIESNEBH'S PROGRAMS MIRROR THE FIVE CORE PRINCIPLES OUTLINED BY THE PUBLIC HEALTH INSTITUTE IN TERMS OF THE ""EMPHASIS ON COMMUNITIES WITH DISPROPORTIONATE UNMET HEALTH-RELATED NEEDS; EMPHASIS ON PRIMARY PREVENTION; BUILDING A SEAMLESS CONTINUUM OF CARE; BUILDING COMMUNITY CAPACITY; AND COLLABORATIVE GOVERNANCE.""PROGRAMS DEVELOPED WILL AIM TO ADDRESS AND IMPROVE UPON THE FOLLOWING PRIORITY AREAS: SOCIAL DETERMINANTS OF HEALTH (INCLUDING POVERTY, FOOD INSECURITY, SAFETY AND VIOLENCE) CHRONIC DISEASE MANAGEMENT AND PREVENTION (INCLUDING PHYSICAL, BEHAVIORAL, AND EMOTIONAL RISK FACTORS AS WELL AS CHRONIC DISEASE MANAGEMENT) AND 2019 COMMUNITY HEALTH NEEDS ASSESSMENTSUMMARY OF APPROACH AND METHODSNEBH USED A PARTICIPATORY, COLLABORATIVE APPROACH TO BETTER UNDERSTAND AND ADDRESS THE HEALTH-RELATED NEEDS OF THOSE LIVING IN ITS SURROUNDING COMMUNITY.

QUANTITATIVE DATA FROM A BROAD RANGE OF SOURCES WAS COLLECTED AND ANALYZED TO CHARACTERIZE COMMUNITIES IN NEBH'S CBSA, MEASURE HEALTH STATUS, AND INFORM A COMPREHENSIVE UNDERSTANDING OF THE HEALTH-RELATED ISSUES. SOURCES INCLUDED: U.S. CENSUS BUREAU, AMERICAN COMMUNITY SURVEY 5-YEAR ESTIMATES (2013-2017) MASSACHUSETTS DEPARTMENT OF ELEMENTARY AND SECONDARY EDUCATION: SCHOOL AND DISTRICT PROFILES (2017 AND 2018-2019) FBI UNIFORM CRIME REPORTS (2017) MASSACHUSETTS DEPARTMENT OF PUBLIC HEALTH, REGISTRY OF VITAL RECORDS AND STATISTICS (2015) MASSACHUSETTS DEPARTMENT OF PUBLIC HEALTH, BUREAU OF SUBSTANCE ABUSE SERVICES (2017) MASSACHUSETTS DEPARTMENT OF PUBLIC HEALTH, ANNUAL REPORTS ON BIRTHS (2016) MASSACHUSETTS BUREAU OF INFECTIOUS DISEASE AND LABORATORY SCIENCES (2017) MASSACHUSETTS CENTER FOR HEALTH INFORMATION ANALYSIS (CHIA) HOSPITAL PROFILES (FY 2013-2017) MASSACHUSETTS HEALTHY AGING COLLABORATIVE, COMMUNITY PROFILES (2018) THE CHNA ALSO INCLUDED SOME MORE REFINED ANALYSIS OF HOSPITAL DISCHARGE DATA COMPILED BY THE MASSACHUSETTS CENTER FOR HEALTH INFORMATION AND ANALYSIS (CHIA).

THE GROUP REVIEWED PROGRESS TOWARD GOALS AND OBJECTIVES OF THE PRIOR THREE-YEAR PERIOD, AS WELL AS THE CURRENT DATA COLLECTED THROUGH THE CHNA, TO HELP ENVISION AND DEFINE PRIORITY AREAS FOR THE FUTURE. THE IMPLEMENTATION STRATEGY IDENTIFIED PRIORITY AREAS AND DEFINED GOALS, ALONG WITH OBJECTIVES FOR EACH GOAL AND DRAFTED STRATEGIES TO OPERATIONALIZE THESE OBJECTIVES. 2019 COMMUNITY HEALTH NEEDS ASSESSMENT PROCESSKEY FINDINGSTHE KEY PRIORITY POPULATIONS IDENTIFIED THROUGH THE CHNA CONDUCTED DURING THE PERIOD ENDED SEPTEMBER 30, 2019, WERE: CHILDREN AND FAMILIES OLDER ADULTS LOW TO MODERATE INCOME POPULATIONS RACIALLY/ETHNICALLY DIVERSE POPULATIONS, AND LIMITED-ENGLISH SPEAKERSTHE NEBH 2019 CHNA RESULTED IN KEY FINDINGS IN THE FOLLOWING AREAS: SOCIAL DETERMINANTS OF HEALTH CONTINUE TO HAVE A TREMENDOUS IMPACT ON MANY SEGMENTS OF THE POPULATION. THE DOMINANT THEME FROM THE ASSESSMENT'S KEY INFORMANT INTERVIEWS AND COMMUNITY FORUMS WAS THE CONTINUED IMPACT THAT THE UNDERLYING SOCIAL DETERMINANTS OF HEALTH ARE HAVING ON THE CBSA'S LOW-INCOME, UNDERSERVED, DIVERSE POPULATION COHORTS. MORE SPECIFICALLY, DETERMINANTS SUCH AS POVERTY, EMPLOYMENT OPPORTUNITIES, VIOLENCE, TRANSPORTATION, RACIAL SEGREGATION, LITERACY, PROVIDER LINGUISTIC/CULTURAL COMPETENCY, SOCIAL SUPPORT, AND COMMUNITY COHESION LIMIT MANY PEOPLE'S ABILITY TO CARE FOR THEIR OWN AND/OR THEIR FAMILIES' HEALTH. DISPARITIES IN HEALTH OUTCOMES EXIST IN NEBH'S CBSA BY RACE/ETHNICITY, FOREIGN BORN STATUS, INCOME AND LANGUAGE. THERE ARE MAJOR HEALTH DISPARITIES FOR RESIDENTS LIVING IN NEBH'S CBSA. THIS IS PARTICULARLY TRUE FOR RACIALLY/ETHNICALLY DIVERSE, FOREIGN BORN, LOW-INCOME, AND NON-ENGLISH SPEAKING RESIDENTS LIVING IN THE BOSTON NEIGHBORHOODS OF MISSION HILL AND ROXBURY. THE IMPACT OF RACISM, BARRIERS TO CARE, AND DISPARITIES IN HEALTH OUTCOMES THAT THESE POPULATIONS FACE ARE WIDELY DOCUMENTED IN THE LITERATURE AND CONFIRMED BY THE DATA CAPTURED BY THIS ASSESSMENT. HIGH RATES OF CHRONIC AND ACUTE PHYSICAL HEALTH CONDITIONS. THE ASSESSMENT'S QUANTITATIVE DATA CLEARLY SHOWS THAT MANY COMMUNITIES IN NEBH'S CBSA HAVE HIGH RATES FOR MANY OF THE LEADING PHYSICAL HEALTH CONDITIONS (E.G., HEART DISEASE, HYPERTENSION, CANCER, AND ASTHMA). IN MANY COMMUNITIES, THESE RATES ARE STATISTICALLY HIGHER THAN COMMONWEALTH RATES, INDICATING A PARTICULARLY SIGNIFICANT PROBLEM. HOWEVER, EVEN FOR THOSE COMMUNITIES WHERE THE RATES ARE NOT STATISTICALLY HIGHER, THESE CONDITIONS ARE STILL THE LEADING CAUSES OF PREMATURE DEATH. HIGH RATES OF THE LEADING HEALTH RISK FACTORS. ONE OF THE LEADING FINDINGS FROM THE ASSESSMENT IS THAT MANY COMMUNITIES AND/OR POPULATION SEGMENTS IN NEBH'S CBSA HAVE HIGH RATES OF CHRONIC PHYSICAL AND BEHAVIORAL HEALTH CONDITIONS. IN SOME PEOPLE, THESE CONDITIONS HAVE UNDERLYING GENETIC ROOTS THAT ARE HARD TO COUNTER. HOWEVER, FOR MOST PEOPLE THESE CONDITIONS ARE WIDELY CONSIDERED PREVENTABLE OR MANAGEABLE. ADDRESSING THE LEADING RISK FACTORS IS AT THE ROOT OF A SOUND CHRONIC DISEASE PREVENTION AND MANAGEMENT STRATEGY. HIGH RATES OF SUBSTANCE USE AND MENTAL HEALTH ISSUES. THE IMPACT OF SOCIAL DETERMINANTS WAS THE LEAD FINDING, BUT A CLOSE SECOND WAS THE PROFOUND IMPACT OF BEHAVIORAL HEALTH ISSUES (I.E., SUBSTANCE USE AND MENTAL HEALTH) ON INDIVIDUALS, FAMILIES AND COMMUNITIES IN EVERY GEOGRAPHIC REGION AND EVERY POPULATION SEGMENT IN NEBH'S CBSA. DEPRESSION/ANXIETY, SUICIDE, ALCOHOL USE, OPIOID AND PRESCRIPTION DRUG USE, AND MARIJUANA USE ARE MAJOR HEALTH ISSUES AND ARE HAVING A SIGNIFICANT IMPACT ON THE POPULATION AS WELL AS A BURDEN ON THE SERVICE SYSTEM. THE FACT THAT PHYSICAL AND BEHAVIORAL HEALTH ARE SO INTERTWINED COMPOUNDS THE IMPACT OF THESE ISSUES. OF PARTICULAR CONCERN ARE THE INCREASING RATES OF OPIOID USE AND THE IMPACTS OF TRAUMA. LIMITED ACCESS TO BEHAVIORAL HEALTH SERVICES, PARTICULARLY FOR LOW-INCOME, MEDICAID COVERED, UNINSURED, FOREIGN BORN, NON-ENGLISH SPEAKERS, AND THOSE WITH COMPLEX/MULTI-FACETED ISSUES. DESPITE THE BURDEN OF MENTAL HEALTH AND SUBSTANCE USE ON ALL SEGMENTS OF THE POPULATION, THERE IS AN EXTREMELY LIMITED SERVICE SYSTEM AVAILABLE TO MEET THE NEEDS THAT EXIST FOR THOSE WITH MILD TO MODERATE EPISODIC ISSUES OR THOSE WITH MORE SERIOUS AND COMPLEX, CHRONIC CONDITIONS. EFFORTS NEED TO BE MADE TO EXPAND ACCESS, REDUCE BARRIERS TO CARE (INCLUDING STIGMA), AND IMPROVE THE QUALITY OF PRIMARY CARE AND SPECIALIZED BEHAVIORAL HEALTH SERVICES. THE CHNA THAT WAS COMPLETED DURING THE FISCAL YEAR ENDED SEPTEMBER 30, 2019, WILL INFORM NEBH'S COMMUNITY BENEFITS INITIATIVES DURING THE FISCAL YEARS ENDED SEPTEMBER 30, 2020; SEPTEMBER 30, 2021; AND SEPTEMBER 30, 2022."

THE PRIORITIES WERE DESIGNED TO PROMOTE COMMUNITY-BASED WELLNESS AND DISEASE PREVENTION AND ENSURE ONGOING SELF-MANAGEMENT OF CHRONIC DISEASES AND BEHAVIORAL HEALTH DISORDERS. THE GOALS AND ACTIVITIES DRAWN FROM THESE PRIORITIES MADE EXTENSIVE USE OF EXISTING PARTNERSHIPS, RESOURCES AND PROGRAMS IN ORDER TO MAKE THE LARGEST POSSIBLE HEALTH IMPACT.2016 COMMUNITY HEALTH NEEDS ASSESSMENTKEY FINDINGS SOCIAL DETERMINANTS OF HEALTH CONTINUE TO HAVE A TREMENDOUS IMPACT ON MANY SEGMENTS OF THE POPULATION. THE DOMINANT THEME FROM THE ASSESSMENT'S KEY INFORMANT INTERVIEWS AND COMMUNITY FORUMS WAS THE CONTINUED IMPACT THAT THE UNDERLYING SOCIAL DETERMINANTS OF HEALTH ARE HAVING ON THE CBSA'S LOW-INCOME, UNDERSERVED, DIVERSE POPULATION COHORTS.

DISPARITIES IN HEALTH OUTCOMES EXIST IN NEBH CBSA BY RACE/ETHNICITY, FOREIGN BORN STATUS, AND LANGUAGE. AS WAS ESTABLISHED IN THE 2013 NEBH COMMUNITY BENEFITS CHNA REPORT, THERE ARE MAJOR HEALTH DISPARITIES FOR RESIDENTS LIVING IN NEBH'S CBSA. THIS IS PARTICULARLY TRUE FOR RACIALLY/ETHNICALLY DIVERSE, FOREIGN BORN, AND NON-ENGLISH SPEAKING RESIDENTS LIVING IN ROXBURY, AT THE HEART OF NEBH'S CBSA, WHICH FACE MANY OF THE MOST SIGNIFICANT DISPARITIES IN THE CITY OF BOSTON AND MASSACHUSETTS OVERALL. THE IMPACT OF RACISM, BARRIERS TO CARE, AND DISPARITIES IN HEALTH OUTCOMES THAT THOSE LIVING IN NEBH'S CBSA FACE ARE WIDELY DOCUMENTED IN THE LITERATURE AND ARE CONFIRMED BY NUMEROUS NATIONAL, COMMONWEALTH, AND LOCAL DATA SOURCES, INCLUDING QUANTITATIVE DATA FROM THE BOSTON PUBLIC HEALTH COMMISSION 2014-15 HEALTH OF BOSTON REPORT. IT SHOULD ALSO BE NOTED THAT ONE OF THE DOMINANT THEMES FROM THE ASSESSMENT'S KEY INFORMANT INTERVIEWS AND COMMUNITY FORUMS WAS THE IMPACT THAT THE UNDERLYING SOCIAL DETERMINANTS LISTED ABOVE HAVE ON THE SERVICE AREA, PARTICULARLY ON LOW-INCOME, RACIALLY/ETHNICALLY DIVERSE, AND OLDER ADULT COHORTS. LIMITED ACCESS TO PRIMARY CARE MEDICAL AND SPECIALTY CARE, ORAL HEALTH, AND BEHAVIORAL HEALTH SERVICES FOR LOW-INCOME, MEDICAID INSURED, UNINSURED, AND OTHER POPULATION SEGMENTS FACING BARRIERS TO CARE. MASSACHUSETTS HAS ONE OF HIGHEST RATES OF HEALTH INSURANCE AND ONE OF THE STRONGEST, MOST ROBUST HEALTH SERVICE SYSTEMS IN THE NATION, YET THERE ARE STILL SUBSTANTIAL POCKETS OF LOW-INCOME, MEDICAID INSURED, UNINSURED, AND UNDERINSURED RESIDENTS WHO HAVE LIMITED ACCESS TO NEEDED SERVICES AND/OR ARE NOT PROPERLY ENGAGED IN ESSENTIAL MEDICAL, ORAL, AND BEHAVIORAL HEALTH SERVICES. THESE POPULATIONS ARE, IN TURN, MORE LIKELY TO USE THE EMERGENCY ROOM AND MORE LIKELY TO HAVE HEALTH RISK FACTORS SUCH AS OBESITY, POOR FITNESS, AND RISKY ALCOHOL USE AS WELL AS MORE LIKELY TO HAVE DIABETES, HYPERTENSION, AND ASTHMA. HIGH RATES OF THE LEADING HEALTH RISK FACTORS. ONE OF THE LEADING FINDINGS FROM THE ASSESSMENT IS THAT MANY COMMUNITIES AND/OR POPULATION SEGMENTS IN NEBH'S CBSA HAVE HIGH RATES OF CHRONIC PHYSICAL AND BEHAVIORAL HEALTH CONDITIONS. IN SOME INDIVIDUALS, THESE CONDITIONS HAVE UNDERLYING GENETIC ROOTS THAT ARE DIFFICULT TO COUNTER. HOWEVER, FOR MOST PEOPLE THESE CONDITIONS ARE WIDELY CONSIDERED TO BE PREVENTABLE OR MANAGEABLE. ADDRESSING THE LEADING HEALTH RISK FACTORS (E.G., LACK OF NUTRITIONAL FOOD AND PHYSICAL ACTIVITY, ALCOHOL/ILLICIT DRUG ABUSE, AND TOBACCO USE) IS CRITICAL TO CHRONIC DISEASE PREVENTION AND MANAGEMENT EFFORTS. IT SHOULD BE NOTED THAT MOST AREAS WITHIN NEBH'S SERVICE AREA FARE WELL AGAINST COMMONWEALTH AVERAGES ON THESE RISK FACTORS. HOWEVER, THERE ARE CITIES/TOWNS WHOSE RATES ARE NOT AS FAVORABLE. AS STATED ABOVE, LOW-INCOME, FOREIGN BORN, AND OLDER SEGMENTS OF THE POPULATION ARE MORE LIKELY TO BE AT-RISK. HIGH RATES OF SUBSTANCE USE AND MENTAL HEALTH ISSUES. DURING INTERVIEWS AND COMMUNITY FORUMS, RESIDENTS AND AREA SERVICE PROVIDERS SPOKE PASSIONATELY ABOUT THE TREMENDOUS IMPACT THAT MENTAL HEALTH AND SUBSTANCE USE ISSUES HAVE ON MANY INDIVIDUALS AND FAMILIES IN THE SERVICE AREA. DEPRESSION AND ANXIETY, ISOLATION, ALCOHOL ABUSE, OPIOID AND PRESCRIPTION DRUG ABUSE, AND POST-TRAUMATIC STRESS DISORDER WERE IDENTIFIED AS MAJOR HEALTH CONCERNS. OPIOID ABUSE WAS A PARTICULAR CONCERN FOR RESIDENTS AND SERVICE PROVIDERS IN NEBH'S SERVICE AREA AND THERE WERE CALLS FOR GREATER OUTREACH, EDUCATION, SCREENING, AND TREATMENT SERVICES FOR ALL SEGMENTS OF THE POPULATION. DESPITE THE BURDEN OF MENTAL HEALTH AND SUBSTANCE ABUSE ON ALL PEOPLE, THERE IS AN EXTREMELY LIMITED SERVICE SYSTEM AVAILABLE TO MEET SPECIALIZED NEEDS, ESPECIALLY FOR OLDER ADULTS, THOSE WITH MILD TO MODERATE EPISODIC ISSUES, AND THOSE WITH SEVERE, COMPLEX, CHRONIC CONDITIONS. EFFORTS NEED TO BE MADE TO EXPAND ACCESS, REDUCE BARRIERS TO CARE (INCLUDING STIGMA), AND IMPROVE THE QUALITY OF PRIMARY CARE AND SPECIALIZED BEHAVIORAL HEALTH SERVICES."

THE ASSESSMENT'S QUANTITATIVE DATA SHOWS THAT, OVERALL, NEBH'S SERVICE AREA FARES BETTER THAN THE COMMONWEALTH WITH RESPECT TO CHRONIC DISEASE RATES. IT SHOULD BE NOTED THAT EVEN FOR THOSE COMMUNITIES THAT DO NOT HAVE RATES THAT ARE STATISTICALLY HIGHER THAN THE COMMONWEALTH, THESE CONDITIONS ARE STILL THE LEADING CAUSES OF PREMATURE DEATH. HIGH RATES OF HIV/AIDS. GREAT STRIDES HAVE BEEN MADE IN CONTROLLING AND MANAGING HIV/AIDS, AND FOR MANY IT IS MANAGED AS A CHRONIC CONDITION WITH MEDICATIONS. ALTHOUGH RATES OF ILLNESS, DEATH, AND HIV TRANSMISSION DECLINED OVERALL IN THE PAST DECADE, HIV/AIDS CONTINUES TO IMPACT CERTAIN SEGMENTS OF THE POPULATION, INCLUDING MEN WHO HAVE SEX WITH MEN AND INJECTION DRUG USERS. IN NEBH'S CBSA, RATES OF HIV/AIDS ARE PARTICULARLY HIGH IN ROXBURY. THE HOSPITALIZATION RATE PER 100,000 WHERE HIV/AIDS WAS THE PRIMARY REASON FOR THE VISIT WAS 40 FOR BOSTON COMPARED TO 12 FOR THE COMMONWEALTH. HIGH RATES OF CANCER, PARTICULARLY FOR LOW-INCOME, RACIALLY/ETHNICALLY DIVERSE, AND OTHERWISE AT-RISK POPULATION SEGMENTS. MANY OF THE COMMUNITIES THAT ARE PART OF NEBH'S SERVICE AREA HAVE HIGH CANCER INCIDENCE, HOSPITALIZATION OR MORTALITY RATES. THIS IS PARTICULARLY TRUE FOR CERTAIN CANCERS IN SPECIFIC COMMUNITIES. ROXBURY IS MORE BURDENED BY COLORECTAL CANCER, BREAST CANCER, LUNG CANCER, PANCREATIC CANCER, AND PROSTATE CANCER. THERE ARE MYRIAD FACTORS ASSOCIATED WITH CANCER AND MANY OF THEM ARE DIFFICULT TO ASSESS OR ADDRESS. HOWEVER, AT THE ROOT OF ADDRESSING CANCER AND HIGH MORTALITY IS SCREENING, EARLY DETECTION, PEER SUPPORT, AND ACCESS TO TIMELY, SUPPORTIVE, QUALITY TREATMENT.COMMUNITY HEALTH NEEDS ASSESSMENTMAKING THE CHNA AND IMPLEMENTATION STRATEGY WIDELY AVAILABLENEBH STRIVES TO ADDRESS THE PRIORITY AREAS IN ITS CHNA AND IMPLEMENTATION STRATEGY.

202032279349301503,550357050,SCHEDULE H PART VI,"Part I, Line 3c: Eligibility is determined by comparing household family income against the income poverty guidelines for financial indigence, a ratio of total medical expenses to annual disposable income for medical indigence. Income is defined as the total annual cash receipts before taxes from all sources. Financially indigent. Uncompensated care shall include unreimbursed services to the financially indigent. Financially indigent shall mean uninsured or underinsured patients accepted for care with no obligation or a discounted obligation to pay for services rendered based on the medical center's eligibility system which may include: (a) income levels and means testing or other criteria for determining a patient's inability to pay; or b) other criteria for determining a patient's inability to pay that are consistent with the medical center's mission and established policy. The federal poverty level shall serve as an index for the threshold below which patients receiving care at St. Mary's Medical Center are deemed financially indigent. Financially indigent services include noncovered services for patients eligible for the Medicaid program, services provided under county indigent care contracts, and other state or federal assistance programs for low income groups. Medically indigent. Uncompensated care shall include unreimbursed services to the medically indigent. Medically indigent shall mean patients who are responsible for their living expenses, but whos medical and hospital bills, after payment by third party payers, where applicable, exceed: (a) a specified percentage of the patient's annual gross income (i.e., catastrophic medical expenses) in accordance with the Medical Center's formal eligibility system in such instances where payment would require liquidation of assets critical to living or earning a living; or (b) the criteria for determining a patient's inability to pay. While financial indigence is based strictly on an income level, medical indigence considers both income and the financial obligation for healthcare services to calculate the patient's ability to pay without liquidating assets critical to living or earning a living, such as a home, car, personal belongings, etc. Therefore, patients are considered for medically indigent status on a case by case basis. The patient would be required to provide documentation of income to determine if he/she is to be considered medically indigent. All patients are eligible to be considered for medically indigent status with the exception of patients with income below 200% of the federal poverty level as these patients are considered for some level of uncompensated care under the financially indigent category. Part I, Line 6a: SMMC prepares an annual written report that describes programs and services that promote the health of our community. The Community Benefit Report provides valuable information on programs and services provided by the Medical Center. The report is distributed to Hospital board members, but it has not been distributed to the general public. The report is compiled using the program ""A Guide for Planning and Reporting Community Benefit."" Part I, Line 7: The cost to charge ratio as calculated from worksheet 2 of the Schedule H instructions was used to determine community benefit expenses for financial assistance at cost and Medicaid. The amount of cash and in-kind contributions for community groups was obtained from the hospital's accounting records. Part I, Line 7, Column (f): The Bad Debt expense included on Form 990, Part IX, Line 25(b), but subtracted for purposes of calculating the percentage in this column is $19,941,714. Part II, Community Building Activities: St. Marys Medical Center (SMMC) has participated in a number of community-building activities during the past year that promote wellness and help enrich the lives of people in the Tri-State. Some of these are as follows: American Cancer Society Relay for Life St. Marys Regional Cancer Center participates each year in the local Cabell County American Cancer Society Relay for Life. The 2019 event combined Cabell and Wayne counties in West Virginia with Lawrence County, Ohio, to form Relay for Life of the Tri-Counties. The event was May 17, 2019, at Ritter Park in Huntington, W.Va., and raised funds and awareness for the American Cancer Society. American Heart Association Events: Go Red for Women Celebration & Huntington Heart Walk St. Marys Regional Heart Institute partners with the American Heart Association, the largest voluntary health organization working to prevent, treat and defeat heart disease, stroke and other cardiovascular diseases, for two major events each year. Cardiovascular disease is the No. 1 killer of men and women in the Tri-State. The annual Go Red for Women Celebration was Friday, Feb. 1, or National Go Red for Women Day. The celebration combined heart disease education and free health screenings with entertainment and a heart healthy lunch. The celebration raised funds for and awareness of the work of the American Heart Association. More than 250 people attended the event. The 2019 Huntington Heart Walk was Saturday, April 13 at Ritter Park in Huntington, W.Va. The walk raised funds and awareness for the American Heart Association. Nearly 800 people attended the event. Cabell Huntington Hospital SeniorFest Several SMMC services participated in the 6th Annual SeniorFest at Cabell Huntington Hospital Saturday, Sept. 29. The day-long event offers screenings, such as blood pressure, blood sugar and prostate screenings. Seniors can also receive a free flu shot, talk with physicians and staff, participate in health activities and attend educational sessions. The day also offers games, entertainment, food and prizes. Community Health Screenings SMMC participated in numerous health fairs throughout its service area during the year. These events provide free screenings for health issues, such as cholesterol, blood sugar, HDL, and osteoporosis. Education about stroke, joint replacement surgery, and risk factors for diabetes and other health issues is also provided. More than 1,000 people are screened each year through these free health screenings. Concert for a Cure The St. Marys Foundation teamed with the Cabell Huntington Hospital Foundation and St. Marys Regional Cancer Center for this event, which raised funds to help cancer patients, spotlighted the importance of early detection, and honored cancer survivors through a special concert. The event was Saturday, Aug. 17 at Barboursville Park Amphitheater in Barboursville, W.Va., and featured two popular classic rock cover bands. Girls On The Run of Cabell and Wayne Counties Girls on the Run is a nonprofit organization dedicated to creating a world where every girl knows and activates her limitless potential and is free to boldly pursue her dreams. Trained coaches lead small teams through research-based curricula, which include dynamic discussions, activities and running games. Over the course of the 10-week program, girls in 3rd-8th grade develop essential skills to help them navigate their worlds and establish a lifetime appreciation for health and fitness. SMMCs financial support of the local Girls On The Run of Cabell and Wayne Counties covers the program expenses, as well as a part-time coordinator for the area. GoNoodle GoNoodle is a website-based program that provides hundreds of dance-alongs, mindfulness videos and other ways to get kids moving. These activities help engage childrens minds and bodies and help them perform their best in the classroom. SMMC partnered with area businesses to offer the premium version, GoNoodle Plus, to area schools in counties throughout West Virginia and Southern Ohio. Greater Huntington Walks Greater Huntington Walks (GHW) was formed in 2018 to improve the perception of Huntington, W.Va., as an unhealthy community. The group consists of individuals and organizations, including SMMC, Cabell Huntington Hospital, the City of Huntington, Marshall University and the Huntington Regional Chamber of Commerce. The mission of GHW is for the Greater Huntington area to be viewed as a healthy and active community for people to live, work and visit. It aims to promote and enhance health by encouraging walking and other activities while working together to achieve a publicly-stated goal. Huntington Area Chapter AARP SMMC is the founding sponsor of the Huntington Area Chapter AARP, which meets monthly. SMMC provides leadership support and funding to help distribute useful lifestyle and health information to seniors in our community.

IN THIS SURVEY, CONDUCTED EVERY OTHER YEAR, RESPONDENTS ARE QUESTIONED ABOUT THE NEED FOR NEW SERVICES OR PHYSICIAN SPECIALTIES IN THE HOSPITAL OR COMMUNITY. THERE ARE USUALLY MULTI-PHYSICIAN RECOMMENDATIONS FOR ADDITIONAL EQUIPMENT AND CERTAIN TYPES OF PHYSICIAN SPECIALISTS. THIS IS USED AS A STARTING POINT FOR DETERMINING POTENTIAL PRIORITIES FOR PHYSICIAN RECRUITING. COMMUNITY NEEDS ASSESSMENT FOR ADDITIONAL PHYSICIANS IN THE COMMUNITY IS ALSO CONDUCTED.

PRESS-GANEY MAILS SURVEYS EVERY TWO WEEKS TO A RANDOM SAMPLE OF DISCHARGED PATIENTS. THE GOAL IS TO GET APPROXIMATELY 350 COMPLETED SURVEYS PER YEAR IN EACH OF THE VARIOUS CARE SETTINGS PER FACILITY. THESE CARE SETTINGS INCLUDE INPATIENT, OUTPATIENT, EMERGENCY ROOMS, OUTPATIENT SURGERY, OUTPATIENT DIAGNOSTICS, HOME HEALTH CARE, URGENT CARE CENTERS, ETC.

The hospitals FY18 CHNA and three-year Implementation Strategies were endorsed by MUMHs Board of Directors and approved by the MedStar Health Board of Directors. The document became available on the hospitals website on June 30, 2018. During FY19, key revisions were made across MedStar Health to more effectively impact the communities served throughout Maryland and Washington, DC. Several internal meetings were convened with leadership from each MedStar Health Hospital to review current practices and strategies. As a result of these meetings, the approach to the current CHNA for the remainder of the three-year cycle (FY19-FY21) was revised. A key revision to the CHNA is a greater focus on hospital area strategies that are most appropriate for the local communities served. The number of strategies each hospital is accountable for executing was reduced to encourage more meaningful reach within key areas contrasted with broader reach with reduced impact. Using the standard categories, Health and Wellness, Access to Care and Social Determinants of Health to determine what to prioritize for the CHNA IRS requirements, each hospital agreed to select two to three strategies as priorities that have size and scale impact and measurable outcomes. All other programming was integrated as part of the hospitals overall community health portfolio. These additional programs were captured in the inventory for the whole picture of contributing to the health of the communities served as well as sorted for what counts as community benefit for regulatory reporting. The hospitals Community Benefit Service Area (CBSA) remains the same, based on the Advisory Task Force (ATF) recommendation. The hospital identified North Central Baltimore City as its CBSA, which includes all residents living in ZIP codes 21211, 21213 and 21218. The hospital selected this geographic area based on hospital utilization data and secondary public health data as well as its proximity to the hospital. The ATF included a diverse group of individuals, including hospital leaders, grassroots activists, community residents, faith-based leaders, hospital representatives, public health leaders and other stakeholder organizations, such as representatives from local health departments. MUMHs health priorities for the CBSA include health and wellness (chronic disease prevention and management, behavioral health) and social determinants of health (social needs screenings, Baltimore JOBS). As a proud member of MedStar Health, representatives from MUMH routinely participate in the MedStar Health community health workgroup. The workgroup is comprised of community health professionals who represent all ten MedStar hospitals. The team analyzes local and regional community health data, establishes system-wide community health programming performance and evaluation measures and shares best practices."

THE DIRECT AND INDIRECT COST OF SERVICES AND SUPPLIES FURNISHED TO PATIENTS ELIGIBLE FOR SUCH CHARITY CARE, USING A RATIO OF COST TO GROSS CHARGES, APPROXIMATED $1,328,000 AND $1,623,000 FOR THE YEARS ENDED DECEMBER 31, 2018 AND 2017, RESPECTIVELY. GROSS CHARGES FORGONE RELATED TO CHARITY CARE SERVICES AMOUNTED TO APPROXIMATELY $8,509,000 AND $9,960,000 FOR THE YEARS ENDED DECEMBER 31, 2018 AND 2017, RESPECTIVELY. THE MEDICAL CENTER'S PATIENT ACCEPTANCE POLICY IS BASED ON ITS MISSION STATEMENT AND ITS CHARITABLE PURPOSES. ACCORDINGLY, THE MEDICAL CENTER ACCEPTS ALL PATIENTS REGARDLESS OF THEIR ABILITY TO PAY. THIS POLICY RESULTS IN THE ASSUMPTION OF HIGHER-THAN-NORMAL PATIENT ACCOUNTS RECEIVABLE CREDIT RISKS. TO THE EXTENT THE MEDICAL CENTER REALIZES ADDITIONAL LOSSES RESULTING FROM SUCH HIGHER CREDIT RISK FOR PATIENTS THAT ARE NOT IDENTIFIED OR DO NOT MEET THE PREVIOUSLY DESCRIBED CHARITY DEFINITION, SUCH ADDITIONAL LOSSES ARE INCLUDED IN THE PROVISION FOR BAD DEBTS. ADDITIONALLY, THE MEDICAL CENTER SPONSORS CERTAIN OTHER CHARITABLE PROGRAMS, WHICH PROVIDE SUBSTANTIAL BENEFIT TO THE BROADER COMMUNITY. SUCH PROGRAMS INCLUDE SERVICES TO NEEDY AND ELDERLY POPULATIONS THAT REQUIRE SPECIAL SUPPORT, AS WELL AS HEALTH PROMOTION AND EDUCATION FOR THE GENERAL COMMUNITY WELFARE. THE HEALTH CARE REFORM ACT OF 1992, CHAPTER 160, ESTABLISHED THE HEALTH CARE SUBSIDY FUND TO PROVIDE A MECHANISM AND FUNDING SOURCE TO COMPENSATE HOSPITALS FOR CHARITY CARE. THE MEDICAL CENTER RECEIVED APPROXIMATELY $106,000 AND $206,000 FOR CHARITY CARE, WHICH IS INCLUDED IN NET PATIENT SERVICE REVENUE FOR THE YEARS ENDED DECEMBER 31, 2018 AND 2017, RESPECTIVELY. THE HEALTH CARE SUBSIDY FUND AMOUNTS ARE SUBJECT TO CHANGE FROM YEAR TO YEAR BASED ON AVAILABLE STATE BUDGET AMOUNTS AND ALLOCATION METHODOLOGIES."
201913199349301856,210662542,"SCHEDULE H, PART III, LINE 8","MEDICARE COSTS WERE DERIVED FROM THE 2018 MEDICARE COST REPORT. THE ORGANIZATION FEELS THAT MEDICARE UNDERPAYMENTS (SHORTFALL), BAD DEBT AND ASSOCIATED COSTS ARE COMMUNITY BENEFIT AND ARE INCLUDABLE ON THE FORM 990, SCHEDULE H, PART I. AS OUTLINED MORE FULLY BELOW, THE ORGANIZATION BELIEVES THAT THESE SERVICES AND RELATED COSTS PROMOTE THE HEALTH OF THE COMMUNITY AS A WHOLE AND ARE RENDERED IN CONJUNCTION WITH THE ORGANIZATION'S CHARITABLE TAX-EXEMPT PURPOSES AND MISSION IN PROVIDING MEDICALLY NECESSARY HEALTHCARE SERVICES TO ALL INDIVIDUALS IN A NON-DISCRIMINATORY MANNER WITHOUT REGARD TO RACE, COLOR, CREED, SEX, NATIONAL ORIGIN OR ABILITY TO PAY AND CONSISTENT WITH THE COMMUNITY BENEFIT STANDARD PROMULGATED BY THE IRS. THE COMMUNITY BENEFIT STANDARD IS THE CURRENT STANDARD FOR A HOSPITAL FOR RECOGNITION AS A TAX-EXEMPT AND CHARITABLE ORGANIZATION UNDER INTERNAL REVENUE CODE (""IRC"") 501(C)(3). THE ORGANIZATION IS RECOGNIZED AS A TAX-EXEMPT ENTITY AND CHARITABLE ORGANIZATION UNDER 501(C)(3) OF THE IRC. ALTHOUGH THERE IS NO DEFINITION IN THE TAX CODE FOR THE TERM ""CHARITABLE"" A REGULATION PROMULGATED BY THE DEPARTMENT OF THE TREASURY PROVIDES SOME GUIDANCE AND STATES THAT ""THE TERM CHARITABLE IS USED IN SECTION 501(C)(3) IN ITS GENERALLY ACCEPTED LEGAL SENSE,PROVIDES EXAMPLES OF CHARITABLE PURPOSES, INCLUDING THE RELIEF OF THE POOR OR UNPRIVILEGED; THE PROMOTION OF SOCIAL WELFARE; AND THE ADVANCEMENT OF EDUCATION, RELIGION, AND SCIENCE. NOTE IT DOES NOT EXPLICITLY ADDRESS THE ACTIVITIES OF HOSPITALS. IN THE ABSENCE OF EXPLICIT STATUTORY OR REGULATORY REQUIREMENTS APPLYING THE TERM ""CHARITABLE"" TO HOSPITALS, IT HAS BEEN LEFT TO THE IRS TO DETERMINE THE CRITERIA HOSPITALS MUST MEET TO QUALIFY AS IRC 501(C)(3) CHARITABLE ORGANIZATIONS. THE ORIGINAL STANDARD WAS KNOWN AS THE CHARITY CARE STANDARD. THIS STANDARD WAS REPLACED BY THE IRS WITH THE COMMUNITY BENEFIT STANDARD WHICH IS THE CURRENT STANDARD. CHARITY CARE STANDARD IN 1956, THE IRS ISSUED REVENUE RULING 56-185, WHICH ADDRESSED THE REQUIREMENTS HOSPITALS NEEDED TO MEET IN ORDER TO QUALIFY FOR IRC 501(C)(3) STATUS. ONE OF THESE REQUIREMENTS IS KNOWN AS THE ""CHARITY CARE STANDARD."" UNDER THE STANDARD, A HOSPITAL MUST PROVIDE, TO THE EXTENT OF ITS FINANCIAL ABILITY, FREE OR REDUCED-COST CARE TO PATIENTS WHO CANNOT PAY FOR SUCH SERVICES. A HOSPITAL THAT EXPECTED FULL PAYMENT DID NOT, ACCORDING TO THE RULING, PROVIDE CHARITY CARE BASED ON THE FACT THAT SOME PATIENTS ULTIMATELY FAILED TO PAY. THE RULING EMPHASIZED THAT A LOW LEVEL OF CHARITY CARE DID NOT NECESSARILY MEAN THAT A HOSPITAL HAD FAILED TO MEET THE REQUIREMENT SINCE THAT LEVEL COULD REFLECT ITS FINANCIAL ABILITY TO PROVIDE SUCH CARE. THE RULING ALSO NOTED THAT PUBLICLY SUPPORTED COMMUNITY HOSPITALS WOULD NORMALLY QUALIFY AS CHARITABLE ORGANIZATIONS BECAUSE THEY SERVE THE ENTIRE COMMUNITY AND A LOW LEVEL OF CHARITY CARE WOULD NOT AFFECT A HOSPITAL'S EXEMPT STATUS IF IT WAS DUE TO THE SURROUNDING COMMUNITY'S LACK OF CHARITABLE DEMANDS. COMMUNITY BENEFIT STANDARD IN 1969, THE IRS ISSUED REVENUE RULING 69-545, WHICH ""REMOVED"" FROM REVENUE RULING 56-185 ""THE REQUIREMENTS RELATING TO CARING FOR PATIENTS WITHOUT CHARGE OR AT RATES BELOW COST."" UNDER THE STANDARD DEVELOPED IN REVENUE RULING 69-545, WHICH IS KNOWN AS THE ""COMMUNITY BENEFIT STANDARD,"" HOSPITALS ARE JUDGED ON WHETHER THEY PROMOTE THE HEALTH OF A BROAD CLASS OF INDIVIDUALS IN THE COMMUNITY. THE RULING INVOLVED A HOSPITAL THAT ONLY ADMITTED INDIVIDUALS WHO COULD PAY FOR THE SERVICES (BY THEMSELVES, PRIVATE INSURANCE, OR PUBLIC PROGRAMS SUCH AS MEDICARE), BUT OPERATED A FULL-TIME EMERGENCY ROOM THAT WAS OPEN TO EVERYONE. THE IRS RULED THAT THE HOSPITAL QUALIFIED AS A CHARITABLE ORGANIZATION BECAUSE IT PROMOTED THE HEALTH OF PEOPLE IN ITS COMMUNITY. THE IRS REASONED THAT BECAUSE THE PROMOTION OF HEALTH WAS A CHARITABLE PURPOSE ACCORDING TO THE GENERAL LAW OF CHARITY, IT FELL WITHIN THE ""GENERALLY ACCEPTED LEGAL SENSE"" OF THE TERM ""CHARITABLE,"" AS REQUIRED BY THE DEPARTMENT OF TREASURY REG. 1.501(C)(3)-1(D)(2). THE IRS RULING STATED THAT THE PROMOTION OF HEALTH, LIKE THE RELIEF OF POVERTY AND THE ADVANCEMENT OF EDUCATION AND RELIGION, IS ONE OF THE PURPOSES IN THE GENERAL LAW OF CHARITY THAT IS DEEMED BENEFICIAL TO THE COMMUNITY AS A WHOLE EVEN THOUGH THE CLASS OF BENEFICIARIES ELIGIBLE TO RECEIVE A DIRECT BENEFIT FROM ITS ACTIVITIES DOES NOT INCLUDE ALL MEMBERS OF THE COMMUNITY, SUCH AS INDIGENT MEMBERS OF THE COMMUNITY, PROVIDED THAT THE CLASS IS NOT SO SMALL THAT ITS RELIEF IS NOT OF BENEFIT TO THE COMMUNITY. THE IRS CONCLUDED THAT THE HOSPITAL WAS ""PROMOTING THE HEALTH OF A CLASS OF PERSONS THAT IS BROAD ENOUGH TO BENEFIT THE COMMUNITY"" BECAUSE ITS EMERGENCY ROOM WAS OPEN TO ALL AND IT PROVIDED CARE TO EVERYONE WHO COULD PAY, WHETHER DIRECTLY OR THROUGH THIRD-PARTY REIMBURSEMENT. OTHER CHARACTERISTICS OF THE HOSPITAL THAT THE IRS HIGHLIGHTED INCLUDED THE FOLLOWING: ITS SURPLUS FUNDS WERE USED TO IMPROVE PATIENT CARE, EXPAND HOSPITAL FACILITIES, AND ADVANCE MEDICAL TRAINING, EDUCATION AND RESEARCH; IT WAS CONTROLLED BY A BOARD OF TRUSTEES THAT CONSISTED OF INDEPENDENT CIVIC LEADERS; AND HOSPITAL MEDICAL STAFF PRIVILEGES WERE AVAILABLE TO ALL QUALIFIED PHYSICIANS. THE AMERICAN HOSPITAL ASSOCIATION (""AHA"") FEELS THAT MEDICARE UNDERPAYMENTS (SHORTFALL) AND BAD DEBT ARE COMMUNITY BENEFIT AND THUS INCLUDABLE ON THE FORM 990, SCHEDULE H, PART I. THIS ORGANIZATION AGREES WITH THE AHA'S POSITION. AS OUTLINED IN THE AHA'S LETTER TO THE IRS DATED AUGUST 21, 2007 WITH RESPECT TO THE FIRST PUBLISHED DRAFT OF THE NEW FORM 990 AND SCHEDULE H, THE AHA FELT THAT THE IRS SHOULD INCORPORATE THE FULL VALUE OF THE COMMUNITY BENEFIT THAT HOSPITALS PROVIDE BY COUNTING MEDICARE UNDERPAYMENTS (SHORTFALL) AS QUANTIFIABLE COMMUNITY BENEFIT FOR THE FOLLOWING REASONS: - PROVIDING CARE FOR THE ELDERLY AND SERVING MEDICARE PATIENTS IS AN ESSENTIAL PART OF THE COMMUNITY BENEFIT STANDARD - MEDICARE, LIKE MEDICAID, DOES NOT PAY THE FULL COST OF CARE. FROM THE LATEST DATA PROVIDED BY THE AHA, AS OF 2017, MEDICARE REIMBURSES HOSPITALS ONLY 87 CENTS FOR EVERY DOLLAR THEY SPEND TO TAKE CARE OF MEDICARE PATIENTS. - MANY MEDICARE BENEFICIARIES, LIKE THEIR MEDICAID COUNTERPARTS, ARE POOR. MORE THAN 42 PERCENT OF MEDICARE SPENDING IS FOR BENEFICIARIES WHOSE INCOME IS BELOW 200 PERCENT OF THE FEDERAL POVERTY LEVEL. MANY OF THOSE MEDICARE BENEFICIARIES ARE ALSO ELIGIBLE FOR MEDICAID -- SO CALLED ELIGIBLE."" THERE IS EVERY COMPELLING PUBLIC POLICY REASON TO TREAT MEDICARE AND MEDICAID UNDERPAYMENTS SIMILARLY FOR PURPOSES OF A HOSPITAL'S COMMUNITY BENEFIT AND INCLUDE THESE COSTS ON FORM 990, SCHEDULE H, PART I. MEDICARE UNDERPAYMENT MUST BE SHOULDERED BY THE HOSPITAL IN ORDER TO CONTINUE TREATING THE COMMUNITY'S ELDERLY AND POOR. THESE UNDERPAYMENTS REPRESENT A REAL COST OF SERVING THE COMMUNITY AND SHOULD COUNT AS A QUANTIFIABLE COMMUNITY BENEFIT. BOTH THE AHA AND THIS ORGANIZATION ALSO FEEL THAT PATIENT BAD DEBT IS A COMMUNITY BENEFIT AND THUS INCLUDABLE ON THE FORM 990, SCHEDULE H, PART I. LIKE MEDICARE UNDERPAYMENT (SHORTFALLS), THERE ALSO ARE COMPELLING REASONS THAT PATIENT BAD DEBT SHOULD BE COUNTED AS QUANTIFIABLE COMMUNITY BENEFIT AS FOLLOWS: - A SIGNIFICANT MAJORITY OF BAD DEBT IS ATTRIBUTABLE TO LOW-INCOME PATIENTS, WHO, FOR MANY REASONS, DECLINE TO COMPLETE THE FORMS REQUIRED TO ESTABLISH ELIGIBILITY FOR HOSPITALS' CHARITY CARE OR THOSE WHO DO NOT PAY ALL, OR A PORTION OF THE ALREADY DISCOUNTED BILLED AMOUNTS UNDER OUR FINANCIAL ASSISTANCE POLICY. A 2006 CONGRESSIONAL BUDGET OFFICE (""CBO"") REPORT, NONPROFIT HOSPITALS AND THE PROVISION OF COMMUNITY BENEFITS, CITED TWO STUDIES INDICATING THAT ""THE GREAT MAJORITY OF BAD DEBT WAS ATTRIBUTABLE TO PATIENTS WITH INCOMES BELOW 200% OF THE FEDERAL POVERTY LINE."" - THE REPORT ALSO NOTED THAT A SUBSTANTIAL PORTION OF BAD DEBT IS PENDING CHARITY CARE. UNLIKE BAD DEBT IN OTHER INDUSTRIES, HOSPITAL BAD DEBT IS COMPLICATED BY THE FACT THAT HOSPITALS FOLLOW THEIR MISSION TO THE COMMUNITY AND TREAT EVERY PATIENT THAT COMES THROUGH THEIR EMERGENCY DEPARTMENT, REGARDLESS OF ABILITY TO PAY. PATIENTS WHO HAVE OUTSTANDING BILLS ARE NOT TURNED AWAY, UNLIKE OTHER INDUSTRIES. BAD DEBT IS FURTHER COMPLICATED BY THE AUDITING INDUSTRY'S STANDARDS ON REPORTING CHARITY CARE. MANY PATIENTS CANNOT OR DO NOT PROVIDE THE NECESSARY, EXTENSIVE DOCUMENTATION REQUIRED TO BE DEEMED CHARITY CARE BY AUDITORS. AS A RESULT, ROUGHLY 40% OF BAD DEBT IS PENDING CHARITY CARE. THE CBO CONCLUDED THAT ITS FINDINGS ""SUPPORT THE VALIDITY OF THE USE OF UNCOMPENSATED CARE [BAD DEBT AND CHARITY CARE] AS A MEASURE OF COMMUNITY BENEFIT"" ASSUMING THE FINDINGS ARE GENERALIZABLE NATIONWIDE; THE EXPERIENCE OF HOSPITALS AROUND THE NATION REINFORCES THAT THEY ARE GENERALIZABLE. AS OUTLINED BY THE AHA, DESPITE THE HOSPITAL'S BEST EFFORTS AND DUE DILIGENCE, PATIENT BAD DEBT IS A PART OF THE HOSPITAL'S MISSION AND CHARITABLE PURPOSES. BAD DEBT REPRESENTS PART OF THE BURDEN HOSPITALS SHOULDER IN SERVING ALL"

GIVEN HNMC'S PROXIMITY TO NEW YORK CITY (I.E., FIVE MILES NORTH OF THE GEORGE WASHINGTON BRIDGE) EMERGENCY PREPAREDNESS IS DEEMED NECESSARY TO ENSURE THE HEALTH AND WELL-BEING OF THE COMMUNITY, REGARDLESS OF THE MCC DESIGNATION. CENTRAL TO THIS COMMITMENT IS A HNMC-FUNDED VICE PRESIDENT WHOSE JOB FUNCTION INCLUDES SUBSTANTIAL INVOLVEMENT IN PREPAREDNESS BOTH ON-CAMPUS AND IN THE COMMUNITY. HNMC HAS LONG BEEN RECOGNIZED BY STATE AND FEDERAL SECTORS FOR ITS EXPERTISE IN EMERGENCY PREPAREDNESS AND RESPONSE. A FREQUENT PARTICIPANT IN LOCAL AND NEW YORK CITY DISASTER DRILLS, HNMC HAS PARTICIPATED IN SEVERAL LARGE SCALE DISASTER DRILLS, AS WELL AS DRILLS CONDUCTED BY THE CENTERS FOR DISEASE CONTROL INVOLVING LOCAL, COUNTY, STATE AND FEDERAL AGENCIES' EMERGENCY RESPONSE TO THREATS OF PUBLIC HEALTH SIGNIFICANCE. HNMC MAINTAINS ITS DESIGNATION BY THE FEDERAL DIVISION OF GLOBAL MIGRATION AND QUARANTINE TO DEAL WITH POSSIBLE COMMUNICABLE DISEASES AND ACTS OF BIOTERRORISM OCCURRING ON PUBLIC HEALTH CONVEYANCES. HNMC IS ALSO ACTIVE IN THE NORTHERN NEW JERSEY URBAN AREA SECURITY INITIATIVE. MEMBERS OF HOLY NAME EMS SERVE ON THE STATEWIDE NJ EMS TASK FORCE. THE MEDICAL CENTER MAINTAINS A SPECIAL OPERATIONS TEAM COMPRISED OF PARAMEDICS AND EMERGENCY MEDICAL TECHNICIANS WHO ARE READY TO RESPOND 24 HOURS A DAY, 7 DAYS A WEEK TO ASSIST LOCAL COMMUNITIES WITH EMERGENCIES. HNMC PREPARED AND TAUGHT COURSES IN RESPONDING TO AN ACTIVE SHOOTER SITUATION. DEVISED IN CONJUNCTION WITH THE POLICE DEPARTMENT OF TEANECK, NJ, HNMC'S VIDEO TRAINING WAS USED DURING OVER 2,000 HOURS OF TRAINING."
201913199349302206,221487322,"SCHEDULE H, PART III, SECTION A, QUESTIONS 2, 3 & 4","BAD DEBT EXPENSE WAS CALCULATED USING THE PROVIDERS' BAD DEBT EXPENSE FROM ITS FINANCIAL STATEMENTS, NET OF ACCOUNTS WRITTEN OFF AT CHARGES. HNMC AND ITS AFFILIATES PREPARE AND ISSUE AUDITED CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS. THE BELOW WAS OBTAINED FROM THE FOOTNOTES TO THE AUDITED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS OF HNMC AND SUBSIDIARIES. PATIENT ACCOUNTS RECEIVABLE AND NET PATIENT SERVICE REVENUE ----------------------------------------------------------- EFFECTIVE JANUARY 1, 2018 UPON THE ADOPTION OF ASU 2014-09, NET PATIENT SERVICE REVENUE IS REPORTED AT THE AMOUNT THAT REFLECTS THE CONSIDERATION FOR WHICH THE MEDICAL CENTER EXPECTS TO BE ENTITLED IN EXCHANGE FOR PROVIDING PATIENT CARE. THE MEDICAL CENTER USES A PORTFOLIO APPROACH AS A PRACTICAL EXPEDIENT TO ACCOUNT FOR CATEGORIES OF PATIENT CONTRACTS AS COLLECTIVE GROUPS RATHER THAN RECOGNIZING REVENUE ON AN INDIVIDUAL CONTRACT BASIS. THE PORTFOLIO CONSISTS OF MAJOR PAYOR CLASSES FOR INPATIENT AND OUTPATIENT REVENUE. BASED ON HISTORICAL COLLECTION TRENDS AND OTHER ANALYSES, THE MEDICAL CENTER BELIEVES THAT REVENUE RECOGNIZED BY UTILIZING THE PORTFOLIO APPROACH APPROXIMATES THE REVENUE THAT WOULD HAVE BEEN RECOGNIZED IF AN INDIVIDUAL CONTRACT APPROACH WERE USED. THE MEDICAL CENTER'S INITIAL ESTIMATE OF THE TRANSACTION PRICE FOR THE SERVICES PROVIDED TO PATIENTS SUBJECT TO REVENUE RECOGNITION IS DETERMINED BY REDUCING THE TOTAL STANDARD CHARGES RELATED TO THE PATIENT SERVICES PROVIDED BY VARIOUS ELEMENTS OF VARIABLE CONSIDERATION, INCLUDING CONTRACTUAL ADJUSTMENTS, DISCOUNTS, IMPLICIT PRICE CONCESSIONS, AND OTHER REDUCTIONS TO THE MEDICAL CENTER'S STANDARD CHARGES. THE MEDICAL CENTER DETERMINES THE TRANSACTION PRICE ASSOCIATED WITH SERVICES PROVIDED TO PATIENTS WHO HAVE THIRD-PARTY PAYOR COVERAGE ON THE BASIS OF CONTRACTUAL OR FORMULA DRIVEN RATES FOR THE SERVICES RENDERED (SEE DESCRIPTION OF THIRD-PARTY PAYMENT PROGRAMS BELOW). THE ESTIMATES FOR CONTRACTUAL ALLOWANCES AND DISCOUNTS ARE BASED ON CONTRACTUAL AGREEMENTS, THE MEDICAL CENTER'S DISCOUNT POLICIES AND HISTORICAL EXPERIENCE. FOR UNINSURED AND UNDER-INSURED PATIENTS WHO DO NOT QUALIFY FOR CHARITY CARE, THE MEDICAL CENTER DETERMINES THE TRANSACTION PRICE ASSOCIATED WITH SERVICES RENDERED ON THE BASIS OF CHARGES REDUCED BY IMPLICIT PRICE CONCESSIONS. IMPLICIT PRICE CONCESSIONS INCLUDED IN THE ESTIMATE OF THE TRANSACTION PRICE ARE BASED ON THE MEDICAL CENTER'S HISTORICAL COLLECTION EXPERIENCE FOR APPLICABLE PATIENT PORTFOLIOS. GENERALLY, THE MEDICAL CENTER BILLS PATIENTS AND THIRD-PARTY PAYORS AFTER THE SERVICES ARE PERFORMED AND THE PATIENT IS DISCHARGED. NET PATIENT SERVICE REVENUE IS RECOGNIZED AS PERFORMANCE OBLIGATIONS ARE SATISFIED. PERFORMANCE OBLIGATIONS ARE DETERMINED BASED ON THE NATURE OF THE SERVICES PROVIDED BY THE MEDICAL CENTER. NET PATIENT SERVICE REVENUE FOR PERFORMANCE OBLIGATIONS SATISFIED OVER TIME IS RECOGNIZED BASED ON ACTUAL CHARGES INCURRED IN RELATION TO TOTAL CHARGES. THE MEDICAL CENTER BELIEVES THAT THIS METHOD PROVIDES A REASONABLE DEPICTION OF THE TRANSFER OF SERVICES OVER THE TERM OF THE PERFORMANCE OBLIGATION BASED ON THE SERVICES NEEDED TO SATISFY THE OBLIGATION. GENERALLY, PERFORMANCE OBLIGATIONS SATISFIED OVER TIME RELATE TO PATIENTS RECEIVING INPATIENT ACUTE CARE SERVICES OR PATIENTS RECEIVING SERVICES IN THE MEDICAL CENTER'S OUTPATIENT SETTINGS. THE MEDICAL CENTER MEASURES THE PERFORMANCE OBLIGATION FROM ADMISSION INTO THE MEDICAL CENTER OR THE COMMENCEMENT OF AN OUTPATIENT SERVICE TO THE POINT WHEN IT IS NO LONGER REQUIRED TO PROVIDE SERVICES TO THAT PATIENT, WHICH IS GENERALLY AT THE TIME OF DISCHARGE OR THE COMPLETION OF THE OUTPATIENT VISIT. AS SUBSTANTIALLY ALL OF ITS PERFORMANCE OBLIGATIONS RELATE TO CONTRACTS WITH A DURATION OF LESS THAN ONE YEAR, THE MEDICAL CENTER HAS ELECTED TO APPLY THE OPTIONAL EXEMPTION PROVIDED IN ASU 2014-09 AND, THEREFORE, IS NOT REQUIRED TO DISCLOSE THE AGGREGATE AMOUNT OF THE TRANSACTION PRICE ALLOCATED TO PERFORMANCE OBLIGATIONS THAT ARE UNSATISFIED OR PARTIALLY UNSATISFIED AT THE END OF THE REPORTING PERIOD. THE UNSATISFIED OR PARTIALLY UNSATISFIED PERFORMANCE OBLIGATIONS REFERRED TO ABOVE ARE PRIMARILY RELATED TO INPATIENT ACUTE CARE SERVICES AT THE END OF THE REPORTING PERIOD FOR PATIENTS WHO REMAIN ADMITTED AT THAT TIME (IN-HOUSE PATIENTS). THE PERFORMANCE OBLIGATIONS FOR IN-HOUSE PATIENTS ARE GENERALLY COMPLETED WHEN THE PATIENTS ARE DISCHARGED, WHICH FOR THE MAJORITY OF THE MEDICAL CENTER'S IN-HOUSE PATIENTS OCCURS WITHIN DAYS OR WEEKS AFTER THE END OF THE REPORTING PERIOD. SUBSEQUENT CHANGES TO THE ESTIMATE OF THE TRANSACTION PRICE (DETERMINED ON A PORTFOLIO BASIS WHEN APPLICABLE) ARE GENERALLY RECORDED AS ADJUSTMENTS TO PATIENT SERVICE REVENUE IN THE PERIOD OF THE CHANGE. FOR THE YEAR ENDED DECEMBER 31, 2018, CHANGES IN THE MEDICAL CENTER'S ESTIMATES OF IMPLICIT PRICE CONCESSIONS, DISCOUNTS, CONTRACTUAL ADJUSTMENTS OR OTHER REDUCTIONS TO EXPECTED PAYMENTS FOR PERFORMANCE OBLIGATIONS SATISFIED IN PRIOR YEARS WERE NOT SIGNIFICANT. PORTFOLIO COLLECTION ESTIMATES ARE UPDATED BASED ON COLLECTION TRENDS. SUBSEQUENT CHANGES THAT ARE DETERMINED TO BE THE RESULT OF AN ADVERSE CHANGE IN THE PATIENT'S ABILITY TO PAY (DETERMINED ON A PORTFOLIO BASIS WHEN APPLICABLE) ARE RECORDED AS BAD DEBT EXPENSE. BAD DEBT EXPENSE FOR THE YEAR ENDED DECEMBER 31, 2018 WAS NOT SIGNIFICANT. THE MEDICAL CENTER HAS DETERMINED THAT THE NATURE, AMOUNT, TIMING AND UNCERTAINTY OF REVENUE AND CASH FLOWS ARE AFFECTED BY THE FOLLOWING FACTORS: PAYORS, LINES OF BUSINESS AND TIMING OF WHEN REVENUE IS RECOGNIZED. THE ALLOWANCE FOR DOUBTFUL ACCOUNTS WAS NOT SIGNIFICANT AT DECEMBER 31, 2018. THE ALLOWANCE FOR DOUBTFUL ACCOUNTS WAS APPROXIMATELY $21.9 MILLION AT DECEMBER 31, 2017."
201913199349302206,221487322,"SCHEDULE H, PART III, SECTION B, QUESTION 8","MEDICARE COSTS WERE DERIVED FROM THE 2018 MEDICARE COST REPORT. THE ORGANIZATION FEELS THAT MEDICARE UNDERPAYMENTS (SHORTFALL), BAD DEBT AND ASSOCIATED COSTS ARE COMMUNITY BENEFIT AND ARE INCLUDABLE ON THE FORM 990, SCHEDULE H, PART I. AS OUTLINED MORE FULLY BELOW, THE ORGANIZATION BELIEVES THAT THESE SERVICES AND RELATED COSTS PROMOTE THE HEALTH OF THE COMMUNITY AS A WHOLE AND ARE RENDERED IN CONJUNCTION WITH THE ORGANIZATION'S CHARITABLE TAX-EXEMPT PURPOSES AND MISSION IN PROVIDING MEDICALLY NECESSARY HEALTHCARE SERVICES TO ALL INDIVIDUALS IN A NON-DISCRIMINATORY MANNER WITHOUT REGARD TO RACE, COLOR, CREED, SEX, NATIONAL ORIGIN OR ABILITY TO PAY AND CONSISTENT WITH THE COMMUNITY BENEFIT STANDARD PROMULGATED BY THE IRS. THE COMMUNITY BENEFIT STANDARD IS THE CURRENT STANDARD FOR A HOSPITAL FOR RECOGNITION AS A TAX-EXEMPT AND CHARITABLE ORGANIZATION UNDER INTERNAL REVENUE CODE (""IRC"") 501(C)(3). THE ORGANIZATION IS RECOGNIZED AS A TAX-EXEMPT ENTITY AND CHARITABLE ORGANIZATION UNDER 501(C)(3) OF THE IRC. ALTHOUGH THERE IS NO DEFINITION IN THE TAX CODE FOR THE TERM ""CHARITABLE"" A REGULATION PROMULGATED BY THE DEPARTMENT OF THE TREASURY PROVIDES SOME GUIDANCE AND STATES THAT ""THE TERM CHARITABLE IS USED IN SECTION 501(C)(3) IN ITS GENERALLY ACCEPTED LEGAL SENSE,PROVIDES EXAMPLES OF CHARITABLE PURPOSES, INCLUDING THE RELIEF OF THE POOR OR UNPRIVILEGED; THE PROMOTION OF SOCIAL WELFARE; AND THE ADVANCEMENT OF EDUCATION, RELIGION, AND SCIENCE. NOTE IT DOES NOT EXPLICITLY ADDRESS THE ACTIVITIES OF HOSPITALS. IN THE ABSENCE OF EXPLICIT STATUTORY OR REGULATORY REQUIREMENTS APPLYING THE TERM ""CHARITABLE"" TO HOSPITALS, IT HAS BEEN LEFT TO THE IRS TO DETERMINE THE CRITERIA HOSPITALS MUST MEET TO QUALIFY AS IRC 501(C)(3) CHARITABLE ORGANIZATIONS. THE ORIGINAL STANDARD WAS KNOWN AS THE CHARITY CARE STANDARD. THIS STANDARD WAS REPLACED BY THE IRS WITH THE COMMUNITY BENEFIT STANDARD WHICH IS THE CURRENT STANDARD. CHARITY CARE STANDARD IN 1956, THE IRS ISSUED REVENUE RULING 56-185, WHICH ADDRESSED THE REQUIREMENTS HOSPITALS NEEDED TO MEET IN ORDER TO QUALIFY FOR IRC 501(C)(3) STATUS. ONE OF THESE REQUIREMENTS IS KNOWN AS THE ""CHARITY CARE STANDARD."" UNDER THE STANDARD, A HOSPITAL MUST PROVIDE, TO THE EXTENT OF ITS FINANCIAL ABILITY, FREE OR REDUCED-COST CARE TO PATIENTS WHO CANNOT PAY FOR SUCH SERVICES. A HOSPITAL THAT EXPECTED FULL PAYMENT DID NOT, ACCORDING TO THE RULING, PROVIDE CHARITY CARE BASED ON THE FACT THAT SOME PATIENTS ULTIMATELY FAILED TO PAY. THE RULING EMPHASIZED THAT A LOW LEVEL OF CHARITY CARE DID NOT NECESSARILY MEAN THAT A HOSPITAL HAD FAILED TO MEET THE REQUIREMENT SINCE THAT LEVEL COULD REFLECT ITS FINANCIAL ABILITY TO PROVIDE SUCH CARE. THE RULING ALSO NOTED THAT PUBLICLY SUPPORTED COMMUNITY HOSPITALS WOULD NORMALLY QUALIFY AS CHARITABLE ORGANIZATIONS BECAUSE THEY SERVE THE ENTIRE COMMUNITY AND A LOW LEVEL OF CHARITY CARE WOULD NOT AFFECT A HOSPITAL'S EXEMPT STATUS IF IT WAS DUE TO THE SURROUNDING COMMUNITY'S LACK OF CHARITABLE DEMANDS. COMMUNITY BENEFIT STANDARD IN 1969, THE IRS ISSUED REVENUE RULING 69-545, WHICH ""REMOVED"" FROM REVENUE RULING 56-185 ""THE REQUIREMENTS RELATING TO CARING FOR PATIENTS WITHOUT CHARGE OR AT RATES BELOW COST."" UNDER THE STANDARD DEVELOPED IN REVENUE RULING 69-545, WHICH IS KNOWN AS THE ""COMMUNITY BENEFIT STANDARD,"" HOSPITALS ARE JUDGED ON WHETHER THEY PROMOTE THE HEALTH OF A BROAD CLASS OF INDIVIDUALS IN THE COMMUNITY. THE RULING INVOLVED A HOSPITAL THAT ONLY ADMITTED INDIVIDUALS WHO COULD PAY FOR THE SERVICES (BY THEMSELVES, PRIVATE INSURANCE, OR PUBLIC PROGRAMS SUCH AS MEDICARE), BUT OPERATED A FULL-TIME EMERGENCY ROOM THAT WAS OPEN TO EVERYONE. THE IRS RULED THAT THE HOSPITAL QUALIFIED AS A CHARITABLE ORGANIZATION BECAUSE IT PROMOTED THE HEALTH OF PEOPLE IN ITS COMMUNITY. THE IRS REASONED THAT BECAUSE THE PROMOTION OF HEALTH WAS A CHARITABLE PURPOSE ACCORDING TO THE GENERAL LAW OF CHARITY, IT FELL WITHIN THE ""GENERALLY ACCEPTED LEGAL SENSE"" OF THE TERM ""CHARITABLE,"" AS REQUIRED BY THE DEPARTMENT OF TREASURY REG. 1.501(C)(3)-1(D)(2). THE IRS RULING STATED THAT THE PROMOTION OF HEALTH, LIKE THE RELIEF OF POVERTY AND THE ADVANCEMENT OF EDUCATION AND RELIGION, IS ONE OF THE PURPOSES IN THE GENERAL LAW OF CHARITY THAT IS DEEMED BENEFICIAL TO THE COMMUNITY AS A WHOLE EVEN THOUGH THE CLASS OF BENEFICIARIES ELIGIBLE TO RECEIVE A DIRECT BENEFIT FROM ITS ACTIVITIES DOES NOT INCLUDE ALL MEMBERS OF THE COMMUNITY, SUCH AS INDIGENT MEMBERS OF THE COMMUNITY, PROVIDED THAT THE CLASS IS NOT SO SMALL THAT ITS RELIEF IS NOT OF BENEFIT TO THE COMMUNITY. THE IRS CONCLUDED THAT THE HOSPITAL WAS ""PROMOTING THE HEALTH OF A CLASS OF PERSONS THAT IS BROAD ENOUGH TO BENEFIT THE COMMUNITY"" BECAUSE ITS EMERGENCY ROOM WAS OPEN TO ALL AND IT PROVIDED CARE TO EVERYONE WHO COULD PAY, WHETHER DIRECTLY OR THROUGH THIRD-PARTY REIMBURSEMENT. OTHER CHARACTERISTICS OF THE HOSPITAL THAT THE IRS HIGHLIGHTED INCLUDED THE FOLLOWING: ITS SURPLUS FUNDS WERE USED TO IMPROVE PATIENT CARE, EXPAND HOSPITAL FACILITIES, AND ADVANCE MEDICAL TRAINING, EDUCATION AND RESEARCH; IT WAS CONTROLLED BY A BOARD OF TRUSTEES THAT CONSISTED OF INDEPENDENT CIVIC LEADERS; AND HOSPITAL MEDICAL STAFF PRIVILEGES WERE AVAILABLE TO ALL QUALIFIED PHYSICIANS. THE AMERICAN HOSPITAL ASSOCIATION (""AHA"") FEELS THAT MEDICARE UNDERPAYMENTS (SHORTFALL) AND BAD DEBT ARE COMMUNITY BENEFIT AND THUS INCLUDABLE ON THE FORM 990, SCHEDULE H, PART I. THIS ORGANIZATION AGREES WITH THE AHA'S POSITION. AS OUTLINED IN THE AHA'S LETTER TO THE IRS DATED AUGUST 21, 2007 WITH RESPECT TO THE FIRST PUBLISHED DRAFT OF THE NEW FORM 990 AND SCHEDULE H, THE AHA FELT THAT THE IRS SHOULD INCORPORATE THE FULL VALUE OF THE COMMUNITY BENEFIT THAT HOSPITALS PROVIDE BY COUNTING MEDICARE UNDERPAYMENTS (SHORTFALL) AS QUANTIFIABLE COMMUNITY BENEFIT FOR THE FOLLOWING REASONS: - PROVIDING CARE FOR THE ELDERLY AND SERVING MEDICARE PATIENTS IS AN ESSENTIAL PART OF THE COMMUNITY BENEFIT STANDARD - MEDICARE, LIKE MEDICAID, DOES NOT PAY THE FULL COST OF CARE. FROM THE LATEST DATA PROVIDED BY THE AHA, AS OF 2017, MEDICARE REIMBURSES HOSPITALS ONLY 87 CENTS FOR EVERY DOLLAR THEY SPEND TO TAKE CARE OF MEDICARE PATIENTS. - MANY MEDICARE BENEFICIARIES, LIKE THEIR MEDICAID COUNTERPARTS, ARE POOR. MORE THAN 42 PERCENT OF MEDICARE SPENDING IS FOR BENEFICIARIES WHOSE INCOME IS BELOW 200 PERCENT OF THE FEDERAL POVERTY LEVEL. MANY OF THOSE MEDICARE BENEFICIARIES ARE ALSO ELIGIBLE FOR MEDICAID -- SO CALLED ELIGIBLE."" THERE IS EVERY COMPELLING PUBLIC POLICY REASON TO TREAT MEDICARE AND MEDICAID UNDERPAYMENTS SIMILARLY FOR PURPOSES OF A HOSPITAL'S COMMUNITY BENEFIT AND INCLUDE THESE COSTS ON FORM 990, SCHEDULE H, PART I. MEDICARE UNDERPAYMENT MUST BE SHOULDERED BY THE HOSPITAL IN ORDER TO CONTINUE TREATING THE COMMUNITY'S ELDERLY AND POOR. THESE UNDERPAYMENTS REPRESENT A REAL COST OF SERVING THE COMMUNITY AND SHOULD COUNT AS A QUANTIFIABLE COMMUNITY BENEFIT. BOTH THE AHA AND THIS ORGANIZATION ALSO FEEL THAT PATIENT BAD DEBT IS A COMMUNITY BENEFIT AND THUS INCLUDABLE ON THE FORM 990, SCHEDULE H, PART I. LIKE MEDICARE UNDERPAYMENT (SHORTFALLS), THERE ALSO ARE COMPELLING REASONS THAT PATIENT BAD DEBT SHOULD BE COUNTED AS QUANTIFIABLE COMMUNITY BENEFIT AS FOLLOWS: - A SIGNIFICANT MAJORITY OF BAD DEBT IS ATTRIBUTABLE TO LOW-INCOME PATIENTS, WHO, FOR MANY REASONS, DECLINE TO COMPLETE THE FORMS REQUIRED TO ESTABLISH ELIGIBILITY FOR HOSPITALS' CHARITY CARE OR THOSE WHO DO NOT PAY ALL, OR A PORTION OF THE ALREADY DISCOUNTED BILLED AMOUNTS UNDER OUR FINANCIAL ASSISTANCE POLICY. A 2006 CONGRESSIONAL BUDGET OFFICE (""CBO"") REPORT, NONPROFIT HOSPITALS AND THE PROVISION OF COMMUNITY BENEFITS, CITED TWO STUDIES INDICATING THAT ""THE GREAT MAJORITY OF BAD DEBT WAS ATTRIBUTABLE TO PATIENTS WITH INCOMES BELOW 200% OF THE FEDERAL POVERTY LINE."" - THE REPORT ALSO NOTED THAT A SUBSTANTIAL PORTION OF BAD DEBT IS PENDING CHARITY CARE. UNLIKE BAD DEBT IN OTHER INDUSTRIES, HOSPITAL BAD DEBT IS COMPLICATED BY THE FACT THAT HOSPITALS FOLLOW THEIR MISSION TO THE COMMUNITY AND TREAT EVERY PATIENT THAT COMES THROUGH THEIR EMERGENCY DEPARTMENT, REGARDLESS OF ABILITY TO PAY. PATIENTS WHO HAVE OUTSTANDING BILLS ARE NOT TURNED AWAY, UNLIKE OTHER INDUSTRIES. BAD DEBT IS FURTHER COMPLICATED BY THE AUDITING INDUSTRY'S STANDARDS ON REPORTING CHARITY CARE. MANY PATIENTS CANNOT OR DO NOT PROVIDE THE NECESSARY, EXTENSIVE DOCUMENTATION REQUIRED TO BE DEEMED CHARITY CARE BY AUDITORS. AS A RESULT, ROUGHLY 40% OF BAD DEBT IS PENDING CHARITY CARE. THE CBO CONCLUDED THAT ITS FINDINGS ""SUPPORT THE VALIDITY OF THE USE OF UNCOMPENSATED CARE [BAD DEBT AND CHARITY CARE] AS A MEASURE OF COMMUNITY BENEFIT"" ASSUMING THE FINDINGS ARE GENERALIZABLE NATIONWIDE; THE EXPERIENCE OF HOSPITALS AROUND THE NATION REINFORCES THAT THEY ARE GENERALIZABLE. AS OUTLINED BY THE AHA, DESPITE THE HOSPITAL'S BEST EFFORTS AND DUE DILIGENCE, PATIENT BAD DEBT IS A PART OF THE HOSPITAL'S MISSION AND CHARITABLE PURPOSES. BAD DEBT REPRESENTS PART OF THE BURDEN HOSPITALS SHOULDER IN SERVING ALL"

IT IS THE POLICY OF HOLY NAME MEDICAL CENTER AND ITS SUBSIDIARIES TO TREAT ALL PATIENTS EQUALLY REGARDLESS OF INSURANCE AND THEIR ABILITY TO PAY. ADDITIONALLY, HNMC IS COMMITTED TO BILL PATIENTS AND INSURANCE CARRIERS IN A MANNER THAT IS UNDERSTANDABLE, PROFESSIONAL, COMPASSIONATE AND IN COMPLIANCE WITH ALL STATE, LOCAL AND FEDERAL RULES INCLUDING INTERNAL REVENUE CODE SECTION 501(R). IT IS THE INTENTION THAT THE BILLING AND COLLECTION POLICY BE CONSISTENT WITH HNMC'S FINANCIAL ASSISTANCE POLICY (""FAP"") AND ANY INCONSISTENCIES SHALL BE GUIDED BY THE FAP AND APPLIED IN A MANNER THAT BENEFITS THE PATIENT. HNMC WILL FOLLOW THE FOLLOWING PROCEDURES WHEN PURSUING BILLING AND COLLECTION ACTIONS: (1) PATIENTS SHALL BE REGISTERED IN THE HOSPITAL'S INFORMATION SYSTEM IN A MANNER THAT ENSURES THE CAPTURE OF THE INFORMATION NECESSARY TO EFFECTIVELY PROVIDE MEDICALLY NECESSARY CARE AND TO PROFESSIONALLY BILL FOR SERVICES RENDERED; (2) AFTER SERVICES ARE RENDERED THE PATIENTS OR GUARANTOR'S INSURANCE (IF ANY) SHALL BE BILLED. IF THE PATIENT HAS NO INSURANCE AND WAS REGISTERED SELF-PAY THE BILL FOR SERVICES WILL BE ADJUSTED IN ACCORDANCE WITH THE HOSPITAL'S FAP; (3) THE HOSPITAL WILL MAKE REASONABLE EFFORTS TO COLLECT FROM AN INSURANCE CARRIER PRIOR TO BILLING THE PATIENT FOR SERVICES RENDERED.

IF THESE EFFORTS ARE NOT SUCCESSFUL THEN THE ACCOUNT MAY BE CHANGED TO A SELF-PAY ACCOUNT; (4) AFTER THE ACCOUNT, OR ANY PORTION OF SUCH ACCOUNT, IS DEEMED SELF-PAY THE HOSPITAL, OR IT'S DESIGNATED AGENT, WILL BILL THE PATIENT OR GUARANTOR FOR THE REMAINING BALANCE ON THE ACCOUNT; (5) ACCOUNTS THAT ARE DEEMED SELF-PAY WILL RECEIVE UP TO FOUR STATEMENTS AND/OR NOTICES ASKING THAT THE ACCOUNT BALANCE BE PAID; (6) AFTER EXHAUSTING REASONABLE EFFORTS OVER A PERIOD OF UP TO 120 DAYS TO COLLECT A SELF-PAY BALANCE, THE HOSPITAL MAY REFER THE ACCOUNT TO A COLLECTION AGENCY. SUCH REFERRAL SHALL NOT BE DEEMED TO BE AN EXTRAORDINARY COLLECTION ACTION (""ECA""); (7) AN ACCOUNT WITH A COLLECTION AGENCY SHALL GENERALLY BE PURSUED UP TO 180 DAYS UNLESS, AFTER CONSULTING WITH THE HOSPITAL, IT IS DETERMINED TO MAINTAIN AN ACCOUNT BEYOND THAT TIMEFRAME. IF IT IS DETERMINED BY THE HOSPITAL'S PATIENT FINANCIAL SERVICES DEPARTMENT THAT THE ACCOUNT REQUIRES AN ECA, AND SUCH ACCOUNT MEETS THE REQUIREMENTS OF INTERNAL REVENUE CODE SECTION 501(R), INCLUDING BUT NOT LIMITED TO WAITING A MINIMUM OF 120 DAYS AFTER THE FIRST POST DISCHARGE BILL TO COMMENCE ECA ACTIVITIES, THE AGENCY SHALL NOTIFY THE PATIENT IN WRITING A MINIMUM OF 30 DAYS PRIOR TO COMMENCING ECA. SUCH NOTIFICATION SHALL INCLUDE A COPY OF THE HOSPITALS PLAIN LANGUAGE SUMMARY OF THE FAP ALONG WITH A STATEMENT AS TO WHICH ECA'S THE AGENCY MAY BE TAKING. IF WITHIN THE 30 DAY NOTICE PERIOD THE PATIENT REQUESTS FINANCIAL ASSISTANCE, AND THE ACCOUNT IS NOT OLDER THAN 240 DAYS FROM THE FIRST POST DISCHARGE BILL, THEN THE PATIENT SHALL BE GIVEN TIME TO APPLY FOR FINANCIAL ASSISTANCE BEFORE ANY ECAS MAY BE INITIATED. IN THE EVENT THAT AN ECA HAS BEEN INITIATED AND THE ACCOUNT IS NOT OLDER THAN 240 DAYS FROM THE FIRST POST DISCHARGE BILLING DATE AND THE PATIENT REQUESTS FINANCIAL ASSISTANCE THEN THE ECA WILL BE SUSPENDED TO ALLOW FOR THE PATIENT TO APPLY FOR FINANCIAL ASSISTANCE. THE FIRST POST DISCHARGE BILL SHALL BE THE FIRST BILL A PATIENT RECEIVES FOR SERVICES REGARDLESS IF SERVICES ARE ONGOING.

HNMC'S SECONDARY SERVICE AREA (""SSA"") INCLUDES 17 MUNICIPALITIES IN BERGEN COUNTY AND 2 MUNICIPALITIES IN HUDSON COUNTY. TOGETHER, THE PSA AND SSA ACCOUNT FOR APPROXIMATELY 80 PERCENT OF THE MEDICAL CENTER'S ADMISSION VOLUME. AS THE SOLE CATHOLIC HOSPITAL IN AN AREA THAT IS ESTIMATED AT MORE THAN 50% ROMAN CATHOLIC, HNMC ALSO DRAWS FROM TOWNS WELL BEYOND BOTH THE PSA AND SSA. THE MAJORITY OF PSA TOWNS HAVE AN AVERAGE POPULATION OF 27,500, AND ARE LOCATED IN THE SOUTHERN HALF OF BERGEN COUNTY. OVERALL, THE SERVICE AREA IS 44% HISPANIC, ALTHOUGH THE PROPORTIONS DIFFER MARKEDLY BETWEEN BERGEN AND HUDSON: 76% OF THE RESIDENTS OF BERGEN PSA TOWNS ARE NOT HISPANIC; WHILE THE FOUR HUDSON COUNTY TOWNS TOGETHER COUNT 76% OF THEIR RESIDENTS AS HISPANIC. THE RACIAL MIX OF THE PSA IS APPROXIMATELY 60% WHITE, 22% ASIAN, 10% BLACK, AND 8% OTHER, INCLUDING MULTI-RACIAL PERSONS. CERTAIN TOWNS IN THE REGION ARE HEAVILY KOREAN; KOREAN/ASIAN PRESENCE IS MUCH LESS PRONOUNCED IN THE FOUR HUDSON COUNTY TOWNS. THE BROAD AGE MAKE-UP OF THE PRIMARY SERVICE AREA INCLUDES 23% AGED UP TO 19; 50% AGED 20-54; AND 27% AGED 55 AND OLDER. THE LAST CATEGORY IS PROJECTED TO SEE THE MOST SIGNIFICANT GROWTH DURING THE NEXT FIFTEEN YEARS. WITH THE EXCEPTION OF TWO HUDSON COUNTY TOWNS, ALL SSA ZIP CODES ARE LOCATED THROUGHOUT BERGEN COUNTY. THE TOWNS IN THIS SERVICE AREA ARE MUCH SMALLER THAN THOSE OF THE PSA, AVERAGING ONLY 14,000 RESIDENTS EACH. IN STARK CONTRAST TO THE LARGELY HISPANIC HUDSON COUNTY PSA TOWNS, THE TWO HUDSON SSA TOWNS ARE ONLY 20% HISPANIC. THE OVERALL RACIAL MIX OF THE SERVICE AREA IS 76% WHITE, 13% ASIAN, 4% BLACK, AND 7% OTHER, INCLUDING MULTI-RACIAL PERSONS. THE OVERALL KOREAN PRESENCE IS SIGNIFICANT, BUT ONLY HALF THAT SEEN IN THE PRIMARY SERVICE AREA. THE AREA'S AGE MIX IS SIMILAR TO THE PSA, WITH 23% AGED UP TO 19; 51% AGED 20-54; AND 26% AGED 55 AND OLDER. THE MEDICAL CENTER'S SERVICE AREA IS PRIMARILY SUBURBAN, WITH MANY RESIDENTS WORKING OUTSIDE BERGEN COUNTY IN PLACES SUCH AS NEW YORK CITY. HOWEVER, THERE ARE LARGE EMPLOYERS IN THE SERVICE AREA, E.G., OTHER HOSPITALS, A LARGE SPORTS CHAIN, A LARGE COMMUNICATIONS FIRM, A LARGE PHARMACEUTICAL FIRM, AND A LARGE COMMERCIAL LABORATORY. RESIDENTS OF HNMC'S SERVICE AREA ARE ALSO SERVED BY ANOTHER COMMUNITY HOSPITAL AND A TERTIARY CARE FACILITY WITH TRAUMA SERVICES. HNMC'S PSA COVERS A MAJORITY OF THE TOWNS SERVICED BY THE OTHER COMMUNITY HOSPITAL, WHEREAS THE TERTIARY CARE FACILITY'S PRIMARY SERVICE AREA ALSO INCLUDES MANY TOWNS TO THE WEST THAT ARE NOT PART OF HNMC'S SERVICE AREA. GIVEN THE NUMBER OF SERVICE AREA RESIDENTS WHO WORK IN NEARBY NEW YORK CITY, IT IS NOT SURPRISING THAT A SMALL PORTION OF THESE RESIDENTS ALSO RECEIVE THEIR HEALTHCARE IN MANHATTAN. WHILE THE SERVICE AREA IS PREDOMINANTLY NON-HISPANIC CAUCASIAN, BOTH HISPANICS (OF ANY RACE) AND ASIAN POPULATIONS (PRINCIPALLY KOREAN) ARE THE FASTEST GROWING GROUPS. IN RESPONSE, THE MEDICAL CENTER HAS PROGRAMS ADDRESSING THESE GROUPS' NEEDS, AND PHYSICIANS AND NURSES FLUENT IN THE APPLICABLE LANGUAGES. IN 2008, APPROXIMATELY 75 KOREAN PHYSICIANS JOINED THE MEDICAL STAFF, ADDING TO THE NEED FOR STAFF AND SERVICES TO MEET THIS GROWING SEGMENT OF THE COMMUNITY. IN 2014, THE MEDICAL CENTER EXPANDED ITS KOREAN MEDICAL PROGRAM TO INCLUDE A FOCUS ON CHINESE AND FILIPINO RESIDENTS AS WELL, RENAMING THE SERVICE ""ASIAN HEALTH SERVICES."""

THE CHIW IS MADE UP OF REPRESENTATIVES FROM EACH HOSPITAL AS WELL AS PUBLIC HEALTH EXPERTS FROM THE MCDPH AND COMMUNITY MEMBER EXPERTS FROM FLHSA. IN ADDITION TO THE CHIW, SEVERAL OTHER ORGANIZATIONS COLLABORATED IN THE DEVELOPMENT OF THE CHNA. THESE ORGANIZATIONS AND PROGRAMS INCLUDE: THE CENTER FOR COMMUNITY HEALTH; THE GREATER ROCHESTER CHAMBER OF COMMERCE; THE SMOKING AND HEALTH ACTION COALITION; CENTER FOR TOBACCO FREE FINGER LAKES; NATIONAL CENTER FOR DEAF HEALTH RESEARCH; ROCHESTER-MONROE ANTI-POVERTY INITIATIVE; DELIVERY SYSTEM REFORM INCENTIVE PAYMENT (DSRIP) PROGRAM; AND TRANSFORMING PRIMARY CARE DELIVERY: MONROE COUNTY CMMI GRANT. THE MONROE COUNTY CHNA BEGAN WITH A REVIEW OF THE 2013 CHNA AND THE STATE-REQUIRED PROGRESS REPORT OF 2015 OF THE COMMUNITY HEALTH IMPROVEMENT PLAN BASED ON THE 2013 CHNA. THE PRIMARY CONSISTENT SOURCE OF DATA USED TO PRIORITIZE THE HEALTH NEEDS OF OUR COMMUNITY WAS THE COUNTY LEVEL DASHBOARDS OF THE NEW YORK STATE PREVENTION AGENDA. IN ADDITION, OTHER KEY SOURCES OF DATA INCLUDED:- MORTALITY AND NATALITY DATA: NEW YORK STATE BIRTH AND DEATH FILES- MORTALITY DATA FROM THE OFFICE OF THE MEDICAL EXAMINER, MONROE COUNTY- STATEWIDE PLANNING AND RESEARCH COOPERATIVE SYSTEMS (SPARCS) FILES, BASED ON HOSPITAL DISCHARGES AND EMERGENCY ROOM VISITS- MONROE COUNTY YOUTH RISK BEHAVIOR SURVEY (YRBS)- MONROE COUNTY YOUTH RISK BEHAVIOR SURVEY DATA- LOCAL MONROE COUNTY BLOOD PRESSURE REGISTRY DATA OF PATIENTS DIAGNOSED WITH HYPERTENSION AND SOME IDENTITY PROTECTED ELECTRONIC MEDICAL RECORD INFORMATION- COUNTY HEALTH RANKINGS AND ROADMAPS- NYS PREVENTION AGENDA DASHBOARD 2013-2018- ACT ROCHESTER FOR DATA RELATED TO THE SOCIAL DETERMINANTS OF HEALTH- MONROE COUNTY ADULT HEALTH SURVEY THE CHIW REVIEWED DATA FROM EACH OF THESE SOURCES TO IDENTIFY INDICATORS WHERE MONROE COUNTY SCORED WORSE THAN THE NYS AVERAGE AND/OR WHERE THEY DID NOT MEET THE PREVENTION AGENDA TARGETS. FINALLY, NEW DATA SOURCES WERE REVIEWED INCLUDING ACCIDENTAL DEATHS RELATED TO HEROIN/FENTANYL, AND ADVERSE CHILDHOOD EXPERIENCES FROM THE 2014-2015 MONROE COUNTY YOUTH RISK BEHAVIOR SURVEY. THE CHIW IDENTIFIED 44 COUNTY LEVEL COMMUNITY HEALTH INDICATORS SPANNING FIVE FOCUS AREAS WHERE MONROE COUNTY DID NOT MEET THE PREVENTION AGENDA TARGETS AND AN ADDITIONAL 13 HIGH NEED HEALTH TOPIC AREAS FROM THE FROM THE MONROE COUNTY YOUTH RISK BEHAVIOR SURVEY. ALL MEMBERS OF THE CHIW ARE CRITICALLY AWARE OF THE DISPARITIES THAT EXIST IN OUR COMMUNITY FOR VIRTUALLY EVERY HEALTH OUTCOME BASED ON RACE, ETHNICITY AND SOCIOECONOMIC STATUS INCLUDING POVERTY, INCOME AND EDUCATION. SEVERAL HEALTH DISPARITIES WERE IDENTIFIED WITHIN THE DATA REVIEWED. AS A RESULT, THE CHIW EXPLORED DISPARITY EXTENSIVELY WITH THE ASSISTANCE OF REPORTS PUBLISHED BY FLHSA THAT HIGHLIGHT SIGNIFICANT HEALTH DISPARITIES IN SOCIOECONOMICALLY DISADVANTAGED AREAS OF THE CITY OF ROCHESTER. THE CHIW CONSIDERED THIS INFORMATION IN ITS ASSESSMENT AND DETERMINATION OF PRIORITY AREAS WITHIN THE CHNA. THE PROCESS FOR PRIORITIZING COMMUNITY HEALTH NEEDS AND SERVICES WAS DETERMINED THROUGH LISTENING TO THE OPINIONS OF MEMBERS OF CHIW AS WELL AS LEADERS FROM DSRIP AND SEVERAL COMMUNITY HEALTH EXPERTS. A PRIORITIZATION TOOL WAS DEVELOPED TO ALLOW MEMBERS TO RANK IDENTIFIED HEALTH ISSUES BASED ON:- IMPORTANCE - NUMBER OF PEOPLE AFFECTED, HOW MUCH DISABILITY AND ILLNESS IS CAUSED BY THE ISSUE AND THE LONG TERM IMPACT ON HEALTH?- LIKELIHOOD OF IMPACTFUL SUCCESS - WILL THIS RESULT IN SUBSTANTIAL HEALTH IMPROVEMENT IN 3 - 5 YEARS?- COMMUNITY SUPPORT - HOW MUCH SUPPORT IS THERE AMONGST COMMUNITY LEADERS, PARTNER ORGANIZATIONS AND RESIDENTS?- HOSPITAL SUPPORT - HOW MUCH SUPPORT IS THERE AMONGST HOSPITAL LEADERS?- FILL A GAP - WILL THIS FILL A GAP IN SERVICES/INITIATIVES CURRENTLY PROVIDED IN MONROE COUNTY? - LARGE HEALTH DISPARITY - DOES THIS INITIATIVE ADDRESS AN IMPORTANT DISPARITY? COMMUNITY INPUT WAS STRONGLY CONSIDERED THROUGHOUT THIS PROCESS. THE CHIW REVIEWED RESULTS FROM VARIOUS PROJECTS THAT RECENTLY GATHERED COMMUNITY INPUT RELATED TO HEALTH ISSUES AFFECTING RESIDENTS. CHIW ALSO CONSIDERED SERVICES ALREADY BEING PROVIDED IN THE COMMUNITY, AND HOW WE COULD BEST DEVELOP SYNERGY WITH EXISTING PROCESSES. ONE FINAL STEP WAS CONDUCTED TO ASSURE ADEQUATE COMMUNITY INPUT. A SURVEY WAS CONDUCTED (VIA SURVEY MONKEY) OF HOSPITAL LEADERSHIP AND ANYONE ELSE THE CHIW FELT NEEDED TO BE HEARD. THE SURVEY PROVIDED A DETAILED LIST OF 12 HEALTH AREAS OF NEED FOR MONROE COUNTY AND INCLUDED A LIST OF EVIDENCE BASED INTERVENTIONS FOR EACH. THE SURVEY UTILIZED THE SAME QUESTIONS AS THE PRIORITIZATION TOOL USED BY THE CHIW. THE RESULTS WERE TABULATED AND REVIEWED AS PART OF THE OVERALL ASSESSMENT PROCESS. OVERALL, AFTER CONSIDERING THE OPINIONS OF THE CHIW MEMBERS, THE COMMUNITY, THE STATE OF NEW YORK AND THE HEALTH DATA, THE FOLLOWING PRIORITIES WERE IDENTIFIED: PREVENT CHRONIC DISEASE:1. TOBACCO USE2. HEART HEALTH PROMOTE HEALTHY WOMEN, INFANTS AND CHILDREN3. UNPLANNED PREGNANCY4. FOOD INSECURITY AMONG FAMILIES PROMOTE MENTAL HEALTH AND PREVENT SUBSTANCE ABUSE5.

The Brooklyn community helped to select the interventions via key informant meetings and a Community Health Survey, which appeared on NewYork-Presbyterian/Brooklyn Methodist Hospitals website homepage, www.nym.org. The survey also appeared on NYP/BMHs social media channels and in the spring/summer 2016 edition of NYP/BMHs community health magazine, Thrive, which is mailed to 250,000 households in Brooklyn. In addition to the input sought from the community, the programs and strategies developed by NYP/BMH as part of its Community Service Plan will be targeted to at-risk populations as identified in the Hospitals Community Health Needs Assessment. The interventions and strategies were determined by reviewing results from NYP/BMHs Community Health Survey, along with the input derived from key informant meetings. State, county and zip code level statistical data were also reviewed. Finally, recommendations from the New York State Prevention Agenda Dashboard 2013-2017 were taken into consideration. The goal of the intervention for the Prevent Chronic Disease; focus on diabetes is to increase access to high-quality chronic disease preventive care and management in clinical and community settings by offering diabetes self-management education (DSME) classes for community residents in both English and Spanish, and educating Hospital staff members to become trainers and lead additional DSMEs. NYP/BMH anticipates that those who attend classes will gain confidence and better control in the management of their diabetes. Once our own staff is trained to lead these Stanford-modeled classes, the Hospital will have the capability to offer additional classes and impact even more members of the community who are living with diabetes. The first intervention for the Prevent Chronic Disease; focus on childhood obesity priority, which also falls under the prevention area of Promoting Healthy Women Infants and Children, is to adopt policies and practices designed to implement standards that will support breastfeeding, quality nutrition, increased physical activity and reduced screen time in early child care settings and to increase staff training, community support and reinforcement of these regulations and policies. The Hospital has joined New York Citys Breastfeeding Hospital Collaborative (NYC BHC) Cohort 3. As is the case for hospitals in the current NYCBHC, Cohort 3 will include in-person learning sessions, monthly action period webinars, semi-monthly coaching calls (participation as needed), mock assessments and site visits, access to a repository of free tools and resources to support pursuit of a Baby friendly designation, and more. A second intervention for the Prevent Chronic Disease, focus on childhood obesity priority is to create a program to help incorporate dance/exercise classes and nutrition education into the lives of pre-teens and their parents. Classes will be offered at the Brooklyn Childrens Museum in Crown Heights. NYP/BMH will use strategies derived from New York State Obesity Prevention Center for Excellence. The goal of the intervention for Promote a Healthy and Safe Environment; reducing fall risk among most vulnerable populations priority is to improve the design and maintenance of home environments to promote health and reduce related illness, by creating a Fall Prevention Program and disseminating Fall Prevention Kits, with tools to help seniors safeguard their homes. NYP/BMH will reference the CDCs Guide for EBPs to Prevent Falls. A second intervention is intended to reduce factors that increase the risk of falls, particularly among the elderly and young children by promoting community-based programs for fall prevention. NYP/BMH will reference the CDCs Guide for EBPs to Prevent Falls. The process measures used to track and evaluate the impact of the Prevent Chronic Disease; focus on diabetes priority include information retention quizzes, tracking attendance and attendee goal setting and monitoring achievements during and after each six-week Diabetes Self-Management Education session. The process measures used to track and evaluate the Prevent Chronic Disease; focus on childhood obesity priority include pre and post class surveys, weight and waist measurements recorded throughout the duration of classes, and attendance tracking. Results will be monitored during and after each dance/education series. The process measures used to track and evaluate the Promote a Healthy and Safe Environment; reducing fall risk among most vulnerable populations priority include polling senior citizens on regarding home safety measures in place and giving them kits to safeguard their homes. They will also be offered the opportunity to share stories on how theyve implemented the safety information that has been provided. To attempt a reduction in the number of admissions due to falls, the Hospital will administer surveys administered to treat and release patients who come to the Emergency Room for falls. 2018 Year-2 Update Summary Since the 2016 Community Health Needs Assessment, NewYork-Presbyterian Brooklyn Methodist Hospital (NYP/BMH) has undertaken several key initiatives to improve the health needs of the communities we serve. In 2018, we shifted one of our priorities from Prevent Chronic Disease: focus on childhood obesity/promoting healthy women infants and children to Prevent Chronic Disease: focus on increasing access to high-quality chronic disease preventive care and management in clinical and community settings. We had set out to provide exercise classes as an intervention with our original priority area, but space in a high-need neighborhood became hard to secure, so we shifted to an area where we could achieve measurable outcomes while still addressing chronic diseases in vulnerable communities."

201943179349309024,111631796,"Part VI, Line 4:","Community Information: This assessment and plan covers Kings County, New York, also known as the borough of Brooklyn. Although NYP/BMH is located in Park Slope and is an important healthcare, community service and economic anchor in the Park Slope neighborhood, it serves the entire borough of Brooklyn (Kings County). Brooklyn is the largest of the five boroughs that make up New York City. Indeed, if it were a separate city, Brooklyn would be the fourth largest in the United States. In 2014, Brooklyn had a total population of over 2.6 million people from a wide variety of ethnic and socioeconomic backgrounds. Of the total number of people in Brooklyn in 2014, 926,640 were white, 826,500 were black, 332,160 were Asian, Native American and Pacific Islanders and 526,110 were Latino. (Those reporting as Latino or Hispanic are of Spanish origin but may be of any race.) While the white and black populations have remained relatively stable, increasing only slightly as the Brooklyn population increased, the Latino population has increased by 13 percent (consistent with Brooklyns overall population increase) and the Asian, Native American and Pacific Island population has increased by 184 percent, far exceeding the overall Brooklyn increase. The demography of Brooklyn has changed radically since 1990, which is reflected in the ethnic breakdown of Hospital discharges over the past 25 years. At the turn of the 21st century, we were in a period of the largest influx of immigration to New York City since the early 1900s. According to the 2010 US census data, 37 percent of Brooklyns residents were born outside of the United States and 46 percent of the boroughs residents speak a language other than English in the home. What has made this wave of immigration to New York City especially unique is that the patterns of immigration are extremely diverse; of the various countries represented by Brooklyn residents, except for China (13 percent), no single one accounts for more than 10 percent of all first generation immigrants. New Yorks largest Afro-Caribbean community can be found in the Central Brooklyn neighborhoods of Crown Heights and Flatbush. Southwest Brooklyn (Bensonhurst and Bay Ridge), where Pakistani, Bangladeshi and Southeast Asian immigrants have merged with Russian and Chinese populations, houses the most diverse immigrant community. The number of Brooklyn men and women is fairly equal, at 47 percent and 53 percent respectively. Nearly 30 percent of Brookynites have earned a bachelors degree or higher and 78 percent hold a high school diploma. Twenty-two percent of the Brooklyn population lives below the poverty line. It is well known that the population, in general, is aging and, in Brooklyn, the highest increases in the population are in the baby boomer groups (23 percent among those between the ages of 35 and 54; 61 percent among those between the ages of 55 and 59 and 21 percent among those between the ages of 60 and 74). During the years since 1990, NYP/BMH which has seen an increase in its census of over 100 percent, (from 20,696 to 41,582 patients annually), has also increased its service to patients in every one of Brooklyns communities. In some cases, the increase within neighborhoods is truly remarkable; for example, while the increase in the population of patients from NYP/BMHs surrounding areas of Brooklyn Heights, Downtown Brooklyn and Park Slope, is noticeable, it shows a 431 percent increase in patients from the Bedford Stuyvesant and Crown Heights communities, a 363 percent increase from Flatbush/East Flatbush, a 210 percent increase in patients from Canarsie/Flatlands and an 88 percent increase in patients from Sheepshead Bay/Coney Island. In addition, very large increases are evident (although the total numbers are smaller) in the Greenpoint/Williamsburg and East New York neighborhoods."

This will be done in the following ways: Prevent Chronic Disease; focus on diabetes. At the end of each six-week diabetes self-management education (DSME) session data will be reviewed and assessed by IPRO and NYP/BMH. This will provide the opportunity to make mid-course corrections before a new DSME session is offered. For each new DSME session, NYP/BMH will utilize NYC DOHMHs Patient Referral Portal to list the classes. With this format, partners will be engaged at each new six 6-week session. 2017 update to Prevent Chronic Disease; focus on diabetes IPRO Everyone with Diabetes Counts-NY provided certified group facilitators. At the end of 2017 46 people completed (one of two) Diabetes Self-Management Education (DSME) class sessions and the majority reported more confidence in managing their diabetes. The organization has encountered a few challenges; the Spanish class did not get enough participants we have not yet been able to train our staff. 2018 update to Prevent Chronic Disease; focus on diabetes In terms of our progress to date with our focus on diabetes, we have successfully hosted two evidence-based Diabetes Self-Management Education (DSME) workshops, with our partners at IPROs Everyone with Diabetes Counts initiative. To date, 46 people have completed the (DSME) class sessions and the majority reported more confidence in managing their diabetes. We encountered some challenges in offering a Spanish-language class; we didnt have enough interest, so we were unable to host the Spanish class. In November of 2018, two hospital staff members received Master-Level training in Chronic Disease Self-Management (CDSM) and Diabetes SelfManagement Education (DSME). These employees will be training approximately 20 NYP hospital staff members in January 2019, as well as offering classes to community members. With the newly trained staff, we anticipate that we will be able to offer DSME classes to many of the vast and diverse populations that NYPs hospitals serve. Prevent Chronic Disease; focus on childhood obesity/Promote Healthy Women Infants & Children; focus on maternal and infant health. Dance & Nutrition Education Classes: For each session of dance classes, data will be reviewed and assessed by NYP/BMH. The data will be shared with the Brooklyn Childrens Museum (BCM), Investors Bank and DanceWave. NYM will also poll BCM and Dancewave to learn whether there are areas for improvement. This will apply to the next session of classes, and the cycle will continue throughout the course of the three-year CSP. 2017 update to Prevent Chronic Disease: focus on childhood obesity/promoting healthy women infants and children. Due to struggles finding partners and locations for classes, we have refocused our attention on a new priority area. Instead of focusing on Childhood Obesity, we will shift to address Hypertension in Adults through a new opportunity to implement the NYP HealthSmarts program at Bed Stuy churches. 2018 Update Prevent Chronic Disease: focus on childhood obesity/promoting healthy women infants and children Considering the many challenges we encountered with this intervention, we changed our focus to increasing access to high-quality chronic disease preventive care and management in clinical and community settings. Prevent Chronic Disease: focus on increasing access to high-quality chronic disease preventive care and management in clinical and community settings. Through a connection made with NYP Columbias evidence-based HeartSmarts program, we were able to recruit two of our partner churches for the training. Members from St. Georges Episcopal Church in Crown Heights and Pleasant Grove Tabernacle, in Bedford Stuyvesant were trained to offer HeartSmarts faith-based curriculum to teach their congregation members how to reduce hypertension and adopt healthier habits. Both churches hosted classes in Q4 of 2018, and both sustained steady class attendance. Pleasant Grove had 35 graduates and St. Georges is on track to graduate 25 participants in Q1 of 2019. Prevent Chronic Disease; focus on childhood obesity/Promote Healthy Women Infants & Children; focus on maternal and infant health. Focus on increased exclusive breastfeeding rates. Baby Friendly Status: The New York City Breastfeeding Hospital Collaborative has its own set of regulations and guidelines for progress tracking and reporting, to which NYP/BMH will adhere. 2017 Update to Prevent Chronic Disease; focus on childhood obesity/Promote Healthy Women Infants & Children; focus on maternal and infant health. Focus on increased exclusive breastfeeding rates. We have entered Dissemination Stage (Stage 3 of 4) of Baby-Friendly USA Journey. Almost 100 MCH staff members completed 15-hour (nursing) or 3-hour (MD) breastfeeding educational training. NYP/BMH has increased EBF rates by over 13% since 2013. We have a new opportunity for our program with Brooklyns Children Museum who has agreed to host an NYP/BMH-run Breastfeeding Support Group in Crown Heights. 2018 Update Promote Healthy Women, Infants and Children: focus on increasing exclusive breastfeeding rates. NYP/BMH has increased exclusive breastfeeding rates, however our rates hover between 37-40%. Our goal is to get our exclusive breastfeeding rates above 39.7% upon discharge. WIC representatives are ready to come educate in clinics and hospital, but our major referring WIC office is a Brooklyn Hospital affiliate, which poses an issue with credentialing in our hospital. Promote a Healthy and Safe Environment; reducing fall risk among most vulnerable populations: Fall Surveys in ER: The surveys will be conducted for every treat and release ER patient over 65 years of age. Survey data will be reviewed and shared with the environmental gerontologist and Emergency Medicine Department on a quarterly basis. Analysis of survey results will help to present if any mid-course corrections should be made. The Fall Prevention Program: Progress will be reviewed and shared with partners on a bi-annual basis, at which time it will be decided whether mid-course corrections should be made. 2017 update to promote a Healthy and Safe Environment; reducing fall risk among the most vulnerable populations. The program has progressed and at the end of 2017: 376 Survey of Adult Falls Evaluation (SAFE) were collected, 100 senior home safety kits were sent out and 4 NYP/BMH staff members trained in EBP for reducing falls. We had some challenges with data collection due to QTAC SUNY Albany (program created for data collection) was unable to process any intake forms in 2017. NYS DOH has offered to collect data in 2018. 2018 Updates Promote a Healthy and Safe Environment; reducing fall risk among the most vulnerable populations. We have been successful in conducting the SAFE (Survey of Adult Falls Evaluation) questionnaire in the Emergency Department. To date, we have collected 967 survey responses and have given out 200 Senior Home Safety kits. One Stepping On class was hosted in the fall of 2018, for which 8 seniors were trained by physical therapists and other health professionals in fall prevention. All participants had better mobility and increased self-confidence. While the course curriculum was well-received, the format was not conducive to being repeated by staff members whose roles are not dedicated to this type of work. We will revisit other evidence-based interventions for fall prevention in 2019, such as Tai Chi for Arthritis."

CareAlliance collects substantially all of its third-party insured receivables, which include receivables from governmental agencies. Collections are impacted by the economic ability of patients to pay and the effectiveness of collection efforts. Significant changes in payor mix, business office operations, economic conditions, or trends in federal and state governmental healthcare coverage could affect the collection of accounts receivable. CareAlliance also continually reviews overall reserve adequacy by monitoring historical cash collections as a percentage of trailing net revenue, as well as by analyzing current-period gross charges and admissions by payor classification, aged accounts receivable by payor, and days revenue outstanding."

SINCE COMPLETION OF THE CHNA, BRYAN HEALTH HAS EXPANDED ITS USE OF NURSE NAVIGATORS TO INCLUDE THREE ONCOLOGY NAVIGATORS THAT FOCUS ON PATIENTS WITH LUNG, BREAST, AND COLORECTAL CANCER. BRYAN ALSO PROVIDES PATIENT NAVIGATORS FOR ORTHOPEDICS AND PULMONARY DISEASES. AS PART OF BRYAN HEALTH, BRYAN HEART HAS ALSO IMPLEMENTED HEART FAILURE NURSE NAVIGATORS TO IDENTIFY POTENTIAL CARE GAPS THAT CAN LEAD TO READMISSIONS. THESE INDIVIDUALS ASSIST PATIENTS AND THEIR FAMILIES TO MAKE INFORMED HEALTH CARE DECISIONS AND ACCESS APPROPRIATE HEALTHCARE SERVICES. BRYAN HEALTH ALSO CONTINUES TO SUPPORT COMMUNITY HEALTH CENTERS, SUCH AS BLUESTEM HEALTH AND CLINIC WITH A HEART, THAT SERVE INDIVIDUALS THAT MIGHT NOT OTHERWISE BE ABLE TO AFFORD PRIMARY CARE SERVICES. Beginning in 2018, BRYAN HEALTH HAS MADE PROGRESS IN DEVELOPING THE INFRASTRUCTURE NEEDED TO CREATE A MEDICAL HOME WITH THE ROLLOUT OF MYCHART, THE PATIENT PORTAL TIED TO EPIC, BRYAN HEALTH'S NEW ELECTRONIC HEALTH RECORDS SYSTEM. TO PROVIDE ADDITIONAL ACCESS TO PRIMARY CARE SERVICES, BRYAN HEALTH ALSO HAS CONTINUED ITS EZVISIT SERVICE, WHICH IS A VIRTUAL CARE MODEL WITH 24/7 ACCESS TO A NEBRASKA BOARD CERTIFIED PHYSICIAN VIA COMPUTER OR MOBILE DEVICE. BRYAN'S ED CONNECTIONS PROGRAM CONTINUES to find medical homes for patients who have been using the emergency department for their primary care, help individuals who are unable to pay for certain approved prescriptions given in the emergency department, and donates medical equipment to people who are unable to afford or attain it. ED Connections also enacts a narcotic monitoring and diversion service for individuals who have been identified as inappropriately using the emergency department to obtain narcotics or controlled medications. WITHIN LANCASTER COUNTY AND BEYOND, BRYAN HEALTH OFFERS ONLINE, MOBILE, AND ON-SITE SCREENINGS TO IDENTIFY INDIVIDUALS WITH HIGH-RISK FOR CERTAIN CONDITIONS AND TO ENSURE THEY GET TIMELY ACCESS TO PREVENTATIVE CARE. A SCREENING THAT HAS BEEN EMBRACED IS FOR FAMILY MEMBERS OF PATIENTS WITH BICUSPID AORTIC VALVE (BAV). Close relatives of those diagnosed with BAV also are at risk for an aneurysm of the aortic root and ascending aorta. Early detection is critical since up to 40 percent of BAV patients will experience complications by the time they reach 50. To assist with the lack of mental health providers and services in the vast underserved areas of the state, Bryan Health offers behavioral health evaluations via telehealth to several emergency department providers across the state. By providing this service we assist with providing a quality evaluation and plan recommendations that reduce preventable inpatient admissions and assignment to other higher levels of care. BRYAN HEALTH ALSO PARTNERS WITH MANY CITY OF LINCOLN DEPARTMENTS AS WELL AS PRIVATE BUSINESSES TO PROVIDE MOBILE SCREENINGS, EDUCATION AND HEALTH FAIRS. ONE OF THE MAJOR ACTIONS THAT BRYAN HEALTH HAS TAKEN TO INCREASE ACCESS IS THE DECISION SEVERAL YEARS AGO TO PROVIDE AN ADDITIONAL SUBSIDY FOR HEALTH INSURANCE PREMIUMS FOR BRYAN HEALTH EMPLOYEES UNDER A CERTAIN WAGE LEVEL. THIS PROGRAM WAS CREATED BECAUSE A LARGE GROUP OF LOWER WAGE EMPLOYEES ELECTED NOT TO ENROLL IN BRYAN'S INSURANCE PLAN, AND ELECTED TO REMAIN UNINSURED DUE TO PREMIUM COSTS. THE ADDITIONAL SUBSIDY HAS PROVIDED ACCESS TO INSURANCE FOR CLOSE TO 400 EMPLOYEES AND THEIR DEPENDENTS ON AN ANNUAL BASIS. WE BELIEVE THIS IS A SMALL STEP TOWARD ASSISTING UNINSURED INDIVIDUALS IN OUR COMMUNITY AS INSURED INDIVIDUALS GENERALLY HAVE BETTER ACCESS TO SERVICES. DURING 2018, BRYAN MEDICAL CENTER PROVIDED LIFE-SAVING PROCEDURES AND MEDICATIONS FOR 9,365 INDIVIDUALS WHO WERE NOT ELIGIBLE FOR ANY GOVERNMENT OR STATE SUPPORT, AND DID NOT HAVE THE FINANCIAL RESOURCES TO PAY THEIR HEALTH CARE SERVICES. THERE ARE MANY REASONS BEHIND LACK OF ACCESS TO HEALTH CARE SERVICES; THE SHORTAGE OF HEALTH CARE PROFESSIONALS IS JUST ONE OF THESE REASONS. BRYAN HEALTH IS A HUGE SUPPORTER OF EDUCATION FOR HEALTH CARE PROFESSIONALS - INCLUDING ONGOING FINANCIAL SUPPORT FOR: 1) THE BRYAN COLLEGE OF HEALTH SCIENCES, WITH MORE THAN 710 STUDENTS ENROLLED IN GRADUATE AND UNDERGRADUATE DEGREE PROGRAMS THROUGH BRYAN'S SCHOOL OF NURSING, HEALTH PROFESSION AND NURSE ANESTHESIA PROGRAMS, AND 2) THE LINCOLN MEDICAL EDUCATION PARTNERSHIP RESIDENCY PROGRAM FOR FUTURE PRIMARY CARE PROVIDERS. IN ADDITION, BRYAN ALSO SERVES AS A CLINICAL TRAINING SITE FOR A LONG LIST OF HEALTH CARE DISCIPLINES; INCLUDING RADIOLOGY, LAB, PHYSICAL THERAPY, PHARMACY, EMTS AND PARAMEDICS, ETC. THIS COMMITMENT TO EDUCATION OF THE NEXT GENERATION OF HEALTH CARE PROFESSIONALS ULTIMATELY IMPROVES ACCESS TO HEALTHCARE IN OUR REGION. MADONNA IS THE DESIGNATED ORGANIZATION IN THE LINCOLN COMMUNITY THAT PROVIDES HANDICAP-ACCESSIBLE BUS TRANSPORTATION FOR COMMUNITY MEMBERS TO/FROM DOCTORS' APPOINTMENTS, THERAPY AND OTHER OUTPATIENT APPOINTMENTS. BRYAN PROVIDES AN ANNUAL CONTRIBUTION OF $25,000 FOR THESE SERVICES SO THAT FINANCIALLY CHALLENGED MEMBERS OF OUR COMMUNITY WILL HAVE ACCESS TO MEDICAL CARE. MANY PRIVATE PRACTICE PHYSICIANS IN LINCOLN HAVE ELECTED NOT TO SERVE MEDICAID AND/OR MEDICARE PATIENTS IN THEIR OUTPATIENT CLINICS FOR FINANCIAL REASONS. BRYAN PHYSICIAN NETWORK PHYSICIANS ACCEPT MEDICAID/MEDICARE PATIENTS INTO THEIR PRACTICE BY POLICY; THEREFORE, AS BRYAN PHYSICIAN NETWORK CONTINUES TO EXPAND WITHIN THE COMMUNITY, SO DOES ACCESS TO PHYSICIAN CARE FOR AREA MEDICAID/MEDICARE PATIENTS. IN JULY 2018, BRYAN PHYSICIAN NETWORK ESTABLISHED BRYAN NORTHPOINTE FAMILY MEDICINE WHICH INCLUDES A TEAM OF THREE FAMILY PRACTICE PHYSICIANS AND FOUR PHYSICIAN ASSISTANTS. Doctors Outpatient Surgery Center (DOSC) and Lincoln Digestive Health Center (LDHC) are joint ventures between Bryan Medical Center and area physician groups that began seeing patients in 2018. DOSC will provide a lower cost outpatient alternative to the community where general and specialty surgeries will be performed, including orthopedics, gynecology, podiatry, plastics and dental. LDHC will increase the capacity of lower cost gastrointestinal screenings (colonoscopies) and gastrointestinal services to the community. Over the last four years Bryan Medical Center has increased the number of staffed beds by 90 on both campuses to meet the community's demand. THE COMMUNITY HEALTH ENDOWMENT (CHE) IS THE DESIGNATED ORGANIZATION IN LINCOLN TO COORDINATE A WIDE VARIETY OF COMMUNITY HEALTH EFFORTS TO FURTHER THE HEALTH AND SAFETY OF THE COMMUNITY. CHE'S MISSION IS FOR LINCOLN TO BE THE HEALTHIEST CITY IN THE NATION. BRYAN FULLY SUPPORTS CHE's WORK. Continued Below."

By providing this service we assist with providing a quality evaluation and plan recommendations that reduce preventable inpatient admissions and assignment to other higher levels of care. IN A SPECIAL PROJECT, BRYAN HEALTH'S MENTAL HEALTH EMERGENCY DEPARTMENT HAS PARTNERED WITH SEVERAL COMMUNITY PROVIDERS TO CREATE COMMUNITY PLANS FOR AN IDENTIFIED HIGH USER PATIENT GROUP TO AIDE IN PREVENTING REPEAT HOSPITAL INPATIENT ADMISSIONS. Also in this area, Bryan Health utilizes peer specialists who hold three community wellness groups a week at no cost to the participants. This includes a separate group for ages 14-18. AS THE ONLY ACUTE CARE HOSPITAL IN LINCOLN PROVIDING BEHAVIORAL HEALTH SERVICES, BRYAN ACTIVELY ENGAGES WITH AREA PROVIDERS TO SUPPORT THE EXPANDED ROLE OF BEHAVIORAL HEALTH TREATMENT IN THE COMMUNITY AND REGION. BRYAN HAS MADE IT A PRIORITY TO SERVE AS A TRAINING SITE FOR COUNSELORS, SOCIAL WORKERS, NURSES, PHYSICIAN ASSISTANTS, AND PRIMARY CARE PHYSICIANS THROUGH THE LINCOLN MEDICAL EDUCATION PROGRAM, SOUTHEAST COMMUNITY COLLEGE, DOANE University, BRYAN COLLEGE OF HEALTH SCIENCES, UNIVERSITY OF NEBRASKA AND OTHER EDUCATIONAL INSTITUTIONS. ONLINE SCREENINGS FOR DEPRESSION, ANXIETY, POST-TRAUMATIC STRESS DISORDER, ALCOHOL ABUSE AND ADOLESCENT DEPRESSION ARE AVAILABLE AT NO COST TO THE PUBLIC ON THE BRYAN HEALTH WEBSITE. BRYAN HEALTH WORKS WITH OTHER LINCOLN PROVIDERS AND GROUPS ACROSS THE STATE TO ADDRESS GAPS AND SPECIAL NEEDS IN THE POPULATION AS WELL AS THOSE WHO ARE UNDERSERVED. THESE INCLUDE HEALTH 360 INTEGRATED HOME; THE BRIDGE BEHAVIORAL HEALTH TO IMPROVE COORDINATION OF CARE FOR CLIENTS REQUIRING EMERGENCY DETOXIFICATION; THE BEHAVIORAL HEALTH EDUCATION CENTER OF NEBRASKA FOR WORKFORCE DEVELOPMENT OF Behavioral Health Providers; and Nebraska Department of Health and Human Services.

BRYAN MEDICAL CENTER MENTAL HEALTH HAS BEEN A LEADER IN SUICIDE PREVENTION FOR OUR COMMUNITY AND STATE. ONE OF THE MANAGERS FOR BRYAN MENTAL HEALTH helped to start the Nebraska State Suicide Prevention Coalition in 1999 and continues to SERVE on the Executive Committee AS THE past CO-CHAIR OF THE NEBRASKA STATE SUICIDE PREVENTION COALITION AND SERVES ON THE LEADERSHIP GROUP of THE LINCOLN SUICIDE PREVENTION coalition. IN ADDITION, THIS BRYAN MENTAL HEALTH MANAGER PROVIDED LEADERSHIP IN DEVELOPING THE FIRST LOCAL OUTREACH TO SUICIDE SURVIVORS (LOSS) TEAM IN NEBRASKA AND IS ASSISTING WITH PROVIDING DIRECTION IN THE DEVELOPMENT OF LOSS TEAMS IN OTHER PARTS OF THE STATE. Additional teams have been developed in Omaha, Kearney, Norfolk and Chadron. Bryan is also working to start new LOSS teams in Scottsbluff, North Platte, Columbus, Seward, Grand Island/Hastings and Beatrice. DEVELOPING AND IMPLEMENTING THE LOSS TEAM WAS A COLLABORATIVE EFFORT IN WORKING WITH LAW ENFORCEMENT AND POLICE CHAPLAINS AS WELL AS OTHER COMMUNITY AND COUNTY AGENCIES. A LOSS TEAM IS A GROUP OF THREE PEOPLE WHO ARE ONCALL (TWO PEOPLE WHO HAVE LOST SOMEONE TO SUICIDE AND A CLINICIAN) AND THEY RESPOND TO FAMILIES WHO HAVE LOST SOMEONE TO SUICIDE AND PROVIDE RESOURCES. CONNECTING SUICIDE SURVIVORS TO OTHER SUICIDE SURVIVORS AND RESOURCES IS CONSIDERED SUICIDE POSTVENTION WHICH IS ALSO PREVENTION. In response to the growing presence and awareness of opioid misuse and abuse in the community and across the nation, Bryan Health created the Pain Management and Opioid Stewardship Program in summer 2018. Local pain management specialist Kelly Zach, MD leads a 24-member steering team to run the program. The team includes representation from medical staff, hospital administration, pharmacy, nursing, behavioral health, substance abuse, physical therapy and organizational quality. This ongoing program will evaluate and utilize evidence-based best practices to achieve safe and appropriate pain management, while reducing the risk of opioid addiction, overdose and deaths.

DURING THE FISCAL YEAR ENDED DECEMBER 31, 2018, Bryan Medical Center, CHI St. Elizabeth and the Lincoln-Lancaster County Health Department hosted meetings (or in one case, surveys sent via email) with representatives from public health partners and other non-profit organizations and coalitions, allowing them to provide updates and insights based on their particular areas of service or expertise. Then the group evaluated the 2015 CHNA's goals, priorities and objectives in detail, discussing the current situations in Lincoln and determining whether the goals were still relevant or appropriate as they had been originally laid out. Voting systems were used to determine whether objectives within a priority needed to be tweaked at a minor level, rewritten at a major level or left with no revisions. The four priority health needs identified in the Community Health Needs Assessment were Access to Care, Behavioral Health Care, Chronic Disease Prevention, and Injury Prevention. More than 70 members of the MAPP process came together across four meetings to review each goal separately. This process is outlined in the 2018 Community Health Needs Assessment. The assessment identifies the geographic area and population served, available health care resources, the methods with which the priority health needs were reviewed and adjusted. BRYAN USED THE PRIORITIES FROM THE COMMUNITY HEALTH NEEDS ASSESSMENT TO DEVELOP A DETAILED IMPLEMENTATION STRATEGY TO ENSURE THAT OUR STRENGTHS AND AVAILABLE RESOURCES ARE ALIGNED WITH THE HEALTH NEEDS OF OUR COMMUNITY. BRYAN MEDICAL CENTER'S BOARD OF TRUSTEES ADOPTED THIS IMPLEMENTATION STRATEGY on November 26, 2018 AND IT IS POSTED ON THE BRYAN WEBSITE. THIS IMPLEMENTATION STRATEGY SERVES AS THE FOUNDATION FOR BRYAN'S COMMUNITY HEALTH IMPROVEMENT EFFORTS (SEE BRYAN COMMUNITY HEALTH NEEDS ASSESSMENT) AND IS REVIEWED ANNUALLY. BRYAN HAS ALSO PARTICIPATED OVER THE PAST sevenTEEN YEARS IN COMMUNITY NEEDS ASSESSMENTS IN COOPERATION WITH OTHER HEALTH CARE PROVIDERS AND THE LINCOLN-LANCASTER COUNTY HEALTH DEPARTMENT, AS WELL AS PARTICIPATING IN THE DEVELOPMENT OF HEALTHY PEOPLE 2020 PLAN FOR LINCOLN-LANCASTER COUNTY. IN ADDITION TO PARTICIPATION IN COMMUNITY HEALTH NEEDS ASSESSMENTS, BRYAN CONDUCTS ON-GOING COMMUNITY PERCEPTION SURVEYS. THE SURVEY ASSESSES PERCEPTION OF THE QUALITY AND AVAILABILITY OF HEALTH CARE PROVIDERS IN THE REGION. BRYAN ALSO ASSESSES MARKET SHARE AND UTILIZATION TRENDS AS WELL AS CHANGES IN POPULATION DEMOGRAPHICS. Beyond this, The Center for the Child and the Community convened an Early Childhood Comprehensive Health Working Group comprised of school administrators, community endowment representatives, mental health representatives and health care representatives. This group, sponsored by the Community Health Endowment and led by the Center for the Child and the Community, conducted its own community health assessment specifically on early childhood in Lancaster County using the MAPP process.

THE MEDIAN INCOME IN LANCASTER COUNTY WAS ESTIMATED AT $55,747, AND 14.0% OF THE POPULATION HAD FAMILY INCOMES BELOW THE POVERTY LEVEL. THE PERCENT OF UNINSURED ADULTS AGED 19 TO 64 in Lancaster County HAS BEEN ESTIMATED AT A RATE OF 11.5% IN 2017.

WHILE INDIVIDUAL CHARACTERISTICS SUCH AS AGE, GENDER, RACE, AND ETHNICITY HAVE AN IMPACT ON PEOPLE'S HEALTH, THE DISTRIBUTION OF THESE CHARACTERISTICS ACROSS A COMMUNITY IS ALSO CRITICALLY IMPORTANT AND CAN AFFECT THE NUMBER AND TYPE OF SERVICES AND RESOURCES AVAILABLE. THE GREATER BRIDGEPORT AREA HAS A TOTAL POPULATION OF 330,000. THE TYPICAL BRIDGEPORT RESIDENT IS 34 YEARS OLD, BUT MOST TOWNS IN THE REGION HAVE A MEDIAN AGE THAT IS AT LEAST 10 YEARS HIGHER THAN THAT.

In evaluating the collectability of accounts receivable, the Organization analyzes their pasty history and identifies trends for each of its major payor sources of revenue to estimate the appropriate allowance for doubtful accounts and provision for bad debts. Management regularly reviews data about these major payor sources of revenue in evaluating the sufficiency of the allowance for doubtful accounts. For receivables associated with services provided to patients who have third-party coverage, the Organization analyzes contractually due amounts and provides an allowance for doubtful accounts, if necessary, for receivables associated with self-pay patients (which includes both patients without insurance and patients with deductible and co-payment balances due for which third-party coverage exists for part of the bill). The Organization records a provision for bad debts in the period of service on the basis of its past experience, which indicates that many patients are unable or unwilling to pay the portion of their bill for which they are financially responsible. The difference between the standard rates (or discounted rates, if negotiated) and the amounts actually collected after all reasonable collection efforts have been exhausted is charged off against the allowance for doubtful accounts.

WORK GROUPS WERE CREATED FOR CHRONIC DISEASE, MENTAL HEALTH/SUBSTANCE ABUSE, ACCESS, AND HEALTHY AGING. HEALTHY EATING, PHYSICAL ACTIVITY AND WEIGHT ARE KEY DRIVERS OF HEALTH STATUS AND REMAIN AREAS OF SIGNIFICANT CONCERN. KEY INFORMANT SURVEYS INDICATE DIFFICULTY, PARTICULARLY FOR THE LOWER INCOME GROUPS, ACCESSING HEALTHY FOOD. THIS WAS ATTRIBUTED TO LACK OF TIME DUE TO JOB AND EXTRACURRICULAR ACTIVITIES AND DIFFICULTY FINDING RELIABLE TRANSPORTATION. CHRONIC DISEASES IMPACT LIFE SATISFACTION AND CAUSE SIGNIFICANT ECONOMIC BURDEN IN THE FORM OF OPPORTUNITY COST AND HEALTHCARE EXPENDITURE. PROGRESS FROM THE 2016 COMMUNITY HEALTH IMPROVEMENT PLAN INCLUDES: CHRONIC DISEASE AND OBESITY PREVENTION THE CHRONIC DISEASE SUBCOMMITTEE (CDS) CONSISTING OF REPRESENTATIVES FROM THE REGIONAL YMCA OF WESTERN CONNECTICUT, DANBURY HOSPITAL, VISITING NURSES ASSOCIATION OF BETHEL AND THE HEALTH DISTRICTS OF BETHEL, BROOKFIELD, DANBURY, NEW FAIRFIELD, NEW MILFORD, NEWTOWN AND SOUTHBURY, HAS BEEN MEETING SINCE 2012. PROMINENT AMONG THE INITIATIVES HAVE BEEN PROGRAMS FOR CHILDREN AND YOUTH. THE GO! 5,2,1,0 PROGRAM HAS DEMONSTRATED SUCCESS IN INCREASING ACTIVITY AND HAS BEEN ADOPTED BY LOCAL PEDIATRICIANS, AND NINE PUBLIC SCHOOLS AND 43 SECTOR SITES. PARENTS SURVEYED REPORT MAINTAINING HEALTHY BEHAVIORS AT HOME WITH REDUCTION IN SUGARY BEVERAGES, DECREASED SCREEN TIME AND INCREASE IN CONSUMPTION OF HEALTHY FOOD. THE CDS HAS ACTIVELY SUPPORTED COMMUNITY GARDENING PROGRAMS FOR CHILDREN OF LOW INCOME FAMILIES. THE CDS HAS SUPPORTED THE EXPANSION OF THE CONNECTICUT MULTI-USE TRAIL SYSTEM INCLUDING THE STILL RIVER GREENWAY, THE SECOND MOST USED TRAIL IN THE STATE. A SURVEY OF OVER ONE THOUSAND USERS SHOWS 63% USE THE TRAILS FOR RECREATION, 49% FOR EXERCISE/WEIGHT MANAGEMENT, 45% FOR RELAXATION AND 40% FOR EXERCISE/PREVENTION. MENTAL HEALTH AND SUBSTANCE ABUSE THE MENTAL HEALTH AND SUBSTANCE ABUSE SUBCOMMITTEE (MHSA) IS LED BY THE WESTERN CONNECTICUT COALITION REGIONAL BEHAVIORAL HEALTH ACTION ORGANIZATION REGION 5. REGION 5 CONDUCTED AN ASSESSMENT OF THE BEHAVIORAL HEALTH NEEDS IN 2019. RESULTS OF THE DATA COLLECTION AND FOCUS GROUP, REPORTED IN THE REGIONAL PRIORITY REPORT SHOWS WIDESPREAD CONCERN ABOUT THE PREVALENCE OF MENTAL HEALTH ISSUES. THESE CONCERNS INCLUDE RATES OF ANXIETY AND DEPRESSION IN YOUNG PEOPLE, LACK OF APPROPRIATE SERVICES FOR NONACUTE MENTAL HEALTH AND SUBSTANCE USE DISORDERS AND TREATMENT PROVIDERS REACHING FOR MEDICATIONS BEFORE CONSIDERING ALTERNATIVE THERAPIES. THERE WERE DISCUSSIONS ABOUT THE RISKS OF ADDICTION COMPOUNDING BEHAVIORAL HEALTH PROBLEMS. PRESCRIPTION DRUG MISUSE IS SEEN AS AN ONGOING CHALLENGE. IN REGION 5, RECENT TREATMENT DATA SUPPORTED KEY INFORMANT ASSERTIONS THAT BENZODIAZEPINES AND AMPHETAMINES ARE ACCESSIBLE AND MISUSED BY YOUTH AND ADULTS ALIKE. DURING 2018, 33% OF ALL WESTERN CONNECTICUT OVERDOSE FATALITIES WERE RELATED TO ONE FORM OR ANOTHER OF THESE PRESCRIPTION MEDICATIONS. THE CONSEQUENCES OF ALCOHOL, AND UNDERAGE DRINKING, WERE ALSO RANKED IN THE TOP THREE. THIS IS LIKELY BECAUSE IT REMAINS THE MOST WIDELY USED OF ALL SUBSTANCES. THE MENTAL HEALTH AND SUBSTANCE ABUSE SUBCOMMITTEE OF THE COMMUNITY HEALTH COMMITTEE HAS GUIDED THE DEVELOPMENT OF SEVERAL COMMUNITY HEALTH PROGRAMS. THESE HAVE BEEN EXPANDED AND SCALED SINCE 2016 WITH THE GOALS OF IMPROVING ACCESS TO APPROPRIATE CARE FOR CHILDREN AND ADULTS AND PROVIDING EDUCATION TO INCREASE AWARENESS AND PROMOTE PREVENTION. THE BEHAVIORAL HEALTH INTEGRATION PROGRAM WAS IMPLEMENTED IN 2015 TO IMPROVE ACCESS FOR PATIENTS WITH BEHAVIORAL HEALTH ISSUES. THESE ISSUES MAY RANGE FROM DEPRESSION AND ANXIETY TO SLEEP DISTURBANCE AND GRIEF REACTIONS TO SUBSTANCE MISUSE. THERE IS ALSO THE OPPORTUNITY TO ADDRESS HEALTH BEHAVIORS, SUCH AS SMOKING, LACK OF EXERCISE, OBESITY AND SUBSTANCE USE, WHICH ARE THE MAIN CAUSES OF POOR HEALTH OUTCOMES IN OUR COUNTRY. THIS BEHAVIORAL HEALTH INTEGRATION MODEL INCORPORATES BEHAVIORAL HEALTH CONSULTANTS (BHCS) TO OUR PRIMARY CARE TEAMS. BHCS ARE EXPERIENCED BEHAVIORAL HEALTH SOCIAL WORKERS WHO SERVE AS MEMBERS OF THE CARE TEAM THAT INCLUDES THE PHYSICIAN, NURSE, MEDICAL ASSISTANT, CARE MANAGER AND OFFICE STAFF. USING THIS MODEL, THE PRIMARY CARE TEAM IS BETTER ABLE TO MEET THE MEDICAL AND EMOTIONAL HEALTH NEEDS OF THEIR PATIENTS IN A COORDINATED, PATIENT CENTERED AND CONVENIENT MANNER. FOR THE MORE VULNERABLE RESIDENTS IN OUR COMMUNITY, THE GREATER DANBURY COMMUNITY CARE TEAM (DCCT) WAS STARTED IN 2014. SINCE THEN IT HAS EXPANDED TO INCLUDE MORE THAN 30 ORGANIZATIONS THAT MEET WEEKLY TO ORGANIZE PATIENT-CENTERED OUTREACH AND NAVIGATION FOR VULNERABLE AND HIGH-NEED RESIDENTS OF GREATER DANBURY. THE DCCT HAS SERVED MORE THAN 200 PEOPLE PROVIDING CONNECTION TO NEEDED PRIMARY CARE, MENTAL HEALTH, ADDICTION AND SOCIAL SERVICES. EFFORTS OF THE DCCT HAVE RESULTED IN DECREASED EMERGENCY DEPARTMENT UTILIZATION, INDICATING AN INCREASE IN MEDICAL AND SOCIAL STABILITY FOR THE RESIDENTS SERVED. RECOGNIZING THE UNIQUE NEEDS OF PATIENTS WITH SUBSTANCE USE DISORDERS, DANBURY HOSPITAL ADDED A PEER RECOVERY SPECIALIST TO THE GREATER DANBURY CCT. PEER RECOVERY SPECIALISTS ARE MOTIVATED, ENERGETIC INDIVIDUALS WITH LIVED EXPERIENCE AND SPECIALIZED TRAINING TO BETTER ENGAGE PATIENTS WHO HAVE SUBSTANCE USE DISORDERS. THE PEERS PROVIDE DIRECT OUTREACH AND ASSISTANCE IN CONNECTING PATIENTS TO APPROPRIATE CARE. THE INTERPROFESSIONAL COMMUNITY ACADEMIC NAVIGATION (ICAN) PROGRAM WAS STARTED IN 2016 AS A COLLABORATIVE EFFORT BETWEEN WESTERN CONNECTICUT HEALTH NETWORK AND SACRED HEART UNIVERSITY. THIS PROGRAM EXPANDS THE REACH OF THE CCT WHILE OFFERING AN INNOVATIVE TEACHING OPPORTUNITY FOR UNDERGRADUATE SOCIAL WORK AND GRADUATE LEVEL NURSING STUDENTS. UNDER THE GUIDANCE OF A FACULTY CLINICAL ADVISOR, THE ICAN TEAM PROVIDES DIRECT IN-PERSON AND TELEPHONE OUTREACH SERVICES TO PATIENTS WHO NEED CONNECTION TO MEDICAL, MENTAL HEALTH, SOCIAL OR SUBSTANCE SERVICES. THIS PROGRAM NOT ONLY HAS IMMEDIATE IMPACT ON THE PATIENTS WE SERVE, IT ALSO PROVIDES IMPACTFUL TRAINING FOR FUTURE CAREGIVERS WORKING WITH OUR MOST VULNERABLE COMMUNITY MEMBERS. HEALTHY AGING THE HEALTHY AGING SUBCOMMITTEE WAS CONVENED IN 2016 FOLLOWING THE COMMUNITY HEALTH NEEDS ASSESSMENT OF THAT YEAR. AMONG OTHER PROGRAMS, HEALTHY AGING HAS FOCUSED ON FALL PREVENTION. DANBURY HOSPITAL AND WCHN HAVE EFFECTIVELY ENHANCED COMMUNITY PARTNERSHIPS AND WORKED TO DEVELOP THE INFRASTRUCTURE NEEDED TO IMPROVE COMMUNITY WELLNESS. WHILE SOME INDICATORS HAVE IMPROVED, SUCH AS EMERGENCY DEPARTMENT UTILIZATION, ACCESS TO INTEGRATED CARE, ASTHMA RATES IN ALL COMMUNITIES AND THE RATE OF DIABETES IN DANBURY, MANY MEASURES HAVE CONTINUED TO WORSEN. OBESITY AND HYPERTENSION CONTINUE TO INCREASE AT AN ALARMING RATE AND THE NUMBER OF RESIDENTS WITHOUT A MEDICAL HOME HAS INCREASED. OPIOID OVERDOSE RATES CONTINUE TO CLIMB AND ACCESS TO ADDICTION TREATMENT REMAINS CHALLENGING. MORE ARE STRUGGLING FINANCIALLY AND INCREASED NUMBERS ARE POSTPONING HEALTHCARE DUE TO COST. RELATED TO LINE #2, ECONOMIC DEVELOPMENT, AND LINE #7, COMMUNITY HEALTH IMPROVEMENT ADVOCACY TOTALING $60,041 VARIOUS WCHN OFFICIALS PARTICIPATED IN CHAMBER OF COMMERCE MEETINGS AND EVENTS, WORKING TO PROMOTE ECONOMIC DEVELOPMENT IN THE DANBURY HOSPITAL AREA. STATE AND LOCAL ELECTED OFFICIALS AND AGENCY HEADS WERE LOBBIED IN SUPPORT OF MAINTAINING PATIENT ACCESS TO ESSENTIAL SERVICES FOR THE UNINSURED AND UNDER INSURED.

201913199349306311,440545297,"Schedule H, Part III, Line 4 Bad debt expense - financial statement footnote","FINANCIAL STATEMENT FOOTNOTE REGARDING BAD DEBT EXPENSE: Performance obligations are identified based on the nature of the services provided. Revenue associated with performance obligations satisfied over time is recognized based on actual charges incurred in relation to total expected (or actual) charges. Performance obligations satisfied over time relate to patients receiving inpatient acute care services. The System measures the performance obligation from admission into the hospital to the point when there are no further services required for the patient, which is generally the time of discharge. For outpatient services, the performance obligation is satisfied as the patient simultaneously receives and consumes the benefits provided as the services are performed. In the case of these outpatient services, recognition of the obligation over time yields the same result as recognizing the obligation at a point in time. Management believes this method provides a faithful depiction of the transfer of services over the term of performance obligations based on the inputs needed to satisfy the obligations. As the System's performance obligations relate to contracts with a duration of less than one year, the System has applied the optional exemption provided in the guidance and, therefore, is not required to disclose the aggregate amount of the transaction price allocated to performance obligations that are unsatisfied or partially unsatisfied at the end of the reporting period. The unsatisfied or partially unsatisfied performance obligations referred to above are primarily related to inpatient acute care services at the end of the reporting period. The performance obligations for these contracts are generally completed when the patients are discharged, which generally occurs within days or weeks of the end of the reporting period. The System uses a portfolio approach to account for categories of patient contracts as a collective group rather than recognizing revenue on an individual contract basis. The portfolios consist of major payor classes for inpatient revenue and major payor classes and types of services provided for outpatient revenue. Based on the historical collection trends and other analyzes, the System believes that revenue recognized by utilizing the portfolio approach approximates the revenue that would have been recognized if an individual contract approach were used. The System determines the transaction price, which involves significant estimates and judgment, based on standard charges for goods and services provided, reduced by explicit and implicit price concessions, including contractual adjustments provided to third-party payors, discounts provided to uninsured and underinsured patients in accordance with policy and/or implicit price concessions based on the historical collection experience of patient accounts. The System determines the transaction price associated with services provided to patients who have third-party payor coverage based on reimbursement terms per contractual agreements, discount policies and historical experience. For uninsured patients who do not qualify for charity care, the System determines the transaction price associated with services on the basis of charges, reduced by implicit price concessions. Implicit price concessions included in the estimate of the transaction price are based on historical collection experience for applicable patient portfolios. Patients who meet the System's criteria for charity care are provided care without charge; such amounts are not reported as revenue. Subsequent changes to the estimate of the transaction price are generally recorded as adjustments to patient service revenue in the period of the change."

If a patient does not qualify for either partial or full assistance, then a monthly payment plan is offered to the patient for any remaining balances due.

In the quantitative analysis, multiple sources provided the reportable statistics including the New York State Community Health Indicators, the County Health Rankings Report, as well as internal data from Cayuga Medical Center. The data collected for the quantitative assessment was then sorted into the following health categories: Demographics and socioeconomic status, Access to healthcare, Health status of overall population and priority populations, Risk factor behaviors and conditions related to top 5 causes of death, child health, Infectious diseases, Natural environment, Social and mental health environment, and Resources/Assets. For every indicator, comparisons were made utilizing the mean value for each individual county, the aggregate value for the total community, the New York State without New York City state value and the U.S. value where applicable to generate context for interpretation. Information for this assessment was collected in a different manner this year, as the CHNA and Community Health Improvement Plan (CHIP) was a combined effort with the Local Health Department of Tompkins County. The CHNA/CHIP team was comprised of representatives from Tompkins County, Cayuga Medical Center, and several community-based non-profit organizations. Much of the information driving the selection/confirmation of our priorities was gathered through conversations with service providers and through panels and presentation by peers and providers. Key data indicators were reviewed to guide selection decisions for our priority focus areas. For example, data on hospitalizations related to mental health and substance abuse showed steep increases over the last 2-10 years, indicating that mental health and substance abuse continues to be a priority for Tompkins County. Finally, review of chronic disease indicators revealed that Tompkins County is in the second quartile statewide, indicating the need to continue our efforts to focus on underserved populations, particularly in the rural parts of the county."

Many of these areas are designated rural counties and Tompkins County is New York State's smallest Metropolitan Statistical Area. The total service area spans approximately 1,000 square miles in the middle of the state with an average population density of fewer than 125 persons per square mile. There are several distinct health and health-related factors affecting residents of this area: A) The region is home to an older community. According to the Healthcare Association of NY State (HANYS), 11.3% of adults are 55-64 years of age. Since the 2000 Census, growth in the 65+ age cohort has ranged from 15% to 32% across the region and is projected to increase by 18% between 2016 and 2021. Issues with chronic disease and psychological distress are well documented for this demographic. Overall, 22.9% of adults aged 55 and over are likely to be in fair or poor health, ranging from 19.6% of those aged 55-64 to 32.1% or those aged 85 and over (National Health Statistics Reports, Health Characteristics of Adults Aged 55 Years and Over: United States, 2004-2007, CDC, 2009). B) Access to health care professionals within the region is problematic. Many of the counties have zip codes within that county with Health Professional Shortage Areas (HPSA's) designations for physician, dental, and mental health care for Medicaid beneficiaries. Even when a provider is available, the rural environment, defined by hilly terrains and lakes as geographic barriers, creates transportation challenges that can limit access. C) In aggregate, residents of the services are fiscally challenged. The median salary within the region is $52,624, which is $6,645 below the state average (ACS 5-Year Estimate, Census Bureau)."

As a 501(c)(3) organization, CMC reinvests any surplus in annual operating margin to improve the medical care for the community, including patient-side and technology improvements, facility structure and infrastructure, and improvements in care delivery, As an example, CMC is investing in a $6.9 million facilities project to renovate and expand its inpatient Behavioral Services Unit staring in 2017. Part of this project will be funded through a NYS grant ($2.47 million), however the majority of the project will be funded through CMC's own reserves. Despite the fact that this crucial community resource does not generate surplus revenue, CMC believes it is a vital service for the community, and as such, continues to invest its limited resources to ensure the community's needs are met."

Founded by the Sisters of Mercy in 1893, Mercy is Des Moines' longest continually operating hospital and one of the largest employers in the state, with more than 6,600 employees and a medical staff of more than 950 physicians and allied health professionals. As the first Catholic hospital to serve the community, Mercy embraced the mission of the founding religious congregation, which has since joined with other religious congregations to form Catholic Health Initiatives. CHI serves as the parent corporation of its MBOs which are comprised of 101 hospitals, including four academic medical centers, and 30 critical access facilities; community health service organizations; accredited nursing colleges; home health agencies; and other facilities that span the inpatient and outpatient continuum of care. Together, these facilities provided $1.14 billion in charity care and community benefit in the 2018 fiscal year, including services for the poor, free clinics, education and research. Financial assistance and community benefit totaled approximately $2.1 billion with the inclusion of the unpaid costs of Medicare. Mercy is one of the Midwest's largest referral centers, offering a variety of specialty services that are unique to Iowa and the region. In addition, a 24-hour emergency room is open to all individuals regardless of ability to pay. While a participant in Medicare and Medicaid, Mercy also deploys a robust financial assistance program for the uninsured and underserved, meeting the needs of all seeking care. Dedicated to serving our entire community, Mercy is enriched by a board of directors comprised of civic-minded leaders. Working in conjunction with this esteemed team, Mercy's leadership evaluates and dedicates resources to the promotion of a healthy community and an improvement in the lives of those we serve. One example of Mercy's commitment to unmet needs exists in the House of Mercy. Initially developed to provide safe and supportive housing for vulnerable women and their children, the House of Mercy is now one of Iowa's largest providers of transitional housing and clinical services for parenting women with addiction. The House of Mercy is dedicated to assisting pregnant, parenting/non-parenting, and adolescent/adult women in developing personal responsibility and independence through counseling, education, and medical care in collaboration with other caring individuals. It is home to 11 vital human service and health care related programs and, on average, houses nearly 170 women and children in the residential treatment program. During their stay, women gain the skills they need to live independently, deal with addiction, overcome the effects of trauma and effectively parent their children. Mercy Medical Center - Des Moines is included in the Official Catholic Directory as a tax-exempt hospital."

Updates to the hindsight analysis is performed at least quarterly using primarily a rolling eighteen-month collection history and write-off data. Subsequent changes to estimates of the transaction price are generally recorded as adjustments to net patient revenue in the period of change. Subsequent changes that are determined to be the result of an adverse change in a third-party payor's ability to pay are recorded as bad debt expense in purchased services and other in the accompanying consolidated statements of operations and change in net assets. Bad debt expense for 2019 was not significant."
202011959349301851,420680448,"Schedule H, Part III, Line 8 Community benefit & methodology for determining medicare costs","Using essentially the same Medicare cost report principles as to the allocation of general services costs and ""apportionment"" methods, the ""CHI Workbook"" calculates a payers' gross allowable costs by service (so as to facilitate a corresponding comparison between gross allowable costs and ultimate payments received). The term ""gross allowable costs"" means costs before any deductibles or co-insurance are subtracted. CHI Iowa Corp 's ultimate reimbursement will be reduced by any applicable copayment/ deductible. Where Medicare is the secondary insurer, amounts due from the insured's primary payer were not subtracted from Medicare allowable costs because the amounts are typically immaterial. Although not presented on the Medicare cost report, in order to facilitate a more accurate understanding of the ""true"" cost of services (for ""shortfall"" purposes) the CHI Workbook allows a health care facility not to offset costs that Medicare considers to be non-allowable, but for which the facility can legitimately argue are related to the care of the facility's patients. In addition, although not reportable on the Medicare cost report, the CHI workbook includes the cost of services that are paid via a set fee-schedule rather than being reimbursed based on costs (e.g. outpatient clinical laboratory). Finally, the CHI Workbook allows a facility to include other health care services performed by a separate facility (such as a physician practice) that are maintained on separate books and records (as opposed to the main facility's books and records which has its costs of service included within a cost report). True costs of Medicare computed using this methodology: Total Medicare Revenue: $175,159,049 Total Medicare costs: $182,860,456 Surplus or Shortfall ($7,701,407) CHI Iowa Corp believes that excluding Medicare losses from community benefit makes the overall community benefit report more credible for these reasons: Unlike subsidized areas such as burn units or behavioral-health services, Medicare is not a differentiating feature of tax-exempt health care organizations. In fact, for-profit hospitals focus on attracting patients with Medicare coverage, especially in the case of well-paid services that include cardiac and orthopedics. Significant effort and resources are devoted to ensuring that hospitals are reimbursed appropriately by the Medicare program. The Medicare Payment Advisory Commission (MedPAC), an independent Congressional agency, carefully studies Medicare payment and the access to care that Medicare beneficiaries receive. The commission recommends payment adjustments to Congress accordingly. Though Medicare losses are not included by Catholic hospitals as community benefit, the Catholic Health Association guidelines allow hospitals to count as community benefit some programs that specifically serve the Medicare population. For instance, if hospitals operate programs for patients with Medicare benefits that respond to identified community needs, generate losses for the hospital, and meet other criteria, these programs can be included in the CHA framework in Category C as ""subsidized health services."" Medicare losses are different from Medicaid losses, which are counted in the CHA community benefit framework, because Medicaid reimbursements generally do not receive the level of attention paid to Medicare reimbursement. Medicaid payment is largely driven by what states can afford to pay, and is typically substantially less than what Medicare pays."
202011959349301851,420680448,"Schedule H, Part III, Line 9b Collection practices for patients eligible for financial assistance","The organization's billing and collections policy applies to all individuals presenting for emergency or other medically necessary care. The policy contains provisions for collecting amounts due from those patients who the organization knows to qualify for financial assistance either through the traditional financial assistance application process or through presumptive eligibility processes. Before engaging in extraordinary collection actions (ECAs) to obtain payment for EMCare, Hospital Facilities must make reasonable efforts through its billing and collections processes, pursuant to Treas. Reg. 1.501(r)-6(c), to determine whether an individual is eligible for Financial Assistance. In no event will an ECA be initiated prior to 120 days from the date the Facility provides the first post-discharge billing statement (i.e., during the Notification Period) unless all reasonable efforts have been made. Hospital Facilities will not refer accounts for collection where the patient has initially applied for Financial Assistance, and the Hospital Facility has not yet made reasonable efforts with respect to the account. For patients and Guarantors who are unable to provide required documentation, a Hospital Facility may grant Presumptive Financial Assistance based on information obtained from other resources. Patients who qualify for Medicaid are presumed to qualify for full charity write off. Any charges for days or services written off (excluding Medicaid denials related to timeliness of billing, insufficient medical record documentation, missing invoices, authorization, or eligibility issues) as a result of a Medicaid are booked as charity. Some Medicaid plans offer coverage for a limited or restricted list of services. If a patient is eligible for Medicaid, any charges for days or services not covered by the patient's coverage may be written off to charity without a completed application. This does not include any Share of Cost (SOC) or other patient cost-sharing amounts such as deductibles or copayments, as such costs are determined by the state to be an amount that the patient must pay before the patient is eligible for Medicaid. Health and Human Services (HSS) uses the term ""Spend Down"" instead of Share of Cost. All collection activities conducted by the Facility, a Designated Supplier, or its third-party collection agents will be in conformance with all federal and state laws governing debt collection practices. All third-party agreements governing collection and recovery activities must include a provision requiring compliance with the hospital facilities' financial assistance and billing and collections policy and indemnification for failures as a result of its noncompliance. This includes, but is not limited to, agreements between third parties who subsequently sell or refer debt of the Hospital Facility."

Such notices and summary information shall include a contact number and shall be provided in English, Spanish, and other primary languages spoken by the population served by an individual Hospital Facility, as applicable. Referral of patients for Financial Assistance may be made by any member of the CHI Hospital Organization non-medical or medical staff, including physicians, nurses, financial counselors, social workers, case managers, chaplains, and religious sponsors. A request for assistance may be made by the patient or a family member, close friend, or associate of the patient, subject to applicable privacy laws. In addition, Hospital registration clerks are trained to provide consultation to those who have no insurance or potentially inadequate insurance concerning their financial options including application for Medicaid and for assistance under the Financial Assistance Policy. Counselors assist Medicare eligible patients in enrollment by providing referrals to the appropriate government agencies. Once it is determined that the patient does not qualify for any third party funding, the patient is verbally notified about the existence of Financial Assistance Application and additional screening takes place by a Hospital employee to determine if the patient is eligible for charity service prior to discharge. Upon registration (and once all EMTALA requirements are met), patients who are identified as uninsured (and not covered by Medicare or Medicaid) are provided with a packet of information that addresses the Financial Assistance Policy, the plain language summary of that policy, and an application for assistance. Hospital registration clerks read the organization's medical assistance policy to those who appear to be incapable of reading, and provide translators for non-English-speaking individuals. Patients that have been discharged prior to charity screening, such as emergency room patients, receive a written notification of possible eligibility for services. If the patient is determined not to be eligible for government assistance, he/she may notify the hospital that they seek charity assistance. The appropriate charity form is sent to the patient/guarantor for completion and then returned to the hospital for evaluation and qualification. Once determination of eligibility is made, the patient is sent a notice informing him/her if they qualify for full, partial, or no charity care services. Hospital Facilities must make reasonable efforts through its billing and collections processes, pursuant to Treas. Reg. 1.501(r)-6(c), to determine whether any individual is eligible for Financial Assistance."
