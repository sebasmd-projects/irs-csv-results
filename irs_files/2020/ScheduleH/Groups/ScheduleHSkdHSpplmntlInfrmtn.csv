THE MONROE COUNTY CHNA IS CONDUCTED IN COLLABORATION WITH OTHER HOSPITALS, THE LOCAL PUBLIC HEALTH DEPARTMENT AND OTHER AGENCIES IN MONROE COUNTY. A GROUP OF REPRESENTATIVES FROM EACH OF THESE ENTITIES MEETS MONTHLY AND IS CALLED THE COMMUNITY HEALTH IMPROVEMENT WORKGROUP (CHIW). THE CHIW MEETS TO CONDUCT THE CHNA WHEN INDICATED AND TO IMPLEMENT THE COMMUNITY-WIDE IMPROVEMENT STRATEGY. THERESA GREEN, DIRECTOR OF COMMUNITY HEALTH POLICY FROM THE URMC CENTER FOR COMMUNITY HEALTH AND PREVENTION, LED THE CHIW AND PROVIDED EXPERT ADVICE ON COMMUNITY ENGAGEMENT AND EVIDENCE BASED INTERVENTIONS. COMMUNITY INPUT IS CRITICAL THROUGHOUT THE CHNA PROCESS, THE IMPROVEMENT PLANNING PROCESS, AND THE IMPLEMENTATION PROCESS. ONGOING COMMUNITY ENGAGEMENT IS VITAL TO INFORM THE AGENDA. THE CHIW USED SEVERAL STRATEGIES TO ASSURE COMMUNITY INPUT WHEN DEVELOPING THE CHNA. FIRST, EACH OF THE COUNTYS HOSPITAL SYSTEMS REPRESENTATIVES TO THE CHIW TOOK INTO ACCOUNT INPUT FROM PERSONS WHO REPRESENT THE COMMUNITY. EACH OF THE HOSPITAL SYSTEMS INCLUDED IN THE CHNA: UNIVERSITY OF ROCHESTER STRONG MEMORIAL HOSPITAL, HIGHLAND HOSPITAL, ROCHESTER REGIONAL HEALTH, AND UNITY HOSPITAL, SEND A REPRESENTATIVE TO THE CHIW.

CARELOCK, AND DR. GREEN. ASIDE FOR INFRASTRUCTURE DESIGNED FOR COMMUNITY REPRSENTATION, THE CHIW RELIED HEAVILY ON A COMMUNITY SURVEY CONDUCTED BY COMMON GROUND HEALTH FOR COMMUNITY INPUT. IN 2018, COMMON GROUND HEALTH CONDUCTED A REGIONAL SURVEY OF COMMUNITY MEMBERS TO LEARN MORE ABOUT HEALTH BEHAVIORS AND BARRIERS TO HEALTHY LIVES. WITH PARTICULAR ATTENTION TO GATHERING INPUT FROM A DIVERSE GROUP OF PARTICIPANTS, OVER 4,000 PEOPLE WERE SURVEYED. THE SURVEY ASKED ABOUT A WIDE RANGE OF TOPICS FROM ACCESS TO MEDICAL AND DENTAL CARE TO PERCEPTIONS OF PERSONAL SAFETY AND SATISFACTION WITH WORK. TO CAPTURE EACH INDIVIDUALS UNIQUE STORY, SEVERAL QUESTIONS ARE OPEN-ENDED WITH AN OPPORTUNITY FOR UNSTRUCTURED FEEDBACK. THE RESULTS OF THE SURVEY INDICATED THAT THE TOP CONCERN FOR ADULTS IN MONROE COUNTY ACROSS ALL RACES, GEOGRAPHIES, AND SOCIOECONOMIC STATUS LEVELS WAS MENTAL HEALTH. AFTER REVIEWING THE DATA AND PRIORITIZING THE GENERAL DIRECTION FOR THE CHNA/CHIP, SEVERAL MEETINGS WERE PLANNED WITH SIGNIFICANT COMMUNITY GROUPS TO GATHER INPUT. MEMBERS FROM THE CHIW MET FIRST WITH THE AFRICAN AMERICAN HEALTH COALITION AT COMMON GROUND HEALTH ON MARCH 14TH, 2019. THEIR FEEDBACK INCLUDED SPECIFIC AREAS OF MENTAL HEALTH CONCERNS, THE NEED TO REDUCE THE STIGMA OF MENTAL HEALTH DIAGNOSES, AND INVOLVEMENT WITH THE CHURCH COMMUNITY.

202021969349305657,160743209,"PART V, SECTION B, LINE 11 - ADDRESSING THE NEEDS IDENTIFIED IN THE CHNA","THE 2019 COMMUNITY HEALTH NEEDS ASSESSMENT IDENTIFIED TWO PRIMARY FOCUS AREAS BASED ON VARIOUS SOURCES OF DATA AND SEVERAL OPPORTUNITIES FOR COMMUNITY INPUT. THE IDENTIFIED PRIORITY AREAS ARE MENTAL HEALTH/WELL-BEING AND MATERNAL CHILD HEALTH DISPARITIES. THE OBJECTIVES AND INTERVENTIONS FOR EACH AREA OF NEED WERE SELECTED FROM THE NEW YORK STATE PREVENTION AGENDAS LIST OF RECOMMENDED, EVIDENCE-BASED INTERVENTIONS AND PROGRAMS. THE FOLLOWING WORK PLAN WILL BE IMPLEMENTED IN MONROE COUNTY TO PROGRESS TOWARDS THE GOALS OF THE 2019-2021 COMMUNITY HEALTH IMPROVEMENT PLAN, USING THE RESOURCES OF THE CHIW. ALL FOUR HOSPITALS AND THE HEALTH DEPARTMENT AS WELL AS COMMUNITY PARTNERS WILL WORK COLLABORATIVELY ON THE SAME WORK PLAN TOWARDS THE SAME GOALS. THE INTERVENTIONS WILL BE IMPLEMENTED IN A COLLABORATIVE MANNER, AND THE HOSPITALS WILL DELEGATE RESOURCES INCLUDING REPRESENTATIVES, MEETING SPACES, CONTENT EXPERTS AND ORGANIZATIONAL CONNECTIONS. OUR COMMUNITY PARTNERS ARE INVOLVED IN THE PLANNING AND IMPLEMENTATION OF ALL INTERVENTION STRATEGIES, FROM THEIR SELECTION TO THEIR COMPLETION. MATERNAL CHILD HEALTH IS AN AREA OF CONCERN FOR MONROE COUNTY, AND THE CURRENT DISPARITIES ARE UNACCEPTABLE. THE GOAL FOR MATERNAL CHILD HEALTH IN THE 2019-2021 CHIP IS: REDUCE RACIAL, ETHNIC, ECONOMIC AND GEOGRAPHIC DISPARITIES IN MATERNAL AND CHILD HEALTH OUTCOMES AND PROMOTE HEALTH EQUITY FOR MATERNAL AND CHILD POPULATIONS. THE GOAL WILL BE ATTAINED THROUGH SEVERAL INTERVENTIONS INCLUDING: 1. PARTNER WITH HEALTHY BABY NETWORK AND OTHER MEMBERS OF THE MATERNAL CHILD HEALTH ADVISORY GROUP TO CONDUCT COMMUNITY INPUT SESSIONS TO IDENTIFY THE DRIVERS AND SOLUTIONS TO DISPARITIES. BY DECEMBER OF 2020, COMPLETE A COMPREHENSIVE SUMMARY OF BARRIERS TO HEALTHY OUTCOMES AMONG WOMEN OF REPRODUCTIVE AGE, PRIMARILY PEOPLE OF COLOR, PEOPLE WITH LOW SES, AND PEOPLE WHO LIVE IN THE CITY OF ROCHESTER. 2. CONVENE A MATERNAL CHILD HEALTH ADVISORY GROUP TO DISCUSS INTERVENTIONS AND PLAN IMPLEMENTATION TO ADDRESS BARRIERS IDENTIFIED BY THE COMMUNITY. BY DECEMBER OF 2021, IMPLEMENT AT LEAST 3 SYSTEMS CHANGES THAT WILL ADDRESS SOCIAL BARRIERS AND IMPROVE DISPARITIES IN MATERNAL CHILD HEALTH OUTCOMES. AND 3. HOST A SYNERGY MEETING ON LOCAL MATERNAL AND CHILD HEALTH DISPARITIES ANNUALLY PRESENTING RESULTS OF FOCUS GROUPS AND MCH ADVISORY GROUP WORK. BY DECEMBER OF 2021, HOST TWO WELL ATTENDED SYNERGY MEETINGS FOCUSING ON MCH DISPARITIES AND PROGRESS OF THE ADVISORY GROUP. PROMOTING MENTAL HEALTH AND WELL-BEING IS A PRIORITY AREA OF PARTICULAR IMPORTANCE TO OUR COMMUNITY MEMBERS. INTERVENTIONS FOCUS ON THE UPSTREAM APPROACH OF ADDRESSING SOCIAL DETERMINANTS OF HEALTH INCLUDING POVERTY AND EMPLOYMENT IN ORDER TO IMPACT THE LONG TERM HEALTH OF THE COMMUNITY AND ADDRESS DISPARITIES IN WEALTH. THERE ARE TWO GOALS IN THIS AREA. ONE IS TO STRENGTHEN OPPORTUNITIES TO BUILD WELL-BEING AND RESILIENCE ACROSS THE LIFESPAN. THIS GOAL WILL BE ATTAINED THROUGH SEVERAL INTERVENTIONS INCLUDING: 1. EXPLORE OPPORTUNITIES TO USE THE POWER OF ANCHOR INSTITUTIONS SUCH AS HOSPITALS TO REVITALIZE NEIGHBORHOODS, SUPPORTING DEMOCRATICALLY OPERATED WORKER COOPERATIVES, REEMPLOYMENT, AND SUPPORTED EMPLOYMENT. BY DECEMBER OF 2021, COMPLETE A COMPREHENSIVE SUMMARY OF INTERVENTIONS THAT ANCHOR INSTITUTIONS HAVE SUCCESSFULLY IMPLEMENTED TO IMPROVE COMMUNITY WEALTH AND PRESENT AT LEAST ONE RECOMMENDED OPTION TO EACH OF THE HOSPITALS IN THE COMMUNITY HEALTH IMPROVEMENT WORKGROUP. THE SECOND GOAL FOR THIS AREA IS TO FACILITATE SUPPORTIVE ENVIRONMENTS THAT PROMOTE RESPECT AND DIGNITY FOR PEOPLE OF ALL AGES. INTERVENTIONS IN THIS AREA INCLUDE: 1. BY DECEMBER 2021, HOST AT LEAST 4 MENTAL HEALTH FIRST AID SESSIONS TO INCREASE MENTAL HEALTH LITERACY, AWARENESS, AND EDUCATION ABOUT MENTAL HEALTH AND AVAILABLE SERVICES IN MONROE COUNTY. 2. BY DECEMBER 2021, REVIEW AT LEAST 3 TYPES OF DOCUMENTS INTERNAL TO THE HOSPITAL SYSTEMS, AND SEEK HELP FROM LANGUAGE EXPERTS TO CHANGE AND ADAPT LANGUAGE THAT IS NOT ENHANCING STIGMA AND IS DESIGNED TO BE MORE INCLUSIVE. IF RELEVANT, MAKE THESE LANGUAGE CHANGES TO DEFAULT LANGUAGE THAT IS USED IN THE EMR. IN ADDITION TO THE TWO IDENTIFIED FOCUS AREAS OUTLINED ABOVE, THERE ARE SEVERAL AREAS THAT WERE OF NOTED CONCERN TO THE CHIW. THESE SECONDARY AREAS SHOW UNACCEPTABLE OUTCOMES IN ONE OR MORE MEASURABLE INDICATOR HOWEVER LIMITED RESOURCES DO NOT ALLOW FOR DEDICATED ATTENTION AND INTERVENTION TO ADDRESS THEM. THE CHIW HAS AGREED TO FOLLOW AND SUPPORT THESE AREAS IN THE CHIP 2019-2021, WHILE DEDICATING PRIMARY ATTENTION TO THE TWO FOCUS AREAS OF MENTAL HEALTH, AND MATERNAL CHILD HEALTH INEQUITIES. THE FIVE AREAS THE CHIW WILL FOLLOW ARE: 1. SMOKING CESSATION INCREASING SMOKING CESSATION WAS A FOCUS AREA FOR THE MONROE COUNTY COMMUNITY HEALTH IMPROVEMENT PLAN (2016-2018). THROUGH A CHANGE IN THE ELECTRONIC MEDICAL RECORDS PROCESS OF ALL FOUR HOSPITALS IN THE CHIW COLLABORATIVE, THE REFERRALS TO THE NYS QUIT LINE INCREASED 100 FOLD. ELECTRONIC REFERRALS TO THE NYS QUITLINE ARE AVAILABLE THROUGH BOTH MAJOR HEALTH SYSTEMS AND SEVERAL INDEPENDENT CLINICS AND FQHCS THROUGHOUT THE REGION. IN ADDITION, THE LOCAL MILLION HEARTS GROUP CONTINUES TO ORGANIZE AND HOST TOBACCO FREE COLLEGE CAMPUS CONFERENCES AND SUPPORT T-21 LEGISLATIVE INITIATIVES. THE TOBACCO FREE COLLEGE CAMPUS CONFERENCES WAS ORGANIZED BY THE MILLION HEARTS COLLABORATIVE, INCLUDING MEMBERS FROM THE ROCHESTER CHAMBER OF COMMERCE, AND LIDESTRI FOODS INC. AND INCLUDES SUPPORT AND REPRESENTATION FROM LOCAL COLLEGES INCLUDING ROCHESTER INSTITUTE OF TECHNOLOGY, UNIVERSITY OF ROCHESTER, ST. JOHN FISHER, MONROE COMMUNITY COLLEGE, AND NAZARETH COLLEGE. THIS GROUP MEETS TO DISCUSS PROGRESS, CAMPUS POLICIES, AND SETBACKS IN DEVELOPING AND MAINTAINING SMOKE-, TOBACCO-, AND VAPE-FREE LOCAL COLLEGE CAMPUSES. 2. FOOD INSECURITY WORK ON FOOD INSECURITY WAS BEGUN WITH THE CHIP 2016-2018. LOCAL SYSTEMS INTEGRATION PROJECTS ARE UNDERWAY, AND BOTH ROCHESTER REGIONAL HEALTH AND UNIVERSITY OF ROCHESTER MEDICAL CENTER ARE INVOLVED IN THESE PROJECTS, BOTH AS POTENTIAL PILOT LOCATIONS, AND ADVISORY GROUPS. AS THE COMMUNITY HEALTH IMPROVEMENT PLAN FOR 2019-2021 WILL BE ADDRESSING COMMUNITY WELL-BEING, AND SOCIAL DETERMINANT IMPACT ON MATERNAL-CHILD HEALTH, THESE FOCUS AREAS ARE RELATED TO AND INSEPARABLE FROM FOOD INSECURITY AND RESOURCE PROVISION. THE CHIW WILL CONTINUE TO SUPPORT PEDIATRIC DEPARTMENTS AS THEY SCREEN FOR SOCIAL DETERMINANTS INCLUDING FOOD SECURITY, AND WORK WITH LOCAL ORGANIZATIONS SUCH AS FOODLINK AND 2-1-1 TO BUILD COLLABORATIONS WITH THE HEALTH SYSTEMS. 3. OPIOID CRISIS THE OPIOID CRISIS HAS BEEN IMPACTING MONROE COUNTY SINCE THE EARLY 2010S. IN 2016, THE PUBLIC HEALTH GOAL WAS TO DECREASE OVERDOSE AND DEATH BY OVERDOSE RATES TO BELOW THE 2015 LEVEL. UNFORTUNATELY, WITH THE SPREAD OF THE OPIOID CRISIS AND THE INTRODUCTION OF FENTANYL TO THE STREET MARKETPLACE, OPIOID OVERDOSES AND DEATHS HAVE NOT DECREASED TO THIS SET GOAL, AND THEY HAVE INCREASED IN THE PAST 3 YEARS. THERE ARE MANY GROUPS WITHIN AND OUTSIDE OF THE HEALTH SYSTEMS WORKING TO ADDRESS THIS CRISIS. INCREASING THE HIRING OF TOXICOLOGISTS IN THE OFFICE OF THE MEDICAL EXAMINER, TRAINING MORE LOCAL PROVIDERS WITH BUPRENORPHINE WAIVERS AND TRAINING IN MEDICATION-ASSISTED TREATMENT (MAT), THE CONTINUATION AND EXPANSION OF LOCAL HEROIN AND OPIOID TASK FORCES INCLUDING LAW ENFORCEMENT, COUNTY OFFICIALS, TREATMENT CENTERS, AND MEDICAL PROFESSIONALS. THE HEALTH SYSTEMS ARE CONTINUING WORK IN THE SPACE OF SUBSTANCE USE DISORDER PREVENTION, IDENTIFICATION, AND TREATMENT WITH COMMUNITY AND GOVERNMENT PARTNERS. NALOXONE: THERE IS A NYS POLICY NALOXONE CO-PAYMENT ASSISTANCE PROGRAM (N-CAP) THAT PROVIDES A STANDING PRESCRIPTION AND COPAY COVERAGE AVAILABLE AT PHARMACIES WITHOUT AN OPEN PRESCRIPTION. RAISING AWARENESS ABOUT THE AVAILABILITY AND PROPER USE OF NALOXONE WILL CONTINUE IN MONROE COUNTY. TRAININGS ON HOW TO ADMINISTER NALOXONE IN THE CASE OF AN OPIOID OVERDOSE ARE PROVIDED BY MANY COMMUNITY GROUPS AND HEALTHCARE PROVIDERS INCLUDING BUT NOT LIMITED TO MONROE COUNTY DEPARTMENT OF PUBLIC HEALTH, ROCHESTER GENERAL HOSPITAL, URMC, OAK ORCHARD HEALTH, AND TRILLIUM HEALTH. THESE TRAININGS ARE FREQUENT, OFTEN OPEN TO THE PUBLIC, AND ADVERTISED ONLINE BY EACH GROUP. 4. SEXUALLY TRANSMITTED INFECTION (STI) RATES MONROE COUNTY DEPARTMENT OF PUBLIC HEALTH RUNS THE STD AND HIV CONTROL PROGRAM, INCLUDING MEDICAL INTERVENTIONS, SCREENINGS, PREVENTION, EDUCATION, AND PROVIDER TRAINING. THE MATERNAL CHILD HEALTH ADVISORY GROUP INCLUDES MANY GROUPS THAT WORK IN PRENATAL CARE, REPRODUCTIVE EDUCATION, AND STI EDUCATION. CONTINUATION OF SUPPORT AND FUNDING TO THE LOCAL PROVIDERS OF SEX AND REPRODUCTIVE EDUCATION TO BOTH CHILDREN AND ADULTS IN MONROE COUNTY WILL BE NECESSARY TO REDUCE THE RATE OF STIS IN THE REGION. 5.

THE CHNA REPORT IDENTIFIED THE FOLLOWING SEVEN NEEDS AS PRIORITIES FOR IU HEALTH ARNETT: - Access to Health Care Services - Drug and Substance Abuse - Health Care and Social Services for Seniors - Mental Health - Obesity and Diabetes - Smoking - Social Determinants of Health
201923189349314362,263162145,"Schedule H, Part V, Section B, Line 5 Input from Community","In conducting its most recent Community Health Needs Assessment (""CHNA"") IU Health Arnett Hospital took into account input from persons who represent the broad interests of the communities it serves. Primary data were gathered in three ways: Community Meetings, Key Stakeholder Interviews, and a Community Survey. For purposes of this CHNA, IU Health Arnett Hospitals community is defined as Benton, Carroll, and Tippecanoe counties, Indiana. These three counties accounted for over 67 percent of the hospitals inpatient cases in 2016. Community Meetings Tippecanoe County On May 8, 2018, a meeting of community representatives was held at IU Health Arnett Hospital in Lafayette, the county seat of Tippecanoe County. The meeting was attended by 22 community members invited by IU Health because they represent important community organizations and sectors such as: local health departments, non-profit organizations, local businesses, health care providers, local policymakers, parks and recreation departments, and schools. Through this meeting, IU Health sought a breadth of perspectives on the communitys health needs. The specific organizations represented at the meeting are listed below. - City of Lafayette - Food Finders Food Bank - Hanna Community Center - Heartford House Child Advocacy Center - Henriott Group, Inc. - IU Health - IU Health Arnett Hospital - IU Health West Central Region - LTHC Homeless Services - Lafayette Family YMCA - North Central Health Services - Purdue Extension - Riggs Community Health Center - Sycamore Springs - Tippecanoe Arts Federation - Tippecanoe County CASA - Tippecanoe County - Tippecanoe Health Department - United Way of Greater Lafayette - YWCA Greater Lafayette - YWCA Foundation The meeting began with a presentation that discussed the goals and status of the CHNA process and the purpose of the community meeting. Then, secondary data were presented, along with a summary of the most unfavorable community health indicators. For Tippecanoe County, those indicators were (in alphabetical order): - Cancer incidence and mortality - Diabetes - Physical inactivity and access to exercise opportunities - Physically and mentally unhealthy days - Preventable hospital stays - Sexually transmitted diseases - Smoking, including during pregnancy - Supply of primary care physicians and mental health providers Participants then were asked to discuss whether the identified, unfavorable indicators accurately identified the most significant community health issues and were encouraged to add issues that they believed were significant. Several issues were added, such as: opioid abuse, the number of uninsured, childhood trauma, and suicide. Obesity was added as a factor that contributes to diabetes. During the meeting, a range of other topics was discussed, including: - Access to healthy food - Suicide (not related to overdoses) among the younger population - Teen pregnancy - Screen time - Purdue University students contributing to the poverty rate After discussing the needs identified through secondary data and adding others to the list, each participant was asked through a voting process to identify ""three to five"" they consider to be most significant. From this process, the group identified the following needs as most significant in Tippecanoe County: - Diabetes and obesity - Opioid abuse - Supply of primary care physicians - Supply of mental health providers The group decided it would be best to split the supply of primary care physicians and the supply of mental health providers into two distinct needs. Community Meetings Carroll County On April 16, 2018, a meeting of community representatives was held at Wabash & Erie Canal Conference Center in Delphi, the county seat of Carroll County. The meeting was attended by 12 community members invited by IU Health because they represent important community organizations and sectors such as: non-profit organizations, local business, health care providers, local policymakers, and schools. Through this meeting, IU Health sought a breadth of perspectives on the communitys health needs. The specific organizations represented at the meeting are listed below. - Carroll County Chamber of Commerce - Carroll County Council - Carroll White Rural Electric Membership Corporation (REMC) - Delphi Community Elementary School - Family Health Clinics (North Central Nursing Clinics) - IU Health Arnett Hospital - IU Health West Central Region - North Central Health Services The meeting began with a presentation that discussed the goals and status of the CHNA process and the purpose of the community meeting. Then, secondary data were presented, along with a summary of the most unfavorable community health indicators. For Carroll County, those indicators were (in alphabetical order): - Cancer incidence and mortality - Diabetes - Physical inactivity and access to exercise opportunities - Physically and mentally unhealthy days - Preventable hospital stays - Sexually transmitted diseases - Smoking, including during pregnancy - Supply of primary care physicians and mental health providers Participants then were asked to discuss whether the identified, unfavorable indicators accurately identified the most significant community health issues and were encouraged to add issues that they believed were significant. Several issues were added, such as: opioid use, pharmacy care, and urgent/emergency care. During the meeting, a range of other topics was discussed, including: - Children/youth - Follow up care - Pharmacy access - Transportation After discussing the needs identified through secondary data and adding others to the list, each participant was asked through a voting process to identify ""three to five"" they consider to be most significant. From this process, the group identified the following needs as most significant for Carroll County: - Supply of primary care physicians and mental health providers - Physical inactivity and access to exercise opportunities - Opioid use - Urgent/Emergency Care - Physically and mentally unhealthy days - Pharmacy Care - Cancer Incidence and Mortality - Diabetes Key Stakeholder Interviews An interview was conducted with a representative from the Benton County Health Department, and the feedback was consistent with the input received during the Community Meetings. An interview was conducted with a representative of the Tippecanoe County Health Department. The interview was conducted to assure that appropriate and additional input was received from a governmental public health official. The individual that was interviewed for Tippecanoe County participated in the community meeting. Accordingly, the results of the community meeting were discussed and insights were sought regarding significant community health needs, why such needs are present, and how they can be addressed. The interview was guided by a structured protocol that focused on opinions regarding significant community health needs, describing why such needs are present, and seeking ideas for how to address them. The interviewee confirmed that the four needs identified by the community meeting participants were significant, adding that all four rank fairly evenly in terms of their prevalence and significance. These four needs were: - Diabetes and obesity - Opioid abuse - Supply of primary care physicians - Supply of mental health providers ""Diabetes and obesity"" was identified as particularly prevalent in low income populations who struggle to afford and access healthy foods. The shortage of primary care and mental health providers is ""realis made more challenging because existing professionals typically only are available to patients during business hours. The supply of mental health providers contributes to opioid abuse, because those unable to access mental health services may be self-medicating. Homelessness also was described as a contributing factor to substance abuse. Many recovering or suffering from addiction have trouble finding stable housing, leading to continued drug abuse. Affordable housing for low income and Section 8 residents is needed. Many residents are uninsured or underinsured, leading to inadequate access to care. For underinsured individuals, many providers are out of network, presenting significant access barriers. Many community residents do not own cars. A lack of transportation options presents another barrier to accessing care. Bringing health services to people in their homes would be helpful. Due to inadequate access to primary care, many use emergency departments for basic health care service. This is particularly true for low income residents who, at the end of the month, exhaust their food, medication, and other basic-needs assistance. Programs that seek to improve the health of low income populations would enhance job retention, education levels, and housing stability. Maternal and child health services also are needed. Pregnant women in Tippecanoe County (and Indiana in general)"

Healthy Communities of Clinton County Coalition offers numerous health services to new and expecting mothers. IU Health Arnett provides maternity services in the region, as well as post-partum and breastfeeding support groups for new mothers. As a system, IU Health is addressing maternal and child health by focusing on infant mortality, creating a system-wide collaborative to focus on this issue. Obesity and Diabetes IU Health Arnett focused on obesity prevention as one of the priority health needs from 2015-2018. The hospital supported many activities in the community. However, during the 2018 community health needs assessment, other needs arose as more necessary to address. There are other community resources that continue to address obesity and diabetes, including Healthy Active Tippecanoe. The hospital provides diabetes education programs. The local YMCA provides a Diabetes Prevention Program. Purdue Extension is another community resource that addresses obesity and diabetes. IU Health team members will continue to participate in the Healthy Active Tippecanoe, which addresses healthy eating and active living. Social Determinants of Health Many of the strategies will indirectly address various social determinants of health. IU Health team members often serve on agency boards or participate in local coalitions addressing the social determinants of health."

201923189349314362,263162145,"Schedule H, Part V, Section B, Line 13h Other FAP Factors","IU Health Arnett takes into consideration several other factors in determining patient eligibility for financial assistance. These factors include the following: 1. IU Healths Individual Solutions Department Prior to seeking Financial Assistance under the FAP, all patients or their guarantors must consult with a member of IU Healths Individual Solutions department to determine if healthcare coverage may be obtained from a government insurance/assistance product or from the Health Insurance Exchange Marketplace. 2. Alternate Sources of Assistance When technically feasible, a patient will exhaust all other state and federal assistance programs prior to receiving an award from IU Health Arnetts Financial Assistance Program. Patients who may be eligible for coverage under an applicable insurance policy, including, but not limited to, health, automobile, and homeowners, must exhaust all insurance benefits prior to receiving an award from IU Health Arnetts Financial Assistance Program. This includes patients covered under their own policy and those who may be entitled to benefits from a third-party policy. Patients may be asked to show proof that such a claim was properly submitted to the proper insurance provider at the request of IU Health Arnett. Eligible patients who receive medical care from IU Health Arnett as a result of an injury proximately caused by a third party, and later receive a monetary settlement or award from said third party, may receive Financial Assistance for any outstanding balance not covered by the settlement or award to which IU Health Arnett is entitled. In the event a Financial Assistance Award has already been granted in such circumstances, IU Health Arnett reserves the right to reverse the award in an amount equal to the amount IU Health Arnett would be entitled to receive had no Financial Assistance been awarded. 3. Alternate Methods of Eligibility Determination IU Health Arnett will conduct a quarterly review of all accounts placed with a collection agency partner for a period of no less than one hundred and twenty (120) days after the account is eligible for an Extraordinary Collection Action (""ECA""). Said accounts may be eligible for assistance under the FAP based on the patients individual scoring criteria. To ensure all patients potentially eligible for Financial Assistance under the FAP may receive Financial Assistance, IU Health Arnett will deem patients/guarantors to be presumptively eligible for Financial Assistance if they are found to be eligible for one of the following programs, received emergency or direct admit care, and satisfied his/her required co-pay/deductible: - Indiana Childrens Special Health Care Services - Medicaid - Healthy Indiana Plan - Patients who are awarded Hospital Presumptive Eligibility (HPE) - Enrolled in a state and/or federal program that verifies the patient's gross household income is less than or equal to 200% of the Federal Poverty Level 4. Additional Considerations Financial Assistance may be granted to a deceased patients account if said patient is found to have no estate. Additionally, IU Health Arnett will deny or revoke Financial Assistance for any patient or guarantor who falsifies any portion of a Financial Assistance application. 5. Non-Emergent Services Down Payment Uninsured Patients presenting for scheduled or other non-emergent services will not be charged more than the Amounts Generally Billed (""AGB"") AGB for their services. Patients will receive an estimated AGB cost of their care prior to IU Health Arnett rendering the services and will be asked to pay a down-payment percentage of the AGB adjusted cost prior to receiving services. In the event a patient is unable to fulfill the down-payment, their service may be rescheduled for a later date as medically prudent and in accordance with all applicable federal and state laws and/or regulations. 6. Emergency Services Non-Refundable Deposit This section will be implemented with a strict adherence to EMTALA and IU Health Policy ADM 1.32, Screening and Transfer of Emergency or Unstable Patients. Amount of Non-Refundable Deposit All Uninsured Patients presenting for services at IU Health Arnetts Emergency Department, via transfer from another hospital facility, or direct admission, will be responsible for a one-hundred dollar ($100.00) non-refundable deposit for services rendered. Patients/guarantors will be responsible for any copays and/or deductibles required by their plan prior to full Financial Assistance being applied. Uninsured Patients wishing to make an application for Financial Assistance greater than the AGB must fulfill their non-refundable deposit prior to IU Health Arnett processing said application. Uninsured Patients making payments toward their outstanding non-refundable deposit balance will have said payments applied to their oldest application on file, if applicable."
