The CHNA process began with a thorough review of the previous cycles needs assessment report. Although there were very pertinent and important findings in the report, it was agreed that this CHNA process would try to surpass the input from the previous needs assessment and focus on reaching a substantial number of individuals for input outside of the Morgantown area and outside the WVU Hopsitals organization. The 2016 CHNA took input from persons who represented a broad interest of the community served including but not limited to the Monongalia County Health Department Director, Chair of the WVUH Pediatric Department/Director of the Rural Health Institute, a transportation official, an elected county official, county school representatives, WVUH representatives, Executive Director of Milan Puskar Health Right Free-Clinic, Morgantown Chamber of Commerce members, as well as others from various community organizations.

WVUH is worked towards additional ways to address the identified needs listed in the CHNA while partnering with area organizations to help address needs identified by the CNHA but not directly being addressed by WVUH such as STDs and STIs. The issue of STDs and STIs is being addressed through the WVUH Infectious Disease Department collaborating with the Center for Disease Control. This program is funded by grants and is not an expense to WVUH. WVUH felt that this was the most effective way to deal with certain needs as to not duplicate services or cause confusion related to where the community can seek help for such needs. An update on WVUHs progress on the needs identified is being prepared and will be released in 2019.

RELEVANT NATIONAL, STATE AND CITY HEALTH DATA AND NEEDS ASSESSMENT RESULTS WERE ALSO UTILIZED TO DRIVE COMMUNITY PROGRAMMING. OUR APPROACH IN IDENTIFYING, PRIORITIZING AND SELECTING SIGNIFICANT HEALTH NEEDS IS DESCRIBED BELOW: INPUT FROM INTERNAL STAKEHOLDERS- RECOGNIZING THAT THE DEVELOPMENT OF COMMUNITY HEALTH PROGRAMMING REQUIRES A CONCERTED EFFORT BY ALL MEMBERS OF THE ORGANIZATION, WE INVOLVED VARIOUS REPRESENTATIVES FROM HSS DEPARTMENTS. THE KNOWLEDGE AND EXPERIENCE OF PHYSICIANS, NURSES, SOCIAL WORKERS AND OTHER STAFF THAT HAVE A VESTED INTEREST IN SERVING THE COMMUNITY WAS ESSENTIAL IN IDENTIFYING AND ADDRESSING THE COMMUNITY'S HEALTH NEEDS. AN INTERNAL STAKEHOLDER MEETING WAS HELD ON MAY 26, 2016 WITH 15 HSS STAFF TO DISCUSS IDENTIFIED HEALTH PRIORITIES AND EXPLORE AREAS FOR IMPLEMENTING INITIATIVES, USING RESULTS FROM THE CHNA AND STAKEHOLDERS' AWARENESS OF COMMUNITY NEEDS TO GUIDE THE DISCUSSION. THE GROUP DISCUSSED FOCUSING ON INCREASING ACCESS TO HIGH QUALITY, CULTURALLY RELEVANT CHRONIC DISEASE PREVENTIVE CARE AND MANAGEMENT OF MUSCULOSKELETAL AND RHEUMATOLOGIC CONDITIONS AND REDUCING OBESITY IN ADULTS AND CHILDREN, WHICH ALIGNS WITH THE NYSDOH CSP PRIORITY AREAS. INPUT FROM COMMUNITY PARTNERS- FEEDBACK FROM COMMUNITY PARTNER ORGANIZATIONS WAS CRITICAL TO DRIVING THE ASSESSMENT AND SELECTION OF PUBLIC HEALTH PRIORITIES FOR THE HOSPITAL. USING RESULTS OF THE CHNA AS THE BASIS FOR DISCUSSION, HSS AND ITS PARTNERS EXCHANGED VALUABLE INFORMATION REGARDING COMMUNITY NEEDS, EXPLORED AREAS FOR FUTURE COLLABORATION, AND SOLIDIFIED A MUTUAL COMMITMENT TO ADVANCING PUBLIC HEALTH. FURTHERMORE, COMMUNITY PARTNER KNOWLEDGE OF THEIR RESPECTIVE COMMUNITY HELPED TO IDENTIFY GAPS IN COMMUNITY PROGRAMMING - OR MORE SPECIFICALLY, AREAS WHERE HSS COULD USE ITS AREAS OF EXPERTISE TO MAKE A LASTING PUBLIC HEALTH IMPACT. OVERALL, FEEDBACK FROM THESE MEETINGS SOLIDIFIED THE DIRECTION FOR PROGRAMS THAT IMPROVE THE COMMUNITY'S DIET AND INCREASE PHYSICAL ACTIVITY TO COMBAT OBESITY AMONG CHILDREN AND ADULTS, EXAMINE SPECIFIC COMMUNITIES IN NEED OF CHRONIC DISEASE PREVENTIVE CARE AND MANAGEMENT OF MUSCULOSKELETAL AND RHEUMATOLOGIC CONDITIONS, AND PROVIDE CULTURALLY RELEVANT EDUCATION REGARDING MUSCULOSKELETAL AND RHEUMATOLOGIC ISSUES. HSS MET WITH THE GREATER NEW YORK HOSPITAL ASSOCIATION (GNYHA), A TRADE ASSOCIATION, TO INFORM THE STRUCTURE AND PROCESS FOR SELECTING ITS PUBLIC HEALTH PRIORITIES. IN-PERSON MEETINGS AND CONFERENCE CALLS WITH GNYHA WERE HELD ON 07/21/15, 07/28/15, 01/15/16, 03/11/16, 04/8/16, 04/13/16, 04/28/16, AND 05/09/16 TO DISCUSS THE NYS DOH CSP REQUIREMENTS AND FEDERAL REQUIREMENTS FOR THE CHNA. HSS ALSO ATTENDED ONE OF THE 29 COMMUNITY CONSULTATIONS HOSTED BY THE NYC DOHMH TAKE CARE NEW YORK ON JANUARY 26, 2016 IN CENTRAL HARLEM TO FOSTER CONTINUED PARTNERSHIP IN IMPROVING HEALTH NEEDS OF NEW YORKERS. THESE COMMUNITY CONSULTATIONS PROVIDED NEW YORKERS THE OPPORTUNITY TO RANK HEALTH INDICATORS OUTLINED IN THE TCNY 2020, AND DISCUSS HEALTH GOALS OF THE COMMUNITY AND RESOURCES THAT HELP MEET THESE GOALS. OUR INVOLVEMENT IN THIS PROCESS PROVIDED VALUABLE INSIGHT INTO THE PUBLIC'S NEEDS AND HELPED IN GUIDING THE SELECTION OF PUBLIC HEALTH NEEDS TO ENSURE IT RESONATES WITH THE HEALTH CARE NEEDS OF NEW YORKERS. IN ADDRESSING THE NYS PREVENTION AGENDA, CONFERENCE CALLS AND IN-PERSON MEETINGS WERE HELD WITH THE NYCDOH ON 03/21/16, 04/18/16 AND 06/08/16 TO EXPLORE AREAS OF PARTNERSHIP.

NINE INDIVIDUALS FROM THE COMMUNITY PARTNER ORGANIZATIONS ATTENDED THIS MEETING AT WHICH WE SHARED THE CHNA RESULTS, ELICITED FEEDBACK AND RANKED HEALTH ISSUES ACCORDING TO THE COMMUNITIES THEY SERVE. CHNA RESULTS WERE RECEIVED POSITIVELY AND THERE WAS EXTENSIVE DISCUSSION ABOUT HOW RESULTS ACCURATELY DEPICTED THE VARIOUS COMMUNITIES SERVED AND HOW THESE RESULTS COULD BE USED TO IMPACT THE COMMUNITY AT LARGE. SPECIFICALLY, THERE WERE DISCUSSIONS ABOUT ACCESS TO EDUCATIONAL PROGRAMS AND WAYS IN WHICH HSS COULD EXTEND THE REACH OF ITS PROGRAMS. INPUT FROM THE GENERAL PUBLIC- TO FURTHER HSS' COMMITMENT TO DEVELOPING PROGRAMS THAT IMPROVE COMMUNITY HEALTH, OBTAINING FEEDBACK FROM THE PUBLIC AND PATIENT COMMUNITY WAS ALSO INSTRUMENTAL IN DRIVING THE HOSPITAL'S SELECTION OF SIGNIFICANT HEALTH NEEDS. OUR APPROACH IN SOLICITING INPUT FROM THE PUBLIC IS DESCRIBED BELOW. COMMUNITY FORUMS- FOUR COMMUNITY FORUMS WERE HELD TO ALLOW COMMUNITY MEMBERS AN OPPORTUNITY TO PRIORITIZE HEALTH NEEDS THAT PROVIDED HSS WITH THE APPROPRIATE DIRECTION IN SELECTING ITS PUBLIC HEALTH PRIORITIES. THE MAIN COMMUNICATION CHANNEL FOR NOTIFYING THE PUBLIC ABOUT THE FORUMS WERE THROUGH FLYERS DISTRIBUTED AT HSS COMMUNITY PROGRAMS AND OUTPATIENT CLINICS AND POSTING ON DIGITAL MEDIA (WEB, FACEBOOK AND TWITTER). IN ADDITION, ANNOUNCEMENTS WERE MADE DURING PUBLIC AND PATIENT PROGRAMS HELD AT HSS, AND A POSTER WAS STRATEGICALLY PLACED IN A HIGH TRAFFIC AREA OF THE HOSPITAL TO PUBLICIZE THE MEETING. FURTHERMORE, IN ORDER TO REACH AT-RISK AND MINORITY POPULATIONS, HSS PARTNERED WITH SENIOR CENTERS IN MANHATTAN AND CHINATOWN TO ADVERTISE COMMUNITY FORUMS TO THEIR COMMUNITY MEMBERS. SPECIFIC DATES, LOCATIONS, AND ATTENDANCE FOR THESE COMMUNITY FORUMS WERE AS FOLLOWS: . MAY 17, 2016 AT LENOX HILL NEIGHBORHOOD HOUSE, MANHATTAN (11 PEOPLE PRESENT) .

MAY 25, 2016 AT THE SENIOR HEALTH AND FITNESS DAY, HSS (17 PEOPLE PRESENT) COMMUNITY MEMBERS WERE ASKED TO RANK THE HEALTH NEEDS MOST IMPORTANT TO THEM AND GIVE THEIR PERSPECTIVE ON COMMUNITY HEALTH ISSUES IN AN OPEN DISCUSSION. EACH SIGNIFICANT HEALTH NEED IDENTIFIED IN THE CHNA RESULTS WERE RANKED FROM 1 TO 22. ALL RANKINGS WERE ADDED TOGETHER ACROSS EACH LOCATION AND HEALTH ISSUES WERE RE-RANKED BASED ON THEIR OVERALL SCORE. COMMUNITY HEALTH NEEDS THAT WERE CONSIDERED SIGNIFICANT WERE RANKED AMONG THE TOP FIVE OF IDENTIFIED NEEDS, WHICH ARE - . OSTEOARTHRITIS/OSTEOPOROSIS/RHEUMATOID ARTHRITIS . MUSCLE, BONE AND JOINT PAIN . FATIGUE . FALLS . OBESITY"

202041339349302829,310538525,"PART V, SECTION B, LINE 11","The Christ Hospital (TCH) conducted a community health needs assessment in Fiscal Year 2019 (July 1, 2018 - June 30, 2019) and sought input from a variety of community partners to gain valuable insight into the overall health and well-being of the community we serve. One of our primary partners in this endeavor was The Health Collaborative, a nonprofit organization that works with its member hospitals on healthcare improvement projects and shares best practices. The Health Collaborative brought local hospitals together for the third time and led the effort to better understand the health needs of the community. Their community report shares data for the Southwest Ohio region (including Greater Dayton and Greater Cincinnati, which include Northern Kentucky and Southeastern Indiana). Service areas of hospitals vary, so this approach provides the most thorough picture of health needs locally and regionally. Along with the data produced by The Health Collaborative, TCH has analyzed a variety of data sources including public health data, health risk factor surveys, socioeconomic needs assessments, environmental standards and existing programs that had been developed for residents in the Greater Cincinnati region. In addition, TCH also sought to review any written comments received regarding community health needs in the previous assessment. The priorities were determined by the number of votes in the community meetings, the number of mentions on surveys, and areas where data demonstrated performance worse than state or national benchmarks or trending in the wrong direction and impacting at least 16 counties (secondary data). The 5 identified priorities ranked in the top 8 for all primary data sources. The prevalent health concerns identified in the Hamilton County area through this needs assessment include: Substance Abuse Mental Health Access to Care Chronic Heart Disease Healthy Behaviors Through a collaborative and meticulous process, TCH and its community partners have reviewed the most prevalent health concerns in Hamilton County and have established a course of action. This Implementation Plan focuses on programs, research, and education geared to target the prevalent health concerns facing the residents of Hamilton County. It is TCH's goal to make a measurable impact on the health of our community. We recognize that community health needs are broad and comprehensive. While we bring our expertise and leadership to addressing these needs, we also understand that one entity's expertise cannot be broad enough to be the sole answer. Collaborations and partnerships are key to meeting those needs, and we partner with community organizations that complement our resources. The Implementation Plan was approved by TCH Board of Directors on 10/16/2019. Due to the complexity of substance abuse, the approach to addressing this will be through a partnership and supportive role, which will also include exploration into the underlying problems leading to addiction in order gather insights for prevention and quality treatment. TCH will engage TCH staff with the Hamilton County Heroin Task Force, with a goal to reduce the number of deaths from heroin overdoses. TCH's partnership with the Hamilton County Heroin Task Force will include a group of hospital members who will engage and proactively work in partnership with the Task Force. The main areas of focus and expertise for the Task Force include prevention, treatment, harm reduction, law enforcement, and first responders. TCH will implement a Controlled Substance Policy. The policy will include a definition of controlled substances, guidance on prescription distribution and fulfillment, patient use of controlled substances and appropriate monitoring of suspicious behavior, with a goal of reducing the prescribing of high dose opiates, which will, in turn, help manage the exposure and distribution of opiates and reduce the availability of substances in the community. In July 2019, TCH established an Outpatient Behavioral Health Program, which includes substance abuse treatment with a goal of providing expanded access to treatment and prevention through the hospital Outpatient program. As previously noted, TCH opened Behavioral Health Outpatient Clinic at its Mt. Auburn campus in July 2019 to serve the needs of patients with mental health and substance abuse conditions. This includes partial hospitalization, intensive outpatient services and treatment.

FOLLOWING THE 2016 CHNA METHODOLOGY AND GUIDELINES SET FORTH BY THE CATHOLIC HEALTH ASSOCIATION OF THE UNITED STATES (CHA) IN COLLABORATION WITH VIZIENT INCORPORATED, AND HEALTHY COMMUNITIES INSTITUTE, THE BEEBE CHNA PROCESS ADHERED TO THE FOLLOWING STEPS: STEP 1: PLAN AND PREPARE FOR THE ASSESSMENT STEP 2: DETERMINE THE PURPOSE AND SCOPE OF THE CHNA STEP 3: IDENTIFY DATA THAT DESCRIBES THE HEALTH AND NEEDS OF THE COMMUNITY STEP 4: UNDERSTAND AND INTERPRET THE DATA STEP 5: DEFINE AND VALIDATE PRIORITIES STEP 6: DOCUMENT AND COMMUNICATE RESULTS. IN AN EFFORT TO DEVELOP A SOCIAL, ECONOMIC AND HEALTH PORTRAIT OF BEEBE HEALTHCARES PRIORITY COMMUNITIES AND TO MITIGATE LIMITATIONS WITH UTILIZING SOLELY SECONDARY DATA SOURCES FOR A POPULATION THAT IS RURAL IN MAJORITY, BEEBE HEALTHCARE DECIDED IT WAS IMPERATIVE IN 2018-2019 TO CONTINUE TO ENGAGE AND UTILIZE PRIMARY DATA SOURCES. IT IS IMPORTANT TO RECOGNIZE SEVERAL DATA LIMITATIONS WHEN INTERPRETING RESULTS FOR CITIES AND TOWNS AS SOME DATA EXIST ONLY AT A COUNTY-WIDE OR STATE-WIDE LEVEL OF DETAIL, SUCH AS COUNTY HEALTH RANKINGS AND COMMUNITY HEALTH STATUS INDICATORS. THOSE DATA SOURCES DO NOT ALLOW ASSESSING HEALTH NEEDS AT A MORE GRANULAR LEVEL OF DETAIL, SUCH AS BY ZIP CODE OR CENSUS TRACT. THEREFORE, AN IDEAL APPROACH INCORPORATES BOTH PRIMARY AND SECONDARY DATA. IN ORDER TO FULLY INCORPORATE THE PRIMARY DATA ELEMENTS, THE 2018-2019 CHNA TEAM CONDUCTED FOCUS GROUPS WITH REPRESENTATIVES FROM COMMUNITY-BASED ORGANIZATIONS AND SERVICE AGENCIES THROUGH THEIR PARTNERSHIP WITH SUSSEX COUNTY HEALTH COALITION, STAKEHOLDER INTERVIEWS, AND ONLINE SURVEYS. BY GATHERING INFORMATION FROM LOCAL RESIDENTS AND AREA ORGANIZATIONS, BEEBE HEALTHCARE AIMS TO GATHER CURRENT INFORMATION REGARDING THE PRIORITY NEEDS OF THOSE LIVING IN THE SERVICE AREA. ADDITIONAL DATA WAS ALSO COLLECTED THROUGH COMPLETION OF A COMMUNITY HEALTH SURVEY BY AREA RESIDENTS, COMMUNITY PARTNERS, LOCAL BUSINESSES AND HEALTH CARE PROVIDERS. IN 2018-2019, A PORTION OF THE SUSSEX COUNTY HOMELESS POPULATION WAS SURVEYED AT THE LOCAL HOMELESS SHELTERS THROUGH AN ESTABLISHED PARTNERSHIP WITH THE LOCAL COMMUNITY RESOURCE CENTER. DATA WAS ORGANIZED AND ANALYZED BY BEEBES POPULATION HEALTH DEPARTMENT STAFF. DEDICATED TEAM MEMBERS WERE RESPONSIBLE FOR COLLECTING CURRENT DEMOGRAPHIC INFORMATION FROM THE DELAWARE POPULATION CONSORTIUM, U.S. CENSUS BUREAU AND THE DELAWARE HEALTH TRACKER. INCLUDED IN THE PROCESS WAS A COMMUNITY ASSETS AND RESOURCE ANALYSIS, WHICH WAS A WEIGHTED CONSIDERATION IN THE OVERALL ASSESSMENT AND RATIONALE FOR PRIORITIZED COMMUNITY NEEDS. THE COMMUNITY HEALTH NEEDS ASSESSMENT FINAL REPORT REFLECTS THE ANALYSIS OF PRIMARY DATA COLLECTED VIA SURVEYS IN CONJUNCTION WITH THE SECONDARY DATA OBTAINED FROM ALL OF THE AVAILABLE NATIONAL DATA SOURCES THAT ARE ACCESSIBLE THROUGH DATA REPOSITORIES SUCH AS THE DELAWARE HEALTH TRACKER. THE BEEBE COMMUNITY HEALTH WORKGROUP SYNTHESIZED THE INFORMATION AND EVALUATED THE RESULTS OF THE DATA COLLECTION AND ANALYSIS USING THE PRINCIPLES OF THE ROBERT WOOD JOHNSON FOUNDATION COUNTY HEALTH RANKINGS MODEL, INCORPORATING CONSIDERATION OF THE ROLE OF SOCIAL DETERMINANTS OF HEALTH IN PROMOTING HEALTH AND HEALTH EQUITY. ULTIMATELY, PRIORITIES WERE ESTABLISHED BY EVALUATING ALL OF THE IDENTIFIED NEEDS IN THE CONTEXT OF THE FEASIBILITY, STRENGTHS AND RESOURCES OF THE BEEBE HEALTHCARE SYSTEM."

THE LIST OF ORGANIZATIONS INTERVIEWED IS IDENTIFIED IN THE CHNA AND THE NAMES OF THE INTERVIEWEES ARE ON FILE. FOCUS GROUPS IN EACH OF THE FOUR COUNTIES IN OUR COMMUNITY. WE FOCUSED ON RECRUITING LOW-INCOME AND VULNERABLE POPULATIONS TO THE FOCUS GROUPS THAT WE CONDUCTED. WE CONDUCTED 6 FOCUS GROUPS AND HAD A TOTAL OF 48 PARTICIPANTS. WE CONDUCTED 2 GROUPS IN DENVER COUNTY, 1 IN DOUGLAS COUNTY, AND 3 IN LOCATIONS WHERE BOTH ADAMS AND ARAPAHOE COUNTY RESIDENTS COULD PARTICIPATE. PARENT SURVEY IN BOTH ENGLISH AND SPANISH. OUR SURVEY TARGETED PARENTS AND CAREGIVERS OF CHILDREN AGES 0-17 WHO LIVE IN THEIR HOME. PARTICIPANTS WERE RECRUITED VIA CHILDREN'S HOSPITAL EMAIL LISTS AND SOCIAL MEDIA AND THROUGH EMAIL CAMPAIGNS WITH OUR PARTNERS. ADDITIONALLY, WE WORKED CLOSELY WITH THE COMMUNITY CAMPUS PARTNERSHIP (CCP), A NONPROFIT ORGANIZATION THAT FOSTERS COLLABORATIONS BETWEEN THE ANSCHUTZ MEDICAL CAMPUS AND THE SURROUNDING AURORA COMMUNITY NEIGHBORHOODS TO IMPROVE THE HEALTH AND ECONOMIC WELL-BEING OF THE AURORA COMMUNITY. MEMBERS OF THE CCP'S RESIDENT LEADERSHIP COUNCIL, WHO ALL RESIDE NEAR THE MAIN CAMPUS, WEre RECRUITED TO CONDUCT THE SURVEYS IN ADDITIONAL LANGUAGES AND TRANSLATE THE RESPONSES. THEY GREATLY EXPANDED OUR ACCESS TO NON-ENGLISH SPEAKERS WHO RESIDE IN THE THREE ZIP CODES CLOSE TO THE HOSPITAL. IN 2018, ADDITIONAL DEMOGRAPHIC QUESTIONS WERE ADDED TO THE PARENT SURVEY. THIS ALLOWED US TO ANALYZE THE RESULTS IN A MORE IN-DEPTH MANNER. FIRST, AN ANALYSIS OF THE TOP-RATED ISSUES/CONCERNS WAS PERFORMED WITH DIFFERENCES NOTED BETWEEN THE ENGLISH LANGUAGE AND SPANISH LANGUAGE SURVEY RESPONSES. NEXT, WE SORTED RESULTS BY COUNTY AS WELL AS BY INCOME LEVELS TO DETERMINE SIGNIFICANT VARIATIONS IN THE ISSUES IDENTIFIED AS TOP CONCERNS. THIS APPROACH PERMITTED THE TEAM TO GAIN INSIGHT INTO A LARGE CROSS SECTION OF THE POPULATION. IN ALL, 582 RESIDENTS OF OUR FOUR-COUNTY COMMUNITY RESPONDED TO THE SURVEY; 409 IN ENGLISH AND 173 IN SPANISH. THE FOUR COUNTIES WERE FAIRLY EQUALLY REPRESENTED IN THE TOTAL RESPONSES. ONLINE PROVIDER SURVEY. THE PROVIDER SURVEY WAS A NEW ADDITION TO OUR DATA COLLECTION EFFORTS THIS YEAR AND ALLOWED US TO HEAR DIRECTLY FROM HEALTH CARE WORKERS ABOUT THE COMMUNITY NEEDS THEY ARE SEEING IN THEIR PRACTICES. WE HAD 108 PROVIDER RESPONSES FROM PHYSICIANS, SCHOOL NURSES AND OTHER HEALTH CARE PROVIDERS. UNDERSERVED POPULATION INPUT. AS PART OF THIS ASSESSMENT, WE PRIORITIZED GETTING INPUT FROM UNDERSERVED POPULATIONS INCLUDING LOW-INCOME AND MINORITY GROUPS AND GROUPS WHOSE PRIMARY LANGUAGE IS NOT ENGLISH. STAKEHOLDER INTERVIEWS WERE CONDUCTED WITH LEADERS OF ORGANIZATIONS THAT SERVE AND/OR ADVOCATE FOR UNDERSERVED GROUPS. SPECIFIC ORGANIZATIONS IDENTIFIED IN THE CHNA. THE TEAM WORKED WITH COMMUNITY PARTNERS TO ENSURE THAT THE PARENT SURVEY REACHED A SOCIO-ECONOMICALLY AND ETHNICALLY DIVERSE POPULATION. 60% OF OUR RESPONDENTS HAVE A HOUSEHOLD INCOME THAT IS LESS THAN THE STATE'S AVERAGE HOUSEHOLD INCOME OF $75,000 AND 21% HAVE HOUSEHOLD INCOMES OF LESS THAN $25,000. 65% OF OUR RESPONDENTS ARE ETHNIC MINORITIES.

Carilion Clinic's Community Health Needs Assessments (CHNAs) are community-driven projects and success is highly dependent on engaging citizens, health and human service agencies, businesses, and community leaders. Community stakeholder collaborations known as ""Community Health Assessment Teams"" (CHAT) lead the CHNA projects. The CHAT consists of health and human service agency leaders; persons with special knowledge of, or expertise in, public health; the local health department; and leaders, representatives, or members of populations who are medically underserved, low-income, minority, and suffer from chronic diseases. The following organizations served on the CHAT for the 2018 (tax year 2017) Roanoke Valley Community Health Needs Assessment (RVCHNA): Blue Blaze Consulting, Blue Ridge Behavioral Healthcare, Bradley Free Clinic, Carilion Clinic, CHIP of Roanoke Valley, City of Roanoke - Lead Safe Roanoke, Family Service of Roanoke Valley, Freedom First Credit Union, Healthy Roanoke Valley (HRV), High Street Baptist Church, Jefferson College of Health Sciences, Local Environmental Agricultural Project (LEAP), New Horizons Healthcare, Rescue Mission Ministries, Inc., Roanoke College, Roanoke Redevelopment and Housing Authority, Roanoke Regional Chamber of Commerce, Salem VA Medical Center, United Way of Roanoke Valley, and the Virginia Department of Health. In addition to the CHAT, the RVCHNA conducted focus groups among stakeholders and target populations and administered a community health survey. During the CHNA process, community stakeholders, leaders, and providers were encouraged to complete the Stakeholder Survey (print and electronic versions available). This survey provided an additional perspective about the health needs and barriers facing our community. Stakeholder focus groups were conducted with the City of Roanoke (Fire/EMS Station #5 & #6, and Police Department), HRV partners and friends (brought together for a Stakeholder Forum), and the Roanoke Valley Palliative Care Partnership. Target population focus groups were conducted to capture the story of needs and barriers to health for the uninsured, underinsured, low-income, minority, senior, and chronically ill populations. Focus group locations were chosen based on their proximity and convenience to target populations. Ten target population focus groups were held and participants discussed health needs and barriers to health, as well as access to primary, oral, and mental health care. Target population focus groups were conducted with AARP members, a women's group comprised of former immigrants to the United States, a Blue Ridge Literacy English for Speakers of Other Languages (ESOL) class, Bradley Free Clinic patients, residents of Roanoke Redevelopment Housing Authority's Melrose Towers (in the NW Roanoke City Medically Underserved Area (MUA)) and Morningside Manor (in the SE Roanoke City MUA), certified peer recovery specialists, Presbyterian Community Center parents and staff, and Roanoke Rescue Mission guests. A 39-question survey was developed including questions about: socioeconomic factors; access to medical, dental, and mental health care; health behaviors; physical environment; health outcomes; and demographics. The survey included commonly used questions and metrics from previously validated community surveys including: Community Themes and Strengths Assessments, National Association of County and City Health Officials (NACCHO), Mobilizing for Action through Planning and Partnerships (MAPP); Community Healthy Living Index, YMCA; Behavioral Risk Factor Surveillance System, Centers for Disease Control (CDC); National Health Interview Survey, Centers for Disease Control (CDC); Youth Risk Behavior Surveillance System, Centers for Disease Control (CDC); Martin County Community Health Assessment, Martin County, North Carolina; Previous Roanoke Valley Community Health Surveys. English and Spanish versions were available. The CHAT and HRV Data Tracking and Quality Improvement Action Team identified target populations, collection sites, and methods of survey distribution. The population of interest was Roanoke Valley residents 18 years of age and older. The Roanoke Valley included the CHNA service area consisting of Bedford, Botetourt, Craig and Roanoke counties, Roanoke City, and Salem City. Special efforts were made to include the subpopulations of underserved/vulnerable populations disproportionately impacted by the social determinants of health including Income, race/ethnicity, education, and insurance status. The survey was also made available to all residents living in the Roanoke Valley, and oversampling of the target populations occurred through targeted outreach efforts. In total, 2,308 surveys were collected."

Carilion Medical Center's two hospital facilities, Carilion Roanoke Memorial Hospital and Carilion Roanoke Community Hospital, partnered with Healthy Roanoke Valley (HRV) to conduct the 2018 Roanoke Valley Community Health Needs Assessment (RVCHNA) during the 2017 tax year. Healthy Roanoke Valley (HRV), operating under the auspices of the United Way of Roanoke Valley, was formed in 2012 as a community response to needs identified in Carilion Medical Center's triennial Roanoke Valley CHNA. Carilion Clinic is a not-for-profit, integrated healthcare system located in Virginia's Blue Ridge Mountains with its flagship hospital in the heart of the City of Roanoke, the largest urban hub in western Virginia. There, through a comprehensive network of hospitals, primary and specialty physician practices, wellness centers and other complementary services, the system provides quality care close to home for nearly one million Virginians. Carilion's roots go back to 1899 when a group of dedicated citizens came together and built a hospital to meet the healthcare needs of the community. Today, Carilion is a key anchor institution focusing on more than just healthcare; Carilion is dedicated to its mission of improving the health of the communities we serve. With an enduring commitment to the health of our region, Carilion advances care through clinical services, medical education, research and community health investments. Carilion believes in service, collaboration and caring for all. Through ongoing investment in discovering and responding to the health needs of the community comes the understanding that the involvement of additional stakeholders is essential to effectively address community health issues and create change. The purpose of the implementation strategy is to describe what Carilion Medical Center (CMC), comprised of Carilion Roanoke Memorial Hospital (CRMH) and Carilion Roanoke Community Hospital (CRCH), plans to do to address the community health needs identified in the 2018 Roanoke Valley Community Health Needs Assessment (RVCHNA). After all primary and secondary data collection was completed, the CHAT reviewed all data then identified and prioritized the ten most pertinent community needs using the Robert Wood Johnson Foundation framework for what influences health. The data were combined, and overall priorities chosen based on the number of times a category was selected in the top 10, with the average ranking serving as a tiebreaker. Once the priorities were clearly identified, the CHAT rated the feasibility and potential impact of solutions for each health issue. Healthy Roanoke Valley hosted strategic planning and action team tactical planning meetings focused on each identified priority need. The findings of the 2018 RVCHNA revealed 10 priority health-related issues in the community, identified by the CHAT after review of the data collected. (1) Poverty / low average household income, (2) Transportation / transit system, (3) Access to mental / behavioral health services and substance use services, (4) Culture: healthy behaviors not a priority, (5) High uninsured / underinsured population, (6) Affordable / safe housing, (7) Access to dental care, (8) Poor diet, (9) High cost of care, (10) Educational attainment. -CMC Implementation Plan- According to the Robert Wood Johnson Foundation's (RWJF) County Health Rankings , where an individual lives, works and plays is a strong predictor of their health outcomes. Currently, in the United States, a person's zip code can help predict their life expectancy due to its direct link to the social determinants of health such as poverty, race/ethnicity, education and employment status in these areas . These factors are so important to our overall health that they were added to the 10-year national Healthy People 2020 objectives to ""create social and physical environments that promote good health for all."" Carilion responds to community health needs in innovative ways: making sure our regions have access to state-of-the-art health care close to home; providing community grants and sponsorships to extend our mission and support other organizations addressing health needs; creating and implementing community-wide strategies to reduce barriers, coordinate resources and enhance community strengths; and providing community-based health and wellness programs. Carilion Clinic's response strategies are organized by the RWJF framework for what influences health, which include health behaviors, social and economic factors, clinical care access and quality, and physical environment. Commitment to community service is evident at all levels of the organization. Carilion's commitment to community health is evidenced by its commitment to a population health infrastructure including a Community Health and Outreach (CHO) department dedicated to assessing and addressing community needs. The department is responsible for leading and facilitating the Community Health Improvement Plan (CHIP), CHNAs, the system's community grant process, community health education, community benefit collection, and neighborhood health initiatives. CHO has staff at the system level and each community hospital and works with each hospital's Board of Directors and Carilion Clinic's Board of Governors to create health improvement strategies to address community health needs. A Community Benefit Council provides oversight and strategic guidance for Carilion's community health improvement work and for community benefit strategy, collection and submission. -Community Partnerships- Carilion Clinic believes in the power of collaboration and understands community health issues must be addressed in cooperation with the community. To ensure lasting community impact from the health assessment and community health improvement process. Carilion participates in and provides financial and in-kind support to community health coalitions addressing health needs in the Roanoke Valley such as HRV. In addition, Carilion partners with multiple community and business organizations to improve health and wellness and to impact the social determinants of health for all who live in the Roanoke Valley. -Healthy Roanoke Valley- Forming a true community collaborative with lasting impact is no small feat. In 2012, using the Strive Collective Impact model, Carilion and United Way played key convening roles, bringing together strategic community partners to create HRV. An initiative of United Way of Roanoke Valley, HRV is now a partnership of more than 50 organizations striving to enhance health equity related to these priorities as a means to create a ""culture of wellness"" across the Roanoke Valley. For years, HRV has been serving as a key partner with Carilion Clinic. HRV's strategic framework was updated to align with the triennial Community Health Needs Assessment. This is a community-driven process and a major component of Carilion Clinic's Health Improvement Implementation Strategy for the Roanoke Valley. Through strategic planning in response to the 2018 Roanoke Valley Community Health Needs Assessment priorities, HRV identified four goals: 1. Reduce barriers to resources that address the social determinants of health; 2. Expand access to quality care and support a culture of health; 3. Encourage and support lifestyle behaviors that result in improved health and wellbeing; 4. Support and advocate for natural and built environments that cultivate vibrant neighborhoods. Carilion provides both financial and in-kind support to HRV with representatives active on the HRV steering committee and all five action teams: wellness; mental health; primary care; oral health; and coordination of care. Through HRV, multiple programs and strategies have arisen in response to community needs, such as Fresh Foods Rx and the Pathways Community HUB. Carilion provides additional support to implement these strategies in the Roanoke Valley. (Continued in Schedule H, Part VI)"

PRIORITIZATION OF NEEDS WAS DETERMINED BY THE FORT SMITH COMMUNITY HEALTH COUNCIL, WHICH IS COMPRISED OF LOCAL COMMUNITY LEADERS. THE TOP HEALTH NEEDS TO THE FORT SMITH COMMUNITY ARE: ACCESS TO CARE, BEHAVIORAL HEALTH AND NUTRITION. ACCESS TO CARE: WHILE FACILITATING LOCAL COMMUNITY FOCUS GROUPS WITH OUR MARGINALIZED POPULATION WE DISCOVERED THAT MUCH OF THE COMMUNITY LACKED THE RESOURCES FOR OBTAINING HEALTH CARE SERVICES. THIS REMAINS AN ISSUE DUE TO THE UNDERINSURED OR COMPLETELY UNINSURED STATUS ALONG WITH OTHER OBSTACLES TO CARE LIKE TRANSPORTATION. THE SEBASTIAN COUNTY UNINSURED RATE OF 14% IS HIGHER THAN THE ARKANSAS RATE OF 12%. ACCOMPANYING THE HEALTHCARE COVERAGE ISSUES ARE THE SOCIOECONOMIC BARRIERS. THE $50,354 MEDIAN FAMILY INCOME OF THE FORT SMITH COMMUNITY STANDS ABOUT THREE THOUSAND DOLLARS LESS THAN THE STATE. BEHAVIORAL HEALTH: LOCAL FOCUS GROUPS, MEETINGS AND SURVEYS ALONG WITH NATIONAL AND STATE DATA HIGHLIGHT THE NEED FOR BEHAVIORAL HEALTH. THERE IS AN INCREASING NUMBER OF YOUTH AND ADULTS IN THE COMMUNITY THAT ARE EXPERIENCING ANXIETY PROBLEMS, SUICIDAL THOUGHTS, AND SUBSTANCE ABUSE. THE STAKEHOLDER FOCUS GROUP DISCUSSION HIGHLIGHTED ACCESS MENTAL HEALTH SERVICES WAS LACKING, WHICH IS SUPPORTED BY THE DESIGNATION OF A MENTAL HEALTH PROVIDER SHORTAGE AREA BY THE HEALTH RESOURCES & SERVICES ADMINISTRATION. THESE COMMUNITY MEMBERS ALSO TALKED ABOUT HOW SUBSTANCE USE REMAINS THE TOP SOCIAL BEHAVIOR IMPACTING THE FORT SMITH REGION. WHILE SEBASTIAN COUNTY STANDS AS NUMBER ONE IN THE STATE FOR PRESCRIBING RATES, WITH 153 PRESCRIPTIONS PER 100 PERSONS AS SEEN FROM THE CENTERS FOR DISEASE CONTROL AND PREVENTION. THE SUBSTANCE ABUSE HEALTH CRISIS IS MAGNIFIED BY THE PREVALENCE OF FOSTER CARE AND HIGH RECIDIVISM WITHIN THE COMMUNITY. NUTRITION: THE COMMUNITY VOICE RAISED VARIOUS TIMES THAT NUTRITION REMAINS EXTREMELY IMPACTFUL. BOTH LOCAL SURVEYS AND FOCUS GROUPS PUT THAT POOR EATING HABITS WAS THE TOP RISK BEHAVIOR SEEN IN THEIR COMMUNITY AND HEALTHY COOKING CLASSES BEING UNAVAILABLE TO HELP FIND SOLUTIONS TO THESE HABITS. THE OBESITY AND DIABETES EPIDEMIC HITTING THE REGION HAS VARIOUS CAUSES, ONE OF WHICH IS HEALTHY EATING AND NUTRITION. THE ACCESS TO FAST FOOD AND HIGH-CALORIC/NUTRIENT-POOR OPTIONS ALSO CONTRIBUTES TO THE WEIGHT AND CHRONIC HEALTH CONDITION PREVALENCE IN FORT SMITH. THREE ASSESSED HEALTH ISSUES IDENTIFIED IN THE 2019 CHNA PROCESS CANCER, HOUSING, UNEMPLOYMENT WERE NOT CHOSEN AS PRIORITY FOCUS AREAS FOR DEVELOPMENT OF IMPLEMENTATION STRATEGIES DUE TO MERCY'S CURRENT LACK OF RESOURCES AVAILABLE TO ADDRESS THESE NEEDS. THESE ISSUES WILL BE ADDRESSED INDIRECTLY IN IMPLEMENTATION STRATEGIES DEVELOPED TO MEET THE PRIORITIZED NEEDS IN AREAS THAT MAY OVERLAP. FOR EXAMPLE, EFFORTS TO REDUCE THE INCIDENCE OF OBESITY IN THE COMMUNITY MAY ALSO REDUCE THE INCIDENCE OF CANCER. ADDITIONALLY, RELATED COMMUNITY PARTNERSHIPS, EVIDENCE-BASED PROGRAMMING, AND SOURCES OF FINANCIAL AND OTHER RESOURCES WILL BE EXPLORED DURING THE NEXT THREE-YEAR CHIP CYCLE.

SCHEDULE H, PART V, SECTION B, LINE 5 (A, 1) INPUT FROM COMMUNITY REPRESENTATIVES THE PROCESS OF COLLECTING QUALITATIVE COMMUNITY INPUT TOOK THREE MAIN FORMS: COMMUNITY RESIDENT FOCUS GROUPS, A NONPROFIT AND GOVERNMENT STAKEHOLDER FOCUS GROUP, AND A COMMUNITY FORUM. EACH GROUP WAS DESIGNED TO CAPTURE THE COLLECTED KNOWLEDGE AND OPINIONS OF PEOPLE WHO LIVE AND WORK IN THE COMMUNITIES SERVED BY COVENANT HEALTH. WE DEVELOPED A PROTOCOL (NOTED IN CHNA APPENDIX 3B, POSTED ON THE COVENANT WEBSITE) FOR EACH GROUP TO ENSURE CONSISTENCY ACROSS INDIVIDUAL FOCUS GROUPS, ALTHOUGH THE FACILITATORS HAD SOME DISCRETION ON ASKING FOLLOW-UP QUESTIONS OR PROBES AS THEY SAW FIT. INVITATION AND RECRUITMENT PROCEDURES VARIED FOR EACH TYPE OF GROUP. CHNA APPENDIX 3, AVAILABLE ONLINE, ON COVENANT HEALTH WEBSITE, INCLUDES A FULL REPORT OF THE COMMUNITY INPUT PROCESS AND FINDINGS ALONG WITH DESCRIPTIONS OF THE PARTICIPANTS. SPRING 2017 - RESIDENT FOCUS GROUPS: FOR COMMUNITY RESIDENT GROUPS, COMMUNITY BENEFIT STAFF, IN COLLABORATION WITH THEIR COMMITTEES AND THE SYSTEM OFFICE, IDENTIFIED GEOGRAPHIC AREAS WHERE DATA SUGGESTED THERE WERE SIGNIFICANT HEALTH, PHYSICAL ENVIRONMENT, AND SOCIOECONOMIC CONCERNS. THIS PROCESS ALSO IDENTIFIED THE LANGUAGE NEEDS OF THE COMMUNITY, WHICH DETERMINED THE LANGUAGE IN WHICH EACH FOCUS GROUP WAS CONDUCTED. COMMUNITY BENEFIT STAFF THEN PARTNERED WITH COMMUNITY-BASED ORGANIZATIONS THAT SERVE THOSE AREAS TO RECRUIT FOR AND HOST THE FOCUS GROUPS. THE COMMUNITY-BASED ORGANIZATION DEVELOPED AN INVITATION LIST USING THEIR CONTACTS AND KNOWLEDGE OF THE AREA, AND PARTICIPANTS WERE PROMISED A SMALL INCENTIVE FOR THEIR TIME. DESCRIPTION OF MEDICALLY UNDERSERVED, LOW INCOME AND/OR MINORITY POPULATIONS REPRESENTED IN COMMUNITY INPUT PROCESS: TWO CONSULTANTS STAFFED EACH FOCUS GROUP, SERVING AS FACILITATORS AND NOTE TAKERS. THESE CONSULTANTS WERE NOT DIRECTLY AFFILIATED WITH THE MINISTRY TO ENSURE CANDOR FROM THE PARTICIPANTS. THE DEMOGRAPHICS OF THE RESIDENT FOCUS GROUPS ARE AS FOLLOWS: FEMALE - 81% MALE - 19% RACE/ETHNICITY: HISPANIC/LATINO - 69% NON-LATINO WHITE - 15% BLACK/AFRICAN-AMERICAN - 12% NATIVE AMERICAN 4% CHRONIC CONDITIONS: PERSON WITH CHRONIC CONDITIONS OR A LEADER OR REPRESENTATIVE OF INDIVIDUALS WITH CHRONIC CONDITIONS - 58% INCOME: TOTAL HOUSEHOLD INCOME BEFORE TAXES LESS THAN $20,000 - 68%. SPRING 2017 NONPROFIT & GOVERNMENT STAKEHOLDER FOCUS GROUP: FOR THE NONPROFIT AND GOVERNMENT STAKEHOLDER FOCUS GROUP, COMMUNITY BENEFIT STAFF DEVELOPED A LIST OF LEADERS FROM ORGANIZATIONS THAT SERVE DIVERSE CONSTITUENCIES WITHIN THE HOSPITAL'S SERVICE AREA. MINISTRY STAFF SOUGHT TO INVITE ORGANIZATIONS WITH WHICH THEY HAD EXISTING RELATIONSHIPS, BUT ALSO USED THE FOCUS GROUP AS AN OPPORTUNITY TO BUILD NEW RELATIONSHIPS WITH STAKEHOLDERS. PARTICIPANTS WERE NOT GIVEN A MONETARY INCENTIVE FOR ATTENDANCE. AS WITH THE RESIDENT FOCUS GROUPS, THIS GROUP WAS FACILITATED BY OUTSIDE CONSULTANTS WITHOUT A DIRECT LINK TO ST. JOSEPH HEALTH. SPRING 2017 - RESIDENT COMMUNITY FORUM: RECRUITMENT FOR THE COMMUNITY RESIDENT FORUM WAS MUCH BROADER TO ENCOURAGE AS MANY PEOPLE AS POSSIBLE TO ATTEND THE SESSION. COMMUNITY BENEFIT STAFF PUBLICIZED THE EVENT THROUGH FLYERS AND EMAILS USING THEIR EXISTING OUTREACH NETWORKS, AND ALSO ASKED THEIR PARTNER ORGANIZATIONS TO INVITE AND RECRUIT PARTICIPANTS. NO FORMAL INVITATION LIST WAS USED FOR THE FORUMS AND ANYONE WHO WISHED TO ATTEND WAS WELCOMED. THE FORUM WAS CONDUCTED BY AN OUTSIDE CONSULTANT IN ENGLISH, WITH SIMULTANEOUS SPANISH LANGUAGE TRANSLATION FOR ANYONE WHO REQUESTED IT. WHILE THE FOCUS GROUPS FOLLOWED A SIMILAR PROTOCOL TO EACH OTHER IN WHICH FIVE TO SIX QUESTIONS WERE ASKED OF THE GROUP, THE FORUM FOLLOWED A DIFFERENT PROCESS. THE LEAD FACILITATOR SHARED THE HEALTH NEEDS THAT HAD EMERGED FROM THE CHNA PROCESS SO FAR AND ASKED THE PARTICIPANTS TO COMMENT ON THEM AND ADD ANY OTHER CONCERNS. ONCE THE DISCUSSION WAS COMPLETE, THE PARTICIPANTS ENGAGED IN A CUMULATIVE VOTING PROCESS USING DOTS TO INDICATE THEIR GREATEST CONCERNS. THROUGH THIS PROCESS, THE FORUM SERVED AS SOMETHING OF A ""CAPSTONE"" TO THE COMMUNITY INPUT PROCESS.

The University of Maryland Medical Center Midtown Campus (UMMC Midtown) utilized two major frameworks for completing its most recent Community Health Needs Assessment (CHNA) in fiscal year 2018. To complete this comprehensive assessment of the needs of the community, the Association for Community Health Improvement's (ACHI) 9-step Community Health Assessment Process was utilized as an organizing methodology. An additional 5-component assessment and engagement strategy was also utilized to lead the data collection methodology. The UMMC Community Health Improvement Team (CHI Team) included both the Downtown and Midtown Campuses and served as the lead team to conduct the CHNA with input from other University of Maryland Medical System Baltimore City-based hospitals, community leaders, the academic community, the public, health experts, and the Baltimore City Health Department. Data was collected from multiple sources, groups, and individuals and integrated into a comprehensive document which was utilized at a retreat on January 22, 2018 of the UMMC Downtown/Midtown Campuses' Community Health Improvement (CHI) Team. During that strategic planning retreat, priorities were identified using the collected data and an adapted version of the Catholic Health Association's (CHA) priority setting criteria. The identified priorities were also validated by a panel of UM Clinical Advisors and University of Maryland Baltimore (UMB) Campus experts. UMMC Midtown used primary and secondary sources of data as well as quantitative and qualitative data and consulted with numerous individuals and organizations during the CHNA, including other University of Maryland Medical System (UMMS) Baltimore City-based hospitals (University of Maryland Medical Center Downtown Campus, University of Maryland Rehabilitation and Orthopedic Institute, community leaders, community partners, the University of Maryland Baltimore (UMB) academic community, the general public, local health experts, and the Baltimore City Health Department. Additionally, for the first time in the city's history, nine Baltimore City hospitals joined together in fiscal year 2018 to collaborate on several key data collection strategies for a joint community health needs assessment. UMMC Midtown partnered with the University of Maryland Medical Center Downtown Campus, University of Maryland Rehabilitation & Orthopedic Institutes, Johns Hopkins Hospital, Sinai Hospital (Lifebridge), Medstar Health, St. Agnes Health System, and Mercy Medical Center. The above hospitals/health systems had been collaborating on several initiatives prior to the CHNA year and agreed that it would be beneficial to work on a more detailed level on a joint city-wide CHNA. This multi-hospital collaborative worked on the following data collection components together: - Public survey of Baltimore City residents - Key stakeholder interviews - Key population focus groups - Key community partner focus groups After the data was collected and analyzed jointly, each individual hospital used the collected data for their respective community benefit service areas to identify their unique priorities for their communities. The collaborating hospitals/health systems did agree to jointly focus on behavioral health as a key city-wide priority. The following describes the individual data collection strategies with the accompanying results. A) Community Perspective The community's perspective was obtained through one survey offered to the public using several methods throughout Baltimore City. A 6-item survey queried Baltimore City residents to identify their top health concerns and their top barriers in accessing health care. Methods 6-item survey distributed in FY2018 using the following methods: * Conducted from late September through November 2017 * Participating hospitals collected data throughout the city * Distributed in person and offered online * Offered in English, Spanish, and Russian * Collected 4,755 surveys * All Baltimore City zip codes were represented in the responses Analysis by CBSA targeted zip codes revealed the same top health concerns and top health barriers with little deviation from the overall Baltimore City data. The sample size was 4,755 for all of Baltimore City and 1,324 for residents from the identified UMMC CBSA.

Behavioral health and substance abuse were listed as high priorities. While the Medical Center will focus the majority of our efforts on the identified strategic priorities, we will review the complete set of needs identified in the CHNA for future collaboration and work. These areas, while still important to the health of the community, will be met through either existing programs (i.e. workforce development for poverty) or through collaboration with other health care organizations as needed. For example, all the Baltimore City hospitals agreed to work together on behavioral health and to potentially look at housing issues throughout the City. The additional unmet needs not addressed by UMMC will also continue to be addressed by key Baltimore City governmental agencies and existing community-based organizations. The UMMC identified core priorities target the intersection of the identified community needs and the organization's key strengths and mission."

In order to obtain input from the community, three initiatives were advanced: a Community Health Needs Assessment Steering Committee was convened, a community engagement survey was conducted, and several community conversations were held. The purpose of the CHNA Steering Committee is to support the CHNA process by engaging community members and providing feedback on the findings. All organizations involved with the CHNA Steering Committee have special knowledge of public health and underserved populations in the service area. Organizations involved in the Steering Committee are identified as having either a) conducted a previous Community Health Needs Assessment/Community Health Assessment due to IRS or accreditation requirements or b) already engaged in regional population health assessment. From January 2018 to April 2019 Steering Committee members served as key informants representing medically underserved, low- income or minority populations. The committee met bi-monthly to identify regional indicators and to inform the community engagement strategy for the creation of this document. Additionally, a survey to assess community health needs was conducted as part of the CHNA process during a six-week period between January and February 2019. One thousand one hundred (1100) individuals responded listing their top five health concerns. Seven Community Conversations occurred in March of 2019 as part of the CHNA process in which 60 individuals participated from all of the core jurisdictions. The purpose of the conversation was to elicit feedback from community members about publically available health data describing health conditions in the service areas and to review the survey results to further explore the findings. The top 10 health issues as identified from the survey results were presented to the attendees and they were asked to 1) rank the health issues according to which issues impacted them and the people close to them the most and 2) from a community perspective, rank the issues that should be addressed to improve the overall health of the region.

The Implementation Plan focuses on 4 broad areas including Access to Care for the Uninsured with Chronic Disease, Mental Health, Transportation, and Education. Goals and objectives were created for each area and were based on Healthy People 2020 objectives, Virginia's Plan for Well-Being 2016-2020 goals, and other evidence-based sources. Access to Care for the Uninsured with Chronic Disease Goal: Improve access to high quality health care services by providing support through community partners working with uninsured populations and by providing services to the uninsured through the Care-A-Van, St. Joseph's Outreach Clinic and Community Nutrition programs. *The overarching goal for Access to Care for the Uninsured with Chronic Disease is to improve access to high quality health care services. This has been achieved in part by supporting the many community partners who work with the uninsured population to include: health safety net partners, partners addressing the social determinants of health, and the two other hospital systems in the region. *Bon Secours Mercy Health provides over $1.2 million in direct health services to nearly 30,000 uninsured patients through the Care-A-Van mobile health program, the Community Nutrition Outreach program, and the Every Woman's Life Program. *Bon Secours Mercy Health also provides labs at no cost to over 12,000 patients annually who are cared for through nine safety net clinic partnerships. *Additional partnerships to achieve this objective include ten non-profit organization working to increase coordination and access to care for the most vulnerable in our communities.

Additionally, the Forensic team is focused on human trafficking advocacy providing education to over 5,000 residents. *Increasing the use of depression screenings and integrating behavioral health with primary care are two strategies that have been implemented to impact this goal. Partners in this work include Safe Harbor, Caritas, Substance Abuse and Addition Recovery Alliance (SAARA), Young Women's Christian Association (YWCA), ChildSavers, Stop Child Abuse Now (SCAN), Substance Abuse Free Environment (SAFE), and Challenge Discovery Projects. *Additionally, Henrico Area Mental Health and Development Services, Chesterfield Department of Mental Health Support Services, the City of Richmond Department of Health, and the two other health systems in the region are influential partners impacting Mental Health. Transportation Goal: Increase safe, healthy, and reliable transportation options for residents in the Richmond service area. Promote active transportation through advocacy for and provision of place making in the neighborhoods we serve. Advocate for the expansion of public transportation options to increase access for those in underserved areas and improve ridership through a community-based design. *Transportation is being addressed by increasing safe, healthy, and reliable transportation options for residents in the Richmond service area. *Bon Secours Mercy Health promotes active transportation through a direct advocacy partnership with a local non-profit, SportsBackers, that supports place making in the neighborhoods we serve. *We are an advocate for the expansion of public transportation options to increase access for those in underserved areas and improve ridership through a community-based design.

Our Community Benefit Investment in this sector is over $2 million annually. Community Health Needs Being Addressed By Other Community Partners: Access to care for Medicaid and Medicare beneficiaries, adult and childhood obesity, jobs with fair wages, families living in poverty and seniors were identified as high needs in the community. The CHNA Advisory Board also identified these needs as having high feasibility meaning there was sufficient community support to make an impact. During the Community Conversations, older adults with Medicare shared they had challenges finding community physicians who accepted Medicare patients. This need is addressed by Bon Secours Richmond Health System's Medical Group and partner health system, VCU Health. These two entities readily accept Medicaid and Medicare patients. Adult and childhood obesity are being addressed in the community by multiple organizations including Active RVA, City of Richmond's Corner Store initiative, Faces of Hope, Fit 4 Kids, the Seventh District Health and Wellness Initiative, Shalom Farms, Sports Backers/Richmond Strikers, Tricycle Gardens, Virginia Recreation and Parks and the YMCA. Jobs with Fair Wages is being addressed by the City of Richmond Community Wealth Building, Goodwill, Richmond Technical Center, Chesterfield Career and Technical Center, The Hanover Center for Trades and Technology, Henrico County Public Schools Career and Technical Education, United Way of Greater Richmond & Petersburg and the Virginia Interfaith Center. A family living in poverty is a multi-factorial issue which may be impacted through enhanced education and transportation, both areas of focus for the FY2016 CHNA. Organizations presently engaged in breaking the cycle of poverty include Area Congregations Together in Service, Better Housing Coalition, Capital Region Collaboration, City of Richmond Community Wealth Building, Commonwealth Catholic Charities, Local Initiative Support Corporation (LISC), Peter Paul Development Center, Richmond Hill, Richmond Redevelopment and Housing Authority, Salvation Army Boys and Girls Club.

THE STUDY AREA INCLUDED 19 COUNTIES ACROSS CENTRAL, NORTHEASTERN, AND SOUTH CENTRAL PENNSYLVANIA WHICH REPRESENT THE COLLECTIVE SERVICE AREAS OF THE COLLABORATING HOSPITALS. TO DISTINGUISH UNIQUE SERVICE AREAS AMONG HOSPITALS AND FOSTER COOPERATION WITH LOCAL COMMUNITY PARTNERS TO IMPACT HEALTH NEEDS, REGIONAL RESEARCH AND LOCAL REPORTING WAS DEVELOPED. THE COLLABORATING HEALTH SYSTEMS AGREED THAT BY COORDINATING EFFORTS TO IDENTIFY COMMUNITY HEALTH NEEDS ACROSS THE REGION, THE HEALTH SYSTEMS WOULD CONSERVE COMMUNITY RESOURCES WHILE DEMONSTRATING LEADERSHIP IN CONVENING LOCAL COMMUNITY PARTNERS TO ADDRESS COMMON PRIORITY NEEDS. BEST PRACTICES IN COMMUNITY HEALTH IMPROVEMENT DEMONSTRATE THAT FOSTERING ""COLLECTIVE IMPACT"" IS AMONG THE MOST SUCCESSFUL WAYS TO AFFECT THE HEALTH OF A COMMUNITY. COLLECTIVE IMPACT IS ACHIEVED BY COMMITTING A DIVERSE GROUP OF STAKEHOLDERS TOWARD A COMMON GOAL OR ACTION, PARTICULARLY TO IMPACT DEEP ROOTED SOCIAL OR HEALTH NEEDS.

WEBINARS WERE HELD IN OCTOBER AND NOVEMBER 2017 TO ANNOUNCE THE ONSET OF THE CHNA AND ENCOURAGE BROAD PARTICIPATION ACROSS THE REGION. THROUGHOUT OCTOBER AND NOVEMBER 2017, A KEY INFORMANT SURVEY WAS SENT TO APPROXIMATELY 1,000 REPRESENTATIVES OF HEALTH AND HUMAN SERVICE ORGANIZATIONS, RELIGIOUS INSTITUTIONS, CIVIC ASSOCIATIONS, BUSINESSES, ELECTED OFFICIALS AND OTHER COMMUNITY REPRESENTATIVES. PARTNER FORUMS WERE HELD THROUGHOUT THE REGION IN JANUARY 2018 TO BRING TOGETHER THESE PARTNERS TO REVIEW RESEARCH FINDINGS AND PROVIDE FEEDBACK ON THE MOST PRESSING COMMUNITY HEALTH NEEDS. IN MARCH AND APRIL 2018, FOCUS GROUPS WITH SENIORS WERE HELD TO BETTER UNDERSTAND CHALLENGES AND OPPORTUNITIES TO IMPROVING HEALTH AMONG HIGH RISK POPULATIONS. COMMUNITY FORUMS ARE PLANNED FOR FALL 2018 TO PRESENT CHNA FINDINGS AND IMPLEMENTATION PLANS TO COMMUNITY RESIDENTS AND PROVIDE A FORUM FOR DIALOGUE ABOUT ADDRESSING COMMUNITY HEALTH NEEDS. CHNA METHODOLOGY THE FY2019 CHNA WAS CONDUCTED FROM SEPTEMBER 2017 TO APRIL 2018 AND USED BOTH PRIMARY AND SECONDARY RESEARCH TO ILLUSTRATE AND COMPARE HEALTH TRENDS AND DISPARITIES ACROSS THE REGION. PRIMARY RESEARCH WAS USED TO SOLICIT INPUT FROM KEY COMMUNITY STAKEHOLDERS REPRESENTING THE BROAD INTERESTS OF THE COMMUNITY, INCLUDING EXPERTS IN PUBLIC HEALTH AND INDIVIDUALS REPRESENTING MEDICALLY UNDERSERVED, LOW-INCOME AND MINORITY POPULATIONS.

IN ASSESSING THE HEALTH NEEDS OF THE COMMUNITY, GEISINGER AND ITS CHNA PARTNERS SOLICITED AND RECEIVED INPUT FROM PERSONS WHO REPRESENT THE BROAD INTERESTS OF THE COMMUNITIES SERVED BY EACH HOSPITAL, INCLUDING THOSE WITH EXPERTISE IN PUBLIC HEALTH, REPRESENTATIVES OF MEDICALLY UNDERSERVED, LOW INCOME, AND MINORITY POPULATIONS, AND OTHER COMMUNITY STAKEHOLDERS WHO BROUGHT WIDE PERSPECTIVES ON COMMUNITY HEALTH NEEDS, EXISTING COMMUNITY RESOURCES TO MEET THOSE NEEDS, AND GAPS IN THE CURRENT SERVICE DELIVERY SYSTEM. THROUGH FACILITATED DIALOGUE AND A SERIES OF CRITERIA-BASED VOTING EXERCISES, THE FOLLOWING HEALTH ISSUES WERE PRIORITIZED AS THE MOST SIGNIFICANT HEALTH NEEDS ACROSS THE REGION ON WHICH TO FOCUS HEALTH IMPROVEMENT EFFORTS OVER THE COMING THREE-YEAR CYCLE: ACCESS TO CARE, BEHAVIORAL HEALTH, AND CHRONIC DISEASE. PROGRAMMING AND CLINICAL SERVICES WITHIN THESE PRIORITY AREAS IMPACT THE POPULATIONS OF MATERIAL/INFANT HEALTH AND SENIOR HEALTH AND ARE THEREBY SERVED THROUGH ALL APPROPRIATE HEALTH IMPROVEMENT EFFORTS. BELOW ARE SYSTEMWIDE PROGRAMS OFFERED BY GEISINGER TO FULFILL COMMUNITY NEEDS THAT WERE IDENTIFIED IN THE HOSPITAL'S MOST RECENT CHNA. SOME PROGRAMS ARE COMPLETELY OPERATED OR FUNDED BY GEISINGER AND SOME ARE OFFERED IN COOPERATION WITH LOCAL HEALTH AND HUMAN SERVICE AGENCIES. FOR MORE SPECIFIC NEEDS FOUND IN OUR LOCAL COMMUNITIES, WE OFFER PROGRAMS TO SERVE PATIENTS CLOSE TO HOME. THE TOP THREE NEEDS IDENTIFIED IN THE MOST RECENT AND/OR PAST CHNA SURVEYS FALL INTO ONE OF THREE COMMUNITY NEED CATEGORIES: 1)IMPROVING ACCESS TO HEALTHCARE: THE MOST SIGNIFICANT NEED IDENTIFIED WAS FOR BETTER, FASTER, MORE CONVENIENT AND LESS COSTLY ACCESS TO HEALTHCARE SERVICES. GEISINGER IS TAKING INNOVATIVE STEPS TO ADDRESS BARRIERS TO HEALTHCARE BY: INCREASING THE NUMBER OF RESIDENTS WHO HAVE A REGULAR PRIMARY CARE PROVIDER, INCREASING ACCESS TO PRIMARY AND SPECIALTY CARE PROVIDERS PRACTICING WITHIN MEDICALLY UNDERSERVED AREAS (MUAS) OR HEALTH PROFESSIONAL SHORTAGE AREAS (HPSAS), REDUCING BARRIERS TO RECEIVING CARE FOR RESIDENTS WITHOUT TRANSPORTATION, PROMOTING AWARENESS OF OPTIONS FOR ASSISTANCE TO PAY FOR HEALTH CARE NEEDS, FOSTERING PURSUIT OF HEALTH CAREERS AND PROVIDING ONGOING TRAINING OF HEALTH PROFESSIONALS AND PROMOTING PARTNERSHIPS WITH SOCIAL SERVICE AGENCIES TO ADDRESS SOCIO- ECONOMIC NEED OF RESIDENTS. 2)ADDRESSING BEHAVIORAL HEALTH AND SUBSTANCE ABUSE: GEISINGER IS COMMITTED TO HELPING PATIENTS FIND HEALTHCARE SERVICES WHEN THEY ARE FACING BEHAVIORAL HEALTH CHALLENGES OR STRUGGLING WITH ADDICTION. WE ADVANCE DIALOGUE AT THE LOCAL AND STATE LEVEL TO ADDRESS BEHAVIORAL HEALTH NEEDS. WE FOSTER INTEGRATION OF BEHAVIOR AND PRIMARY HEALTH CARE. WE PROVIDE EDUCATION TO INCREASE RESIDENTS' AWARENESS OF BEHAVIORAL HEALTH ISSUES AND REDUCE THE STIGMA ASSOCIATED WITH BEHAVIORAL HEALTH CONDITIONS. AND WE STRIVE TO INCREASE ACCESS TO BEHAVIORAL HEALTH SERVICES. 3)MANAGING CHRONIC CONDITIONS: GEISINGER HAS NUMEROUS PROGRAMS TO HELP PATIENTS PREVENT AND MANAGE CHRONIC CONDITIONS. EFFORTS INCLUDE ENCOURAGING COMMUNITY INITIATIVES THAT SUPPORT ACCESS TO AND AVAILABILITY OF HEALTHY LIFESTYLE CHOICES AND INITIATING EARLY-STAGE INTERVENTIONS FOR INDIVIDUALS AT HIGH RISK FOR CHRONIC DISEASE. ACCESS TO CARE: MIFFLIN AND JUNIATA COUNTIES, PRIMARILY RURAL AREAS, HAVE HISTORICALLY SUFFERED FROM A SHORTAGE OF HEALTHCARE PROFESSIONALS. THIS SHORTAGE HAS FORCED RESIDENTS TO TRAVEL GREAT DISTANCES TO FIND CARE AND, ALL TOO FREQUENTLY, PUT OFF GETTING THE CARE THEY NEED UNTIL MINOR ISSUES HAVE BECOME HEALTH CONCERNS THAT CAN NO LONGER BE IGNORED. TO ADDRESS THIS ISSUE, GEISINGER HAS SUCCESSFULLY RECRUITED SEVERAL NEW PRIMARY CARE PHYSICIANS AND SEVERAL NEW ADVANCED PRACTITIONERS IN PRIMARY CARE OVER THE PAST YEAR. WE ALSO HAVE APPROVED FUNDING FOR THE CONSTRUCTION OF A NEW BUILDING IN THE REEDSVILLE COMMUNITY TO EXPAND ACCESS TO PRIMARY CARE IN THAT LOCATION. TELEPSYCHIATRY SERVICES WILL SOON BE GOING LIVE AT THE LEWISTOWN CLINIC AND WILL SERVE MIFFLIN AND JUNIATA COUNTIES (SEE MORE IN BEHAVIORAL HEALTH SECTION). OUR NEW LIFE GEISINGER CENTER IN LEWISTOWN GIVES NURSING-HOME-ELIGIBLE SENIORS A PLACE TO SPEND THEIR DAYS SO THEY CAN MAINTAIN THEIR INDEPENDENCE AND CONTINUE TO LIVE IN THEIR OWN HOMES. HEALTHCARE, WELLNESS ACTIVITIES, SOCIAL OPPORTUNITIES AND - THANKS TO A PARTNERSHIP WITH LOCAL AGENCIES - DOOR-TO-DOOR TRANSPORTATION ARE ALL PROVIDED BY THE PROGRAM. PARTNERSHIP WITH LOCAL AGENCIES, SUCH AS THE CALL A RIDE COALITION, ALSO ALLOWS PATIENTS TO BE APPROVED FOR SAME-DAY URGENT CARE TRANSPORTATION AND RIDES HOME FROM THE HOSPITAL AFTER DISCHARGE. HOURS HAVE BEEN EXPANDED TO COVER 8 A.M. THROUGH 6 P.M. WEEKDAYS, AND SATURDAY HOURS ARE ALSO AVAILABLE. BEHAVIORAL HEALTH: SIGNIFICANT PROGRESS HAS BEEN MADE IN THE PROVISION OF BEHAVIORAL HEALTH SERVICES IN THE WESTERN HUB SURROUNDING GEISINGER LEWISTOWN HOSPITAL. AN ADULT OUTPATIENT PSYCHIATRIST SPLITS TIME BETWEEN THE SCENERY PARK AND GRAY'S WOODS CLINICS TO SERVE THE ADULT POPULATION. A PEDIATRIC PSYCHOLOGIST AND A LICENSED CLINICAL SOCIAL WORKER SERVING THE ADULT POPULATION SUPPORT THE LEWISTOWN COMMUNITY MEDICINE CLINIC. A NEUROPSYCHOLOGIST IS BASED AT SCENERY PARK. ADULT PSYCHOLOGISTS SUPPORT PRIMARY CARE AT GRAY'S WOODS AND SCENERY PARK. A PEDIATRIC PSYCHOLOGIST IS ALSO IN PLACE AT GRAY'S WOODS PEDIATRIC CLINIC. TELEPSYCHIATRY SERVICES ARE PROVIDED TO PATIENTS AT SCENERY PARK TO SUPPLEMENT THE IN-PERSON PROVIDER. APPROVALS HAVE BEEN SECURED TO PROVIDE TELEPSYCHIATRY TO THE LEWISTOWN PRIMARY CARE CLINIC FOR ADULT AND PEDIATRIC POPULATIONS. PLANNING IS UNDERWAY TO PROVIDE ADDICTION MEDICINE SERVICES VIA TELEMEDICINE AS WELL. A PEDIATRIC PSYCHIATRIST WILL BE JOINING THE GRAY'S WOODS PEDIATRIC TEAM ON JUNE 1, 2020. WHILE WE HAVE NOT YET ESTABLISHED A CHRONIC PAIN SUPPORT GROUP, WE HAVE STARTED A PILOT INTERDISCIPLINARY PAIN CLINIC AT THE GEISINGER LEWISTOWN CLINIC. EACH MONTH, WE HAVE DEDICATED NEW PATIENT SLOTS FOR PRIMARY CARE PROVIDERS TO REFER CHRONIC PAIN PATIENTS TO THE INTERDISCIPLINARY CLINIC. HERE THEY SEE A TEAM CONSISTING OF AN INTERVENTIONAL PAIN SPECIALIST, A CLINICAL PHARMACIST, A BEHAVIORAL HEALTH SPECIALIST AND A PHYSICAL THERAPIST, ALL IN ONE VISIT, FOR INDIVIDUAL EVALUATION AFTER WHICH A PROVIDER TEAM MEETS TO DEVELOP AN INTERDISCIPLINARY PLAN OF CARE. THE PILOT IS BEING LED BY PAIN MEDICINE SPECIALIST TONIA NOVOSAT, MD, AND NURSE NAVIGATOR MELISSA GUSS. OUR PLAN IS TO EXPAND THE CLINIC TO AT LEAST A WEEKLY PRESENCE. CHRONIC DISEASE MANAGEMENT AND PREVENTION: OUR NEW FRESH FOOD FARMACY LOCATION IN LEWISTOWN HELPS FOOD-INSECURE FAMILIES MANAGE AND PREVENT DIABETES AND OTHER SERIOUS HEALTH ISSUES BY PROVIDING NUTRITIOUS FOOD, FREE OF CHARGE, ALONG WITH COUNSELING AND EDUCATION. THE PROGRAM PROVIDES HEALTH MEALS DAILY FOR UP TO FOUR FAMILY MEMBERS AND IS DESIGNED FOR ANYONE 18 YEARS OF AGE OR OLDER WHO HAS BEEN DIAGNOSED WITH TYPE 2 DIABETES, HAS AN HBA1C HIGHER THAN 8.0% AND FINDS PAYING FOR FOOD TO BE A SIGNIFICANT CHALLENGE. GEISINGER LEWISTOWN HOSPITAL HAS PARTICIPATED IN AND HOSTED NUMEROUS FREE COMMUNITY HEALTH FAIRS TARGETING DIVERSE POPULATIONS, INCLUDING THE MIFFLIN/JUNIATA GERIATRIC INTEREST GROUP (GIN) HEALTH FAIR, THE DOWNTOWN LEWISTOWN KID CONNECTION, THE MIFFLIN COUNTY SCIENCE AND TECHNOLOGY FAIR, THE MIFFLINTOWN FESTIVAL IN THE PARK AND THE MIFFLIN/JUNIATA AREA AGENCY ON AGING INC.

This intervention was selected based on observed mental health disparities in Central Brooklyn and multiple key stakeholders at community events requesting mental health interventions directly in the community, with one faith-based representative requesting the intervention by name. * The Screening, Assessment and Treatment Services recommended intervention for local action has been selected by IMC as the evidence-based intervention to address Promote Mental Health & Prevent Substance Abuse Priority Focus Area 2: Prevent Substance Abuse and Other Mental Emotional Behavioral Disorders. This intervention will promote the coordination of mental health practitioners with other care providers through the hospitals DSRIP-related programs and activities overseen by its Performing Provider System (PPS) that institutionalize the use of screenings such as the PHQ-9, DAST, and AUDIT through the Patient-Centered Medical Home (PCMH+) Initiative. This intervention was selected based on IMCs developing population health work with its Maimonides-led PPS: Community Care of Brooklyn. * The Nutrition Standards recommended intervention for local action has been selected by IMC as the evidence-based intervention to address Prevent Chronic Diseases Priority Focus Area 1: Reduce Obesity in Children and Adults. This intervention will increase the number of institutions with nutrition standards for healthy food and beverage procurement and was selected based on obesity, diabetes, and other nutrition-related illness surveillance data and community feedback (both in workgroups and listening sessions) on access to healthy foods. While several health issues, unhealthy behaviors, and social determinants of health that merit prioritization and action were identified through the CHNA, the hospital will not address the following issues specifically through its 2016-2018 CSP: * Angry Behavioral/Violence: the hospital is unable to single-handedly confront violence directly like law enforcement, but through mental health and substance abuse programs the hospital will address these issues. * Child Abuse: it is not the hospitals specialty to address child abuse directly like the Administration for Childrens Services, but through mandated reporter requirements for healthcare professionals the hospital will address this issue. * Domestic Violence: because of limited hospital resources IMC utilizes NYC and NYS public health resources like Partner Services to assess, aid, and address people in need of services."

THE 2016 CHNA FOCUSED MORE SPECIFICALLY ON TWO HEALTH NEEDS: 1) CHRONIC DISEASE (OBESITY AND DIABETES) AND 2) MENTAL HEALTH (SUICIDE AND MENTAL/EMOTIONAL/BEHAVIORAL (MEB) INFRASTRUCTURE). THE 2016 CHNA, HOWEVER, CONTINUED TO IDENTIFY ALL FIFTEEN HEALTH NEEDS FROM 2013 AS REMAINING IN NEED OF ATTENTION. DURING 2014 THROUGH 2018 ELLIS HOSPITAL, SCHENECTADY COUNTY PUBLIC HEALTH SERVICES, AND THEIR COMMUNITY PARTNERS TOOK ACTIONS TO ADDRESS SUCH NEEDS, COMMENSURATE WITH THE PRIORITY OF EACH NEED AND THE AVAILABILITY OF RESOURCES. ACTIONS INCLUDED THE FOLLOWING:CHRONIC DISEASE - OBESITY AND DIABETES:-ELLIS EMBARKED ON A TWO-PRONGED APPROACH TO ISSUES OF DIABETES AND OBESITY: 1) SPECIFIC DIABETES EDUCATION PROGRAMS WERE DEVELOPED AND DELIVERED IN THE COMMUNITY AND 2) WEIGHT LOSS AND PHYSICAL EXERCISE PROGRAMS WERE IMPLEMENTED FOR VARYING TARGET GROUPS.-ELLIS AND PARTNERS PILOTED THE ""LEARN TO LIVE WELL"" DIABETES PROGRAM FOR PARISHIONERS AND COMMUNITY MEMBERS AT THE ZION LUTHERAN CHURCH; THE FOUR-SESSION CURRICULUM INCLUDED A PRESENTATION BY ELLIS CERTIFIED DIABETES EDUCATORS.-ELLIS STAFF MET WITH REPRESENTATIVES FROM THE CITY MISSION AND THE LOCAL HINDU TEMPLE TO EXPLORE DIABETES PROGRAMMING THROUGH THEIR ORGANIZATIONS.-IN 2014, SCHENECTADY COUNTY PUBLIC HEALTH SERVICES RECEIVED A ""PARTNERSHIPS TO IMPROVE COMMUNITY HEALTH"" (PICH) GRANT WHICH SUPPORTED INCREASED SCREENING FOR DIABETES IN HIGH RISK POPULATIONS. ELLIS WAS A SUBCONTRACTOR UNDER THE GRANT.-THE PICH GRANT ALSO SUPPORTED TRAINING OF ELLIS DIABETES CARE STAFF AS LIFESTYLE COACHES FOR THE NATIONAL DIABETES PREVENTION PROGRAM (DPP), WHICH IS OFFERED AT ELLIS MEDICINE LOCATIONS STARTING IN OCTOBER 2016. IN LATE 2018, THE ELLIS DDP PROGRAM RECEIVED RECOGNITION FROM THE CENTERS FOR DISEASE CONTROL (CDC).-AN EMBEDDED DIABETES CARE MANAGER WAS PLACED AT ELLIS FAMILY HEALTH CENTER AS PART OF THE PICH GRANT TO WORK ON POLICIES AND SYSTEMS RELATED TO DIABETES MANAGEMENT IN A PRIMARY CARE SETTING, INCLUDING REFERRALS TO THE DIABETES SELF-MANAGEMENT EDUCATION PROGRAM. -WITH ASSISTANCE FROM ELLIS MEDICINE IT STAFF, A REGISTRY OF PATIENTS WITH DIABETES WAS DEVELOPED FOR ELLIS FAMILY HEALTH CENTER TO FACILITATE IMPROVED CARE.-ELLIS STAFF AND LOCAL COLLEGE STUDENTS MET WITH NEIGHBORHOOD ASSOCIATIONS TO CONDUCT A COMMUNITY ASSET MAPPING; THIS INVENTORY IS TO BE USED TO ASSESS THE VIABILITY OF A CITY-WIDE PHYSICAL ACTIVITY PROGRAM.-ELLIS HELD A PHYSICAL ACTIVITY FIELD DAY FOR LOCAL YOUTH IN PARTNERSHIP WITH UNION COLLEGE.-ELLIS ENGAGED ITS OWN EMPLOYEES IN COMPETITIVE WALKING EVENTS AND OTHER WEIGHT-LOSS ACTIVITY; PARTICIPATION COUNTS TOWARD REDUCTIONS IN HEALTH INSURANCE PREMIUMS.-THE HEALTHY FOOD ACCESS WORKGROUP, RENAMED THE DIABETES/OBESITY WORKGROUP, MET THREE TIMES DURING 2017. AVERAGE ATTENDANCE FOR THE MEETINGS WAS 13 PEOPLE. THIS GROUP'S MAIN FOCUS DURING THE YEAR WAS TO STEER THE FOOD ACCESS FOCUSED WORK OF THE ""PARTNERSHIPS TO IMPROVE COMMUNITY HEALTH"" (PICH) GRANT WHICH HAD BEEN AWARDED TO SCHENECTADY COUNTY PUBLIC HEALTH SERVICES. THIS GROUP WORKED WITH SIX FOOD PANTRIES IN SCHENECTADY COUNTY TO INCREASE THE AVAILABILITY OF HEALTHY OPTIONS DISTRIBUTED TO CLIENTS. THIS INCLUDES INCREASING OPTIONS FOR FRUITS AND VEGETABLES AS WELL AS WHOLE GRAINS AND LOW-FAT DAIRY. IMPLEMENTATION EFFORTS AT FOOD PANTRIES INCLUDE ""POLICY, SYSTEMS AND ENVIRONMENTAL"" (PSE) IMPROVEMENTS. EXAMPLES OF THESE PSE STRATEGIES INCLUDE SIGNAGE TO PROMOTE THE FOOD GROUPS WITH A NUTRITION MESSAGE, MOVING ITEMS ON SHELVES TO HIGHLIGHT FRUITS AND VEGETABLES AT EYE LEVEL, AND IMPROVING THE DISPLAYS FOR FRESH PRODUCE TO MAKE THE FOOD PANTRIES LOOK MORE LIKE A MARKET. RECIPES AND COOKING DEMONSTRATIONS WERE ALSO DONE AT FOOD PANTRIES TO INCREASE THE LIKELIHOOD OF CLIENTS CHOOSING THE HEALTHIER OPTIONS. EACH PANTRY THAT IS ENGAGED IN THIS WORK IN SCHENECTADY COUNTY IS DOING A DIFFERENT COMBINATION OF INTERVENTIONS TO INCREASE THE AVAILABILITY OF HEALTHY OPTIONS BECAUSE EACH PANTRY USES A SLIGHTLY DIFFERENT MODEL TO DELIVER FOODS TO CLIENTS. SOME PANTRIES ARE A CHOICE MODEL, WHERE CLIENTS GET TO CHOOSE ALL THE FOODS THEY TAKE WITH THEM WHILE SOME PROVIDE PRE-PACKED FOOD BOXES AND SOME ARE A MIX OF BOTH MODELS. THE DIFFERENT PANTRY MODELS LEND THEMSELVES TO DIFFERENT INTERVENTIONS WORKING BETTER THAN OTHERS. THE DIABETES/OBESITY WORKGROUP ASSISTED PANTRIES IN DECIDING WHAT INTERVENTIONS WOULD WORK BEST FOR THEIR MODEL. GIVEN THE COMPLETION OF THE GRANT PERIOD, AND THE ABILITY OF MEMBER ORGANIZATIONS TO PURSUE EVIDENCE-BASED FOOD POLICIES, THE WORKGROUP DISCONTINUED MEETING AFTER 2017.-DURING 2018, SIX FOOD PANTRIES CONTINUED TO SUSTAIN POLICY, SYSTEMS AND ENVIRONMENTAL CHANGES TO OFFER HEALTHIER FOOD OPTIONS TO FOOD PANTRY CLIENTS. THESE INTERVENTIONS INCLUDE SIGNAGE TO INDICATE HEALTHY OPTIONS WITH A NUTRITION MESSAGE, MOVING HEALTHY ITEMS TO EYE LEVEL ON SHELVING, AND IMPROVING DISPLAYS OF FRESH PRODUCE TO MAKE THEM LOOK MORE APPEALING. RECIPES AND FOOD DEMONSTRATIONS ARE ALSO DONE AT FOOD PANTRIES INCREASING THE LIKELIHOOD OF CLIENTS CHOOSING HEALTHIER OPTIONS THEY MAY NOT BE AS FAMILIAR WITH. EACH PANTRY THAT IS ENGAGED IN THIS WORK IN SCHENECTADY COUNTY CONTINUES TO HAVE A DIFFERENT COMBINATION OF INTERVENTIONS TO INCREASE THE AVAILABILITY OF HEALTHY OPTIONS BECAUSE EACH PANTRY USES A SLIGHTLY DIFFERENT MODEL TO DELIVER FOODS TO CLIENTS. IN 2018, NEW WORK BEGAN WITH FOUR (THREE OVERLAPPING WITH PREVIOUS WORK) FOOD PANTRIES IN SCHENECTADY COUNTY TO OFFER CHRONIC DISEASE-SPECIFIC FOOD PACKAGES. FOOD PACKAGES FOR DIABETES AND HYPERTENSION ARE GIVEN OUT TO CLIENTS INDICATING THEY HAVE SOMEONE IN THEIR FAMILY WITH EITHER CONDITION OR SOMEONE AT RISK FOR THE CONDITIONS. THE FOOD PACKAGES INCLUDE HEALTHIER OPTIONS TO ASSIST IN THE MANAGEMENT OR PREVENTION OF DIABETES AND HYPERTENSION THROUGH NUTRITION. EXAMPLES OF FOODS IN THE DIABETES/HYPERTENSION PACKAGES INCLUDE WHOLE WHEAT PASTA, BROWN RICE, NO SUGAR ADDED CANNED FRUIT AND NO SALT ADDED CANNED VEGETABLES. INFORMATION ABOUT THE CONDITIONS AND MANAGEMENT OF THEM IS ALSO INCLUDED IN THE FOOD PACKAGES. CLIENTS CAN GET THE FOOD PACKAGES EACH TIME THEY COME TO THE FOOD PANTRY BY INDICATING THEIR INTEREST IN THE PROGRAM WHEN ASKED. IN ADDITION THE FOOD, A REGISTERED DIETICIAN FROM CORNELL COOPERATIVE EXTENSION, SCHENECTADY COUNTY PROVIDED TECHNICAL ASSISTANCE TO THE FOOD PANTRIES TO MODIFY THE FOOD PACKAGES AND PROVIDES NUTRITION EDUCATION AT EACH OF THE FOOD PANTRIES ONE TIME A MONTH. INDIVIDUALS WHO ARE EXPERIENCING FOOD INSECURITY ARE BEING IDENTIFIED THROUGH THIS WORK BY SCREENING INDIVIDUALS AT COMMUNITY BASED ORGANIZATIONS AND HEALTH INSURERS AND REFERRING THEM TO FOOD PANTRIES THAT ARE OFFERING HEALTHY OPTIONS AND CHRONIC DISEASE SPECIFIC FOOD PACKAGES IF THEY HAVE THAT NEED.-IN OCTOBER 2016, ELLIS DIABETES CARE STARTED THE FIRST DIABETES PREVENTION PROGRAM (DPP) IN THE COMMUNITY IN A NUMBER OF YEARS. THE DPP IS A LIFESTYLE CHANGE PROGRAM TO PREVENT DIABETES. IT RUNS 16 CONSECUTIVE WEEKS AND THEN MONTHLY MAINTENANCE SESSIONS FOR THE REMAINDER OF A YEAR. IN 2018, THERE WERE 2 CLASSES STARTED.

The CHNA report identified eleven health needs as significant in the community, as listed below in alphabetical order. - Aging Population - Access to Mental Health Care and Poor Mental Health Status - Access to Primary Health Care Services by Individuals with Limited Resources - Chronic Diseases and Contributing Lifestyle Factors - Environmental Determinants of Health - Homelessness - Navigating a Changing Health Care Provider Environment - Poverty, Financial Hardship, and Basic Needs Insecurity - Safe and Affordable Housing - Socio-Economic, Racial, Cultural, Ethnic, and Linguistic Barriers to Care - Substance Abuse The hospital selected the following significant needs to focus its efforts during the 2018-2020 time period: - Access to Mental Health Care and Poor Mental Health Status, - Access to Primary Health Care Services by Individuals with Limited Resources, - Chronic Diseases and Contributing Lifestyle Factors, - Socio-Economic, Racial, Cultural, Ethnic, and Linguistic Barriers to Care, and - Substance Abuse. A. Access to Mental Health Care and Poor Mental Health Status The 2017 MSBI CHNA found that the mental health status is poor for many residents because of day-to-day pressures, substance abuse, and psychiatric disorders. The supply of mental health providers is insufficient to meet the demand for mental health services. Planned activities to increase access to mental health care and improve the mental health status of community residents are described below. These activities are in addition to the MSBI activities that impact multiple needs. Health professions education The health professions education activities of MSBI respond to both the current and future community health needs for mental health services. MSBI actively participates in over two dozen residency and fellowship programs. Current residency and fellowship programs that are especially related to mental health care services are as follows: - Clinical Psychology Internship Program - Geriatric Psychiatry Fellowship - Psychiatry Residency Mental Health Services Mental health care services are available at the hospital campuses, outpatient facilities, and physician practices throughout the community. As part of the Mount Sinai Health System, integrated resources such as electronic health records facilitate the referral of patients to needed services provided by other Mount Sinai Health System hospitals and health professionals. Specific mental health services available include the following: Mount Sinai's Department of Psychiatry and Behavioral Sciences. The Department of Psychiatry and Behavioral Sciences at Mount Sinai Beth Israel provides comprehensive inpatient, emergency, and outpatient services.

It includes a broad spectrum of clinical services including comprehensive psychiatric evaluations, medication management, individual and family psychotherapy, and group psychotherapy. It also runs one of the state-approved ACT teams, providing intensive community-based treatment for people with the most severe mental illnesses. AIMS-BI represents the clinical, educational, and research services and programs to treat people with substance use disorders, develop new treatments and gain better understanding of the mechanisms of disease, and to train the next generation of clinicians to care for people with substance use disorders. The clinical services encompass inpatient to outpatient levels of care, including the Opioid Treatment Programs. In addition, behavioral health services are provided within primary care, as well as primary care and specialty care services within behavioral health services. The focus is on assessing and managing all conditions, whether the conditions are behavioral health related or physical health related, and developing strong collaborations and partnerships with physical health and community based providers. Inpatient and Emergency behavioral health services MSBI provides inpatient psychiatric services for people with acute psychiatric illness, focusing on the resolution of acute symptoms and developing a safe plan for return to the home and community upon crisis stabilization. Treatment consists of a wide range of somatic and psychosocial therapies, with a strong multidisciplinary approach. MSBI also provides emergency evaluation services in the CPEP for adults and adolescents. The Mobile Crisis Team is a community-based team of licensed professionals who respond to referrals for urgent crises in the community. The team provides crisis assessment as well as short-term transitional services to ensure that there is connectivity to outpatient and/or community based services. As part of AIMS-BI, inpatient detoxification and rehabilitation services are also provided. The inpatient unit serves as an acute and intensive initial step to safely manage withdrawal symptoms, then subsequent intensive counseling and therapy to begin the road to recovery from substance use. B. Access to Primary Health Care Services by Individuals with Limited Resources The 2017 MSBI CHNA found that New York City has a robust health provider network. However, access to this network can be limited to individuals with limited financial resources, including lack of health insurance and relatively high deductibles/co-pays. Planned activities to increase access to primary health care for individuals with limited resources are described below. These activities are in addition to the MSBI activities that impact multiple needs. Health professions education The health professions education activities of MSBI respond to both the current and future community health needs for primary health care services. MSBI actively participates in over two dozen residency and fellowship programs. Residency and fellowship programs that are especially related to primary health care services are as follows: - Emergency Medicine Residency - Internal Medicine Residency Primary Care Services MSBI provides significant specialty care services for both inpatient and outpatient services, including but not limited to breast health, cardiology, diabetes services, gastroenterology, general surgery, and orthopedics.

ACTION AREAS FOR IMPLEMENTATION TO IMPROVE COMMUNITY HEALTH ARE INFLUENCED BY THE FULL SPECTRUM OF THE PUBLIC HEALTH SYSTEM, IN WHICH WELLSTAR COBB, WELLSTAR DOUGLAS, WELLSTAR KENNESTONE, WELLSTAR PAULDING, AND WELLSTAR WINDY HILL HOSPITALS PLAY A VITAL ROLE. WELLSTAR COBB, WELLSTAR DOUGLAS, WELLSTAR KENNESTONE, WELLSTAR PAULDING, AND WELLSTAR WINDY HILL HOSPITALS ARE DEDICATED TO IMPROVING THE HEALTH OF THE COMMUNITY WE SERVE. WITH THE UNIQUE NEEDS IDENTIFIED BY OUR COMMUNITY PARTNERS, WELLSTAR CREATED THE CENTER FOR HEALTH EQUITY IN 2019. THE WELLSTAR CENTER FOR HEALTH EQUITY: THE PURPOSE OF THE WELLSTAR CENTER FOR HEALTH EQUITY IS TO ACCELERATE OUR STRATEGIC EFFORTS TO ADDRESS THE PRIORITY HEALTH NEEDS OF THE COMMUNITIES WE SERVE. WE WILL IMPLEMENT OUR STRATEGY THROUGH COMMUNITY ENGAGEMENT, PARTNERSHIP, INTERNAL TRANSFORMATION, CAPACITY BUILDING, HEALTH POLICY AND SYSTEM ADVOCACY. THERE ARE SIX STRATEGIC DOMAINS FOR THE CENTER FOR HEALTH EQUITY: 1. ACCESS TO CARE 2. WOMENS HEALTH 3. SUBSTANCE ABUSE 4. SUICIDE 5. FOOD INSECURITY 6. CANCER WELLSTAR CENTER FOR HEALTH EQUITY COMMITTEE: WELLSTAR CENTER FOR HEALTH EQUITY COMMITTEE (WCHEC) IS A CROSS-FUNCTIONAL COMMITTEE THAT REPRESENTS MULTIPLE FACETS OF WELLSTAR HEALTH SYSTEM. - IN RESPONSE TO CHNA FINDINGS AND THE DIVERSITY OF WELLSTAR COMMUNITIES, WCHEC WAS EXPANDED TO INCREASE WELLSTARS CAPACITY TO SUPPORT THE CENTER FOR HEALTH EQUITYS STRATEGIES. - BY ENGAGING A MORE DIVERSE SELECTION OF WELLSTAR LEADERSHIP AND SUBJECT MATTER EXPERTS, THE CENTERS PRIORITIES AND INITIATIVES CAN BEST REFLECT THE CAPACITY OF THE ORGANIZATION TO IMPACT AND MEET THE COMMUNITYS NEEDS. - THIS EXPANSION ALSO HELPS THE CENTER INCREASE COORDINATION OF EFFORTS, LEVERAGE PARTNERSHIPS AND MAXIMIZE EFFICIENCY AND STRATEGIC ALIGNMENT, WITHIN AND ACROSS WELLSTAR HEALTH SYSTEM. - THIS IS DONE BY WCHEC MEMBERS GUIDING AND INFORMING THE STRATEGIC PLANNING AND IMPLEMENTATION PROCESS FOR GREATER INSTITUTIONAL ALIGNMENT AND IMPACT. THE CENTER FOR HEALTH EQUITYS IMPLEMENTATION STRATEGY FOCUSES ON SIX STRATEGIC DOMAINS: 1. FOOD INSECURITY - CONTEXT: FOOD INSECURITY IS AN IMPORTANT BUT OFTEN OVERLOOKED FACTOR AFFECTING THE HEALTH OF A SIGNIFICANT SEGMENT OF GEORGIA RESIDENTS. 16.2% OF THE PEOPLE LIVING IN GEORGIA ARE FOOD INSECURE AND 23.2% OF GEORGIA CHILDREN LIVE IN FOOD INSECURE HOUSEHOLDS. THIS IS ONE IN EVERY FOUR GEORGIA CHILDREN. - EXAMPLE WELLSTAR INTERVENTIONS: - WELLSTAR DAY OF SERVICE: CREATES VOLUNTEER OPPORTUNITIES FOR WELLSTAR EMPLOYEES TO SUPPORT GEORGIAS FOOD SUPPORT SYSTEM FOR VULNERABLE AND UNDERSERVED POPULATIONS. - FOOD AS MEDICINE PROGRAM: INTEGRATES HEALTH AND NUTRITION EDUCATION INTO THE COMMUNITY SETTING, WHILE ALSO PROVIDING ACCESS TO HEALTHY FOODS AND MEDICALLY TAILORED COOKING CLASSES. - FOOD INSECURITY SCREENING: IMPLEMENTING THE PROCESS TO SCREEN PATIENTS FOR FOOD INSECURITY AND CONNECTING PATIENTS TO AVAILABLE RESOURCES AND INTERVENTIONS. 2. OPIOIDS - CONTEXT: DEVASTATING CONSEQUENCES OF THE OPIOID EPIDEMIC INCLUDE INCREASES IN OPIOID MISUSE AND RELATED OVERDOSES, AS WELL AS THE RISING INCIDENCE OF NEWBORNS EXPERIENCING WITHDRAWAL SYNDROME DUE TO OPIOID USE AND MISUSE DURING PREGNANCY. - EXAMPLE WELLSTAR INTERVENTIONS: - GEORGIA SUPREME COURT PARTNERSHIP: PROVIDES ACCESS TO SUBSTANCE USE TREATMENT, PEER SUPPORT, MEDICAL TREATMENT AND OTHER SERVICES THROUGH COLLABORATIVE COMMUNITY PARTNERSHIPS FOR FAMILIES TO ASSURE HEALTHY PREGNANCIES AND HEALTHY DEVELOPMENT FOR YOUNG CHILDREN WITH SUBSTANCE USE EXPOSURE. THESE PARTNERS INCLUDE WELLSTAR WOMENS HEALTH SERVICE NETWORK, GEORGIA DEPARTMENT OF PUBLIC HEALTH, GEORGIA DEPARTMENT OF HUMAN SERVICES AND SUPREME COURT OF GEORGIA. - OPIOID TASKFORCE: THREE PHYSICIAN-LED WORK GROUPS COMMITTED TO PREVENTION, TREATMENT AND RECOVERY, TARGET VARIOUS POPULATIONS INTERNALLY (TEAM-BASED) AND EXTERNALLY (COMMUNITY-BASED): (1) PROVIDER AND PATIENT EDUCATION, (2) CLINICAL INITIATIVES AND (3) COMMUNITY AWARENESS AND ENGAGEMENT. 3. WOMENS HEALTH - CONTEXT: THE PREGNANCY-RELATED MATERNAL MORTALITY RATIO IN GEORGIA WAS 40.8 PER 100,000 LIVE BIRTHS. THE MATERNAL DEATH RATE FOR BLACK WOMEN IN GEORGIA IS TWICE THAT FOR WHITE WOMEN IN GEORGIA AND 6 TIMES THE RATE FOR WHITE WOMEN, NATIONALLY. - EXAMPLE WELLSTAR INTERVENTIONS: - CLINICAL PRACTICE STANDARDS: SYSTEM-LEVEL COUNCILS MONITOR CLINICAL PRACTICES THROUGHOUT WELLSTAR HEALTH SYSTEM AND IMPLEMENT CARE MODELS WITH EVIDENCE-BASED POLICIES, PROCEDURES, PROTOCOLS AND PATHWAYS, WHILE LOCAL INTERDISCIPLINARY COUNCILS MONITOR WOMENS HEALTH PRACTICES ON-SITE IN INDIVIDUAL WELLSTAR HOSPITALS. - WOMEN AND CHILDREN RESOURCE CENTER: OFFERS PERINATAL EDUCATION AND SUPPORT SERVICES THROUGH THE WOMEN AND CHILDREN RESOURCE CENTER TO REACH MORE THAN 15,000 FAMILIES ANNUALLY - GME COMMUNITY CLINIC & BABIES BORN HEALTHY (BBH): PROVIDES PRENATAL SERVICES AT A REDUCED RATE FOR VULNERABLE AND UNDERSERVED WOMEN.

201923169349300502,550526150,"Facility Reporting Group - A Part V, Section B, line 5:","Household Telephone Survey: The household surveys were conducted using appropriate quality controls which included involving research experts in the design of the survey instrument, thorough and consistent training of interviewers, and the use of reputable survey-analysis software. The principal investigator provided oversight to the surveying process including data collection and entry. Data was collected and entered using a web-based survey. This report was compiled and verified for accuracy by members of the Kanawha Coalition for Community Health Improvement. This survey sample size results in a statistically significant 95% confidence interval with an error margin of plus or minus 5.73%. Not all respondents answered every question; therefore the margin of error was adjusted and reported for each question, based on the number of respondents. Numbers too small to be statistically significant were noted as such. An independent sampling firm randomly selected landline telephone numbers for Kanawha County households. The random landline sample consisted of 8,600 numbers which was screened for disconnects and businesses, resulting in a list of 4,568 numbers. A total of 26 nursing students received training and administered the phone survey. After learning that the number of American homes with only wireless telephones continues to grow and 47.4% of American homes had only wireless telephones (January - June 2015 National Center for Health Statistics Survey), the Kanawha Coalition attempted to increase the number of responses among younger residents and lower income residents, by doubling the acquired address based sample of households with only wireless phones. The wireless sample of 5,600 households received postcards in the mail directing them to the online survey or to call the Kanawha Coalition to arrange a convenient time to take the survey by telephone. The Kanawha Coalition process works to ensure that the survey sample size is valid, and that the sample is randomly selected. It also ensured that the fourth-year nursing students with the University of Charleston's School of Nursing were adequately trained in how to administer the phone survey. As with any telephone survey, there are certain limitations. The result of the survey depends on the accuracy of the responses given by the persons interviewed. Self-reported behavior must be interpreted with caution. To assure proper sampling distribution, the demographics of the survey respondents were compared to county demographics based on 2010-2015 U.S. Census Quickfacts data. This comparison reveals an over-representation of respondents who were female, over 55 years of age, widowed, had no children in the home and were Caucasian. There was an under-representation of African Americans, people with lower-educational attainment (high school or less), those with children in the home, and those who had never been married. Focus Groups:To understand community needs, focus groups were held throughout Kanawha County in November 2016. As one component of the Coalition's five-part assessment, focus groups offer insight into the needs, concerns and experiences of people whose voice is not often heard. Typically, focus groups are comprised of a small group of individuals, usually a vulnerable or target population. In this case focus groups were organized in communities located in different geographical locations in the county. It is important to note that the results reflect the perceptions of some community members, but may not necessarily represent all community members in Kanawha County. A series of six focus groups were convened. Participants received gift cards for their completion of the focus group. The purpose of the discussion was to obtain input on issues that could impact the health of the residents of their communities. A total of 51 community members participated in focus groups in the following communities: Cross Lanes, Elkview, Kanawha City, Marmet, Miami and London. The Kanawha Coalition provided training to fourth year University of Charleston-School of Health Science's nursing students with the University of Charleston-School of Health Sciences to enable them to facilitate the groups. The students also compiled the results and prepared reports of the findings for the Kanawha Coalition.Steering Committee: Steering Committee Members are from the CAMC, Thomas Health System,Highland Hospital, Charleston Area Alliance, Kanawha County Schools, WV Bureau for Public Health, Partnership of African American Churches and the Kanawha Coalition for Community Health Improvement and they serve in an advisory capacity for the Coalition. The Steering Committee follows a set of Guiding Principles as it promotes and safeguards the integrity of the collaborative process as each assumes the role of an equal partner in the process. They make tangible commitments of resources to the Coalition and believe that the process is the product and serves as the vehicle to putpeople together to explore and address challenges and opportunities toimprove the health of the people of Kanawha County. The SteeringCommittee is committed to including all members of the community in thecommunity health needs assessment process as it cultivates acommunity-wide sense of ownership, not organizational ownership. Itprovides encouragement and support to keep Coalition volunteers engagedand motivated while remaining flexible in its approach to meetingcommunity needs. It believes in continuous quality improvement andsupports an ongoing process to evaluate and improve outcomes and itcelebrates successes along the way.Members of the Kanawha Coalition Steering Committee actively participatein the survey planning process to provide public health insight and ensuredata integrity. Additionally, epidemiologists from the West VirginiaDepartment of Health and Human Services work with the Coalition for question design for consistency with other surveys to allow benchmarks andcomparisons. In addition, Key Informant Interviews provide in-depthinformation on the community. The Steering Committee also providescontact information for key informants in the community.Key Informant Interviews:The 87 key informants representing 20 different sectors or areas ofexpertise in the community were given both standardized questions and openended questions designed to elicit a full range of responses. They wereasked to identify the top three populations in Kanawha County with unmetneeds and to share their biggest concerns in terms of health riskbehaviors, clinical care, social and economic factors and the physicalenvironment. They were also asked to share the challenges and barriersthey believed exist and how best to overcome them. Finally, they wereasked to identify the top three overall issues in Kanawha County and whatthey believed to be the top three health related strengths and assets forthe community."

One of the community need issues identified is Drugs (all typesillicit and prescription, does not include alcohol). We addressed thiscommunity need issue through the CAMC Ryan White Program. In 2018, therewere 366 participants and we provided $71,795 in unreimbursed care. Wealso addressed this issue with the Drug Addicted Mother Baby Program. In2018, 627 mothers were identified and participated in the program at CAMCWomen and Children's Hospital.2.) Another community need issue identified is Diabetes. We addressed thiscommunity need issue with our Outpatient Diabetes Education Program andInformation available through our Health Information Center. We alsoprovided community screenings via our annual Healthfest and Teddy Bear health fairs.3.) Obesity was addressed via our continued provision of Play Patch, a 940square feet children's play area that includes fruit and vegetable themedplay equipment along with a family restroom at the local shopping mall.4.) Heart Disease/Hypertension/Heart Attack/Stroke was addressed viacommunity education provided via the CAMC Mall Walkers, BLS Training forthe Community, CAMC Healthfest, and Physician Guest Lecture Programs.Health Screenings for heart disease were also provided at the CAMCHealthfest. In all, over 2,000 residents of the community were impactedby CAMC's outreach efforts.5.) Limited Access to Healthy Foods is addressed through our Local WealthCreation ""Value Chain program and our continued efforts to work with TheGreater Kanawha Foundation to create and sustain a wealth creation valuechain. This approach bridges conventional approaches to community andeconomic development by using a systems framework, working with wealthcreation value chains. CAMC's 5 county primary service area is comprisedof 356,000 people with a small increases in the size of the workingpopulation since 1990. 18% of people and 25% of children live in povertywith little improvement over the past 10 years. The health connection isthat improvements in health care are associated with higher productivityin the workforce and for the economy overall. The value chain premisesare that we need to be intentionally inclusive of local people and placesas economic contributors to have a positive impact on wealth in ourcommunities. This program's focus is on working with local growers to develop their capability to sell their produce to CAMC at a guaranteedquantity and price and once the process is established to roll it out toother ""buyers"" . In 2018, we worked with over 140 individuals tocoordinate the number of growers providing fresh produce purchased by CAMCand to maintain and expand GAP certification.6.) Tobacco Use was addressed through ""Tobacco Free for Baby and Me"",the Tobacco Free Day at the West Virginia Legislature, the ALA Bike Trekand Great Smoke Out. The Tobacco Free for Baby and Me program identifiedover 200 women who were tobacco users through the CAMC Women's MedicineCenter in 2018.7.) Lack of Access to Mental Health and Addiction Services was addressed through the Outpatient Mental Health Program offered through the CAMC Family Resource Center. The program is for low income residents and served 122 individuals in 2018.8.)

LOUIS & FRANKLIN COUNTY HOSPITAL'S COMMUNITY HEALTH IMPROVEMENT PLAN (CHIP), WHICH CAN BE ACCESSED HERE: HTTPS://WWW.MERCY.NET/forms/community-benefits/. Some notable achievements during the 2018 year include:- 2018 - Patients seen in the Mercy Hospital St. Louis Emergency Department who had not seen a primary care provider in recent years or were uninsured were referred to the Community Health Worker (CHW) program which began in 2018. The CHW helps the patient establish a ""medical home and/or address social determinants of health issues and are screened and assisted with applying for Medicaid, market place insurance, disability or hospital charity care.- 2018 - The Community Referral Coordinator (CRC) program at Mercy Hospital St. Louis has evolved to a 65% appointment kept rate when encountered by a CRC which works in the department (ED) in order to provide patients without a medical home assistance in finding a primary care or specialty care provider, along with social service support, as appropriate. - 2018 - Mercy Hospital St. Louis implemented several behavioral health programming; Hospital Community Linkages (HCL) Project, the Youth Emergency Room Enhancement Project which mirrors the Emergency Room Enhancement Project for adults. These programs focus on enhancing support for adult and youth high utilizers of ER with the primary goal of reducing preventable hospital contacts across the region by fostering engagement through support, intensive outreach and improving outcomes through connection to community. Mercy Hospital St. Louis also implemented the Engaging Patients in the Care Coordination Program also known as EPICC, this program provides intensive referral and linkage services by Recovery Coaches, peers with lived experience, to impact those who have overdosed on opioids to establish immediate linkages to substance use and medication assisted treatment services. - 2018 - Mercy Hospital St. Louis in partnership with Generate Health, Barnes Jewish Hospital and SSM Health System continued their collaborative work on the BUILD Health Challenge Grant which focuses on decreasing Maternal/Child Health and infant mortality rates by addressing disparities and transportation.- 2018 - Mercy Hospital St. Louis continued the Diabetes Empowerment Education Program for minorities battling diabetes in North St. Louis County.- 2018 Mercy Hospital Washington Social Workers continued establishing ED patients with Primary Care Physicians for follow-up care and educating the patient on possibly more affordable options when needing care.- 2018 Mercy Hospital Washington opened a free COPD education clinic in Washington for their patients- 2018 Mercy Hospital Washington opened a Winter Warming Overnight Center to prevent those sleeping outside from freezing to death.- 2018 - Mercy Hospital Washington, in partnership with the Multi-County Drug Task Force and Franklin County Sheriff's Office, began training first responders in several counties so that they could begin carrying and utilizing Narcan to revive overdosed patients while waiting for the ambulance to arrive. The local Mercy hospital stored the Narcan in their pharmacy.Additional needs being addressed by the Mercy Hospital St. Louis and Mercy Hospital Washington include: - Violence: Domestic, Elderly, Child Abuse, and TraffickingMHSL - MHSL and Alternatives to Living in Violent Environments (ALIVE), a St. Louis based domestic violence agency, have implemented Project HOPE, the only program in the St. Louis area that allows domestic violence survivors to file for, and potentially have granted, orders of protection while still in a hospital setting. Information regarding ALIVE's programming and services is distributed throughout MHSL, with Spanish translations provided to better reach patients who speak limited English. MHSL is also actively involved in the Coalition Against Trafficking and Exploitation (CATE), and partners with St. Martha's Hall, a Catholic Charities organization that provides shelter and services to women and children who have survived domestic violence. Mercy will continue its collaboration and involvement with these groups, as well as the awareness and education campaigns it has begun with restroom resource posters, a training video, and the incorporation of a screening question/referral process in Mercy's Electronic Medical Record (EMR). However, it was felt by Mercy's CHC that while continued attention to this issue was important, the issues of access, health equity, and the community's crisis with behavioral health and addiction demanded Mercy's focus at this time.MHW - MHW works closely with domestic violence, sex trafficking and family services agencies, such as Alternatives to Living in Violent Environments (ALIVE) and local law enforcement to insure patients are given safe choices while in a hospital setting. Mercy has begun safety awareness and educational campaigns which includes internal training videos, restroom resource posters, and the incorporation of a safety screening/referral question which cues up in each patient's Mercy's Electronic Medical Record (EMR).- Obesity/Poor Nutrition/Physical InactivityMHSL & MHW - Although neither chose healthy lifestyles as a priority community health need to be addressed, Mercy has focused on its own coworkers, 10,000+ in the East Community, as a start to addressing this need. A robust initiative, Mercy's Healthification program, provides comprehensive health evaluation, screening, education, and incentives to increase healthy behaviors and improve health among Mercy coworkers. Mercy Clinic also offers a variety of programs and services to address chronic conditions and a healthy lifestyle.- Chronic Conditions: Heart Disease, Diabetes, or Asthma and AllergiesA significant concern relating to chronic conditions is the disparity in health outcomes and treatment for Blacks/African-Americans and Whites/Caucasians. MHSL recently signed an American Hospital Association Health Equity pledge and is beginning to implement ""Call to Action"" goals aimed at identifying and, subsequently, addressing areas of health disparity and service gaps. As the leader in St Louis County for newborn deliveries, MHSL has decided to take on the significant issue of health equity by beginning with maternal/child health disparities and addressing some of the region's needs with low birth weight babies. Mercy has also committed to addressing health equity in the Inner North region community of Wellston; Mercy is outlining a collaborative community plan to address overall health equity with these community members.- Cancers and Tobacco UseMHSL & MHW - Community cancer screenings and education continue to be offered regionally. Efforts to address tobacco cessation will continue through Mercy's Certified Health and Wellness Coach/Mercy Road to Freedom program though Mercy's Cardiopulmonary Rehab area. Additionally, Mercy will continue to advocate around measures that promote tobacco cessation. For example, Tobacco 21, a bill introduced by a MHSL physician in 2016 to raise the tobacco products purchase age to 21 in St. Louis County. The bill was passed and the new tobacco products purchase age law will go into effect on December 1, 2016. MHW will look for opportunities to expand this legislation to Franklin County. Other identified needs not being addressed and why not, if applicable.The following needs are not being addressed:- Sexually Transmitted InfectionsMHSL & MHW - Infectious disease physicians at Mercy will continue to address this issue through collaborative work. Mercy will not, however, take a lead role on this issue as there are some limitations to the organization's partnerships in this area as a Catholic Health System. - Physical Environment: Air/Water Quality and HousingMHW - In the category of Physical Environment, MHW has chosen Transportation, under the Access to Care priority. Collaboration with local coalitions addressing homelessness and housing will continue as will Mercy's support of industry, government, non-governmental organizations and the public in addressing air and water quality in our area."

HICCC MERGED WITH THE HEALTHY CHICAGO HOSPITAL COLLABORATIVE. THE MERGER ALLOWED PARTNERS TO FURTHER ALIGN THEIR EFFORTS AND ACHIEVE GREATER COLLECTIVE IMPACT IN CHICAGO AND COOK COUNTY. ON JUNE 30, 2017, HOSPITAL PARTNERS FROM BOTH COLLABORATIVES MET TO KICK OFF THE START OF A FULLY MERGED INITIATIVE. THE NAME SELECTED FOR THE MERGER WAS THE ALLIANCE FOR HEALTH EQUITY (AFHE). THE ALLIANCE FOR HEALTH EQUITY IS A PARTNERSHIP BETWEEN THE ILLINOIS PUBLIC HEALTH INSTITUTE (IPHI), HOSPITALS, HEALTH DEPARTMENTS AND COMMUNITY ORGANIZATIONS ACROSS CHICAGO AND COOK COUNTY. THIS INITIATIVE IS ONE OF THE LARGEST COLLABORATIVE HOSPITAL-COMMUNITY PARTNERSHIPS IN THE COUNTRY WITH THE CURRENT INVOLVEMENT OF 30+ NONPROFIT AND PUBLIC HOSPITALS, SEVEN LOCAL HEALTH DEPARTMENTS, AND REPRESENTATIVES OF MORE THAN 100 COMMUNITY ORGANIZATIONS SERVING ON ACTION TEAMS. PARTNERS ARE COMING TOGETHER WITH THE GOAL OF WORKING ON STRATEGIES TO ADDRESS THE PRESSING ISSUES IN OUR COMMUNITIES TO ACHIEVE GREATER COLLECTIVE IMPACT.GIVEN THE SIZE AND DIVERSITY OF COOK COUNTY, THE COLLABORATIVE CREATED THREE REGIONS-NORTH, CENTRAL AND SOUTH-FOR PURPOSES OF ORGANIZING THE ASSESSMENT PROCESS. ADVOCATE CHRIST WAS APPROPRIATELY ASSIGNED TO THE SOUTH REGION CONSISTING OF BOTH THE SOUTH SIDE OF CHICAGO AND THE SOUTH SUBURBS OF COOK COUNTY.

ADDITIONALLY, FOR PURPOSES OF THE 2014-2016 CHNA CYCLE, THE HOSPITAL FORMED A COMMUNITY HEALTH COUNCIL (COUNCIL) CONSISTING OF 25 COMMUNITY AND MEDICAL CENTER LEADERS. THIS COUNCIL, IN PARTNERSHIP WITH THE COMMUNITY HEALTH DEPARTMENT, WAS CONVENED TO OVERSEE THE ASSESSMENT. DATA FROM THE HEALTH IMPACT COLLABORATIVE OF COOK COUNTY WAS PRESENTED TO THE COUNCIL INCLUDING THE PRIORITY-SETTING PROCESS THAT IDENTIFIED SOCIAL DETERMINANTS OF HEALTH, MENTAL HEALTH AND SUBSTANCE ABUSE, ACCESS TO CARE AND CHRONIC DISEASE AS THE FOUR COUNTY-WIDE PRIORITIES. ALL HOSPITALS THAT PARTICIPATED IN THE COLLABORATIVE AGREED TO ADDRESS SOCIAL DETERMINANTS AS ONE OF THEIR PRIORITIES, WITH ADVOCATE CHRIST IDENTIFYING THAT VIOLENCE PREVENTION WAS ONE OF THEIR PRIORITY AREAS.IN ADDITION, MULTIPLE INDICATORS FROM THE HEALTHY COMMUNITIES INSTITUTE (HCI) DATA PLATFORM WERE SHARED WITH THE ADVOCATE CHRIST'S COMMUNITY HEALTH COUNCIL. MANY OF THESE INDICATORS WERE PARTICULARLY USEFUL TO THE ASSESSMENT BECAUSE THE HOSPITALIZATION AND EMERGENCY ROOM VISIT RATES WERE AVAILABLE BY ZIP CODE, THUS PERMITTING A DEEPER LOOK INTO THE HEALTH STATUS OF THE MEDICAL CENTER'S PRIMARY SERVICE AREA (PSA). A CONSENSUS VOTING PROCESS WAS USED BY THE COUNCIL TO SELECT THE SECOND AND THIRD PRIORITIES FOR THE 2014-2016 CHNA CYCLE-ASTHMA AND DIABETES. CANCER, HEART DISEASE AND HYPERTENSION (STROKE) WERE NOT SELECTED PRIMARILY BECAUSE THE MEDICAL CENTER ALREADY HAS INSTITUTES ADDRESSING EACH OF THESE IMPORTANT HEALTH NEEDS. THE THREE PRIORITIES SELECTED BY ADVOCATE CHRIST WERE VIOLENCE PREVENTION, ASTHMA AND DIABETES.ADVOCATE CHRIST DEVELOPED AN IMPLEMENTATION PLAN FOR EACH OF THE SELECTED PRIORITIES. COMMUNITY HEALTH STAFF ALSO PARTICIPATED IN THE ACTION PLANNING TEAMS ON COMMUNITY SAFETY AND CHRONIC DISEASE PREVENTION WORK GROUPS CONVENED AS PART OF THE AFHE. FOR VIOLENCE PREVENTION, THE MEDICAL CENTER CONTINUED ITS WORK WITH CEASEFIRE AND COLLABORATED WITH COMMUNITY ORGANIZATIONS TO INVESTIGATE HOW RESTORATIVE JUSTICE PRACTICES CAN IMPACT THE VIOLENCE ON CHILDREN.

PROGRAM RESULTS FOR JANUARY 2018 TO NOVEMBER 2018 WERE AS FOLLOWS:- NINETY-FOUR PERCENT OF ALL VIOLENT INJURY PATIENTS ADMITTED TO THE INPATIENT UNIT WERE ASSESSED BY THE HOSPITAL CASE MANAGER.- NINETY-FIVE PERCENT OF INDIVIDUALS ASSESSED WERE LINKED TO LONG-TERM SUPPORT BY BEING CONNECTED WITH EXISTING COMMUNITY RESOURCES.- SEVENTY-SIX PERCENT OF INDIVIDUALS ASSESSED WERE LINKED TO LONG-TERM SUPPORT BY BEING CONNECTED WITH A COMMUNITY-BASED OUTREACH WORKER.- A TOTAL OF 563 PATIENTS RECEIVED CEASEFIRE INTERVENTION SERVICES.- A TOTAL OF 547 VIOLENT INJURY PATIENTS FROM THE HOSPITAL'S PSA AND SSA WERE TREATED AT ADVOCATE CHRIST.ASTHMAADVOCATE CHRIST'S GOAL WAS TO REDUCE THE INCIDENCE OF UNCONTROLLED ASTHMA AMONG ADULTS AND CHILDREN WITHIN THE PRIMARY SERVICE AREA-STRATEGIES INCLUDED PARTNERING WITH THE METROPOLITAN TENANT ORGANIZATION ON THE HEALTHY HOMES INITIATIVE FOR CHILDREN WITH ASTHMA. COMMUNITY HEALTH STAFF COLLABORATED WITH CLINICAL STAFF IN INPATIENT MEDICAL CENTER UNITS AS WELL AS THE EMERGENCY DEPARTMENT (ED) TO IMPROVE DISEASE SELF-MANAGEMENT SKILLS FOR PATIENTS AND FAMILIES WITH ASTHMA. ADVOCATE CHRIST COLLABORATED WITH ADVOCATE CHILDREN'S-OAK LAWN TO PROVIDE ""KICKIN' ASTHMA,"" AN EVIDENCE-BASED EDUCATION/DISEASE SELF-MANAGEMENT PROGRAM IN HIGH RISK SCHOOLS IN THE PRIMARY SERVICE AREA.PROGRAM RESULTS FOR 2018 WERE AS FOLLOWS:- A CONTRACT WITH METROPOLITAN TENANT ORGANIZATION (MTO) WAS EXCUTED IN DECEMBER 2017. AS A RESULT, THERE WERE FIVE STAFF TRAINED AND TWO HEALTHY HOME WORKSHOPS OFFERED IN 2018.- THE AMERICAN LUNG ASSOCIATION'S BREATHE WELL LIVE WELL PROGRAM WAS SELECTED AS THE ASTHMA SELF MANAGEMENT PROGRAM TO IMPLEMENT FOR ADULTS. A TOTAL OF TWO COMMUNITY ORGANIZATIONS HOSTED THE PROGRAM AND EIGHT COMMUNITY PARTICIPANTS ATTENDED THE FOUR SESSION SELF-MANAGEMENT SERIES.- ADVOCATE CHILDREN'S HEALTH EDUCATOR ENGAGED THREE SCHOOLS IN 2018. A TOTAL OF 22 STUDENTS WERE ENROLLED IN THE KICKIN' ASTHMA PROGRAM AND 15 STUDENTS COMPLETED ALL FOUR SESSIONS OF THE PROGRAM. DIABETESTHE OVERALL GOAL IS REDUCE THE INCIDENCE OF DIABETES IN PSA COMMUNITIES THAT HAVE THE HIGHEST SOCIONEEDS INDEX - AUBURN GRESHAM, CHICAGO LAWN, BRIGTHON PARK, AND WEST ENGLEWOOD. CREATED BY THE HEALTHY COMMUNITIES INSTITUTE, THE SOCIONEEDS INDEX IS A MEASURE OF SOCIOECONOMIC NEED THAT IS CORRELATED WITH POOR HEALTH OUTCOMES. INDICATORS FOR THE INDEX ARE WEIGHTED TO MAXIMIZE THE CORRELATION OF THE INDEX WITH PREMATURE DEATH RATES AND PREVENTABLE HOSPITALIZATION RATES. THIS INDEX COMBINES MULTIPLE SOCIOECONOMIC INDICATORS INTO A SINGLE COMPOSITE VALUE. AS A SINGLE INDICATOR, THE INDEX CAN SERVE AS A CONCISE WAY TO EXPLAIN WHICH AREAS ARE OF HIGHEST NEED. THE SCORES CAN RANGE FROM 1 TO 100. A SCORE OF 100 REPRESENTS THE HIGHEST SOCIOECONOMIC NEED. HOSPITALIZATION AND EMERGENCY DEPARTMENT (ED) VISITS ARE INDICATIVE OF POORLY CONTROLLED CHRONIC DISEASES AND A LACK OF ACCESS TO ROUTINE PREVENTIVE CARE. POORLY CONTROLLED DIABETES CAN LEAD TO SEVERE OR LIFE-THREATENING COMPLICATIONS SUCH AS HEART AND BLOOD VESSEL DISEASE, NERVE DAMAGE, KIDNEY DAMAGE, EYE DAMAGE AND BLINDNESS, FOOT DAMAGE AND LOWER EXTREMITY AMPUTATION, HEARING IMPAIRMENT, SKIN CONDITIONS, AND ALZHEIMER'S DISEASE.ADVOCATE CHRIST IMPLEMENTATION STRATEGIES INCLUDED:1. IMPLEMENTATION OF THE CENTERS OF DISEASE CONTROL (CDC) NATIONAL DIABETES PREVENTION PROGRAM'S (DPP) IN TARGETED COMMUNITY AREAS IN PARTNERSHIP WITH COMMUNITY-BASED ORGANIZATIONS AND FAITH COMMUNITIES; 2. ESTABLISHMENT OF ADVOCATE CHRIST AS A RECOGNIZED DIABETES PREVENTION PROGRAM SITE BY ACHEIVING FULL RECOGNITION STATUS BY THE CDC; AND 3. INCREASING COMMUNITY EDUCATIONAL OPPORTUNITIES TO SUPPORT DIABETES SELF-MANAGEMENT SKILLS.PROGRAM RESULTS FOR JANUARY 2018 TO DECEMBER 2018 WERE AS FOLLOWS:- ONE FULL SESSION OF 22 CLASSES WAS COMPLETED IN AUGUST 2018.- THREE NEW COHORTS BEGAN IN 2018, INCLUDING ONE SESSION WITH TRINITY UNITED CHURCH OF CHRIST. TO INCREASE PARTICIPANT RETENTION, EIGHT ADDITIONAL CLASS SESSIONS WERE ADDED TO EACH COHORT.- THERE WERE 45 PARTICIPANTS ENROLLED IN THE DPP PROGRAM IN 2018. - NINETY-TWO PERCENT OF PARTICIPANTS COMPLETED NINE OF THE 16 SESSIONS WITHIN THE FIRST SIX MONTHS.NEEDS NOT SELECTED TO ADDRESS BY ADVOCATE CHRIST THE NEEDS ADVOCATE CHRIST DID NOT SELECT AS PRIORITIES TO ADDRESS INCLUDE CANCER, HEART DISEASE AND HYPERTENSION. WHILE THESE WERE IMPORTANT HEALTH NEEDS, THE COUNCIL FELT ADVOCATE CHRIST'S CLINICAL INSTITUTES (CARDIOVASCULAR, NEUROSCIENCE AND ONCOLOGY) WERE ADDRESSING CANCER, HEART DISEASE AND STROKE. CANCERADVOCATE CHRIST'S CANCER PROGRAM HAS BEEN CERTIFIED BY THE AMERICAN COLLEGE OF SURGEONS, COMMISSION ON CANCER AND INCLUDES BOTH INPATIENT AND OUTPATIENT UNITS, A RADIATION ONCOLOGY UNIT, CYBERKNIFE TREATMENT, INTRAOPERATIVE ELECTRON RADIATION THERAPY (IOERT), A HOME HEALTH/HOSPICE PROGRAM, A BREAST HEALTH PROGRAM AND A COMMUNITY EDUCATION PROGRAM. NUTRITIONAL SERVICES, SOCIAL SERVICES, SPIRITUAL CARE AND AN ONCOLOGY CERTIFIED PHARMACIST ARE AVAILABLE ON SITE TO WORK WITH PATIENTS AND THEIR FAMILIES. CLINICAL RESEARCH TRIALS ARE ALSO AVAILABLE THROUGH THE ADVOCATE CHILDREN'S ONCOLOGY GROUP (COG).ADVOCATE CHRIST OFFERS CANCER-FOCUSED HOSPICE CARE AND FREE SEMINARS OPEN TO THE PUBLIC. A SPECIALLY TRAINED ONCOLOGY NUTRITIONIST SEES PATIENTS IN THE MEDICAL CENTER AND THOSE UNDERGOING OUTPATIENT TREATMENT. THE PALLIATIVE CARE TEAM WORKS CLOSELY WITH PHYSICIANS AND PATIENTS TO PROVIDE COMFORT, COMMUNICATION ASSISTANCE AND TO ASSESS PATIENTS' PHYSICAL NEEDS TO ENHANCE THEIR QUALITY OF LIFE AT ALL STAGES OF ILLNESS. IN ADDITION, THERE IS AN ON-SITE AMERICAN CANCER SOCIETY PATIENT REPRESENTATIVE AND A GILDA'S CLUB SATELLITE LOCATION.HEART DISEASEADVOCATE HEART INSTITUTE AT ADVOCATE CHRIST IS ILLINOIS' MOST COMPREHENSIVE CENTER FOR HEART CARE.

THE LINK FOR THE ASSESSMENT CAN BE FOUND AT: HTTP://HEALTHYHOI.ORG. IN BRIEF, THE FOLLOWING STEPS OCCURRED DURING THE PRIORITIZATION PROCESS WITH THE CENTRAL ILLINOIS COMMUNITY HEALTH COLLABORATIVE.- DATA WAS PRESENTED FOR HEALTH CONCERNS FOR THE TRI-COUNTY REGION- DISCUSSION OCCURRED REGARDING THE ISSUES AND POTENTIAL GROUPING OF ISSUES- THE PEARL TEST WAS APPLIED FROM THE HANLON METHOD- THE COLLABORATIVE COUNCIL VOTED TO NARROW ISSUES- THE COLLABORATIVE COUNCIL VOTED A SECOND TIME BASED ON MAGNITUDE, SEVERITY AND ABILITY TO IMPACT THROUGH COLLABORATION- CONSENSUS WAS AGREED UPON FOR TWO HEALTH PRIORITIES FOR THE TRI-COUNTY REGIONTHE TWO NEEDS IDENTIFIED DURING THE PRIORITIZATION PROCESS WERE:- HEALTHY EATING/ACTIVE LIVING; AND- MENTAL HEALTH HEALTH NEED SELECTED MENTAL HEALTH THE COMMUNITY HEALTH NEEDS ASSESSMENT TEAM AT ADVOCATE EUREKA SELECTED MENTAL HEALTH AS A HEALTH PRIORITY FOR SEVERAL REASONS. IN ADDITION TO MENTAL HEALTH BEING IDENTIFIED AS A TOP HEALTH PRIORITY FOR THE CENTRAL ILLINOIS COMMUNITY HEALTH COLLABORATIVE, BEHAVIORAL HEALTH WAS ALSO IDENTIFIED AS ONE OF THREE HEALTH PRIORITIES FOR THE TRI-COUNTY HEALTH DEPARTMENT COLLABORATION. THE HEALTH DEPARTMENTS UTILIZED THE MOBILIZING FOR ACTION THROUGH PLANNING AND PARTNERSHIPS (MAPP) PROCESS TO DETERMINE THE HEALTH PRIORITIES. SPECIFIC TO WOODFORD COUNTY, ON DECEMBER 3, 2015, SEVERAL STAFF MEMBERS FROM ADVOCATE EUREKA, INCLUDING THE ADMINISTRATOR OF ADVOCATE EUREKA, PARTICIPATED IN THE LOCAL FORCES OF CHANGE ASSESSMENT CONDUCTED BY THE WOODFORD COUNTY HEALTH DEPARTMENT AS A PART OF THE TRI-COUNTY MAPP PROCESS. MENTAL HEALTH WAS IDENTIFIED AS ONE OF THE TOP THREE FORCES OF CHANGE BY THE 30 INDIVIDUALS THAT PARTICIPATED IN THE ASSESSMENT. FORCES OF CHANGE ARE DEFINED AS THOSE THINGS THAT INFLUENCE THE HEALTH AND QUALITY OF LIFE FOR WOODFORD COUNTY RESIDENTS. A SECOND REASON MENTAL HEALTH WAS SELECTED AS A KEY HEALTH PRIORITY IS THAT WOODFORD COUNTY RESIDENTS THAT PARTICIPATED IN THE 2016 TRI-COUNTY COMMUNITY HEALTH SURVEY PERCEIVED MENTAL HEALTH AS THE SECOND MOST IMPORTANT HEALTH ISSUE IN THE COMMUNITY.IN ADDITION TO THE ABOVE SURVEY DATA AND LOCAL FORCES OF CHANGE ASSESSMENT RESULTS, THE NUMBER OF SUICIDE ATTEMPTS IN WOODFORD COUNTY FOR THE FIRST HALF OF 2016 HAD EXCEEDED THE NUMBER OF ATTEMPTS FOR THE ENTIRE YEAR IN BOTH 2014 AND 2015. THE NUMBER OF DEATHS DUE TO SUICIDE ALSO INCREASED FROM 2014-2015. AS STATED ABOVE, MENTAL HEALTH WAS ALSO PREVIOUSLY SELECTED AS A KEY HEALTH PRIORITY FOR THE 2011-2013 COMMUNITY HEALTH NEEDS ASSESSMENT BY BOTH ADVOCATE EUREKA AND THE WOODFORD COUNTY HEALTH DEPARTMENT. IT IS CLEAR FROM COMMUNITY INPUT AND CURRENT DATA THAT CONTINUED EFFORTS ARE NEEDED TO REDUCE THE STIGMA ASSOCIATED WITH MENTAL HEALTH AND GIVE FURTHER MOMENTUM TO THE EFFORTS OF IMPROVING MENTAL HEALTH FOR COUNTY RESIDENTS.HIGHLIGHTS FOR STEPS TAKEN IN 2018 TO ADDRESS MENTAL HEALTH ARE LISTED BELOW:- FOUR MENTAL HEALTH FIRST AID (MHFA) COURSES WERE HOSTED AT ADVOCATE EUREKA.- TWO SESSIONS WERE TAUGHT ON DEPRESSION AND ANXIETY FOR APPROXIMATELY 50 FRESHMAN FROM EUREKA HIGH SCHOOL AT EUREKA COLLEGE BY THE ADVOCATE EUREKA SOCIAL WORKER AND MHFA INSTRUCTOR.- A MHFA COURSE WAS HELD FOR 22 RESIDENTIAL ASSISTANTS AT EUREKA COLLEGE.- THE COMMUNITY HEALTH DIRECTOR FOR CENTRAL ILLINOIS SERVED AS A BOARD MEMBER ON THE PARTNERSHIP FOR A HEALTHY COMMUNITY. THE BEHAVIORAL HEALTH PRIORITY ACTION TEAM FOR IMPLEMENTATION IS A SUB-COMMITTEE OF THE BOARD.- ONE HUNDRED AND SIXTEEN COUNSELING AND PSYCHIATRIC SERVICES WERE OFFERED ON-SITE AT ADVOCATE EUREKA. THE SERVICES WERE PROVIDED BY THE TAZWOOD CENTER FOR WELLNESS AT THE HOSPITAL AND ALLOWED RESIDENTS TO RECEIVE CARE LOCALLY VERSUS TRAVELING OUTSIDE OF THE COUNTY FOR CARE.- AS A RESULT OF A PARTNERSHIP BETWEEN ADVOCATE MEDICAL GROUP (AMG) BEHAVIORAL HEALTH, TRI-COUNTY SPECIAL EDUCATION ASSOCIATION AND ILLINOIS STATE UNIVERSITY'S PSYCHOLOGICAL SERVICES CENTER, DOCTORAL PSYCHOLOGY INTERNS ARE PROVIDED FOUR DAYS OF INTEGRATED BEHAVIORAL HEALTH SERVICES ACROSS THREE AMG SETTINGS, ADVOCATE BROMENN OUTPATIENT CENTER, ADVOCATE MEDICAL GROUP EL PASO AND ADVOCATE EUREKA.- TELEPSYCHIATRY CONSULTS WERE AVAILABLE AT ADVOCATE EUREKA BEGINNING IN AUGUST 2017, THUS EXPANDING ACCESS TO PSYCHIATRIC CARE. THERE WERE NO CONSULTS IN 2018.HEALTH NEED NOT SELECTED HEALTHY BEHAVIORSADVOCATE EUREKA DID NOT SELECT HEALTHY BEHAVIORS AS A PRIORITY HEALTH NEED FOR THE HOSPITAL'S 2014-2016 COMMUNITY HEALTH NEEDS ASSESSMENT. THE HOSPITAL COMMUNITY HEALTH NEEDS ASSESSMENT TEAM WANTED TO FOCUS ITS EFFORTS ON ONE MAJOR INITIATIVE AS ITS RESOURCES ARE LIMITED AS A CRITICAL ACCESS HOSPITAL. THE HOSPITAL WILL, HOWEVER, CONTINUE TO SUPPORT THE EFFORTS OF THE TRI-COUNTY HEALTHY EATING/ACTIVE LIVING IMPLEMENTATION SUBCOMMITTEE. A STAFF MEMBER FROM THE HOSPITAL HAS SERVED ON THIS COMMITTEE, WHEN AVAILABLE, TO ASSIST IN PROMOTING HEALTHY EATING AND ACTIVE LIVING IN THE TRI-COUNTY REGION. THE HOSPITAL ALSO EMPLOYS NURSES IN MOST OF THE PUBLIC SCHOOLS IN WOODFORD COUNTY WHO CAN REINFORCE HEALTHIER EATING HABITS AND INCREASED EXERCISE AMONG STUDENTS."
201943199349321899,362169147,ADVOCATE GOOD SHEPHERD HOSPITAL,"PART V, SECTION B, LINE 11: 2014-2016 CHNAADVOCATE GOOD SHEPHERD CONDUCTED A COMPREHENSIVE COMMUNITY HEALTH NEEDS ASSESSMENT WHICH INCLUDED THE SELECTION OF HEALTH PRIORITIES THROUGH A CONSENSUS PRIORITIZATION PROCESS BY THE COMMUNITY HEALTH COUNCIL. THE COUNCIL RECOMMENDED, AND THE HOSPITAL GOVERNING COUNCIL APPROVED, TWO HEALTH AREAS FOR PRIORITY ACTION: 1) OBESITY; AND 2) MENTAL HEALTH. STEPS BEING TAKEN TO ADDRESS THE TWO PRIORITIES ARE PROVIDED BELOW.NEEDS SELECTED TO ADDRESSOBESITYADVOCATE GOOD SHEPHERD IS ADDRESSING OBESITY IN THE SERVICE AREA THROUGH THREE EVIDENCE- BASED PROGRAMS. THE FIRST PROGRAM IS THE NUTRITION AND PHYSICAL ACTIVITY SELF-ASSESSMENT FOR CHILD CARE (GO NAP SACC) PROGRAM. THE GO NAPP SACC PROGRAM IS AN EVIDENCE-BASED EARLY INTERVENTION PROGRAM TARGETING INFANTS THROUGH PRE-KINDERGARTEN WHICH AIMS TO ADVANCE THE CHILDCARE ENVIRONMENT BY IMPROVING NUTRITION, PHYSICAL ACTIVITY AND POLICIES IN THE CHILD CARE CENTER. THE HOSPITAL IS LEADING THE GO NAP SACC ASSESSMENT PROCESS WITH CHILDCARE CENTERS IN COMMUNITIES WITH HIGH SOCIONEEDS INDEX SCORES WITHIN THE HOSPITAL'S SERVICE AREA. SOCIOECONOMIC NEED WAS DETERMINED BY THE HEALTHY COMMUNITIES INSTITUTE'S (HCI) CALCULATIONS TO CREATE AN INDEX USING SIX MAJOR SOCIO-NEEDS INDICATORS THAT ARE CORRELATED WITH POOR HEALTH OUTCOMES. THE INDICATORS INCLUDE INCOME, UNEMPLOYMENT, OCCUPATION, EDUCATION, LANGUAGE AND POVERTY. ADVOCATE GOOD SHEPHERD HAS PARTNERED WITH ADVOCATE CONDELL AND ADVOCATE SHERMAN TO MAKE THIS PROGRAM A REGIONAL INITIATIVE. IN 2018, ADVOCATE HEALTH CARE LED THE LAUNCH OF A MULTI-STAKEHOLDER CHICAGOLAND COALITION TO RAISE FUNDS TO BRING THE WEB-BASED GO NAP SACC PROGRAM TO THE STATE OF ILLINOIS. THE UNIVERSITY OF NORTH CAROLINA PROVIDED ON-LINE TRAINING OF GO NAP SACC TO THE ADVOCATE GOOD SHEPHERD COMMUNITY HEALTH STAFF, RESULTING IN GO NAP SACC TECHNICAL ASSISTANT CONSULTANT CERTIFICATION. IN 2018, FOUR CHILDCARE CENTERS COMPLETED THE GO NAP SACC ASSESSMENT: FRIENDSHIP HOUSE IN CRYSTAL LAKE, SAGE YMCA IN CRYSTAL LAKE, BUEHLER YMCA IN PALATINE AND FOGLIA YMCA IN LAKE ZURICH. AT THE TIME THE CHILDCARE CENTERS COMPLETED THE GO NAP SACC ASSESSMENT, THE ONLINE VERSION WAS NOT AVAILABLE. ONCE THE ONLINE VERSION BECAME AVAILABLE, COMMUNITY HEALTH STAFF MIGRATED THE ASSESSMENTS TO THE ONLINE PORTAL, MAKING IT EASIER TO VIEW THE RESULTS AND CREATE ACTION PLANS. A TOTAL OF 438 CHILDREN ARE ENROLLED IN THE CENTERS WHO HAVE COMPLETED ASSESSMENTS. EACH OF THE CHILDCARE CENTERS IS IN THE PROCESS OF DEVELOPING ACTION PLANS THAT WILL BE IMPLEMENTED IN 2019. COMMUNITY HEALTH STAFF ALSO MET WITH SEVERAL PARK DISTRICTS TO STRATEGIZE THE TIMING OF COMPLETING THE NAP SACC ASSESSMENT AND TO ENGAGE THEIR STAFF IN THE PROGRAM. THE SECOND OBESITY-PREVENTION PROGRAM IS THE CENTERS FOR DISEASE CONTROL AND PREVENTION (CDC) WORKSITE WELLNESS PROGRAM WHICH TARGETS ADULTS IN THE WORKPLACE. THE PROGRAM FOLLOWS THE CDC FOUR-STEP WORKPLACE HEALTH MODEL AND INVOLVES USING THE CDC WORKSITE HEALTH SCORECARD. WORKSITE NUTRITION AND PHYSICAL ACTIVITY PROGRAMS ARE DESIGNED TO IMPROVE HEALTH-RELATED BEHAVIORS AND HEALTH OUTCOMES. ADVOCATE GOOD SHEPHERD COMMUNITY HEALTH STAFF WORKED WITH THE HOSPITAL'S COMMUNITY RELATIONS DIRECTOR TO PROVIDE WORKSITE HEALTH TRAINING AND PROGRAMS TO CHAMBERS OF COMMERCE AND SMALL BUSINESSES WITHIN THE SERVICE AREA. IN 2018, COMMUNITY HEALTH STAFF SUSPENDED THE WORKSITE WELLNESS PROGRAM. THE DECISION WAS BASED ON VERY LOW INTEREST FROM ALL LOCAL CHAMBERS OF COMMERCE AND LOCAL WORKPLACES. THROUGHOUT 2018, THE COMMUNITY RELATIONS DIRECTOR AND COMMUNITY HEALTH STAFF MET WITH SEVERAL CHAMBERS OF COMMERCE IN MCHENRY, ALGONQUIN/LAKE IN THE HILLS, LAKE ZURICH, CRYSTAL LAKE, BARRINGTON AND WAUCONDA. EACH OF THE CHAMBERS OF COMMERCE REACHED OUT TO THEIR SMALL BUSINESSES BUT FOUND THERE WAS A LACK OF INTEREST IN WORKSITE WELLNESS AT THIS TIME. BUSINESSES INDICATED THAT THEY HAVE VERY LIMITED STAFF AND ARE UNABLE TO DIRECT EMPLOYEE TIME AND FOCUS TOWARD A WORKSITE WELLNESS PROGRAM. THE COORDINATOR OF COMMUNITY HEALTH HAD SEVERAL WORKSITE WELLNESS MEETINGS CANCELLED BY SMALL BUSINESS OWNERS DUE TO LAST MINUTE TIME CONSTRAINTS AND UNEXCEPTED ABSENT STAFF MEMBERS. IN 2017, CASA (COURT APPOINTED SPECIAL ADVOCATE) OF MCHENRY COUNTY COMPLETED THE WORKSITE WELLNESS CDC SCORECARD WITH PLANS FOR DEVELOPING IMPLEMENTATION PLANS IN EARLY 2018. THE STAFF HAD ALREADY BEGUN TO WORK ON NEW POLICIES DIRECTED TOWARD BREASTFEEDING AND A WALKING PROGRAM. IN JANUARY OF 2018, CASA HIRED A NEW EXECUTIVE DIRECTOR, WHO DECIDED THE NEW POLICIES WERE NOT NEEDED AT THIS TIME. IT WAS THEN DETERMINED THAT RESOURCES AND TIME WOULD BE BETTER SPENT ON OTHER OBESITY PREVENTION PROGRAMS. COMMUNITY HEALTH STAFF DECIDED TO REPLACE THE CDC WORKSITE WELLNESS PROGRAM WITH THE GO LAKE COUNTY CAMPAIGN. GO LAKE COUNTY IS A WALKING INITIATIVE THAT PROMOTES HEALTHY AND ACTIVE LIVING THROUGH WALKING EVENTS WITHIN LAKE COUNTY COMMUNITIES. GO LAKE COUNTY ENABLES EVERYONE TO INCREASE THEIR LEVEL OF DAILY PHYSICAL ACTIVITY AND FOSTER COMMUNITY ENGAGEMENT. IN 2018, ADVOCATE GOOD SHEPHERD BEGAN PARTNERING WITH THE WAUCONDA PARK DISTRICT AND WILL BE SPONSORING THE GO WAUCONDA CAMPAIGN. THE WAUCONDA PARK DISTRICT AND COMMUNITY HEALTH STAFF HELD PLANNING SESSIONS FOR THE GO WAUCONDA PROGRAM IN 2018 AND PLANS TO LAUNCH THE PROGRAM IN SUMMER OF 2019. THE THIRD OBESITY PREVENTION INITIATIVE IS FOOD INSECURITY (FI) SCREENING AND RESOURCE REFERRAL. THE FI SCREEN RAPIDLY IDENTIFIES HOUSEHOLDS AT RISK FOR FOOD INSECURITY, ENABLING PROVIDERS TO TARGET SERVICES THAT AMELIORATE THE ASSOCIATED HEALTH AND DEVELOPMENTAL CONSEQUENCES. THE TWO-ITEM EVIDENCE-BASED FI SCREEN TOOL WAS ORIGINALLY DESIGNED TO BE SENSITIVE, SPECIFIC AND VALID AMONG LOW-INCOME FAMILIES WITH YOUNG CHILDREN. THE HOSPITAL IS COLLABORATING WITH SENIOR SERVICE ORGANIZATIONS IN THE ADVOCATE GOOD SHEPHERD SERVICE AREA TO SCREEN SENIORS FOR FOOD INSECURITY, USING THE HUNGER VITAL SIGN FI QUESTIONNAIRE. INDIVIDUALS WHO ARE IDENTIFIED AS FOOD INSECURE ARE REFERRED TO COMMUNITY RESOURCES (FOOD PANTRIES, SUPPLEMENTAL NUTRITION ASSISTANCE PROGRAM (SNAP), MEALS ON WHEELS, CONGREGATE MEAL PROGRAMS, FARMERS MARKETS AND COMMUNITY GARDENS. IN 2018, ADVOCATE GOOD SHEPHERD STAFF ADDED TO THE ADVOCATE GOOD SHEPHERD FOOD AND NUTRITION RESOURCE GUIDE, WHICH NOW INCLUDES 72 FOOD RESOURCES THROUGHOUT THE COMMUNITY. THIS GUIDE IS AVAILABLE TO ANY COMMUNITY MEMBER AND IS PROVIDED TO ALL SENIORS SCREENING POSITIVE FOR FOOD INSECURITY AT THE LOCAL SENIOR SERVICES PARTNER LOCATIONS. IN 2018, COMMUNITY HEALTH STAFF RECRUITED AND TRAINED FIVE MORE SENIOR SERVICE AGENCIES: THE MCHENRY SENIOR CENTER, ELA TOWNSHIP SENIOR CENTER, CRYSTAL LAKE SENIOR SERVICES, HARVARD SENIOR CENTER AND ADVOCATE GOOD SHEPHERD DIABETES CENTER. THERE ARE NOW SEVEN AGENCIES IMPLEMENTING THE SCREENING, INCLUDING THE TWO THAT STARTED IN 2017-THE ADVOCATE GOOD SHEPHERD SENIOR SERVICES DEPARTMENT AND THE BARRINGTON AREA COUNCIL ON AGING (BACOA). EACH OF THESE AGENCIES INCORPORATED THE HUNGER VITAL SIGN FI SCREENING INTO THEIR COUNSELING APPOINTMENTS WITH SENIORS. IN 2018, 997 SENIORS COMPLETED THE HUNGER VITAL SIGN SCREENING AND 111 SENIORS SCREENED POSITIVE FOR FOOD INSECURITY (ELEVEN PERCENT). ON SEPTEMBER 5, 2018, COMMUNITY HEALTH STAFF HOSTED A FOOD INSECURITY AMONG SENIORS PRESENTATION AT ADVOCATE GOOD SHEPHERD, PRESENTED BY THE NORTHERN ILLINOIS FOOD BANK. TWENTY-SIX LOCAL AGENCIES WERE REPRESENTED. MENTAL HEALTHTHE HOSPITAL IS ADDRESSING MENTAL HEALTH IN THE ADVOCATE GOOD SHEPHERD SERVICE AREA THROUGH THREE STRATEGIES. THE FIRST STRATEGY UTILIZES MENTAL HEALTH FIRST AID TRAINING. MENTAL HEALTH FIRST AID IS AN INTERNATIONAL EVIDENCE-BASED PROGRAM, DESIGNED TO HELP PEOPLE RECOGNIZE INDIVIDUALS WITH MENTAL HEALTH PROBLEMS AND PROVIDE SKILLS TO HELP THOSE WHO ARE HAVING A MENTAL HEALTH CRISIS TO ACCESS HELP. USING THE MENTAL HEALTH YOUTH FIRST AID CURRICULUM, THE HOSPITAL IS TARGETING TEACHERS, PHYSICAL EDUCATION (PE) INSTRUCTORS AND COACHES. THE HOSPITAL ALSO PLANS TO HOLD MENTAL HEALTH FIRST AID SESSIONS FOR ADVOCATE GOOD SHEPHERD CARE MANAGERS, SOCIAL WORKERS AND ONCOLOGY NURSE NAVIGATORS. FINALLY, THE HOSPITAL WILL ENSURE THE TRAINING OF TWO INDIVIDUALS TO BECOME MENTAL HEALTH FIRST AID INSTRUCTORS, WHICH REQUIRES COMPLETING A 40-HOUR TRAINING COURSE."

TAKING THIS INTO CONSIDERATION, THE CHC SELECTED HEALTHY LIFESTYLES AS ONE OF THE TWO HEALTH PRIORITIES TO ADDRESS, DUE TO THE LARGE IMPACT IT HAS ON QUALITY OF LIFE AND OVERALL HEALTH STATUS. THE PREVENTION OF OBESITY, PROPER NUTRITION AND PHYSICAL ACTIVITY HAVE THE POTENTIAL TO DECREASE THE RATE OF CHRONIC DISEASE THUS INCREASING LIFE EXPECTANCY AND QUALITY OF LIFE. THE TERM HEALTHY LIFESTYLES IS USED TO ENCOMPASS MULTIPLE FACTORS THAT CAUSE OBESITY AND IMPACT QUALITY.

DATA TRENDS INDICATED THAT MENTAL HEALTH ISSUES ARE INCREASING AND THE NEED FOR MENTAL HEALTH SERVICES AND PROGRAMMING IS CONTINUING TO GROW. THIS IS A HEALTH NEED THAT IS ALSO CORRELATED WITH SUBSTANCE ABUSE AS MANY SUBSTANCE USERS/ABUSERS ALSO EXPERIENCE MENTAL HEALTH ISSUES AND MANY INDIVIDUALS WITH MENTAL HEALTH DISORDERS EXPERIENCE SUBSTANCE ABUSE ISSUES. THE NATIONAL ALLIANCE FOR MENTAL ILLNESS (NAMI), ONE OF THE LEADING MENTAL HEALTH AGENCIES IN DUPAGE COUNTY, PROVIDED MENTAL HEALTH DATA THAT ALSO INDICATED THE NEED FOR RESILIENCE AND MENTAL HEALTH CRISIS TRAINING AMONG ADOLESCENTS AND YOUNG ADULTS. THE HIGH RATES OF ED VISITS AND HOSPITALIZATION DUE TO MENTAL HEALTH ISSUES ARE PREVENTABLE THROUGH EMPLOYING COPING MECHANISMS AND RESILIENCE TRAINING.

DATA PRESENTED TO THE CHC TARGETED THE FOLLOWING HEALTH CONDITIONS IDENTIFIED AS IMPORTANT IN ADVOCATE SOUTH SUBURBAN'S PRIMARY AND SECONDARY SERVICE AREA: ASTHMA, CANCER, DIABETES, HEART DISEASE, HYPERTENSION AND STROKE. THE FOLLOWING CRITERIA WERE ALSO CONSIDERED IN DETERMINING PRIORITIES:- DEGREE TO WHICH COMMUNITY PARTNERS ARE INVOLVED IN SOLVING/ADDRESSING THE HEALTH ISSUE;- HOSPITAL AND COMMUNITY RESOURCES AVAILABLE TO ADDRESS THE HEALTH ISSUE;- HOSPITAL'S CAPACITY TO ADDRESS THE HEALTH ISSUES;- IMPORTANCE OF THE HEALTH PROBLEM TO THE COMMUNITY; AND- DEGREE TO WHICH EFFECTIVE PROGRAMS ARE AVAILABLE TO THE COMMUNITY. AFTER DISCUSSION AND REVIEW OF SIGNIFICANT DATA FINDINGS, THE CHC MEMBERS WERE INSTRUCTED TO RANK THE SEVEN HEALTH CONDITIONS BY VOTING ON THOSE THAT THEY PERCEIVED TO BE THE MOST IMPORTANT TO ADDRESS FOR THE COMMUNITIES WITHIN THE HOSPITAL'S PRIMARY SERVICE AREA. THE MULTI-VOTING STRATEGY RESULTED IN ASTHMA AND DIABETES RECEIVING THE HIGHEST NUMBER OF VOTES. HOUSING WAS SELECTED AS A FOCUS AREA BY CHC MEMBERS AS THE SOCIAL, ECONOMIC OR STRUCTURAL DETERMINANT OF HEALTH RELATED TO THE HICCC PRIORITY. THEREFORE, FOR THE 2014-2016 CHNA, ADVOCATE SOUTH SUBURBAN SELECTED THREE PRIORITIES FOR IMPLEMENTATION PLANNING: 1) ASTHMA; 2) DIABETES; AND 3) HOUSING AS A SOCIAL DETERMINANT OF HEALTH (SDOH).NEEDS SELECTED AS PRIORITIES TO ADDRESSASTHMA ASTHMA AND OTHER RESPIRATORY-RELATED DISEASES WITHIN ADVOCATE SOUTH SUBURBAN'S PSA WERE SELECTED AS A TOP HEALTH NEED TO ADDRESS. AN EXAMINATION OF ADVOCATE SOUTH SUBURBAN'S INPATIENT ADMISSIONS AND EMERGENCY DEPARTMENT UTILIZATION DATA SHOWED THERE WERE A SIGNIFICANT NUMBER OF INDIVIDUALS THAT SEEK SERVICES FOR ASTHMA/RESPIRATORY HEALTH ISSUES FROM THE HOSPITAL. IN FACT, PULMONARY ADMISSIONS WERE THE SECOND MOST PREVALENT TYPE OF INPATIENT ADMISSION AND THE EIGHTH MOST PREVALENT REASON FOR EMERGENCY DEPARTMENT VISITS. THE SEVERITY AND PREVALENCE OF ASTHMA IS MOST EVIDENT IN LOW-INCOME, MINORITY COMMUNITIES. TO ADDRESS ASTHMA IN THE HIGH-RISK COMMUNITIES THE HOSPITAL SERVES, THE HOSPITAL HAS DIRECTED ITS KICKIN' ASTHMA PROGRAM TOWARD THE MOST VULNERABLE COMMUNITIES IN ITS SERVICE AREA. KICKIN' ASTHMA IS AN ASTHMA MANAGEMENT PROGRAM FOR KIDS AGES 11-16 (GRADES 6-10) THAT EDUCATES AND EMPOWERS THEM THROUGH A FUN AND INTERACTIVE APPROACH TO ASTHMA SELF-MANAGEMENT. THE PROGRAM INCLUDES DIFFERENT LEARNING TECHNIQUES SUITABLE FOR CHILDREN AND HIGHLIGHTS SELF-MANAGEMENT PRACTICES, SUCH AS RECOGNIZING TRIGGERS AND PROPER MEDICATION USE. THESE COMMUNITIES INCLUDE: CHICAGO HEIGHTS, 60411; HARVEY, 60426; MARKHAM, 60428; HAZEL CREST, 60429; AND COUNTRY CLUB HILLS, 60478. THE FOLLOWING OUTCOMES WERE ACHIEVED DURING 2018:STRATEGY 1: EXPAND THE KICKIN' ASTHMA PROGRAM TO SCHOOLS IN THE FOLLOWING ZIP CODES: 60411, 60426, 60428, 60429 AND 60478.- TWO PARTNER SCHOOLS HOSTED THE KICKIN' ASTHMA PROGRAM IN 2018.- EIGHTEEN STUDENTS PARTICIPATED IN THE PROGRAM.- NONE OF THE 18 STUDENTS WHO ATTENDED THE KICKIN' ASTHMA CLASS HAD AN ED VISIT WITHIN THREE MONTHS POST PROGRAM.STRATEGY 2: PROVIDE ASTHMA EDUCATION THROUGH PARTNERSHIPS WITH COMMUNITY ORGANIZATIONS THAT TEACH PARTICIPANTS WHAT ADULTS SHOULD DO IN CASE A CHILD EXPERIENCES AN ASTHMA ATTACK.- ADVOCATE SOUTH SUBURBAN PARTNERED WITH TWO SCHOOLS, IN UNDERSERVED COMMUNITIES TO CONDUCT THE KICKIN' ASTHMA PROGRAM.

IN 2018, 25 COMMUNITY MEMBERS WERE TRAINED IN ASTHMA EDUCATION.DIABETESACCORDING TO THE ILLINOIS DEPARTMENT OF PUBLIC HEALTH, MORE THAN 29 MILLION PEOPLE IN THE UNITED STATES HAVE DIABETES MELLITUS. ABOUT ONE-THIRD OF THESE PEOPLE ARE UNAWARE THAT THEY HAVE DIABETES AND ARE NOT UNDER MEDICAL CARE. EACH YEAR, 1.9 MILLION NEW CASES OF DIABETES ARE DIAGNOSED IN PEOPLE AGE 20 YEARS AND OLDER. IN ILLINOIS, APPROXIMATELY 800,000 PEOPLE 18 YEARS OF AGE AND OLDER HAVE DIAGNOSED DIABETES, WITH ANOTHER 500,000 PEOPLE UNAWARE THEY HAVE THE DISEASE. INDIVIDUALS WITH DIABETES ARE AT INCREASED RISK FOR HEART DISEASE, BLINDNESS, KIDNEY FAILURE, AND LOWER EXTREMITY AMPUTATIONS (NOT RELATED TO INJURIES). DIABETES AND ITS COMPLICATIONS OCCUR AMONG ALL AGE, RACIAL AND ETHNIC GROUPS.TO ADDRESS DIABETES IN THE HIGH-RISK COMMUNITIES WITHIN ADVOCATE SOUTH SUBURBAN'S SERVICE AREA, A CENTERS FOR DISEASE CONTROL AND PREVENTION (CDC) EVIDENCE-BASED INTERVENTION NAMED THE NATIONAL DIABETES PREVENTION PROGRAM (DPP) WAS IMPLEMENTED. THE HOSPITAL IS SEEKING TO BECOME A CDC RECOGNIZED FACILITY TO IMPLEMENT THE DPP. THE HOSPITAL PARTNERED WITH LOCAL CHURCHES AND COMMUNITY PARTNERS TO HOST THE PROGRAM. THE PROGRAM IS DESIGNED TO EDUCATE INDIVIDUALS WHO HAVE BEEN DIAGNOSED WITH PRE-DIABETES TO PREVENT OR DELAY THE ONSET OF TYPE 2 DIABETES THROUGH EDUCATION, DIET AND EXERCISE. RESEARCH HAS SHOWN THAT A 5-7 PERCENT WEIGHT LOSS CAN PREVENT DEVELOPMENT OF TYPE 2 DIABETES.THE FOLLOWING OUTCOMES WERE ACHIEVED DURING 2018: STRATEGY 1: HIRE A LIFESTYLE COACH TO IMPLEMENT THE NATIONAL DIABETES PREVENTION PROGRAM (DPP), PREVENT T2, IN MARKHAM (60428) AND CHICAGO HEIGHTS (60411) IN COLLABORATION WITH COMMUNITY ORGANIZATIONS.- ADVOCATE SOUTH SUBURBAN PARTNERED WITH ABUNDANT LIVING CHRISTIAN CENTER IN DOLTON, ILLINOIS, TO HOST THE INAUGURAL SESSION IN 2017.

THERE ARE MANY SIGNIFICANT EFFORTS UNDERWAY IN THE COMMUNITY RELATED TO OBESITY THROUGH THE MCLEAN COUNTY WELLNESS COALITION. THE HEALTH DEPARTMENT AND BOTH HOSPITALS ARE A PART OF THE MCLEAN COUNTY WELLNESS COALITION AS ARE 28 OTHER COMMUNITY ORGANIZATIONS IN MCLEAN COUNTY. THE MCLEAN COUNTY WELLNESS COALITION IS THE PRIMARY GROUP WORKING ON THE INTERVENTIONS OUTLINED IN THE 2017-2019 MCLEAN COUNTY COMMUNITY HEALTH IMPROVEMENT PLAN. HIGHLIGHTS FOR STEPS TAKEN OR PROGRAMS OFFERED IN 2018 AS A PART OF THE 2017-2019 MCLEAN COUNTY COMMUNITY HEALTH IMPROVEMENT PLAN TO ADDRESS OBESITY ARE LISTED BELOW: - THE PARTNERSHIP FOR HEALTH PILOT PROGRAM BEGAN IN APRIL 2017. THE PROGRAM IS A PRIVATE-PUBLIC PARTNERSHIP TO IMPROVE THE HEALTH AND FITNESS OF PEOPLE WITH DEVELOPMENTAL AND INTELLECTUAL DISABILITIES AND THEIR SUPPORT WORKERS. PARTNERS INCLUDE ADVOCATE BROMENN HEALTH AND FITNESS CENTER, MARCFIRST, ADVOCATE BROMENN CHARITABLE FOUNDATION, THE MCLEAN COUNTY HEALTH DEPARTMENT AND THE MCLEAN COUNTY BOARD FOR THE CARE AND TREATMENT OF PERSONS WITH A DEVELOPMENTAL DISABILITY (377 BOARD). THE PROGRAM INITIALLY SERVED 22 INDIVIDUALS FROM MARCFIRST. IN 2018, THE PROGRAM WAS EXPANDED TO SEVERAL COMMUNITY MEMBERS WITH A TOTAL OF 31 INDIVIDUALS BEING SERVED. OUTCOMES FROM YEAR ONE OF THE PROGRAM ARE POSITIVE RANGING FROM DECREASED BLOOD PRESSURE AND CHOLESTEROL TO INCREASED STRENGTH, STAMINA AND ENDURANCE.- IN MAY 2017, ADVOCATE BROMENN PLANTED THE ADVOCATE BROMENN VEGETABLE GARDEN AND ORCHARD ON LAND OWNED BY THE HOSPITAL. THE COMMUNITY HEALTH CARE CLINIC IS LOCATED ON THIS LAND. ONE-HUNDRED POUNDS OF PRODUCE GROWN WAS DONATED TO PATIENTS OF THE CLINIC IN BOTH 2017 AND 2018. THE PURPOSE OF THE GARDEN IS TO INCREASE ACCESS TO HEALTHY FOODS FOR THE LOW-INCOME POPULATION IN MCLEAN COUNTY.- IN 2018, THE COMMUNITY HEALTH DIRECTOR FOR CENTRAL ILLINOIS ATTENDED THE FEEDING THE CITIES SUMMIT WHICH IS FOCUSING ON DECREASING FOOD INSECURITY AND INCREASING ACCESS TO HEALTHY FOOD FOR MCLEAN COUNTY RESIDENTS. - THE COMMUNITY HEALTH CARE CLINIC AND HOME SWEET HOME MINISTRIES LAUNCHED A FOOD FARMACY PILOT PROGRAM IN AUGUST 2017. THE PROGRAM PROVIDES A PRESCRIPTION PASS TO PATIENTS AT THE CLINIC WHO HAVE DIABETES OR HEART DISEASE. THE PASS CAN BE USED TO OBTAIN FREE FRESH PRODUCE AND OTHER FOOD FROM THE BREAD FOR LIFE CO-OP FOR 12 WEEKS. ADVOCATE BROMENN AND OSF HEALTHCARE ST. JOSEPH MEDICAL CENTER SUPPORT THE COMMUNITY HEALTH CARE CLINIC. FROM AUGUST 2017 UNTIL DECEMBER 2018, 51 PATIENTS OF THE COMMUNITY HEALTH CARE CLINIC TOOK ADVANTAGE OF THE 12-WEEK PRESCRIPTION PASS FOR A TOTAL OF 196 SHOPPING TRIPS. AS A DIRECT RESULT OF THIS PROGRAM, THERE WAS AN INCREASE IN THE NUMBER OF HISPANICS SHOPPING AT THE BREAD FOR LIFE CO-OP. ADDITIONAL INTERVENTIONS ARE LISTED IN THE 2017-2019 MCLEAN COUNTY COMMUNITY HEALTH IMPROVEMENT PLAN AT HTTP://WWW.ADVOCATEHEALTH.COM/CHNAREPORTS.HEALTH NEEDS NOT SELECTED BIRTH OUTCOMESBIRTH OUTCOMES WAS NOT SELECTED AS A HEALTH PRIORITY SINCE IT WAS RATED SIXTH ACCORDING TO ITS PRIORITY SCORE. ALTHOUGH THE SERIOUSNESS OF THE PROBLEM AND THE LONG-TERM CONSEQUENCES WERE TAKEN INTO CONSIDERATION BY THE MCLEAN COUNTY COMMUNITY HEALTH COUNCIL, IT WAS AGREED THAT THE THREE HEALTH ISSUES SELECTED WERE GREATER IN BOTH SIZE AND SERIOUSNESS IN MCLEAN COUNTY. THE COUNCIL ALSO FELT THAT THERE ARE SEVERAL POSITIVE EFFORTS CURRENTLY UNDERWAY TO IMPROVE BIRTH OUTCOMES. FOR EXAMPLE, THERE IS A NO ELECTIVE INDUCTIONS LESS THAN 39 WEEKS INITIATIVE WITH THE MARCH OF DIMES AND BOTH HOSPITALS. ADDITIONALLY, ON OCTOBER 18, 2016, ADVOCATE BROMENN BEGAN PROVIDING NEONATOLOGY SERVICES IN PARTNERSHIP WITH ADVOCATE CHILDREN'S HOSPITAL. THIS IS A NEW SERVICE FOR THE MCLEAN COUNTY COMMUNITY. COVERAGE IS BEING PROVIDED BY THE NEONATOLOGISTS FROM ADVOCATE CHILDREN'S HOSPITAL. AS AN INTERMEDIATE CARE NURSERY WITH THIS ENHANCED LEVEL OF PHYSICIAN COVERAGE, THE HOSPITAL CAN KEEP BABIES AS YOUNG AS 32 WEEKS GESTATION. THIS ALLOWS NEW MOMS AND BABIES TO STAY TOGETHER, PROVIDING EXCELLENT OUTCOMES FOR FAMILIES.IN ADDITION, THE MCLEAN COUNTY HEALTH DEPARTMENT HAS THREE PROGRAMS AVAILABLE WHICH PROMOTE HEALTHY PREGNANCIES AND CONNECT PREGNANT WOMEN TO HEALTH AND WELLNESS SERVICES: ALL OUR KIDS EARLY CHILDHOOD NETWORK, FAMILY CASE MANAGEMENT, AND WOMEN, INFANTS AND CHILDREN. ORAL HEALTHTHERE WAS SOME DISCUSSION IN THE PRIORITIZATION MEETING ABOUT SELECTING ORAL HEALTH AS ONE OF THE THREE HEALTH PRIORITIES IN PLACE OF ONE OF THE THREE HIGHEST PRIORITY SCORING HEALTH CONCERNS. ORAL HEALTH RANKED CLOSELY BEHIND OBESITY (153.8) WITH A PRIORITY SCORE OF 148.4. ALTHOUGH ORAL HEALTH IS DEEMED AS AN EXTREMELY IMPORTANT ISSUE IN MCLEAN COUNTY, THE MCLEAN COUNTY COMMUNITY HEALTH COUNCIL AGREED TO PROCEED WITH THE THREE ISSUES THAT RECEIVED THE HIGHEST PRIORITY SCORES. THIS IS PARTIALLY DUE TO THE EFFORTS CURRENTLY IN PLACE TO ASSIST INDIVIDUALS WITHOUT DENTAL INSURANCE OR MEDICAID TO RECEIVE CARE. SOME EXAMPLES OF STEPS TAKEN TO ADDRESS ORAL HEALTH INCLUDE THE FOLLOWING. ADVOCATE BROMENN'S PRESIDENT AND/OR THE DIRECTOR OF COMMUNITY HEALTH ATTENDED SEVERAL ORAL HEALTH COLLABORATIVE MEETINGS WITH THE MCLEAN COUNTY PUBLIC HEALTH DEPARTMENT, OSF HEALTHCARE ST. JOSEPH MEDICAL CENTER, THE COMMUNITY HEALTH CARE CLINIC AND CHESTNUT HEALTH SYSTEMS TO DISCUSS THE ISSUE OF ACCESS TO DENTAL CARE FOR UNINSURED ADULTS IN MCLEAN COUNTY. FURTHERMORE, AN ADVOCATE MEDICAL GROUP PEDIATRICIAN'S OFFICE LOCATED IN NORMAL, ILLINOIS, HAS ALSO BEEN PARTICIPATING FOR SEVERAL YEARS IN THE BRIGHT SMILES FROM BIRTH PROGRAM THROUGH THE ILLINOIS CHAPTER OF THE AMERICAN ACADEMY OF PEDIATRICS AND THE ADVOCATE BROMENN FAMILY HEALTH CARE CLINIC BEGAN THE PROGRAM IN 2017. AFTER COMPLETING A COURSE, THE OFFICE CAN BILL MEDICAID FOR THE APPLICATION OF FLUORIDE VARNISH ON FULLY ERUPTED TEETH OF CHILDREN UNDER THREE YEARS OF AGE. EACH APPLICATION CAN BE DONE THREE TIMES PER YEAR. THE FLUORIDE SERVES TO PROTECT THE BABY TEETH RESULTING IN FEWER CAVITIES. THE MCLEAN COUNTY HEALTH DEPARTMENT ALSO PROVIDES A DENTAL CLINIC WITH INTERVENTION CARE FOR ADULTS (NO PREGNANT WOMEN), AND PREVENTIVE CARE AND INTERVENTION FOR KIDS. HEARTLAND HEAD START COORDINATES REFERRALS TO DENTAL CARE FOR KIDS SIX WEEKS TO FIVE YEARS AS WELL AS PREGNANT WOMEN. EXTRACTION CLINICS ARE HELD TWICE PER YEAR AT A LOCAL ORAL SURGEON'S OFFICE. RESPIRATORY DISEASEONE OF THE REASONS RESPIRATORY DISEASE WAS NOT SELECTED AS ONE OF THE TOP THREE HEALTH PRIORITIES FOR MCLEAN COUNTY WAS THAT IT RANKED FIFTH ACCORDING TO ITS PRIORITY SCORE OF 121 AND THE MCLEAN COUNTY COMMUNITY HEALTH COUNCIL DID NOT FEEL THAT THERE WAS A COMPELLING REASON TO ELIMINATE ONE OF THE HEALTH CONCERNS THAT RANKED IN THE TOP THREE. THE COUNCIL DID DISCUSS THAT IMPROVING ACCESS TO APPROPRIATE HEALTHCARE MAY POSSIBLY ALSO IMPROVE HEALTH OUTCOMES FOR RESPIRATORY DISEASE, PARTICULARLY IN AREAS OF HIGH SOCIOECONOMIC NEEDS."

201943199349321899,362169147,"ADVOCATE GOOD SHEPHERD HOSPITAL: PART V, SECTION B, LINE 11 - CONTINUED","IN 2018, ADVOCATE GOOD SHEPHERD HOSTED FOUR YOUTH MENTAL HEALTH FIRST AID TRAININGS-CASA (COURT APPOINTED SPECIAL ADVOCATE) OF MCHENRY COUNTY, WAUCONDA HIGH SCHOOL ADMINISTRATORS AND FACULTY, BE STRONG BARRINGTON BOARD MEMBERS AND A COMMUNITY TRAINING OPEN TO ANY INDIVIDUAL WHO WORKS WITH YOUTH. FROM THE ADVOCATE GOOD SHEPHERD SERVICE AREA, 78 INDIVIDUALS IN YOUTH SERVICES COMPLETED THE TRAINING. POST-SURVEY RESULTS SHOWED ONE-HUNDRED PERCENT OF PARTICIPANTS HAD AN INCREASED KNOWLEDGE OF DE-ESCALATION TECHNIQUES AND WERE MORE CONFIDENT ABOUT RECOGNIZING AND CORRECTING MISCONCEPTIONS ABOUT MENTAL HEALTH AND MENTAL ILLNESSES. COMMUNITY HEALTH STAFF HAVE FOUND THAT IT IS EXTREMELY DIFFICULT FOR HOSPITAL CLINICAL STAFF TO ATTEND THE EIGHT-HOUR MENTAL HEALTH FIRST AID TRAINING. CLINICAL STAFF HAVE A NUMBER OF REQUIRED TRAININGS TO COMPLETE EACH YEAR TO MAINTAIN LICENSURE, AND THEY RARELY HAVE EXTRA DAYS AVAILABLE TO ATTEND NON-CLINICAL TRAINING. BECAUSE OF THIS, COMMUNITY HEALTH STAFF HAVE SHIFTED TO PRIMARILY TARGET COMMUNITY RESIDENTS WHO WORK WITH YOUTH TO ATTEND THE MENTAL HEALTH FIRST AID TRAINING. IN 2018, COMMUNITY HEALTH STAFF ALSO COLLABORATED WITH THE MCHENRY COUNTY MENTAL HEALTH BOARD, NAMI (NATIONAL ALLIANCE ON MENTAL ILLNESS) OF MCHENRY COUNTY AND CRYSTAL LAKE SCHOOL DISTRICT 47 TO HOLD A YOUTH MENTAL HEALTH FIRST AID MASTER INSTRUCTOR TRAINING FOR ALL SCHOOL DISTRICTS IN MCHENRY COUNTY. EACH SCHOOL DISTRICT WILL SEND TWO REPRESENTATIVES TO BECOME MASTER INSTRUCTORS, WHO WILL THEN HOLD YOUTH MENTAL HEALTH FIRST AID TRAINING AT THEIR SCHOOL DISTRICT. THE MASTER TRAINING SESSION IS PLANNED TO TAKE PLACE IN 2019. ALSO IN 2018, THROUGH COLLABORATION WITH ADVOCATE CONDELL, THE HOSPITAL SPONSORED TWO INDIVIDUALS WHO ARE CERTIFIED IN ADULT MENTAL HEALTH FIRST AID TO RECEIVE THE YOUTH MENTAL HEALTH FIRST AID CERTIFICATION. THE TWO INSTRUCTORS ARE SPANISH-SPEAKING AND WILL HOLD TRAINING SESSIONS IN LAKE AND MCHENRY COUNTIES IN SPANISH, WHICH IS A NEED IN BOTH COUNTIES.THE SECOND STRATEGY TO ADDRESS MENTAL HEALTH IS TO INCREASE THE NUMBER OF ADULTS WHO ARE SCREENED FOR DEPRESSION AND, IF POSITIVE, REFERRED TO SUPPORTIVE SERVICES BY HEALTH CARE PROFESSIONALS. COLLABORATIVE CARE FOR THE MANAGEMENT OF DEPRESSIVE DISORDERS IS A MULTICOMPONENT, HEALTHCARE SYSTEM-LEVEL INTERVENTION THAT USES CASE MANAGERS TO LINK PRIMARY CARE PROVIDERS, PATIENTS AND MENTAL HEALTH SPECIALISTS. THIS COLLABORATION IS DESIGNED TO IMPROVE THE ROUTINE SCREENING AND DIAGNOSIS OF DEPRESSIVE DISORDERS, INCREASE PROVIDER USES OF EVIDENCE-BASED PROTOCOLS FOR THE PROACTIVE MANAGEMENT OF DIAGNOSED DEPRESSIVE DISORDERS, AND IMPROVE CLINICAL AND COMMUNITY SUPPORT FOR ACTIVE PATIENT ENGAGEMENT IN TREATMENT GOAL SETTING AND SELF-MANAGEMENT. ADVOCATE GOOD SHEPHERD IS SCREENING HOSPITAL PATIENTS AGE 65 AND OLDER, OBSTETRIC PATIENTS AND CARDIOLOGY PATIENTS. HOSPITAL HEALTH CARE PROFESSIONALS REFER INDIVIDUALS WHO SCREEN POSITIVE TO COMMUNITY AND MENTAL HEALTH SUPPORT SERVICES. IN 2018, ADVOCATE GOOD SHEPHERD CONTINUED TO STRENGTHEN RELATIONSHIPS WITH THE LAKE COUNTY HEALTH DEPARTMENT AND THE MCHENRY COUNTY MENTAL HEALTH BOARD WITH THE GOAL OF IMPROVING THE REFERRAL PROCESS. COMMUNITY HEALTH STAFF COMPLETED VERIFICATION THAT DEPRESSION SCREENINGS USING THE PHQ-9 SCREENING TOOL ARE OCCURRING AT ADVOCATE GOOD SHEPHERD. REFERRALS TO MENTAL HEALTH PROVIDERS ARE BEING COMPLETED BY PHYSICIANS. HOWEVER, CURRENTLY THERE IS NO AGGREGATE DATA REPORT AVAILABLE OF PATIENTS WHO HAVE COMPLETED DEPRESSION SCREENING. THE DATA IS ONLY AVAILABLE WITHIN THE PATIENT REGISTRY. COMMUNITY HEALTH STAFF CONSULTED WITH THE ADVOCATE BEHAVIORAL HEALTH SERVICE LINE TO DETERMINE IF AGGREGATE DATA CAN BE GENERATED FROM THE REGISTRY DATA, AND NO SUCH REPORT CAN BE DEVELOPED. IN 2018, COMMUNITY HEALTH STAFF ALSO BEGAN EXPLORING A NEW PARTNERSHIP WITH THE HARVARD SENIOR CENTER AND THE PEARLS PROGRAM. THE PROGRAM TO ENCOURAGE ACTIVE, REWARDING LIVES (PEARLS) IS A NATIONAL EVIDENCE-BASED PROGRAM FOR LATE-LIFE DEPRESSION. PEARLS BRINGS HIGH QUALITY MENTAL HEALTH CARE INTO COMMUNITY-BASED SETTINGS THAT REACH VULNERABLE OLDER ADULTS. ADVOCATE GOOD SHEPHERD AND THE HARVARD SENIOR CENTER WILL COLLABORATE TO HOLD A TWO-DAY PEARLS PROGRAM MASTER TRAINING FOR PROFESSIONALS WHO WORK WITH THE SENIOR POPULATION. THE PEARLS PROGRAM WILL REPLACE THE COLLABORATIVE CARE FOR THE MANAGEMENT OF DEPRESSIVE DISORDERS INTERVENTION.COMMUNITY HEALTH STAFF EXAMINED THE RATES OF DEPRESSION FOR MEDICARE BENEFICIARIES AND THE HOSPITALIZATION RATES FOR SUICIDE AND SELF-INJURY IN THE ADVOCATE GOOD SHEPHERD SERVICE AREA AND DISCOVERED BOTH RATES WERE HIGH. DUE TO THIS, THE HOSPITAL ARRANGED TWO ONE-HOUR QUESTION, PERSUADE AND REFER (QPR) AND STRESS MANAGEMENT TRAININGS FOR THE WAUCONDA TOWNSHIP CENTER AND THE SENIOR BREAKFAST CLUB AT ADVOCATE GOOD SHEPHERD. QPR IS AN EVIDENCE-BASED SUICIDE PREVENTION TRAINING DESIGNED TO EMPOWER A PERSON WITH THE TOOLS TO IDENTIFY IF SOMEONE IS SUICIDAL AND REFER THEM TO PROFESSIONAL RESOURCES. A TOTAL OF 49 PEOPLE ATTENDED THE QPR SESSIONS. THE THIRD STRATEGY TO ADDRESS MENTAL HEALTH IS TO STRENGTHEN ADVOCATE GOOD SHEPHERD'S LINKAGES TO COMMUNITY MENTAL HEALTH AGENCIES WITHIN THE SERVICE AREA. ON MAY 12, 2018, THE HOSPITAL SPONSORED A MENTAL HEALTH RESOURCE FAIR TO INTRODUCE COMMUNITY MENTAL HEALTH AGENCIES AND PROVIDERS TO ADVOCATE GOOD SHEPHERD STAFF (PROVIDERS, NURSES, SOCIAL WORKERS, CARE MANAGERS). RESOURCE FAIR ATTENDEES LEARNED ABOUT SERVICES PROVIDED AND INSURANCE COVERAGE ACCEPTED BY THE MENTAL HEALTH AGENCIES TO INCREASE THE KNOWLEDGE THAT ADVOCATE GOOD SHEPHERD STAFF HAVE ABOUT MENTAL HEALTH RESOURCES AVAILABLE FOR HOSPITAL PATIENTS. THE RESOURCE FAIR WAS HELD JOINTLY WITH ADVOCATE CONDELL. A TOTAL OF 13 PEOPLE ATTENDED THE RESOURCE FAIR. BASED ON PRE-TEST AND POST-TEST RESULTS THERE WAS A FORTY-SIX PERCENT INCREASE OF KNOWLEDGE OF RESOURCES IN THE COMMUNITY FOR ATTENDEES. LOW ATTENDANCE WAS LIKELY DUE TO THE FACT THAT IT WAS HELD ON A SATURDAY, WHEN STAFFING LEVELS ARE LOWER AT THE HOSPITAL. ADDITIONALLY, RESOURCE FAIRS OVERALL ARE GARNERING MUCH LOWER ATTENDANCE THAN IN PREVIOUS YEARS DUE TO THE EASE AND AVAILABILITY OF INFORMATION NOW BEING AVAILABLE ONLINE. TO ADDRESS THE MENTAL HEALTH NEEDS OF THE BARRINGTON AREA, IN 2017-2018, ADVOCATE GOOD SHEPHERD ALSO OVERSAW THE DEVELOPMENT AND LAUNCH OF A MENTAL HEALTH RESOURCE WEBSITE NAMED HEALTHY BARRINGTON. HTTPS://HEALTHYBARRINGTON.ORG/LOCAL-MENTAL-HEALTH-PROVIDERS/COMMUNITY HEALTH STAFF PARTNERED WITH BARRINGTON YOUTH AND FAMILY SERVICES TO APPLY FOR A $15,000 GRANT FROM THE BARRINGTON AREA COMMUNITY FOUNDATION TO PARTIALLY FUND THE WEBSITE DEVELOPMENT. ADVOCATE GOOD SHEPHERD FUNDED THE REMAINING COST. COMMUNITY HEALTH STAFF WORKED FOR SEVERAL MONTHS WITH A CONTRACTED WEBSITE DEVELOPER AND A SUBCOMMITTEE OF THE HEALTHIER BARRINGTON COALITION TO DEVELOP THE WEBSITE, WHICH PROVIDES A WIDE ARRAY OF RESOURCES TO BARRINGTON AREA RESIDENTS, INCLUDING MENTAL HEALTH COUNSELING, SUBSTANCE USE TREATMENT AND OTHER SUPPORTIVE SERVICES WITHIN THE GREATER CHICAGOLAND AREA. THE WEBSITE OFFICIALLY LAUNCHED IN AUGUST 2018.MENTAL HEALTH AND SUBSTANCE USE ARE COMMON CO-OCCURRING CONDITIONS. THOUGH NOT SPECIFICALLY SELECTED AS A PRIORITY, THE HOSPITAL SAW THE NEED TO IMPLEMENT A PROGRAM TO SPECIFICALLY ADDRESS COMMUNITY RESIDENTS STRUGGLING WITH OPIOID USE DISORDER. FOR THE ADVOCATE GOOD SHEPHERD PSA, THE AGE-ADJUSTED ER RATE DUE TO SUBSTANCE ABUSE CONSISTENTLY CLIMBED FROM 10 ED VISITS PER 10,000 POPULATION IN 2010-2012, TO 12 ED VISITS PER 10,000 POPULATION IN 2012-2014. IN 2018, ADVOCATE GOOD SHEPHERD ENTERED INTO AN AGREEMENT WITH GATEWAY FOUNDATION ALCOHOL AND DRUG TREATMENT, A NON-PROFIT ORGANIZATION WITH TREATMENT CENTERS LOCATED THROUGHOUT ILLINOIS, TO SPECIFICALLY ADDRESS THE OPIOID CRISIS IN LAKE COUNTY AND MCHENRY COUNTY. IN COORDINATION WITH HOSPITAL EMERGENCY DEPARTMENT (ED) STAFF, GATEWAY FOUNDATION HAS PLACED A FULL-TIME CREDENTIALED ENGAGEMENT SPECIALIST WITHIN THE ADVOCATE GOOD SHEPHERD ED TO WORK WITH PATIENTS PRESENTING WITH A MEDICAL ISSUE RELATED TO OPIOID USE DISORDER. THE GATEWAY ENGAGEMENT SPECIALIST WORKS CLOSELY WITH ED SOCIAL WORKERS AND CARE MANAGERS TO COMPLETE A CLINICAL ASSESSMENT AND CONTINUING CARE PLAN WITH THE PATIENT. THE GOAL IS TO COORDINATE A DIRECT TRANSFER OR REFERRAL INTO SUBSTANCE USE TREATMENT FOR PATIENTS COMING INTO THE ED FOR OPIOIDS. GATEWAY FOUNDATION ALSO EMPLOYS A RECOVERY COACH TO PROVIDE SUPPORT AND COMMUNITY OUTREACH TO INDIVIDUALS SEEKING TREATMENT OR IN RECOVERY. THE PROGRAM LAUNCHED IN JANUARY 2018 AND 59 PATIENTS WERE SEEN BY THE ENGAGEMENT SPECIALIST IN 2018. THIRTY-FIVE PATIENTS (FIFTY-NINE PERCENT) WERE REFERRED FOR SUBSTANCE USE TREATMENT, AND OF THESE, 12 PATIENTS (THIRTY-FOUR PERCENT) KEPT THE APPOINTMENT WITH THE TREATMENT FACILITY."

DIABETES PREVALENCE IS INCREASING OVER TIME IN THE NATION AND LOCALLY. EMERGENCY ROOM AND HOSPITALIZATION RATES FOR DIABETES HAVE ALSO CONTINUED TO INCREASE OVER TIME. THOUGH A SIGNIFICANT NEED, THE COMMUNITY HEALTH COUNCIL MADE THE DECISION TO FOCUS ON OBESITY AS A PRIORITY, GIVEN ITS IMPACT ON THE RISK FOR PRE-DIABETES AND DIABETES. ADVOCATE GOOD SHEPHERD HAS A DIABETES ADVISORY COMMITTEE THAT IS COMMITTED TO DIABETES PREVENTION AND TREATMENT IN THE COMMUNITY THROUGH EDUCATION, PROGRAMMING AND SCREENINGS. CARDIOVASCULAR DISEASEIN MCHENRY COUNTY, THERE HAS BEEN A DECLINE IN MORTALITY RATES FOR HEART DISEASE AND STROKE. OVER THE PAST DECADE, MCHENRY COUNTY'S HEART DISEASE DEATH RATE HAS DROPPED BY NINETEEN PERCENT, WHILE THE STROKE DEATH RATE HAS FALLEN BY TWENTY-FIVE PERCENT. THE MOST RECENT DEATH RATE DATA FOR STROKE AND HEART DISEASE SHOWS THIS CONTINUING DOWNWARD TREND. THE PREVALENCE RATE OF HEART DISEASE IS SLIGHTLY HIGHER IN MCHENRY COUNTY THAN LAKE COUNTY; HOWEVER, THE MORTALITY RATE FROM HEART DISEASE IS HIGHER IN LAKE COUNTY THAN MCHENRY COUNTY. THE COMMUNITY HEALTH COUNCIL DECIDED IT WAS MORE BENEFICIAL TO PRIORITIZE OBESITY BECAUSE OF ITS IMPACT ON THE RISK FACTORS FOR HEART DISEASE. THE HOSPITAL IS COMMITTED TO DECREASING THE RATE OF HEART DISEASE THROUGH MANY OF THE ADVOCATE HEART INSTITUTE PROGRAMS. THE HOSPITAL CONTINUES TO BE A MEMBER OF THE CARDIOVASCULAR MAPP (MOBILIZING FOR ACTION THROUGH PLANNING AND PARTNERSHIPS) ACTION TEAM IN MCHENRY COUNTY AND PARTNERS WITH THE MCHENRY COUNTY HEALTH DEPARTMENT TO ADMINISTER THE HEART AGE SCREENING TOOL THROUGHOUT THE COMMUNITY.SUBSTANCE ABUSESUBSTANCE ABUSE WAS IDENTIFIED AS A NEED WITHIN THE ADVOCATE GOOD SHEPHERD SERVICE AREA. CONTRIBUTING HEALTH BEHAVIORS IDENTIFIED INCLUDED EXCESSIVE ALCOHOL USE IN ADULTS AND THE PERCENTAGE OF TEENS USING MARIJUANA. THOSE WHO ARE MENTALLY ILL ARE MORE LIKELY TO ABUSE DRUGS OR ALCOHOL. ACCORDING TO THE SUBSTANCE ABUSE AND MENTAL HEALTH SERVICES ADMINISTRATION (SAMHSA), TWENTY-SEVEN PERCENT OF PEOPLE WITH MENTAL HEALTH ISSUES ABUSED ILLICIT DRUGS IN 2012. BECAUSE OF THE UNDERLYING MENTAL HEALTH ISSUES AFFECTING THE USE OF SUBSTANCES, THE COMMUNITY HEALTH COUNCIL DECIDED TO SELECT MENTAL HEALTH AS THE PRIORITY. ADVOCATE GOOD SHEPHERD COMMUNITY HEALTH STAFF ARE ACTIVE MEMBERS OF THE MCHENRY COUNTY SUBSTANCE ABUSE COALITION AND THE LAKE COUNTY OPIOID INITIATIVE."

POST-INCARCERATION SUPPORT FOR THOSE WITH A MENTAL ILLNESS WAS IDENTIFIED AS A SERIOUS HEALTH NEED IN THE COMMUNITY. A POST-INCARCERATION SUB-GROUP, WHICH THE HOSPITAL WAS ENGAGED IN, WAS FORMED AND MET IN NOVEMBER OF 2017. THE SUB-GROUP FOCUSED ON ADDRESSING POST-INCARCERATION SUPPORT FOR THE MENTALLY ILL AND BRAINSTORMED WAYS TO ADDRESS THE NEED.

THE HOSPITAL'S DETOX CENTER SERVES PATIENTS WITH ADDICTION ISSUES AND PROVIDES A SAFE ENVIRONMENT FOR SUBSTANCE ABUSE WITHDRAWAL. IN ADDITION, THE HOSPITAL RECEIVED A GRANT TO IMPLEMENT A LINKAGE TO CARE PROGRAM, WHICH EMPLOYS A COMMUNITY LINKAGE SPECIALIST TO LINK DISCHARGED DETOX UNIT PATIENTS TO COMMUNITY SUPPORT SERVICES AND TO FOLLOW-UP WITH PATIENTS AT 30, 60, 90 AND 180 DAYS POST-DISCHARGE TO CHECK-IN ON PROGRESS AND PROVIDE ADDITIONAL SUPPORT IF NEEDED. THE HOSPITAL ALSO PROVIDES RESOURCES FOR COMMUNITY PARTNERS SUCH AS ALCOHOLICS ANONYMOUS (AA) AND NARCOTICS ANONYMOUS (NA). BOTH AA AND NA SUPPORT GROUPS HOLD REGULAR MEETINGS AT ADVOCATE GOOD SAMARITAN.ASTHMAASTHMA WAS IDENTIFIED AS A HEALTH NEED IN THE 2014-2016 CHNA BUT WAS NOT SELECTED AS A PRIORITY TO ADDRESS DUE TO THE LACK OF COMMUNITY PARTNERS AND THE AVAILABILITY OF ASTHMA PREVENTION PROGRAMS. THE MAJORITY OF ASTHMA PROGRAMS WITHIN THE COUNTY ARE FOCUSED ON ASTHMA ATTACK PREVENTION AND TREATMENT. THE CHC ALSO IDENTIFIED HOSPITALIZATION AND ED VISIT RATES DUE TO ASTHMA AS A POTENTIAL ACCESS TO HEALTH CARE ISSUE. TAKING THIS INTO CONSIDERATION, THE COMMUNITY HEALTH MANAGER ALONG WITH THE CHC IDENTIFIED SEVERAL HOSPITAL PROGRAMS THAT ADDRESSED ACCESS TO HEALTH CARE, INCLUDING SUPPORT SERVICES FOR ED OVERUTILIZATION DUE TO LACK OF PRIMARY CARE FOR CHRONIC CONDITIONS LIKE ASTHMA. THROUGH HOSPITAL PARTNERSHIPS, SUCH AS ADVOCATE GOOD SAMARITAN'S PARTNERSHIP WITH ENGAGE DUPAGE, ASTHMATIC PATIENTS WHO ARE IN NEED OF PRIMARY CARE WILL RECEIVE SUPPORT FROM PROGRAM STAFF THAT PROVIDE LINKAGES TO PRIMARY CARE AND INSURANCE COVERAGE.ACCESS TO HEALTH CARE SERVICESTHE CHC ACKNOWLEDGES ACCESS TO HEALTH CARE SERVICES AS A CRITICAL NEED FOR THE HOSPITAL'S PSA. THIS NEED WAS NOT PRIORITIZED DUE TO SEVERAL PROGRAMS AND PARTNERSHIPS THAT ARE CURRENTLY BEING IMPLEMENTED TO ADDRESS ACCESS TO HEALTH CARE IN THE HOSPITAL SERVICE AREA. THE HOSPITAL HAS A FINANCIALLY SIGNIFICANT LONG STANDING PARTNERSHIP WITH DUPAGE HEALTH COALITION (FORMERLY KNOWN AS ACCESS DUPAGE), WHICH WORKS WITH UNINSURED AND UNDERINSURED PATIENTS TO CONNECT THEM TO HEALTH CARE COVERAGE AND PRIMARY CARE SERVICES. THE HOSPITAL SERVES MANY DUPAGE HEALTH COALITION/ACCESS DUPAGE CLIENTS AND WILL CONTINUE TO WORK WITH THE ORGANIZATION TO LINK VULNERABLE POPULATIONS TO EFFECTIVE HEALTH CARE COVERAGE AND SERVICES. IN 2018, ADVOCATE GOOD SAMARITAN CONTRIBUTED $414,884 DIRECTLY TO DUPAGE HEALTH COALITION TO SERVE PATIENT NEEDS.

THE COMMUNITY HEALTH MANAGER WILL CONTINUE TO TRACK PROGRESS OF BOTH PROGRAMS AND REPORT PROGRAM OUTCOMES TO THE CHC.CANCERCANCER WAS IDENTIFIED AS A HEALTH NEED FOR THE HOSPITAL'S PRIMARY SERVICE AREA DUE TO HIGH INCIDENCE AND PREVALENCE RATES OF THE DISEASE. THE CHC DID NOT SELECT THIS NEED AS A PRIORITY DUE TO THE MYRIAD OF CANCER SERVICES AND SUPPORT GROUPS THE HOSPITAL CURRENTLY OFFERS TO PATIENTS WITHIN THE PSA. AN ARRAY OF CANCER TREATMENTS AND SUPPORT SERVICES ARE OFFERED THROUGH THE HOSPITAL'S BHORADE CANCER CENTER. THE CANCER CENTER STAFF ALSO CONDUCT A COMMUNITY NEEDS ASSESSMENT, WHICH INCLUDES COLLECTION AND ANALYSIS OF DEMOGRAPHIC AND CANCER DATA FOR THE HOSPITAL'S PSA.

A wide range of stakeholders took part in the 2019 CHNA process, including local and regional public health and health departments, other local municipal agencies, diverse community-based organizations, advocacy organizations, healthcare providers, and community residents. These stakeholders provided input through a CHNA Regional Advisory Council (RAC), focus groups, key informant interviews, community conversations, and community chats. Additionally, community forums were conducted towards the end of the CHNA process to vet preliminary findings with community members. Please refer to the hospitals' CHNA Appendix I for a complete listing of public health, community representatives, and other stakeholders included in the process.The CHNA RAC included representatives from each Coalition member hospital/insurer as well as public health and community stakeholders from each hospital service area. Stakeholders on the RAC included local and regional public health and health department representatives; representatives from local and regional organizations serving or representing medically underserved, low-income or populations of color; and individuals from organizations that represent the broad interests of the community. The Coalition conducted a stakeholder analysis to ensure geographic, sector (e.g. schools, community service organizations, healthcare providers, public health, and housing), and racial/ethnic diversity of RAC. The RAC met in workgroups (Data and Reports, Engagement and Dissemination, and Health Equity) to guide the consultants in the process of conducting the CHNA, and priortizing community health needs, CHNA findings, and dissemination of information. Assessment methods and findings were modified based on the RAC's feedback. The RAC consisted of 31 participants, including Coalition members and consultants. The RAC met monthly from September 2018 through June 2019.Key informant interviews and focus groups were conducted to gather information used to identify priority health needs and engage the community. Key informant interviews were conducted with health care providers, health care administrators, local and regional public health officials, and local leaders that represent the interests of the community or that serve medically underserved, low-income, or populations of color in the service area. Interviews with local and regional public health officials identified priority health areas and community factors that contribute to health needs. Focus group participants included community organization representatives, community members (low-income, people of color, and others), and other community stakeholders. Topics and populations included: substance use, transgender health, older adults, youth, mental health, cancer care, gun violence, and rural food access. Key informant interviews and focus groups were conducted from February 2019 through March 2109. Focus groups and key informant interviews engaged residents primarily in Hampden County, but also across the region.The CHNA also used qualitative data from other hospital service areas as appropriate. Baystate Health held five Community Conversations and over 70 Community Chats. Community Conversations were larger bidirectional information-sharing meetings conducted for each Baystate Hospital service area and one done in Spanish in Springfield. For Community Chats, RAC members brought information about the CHNA and gathered priorities in regular meetings of service providers, community-based organizations, and hospital clinical staff and administrators. While these outreach efforts were spearheaded by Baystate Health, the engagement and findings benefitted all Coalition member hospitals/insurer. Conversations and Chats were held from January 2019 through April 2019 and engaged approximately 900 residents.Five Community Forums were held upon completion of this report to share and validate the findings. Two were offered in Spanish with approximately 100 individuals representing the broad interests of the community; participants in the focus groups, interviews, Conversations and Chats; and community stakeholders representing medically underserved, low-income, and populations of color."

202022269349301522,042790311,"Baystate Medical Center, Inc.","Part V, Section B, Line 11: The hospital facility anticipates health needs and available resources may change, therefore, a flexible approach was adopted in the development of its implementation strategy. For example, certain community health needs may become more pronounced and require changes to the initiatives identified by the hospital in the Strategy. Other community organizations may address certain needs, indicating that the hospital's strategies should be refocused on alternative community health needs or assume a different focus on the needs identified in the 2019 CHNA.The hospital facility views a community benefits implementation strategy as a ""LIVING"" document. Baystate hospitals have adopted the term Strategic Implementation Plan (SIP), in lieu of Implementation Strategy. The significant health needs to be addressed by the hospital are referred to as priority focus areas in the SIP. Due to the evolving climate in health care, the hospital's financial health year to year remains unknown; therefore hospital resources and inputs may increase, decrease, or need to be modified. The hospital's SIP work plan provides an opportunity for the hospital to be strategic and focused, yet flexible in its community health planning and improvement efforts. The hospital facility, in partnership with its Community Benefits Advisory Council reviews the work plans quarterly and the hospital updates the work plans on the hospital website annually.No health care system or hospital facility can address all the significant health needs present in its community. The hospital facility is committed to adhering to its mission and remaining financially healthy so that it can continue to enhance its clinical excellence and patient experience, as well as address significant health needs identified in the CHNA. The hospital facility's implementation strategy does not explicitly address all the priority community health needs identified in the 2019 CHNA due to; 1. limited resources (time, talent and treasure), 2. the hospital is a stakeholder and/or partner in addressing the directly or indirectly through other hospital clinical and service lines and community partnerships, 3. other hospitals or community organizations within the service area are addressing the need, 4. the need falls outside of the hospitals' mission or limited resource capacity. Significant health needs, referred to by the hospital as priority focus areas, being addressed by the hospital include, education, mental health and substance use, violence and trauma, financial wellbeing, and built environment. Significant health needs not to be addressed include, environmental exposures, housing, social environment, basic needs, care coordination, culturally sensitive care, health literacy and language barriers, insurance and healthcare care related challenges. limited providers, Alzheimer's disease, chronic diseases, infant and perinatal health, and sexual health."

202022389349300047,410682405,Betty Ford Center,"Part V, Section B, Line 11: Since Betty Ford Center provides substance use treatment and provision of mental health services and is not a general hospital providing primary care or preventative care, the health needs identified through this CHNA are more focused on behavioral health than in most hospitals' CHNAs.This is not to suggest that other health needs in the community do not exist; especially prevalent issues include the following: disability, major disease, obesity, prevention of sexually transmitted diseases/infection and sleep deprivation.As a drug and alcohol rehabilitation facility, Betty Ford Center's mission and purpose is focused around substance abuse treatment, not general physical health. Thus, there is a relative lack of expertise to address needs like arthritis, obesity, and STDs. Other organizations in the region-such as the three hospitals in the community, the federally-qualified health centers (FQHCs), etc.-are much better suited to tackle these issues, and many have strong existing programs designed to address these needs.Instead, Betty Ford Center will focus considerable resources and expertise on the local needs relating to behavioral health; specifically:access to care for low-income and/or uninsured, mental health care and substance abuse treatment.The identified need of access to care will be met through three strategies:-Financial assistance for the uninsured, under-insured, and/or low-income community -In 2019, $5.4M in financial assistance was awarded to 1,697 patients an increase of $2M and 661 patients from 2018.-Contribute to local efforts to ""grow our own"" behavioral health workforce locally, thereby increasing the number of providers available -In 2019, staff members met with OneFuture Coachella Valley representatives and connected them with the Hazelden Betty Ford Foundation Children's Program. The Director of Operations for the Children's Program attended meetings with OneFuture Coachella Valley to discuss ways to improve resources and services in the community. -Make Betty Ford Center more physically accessible to people with mobility issues. -In 2019, ADA adjustments were made to the bathrooms, wardrobes and doors and a lift was added to the pool.The identified need of mental health care will be met through four strategies:-Provide Betty Ford Center patients with a multi-disciplinary treatment team that is competent with both substance use and mental health treatment -In 2019, Model of Care training and Motivational Interviewing training was provided to staff. On-call coverage was provided for mental health with psychiatry when needed on the weekends and one psychologist was on site and available on Sundays for mental health issues.-Hire new staff that will enhance Betty Ford Center's mental health competencies -In 2019, both a psychologist and mental health provider were hired.-Contribute to local efforts to ""grow our own"" behavioral health workforce locally, thereby increasing the number of providers available -In 2019, discussions were had about utilitizing a portion of the Gerald Ford training fund to offer additional staff training.-Provide education and outreach efforts to the community about the relationship between substance use and mental health. -In 2019, staff met with a psychology professor and staff from the College of the Desert and held a joint community forum on Addiction and Recovery. Topics that were discussed included stigma, children and families, recovery and co-occurring disorders, and treatment and recovery. The Betty Ford Center participated in the the Pride Event in Palm Springs with a booth providing information about the services that we provide.The identified need of substance use treatment will be met through two strategies:-Provide education and outreach regarding substance use -In 2019, the Betty Ford Center partnered with the Finding Freedom Symposium in Palm Springs. The symposium was about bringing forward relevant information for best practices in supporting the LBGTQ community with co-occurring disorders. The Betty Ford Center has a staff member representing the organization at the 2019-2020 Leadership Coachella Valley program. The program encourages community involvement by providing knowledge and perspective on valley-wide needs and concerns.-Use the expertise and specialized knowledge at the Betty Ford Center to train professionals in substance use treatment. -In 2019, efforts were started with the Eisenhower Medical Center to bring back the Awareness Hour in 2020. The Awareness Hour is a Saturday morning speaker series."

In FY20, our members will provide information on how they addressed significant needs identified in their 2019 Community Health Strategy. While conducting the 2019 Shared CHNA research and outreach, Northern Light Mercy Hospital continued to implement priority work from their final year, FY19, of their three-year 2016 Community Health Strategy. Below reflect these efforts related to the 2016 Community Health Strategy. The data gathered from the 2016 Shared Community Health Needs Assessment (Shared CHNA) informed Northern Light Mercy Hospital's Community Health Strategy (Implementation Strategy) developed with input from community stakeholders including those who serve priority populations, local Public Health District Liaisons, local business leaders, and community advocates. Priorities were selected after weighing the severity of each priority area, availability of known and effective interventions, determination that the priority area was un-addressed or under-addressed, and community collaborations underway with Northern Light Mercy Hospital. A hospital task force considered the data and identified areas of significant need including priority concerns, intended actions to address the need, programs and resource allocation, planned collaborations, and population of focus. The implementation strategy was presented and adopted by the hospitals Board of Trustees. Northern Light Mercy Hospital identified six priorities of focus addressing the significant needs identified in its 2016 CHNA as follows:Substance Abuse Treatment Actions taken by Northern Light Mercy Hospital to address this priority in FY19: Northern Light Mercy Hospital works collaboratively with State leaders and partner organizations to advance a highly coordinated approach to care delivery with housing for persons with opioid use disorder.Affordable Housing and Homelessness Actions taken by Northern Light Mercy Hospital to address this priority in FY19: Northern Light Mercy Hospitals McAuley Residence continually refined the model to adapt to the dynamic impact of the opioid crisis and poly-substance use in Maine. Beyond creating a safe space for women to embrace recovery, the program has recognized and responded to the emerging complexity of children, who have endured exposure to opioids, trauma, and multiple medications in utero. Additional groups and services were added in FY19 to foster attachment and build capacity for both mother and child. McAuley Residence is a comprehensive, two generational program with supportive housing for families affected by substance use disorder. The program allows women to engage in offsite mental health services, primary and specialty care services, and substance use disorder treatment without surrendering their children. Families are afforded intensive wrap around services, access to quality child care, parenting coaching, and capacity-building groups to ensure that family stabilization, employment, and education goals are met.Medical Neighborhood Actions taken by Northern Light Mercy Hospital to address this priority in FY19: Northern Light Mercy Hospitals Director of Mission facilitates the work of the medical neighborhood. The weekly meetings of the neighborhood team discuss the needs of individual high users, system issues, and trends across the care delivery system. Mercys Emergency Department, Primary Care Manager, and Financial Counselors play a critical role in developing a rapport with uninsured patients in the acute setting and engaging the necessary neighborhood resources such as peers, street outreach, or CHOWs to begin the desired transition to a medical home. Financial Counselors routinely meet patients in community to complete a comprehensive screen for resources. The Utilization Review Team reviews all requests for care for uninsured persons to determine if the request meets medical necessity and to ensure that care is coordinated with community resources and providers.Preventive screenings and immunizations Actions taken by Northern Light Mercy Hospital to address this priority in FY19: Northern Light Mercy Hospital delivered a health screening event and partnered on a flu clinic with Northern Light Home Care and Hospice.Enrollment Activities and Coverage Counseling Actions taken by Northern Light Mercy Hospital to address this priority in FY19: Northern Light Mercy Hospital remains committed to having a team of Financial Counselors that work collaboratively with local agencies and clinical teams to uncover health insurance coverage options for uninsured or underinsured persons in Greater Portland. Northern Light Mercy Hospital added a financial counselor in the Emergency Department.Health Education Actions taken by Northern Light Mercy Hospital to address this priority in FY19: Northern Light Mercy Hospital provided four health education sessions for Maine Access Immigrant Network and Portland Housing Authority.Additional information related to actions taken by Northern Light Mercy Hospital on the above priorities can be found in their FY19 Progress Report to Our Community at https://northernlighthealth.org/Community-Health-Needs-Assessment/2016-CHNA-Reports/Community-Health-Strategy Northern Light Mercy Hospital considered all priorities identified in the Shared CHNA, as well as other sources, through an extensive review process. While the full spectrum of needs is important, Northern Light Mercy Hospital is currently poised to focus only on the highest priorities at this time. A number of priorities not selected, due to a variety of reasons are listed below:Unemployment/economic opportunityOral HealthDental CareFearWhile we support the non-selected priorities, we are not positioned to impact them directly. Our CHNA recognized the significant need for oral health services for the vulnerable, but the task force felt that Northern Light Mercy Hospital was not positioned to address directly."

IN FY19, SFMC HAD AN ACTIVE ROLE IN ADDRESSING THE FOLLOWING NEEDS:ADVERSE CHILDHOOD EXPERIENCES (ACES)SFMC HAS CHOSEN TO WORK WITH ADVERSE CHILDHOOD EXPERIENCES (ACES). THE CENTERS FOR DISEASE CONTROL AND PREVENTION (CDC) DEFINE ACES AS ""POTENTIALLY TRAUMATIC EVENTS THAT OCCUR IN CHILDHOOD (0-17 YEARS)."" THESE CAN INCLUDE PSYCHOLOGICAL, PHYSICAL AND SEXUAL ABUSE AS WELL AS EXPOSURE TO SUBSTANCE ABUSE, MENTAL ILLNESS, VIOLENCE AND PARENTAL INCARCERATION. RECENT RESEARCH HAS ALSO INCLUDED THE ROLE THAT COMMUNITY ENVIRONMENTS AND SOCIAL DETERMINANTS, SUCH AS CHRONIC POVERTY AND RACISM, PLAY IN A CHILD'S LIFE TO INCREASE THE RISK OF ACES. IT UTILIZES A TEN QUESTION SURVEY TO REVEAL THE POTENTIALS AND AS THE NUMBER OF POSITIVE RESPONSES TO ACES INCREASES, SO DOES THE RISK FOR POOR OUTCOMES. ACES HAVE BEEN LINKED TO RISKY HEALTH BEHAVIORS, CHRONIC HEALTH CONDITIONS, LOW LIFE POTENTIAL AND EARLY DEATH. THE GOAL OF SFMC IS TO PROVIDE A DEEPER AWARENESS OF THE TYPES OF TRAUMA AND ITS TRIGGERS AFFECTING CHILDREN AND THE PROCESSES FOR HEALING AND BREAKING THE INTERGENERATIONAL OUTCOMES CAUSED BY ACES.SFMC, IN ADDITION TO OTHER ORGANIZATIONS WITHIN THE CITY, IS A MEMBER OF A TASK FORCE TO PLAN AND IMPLEMENT THE MISSION OF HELPING TRENTON TO BECOME A ""HEALING-CENTERED CITY"". THE INSIGHT, ENERGY AND GUIDANCE OF SUCH A GROUP WORKING TOGETHER TO REDUCE THE IMPACT OF TRAUMA AND ACES AND ELEVATE THE PRESENCE OF RESILIENCE THROUGHOUT TRENTON'S NEIGHBORHOODS WILL BE THE BEGINNING OF A CITY-WIDE DISCUSSION ABOUT ACES. SFMC WILL PROMOTE COMMUNITY AWARENESS OF ACES BY INCREASING PUBLIC UNDERSTANDING THROUGH MEDIA CAMPAIGNS, DISCUSSION GROUPS AND COMMUNITY EVENTS. IN FY19, SFMC HOSTED TWO SCREENINGS OF THE MOVIE RESILIENCE FOR OUR HOSPITAL EXECUTIVE TEAM, EMPLOYEES, MEMBERS OF OUR CARES (CHILDREN ARE REALLY EXTRA SPECIAL) TEAM AND THE COMMUNITY. THE ACES ADVOCACY EFFORTS WERE ALSO INTRODUCED AT THE 6TH ANNUAL POLICE CHAPLAINS CONFERENCE AT THE WAR MEMORIAL ON JUNE 11, 2019, INCLUDING AN INTRODUCTION OF NEW JERSEY'S RESILIENCY TRAINING FOR LAW ENFORCEMENT. THE AIM OF THE PROGRAM WAS TO IMPROVE LAW ENFORCEMENT OFFICERS' WELL-BEING BY TEACHING THEM HOW TO IDENTIFY STRESSORS AND RESPOND APPROPRIATELY FOLLOWING A TRAUMATIC EVENT OR TRIGGERING INCIDENT. THE CHAPLAIN MINISTRY PROGRAM WAS INITIATED TO INTEGRATE THESE RESILIENCY EFFORTS. IN ADDITION TO ACES, SFMC PARTICIPATED IN ACTIVITIES THAT ADDRESSED OTHER COMMUNITY NEEDS, INCLUDING FOOD INSECURITY AND NUTRITION, SUBSTANCE USE, AND CHRONIC DISEASE. SFMC HAS SERVED AS A MEMBER OF THE TRENTON PUBLIC SCHOOL WELLNESS COUNCIL SINCE 2017. THIS PARTNERSHIP CONTINUED AND WAS EXPANDED IN 2019 TO INCLUDE PRE-SCHOOLS, INCLUDING SOME ABBOTT SCHOOLS AND HEADSTART PROGRAMS. THE FOLLOWING PROGRAMS WERE HELD IN CONJUNCTION WITH THE WELLNESS COUNCIL IN 2019:TRENTON UNITED SOCCER TOURNAMENT - THIS EFFORT WAS BEGUN TO UTILIZE PHYSICAL ACTIVITY AS A REPLACEMENT FOR CANDY SALES WITHIN SCHOOLS. A TOTAL OF 80 CHILDREN PARTICIPATED, RAISING MORE THAN $3,000, WHICH WAS EQUIVALENT TO THE PREVIOUS YEAR'S CANDY SALES.BILINGUAL PARENT CONFERENCE AND THE NJEA FAST PROGRAM (FAMILIES AND SCHOOLS TOGETHER WORK FOR CHILDREN) - THE PURPOSE OF THIS CONFERENCE WAS TO EDUCATE AND EMPOWER LATINO PARENTS WITH THE TOOLS AND INFORMATION NEEDED TO ADVOCATE FOR THEIR CHILDREN AND FAMILIES. MORE THAN 250 PEOPLE ATTENDED AT THE HEDGEPATH WILLIAMS SCHOOL. FAMILY FLU FEST - FAMILIES WERE INVITED TO SFMC TO RECEIVE FREE FLU VACCINES. MORE THAN 150 INDIVIDUALS ATTENDED THE EVENT THAT WAS DONE IN COLLABORATION WITH THE NJ ACADEMY OF PEDIATRICS, BELLEVUE PEDIATRIC CLINIC AND HENRY J. AUSTIN, THE LOCAL FEDERALLY QUALIFIED HEALTH CENTER.TRENTON PUBLIC SCHOOL EXTRAVAGANZA - THIS EVENT WAS HELD BEFORE THE SCHOOL YEAR OPENED IN 2019 TO PROVIDE RESOURCES FOR THE CHILDREN AND PARENTS OF THE TRENTON SCHOOL SYSTEM. IN ADDITION TO LUNCH BAGS AND BOOK BAGS, PARENTS WERE PROVIDED WITH INFORMATION CONCERNING ACES. MORE THAN 450 PEOPLE ATTENDED THE EVENT.KICK BUTTS DAY - THIS EVENT EDUCATED MORE THAN 200 STUDENTS ON THE EFFECTS OF SMOKING CIGARETTES AND E-CIGARETTES. IN COLLABORATION WITH THT, A LARGE BANNER WAS SIGNED AND HUNG WITH STUDENTS' SIGNATURES WHO PROMISED NOT TO ENGAGE IN ANY TYPE OF SMOKING.HEALTH TEACHER/GO NOODLE PROGRAM - THIS PROGRAM WAS UTILIZED BY 18 SPONSORED ELEMENTARY SCHOOLS, INCLUDING 277 ELIGIBLE TEACHERS AND 6,088 ELIGIBLE STUDENTS, DEMONSTRATING PHYSICAL ACTIVITY IN-BETWEEN PERIODS OF STUDY WITHIN THE CLASSROOM. SFMC CONTINUED TO WORK WITH OUR PARTNER, NOVO NORDISK, THROUGHOUT THE YEAR 2018.FOOD INSECURITY, ACCESS, AND NUTRITION:ACCESS TO HEALTHY FOODS CONTINUED TO BE A CONCERN FOR TRENTON RESIDENTS AND PLAYS A SIGNIFICANT ROLE IN THE DEVELOPMENT OF THE CHILDREN IN THE TRENTON COMMUNITY. IN ORDER TO ADDRESS THIS CONCERN, SFMC COLLABORATED WITH A LOCAL FARMER TO BRING FRESH FRUITS AND VEGETABLES TO OUR HOSPITAL EMPLOYEES AND TO THE COMMUNITY BY ESTABLISHING A FARMERS MARKET ON CAMPUS. THE MARKET ACCEPTED ALL STATE AND FEDERAL ASSISTANCE PROGRAMS INCLUDING SNAP, WIC, FMNP AND SENIOR VOUCHERS. THIS MARKET WAS HELD ON A WEEKLY BASIS AND WAS EXTREMELY WELL RECEIVED BY OUR EMPLOYEES AND OUR COMMUNITY. AN ADDITIONAL FARMERS MARKET WAS ADDED WEEKLY IN THE DOWNTOWN TRENTON AREA IN COLLABORATION WITH THT AND HENRY J. AUSTIN, THE FEDERALLY QUALIFIED HEALTH CENTER. SFMC CONTINUED TO COLLABORATE WITH THE THT TO TRANSFORM OUR LOCAL CORNER STORES INTO HEALTHY CORNER STORES BY OFFERING FRESH PRODUCE AND OTHER HEALTHY OPTIONS TO COMMUNITY MEMBERS. IN 2017 THROUGH 2019, WORKING WITH THT, THE FOOD TRUST AND THE NJ PARTNERSHIP FOR HEALTHY KIDS, THE LUCKY STAR DELI, LOCATED IN THE CITY OF TRENTON, PARTICIPATED IN THE HEALTHY CORNER STORE NETWORK. ONCE A MONTH HEART SMARTS BROUGHT NUTRITION LESSONS TO THE DELI. CUSTOMERS LEARNED ABOUT SELECTING HEALTHY FOODS SUCH AS HEART HEALTHY WHOLE GRAINS AND TASTED RECIPES MADE FROM HEALTHY PRODUCTS AVAILABLE IN THE STORE. FOLLOWING A BLOOD PRESSURE SCREENING BY A SFMC NURSE, EACH PARTICIPANT RECEIVED FOUR HEART BUCKS (EACH $1) TO REDEEM FOR ANY HEART HEALTHY ITEMS IN THE STORE AS WELL AS OTHER INCENTIVES AND INFORMATION TO ENCOURAGE HEALTHY EATING.SFMC IS NOT DIRECTLY ADDRESSING THE FOLLOWING PRIORITIES: HOUSING, RACIAL/ETHNIC INEQUITIES, MENTAL HEALTH AND SUBSTANCE USE DISORDERS, COMMUNITY SAFETY, CHRONIC DISEASE, AND MATERNAL AND CHILD HEALTH. THIS IS DUE TO FINANCIAL RESTRICTIONS, THE ABILITY OF OTHER AGENCIES TO ADDRESS THE SAME ISSUES, AND IN ORDER TO FOCUS ON EFFECTIVELY IMPACTING AND PREVENTING ADVERSE CHILDHOOD EXPERIENCES. THE HOSPITAL WILL CONTINUE TO ACKNOWLEDGE THE IMPACT OF THESE ISSUES WHILE IT FOCUSES ON THE EMERGING PRIORITIES IDENTIFIED BY QUANTITATIVE DATA AND COMMUNITY ENGAGEMENT EFFORTS."

Multiple conversations and meetings were convened internally and with external partners and a thorough review of the data was conducted. Multiple data sources were used to support the identification and selection of the priority items which were identified, selected and reviewed with the partners. The collection of primary data from a sample of the Westchester County residents was an important element of the development of the Community Health Needs Assessment. Montefiore engaged with the Westchester County Department of Health's online Community Resident and Provider Health Surveys to facilitate the implementation of the primary data collection process for the Community Health Needs Assessment for Westchester County and to assist in the facilitation of these community level connections thereby alleviating additional surveying overload. An online survey was collaboratively developed and made available across Westchester County over the summer of 2016. During this process, Westchester County compiled feedback from over 1,300 responders and identified community concerns by municipality to support CHNA efforts of hospitals for inclusion into their implementation plans. In addition to collaborative input from the local Department of Health, Montefiore worked closely with it communities, organized partnerships and collaboratives and other providers in lower Westchester as well as extensive work with representatives of the affected communities to help Montefiore to identify health care needs and determine the appropriate configuration of services."

The two priority areas identified were (1)Preventing Chronic Disease and (2)Promoting Healthy Women, Infants and Children. As part of the submission for the New York State Health Improvement Plan for 2016-2018, required by the New York State Department of Health, Montefiore has elected to retain these two priority areas, Prevent Chronic Disease and Promote Healthy Women, Infants and Children and has selected three broad focus areas to implement programs. These broad focus areas are (1)reducing obesity in children and adults, (2)Increase access to high quality chronic disease Preventive care and management in both clinical and community settings and (3) Improving maternal and infant Health. Across these focus areas, various goals, with specific interventions, performance measures and time frames, were delineated; - Create community environments that promote and support healthy food and beverage choices and physical activity; - Increase screening rates for cardiovascular disease, diabetes and breast, cervical and colorectal cancers, especially among disparate populations; - Reduce premature births. Despite each of the different methods and approached to primary data collection in gathering community input, there was a consistent focus on obesity and related behaviors and outcomes among the main community health concerns. Obesity and its related behaviors have significant impact on chronic disease, therefore, it is intended that the programs that are detailed specifically for the reduction of obesity will also impact the prevalence of diabetes, hypertension, asthma, cancer and cardiovascular disease in Westchester County. Montefiore has a vast portfolio of programs and services that address a majority of the significant community health needs identified in the Community Health Needs Assessment. The breadth and depth of the programs and services vary, but each address a need identified in the community. In particular, there are programs underway in collaboration with Hudson River Healthcare and Westchester Local Government units to work with bodegas on healthy snack displays and creating walking paths in parks and communities. In addition to the multiple resources that have been developed at Montefiore independently and through partnership with other organizations, there is an extensive need for community-based programs and resources that can augment Montefiore's program and services. Knowing how to access those resources is a particular challenge for the health care sector. However, since the last CHNA report in 2013, multiple free and low cost online search tools have been developed, such as www.auntbertha.com, www.hitesite.org, www.nowpow.com, among others. These are a much more comprehensive and practical alternative to the home-grown referral guides that many health care providers have had to use in the past. Those were hard to keep-up-to date and difficult to search, a problem that is largely addressed by the online version. Many Montefiore sites have been introduced to these new online resources and work is underway to more seamlessly integrate this kind of solution into the various workflows across the ambulatory, ED and inpatient settings."

A FACING SUICIDE BOOKLET, WHICH TELLS THE STORIES OF JEFFERSON COUNTY FAMILIES IMPACTED BY SUICIDE, WAS MADE AVAILABLE FOR VIEWING ON THE KDH WEBSITE IN 2019.PLANS NOT TO ADDRESS THE FOLLOWING NEEDS:NO HOSPITAL CAN ADDRESS ALL OF THE HEALTH NEEDS PRESENT IN ITS COMMUNITY. KING'S DAUGHTERS' HEALTH IS COMMITTED TO SERVING THE COMMUNITY BY ADHERING TO ITS MISSION, USING ITS SKILLS AND CAPABILITIES, AND REMAINING A STRONG ORGANIZATION SO THAT IT CAN CONTINUE TO PROVIDE A WIDE RANGE OF COMMUNITY BENEFITS. THE IMPLEMENTATION STRATEGY DOES NOT INCLUDE SPECIFIC PLANS TO ADDRESS THE FOLLOWING SIGNIFICANT HEALTH NEEDS THAT WERE IDENTIFIED IN THE 2016 COMMUNITY HEALTH NEEDS ASSESSMENT: 1. KDH WILL FOCUS STRATEGIES TARGETING SUBSTANCE ABUSE / ADDICTIONS PRIMARILY TO RESIDENTS OF JEFFERSON COUNTY, INDIANA. KDH WILL CONTINUE TO BE INVOLVED IN THE LOCAL COORDINATING COUNCIL IN SWITZERLAND COUNTY, THE SWITZERLAND COUNTY AWARENESS TEAM (SCAT) TO SUPPORT PROGRAMS FUNDED THROUGH SCAT DOLLARS. THESE PROGRAMS TARGET SUBSTANCE ABUSE PREVENTION, TREATMENT, AND JUSTICE EFFORTS. KDH WILL ENCOURAGE STAFF FROM THE SWITZERLAND COUNTY PHYSICIANS PRACTICE OFFICE TO STAY INFORMED WITH SCAT EFFORTS AND ANY COUNTY PROGRAMMING TARGETING SUBSTANCE ABUSE. KDH WILL NOT HAVE AN ACTIVE PRESENCE IN TRIMBLE COUNTY KENTUCKY REGARDING SUBSTANCE ABUSE CONCERNS DUE TO LACK OF STAFFING AND RESOURCES. RESIDENTS OF BOTH SWITZERLAND AND TRIMBLE COUNTIES HAVE THE POTENTIAL TO INDIRECTLY BENEFIT FROM STRATEGIES IN JEFFERSON COUNTY, AS MANY RESIDENTS IN THESE NEIGHBORING COUNTIES WORK, SHOP, DINE, OR EVEN GO TO SCHOOL IN JEFFERSON COUNTY. 2. TWO OF THE THREE STRATEGIES TARGETING OVERWEIGHT / OBESITY AND LACK OF PHYSICAL ACTIVITY HAVE THE POTENTIAL TO BENEFIT RESIDENTS IN ALL THREE COUNTIES SURVEYED IN THE 2016 CHNA. RESIDENTS IN SWITZERLAND AND TRIMBLE COUNTIES WILL HAVE THE ABILITY TO PARTICIPATE IN THE STRIVE FOR 5 CLASSES, JUST LIKE JEFFERSON COUNTY RESIDENTS. THE FIT KIDS PROGRAM WILL EXPAND TO ELEMENTARY SCHOOLS IN SWITZERLAND COUNTY AND POTENTIALLY TRIMBLE COUNTY AT A LATER DATE. THE HCI HEALTHY LIFESTYLES WELLNESS CHALLENGE WILL BE EXCLUSIVE TO JEFFERSON COUNTY RESIDENTS. THIS IS DUE TO HCI CURRENTLY FOCUSING EFFORTS IN JEFFERSON COUNTY. LACK OF STAFFING AND A NON-EXISTING COMMUNITY HEALTH INITIATIVE IN SWITZERLAND AND TRIMBLE COUNTIES AT THE PRESENT TIME LIMIT A SIMILAR PROGRAM TO HCI. 3. TOBACCO USE EFFORTS WILL PRIMARILY BE FOCUSED IN JEFFERSON COUNTY. CURRENT STATE FUNDING, SUPPORTED IN-KIND BY KDH, LIMITS PROGRAMMING TO JEFFERSON COUNTY RESIDENTS. SOME FLEXIBILITY APPLIES TO POSITIVELY IMPACT RESIDENTS OF SWITZERLAND COUNTY INDIANA. THESE INDIVIDUALS CAN STILL BENEFIT FROM THE INDIANA STATE QUITLINE SERVICES AND THE TOBACCO COORDINATOR CAN PROVIDE RESOURCES WHEN REQUESTED TO THE PHYSICIAN OFFICE IN SWITZERLAND COUNTY. RESIDENTS OF TRIMBLE COUNTY KENTUCKY WHO WORK, SHOP, AND DINE IN JEFFERSON COUNTY WILL BENEFIT FROM SMOKE-FREE AIR EFFORTS. 4. TWO OF THE THREE STRATEGIES TARGETING CHRONIC DISEASE ARE INCLUSIVE TO RESIDENTS IN BOTH SWITZERLAND AND TRIMBLE COUNTIES. INDIVIDUALS WHO ARE PATIENTS AT KING'S DAUGHTERS' HEALTH, REGARDLESS OF RESIDENCE, HAVE THE POTENTIAL TO PARTICIPATE IN BOTH THE CHF AND COPD READMISSION PROGRAMS. RESIDENTS IN THESE COUNTIES CANNOT PARTICIPATE IN THE HOUSE OF HEALTH PROGRAM, AS THE HOUSE OF HOPE FOOD PANTRY IS EXCLUSIVE FOR RESIDENTS OF JEFFERSON COUNTY. 5. THE MAJORITY OF STRATEGIES TARGETING MENTAL HEALTH / SUICIDE WILL BE EXCLUSIVE TO JEFFERSON COUNTY, DUE TO THE MCS AND HCI EFFORTS AND PARTNERSHIP. RESIDENTS OF NEIGHBORING COUNTIES ARE WELCOME TO ATTEND THE SUICIDE SUPPORT GROUP AND ADDITIONAL SUICIDE AWARENESS ACTIVITIES LIKE THE WALK TO REMEMBER."

202042269349302299,060646715,Midstate Medical Center,"Part V, Section B, Line 11: After reviewing the Community Health Needs Assessment findings, the community representatives met on May 11, 2018 to determine the health needs to be prioritized for action. There was a review of the identified needs followed by a wide-ranging discussion. After which the participants were asked to rank each of the needs. Based on data analysis, surveys, focus groups, and interviews, these are the top community health needs and priorities identified for the Midstate Medical Center focus area: - Common themes surfaced around access to housing and transportation. When the lack of access to transportation impact the ability to access healthcare, the population usually foregoes healthcare services. Transportation schedules and routes do not service many outpatient or urgent care clinics; however, they do service the hospital, leading to overutilization of the ED. *Lack of affordable, secure, and stable housing *Access to care *Emergency departments often used for primary care *Patient hand-offs between caregivers are not well coordinated or followed-up on *Underutilized preventative care - Availability of healthy foods, especially fruits and vegetables, with a significant impact on seniors and children outside school-based programs - Childhood obesity including a lack of resources/facilities to safely exercise and cost of food - Mental health issues including substance abuse and addiction *Shortage of providers or Lack of affordable treatment options *Limited comprehensive outpatient care *Lack of insurance coverage for behavioral health *No same-day access - Stressing of social networks - Meriden scored significantly worse in physical and mental health indicators (including healthy weight, cigarette smoking, asthma, and depression) relative to the rest of the focus area and the state of Connecticut - Despite a significant number of outstanding ongoing community health initiatives, the majority of stakeholders who participated in focus groups and interviews said that a lack of coordination among and between providers and community-based organizations limits the overall effectiveness of the programs and the funding that is going to help serve the populations most in need. The results were then grouped into 3 Areas of Concern that were addressed in Community Health Improvement Plan (CHIP):1. Enhance Coordination of Services: this category includes Access to Care and TransportationCHIP addressed this need in the following manner:a. Evaluate and use information exchange portal resources, linking healthcare providers with community-based organizations.b. Improve IT resources to enable community focus and better measurement of outcomes.c. Develop a playbook for infrastructure, dashboard of health, governance, and community workflows.d. Enable dynamic and up-to-date asset mapping.e. Develop innovation network for learning, research, co-creation, and rapid knowledge dissemination (bi-directional communication platform).f. Implement new or increased use of Community Health Workers (CHW).g. Evaluate and use adaptive technology (e.g., geo-fencing, GIS mapping, artificial intelligence, biometric risk assessment, Epic tie-ins).2. Promote Healthy Behaviors and Lifestyle: this category includes Access to Healthy Food and Poor Physical and Mental Health. CHIP addresses this need in the following manner:a. Screen for healthy food need identification in community population and provide assessment at points of care. b. Enhance Promotion and Marketing, including adopting 5-2-1-0 initiative, at schools, workplaces, public spaces, faith communities, and healthcare events. c. Provide voucher/prescription programs for fruits and vegetables.d. Promote and improve healthy food donation. e. Further partnerships with food pantries/banks and food providers and suppliers.f. Create more access points for healthy foods.g. Develop urban gardens, community gardens, hospital campus gardens, farmer's markets (fresh food).h. Evaluate and use mobile food programs.i. Create and support food policy councils.3. Improve community Behavioral Health: this category includes Mental Health and Substance Abuse. CHIP addresses this need in the following manner: a. Embed behavioral health services in primary care (ongoing).b. Recruit more mental health providers, with focus on community outpatient services (e.g., family therapists).c. Implement Recovery Coach program in ED.d. Provide more depression screening growth and at more points of care with referrals.(including at public schools) and integrate into Epic.e. Further Mental Health First Aid training and grow community behavioral health training at the local level.f. Enhance services in virtual mental health, including tele-psychiatry.Areas of Opportunity, identified but not prioritized were housing and safety issues including a lack of affordable housing, neighborhood safety, and housing conditions. It was determined that Midstate Medical Center does not have the resources or expertise to address these issues but will certainly support the efforts of other city and community agencies and organizations."

THE MONROE COUNTY CHNA IS CONDUCTED IN COLLABORATION WITH OTHER HOSPITALS, THE LOCAL PUBLIC HEALTH DEPARTMENT AND OTHER AGENCIES IN MONROE COUNTY. A GROUP OF REPRESENTATIVES FROM EACH OF THESE ENTITIES MEETS MONTHLY AND IS CALLED THE COMMUNITY HEALTH IMPROVEMENT WORKGROUP (CHIW). THE CHIW MEETS TO CONDUCT THE CHNA WHEN INDICATED AND TO IMPLEMENT THE COMMUNITY-WIDE IMPROVEMENT STRATEGY. THERESA GREEN, DIRECTOR OF COMMUNITY HEALTH POLICY FROM THE URMC CENTER FOR COMMUNITY HEALTH AND PREVENTION, LED THE CHIW AND PROVIDED EXPERT ADVICE ON COMMUNITY ENGAGEMENT AND EVIDENCE BASED INTERVENTIONS. COMMUNITY INPUT IS CRITICAL THROUGHOUT THE CHNA PROCESS, THE IMPROVEMENT PLANNING PROCESS, AND THE IMPLEMENTATION PROCESS. ONGOING COMMUNITY ENGAGEMENT IS VITAL TO INFORM THE AGENDA. THE CHIW USED SEVERAL STRATEGIES TO ASSURE COMMUNITY INPUT WHEN DEVELOPING THE CHNA. FIRST, EACH OF THE COUNTYS HOSPITAL SYSTEMS REPRESENTATIVES TO THE CHIW TOOK INTO ACCOUNT INPUT FROM PERSONS WHO REPRESENT THE COMMUNITY. EACH OF THE HOSPITAL SYSTEMS INCLUDED IN THE CHNA: UNIVERSITY OF ROCHESTER STRONG MEMORIAL HOSPITAL, HIGHLAND HOSPITAL, ROCHESTER REGIONAL HEALTH, AND UNITY HOSPITAL, SEND A REPRESENTATIVE TO THE CHIW. IN ADDITION, COMMON GROUND HEALTH, WHO REPRESENTS THE COMMUNITY VOICE AND WHO MANAGES BOTH THE AFRICAN AMERICAN HEALTH COALITION AND THE LATINO HEALTH COALITION FOR MONROE COUNTY, WAS REPRESENTED AT EACH CHIW MEETING BY EITHER DINA FATICONE, DIRECTOR OF COMMUNITY HEALTH AND ENGAGEMENT, OR SEVERAL OF THEIR OTHER REPRESENTATIVES. SEVERAL OTHER COMMUNITY AGENCIES INCLUDING UNITED WAY, THE REGIONAL HEALTH INFORMATION ORGANIZATION, AND THE COORDINATED CARE SERVICES, INC FOR MENTAL HEALTH ATTEND THE CHIW MEETINGS AND INFORMED THE CHNA AND CHIP. THE MONROE COUNTY DEPARTMENT OF PUBLIC HEALTH WAS REPRESENTED AT EACH CHIW MEETING BY DR. MARIELENA VELEZ DE BROWN, MD, MPH DEPUTY COMMISSIONER OF PUBLIC HEALTH AT MONROE COUNTY DEPARTMENT OF PUBLIC HEALTH; ANNE KERN, PUBLIC HEALTH PROGRAM COORDINATOR, AND KATHY CARELOCK, MANAGER OF THE DIVISION OF EPIDEMIOLOGY. ALL ARE AWARE OF COMMUNITY NEEDS, OVERSEE THE ADULT AND YOUTH HEALTH SURVEY PROCESS AND ARE EXPERTS IN EFFECTIVE PUBLIC HEALTH ASSESSMENT AND INTERVENTION. MICHAEL MENDOZA, MD, MPH AND CURRENT COMMISSIONER OF THE MONROE COUNTY DEPARTMENT OF PUBLIC HEALTH, ATTENDED MEETINGS OCCASSIONALLY BUT WAS ALSO INFORMED BY DR. VELEZ DE BROWN, MS. KERN, MS. CARELOCK, AND DR. GREEN. ASIDE FOR INFRASTRUCTURE DESIGNED FOR COMMUNITY REPRSENTATION, THE CHIW RELIED HEAVILY ON A COMMUNITY SURVEY CONDUCTED BY COMMON GROUND HEALTH FOR COMMUNITY INPUT. IN 2018, COMMON GROUND HEALTH CONDUCTED A REGIONAL SURVEY OF COMMUNITY MEMBERS TO LEARN MORE ABOUT HEALTH BEHAVIORS AND BARRIERS TO HEALTHY LIVES. WITH PARTICULAR ATTENTION TO GATHERING INPUT FROM A DIVERSE GROUP OF PARTICIPANTS, OVER 4,000 PEOPLE WERE SURVEYED. THE SURVEY ASKED ABOUT A WIDE RANGE OF TOPICS FROM ACCESS TO MEDICAL AND DENTAL CARE TO PERCEPTIONS OF PERSONAL SAFETY AND SATISFACTION WITH WORK. TO CAPTURE EACH INDIVIDUALS UNIQUE STORY, SEVERAL QUESTIONS ARE OPEN-ENDED WITH AN OPPORTUNITY FOR UNSTRUCTURED FEEDBACK. THE RESULTS OF THE SURVEY INDICATED THAT THE TOP CONCERN FOR ADULTS IN MONROE COUNTY ACROSS ALL RACES, GEOGRAPHIES, AND SOCIOECONOMIC STATUS LEVELS WAS MENTAL HEALTH. AFTER REVIEWING THE DATA AND PRIORITIZING THE GENERAL DIRECTION FOR THE CHNA/CHIP, SEVERAL MEETINGS WERE PLANNED WITH SIGNIFICANT COMMUNITY GROUPS TO GATHER INPUT. MEMBERS FROM THE CHIW MET FIRST WITH THE AFRICAN AMERICAN HEALTH COALITION AT COMMON GROUND HEALTH ON MARCH 14TH, 2019. THEIR FEEDBACK INCLUDED SPECIFIC AREAS OF MENTAL HEALTH CONCERNS, THE NEED TO REDUCE THE STIGMA OF MENTAL HEALTH DIAGNOSES, AND INVOLVEMENT WITH THE CHURCH COMMUNITY. THEY ALSO SUGGESTED EMPHASIS IN MATERNAL AND CHILD HEALTH OUTCOMES DISPARITIES. REPRESENTATIVES FROM THE CHIW MET WITH THE LATINO HEALTH COALITION AT COMMON GROUND HEALTH ON MARCH 27TH, 2019. THE MATERNAL AND CHILD HEALTH ADVISORY GROUP MET WITH CHIW LEADERS ON MARCH 22, 2019. THIS GROUP DISCUSSED AREAS OF NEED WITHIN MATERNAL/CHILD HEALTH IN MONROE COUNTY, AND IDENTIFIED SEVERAL PRIORITIES INCLUDING FOCUSING ON HOUSING, TRANSPORTATION AND INCOME AS WELL AS ADVOCATING FOR FUNDING FOR SOME OF THE GRANT FUNDED AGENCIES AND INITIATIVES. A SPECIAL SESSION OF THE COMMUNITY ADVISORY COUNCIL WAS CALLED FOR APRIL 11, 2019. THE COMMUNITY ADVISORY COUNCIL (CAC) IS A GROUP OF 40+ LEADERS OF COMMUNITY AGENCIES MEETING WITH UNIVERSITY RESEARCHERS AND PROVIDERS. THE CAC MET IN THIS SESSION TO DISCUSS BOTH THE UNIVERSITY OF ROCHESTERS UPCOMING APPLICATION FOR THE CARNEGIE CLASSIFICATION IN COMMUNITY ENGAGEMENT AND THE COMMUNITY HEALTH IMPROVEMENT PLAN. THE CAC EXPRESSED OVERALL APPROVAL FOR THE PRIORITY AREAS OF THE CHIP AND ADDED SEVERAL MEANINGFUL SUGGESTIONS THAT WERE INCORPORATED INTO THE PLAN. THIS HIGH LEVEL COLLABORATION AMONG COMMUNITY MEMBERS, PUBLIC HEALTH PROVIDERS AND HOSPITAL SYSTEMS, ALONG WITH THE ROBUST PROCESS OF COMMUNITY INPUT GATHERING, PROVIDES A TRULY COMMUNITY BASED HEALTH NEEDS ASSESSMENT AND IMPROVEMENT PLAN. --------------------"

202021969349305657,160743209,"PART V, SECTION B, LINE 11 - ADDRESSING THE NEEDS IDENTIFIED IN THE CHNA","THE 2019 COMMUNITY HEALTH NEEDS ASSESSMENT IDENTIFIED TWO PRIMARY FOCUS AREAS BASED ON VARIOUS SOURCES OF DATA AND SEVERAL OPPORTUNITIES FOR COMMUNITY INPUT. THE IDENTIFIED PRIORITY AREAS ARE MENTAL HEALTH/WELL-BEING AND MATERNAL CHILD HEALTH DISPARITIES. THE OBJECTIVES AND INTERVENTIONS FOR EACH AREA OF NEED WERE SELECTED FROM THE NEW YORK STATE PREVENTION AGENDAS LIST OF RECOMMENDED, EVIDENCE-BASED INTERVENTIONS AND PROGRAMS. THE FOLLOWING WORK PLAN WILL BE IMPLEMENTED IN MONROE COUNTY TO PROGRESS TOWARDS THE GOALS OF THE 2019-2021 COMMUNITY HEALTH IMPROVEMENT PLAN, USING THE RESOURCES OF THE CHIW. ALL FOUR HOSPITALS AND THE HEALTH DEPARTMENT AS WELL AS COMMUNITY PARTNERS WILL WORK COLLABORATIVELY ON THE SAME WORK PLAN TOWARDS THE SAME GOALS. THE INTERVENTIONS WILL BE IMPLEMENTED IN A COLLABORATIVE MANNER, AND THE HOSPITALS WILL DELEGATE RESOURCES INCLUDING REPRESENTATIVES, MEETING SPACES, CONTENT EXPERTS AND ORGANIZATIONAL CONNECTIONS. OUR COMMUNITY PARTNERS ARE INVOLVED IN THE PLANNING AND IMPLEMENTATION OF ALL INTERVENTION STRATEGIES, FROM THEIR SELECTION TO THEIR COMPLETION. MATERNAL CHILD HEALTH IS AN AREA OF CONCERN FOR MONROE COUNTY, AND THE CURRENT DISPARITIES ARE UNACCEPTABLE. THE GOAL FOR MATERNAL CHILD HEALTH IN THE 2019-2021 CHIP IS: REDUCE RACIAL, ETHNIC, ECONOMIC AND GEOGRAPHIC DISPARITIES IN MATERNAL AND CHILD HEALTH OUTCOMES AND PROMOTE HEALTH EQUITY FOR MATERNAL AND CHILD POPULATIONS. THE GOAL WILL BE ATTAINED THROUGH SEVERAL INTERVENTIONS INCLUDING: 1. PARTNER WITH HEALTHY BABY NETWORK AND OTHER MEMBERS OF THE MATERNAL CHILD HEALTH ADVISORY GROUP TO CONDUCT COMMUNITY INPUT SESSIONS TO IDENTIFY THE DRIVERS AND SOLUTIONS TO DISPARITIES. BY DECEMBER OF 2020, COMPLETE A COMPREHENSIVE SUMMARY OF BARRIERS TO HEALTHY OUTCOMES AMONG WOMEN OF REPRODUCTIVE AGE, PRIMARILY PEOPLE OF COLOR, PEOPLE WITH LOW SES, AND PEOPLE WHO LIVE IN THE CITY OF ROCHESTER. 2. CONVENE A MATERNAL CHILD HEALTH ADVISORY GROUP TO DISCUSS INTERVENTIONS AND PLAN IMPLEMENTATION TO ADDRESS BARRIERS IDENTIFIED BY THE COMMUNITY. BY DECEMBER OF 2021, IMPLEMENT AT LEAST 3 SYSTEMS CHANGES THAT WILL ADDRESS SOCIAL BARRIERS AND IMPROVE DISPARITIES IN MATERNAL CHILD HEALTH OUTCOMES. AND 3. HOST A SYNERGY MEETING ON LOCAL MATERNAL AND CHILD HEALTH DISPARITIES ANNUALLY PRESENTING RESULTS OF FOCUS GROUPS AND MCH ADVISORY GROUP WORK. BY DECEMBER OF 2021, HOST TWO WELL ATTENDED SYNERGY MEETINGS FOCUSING ON MCH DISPARITIES AND PROGRESS OF THE ADVISORY GROUP. PROMOTING MENTAL HEALTH AND WELL-BEING IS A PRIORITY AREA OF PARTICULAR IMPORTANCE TO OUR COMMUNITY MEMBERS. INTERVENTIONS FOCUS ON THE UPSTREAM APPROACH OF ADDRESSING SOCIAL DETERMINANTS OF HEALTH INCLUDING POVERTY AND EMPLOYMENT IN ORDER TO IMPACT THE LONG TERM HEALTH OF THE COMMUNITY AND ADDRESS DISPARITIES IN WEALTH. THERE ARE TWO GOALS IN THIS AREA. ONE IS TO STRENGTHEN OPPORTUNITIES TO BUILD WELL-BEING AND RESILIENCE ACROSS THE LIFESPAN. THIS GOAL WILL BE ATTAINED THROUGH SEVERAL INTERVENTIONS INCLUDING: 1. EXPLORE OPPORTUNITIES TO USE THE POWER OF ANCHOR INSTITUTIONS SUCH AS HOSPITALS TO REVITALIZE NEIGHBORHOODS, SUPPORTING DEMOCRATICALLY OPERATED WORKER COOPERATIVES, REEMPLOYMENT, AND SUPPORTED EMPLOYMENT. BY DECEMBER OF 2021, COMPLETE A COMPREHENSIVE SUMMARY OF INTERVENTIONS THAT ANCHOR INSTITUTIONS HAVE SUCCESSFULLY IMPLEMENTED TO IMPROVE COMMUNITY WEALTH AND PRESENT AT LEAST ONE RECOMMENDED OPTION TO EACH OF THE HOSPITALS IN THE COMMUNITY HEALTH IMPROVEMENT WORKGROUP. THE SECOND GOAL FOR THIS AREA IS TO FACILITATE SUPPORTIVE ENVIRONMENTS THAT PROMOTE RESPECT AND DIGNITY FOR PEOPLE OF ALL AGES. INTERVENTIONS IN THIS AREA INCLUDE: 1. BY DECEMBER 2021, HOST AT LEAST 4 MENTAL HEALTH FIRST AID SESSIONS TO INCREASE MENTAL HEALTH LITERACY, AWARENESS, AND EDUCATION ABOUT MENTAL HEALTH AND AVAILABLE SERVICES IN MONROE COUNTY. 2. BY DECEMBER 2021, REVIEW AT LEAST 3 TYPES OF DOCUMENTS INTERNAL TO THE HOSPITAL SYSTEMS, AND SEEK HELP FROM LANGUAGE EXPERTS TO CHANGE AND ADAPT LANGUAGE THAT IS NOT ENHANCING STIGMA AND IS DESIGNED TO BE MORE INCLUSIVE. IF RELEVANT, MAKE THESE LANGUAGE CHANGES TO DEFAULT LANGUAGE THAT IS USED IN THE EMR. IN ADDITION TO THE TWO IDENTIFIED FOCUS AREAS OUTLINED ABOVE, THERE ARE SEVERAL AREAS THAT WERE OF NOTED CONCERN TO THE CHIW. THESE SECONDARY AREAS SHOW UNACCEPTABLE OUTCOMES IN ONE OR MORE MEASURABLE INDICATOR HOWEVER LIMITED RESOURCES DO NOT ALLOW FOR DEDICATED ATTENTION AND INTERVENTION TO ADDRESS THEM. THE CHIW HAS AGREED TO FOLLOW AND SUPPORT THESE AREAS IN THE CHIP 2019-2021, WHILE DEDICATING PRIMARY ATTENTION TO THE TWO FOCUS AREAS OF MENTAL HEALTH, AND MATERNAL CHILD HEALTH INEQUITIES. THE FIVE AREAS THE CHIW WILL FOLLOW ARE: 1. SMOKING CESSATION INCREASING SMOKING CESSATION WAS A FOCUS AREA FOR THE MONROE COUNTY COMMUNITY HEALTH IMPROVEMENT PLAN (2016-2018). THROUGH A CHANGE IN THE ELECTRONIC MEDICAL RECORDS PROCESS OF ALL FOUR HOSPITALS IN THE CHIW COLLABORATIVE, THE REFERRALS TO THE NYS QUIT LINE INCREASED 100 FOLD. ELECTRONIC REFERRALS TO THE NYS QUITLINE ARE AVAILABLE THROUGH BOTH MAJOR HEALTH SYSTEMS AND SEVERAL INDEPENDENT CLINICS AND FQHCS THROUGHOUT THE REGION. IN ADDITION, THE LOCAL MILLION HEARTS GROUP CONTINUES TO ORGANIZE AND HOST TOBACCO FREE COLLEGE CAMPUS CONFERENCES AND SUPPORT T-21 LEGISLATIVE INITIATIVES. THE TOBACCO FREE COLLEGE CAMPUS CONFERENCES WAS ORGANIZED BY THE MILLION HEARTS COLLABORATIVE, INCLUDING MEMBERS FROM THE ROCHESTER CHAMBER OF COMMERCE, AND LIDESTRI FOODS INC. AND INCLUDES SUPPORT AND REPRESENTATION FROM LOCAL COLLEGES INCLUDING ROCHESTER INSTITUTE OF TECHNOLOGY, UNIVERSITY OF ROCHESTER, ST. JOHN FISHER, MONROE COMMUNITY COLLEGE, AND NAZARETH COLLEGE. THIS GROUP MEETS TO DISCUSS PROGRESS, CAMPUS POLICIES, AND SETBACKS IN DEVELOPING AND MAINTAINING SMOKE-, TOBACCO-, AND VAPE-FREE LOCAL COLLEGE CAMPUSES. 2. FOOD INSECURITY WORK ON FOOD INSECURITY WAS BEGUN WITH THE CHIP 2016-2018. LOCAL SYSTEMS INTEGRATION PROJECTS ARE UNDERWAY, AND BOTH ROCHESTER REGIONAL HEALTH AND UNIVERSITY OF ROCHESTER MEDICAL CENTER ARE INVOLVED IN THESE PROJECTS, BOTH AS POTENTIAL PILOT LOCATIONS, AND ADVISORY GROUPS. AS THE COMMUNITY HEALTH IMPROVEMENT PLAN FOR 2019-2021 WILL BE ADDRESSING COMMUNITY WELL-BEING, AND SOCIAL DETERMINANT IMPACT ON MATERNAL-CHILD HEALTH, THESE FOCUS AREAS ARE RELATED TO AND INSEPARABLE FROM FOOD INSECURITY AND RESOURCE PROVISION. THE CHIW WILL CONTINUE TO SUPPORT PEDIATRIC DEPARTMENTS AS THEY SCREEN FOR SOCIAL DETERMINANTS INCLUDING FOOD SECURITY, AND WORK WITH LOCAL ORGANIZATIONS SUCH AS FOODLINK AND 2-1-1 TO BUILD COLLABORATIONS WITH THE HEALTH SYSTEMS. 3. OPIOID CRISIS THE OPIOID CRISIS HAS BEEN IMPACTING MONROE COUNTY SINCE THE EARLY 2010S. IN 2016, THE PUBLIC HEALTH GOAL WAS TO DECREASE OVERDOSE AND DEATH BY OVERDOSE RATES TO BELOW THE 2015 LEVEL. UNFORTUNATELY, WITH THE SPREAD OF THE OPIOID CRISIS AND THE INTRODUCTION OF FENTANYL TO THE STREET MARKETPLACE, OPIOID OVERDOSES AND DEATHS HAVE NOT DECREASED TO THIS SET GOAL, AND THEY HAVE INCREASED IN THE PAST 3 YEARS. THERE ARE MANY GROUPS WITHIN AND OUTSIDE OF THE HEALTH SYSTEMS WORKING TO ADDRESS THIS CRISIS. INCREASING THE HIRING OF TOXICOLOGISTS IN THE OFFICE OF THE MEDICAL EXAMINER, TRAINING MORE LOCAL PROVIDERS WITH BUPRENORPHINE WAIVERS AND TRAINING IN MEDICATION-ASSISTED TREATMENT (MAT), THE CONTINUATION AND EXPANSION OF LOCAL HEROIN AND OPIOID TASK FORCES INCLUDING LAW ENFORCEMENT, COUNTY OFFICIALS, TREATMENT CENTERS, AND MEDICAL PROFESSIONALS. THE HEALTH SYSTEMS ARE CONTINUING WORK IN THE SPACE OF SUBSTANCE USE DISORDER PREVENTION, IDENTIFICATION, AND TREATMENT WITH COMMUNITY AND GOVERNMENT PARTNERS. NALOXONE: THERE IS A NYS POLICY NALOXONE CO-PAYMENT ASSISTANCE PROGRAM (N-CAP) THAT PROVIDES A STANDING PRESCRIPTION AND COPAY COVERAGE AVAILABLE AT PHARMACIES WITHOUT AN OPEN PRESCRIPTION. RAISING AWARENESS ABOUT THE AVAILABILITY AND PROPER USE OF NALOXONE WILL CONTINUE IN MONROE COUNTY. TRAININGS ON HOW TO ADMINISTER NALOXONE IN THE CASE OF AN OPIOID OVERDOSE ARE PROVIDED BY MANY COMMUNITY GROUPS AND HEALTHCARE PROVIDERS INCLUDING BUT NOT LIMITED TO MONROE COUNTY DEPARTMENT OF PUBLIC HEALTH, ROCHESTER GENERAL HOSPITAL, URMC, OAK ORCHARD HEALTH, AND TRILLIUM HEALTH. THESE TRAININGS ARE FREQUENT, OFTEN OPEN TO THE PUBLIC, AND ADVERTISED ONLINE BY EACH GROUP. 4. SEXUALLY TRANSMITTED INFECTION (STI) RATES MONROE COUNTY DEPARTMENT OF PUBLIC HEALTH RUNS THE STD AND HIV CONTROL PROGRAM, INCLUDING MEDICAL INTERVENTIONS, SCREENINGS, PREVENTION, EDUCATION, AND PROVIDER TRAINING. THE MATERNAL CHILD HEALTH ADVISORY GROUP INCLUDES MANY GROUPS THAT WORK IN PRENATAL CARE, REPRODUCTIVE EDUCATION, AND STI EDUCATION. CONTINUATION OF SUPPORT AND FUNDING TO THE LOCAL PROVIDERS OF SEX AND REPRODUCTIVE EDUCATION TO BOTH CHILDREN AND ADULTS IN MONROE COUNTY WILL BE NECESSARY TO REDUCE THE RATE OF STIS IN THE REGION. 5.

The most recent CHNA and corresponding implementation plan was completed in the tax reporting year 2018. The following outlines the current implementation plan priorities and strategies. This plan was posted publicly on www.chihealth.com/chna. A joint Community Health Needs Assessment was completed on behalf of the five Omaha Metro CHI Health hospitals (CUMC Bergan, Immanuel, Lakeside, Mercy Council Bluffs, and Midlands and one psychiatric inpatient facility (Lasting Hope Recovery Center), in partnership with the Health Departments of Douglas, Sarpy/ Cass and Pottawattamie and other local non-profits to satisfy regulatory compliance. The community identified the following priorities as top health needs through a review of primary data collected via the Community Health Survey and Key Informant Survey and additional community input sessions. A comprehensive examination of existing secondary data was completed and reviewed during the CHNA process for the Omaha Metro Area by PRC at the direction of the Douglas County Health Department, Sarpy/ Cass Department of Health and Wellness, Pottawattamie County Public Health Department and sponsoring health care organizations. A list of utilized sources can be found in the PRC complete report in the Appendix of the CHNA. In order to analyze data and determine priorities, standardized data was used for benchmarking, where appropriate. This was accomplished by reviewing trend data provided by PRC from previous Community Health Needs Assessments, Nebraska and Iowa Risk Factor Data, Nationwide Risk Factor Data, and Healthy People 2020. Top Health Needs (from 2018 CHNA): 1. Access to Healthcare Services 2. Cancer 3. Dementia & Alzheimer's Diseases 4. Diabetes 5. Heart Disease and Stroke 6. Injury and Violence 7. Mental Health 8. Nutrition, Physical Activity & Weight 9. Respiratory Diseases 10. Sexually Transmitted Diseases 11. Substance Abuse For this joint implementation strategy plan the hospital prioritized the following health needs. They represent strategies the hospital will either lead or participate in jointly with other CHI Health hospitals, (designated as a 'system' strategy below). Only strategies that are led or co-led by CHI Health Lakeside or CHI Health Midlands are reported below. Priority health needs and strategies are numbered to align with the published joint implementation plan at www.chihealth.com/chna: Priority Health Need #1: Behavioral Health To address this need the hospital will implement the following strategies in 2019-2021: *Provide support for individuals with Alzheimer's/ dementia and their caregivers (Lakeside/ system) *Participate in the Sarpy County Mental Health Problem-Solving Task Force (Midlands) *Support a tobacco coalition at CHI Health Midlands that leads policy, systems and environmental changes that reduce the burden of tobacco usage in the Omaha Metro *Lead policy/ advocacy efforts that expand access to behavioral health services (system) Priority Health Need #2: Social Determinants of Health To address this need the hospital will implement the following strategies in 2019-2021: *Financial support and promotion of Double Up Food Bucks, a Supplemental Nutrition Assistance Program (SNAP) incentive program (system) *Siembra Salud- 'Grow Wellness' a backyard garden, home visiting and education program designed to increase food access for low-income Latino residents in East Omaha (system) *Support Farmer's Markets nutrition education programs (system) *Provide funding and in-kind support for the implementation of the Share Our Table food security plan in the Omaha Metro (system) *Develop and test screening and referral processes for social needs (system) *Participate in internal and external Workforce Development efforts (e.g. Step Up summer internship program, Career Academy and Empowerment Network financial support) (system) Priority Health Need #3: Violence Prevention & Intervention To address this need the hospital will implement the following strategies in 2019-2021: *Expand the Forensic Nurse Examiner Program (formerly SANE) (system) *Align with state- level efforts to identify victims of human trafficking in healthcare settings and provide support resources (system) *Explore ongoing opportunities to promote Trauma Informed Care practices and align with Trauma Informed City Initiative (system) The hospital will not address the following health needs for the following reasons: Access to Healthcare Services- Access to care is a fundamental component of CHI Health's mission and strategy. This issue was not elevated to a priority for this particular plan because the intent was to identify additional strategies and initiatives that reach above and beyond CHI Health's typical business. For example, CHI Health has continued to expand its portfolio of primary care access points including extended clinic hours, Priority Care services (walk-in care), Quick Care, Virtual Care, and partnering with MedExpress for urgent care. Additional programs like MD Save, which allows patients to pre-purchase certain services at a discounted price, and the Medication Access Program (a prescription medication financial assistance program), are working to lower the cost of care to the consumer. In addition to providing the majority of care to the uninsured and underinsured in the Omaha Metro Area, CHI Health will continue to address access to healthcare services through financial support provided to the Magis Clinic, Hope Medical, federally qualified health centers- Charles Drew and One World Community Health Center- and through free health screenings and immunization clinics in the community. Cancer- CHI Health did not prioritize cancer as a top health need in order to focus and meaningfully impact other areas of need. The prioritized health needs above represent a concerted effort to focus on upstream efforts that may impact an individual's cancer risk, particularly lifestyle factors such as alcohol and substance abuse. CHI Health will continue to perform existing cancer outreach throughout the community and financially support community partners such as the American Cancer Society, the Nebraska Cancer Coalition and Project Pink'd. Additionally, CHI Health Clinics are working to increase utilization of HPV vaccination to prevent cervical cancer. Dementia and Alzheimer's Diseases- This need will be met through the behavioral health priority, which identifies, ""providing support for individuals with Alzheimer's/ dementia and their caregivers"" as a key activity. In addition, CHI Health Immanuel operates an inpatient and outpatient geriatric psychiatry program and recently opened a Neurological Institute. CHI Health provides financial support to the Nebraska Alzheimer's Association for free care consultation for families with a loved one who has recently received a dementia/ Alzheimer's diagnosis. Diabetes- CHI Health did not prioritize diabetes in order to focus and meaningfully impact other areas of need. CHI Health will continue performing diabetes outreach and education across the Omaha Metro Area, including through the integration of Certified Diabetes Educators into primary care clinics. See also Nutrition, Physical Activity & Weight Status for related activities. Heart Disease and Stroke- While this need was not prioritized specifically, the focus on substance abuse through the behavioral health priority will have an impact on behavioral risk factors for heart disease and stroke, such as alcohol and substance abuse. Additionally, CHI Health offers programming designed to mitigate risk factors for heart disease and stroke through Heart and Sole/ Heart Failure 101 and offering heart healthy cooking classes. CHI Health is a financial supporter of the American Heart Association. Nutrition, Physical Activity and Weight- This need will be addressed in part through the food access strategy under the Social Determinants of Health priority. There is significant existing work within CHI Health and the community to address nutrition, physical activity and weight status, such as the Healthy Families program, 5-4-3-2-1 Go!, Live Well Omaha, and free ""Get Cooking!"" classes offered at CHI Health Lakeside and CHI Health Midlands. Additionally, CHI Health provides financial support and in-kind contributions to organizations committed to this work, such as: City Sprouts, Big Garden/ ""Gather"" Mobile Kitchen Classroom, Live Well Omaha and the YMCA. Respiratory Diseases- CHI Health did not prioritize respiratory diseases in order to focus and meaningfully impact other areas of need.

This plan is posted publicly on www.chihealth.com/chna. The community identified the following priorities as top health needs through a MAPP process. Six needs were originally identified by NCDHD, and CHI Health prioritized the same needs as the community based on existing initiatives, potential for impact, and the interest of the community. Top Health Needs (from 2018 CHNA): 1. Aging 2. Mental Health 3. Nutrition, Physical Activity, & Weight 4. Screening for Chronic Disease 5. Substance Abuse 6. Youth Behaviors For this plan the hospital prioritized the following health needs: Priority Health Need #1: Behavioral Health (includes Mental Health and Substance Abuse) To address this need the hospital will implement the following strategies in 2019-2021: *Support internal and external efforts to promote mental health services and reduce substance abuse through early intervention and education by sustaining a behavioral health coalition to address behavioral health issues and connect service providers Priority Health Need #2: Chronic Disease Prevention, Detection and Management (includes Nutrition, Physical Activity & Weight Status) To address this need the hospital will implement the following strategies in 2019-2021: * Expand access to healthy foods and recreational opportunities and increase awareness of risk factors for chronic disease by aligning hospital efforts and financial support with Pierce County community partners. The hospital will not address the following health needs for the following reasons: In acknowledging the range of priority health issues that emerged from the CHNA process, CHI Health Plainview prioritized the health issues above in order to most effectively focus resources and meaningfully impact the selected health issues. The hospital took into consideration existing partnerships, available resources, the hospital's level of expertise, existing initiatives (or lack thereof), potential for impact, and the community's interest in the hospital engaging in that area in order to select the priorities.

In order to obtain input from the community, three initiatives were advanced: a Community Health Needs Assessment Steering Committee was convened, a community engagement survey was conducted, and several community conversations were held. The purpose of the CHNA Steering Committee is to support the CHNA process by engaging community members and providing feedback on the findings. All organizations involved with the CHNA Steering Committee have special knowledge of public health and underserved populations in the service area. Organizations involved in the Steering Committee are identified as having either a) conducted a previous Community Health Needs Assessment/Community Health Assessment due to IRS or accreditation requirements or b) already engaged in regional population health assessment. From January 2018 to April 2019 Steering Committee members served as key informants representing medically underserved, low- income or minority populations. The committee met bi-monthly to identify regional indicators and to inform the community engagement strategy for the creation of this document. Additionally, a survey to assess community health needs was conducted as part of the CHNA process during a six-week period between January and February 2019. One thousand one hundred (1100) individuals responded listing their top five health concerns. Seven Community Conversations occurred in March of 2019 as part of the CHNA process in which 60 individuals participated from all of the core jurisdictions. The purpose of the conversation was to elicit feedback from community members about publically available health data describing health conditions in the service areas and to review the survey results to further explore the findings. The top 10 health issues as identified from the survey results were presented to the attendees and they were asked to 1) rank the health issues according to which issues impacted them and the people close to them the most and 2) from a community perspective, rank the issues that should be addressed to improve the overall health of the region.

IN ACKNOWLEDGING THE WIDE RANGE OF HEALTH ISSUES THAT EMERGED FROM THE CHNA PROCESS, THE HOSPITAL DETERMINED IT COULD ONLY EFFECTIVELY FOCUS ON THOSE WHICH IT DEEMED MOST PRESSING, MOST UNDER-ADDRESSED, AND MOST WITHIN ITS ABILITY TO INFLUENCE. THE COMMUNITY HEALTH NEEDS THAT THE HOSPITAL IS UNABLE TO ADDRESS ARE: ACCESS TO SPECIALTY AND VISION CARE, CHRONIC KIDNEY DISEASE, DEMENTIA/ALZHEIMERS, CHILD ABUSE AND DOMESTIC VIOLENCE. THE HOSPITAL BELIEVES ACCESS TO SPECIALTY AND VISION CARE WILL BE ADDRESSED THROUGH REFERRALS FROM PRIMARY CARE PHYSICIANS. THE HOSPITAL BELIEVES THAT CHRONIC KIDNEY DISEASE WILL BE ADDRESSED THROUGH THE HEART FAILURE AND DIABETES INITIATIVES THAT WERE DEVELOPED. THE HOSPITAL BELIEVES THERE ARE SUFFICIENT COMMUNITY RESOURCES INCLUDING PRIMARY CARE PHYSICIANS TO DIAGNOSE AND NURSING HOMES AND MEMORY CARE FACILITIES TO TREAT DEMENTIA AND ALZHEIMERS. THE HOSPITAL COLLABORATES WITH THREE LOCAL NOT-FOR-PROFIT COMMUNITY AGENCIES (CHILDREN'S ADVOCACY CENTER, NORTHWEST CASA AND WINGS) TO ADDRESS CHILD ABUSE AND DOMESTIC VIOLENCE. THE HOSPITAL SUPPORTS THE EFFORTS OF OTHERS TO ADDRESS THESE AREAS AND WILL FOCUS ITS LIMITED RESOURCES ON THE MORE PREDOMINANT NEEDS IDENTIFIED.

Focus on health outreach and education Maryland Health Care Commission (MHCC) Rural Health Study During the 2016 Legislative Session, Senate Bill 707 Freestanding Medical Facilities- Certificate of Need, Rates and Definition (SB 707), passed into law and was signed by the Governor on May 10, 2016. The legislation established a workgroup on rural health care delivery to oversee a study of healthcare delivery in the Middle Shore region and to develop a plan for meeting the health care needs of the five counties -- Caroline, Dorchester, Kent, Queen Anne's and Talbot. The purpose of the study was to assess the health care of the residents of the five-county study area and the capacities of the health system in the region, and propose options for enhancing health and health care delivery on the Mid-Shore. The research team was asked to consider: (1) the limited availability of health care providers and services; (2) the special needs of vulnerable populations, including the frail and elderly, racial and ethnic minorities, immigrants and patients with persistent behavioral illnesses; (3) barriers to access caused by transportation limitations; and (4) the economic impact of closures, partial closures or conversions of health care facilities. The Summary Report provides highlights of findings from all components of the study and integrates them into key recommendations. Methods and findings are detailed for review at: http://mhcc.maryland.gov/mhcc/pages/home/workgroups/documents/rural_health/September%2025th%202017%20Meeting/lgsrpt_%20ExecutiveSummary_rpt_20170928.pdf The University of Maryland Medical System in partnership with UM Shore Regional Health as members of the Rural Health Care Delivery Workgroup produced a white paper, Commitment to Meeting the Health Care Needs of Our Vulnerable Rural Communities.

HSHS St. Elizabeth's Hospital completed a 10-month planning and implementation effort to develop the CHNA, identify and prioritize community health needs for its service area and formulate an implementation plan to guide ongoing population health initiatives with like-missioned partners and collaborators. The process and methods used to conduct the assessment required leveraging both internal and external individuals and groups. These planning and development activities included the following internal and external steps: HSHS St. Elizabeth's senior leadership engaged University of Illinois Survey Research Office, Springfield, Illinois, to provide quantitative and secondary data and community health data on the HSHS St. Elizabeth's service area. In addition, the team, along with members of the community benefits committee identified additional data sets to review and discuss. Additional data included the top 10 emergency department discharge diagnosis, the top 10 inpatient diagnosis and a review of two of the surveys that were conducted as part of the St. Clair County MAPP process (Mobilizing Action through Process and Partnerships). In addition, they took into consideration the information provided by the stakeholder community leader focus group. The team also reviewed the FY2015 CHNA. A core group of HSHS St. Elizabeth's colleagues provided valuable input for the FY2018 CHNA. This focus group discussed the data, shared insights from their perspective vantage points and identified their top three healthcare areas of focus. HSHS St. Elizabeth's Hospital also leveraged existing relationships that provided diverse input for a comprehensive review and analysis of community health needs in the hospital's service area. External components and steps included working in concert with the St. Clair County Health Department IPLAN process. In anticipation of the HSHS St. Elizabeth's CHNA, the hospital worked collaboratively with the St. Clair County Health Department as a partner to lead one aspect of the MAPP process. In addition, the hospital fully supported all aspects of the IPLAN development. St. Clair County hosted their annual Healthcare Policy Summit with keynote speaker Tyler Norris and a panel of regional health care leaders. The summit generated collective energy regarding the county health rankings and an unprecedented commitment by community leaders to get involved. This increased awareness by a broad section of the community offers great potential for further collaboration throughout the county. For the first time, two other local hospitals partnered with HSHS St. Elizabeth's to conduct a focus group on the perceptions of the health needs of St. Clair County residents from the perspective of community leaders. Community leaders were invited based on their awareness and expertise in the needs of our community. There was particular attention, roughly 30%, afforded to those who work with the underserved, low income, and minority populations.

Input from Members of Medically Underserved, Low Income and Minority Populations Hospital Sisters Health System and HSHS St. Elizabeth's Hospital are committed to promoting and defending human dignity, caring for persons living in poverty and other vulnerable persons, promoting the common good, and stewarding resources. We believe that the CHNA process must be informed by input from the poor and vulnerable populations we seek to serve. To ensure that the needs of these groups were adequately represented, we included representatives from Catholic Urban programs, St. Vincent DePaul East St. Louis, BEACON ministries, Karla Smith Foundation, St. Clair County 708 Mental Health Board, East Side Aligned, Programs and Services for Older Persons, and Age Smart. These organizations serve the under-resourced in our community, including low-income seniors, adults and children living in poverty, and persons with mental illness and substance abuse. Representatives of these organizations, who work 20 directly with their constituents, have extensive knowledge and quantifiable data regarding the needs of their service populations. Actively including these organizations in the CHNA process was critical to ensure that the needs of the most vulnerable persons in our communities were being shared and addressed in the CHNA process and development of related implementation strategies."

As a long-standing member of the St Clair County Health Commission, the hospital is aware of the poor county health rankings and the associated difficulty to gain support and traction regarding both the severity of the situation and the capacity to develop sustainable solutions for incremental improvement. In 2017, key community leaders inspired by the collective impact principles resolved to adopt an ""All In"" approach to address the county health issues and work with members of the Commission, such as HSHS St. Elizabeth's Hospital, to prepare the Community Health Improvement Plan (CHIP) for St Clair County. This approach led to the formation of a grassroots movement known as Healthier Together. The Healthier Together movement is 100% volunteer driven and governed by an independent Council of Partners whose members include leaders in healthcare, business, faith, education, and local government and social agencies. The movement seeks to support the efforts of six work groups comprised of over 85 volunteers representing 45 service organization, dedicated to working together to improve the health and quality of life in the following areas: - Chronic Disease - Community Safety - Education - Maternal and Infant Death - Mental Health - Substance Abuse HSHS St. Elizabeth's priority health needs align with the Healthier Together movement and the hospital is actively engaged in several workgroups as we align our implementation plan with the county and work collectively with other organizations to meet our goals and the county goals. Poverty is one issue that can affect our patients' health. It is an insidious, self-perpetuating problem that affects generations of families. Beginning in utero and continuing throughout an individual's life, poverty affects health via complex mechanisms. Life expectancy, learning abilities, health behaviors, and risks for developing disease are affected by poverty, as are education, employment, and lifestyle opportunities. The degree to which an individual's health outcome is affected is filtered by his or her level of ""host resistance"" to poverty. Poverty does not automatically determine an individual's health status, although it can significantly influence it. This distinction opens a door of opportunity at both the individual and population levels. Society can intervene to increase host resistance and mitigate poverty's negative effects on individual and population health by expanding access to health care, providing infrastructure that supports healthy habits, and promoting strategies to reduce poverty (AAFP, 2015). The poverty level of St. Clair County is 4% higher than the state, i.e. 18% of the population falls below 100% of the Federal poverty line while 35% fall below the 200% federal poverty line, thus creating barriers that influence health services, nutritional food, and other necessities that contribute to poor health status. Mental Health and Substance Abuse Mental health and Substance abuse is not only a county health issue but a national epidemic. The following data supports the impact of mental health and substance abuse on St. Clair County. The internal work group who selected our top priorities believed that poverty plays a factor in substance abuse. Of the four counties comprising the St. Elizabeth service area, only St. Clair County, at 18.23%, has a poverty rate higher than the state rate. This indicator is revealed because poverty creates barriers to access including health services, nutritional food, and other necessities that contribute to poor health status. In addition, suicide rates in St. Clair Counties were all higher than the state rate and the percent of Medicare Beneficiaries diagnosed with depression in the St. Elizabeth service area was higher than the state rate. When considering substance abuse, compared to the statewide density, there is a higher ratio of bars and drinking establishments per 100,000 people in the St. Elizabeth service area than the state as a whole - 11% higher. However, the data suggests that there are fewer beer, wine, or liquor stores in St. Elizabeth's service area. When assessing the data as it relates to students, cigarettes, alcohol, and marijuana usage are higher in the 12th grade when compared to the state. FY2019 Outcomes HSHS St. Elizabeth's is actively involved in the both the mental health and the substance abuse work groups in Healthier Together. A colleague attends the meeting for Drug Free Alliance and the Suicide Preventions Partnership. In FY2019, HSHS St. Elizabeth's sponsored two trauma informed care classes for more than 30 colleagues and held a community event hosted by the Alton Police Department Drug Task Force. The community learned about what drugs and drug paraphernalia look like and how to address this their community. More than 20 people who attended requested more information related to this topic. Through a grant, HSHS St. Elizabeth's partnered with Gateway Foundation to assist patients with drug and alcohol addiction. The goal of this partnership is to assist individuals who are substance abusers with the opportunity for rehabilitation. Patients who present to the Emergency Department with a drug or alcohol diagnosis are offered the opportunity to meet with a counselor and arrange for rehabilitation services. Recognizing that patients are frequent utilizers of health care resources, the counselor will work to develop a relationship with the patient and follow-up with them. This partnership was initiated at the end of FY2019. HSHS St. Elizabeth's worked diligently to coordinate and onboard the community health worker (CHW). As the regional EMS Resource Hospital, HSHS St. Elizabeth's is committed to provide Narcan training to our EMS community. Since becoming the EMS Resource hospital, the number of organizations that are part of our network significantly increased and there are more than 400 EMS personnel in our system to include many rural EMS teams. Narcan education was one of our first commitments to the network. This required hiring and training two community outreach educators, completion and certification of Narcan training, purchase of equipment, and the development policies and protocols that are compliant with the Illinois Department of Public Health (IDPH). This was completed toward the end of FY2019 and approximately 20 people persons received Narcan Training. HSHS St. Elizabeth's is viewed as a safe haven for support groups. Naranon meets weekly in our facility with new members joining every few weeks. This group grew over the past year with new members joining monthly. Alanon will begin a support group at the hospital in FY2020. Nutrition Nutrition impacts multiple areas of health including diabetes, obesity, food insecurity, food accessibility, and impact of diet on other chronic diseases such as heart and cardiovascular disease. Food insecurity is an indicator that reports the estimated percentage of the total population and the population under age 18 that experienced food insecurity at some point during the year but are ineligible for State or Federal nutrition assistance. The rate of food insecurity in children in HSHS St. Elizabeth's service area was higher than the local counties. Other factors that indicate nutrition is a health priority, include a 3% higher population that receive supplement nutritional assistance program (SNAP), a higher obesity rate than the state average, a decrease in consumption of fresh fruits and vegetables, and 31% of the residents live in a census tract identified as food deserts. Secondary effects of poor nutrition are also evident. Residents of St. Clair County have statistically higher cholesterol, blood pressure, and diabetes. FY2019 Outcomes To address this issue, the Chronic Disease Work Group and the Education Work Group (two of the six work groups that are part of the collective impact, Healthier Together) collaborated to provide nutrition and healthy lifestyles curricula to the summer camp program serving 365 K-6th grade students."

This collaboration included 200 hours of program planning, 96 hours of youth health literacy programming, 15 different agency partners, and 29 Southern Illinois University - Edwardsville (SIUE) School of Nursing student volunteers. The follow-up survey is pending. Working with the Belleville Old Town Market, HSHS St. Elizabeth's updated its strategy to address access to healthy food. As a member of the Chronic Disease Work Group, St. Elizabeth's assisted the Belleville Old Town Market to be able to accept EBT/LINK. The EBT Debit/Credit machine was secured through a special state grant. HSHS St. Elizabeth's provided funding for EBT promotion in the community and the purchase of EBT tokens and $5.00 vouchers for low income families and seniors on fixed incomes. The vouchers enabled participants to purchase an additional $5.00 of produce if they used the voucher on healthy foods such as fruits and vegetables. Data is not back on the totals since the market remains open. However, as the summer progressed the vendors noted an increased use of tokens and coupons as the marketing of the Old Town market spread. In May and June no tokens were used. However, vendors started seeing coupons and tokens in late July 2019. Infant Mortality Recognizing that poverty and other social determinants of health factors impact the delivery of a healthy baby, the local statistics identified smoking, little or no prenatal care, and sexually transmitted disease negatively affect infant mortality. The rate of infant mortality for St. Clair County was 8.2 per 100,000; during this same period the state rate was 7 per 1,000 live births while the Healthy People 2020 objective for infant mortality rate is 6.0 per 1,000 live births. In the St. Elizabeth service area, a significantly higher rate of infants are born to mothers who smoke than compared to the state rate. However, the data offered by the Illinois Department of Public Health had not been updated since 2008. In St. Clair County, 6.18% of mothers had late or no prenatal care; this is higher than the state rate of 5.4% of pregnant women who received late or no prenatal care. The teen birth rate per 1,000 females aged 15-19 for St. Clair County was 50 per 1,000 while the statewide rate was 30 per 1,000. The sexually transmitted disease prevalence rates in St. Clair County for chlamydia, gonorrhea, and syphilis were much higher than the state rate; 12.9/100,000 compared to 8.4/100.00 which also impacts infant mortality. FY2019 Outcomes A short-term goal related to infant mortality is to provide healthy and affordable food for woman and children. As a member of the Chronic Disease Work Group, HSHS St. Elizabeth's assisted the Belleville Old Town Market to be able to accept EBT/LINK. The EBT Debit/Credit machine was secured through a special state grant program. HSHS St. Elizabeth's provided funding for EBT promotion in the community and the purchase of EBT tokens and $5.00 vouchers for low income families and seniors on fixed incomes. The vouchers enabled qualified customers to purchase an additional $5.00 of produce if they used the voucher on healthy foods. Data is not back yet on the totals since the market remains open. However, as the summer progressed the vendors noted an increase use of tokens and coupons as EBT promotion at the Old Town Market spread. In May and June 2019, no tokens were used. However, vendors started seeing coupons and tokens in late July 2019. Another strategy related to infant mortality is safe sleep practices. In FY2019, St. Elizabeth's offered prenatal classes to mothers who will deliver at the hospital. Prenatal classes are also advertised at the Pregnancy Care Center (PCC), a resource for the underserved who are pregnant. The PCC is located on the St. Elizabeth's campus in Belleville, and St. Elizabeth's has supported the center for more than 25 years, providing resources to mothers and infants. Annually an event is held to educate the community about services at the hospital including prenatal classes, infant care and other community resources that support mothers and babies. The community is also encouraged to provide items to support the PCC during this very successful annual event. In addition, St. Elizabeth's Hospital was recently recognized by the National Safe Sleep Hospital Certification Program as a ""Bronze Safe Sleep Hospital"" for their commitment to best practices and education on infant safe sleep. St. Elizabeth's is the first and only hospital in the Metro East region to receive this recognition. While St. Elizabeth's Women and Infants Center always educates new mothers about the risk factors associated with infant mortality, we are working diligently within the hospital and with community partners to increase this important education and resources for mothers and families to improve these outcomes. HSHS St. Elizabeth's also partnered with SSM Health to educate pregnant mothers on safe sleep practices. The classes were held in the same building as the Pregnancy Care Center and at the end of the class the mothers receive a new Pack n' Play. Mothers who are in need are referred to the SSM educator and either scheduled for the HSHS St. Elizabeth's class or referred to a class that meets their needs. In addition to the three health needs selected as top priorities, an internal work group along with community members identified one other significant health need in St. Clair County. The internal work group spent quality time assessing the chart located on page 18 of the CHNA. This chart, a result of the feedback provided by the stakeholders, addressed the many needs of the community and ranked the needs according to the community's assessment of the ability to collaborate on a shared problem and the perceived impact this need has on the population. While mental health and substance abuse were selected, the group felt that violent crime and poverty were very much intertwined with substance abuse and mental health. In addition, the priority need of nutrition provided an overarching focus that encompasses obesity, food availability, diabetes, and cardiovascular disease. Infant mortality was selected as a priority because it is considered a result of the other two health needs. HSHS St. Elizabeth's will collaborate with multiple organizations to address these issues. The one priority health need that HSHS St. Elizabeth's will not address and measure will be resources needed for the elderly. Several other organizations that participated in the CHNA process do address elder care needs. While this issue will not be addressed by the hospital as a priority health need, we provide support for this community effort whenever possible. Organizations that support the elderly in the community include AgeSmart, Health Visions East, Programs and Services for Older Persons (PSOP), and the St. Clair Office on Aging. HSHS St. Elizabeth's provides monthly health education to seniors who are on a fixed income through the St. Clair office on Aging. Along with these efforts the hospital participates in health care events, some of which focus on the senior population."

THIS ORGANIZATION WORKED IN COLLABORATION WITH THE WALTER RAND INSTITUTE FOR PUBLIC AFFAIRS (""WRI"") AT RUTGERS UNIVERSITY-CAMDEN, AN INDEPENDENT RESEARCH AND CONSULTING FIRM TO CONDUCT THE CHNA. FOR THE PURPOSE OF THIS ASSESSMENT, COMMUNITY IS DEFINED AS THE THREE COUNTIES IN THE INSPIRA HEALTH NETWORK SERVICE AREA (GLOUCESTER, CUMBERLAND, AND SALEM COUNTIES). TO ACHIEVE THE GOAL OF OBTAINING LOCALLY ACTIONABLE INFORMATION FOR IMPROVING HEALTH, THIS CHNA EMPLOYED A MIXED-METHODS ITERATIVE STRATEGY OF DATA COLLECTION THAT COMBINED QUANTITATIVE AND QUALITATIVE ANALYSIS OF PRIMARY DATA COLLECTED FROM COMMUNITY MEMBERS WITH QUANTITATIVE ANALYSIS OF SECONDARY DATA. THE TWO FUNDAMENTALS OF OUR APPROACH ARE RIGOROUS DATA ANALYSIS AND COMMUNITY VOICE; TO THAT END, WE USED A VARIETY OF METHODS AND TOOLS TO ANALYZE THE DATA WE COLLECTED FROM PARTICIPANTS AND SOURCES IDENTIFIED THROUGH CONSULTATION WITH TRUSTED COMMUNITY PARTNERS IN EACH COUNTY. KEY INFORMANT INTERVIEWS ------------------------ KEY INFORMANTS WERE INTERVIEWED TO GATHER A COMBINATION OF QUANTITATIVE AND QUALITATIVE FEEDBACK THROUGH OPEN-ENDED QUESTIONS. KEY INFORMANTS WERE DEFINED AS COMMUNITY STAKEHOLDERS WITH EXPERT KNOWLEDGE AND INCLUDED PUBLIC HEALTH AND HEALTH CARE PROFESSIONALS, SOCIAL SERVICE PROVIDERS, NON-PROFIT LEADERS, BUSINESS LEADERS, FAITH-BASED ORGANIZATIONS, COUNTY GOVERNMENT, AND OTHER COMMUNITY LEADERS. 10 INTERVIEWS WERE CONDUCTED WITH KEY REPRESENTATIVES IN THE COUNTIES AND DESIGNATED INSPIRA HEALTH NETWORK STAFF. THE INTERVIEWS WERE COMPLETED USING A SEMI-STRUCTURED RESEARCH INSTRUMENT. THE PURPOSE OF THE RESEARCH PROJECT WAS EXPLAINED TO POTENTIAL PARTICIPANTS AND INFORMED CONSENT WAS OBTAINED PRIOR TO THE DATA COLLECTION PROCESS, FOLLOWING THE APPROVED IRB PROTOCOL. INTERVIEW PARTICIPANTS WERE ASKED TO THINK ABOUT AND SHARE THEIR PERSPECTIVES ON ACCESS TO CARE, HEALTH EDUCATION AND COMMUNICATION, AS WELL AS THE BARRIERS RESIDENTS FACE IN OBTAINING HEALTH CARE. OTHER AREAS OF INQUIRY INCLUDED THE STRENGTHS OF THE HEALTH CARE SERVICE DELIVERY SYSTEM AS WELL AS ITS WEAKNESSES AND POTENTIAL IMPROVEMENTS. BOTH THE RESEARCH INSTRUMENT AND THE PROTOCOL FOR THE INTERVIEW WERE DEVELOPED BASED ON THE GROUNDED THEORY APPROACH WITHIN THE QUALITATIVE RESEARCH FRAMEWORK. FOCUS GROUPS ------------ FOCUS GROUPS WERE CONDUCTED AMONG CUMBERLAND COUNTY RESIDENTS TO GATHER QUALITATIVE FEEDBACK REGARDING ACCESS TO CARE, KEY HEALTH ISSUES, AND HEALTH EDUCATION AND COMMUNICATION. WE CONDUCTED 13 DIFFERENT FOCUS GROUPS WITH COMMUNITY MEMBERS (N=10) AND STAKEHOLDERS (N=3) ACROSS THE THREE COUNTIES. OUR MAIN OBJECTIVE WAS TO GATHER THE COMMUNITY MEMBERS THOUGHTS ON HEALTH ISSUES (SUCH AS ACCESS TO CARE, HEALTH EDUCATION, AND COMMUNICATION) AND ANY BARRIERS RESIDENTS MAY CONFRONT IN OBTAINING CARE. ADDITIONAL AREAS OF INQUIRY INCLUDED THE STRENGTHS OF THE HEALTH CARE SERVICE DELIVERY SYSTEM AS WELL AS ITS WEAKNESSES AND POSSIBLE IMPROVEMENTS. THE FOCUS GROUP FORMAT ALLOWED COMMUNITY MEMBERS TO EXPRESS THEIR OPINIONS, SUGGESTIONS, AND RECOMMENDATIONS IN A CONFIDENTIAL FORMAT. BECAUSE THEY LIVE AND WORK WITHIN THE NETWORKS SERVICE AREAS, COMMUNITY MEMBERS INPUT IS CRUCIAL TO THE COMMUNITY HEALTH NEEDS ASSESSMENT PROCESS. FOCUS GROUPS PRODUCE A LARGE AMOUNT OF INFORMATION IN A SHORT TIME PERIOD. IN ADDITION, FOCUS GROUPS ELICIT WIDE-RANGING VIEWS ON DESIGNATED TOPICS. OUR FOCUS GROUPS CONSISTED OF A SEMI-STRUCTURED GROUP INTERVIEW. FOCUS GROUPS RANGED IN SIZE FROM 4-20 PARTICIPANTS. INFORMED CONSENT WAS OBTAINED AFTER THE PURPOSE OF THE FOCUS GROUP WAS EXPLAINED AND PRIOR TO THE DATA COLLECTION PROCESS, FOLLOWING THE APPROVED IRB PROTOCOL. ONE RESEARCH TEAM MEMBER FACILITATED THE FOCUS GROUP AND ONE TO TWO ADDITIONAL RESEARCH TEAM MEMBERS TOOK DETAILED NOTES. FOLLOWING EACH FOCUS GROUP, THE RESEARCH TEAM COMPILED A REPORT. COMMUNITY SURVEY ---------------- WE ALSO SOUGHT COMMUNITY ENGAGEMENT THROUGH THE WIDESPREAD DISSEMINATION OF A COMMUNITY SURVEY (N=891). THE SURVEY WAS COMPRISED OF 66 ITEMS, FORMATTED FOR ELECTRONIC AND PAPER DISTRIBUTION BOTH IN ENGLISH AND SPANISH. THE SPANISH SURVEYS WERE TRANSLATED FROM ENGLISH AND THEN BACK-TRANSLATED BY CERTIFIED TRANSLATORS ON THE RESEARCH TEAM. THE PARTICIPANT RESPONSE TIME WAS APPROXIMATELY 15 MINUTES FOR THE ELECTRONIC VERSION AND 30 MINUTES FOR THE PAPER VERSION. THE RESEARCH TEAM UTILIZED QUALTRICS, A WEB-BASED SURVEY PLATFORM, FOR THE DEVELOPMENT AND DISTRIBUTION OF THE ELECTRONIC FORMAT OF THE COMMUNITY SURVEY. SURVEY ITEM FORMATS INCLUDE MULTIPLE CHOICE; FILL IN, LIKERT SCALE, AND RANKING, THE SURVEY WAS LAUNCHED ON JUNE 8, 2018 AND CLOSED ON NOVEMBER 24, 2018 (24 WEEKS) AND WAS DESIGNED TO COMPLEMENT THE QUALITATIVE FOCUS GROUP AND INTERVIEW DATA TO PROVIDE A COMPREHENSIVE PICTURE OF THE HEALTH STATUS, NEEDS, AND RESOURCES AS IDENTIFIED BY RESIDENTS OF CUMBERLAND, GLOUCESTER, AND SALEM COUNTIES."

THE ORGANIZATION'S JOINT IMPLEMENTATION STRATEGY DESCRIBES THE COMMUNITY HEALTH NEEDS IDENTIFIED THROUGH THE ORGANIZATIONS CHNA. THROUGH THE ASSESSMENT OF ITS COMMUNITIES THE ORGANIZATION IDENTIFIED THE FOLLOWING KEY PRIORITIES: OBESITY, SUBSTANCE ABUSE, MENTAL HEALTH, ACCESS TO HEALTH CARE, AND TRANSPORTATION. THE ORGANIZATION INTENDS TO TAKE THE FOLLOWING ACTIONS WITH RESPECT TO EACH IDENTIFIED COMMUNITY HEALTH NEED. OBESITY ------- COMMUNITY MEMBERS RANKED OBESITY AS THE TOP HEALTH ISSUE IN THEIR COMMUNITIES. NATIONALLY, OBESITY IS ALSO A CONCERN, WITH HEALTH CARE COSTS AND MORTALITY RELATED TO OBESITY RAPIDLY OVERCOMING TOBACCO-RELATED COSTS/MORTALITY. SINCE 2000, THE ADULT OBESITY RATE IN NEW JERSEY HAS INCREASED BY OVER 60%. THIS PERIOD HAS ALSO SEEN AN INCREASE IN THE BURDEN OF OBESITY-RELATED DISEASES SUCH AS DIABETES, HYPERTENSION, AND HEART DISEASE. PROJECTIONS FOR THE CHRONIC DISEASE BURDEN RELATED TO OBESITY ARE DIRE, WITH AN EXPECTED FOUR-FOLD INCREASE IN THE NUMBER OF HEART DISEASE CASES WITHIN THE NEXT 20 YEARS. EVEN MORE TROUBLING IS THAT OBESITY AND RELATED CHRONIC HEALTH CONDITIONS OCCUR AT HIGHER RATES IN SOUTHERN NEW JERSEY THAN THEY DO IN THE REST OF THE STATE AND NATIONALLY. INSPIRA HEALTH COMMITS TO DEVELOPING AND/OR SUPPORTING INITIATIVES WITH THE FOLLOWING OBJECTIVES IN MIND: - IMPLEMENT COMMUNITY EDUCATION PROGRAMS RELATED TO NUTRITION AND PHYSICAL ACTIVITY - IMPROVE ACCESS TO HEALTHY FOOD THROUGH CHARITABLE CONTRIBUTIONS, EMPLOYEE VOLUNTEER OPPORTUNITIES, AND INNOVATIVE COMMUNITY PARTNERSHIPS - IDENTIFY RISK FACTORS FOR CHRONIC DISEASE THROUGH EARLY DETECTION AND SCREENINGS - INCREASE RESIDENTS AWARENESS OF RISK FACTORS FOR CHRONIC DISEASE SUBSTANCE ABUSE --------------- IN 2017, THE GOVERNOR OF NEW JERSEY DECLARED OPIOID ABUSE A PUBLIC HEALTH CRISIS IN THE STATE. COMMUNITY MEMBERS ALSO EXPRESSED INTENSE CONCERN ABOUT SUBSTANCE ABUSE, THE LACK OF RESOURCES TO COMBAT SUBSTANCES ABUSE, AND THE IMPACT OF SUBSTANCE ABUSE ON FRIENDS AND FAMILY MEMBERS. INSPIRA HEALTH COMMITS TO DEVELOPING AND/OR SUPPORTING INITIATIVES WITH THE FOLLOWING OBJECTIVES IN MIND: - PREVENT PATIENTS FROM BECOMING ADDICTED TO PAIN MEDICATIONS - IDENTIFY PATIENTS WHO ARE ADDICTED TO MEDICATIONS - DECREASE OVERDOSES AND DRUG-INDUCED DEATHS - INCREASE TOBACCO SCREENING IN HEALTH CARE SETTINGS - REDUCE ED UTILIZATION FOR SUBSTANCE ABUSE-RELATED ISSUES MENTAL HEALTH ------------- THE RATES OF SUICIDE ARE INCREASING IN GLOUCESTER, SALEM, AND CUMBERLAND COUNTIES. RATE OF SUICIDE IS HIGHER THAN STATE RATE IN GLOUCESTER, SALEM, AND CUMBERLAND COUNTIES. RESIDENTS REPORT A HIGH NUMBER OF POOR MENTAL HEALTH DAYS. COMMUNITY MEMBERS SAID THAT MENTAL AND BEHAVIORAL HEALTH WERE IMPORTANT ISSUES FACING THEIR COMMUNITIES IN GENERAL, AND THEMSELVES SPECIFICALLY. INCREASE ACCESS TO MENTAL HEALTH TREATMENT IS INCLUDED AMONG THE HEALTHY PEOPLE 2020 OBJECTIVES. INSPIRA HEALTH COMMITS TO DEVELOPING AND/OR SUPPORTING INITIATIVES WITH THE FOLLOWING OBJECTIVES IN MIND: - PARTICIPATE IN COMMUNITY PLANNING PROCESS TO ADDRESS BEHAVIORAL HEALTH AND ACCESS TO SERVICES - INCREASE AWARENESS AND IDENTIFICATION OF MENTAL HEALTH DISORDERS - INCREASE SCREENING FOR BEHAVIORAL HEALTH NEEDS IN PRIMARY CARE AND SPECIALTY CARE SETTINGS - WORK WITH AREA HOSPITALS TO DEVELOP A RANGE OF COLLABORATIVE APPROACHES TO IMPROVE THE CARE OF THE PATIENTS WITH BEHAVIORAL HEALTH CONDITIONS - INCREASE THE PROPORTION OF ADULTS WHO RECEIVE MENTAL HEALTH TREATMENT - INCREASE THE PROPORTION OF HOMELESS ADULTS WHO RECEIVE MENTAL HEALTH SERVICES - REDUCE ED UTILIZATION FOR MENTAL HEALTH RELATED ISSUES - PROVIDE EDUCATION ABOUT WARNING SIGNS OF MENTAL/BEHAVIORAL HEALTH CONDITIONS TRANSPORTATION -------------- COMMUNITY MEMBERS REPORTED THAT PUBLIC TRANSPORTATION WAS AN IMPORTANT MISSING RESOURCE AND THAT ACCESS TO RELIABLE TRANSPORTATION WAS AN IMPORTANT BARRIER TO CARE. ACCESS TO RELIABLE TRANSPORTATION IS IMPORTANT FOR PEOPLE WITH CHRONIC DISEASES. RESEARCH SUGGESTS THAT FOR INDIVIDUALS WITH LIMITED ECONOMIC RESOURCES, TRANSPORTATION TO PROVIDER VISITS AND PHARMACIES MAY BE A SIGNIFICANT BARRIER TO CARE THAT CAN ALTER HEALTH OUTCOMES. INSPIRA HEALTH COMMITS TO DEVELOPING AND/OR SUPPORTING INITIATIVES WITH THE FOLLOWING OBJECTIVES IN MIND: - DEFINE GAPS IN PROCESS, PROCEDURE, AND INFRASTRUCTURE - IMPLEMENT FREE-OF-CHARGE NON-EMERGENT TRANSPORTATION TO PATIENTS WITH ACCESS PROBLEMS TO MEDICAL CARE - COMPLETE SOFTWARE INTEGRATION WITH PROVIDERS FOR COORDINATION OF TRANSPORTATION INSPIRA HEALTH WILL NOT TAKE ACTION ON THE FOLLOWING HEALTH NEED: ACCESS TO HEALTH CARE LACK OF FACILITIES OR PROVIDERS GENERALLY, LACK OF FACILITIES OR PROVIDERS WAS A STRONG CONCERN FOR COMMUNITY MEMBERS IN SALEM COUNTY, AND MUCH LESS OF A CONCERN FOR COMMUNITY MEMBERS IN GLOUCESTER AND CUMBERLAND COUNTIES. INSPIRA HEALTH WILL CONTINUE TO ACKNOWLEDGE THE IMPACT OF THIS HEALTH NEED AND REMAIN COMMITTED TO THE ISSUES THEY REPRESENT.

TWENTY-THREE (23) COUNTY OR DISTRICT-LEVEL PUBLIC HEALTH DEPARTMENTS RESPONDED BY SURVEY, AND THE CHNA TEAM ALSO RECEIVED SURVEY RESPONSES FROM 5 CITY-LEVEL HEALTH DEPARTMENTS. NINETY-SIX NONPROFIT ORGANIZATIONS COMPLETED SURVEYS, AND THEY SERVED RESIDENTS IN EVERY COUNTY. TOTAL RESPONSE FAR EXCEEDED THE LEVEL OF RESPONSE EXPERIENCED THREE YEARS EARLIER FOR THE 2016 CHNAS IN CINCINNATI AND DAYTON. PRIMARY DATA WAS OBTAINED, WITH A UNIFORM SET OF QUESTIONS, VIA THE FOLLOWING: * THERE WERE 42 MEETINGS, HELD IN 23 COUNTIES DURING MAY THROUGH JULY 2018, WHICH ATTRACTED 463 REPRESENTATIVES OF COMMUNITY ORGANIZATIONS, THE GENERAL PUBLIC, AND/OR MEMBERS OF MEDICALLY UNDERSERVED AND VULNERABLE POPULATIONS TO IDENTIFY BARRIERS TO CARE, GIVE INPUT FOR CURRENT NEEDS ASSESSMENT, PRIORITIZE ISSUES, AND IDENTIFY RESOURCES TO ADDRESS HEALTH AND HEALTH-RELATED ISSUES. * ONLINE SURVEYS OF INDIVIDUALS (828), AGENCIES (96), AND PUBLIC HEALTH DEPARTMENTS (28) THROUGHOUT THE REGION FROM JUNE THROUGH AUGUST 2018. * THE REPORTING HOSPITAL DID NOT RECEIVE WRITTEN COMMENTS FROM THE PUBLIC REGARDING THE 2016 CHNA OR ITS RELATED IMPLEMENTATION STRATEGY. COMMUNITY MEETINGS OUTREACH ANY INDIVIDUAL OR AGENCY REPRESENTATIVE WHO GAVE THEIR ADDRESS DURING THE 2013 OR 2016 CHNA PROCESS WAS ADDED TO AN INVITE LIST, AND THE HEALTH COLLABORATIVE (THC) MAILED THEM AN INVITATION TO THE MEETING SCHEDULED IN THEIR COUNTY. THE CONSULTANTS ADDED NONPROFIT ORGANIZATIONS IN EACH COUNTY THAT HAD EITHER A PHONE NUMBER, STREET ADDRESS, OR EMAIL. THC SENT 544 EMAILS AND 376 LETTERS BY FIRST-CLASS MAIL. THE CONSULTANTS MADE PHONE CALLS TO AGENCIES THAT HAD NOT PREVIOUSLY ATTENDED A CHNA MEETING AS WELL AS TO STRATEGIC ORGANIZATIONS THAT SERVE VULNERABLE POPULATIONS AND/OR HAVE A BROAD REACH, E.G., UNITED WAY. THEY FOLLOWED UP WITH EMAILS. THC SENT FLYERS TO HOSPITALS AND TO MEETING HOST SITES FOR POSTING AND DISTRIBUTION. THE CONSULTANTS ALSO POSTED UPCOMING MEETINGS EVERY TWO WEEKS IN THE INTERACT FOR HEALTH E-NEWSLETTER: HEALTH WATCH, WHICH IS EMAILED ACROSS 20 COUNTIES. THE CONSULTANTS SENT FLYERS TO PUBLIC HEALTH DEPARTMENTS TO POST AND DISTRIBUTE. SOME HEALTH DEPARTMENTS PUBLICIZED MEETINGS ON THEIR SOCIAL MEDIA PAGES AND HELD ADDITIONAL MEETINGS. THERE WAS A 229% INCREASE IN MEETING ATTENDANCE, FROM 202 FOR THE 2016 CYCLE TO 463 FOR THE 2019 CYCLE. APPENDIX 1 OF THE CHNA, WHICH IS POSTED TO TRIHEALTH'S WEBSITE, INCLUDES A LIST OF MEETING ATTENDEES AND THE ORGANIZATIONS EACH REPRESENTS.PURPOSE OF MEETINGS THE PURPOSE OF THE MEETINGS WAS TO SOLICIT PUBLIC INPUT. THE DESIRE WAS TO ATTRACT INDIVIDUALS OR NONPROFIT ORGANIZATIONS WITH EXPERIENCE OR KNOWLEDGE TO SHARE, ESPECIALLY ON EMERGING ISSUES NOT CAPTURED BY THE SECONDARY DATA AND FROM THE PERSPECTIVES OF MEDICALLY UNDERSERVED, MINORITY, AND/OR LOW-INCOME POPULATIONS. THE OBJECTIVES WERE TO: * SHARE COUNTY-LEVEL HIGHLIGHTS FROM THE SECONDARY DATA (AND CITY-LEVEL FOR CINCINNATI HEALTH DEPARTMENT MEETINGS) * GATHER DIVERSE PEOPLE TO SHARE THEIR IDEAS -- GENERAL PUBLIC AND COMMUNITY LEADERS * RECEIVE INPUT FROM AGENCIES THAT REPRESENT VULNERABLE POPULATIONS * HEAR CONCERNS AND QUESTIONS ABOUT EXISTING HEALTH/HEALTH-RELATED ISSUES * OBTAIN INFORMATION ABOUT FINANCIAL AND NON-FINANCIAL BARRIERS TO HEALTH CARE * IDENTIFY RESOURCES AVAILABLE LOCALLY TO ADDRESS ISSUES * OBTAIN INSIGHT INTO LOCAL CONDITIONS FROM LOCAL PEOPLE * DISCOVER HEALTH AND HEALTH-RELATED PRIORITIES OF ATTENDEES MEETING FACILITATION A GROUP OF 2-3 CONSULTANTS WENT TO EACH MEETING, DEPENDING ON THE NUMBER OF RSVPS. EACH MEETING FOLLOWED THE SAME FORMAT AND AGENDA. REFRESHMENTS WERE SERVED, AND NAMETAGS WERE USED TO GENERATE A WELCOMING ATMOSPHERE. LOCATIONS WERE SELECTED FOR CONVENIENCE, ACCESS, AND TRUSTED REPUTATION IN THE COMMUNITY. THE FACILITATOR FIRST SHARED GENERAL TRISTATE AND STATE-SPECIFIC HEALTH AND HEALTH-RELATED DATA TO PROVIDE CONTEXT. THE SURVEY QUESTIONS WERE USED, BUT THE FIRST QUESTION ABOUT MOST SERIOUS HEALTH ISSUES WAS ASKED SEPARATELY. THIS TECHNIQUE WAS INTENDED TO CAPTURE FIRST THOUGHTS WITHOUT AN OPPORTUNITY TO BE INFLUENCED BY THE MORE SPECIFIC COUNTY-LEVEL DATA OR BY OTHER ATTENDEES. AFTER THE FIRST QUESTION, THE CONSULTANTS (A MEETING FACILITATOR AND AT LEAST ONE SCRIBE) SHARED A PROFILE OF THE COUNTY, INCLUDING A SUMMARY OF SECONDARY DATA. THE MEETINGS LASTED 90 MINUTES, OF WHICH 60 MINUTES WAS DEVOTED TO THE GROUP'S BRAINSTORMING. AT THE END, EACH PERSON WAS GIVEN 3 COLORED DOTS. THEY PLACED THE DOTS NEXT TO ISSUES THEY PRIORITIZED AS MOST IMPORTANT HEALTH CONDITIONS OR NEEDS OF THE COMMUNITY. THE AGENDA HANDOUT CONTAINED LINKS TO THE SURVEYS. SURVEYS THE CONSULTANTS DEVELOPED THREE TYPES OF SURVEYS: INDIVIDUAL CONSUMER; AGENCY; AND HEALTH DEPARTMENT. THE QUESTIONS REMAINED THE SAME FOR EACH SURVEY. THE AGENCY SURVEYS WERE PUSHED OUT VIA EMAIL AS WELL AS THE LINK WAS SHARED AT THE COMMUNITY MEETINGS. THE HEALTH DEPARTMENT VERSION ALSO REQUESTED THE QUALIFICATIONS OF THE RESPONDENTS. AS REQUIRED BY THE IRS, THE INDIVIDUAL CONSUMER SURVEY WAS ALSO TRANSLATED INTO SPANISH AND ADAPTED FOR MOBILE APPLICATION AT COMMUNITY EVENTS. THE CONSULTANTS USED SURVEYMONKEY TO COLLECT RESPONSES, TABULATE DATA, INTERPRET AND ANALYZE RESULTS, AND CREATE CATEGORIES TO TRACK KEY WORDS AND PHRASES. PAPER COPIES (TRANSLATED) WERE USED WITH SPANISH-SPEAKING FAMILIES, REFUGEES FROM RWANDA, AND AT TREATMENT FACILITIES. BOTH TRIHEALTH OUTREACH MINISTRIES AND SANTA MARIA COMMUNITY SERVICES PROVIDED THE ANSWERS ALREADY TRANSLATED INTO ENGLISH FOR THE CONSULTANTS. A TOTAL OF 113 IMMIGRANT SURVEYS WERE COMPLETED AND RETURNED. SEE APPENDIX 2 FOR THE SURVEY RESPONDENTS WHO IDENTIFIED THEMSELVES. APPENDIX 3 OF THE CHNA, WHICH IS POSTED TO TRIHEALTH'S WEBSITE, HAS A LIST OF HEALTH DEPARTMENT RESPONDENTS WITH THEIR QUALIFICATIONS.SECONDARY DATA SOURCES DATA COLLECTION COUNTY HEALTH RANKINGS (CHR) FORMED THE FOUNDATION FOR DATA COLLECTION WITH ITS COUNTY-LEVEL FOCUS ON HEALTH OUTCOMES, HEALTH FACTORS, HEALTH BEHAVIORS, QUALITY OF LIFE, CLINICAL CARE, PHYSICAL ENVIRONMENT, AND SOCIOECONOMIC FACTORS. ADDITIONAL SOURCES SUPPLEMENTED THE CHR DATA. PUBLICLY AVAILABLE HEALTH STATISTICS AND DEMOGRAPHICS WERE OBTAINED AT THE STATE AND COUNTY LEVEL. THE EPIDEMIOLOGISTS FOR PUBLIC HEALTH - DAYTON & MONTGOMERY COUNTY (PHDMC) VOLUNTEERED TO COLLECT DATA FOR THE STATE OF OHIO AND ITS COUNTIES. THEY INCLUDED DATA THROUGH 2016. OHIO'S 2017 DATA WAS NOT AVAILABLE IN TIME FOR THIS REPORT. THE NUMBER OF DATA MEASURES INCREASED BY 33%, FROM 106 IN 2016 TO 142 IN 2019. DATA SOURCES THE STANDARDS FOR RESEARCHING AND INCLUDING DATA WERE: * COMPARABLE (MEASURES WITH BENCHMARKS SUCH AS HEALTHY PEOPLE 2020 OR STATE/NATIONAL RATES) * COUNTY-LEVEL DATA (ZIP CODE LEVEL PREFERRED BUT RARE) * FOCUS ON HEALTH OUTCOME DATA (PREFERRED OVER SUBJECTIVE SURVEY DATA WHEN BOTH WERE AVAILABLE) * REPRODUCIBLE (NEW UPDATE AVAILABLE WITHIN THREE YEARS OR AT 3-YEAR INTERVALS VS. ONE-TIME) * REPUTABLE SOURCE * TREND DATA AVAILABLE (MORE THAN ONE DATA POINT; 3-5 YEARS PREFERRED) THE CHR WAS AN EXCELLENT STARTING POINT, BUT THE CONSULTANTS DISCOVERED ADDITIONAL SOURCES WITH MORE RECENT DATA AS WELL AS INDICATORS FOR MEASURES NOT COLLECTED BY CHR. THE PREVALENCE OF CERTAIN CANCERS, THE RAPID INCREASE OF HEROIN OVERDOSE DEATHS IN THE REGION, AND ADDITIONAL MORTALITY DATA ARE EXAMPLES OF SUPPLEMENTAL DATA. MANY EXCELLENT SOURCES OF INFORMATION DID NOT HAVE A BREAKDOWN BELOW THE STATE LEVEL OR DID NOT INCLUDE THE ENTIRE REGION. THE CONSULTANTS CONTACTED STATE HEALTH DEPARTMENTS, LOCAL HEALTH DEPARTMENTS, AND LOCAL EXPERTS. THE BIGGEST CHANGE FROM THE PRIOR CYCLE IS THAT THE DEPARTMENT OF HEALTH AND HUMAN SERVICES NO LONGER MAINTAINS THE HEALTH INDICATORS WAREHOUSE AS AN ONLINE SOURCE, AND IT HAD PROVIDED DATA FOR EIGHT KEY MEASURES. PHDMC EPIDEMIOLOGISTS CONSULTED THE OHIO DATA FOR DATA RANGES ENDING WITH 2016 AND ONE PERIOD PRIOR. DUE TO CHARACTER LIMITATION IN THE SOFTWARE, THESE DATA SOURCES COULD NOT BE INCLUDED IN THIS EXPLANATION. HOWEVER, THE DATA SOURCES AND DATES CAN BE FOUND ON PAGES 12 AND 13 OF THE CHNA POSTED ON TRIHEALTH'S WEBSITE."

Crowe has significant healthcare experience including providing services to hundreds of large healthcare organizations across the country. NorthShore has conducted a CHNA using primary and secondary data, to ensure community benefit programs and resources are focused on significant health needs as perceived by the community at large, as well as alignment with NorthShore's mission, services and strategic priorities. NorthShore obtained input from 44 leaders representing public health, major employers, public schools, social services, NorthShore leaders and the community at-large through two focus groups and one-on-one interviews. Primary input was also obtained by conducting an online community health survey distributed to members of the community. Additionally, health needs assessments prepared by four local health departments serving the NorthShore community were also reviewed and considered. Secondary data was assessed including: Demographics (population, age, sex, race), Socioeconomic indicators (household income, poverty, unemployment, educational attainment), Health access indicators, Community health status indicators (causes of death, chronic conditions, health behaviors, etc.), and Availability of health care facilities and resources. Community input was obtained through two focus groups and seven interviews with key stakeholders. The first focus group was conducted with members of NorthShore's community advisory committees representing twenty-eight organizations. The attendees included health care providers, social service providers, public health agency representatives, local government agency leaders, and small business organizations working throughout the NorthShore service area. The organizations represented included the City of Evanston-Department of Health, Moraine Township, CJE Senior Life, NAMI Cook County North Suburban, Deerfield Parent Network, Niles Township High School District 219, Erie Family Health Center, Northbrook Chamber of Commerce, Evanston Fire Department, Northfield Township, Evanston/Skokie School District 65, Northwest Suburban United Way, Faith in Action, Peer Services, Family Services of Glencoe, Skokie Police Department, Frisbie Senior Center, St. Philip Lutheran Church, Glenbrook South High School, Terry Performance Group, Glenview Chamber of Commerce, Tri-Con Child Care Center, Great Lakes Adaptive Sports Association, Turning Point Behavioral Health, Lake County Health Department, Village of Glenview, McGaw YMCA, and Village of Skokie, Health Department.

A second focus group was conducted with leaders from NorthShore's staff representing a wide range of departments, including Emergency Medicine, Kellogg Cancer Center, Nursing, Cardiology, Psychiatry and Behavioral Health, Neurology, Managed Care, and Infection Control. The group discussed prominent health and wellness issues, barriers and assets to health in the communities NorthShore serves, and potential strategies to address barriers to community health and well-being. Community input was also obtained through an electronic survey distributed to the community. Identified health needs were then prioritized taking into account community perception regarding the significance of each identified need as well as the ability for NorthShore to impact overall health based on alignment with NorthShore's mission and services provided.

The assessment used both primary and secondary research to illustrate and compare health trends and disparities across the region. Primary research solicited input from key community stakeholders representing the broad interests of the community, including experts in public health and individuals representing medically underserved, low-income, and minority populations. Secondary research identified demographic and health trends across geographic areas and populations. The Cooper Board of Trustees met on December 21, 2016 to review the findings of the CHNA and the recommended implementation strategy. The board voted to adopt the final summary report and the implementation strategy and provide the necessary resources and support to carry out the initiatives therein. The 2019 Community Health Needs Assessment was completed in July 2019. The report and the implementation strategy are set to be approved by the Board of Directors in December 2019. Question 5: The Burlington, Camden, Gloucester, and Ocean County Health Departments participated in the design and completion of Cooper's Community Health Needs Assessment, including meetings to identify and prioritize health needs. Specific research methods: - A review of secondary health and socioeconomic indicators for the service area. - An analysis and comparison of hospital utilization data. - Partner forums with community representatives and leaders to identify community health priorities and facilitate population health strategy collaboration. - Focus groups with health consumers. Question 6: The Health Assessment Collaborative included the following partners: Cooper University Hospital, Deborah Heart and Lung Center, Kennedy Health System, Lourdes Health System, Virtua Health, and the Health Departments of Burlington, Camden, Gloucester, and Ocean Counties. Question 7A & 10A: WWW.COOPERHEALTH.ORG/about-us/community-health-needs-assessment - The implementation strategy is on pages 17 & 18. Question 11: A voting system based on the criteria of scope, severity, and ability to impact was used to help participants in the assessment prioritize local health needs. The prioritized list of health needs is as follows: 1. behavioral health and chronic disease comorbidities 2. linkages to care - access 3. substance abuse Cooper is addressing the significant needs identified in the recently conducted CHNA as follows: Behavioral health/chronic disease comorbidities: -creation of an advanced care center with implementation of an innovative multidisciplinary group visit model -Patients with similar diagnoses meet together and learn best practices of care together -community education programs and support groups linkages to care - access: -partnered with a third party vendor to assist patients in completing applications for financial assistance, medicaid, etc. -trained staff as certified application counselors to assist patients in obtaining insurance -launched urgent care services in three locations -implemented dedicated schedule slots with primary care physicians to ensure available follow-up appointments for patients within two weeks after hospital discharge Substance abuse: -implemented standardized, systematic mental health screening for all patients admitted to Cooper -launched an initiative to address the gaps in behavioral health resources and identify partnership opportunities in service provision -hosted and supported many community events in collaboration with the county's addiction awareness task force Rationale for community health needs not specifically addressed: Cooper recognizes that partnerships with community agencies have the broadest reach to improve community health issues. While additional disease specific and population specific needs were identified, the group found that other resources, such as the Southern New Jersey Perinatal Cooperative and disease specific resources were available and the health systems would be more effective in utilizing the available resources in addressing the prioritized needs.

Listed below are a sample of activities related to the priorities identified in the 2016 CHNA: 1. IMPROVE COORDINATION OF CARE FOR GRADY PATIENTS WITH DIABETES, HYPERTENSION, PROSTATE CANCER, HIV/AIDS AND BEHAVIORAL HEALTH CONDITIONS. GRADY LAUNCHED AN INTEGRATED BEHAVIORAL HEALTH PROGRAM WHICH PLACES LICENSED THERAPISTS AND HEALTH COACHES IN PRIMARY CARE CENTERS AND SEVERAL SPECIALTY CLINICS TO OFFER REAL TIME SERVICES DURING VISITS. THE BEHAVIORAL HEALTH TEAM ASSESSES AND TREATS PATIENTS, AND PROVIDES EXPERT GUIDANCE TO PRIMARY CARE PHYSICIANS ON MEDICATION USE, SIDE EFFECTS, AND TREATMENT PRACTICES. IN 2018, THE BEHAVIORAL HEALTH TEAM CONDUCTED OVER 2,500 VISITS WITH PRIMARY CARE PATIENTS. THIS COLLABORATION REDUCES THE STIGMA OF MENTAL HEALTH CARE AND IS PART OF OUR HOLISTIC APPROACH TO PATIENT HEALTH. IN 2018, GRADY LAUNCHED THE TRANSITIONS OF CARE CLINIC (TOC) FOR NEWLY DISCHARGED PATIENTS AT HIGH RISK OF READMISSIONS. ELIGIBLE PATIENTS ARE IDENTIFIED, VISITED BY A TOC NAVIGATOR, AND SCHEDULED FOR A VISIT IN THIS CLINIC WHILE IN THE HOSPITAL. THE MULTI-DISCIPLINARY TEAM ASSISTS THE PATIENT WITH A RANGE OF MEDICAL AND SOCIAL NEEDS FROM SCHEDULING APPOINTMENTS, TRANSPORTATION, MEDICATION MANAGEMENT, AND SUCCESSFUL TRANSITION TO ONGOING PRIMARY CARE. THE GEORGIA CANCER CENTER FOR EXCELLENCE AT GRADY CONTINUES TO IMPROVE NURSE NAVIGATION SERVICES AND PATIENT-CENTERED CARE THROUGH THE ALLIANCE TO ADVANCE PATIENT-CENTERED CANCER CARE AND PLANETREE DESIGNATION PROCESS. SINCE STARTING THIS WORK, THE CANCER CENTER HAS ACHIEVED REDUCTIONS IN AVERAGE TIME FROM DIAGNOSIS TO TREATMENT FOR PRIORITY CANCER SITES, DECLINES IN APPOINTMENT NO-SHOW RATES, AND MORE THAN 200 PATIENTS HAVE RECEIVED NUTRITION COUNSELING FROM A REGISTERED DIETITIAN DURING TREATMENT. GRADY HAS REMAINED COMMITTED TO COMMUNITY COLLABORATION THROUGH THE ATLANTA REGIONAL COLLABORATIVE FOR HEALTH IMPROVEMENT (ARCHI). GRADY HAS REPRESENTATION ON THE STEERING COMMITTEE AND HAS CONTINUED TO PARTICIPATE IN THE DIABETES HOSPITAL COLLABORATIVE LAUNCHED IN 2016. THROUGH THIS EFFORT, GRADY AND PARTNER HEALTH SYSTEMS, WELLSTAR AND MERCY, ARE IMPLEMENTING DIGITAL DIABETES SELF-MANAGEMENT EDUCATION (DSME) AND TELEPHONIC COACHING. 2. INCREASE OPPORTUNITIES FOR ALL GEORGIANS, WITH A FOCUS ON PERSONS SERVED BY GRADY HEALTH SYSTEM, TO ACCESS HEALTHCARE COVERAGE. GRADY HAS ENGAGED A NUMBER OF RESOURCES TO ASSIST PATIENTS IN GAINING ACCESS TO MEDICAID AND OTHER PUBLIC BENEFITS. IN 2018, GRADY SUBMITTED MORE THAN 11,000 MEDICAID APPLICATIONS FOR PATIENTS. THROUGH OUR FOOD AS MEDICINE PARTNERSHIP, THE ATLANTA COMMUNITY FOOD BANK AND WHOLESOME WAVE GEORGIA SUBMITTED 257 MEDICAID APPLICATIONS AND 814 SNAP APPLICATIONS ON BEHALF OF GRADY PATIENTS. 3. INCREASE PATIENT AND COMMUNITY ENGAGEMENT IN HEALTHY BEHAVIORS TO PREVENT DIABETES, HYPERTENSION, HIV, UNINTENTIONAL INJURIES, AND HOMICIDE. GRADY LAUNCHED THE TALK WITH ME BABY (TWMB) PILOT PROGRAM DESIGNED TO IMPROVE LANGUAGE DEVELOPMENT IN THE FIRST YEARS OF LIFE. NURSES ARE TRAINED TO EDUCATE CAREGIVERS ON THE IMPORTANCE OF TALKING WITH A BABY EVERY DAY, AND PARENTS ARE TAUGHT ABOUT IMPORTANT MILESTONES TO MONITOR A CHILD'S LANGUAGE DEVELOPMENT. OVER 2,100 GRADY STAFF MEMBERS HAVE RECEIVED TWMB TRAINING, AND MORE THAN 1,700 MOTHERS, MOTHERS-TO-BE AND FAMILY MEMBERS HAVE PARTICIPATED IN TWMB EDUCATION. OF THE MOTHERS WHO RECEIVED FULL TWMB TRAINING, 78% INDICATE AN UNDERSTANDING OF THE LASTING EFFECTS ON LANGUAGE AND NUTRITION, WHILE 80% OF MOTHERS TRAINED HAVE COMMITTED TO SPEAKING 15 MINUTES PER WAKING HOUR WITH THEIR BABY. MANY PROGRAMS ESTABLISHED IN PREVIOUS YEARS CONTINUE TO EXPAND AND IMPROVE INCLUDING THE FOOD AS MEDICINE PARTNERSHIP, WALK THE LINE, CARDIFF, AND PIVOT. THE FOOD AS MEDICINE PARTNERS, WHOLESOME WAVE GEORGIA, OPEN HAND, AND THE ATLANTA COMMUNITY FOOD BANK, BEGAN FUNDRAISING FOR THE ONSITE FOOD PHARMACY, TEACHING KITCHEN, AND HEALTHY MARKET. PARTNERS ALSO GREW THE FRUIT AND VEGETABLE PRESCRIPTION (FVRX) PROGRAM TO MORE THAN 100 PATIENTS IN 2018, AND SUCCESSFULLY TRANSITIONED TO THE PROGRAM INTO THE MEDICAL NUTRITION THERAPY DEPARTMENT TO SUPPORT SUSTAINABILITY. FINALLY, ONSITE SNAP SCREENING AND ENROLLMENT EXPANDED TO THREE GRADY CLINICS. IN PARTNERSHIP WITH THE ATLANTA BELTLINE, GRADY OFFERS A COMMUNITY-BASED WELLNESS PROGRAM, WALK THE LINE. IN 2018, ABOUT 60 COMMUNITY MEMBERS PARTICIPATED IN THE PROGRAM AND A MAJORITY ACHIEVED HEALTH IMPROVEMENTS BY THE END OF THE 10 WEEKS. GRADY HAS COMMITTED TO CONTINUING THIS PROGRAM AFTER THE PILOT GRANT ENDED IN 2018. BOTH THE CARDIFF AND PIVOT PROGRAMS ARE WORKING TO REDUCE INJURY AND VIOLENCE IN THE COMMUNITY. IN 2018, GRADY HIRED A CARE RESOURCE COORDINATOR TO WORK WITHPATIENTS IMPACTED BY VIOLENCE WITH THE GOAL OF PREVENTING RETALIATION. THE LOWER PRIORITIES OF GRADY'S 2016 CHNA-LOW BIRTH WEIGHT, OBESITY, BREAST CANCER, POVERTY, AND HIGH SCHOOL EDUCATION NON-ATTAINMENT-WERE NOT INCLUDED AS AREAS OF FOCUS FOR SEVERAL REASONS. FIRST, GRADY ALREADY OFFERS A ROBUST CENTERING PROGRAM TO ADDRESS LBW AS WELL AS CONTINUOUSLY WORKING TO IMPROVE OUR SERVICES FOR BREAST CANCER. FOR THE OTHER PRIORITIES, GRADY DOES NOT HAVE THE RESOURCES OR EXPERTISE TO SIGNIFICANTLY ADDRESS THESE COMMUNITY HEALTH NEEDS. FINALLY, OTHER ARCHI PARTNERS WITH THE RESOURCES AND EXPERTISE ARE LEADING VARIOUS INITIATIVES TO ADDRESS THESE NEEDS."

201923199349311942,951643359,"SCHEDULE H, PART V, SECTION B, LINE 11","Community Health Needs Prioritized St. Joseph Hospital Orange will address the following priority areas as part of its FY18-FY20 CB Plan/Implementation Strategy Report: - Access to Care for the Uninsured and Underinsured - Mental Health - Diabetes/Obesity/Food and Nutrition Access to Care for the Uninsured and Underinsured is a concern that emerged in both the data and through community input. Although the data used for the CHNA do not reflect the most recent enrollments due to the Affordable Care Act, they show that rates of uninsured children and adults were slightly higher in the TSA than for Orange County. Rates in parts of Santa Ana and Anaheim were especially high. Community input focused on the challenges people face with using insurance, talking about the cost of premiums and co-pays, the difficulty navigating an unfamiliar health care system, and the need for linguistically and culturally sensitive care. Access to Care tied with Mental Health as the top priority after the first 3 steps of the prioritization process. Mental Health received the most votes by far at the community forum and was tied with Access to Care as the top priority after the first 3 steps of the prioritization process. Mental health, and specifically stress and depression, was linked to many other issues such as economic challenges, housing, and immigration. Community members also noted the continued stigma associated with mental illness and the difficulties they face navigating the mental health system and finding culturally appropriate mental health services. Emergency Room usage rates for mental health reasons are extremely high in lower-income areas of Santa Ana and Anaheim. Diabetes/Obesity/Food and Nutrition were originally considered as separate issues but combined by the Community Benefit Committee. The Committee agreed that these three significant health needs had enough correlation and a ""cause and effect"" implication among them that by addressing one or two, we could essentially address all three. While the overall rate of diabetes in the TSA is similar to Orange Countys rate (7.8% in the TSA compared to 7.4% in the County), the rate in the PSA is higher (8.7%). Certain communities have much higher rates of diabetes, ranging from 10.2% to 11.9% in Westminster and Garden Grove. Rates in Santa Ana and Anaheim hover between 9 and 10 percent. The data on overweight and obesity shows the TSA has slightly higher rates than Orange County (24.2% of teenagers in the TSA are overweight or obese compared to 20.9% across the county), but those rates are below the California rate of 33.1%. The highest rates of overweight and obesity in teenagers in the PSA were found in Santa Ana and Anaheim, where the highest rate was 29.0%. Data on obesity in adults showed a similar pattern, with more than 25% of the adult population considered obese in some zip codes of Santa Ana and Anaheim, compared to 20.3% in the TSA and 18.4% in Orange County. Concerns about Food and Nutrition, a root cause of diabetes and obesity, were raised both in the data and through community input. The data shows high rates of food insecurity, especially in the PSA (11.3% compared to 6.8% in Orange County) and the PSA communities of Santa Ana and Anaheim (as high as 22.6% in one zip code area of Santa Ana). Concerns about the cost, availability, and ease of preparing healthy food compared to abundant, cheap, and quick unhealthy options were raised at all of the focus groups and the community forum. Needs Beyond the Hospitals Service Program No hospital facility can address all of the health needs present in its community. We are committed to continue our Mission through community benefit programs and by funding other non-profits through the St. Joseph Health Community Partnership Fund. As previously mentioned, St Joseph Hospital will endorse local non-profit organization partners to apply for funding through the St. Joseph Health Community Partnership fund. Local nonprofits that receive funding provide specific services and resources to meet the identified needs of underserved communities throughout St. Joseph Hospitals service areas. The following community health needs identified in the St. Joseph Hospital CHNA will not be addressed and an explanation is provided below: Housing concerns: The hospital does not directly address housing needs. However, we support and endorse grant applications to the St. Joseph Health Community Partnership Fund Emergency Food and Shelter Initiative for several local central Orange County community based organizations. In addition, the hospital will be available to support maintenance/custodial services to the new Mercy House project to convert the Sisters of St. Joseph Mother House into affordable housing units for women and children. Language and Cultural Barriers: The hospital does not directly address language and cultural needs except to patient population. The hospital provides cultural competency training for its employees. However, these trainings are not open to the public. Economic Insecurity: The hospital does not directly address the effects of poverty and economic concerns. However, the hospital partners with Taller San Jose Hope Builders to support their graduating participants secure employment by providing pre-employment health screenings. Immigration Status: The hospital does not directly address immigration issues. However, La Amistad Family Health Center (SJNHC) partners with the Public Law Center in referring patients who request immigration services. Furthermore, SJO may disclose Protected Health Information to Law enforcement including the US Immigration and Customs Enforcement (ICE) for the following purposes only: a) Injury resulting from a deadly weapon or from other criminal act; b) Rape or other sexual assault. Access to Resources: The hospital does not directly offer access to resources in general. However, a Patient Advocate is stationed in the Emergency Care Center to assist low income underserved persons seeking care to enroll in appropriate and affordable health insurance programs and social services programs. In addition, we support and endorse grant applications to the St. Joseph Health Community Partnership Fund for several local central Orange County community based organizations seeking funds to address access to health and social services resources. Public Safety: The hospital does not directly address issues around public safety. However, we support and endorse grant applications to the St. Joseph Community Partnership Fund Community Building Initiative for local community based organizations who directly address these social and infrastructure issues. Without this funding, these organizations would not be able to sustain and/or further their work in this area. Parks: The hospital does not directly address the provision of parks in the community. However, we support and endorse grant applications to the St. Joseph Community Partnership Fund- Community Building Initiative for local community based organizations who directly address these social and infrastructure issues. Without this funding, these organizations would not be able to sustain and/or further their work in this area. In addition, St. Joseph Hospital will collaborate when feasible with organizations that address aforementioned community needs, to coordinate care and referral to address these unmet needs."

IN ADDITION, IN CONJUNCTION WITH IPRO, NYP/BMH NOW HOSTS SIX-SESSION DIABETES MANAGEMENT EDUCATION SEMINARS, OFFERED SEVERAL TIMES A YEAR. CLINICALLY, NYP/BMH ALSO OFFERS A COMPREHENSIVE WEIGHT MANAGEMENT PROGRAM. In 2018, we shifted priorities from Childhood obesity/promoting healthy women infants and children to Increasing access to high-quality chronic disease preventive care and management in clinical and community settings. We had set out to provide exercise classes as an intervention with our original priority area, but space in a high-need neighborhood became hard to secure, so we shifted to a focus area where we could achieve measurable outcomes while still addressing chronic diseases in vulnerable communities. AS A RESULT OF THE FINDINGS IN THE COMMUNITY HEALTH NEEDS ASSESSMENT, NYP/BMH HAS ALSO DEVELOPED A FALL PREVENTION PROGRAM, WHICH SEEKS TO GIVE OLDER ADULTS THE CONFIDENCE AND TOOLS THEY NEED TO HELP THEM AGE SAFELY. THE PROGRAM INCLUDES SEMINARS ON HOME SAFETY, HEALTHY LIVING, AND AVOIDING FALLS, GIVEN BY EXPERTS IN TRAUMA AND INJURY PREVENTION, ENVIRONMENTAL GERONTOLOGY, AND PUBLIC HEALTH. THESE SEMINARS ARE OFFERED AT NYP/BMH, AS WELL AS AT VARIOUS SITES THROUGHOUT BROOKLYN. IN ADDITION, TWO STAFF MEMBERS HAVE BEEN TRAINED IN STEPPING ON AND TWO HAVE BEEN TRAINED IN MATTER OF BALANCE. THESE ARE BOTH EVIDENCE-BASED PROGRAMS THAT PROMOTE BALANCE AND BEHAVIORAL CHANGE AMONG SENIORS WHO HAVE AN INCREASED FEAR OF, OR RISK OF FALLING. IN 2017, THE HOSPITAL EXPERIENCED SOME DIFFICULTIES WITH OUR COLLABORATING PARTNER, IN THAT WE WERE NOT ABLE TO USE THEIR DATA TRACKING SOFTWARE AND THEREFORE COULD NOT IMPLEMENT ANY CLASSES IN 2017. THE HOSPITAL HAS NOW DECIDED TO COLLECT THE DATA MANUALLY. One Stepping On class was hosted in the fall of 2018, for which 8 seniors were trained by physical therapists and other health professionals in fall prevention. All participants had better mobility and increased self-confidence. While the course curriculum was well-received, the format was not conducive to being repeated by staff members whose roles are not dedicated to this type of work. We will revisit other evidence-based interventions for fall prevention in 2019, such as Tai Chi for Arthritis or Matter of Balance. NYP/BMH ALSO PROVIDES ALL PARTICIPANTS IN ANY FALL PREVENTION ACTIVITIES WITH A FALL PREVENTION KIT, EQUIPPED WITH A VARIETY OF EFFECTIVE ITEMS (EG., NIGHTLIGHT, GLOWTAPE, NON-SKID SOCKS, ETC.) TO HELP SENIORS SAFEGUARD THEMSELVES WITHIN THEIR HOMES. IN 2017, THE HOSPITAL ADDED PROMOTING HEALTHY WOMEN, INFANTS AND CHILDREN WITH A FOCUS ON MATERNAL AND INFANT HEALTH, AS AN ADDITIONAL PRIORITY TO THEIR EXISTING INTERVENTIONS. NYP/BMH IS ON THE JOURNEY TO BECOMING A BABY-FRIENDLY USA HOSPITAL IN COLLABORATION WITH OTHER BROOKLYN HOSPITALS AND THE DOHMH, WHICH PROMOTES BEST PRACTICES IN INFANT-FEEDING AND CARE. OUR GOAL IS TO INCREASE EXCLUSIVE BREASTFEEDING RATES AT DISCHARGE. THE HOSPITAL IS ALSO SEEKING TO ADDRESS DISPARITIES BY OFFERING ADDITIONAL SUPPORT GROUP CLASSES IN UNDERSERVED NEIGHBORHOODS WHERE BREASTFEEDING RATES ARE STATISTICALLY LOWER. SEVERAL MAJOR STUDIES HAVE INDICATED THAT, ALONG WITH OTHER BENEFITS OF BREASTFEEDING, BABIES WHO ARE BREASTFED FACE A LOWER RISK OF CHILDHOOD OBESITY. In 2018, we have kept a strong following at our weekly Breastfeeding Support Group. We continue to participate in community events centered on breastfeeding and womens health. We have also recruited some former patients as volunteer breastfeeding champions who help with the community education piece at outreach events. We hope to continue to provide education to expectant parents and expand our reach to neighborhoods where we have a large number of newborn discharges. We are also currently looking at ways to operationalize offering an additional support group in a high-need neighborhood. IN ADDITION TO THE SPECIFIC NEED AREAS IDENTIFIED IN THE CHNA, WE CONTINUE TO PROVIDE A GENERAL COMMUNITY OUTREACH PROGRAM WHICH HOSTS ROUGHLY 350 ANNUAL EVENTS, FEATURING HEALTH LECTURES AND SUPPORT GROUPS TARGETING VARIOUS HEALTH CONCERNS, INCLUDING CANCER, HEPATITIS C, STROKE, AND PULMONARY HYPERTENSION.

The facilities serve a diverse population in Westchester County and share an authorized body which adopted the assessment in 2018. The St. John's CHNA was developed during 2016 in collaboration with the Westchester County Department of Health's 'Health and Hospital Planning Teamthe Montefiore Hudson Valley Collaborative Performing Provider System (PPS) Hospital Group, and referenced the 'One Region, One CNA' - An Eight County Community Needs Assessment Undertaken in Collaboration With: Westchester Medical Center, Montefiore Medical Center, Refuah Health Center and Health Alliance of the Hudson Valley, December 2016. The Westchester County Department of Health (WCDOH), http://health.westchestergov.com/, and the Montefiore Hudson Valley Collaborative PPS, http://www.montefiore.org/hudson-valley-collaborative, Community Health Needs Assessments, which meet both IRS and NYS needs assessment and service plan requirements, contain more detailed information and data on the health status of the population and distribution of health issues based on analysis of demographic factors and identification of the main health challenges facing the community; as well as a discussion of the contributing causes of these challenges, including broad determinants of health. Our partner sessions gave the opportunity for area hospitals to discuss NYS Prevention Agenda priorities, feedback from their public needs assessments, services provided, gaps in service and best practices. While all hospitals in Westchester County share the same priorities, each hospital selected priorities that aligned with their mission, were attainable, and created a program that best suited its institution and patient service area. The public input process also encompassed collaboration with the following partners: City of Yonkers/SJRH's Healthy Yonkers Initiative and the SJRH community advisory committee. A multidisciplinary group was involved in assessing community health needs in Westchester County with public participation solicited via a survey sponsored by the WCDOH and community partners. The collaborative process was beneficial in researching current health data, conducting health needs assessments within our communities, sharing of best practice interventions and leveraging of resources. To determine the most pressing health needs of our community, we surveyed members of the medically underserved, low-income, and minority population in the SJRH service area, who represent the health interests of our patients and their families. St. John's leadership also considered its own resources, strengths, and abilities in the selection of SJRH's priority community needs. To help support and coordinate this collaboration, the WCDOH invited all Westchester hospitals to attend a kick-off meeting in April 2017. To support in the selection of priorities the WCDOH's Health and Hospital Planning Team held collaborative meetings from April through November 2017. The collection of primary data from a sample of the Westchester County residents was an important element of the development of the Community Health Needs Assessment. SJRH engaged with the WCDOH's on-line Community Resident and Provider Health Surveys to facilitate the implementation of the data collection process. We identified the following partners to help implement interventions identified in our community health needs ASSESSMENT: Hudson River HealthCare FQHC, Hudson Community Health Alliance's Local IMPACT Initiative, primary practice offices, Cancer Coalition of Westchester, Healthy Yonkers Initiative, SJRH Behavioral Health Services, SJRH Community Advisory Team, Westchester County Department of Health and the Montefiore Hudson Valley Collaborative. Our planning team also conducted a survey of selected stakeholders representing health care and service-providing agencies within the county. The purpose of the study was to provide feedback from community service providers in order to: 1) guide strategic planning, 2) highlight topics for increased public awareness, 3) identify areas for training, and 4) inform the statewide Prevention Agenda. The survey was developed through a collaborative effort by an eighteen-member survey committee representing county public health department and local hospitals during the spring-summer of 2017. A total of 1,318 community surveys and 218 provider surveys were conducted May 16 to June 30, 2017. To ensure a broad assessment of our community health needs, we engaged a variety of participants including, but not limited to, the community-at-large through local residents participating in SJRH speaker's bureau's health education programs. We shared health data and sought feedback through the following SJRH groups: community advisory committee, pastoral care committee, physician alignment committee, radiology advisory committee, wellness committee, board of trustees and our employees. SJRH also gathered information from external sources by conducting public forums at the Cross County Shopping Center in Yonkers, New York and other health sessions held at select locations to address the community that represented the diverse population that we serve. We plan to provide ongoing opportunities for hospitals and other stakeholders, i.e. community-based organizations, to strategize on how to address health priorities. We will also work with partners to provide more refined data to track and evaluate progress in achieving goals related to selected priorities. SJRH will continue to communicate with other community-based organizations regarding advocacy, participation in local community events, and exchange of referral information. Engaging local community members in our efforts enables us to involve our health care institution and the community in the activities of national health advocacy organizations, including walks, fairs, and other awareness-raising activities for health issues that impact the community.

To gather community input the Community Health Needs Assessment team disseminated a community survey with the purpose of identifying a general overview of the most concerning health topics. The survey included over 900 respondents, a 173% increase over the last CHNA cycle and an immediate benefit of collaborating with community partners. In addition, the team hosted two health forums, facilitated 7 community focus groups, and conducted eight interviews with local healthcare, social service, and civic leaders. Respondents who participated in this phase included experts in the field of public health, hospital administration members, community outreach groups, and other local organizations. Using feedback from the survey, interviews and focus groups, a summary of community input was created. This summary would eventually be used to help focus in on priorities and ultimately, implementation strategies."

THIS 2019 ASSESSMENT COMBINES MORE THAN 140 HOSPITAL AND COMMUNITY DATA INDICATORS AS WELL AS FEEDBACK FROM STAKEHOLDERS AND THE BROADER COMMUNITY. THIS PROCESS RESULTED IN THREE PRIORITIES: LUNG DISEASE, CARDIOVASCULAR DISEASE AND MENTAL HEALTH. WEAVING AMONG THE ISSUES IDENTIFIED WERE FIVE COMMON THREADS: ACCESS TO HEALTH CARE, MENTAL HEALTH, PHYSICAL ACTIVITY, SOCIAL DETERMINANTS OF HEALTH AND TOBACCO USE. ADDITIONALLY, THE HEALTH STATUS OF POPULATIONS OF INTEREST - SUCH AS PEOPLE IN POVERTY, MINORITIES AND THE ELDERLY--WERE ALSO ANALYZED. RECOGNIZING THE VALUE OF ASSESSING AND ACTING TOGETHER ON LOCAL HEALTH ISSUES, KEY PLAYERS FROM LOCAL HOSPITAL SYSTEMS, PUBLIC HEALTH ENTITIES, AND OTHERS FORMED A WORKING GROUP TO BEGIN THE TASK OF A REGIONAL HEALTH ASSESSMENT. THIS GROUP GREW UNDER THE UMBRELLA OF THE LOCAL OZARKS HEALTH COMMISSION (OHC) AND PUBLISHED THE FIRST ASSESSMENTS IN 2016.

INCREASE PATIENT ENGAGEMENT IN CHRONIC CONDITION SELF-MANAGEMENT -THE CENTER FOR HEALTH IMPROVEMENT EMPLOYS A SKILLED TEAM OF HEALTHCARE PROFESSIONALS WHO DELIVER SUPPORT AND EDUCATION FOR CHRONIC DISEASE MANAGEMENT, MEDICAL NUTRITION THERAPY, AND ADVANCE CARE PLANNING. THEY PROVIDE TOOLS DESIGNED TO INCREASE SELF- MANAGEMENT OF CHRONIC CONDITIONS INCLUDING DIABETES, AUTOIMMUNE DISORDERS, METABOLIC SYNDROME, AND MORE. -IN THE FIRST QUARTER CALENDAR YEAR 2018, A CURRENT STATE ASSESSMENT OF THE CENTER FOR HEALTH IMPROVEMENT WAS CONDUCTED TO DETERMINE THE EFFICACY OF VARIOUS PROGRAMS. AS A RESULT OF THE ASSESSMENT, THE TEAM REFINED THE SCOPE OF OFFERINGS TO AN EVIDENCE-BASED, TARGETED PROGRAM SUITE THAT FOCUSES HEAVILY ON IMPROVING CHRONIC CONDITION MANAGEMENT OF PATIENTS. -IN ADDITION TO THE PROGRAMS ALREADY OFFERED, THE CENTER FOR HEALTH IMPROVEMENT ADDED A NEW SIX-WEEK, EVIDENCE-BASED COURSE FOCUSED ON CHRONIC PAIN CONDITIONS. -THE NURSING EDUCATION DEPARTMENT AND THE JOINT REPLACEMENT EDUCATORS AT MEYER ORTHOPEDIC CENTER DEVELOPED A PROCESS TO INCREASE TIGR VIDEO EDUCATION VIEWS. MANDATORY EDUCATION WAS EXPANDED TO INCLUDE ALL ADULT PATIENTS WITH A DIAGNOSIS OF PNEUMONIA, HEART FAILURE, ACUTE MI, TOTAL HIP/KNEE REPLACEMENT, OR COPD TO HELP ACHIEVE BEST OUTCOMES WHILE REDUCING READMISSIONS. -TIGR VIDEO VIEWS INCREASED FROM 4,694 VIEWS IN MAY 2018 TO 6,284 IN MAY 2019. 2. REDUCE AVOIDABLE HOSPITAL READMISSIONS - COXHEALTH NURSING ADMINISTRATION BEGAN TRAINING NURSES ON LIGHT DUTY TO COMPLETE PATIENT READMISSION INTERVIEW FORMS IN 2018. WHEN A PATIENT IS READMITTED WITHIN THIRTY DAYS, A CASE MANAGER MEETS WITH THE PATIENT TO DISCUSS THE READMISSION. TOPICS COVERED IN THE INTERVIEW INCLUDE: >FREQUENCY OF GOOD COMMUNICATION IN THE HOSPITAL REGARDING DIAGNOSIS AND MEDICATIONS. >COMMUNICATION ABOUT DISCHARGE INSTRUCTIONS AND ABILITY TO UNDERSTAND INSTRUCTIONS. >MEDICATION COMPLIANCE AND REASONS FOR ANY DIFFICULTY REMAINING COMPLIANT. >FOLLOW UP APPOINTMENTS WITH A PCP BEING SCHEDULED AND ATTENDED. >REASONS FOR READMISSION, FROM THE PATIENTS PERSPECTIVE. >>THE INFORMATION GATHERED BY THE CASE MANAGER COMES DIRECTLY FROM THE PATIENT AND IS ENTERED INTO REPORTABLE FIELDS THAT ALLOW FOR DATA COLLECTION. COMMON THEMES FOR AVOIDABLE READMISSIONS WILL BE EASIER TO IDENTIFY AND PREVENT THROUGH THIS PROCESS. -EVIDENCE-BASED BEST PRACTICES TO REDUCE AVOIDABLE READMISSIONS HAVE BEEN IMPLEMENTED AND CONTINUE TO EXPAND. >COXHEALTH HIRED TRANSITIONAL CARE PHARMACISTS WHO DEDICATE THEIR TIME WORKING WITH PATIENTS BEING DISCHARGED TO ENSURE THE PATIENT LEAVES THE HOSPITAL WITH THEIR MEDICATIONS. >NEW EFFORTS ARE IN PLACE TO INCREASE THE NUMBER OF PATIENTS WHO LEAVE THE HOSPITAL WITH THEIR MEDICATIONS THROUGH THE USE OF A FOCUSED, FAST-PACED I-90 PROJECT. >THE CLINIC SUPPORT TEAM HAS BEEN INSTRUMENTAL IN SCHEDULING FOLLOW-UP APPOINTMENTS WITH PATIENTS. THE MAJORITY OF INPATIENT UNITS ARE COVERED BY THE CLINIC SUPPORT TEAM, WHICH MEANS MOST PATIENTS HAVE A FOLLOW UP APPOINTMENT SCHEDULED PRIOR TO LEAVING THE HOSPITAL. >A SUBGROUP COMPRISED OF FRONTLINE STAFF, LEADERS, AND QUALITY IMPROVEMENT EXPERTS HAS BEEN FORMED TO FOCUS SPECIFICALLY ON REDUCING HEART FAILURE READMISSIONS. THE GROUP WILL USE DATA TO INFORM DECISIONS ON HOW TO BEST MANAGE OUR PATIENTS WITH FREQUENT INPATIENT STAYS DUE TO HEART FAILURE. 3. INCREASE ACCESS TO TOBACCO CESSATION RESOURCES FOR PATIENTS AND FAMILIES PRESENTING TO OUR HOSPITALS AND CLINICS -AN ASSET ASSESSMENT AND GAP ANALYSIS OF THE SYSTEMS TOBACCO TREATMENT OFFERINGS WAS CONDUCTED. RECOMMENDATIONS FROM THAT ASSESSMENT INCLUDED CREATION AND IMPLEMENTATION OF A CLEARLY OUTLINED REFERRAL PROCESS AND DEFINED RESOURCES AND PROMOTION OF THE ASK, ADVISE, ACT/REFER MODEL TO INITIATE INTERVENTION. -IN MAY 2018, WE PROVIDED TRAINING TO 12 KEY COXHEALTH STAFF MEMBERS AND 3 COMMUNITY EDUCATORS. COMPLETION OF THE UMASS MEDICAL SCHOOL EDUCATION CURRICULUM, REQUIRED EXAMS, AND PRACTICE HOURS MADE CLASS PARTICIPANTS ELIGIBLE FOR CERTIFICATION AS TOBACCO TREATMENT SPECIALISTS. AS A RESULT OF THIS EDUCATION, THE NUMBER OF CESSATION RESOURCES AVAILABLE WITHIN THE SYSTEM INCREASED. THE TRAINING WILL BE OFFERED AGAIN IN OCTOBER 2019 TO FURTHER INCREASE RESOURCES. -THE QUIT RATE FOR OUR TOBACCO CESSATION PROGRAM HAS CONTINUED TO SHOW POSITIVE RESULTS SINCE ITS INCEPTION IN 2013, WITH THE CURRENT QUIT RATE FOR 2019 TO DATE AT 64%. AVERAGING ACROSS THE HISTORY OF THE PROGRAM, THE AGGREGATED QUIT RATE IS 55%. -DUE TO THE SUCCESS OF THIS PROGRAM, FOLLOWING THE STONE AND TANEY COUNTY MFH TOBACCO GRANTS END ON MAY 31, 2018, WE WERE ABLE TO HIRE A FULL TIME TOBACCO CESSATION COORDINATOR WHO IS RESPONSIBLE FOR COORDINATING SYSTEM EFFORTS TO STANDARDIZE POLICIES AND REFERRAL PROCESSES ACROSS ALL CAMPUSES AND SETTINGS. 4. DECREASE CHILDHOOD OBESITY -THE CARDIAC KIDS PROGRAM IS IMPLEMENTED IN 13 RURAL SCHOOLS IN THE COXHEALTH SERVICE AREA. ITS MAIN OBJECTIVE IS TO SCREEN 5TH GRADE STUDENTS FOR HEALTH INDICATORS THAT PUT THEM AT HIGH RISK FOR DEVELOPING CARDIAC DISEASE. SCREENING BY COXHEALTH STAFF INCLUDES HEIGHT AND WEIGHT MEASUREMENT, BMI CONSULT, AND HEALTH/NUTRITION EDUCATION. -APPROXIMATELY 400 CHILDREN ARE SCREENED ANNUALLY. THOSE WHO ARE DEEMED HIGH RISK ARE REFERRED TO THE COMMITTED TO KIDS PROGRAM. THIS 8-WEEK PROGRAM IS AN INTENSIVE INTERVENTION FOR AT-RISK CHILDREN AND THEIR FAMILIES FOCUSING ON HEATHY BEHAVIOR AND NUTRITION EDUCATION. 5. INCREASE THE NUMBER OF WOMEN WHO BREASTFEED THEIR INFANTS AFTER DELIVERY -COXHEALTH AND THE SPRINGFIELD-GREENE COUNTY HEALTH DEPARTMENT ARE CURRENTLY ENGAGED IN A COMMUNITY BREASTFEEDING COALITION WITH THE GOAL OF STRATEGICALLY ALIGNING EFFORTS TO HELP MOVE THE CHIP INITIATIVE FORWARD. -IN ADDITION TO EDUCATION PRESENTED IN OUR GENERAL PRENATAL CLASSES, THE COXHEALTH LACTATION CONSULTANTS FACILITATE A MONTHLY BREAST FEEDING SUPPORT GROUP CALLED THE LACTATION CLUB. -THE ANNUAL COXHEALTH BABY FAIR IS A FREE EVENT THAT FEATURES VENDOR DISPLAYS, DEMONSTRATIONS, DOOR PRIZES, AND CLASSES WITH A VARIETY OF TOPICS INCLUDING BREASTFEEDING. 6. INCREASE DETECTION AND TREATMENT OF THE EARLIEST STAGES OF LUNG CANCER NODULES -COXHEALTH OFFERS LOW-DOSE CT SCANS AS A DIAGNOSTIC SCREENING FOR LUNG CANCER. LOW-DOSE CT SCANS USE LOWER AMOUNTS OF RADIATION TO HELP IDENTIFY LUNG NODULES IN THE EARLIEST STAGES OF LUNG CANCER WHEN IT IS MOST TREATABLE. STUDIES HAVE SHOWN THAT PATIENTS WHO PARTICIPATE IN A LOW-DOSE CT LUNG CANCER PROGRAM ARE 20% LESS LIKELY TO DIE FROM LUNG CANCER THAN THOSE WHO WERE NOT SCREENED WHEN APPROPRIATE. -SINCE THE PROGRAM BEGAN, THE NUMBER OF INDIVIDUALS WHO HAD A LOW-DOSE CT SCAN COMPLETED HAS CONTINUED TO INCREASE. 7. INCREASE REFERRALS TO COMMUNITY ORAL HEALTH RESOURCES FOR PATIENTS PRESENTING TO THE ED FOR DENTAL ISSUES -COMMUNITY PARTNERSHIPS WITH LOCAL RESOURCES HAVE BEEN STRENGTHENED AND REFINED TO ENSURE STAFF FEEL EMPOWERED TO REFER PATIENTS TO FACILITIES LIKE THE JORDAN VALLEY COMMUNITY HEALTH CENTER (JVCHC) FOR THE APPROPRIATE LEVEL OF CARE FOR ORAL HEALTH ISSUES. -WHEN EVALUATING THE CHIEF COMPLAINTS OF PATIENTS THAT PRESENTED TO THE EMERGENCY DEPARTMENT (ED) FIVE OR MORE TIMES IN A 12-MONTH PERIOD FOR NON-EMERGENT CARE, DENTAL COMPLAINTS RANKED AMONG THE HIGHEST. -PROTOCOLS WERE DEVELOPED FOR PATIENTS THAT PRESENT WITH TOOTH PAIN IN THE ED. AFTER THE MEDICAL SCREENING EXAM COMPLETION, THE PATIENT IS TRANSITIONED TO JVCHC FOR IMMEDIATE DENTAL CARE. -COXHEALTH WORKED IN COLLABORATION WITH JVCHC TO APPLY FOR A GRANT THAT ALLOWED FOR THE HIRE OF ADDITIONAL DENTISTS. TO ENSURE SAME-DAY OR NEXT DAY APPOINTMENTS, THE DENTAL CLINIC EXPANDED TO ADD SATURDAY HOURS. -QUICK ACCESS TO THE DENTAL CLINIC ALLOWED COXHEALTH ED PHYSICIANS TO DISCONTINUE PRESCRIBING NARCOTICS TO PATIENTS WHO PRESENTED WITH TOOTH PAIN."

Information for this assessment was collected in a different manner this year, as the CHNA and Community Health Improvement Plan (CHIP) was a combined effort with the Local Health Department of Tompkins County. The CHNA/CHIP team was comprised of representatives from Tompkins County, Cayuga Medical Center, and several community-based non-profit organizations. Much of the information driving the selection/confirmation of our priorities was gathered through conversations with service providers and through panels and presentation by peers and providers. Key data indicators were reviewed to guide selection decisions for our priority focus areas. For example, data on hospitalizations related to mental health and substance abuse showed steep increases over the last 2-10 years, indicating that mental health and substance abuse continues to be a priority for Tompkins County. Finally, review of chronic disease indicators revealed that Tompkins County is in the second quartile statewide, indicating the need to continue our efforts to focus on underserved populations, particularly in the rural parts of the county."

Glens Falls Hospital met this requirement through participation in regional health assessment and planning efforts facilitated by the Adirondack Rural Health Network (ARHN).

Respondents to the survey indicated they represent a wide array of sectors including: day program services, education, employment, training, health care service prevention/wellness, healthy environment, housing/residential and social services.

Currently, Glens Falls Hospital is the contracted behavioral health provider for Warren and Washington counties.

Most recently, Glens Falls Hospital is working with Warren and Washington Counties to conduct a thoughtful and deliberate partnership exploration process for outpatient behavioral and substance use services. We are working with the Counties to identify potential partners who can help us better serve patients, with a goal to expand access to much-needed specialized behavioral health services in our community.

NEEDS ARE BEING ADDRESSED THROUGH A HOSPITAL-WIDE INTERNAL COMMITTEE, FUNDING TO EXTERNAL ORGANIZATIONS ENGAGED IN SELECTED PRIORITY NEEDS, COLLABORATION ON COMMUNITY WIDE COALITIONS AND INITIATIVES, ONGOING PROGRAMS THAT ADDRESS NEEDS, AND INTERNAL STRATEGIC ALIGNMENT.TWO COMMUNITY NEEDS WERE IDENTIFIED IN THE 2016 ASSESSMENT THAT WERE NOTINCLUDED IN THE IMPLEMENTATION STRATEGY: ECONOMIC OPPORTUNITIES AND SEXUALLY TRANSMITTED INFECTIONS AND TEEN BIRTHS.

Community forums, and individual key informant interviews were conducted between February and May 2018.Key informants were chosen because of their ability to identify primary concerns of the populations with whom they work, as well as of the overall community. They were asked to rate the degrees to which various health issues were of concern in the Eastern Region. Follow up questions were asked to describe why they identified areas as such, and how these might be better addressed. The key informants included Physicians, public health representatives, health professionals, social service providers and a variety of other community leaders including the following:Center for Healthy AgingConnecticut Legal ServicesEastern Connecticut Health Insurance Program (ECHIP)Eastern Connecticut Workforce BoardEastern Highlands Health DistrictGenerationsMansfield Youth ServicesNCDHDNortheast District Department of HealthSt. Joseph's LivingTown of MansfieldUConn Student Health ServicesUnited Services, Inc.Willimantic DCF officeWillimantic Fire DepartmentWillimantic PoliceWindham HospitalWindham Public SchoolsWindham Region Transit District The 2018 CHNA took a close look at social determinants of health such as poverty, housing, transportation, education, fresh food availability, and neighborhood safety. Social determinants of health have become a national priority for identifying and addressing health disparities, and Windham Hospital is committed to addressing these disparities through the Community Health Improvement Plan that will follow this Assessment. Through this process, input was gathered from individuals whose organizations can provide information for the following data elements: * Medically Underserved Areas* Health Professional Shortage Areas* Demographics* Ethnicity Distributions* Median Household Incomes* Homeownership Rates* Poverty Metrics* Unemployment Rates* Educational Metrics* Children in Poverty and Single Parent Households* Linguistically Isolated Populations* Uninsured Population Estimates* Clinical Provider Ratios* Physical Environment Metrics* Crime Rates* General Health Status Indicators* Cancer Prevalence and Screening Indicators* Cardiovascular Disease* Respiratory Disease* Diabetes* Infectious Diseases* Sexually Transmitted Diseases* Births and Prenatal Care* Health Behaviors* Benchmark Metrics (HealthyPeople 2020)"

The review of the identified needs were followed by a wide ranging discussion, after which the representatives were asked to rank each of the needs.Based on data analysis, surveys, focus groups, and interviews performed, the top community health needs and priorities for the Windham Hospital focus area are listed below:Transportation:Transportation was identified as a top social determinant issue in Windham service area. Community members can't get to appointments, including specialists that are far away.* Local transit municipal grant funding is inadequate and requires capping services* No Medicaid funds available* Dial A Ride has a 30 mile radius* Med Cab can't bring kids with them, which is a big issue for many families * EMS fills the gaps and is over stressed with transportation issuesAccess to Care:* Leads to overuse of the ED* Need for bilingual health counselors in community organizations* Need for more smoking cessation programs and awareness* Access to dental care, many have to leave the area* Need for community educational events as part of preventive care* Lack of women's health services and postpartum servicesSubstance Abuse:* Improvements have been made in the last few years* Willimantic continues to be challenged with the stigma of heroin availability and use* The number of drug exposed infants is very high in the areaMental Health:* Undocumented citizens not seeking or accepting care for fear of losing other services* The stigma of mental health difficult to overcome* School based healthcare is the only place that black and Latino males seek behavioral health assistance* Availability of services for children* Home behavioral health services can be 6 - 8 weeks on the waiting list* Need for more providers and more screening servicesAccess to Healthy Food:* High density and proportionality of fast food in the area* Schools have high BMI, poor nutrition, and need for more education and dedicated community dietician* The high cost of healthy food and need for more voucher programs and increasing focus on food donationIn the region, geographically Windham and Killingly/Plainfield scored significantly worse in physical and mental health indicators. In addition, Windham, Killingly/Plainfield, and Brooklyn/Hampton/Canterbury all had higher than state average rates in the following chronic conditions: asthma, arthritis, and diabetes.Lack of coordination among and between providers and community based organizations limits the overall effectiveness of the programs and the funding that is going to help serve the populations most in need. The results were then grouped into 3 Areas of Concern that were addressed in Community Health Improvement Plan (CHIP):1. Enhance Coordination of Services. This category includes Access to Care and Transportation. CHIP addressed this need in the following manner:a.Evaluate and use information exchange portal resources, linking healthcare providers with community based organizationsb. Improve IT resources to enable community focus and better measurement of outcomesc. Develop a playbook for infrastructure, dashboard of health, governance, and community workflowsd. Enable dynamic and up-to-date asset mappinge. Develop innovation network for learning, research, co-creation, and rapid knowledge dissemination (bi-directional communication platform)f. Implement new or increased use of Community Health Workers (CHW)g. Evaluate and use adaptive technology (e.g., geo-fencing, GIS mapping, artificial intelligence, biometric risk assessment, Epic tie-ins)2. Promote Healthy Behaviors and Lifestyle. This category includes Access to Healthy Food and Poor Physical and Mental Health. CHIP addresses this need in the following manner:a. Screen for healthy food need identification in community population and provide assessment at points of care b. Enhance Promotion and Marketing, including adopting 5-2-1-0 initiative, at schools, workplaces, public spaces, faith communities, and healthcare events c. Provide voucher/prescription programs for fruits and vegetablesd. Promote and improve healthy food donation e. Further partnerships with food pantries/banks and food providers and suppliersf.

MercyOne- Des Moines has a primary service area of three counties and a secondary reach to the surrounding six counties. The population served includes both urban and rural communities, with a growing number of people residing in the 3-county primary service area (Polk, Dallas, and Warren). These residents have a median income of $66,558, with eight percent living below the poverty line. Of those who live below the poverty level, 53 per cent are single-parent families with children under 5 years of age. With an increasing immigrant and refugee population relocating to central Iowa, approximately 13 per cent of our 3- county population speak a language other than English at home. There are as many as 106 individual languages spoken by families in the Des Moines Public Schools. The largest New Iowan population has Latino origins, representing 20% of the community in the Des Moines area. The CHNA conducted on 8/1/2019 identified the significant health needs within the MercyOne- Des Moines community. Those needs were then prioritized based on input from persons who represent the interests of the community served. The significant health needs identified, in order of priority include: A. in order to ensure access to health for all, MERCY WILL: * Increase investments/reimbursements for prevention * Reform Medicaid Managed Care to reduce barriers to accessing necessary services * Increase community understanding and support of mental health, reducing stigma and encouraging parity between mental health and physical health * Reduce transportation barriers, particularly for people with low income and rural families * Ensure individuals with mental health needs are connected to appropriate services-avoiding unnecessary jail and emergency room referrals * Increase avenues of understanding and cultural humility, reducing barriers for individuals seeking assistance B.

PARTNERS IN THE EFFORT INCLUDE: MUNICIPALITIES, BUSINESSES, GRASSROOTS COMMUNITY GROUPS, HEALTH CARE PROVIDERS, THE LOCAL HOSPITAL, CHAMBER OF COMMERCE, HUMAN SERVICE AGENCIES, SCHOOLS AND LOCAL NOT-FOR-PROFITS. THE GROUP HAS EXISTED FOR OVER A DECADE AND PRESENTLY HAS APPROXIMATELY FORTY MEMBERS THAT HAVE FORMALLY COMMITTED TO ITS PURPOSE BY SIGNING AFH PARTNERSHIP LETTERS. RECRUITMENT OF NEW MEMBERS IS ONGOING. THE AFH CONSORTIUM HAS INCREASED COMMUNITY OWNERSHIP AND COMMITMENT TO THE SHARED HEALTH IMPROVEMENT GOALS AND TO THE WORK CAPTURED IN THE CHIP. IN FACILITATING THESE EFFORTS, THE CCHD HAS STRENGTHENED ITS ABILITY TO LEVERAGE RESOURCES FROM PUBLIC HEALTH PARTNERS AND PRIVATE ENTITIES ALIKE. SIGNIFICANT PROGRESS ON THE COUNTY'S CHIP HAS BEEN MADE CAPITALIZING ON THIS SYSTEM OF PARTNERSHIP CREATED THROUGH THE CONSORTIUM. THE AFH CONSORTIUM MEETS PERIODICALLY FOR UPDATES, ISSUE DISCUSSION, AND INFORMATION SHARING. A MINIMUM OF SIX MEETING ARE SCHEDULED EACH YEAR, WITH ADDITIONAL GATHERINGS SCHEDULED AS NEEDED. SUBCOMMITTEES OF MEMBERS WITH EXPERTISE RELATED TO SELECTED PRIORITY AREAS MEET MORE FREQUENTLY AND KEEP THE GROUP APPRISED OF THEIR WORK. CCHD TRACKS PROGRESS ON THE CHIP CONTINUALLY AND PREPARES A YEAR-END REPORT WHICH INCLUDES UPDATES ON WORK RELATED TO THE TWO FEATURED PRIORITY AREAS AND A SUMMARY OF ACCOMPLISHMENTS BY LOCAL PARTNERS RELATED TO EACH OF THE NYSDOH PREVENTION PLAN PRIORITY AREAS. CAPTURED ACTIVITIES DEMONSTRATE WORK ON ALL TIERS OF THE PUBLIC HEALTH IMPACT PYRAMID.
