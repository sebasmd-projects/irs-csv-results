Financial aid is an important factor for many students, and 100 percent of eligible Manchester University students receive some combination of grants, scholarships, loans, and work. Student Financial Services will determine a student's eligibility for financial aid by using the results of the Free Application for Federal Student Aid (FAFSA); the estimated family contribution (EFC) and review of edit (c-codes), as well as the student's academic records and funds available. Manchester University utilizes an awarding matrix based on a combination of academic and financial need criteria referenced above. Student Financial Services administers financial aid from federal, state, and institutional resources utilizing the federal guidelines established by the U.S. Department of Education. The following steps must be taken by a student to receive a financial aid package from Manchester University: 1. Apply for admission and be admitted to Manchester University. Eligibility for academic scholarships from the University is determined through the admission process. 2. Submit a FAFSA. Eligibility for federal, state and institutional need based grants and loans is determined through this process. The student must designate the results be sent to Manchester University, and Indiana students must have a receipt date between Oct.1 and April 15 to be considered for state grant eligibility. 3. Submit any additional documentation requested by Student Financial Services. Enrollment Requirements. Students receiving financial aid must maintain full-time enrollment, (a minimum of 12 semester hours) in each of the fall and spring semesters. There are circumstances in which part-time students demonstrating need may be awarded financial aid depending on the guidelines and availability of federal, state and institutional funding. Part-time students must enroll in a minimum of six hours to maintain eligibility for institutional funds and loans. Degree Requirements.

Each student's award package is reviewed to ensure compliance with applicable regulatory requirements, and in the case of restricted institutional funds, with the donor's intent and wishes. Academic scholarship eligibility is based on a scoring matrix that evaluates an individual student's success using national test scores, high school GPA, and rigor of curriculum. Those who have excelled academically are generally given the largest share of university funded dollars. Institutionally funded need-based financial aid programs are based on eligibility established by use of an Institutional Methodology, with family financial information submitted to the CSS Profile. The financial aid office also works closely with the donor relations division of university advancement to ensure that our donors' wishes are met when matching funds to students. All donors of endowed awards are provided with a ""scholarship agreement"" outlining the university's understanding of the donor's intent. These agreements must be approved by both the director of financial aid, and the vice-chancellor for advancement, to ensure that the university has the capability to identify appropriate recipients. In addition to institutionally funded grants and scholarships, TCU manages and accepts fiduciary responsibility for a variety of federal and state funded financial aid programs. Eligibility for all federal and state funded financial aid is based solely on the results of the FAFSA, using required Federal Methodology. Prior to disbursement, each recipient must pass a variety of edit checks, or ""disbursement rules"" to ensure that the student is enrolled in classes and has submitted all required documentation needed to satisfy program eligibility. After disbursement, student aid recipients are reviewed at the end of the 100% tuition refund period for a final enrollment status determination. Students who received aid based on projected full-time enrollment, but who have dropped below 12 credit hours, are subject to an adjustment of their aid package. At the end of the 25%, and final refund period, students are again reviewed and subject to aid adjustment based on final costs for the term. Aid recipients are monitored on a regular basis throughout the academic year. Files are reviewed weekly to identify updated FAFSA and Profile applications, and adjustments are made when required. Reports are submitted to the Texas higher education coordinating board periodically for review of state aid recipients, and the university is subject to periodic audits and reviews from both entities. Academic success is the ultimate goal of all aid programs, and satisfactory academic progress is reviewed at the end of each term. At a minimum, full-time students are required to complete at least 75% of attempted hours and obtain a 2.00 GPA to meet renewal requirements. Most TCU funded awards require a minimum GPA of 2.50. Academic scholarships require a 3.25 GPA. Once posted to student accounts, the office of student financial services also monitors award amounts in relation to specific charges.

THE UNIVERSITY'S ADMISSION PROCESS FOR UNDERGRADUATE STUDENTS FROM THE UNITED STATES IS NEED-BLIND, WHICH MEANS THAT STUDENTS ARE ADMITTED IRRESPECTIVE OF THEIR ABILITY TO PAY; THE UNIVERSITY PROVIDES THE FINANCIAL AID NECESSARY TO MAKE STANFORD AFFORDABLE TO EVERY ADMITTED STUDENT. FOR INTERNATIONAL STUDENTS, THE UNIVERSITY IS NEED-AWARE: STANFORD ANALYZES THE NEED FOR AID AND AIMS TO MEET THE DETERMINED NEED. SINCE 2000, THE UNIVERSITY HAS CONTINUED TO ENHANCE ITS FINANCIAL AID PROGRAMS FOR BOTH ITS UNDERGRADUATE AND GRADUATE STUDENTS. CURRENTLY, FAMILIES OF UNDERGRADUATE STUDENTS FROM THE U.S. WITH INCOMES BELOW $150,000 AND ASSETS TYPICAL OF THAT INCOME LEVEL RECEIVE AT LEAST ENOUGH SCHOLARSHIP TO COVER THE COST OF TUITION. THOSE WITH INCOMES BELOW $65,000 AND TYPICAL ASSETS RECEIVE ENOUGH SCHOLARSHIP ASSISTANCE TO COVER TUITION, ROOM AND BOARD, AND OTHER EXPENSES. IN FY19, APPROXIMATELY 48% OF UNDERGRADUATES WERE AWARDED NEED-BASED FINANCIAL AID FROM STANFORD. STANFORD PROVIDES VALUABLE FINANCIAL SUPPORT TO ELIGIBLE GRADUATE STUDENTS WHICH ENABLES THEM TO PURSUE THEIR ADVANCED STUDIES. FUNDING MAY TAKE DIFFERENT FORMS, SUCH AS FELLOWSHIPS AND ASSISTANTSHIPS, AND THESE IN TURN FURTHER THEIR GRADUATE PROFESSIONAL DEVELOPMENT AND PROGRESS TO DEGREE COMPLETION. IN THE CASE OF GRADUATE RESEARCH AND TEACHING ASSISTANTSHIPS AS WELL AS FELLOWSHIPS, THE FUNDING COVERS PART OF STANFORD'S TUITION (WHICH IS FREE OF INCOME TAX), IN ADDITION TO PROVIDING A STIPEND OR SALARY THAT HELPS STUDENTS WITH THEIR LIVING EXPENSES. BOTH COMPONENTS ARE ESSENTIAL FOR DOCTORAL STUDENTS IN PARTICULAR, AS IT TAKES SEVERAL YEARS TO GAIN THEIR MASTERY OF SPECIALIZED SKILLS AND CONTENT KNOWLEDGE IN THEIR CHOSEN FIELDS. GRADUATE STUDENT FINANCIAL AID AND OTHER SUPPORT IS AWARDED BASED ON ACADEMIC MERIT AND THE AVAILABILITY OF AID. IN THE FACE OF DIMINISHING FEDERAL SUPPORT, STANFORD HAS ASSUMED MORE OF THE FINANCIAL WEIGHT OF SUPPORTING ITS GRADUATE STUDENTS. IN FY19, APPROXIMATELY 81% OF GRADUATE STUDENTS RECEIVED FINANCIAL SUPPORT. THE KNIGHT-HENNESSY SCHOLARS PROGRAM IS AN ADDITIONAL SOURCE OF GRADUATE STUDENT SUPPORT. THE PROGRAM PROVIDES FULL FUNDING FOR THREE YEARS TO ENABLE GRADUATE STUDENTS TO PURSUE ADVANCED DEGREES AND DEVELOP THE CAPACITY TO LEAD AND BRING ABOUT POSITIVE CHANGES IN THE WORLD. THE TOTAL FINANCIAL AID INCLUDES $322,056,511 IN MERIT AND NEED-BASED SCHOLARSHIPS AND FELLOWSHIPS. AN ADDITIONAL $179,470,712 REFLECTS AMOUNTS PAID FOR ADDITIONAL FINANCIAL SUPPORT TO STUDENTS, INCLUDING PAYMENTS FOR HEALTH INSURANCE, LIVING EXPENSES, AND SUPPORT OF POSTDOCTORAL FELLOWS.
