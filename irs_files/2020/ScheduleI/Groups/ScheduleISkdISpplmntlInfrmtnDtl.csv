In such cases, the donee/grantee organization must provide documentation to the filing organization before funds are approved for disbursement. In other cases, grantees submit progress reports on the anniversary date on which the grant was received.

Description of the Bon Secours Mercy Health Mission Fund: Bon Secours Mercy Health performs its philanthropic work through its mission department. This initiative, called the Bon Secours Health System Mission Fund (""Mission Fund""), was developed to promote the Catholic Health Ministry and the Bon Secours Mercy Health, Inc. Mission. This purpose is realized through the funding of initiatives that improve the health and well-being of communities, particularly for disenfranchised and marginalized people, served by Bon Secours Mercy Health Local Systems (""Local Systems""), Cosponsors and the Congregation of the Sisters of Bon Secours. The scope of its purpose and use of funds would be to: -promote healthy community coalition initiatives in conjunction with local system efforts, -develop local system and community excellence for a specific health condition and preventive need, and -improve access for uninsured populations and reduce health disparities among populations in the community. The Strategic Quality Plan of the health system calls for focused efforts to Build Healthier Communities. The health system understands ""health"" to include social and communal dimensions and has adopted the following articulation of a healthy community. The conditions of communities and individuals served by Bon Secours Mercy Health reflect the interaction of significant factors and complex behaviors at the individual, communal, and societal level. It is not likely that interventions by any one organization will result in substantial improvement or benefit to the community. Rather, increased participation by stakeholders and greater cooperation among entities with appropriate skills and resources is necessary for systemic change and improved outcomes. Mission Fund grants place emphasis on increased collaboration among community based members (Healthy Community Initiative), public health officials and other providers of services. The Mission Fund anticipates that most endeavors that seek to bring meaningful improvement require time and commitment. Consequently, local system grant recipients may expect continuity of support (several years) to establish and track outcomes. At the same time, grant applicants need to cultivate and achieve a wide array of financial resources necessary to sustain promising projects and service programs."

Each student's award package is reviewed to ensure compliance with applicable regulatory requirements, and in the case of restricted institutional funds, with the donor's intent and wishes. Academic scholarship eligibility is based on a scoring matrix that evaluates an individual student's success using national test scores, high school GPA, and rigor of curriculum. Those who have excelled academically are generally given the largest share of university funded dollars. Institutionally funded need-based financial aid programs are based on eligibility established by use of an Institutional Methodology, with family financial information submitted to the CSS Profile. The financial aid office also works closely with the donor relations division of university advancement to ensure that our donors' wishes are met when matching funds to students. All donors of endowed awards are provided with a ""scholarship agreement"" outlining the university's understanding of the donor's intent. These agreements must be approved by both the director of financial aid, and the vice-chancellor for advancement, to ensure that the university has the capability to identify appropriate recipients. In addition to institutionally funded grants and scholarships, TCU manages and accepts fiduciary responsibility for a variety of federal and state funded financial aid programs. Eligibility for all federal and state funded financial aid is based solely on the results of the FAFSA, using required Federal Methodology. Prior to disbursement, each recipient must pass a variety of edit checks, or ""disbursement rules"" to ensure that the student is enrolled in classes and has submitted all required documentation needed to satisfy program eligibility. After disbursement, student aid recipients are reviewed at the end of the 100% tuition refund period for a final enrollment status determination. Students who received aid based on projected full-time enrollment, but who have dropped below 12 credit hours, are subject to an adjustment of their aid package. At the end of the 25%, and final refund period, students are again reviewed and subject to aid adjustment based on final costs for the term. Aid recipients are monitored on a regular basis throughout the academic year. Files are reviewed weekly to identify updated FAFSA and Profile applications, and adjustments are made when required. Reports are submitted to the Texas higher education coordinating board periodically for review of state aid recipients, and the university is subject to periodic audits and reviews from both entities. Academic success is the ultimate goal of all aid programs, and satisfactory academic progress is reviewed at the end of each term. At a minimum, full-time students are required to complete at least 75% of attempted hours and obtain a 2.00 GPA to meet renewal requirements. Most TCU funded awards require a minimum GPA of 2.50. Academic scholarships require a 3.25 GPA. Once posted to student accounts, the office of student financial services also monitors award amounts in relation to specific charges.

Grants-in-Aid are awarded on the basis of demonstrated financial need assessed by the use of a standard financial aid application, currently the Free Application for Federal Student Aid (FAFSA), which analyzes the family income data provided on the FAFSA through the mandated Federal Methodology. All need-based financial aid must be awarded according to a student's calculated financial need. Scholarship awards are primarily provided on scholastic achievement. University scholarships are highly competitive and available to students through a combination of academic achievement and personal commitment, display of values, compassion, and pursuit of excellence which embody the spirit and mission of the University. The University has many scholarships funded through special endowments and donations. In most instances, academic merit and financial need are considered along with the particular requirements of the scholarship selection process.
