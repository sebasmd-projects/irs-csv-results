REPORTING APPROACH FOR THE TAX-EXEMPT COMMERCIAL PAPER PROGRAM: THE UNIVERSITY USES THE PROCEEDS FROM ISSUANCE OF COMMERCIAL PAPER NOTES TO FUND PURCHASES OF CAPITAL EQUIPMENT, LIBRARY BOOKS AND INFORMATION TECHNOLOGY ASSETS, AND TO FUND MINOR CAPITAL RENOVATIONS. THE NOTES IN EACH SERIES ARE ISSUED IN TRANCHES. EACH TRANCHE IS COMPRISED OF ISSUES WHICH ARE SEGREGATED BY THE AFOREMENTIONED FOUR ASSET TYPES. WEIGHTED AVERAGE LIFE CALCULATIONS ARE PREPARED FOR EACH ISSUE WITHIN A TRANCHE, RESULTING IN UNIQUE MATURITY DATES FOR EACH ISSUE WITHIN A TRANCHE. WHILE A SEPARATE FORM 8038 IS PREPARED FOR EACH ISSUE WITHIN A COMMERCIAL PAPER TRANCHE, SCHEDULE K INSTRUCTIONS PERMIT INFORMATION TO BE COMBINED FOR SERIES THAT ARE ISSUED AT SUBSTANTIALLY THE SAME TIME. SINCE THIS IS THE CASE FOR THE UNIVERSITY'S COMMERCIAL PAPER ISSUANCES THAT ARE ISSUED AS ONE TRANCHE, ALL ISSUES FOR AN INDIVIDUAL TRANCHE ARE COMBINED AND REPORTED AT THE TRANCHE LEVEL FOR PART I OF SCHEDULE K. ISSUE PRICES FOR ALL ISSUES THAT ARE STILL OUTSTANDING WITHIN A TRANCHE ARE COMBINED AND REPORTED IN TOTAL. COMBINED DATA IS ALSO REPORTED IN PARTS II, III AND IV TO SCHEDULE K.

AT EACH REMARKETING DATE FOR THE COMMERCIAL PAPER NOTES, A NEW CUSIP NUMBER IS ISSUED FOR THE AMOUNTS REMARKETED.
