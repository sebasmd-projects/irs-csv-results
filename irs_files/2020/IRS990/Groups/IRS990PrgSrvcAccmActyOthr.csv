""Be of Service"" is an integral core value that we demonstrate in a variety of ways. The Foundation provides treatment services to individuals and families who seek and qualify for care but are unable to pay the full cost. The Foundation's patient aid policy provides that the Foundation will annually establish a target amount of patient financial assistance. In addition to its annual provision for charity care, the Foundation provides a variety of other benefits for the public good including:Butler Center for Research -The Butler Center for Research (BCR) is dedicated to improving recovery from addiction by conducting clinical and institutional research, collaborating with other research centers and communicating scientific findings. It is the Center's vision that sustained recovery for all who seek help will be achieved through advancements in knowledge and integration of research into practice.-In 2019, the BCR participated in the following activities:-As part of the Hazelden Betty Ford Foundation's commitment to evidence-based practice, a variety of projects were conducted to inform clinical care and academic programming, identify treatment needs, drive data-based decision making, and contribute to the professional and public knowledge of addiction treatment. Projects included data analyses, and industry trend reports, among others. -The BCR collaborated with researchers from the Mayo Clinic who obtained a government grant to study the use of acamprosate, an FDA-approved medication targeting alcohol craving. Funded by the National Institute on Alcohol Abuse and Alcoholism (NIAAA), this project will work to identify biomarkers that may predict patient response to the use of the medication, with the hope of finding new genes linked to alcoholism treatment response. The project was successfully launched in July of 2019 with recruitment ongoing through 2020. Findings from this study could have substantial impact and inform substance use treatment on a national scale.-The BCR also collaborated on another NIAAA grant-funded study with researchers from Virginia Commonwealth University. Titled, ""Genes, addiction, and personality,"" this study is part of a genome-wide association study to learn more about the relationships between personality, mental health, substance use and genes. Data collection was successful in 2019 and will be ongoing into 2020. -Research Updates were disseminated to professionals, educators, researchers, students and other stakeholders.

THIS MISSION IS STRONGLY SUPPORTED AND ENHANCED BY THE DEDICATED STAFF'S PURSUIT OF SCIENTIFIC ADVANCEMENT. SINCE 1915, HENRY FORD HOSPITAL PHYSICIANS AND SCIENTISTS HAVE FOCUSED THEIR EFFORTS ON A WIDE VARIETY OF TOPICS CRITICAL TO UNDERSTANDING THE MECHANISMS OF DISEASE AND DEVELOPING NEW, VIABLE TREATMENT OPTIONS. OVER THE PAST FEW YEARS, HENRY FORD HEALTH SYSTEM (HFHS) HAS ENJOYED GREAT SUCCESS IN SECURING EXTERNAL RESEARCH GRANTS AND CONTRACTS. EXTERNAL GRANT FUNDING HAS BEEN RECEIVED FROM THE NATIONAL INSTITUTES OF HEALTH (NIH), OTHER FEDERAL AGENCIES, PHARMACEUTICAL COMPANIES AND INDUSTRY, STATE AND LOCAL AGENCIES, AND FOUNDATIONS, SUCH AS THE AMERICAN HEART ASSOCIATION. IN 2013, $27.4 MILLION WAS AWARDED BY NIH AND OTHER FEDERAL AGENCIES AND $29 MILLION BY INDUSTRY. ALTHOUGH HFHS IS NOT FORMALLY PART OF A UNIVERSITY OR MEDICAL SCHOOL, THERE HAS BEEN STRONG SUPPORT FOR THE SYSTEM'S RESEARCH THROUGHOUT ITS HISTORY. THIS DRIVE TO UNDERSTAND DISEASE MECHANISM AND DISCOVER NEW THERAPIES IS MANIFESTED BY THE CONTINUUM OF BIOMEDICAL RESEARCH PERFORMED AT HENRY FORD. THE SYSTEM HAS 80 FULL-TIME RESEARCH BIO-SCIENTIFIC STAFF DOING BASIC SCIENCE STUDIES IN CARDIOVASCULAR AND RENAL DISEASES SUCH AS HYPERTENSION AND HEART FAILURE, STROKE/BRAIN INJURY/BRAIN TUMORS, POPULATION HEALTH AND HEALTHCARE RESEARCH, CANCER THERAPEUTICS, BONE AND JOINT DISEASES, IMMUNOLOGY AND IMAGING, AMONG OTHERS. IN ADDITION, DOZENS OF PHYSICIANS AND THEIR CLINICAL SUPPORT STAFF ARE ENGAGED IN PATIENT-ORIENTED STUDIES. AT THIS TIME, HFHS HAS MORE THAN 1,800 OPEN STUDIES APPROVED BY ITS INSTITUTIONAL REVIEW BOARD, INCLUDING STUDIES APPROVED IN CONJUNCTION WITH WAYNE STATE UNIVERSITY AND MICHIGAN STATE UNIVERSITY. THE BASIC SCIENCE BIOMEDICAL RESEARCH PROGRAMS RECEIVING THE MOST EXTERNAL FUNDING WERE PUBLIC HEALTH SCIENCES, NEUROLOGY RESEARCH (STROKE, TRAUMATIC BRAIN INJURY, ETC.), HYPERTENSION RESEARCH AND CARDIOVASCULAR RESEARCH (IN PARTICULAR, HEART FAILURE). IN CLINICAL RESEARCH, THE MAJORITY OF FUNDING HAS GONE TO THE DEPARTMENT OF INTERNAL MEDICINE WHERE THE DIVISIONS OF INFECTIOUS DISEASES, GASTROENTEROLOGY, HEMATOLOGY/ONCOLOGY AND CARDIOLOGY ARE LEADING THE WAY. THE INFRASTRUCTURE AT HFHS ALLOWS US TO HAVE A RESEARCH PROGRAM FAR LARGER THAN OTHER NON-UNIVERSITY-BASED HEALTH CARE SYSTEMS IN THE STATE OF MICHIGAN, WHERE OUR NIH FUNDING IS TEN TIMES HIGHER THAN HFHS'S CLOSEST COMPETITOR. IN 2013, HFHS WAS FOURTH IN MICHIGAN, TRAILING THE STATES THREE LARGEST UNIVERSITIES, AND RANKED 192ND OUT OF ALL 2,495 INSTITUTIONS RECEIVING NIH GRANTS NATIONALLY"
