MPCC is an association of private nonprofit institutions of higher education that serves a variety of its members' shared needs, including, but not only, nonpartisan and non-electoral advocacy for public policy that meets students' needs and advances the interests of private higher education. The University paid membership dues to MPCC in the amount of $144,822 during the taxable year. MPCC has divided its expenses for its taxable year ending June 30, 2018, into two groups. Group 1 consists of those expenses that did not in any way support attempts to influence legislation within the meaning of section 501(c)(3) of the Internal Revenue Code (""lobbying""), and Group 2 consists of all other expenses. Group 2 includes many expenses, such as personnel costs, that supported both lobbying and non-lobbying activities. MPCC did not attempt to allocate the Group 2 expenses between lobbying and non-lobbying activities. MPCC has determined that the amount of the Group 2 expenses represents 80.68% of the amount of the dues that MPCC collected in the same taxable year. Assuming that all Group 2 expenses were paid from member dues, and allocating those expenses pro rata based on the dues paid by each member, $117,664 of the University's dues were used to pay Group 2 expenses.

By informing public audiences and key stakeholders about important issues, Hazelden Betty Ford Foundation seeks to diminish public stigma related to addiction and improve the formulation of policy at its earliest stages. The Foundation also supports each Hazelden Betty Ford Foundation facility, its employees and other interested stakeholders by responding to requests and providing information on relevant federal, state and local legislation. Hazelden Betty Ford Foundation's advocacy leaders discussed the Foundation's policy ideas and recommendations with Members of Congress, the Administration and their staff on multiple occasions throughout the year-in person, via formal letters and official comments, and via less formal emails and phone calls. For example, one brief trip to Washington in July 2019 included visits to 17 Congressional offices and discussions on a range of topics, including modernization of 42 CFR Part 2, the law governing the use of addiction treatment medical records; other industry reforms supporting quality, ethics and integration with mainstream medical services; parity enforcement; addiction treatment workforce development; cannabis policy; and opioid crisis solutions. Formal correspondence included official comments submitted in response to proposed federal rule changes related to 42 CFR Part 2; letters of support for legislation like the Rural Health Workforce Act; and a letter to the U.S. House Energy and Commerce Committee in response to requests for addiction treatment industry reform recommendations. The national director for Hazelden Betty Ford Foundation's Children's Programs also spoke before the U.S. House Freshman Addiction Task Force. Hazelden Betty Ford Foundation hosted public events in Minnesota with the U.S. Surgeon General (May 8) and the Director of the White House Office of National Drug Control Policy (June 6), inviting a diverse collection of other community stakeholders to participate as well. In addition, the Foundation nominated its chief medical officer, Marvin D. Seppala, M.D., for a new ""Interdepartmental Substance Use Disorders Coordinating Committee"" that is still pending and consulted the Surgeon General's office on a new national cannabis advisory. In 2019, Hazelden Betty Ford Foundation continued contributions to the Partnership to Amend 42 CFR Part 2, a coalition that advocates for aligning conflicting federal laws related to the sharing of medical records to allow appropriate access to patient information that is essential for providing whole-person care. Membership in coalitions and associations such as the National Association of Addiction Treatment Providers allows Hazelden Betty Ford Foundation to join forces with others sharing similar concerns and interests. At the state level, Hazelden Betty Ford Foundation met and communicated with policymakers in California, Minnesota, New York, Washington and elsewhere-kicking off a state government relations strategy pursuant to both regulatory and legislative priorities. Hazelden Betty Ford's advocacy leaders sponsored or provided speakers for numerous events in 2019-including local school and community forums as well as national and state conventions-focused on opioids, cannabis, access to care, the reduction of stigma, the promotion of recovery, and other public education and policy areas. In addition, the Foundation distributed a weekly Advocacy Update email to a national list of subscribers, while also producing blogs and audio-video content, providing or securing media interviews to support its advocacy agenda, and generating thousands of social media impressions and unique website visitors. The Foundation regularly receives requests for information on addiction, treatment and recovery issues from policymakers, the media and the public. By serving as a reliable resource to many, the Foundation was able to influence policy and public attitudes in diverse ways. The firm Peck, Madigan & Jones was retained to assist Hazelden Betty Ford Foundation with federal lobbying efforts. Additionally, the firms Capitol Advisors and Fredrikson & Byron, P.A., were retained to help with lobbying efforts in California and Minnesota, respectively. Hazelden Betty Ford Foundation's advocacy mission is to provide a leading and trusted voice on emerging topics and public policy issues that dominate the national dialogue on addiction, and to facilitate conversation among those in recovery, those still suffering and society-at-large. The Foundation is and will remain committed to smashing stigma, shaping public policy and educating people everywhere about the problems of addiction and the promise of recovery."
