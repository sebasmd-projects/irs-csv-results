MPCC is an association of private nonprofit institutions of higher education that serves a variety of its members' shared needs, including, but not only, nonpartisan and non-electoral advocacy for public policy that meets students' needs and advances the interests of private higher education. The University paid membership dues to MPCC in the amount of $141,522 during the taxable year. MPCC has divided its expenses for its taxable year ending June 30, 2017, into two groups. Group 1 consists of those expenses that did not in any way support attempts to influence legislation within the meaning of section 501(c)(3) of the Internal Revenue Code (""lobbying""), and Group 2 consists of all other expenses. Group 2 includes many expenses, such as personnel costs, that supported both lobbying and non-lobbying activities. MPCC did not attempt to allocate the Group 2 expenses between lobbying and non-lobbying activities. MPCC has determined that the amount of the Group 2 expenses represents 78.81% of the amount of the dues that MPCC collected in the same taxable year. Assuming that all Group 2 expenses were paid from member dues, and allocating those expenses pro rata based on the dues paid by each member, $111,536 of the University's dues were used to pay Group 2 expenses. The amount of lobbying expenses paid from the University's dues was significantly less than that amount."

MPCC is an association of private nonprofit institutions of higher education that serves a variety of its members' shared needs, including, but not only, nonpartisan and non-electoral advocacy for public policy that meets students' needs and advances the interests of private higher education. The College paid membership dues to MPCC in the amount of $129,028 during the taxable year. MPCC has divided its expenses for its taxable year ending June 30, 2017, into two groups. Group 1 consists of those expenses that did not in any way support attempts to influence legislation within the meaning of section 501(c)(3) of the Internal Revenue Code (""lobbying""), and Group 2 consists of all other expenses. Group 2 includes many expenses, such as personnel costs, that supported both lobbying and nonlobbying activities. MPCC did not attempt to allocate the Group 2 expenses between lobbying and nonlobbying activities. MPCC has determined that the amount of the Group 2 expenses represents 78.81% of the amount of the dues that MPCC collected in the same taxable year. Assuming that all Group 2 expenses were paid from member dues, and allocating those expenses pro rata based on the dues paid by each member, $101,689 of the College's dues were used to pay Group 2 expenses. The amount of lobbying expenses paid from the College's dues was significantly less than that amount. In addition, the College paid membership dues of $9,159 during the taxable year to the National Association of Independent Colleges and Universities of which 7%, or $641, was estimated to be used for lobbying expenses."

By informing audiences and key stakeholders about important issues, the Institute's goal is to improve the formulation of policy at its earliest stage. The Institute also supports each Hazelden Betty Ford Foundation facility, its employees and other interested stakeholders by responding to requests and providing information on relevant federal, state and local legislation. The Institute discussed its policy ideas and recommendations with Members of Congress and their staff on July 13, when a group of 10 Hazelden Betty Ford Foundation Board and staff members fanned out across Capitol Hill, visiting 30 offices. The Institute also was involved in several public forums that highlighted solutions to the opioid crisis and the underlying, more longstanding problem of addiction, as well as the need for robust access to care. It collaborated with others on most events, providing leadership, speakers and information as part of its focus on influencing public perception and awareness through education about addiction, treatment and recovery. The Institute, in partnership with the Association of Recovery in Higher Education, organized and hosted America's Opioid Crisis: A National Town Hall, a free public event held July 12 on the campus of George Washington University in Washington, D.C. More than 800 attended, and the livestream had over 20,000 views and more than 1,000 comments, shares and reactions. The Institute, in collaboration with the Mary Christie Foundation, also organized Substance Use on College Campuses: New Approaches to a Perennial Problem, an event held Oct. 17 at the University of Maryland. It brought together six university presidents and system heads, along with researchers and other experts, to highlight solutions to the problem of substance use among college students, and inspired a white paper to be distributed to universities nationwide in 2018. The Institute also hosted the AmeriCorps Boot Camp on Recovery, a national event to showcase the addiction recovery community's potential as a vital resource to AmeriCorps and state-run service initiatives. That event - held Feb. 22 at Hazelden in St. Paul, in partnership with ServeMinnesota and the National Youth Recovery Foundation - sparked the beginning of what some states have now dubbed Recovery Corps. In addition, the Institute hosted, sponsored or provided speakers for numerous other events focused on opioids, access to care, other policy areas and/or stigma, including school and community forums as well as national and state conventions. The Institute also distributed its weekly Advocacy Update email to a national list of subscribers, while also producing blogs and audio-video content, providing or securing media interviews to support its advocacy agenda, and generating thousands of social media impressions and unique website visitors. In other policy activity, the Institute continued to play a leading role in the Parity Implementation Coalition (PIC), which advocates for robust implementation of the federal ""parity"" law that expands access to addiction treatment through private health care insurance. Membership in associations related to the addiction field and the preservation of the services the organization provides allows it to join forces with others sharing similar concerns and interests. The Institute regularly receives requests for information on addiction, treatment and recovery issues from federal, state and local legislatures and governments, as well as from the media and the general public. By serving as a reliable resource to many, the Institute was able to influence policy and public attitudes in diverse ways. It also was able to collaborate frequently and effectively with grassroots community-based organizations across the country on local, state and federal policy issues. The Hazelden Betty Ford Foundation Institute for Recovery Advocacy's mission is to provide a leading and trusted voice on emerging topics and public policy issues that dominate the national dialogue on addiction, and to facilitate conversation among those in recovery, those still suffering and society at large. It is and will remain committed to smashing stigma, shaping public policy and educating people everywhere about the problems of addiction and the promise of recovery."
