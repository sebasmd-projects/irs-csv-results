201801979349301170,941156365,IRS990ScheduleK,SCHEDULE K,"TAX-EXEMPT BONDS FOR MORE THAN 30 YEARS, STANFORD AND THE MANY COMMUNITIES AND CONSTITUENCIES IT SERVES HAVE BENEFITED FROM TAX-EXEMPT BORROWING THROUGH THE CALIFORNIA EDUCATIONAL FACILITIES AUTHORITY. THE UNIVERSITY USES GENEROUS DONOR GIFTS, UNIVERSITY RESERVES AND TAXABLE DEBT, IN ADDITION TO PROCEEDS FROM TAX EXEMPT BORROWING, TO FUND THE CONSTRUCTION OF ACADEMIC BUILDINGS, RESEARCH SUPPORT FACILITIES, RESIDENCES AND OTHER CAMPUS HOUSING, ROADS AND INFRASTRUCTURE. THESE FACILITIES HAVE, IN TURN, ENABLED THE UNIVERSITY TO ATTRACT OUTSTANDING FACULTY AND STUDENTS AND TO MORE EFFECTIVELY PERFORM INTERDISCIPLINARY RESEARCH DESIGNED TO ADDRESS FUNDAMENTAL WORLD PROBLEMS. THE NEW FACILITIES PROVIDE THE STANFORD COMMUNITY WITH THE MOST ADVANCED TECHNOLOGY AND ENVIRONMENT FOR TEACHING, LEARNING AND RESEARCH. THE FUNDING ALSO HAS PLAYED A KEY ROLE IN ENABLING STANFORD TO MEET SEISMIC AND OTHER FEDERAL AND STATE BUILDING REQUIREMENTS. THE FOLLOWING ARE EXAMPLES OF BUILDINGS FUNDED IN PART THROUGH TAX-EXEMPT DEBT: I. THE YANG YAMAZAKI ENVIRONMENTAL AND ENERGY BUILDING (Y2E2) IS THE HUB OF STANFORD'S ENVIRONMENTAL SUSTAINABILITY TEACHING AND RESEARCH. IT IS A MODEL FOR SUSTAINABILITY BUILDING STANDARDS, USING 37 PERCENT LESS ENERGY AND 90 PERCENT LESS POTABLE WATER THAN A TRADITIONALLY CONSTRUCTED BUILDING OF ITS SIZE. Y2E2 WAS THE FIRST CAMPUS BUILDING TO ACHIEVE LEED-EBOM (EXISTING BUILDING: OPERATIONS AND MAINTENANCE) PLATINUM CERTIFICATION. II. THE LI KA SHING CENTER FOR LEARNING AND KNOWLEDGE BRINGS TOGETHER CUTTING-EDGE MEDICINE, MODERN EDUCATION AND ADVANCED TECHNOLOGY TO TRAIN THE PHYSICIANS OF TOMORROW. MEDICAL STUDENTS PRACTICE LIFE-SAVING SKILLS IN REALISTIC SIMULATIONS AND LEARN TO APPLY RESEARCH TO BEDSIDE TREATMENTS. THE CENTER IS A GATHERING PLACE FOR MEDICAL EXPERTS TO SHARE RESEARCH AND HEALTH CARE INSIGHTS AND TO BRING THEIR COMBINED EXPERTISE TO BEAR ON THE WORLD'S GREATEST HEALTH CHALLENGES. III. THE JAMES AND ANNA MARIE SPILKER ENGINEERING AND APPLIED SCIENCES BUILDING FOSTERS COLLABORATIVE DEVELOPMENT IN THE BURGEONING FIELD OF NANOTECHNOLOGY. RESEARCH ACTIVITIES SPAN A BROAD RANGE OF AREAS FROM PHOTONICS AND QUANTUM ENGINEERING TO SINGLE-MOLECULE BIOPHYSICS AND EXPLORATION OF NANOSCALE PROPERTIES AND DEVICES WITH POTENTIAL APPLICATIONS AS DIVERSE AS WATER PURIFICATION, ENERGY CONSERVATION, DRUG DELIVERY AND NATIONAL SECURITY. IV. THE HUANG ENGINEERING CENTER HOUSES THE SCHOOL OF ENGINEERING, WHOSE TIES TO THE HIGH-TECHNOLOGY INDUSTRY CONTINUE TO FUEL THE GROWTH AND ECONOMY OF SILICON VALLEY AND NORTHERN CALIFORNIA. THE SCHOOL OF ENGINEERING IS WORLD RENOWNED FOR PUSHING THE FRONTIERS OF MODERN SCIENCE AND ENGINEERING, ESPECIALLY IN THE FIELDS OF COMPUTER SCIENCE, BIOENGINEERING AND ENVIRONMENTAL SUSTAINABILITY. V. THE LORRY I. LOKEY STEM CELL RESEARCH BUILDING IS THE LARGEST DEDICATED STEM CELL RESEARCH BUILDING IN THE COUNTRY. THE BUILDING HOUSES THE STANFORD STEM CELL BIOLOGY AND REGENERATIVE MEDICINE INSTITUTE, WHICH INTEGRATES RESEARCHERS FROM CANCER, NEUROSCIENCE, CARDIOVASCULAR MEDICINE, TRANSPLANTATION, IMMUNOLOGY, BIOENGINEERING AND DEVELOPMENTAL BIOLOGY. ALL ARE FOCUSED ON MAKING DISCOVERIES IN STEM CELL RESEARCH AND QUICKLY TRANSLATING THEM INTO PRECLINICAL APPLICATIONS, INNOVATIVE THERAPIES AND TREATMENTS. VI. THE MUNGER GRADUATE RESIDENCE IS A FIVE-BUILDING, 358 UNIT RESIDENTIAL COMPLEX FOR APPROXIMATELY 600 STANFORD LAW AND OTHER GRADUATE STUDENTS. IT IS A SIGNIFICANT INVESTMENT BY STANFORD IN MITIGATING TRAFFIC AND OTHER ENVIRONMENTAL CONCERNS AS IT GREATLY REDUCES THE NUMBER OF PEOPLE DRIVING TO CAMPUS DAILY. VII. THE WILLIAM H. NEUKOM BUILDING, WHICH HOUSES THE CLINICS OF THE STANFORD LAW SCHOOL, OPENED IN 2011 AND WAS BUILT TO SATISFY THE EQUIVALENT OF A LEED GOLD CERTIFICATION FOR SUSTAINABILITY. THE BUILDING USES 30 PERCENT LESS ENERGY THAN REQUIRED BY CODE. THE BUILDING HOUSES THE MILLS LEGAL CLINIC, WHICH INCLUDES 11 CLINICS THAT TEACH THROUGH EXPERIENTIAL EDUCATION. LAW STUDENTS LEARN THE PRACTICE OF LAW BY REPRESENTING, FOR INSTANCE, LOW-INCOME OR INDIGENT PEOPLE IN CIVIL AND CRIMINAL LITIGATIONS, AND BY PROVIDING LEGAL COUNSEL ON ENVIRONMENTAL ISSUES, INTELLECTUAL PROPERTY, HUMAN RIGHTS, IMMIGRATION, NONPROFIT CORPORATE GOVERNANCE, EDUCATION, AND RELIGIOUS FREEDOM. VIII. STANFORD ENERGY SYSTEM INNOVATIONS (SESI) IS A STATE-OF-THE-ART ENERGY SYSTEM EMPLOYING HEAT RECOVERY, RENEWABLE ELECTRICITY, AND ADVANCED CONTROLS TO SERVE THE POWER, HEATING AND COOLING NEEDS OF THE UNIVERSITY. IT INCLUDES A CENTRAL ENERGY FACILITY AND ELECTRICAL SUBSTATION, ENERGY DISTRIBUTION INFRASTRUCTURE AND MARKET-BASED ENERGY PROCUREMENT PROGRAM. SESI REDUCES STANFORD'S GREENHOUSE GAS EMISSIONS BY 68% AND WATER USE BY 15%. SESI HAS RECEIVED THE HIGHEST HONORS AT THE REGIONAL, STATE AND NATIONAL LEVELS FOR ENERGY ECONOMICS, EFFICIENCY AND SUSTAINABILITY, INCLUDING THE STATE OF CALIFORNIA GOVERNOR'S ENVIRONMENT AND ECONOMIC LEADERSHIP AWARD AND THE ENERGY EFFICIENCY GLOBAL FORUM, ALLIANCE TO SAVE ENERGY: ENERGY EFFICIENCY VISIONARY AWARD, AMONG OTHERS. IX. THE SAPP CENTER FOR TEACHING AND LEARNING OFFERS ADAPTIVE CLASSROOMS FOR CHEMISTRY AND BIOLOGY, RECOGNIZING THEIR INEXTRICABLE LINK IN LIFE SCIENCES RESEARCH AND IN MEDICINE. IT ALLOWS STUDENTS TO BUILD STRONG FOUNDATIONS IN THESE SCIENCES AND LEARN TO THINK CREATIVELY ACROSS DISCIPLINES. THE 60,000 SQUARE FOOT BUILDING INCLUDES A 300 SEAT AUDITORIUM, LABORATORY SPACE, A SCIENCE LIBRARY COMBINING THE UNIVERSITYS BIOLOGY, CHEMISTRY, MATHEMATICS, STATISTICS AND CHEMICAL ENGINEERING COLLECTIONS AND AMPLE STUDY SPACE.
