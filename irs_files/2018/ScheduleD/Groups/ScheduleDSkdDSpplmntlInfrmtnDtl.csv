Examples of tax positions common to universities include such matters as the following: the tax exempt status of each entity and various positions relative to potential sources of unrelated business taxable income (UBIT). UBIT is reported on Form 990-T, as appropriate. The benefit of tax position is recognized in the financial statements in the period during which, based on all available evidence, management believes that it is more likely than not that the position will be sustained upon examination, including the resolution of appeals or litigation processes, if any.

Its endowment includes both donor-restricted endowment funds and funds designated by the Board of Trustees to function as endowments. As required by U.S. generally accepted accounting principles (GAAP), net assets associated with endowment funds, including funds designated by the Board of Trustees to function as endowments, are classified and reported based on the existence or absence of donor-imposed restrictions. The College has adopted investment and spending policies for endowment assets that attempt to provide a predictable stream of funding to programs supported by its endowment while seeking to maintain the purchasing power of the endowment assets. Endowment assets include those assets of donor-restricted funds that the College must hold in perpetuity or for a donor-specified period(s) as well as board-designated funds. Under this policy, as approved by the Board of Trustees, the endowment assets are invested in a manner that is intended to produce results that exceed the price and yield results of appropriate market indices while assuming a moderate level of investment risk. The College's investment objectives are to provide a total return sufficient to support the College's operating budget while preserving the assets against inflation. To meet these objectives the Board seeks a total return of at least 5% greater than the rate of inflation as measured by the Consumer Price Index (U.S. CPI-U) over a long-term horizon. Total return is defined as dividends or interest income, plus or minus realized and unrealized capital appreciation or depreciation at fair market value, net of fees. The maximum amount of endowment income utilization is determined by a spending formula approved by the Board of Trustees. The amount available for spending is set at 5% of the previous three-year average market value for the years ended June 30, 2017 and 2016, respectively. The amounts available to be distributed, net of unspent endowment income, under the spending policy were $596,399 and $525,306 for the years ended June 30, 2017 and 2016, respectively. These amounts are included in change in net assets from operations. Investment income greater or less than the amounts available to be distributed under the spending policy is reported as nonoperating income."

HIS PLAN EMPHASIZED THE IMPORTANCE OF COLLECTING WORKS OF HIGH QUALITY, WHILE RECOGNIZING THE INSTRUCTIONAL VALUE OF PREPARATORY STUDIES AND UNFINISHED WORKS THAT SHOW AN ARTIST'S WORKING METHOD. GUIDED BY THIS PLAN, THE MUSEUM ASSEMBLED IMPORTANT HOLDINGS OF FRENCH ART OF THE NINETEENTH CENTURY, INCLUDING SUPERB WORKS BY EDGAR DEGAS, JEAN-BAPTISTE-CAMILLE COROT, GUSTAVE COURBET, PAUL CEZANNE, CLAUDE MONET AND OTHERS. THE PLAN WAS REVISITED IN THE EARLY 1990S, AND ACQUIRING WORKS BY WOMEN ARTISTS AND ARTISTS OF COLOR BECAME A COLLECTING PRIORITY.

Tax benefits will be recognized only if the tax position is more-likely-than-not sustained in a tax examination, with a tax examination being presumed to occur. The amount recognized will be the largest amount of tax benefit that is greater than 50% likely of being realized on examination. For tax positions not meeting the more-likely-than-not test, no tax benefit will be recorded. Management has concluded that they are unaware of any tax benefits or liabilities to be recognized at June 30, 2017 and 2016.

The University is subject to federal and state income taxes on any net income from unrelated business activities. The University files a Form 990 (Return of Organization Exempt from Income Tax) annually. When these returns are filed, it is highly certain that some positions taken would be sustained upon examination by the taxing authorities, while others are subject to uncertainty about the merits of the tax position taken or the amount of the position that would ultimately be sustained. Examples of tax positions common to universities include such matters as the following: the tax exempt status of each entity and various positions relative to potential sources of unrelated business taxable income (UBIT). The benefit of tax position is recognized in the financial statements in the period during which, based on all available evidence, management believes that it is more likely than not that the position will be sustained upon examination, including the resolution of appeals or litigation processes, if any. Tax positions are not offset or aggregated with other positions. Tax positions that meet the ""more likely than not"" recognition threshold are measured as the largest amount of tax benefit that is more than 50% likely to be realized on settlement with the applicable taxing authority. The portion of the benefits associated with tax positions taken that exceeds the amount measured as described above is reflected as a liability for uncertain tax benefits in the accompanying statements of financial position along with any associated interest and penalties that would be payable to the taxing authorities upon examination. As of May 31, 2016 and 2015, there were no uncertain tax benefits identified and recorded as a liability."

It is management's belief that none of its activities have produced material unrelated business income, and that the University has operated in a manner that qualifies it for tax-exempt status. U.S. generally accepted accounting principles require University management to evaluate tax positions taken by the University and recognize a tax liability (or asset) if the University has taken an uncertain position that more likely than not would not be sustained upon examination by the IRS. Management has analyzed tax positions taken by the University and has concluded that as of May 31, 2017 and 2016, there are no uncertain positions taken or expected to be taken that would require recognition of a liability (or asset) or disclosure in the consolidated financial statements.

ASC 740-10 clarifies the accounting for uncertainty in tax positions taken or expected to be taken in a tax return, including issues relating to financial statement recognition and measurement. This section provides that the tax effects from an uncertain tax position can be recognized in the financial statements only if the position is ""more-likely-than-not"" to be sustained if the position were to be challenged by a taxing authority. The assessment of the tax position is based solely on the technical merits of the position, without regard to the likelihood that the tax position may be challenged. The College is exempt from federal and New York income taxation by virtue of being an organization described in Section 501(c)(3) of the IRC and similar provisions of the New York State tax code. Nevertheless, the College may be subject to tax on income unrelated to its exempt purpose, unless that income is otherwise excluded by the Code. The tax years ended June 30, 2014, 2015, 2016 and 2017 are still open to audit for both federal and state purposes.

THE COLLEGE'S SPENDING AND INVESTMENT POLICIES WORK TOGETHER TO ACHIEVE THIS OBJECTIVE. THE INVESTMENT POLICY ESTABLISHES AN ACHIEVABLE RETURN OBJECTIVE THROUGH DIVERSIFICATION OF ASSET CLASSES. THE CURRENT LONG-TERM RETURN OBJECTIVE IS TO ACHIEVE A TOTAL RETURN (INCOME PLUS CAPITAL CHANGE, NET OF ALL INVESTMENT EXPENSES) EQUAL TO OR EXCEEDING ANY APPROVED DISTRIBUTION RATE, PLUS THE INFLATION RATE AS MEASURED BY THE CONSUMER PRICE INDEX. ACTUAL RETURNS IN ANY GIVEN YEAR MAY VARY FROM THIS AMOUNT. TO SATISFY ITS LONG-TERM RATE-OF-RETURN OBJECTIVES, THE COLLEGE RELIES ON A TOTAL RETURN STRATEGY IN WHICH INVESTMENT RETURNS ARE ACHIEVED THROUGH BOTH CAPITAL APPRECIATION (REALIZED AND UNREALIZED) AND CURRENT YIELD (INTEREST AND DIVIDENDS). THE COLLEGE TARGETS A DIVERSIFIED ASSET ALLOCATION THAT PLACES AN EMPHASIS ON U.S. EQUITY-BASED INVESTMENTS AND U.S. INTERMEDIATE-TERM DEBT SECURITIES TO ACHIEVE ITS LONG-TERM RETURN OBJECTIVES WITHIN PRUDENT RISK PARAMETERS. THE SPENDING POLICY CALCULATES THE AMOUNT OF MONEY ANNUALLY DISTRIBUTED FROM THE COLLEGE'S VARIOUS ENDOWED FUNDS, FOR SCHOLARSHIPS, PROGRAMS AND ADMINISTRATION. THE COLLEGE UTILIZES A TOTAL RETURN SPENDING RATE POLICY WHICH LIMITS THE AMOUNT OF INVESTMENT RETURN USED TO SUPPORT CURRENT OPERATIONS. THE LIMIT IS DETERMINED BY THE COLLEGE'S CURRENT BUDGETED AMOUNT TO BE SPENT FOR THE YEAR. UNDER THE TOTAL SPENDING POLICY, THE COLLEGE UTILIZED 697,000 AND 680,000 IN 2017 AND 2016, RESPECTIVELY. THIS EQUATES TO APPROXIMATELY 2.36% IN 2017 AND 2.67% IN 2016 OF THE FAIR VALUE OF THE ENDOWMENT FUNDS.

ASC 740-10 clarifies the accounting for uncertainty in tax positions taken or expected to be taken in a tax return, including issues relating to financial statement recognition and measurement. This section provides that the tax effects from an uncertain tax position can be recognized in the consolidated financial statements only if the position is ""more-likely-than-not"" to be sustained if the position were to be challenged by a taxing authority. The assessment of the tax position is based solely on the technical merits of the position, without regard to the likelihood that the tax position may be challenged. The College is exempt from federal income taxation by virtue of being an organization described in Section 501(c)(3) of the Internal Revenue Code. Nevertheless, the College may be subject to tax on income unrelated to its exempt purpose, unless that income is otherwise excluded by the Code.

However, the Foundation is subject to federal income tax on any unrelated business taxable income. The Foundation is not considered to be a private foundation.

Management has determined that the College does not have any uncertain tax positions that materially impact the financial statements or related disclosures.Since tax matters are subject to some degree of uncertainty, there can be no assurance that the Colleges tax returns will not be challenged by the taxing authorities and that the College will not be subject to additional tax, penalties, and interest as a result of such challenge, although none is anticipated by management. Generally the Colleges tax returns remain open for federal and state income tax examination for three years from the date of filing."

The policy is intended to balance current spending needs and preserve the endowment's future purchasing power. The University applies a 4.5% spending rate to a three-year moving average of endowment investment funds. The Board of Regents sets the spending rate. The purpose of using a moving average is to smooth out any wide fluctuations in the market value. Endowment earnings in excess of the spending rate are added back to the principal of the endowment investments. In years when yield exceeds the amount appropriated under the spending policy the excess is returned to principal as appreciation. When annual yield is insufficient to support spending appropriations, the balance is provided from accumulated appreciation. Special allocations are made for certain purposes in addition to the spending rate, as approved by the University's Board of Regents, annually."

This section provides that the tax effects from an uncertain tax position can be recognized in the financial statements only if the position is ""more-likely-than-not"" to be sustained if the position were to be challenged by a taxing authority. The assessment of the tax position is based solely on the technical merits of the position, without regard to the likelihood that the tax position may be challenged. The University is exempt from Federal and New Jersey State Income taxation by virtue of being an organization described in Section 501(c)(3) of the IRC and similar provisions of the New jersey State tax code. Nevertheless, The University may be subject to tax on income unrelated to its exempt purpose, unless that income is otherwise excluded by the Code.The University believes that there are no material uncertain tax positions within its financial statements."

The University is not classified as a private foundation. The University files a Form 990 (Return of Organization Exempt from Income Tax) annually. When these returns are filed, it is highly certain that some positions taken would be sustained upon examination by the taxing authorities, while others are subject to uncertainty about the merits of the tax position taken or the amount of the position that would ultimately be sustained. Examples of tax positions common to universities include such matters as the following: the tax exempt status of each entity and various positions relative to potential sources of unrelated business income tax (""UBIT""). UBIT is reported on Form 990-T, as appropriate. The benefit of a tax position is recognized in the financial statements in the period during which, based on all available evidence, management believes that it is more likely than not that the position will be sustained upon examination, including the resolution of appeals or litigation processes, if any. Tax positions are not offset or aggregated with other positions. Tax positions that meet the ""more likely than not"" recognition threshold are measured as the largest amount of tax benefit that is more than 50% likely to be realized on settlement with the applicable taxing authority. The portion of the benefits associated with tax positions taken that exceeds the amount measured as described above would be reflected as a liability for uncertain tax benefits in the accompanying statements of financial position along with any associated interest and penalties that would be payable to the taxing authorities upon examination. As of May 31, 2017 and 2016, there were no uncertain tax positions identified. The University does not expect the total amount of unrecognized tax benefits to significantly change in the next 12 months. Forms 990 and 990-T filed by the University are subject to examination by the Internal Revenue Service (IRS) up to three years from the extended due date of each return. Management believes the Forms 990 and 990-T have been filed appropriately. Forms 990 and 990-T filed by the University are no longer subject to examination for the fiscal years ended May 31, 2013 and prior. The University would recognize interest and penalties related to unrecognized tax positions in interest and income tax expense, respectively. The University did not recognize or accrue any interest or penalties as of May 31, 2017 and 2016, and for the years then ended."

THERE IS ALSO A LARGE COLLECTION OF FOSSILS AND ROCKS AND MINERALS IN THE STORAGE AREA THAT IS IN THE PROCESS OF BEING INVENTORIED. MANY LOCAL TEACHERS BRING THEIR CLASSES TO THE JURICA-SUCHY NATURE MUSEUM TO FOCUS ON PARTICULAR THEMES TO ENHANCE THEIR CURRICULUM. THE STUDENTS TAKE A BRIEF TOUR; VISIT THE LEARNING CIRCLE UNDER THE WHALE TO TOUCH DIFFERENT SPECIMENS AND THEN SET OFF TO WORK ON AN ACTIVITY SHEET SELECTED BY THE TEACHER. BECAUSE THE MUSEUM IS AN INTIMATE SPACE, FILLED WITH SPECIMENS, CHILDREN ARE ABLE TO MAKE OBSERVATIONS, EXPLORE DIFFERENCES AMONG THE SPECIMENS, AND THINK ABOUT THEM. THE MUSEUM HOSTS MANY HOME SCHOOL FAMILIES AND ALSO IS USED BY OUR BENEDICTINE STUDENTS FOR CLASS ASSIGNMENTS IN BIOLOGY, ART AND EDUCATION. THERE ARE OVER 5,000 VISITORS TO THE MUSEUM EACH YEAR. IN ADDITION, THE JURICA-SUCHY NATURE MUSEUM OFFERS A DISCOVERY BOX LOAN PROGRAM OF MORE THAN 40 BOXES FOR TEACHERS, HOME SCHOOL FAMILIES AND OTHER GROUPS. THE BOXES CONTAIN MUSEUM SPECIMENS, BACKGROUND INFORMATION, VISUAL AIDS, CURRICULAR GUIDES, AND SUGGESTED CLASSROOM ACTIVITIES. THIS PROGRAM REACHES AN ADDITIONAL 5,000 CHILDREN EACH YEAR.

The University files a Form 990 annually. When these returns are filed , it is highly certain that some positions taken would be sustained upon examination by the taxing authorities, while others are subject to uncertainty about the merits of the tax position taken or the amount of the position that would ultimately be sustained. Examples of tax positions common to universities include such matters as the following: the tax exempt status of each entity and various positions relative to potential sources of unrelated business income tax (UBIT). UBIT is reported on Form 990-T, as appropriate. The benefit of a tax position is recognized in the financial statements in the period during which, based on all available evidence, management believes that it is more likely than not that the position will be sustained upon examination, including the resolution of appeals or litigation processes, if any. Tax positions are not offset or aggregated with other positions. Tax positions that meet the ""more likely than not"" recognition threshold are measured as the largest amount of tax benefit that is more than 50% likely to be realized on settlement with the applicable taxing authority. The portion of the benefits associated with tax positions taken that exceeds the amount measured as described above would be reflected as a liability for uncertain tax benefits in the accompanying statements of financial position along with any associated interest and penalties that would be payable to the taxing authorities upon examination. As of June 30, 2017 and 2016, there were no uncertain tax positions identified. The University does not expect the total amount of unrecognized tax benefits to significantly change in the next 12 months. Forms 990 and 990-T filed by the University are subject to the examination by the IRS up to three years from the extended due date of each return. Management believes the Forms 990 and 990-T have been filed appropriately. The University would recognize interest and penalties related to unrecognized tax positions in interest and income tax expense, respectively. The University has no amounts accrued for interest or penalties as of June 30, 2017 and 2016."

Its endowment includes donor-restricted endowment funds, endowment pledges receivable and funds designated by the board of trustees to function as endowments. Net assets associated with endowment funds, including funds designated by the board of trustees to function as endowments, are classified and reported based on the existence or absence of donor-imposed restrictions. University management, subject to Board ratification, has interpreted the Uniform Prudent Management of Institutional Funds Act (UPMIFA) as requiring the preservation of the fair value of the original gift as of the gift date of the donor-restricted endowment funds absent explicit donor stipulations to the contrary. As a result of this interpretation, the University classifies as permanently restricted net assets (a) the original value of gifts donated to the permanent endowment, (b) the original value of subsequent gifts to the permanent endowment and (c) accumulations to the permanent endowment made in accordance with the direction of the applicable donor gift instrument at the time the accumulation is added to the fund. The remaining portion of the donor-restricted endowment fund that is not classified in permanently restricted net assets is classified as temporarily restricted net assets until those amounts are appropriated for expenditure by the University in a manner consistent with the standard of prudence prescribed by UPMIFA. In accordance with UPMIFA, the University will consider the following factors in making a determination to appropriate or accumulate donor-restricted endowment funds: (1) The duration and preservation of the fund. (2) The purposes of the organization and the donor-restricted endowment fund. (3) General economic conditions. (4) The possible effect of inflation and deflation. (5) The expected total return from income and the appreciation of investments. (6) Other resources of the organization. (7) The investment policies of the organization. From time to time, the fair value of assets associated with individual donor-restricted endowment funds may fall below the level that the donor or UPMIFA requires the University to retain as a fund of perpetual duration. There were no deficiencies of this nature as of June 30, 2017 and 2016."

The assessment of the tax position is based solely on the technical merits of the position, without regard to the likelihood that the tax position may be challenged.

The College accounts for the effect of any uncertain tax positions based on a ""more likely than not"" threshold to the recognition of the tax positions being sustained based on the technical merits of the position under scrutiny by the applicable taxing authority. If a tax position or positions are deemed to result in uncertainties of those positions, the unrecognized tax benefit is estimated based on a ""cumulative probability assessment"" that aggregates the estimated tax liablity for all uncertain tax positions. The College has identified its tax status as a tax exempt entity as its only significant tax position and has determined that such tax position does not result in an uncertainty requiring recognition. The College is not currently under examination by any taxing jurisdiction. The College's Federal and state income tax returns are generally open for examination for the past three years."

The University follows FASB guidance on accounting for uncertainty in income taxes, which addresses the determination of whether tax benefits claimed or expected to be claimed on a tax return should be recorded in the financial statements. Under this guidance, the University may recognize the tax benefit from an uncertain tax position only if it is more likely than not that the tax position will be sustained on examination by taxing authorities, based on the technical merits of the position. Examples of tax positions include the tax-exempt status of the University, the continued tax-exempt status of bonds issued by the University, and various positions related to the potential sources of unrelated business taxable income (UBIT). The tax benefits recognized in the financial statements from such a position are measured based on the largest benefit that has a greater than 50 percent likelihood of being realized upon ultimate settlement. The guidance on accounting for uncertainty in income taxes also addresses de-recognition, classification, interest and penalties on income taxes, and accounting in interim periods. At June 30, 2017 and 2016, there were no unrecognized tax benefits indentified or recorded as liabilites. The University file Forms 990 in the U.S. federal jurisdiction and the required states.

As a curricular resource for all areas of study, the role of the collection is to conserve, interpret, and present works of art to the students, faculty, and greater community. New acquisitions support the vision of the university as an environment for innovative thinking and artistic experimentation. HISTORY OF THE COLLECTION The university's legacy of supporting the freedom of artistic expression began in 1931 with the commissioning of two historically significant mural cycles: Jose Clemente Orozco's A Call for Revolution and Universal Brotherhood, and Thomas Hart Benton's epic America Today. Over the years, the university has hosted a roster of accomplished artists, writers, dancers, designers, historians, social scientists, and philosophers, creating a flourishing laboratory for experimentation and innovation. As an institution that embraced such diverse figures as poet Robert Frost, anthropologist Margaret Meade, art historian Meyer Schapiro, and composer/conceptual artist John Cage, The New School has always stood at the forefront of self-discovery and visionary social, intellectual, and aesthetic experimentation. The New School art collection was established in 1960 with a grant from the Albert A. List Foundation. The collection, grown to approximately 2,542 postwar and contemporary works of art, includes examples in almost all media by some of the most innovative and creative artists of our time. Installed throughout the university campus and transforming the public spaces into lively forums for examining contemporary art, the collection offers students and faculty a rare opportunity to engage with art on a daily basis, making it a distinctive component of their educational experience. The collection has continued its tradition of incorporating site-specific works into its public spaces."
201821349349306022,133297197,"Part V, Line 4:","ENDOWMENT FUNDS The university's endowment is composed of approximately 304 individual funds established for a variety of purposes, including scholarships, professorships, faculty development, lectures, and research programs. The endowment consists of both donor restricted endowment funds and funds designated by the board of trustees to function as endowments. Net assets associated with endowment funds, including funds functioning as endowments, are classified and reported based on the existence or absence of donor imposed restrictions. The university's individual endowment funds are pooled for investment purposes. The investment portfolio is managed to achieve a prudent long term return. The university relies on a total return strategy in which investment returns are achieved through both capital appreciation (realized and unrealized) and current yield (interest and dividends). The university targets a diversified asset allocation that places a greater emphasis on equity based investments to achieve its long term return objectives within prudent risk constraints. The endowment assets are invested to provide a real total return that preserves the purchasing power of the endowment, while generating an income stream to support the academic activities of the university. Actual returns may vary from this goal in any given year. The university's endowment spending policy is designed to provide a sustainable and predictable flow of funds to support annual operations. The spending policy is intended to balance current spending needs and to preserve the endowment's future purchasing power. The university applies a board specified spending rate to a moving average of endowment investment funds. The purpose of using a moving average is to smooth out any wide fluctuations in the market value. Endowment earnings in excess of the spending rate are added back to the principal of the endowment investments."

The College is also recognized by the Franchise Tax Board as exempt from California state tax on related income under Section 23701d of the California Revenue and Taxation Code. The College has identified and evaluated significant tax positions in its significant tax jurisdictions which are the federal and California state tax jurisdictions. The College has also determined that the open tax years are generally three years for federal and four years for California tax purposes. Thus, the general open tax years are the years ended June 30, 2013 through June 30, 2016 for federal purposes and the years ended June 30, 2012 through June 30, 2016 for California purposes. For federal there is an unrelated business income net operating loss carryover of approximately $1,529,000 and $1,475,000 as of June 30, 2017 and 2016, respectively. For California there is an unrelated business income net operating loss carryover of approximately $1,529,000 and $1,475,000 as of June 30, 2017 and 2016, respectively. For federal, the tax effect of the net operating loss was approximately $535,000 and $501,000 as of June 30, 2017 and 2016, respectively. For California, the tax effect of the net operating loss was approximately $128,000 and $130,000 as of June 30, 2017 and 2016, respectively. A net operating loss can only be reflected as a benefit (deferred tax asset) on the statement on financial position when it is likely that the loss would be utilized against taxable income in another tax year. Since there is not presently a likelihood of taxable income in another tax year, the College has a valuation allowance against the deferred tax asset for federal and California for the full amount of approximately $663,000 and $631,000 as of June 30, 2017 and 2016, respectively. Therefore, there is no deferred tax asset on the statement on financial position and there have been no related tax penalties or interest, which would be classified as tax expense in the statement of activities. The net change during the year in the total valuation allowance was $32,000. operating loss only are the years ended June 30, 2005 through June 30, 2007 and June 30, 2010 to June 30, 2016 for federal purposes and the years ended June 30, 2007 through June 30, 2008 and June 30, 2010 to June 30, 2017 for California purposes. The net operating loss carryover will begin to expire June 30, 2025 for federal purposes and June 30, 2017 for California purposes. The College applies ASC 740-10-25, Accounting for Uncertainty in Income Taxes, to all tax positions for which the statute of limitations remained open and determined there were no material unrecognized tax benefits as of the year ended June 30, 2017 and the year ended June 30, 2016, nor are any changes anticipated in the twelve months following June 30, 2017."

The second step is to measure the tax benefit as the largest amount that is more than 50% likely of being realized upon settlement. The University classifies the liability for unrecognized tax benefits as current to the extent that the University anticipates payment (or receipt) of cash within one year. Interest and penalties related to uncertain tax positions are recognized and recorded as necessary in the provision for income taxes.

IT IS USED TO ADVANCE THE KNOWLEDGE AND APPRECIATION OF ART AND ART MUSEUMS THROUGH PROGRAMS INVOLVING RESEARCH, TEACHING, PROFESSIONAL TRAINING, AND PUBLIC EDUCATION. ARNOLD ARBORETUM: THE ARNOLD ARBORETUM OF HARVARD UNIVERSITY IS THE OLDEST PUBLIC ARBORETUM IN NORTH AMERICA AND ONE OF THE WORLD'S LEADING CENTERS FOR THE STUDY OF PLANTS. ADMINISTERED BY THE OFFICE OF THE PROVOST OF HARVARD UNIVERSITY AND A LINK IN BOSTON'S EMERALD NECKLACE OF PARKS, THE ARNOLD ARBORETUM IS A UNIQUE BLEND OF RESPECTED RESEARCH INSTITUTION AND BELOVED PUBLIC LANDSCAPE. WE PROVIDE AND SUPPORT WORLD-CLASS RESEARCH, HORTICULTURE, AND EDUCATION PROGRAMS THAT FOSTER THE UNDERSTANDING, APPRECIATION, AND PRESERVATION OF TREES. COLLECTION OF HISTORICAL SCIENTIFIC INSTRUMENTS: HARVARD UNIVERSITY HAS BEEN ACQUIRING SCIENTIFIC INSTRUMENTS ON A CONTINUOUS BASIS FOR TEACHING AND RESEARCH SINCE 1672. THE COLLECTION OF HISTORICAL SCIENTIFIC INSTRUMENTS, WHICH WAS ESTABLISHED IN 1948 TO PRESERVE THIS APPARATUS AS A RESOURCE FOR TEACHING AND RESEARCH IN THE HISTORY OF SCIENCE AND TECHNOLOGY, HAS BECOME ONE OF THE THREE LARGEST UNIVERSITY COLLECTIONS OF ITS KIND IN THE WORLD. IT CONTAINS OVER 20,000 OBJECTS DATING FROM ABOUT 1400 TO THE PRESENT. A BROAD RANGE OF SCIENTIFIC DISCIPLINES ARE REPRESENTED, INCLUDING ASTRONOMY, NAVIGATION, HOROLOGY, SURVEYING, GEOLOGY, CALCULATING, PHYSICS, BIOLOGY, MEDICINE, PSYCHOLOGY, ELECTRICITY, AND COMMUNICATION. SIGNIFICANT INSTRUMENTS, MADE OBSOLETE BY NEW TECHNOLOGIES, CONTINUE TO BE INCORPORATED. MANY OF THE DOCUMENTS DETAILING THE PURCHASE AND USE OF THE INSTRUMENTS HAVE BEEN PRESERVED, AND ARE AVAILABLE FOR RESEARCH IN THE COLLECTION'S ADJUNCT LIBRARY. MUSEUM OF COMPARATIVE ZOOLOGY (WITHIN THE MUSEUM OF NATURAL HISTORY): THE MUSEUM OF COMPARATIVE ZOOLOGY (THE MCZ) WAS FOUNDED IN 1859 ON THE CONCEPT THAT COLLECTIONS ARE AN INTEGRAL AND FUNDAMENTAL COMPONENT OF ZOOLOGICAL RESEARCH AND TEACHING. THIS 150-YEAR-OLD COMMITMENT REMAINS A STRONG AND PROUD TRADITION FOR THE MCZ. THE PRESENT-DAY MCZ CONTAINS OVER 21 MILLION SPECIMENS IN TEN RESEARCH COLLECTIONS WHICH COMPRISE ONE OF THE WORLD'S RICHEST AND MOST VARIED RESOURCES FOR STUDYING THE DIVERSITY OF LIFE. THE MUSEUM SERVES AS THE PRIMARY REPOSITORY FOR ZOOLOGICAL SPECIMENS COLLECTED BY PAST AND PRESENT HARVARD FACULTY-CURATORS, STAFF AND ASSOCIATES CONDUCTING RESEARCH AROUND THE WORLD. AS A PREMIER UNIVERSITY MUSEUM AND RESEARCH INSTITUTION, THE SPECIMENS AND THEIR RELATED DATA ARE AVAILABLE TO RESEARCHERS OF THE SCIENTIFIC AND MUSEUM COMMUNITY. USE OF THE COLLECTIONS IN STUDENT RESEARCH IS ALSO ENCOURAGED. FISHER MUSEUM HARVARD FOREST: THE FISHER MUSEUM'S MAIN EXHIBIT DISPLAYS TWENTY-THREE INTERNATIONALLY ACCLAIMED MODELS (DIORAMAS) PORTRAYING THE HISTORY, CONSERVATION AND MANAGEMENT OF CENTRAL NEW ENGLAND FORESTS. OTHER EXHIBITS AT THE MUSEUM REPRESENT THE RANGE OF HARVARD FOREST'S RESEARCH. HARVARD UNIVERSITY HERBARIA (WITHIN MUSEUM OF NATURAL HISTORY): THE HARVARD UNIVERSITY HERBARIA ARE AMONG SOME SEVERAL THOUSAND COLLECTIONS OF PRESSED, DRIED PLANT SPECIMENS WORLDWIDE THAT ARE USED BY RESEARCHERS TO FURTHER OUR UNDERSTANDING OF THE PLANT WORLD. SOME OF THE EARLIEST HERBARIA WERE FOUNDED IN EUROPE IN THE EARLY 1600'S, DURING THE DAYS OF EXPLORATION, WHEN KNOWLEDGE OF THE EARTH'S FLORA WAS GROWING AT SUCH A RAPID PACE THAT BOTANICAL GARDENS COULD NO LONGER MAINTAIN LIVING EXAMPLES OF EVERY KNOWN SPECIES. WHILE HERBARIUM COLLECTIONS OF ALL SIZES EXIST TODAY, THERE ARE FEWER THAN 75 HERBARIA WORLDWIDE WITH MORE THAN ONE MILLION SPECIMENS. HERBARIUM COLLECTIONS HAVE BEEN BUILT BY THE EFFORTS OF NUMEROUS BOTANISTS AND PLANT COLLECTORS WHO SEARCHED FROM REMOTE AND ISOLATED JUNGLES TO INNER CITY WASTE LOTS AND RAILROAD TRACKS TO DOCUMENT THE DIVERSITY AND DISTRIBUTION OF THE EARTH'S FLORA. REPRESENTATIVES OF MOST KNOWN SPECIES OF PLANTS CAN BE FOUND IN HERBARIA TODAY, CAREFULLY MOUNTED ON SHEETS OF ARCHIVAL QUALITY PAPER, LABELED WITH IMPORTANT INFORMATION ABOUT THEM, AND STORED ON SHELVES IN CABINETS. IN ESSENCE, A HERBARIUM IS ANALOGOUS TO A LIBRARY OF CAREFULLY PRESERVED PLANTS WHERE THE SPECIMENS THEMSELVES AND THE LABELS ASSOCIATED WITH THEM PROVIDE A WEALTH OF INFORMATION ONCE THEY HAVE BEEN ""READ"" AND STUDIED BY SCIENTISTS. THE SPECIMENS ARE THE KEY TO UNDERSTANDING PLANT RELATIONSHIPS, GEOGRAPHIC DISTRIBUTIONS, ECONOMIC USEFULNESS, EVEN THEIR MOLECULAR MAKEUP. AS WE LOSE NATURAL HABITATS THE WORLD OVER, HERBARIA INCREASINGLY SERVE AS A RECORD OF THE RECENT HISTORY OF PLANT LIFE, AND AS A REPOSITORY OF PRECIOUS GENETIC INFORMATION. HERBARIA HOLD THE TOOLS FOR OUR UNDERSTANDING OF THE PLANT WORLD. MINERALOGICAL AND GEOLOGICAL MUSEUM (WITHIN MUSEUM OF NATURAL HISTORY): THE HARVARD MINERAL COLLECTION RANKS AMONG THE WORLD'S FINEST DUE TO ITS VERY BROAD REPRESENTATION, WEALTH OF RARE SPECIES; LARGE NUMBER OF SPECIMENS DESCRIBED IN THE SCIENTIFIC LITERATURE; AND THE QUALITY OF ITS DISPLAY SPECIMENS. A RICH SYSTEMATIC MINERAL COLLECTION AND DISPLAYS OF GEMSTONES ARE THE PRINCIPAL EXHIBITS IN THE MINERAL GALLERY. THE MUSEUM IS COMMITTED TO THE DEVELOPMENT AND PRESERVATION OF WORLD-CLASS COLLECTIONS OF MINERALS, GEMS, ROCKS, ORES, AND METEORITES FOR RESEARCH, EDUCATION, AND PUBLIC DISPLAY. ITS EARLIEST COLLECTIONS DATE BACK TO THE LATE 18TH CENTURY. THE MUSEUM CATERS TO THE HARVARD STUDENTS AND FACULTY AS WELL AS THE GEOLOGICAL COMMUNITY AT LARGE BY SERVING AS A UNIQUELY RICH RESOURCE OF MATERIALS AND INFORMATION. PEABODY MUSEUM OF ARCHAEOLOGY AND ETHNOLOGY: THE PEABODY MUSEUM OF ARCHAEOLOGY AND ETHNOLOGY IS STEWARD TO ONE OF THE OLDEST AND LARGEST COLLECTIONS OF CULTURAL OBJECTS IN THE WESTERN HEMISPHERE. SINCE THE LATE NINETEENTH CENTURY, THE MUSEUM HAS PLAYED AN ACTIVE PART IN THE HISTORY OF AMERICAN ANTHROPOLOGY AND IN THE EVOLVING RELATIONSHIP BETWEEN MUSEUMS AND NATIVE PEOPLES. THE PEABODY STRIVES TO MAKE COLLECTIONS WIDELY ACCESSIBLE AND ENGAGE ISSUES OF CONCERN TO DIVERSE AUDIENCES. TODAY, THE PEABODY HOUSES MORE THAN SIX MILLION INDIVIDUAL OBJECTS, 500,000 PHOTOGRAPHIC IMAGES, AND SUBSTANTIAL ARCHIVAL RECORDS. STRONGEST IN THE CULTURES OF NORTH, CENTRAL, AND SOUTH AMERICA, AND THE PACIFIC ISLANDS, THE PEABODY IS ALSO CARETAKER TO IMPORTANT COLLECTIONS FROM AFRICA, EUROPE, AND ASIA. COLLECTION TYPES INCLUDE ARCHAEOLOGY; ETHNOGRAPHY; OSTEOLOGY; AND PAINTING, DRAWING, AND PRINTS. SEMITIC MUSEUM: THE SEMITIC MUSEUM IS HOME TO THE UNIVERSITY'S COLLECTIONS OF NEAR EASTERN ARCHAEOLOGICAL ARTIFACTS. THESE ARTIFACTS COMPRISE OVER 40,000 ITEMS, INCLUDING POTTERY, CYLINDER SEALS, SCULPTURE, COINS AND CUNEIFORM TABLETS. MANY ARE FROM MUSEUM-SPONSORED EXCAVATIONS IN ISRAEL, JORDAN, IRAQ, EGYPT, CYPRUS, AND TUNISIA. THE MUSEUM IS DEDICATED TO THE USE OF THESE COLLECTIONS FOR THE TEACHING, RESEARCH, AND PUBLICATION OF NEAR EASTERN ARCHAEOLOGY, HISTORY, AND CULTURE. WARREN ANATOMICAL MUSEUM: THE WARREN ANATOMICAL MUSEUM'S PRESENT COLLECTION CONTAINS APPROXIMATELY 15,000 ARTIFACTS AND CASES INCLUDING: ANATOMICAL AND PATHOLOGICAL PREPARATIONS; VARIOUS WAX, PAPER MACHE, AND DRY PREPARATION ANATOMICAL MODELS; PHOTOGRAPHS, PRINTS, PAINTINGS, AND DRAWINGS; MEDICAL INSTRUMENTS AND MACHINES; AND OTHER MEDICAL MEMORABILIA. ALONG WITH THE WELL-KNOWN SKULL OF PHINEAS GAGE, THE MUSEUM HOLDS MANY OTHER RARE AND INTERESTING ITEMS. AMONG THESE ARE THE PHRENOLOGICAL COLLECTION OF JOHANN GASPAR SPURZHEIM, THE BOSTON SOCIETY FOR MEDICAL IMPROVEMENT COLLECTION, AND A W. T. G. MORTON-TYPE ETHER INHALER. THE MUSEUM PROMOTES THE COLLECTION FOR THE PURPOSES OF MEDICAL EDUCATION IN ALL FORMS WHENEVER POSSIBLE, BY EXPANDING ITS SCOPE TO PROVIDE PUBLIC PROGRAMMING AND EDUCATIONAL RESOURCES TO THE LARGER COMMUNITY. CARPENTER CENTER FOR THE VISUAL ARTS: CARPENTER CENTER FOR THE VISUAL ARTS IS DEDICATED TO THE SYNTHESIS OF ART, DESIGN, AND EDUCATION THROUGH THE EXHIBITION OF EXISTING WORKS AND PRODUCTION OF NEW COMMISSIONS. IT STRIVES TO BRING PEOPLE, IDEAS, AND OBJECTS TOGETHER IN GENERATIVE WAYS THAT PROVIDE UNPARALLELED EXPERIENCES WITH CONTEMPORARY ART, ULTIMATELY ENRICHING THE CREATIVE AND INTELLECTUAL LIVES OF THEIR AUDIENCES."

The College has interpreted Ohio's enacted version of UPMIFA as requiring the preservation of the fair value of the original gift as of the gift date absent explicit donor instructions to the contrary. The College classifies as permanently restricted net assets the original gift value plus the value of subsequent gifts to the permanent endowment. The permanent endowment is not reduced by losses on the investments, except to the extent required by the donor, or by appropriations from the endowment fund. The accumulated portion of a donor-restricted fund that is not permanently restricted is classified as temporarily restricted net assets until appropriated for expenditure by the College in a manner consistent with the standard of prudence prescribed by Ohio's enacted version of UPMIFA.

As such, the College is generally not subject to federal or state income taxes except for amounts derived from unrelated business activities as defined by the IRC. The College adopted the accounting standard on accounting for uncertainty in income taxes, which addresses the determination of whether tax benefits claimed or expected to be claimed on a tax return should be recorded in the financial statements. Under this guidance, the College may recognize the tax benefit from an uncertain tax position only if it is more likely than not that the tax position will be sustained on examination by taxing authorities, based on the technical merits of the position. Examples of tax positions include the tax-exempt status of the College, the continued tax-exempt status of bonds issued by the College, and various positions related to the potential sources of unrelated business taxable income (UBIT). The tax benefits recognized in the financial statements from such a position are measured based on the largest benefit that has a greater than 50 percent likelihood of being realized upon ultimate settlement. The guidance on accounting for uncertainty in income taxes also addresses de-recognition, classification, interest and penalties on income taxes, and accounting in interim periods. At June 30, 2017 and 2016, there were no unrecognized tax benefits identified or recorded as liabilities. With few exceptions, the College is no longer subject to examinations by tax authorities for fiscal years prior to 2014."

Those accumulated restricted endowment investment gains of $13,039,828 were incorrectly recorded to unrestricted net assets and in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles should be recorded to temporarily restricted net assets and then released to unrestricted in accordance with the College's spending policy. In addition, a gift of $8,096 was incorrectly recorded as an endowment gift and was adjusted to temporarily restricted. The effect of this change has been reflected in the beginning of year balance for the current year."

THE FUNDS ARE INVESTED IN PERPETUITY FOR LONG TERM GROWTH AND THE PAYOUT FROM AN ENDOWMENT FUND IS USED FOR THE PURPOSE SET FORTH IN THE GIFT DOCUMENT. SOME ENDOWMENT FUNDS DO NOT HAVE PURPOSE RESTRICTIONS AND THE PAYOUT FROM THESE FUNDS IS USED TO SUPPORT THE GENERAL OPERATIONS AND INFRASTRUCTURE OF THE UNIVERSITY AS WELL AS MANY OTHER PARTS OF THE UNIVERSITY.

SINCE 2000, THE UNIVERSITY HAS CONTINUED TO ENHANCE ITS FINANCIAL AID PROGRAMS FOR BOTH ITS UNDERGRADUATE AND GRADUATE STUDENTS. CURRENTLY, FAMILIES WITH TYPICAL ASSETS FROM THE U.S. WITH INCOMES BELOW $125,000 PAY NO TUITION, AND THOSE WITH INCOMES BELOW $65,000 PAY NO TUITION, ROOM OR BOARD.

Other uses of the funds include, but are not limited to, providing study abroad and research opportunities, creation and funding of faculty chairs, support for student services and activities, library acquisitions and funding for lecture series. The primary objective of the portfolio is to achieve an annualized total return, net of fees, through appreciation and income, equal to or greater than the rate of inflation plus any spending and administrative expenses thus, at a minimum maintaining the purchasing power of the portfolio. The investments are managed under the Uniform Prudent Investor Act standard requiring the exercise of reasonable care, skill, and caution while being applied to investments not in isolation, but in the context of the portfolio as a whole and as a part of an overall strategy having risk and return objectives reasonably suited to the portfolio. Since short term market fluctuations may cause variations in investment performance, it is intended that the objectives will be achieved over a full market cycle."

The majority of the endowment funds are designated for student awards, but there are a few in place with the intent to help support a particular program. The University's endowment consists of approximately 100 individual funds established for a variety of purposes. Its endowment includes both donor-restricted endowment funds and funds designated by the Board of Trustees to function as endowments. As required by accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of America, net assets associated with endowment funds, including funds designated by the Board of Trustees to function as endowments, are classified and reported based on the existence or absence of donor-imposed restrictions. The Board of Trustees of the University has interpreted Pennsylvania law as requiring the preservation of the fair value of the original gift as of the gift date of the donor-restricted endowment funds absent explicit donor stipulations to the contrary. As a result of this interpretation, the University classifies as permanently restricted net assets (a) the original value of gifts donated to the permanent endowment, (b) the original value of subsequent gifts to the permanent endowment, and (c) accumulations to the permanent endowment made in accordance with the direction of the applicable donor gift instrument at the time the accumulation is added to the fund. The remaining portion of the donor-restricted endowment fund that is not classified in permanently restricted net assets is classified as either temporarily restricted or unrestricted net assets based on the existence of donor restrictions or by law. The University considers the following factors in making a determination to appropriate or accumulate donor-restricted endowment funds: 1. The duration and preservation of the fund 2. The purposes of the University and the donor-restricted endowment fund 3. General economic conditions 4. The possible effect of inflation and deflation 5. The expected total return from income and the appreciation of investments 6. Other resources of the University 7.

Examples of tax positions include the tax-exempt status of the College and various positions related to the potential sources of unrelated business taxable income. The tax benefits recognized in the financial statements from such a position are measured based on the largest benefit that has a greater than 50 percent likelihood of being realized upon ultimate settlement. The guidance on accounting for uncertainty in income taxes also addresses de-recognition, classification, interest and penalties on income taxes, and accounting in interim periods.

As required by Internal Revenue Service regulations, the University annually files Form 990, ""Return of Organization Exempt from Income Tax,"" with the Internal Revenue Service. The University also files Form 990T, ""Exempt Organization Business Income Tax Return,"" for the operations of the Kellogg Conference Center. The University follows the accounting guidance for uncertainty in income taxes using the provisions of FASB ASC 740, Income Taxes. Using that guidance, tax positions initially need to be recognized in the financial statements when it is more likely than not the position will be sustained upon examination by the taxing authorities. Such tax provisions initially and subsequently need to be measured as the largest amount of tax benefit that has a greater than 50 percent likelihood of being realized upon ultimate settlement with the taxing authority assuming full knowledge of the position and relevant facts. The University believes that it has appropriate support for the income tax positions taken and to be taken on its tax returns and that its accruals for tax liabilities are adequate for all open tax years based on an assessment of many factors, including experience and interpretations of tax laws applied to the facts of each matter. The University has concluded that there are no significant uncertain tax positions requiring disclosure, and there are no material amounts of unrecognized tax benefits."

This guidance requires the evaluation of tax positions taken or expected to be taken in the course of preparing the Univeristy's tax returns to determine whether the tax positions are ""more-likely-than-not"" of being sustained by the applicable tax authority. Tax positions not deemed to meet the more-likely-than-not threshold are required to be recorded as a tax benefit or expense in the current year.

The University objectives are to make the collections a focus for research, teaching, and collection-based scholarship within the University. The collections are used as a research resource for a wide range of scholarly users, a facility for interaction between the University and the public and an active contributor to the region's cultural development. The tens of millions of objects in the University's collections provide a resource of international importance for scholars and the public. The University's gardens, libraries and museums offer extensive programmes of public events, including talks, tours and family-friendly activities. Earlier this year the Mindgrowing campaign was launched, a major programme to encourage people to explore the many wonders of Oxford's collections, with a particular focus on encouraging access by local families. In February 2017, a cross-collections trail, Out in Oxford, was launched to celebrate diversity and LGBTQ+ History Month. The Sensing Culture project has seen the community outreach team work with the RNIB to develop new tools and services to support blind and partially sighted people to engage with the collections. The gardens, libraries and museums host a wide range of exhibitions each year. In 2016/17, highlights included 'Power and Protection' at the Ashmolean, the first major exhibition to explore the supernatural in Islamic art; 'Back from the Dead' at the Museum of the History of Science, celebrating the 75th anniversary of the first human trials of penicillin, conducted in Oxford; 'Identity without Borders' at the Pitt Rivers, co-curated by refugees to share stories from their home countries; and 'Raphael: the drawings' featuring original research from the Ashmolean and the University of Kent. The collections also work closely with the academic divisions to give insights into the latest research and scholarship. The Brain Diaries exhibition at the Museum of Natural History was developed in partnership with Oxford Neuroscience. It charts the fascinating changes that take place in the brain with each new chapter of life and features specimens from the museum's collections. The hugely successful Super Science Saturday events at the Museum of Natural History and late-night Live Fridays at the Ashmolean Museum continued, including Science Behind the Headlines, LinguaMania produced with the Creative Multilingualism programme, and FRIGHTFriday developed with The Oxford Research Centre in the Humanities, which was also the finale for the national 2016 Being Human Festival."
