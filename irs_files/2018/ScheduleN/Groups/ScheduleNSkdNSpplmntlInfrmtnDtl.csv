In exchange for the Property, payments were made to pay off the outstanding long term bonds payable plus interest and to retire other long-term obligations of the University. The effect of which, reflected in the statements of financial position, is a significant reduction in educational and other properties, pay-off of the previous revolving line of credit and extinguishment of bonds payable as of June 30, 2017. The effect on the statements of activities is a loss on the early extinguishment of debt of $1,138,807 and loss on the sale of educational and other properties of $1,626,919. The Corporation owning the Property then entered into a long-term agreement to lease the Property back to the University for a lease term of 50 years at a discounted rate. The University has recorded the lease as a capital lease and prepaid the entire amount of rent due per the lease agreement. The University will recognize the difference between the fair value of the rental payments and the minimum rental payments per the executed agreement as contribution revenue and rent expense each year. Approximately, $342,000 of rent expense and corresponding private gift and grant revenue is included in the statement of activities for the year ended June 30, 2017. For tax purposes, the value of the difference between the fair value of the rental payments and the minimum rental payments as contribution revenue and rent expense are not reported in the form 990, in the statement of revenue and statement of expenses for the year ended June 30, 2017."
