201733179349306133,226019101,"PART III, LINE 8","Medicare costs were derived from the 2016 Medicare cost report. The organization's position is that Medicare underpayments and bad debt are community benefits and associated costs should be includable on Form 990, Schedule H, Part I as outlined more fully below. The organization believes that these services and related costs promote health of the community as a whole and are rendered in conjunction with the organization's charitable tax-exempt purpose and mission in providing medically necessary healthcare services to all individuals in a non-discriminatory manner without regard to race, color, creed, sex, national origin, religion or ability to pay and consistent with the Community Benefit Standard promulgated by the IRS. The Community Benefit Standard is the current standard for a hospital for recognition as a tax-exempt and charitable organization under the Internal Revenue Code (IRC) 501(c)(3). The organization is recognized as a tax-exempt and charitable organization under the Internal Revenue Code (IRC) 501(c)(3). Although there is no definition in the tax code for the term ""charitable"", a regulation promulgated by the Department of the Treasury provides some guidance and states that the term charitable is used in section 501(c)(3) in its generally accepted legal sense, and provides examples of charitable purposes, including the relief of the poor or underprivileged, the promotion of social welfare, and the advancement of education and science. Note, it does not explicitly address the activities of hospitals in the absence of explicit statutory or regulatory requirements applying the term ""charitable"" to hospitals, it has been left to the IRS to determine the criteria hospitals must meet to qualify as an IRC 501(c)(3) charitable organization. The original standard was known as the Charity Care Standard. This standard was replaced by the IRS with the Community Benefit Standard which is the current Charity Care Standard. In 1956, the IRS issued revenue ruling 56-185, which addressed the requirements hospitals needed to meet in order to qualify for IRC 501(c)(3) status. One of these requirements is known as the Charity Care Standard. Under the standard, a hospital had to provide, to the extent of its financial ability, free or reduced-cost care to patients unable to pay for it. A hospital that expected full payment did not, according to the ruling, provide charity care. The ruling emphasized that a low level of charity care did not necessarily mean that a hospital had failed to meet the requirement since that level could reflect its financial ability to provide such care. The ruling also noted that a publically supported community hospital would normally qualify as a charitable organization because it serves the entire community, and a low level of charity care would not affect a hospitals exempt status if it was due to the surrounding community lack of charitable demands. In 1969, the IRS issued revenue ruling 69-545 which removed from ruling 56-185 the requirements relating to caring for patients without charge or at rates below costs. Under the standard developed in ruling 69-545, which is know as the ""Community Benefit Standard"", hospitals are judged on whether they promote health of a broad class of individuals in the community. The ruling involved a hospital that only admitted individuals who could pay for the services (by themselves, private insurance, or public programs such as Medicare), but operated a full-time Emergency Room that was open to everyone. The IRS ruled that the hospital qualified as a charitable organization because it promoted the health of people in its community. The IRS reasoned that because the promotion of health was a charitable purpose according to the general law of charity, it fell within the ""generally accepted legal sense"" of the term ""charitable"", as required by Treasury Regulation 1.501 (c)(3)-1(d)(2). The IRS ruling stated that the promotion of health, like the relief of poverty and the advancement of education and religion, is one of the purposes in the general law of charity that is deemed beneficial to the community as a whole, even though the class of beneficiaries eligible to receive a direct benefit from its activities does not include all members of the community, such as indigent members of the community, provided that the class is not so small that its relief is not of benefit to the community. The IRS concluded that the hospital was promoting the health of a class of persons that is broad enough to benefit the community because its Emergency Room was open to all and it provided care to everyone who could pay, whether directly or through third-party reimbursement. Other characteristics of the hospital that the IRS highlighted included the following: 1). Its surplus funds were used to improve patient care, expand hospital facilities, and advance medical training, education and research. 2). It was controlled by a Board of Trustees that consisted of independent civic leaders. 3). Hospital medical staff privileges were available to all qualified physicians. The organization believes that Medicare underpayments and bad debt are community benefits and associated costs should be includable on Form 990, Schedule H, Part I. The American Hospital Association's (AHA) position is that Medicare underpayments and bad debt are community benefits and associated costs should be includable on Form 990, Schedule H, Part I. This organization agrees with the AHA position as outlined in the AHA letter to the IRS dated August 21, 2007. With respect to the first published draft of the new Form 990 and Schedule H, the AHA felt that the IRS should incorporate the full value of the community benefit that hospitals provide by counting Medicare underpayments as quantifiable community benefit for the following reasons; 1). Providing care for the elderly and serving Medicare patients is an essential part of the Community Benefit Standard. 2). Medicare, like Medicaid, does not pay the full cost of care. Medicare reimburses the hospital only 89 cents for every dollar they spend to take care of Medicare patients. 3). Many Medicare beneficiaries, like their Medicaid counterparts, are poor. More than 46 percent of Medicare spending is for beneficiaries whose income is below 200 percent Federal poverty level. Many of those Medicare beneficiaries are also eligible for Medicaid, so called dual eligibles. There is every compelling public policy reason to treat Medicare and Medicaid underpayments similarly for the purposes of a hospital's community benefit and include the costs on Form 990, Schedule H, Part I. Medicare underpayment must be shouldered by the hospital in order to continue treating the community's elderly and poor. These underpayments represent a real cost of serving the community and should count as a quantifiable community benefit. Both the AHA and this organization also feel that patient bad debt is a community benefit and thus includable on Form 990, Schedule H, Part I. Like Medicare underpayment, there also are compelling reasons that patient bad debt should be counted as a quantifiable community benefit. A significant majority of bad debt is attributable to low-income patients, who, for many reasons, decline to complete the forms required to establish eligibility for the hospital's Charity Care or Financial Assistance programs. A 2006 Congressional Budget Office Report, Nonprofit Hospitals and the Provision of Community Benefits, cited two studies indicating that ""the great majority of bad debt was attributable to patients with incomes below 200 percent of the Federal Poverty Line"". The report also noted that a substantial portion of bad debt is pending Charity Care. Unlike bad debt in other industries, hospital bad debt is complicated by the fact that hospitals follow their mission to the community and treat every patient that comes through their Emergency department, regardless of their ability to pay. Patients who have outstanding bills are not turned away, unlike other industries. Bad debt is further complicated by auditing industry standards on reporting Charity Care, many patients cannot or do not provide the necessary extensive documentation required to be deemed Charity Care by the auditors. As a result, roughly 40% of bad debt is pending Charity Care."

BILLING AND COLLECTION PROCEDURES ------------------------------------------------------------- ONCE A PATIENTS CLAIM IS PROCESSED BY THEIR INSURANCE, JFK WILL SEND THE PATIENT A BILL INDICATING THE PATIENT RESPONSIBILITY. ADDITIONALLY, IF A PATIENT HAS NO THIRD-PARTY COVERAGE THEY WILL RECEIVE A BILL INDICATING THEIR PATIENT RESPONSIBILITY. THIS WILL BE THE PATIENTS FIRST POST DISCHARGE BILLING STATEMENT. THE DATE ON THIS STATEMENT WILL BEGIN THE APPLICATION AND NOTIFICATION PERIODS. AFTER THE PATIENT RECEIVES THEIR FIRST POST DISCHARGE BILLING STATEMENT, JFK SENDS OUT 3 ADDITIONAL STATEMENTS (4 TOTAL BILLING STATEMENTS, IN 28 DAY INTERVALS) AND 2 LETTERS. IF PAYMENT HAS NOT BEEN RECEIVED AFTER 4 BILLING STATEMENTS, JFK WILL SEND OUT A LETTER INFORMING THE PATIENT IN WRITING THAT THE ACCOUNT WILL BE SENT TO COLLECTIONS IF PAYMENT IS NOT RECEIVED WITHIN 30 DAYS. ADDITIONALLY, THE LETTER WILL INCLUDE THE EXTRAORDINARY COLLECTION ACTIONS (""ECAS"") THAT MAY TAKE PLACE AFTER THE PATIENT ACCOUNT HAS BEEN PLACED IN COLLECTIONS. THE WRITTEN NOTICE WILL ALSO INCLUDE A COPY OF THE ORGANIZATIONS PLAIN LANGUAGE SUMMARY. WHEN BILLING INVOICES ARE RETURNED STATING THE PATIENT EXPIRED OR ARE UNDELIVERABLE AND NO OTHER ADDRESS IS FOUND THE ACCOUNTS GO TO A PRE-COLLECT STATUS FOR FOLLOW-UP AND VALIDATION. COLLECTIONS WITHIN THE BILLING CYCLE JFK MAY SEND ACCOUNTS TO PRE-COLLECT. DURING THIS TIME, THIRD PARTIES ACTING ON BEHALF OF JFK MAY CONTACT THE PATIENTS VIA TELEPHONE TO COLLECT PAYMENT. NO ECAS WILL BE TAKEN AGAINST THE PATIENT WHILE THE ACCOUNT IS IN THE PRE-COLLECTION CYCLE. AFTER THE EXPIRATION OF THE NOTIFICATION PERIOD, JFK WILL SEND THE PATIENT ACCOUNT TO COLLECTIONS. COLLECTION AGENCY TECHNIQUES TO COLLECT PAYMENT WILL INCLUDE TELEPHONE CALLS, LETTERS AND CERTAIN ECAS. ALL OF THEIR ACTIVITIES WILL BE COMPLETELY DOCUMENTED WITHIN THE BILLING SYSTEM AND WILL FOLLOW ALL GUIDELINES OF STATE REGULATIONS GOVERNING COLLECTION AGENCIES. IF COLLECTION AGENCIES ARE THEREAFTER UNSUCCESSFUL (FOR A PERIOD NOT TO EXCEED 180 DAYS) THE PATIENT ACCOUNT WILL BE RETURNED TO JFK. AT THE TIME THE ACCOUNT IS RETURNED, THE COLLECTION AGENCY WILL INCLUDE COMPLETE DOCUMENTATION OF THEIR ACTIVITIES AND FINDINGS WHEN COMMUNICATION IS MADE WITH THE PATIENT AS WELL AS THE DATE THE ACCOUNT IS RETURNED BACK TO JFK. COMPLIANCE WITH IRC 501(R)(6) -------------------------------------------------- IN ACCORDANCE WITH IRC 501(R)(6), JFK DOES NOT ENGAGE IN ANY ECAS PRIOR TO THE EXPIRATION OF THE NOTIFICATION PERIOD. SUBSEQUENT TO THE NOTIFICATION PERIOD JFK, OR ANY THIRD PARTIES ACTING ON ITS BEHALF, MAY INITIATE THE FOLLOWING ECAS AGAINST A PATIENT FOR AN UNPAID BALANCE IF A FAP-ELIGIBILITY DETERMINATION HAS NOT BEEN MADE OR IF AN INDIVIDUAL IS INELIGIBLE FOR FINANCIAL ASSISTANCE: - REPORTING ADVERSE INFORMATION ABOUT THE INDIVIDUAL TO CONSUMER CREDIT REPORTING AGENCIES OR CREDIT BUREAUS; - PLACING A LIEN ON AN INDIVIDUALS PROPERTY; - FORECLOSING ON AN INDIVIDUALS REAL PROPERTY; - ATTACHING OR SEIZING AN INDIVIDUALS BANK ACCOUNT OR OTHER PERSONAL PROPERTY; - COMMENCING A CIVIL ACTION AGAINST AN INDIVIDUAL; AND - GARNISHING AN INDIVIDUALS WAGES.

Medicare underpayments (shortfall) and bad debt are community benefit and associated costs, in our opinion, should be includable on the Form 990, Schedule H, Part I. As outlined more fully below, the organization believes that these services and related costs promote the health of the community as a whole and are rendered in conjunction with the organization's charitable tax-exempt purposes and mission in providing medically necessary healthcare services to all individual's in a non-discriminatory manner without regard to race, color, creed, sex, national origin, religion or ability to pay and consistent with the community benefit standard promulgated by the IRS. The community benefit standard is the current standard for a hospital for recognition as a tax-exempt and charitable organization under internal revenue code (IRC) section 501(c)(3). The organization is recognized as a tax-exempt entity and charitable organization under IRC section 501(c)(3). Although there is no definition in the tax code for the term charitable, a regulation promulgated by the department of the treasury provides some guidance and states that the term charitable is used in IRC section 501(c)(3) in its generally accepted legal sense, and provides examples of charitable purposes, including the relief of the indigent or unprivileged; the promotion of social welfare; and the advancement of education, religion, and science. Note it does not explicitly address the activities of hospitals. In the absence of explicit statutory or regulatory requirements applying the term charitable to hospitals, it has been left to the IRS to determine the criteria hospitals must meet to qualify as IRC section 501(c)(3) charitable organizations. The original standard was known as the charity care standard. This standard was replaced by the IRS with the community benefit standard which is the current standard."

SPECIFIC GOALS AND STRATEGIES MAY OR MAY NOT BE OBTAINED AND, UPON EVALUATION AND THE AVAILABILITY OF NEW INFORMATION AND DEVELOPMENTS, MAY NEED TO BE MODIFIED. A SUCCESSFUL STRATEGIC PLAN RECOGNIZES THIS POTENTIAL FOR CHANGE AND IS FLEXIBLE ENOUGH TO ACCOMMODATE NEW OR DIFFERENT OPPORTUNITIES AND CHALLENGES.CRITICAL HEALTH CARE ISSUESTHE ENACTED HEALTHCARE REFORM LEGISLATION UNDERSCORES MANY OF THESIGNIFICANT ISSUES CURRENTLY FACING HOSPITALS. FOLLOWING IS LISTING OFCRITICAL ISSUES THAT WILL IMPACT HOSPITALS OVER THE NEXT SEVERAL YEARS.1. QUALITY: HEALTH CARE QUALITY AND SAFETY ARE NOW STRATEGICALLY IMPORTANT, NOT JUST PROFESSIONALLY IMPORTANT. THE ADVENT OF WIDESPREADPUBLIC REPORTING OF HOSPITAL QUALITY RESULTS ASSURES THAT A HOSPITAL'SQUALITY PERFORMANCE IS NO LONGER ONLY VISIBLE TO THE DIRECTOR OF QUALITY,QA COMMITTEE MEMBERS AND VARIOUS REGULATORS. THE NET EFFECT OF THISTRANSPARENCY TREND OVER THE NEXT 5 YEARS WILL BE THAT THE DEFINITION OF A""GOOD HOSPITAL"" WILL SHIFT SIGNIFICANTLY. NO LONGER WILL IT BE ENOUGH TOHAVE ATTRACTIVE FACILITIES, GOOD TECHNOLOGIES AND SKILLED DOCTORS ANDNURSES. HOSPITALS WILL NEED TO MARSHAL THOSE RESOURCES INTO A QUALITY ANDSAFETY SYSTEM CAPABLE OF RELIABLY PRODUCING MEASURED QUALITY RESULTS.PROVIDER PAYMENTS WILL INCREASINGLY BE A FUNCTION OF QUALITY OUTCOMES ANDQUALITY BONUSES WILL BE DRAWN FROM ANNUAL PAYMENT UPDATES. INFORMATIONSYSTEMS CAPABLE OF PROVIDING VALID AND RELIABLE QUALITY AND OUTCOMEINDICATORS WILL BE A NECESSITY AS WILL THE USE OF EVIDENCE BASEDGUIDELINES BY CLINICAL PROVIDERS. CONSUMERS WILL SEEK AND USE PERFORMANCEINFORMATION, INCLUDING PATIENT SATISFACTION INFORMATION, TO GUIDE THEIRCHOICE OF PROVIDERS.2. INFORMATION TECHNOLOGY: HEALTH INFORMATION TECHNOLOGY INCLUDES COMPUTER BASED TOOLS DEVELOPED SPECIFICALLY FOR HEALTH CARE DELIVERY. THESE TOOLS CAN PROVIDE CLINICIANS UP-TO-DATE INFORMATION ON THEIR PATIENTS, ACCESS TO THE LATEST MEDICAL KNOWLEDGE AND BEST PRACTICES THROUGH DECISION SUPPORT SYSTEMS. IT IS UNDERSTOOD THAT INVESTMENTS IN NEW CLINICAL AND INFORMATION TECHNOLOGY CAN SIGNIFICANTLY ENHANCE PATIENT SAFETY AND CLINICAL OUTCOMES. COMPUTERIZED PHYSICIAN ORDER ENTRY (CPOE), BAR CODING AND ITS POTENTIAL TO REDUCE MEDICATION ERRORS, AND ELECTRONIC MEDICAL RECORDS (EMRS) AND THEIR POSITIVE IMPACT ON MEDICAL ERRORS ARE ALL EXAMPLES OF HEALTH CARE'S USE OF IT SOLUTIONS TO IMPROVE QUALITY. THE FEDERAL GOVERNMENT HAS HIGHLIGHTED THE ROLE OF HEALTH INFORMATION TECHNOLOGY AS A MEANS TO IMPROVE HEALTH CARE QUALITY, SAFETY AND NOW IS PROVIDING STIMULUS AND INCENTIVE PAYMENTS TO PROVIDERS TO FACILITATE AND HASTEN THEIR ADOPTION INTO THE CARE DELIVERY PROCESS. EMR'S WILL BECOME A PREREQUISITE OF ANY DELIVERY SYSTEM THAT INTENDS TO PROVIDE COORDINATED COST EFFECTIVE CARE.3. PHYSICIANS: PHYSICIANS HAVE EMERGED AS CRITICAL OPERATIONAL ANDSTRATEGIC PARTNERS TO HOSPITALS. THOSE THAT ARE SUCCESSFUL IN ENGAGING ANDCOLLABORATING WITH THEIR MEDICAL STAFF WILL BE BEST ABLE TO DEMONSTRATEHIGH QUALITY CARE AND COMPLIANCE WITH HEALTH REFORM'S VALUE BASEDPURCHASING AND OTHER QUALITY MANDATES. ADDITIONALLY, GIVEN THE INCREASEIN DEMAND FOR HEALTHCARE SERVICES THAT WILL BE OCCASIONED BY REFORM, THEABILITY TO SUCCESSFULLY RECRUIT PHYSICIANS WILL BE CRITICAL. AT A TIMEWHEN HEALTHCARE REFORM INITIATIVES EMPHASIZE THE ROLE OF PRIMARY CARE,THERE IS A SPECIAL NEED TO INTENSIFY EFFORTS TO RECRUIT PRIMARY CAREPROVIDERS. BECAUSE THE VAST MAJORITY OF NEW PHYSICIANS PREFER EMPLOYMENTAS THEIR PRACTICE PREFERENCE, THE ABILITY OF HOSPITALS TO BE ABLE TO OFFERPHYSICIANS A CONTEMPORARY AND COMPETITIVE ""EMPLOYMENT PLATFORM"" ISESSENTIAL.4. FINANCE AND CAPITAL: FINANCIAL PERFORMANCE AND ACCESS TO CAPITAL WILL CONTINUE TO BE AMONG THE MOST CRITICAL ISSUES CONFRONTING HOSPITALS. EVEN WITH HEALTHCARE REFORM, HEALTHCARE COSTS WILL CONTINUE TO OUTPACE INFLATION. INCREASING WAGE AND SALARY COSTS, AND RISING HEALTH CARE COSTSIN GENERAL WILL CONTINUE TO IMPACT OPERATING PERFORMANCE AND PRESSHOSPITALS TO CONTINUE A RELENTLESS FOCUS ON COST MANAGEMENT. ADDITIONALLY,REVENUE STRATEGIES WILL NEED TO BE DEVELOPED TO GENERATE PROFITABLE GROWTHIN PATIENT VOLUME, AS WILL THE NEED TO ENSURE OPTIMAL MANAGEMENT OF ALLREVENUE CYCLE ACTIVITIES. HOSPITALS ARE FACING SIGNIFICANT PAYMENT REDUCTIONS IN TERMS OF DECREASES IN MEDICARE UPDATES, DISPROPORTIONATESHARE, SNF AND HOMECARE PAYMENTS. AS HOSPITALS CONTINUE TO POST LOW OR NOPROFIT MARGINS, INVESTMENT INCOME WILL BE MORE IMPORTANT THAN EVER.HOWEVER, GIVEN THE FACT THAT INVESTMENT INCOME IS A HIGHLY UNCERTAINCOMPONENT OF A HOSPITAL'S OVERALL FINANCIAL HEALTH, HOSPITALS WILL BEDRIVEN TO PURSUE MORE PHILANTHROPY. HOSPITAL CAPITAL SPENDING WILL BEDRIVEN BY GROWING DEMANDS FOR ADVANCED TECHNOLOGY NEEDED TO ENSURE PATIENTQUALITY AND SAFETY, THE NEED TO REPLACE AND UPDATE AGING FACILITIES, ANDTHE DESIRE AND NEED TO IMPROVE TECHNOLOGY BASED SERVICES.IN 2016 BRMC'S BOARD OF DIRECTORS VOTED TO BECOME PART OF THE KALEIDA HEALTH SYSTEM, A BUFFALO, NEW YORK-BASED HEALTH SYSTEM. THIS DECISION WAS BASED ON A FIVE YEAR LONG-TERM FINANCIAL PLAN THAT WAS DEVELOPED FOR BRMC AND ITS SISTER HOSPITAL UNDER BRMC'S PARENT COMPANY- UPPER ALLEGHENY HEALTH SYSTEM (UAHS), WHICH DEMONSTRATED A FUTURE INABILITY TO REMAIN FINANCIALLY VIABLE GIVEN THE DOWNWARD PRESSURES ON REVENUE IN THE HEALTH CARE INDUSTRY AS WELL AS RISING COSTS TO PROVIDE CARE. BRMC IS NOT UNIQUE IN THIS VULNERABLE POSITION. HOSPITALS ACROSS AMERICA, ESPECIALLY RURAL HOSPITALS, FACE A DAUNTING CHALLENGE OF SURVIVAL.

RESEARCH HAS CONTINUALLY SHOWN THAT WHEN THE FACTORS INFLUENCING HEALTH ARE EXPLORED, HEALTH CARE ACTUALLY PLAYS THE SMALLEST ROLE PROPORTIONATELY. A REPORT IN THE JOURNAL OF AMERICAN MEDICAL ASSOCIATION AND THE CENTER FOR DISEASE CONTROL (MCGINNIS, 1996) SUGGESTS THAT THE FACTORS IMPACTING HEALTH ARE AS FOLLOWS: LIFESTYLE AND BEHAVIORS, 50%, ENVIRONMENT (HUMAN AND NATURAL), 20%, GENETICS AND HUMAN BIOLOGY, 20%, AND HEALTH CARE, 10%. COMMUNITY BUILDING ACTIVITIES HELP TO ADDRESS THE OTHER INDICATORS OUTSIDE OF THE ROLE TRADITIONALLY PLAYED BY HEALTH-CARE ORGANIZATIONS. THESE ACTIVITIES ARE ALMOST EXCLUSIVELY DONE IN SOME FORM OF PARTNERSHIP IN WHICH THE COMMUNITY OR OTHER ORGANIZATIONS ARE BETTER SUITED TO ADDRESS. HEALTH-CARE ORGANIZATIONS GENERALLY PROVIDE TIMELY AND SPECIFIC RESOURCES TO HELP THESE ISSUES. HEALTH-CARE ORGANIZATIONS CAN BE A RICH AND VALUABLE COMMUNITY RESOURCE IN WAYS NOT TYPICALLY CONSIDERED.

THE OPA NEGOTIATION IS A RESULT OF THE JOINT VENTURE'S CONVERSION FROM A GENERAL PARTNERSHIP TO A LIMITED LIABILITY COMPANY. NEGOTIATIONS HAVE TAKEN LONGER THAN EXPECTED, AND AS A RESULT, VBASC BOARD APPROVAL OF A REVISED FINANCIAL ASSISTANCE POLICY (""REVISED FAP"") CONTAINING ALL REQUIRED 501(R) TREASURY REGULATION ELEMENTS DID NOT OCCUR UNTIL OCTOBER 20, 2017. UP UNTIL THAT TIME, VBASC CONTINUED TO WIDELY PUBLICIZE ITS MOST RECENTLY ADOPTED FINANCIAL ASSISTANCE POLICY, APPROVED AND IMPLEMENTED IN 2013 TO COMPLY WITH IRC SECTION 501(R)(THE ""2013 FAP""). BECAUSE THE ELIGIBILITY CRITERIA FOR FINANCIAL ASSISTANCE WAS THE SAME UNDER THE 2013 FAP AND THE REVISED FAP, AND VBASC TOOK NO EXTRAORDINARY COLLECTION ACTIONS AGAINST INDIVIDUALS PRIOR TO ITS REASONABLE EFFORTS TO DETERMINE FINANCIAL ASSISTANCE ELIGIBILITY, NO INDIVIDUALS WERE ADVERSELY IMPACTED BY THE DELAY IN VBASC BOARD APPROVAL OF THE REVISED FAP.

THESE SERVICES AND PROGRAMS INCLUDE SENIOR BREAKFAST CLUBS WHICH INCLUDE EDUCATIONAL SPEAKERS FOCUSING ON HEALTH AND WELLNESS AND INCLUDE BLOOD PRESSURE SCREENINGS; CANCER SUPPORT GROUPS FOR VARIOUS TYPES OF CANCER INCLUDING, PROSTATE, BREAST AND SKIN CANCERS. THESE GROUPS FOCUS ON EDUCATING THE NEWLY DIAGNOSED AND PROVIDING INFORMATION ON BETTER LIVING FOR SURVIVORS.

PART VI, LINE 1 DESCRIPTION FOR PART I, LINE 7G ADVOCATE HEALTH & HOSPITALS CORPORATION PROVIDES SUBSIDIZED HEALTH SERVICES TO THE COMMUNITY. THESE SERVICES ARE PROVIDED DESPITE CREATING A FINANCIAL LOSS FOR AHHC. THESE SERVICES ARE PROVIDED BECAUSE THEY MEET AN IDENTIFIED COMMUNITY NEED. IF AHHC DID NOT PROVIDE THE CLINICAL SERVICE, IT IS REASONABLE TO CONCLUDE THAT THESE SERVICES WOULD NOT BE AVAILABLE TO THE COMMUNITY. THE SERVICES INCLUDED ARE BOTH INPATIENT AND OUTPATIENT PROGRAMS FOR, MENTAL, BEHAVIORAL AND CHEMICAL DEPENDENCY HEALTH SERVICES, REHABILITATION SERVICES, CARDIAC SURGERY, ORTHOPEDIC AND HOSPICE SERVICES. PART VI, LINE 1 DESCRIPTION FOR PART I, LINE 7H AHHC CONDUCTS NUMEROUS RESEARCH ACTIVITIES FOR THE ADVANCEMENT OF MEDICAL AND HEALTH CARE SERVICES. HOWEVER, THE UNREIMBURSED COST OF SUCH RESEARCH ACTIVITIES IS NOT READILY DETERMINABLE AND NO AMOUNT IS BEING REPORTED FOR PURPOSES OF THE 2016 FORM 990, SCHEDULE H. PART VI, LINE 1 DESCRIPTION FOR PART I, LINE 7, COLUMN (F) $184,299,859 OF BAD DEBT EXPENSE WAS INCLUDED ON FORM 990, PART IX, LINE 25, COLUMN (A), BUT WAS REMOVED FROM THE DENOMINATOR FOR PURPOSES OF SCHEDULE H, PART I, LINE 7, COLUMN (F). PART VI, LINE 1 - DESCRIPTION FOR PART II N/A PART VI, LINE 1 - DESCRIPTION FOR PART III, LINES 2, 3, AND 4 THE FOOTNOTES TO ADVOCATE HEALTH CARE NETWORK AND SUBSIDIARIES' AUDITED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS DO NOT SPECIFICALLY ADDRESS BAD DEBT EXPENSE; RATHER, THE FOOTNOTE DESCRIBES ADVOCATE'S PATIENT ACCOUNTS RECEIVABLE POLICY AND THE PERCENTAGE OF ACCOUNTS RECEIVABLE THAT THE ALLOWANCE FOR DOUBTFUL ACCOUNTS COVERS (SEE PAGE 11 OF THE AUDITED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS). FOR 2016, FOR AHHC, THE ALLOWANCE FOR DOUBTFUL ACCOUNTS COVERED 24.17% OF NET PATIENT ACCOUNTS RECEIVABLE. PATIENT ACCOUNTS RECEIVABLE ARE STATED AT NET REALIZABLE VALUE. AHHC EVALUATES THE COLLECTABILITY OF ITS ACCOUNTS RECEIVABLE BASED ON THE LENGTH OF TIME THE RECEIVABLE IS OUTSTANDING, PAYER CLASS, HISTORICAL COLLECTION EXPERIENCE, AND TRENDS IN HEALTH CARE INSURANCE PROGRAMS. ACCOUNTS RECEIVABLE ARE CHARGED TO THE ALLOWANCE FOR UNCOLLECTIBLE ACCOUNTS WHEN THEY ARE DEEMED UNCOLLECTIBLE. THE COSTING METHODOLOGY USED IN DETERMINING THE AMOUNTS REPORTED ON LINES 2 AND 3 IS BASED ON THE RATIO OF PATIENT CARE COST TO CHARGES. THE UNREIMBURSED COST OF BAD DEBT WAS CALCULATED BY APPLYING THE ORGANIZATION'S COST TO CHARGE RATIO FROM THE MEDICARE COST REPORTS (CMS 2252-96 WORKSHEET C, PART 1, PPS INPATIENT RATIOS) TO THE ORGANIZATION'S BAD DEBT PROVISION PER GENERALLY ACCEPTED ACCOUNTING PRINCIPLES, LESS ANY PATIENT OR THIRD PARTY PAYOR PAYMENTS RECEIVED. ADVOCATE MAKES EVERY EFFORT TO IDENTIFY THOSE PATIENTS WHO ARE ELIGIBLE FOR FINANCIAL ASSISTANCE BY STRICTLY ADHERING TO ITS FINANCIAL ASSISTANCE POLICY. WE BELIEVE THAT ADVOCATE HAS A POPULATION OF PATIENTS WHO ARE UNINSURED OR UNDERINSURED BUT WHO DO NOT COMPLETE THE FINANCIAL ASSISTANCE APPLICATION. THE ESTIMATED AMOUNT OF BAD DEBT EXPENSE (AT COST) WHICH COULD BE REASONABLY ATTRIBUTABLE TO PATIENTS WHO WOULD LIKELY QUALIFY FOR FINANCIAL ASSISTANCE UNDER THE ORGANIZATION'S FINANCIAL ASSISTANCE POLICY, IF SUFFICIENT INFORMATION HAD BEEN AVAILABLE TO MAKE A DETERMINATION OF THEIR ELIGIBILITY, WAS BASED UPON SELF PAY PATIENT ACCOUNTS WHICH HAD AMOUNTS WRITTEN OFF TO BAD DEBTS. OUR METHOD WAS TO BEGIN WITH THE SELF-PAY PORTION OF BAD DEBT EXPENSE PROVISION. THE SELF-PAY PORTION EXCLUDES THOSE PATIENTS WHO HAD CHARITY APPLICATIONS PENDING AT THE TIME OF SERVICE. THIS COST WAS THEN REDUCED BY CHARGES IDENTIFIED AS TRUE BAD DEBT EXPENSE, INCLUDING COPAYS FOR PATIENTS WHO QUALIFIED FOR LESS THAN 100% FINANCIAL ASSISTANCE. THE COST TO CHARGE RATIO WAS THEN APPLIED TO THE REMAINING CHARGES, TO DETERMINE THE VALUE (AT COST) OF PATIENT ACCOUNTS THAT DID NOT COMPLETE FINANCIAL COUNSELING AND WERE ASSIGNED TO BAD DEBT. WE BELIEVE THIS PROCESS IS A REASONABLE BASIS FOR OUR ESTIMATE. AS WE ARE ONLY CONSIDERING SELF-PAY ACCOUNTS WRITTEN OFF TO BAD DEBT FOR THIS ESTIMATE, THIS ESTIMATE DOES NOT INCLUDE THE IMMEDIATE 20% DISCOUNT TO CHARGES WHICH IS APPLIED TO ALL SELF-PAY PATIENTS. IT ALSO DOES NOT INCLUDE ACCOUNT BALANCES OR CO-PAYS OF NON-SELF PAY ACCOUNTS WHICH ARE WRITTEN OFF TO BAD DEBT WHEN THE PATIENT HAS NO OTHER FINANCIAL RESOURCES TO PAY THESE AMOUNTS AND THE PATIENT DOES NOT APPLY FOR FINANCIAL ASSISTANCE. BAD DEBT AMOUNTS HAVE BEEN EXCLUDED FROM OTHER COMMUNITY BENEFIT AMOUNTS REPORTED THROUGHOUT SCHEDULE H. PART VI, LINE 1 - DESCRIPTION FOR PART III, LINE 8 THE SHORTFALL OF $153,674,828 ON PART III, LINE 7 IS THE UNREIMBURSED COST OF PROVIDING SERVICES FOR MEDICARE PATIENTS AND SHOULD BE TREATED AS COMMUNITY BENEFIT BECAUSE PROVIDING THESE SERVICES WITHOUT REIMBURSEMENT LESSENS THE BURDENS OF GOVERNMENT OR OTHER CHARITIES THAT WOULD OTHERWISE BE NEEDED TO SERVE THE COMMUNITY. FOR ADVOCATE HEALTH AND HOSPITALS CORPORATIONS OPERATIONS, THE UNREIMBURSED COST OF MEDICARE WAS CALCULATED BY APPLYING THE ORGANIZATIONS COST TO CHARGE RATIO FROM THE MEDICARE COST REPORTS (CMS 2252-96 WORKSHEET C, PART 1, PPS INPATIENT RATIOS) AND FOR NON-HOSPITAL OPERATIONS THE COST TO CHARGE RATIO CALCULATED ON WORKSHEET 2 RATIO OF PATIENT CARE COST TO CHARGES TO THE ORGANIZATIONS MEDICARE, LESS ANY PATIENT OR THIRD PARTY PAYOR PAYMENTS AND/OR CONTRIBUTIONS RECEIVED THAT WERE DESIGNATED FOR THE PAYMENT OF MEDICARE PATIENT BILLS. PART VI, LINE 1 - DESCRIPTION FOR PART III, LINE 9B ADVOCATE HEALTH AND HOSPITALS CORPORATION MAINTAINS BOTH WRITTEN FINANCIAL ASSISTANCE AND BAD DEBT/COLLECTION POLICIES. THE BAD DEBT/COLLECTION POLICY DOES NOT APPLY TO THOSE PATIENTS KNOWN TO QUALIFY FOR CHARITY CARE OR OTHER FINANCIAL ASSISTANCE, THEREFORE SUCH PATIENTS ARE NOT SUBJECT TO COLLECTION PRACTICES."

APPROXIMATELY EIGHT PERCENT OF THE NORTH REGION SURVEY RESPONDENTS IDENTIFIED AS POLISH AND SIX PERCENT AS KOREAN. HICCC ALSO CONDUCTED EIGHT FOCUS GROUPS IN THE NORTH REGION FOR CHNA INPUT FROM FALL 2015 THROUGH SPRING 2016. THE COLLABORATIVE ENSURED THAT THE FOCUS GROUPS INCLUDED POPULATIONS WHO ARE TYPICALLY UNDERREPRESENTED IN COMMUNITY HEALTH NEEDS ASSESSMENTS. SOME EXAMPLES OF THE POPULATIONS INCLUDED ARE RACIAL AND ETHNIC MINORITIES, IMMIGRANTS, THE LGBQIA AND TRANSGENDER COMMUNITY, FORMERLY INCARCERATED INDIVIDUALS, VETERANS AND SENIORS.

WITH GREAT TEAM EFFORT, THE GOOD SAMARITAN HOSPITAL BETTER FOR US COMMITTEE (THE HOSPITALS WORKSITE WELLNESS COMMITTEE) AND SODIUM REDUCTION SUB-COMMITTEE WERE ABLE TO SUCCESSFULLY IMPLEMENT ALL OF THE SODIUM REDUCTION ACTION PLAN STRATEGIES. AFFORDABLE HOUSING WAS IDENTIFIED AS A NEED FOR DUPAGE COUNTY BY THE IMPACT DUPAGE STEERING COMMITTEE. HOUSING CAN HAVE A MAJOR IMPACT ON HEALTH AND IS CONSIDERED A SOCIAL DETERMINANT OF HEALTH. THE HOSPITALS COMMUNITY HEALTH MANAGER IS A MEMBER OF THE IMPACT DUPAGE AFFORDABLE HOUSING SUBCOMMITTEE AND HAS BEEN VERY ENGAGED IN THE ASSESSMENT AND PLAN DEVELOPMENT PROCESS. AS A PART OF THE ASSESSMENT AND PLANNING PROCESS, THE SUBCOMMITTEE WORKED WITH THE CHICAGO METROPOLITAN AGENCY FOR PLANNING TO COMPLETE THE DUPAGE COUNTY AFFORDABLE HOUSING ASSESSMENT AND PLAN. THE HOSPITAL RECOGNIZES THE IMPORTANCE AND IMPACT OF SOCIAL DETERMINANTS OF HEALTH AND WILL CONTINUE TO PARTICIPATE AND BE ENGAGED IN THE DEVELOPMENT AND IMPLEMENTATION OF THE AFFORDABLE HOUSING PLAN. ADVOCATE GOOD SHEPHERD HOSPITAL IN ADDITION TO THE FORMAL SURVEYS CONDUCTED FOR THE ASSESSMENT, THE HOSPITAL ALSO PARTNERS WITH LOCAL COMMUNITY GROUPS AND CONGREGATIONS TO HELP ASSESS NEEDS AND PROVIDE RESOURCES TO IMPROVE THE HEALTH STATUS OF INDIVIDUALS WITHIN THESE GROUPS. THE MISSION AND SPIRITUAL CARE TEAM AT THE HOSPITAL WORKS CLOSELY WITH SEVERAL COMMUNITY CONGREGATIONS TO SURVEY AND RESPOND TO SPECIFIC NEEDS IDENTIFIED THROUGH THIS PROCESS.

ADVOCATE SOUTH SUBURBAN HOSPITAL HEALTH IMPACT COLLABORATIVE OF COOK COUNTY ADVOCATE SOUTH SUBURBAN HOSPITAL IS A MEMBER OF THE HEALTH IMPACT COLLABORATIVE OF COOK COUNTY (HICCC). HICCC IS A PARTNERSHIP OF HOSPITALS, HEALTH DEPARTMENTS AND COMMUNITY ORGANIZATIONS WORKING TO ASSESS COMMUNITY HEALTH NEEDS AND ASSETS, AND TO IMPLEMENT A SHARED PLAN TO MAXIMIZE HEALTH EQUITY AND WELLNESS IN CHICAGO AND COOK COUNTY. THIS COLLABORATIVE WAS DEVELOPED SO THAT PARTICIPATING ORGANIZATIONS COULD EFFICIENTLY SHARE RESOURCES AND WORK TOGETHER ON DATA COLLECTION, PRIORITY SETTING AND IMPLEMENTATION PLANNING. COOK COUNTY WAS DIVIDED INTO NORTH, CENTRAL AND SOUTH REGIONS TO ENABLE THE INVOLVEMENT OF OTHER LOCAL STAKEHOLDERS AND IDENTIFY THE LOCAL NEEDS OF THIS DIVERSE COUNTY. SOUTH SUBURBAN HOSPITAL PARTICIPATED IN THE HICCC SOUTH REGION ASSESSMENT. THE METHODOLOGY FOR THE CHNA HAD THREE COMPONENTS: 1) THE MAPP PROCESS USED BY THE HEALTH IMPACT COLLABORATIVE OF COOK COUNTY (2/2015-6/2016); 2) USE OF THE HEALTHY COMMUNITIES INSTITUTES PLATFORM TO REVIEW COUNTY, SERVICE AREA AND ZIP CODE DATA (3/2014-8/2016); AND 3) REVIEW OF OTHER AVAILABLE NATIONAL AND LOCAL DATA (1/2016-8/2016). MAPP PROCESS THE HEALTH IMPACT COLLABORATIVE OF COOK COUNTY (HICCC) CONDUCTED A COLLABORATIVE CHNA BETWEEN FEBRUARY 2015 AND JUNE 2016. THE ILLINOIS PUBLIC HEALTH INSTITUTE (IPHI) DESIGNED AND FACILITATED A COLLABORATIVE, COMMUNITY-ENGAGED ASSESSMENT BASED ON THE MOBILIZING FOR ACTION THROUGH PLANNING AND PARTNERSHIPS (MAPP) FRAMEWORK. MAPP IS A COMMUNITY-DRIVEN STRATEGIC PLANNING FRAMEWORK THAT WAS DEVELOPED BY THE NATIONAL ASSOCIATION FOR COUNTY AND CITY HEALTH OFFICIALS (NACCHO) AND THE CENTERS FOR DISEASE CONTROL AND PREVENTION (CDC). BOTH THE CHICAGO AND COOK COUNTY DEPARTMENTS OF PUBLIC HEALTH USE THE MAPP FRAMEWORK FOR COMMUNITY HEALTH ASSESSMENT AND PLANNING. THE MAPP FRAMEWORK PROMOTES A SYSTEM FOCUS, EMPHASIZING THE IMPORTANCE OF COMMUNITY ENGAGEMENT, PARTNERSHIP DEVELOPMENT AND THE DYNAMIC INTERPLAY OF FACTORS AND FORCES WITHIN THE PUBLIC HEALTH SYSTEM. THE HICCC CHOSE THIS INCLUSIVE, COMMUNITY-DRIVEN PROCESS SO THAT THE ASSESSMENT AND IDENTIFICATION OF PRIORITY HEALTH ISSUES WOULD BE INFORMED BY THE DIRECT PARTICIPATION OF STAKEHOLDERS AND COMMUNITY RESIDENTS. THE MAPP FRAMEWORK EMPHASIZES PARTNERSHIPS AND COLLABORATION TO UNDERSCORE THE CRITICAL IMPORTANCE OF SHARED RESOURCES AND RESPONSIBILITY TO MAKE THE VISION FOR A HEALTHY FUTURE A REALITY. THE KEY PHASES OF THE MAPP PROCESS INCLUDE: - ORGANIZING FOR SUCCESS AND DEVELOPING PARTNERSHIPS - VISIONING - CONDUCTING THE FOUR MAPP ASSESSMENTS - IDENTIFYING STRATEGIC ISSUES - FORMULATING GOALS AND STRATEGIES - TAKING ACTION PLANNING, IMPLEMENTING, EVALUATING THE FOUR MAPP ASSESSMENTS ARE: - COMMUNITY THEMES AND STRENGTHS ASSESSMENT (CTSA) - FORCES OF CHANGE ASSESSMENT"

IN ADDITION TO PARTICIPATING IN THE COOK COUNTY COLLABORATIVE, CHRIST MEDICAL CENTER CONDUCTED A COMMUNITY HEALTH NEEDS ASSESSMENT TARGETING ITS DEFINED COMMUNITY-THE HOSPITALS PRIMARY SERVICE AREA (PSA). THIS AREA INCLUDES APPROXIMATELY 947,915 INDIVIDUALS WITHIN 27 ZIP CODES IN CHICAGO AND SUBURBAN COOK COUNTY. THE DIVERSE POPULATION SERVED IS 59% WHITE, 23% AFRICAN-AMERICAN, 2% ASIAN AND 13% OTHER. BY ETHNICITY, THE PSA IS 29.4% HISPANIC. NEARLY 17% OF THE PSA POPULATION OVER THE AGE OF 25 DOES NOT HAVE A HIGH SCHOOL DIPLOMA AS COMPARED TO 12% FOR ILLINOIS, WHILE ALMOST 13% OF ALL FAMILIES LIVE BELOW THE FEDERAL POVERTY LEVEL COMPARED TO 11% FOR ILLINOIS. THE MEDIAN AGE FOR THE PSA IS 37.56 YEARS. CHRIST MEDICAL CENTER HAS FOUR ZIP CODES IN ITS PRIMARY SERVICE AREA WITH A RANKING OF FIVE FOR THE SOCIONEEDS INDEX-ALL WITHIN CHICAGO-WHICH REPRESENT THE AREAS WITH THE HIGHEST SOCIOECONOMIC NEEDS: WEST ENGLEWOOD (99.2), BRIGHTON PARK (96.3), CHICAGO LAWN (97.6), AND AUBURN GRESHAM (95.3). THE INDEX VALUES EACH OF THESE ZIP CODES ARE OVER 90/100, THUS REPRESENTING SOME OF THE HIGHEST AREAS OF NEED IN THE COUNTRY. ADVOCATE CHILDRENS HOSPITAL, WHICH IS INTEGRATED AS PART OF ADVOCATE CHRIST HOSPITAL IN OAK LAWN AND ADVOCATE LUTHERAN GENERAL HOSPITAL IN PARK RIDGE HAS A TOTAL SERVICE AREA (TSA) WHICH INCLUDES COMMUNITIES SERVED BY CHRIST MEDICAL CENTER, AS WELL AS GEOGRAPHIC AREAS OR COMMUNITIES SERVED BY ADVOCATE TRINITY HOSPITAL ON CHICAGOS SOUTH AND SOUTHEAST SIDES, ADVOCATE SOUTH SUBURBAN HOSPITAL IN CHICAGOS SOUTH SUBURBS AND ADVOCATE GOOD SAMARITAN HOSPITAL IN THE WEST AND SOUTHWEST SUBURBAN CHICAGO AREA. THE TOTAL PEDIATRIC POPULATION, AGES 0-17 YEARS, WITHIN THE CHILDRENS HOSPITAL OAK LAWN TSA IS 591,263 CHILDREN IN 77 COMMUNITIES OR 25% OF THE TOTAL POPULATION WITHIN THE SAME AREA. THE HOSPITALS DIVERSE SERVICE AREA IS 37% BLACK/NON-HISPANIC, 35% WHITE/NON-HISPANIC AND 24% HISPANIC. WITHIN THE TSA, 56.3% OF PATIENTS (CHILDREN AGES 0-17) RECEIVE MEDICAID, 38.9% ARE COVERED BY MANAGED CARE HEALTH INSURANCE AND 4.5% HAVE OTHER PAYMENT PLANS. HOUSEHOLD INCOME STATISTICS SHOW THAT 26% OF HOUSEHOLDS IN THE TSA EARN LESS THAN $25,000/YEAR AND 46% HAVE A HIGH SCHOOL EDUCATION OR LESS. THERE ARE 20 HOSPITALS PROVIDING PEDIATRIC MEDICAL SERVICES IN ADVOCATE CHILDRENS HOSPITALS SERVICE AREA.

JOSEPH MEDICAL CENTER, ROSELAND COMMUNITY HOSPITAL, SILVER CROSS HOSPITAL, SOUTH SHORE HOSPITAL, ST. ANTHONY HOSPITAL, ST. BERNARD HOSPITAL, AND UNIVERSITY OF CHICAGO MEDICAL CENTER. HIGH RISK AREAS AND COMMUNITIES OF HIGH NEED WERE FURTHER DETERMINED BY USE OF THE SOCIAL VULNERABILITY INDEX, WHICH IS AN AGGREGATE MEASURE OF THE CAPACITY OF COMMUNITIES TO PREPARE FOR AND RESPOND TO EXTERNAL STRESSORS ON HUMAN HEALTH, SUCH AS NATURAL OR HUMAN-CAUSED DISASTERS, OR DISEASE OUTBREAKS. THE SOCIAL VULNERABILITY INDEX RANKS EACH CENSUS TRACT ON 14 SOCIAL FACTORS, INCLUDING POVERTY, LACK OF VEHICLE ACCESS AND CROWDED HOUSING. COMMUNITIES WITH HIGH SOCIAL VULNERABILITY INDEX SCORES HAVE LESS CAPACITY TO DEAL WITH OR PREPARE FOR EXTERNAL STRESSORS AND, AS A RESULT, ARE MORE VULNERABLE TO THREATS ON HUMAN HEALTH. MANY COMMUNITIES IN ADVOCATE CHILDRENS HOSPITALS TSA RANK HIGH IN SOCIAL VULNERABILITY WHICH CAN HAVE A NEGATIVE IMPACT ON CHILDRENS HEALTH. SUCH COMMUNITIES INCLUDE BLUE ISLAND, CALUMET PARK, DIXMOOR, FORD HEIGHTS AND HARVEY IN THE SOUTH SUBURBS, ALONG WITH THE CHICAGO LAWN, ENGLEWOOD AND GAGE PARK NEIGHBORHOODS IN CHICAGO. ANOTHER MEASURE IN DETERMINING NEED WAS THE CHILDHOOD OPPORTUNITY INDEX WHICH IS BASED ON SEVERAL INDICATORS IN EACH OF THE FOLLOWING CATEGORIES: DEMOGRAPHICS AND DIVERSITY; EARLY CHILDHOOD EDUCATION; RESIDENTIAL AND SCHOOL SEGREGATION; MATERNAL AND CHILD HEALTH; NEIGHBORHOOD CHARACTERISTICS OF CHILDREN; AND CHILD POVERTY. CHILDREN WHO LIVE IN AREAS OF LOW OPPORTUNITY HAVE AN INCREASED RISK FOR A VARIETY OF NEGATIVE HEALTH INDICATORS, SUCH AS PREMATURE MORTALITY, ARE MORE LIKELY TO BE EXPOSED TO SERIOUS PSYCHOLOGICAL DISTRESS AND ARE MORE LIKELY TO HAVE POOR SCHOOL PERFORMANCE. COMMUNITIES IN THE ADVOCATE CHILDRENS HOSPITAL TSA INCLUDE FORD HEIGHTS, DIXMOOR, DOLTON AND HARVEY IN THE SOUTH SUBURBS, AS WELL AS THE ARCHER HEIGHTS, AUBURN-GRESHAM, BRIGHTON PARK AND CHICAGO LAWN NEIGHBORHOODS IN CHICAGO.

THE CHIW IS MADE UP OF REPRESENTATIVES FROM EACH HOSPITAL AS WELL AS PUBLIC HEALTH EXPERTS FROM THE MCDPH AND COMMUNITY MEMBER EXPERTS FROM FLHSA. IN ADDITION TO THE CHIW, SEVERAL OTHER ORGANIZATIONS COLLABORATED IN THE DEVELOPMENT OF THE CHNA. THESE ORGANIZATIONS AND PROGRAMS INCLUDE: THE CENTER FOR COMMUNITY HEALTH; THE GREATER ROCHESTER CHAMBER OF COMMERCE; THE SMOKING AND HEALTH ACTION COALITION; CENTER FOR TOBACCO FREE FINGER LAKES; NATIONAL CENTER FOR DEAF HEALTH RESEARCH; ROCHESTER-MONROE ANTI-POVERTY INITIATIVE; DELIVERY SYSTEM REFORM INCENTIVE PAYMENT (DSRIP) PROGRAM; AND TRANSFORMING PRIMARY CARE DELIVERY: MONROE COUNTY CMMI GRANT. THE MONROE COUNTY CHNA BEGAN WITH A REVIEW OF THE 2013 CHNA AND THE STATE-REQUIRED PROGRESS REPORT OF 2015 OF THE COMMUNITY HEALTH IMPROVEMENT PLAN BASED ON THE 2013 CHNA. THE PRIMARY CONSISTENT SOURCE OF DATA USED TO PRIORITIZE THE HEALTH NEEDS OF OUR COMMUNITY WAS THE COUNTY LEVEL DASHBOARDS OF THE NEW YORK STATE PREVENTION AGENDA. IN ADDITION, OTHER KEY SOURCES OF DATA INCLUDED:- MORTALITY AND NATALITY DATA: NEW YORK STATE BIRTH AND DEATH FILES- MORTALITY DATA FROM THE OFFICE OF THE MEDICAL EXAMINER, MONROE COUNTY- STATEWIDE PLANNING AND RESEARCH COOPERATIVE SYSTEMS (SPARCS) FILES, BASED ON HOSPITAL DISCHARGES AND EMERGENCY ROOM VISITS- MONROE COUNTY YOUTH RISK BEHAVIOR SURVEY (YRBS)- MONROE COUNTY YOUTH RISK BEHAVIOR SURVEY DATA- LOCAL MONROE COUNTY BLOOD PRESSURE REGISTRY DATA OF PATIENTS DIAGNOSED WITH HYPERTENSION AND SOME IDENTITY PROTECTED ELECTRONIC MEDICAL RECORD INFORMATION- COUNTY HEALTH RANKINGS AND ROADMAPS- NYS PREVENTION AGENDA DASHBOARD 2013-2018- ACT ROCHESTER FOR DATA RELATED TO THE SOCIAL DETERMINANTS OF HEALTH- MONROE COUNTY ADULT HEALTH SURVEY THE CHIW REVIEWED DATA FROM EACH OF THESE SOURCES TO IDENTIFY INDICATORS WHERE MONROE COUNTY SCORED WORSE THAN THE NYS AVERAGE AND/OR WHERE THEY DID NOT MEET THE PREVENTION AGENDA TARGETS. FINALLY, NEW DATA SOURCES WERE REVIEWED INCLUDING ACCIDENTAL DEATHS RELATED TO HEROIN/FENTANYL, AND ADVERSE CHILDHOOD EXPERIENCES FROM THE 2014-2015 MONROE COUNTY YOUTH RISK BEHAVIOR SURVEY. THE CHIW IDENTIFIED 44 COUNTY LEVEL COMMUNITY HEALTH INDICATORS SPANNING FIVE FOCUS AREAS WHERE MONROE COUNTY DID NOT MEET THE PREVENTION AGENDA TARGETS AND AN ADDITIONAL 13 HIGH NEED HEALTH TOPIC AREAS FROM THE FROM THE MONROE COUNTY YOUTH RISK BEHAVIOR SURVEY. ALL MEMBERS OF THE CHIW ARE CRITICALLY AWARE OF THE DISPARITIES THAT EXIST IN OUR COMMUNITY FOR VIRTUALLY EVERY HEALTH OUTCOME BASED ON RACE, ETHNICITY AND SOCIOECONOMIC STATUS INCLUDING POVERTY, INCOME AND EDUCATION. SEVERAL HEALTH DISPARITIES WERE IDENTIFIED WITHIN THE DATA REVIEWED. AS A RESULT, THE CHIW EXPLORED DISPARITY EXTENSIVELY WITH THE ASSISTANCE OF REPORTS PUBLISHED BY FLHSA THAT HIGHLIGHT SIGNIFICANT HEALTH DISPARITIES IN SOCIOECONOMICALLY DISADVANTAGED AREAS OF THE CITY OF ROCHESTER. THE CHIW CONSIDERED THIS INFORMATION IN ITS ASSESSMENT AND DETERMINATION OF PRIORITY AREAS WITHIN THE CHNA. THE PROCESS FOR PRIORITIZING COMMUNITY HEALTH NEEDS AND SERVICES WAS DETERMINED THROUGH LISTENING TO THE OPINIONS OF MEMBERS OF CHIW AS WELL AS LEADERS FROM DSRIP AND SEVERAL COMMUNITY HEALTH EXPERTS. A PRIORITIZATION TOOL WAS DEVELOPED TO ALLOW MEMBERS TO RANK IDENTIFIED HEALTH ISSUES BASED ON:- IMPORTANCE - NUMBER OF PEOPLE AFFECTED, HOW MUCH DISABILITY AND ILLNESS IS CAUSED BY THE ISSUE AND THE LONG TERM IMPACT ON HEALTH- LIKELIHOOD OF IMPACTFUL SUCCESS - WILL THIS RESULT IN SUBSTANTIAL HEALTH IMPROVEMENT IN 3 - 5 YEARS- COMMUNITY SUPPORT - HOW MUCH SUPPORT IS THERE AMONGST COMMUNITY LEADERS, PARTNER ORGANIZATIONS AND RESIDENTS- HOSPITAL SUPPORT - HOW MUCH SUPPORT IS THERE AMONGST HOSPITAL LEADERS- FILL A GAP - WILL THIS FILL A GAP IN SERVICES/INITIATIVES CURRENTLY PROVIDED IN MONROE COUNTY - LARGE HEALTH DISPARITY - DOES THIS INITIATIVE ADDRESS AN IMPORTANT DISPARITY? COMMUNITY INPUT WAS STRONGLY CONSIDERED THROUGHOUT THIS PROCESS. THE CHIW REVIEWED RESULTS FROM VARIOUS PROJECTS THAT RECENTLY GATHERED COMMUNITY INPUT RELATED TO HEALTH ISSUES AFFECTING RESIDENTS. CHIW ALSO CONSIDERED SERVICES ALREADY BEING PROVIDED IN THE COMMUNITY, AND HOW WE COULD BEST DEVELOP SYNERGY WITH EXISTING PROCESSES. ONE FINAL STEP WAS CONDUCTED TO ASSURE ADEQUATE COMMUNITY INPUT. A SURVEY WAS CONDUCTED (VIA SURVEY MONKEY) OF HOSPITAL LEADERSHIP AND ANYONE ELSE THE CHIW FELT NEEDED TO BE HEARD. THE SURVEY PROVIDED PROVIDED A DETAILED LIST OF 12 HEALTH AREAS OF NEED FOR MONROE COUNTY AND INCLUDED A LIST OF EVIDENCE BASED INTERVENTIONS FOR EACH. THE SURVEY UTILIZED THE SAME QUESTIONS AS THE PRIORITIZATION TOOL USED BY THE CHIW. THE RESULTS WERE TABULATED AND REVIEWED AS PART OF THE OVERALL ASSESSMENT PROCESS. OVERALL, AFTER CONSIDERING THE OPINIONS OF THE CHIW MEMBERS, THE COMMUNITY, THE STATE OF NEW YORK AND THE HEALTH DATA, THE FOLLOWING PRIORITIES WERE IDENTIFIED: PREVENT CHRONIC DISEASE:1. TOBACCO USE2. HEART HEALTH PROMOTE HEALTHY WOMEN, INFANTS AND CHILDREN3. UNPLANNED PREGNANCY4. FOOD INSECURITY AMONG FAMILIES PROMOTE MENTAL HEALTH AND PREVENT SUBSTANCE ABUSE5. OPIOID MISUSE AND DEATH THE 2016-2018 COMMUNITY HEALTH IMPROVEMENT PLAN OUTLINES THE PRIORITIES IDENTIFIED IN THE CHNA AND PROVIDES INTERVENTIONS TO IMPACT THE HEALTH PRIORITIES AS FOLLOWS: PRIORITY 1: PREVENT CHRONIC DISEASE: SMOKING CESSATION - EACH HOSPITAL WILL ENACT A TOBACCO CESSATION POLICY THAT INCORPORATES THE ""OPT-TO-QUIT"" PROGRAM AND WILL IMPLEMENT THAT POLICY THEREBY ELECTRONICALLY LINKING TOBACCO USING PATIENTS TO THE NYS QUIT LINE.

201733179349307748,210662542,"SCHEDULE H, PART III, LINE 2, 3 & 4","BAD DEBT EXPENSE WAS CALCULATED USING THE PROVIDERS' BAD DEBT EXPENSE FROM FINANCIAL STATEMENT, NET OF ACCOUNTS WRITTEN OFF AT CHARGES. THE AMOUNT REFLECTED ON SCHEDULE H, PART III, LINE 2 WAS ARRIVED AT BY APPLYING THE ORGANIZATION'S COST TO CHARGE RATIO TO ITS TOTAL BAD DEBT EXPENSE. THE ORGANIZATION'S ALLOWANCE FOR DOUBTFUL ACCOUNTS (BAD DEBT EXPENSE) METHODOLOGY AND CHARITY CARE POLICIES ARE CONSISTENTLY APPLIED. THE ORGANIZATION ISSUES AUDITED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS. THE ATTACHED TEXT WAS OBTAINED FROM THE FOOTNOTES TO THE AUDITED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS OF THE ORGANIZATION. ALLOWANCE FOR DOUBTFUL ACCOUNTS ------------------------------- THE MEDICAL CENTER PROVIDES AN ALLOWANCE FOR ESTIMATED LOSSES RESULTING FROM UNCOLLECTIBLE ACCOUNTS. THE ALLOWANCE IS DETERMINED BY ANALYZING HISTORICAL DATA AND TRENDS. ACCOUNTS RECEIVABLE ARE CHARGED OFF AGAINST THE RESERVE FOR DOUBTFUL ACCOUNTS WHEN MANAGEMENT DETERMINES THAT RECOVERY IS UNLIKELY AND THE MEDICAL CENTER CEASES COLLECTION EFFORTS AND RELEASES THE ACCOUNTS TO COLLECTION AGENCIES. IN EVALUATING THE COLLECTABILITY OF ACCOUNTS RECEIVABLE, THE MEDICAL CENTER ANALYZES ITS PAST HISTORY AND IDENTIFIES TRENDS FOR EACH OF ITS MAJOR PAYOR SOURCES OF REVENUE TO ESTIMATE THE APPROPRIATE ALLOWANCE FOR DOUBTFUL ACCOUNTS AND PROVISION FOR BAD DEBTS. MANAGEMENT REVIEWS DATA ABOUT THESE MAJOR PAYOR SOURCES OF REVENUE IN EVALUATING THE SUFFICIENCY OF THE ALLOWANCE FOR DOUBTFUL ACCOUNTS. FOR RECEIVABLES ASSOCIATED WITH SERVICES PROVIDED TO PATIENTS WHO HAVE THIRD-PARTY COVERAGE, THE MEDICAL CENTER ANALYZES CONTRACTUALLY DUE AMOUNTS AND PROVIDES AN ALLOWANCE FOR DOUBTFUL ACCOUNTS AND A PROVISION FOR BAD DEBTS, IF NECESSARY (FOR EXAMPLE, FOR EXPECTED UNCOLLECTIBLE DEDUCTIBLES AND COPAYMENTS ON ACCOUNTS FOR WHICH THE THIRD-PARTY PAYOR HAS NOT YET PAID). FOR RECEIVABLES ASSOCIATED WITH SELF-PAY PATIENTS, THE MEDICAL CENTER RECORDS A SIGNIFICANT PROVISION FOR BAD DEBTS ON THE BASIS OF ITS PAST EXPERIENCE, WHICH INDICATES THAT MANY PATIENTS ARE UNABLE OR UNWILLING TO PAY THE PORTION OF THEIR BILL FOR WHICH THEY ARE FINANCIALLY RESPONSIBLE. THE DIFFERENCE BETWEEN THE BILLED RATES AND THE AMOUNTS ACTUALLY COLLECTED AFTER ALL REASONABLE INTERNAL COLLECTION EFFORTS HAVE BEEN EXHAUSTED IS CHARGED OFF AGAINST THE ALLOWANCE FOR DOUBTFUL ACCOUNTS. UNCOMPENSATED CARE ------------------ THE MEDICAL CENTER PROVIDES CHARITY CARE TO PATIENTS WHO MEET CERTAIN FINANCIAL CRITERIA ESTABLISHED BY THE STATE OF NEW JERSEY. THE DIRECT AND INDIRECT COST OF SERVICES AND SUPPLIES FURNISHED TO PATIENTS ELIGIBLE FOR SUCH CHARITY CARE, USING A RATIO OF COST TO GROSS CHARGES, APPROXIMATED $1,561,000 AND $1,364,000 FOR THE YEARS ENDED DECEMBER 31, 2016 AND 2015, RESPECTIVELY. GROSS CHARGES FORGONE RELATED TO CHARITY CARE SERVICES AMOUNTED TO APPROXIMATELY $8,917,000 AND $7,724,000 FOR THE YEARS ENDED DECEMBER 31, 2016 AND 2015, RESPECTIVELY. THE MEDICAL CENTERS PATIENT ACCEPTANCE POLICY IS BASED ON ITS MISSION STATEMENT AND ITS CHARITABLE PURPOSES. ACCORDINGLY, THE MEDICAL CENTER ACCEPTS ALL PATIENTS REGARDLESS OF THEIR ABILITY TO PAY. THIS POLICY RESULTS IN THE ASSUMPTION OF HIGHER-THAN-NORMAL PATIENT ACCOUNTS RECEIVABLE CREDIT RISKS. TO THE EXTENT THE MEDICAL CENTER REALIZES ADDITIONAL LOSSES RESULTING FROM SUCH HIGHER CREDIT RISK FOR PATIENTS THAT ARE NOT IDENTIFIED OR DO NOT MEET THE PREVIOUSLY DESCRIBED CHARITY DEFINITION, SUCH ADDITIONAL LOSSES ARE INCLUDED IN THE PROVISION FOR BAD DEBTS. ADDITIONALLY, THE MEDICAL CENTER SPONSORS CERTAIN OTHER CHARITABLE PROGRAMS, WHICH PROVIDE SUBSTANTIAL BENEFIT TO THE BROADER COMMUNITY. SUCH PROGRAMS INCLUDE SERVICES TO NEEDY AND ELDERLY POPULATIONS THAT REQUIRE SPECIAL SUPPORT, AS WELL AS HEALTH PROMOTION AND EDUCATION FOR THE GENERAL COMMUNITY WELFARE. THE HEALTH CARE REFORM ACT OF 1992, CHAPTER 160, ESTABLISHED THE HEALTH CARE SUBSIDY FUND TO PROVIDE A MECHANISM AND FUNDING SOURCE TO COMPENSATE HOSPITALS FOR CHARITY CARE. THE MEDICAL CENTER RECEIVED APPROXIMATELY $518,000 AND $1,300,000 FOR CHARITY CARE, WHICH IS INCLUDED IN NET PATIENT SERVICE REVENUE FOR THE YEARS ENDED DECEMBER 31, 2016 AND 2015, RESPECTIVELY. THE HEALTH CARE SUBSIDY FUND AMOUNTS ARE SUBJECT TO CHANGE FROM YEAR TO YEAR BASED ON AVAILABLE STATE BUDGET AMOUNTS AND ALLOCATION METHODOLOGIES."
201733179349307748,210662542,"SCHEDULE H, PART III, LINE 8","MEDICARE COSTS WERE DERIVED FROM THE 2016 MEDICARE COST REPORT. MEDICARE UNDERPAYMENTS AND BAD DEBT ARE COMMUNITY BENEFIT AND ASSOCIATED COSTS ARE INCLUDABLE ON THE FORM 990, SCHEDULE H, PART I. THE ORGANIZATION BELIEVES THAT MEDICARE UNDERPAYMENTS (SHORTFALL) AND BAD DEBT ARE COMMUNITY BENEFIT AND ASSOCIATED COSTS ARE INCLUDABLE ON THE FORM 990, SCHEDULE H, PART I. AS OUTLINED MORE FULLY BELOW, THE ORGANIZATION BELIEVES THAT THESE SERVICES AND RELATED COSTS PROMOTE THE HEALTH OF THE COMMUNITY AS A WHOLE AND ARE RENDERED IN CONJUNCTION WITH THE ORGANIZATION'S CHARITABLE TAX-EXEMPT PURPOSES AND MISSION IN PROVIDING MEDICALLY NECESSARY HEALTHCARE SERVICES TO ALL INDIVIDUALS IN A NON-DISCRIMINATORY MANNER WITHOUT REGARD TO RACE, COLOR, CREED, SEX, NATIONAL ORIGIN, RELIGION OR ABILITY TO PAY AND CONSISTENT WITH THE COMMUNITY BENEFIT STANDARD PROMULGATED BY THE INTERNAL REVENUE SERVICE (""IRS""). THE COMMUNITY BENEFIT STANDARD IS THE CURRENT STANDARD FOR A HOSPITAL FOR RECOGNITION AS A TAX-EXEMPT AND CHARITABLE ORGANIZATION UNDER INTERNAL REVENUE CODE (""IRC"") 501(C)(3). THE ORGANIZATION IS RECOGNIZED AS A TAX-EXEMPT ENTITY AND CHARITABLE ORGANIZATION UNDER 501(C)(3) OF THE IRC. ALTHOUGH THERE IS NO DEFINITION IN THE TAX CODE FOR THE TERM ""CHARITABLE"" A REGULATION PROMULGATED BY THE DEPARTMENT OF THE TREASURY PROVIDES SOME GUIDANCE AND STATES THAT ""THE TERM CHARITABLE IS USED IN 501(C)(3) IN ITS GENERALLY ACCEPTED LEGAL SENSE,PROVIDES EXAMPLES OF CHARITABLE PURPOSES, INCLUDING THE RELIEF OF THE POOR OR UNPRIVILEGED; THE PROMOTION OF SOCIAL WELFARE; AND THE ADVANCEMENT OF EDUCATION, RELIGION, AND SCIENCE. NOTE IT DOES NOT EXPLICITLY ADDRESS THE ACTIVITIES OF HOSPITALS. IN THE ABSENCE OF EXPLICIT STATUTORY OR REGULATORY REQUIREMENTS APPLYING THE TERM ""CHARITABLE"" TO HOSPITALS, IT HAS BEEN LEFT TO THE IRS TO DETERMINE THE CRITERIA HOSPITALS MUST MEET TO QUALIFY AS IRC 501(C)(3) CHARITABLE ORGANIZATIONS. THE ORIGINAL STANDARD WAS KNOWN AS THE CHARITY CARE STANDARD. THIS STANDARD WAS REPLACED BY THE IRS WITH THE COMMUNITY BENEFIT STANDARD WHICH IS THE CURRENT STANDARD. CHARITY CARE STANDARD IN 1956, THE IRS ISSUED REVENUE RULING 56-185, WHICH ADDRESSED THE REQUIREMENTS HOSPITALS NEEDED TO MEET IN ORDER TO QUALIFY FOR IRC 501(C)(3) STATUS. ONE OF THESE REQUIREMENTS IS KNOWN AS THE ""CHARITY CARE STANDARD."" UNDER THE STANDARD, A HOSPITAL HAD TO PROVIDE, TO THE EXTENT OF ITS FINANCIAL ABILITY, FREE OR REDUCED-COST CARE TO PATIENTS UNABLE TO PAY FOR IT. A HOSPITAL THAT EXPECTED FULL PAYMENT DID NOT, ACCORDING TO THE RULING, PROVIDE CHARITY CARE BASED ON THE FACT THAT SOME PATIENTS ULTIMATELY FAILED TO PAY. THE RULING EMPHASIZED THAT A LOW LEVEL OF CHARITY CARE DID NOT NECESSARILY MEAN THAT A HOSPITAL HAD FAILED TO MEET THE REQUIREMENT SINCE THAT LEVEL COULD REFLECT ITS FINANCIAL ABILITY TO PROVIDE SUCH CARE. THE RULING ALSO NOTED THAT PUBLICLY SUPPORTED COMMUNITY HOSPITALS WOULD NORMALLY QUALIFY AS CHARITABLE ORGANIZATIONS BECAUSE THEY SERVE THE ENTIRE COMMUNITY, AND A LOW LEVEL OF CHARITY CARE WOULD NOT AFFECT A HOSPITAL'S EXEMPT STATUS IF IT WAS DUE TO THE SURROUNDING COMMUNITY'S LACK OF CHARITABLE DEMANDS. COMMUNITY BENEFIT STANDARD IN 1969, THE IRS ISSUED REVENUE RULING 69-545, WHICH ""REMOVED"" FROM REVENUE RULING 56-185 ""THE REQUIREMENTS RELATING TO CARING FOR PATIENTS WITHOUT CHARGE OR AT RATES BELOW COST."" UNDER THE STANDARD DEVELOPED IN REVENUE RULING 69-545, WHICH IS KNOWN AS THE ""COMMUNITY BENEFIT STANDARD,"" HOSPITALS ARE JUDGED ON WHETHER THEY PROMOTE THE HEALTH OF A BROAD CLASS OF INDIVIDUALS IN THE COMMUNITY. THE RULING INVOLVED A HOSPITAL THAT ONLY ADMITTED INDIVIDUALS WHO COULD PAY FOR THE SERVICES (BY THEMSELVES, PRIVATE INSURANCE, OR PUBLIC PROGRAMS SUCH AS MEDICARE), BUT OPERATED A FULL-TIME EMERGENCY ROOM THAT WAS OPEN TO EVERYONE. THE IRS RULED THAT THE HOSPITAL QUALIFIED AS A CHARITABLE ORGANIZATION BECAUSE IT PROMOTED THE HEALTH OF PEOPLE IN ITS COMMUNITY. THE IRS REASONED THAT BECAUSE THE PROMOTION OF HEALTH WAS A CHARITABLE PURPOSE ACCORDING TO THE GENERAL LAW OF CHARITY, IT FELL WITHIN THE ""GENERALLY ACCEPTED LEGAL SENSE"" OF THE TERM ""CHARITABLE,"" AS REQUIRED BY TREAS. REG. 1.501(C)(3)-1(D)(2). THE IRS RULING STATED THAT THE PROMOTION OF HEALTH, LIKE THE RELIEF OF POVERTY AND THE ADVANCEMENT OF EDUCATION AND RELIGION, IS ONE OF THE PURPOSES IN THE GENERAL LAW OF CHARITY THAT IS DEEMED BENEFICIAL TO THE COMMUNITY AS A WHOLE EVEN THOUGH THE CLASS OF BENEFICIARIES ELIGIBLE TO RECEIVE A DIRECT BENEFIT FROM ITS ACTIVITIES DOES NOT INCLUDE ALL MEMBERS OF THE COMMUNITY, SUCH AS INDIGENT MEMBERS OF THE COMMUNITY, PROVIDED THAT THE CLASS IS NOT SO SMALL THAT ITS RELIEF IS NOT OF BENEFIT TO THE COMMUNITY. THE IRS CONCLUDED THAT THE HOSPITAL WAS ""PROMOTING THE HEALTH OF A CLASS OF PERSONS THAT IS BROAD ENOUGH TO BENEFIT THE COMMUNITY"" BECAUSE ITS EMERGENCY DEPARTMENT WAS OPEN TO ALL AND IT PROVIDED CARE TO EVERYONE WHO COULD PAY, WHETHER DIRECTLY OR THROUGH THIRD-PARTY REIMBURSEMENT. OTHER CHARACTERISTICS OF THE HOSPITAL THAT THE IRS HIGHLIGHTED INCLUDED THE FOLLOWING: IT WAS CONTROLLED BY A BOARD OF TRUSTEES THAT CONSISTED OF INDEPENDENT CIVIC LEADERS; HOSPITAL MEDICAL STAFF PRIVILEGES WERE AVAILABLE TO ALL QUALIFIED PHYSICIANS; AND SURPLUS FUNDS ARE USED TO IMPROVE THE QUALITY OF PATIENT CARE, EXPAND AND RENOVATE HOSPITAL FACILITIES AND ADVANCE MEDICAL CARE, TRAINING, EDUCATION, RESEARCH, PROGRAMS AND ACTIVITIES. MEDICARE UNDERPAYMENTS AND BAD DEBT ARE COMMUNITY BENEFIT AND ASSOCIATED COSTS ARE INCLUDABLE ON THE FORM 990, SCHEDULE H, PART I. THE AMERICAN HOSPITAL ASSOCIATION (""AHA"") BELIEVES THAT MEDICARE UNDERPAYMENTS (SHORTFALL) AND BAD DEBT ARE COMMUNITY BENEFIT AND THUS INCLUDABLE ON THE FORM 990, SCHEDULE H, PART I. THIS ORGANIZATION AGREES WITH THE AHA POSITION. AS OUTLINED IN THE AHA LETTER TO THE IRS DATED AUGUST 21, 2007 WITH RESPECT TO THE FIRST PUBLISHED DRAFT OF THE NEW FORM 990 AND SCHEDULE H, THE AHA FELT THAT THE IRS SHOULD INCORPORATE THE FULL VALUE OF THE COMMUNITY BENEFIT THAT HOSPITALS PROVIDE BY COUNTING MEDICARE UNDERPAYMENTS (SHORTFALL) AS QUANTIFIABLE COMMUNITY BENEFIT FOR THE FOLLOWING REASONS: - PROVIDING CARE FOR THE ELDERLY AND SERVING MEDICARE PATIENTS IS AN ESSENTIAL PART OF THE COMMUNITY BENEFIT STANDARD. - MEDICARE, LIKE MEDICAID, DOES NOT PAY THE FULL COST OF CARE. RECENTLY, MEDICARE REIMBURSES HOSPITALS ONLY 88 CENTS FOR EVERY DOLLAR THEY SPEND TO TAKE CARE OF MEDICARE PATIENTS - MANY MEDICARE BENEFICIARIES, LIKE THEIR MEDICAID COUNTERPARTS, ARE POOR. MORE THAN 46 PERCENT OF MEDICARE SPENDING IS FOR BENEFICIARIES WHOSE INCOME IS BELOW 200 PERCENT OF THE FEDERAL POVERTY LEVEL. MANY OF THOSE MEDICARE BENEFICIARIES ARE ALSO ELIGIBLE FOR MEDICAID -- SO CALLED ELIGIBLES."" THERE IS EVERY COMPELLING PUBLIC POLICY REASON TO TREAT MEDICARE AND MEDICAID UNDERPAYMENTS SIMILARLY FOR PURPOSES OF A HOSPITAL'S COMMUNITY BENEFIT AND INCLUDE THESE COSTS ON FORM 990, SCHEDULE H, PART I. MEDICARE UNDERPAYMENT MUST BE SHOULDERED BY THE HOSPITAL IN ORDER TO CONTINUE TREATING THE COMMUNITY'S ELDERLY AND POOR. THESE UNDERPAYMENTS REPRESENT A REAL COST OF SERVING THE COMMUNITY AND SHOULD COUNT AS A QUANTIFIABLE COMMUNITY BENEFIT. BOTH THE AHA AND THIS ORGANIZATION ALSO BELIEVE THAT PATIENT BAD DEBT IS A COMMUNITY BENEFIT AND THUS INCLUDABLE ON THE FORM 990, SCHEDULE H, PART I. LIKE MEDICARE UNDERPAYMENT (SHORTFALLS), THERE ALSO ARE COMPELLING REASONS THAT PATIENT BAD DEBT SHOULD BE COUNTED AS QUANTIFIABLE COMMUNITY BENEFIT AS FOLLOWS: - A SIGNIFICANT MAJORITY OF BAD DEBT IS ATTRIBUTABLE TO LOW-INCOME PATIENTS, WHO, FOR MANY REASONS, DECLINE TO COMPLETE THE FORMS REQUIRED TO ESTABLISH ELIGIBILITY FOR HOSPITALS' CHARITY CARE OR FINANCIAL ASSISTANCE PROGRAMS. A 2006 CONGRESSIONAL BUDGET OFFICE (""CBO"") REPORT, NONPROFIT HOSPITALS AND THE PROVISION OF COMMUNITY BENEFITS, CITED TWO STUDIES INDICATING THAT ""THE GREAT MAJORITY OF BAD DEBT WAS ATTRIBUTABLE TO PATIENTS WITH INCOMES BELOW 200% OF THE FEDERAL POVERTY LINE."" - THE REPORT ALSO NOTED THAT A SUBSTANTIAL PORTION OF BAD DEBT IS PENDING CHARITY CARE. UNLIKE BAD DEBT IN OTHER INDUSTRIES, HOSPITAL BAD DEBT IS COMPLICATED BY THE FACT THAT HOSPITALS FOLLOW THEIR MISSION TO THE COMMUNITY AND TREAT EVERY PATIENT THAT COMES THROUGH THEIR EMERGENCY DEPARTMENT, REGARDLESS OF ABILITY TO PAY. PATIENTS WHO HAVE OUTSTANDING BILLS ARE NOT TURNED AWAY, UNLIKE OTHER INDUSTRIES. BAD DEBT IS FURTHER COMPLICATED BY THE AUDITING INDUSTRY'S STANDARDS ON REPORTING CHARITY CARE. MANY PATIENTS CANNOT OR DO NOT PROVIDE THE NECESSARY, EXTENSIVE DOCUMENTATION REQUIRED TO BE DEEMED CHARITY CARE BY AUDITORS. AS A RESULT, ROUGHLY 40% OF BAD DEBT IS PENDING CHARITY CARE. - THE CBO CONCLUDED THAT ITS FINDINGS ""SUPPORT THE VALIDITY OF THE USE OF UNCOMPENSATED CARE [BAD DEBT AND CHARITY CARE] AS A MEASURE OF COMMUNITY BENEFITS ASSUMING THE FINDINGS ARE GENERALIZABLE NATIONWIDE; THE EXPERIENCE OF HOSPITALS AROUND THE NATION REINFORCES THAT THEY ARE GENERALIZABLE.

ANSHN PROVIDES LANGUAGE SERVICES TO ALL THOSE IN NEED IN ORDER TO PROVIDE BETTER ACCESS TO CARE FOR ALL COMMUNITY MEMBERS. IN ADDITION, OTHER PROGRAMS ARE CARRIED OUT WITH THE EXPRESS PURPOSE OF IMPROVING COMMUNITY HEALTH, ACCESS TO HEALTH SERVICES AND GENERAL HEALTH KNOWLEDGE. THESE SERVICES DO NOT GENERATE PATIENT BILLS, HOWEVER, CERTAIN PROGRAMS OR SERVICES MAY HAVE NOMINAL FEES. THESE SERVICES AND PROGRAMS INCLUDE CANCER SUPPORT GROUPS. THESE GROUPS FOCUS ON EDUCATING THE NEWLY DIAGNOSED AND PROVIDING INFORMATION ON BETTER LIVING FOR SURVIVORS. VARIOUS WOMEN AND BABY, BREASTFEEDING, MULTIPLES, CHILDBIRTH AND PARENTING AND SIBLING CLASSES; VARIOUS EDUCATIONAL PROGRAMS AND SUPPORT GROUPS TO RAISE AWARENESS OF HEART DISEASE, DIABETES AND STROKE RISK FACTORS AND TREATMENT OPTIONS AND EDUCATION FOR LIVING WITH THE DISEASE; THERE ARE VARIOUS PROGRAMS REGARDING HEALTH EATING; CPR TRAINING IS OFFERED TO THE COMMUNITY AS WELL AS VARIOUS OTHER WELLNESS AND SCREENING PROGRAMS AND HEALTH FAIRS ARE OFFERED THROUGHOUT THE YEAR. ADULT DAY CARE IS PROVIDED TO THE COMMUNITY AS WELL. PART VI, LINE 1 DESCRIPTION FOR PART I, LINE 7G ANSHN PROVIDES SUBSIDIZED HEALTH SERVICES TO THE COMMUNITY. THESE SERVICES ARE PROVIDED DESPITE CREATING A FINANCIAL LOSS FOR ANSHN. THESE SERVICES ARE PROVIDED BECAUSE THEY MEET AN IDENTIFIED COMMUNITY NEED. IF ANSHN DID NOT PROVIDE THE CLINICAL SERVICE, IT IS REASONABLE TO CONCLUDE THAT THESE SERVICES WOULD NOT BE AVAILABLE TO THE COMMUNITY. THE SERVICES INCLUDED ARE BOTH INPATIENT AND OUTPATIENT PROGRAMS FOR MENTAL AND BEHAVIORAL HEALTH AND HOSPICE SERVICES. PART VI, LINE 1 DESCRIPTION FOR PART I, LINE 7H ANSHN CONDUCTS NUMEROUS RESEARCH ACTIVITIES FOR THE ADVANCEMENT OF MEDICAL AND HEALTH CARE SERVICES. HOWEVER, THE UNREIMBURSED COST OF SUCH RESEARCH ACTIVITIES IS NOT READILY DETERMINABLE AND NO AMOUNT IS BEING REPORTED FOR PURPOSES OF THE 2016 FORM 990, SCHEDULE H. PART VI, LINE 1 DESCRIPTION FOR PART I, LINE 7, COLUMN (F) $24,608,883 OF BAD DEBT EXPENSE WAS INCLUDED ON FORM 990, PART IX, LINE 25, COLUMN (A), BUT WAS REMOVED FROM THE DENOMINATOR FOR PURPOSES OF SCHEDULE H, PART I, LINE 7, COLUMN (F). PART VI, LINE 1 - DESCRIPTION FOR PART II N/A PART VI, LINE 1 - DESCRIPTION FOR PART III, LINES 2, 3, AND 4 THE FOOTNOTES TO ANSHN AND SUBSIDIARIES' AUDITED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS DO NOT SPECIFICALLY ADDRESS BAD DEBT EXPENSE; RATHER, THE FOOTNOTE DESCRIBES ADVOCATE'S PATIENT ACCOUNTS RECEIVABLE POLICY AND THE PERCENTAGE OF ACCOUNTS RECEIVABLE THAT THE ALLOWANCE FOR DOUBTFUL ACCOUNTS COVERS (SEE PAGE 11 OF THE AUDITED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS). FOR 2016, FOR ANSHN, THE ALLOWANCE FOR DOUBTFUL ACCOUNTS COVERED 27.29% OF NET PATIENT ACCOUNTS RECEIVABLE. PATIENT ACCOUNTS RECEIVABLE ARE STATED AT NET REALIZABLE VALUE. ANSHN EVALUATES THE COLLECTABILITY OF ITS ACCOUNTS RECEIVABLE BASED ON THE LENGTH OF TIME THE RECEIVABLE IS OUTSTANDING, PAYER CLASS, HISTORICAL COLLECTION EXPERIENCE, AND TRENDS IN HEALTH CARE INSURANCE PROGRAMS. ACCOUNTS RECEIVABLE ARE CHARGED TO THE ALLOWANCE FOR UNCOLLECTIBLE ACCOUNTS WHEN THEY ARE DEEMED UNCOLLECTIBLE. THE COSTING METHODOLOGY USED IN DETERMINING THE AMOUNTS REPORTED ON LINES 2 AND 3 IS BASED ON THE RATIO OF PATIENT CARE COST TO CHARGES. THE UNREIMBURSED COST OF BAD DEBT WAS CALCULATED BY APPLYING THE ORGANIZATION'S COST TO CHARGE RATIO FROM THE MEDICARE COST REPORTS (CMS 2252-96 WORKSHEET C, PART 1, PPS INPATIENT RATIOS) TO THE ORGANIZATION'S BAD DEBT PROVISION PER GENERALLY ACCEPTED ACCOUNTING PRINCIPLES, LESS ANY PATIENT OR THIRD PARTY PAYOR PAYMENTS RECEIVED. ADVOCATE MAKES EVERY EFFORT TO IDENTIFY THOSE PATIENTS WHO ARE ELIGIBLE FOR FINANCIAL ASSISTANCE BY STRICTLY ADHERING TO ITS FINANCIAL ASSISTANCE POLICY. WE BELIEVE THAT ADVOCATE HAS A POPULATION OF PATIENTS WHO ARE UNINSURED OR UNDERINSURED BUT WHO DO NOT COMPLETE THE FINANCIAL ASSISTANCE APPLICATION. THE ESTIMATED AMOUNT OF BAD DEBT EXPENSE (AT COST) WHICH COULD BE REASONABLY ATTRIBUTABLE TO PATIENTS WHO WOULD LIKELY QUALIFY FOR FINANCIAL ASSISTANCE UNDER THE ORGANIZATION'S FINANCIAL ASSISTANCE POLICY, IF SUFFICIENT INFORMATION HAD BEEN AVAILABLE TO MAKE A DETERMINATION OF THEIR ELIGIBILITY, WAS BASED UPON SELF PAY PATIENT ACCOUNTS WHICH HAD AMOUNTS WRITTEN OFF TO BAD DEBTS. OUR METHOD WAS TO BEGIN WITH THE SELF-PAY PORTION OF BAD DEBT EXPENSE PROVISION. THE SELF PAY PORTION EXCLUDES THOSE PATIENTS WHO HAD CHARITY APPLICATIONS PENDING AT THE TIME OF SERVICE. THIS COST WAS THEN REDUCED BY CHARGES IDENTIFIED AS TRUE BAD DEBT EXPENSE, INCLUDING COPAYS FOR PATIENTS WHO QUALIFIED FOR LESS THAN 100% FINANCIAL ASSISTANCE. THE COST TO CHARGE RATIO WAS THEN APPLIED TO THE REMAINING CHARGES, TO DETERMINE THE VALUE (AT COST) OF PATIENT ACCOUNTS THAT DID NOT COMPLETE FINANCIAL COUNSELING AND WERE ASSIGNED TO BAD DEBT. WE BELIEVE THIS PROCESS IS A REASONABLE BASIS FOR OUR ESTIMATE. AS WE ARE ONLY CONSIDERING SELF-PAY ACCOUNTS WRITTEN OFF TO BAD DEBT FOR THIS ESTIMATE, THIS ESTIMATE DOES NOT INCLUDE THE IMMEDIATE 25% DISCOUNT TO CHARGES WHICH IS APPLIED TO ALL SELF-PAY PATIENTS. IT ALSO DOES NOT INCLUDE ACCOUNT BALANCES OR CO-PAYS OF NON-SELF PAY ACCOUNTS WHICH ARE WRITTEN OFF TO BAD DEBT WHEN THE PATIENT HAS NO OTHER FINANCIAL RESOURCES TO PAY THESE AMOUNTS AND THE PATIENT DOES NOT APPLY FOR FINANCIAL ASSISTANCE. BAD DEBT AMOUNTS HAVE BEEN EXCLUDED FROM OTHER COMMUNITY BENEFIT AMOUNTS REPORTED THROUGHOUT SCHEDULE H. PART VI, LINE 1 - DESCRIPTION FOR PART III, LINE 8 IN 2016, NO SHORTFALL WAS REPORTED ON PART III, LINE 7. FOR ADVOCATE NORTHSIDES OPERATIONS, THE UNREIMBURSED COST OF MEDICARE WAS CALCULATED BY APPLYING THE ORGANIZATIONS COST TO CHARGE RATIO FROM THE MEDICARE COST REPORTS (CMS 2252-96 WORKSHEET C, PART 1, PPS INPATIENT RATIOS) AND FOR NON-HOSPITAL OPERATIONS THE COST TO CHARGE RATIO CALCULATED ON WORKSHEET 2 RATIO OF PATIENT CARE COST TO CHARGES TO THE ORGANIZATIONS MEDICARE, LESS ANY PATIENT OR THIRD PARTY PAYOR PAYMENTS AND/OR CONTRIBUTIONS RECEIVED THAT WERE DESIGNATED FOR THE PAYMENT OF MEDICARE PATIENT BILLS. PART VI, LINE 1 - DESCRIPTION FOR PART III, LINE 9B ANSHN MAINTAINS BOTH WRITTEN FINANCIAL ASSISTANCE AND BAD DEBT/COLLECTION POLICIES. THE BAD DEBT/COLLECTION POLICY DOES NOT APPLY TO THOSE PATIENTS KNOWN TO QUALIFY FOR FINANCIAL ASSISTANCE; THEREFORE SUCH PATIENTS ARE NOT SUBJECT TO COLLECTION PRACTICES."

GOAL B: UNDERTAKE OR SUPPORT INITIATIVES THAT ENHANCE ACCESS TO HEALTH CARE, PREVENTION AND WELLNESS SERVICES ACROSS THE LIFESPAN AND WITHIN THE DIVERSE COMMUNITIES ADVOCATE SERVES. CHARITY CARE. AS A NON-PROFIT HEALTH CARE SYSTEM, ADVOCATE PROVIDES CHARITY AND FINANCIAL ASSISTANCE TO PATIENTS IN NEED. ALTHOUGH ADVOCATES SYSTEM-WIDE CHARITY CARE POLICY IS VERY GENEROUS, ADVOCATE CONTINUES TO REVIEW AND REFINE ITS POLICY IN AN ONGOING EFFORT TO ENSURE THAT FINANCIAL ASSISTANCE IS AVAILABLE TO THOSE IN NEED IN A TIMELY MANNER. WHILE EACH HOSPITAL HAS A CHARITY CARE COUNCIL TO REVIEW APPLICATIONS AND DETERMINE ELIGIBILITY, SYSTEM FINANCE LEADERS ARE RESPONSIBLE FOR ONGOING POLICY REVIEW AND REFINEMENTS TO ASSURE THAT ADVOCATE CONTINUES TO PROVIDE FINANCIAL ASSISTANCE TO INDIVIDUALS WHO NEED HELP, WHEN THEY NEED IT. FEDERALLY QUALIFIED HEALTH CENTERS IN ADDITION, ADVOCATES SYSTEM LEADERS ENCOURAGE AND SUPPORT ITS HOSPITALS INITIATIVES TO PARTNER WITH FEDERALLY QUALIFIED HEALTH CENTERS (FQHC), PUBLIC HEALTH DEPARTMENTS AND COMMUNITY CLINICS IN ORDER TO ASSIST THE UNINSURED IN FINDING INSURANCE COVERAGE AND MEDICAL SERVICES. FOR EXAMPLE, ADVOCATE SOUTH SUBURBAN HOSPITAL HAS A PARTNERSHIP WITH AUNT MARTHAS YOUTH SERVICE CENTER, AN FQHC, TO IMPROVE ACCESS TO PRIMARY CARE SERVICES FOR UNINSURED AND UNDERINSURED INDIVIDUALS IN ITS SERVICE AREA. ADVOCATE BROMENN MEDICAL CENTER MAINTAINS A COMMUNITY HEALTH CLINIC IN COLLABORATION WITH OSF ST. JOSEPHS HOSPITAL, WHEREBY ADVOCATE BROMENN MEDICAL CENTER IS RESPONSIBLE FOR A PORTION OF THE HOSPITAL CARE FOR THE CLINIC PATIENTS HOSPITAL CARE THROUGHOUT THE YEAR. BROMENN IS ALSO THE SOLE PROVIDER OF THE CLINICS INFORMATION TECHNOLOGY (IT) SUPPORT AND PROVIDES THE SPACE OCCUPIED BY THE CLINIC. WORKING WITH OTHER AREA HOSPITALS, ADVOCATE GOOD SAMARITAN HOSPITAL PROVIDES SUPPORT THROUGH THE DUPAGE HEALTH COALITION TO SUSTAIN THE ACCESS DUPAGE COMMUNITY PROGRAM A COMMUNITY COLLABORATION DESIGNED TO PROVIDE LOW-COST PRIMARY MEDICAL CARE SERVICES TO THE LOW-INCOME, MEDICALLY UNINSURED RESIDENTS OF DUPAGE COUNTY. IN ADDITION, THE HOSPITAL PARTNERS WITH THE DUPAGE COUNTY HEALTH DEPARTMENTS ENGAGE DUPAGE INITIATIVE FOR INDIGENT PATIENT FINANCIAL ELIGIBILITY IN THE EMERGENCY ROOM AND TO ASSIST WITH OUTPLACEMENT SERVICES FOR THOSE PATIENTS WHO COULD BENEFIT FROM TREATMENT PROGRAMS, PLACEMENT WITH A PRIMARY CARE PROVIDER (PCP), DENTAL CARE, ETC. ADVOCATE HEALTH CARE ALSO WORKS TO IMPROVE THE PROVISION OF SERVICES TO INDIVIDUALS AND FAMILIES WHO ARE COVERED BY MEDICARE AND MEDICAID AND SEEK SERVICES FROM ADVOCATES OVER 400 SITES OF CARE. ADVOCATE COLLABORATES WITH VARIOUS ORGANIZATIONS IN INNOVATIVE WAYS TO ESTABLISH PRIMARY CARE RELATIONSHIPS FOR MEDICAID AND UNINSURED PATIENTS.

THE ADVOCATE/MERIDIAN FHP PARTNERSHIP AND COLLABORATION WAS DRIVEN LARGELY BY THE RECENT CHANGES TO THE MEDICAID PROGRAM IN ILLINOIS AND WAS DESIGNED TO ENSURE CURRENT MEDICAID MEMBERS CONTINUE TO RECEIVE HIGH-QUALITY AND WELL-COORDINATED CARE DELIVERED IN AN APPROPRIATE SETTING. ADVOCATE HAS A STRONG HISTORY OF PROVIDING HIGH QUALITY CARE FOR THE MEDICAID POPULATION WITHIN OUR NETWORK WITH KEY FOCUS AREAS, INCLUDING IMPROVED CARE COORDINATION, ACCESS AND QUALITY PERFORMANCE. MEDICAID MANAGED CARE IS NEW TO ILLINOIS MEDICAID SINCE 2011, BUT ADVOCATE HAS APPLIED ITS ACHIEVEMENTS AND LESSONS LEARNED FROM ITS MEDICARE AND COMMERCIAL ACOS TO THE ADVOCATE/MERIDIAN FHP PARTNERSHIP. COMMUNITY HEALTH WORKERS (CHWS) IN 2016, ADVOCATE EMBARKED ON A QUALITY IMPROVEMENT PROJECT TO ENGAGE AND EDUCATE MEDICAID BENEFICIARIES SEEN IN THE ADVOCATE CHRIST MEDICAL CENTER EMERGENCY DEPARTMENT ON APPROPRIATE LEVEL OF CARE OPTIONS AVAILABLE TO THEM USING COMMUNITY HEALTH WORKERS. THE MAIN OBJECTIVES OF THE PRIMARY CARE CONNECTIONS INTERVENTION WERE THE FOLLOWING: 1) TO EDUCATE AND SCHEDULE LOW ACUITY PATIENTS WHO VISIT THE CHRIST MEDICAL CENTER EMERGENCY DEPARTMENT REGARDING ALTERNATIVE CARE OPTIONS AVAILABLE TO THEM WITHIN THEIR COMMUNITIES; AND 2) EDUCATE AND SCHEDULE LOW ACUITY MEDICAID PATIENTS FOR FOLLOW-UP APPOINTMENTS WITH THEIR ADVOCATE PRIMARY CARE PHYSICIAN ("

A REPORT IN THE JOURNAL OF AMERICAN MEDICAL ASSOCIATION AND THE CENTER FOR DISEASE CONTROL (MCGINNIS, 1996) SUGGESTS THAT THE FACTORS IMPACTING HEALTH ARE AS FOLLOWS: LIFESTYLE AND BEHAVIORS, 50%, ENVIRONMENT (HUMAN AND NATURAL), 20%, GENETICS AND HUMAN BIOLOGY, 20%, AND HEALTH CARE, 10%. COMMUNITY BUILDING ACTIVITIES HELP TO ADDRESS THE OTHER INDICATORS OUTSIDE OF THE ROLE TRADITIONALLY PLAYED BY HEALTH-CARE ORGANIZATIONS. THESE ACTIVITIES ARE ALMOST EXCLUSIVELY DONE IN SOME FORM OF PARTNERSHIP IN WHICH THE COMMUNITY OR OTHER ORGANIZATIONS ARE BETTER SUITED TO ADDRESS. HEALTH-CARE ORGANIZATIONS GENERALLY PROVIDE TIMELY AND SPECIFIC RESOURCES TO HELP THESE ISSUES. HEALTH-CARE ORGANIZATIONS CAN BE A RICH AND VALUABLE COMMUNITY RESOURCE IN WAYS NOT TYPICALLY CONSIDERED. OFTEN THE MOST EFFECTIVE WAY TO HELP IMPACT AND IMPROVE THE COMMUNITY HEALTH STATUS IS TO SUPPORT OTHER AGENCIES AND ORGANIZATIONS IN A VARIETY OF WAYS OUTSIDE OF HEALTH SERVICES. THIS IS OFTEN DONE THROUGH CASH OR IN-KIND SERVICES TO SUPPORT OTHER NON-PROFITS, DONATIONS OF DURABLE MEDICAL EQUIPMENT AND SUPPLIES TO CERTAIN AGENCIES, OR THROUGH LEADERSHIP AND EDUCATIONAL EXPERTISE.

Part II: All community building activities improve access to health services and address federal, state, or local public health priorities, as well as leverage public health department activities, and in doing so, they provide relief of government burden. These activities broadly serve low-income, underserved patients, and include: collaboration with various community coalitions, system-wide recycling initiative, organizational response to worldly disasters, and bioterrorism efforts. Northwells bioterrorism & disaster preparedness includes Center for Emergency Medical Services, has a designated Bioterrorism Resource Center, and has conducted staff training for more than 100 hospitals and area first responders and invested heavily in the infrastructure needed for large-scale emergencies. During catastrophes (both natural and terrorism), Northwell provides a safe haven for thousands of patients, outside nursing home residents, and community members seeking shelter. Northwell assists with the transport of patients and stand ready to contribute food, medicine, and blankets for both affiliated and non-affiliated hospital patients. Investment in a field hospital has furthered the public health infrastructure needed for mass casualties that could result from a terrorist attack, natural attack, or large-scale emergency. Part III, Line 2: For patients who were determined by Northwell to have the ability to pay but did not, the uncollected amounts are recorded as bad debt expense. The amount of gross charges written off is reduced by any charity care or other discounts provided to the patient, as well as any payments received. Bad debt expense reported on this line is reported net of governmental or private offsetting funds. Part III, Line 3: N/A Part III, Line 4: For patients who were determined by Northwell to have the ability to pay but did not, the uncollected amounts are recorded as bad debt expense. Part III, Line 8: Medicare costs are determined utilizing a combination of the step down method of cost findings and a cost per unit of service. Cost per unit of service is used to calculate the routine cost of services provided to Medicare patients. The Ratio of Cost to Charges method (or RCC) is used to determine the cost of ancillary services. An RCC is developed from these costs, and that RCC is applied to total Medicare gross ancillary services charges to determine the cost of services provided to Medicare patients. Part III, Line 9b: The organizations collection policy is standard to all accounts regardless of insurance status (e.g. insured, underinsured, and uninsured). The hospitals collection policy states that they will not send patient accounts to collection if a decision on a financial assistance application is pending, or if a patient is determined to be eligible for Medicaid at the time services were rendered and for which services Medicaid payment is available. Question 2: NEEDS ASSESSMENT: The Community Health Needs Assessment (CHNA) is performed on an ongoing basis. Northwell conducts and participates in population, demographic, and health status evaluations of our respective hospitals service areas based on county regions and the communities we serve. There is a special effort to include individuals with health disparities and organizations who serve these communities in the CHNA process. The CHNA includes the analysis of primary and secondary data. Multi-year analyses, trends and projections are developed, which identify areas of need for the continuum of health care services. Primary data is obtained through a combination of qualitative analysis of community-based organization (CBO), informant interviews and surveys, individual community member surveys, and participation in collaborative partner meetings. These meetings include representatives from the Departments of Health, CBOs, academic institutions, government agencies, and hospitals. Ongoing input concerning our communities needs is also obtained through: our Board of Trustees/Directors who are all area residents and leaders in their respective communities; facility based advisory boards and councils, and; the feedback received by our facility administrators and clinicians that serve on local community agency boards. Secondary data analysis includes: internal hospital data, including Prevention Quality Indicators (PQI); Department of Health Community Health Assessments; local regional NYS Prevention Agenda data sources; and Statewide Planning and Research System (SPARCS) data. The Committee on Community Health, a committee of the Board of Trustees, provides recommendations that concern Northwells community health priorities and interventions based on the CHNA. Committee discussions focus on New York State (NYS) Prevention Agenda Priority Areas, including strategies and intervention outcomes related to chronic disease prevention, women and childrens health, healthy safe environments, health access, mental health and substance abuse, HIV/AIDS/STDs and community immunizations. Regional departments of health (I.E. Nassau County Department of Health, Suffolk County Department of Health Services, and NYC Department of Health and Mental Hygiene) perform additional community health assessments (CHA) with the input of hospital and community stakeholders. These regional partners use strategies such as community member surveys, CBO surveys, and public listening sessions to solicit information on community needs. Together with other healthcare organizations and CBOs, Northwell participates in meetings organized by these regional departments of health academic organizations to discuss the shared responsibility of public health planning within the NYS Prevention Agenda. These meetings provide an opportunity for general discussion regarding the public health goals of the NYS Prevention Agenda and the selection of shared priorities for collaborative regional planning.

Net patient accounts are reduced by an allowance for doubtful receivables based upon the hospital's historical collection experience adjusted for current environmental risks and trends for each major payor source. Significant provision is made for self-pay patient accounts in the period of service based on past collection experience. The hospital's concentration of credit risk related to net patient accounts is limited due to the diversity of patients and payors. Net patient accounts consist of amounts due from governmental programs (primarily Medicare and Medicaid), private insurance companies, managed care programs and patients themselves. Net patient service revenue for services provided to patients who have third-party payor coverage is recognized based on contractual rates for services rendered. The hospital recognizes a significant amount of patient service revenue at the time services are rendered even though it does not assess the patient's ability to pay. As a result, the provision for bad debts is presented as a deduction from patient service revenue (net of contractual provisions and discounts). Amounts recognized are subject to adjustment upon review by third-party payors. For uninsured patients that do not qualify for charity care, the hospital recognizes revenue when services are provided. Based on historical experience, a significant portion of the hospital's uninsured patients will be unable or unwilling to pay for services provided. Thus, the hospital records a significant provision for bad debts related to uninsured patients in the period the services are provided. Any discounts applied to self-pay patients would be deemed either Charity or a contractual adjustment. Bad debt would be based on the balance after the charity or contractual adjustment that is deemed uncollectable following a reasonable collection effort."

The amount of the allowance for doubtful accounts is based upon managements assessment of historical and expected net collections, business and economic conditions, trends in Medicare and Medicaid health care coverage and other collection indicators. Additions to the allowance for doubtful accounts result from the provision for doubtful collections. Accounts written off as uncollectible are deducted from the allowance for doubtful accounts. Net Patient Service Revenue --------------------------- The Medical Center has agreements with third-party payors that provide for payments to the Medical Center at amounts different from its established rates. Payment arrangements include prospectively determined rates per discharge, reimbursed costs, discounts from charges and per diem payments. Net patient service revenue is reported at estimated net realizable amounts due from patients, third-party payors and others for services rendered and includes estimated retroactive revenue adjustments due to ongoing and future audits, reviews and investigations. Retroactive adjustments are considered in the recognition of revenue on an estimated basis in the period that related services are rendered and adjusted in future periods as adjustments become known or as years are no longer subject to such audits, reviews and investigations. Charity Care and Community Benefit ---------------------------------- In accordance with its mission and philosophy, the Medical Center commits substantial resources to sponsor a broad range of services to both the indigent as well as the broader community. Community benefits provided to the indigent include the cost of providing services to persons who cannot afford health care due to inadequate resources and/or who are uninsured or underinsured. This type of community benefit includes the costs of: traditional charity care; unpaid costs of care provided to beneficiaries of Medicare and Medicaid and other indigent public programs. Charity care is provided by the Medical Center to patients who meet certain criteria defined by the New Jersey Department of Health (""DOH"") without charge or at amounts less than established rates. The Medical Center reduces net revenues in accordance with these criteria. The Medical Center's records identify and monitor the level of charity care it provides. Community benefits provided to the broader community include the costs of providing services to other populations who may not qualify as indigent but may need special services and support. This type of community benefit includes the costs of: services such as health promotion and education, health screenings, all of which are not billed or can be operated only on a deficit basis; unpaid portions of training health professionals such as medical residents, students in allied health professions; and the unpaid portions of testing medical equipment and controlled studies of therapeutic protocols. The costs of charity care and other community benefit activities are derived from both estimated and actual data. The estimated cost of charity care includes the direct and indirect cost of providing such services and is estimated utilizing the Medical Center's ratio of cost to gross charges, which is then multiplied by the gross uncompensated charges associated with providing care to charity patients. The Medical Center receives payments from the New Jersey Health Care Subsidy Funds for charity care and such amounts totaled approximately $489,000 and $1.1 million for the years ended December 31, 2016 and 2015, respectively. This amount is subject to change from year to year based on available State amounts and allocation methodologies. Charity care subsidies and distributions subsequent to June 30, 2017 are presently unknown. Other Third-Party Payors ------------------------ The Medical Center also has entered into payment agreements with certain commercial insurance carriers and health maintenance organizations. The basis for payment to the Medical Center under these agreements includes prospectively determined rates per discharge or days of hospitalization and discounts from established charges. Some of these agreements have retrospective audit clauses, allowing the payor to review and adjust claims subsequent to initial payment. The Medical Center recognizes patient service revenue associated with services provided to patients who have third-party payor coverage on the basis of these established rates for the services rendered. For uninsured patients that do not qualify for charity care, the Medical Center recognizes revenues on the basis of its standard rates, discounted in accordance with the Medical Centers policy. On the basis of historical experience, a significant portion of the Medical Centers uninsured patients will be unable or unwilling to pay for the services provided. Thus, the Medical Center records a significant provision of bad debts related to uninsured patients in the period the services are provided. For the years ended December 31, 2016 and 2015, net patient service revenue was increased by approximately $10,906,000 and $5,894,000, respectively, for favorable adjustments and settlements related to prior years."

The organization feels that Medicare underpayments (shortfall), bad debt and associated costs are community benefit and are includable on the Form 990, Schedule H, Part I. As outlined more fully below, the organization believes that these services and related costs promote the health of the community as a whole and are rendered in conjunction with the organization's charitable tax-exempt purposes and mission in providing medically necessary healthcare services to all individuals in a non-discriminatory manner without regard to race, color, creed, sex, national origin or ability to pay and consistent with the community benefit standard promulgated by the IRS. The community benefit standard is the current standard for a hospital for recognition as a tax-exempt and charitable organization under internal revenue code (""IRC"") 501(c)(3). The organization is recognized as a tax-exempt entity and charitable organization under 501(c)(3) of the IRC. Although there is no definition in the tax code for the term ""charitable"" a regulation promulgated by the department of the treasury provides some guidance and states that ""the term charitable is used in section 501(c)(3) in its generally accepted legal sense,provides examples of charitable purposes, including the relief of the poor or unprivileged; the promotion of social welfare; and the advancement of education, religion, and science. Note it does not explicitly address the activities of hospitals. In the absence of explicit statutory or regulatory requirements applying the term ""charitable"" to hospitals, it has been left to the IRS to determine the criteria hospitals must meet to qualify as IRC 501(c)(3) charitable organizations. The original standard was known as the charity care standard. This standard was replaced by the IRS with the community benefit standard which is the current standard. Charity care standard In 1956, the IRS issued revenue ruling 56-185, which addressed the requirements hospitals needed to meet in order to qualify for IRC 501(c)(3) status. One of these requirements is known as the ""charity care standard."" under the standard, a hospital must provide, to the extent of its financial ability, free or reduced-cost care to patients who cannot pay for such services. A hospital that expected full payment did not, according to the ruling, provide charity care based on the fact that some patients ultimately failed to pay. The ruling emphasized that a low level of charity care did not necessarily mean that a hospital had failed to meet the requirement since that level could reflect its financial ability to provide such care. The ruling also noted that publicly supported community hospitals would normally qualify as charitable organizations because they serve the entire community and a low level of charity care would not affect a hospital's exempt status if it was due to the surrounding community's lack of charitable demands. Community benefit standard In 1969, the IRS issued revenue ruling 69-545, which ""removed"" from revenue ruling 56-185 ""the requirements relating to caring for patients without charge or at rates below cost."" under the standard developed in revenue ruling 69-545, which is known as the ""community benefit standard,"" hospitals are judged on whether they promote the health of a broad class of individuals in the community. The ruling involved a hospital that only admitted individuals who could pay for the services (by themselves, private insurance, or public programs such as Medicare), but operated a full-time emergency room that was open to everyone. The IRS ruled that the hospital qualified as a charitable organization because it promoted the health of people in its community. The IRS reasoned that because the promotion of health was a charitable purpose according to the general law of charity, it fell within the ""generally accepted legal sense"" of the term ""charitable,"" as required by the department of treasury reg. 1.501(c)(3)-1(d)(2). The IRS ruling stated that the promotion of health, like the relief of poverty and the advancement of education and religion, is one of the purposes in the general law of charity that is deemed beneficial to the community as a whole even though the class of beneficiaries eligible to receive a direct benefit from its activities does not include all members of the community, such as indigent members of the community, provided that the class is not so small that its relief is not of benefit to the community. The IRS concluded that the hospital was ""promoting the health of a class of persons that is broad enough to benefit the community"" because its emergency room was open to all and it provided care to everyone who could pay, whether directly or through third-party reimbursement. Other characteristics of the hospital that the IRS highlighted included the following: its surplus funds were used to improve patient care, expand hospital facilities, and advance medical training, education and research; it was controlled by a board of trustees that consisted of independent civic leaders; and hospital medical staff privileges were available to all qualified physicians. The American Hospital Association (""AHA"") feels that Medicare underpayments (shortfall) and bad debt are community benefit and thus includable on the Form 990, Schedule H, Part I. This organization agrees with the AHA's position. As outlined in the AHA's letter to the IRS dated August 21, 2007 with respect to the first published draft of the new Form 990 and Schedule H, the AHA felt that the IRS should incorporate the full value of the community benefit that hospitals provide by counting Medicare underpayments (shortfall) as quantifiable community benefit for the following reasons: - providing care for the elderly and serving Medicare patients is an essential part of the community benefit standard - Medicare, like Medicaid, does not pay the full cost of care. From the latest data provided by the AHA, as of 2012, Medicare reimburses hospitals only 86 cents for every dollar they spend to take care of Medicare patients. The Medicare payment advisory commission (""Medpac""), in its march 2013 report to congress, states that beneficiaries will grow notably faster in the next 10 years than in the past decade as the baby-boom generation ages into the program. In addition, the population aging into the Medicare program will present a new set of challenges since rising obesity levels put this population at a greater risk than previous generations for chronic disease. - Many Medicare beneficiaries, like their Medicaid counterparts, are poor. More than 42 percent of Medicare spending is for beneficiaries whose income is below 200 percent of the federal poverty level. Many of those Medicare beneficiaries are also eligible for Medicaid -- so called eligible."" There is every compelling public policy reason to treat Medicare and Medicaid underpayments similarly for purposes of a hospital's community benefit and include these costs on Form 990, Schedule H, Part I. Medicare underpayment must be shouldered by the hospital in order to continue treating the community's elderly and poor. These underpayments represent a real cost of serving the community and should count as a quantifiable community benefit. Both the AHA and this organization also feel that patient bad debt is a community benefit and thus includable on the Form 990, Schedule H, Part I. Like Medicare underpayment (shortfalls), there also are compelling reasons that patient bad debt should be counted as quantifiable community benefit as follows: - A significant majority of bad debt is attributable to low-income patients, who, for many reasons, decline to complete the forms required to establish eligibility for hospitals' charity care or those who do not pay all, or a portion of the already discounted billed amounts under our financial assistance policy. A 2006 congressional budget office (""CBO"") report, nonprofit hospitals and the provision of community benefits, cited two studies indicating that ""the great majority of bad debt was attributable to patients with incomes below 200% of the federal poverty line."" - the report also noted that a substantial portion of bad debt is pending charity care. Unlike bad debt in other industries, hospital bad debt is complicated by the fact that hospitals follow their mission to the community and treat every patient that comes through their emergency department, regardless of ability to pay. Patients who have outstanding bills are not turned away, unlike other industries. Bad debt is further complicated by the auditing industry's standards on reporting charity care. Many patients cannot or do not provide the necessary, extensive documentation required to be deemed charity care by auditors. As a result, roughly 40% of bad debt is pending charity care. The CBO concluded that its findings ""support the validity of the use of u"

RESEARCH HAS CONTINUALLY SHOWN THAT WHEN THE FACTORS INFLUENCING HEALTH ARE EXPLORED, HEALTH CARE ACTUALLY PLAYS THE SMALLEST ROLE PROPORTIONATELY. A REPORT IN THE JOURNAL OF AMERICAN MEDICAL ASSOCIATION AND THE CENTER FOR DISEASE CONTROL (MCGINNIS, 1996) SUGGESTS THAT THE FACTORS IMPACTING HEALTH ARE AS FOLLOWS: LIFESTYLE AND BEHAVIORS, 50%, ENVIRONMENT (HUMAN AND NATURAL), 20%, GENETICS AND HUMAN BIOLOGY, 20%, AND HEALTH CARE, 10%. COMMUNITY BUILDING ACTIVITIES HELP TO ADDRESS THE OTHER INDICATORS OUTSIDE OF THE ROLE TRADITIONALLY PLAYED BY HEALTH-CARE ORGANIZATIONS. THESE ACTIVITIES ARE ALMOST EXCLUSIVELY DONE IN SOME FORM OF PARTNERSHIP IN WHICH THE COMMUNITY OR OTHER ORGANIZATIONS ARE BETTER SUITED TO ADDRESS. HEALTH-CARE ORGANIZATIONS GENERALLY PROVIDE TIMELY AND SPECIFIC RESOURCES TO HELP THESE ISSUES. HEALTH-CARE ORGANIZATIONS CAN BE A RICH AND VALUABLE COMMUNITY RESOURCE IN WAYS NOT TYPICALLY CONSIDERED. OFTEN THE MOST EFFECTIVE WAY TO HELP IMPACT AND IMPROVE THE COMMUNITY HEALTH STATUS IS TO SUPPORT OTHER AGENCIES AND ORGANIZATIONS IN A VARIETY OF WAYS OUTSIDE OF HEALTH SERVICES. THIS IS OFTEN DONE THROUGH CASH OR IN-KIND SERVICES TO SUPPORT OTHER NON-PROFITS, DONATIONS OF DURABLE MEDICAL EQUIPMENT AND SUPPLIES TO CERTAIN AGENCIES, OR THROUGH LEADERSHIP AND EDUCATIONAL EXPERTISE. TRINITY MEDICAL CENTER CONTRIBUTES FINANCIALLY TO A WIDE VARIETY OF COMMUNITY ORGANIZATIONS THAT ADDRESS THE BROADER NEEDS OF THE COMMUNITY. THESE DONATIONS ALLOW OTHER NON-PROFIT ORGANIZATIONS TO FULFILL THEIR MISSIONS TO IMPROVE THE WELL BEING OF THE COMMUNITY AND CONTRIBUTE TO ITS OVERALL HEALTH STATUS IN WAYS THAT MAY DIFFER FROM THE DIRECT SERVICES OF THE HOSPITAL ORGANIZATION AND MAXIMIZE THE RESOURCES THEY HAVE TO WORK WITH. TRINITY MEDICAL CENTER EMPLOYEES ARE ACTIVE IN EDUCATING PARTNERS ON A WIDE VARIETY OF HEALTH SUBJECTS THAT ADVANCE THEIR WORK. FURTHER, TRINITY MEDICAL CENTER EMPLOYEES ARE MEMBERS OF MANY NON-PROFIT BOARDS TO PROVIDE LEADERSHIP OR COLLABORATE TO ADDRESS COMPLEX HEALTH ISSUES.

THE PURPOSE OF THE PLAN IS TO PROVIDE DIRECTION AND CONTEXT FOR HOSPITAL DECISION MAKING AND RESOURCE ALLOCATION CONSISTENT WITH LOCAL HEALTH CARE NEEDS AND MARKET OPPORTUNITIES. TO ACCOMPLISH THIS TASK, THE COMMITTEE CREATED A COMPREHENSIVE, PARTICIPATORY PROCESS TO SOLICIT INPUT FROM ALL LEVELS OF THE ORGANIZATION AND THE COMMUNITY. A MULTI-STEP PLANNING PROCESS WAS INITIATED.STEP 1 INVOLVED THE REVIEW AND REVISION OF THE HOSPITAL'S MISSION AND VISION STATEMENTS. BOTH STATEMENTS WERE MODIFIED FROM WHAT HAD PREVIOUSLY EXISTED. A CONCISE, VALUE DRIVEN MISSION STATEMENT WAS DEVELOPED IN RESPONSE TO THE NEED FOR MISSION STATEMENTS TO DESCRIBE ""WHO WE ARE."" ADDITIONALLY, SEVERAL CORE VALUES WERE DELINEATED IN SUPPORT OF THE MISSION STATEMENT. THE VISION STATEMENT WAS DEVELOPED IN RESPONSE TO THE QUESTION OF ""WHAT DO WE WISH TO BECOME"" WITH THE UNDERSTANDING THAT VISION STATEMENTS SHOULD BE REALISTIC, CREDIBLE, AND POSSESS THE ABILITY TO INSPIRE AND MOTIVATE. STEP 2 IDENTIFIED A SERIES OF CRITICAL ISSUES FACING THE HOSPITAL THAT WILL PROVIDE THE CONTEXT FOR THE HOSPITAL'S NEAR TERM OPERATING ENVIRONMENT WITH RESPECT TO CARE DELIVERY, REGULATION, COMPETITION, FINANCE AND KEY PUBLICS. STEP 3 INVOLVED THE DEVELOPMENT OF A COMPREHENSIVE ENVIRONMENTAL ANALYSIS, INCLUDING AN INTERNAL AND EXTERNAL ASSESSMENT OF THE HOSPITAL. THE INTERNAL ASSESSMENT WAS PROVIDED VIA MULTIPLE FOCUS GROUPS - OPEN DISCUSSIONS ABOUT THE HOSPITAL'S STRENGTHS, WEAKNESSES, OPPORTUNITIES AND THREATS. THESE FOCUS GROUPS, FACILITATED BY AN OUTSIDE CONSULTANT RETAINED BY THE HOSPITAL, PROVIDED INPUT FROM PHYSICIANS, EMPLOYEES, VOLUNTEERS AND THE COMMUNITY AND PROVIDED SIGNIFICANT INSIGHT INTO STRENGTHS, WEAKNESSES, AND OPPORTUNITIES FOR IMPROVEMENT. THE EXTERNAL ASSESSMENT WAS DEVELOPED FROM THE COMPILATION OF UTILIZATION, MARKET SHARE DEMOGRAPHIC AND FINANCIAL DATA AND PHYSICIAN WORKFORCE INFORMATION SPECIFIC TO THE HOSPITAL'S SERVICE AREA.STEPS 4, 5 AND 6 IDENTIFIED GOALS, STRATEGIES, AND OBJECTIVES THAT WILL SERVE AS OLEAN GENERAL HOSPITAL'S PRIORITIES THROUGH 2019. THE PLAN WAS REVIEWED IN JUNE 2016 AND INITIATIVES ADDED THAT WERE CARRIED OUT IN 2016. GOALS RESPOND TO THE QUESTION ""WHAT ARE THE KEY PRIORITIES?"" A SERIES OF STRATEGIES WERE DEVELOPED WHICH RESPOND TO THE QUESTION ""HOW DO WE ACHIEVE OUR PRIORITIES?"" FINALLY, A NUMBER OF SPECIFIC OBJECTIVES WERE DEVELOPED WHICH RESPOND TO THE QUESTION ""WHAT WILL BE ACCOMPLISHED ANNUALLY?"" OBJECTIVES WERE GENERATED BY SENIOR MANAGEMENT AND FORM THE BASIS FOR NEAR TERM ADMINISTRATIVE WORKPLANS.ESSENTIAL TO THE SUCCESS OF ANY STRATEGIC PLAN IS THE HOSPITAL'S ABILITY TO BOTH IMPLEMENT RECOMMENDATIONS MADE WITHIN THE PLAN AND TO RECOGNIZE THE DOCUMENT AS A DYNAMIC AND FLEXIBLE TOOL TO BE USED AS A GUIDE FOR THE FUTURE. SPECIFIC GOALS AND STRATEGIES MAY OR MAY NOT BE OBTAINED AND, UPON EVALUATION AND THE AVAILABILITY OF NEW INFORMATION AND DEVELOPMENTS, MAY NEED TO BE MODIFIED. A SUCCESSFUL STRATEGIC PLAN RECOGNIZES THIS POTENTIAL FOR CHANGE AND IS FLEXIBLE ENOUGH TO ACCOMMODATE NEW OR DIFFERENT OPPORTUNITIES AND CHALLENGES.CRITICAL HEALTH CARE ISSUESTHE ENACTED HEALTHCARE REFORM LEGISLATION UNDERSCORES MANY OF THE SIGNIFICANT ISSUES CURRENTLY FACING HOSPITALS. FOLLOWING IS LISTING OF CRITICAL ISSUES THAT WILL IMPACT HOSPITALS OVER THE NEXT SEVERAL YEARS. 1. QUALITY: HEALTH CARE QUALITY AND SAFETY ARE NOW STRATEGICALLY IMPORTANT, NOT JUST PROFESSIONALLY IMPORTANT. THE ADVENT OF WIDESPREAD PUBLIC REPORTING OF HOSPITAL QUALITY RESULTS ASSURES THAT A HOSPITAL'S QUALITY PERFORMANCE IS NO LONGER ONLY VISIBLE TO THE DIRECTOR OF QUALITY, QA COMMITTEE MEMBERS AND VARIOUS REGULATORS. THE NET EFFECT OF THIS TRANSPARENCY TREND OVER THE NEXT 5 YEARS WILL BE THAT THE DEFINITION OF A ""GOOD HOSPITAL"" WILL SHIFT SIGNIFICANTLY. NO LONGER WILL IT BE ENOUGH TO HAVE ATTRACTIVE FACILITIES, GOOD TECHNOLOGIES AND SKILLED DOCTORS AND NURSES. HOSPITALS WILL NEED TO MARSHAL THOSE RESOURCES INTO A QUALITY AND SAFETY SYSTEM CAPABLE OF RELIABLY PRODUCING MEASURED QUALITY RESULTS. PROVIDER PAYMENTS WILL INCREASINGLY BE A FUNCTION OF QUALITY OUTCOMES AND QUALITY BONUSES WILL BE DRAWN FROM ANNUAL PAYMENT UPDATES. INFORMATION SYSTEMS CAPABLE OF PROVIDING VALID AND RELIABLE QUALITY AND OUTCOME INDICATORS WILL BE A NECESSITY AS WILL THE USE OF EVIDENCE BASED GUIDELINES BY CLINICAL PROVIDERS. CONSUMERS WILL SEEK AND USE PERFORMANCE INFORMATION, INCLUDING PATIENT SATISFACTION INFORMATION, TO GUIDE THEIR CHOICE OF PROVIDERS.2. INFORMATION TECHNOLOGY: HEALTH INFORMATION TECHNOLOGY INCLUDES COMPUTER BASED TOOLS DEVELOPED SPECIFICALLY FOR HEALTH CARE DELIVERY. THESE TOOLS CAN PROVIDE CLINICIANS UP-TO-DATE INFORMATION ON THEIR PATIENTS, ACCESS TO THE LATEST MEDICAL KNOWLEDGE AND BEST PRACTICES THROUGH DECISION SUPPORT SYSTEMS. IT IS UNDERSTOOD THAT INVESTMENTS IN NEW CLINICAL AND INFORMATION TECHNOLOGY CAN SIGNIFICANTLY ENHANCE PATIENT SAFETY AND CLINICAL OUTCOMES. COMPUTERIZED PHYSICIAN ORDER ENTRY (CPOE), BAR CODING AND ITS POTENTIAL TO REDUCE MEDICATION ERRORS, AND ELECTRONIC MEDICAL RECORDS (EMRS) AND THEIR POSITIVE IMPACT ON MEDICAL ERRORS ARE ALL EXAMPLES OF HEALTH CARE'S USE OF IT SOLUTIONS TO IMPROVE QUALITY. THE FEDERAL GOVERNMENT HAS HIGHLIGHTED THE ROLE OF HEALTH INFORMATION TECHNOLOGY AS A MEANS TO IMPROVE HEALTH CARE QUALITY, SAFETY AND NOW IS PROVIDING STIMULUS AND INCENTIVE PAYMENTS TO PROVIDERS TO FACILITATE AND HASTEN THEIR ADOPTION INTO THE CARE DELIVERY PROCESS. EMR'S WILL BECOME A PREREQUISITE OF ANY DELIVERY SYSTEM THAT INTENDS TO PROVIDE COORDINATED COST EFFECTIVE CARE.3. PHYSICIANS: PHYSICIANS HAVE EMERGED AS CRITICAL OPERATIONAL AND STRATEGIC PARTNERS TO HOSPITALS. THOSE THAT ARE SUCCESSFUL IN ENGAGING AND COLLABORATING WITH THEIR MEDICAL STAFF WILL BE BEST ABLE TO DEMONSTRATE HIGH QUALITY CARE AND COMPLIANCE WITH HEALTH REFORM'S VALUE BASED PURCHASING AND OTHER QUALITY MANDATES. ADDITIONALLY, GIVEN THE INCREASE IN DEMAND FOR HEALTHCARE SERVICES THAT WILL BE OCCASIONED BY REFORM, THE ABILITY TO SUCCESSFULLY RECRUIT PHYSICIANS WILL BE CRITICAL. AT A TIME WHEN HEALTHCARE REFORM INITIATIVES EMPHASIZE THE ROLE OF PRIMARY CARE, THERE IS A SPECIAL NEED TO INTENSIFY EFFORTS TO RECRUIT PRIMARY CARE PROVIDERS. BECAUSE THE VAST MAJORITY OF NEW PHYSICIANS PREFER EMPLOYMENT AS THEIR PRACTICE PREFERENCE, THE ABILITY OF HOSPITALS TO BE ABLE TO OFFER PHYSICIANS A CONTEMPORARY AND COMPETITIVE ""EMPLOYMENT PLATFORM"" IS ESSENTIAL.4. FINANCE AND CAPITAL: FINANCIAL PERFORMANCE AND ACCESS TO CAPITAL WILL CONTINUE TO BE AMONG THE MOST CRITICAL ISSUES CONFRONTING HOSPITALS. EVEN WITH HEALTHCARE REFORM, HEALTHCARE COSTS WILL CONTINUE TO OUTPACE INFLATION. INCREASING WAGE AND SALARY COSTS, AND RISING HEALTH CARE COSTS IN GENERAL WILL CONTINUE TO IMPACT OPERATING PERFORMANCE AND PRESS HOSPITALS TO CONTINUE A RELENTLESS FOCUS ON COST MANAGEMENT. ADDITIONALLY, REVENUE STRATEGIES WILL NEED TO BE DEVELOPED TO GENERATE PROFITABLE GROWTH IN PATIENT VOLUME, AS WILL THE NEED TO ENSURE OPTIMAL MANAGEMENT OF ALL REVENUE CYCLE ACTIVITIES. HOSPITALS ARE FACING SIGNIFICANT PAYMENT REDUCTIONS IN TERMS OF DECREASES IN MEDICARE UPDATES, DISPROPORTIONATE SHARE, SNF AND HOMECARE PAYMENTS. AS HOSPITALS CONTINUE TO POST LOW OR NO PROFIT MARGINS, INVESTMENT INCOME WILL BE MORE IMPORTANT THAN EVER. HOWEVER, GIVEN THE FACT THAT INVESTMENT INCOME IS A HIGHLY UNCERTAIN COMPONENT OF A HOSPITAL'S OVERALL FINANCIAL HEALTH, HOSPITALS WILL BE DRIVEN TO PURSUE MORE PHILANTHROPY. HOSPITAL CAPITAL SPENDING WILL BE DRIVEN BY GROWING DEMANDS FOR ADVANCED TECHNOLOGY NEEDED TO ENSURE PATIENT QUALITY AND SAFETY, THE NEED TO REPLACE AND UPDATE AGING FACILITIES, AND THE DESIRE AND NEED TO IMPROVE TECHNOLOGY BASED SERVICES.IN 2016 OGH'S BOARD OF DIRECTORS VOTED TO BECOME PART OF THE KALEIDA HEALTH SYSTEM, A BUFFALO, NEW YORK-BASED HEALTH SYSTEM. THIS DECISION WAS BASED ON A FIVE YEAR LONG-TERM FINANCIAL PLAN THAT WAS DEVELOPED FOR OGH AND ITS SISTER HOSPITAL UNDER OGH'S PARENT COMPANY- UPPER ALLEGHENY HEALTH SYSTEM (UAHS), WHICH DEMONSTRATED A FUTURE INABILITY TO REMAIN FINANCIALLY VIABLE GIVEN THE DOWNWARD PRESSURES ON REVENUE IN THE HEALTH CARE INDUSTRY AS WELL AS RISING COSTS TO PROVIDE CARE. OGH IS NOT UNIQUE IN THIS VULNERABLE POSITION. HOSPITALS ACROSS AMERICA, ESPECIALLY RURAL HOSPITALS, FACE A DAUNTING CHALLENGE OF SURVIVAL. SIGNIFICANT TIME WAS SPENT ANALYZING OGH'S AND UAHS' FINANCES AND EVALUATING KALEIDA HEALTH AS A PARTNER. A DECISION TO AFFILIATE WAS MADE IN THE FALL OF 2016.

Presence Saint Joseph Medical Center (1): PARTNERSHIP WITH THE WILL-GRUNDY MEDICAL CLINIC (WGMC) & AUNT MARTHAS YOUTH SERVICES CENTER/ KNOW WHERE TO GO CAMPAIGN Identified need: Primary Health Care PSJMC has budgeted $35,000 to donate to the Will-Grundy Medical Clinic in 2016. In addition to this donation, PSJMC will continue to provide clinical staff volunteers, and will contribute free services and leadership through service on WGMCs board of directors. PSJMC will also continue to accept patients from Will-Grundy Medical Clinic for surgical procedures and related services to provide better access to care, particularly specialty care. In December 2012, an Aunt Marthas Federally Qualified Healthcare Center (FQHC) was opened adjacent to our Emergency Department. Since its opening, PSJMC has provided rental space to the FQHC for $1 per year. In 2016, we are partnering with these two organizations as well as others serving on the MAPP Collaborative Primary Health Care action team to develop an educational media campaign called Know Where to Go. This county-wide campaign will educate consumers on when to visit the Emergency Department and when to see their primary health care provider. It will also re-educate the community on the availability of FQHCs within our county as well as the WGMC. Will COUNTY PARTNERS FOR HEALTHY FAMILIES (WCPHF) Identified need: Chronic Disease In 2007, PSJMC created the Joliet Partners for Healthy Families coalition to help combat childhood obesity in Will County. In 2015, the partnership completed a strategic planning session in which the name was changed to the Will County Partners for Healthy Families (WCPHF). The mission of WCPHF is to enhance the quality of life by improving the health and wellness of the community. The vision is healthy kids, healthy families, healthy community through programs, policies and environmental changes in Will County. The partner list includes the Greater Joliet Area YMCA, Harvey Brooks Foundation, Joliet Park District, University of Illinois Extension, University of Saint Francis, Will County Health Department and the Will County Regional Office of Education. WCPHF has been innovative in its collaboration and approaches to childhood obesity by creating the two community based grants for CATCH Kids Club of Will County and Junior Master Gardener Community Gardens of Will County. These initiatives focus on educating students and families about the importance of balanced nutrition and regular physical activity while incorporating programs and policies to help sustain greater health for future youth. In addition, in 2013 the partnership started a month long physical activity contest with the purpose of encouraging Will County students to incorporate more physical activity into their daily lives. Similar to reading contests within the schools, the Commit to Be Fit Contest was offered to all Will County students. Students committed to the program by signing up and tracking their daily physical activity. They did this manually on forms distributed by their teachers or online on the Will County Regional Office of Educations website. All participants in the program received a free daily pass to be used at either the Joliet Park District Splash Station Water Park and at a Greater Joliet YMCA location. Students who exceed the recommended 60 minutes of daily physical activity were entered to win raffle prizes. WEWILL WORK HEALTHY AWARD Identified need: Chronic Disease The WEWILL Work Healthy award program was created by the MAPP Chronic Care Action Team to recognize Will County workplaces that are committed to improving employee health and well-being through six main areas of worksite wellness: 1.

Safety RETHINK YOUR DRINK CAMPAIGN Identified need: Chronic Disease The MAPP Collaborative Chronic Care action team partnered with the Illinois Alliance to Prevent Obesity (IAPO) to bring the Rethink Your Drink education and communication campaign to Will County to educate stakeholder organizations and community residents about the harms of sugar sweetened beverage (SSB) Consumption. Mental Health First Aid Identified need: Mental Health In response to a demonstrated system and state-wide need of addressing barriers to accessing and utilizing mental health services, Presence Health and its community partners implemented an evidence-based program, Mental Health First Aid (MHFA), to reduce the stigma associated with mental illness and improve the coordination of mental health care throughout a six county service area. A system-wide action team was created to oversee the process, with administrative, local and behavioral health representatives that earned support from applicable Senior and Executive leadership teams. Community stakeholders partnered in the development of the strategy and its implementation throughout the process, recruiting trainees, identifying resources, and disseminating findings. Program participants increased recognition of mental health disorders, increased understanding of appropriate treatments, improved confidence in providing help to others during crisis situations, and decreased stigmatizing attitudes. Having demonstrated its effectiveness, the program continues to expand and add both participants and partners. Enrollment Strategy Identified need: Access to Care In response to a demonstrated community need of improving affordable access to health care, Presence Health and its community partners engaged in the development of a community-wide enrollment strategy so as to decrease the percentage of Illinois residents without health insurance. An over-arching strategy was created in partnership with community stakeholders to guide the 2015-2016 Open Enrollment period. The model boasts a four-pronged approach: 1.

201733179349302873,840166760,"SCHEDULE H, PART II","In 2016, Childrens Hospital Colorado provided $1,013,049 in community building activities. These activities are designed to promote the health of the broader community. We continue to build on our long and strong record of collaboration with community groups, businesses, academic institutions and governmental and non-governmental organizations, with the goal of improving health outcomes and reducing health disparities for children and their families. Additionally, significant resources were allocated in 2016 to support efforts to engage community members in advocating for access to health care as well as providing educational sessions for both policymakers and advocates on child health issues of importance. Improving the health of the community through environmental efforts was also a priority, including long-standing recycling and retro commissioning efforts. Finally, the hospital contributed substantial resources to programs, such as our Hire Local Program, that provide a pipeline for at-risk high school students, and underserved community members to pursue healthcare specific careers. Selected community building activities are highlighted below. Community Health Improvement: During the 2015 community needs assessment process, Childrens Hospital Colorado learned that not only was mental health a priority for the community, but also that the stigma associated with mental health conditions often prevented parents and caregivers, as well as youth themselves, from seeking help when they needed it. Because stigma is social, no one entity alone can tackle it. Thus, in 2016 Childrens Colorado sought partnership in our fellow nonprofit hospitals and local public health departments which also shared mental health as a priority identified in their needs assessments, along with the desire to reduce the stigma surrounding it. Tri-County Health Department agreed to be the convener and fiscal agent, and Childrens Hospital Colorado came to the table as a key partner, along with other hospitals, mental health centers, and local public health departments from the Denver metro area. The goal was to develop a shared message platform around reducing mental health stigma and to provide content that all partner organizations could utilize in their work. Partners agreed that low income adults would be a primary audience. In addition to key employees from each organization informing the message and content development, focus groups were conducted with a diverse group of stakeholders, including parents (both English and Spanish speaking), and providers who serve low income families, and Childrens Colorado assisted in these efforts. A common message platform, ""Lets Talk Colorado"" has been developed, and will be utilized in 2017 to change community behavior and perceptions. A set of questions related to mental health stigma has been added to the CDC Behavioral Risk Factor Surveillance System (BRFSS) by Tri County Health Department as one way we can measure community impact. The Let's Talk Colorado website launched, in May 2017, a mental health stigma reduction campaign created by a 20-member coalition, including CHCO and which links to CHCO resources. Leadership Development and Training for Community Members: Childrens Advocacy Boot Camp is a new leadership development program for community members who want to learn how to advocate for child health issues that matter to them. Consisting of seven monthly half-day sessions featuring expert speakers on a variety of advocacy related topics, Advocacy Boot Camp resembles a traditional leadership program geared toward teaching the fundamentals of becoming an effective advocate whether that is at the Capitol, in the community or in a healthcare setting. Skills development includes: Identification of community resources that support children and understanding of how to effectively utilize them; building confidence in communicating with elected officials and other community leaders on behalf of children; developing public speaking skills and strategies; learning the importance of the media and how to leverage it to make positive societal improvements for children; gaining an understanding of the legislative process and state budgeting; and navigating the State Capitol. The program had 19 graduates in 2016. Community Support: Children's Hospital Colorado serves as lead agency for Safe Kids Colorado, Safe Kids Colorado Springs, and Safe Kids Denver Metro. As part of the Safe Kids Worldwide global network of alliances, each of these initiatives employs an alliance-based approach to building capacity toward preventing unintentional injuries in targeted locations. Neighborhoods whose children are at disproportionate risk for preventable injuries are identified through data surveillance ""heat maps."" Safe Kids partners with numerous public and private businesses and organizations to implement and evaluate evidence-based approaches under a public health model of prevention. Childrens Hospital Colorado provides community support in several ways, including guiding monthly coalition meetings, providing child passenger safety, infant safe sleep, bike and pedestrian safety, and teen driver safety resources, to paying liability insurance premiums for a local nonprofit partner that allows them to continue conducting neighborhood car seat checks. Children's Colorados experienced injury prevention staff also provides programmatic and financial support to a variety of injury prevention initiatives around the state, thereby contributing to a collective impact approach to the larger injury burden. Advocacy for community Health Improvement: The Government Affairs department hosted a day at the Capitol, Speak Up for Kids Day, on March 16, 2016 to teach 160 community members from around Colorado how to influence change regarding child health policy issues at the state legislative level. The hospital staff facilitate connections among community members and key state-level decision-makers and help community members learn how to speak up and influence child health policy at the state legislative level. Approximately one time per month in 2016, the government affairs department taught a half-day advocacy course to first year pediatric medical residents at the Capitol. The course involves topics about the legislative process, recent child health policy issues, and how to effectively speak up on state policy issues. The course aims to empower new pediatricians who are completing their residency training to advocate beyond the bedside for children. Workforce Development: Founded at Childrens in 1998, the Medical Career Collaborative program (MC2), is a hands-on learning program that serves low income minority youth interested in pursuing a career in the health care field. MC2 serves as an educational and supportive outlet for high achieving and driven students who often lack necessary supports in their communities. The programs mission of helping high school students from diverse backgrounds explore the world of healthcare and discover the opportunities available to them in the medical industry, is a strategic program as part of HRs workforce development efforts. As the program invests in these students it is essentially increasing the diversity and cultural awareness of the healthcare workforce as it builds the next generation of professionals here at Childrens Colorado and in the community. In 2016, there were 50 active students and 20 active graduates. Other workforce activities include the Hire Local Initiative that is a joint effort by the Anschutz medical campus Community-Campus Partnership (CCP) to provide the Aurora community (surrounding the campus) access to employment opportunities in the medical field. The vision for the Hire Local Program is to serve as a central point of contact for all local residents, especially underrepresented residents, to access information, services and programs related to jobs on Anschutz Medical Campus."

Across the hospital, numerous internal and external data sources are regularly monitored and utilized to identify trends and opportunities to impact child health. Additionally, hospital staff dedicates significant time to serving on community boards and other community groups that assess health needs of the community and proactively participates in the health improvement efforts led by these partners. Two examples are outlined below: CHCO clinical staff convened an internal meeting to discuss a recent increase in infant deaths in the Aurora community related to unsafe sleeping environments. The families were underserved, African American families from the Aurora Community. The Child Health Advocacy Institute (CHAI) was asked to explore opportunity for community engagement to address this issue in our local community. CHAI engaged the Center for Public Health Practice at the Colorado School of Public Health to convene a meeting of community groups working to address safe sleep in the Aurora community. Participants included representatives from the Colorado School of Public Health, Childrens Hospital Colorado, Healthy Babies Strong Families (HBSF), Community Action Network (CAN), City of Aurora, Families Forward Resource Center, and the Colorado Department of Public Health and Environment. Since the convening in October 2016, CHCO staff has joined a community coalition which was in the process of finalizing a ""More Black Birthdays Awareness Campaign"" (MBBA) which included a safe sleep component. In response to this community need the injury prevention program at CHCO has embarked on a safe sleep initiative in partnership with Colfax Community Network, a non-profit that serves low-income families living in motels along the Colfax corridor. CHCO has developed a staff training and parental educational materials supporting safe sleep along with purchasing Pack-n-Plays to distribute to low-income families in need. Childrens Hospital Colorados main hospital is located on the Anschutz Medical Campus in Aurora, Colorado. The community consists of many low-income neighborhoods and communities with significant unmet healthcare needs. Through Aurora Health Access (AHA), Childrens Hospital Colorado has supported a multi-pronged approach to creating a culture of health in Aurora an approach that aims to reduce the number of uninsured, promote access to care, improve care coordination, and encourage healthy behaviors. The mission of AHA is to collaboratively improve access to care and create a healthier Aurora, with a focus on the most vulnerable and underserved. AHA has over 1,000 members and it is through our participation that we are kept abreast of the most current health care needs of Aurora residents. Childrens Hospital Colorado leads the Pediatric Access to Care subcommittee and helps to focus the coalitions efforts on improving access to primary care and medical homes for children. CHCO staff also serves on the Board of Directors, the Executive Committee, and the Social Determinants of Health workgroup, and co-sponsors the bi-annual Aurora Kids Convening.

201733179349302873,840166760,"SCHEDULE H, PART VI, LINE 4","Childrens Hospital Colorado provides comprehensive medical care for kids from birth through adolescence. Childrens Hospital Colorado serves a seven-state region; however, many our patients come from Colorado and specifically the Denver metro area. Additionally, Childrens Hospital Colorado is the only Level 1 Pediatric Trauma Center in our seven-state region. Demographically, children served come from diverse cultural and ethnic backgrounds. Northwest Aurora, surrounding the main campus is one of the most diverse areas in the city. More than half of Auroras 350,000 residents belong to a minority population, and over 100 languages are spoken in Aurora Public Schools. Along with its diversity, Aurora faces challenges with health disparities, lower income and employment levels and other social determinants of health and economic well-being as compared to other parts of Aurora, the metro Denver area and the state of Colorado. In response to our diverse population, Childrens Hospital Colorado translates medical care and education instructions into 65 languages, including sign language, to deliver culturally sensitive, high-quality pediatric health care. Most patients speak English, followed by a significant number of families who speak Spanish, Arabic, Burmese, Vietnamese, Somalian, Russian and Korean. The payer mix of the eight communities (Adams, Arapahoe, Boulder, Broomfield, Denver, Douglas, Jefferson and El Paso) which framed the CHNA is as follows: 44.1 % commercial insurance, 47.7 % Medicaid, 3.1 % Tri-Care, and 3.3 % self -pay, indigent care and other. Within those respective counties there are 52 Federally Qualified Health Centers, 54 Community Mental Health Clinics and 20 Community Safety Net Clinics, one of which Childrens Hospital Colorado operates. To inform the development of the Implementation Strategy, Childrens Hospital Colorado is working with the Colorado Health Institute to identify factors closely associated with the priority health needs identified in the 2015 CHNA. This work entails the development of statistical models, based on the latest data available, to identify the likelihood of poor outcomes at the zip code level for each of the priority health needs in the respective counties."
201733179349302873,840166760,"SCHEDULE H, PART VI, LINE 5","In 2016, Childrens Hospital Colorado provided $190,012,653 in community benefit, 19.75% of total expenses. CHCO is committed to improving the health of children through the provision of high-quality, coordinated programs of patient care, education, research and advocacy. Childrens Hospital Colorado works to deliver on this mission not only in the Denver metro area and in the state of Colorado, but also throughout the Rocky Mountain region. There are extensive efforts led by Childrens Hospital Colorado that positively impact the health and safety of children in the community. Child Health Advocacy Institute (CHAI): The mission of CHAI is to improve the health and safety of children by engaging public and private partners in creating a thriving community for children. CHAI serves as a centralized resource for the hospital to identify community child health needs and develop and implement evidence-based programs and strategies in partnership with the community that seek to address these needs. The CHCO Community Health Needs Assessment (CHNA) was completed and approved by the Board of Directors in December of 2015 with the subsequent Community Health Action Plan (Implementation Plan) approved in May 2016. Because of the six priority areas identified in the CHNA, the Child Health Advocacy Institute (CHAI) restructured to focus specifically on these areas in 2016. A senior strategist with content expertise in each topic was assigned to lead the programmatic and partnership development for each of the following priority areas: dental, nutrition/obesity/physical activity, behavioral health, prematurity, respiratory and injury. The strategist works closely with a team of Prevention, Education and Outreach Coordinators and Community Engagement Coordinators to implement the programs designed to address the priority areas. Two additional team members were hired in 2016 to support the above efforts: A Population Health Epidemiologist and Community Health Education Marketing Specialist. The Population Health Epidemiologists responsibilities include using analytics to identify, assess and evaluate population-based trends to inform our strategies developed in the Community Health Action Plan (Implementation Plan). This individual is also responsible for collecting and tracking population health metrics tied to the CHNA that will be use to evaluate our implementation strategies and health outcomes. A total of 80 indicators have been developed to monitor the outcome of this body of work. The primary role of the Community Health Education Marketing Specialist is to raise awareness about community programs and advocacy work to community partners, members and stakeholders. This includes the development and organization of communications campaigns aimed at community health education. Additionally, work began in 2016 to develop a workforce of Community Health Workers. Recognizing that only 20% of health depends on clinical care and the other 80% depends on social determinants, a team of Community Health Workers that aimed to impact these social determinants is part of the overarching strategy to impact community health. Of that 80%, 40% is attributed to social and economic factors (education, culture, employment, income, community safety, family & social support), 30% to health behaviors (tobacco use, diet and exercise, alcohol use), and 10% to the physical environment (environmental quality). Many children experience overlapping determinants, such as low income, lack of transportation, and less access to safe places and role models, which consequently affects their health and wellbeing. Six Community Health Workers will begin work in three community-based settings in 2017: TRI-COUNTY WOMEN, INFANTS AND CHILDREN (WIC) OFFICE, two community pediatric practices and the Childrens Hospital Colorado Child Health Clinic. This reorganization and expansion of resources in CHAI demonstrates a commitment to cohesively and effectively impact the priority areas defined in our CHNA. Examples include: Obesity/Nutrition/Physical Activity: Camp Champions is a Childrens Hospital Colorado program developed to address accelerated summer weight gain in youth. It is a weeklong program for underserved, low-income youth that incorporates activities and curriculum from existing programs to engage youth in continuous physical activity while learning about goal setting, teamwork, nutrition, and healthy lifestyles. The campers are exposed to a variety of physical activities and hands on cooking lessons throughout the week as they earn points toward reaching their goal of climbing a flat 14er. The program was piloted in 2015 and continues to expand each year, serving up to 40 kids per week (currently a two-week program). Expansion to community partner sites is in development with a tailored curriculum and staff training program to fit the needs of community programs. Program Goals include: 1) engage youth in healthy lifestyle activities in FUN way that they and their parents/caregivers will positively respond to; 2) positively impact knowledge about healthy lifestyle and 3) emphasis on goal setting, confidence, fun -- not on weight loss. Participant and family response to the program in both 2015 and 2016 has been extremely positive. 97.7% of kids who participated gave camp a ""Good""Brilliant"" rating. Campers averaged nearly 20,000 steps per day and burned an average of 1600 calories per day during camp weeks. One parent stated, ""Kids were kept engaged, tried new foods and took ownership of how food affects health. Very supportive environment."" Another said He learned about other ways to relieve stress levels like yoga, walks, and HIKING AND ""I THINK THIS COULD HELP ALL OF US.still another noted she thinks this added to the knowledge she already has and will put her on a path to success. Respiratory Health: The Breathing Institute employs 7 community health educators to work with children and families in the Denver Public School and Aurora Public School systems to provide asthma education. In 2016, two community health workers were hired to conduct asthma education in the home setting. The health educators represent the Colorado Step Up Asthma Program which is a school-centered asthma program. The program is designed to help improve asthma control for students through educational classes, asthma self-management, environmental trigger awareness/reduction and community partnership with health providers. The Colorado Step Up Asthma Program is the only long running organized school-based initiative in Colorado. It has demonstrated significant improvement in clinical asthma outcomes including: improved school attendance rates, reduced frequency of asthma symptoms and decreased ER/Urgent Care visits for asthma. The program has also helped train school nurses to become certified asthma educators. The community health workers represent the Just Keep Breathing program which provides asthma management education in the home setting. The program focuses on improving care for pediatric patients with high risk asthma in Denver. For this program, children with asthma will be defined as children between the ages of 2 and 17 years who have been diagnosed with persistent asthma by a healthcare provider. Since the start of the asthma home visitation program, 27 families have received a home visit (54% of the 50 families goal by June 2018). In 2016, 55% of established asthma patients who had a hospitalization or Emergency Department visit had a follow-up doctor's visit within 30 days, up from 38% in 2015. Injury Prevention: The Child Passenger Safety Program at Children's Hospital Colorado is a collaborative effort between Street-Smart, Inc., Tri-County Health Department, and the Injury Prevention Program at Childrens Colorado. The goals of the program are to increase the number of Adams, Arapahoe, and Denver County children ages BIRTH THROUGH 8 YEARS OLD that are properly restrained, with special emphasis on increasing usage rates among at risk African-American and Hispanic families. The goals are pursued by (1) partnering with Denver Public Health to staff CPS inspection stations at Westwood Head Start and at the Eastside and Montbello Family Health Centers; (2) by conducting CPS education and car seat distribution classes for clients enrolled in the Women, Infants, and Children program at Tri-County H.D.; and (3) through referrals of low-income families enrolled in child health clinics at Childrens Colorado. To assess progress toward objectives, quarterly booster seat usage surveys were conducted in targeted neighborhoods. To promote the programs CPS resources, extensive marketing and communications efforts were developed and employed, including extensive use of social media platforms. The program includes staffing of CPS inspection stations at Childrens Colorado and Denver Health, and engaging WIC clients from Tri-County Health, where 841 child restraints were inspected and 565 were"

SOME OF OUR KEY ACTIVITIES HAVE ENHANCED HEALTH CARE ACCESS, PROVIDED PATIENT NAVIGATION AND A HOST OF SUPPORT SERVICES FOR OUR PATENTS. OUR COMMUNITY, OUTPATIENT, INPATIENT AND CLINICAL PATIENT NAVIGATION SERVICES PROVIDE COMMUNITY HEALTH EDUCATION, COORDINATE SCREENINGS, DEMYSTIFY TREATMENT OPTIONS, UN-COMPLICATE THE PROCESS FROM DIAGNOSIS TO TREATMENT, FACILITATE SCREENING AND DIAGNOSTIC TEST AND HEALTH AND PSYCHOSOCIAL SUPPORT SERVICES. BARRIERS TO CARE AND ACCESS TO TECHNOLOGICAL ADVANCEMENTS IN TREATING DISEASE ARE CONTINUALLY ADDRESSED FOR THE UNDERINSURED/UNDERSERVED POPULATION. OUR BREAST HEALTH PROGRAM IS DESIGNED TO REDUCE THE RATE OF LATE DIAGNOSIS AMONG MINORITY POPULATIONS, PARTICULARLY AFRICAN AMERICAN, WHO ARE MORE LIKELY TO BE DIAGNOSED AT LATER STAGES. WE COORDINATE CLINICAL BREAST EXAMS THAT LEAD TO MAMMOGRAMS, DIAGNOSTIC SERVICES, DIAGNOSIS AND TREATMENT. FOLLOW-UP SERVICES AND CLINICAL PATIENT NAVIGATION PROVIDED FREE OF CHARGE TO PATIENTS, IS AN EXTENSION OF THE HOSPITAL STAY FOR DISCHARGED PATIENTS WHO ARE FREQUENTLY AT RISK FOR READMISSION. TYPICALLY, THESE ARE CHRONICALLY ILL PATIENTS THAT ARE READMITTED BECAUSE OF THEIR UNIQUE FRAILTIES AND LACK OF SUPPORT FOR FOLLOW UP CARE REGIMENT. THEY HAVE LONGER PATIENT STAYS AND SIGNIFICANT AFTERCARE NEEDS. AS A RESULT, PATIENTS WELCOME THE ADDITIONAL CARE AND SUPPORT PROVIDED. GRANT FUNDS ACQUIRED DURING 2016 WERE UTILIZED TO SUPPORT PREVENTION AND HEALTH PROMOTION PROGRAMS AND SUPPORT SERVICES FOR THE COMMUNITY."

201723179349303037,141338428,"PART II, COMMUNITY BUILDING ACTIVITIES:","ELLIS HOSPITAL'S COMMUNITY-BUILDING ACTIVITIES PROMOTE THE HEALTH OF THE COMMUNITY IT SERVES. ELLIS SUCCESSFULLY RESTRUCTURED HEALTHCARE SERVICES FOLLOWING THE NEW YORK STATE-MANDATED HOSPITAL CONSOLIDATION IN SCHENECTADY IN 2007-2008, AND HAS SINCE BEEN WORKING TO IMPROVE THE EFFICIENCY AND EFFECTIVENESS OF SERVICES TO ITS COMMUNITY BY ALIGNING ITS INNOVATIVE APPROACHES TO COMMUNITY HEALTH WITH THE SERVICES PROVIDED BY OTHER LOCAL COMMUNITY-BASED PUBLIC AND NOT-FOR-PROFIT ORGANIZATIONS. ELLIS IS NOW THE SOLE ACUTE CARE HOSPITAL IN SCHENECTADY COUNTY, AND IS ONE OF THE LARGEST PRIMARY CARE PROVIDERS, HAVING ASSUMED RESPONSIBILITY FOR THE SERVICES OF TWO FORMER HOSPITALS WHICH CLOSED DURING THE STATE'S ""RIGHTSIZING"" PROCESS. IN THIS IMPORTANT ROLE, ELLIS HAS ENGAGED THE COMMUNITY AND DEVELOPED COALITIONS WITH COMMUNITY PARTNERS IN ORDER TO ENSURE ACCESS TO A FULL RANGE OF HEALTHCARE SERVICES, WITH SPECIAL ATTENTION PAID TO DISADVANTAGED MEMBERS OF OUR COMMUNITY. ELLIS HAS UNDERTAKEN A NUMBER OF SIGNIFICANT CAPITAL PROJECTS TO CONSOLIDATE CARE, ENHANCE ACCESS TO CARE, AND IMPROVE THE OVERALL QUALITY, EFFICIENCY, AND COST-EFFECTIVENESS OF OUR LOCAL HEALTHCARE SYSTEM. ONE OF ELLIS MEDICINE'S KEY COMMUNITY BUILDING ACTIVITIES DURING 2016 WAS ""CARE CENTRAL,"" A COMMUNITY-FOCUSED, MULTI-PARTNER, CARE MANAGEMENT PROGRAM DERIVED FROM ELLIS ORIGINAL ""MEDICAL HOME"" INITIATIVE LOCATED AT THE ELLIS MCCLELLAN STREET HEALTH CENTER. THIS IS A CENTRAL LOCATION FOR PRIMARY CARE AND OUTPATIENT SERVICES ON A SINGLE CAMPUS AIMED AT IMPROVING ACCESS TO HEALTHCARE, ESPECIALLY AMONG THE UNINSURED AND UNDERINSURED. THE ELLIS MCCLELLAN STREET HEALTH CENTER OFFERS PRIMARY MEDICAL CARE (ADULT AND PEDIATRIC), DENTAL CARE (ALSO ADULT AND PEDIATRIC), OUTPATIENT CHILD/ADOLESCENT MENTAL HEALTH SERVICES, DIABETES EDUCATION, AND (UNTIL LATE 2014) EMERGENCY SERVICES, ALONG WITH A NUMBER OF OUTPATIENT SERVICES SUCH AS MEDICAL IMAGING, LABORATORY, A SLEEP DISORDERS CENTER, WOUND CARE, AND DAY SURGERY. THE MEDICAL HOME FEATURED SPECIALLY TRAINED HEALTH SERVICES NAVIGATORS AND A COMMUNITY SERVICES NAVIGATOR, A COUNSELOR EMPLOYED BY THE LOCAL COMMUNITY ACTION AGENCY, WHO HELP PATIENTS CONNECT TO THE HEALTHCARE AND SOCIAL SERVICES PROGRAMS THEY NEED, INCLUDING MEDICAID AND SUBSIDIZED HEALTH INSURANCE CERTIFIED APPLICATION COUNSELORS, AND A FREE COMMUNITY SHUTTLE WHICH PROVIDES TRANSPORTATION FROM A NUMBER OF COMMUNITY SITES INCLUDING HOMELESS SHELTERS AND SOUP KITCHENS TO THE HEALTHCARE CAMPUS. CARE CENTRAL CONTINUES MEDICAL HOME SERVICES THROUGH AN EFFECTIVE PARTNERSHIP AMONG ELLIS MEDICINE AND NUMEROUS COMMUNITY GROUPS, INCLUDING THE SCHENECTADY COMMUNITY ACTION PROGRAM, THE SALVATION ARMY, THE CITY MISSION, YWCA, YMCA, SCHENECTADY CITY SCHOOL DISTRICT, AND SCHENECTADY COUNTY PUBLIC HEALTH SERVICES, AMONG OTHER SOCIAL SERVICE AND COMMUNITY AGENCIES.THE SUCCESS OF THE MEDICAL HOME IN BUILDING COMMUNITY COALITIONS HELPED LEAD TO A SUCCESSFUL APPLICATION BY A COMMUNITY PARTNERSHIP FOR DESIGNATION BY THE NEW YORK STATE DEPARTMENT OF HEALTH AS ONE OF THE FIRST THREE UPSTATE MEDICAID HEALTH HOMES. THE HEALTH HOME PROGRAM, WHICH WAS ESTABLISHED BY THE PATIENT PROTECTION AND AFFORDABLE CARE ACT (PPACA) OF 2010 AND CONFORMING STATE LAW, IS INTENDED TO PROVIDE A COMPREHENSIVE ARRAY OF HEALTHCARE AND COMMUNITY SUPPORT SERVICES TO MEDICAID PATIENTS WITH DESIGNATED HIGH-COST CONDITIONS. NEW YORK STATE HAS CHOSEN TO INITIALLY FOCUS ON PATIENTS WITH MULTIPLE CHRONIC CONDITIONS, BEHAVIORAL HEALTH ISSUES, AND/OR HIV/AIDS. A COALITION OF OVER 40 HEALTHCARE AND COMMUNITY AGENCIES LED BY ELLIS, THE VISITING NURSE SERVICE OF SCHENECTADY AND SARATOGA COUNTIES, INC., AND HOMETOWN HEALTH (THE SCHENECTADY FQHC) NOW PROVIDES COMPREHENSIVE CARE MANAGEMENT SERVICES TO HIGH RISK MEDICAID PATIENTS IN SCHENECTADY COUNTY.A THIRD COMPONENT OF ""CARE CENTRAL"" WAS A MEDICARE COMMUNITY-BASED CARE TRANSITIONS PROGRAM (CCTP) WHICH SERVED PATIENTS DISCHARGED FROM TEN DIFFERENT HOSPITALS IN A TEN-COUNTY REGION COVERING 20% OF THE GEOGRAPHY OF THE STATE OF NEW YORK. ALTHOUGH THE CCTP WAS HIGHLY SUCCESSFUL IN REDUCING READMISSIONS AMONG THE PATIENTS IT SERVED, IT DID NOT ACHIEVE THE PATIENT VOLUME REQUIRED BY CMS, AND THE CONTRACT WITH VNS WAS NOT RENEWED BY CMS IN 2014. CARE CENTRAL AND ITS REGIONAL PARTNERS CONTINUED TO DELIVER CCTP-LIKE SERVICES TO PATIENTS INSURED BY A REGIONAL NOT-FOR-PROFIT MANAGED CARE ORGANIZATION. A DSRIP ""CARE TRANSITIONS"" PROJECT SUSTAINS FUNDING FOR CERTAIN PATIENTS STARTING IN 2016.ANOTHER EXAMPLE OF ELLIS' COALITION BUILDING ACTIVITIES IS ITS PARTICIPATION IN THE SCHENECTADY COUNTY PUBLIC HEALTH SERVICES' FEDERALLY FUNDED STRATEGIC ALLIANCE FOR HEALTH (SAH), WHICH BRINGS TOGETHER A HOST OF HEALTHCARE AND COMMUNITY ORGANIZATIONS TO ADDRESS CHRONIC DISEASE AND TO PROMOTE DISEASE PREVENTION AND WELLNESS. AN ELLIS REPRESENTATIVE PARTICIPATES IN REGULAR MEETINGS OF THE SAH BOARD. ELLIS ALSO WORKS CLOSELY WITH THE SCHENECTADY COUNTY PUBLIC HEALTH SERVICES AND THE HEALTHY CAPITAL DISTRICT INITIATIVE (HCDI) TO ASSESS COMMUNITY NEEDS AND TO DEVELOP BOTH THE FEDERALLY-REQUIRED COMMUNITY HEALTH NEEDS ASSESSMENT AND THE STATE-REQUIRED COMMUNITY SERVICE PLAN (CSP) TO IDENTIFY HEALTH PRIORITIES.ADDITIONALLY, ELLIS PARTNERS WITH A NUMBER OF COMMUNITY PARTNERS, SUCH AS THE AMERICAN CANCER SOCIETY AND THE YWCA, TO PROVIDE HEALTH SCREENINGS TO UNINSURED AND UNDERINSURED POPULATIONS IN OUR SERVICE AREA. ELLIS HAS PROVIDED OFFICE SPACE AND OTHER IN-KIND SUPPORT FOR THE STATE-SPONSORED SCHENECTADY COUNTY CANCER SERVICES PROGRAM. IN COLLABORATION WITH COMMUNITY PARTNERS, ELLIS OFFERS OUTPATIENT SMOKING CESSATION COURSES AND SPONSORS PEER-DRIVEN MENTAL HEALTH AND CANCER PATIENT SUPPORT GROUPS. AND, ELLIS COOPERATES WITH COMMUNITY GROUPS TO FACILITATE ACCESS TO HEALTHY FOODS FOR PEOPLE THROUGH THE COMMUNITY. IN PAST YEARS, ACTING IN COLLABORATION WITH THE SCHENECTADY COUNTY PLANNING DEPARTMENT AND THE COOPERATIVE EXTENSION, ELLIS HOSTED A WEEKLY FARMERS' MARKET IN THE PARKING LOT OF THE ELLIS HEALTH CENTER DURING THE SUMMER MONTHS. IN 2013 AND 2014, PHYSICIANS AT THE FAMILY HEALTH CENTER BEGAN ""PRESCRIBING"" FRESH VEGETABLES TO AT-RISK PATIENTS AS PART OF A FOUNDATION-FUNDED GRANT PROGRAM. THE ""PRESCRIPTION"" CONSTITUTES A VOUCHER FOR NO-CHARGE LOCALLY-GROWN VEGETABLES WHICH ARE DISTRIBUTED AT A ""FARM STAND"" LOCATED AT THE ELLIS MCCLELLAN STREET HEALTH CENTER. IN ADDITION, ELLIS OFFERS USE OF THE PARKING LOT AT THE MCCLELLAN STREET HEALTH CENTER TO THE SCHENECTADY INNER CITY MINISTRY (SICM) MOBILE MEALS TRUCK WHICH PROVIDES FREE BREAKFASTS AND LUNCHES FOR CHILDREN AGE 18 OR UNDER DURING THE SUMMER WHEN SCHOOLS ARE CLOSED. AS OF 2016, 100% OF CHILDREN ATTENDING THE SCHENECTADY CITY SCHOOL DISTRICT (SCSD) SCHOOLS ARE ELIGIBLE FOR FREE SCHOOL LUNCHES.MEDICAL RESIDENTS FROM THE ELLIS FAMILY MEDICINE RESIDENCY DONATE THEIR TIME AND EXPERTISE TO STAFF FREE COMMUNITY-BASED MEDICAL CLINICS. A WEEKLY CLINIC AT THE SCHENECTADY CITY MISSION SERVES UNINSURED, HOMELESS INDIVIDUALS IN THE CITY OF SCHENECTADY. ELLIS STAFFS A GREEN TEAM THAT WORKS TO PROMOTE RECYCLING AND OTHER ECO-FRIENDLY PRACTICES THROUGHOUT THE ORGANIZATION. ELLIS STAFF MEMBERS ALSO SIT ON NUMEROUS COMMUNITY BOARDS AND HEALTHCARE COALITIONS TO TARGET IMPROVEMENTS IN SUCH AREAS AS DIABETES, LONG TERM CARE, CANCER, HOSPITAL READMISSION RATES, WORKFORCE DEVELOPMENT, AND HEALTHY LIVING."

THE ADJUSTED PATIENT CARE COST IS DIVIDED BY ADJUSTED PATIENT CARE CHARGES RESULTING IN THE RATIO.ELLIS BELIEVES THAT THE MEDICARE SHORTFALL REPORTED ON PART III LINE 7 SHOULD BE TREATED AS A COMMUNITY BENEFIT. FIRST, ELLIS IS THE ONLY ACUTE CARE GENERAL HOSPITAL IN SCHENECTADY, AND THUS PROVIDES VITAL HEALTH CARE SERVICES FOR MEDICARE BENEFICIARIES WHICH WOULD OTHERWISE BE UNAVAILABLE IN THE COMMUNITY. SECOND, THE INCOME LEVEL AND EMPLOYMENT RATE IN THE COMMUNITY DEMONSTRATE THE CHALLENGES WHICH WOULD BE FACED IF ELLIS WERE NOT ABLE TO PROVIDE CARE TO ALL PATIENTS, REGARDLESS OF ABILITY TO PAY. THE MEDIAN HOUSEHOLD INCOME IN THE CITY OF SCHENECTADY IS 34% BELOW THE STATEWIDE COMPARISON, AND THE UNEMPLOYMENT RATE IS 35% ABOVE THE STATE RATE (2010-2014 AMERICAN COMMUNITY SURVEY). THIRD, MEDICARE BENEFICIARIES ARE AMONG THOSE AFFECTED BY INCOME DISPARITIES WITHIN SCHENECTADY. NEARLY HALF (46%) OF THE RESIDENTS OF THE LARGELY MINORITY (67% NON-WHITE) HAMILTON HILL NEIGHBORHOOD ARE BELOW THE FEDERAL POVERTY LEVEL; 7.8% OF THESE RESIDENTS ARE 65 YEARS OF AGE OR OLDER (2009-2013 AMERICAN COMMUNITY SURVEY). RESIDENTS OF THIS NEIGHBORHOOD ARE AMONG THE HEAVIEST USERS OF HOSPITAL SERVICES; FOR EXAMPLE, THE RATE OF EMERGENCY DEPARTMENT UTILIZATION FOR FALLS AMONG PERSONS 65 AND OLDER IN HAMILTON HILL IS 52% ABOVE THE STATEWIDE AVERAGE (2010-2014 SPARCS). FINALLY, 25% OF ELLIS' MEDICARE DISCHARGES IN 2016 WERE DUAL-ELIGIBLES (ENROLLED IN BOTH MEDICARE AND MEDICAID) WHO, BY VIRTUE OF THEIR MEDICAID ELIGIBILITY, ARE LOW-INCOME INDIVIDUALS. HENCE, THE FINANCIAL LOSSES INCURRED IN TREATING MEDICARE PATIENTS DETRACT FROM THE ABILITY OF THE HOSPITAL TO SERVE OTHER LOW-INCOME PATIENTS AND RESIDENTS, AND THE ABILITY OF THE HOSPITAL TO FUNCTION IN SPITE OF THESE LOSSES REPRESENTS A COMMUNITY BENEFIT."

TWO ADDITIONAL COMPREHENSIVE ASSESSMENT DOCUMENTS HAVE BEEN PRODUCED FOR THE SCHENECTADY COMMUNITY IN RECENT YEARS:1) IN 2014, AS PART OF THE STATE-REQUIRED DELIVERY SYSTEM REFORM INCENTIVE PAYMENT PROGRAM (DSRIP), ELLIS AND OTHER HOSPITALS IN NEW YORK'S CAPITAL REGION ENGAGED HCDI TO PRODUCE A COMMUNITY HEALTH NEEDS ASSESSMENT FOCUSED SPECIFICALLY ON THE NEEDS OF MEDICAID BENEFICIARIES WHICH WERE TO BE SERVED BY THE DSRIP PROGRAM.

THESE SITES ARE THE DENTAL HEALTH CENTER AND THE OUTPATIENT MENTAL HEALTH CLINIC.ADDITIONALLY, ELLIS OFFERS ITS FINANCIAL ADVOCATES INFORMATION LINE (518-243-3460) THROUGH WHICH PATIENTS WITHOUT INSURANCE CAN RECEIVE INFORMATION ABOUT HOW MUCH THEIR CARE WILL COST AT ELLIS MEDICINE, INCLUDING INSURANCE ENROLLMENT AND PAYMENT DISCOUNTS. ANOTHER TELEPHONE RESOURCE (518-243-1695) PROVIDES CALLERS WITH ESTIMATES OF THE TOTAL COST OF PROCEDURES AND HOSPITALIZATIONS, AS MORE AND MORE PATIENTS ARE PAYING HIGHER DEDUCTIBLES AND ARE CONCERNED ABOUT THE COST TO THEM OUT-OF-POCKET.

201723179349303037,141338428,"PART VI, LINE 4:","FOR THE PURPOSES OF DETERMINING COMMUNITY NEEDS PURSUANT TO THE REQUIREMENTS OF THE PATIENT PROTECTION AND AFFORDABLE CARE ACT OF 2010, ELLIS HOSPITAL DEFINES THE ""COMMUNITY"" IT SERVES AS CONSISTING OF SCHENECTADY COUNTY, INCLUDING THE CITY OF SCHENECTADY AND THE TOWNS OF DUANESBURG, GLENVILLE, PRINCETOWN, NISKAYUNA, AND ROTTERDAM. THERE ARE SEVERAL REASONS FOR THIS DEFINITION:1) THE GEOGRAPHY OF SCHENECTADY COUNTY IS VERY SIMILAR TO THE PRIMARY SERVICE AREA (PSA) OF THE HOSPITAL. ELLIS USES AN INDUSTRY-STANDARD DEFINITION (THE CONTIGUOUS ZIP CODES IN WHICH THE FIRST 60% OF THE HOSPITAL'S INPATIENTS LIVE) TO DETERMINE ITS PSA. ELLIS' PSA CONSISTS OF THE ENTIRE RANGE OF 123NN ZIP CODES (12302, 12303, 12304, 12305, 12306, 12307, 12308, AND 12309), WHICH CONSTITUTES ALL OF THE CITY OF SCHENECTADY AND MOST OF THE POPULATION OF THE REST OF SCHENECTADY COUNTY. (THE DESIGN OF THE ZIP CODE SYSTEM IS NOT ALIGNED WITH COUNTY OR OTHER POLITICAL BOUNDARIES. THE RURAL WESTERNMOST PORTION OF SCHENECTADY COUNTY IS NOT INCLUDED IN THE ZIP CODE-DEFINED PSA DUE TO LOW POPULATION, WHILE CERTAIN AREAS OF ALBANY AND SARATOGA COUNTIES DO FALL WITHIN THE SCHENECTADY ZIP CODES.) ALTHOUGH ELLIS ACTIVELY SERVES PEOPLE WITHIN ITS SECONDARY SERVICE AREA (SSA), THE GEOGRAPHIC BOUNDARIES OF THOSE ADDITIONAL ZIP CODES (THE ADDITIONAL CONTIGUOUS ZIP CODES IN WHICH THE NEXT 20% OF INPATIENTS LIVE, FOR AN APPROXIMATE TOTAL OF 80% OF INPATIENT VOLUME) STRETCH ACROSS FIVE COUNTIES AND INCLUDE PORTIONS OF THE SERVICE AREAS OF AT LEAST SIX OTHER HOSPITALS. RETAINING A FOCUS ON THE SCHENECTADY COMMUNITY WILL PERMIT DEVELOPMENT OF AN ACTIONABLE IMPLEMENTATION PLAN WHICH CAN TARGET COHESIVE POPULATIONS.2) POPULATION AND HEALTH DATA ARE COMMONLY AVAILABLE BY COUNTY. THE NEW YORK STATE DEPARTMENT OF HEALTH AND OTHER STATE GOVERNMENT AGENCIES MAINTAIN DATA BY COUNTY, THE HEALTHY CAPITAL DISTRICT INITIATIVE PROVIDES COMPARISON DATA BY COUNTY WITHIN THE REGION, AND DATA COLLECTED BY THE UNITED STATES CENSUS ARE FREQUENTLY AT THE COUNTY AND CITY LEVEL. ALTHOUGH CONVENIENCE IS NOT IN AND OF ITSELF A REASON TO DEFINE ""COMMUNITY,"" THE AVAILABILITY OF SOLID DATA, INCLUDING BASELINE AND COMPARISON DATA, WILL PROVIDE A BETTER BASIS FOR PLANNING, AND AN EXTERNALLY-VERIFIABLE SOURCE FOR OUTCOME MEASURES.3) ELLIS HAS ESTABLISHED STRONG PARTNERSHIPS WITH OTHER HEALTHCARE AND COMMUNITY SERVICE ORGANIZATIONS WHICH ARE LOCATED IN AND SERVE SCHENECTADY COUNTY. THE ""MEDICAL HOME GROUP,"" A LOOSE AFFILIATION OF COMMUNITY ORGANIZATIONS CREATED AT THE TIME OF THE THREE-HOSPITAL CONSOLIDATION IN 2008, HAS EVOLVED INTO THE SCHENECTADY COALITION FOR A HEALTHY COMMUNITY; OVER 60 COMMUNITY GROUPS INCLUDING BUSINESSES, LOCAL GOVERNMENT AGENCIES, HEALTHCARE AND SOCIAL SERVICES PROVIDERS AND COMMUNITY AGENCIES, FAITH-BASED ORGANIZATIONS, AND ADVOCACY GROUPS WHOSE LEADERS MEET QUARTERLY AT ELLIS. BY FOCUSING ""COMMUNITY"" ON A POPULATION WELL-SERVED BY A COORDINATED ARRAY OF PHYSICAL HEALTH, BEHAVIORAL HEALTH, AND COMMUNITY SERVICE ORGANIZATIONS IN COORDINATION WITH STRONG LOCAL GOVERNMENT AGENCIES, A COMMUNITY-WIDE ACTION PLAN CAN LEVERAGE THE HOSPITAL'S IMPLEMENTATION PLAN THROUGH THE EFFICIENT AND EFFECTIVE USE OF MULTIPLE RESOURCES.4) SELECTION OF SCHENECTADY COUNTY AS THE ""COMMUNITY"" IS CONSISTENT WITH REGULATORY REQUIREMENTS TO ASSURE INCLUSION OF ""MEDICALLY UNDERSERVED, LOW-INCOME, OR MINORITY POPULATIONS,"" AS THESE POPULATIONS REPRESENT A GREATER SHARE OF THE POPULATION IN SCHENECTADY COUNTY THAN THEY WOULD IF DIFFUSED AMONG THE FIVE COUNTIES OF THE SECONDARY SERVICE AREA.SCHENECTADY COUNTY (2015 POPULATION: 154,604) IS, GEOGRAPHICALLY, THE SECOND SMALLEST COUNTY IN UPSTATE NEW YORK. IT CONSISTS OF FIVE TOWNS, TWO PRIMARILY RURAL AND THREE PRIMARILY SUBURBAN, SURROUNDING THE CENTRALLY-LOCATED CITY OF SCHENECTADY (2015 POPULATION: 65,305). THE COUNTY IS LOCATED IMMEDIATELY WEST OF THE STATE CAPITAL OF ALBANY AND MANY OF ITS RESIDENTS COMMUTE TO JOBS IN ALBANY AND THE OTHER COUNTIES COMPRISING NEW YORK'S CAPITAL REGION.SCHENECTADY COUNTY PUBLIC HEALTH SERVICES (SCPHS), A UNIT OF COUNTY GOVERNMENT, IS RESPONSIBLE FOR ALL PUBLIC HEALTH AND ENVIRONMENTAL HEALTH ACTIVITIES AND ENFORCEMENT THROUGHOUT THE CITY AND COUNTY. THE COUNTY CONTAINS A SINGLE NON-PROFIT ACUTE CARE HOSPITAL - ELLIS HOSPITAL (ALSO KNOWN BY THE TRADE NAME ELLIS MEDICINE), AND A SINGLE FEDERALLY QUALIFIED HEALTH CENTER (FQHC) - HOMETOWN HEALTH CENTER. THERE IS ALSO A NON-PROFIT SPECIALTY HOSPITAL (SUNNYVIEW REHABILITATION HOSPITAL) WHICH IS A MEMBER OF THE ALBANY-BASED ST. PETER'S HEALTH PARTNERS SYSTEM. THERE IS ONE MEDICALLY UNDERSERVED POPULATION; THE HOMEBOUND POPULATION OF SCHENECTADY COUNTY (ID #06211). THE ENTIRE CITY OF SCHENECTADY IS DESIGNATED A HEALTH PROFESSIONS SHORTAGE AREA (HPSA) FOR THE MEDICAID POPULATION FOR MENTAL HEALTH AND DENTAL HEALTH. IN ADDITION, EIGHT CENSUS TRACTS IN THE HAMILTON HILL/MONT PLEASANT NEIGHBORHOODS, WHICH ARE IMMEDIATELY ADJACENT TO THE ELLIS MCCLELLAN STREET HEALTH CENTER, ARE DESIGNATED HEALTH PROFESSIONS SHORTAGE AREAS FOR THE MEDICAID POPULATION FOR PRIMARY CARE. HOMETOWN HEALTH CENTER, THE ELLIS DENTAL HEALTH CENTER, AND THE ELLIS OUTPATIENT MENTAL HEALTH CLINIC HAVE BEEN DESIGNATED BY HRSA AS NATIONAL HEALTH SERVICE CORPS PRACTICE SITES. SCHENECTADY COUNTY IS DIRECTLY SERVED BY ONE DSRIP PERFORMING PROVIDER SYSTEM (PPS), THE ALLIANCE FOR BETTER HEALTH CARE (AFBHC), AND IS ADJACENT TO THE SERVICE AREA OF THE ALBANY MEDICAL CENTER PPS.RESIDENTS OF THE CITY OF SCHENECTADY ARE GENERALLY LESS AFFLUENT AND LESS HEALTHY THAN RESIDENTS OF THE SURROUNDING TOWNS, WHILE RESIDENTS OF THE COUNTY AS A WHOLE ARE LESS AFFLUENT THAN THE STATE AS A WHOLE, HOWEVER THE COUNTY'S POVERTY RATE IS BELOW THAT OF THE STATE (SEE FIGURE 1). FOR EXAMPLE, THE MEDIAN HOUSEHOLD INCOME FOR THE CITY, AT $38,916, IS ONLY ABOUT TWO-THIRDS THAT OF THE COUNTY AS A WHOLE ($57,025), WHICH IS BELOW THAT OF THE STATE ($58,687). THE POVERTY RATE IN THE CITY (23.8%) IS NEARLY DOUBLE THAT OF THE COUNTY AS A WHOLE (13.2%). STATE HEALTH DEPARTMENT DATA (2008-09) SHOW THAT HOSPITALIZATIONS FOR CONDITIONS WHICH COULD HAVE BEEN TREATED IN THE COMMUNITY (""PREVENTION QUALITY INDICATORS"") RANGE AS HIGH AS 202% OF THE EXPECTED RATE IN CERTAIN CITY NEIGHBORHOODS, BUT ARE AS LOW AS 49% OF THE EXPECTED RATE IN THE RURAL TOWNS. IN ONE DRAMATIC DISPARITY, HOSPITALIZATIONS FOR CONDITIONS RELATED TO DIABETES RANGE FROM 604/100,000 IN THE CITY'S HAMILTON HILL NEIGHBORHOOD (12307) TO 62/100,000 IN THE NEARBY SUBURB OF NISKAYUNA (12309).A SIGNIFICANT MINORITY POPULATION IN THE CITY OF SCHENECTADY IS COMPRISED OF GUYANESE OF WEST INDIAN DESCENT. THE RESULT OF SECONDARY MIGRATION FROM NEW YORK CITY PROMOTED BY A PREVIOUS MAYOR ALONG WITH PRIMARY MIGRATION FROM GUYANA, THE INFLUX IS CREDITED WITH REVERSING YEARS OF POPULATION DECLINE IN THE CITY. SCHENECTADY COUNTY PUBLIC HEALTH SERVICES LED MULTIPLE INITIATIVES TO IDENTIFY AND ADDRESS HEALTH DISPARITIES RELATING TO THE WEST INDIAN POPULATION. RESEARCH CONDUCTED BY PHYSICIANS AT ELLIS MEDICINE REVEALED SPECIFIC HEALTH ISSUES REGARDING THE WEST INDIAN POPULATION. IN PARTICULAR, THE UNEXPECTED PREVALENCE OF DIABETES AMONG NON-OBESE GUYANESE MALES IS THE SUBJECT OF JOURNAL ARTICLES (SEE FOR EXAMPLE: HOSLER, PRATT, SEN, BUCKENMEYER, SIMAO, BACK, SAVADATTI, KAHN, HUNT, ""HIGH PREVALENCE OF DIABETES AMONG INDO-GUYANESE ADULTS, SCHENECTADY, NEW YORK,"" PREVENTING CHRONIC DISEASE 2013; 10:120211) AND HELPED LEAD TO AWARDING OF A FEDERAL RACIAL AND ETHNIC APPROACHES TO COMMUNITY HEALTH (REACH) GRANT TO SCPHS IN 2010. THE INITIAL PLANNING STAGE OF THE REACH GRANT FUNDED AN EXTENSIVE COMMUNITY SURVEY OF DIABETES PREVALENCE, PILOT TRAINING OF A DOZEN INDIGENOUS DIABETES HEALTH PROMOTERS, AN ELEMENTARY SCHOOL DIABETES PREVENTION EDUCATION PROGRAM, AND A DIABETES HEALTH SCREENING PROGRAM FOR AT-RISK WEST INDIAN RESIDENTS. THE WEST INDIAN DIABETES ACTION COALITION UTILIZED A MAPP PROCESS TO DEVELOP A COMMUNITY ACTION PLAN (CAP). UNFORTUNATELY, SHIFTING PRIORITIES AT THE CENTERS FOR DISEASE CONTROL (CDC) ENDED FUNDING FOR THE PROJECT BEFORE ITS IMPLEMENTATION PHASE. IN 2014, SCPHS WAS AWARDED A ""PARTNERSHIPS TO IMPROVE COMMUNITY HEALTH"" (PICH) GRANT, FUNDED BY THE CDC. ONE OF THE GOALS OF THIS GRANT IS TO INCREASE SCREENING RATES FOR TYPE-2 DIABETES IN THE WEST INDIAN POPULATION THAT ARE SEEN AT ELLIS FAMILY HEALTH CENTER, AN ELLIS MEDICINE PRIMARY CARE SITE.OVERALL, HOWEVER, SCHENECTADY COUNTY RESIDENTS ARE MORE LIKELY THAN THE AVERAGE NEW YORK STATE RESIDENT TO HAVE HEALTH INSURANCE (SEE FIGURE 2). THE VAST MAJORITY OF PRIMARY MEDICAL CARE AND DENTAL CARE FOR LOW-INCOME RESIDENTS IS PROVIDED BY THE HOMETOWN HEALTH FQHC AND THE COMMUNITY PRACTICES OF THE ELLIS MEDICAL GROUP. BOTH HAVE ACHIEVED RECOGNITION BY THE NATIONAL COMMITTEE FOR QUALITY ASSURANCE (NCQA) AS PATIENT-CENTERED MEDICAL HOMES (PCMH).SEE CONTINUATION ON SCHEDULE O."

201713199349317036,111631796,"Part III, Line 9b","POLICY AND PURPOSE: The purpose of the Collection Policy (Policy) is to promote patient access to quality health care while minimizing bad debt at NYP/BMH. This Policy places requirements upon Hospital and those agencies and attorneys undertaking debt collection activities that are consistent with the core mission, values, and principles of Hospital including, but not limited to, Hospitals Charity Care Policy. This policy applies to hospital and any agency, lawyer, or law firm assisting hospital in the collection of an outstanding patient account debt. PROCEDURE: A. General guidelines 1. Hospital, collection agencies (Agency), and lawyers and law firms (Outside Counsel) will comply with all applicable federal and state laws and accrediting agency requirements governing the collection of debts including, but not limited to, the Fair Debt Collection Practices Act (FDCPA), the Fair Credit Billing Act, the Consumer Credit Protection Acts, Public Health Law Section 2807-k-9-a, Internal Revenue Service Code 501(r), Article 52 of the New York Civil Practice Law and Rules, and the Health Insurance Portability and Accountability Act (HIPAA). Hospital, Agency and Outside Counsel will also comply with Hospitals Charity Care Policy. To the extent that there are any inconsistencies between Hospitals Collection Policy and Charity Care Policy, the Charity Care Policy shall supersede and control. 2. Hospital shall enter legally binding written agreements with any parties (including Agency or Outside Counsel) to which it refers an individuals debt related to care that are reasonably designed to prevent Extraordinary Collection Actions (ECAs) from being taken to obtain payment for the care, until reasonable efforts have been made to determine whether the individual is eligible for Charity Care."
201713199349317036,111631796,"Part VI, Line 2","Needs Assessment: Based on results from the Community Health Survey, discussions with key informants in the community, and review of New York States Prevention Area Priorities, NYP/BMH has selected the following prevention priorities: 1) Prevent Chronic Disease; focus on diabetes 2) Prevent Chronic Disease; focus on childhood obesity/ (overlaps with) Promote Healthy Women, Infants and Children; focus on maternal and infant health. 3) Promote a Healthy and Safe Environment; reducing fall risk among most vulnerable populations. The Brooklyn community helped to select the interventions via key informant meetings and a Community Health Survey which appeared on NewYork-Presbyterian/Brooklyn Methodist Hospitals website homepage, www.nym.org. The survey also appeared on NYP/BMHs social media channels and in the spring/summer 2016 edition of NYP/BMHs community health magazine, Thrive, which is mailed to 250,000 households in Brooklyn. In addition to the input sought from the community, the programs and strategies developed by NYP/BMH as part of its Community Service Plan will be targeted to at-risk populations as identified in the Hospital Community Health Needs Assessment. The interventions and strategies were determined by reviewing results from NYP/BMHs Community Health Survey, along with the input derived from key informant meetings. State, county and zip code level statistical data were also reviewed. Finally, recommendations from the New York State Prevention Agenda Dashboard 2013-2017 were taken into consideration. The goal of the intervention for the Prevent Chronic Disease; focus on diabetes is to increase access to high-quality chronic disease preventive care and management in clinical and community settings by offering diabetes self-management education (DSME) classes for community residents in both English and Spanish, and educating Hospital staff members to become trainers and lead additional DSMEs. NYP/BMH anticipates that those who attend classes will gain confidence and better control in the management of their diabetes. Once our own staff is trained to lead these Stanford-modeled classes, the Hospital will have the capability to offer additional classes and impact even more members of the community who are living with diabetes. The first intervention for the Prevent Chronic Disease; focus on childhood obesity priority, which also falls under the prevention area of Promoting Healthy Women Infants and Children, is to adopt policies and practices designed to implement standards that will support breastfeeding, quality nutrition, increased physical activity and reduced screen time in early child care settings and to increase staff training, community support and reinforcement of these regulations and policies. The Hospital has joined New York Citys Breastfeeding Hospital Collaborative (NYC BHC) Cohort 3. As is the case for hospitals in the current NYCBHC, Cohort 3 will include in-person learning sessions, monthly action period webinars, semi-monthly coaching calls (participation as needed), mock assessments and site visits, access to a repository of free tools and resources to support pursuit of a Baby Friendly designation, and more. A second intervention for the Prevent Chronic Disease, focus on childhood obesity priority is to create a program to help incorporate dance/exercise classes and nutrition education into the lives of pre-teens and their parents. Classes will be offered at the Brooklyn Childrens Museum in Crown Heights. NYP/BMH will use strategies derived from New York State Obesity Prevention Center for Excellence. The goal of the first intervention for Promote a Healthy and Safe Environment; reducing fall risk among most vulnerable populations priority is to improve the design and maintenance of home environments to promote health and reduce related illness, by creating a Fall Prevention Program and assembling Fall Prevention Kits, with tools to help seniors safeguard their homes. NYP/BMH will reference the CDCs Guide for EBPs to Prevent Falls. A second intervention is intended to reduce factors that increase the risk of falls, particularly among the elderly and young children by promoting community-based programs for fall prevention. NYP/BMH will reference the CDCs Guide for EBPs to Prevent Falls. The process measures used to track and evaluate the impact of the Prevent Chronic Disease; focus on diabetes priority include information retention quizzes, tracking attendance and attendee goal setting and monitoring achievements during and after each six-week Diabetes Self-Management Education session. The process measures used to track and evaluate the Prevent Chronic Disease; focus on childhood obesity priority include pre and post class surveys, weight and waist measurements recorded throughout the duration of classes, and attendance tracking. Results will be monitored during and after each dance/education series. The process measures used to track and evaluate the Promote a Healthy and Safe Environment; reducing fall risk among most vulnerable populations priority include polling senior citizens on regarding home safety measures in place and giving them kits to safeguard their homes. They will also be offered the opportunity to share stories on how theyve implemented the safety information that has been provided. To attempt a reduction in the number of admissions due to falls, the Hospital will administer surveys administered to treat and release patients who come to the Emergency Room for falls. Part VI, Line 3 Patient Education of eligibility for assistance: New York State Public Health Law (Section 2807-k-9-a) and the Internal Revenue Code (Section 501(r)) require hospitals to provide free or reduced price services for emergency or other medically necessary care to patients who are determined to be unable to pay for their care in whole or in part, based on their financial status. NYP/BMH recognizes its responsibility to provide charity care (hereafter Charity Care) for those who may be uninsured or underinsured, and have received emergency or other medically necessary services at NYP/BMH. Hospital is committed to the comprehensive assessment of individual patient need and to providing Charity Care when warranted, regardless of age, gender, race, national origin, socio-economic or immigrant status, sexual orientation or religious affiliation. Written materials, including the application, full Policy, and plain language summary (Summary), shall be available to patients in NYP/BMH's primary languages, upon request and without charge, from Admitting and Emergency Departments at NYP/BMH during the intake and registration process, at discharge and/or by mail. Additionally, those materials shall be available on NYP/BMH's website (www.nyp.org/brooklyn). Also, notification to patients regarding this Policy shall be made through conspicuous posting of language appropriate information in Emergency Rooms and Admitting Departments of NYP/BMH, and inclusion of information on bills and statements sent to patients explaining that financial aid may be available to qualified patients and how to obtain further information. Part VI, Line 4 Community Information: Although NYP/BMH is located in Park Slope and is an important healthcare, community service and economic anchor in the Park Slope neighborhood, it serves the entire borough of Brooklyn (Kings County). Brooklyn is the largest of the five boroughs that make up New York City. Indeed, if it were a separate city, Brooklyn would be the fourth largest in the United States. In 2014, Brooklyn had a total population of over 2.6 million people from a wide variety of ethnic and socioeconomic backgrounds. Of the total number of people in Brooklyn in 2014, 926,640 were white, 826,500 were black, 332,160 were Asian, Native American and Pacific Islanders and 526,110 were Latino. (Those reporting as Latino or Hispanic are of Spanish origin but may be of any race.) While the white and black populations have remained relatively stable, increasing only slightly as the Brooklyn population increased, the Latino population has increased by 13 percent (consistent with Brooklyns overall population increase) and the Asian, Native American and Pacific Island population has increased by 184 percent, far exceeding the overall Brooklyn increase. The demography of Brooklyn has changed radically since 1990, which is reflected in the ethnic breakdown of Hospital discharges over the past 25 years. At the turn of the 21st century, we were in a period of the largest influx of immigration to New York City since the early 1900s. According to the 2010 US census data, 37 percent of Brooklyns residents were born outside of the United States and 46 percent of the boroughs residents speak a language other than English in the home. What has made this wave of immigration to New York City especially unique is that the patterns of immigration are extremely diverse; of the various countries represented by Brooklyn re"

201743199349301474,210634484,"SCHEDULE H, PART III, SECTION B; QUESTION 8","MEDICARE COSTS WERE DERIVED FROM THE 2016 MEDICARE COST REPORT. MEDICARE UNDERPAYMENTS AND BAD DEBT ARE COMMUNITY BENEFIT AND ASSOCIATED COSTS ARE INCLUDABLE ON THE FORM 990, SCHEDULE H, PART I. THE ORGANIZATION FEELS THAT MEDICARE UNDERPAYMENTS (SHORTFALL), BAD DEBT AND ASSOCIATED COSTS ARE COMMUNITY BENEFIT AND ARE INCLUDABLE ON THE FORM 990, SCHEDULE H, PART I. AS OUTLINED MORE FULLY BELOW, THE ORGANIZATION BELIEVES THAT THESE SERVICES AND RELATED COSTS PROMOTE THE HEALTH OF THE COMMUNITY AS A WHOLE AND ARE RENDERED IN CONJUNCTION WITH THE ORGANIZATION'S CHARITABLE TAX-EXEMPT PURPOSES AND MISSION IN PROVIDING MEDICALLY NECESSARY HEALTHCARE SERVICES TO ALL INDIVIDUALS IN A NON-DISCRIMINATORY MANNER WITHOUT REGARD TO RACE, COLOR, CREED, SEX, NATIONAL ORIGIN OR ABILITY TO PAY AND CONSISTENT WITH THE COMMUNITY BENEFIT STANDARD PROMULGATED BY THE IRS. THE COMMUNITY BENEFIT STANDARD IS THE CURRENT STANDARD FOR A HOSPITAL FOR RECOGNITION AS A TAX-EXEMPT AND CHARITABLE ORGANIZATION UNDER INTERNAL REVENUE CODE (""IRC"") 501(C)(3). THE ORGANIZATION IS RECOGNIZED AS A TAX-EXEMPT ENTITY AND CHARITABLE ORGANIZATION UNDER 501(C)(3) OF THE IRC. ALTHOUGH THERE IS NO DEFINITION IN THE TAX CODE FOR THE TERM ""CHARITABLE"" A REGULATION PROMULGATED BY THE DEPARTMENT OF THE TREASURY PROVIDES SOME GUIDANCE AND STATES THAT ""THE TERM CHARITABLE IS USED IN SECTION 501(C)(3) IN ITS GENERALLY ACCEPTED LEGAL SENSE,PROVIDES EXAMPLES OF CHARITABLE PURPOSES, INCLUDING THE RELIEF OF THE POOR OR UNPRIVILEGED; THE PROMOTION OF SOCIAL WELFARE; AND THE ADVANCEMENT OF EDUCATION, RELIGION, AND SCIENCE. NOTE IT DOES NOT EXPLICITLY ADDRESS THE ACTIVITIES OF HOSPITALS. IN THE ABSENCE OF EXPLICIT STATUTORY OR REGULATORY REQUIREMENTS APPLYING THE TERM ""CHARITABLE"" TO HOSPITALS, IT HAS BEEN LEFT TO THE IRS TO DETERMINE THE CRITERIA HOSPITALS MUST MEET TO QUALIFY AS IRC 501(C)(3) CHARITABLE ORGANIZATIONS. THE ORIGINAL STANDARD WAS KNOWN AS THE CHARITY CARE STANDARD. THIS STANDARD WAS REPLACED BY THE IRS WITH THE COMMUNITY BENEFIT STANDARD WHICH IS THE CURRENT STANDARD. CHARITY CARE STANDARD IN 1956, THE IRS ISSUED REVENUE RULING 56-185, WHICH ADDRESSED THE REQUIREMENTS HOSPITALS NEEDED TO MEET IN ORDER TO QUALIFY FOR IRC 501(C)(3) STATUS. ONE OF THESE REQUIREMENTS IS KNOWN AS THE ""CHARITY CARE STANDARD."" UNDER THE STANDARD, A HOSPITAL MUST PROVIDE, TO THE EXTENT OF ITS FINANCIAL ABILITY, FREE OR REDUCED-COST CARE TO PATIENTS WHO CANNOT PAY FOR SUCH SERVICES. A HOSPITAL THAT EXPECTED FULL PAYMENT DID NOT, ACCORDING TO THE RULING, PROVIDE CHARITY CARE BASED ON THE FACT THAT SOME PATIENTS ULTIMATELY FAILED TO PAY. THE RULING EMPHASIZED THAT A LOW LEVEL OF CHARITY CARE DID NOT NECESSARILY MEAN THAT A HOSPITAL HAD FAILED TO MEET THE REQUIREMENT SINCE THAT LEVEL COULD REFLECT ITS FINANCIAL ABILITY TO PROVIDE SUCH CARE. THE RULING ALSO NOTED THAT PUBLICLY SUPPORTED COMMUNITY HOSPITALS WOULD NORMALLY QUALIFY AS CHARITABLE ORGANIZATIONS BECAUSE THEY SERVE THE ENTIRE COMMUNITY AND A LOW LEVEL OF CHARITY CARE WOULD NOT AFFECT A HOSPITAL'S EXEMPT STATUS IF IT WAS DUE TO THE SURROUNDING COMMUNITY'S LACK OF CHARITABLE DEMANDS. COMMUNITY BENEFIT STANDARD IN 1969, THE IRS ISSUED REVENUE RULING 69-545, WHICH ""REMOVED"" FROM REVENUE RULING 56-185 ""THE REQUIREMENTS RELATING TO CARING FOR PATIENTS WITHOUT CHARGE OR AT RATES BELOW COST."" UNDER THE STANDARD DEVELOPED IN REVENUE RULING 69-545, WHICH IS KNOWN AS THE ""COMMUNITY BENEFIT STANDARD,"" HOSPITALS ARE JUDGED ON WHETHER THEY PROMOTE THE HEALTH OF A BROAD CLASS OF INDIVIDUALS IN THE COMMUNITY. THE RULING INVOLVED A HOSPITAL THAT ONLY ADMITTED INDIVIDUALS WHO COULD PAY FOR THE SERVICES (BY THEMSELVES, PRIVATE INSURANCE, OR PUBLIC PROGRAMS SUCH AS MEDICARE), BUT OPERATED A FULL-TIME EMERGENCY ROOM THAT WAS OPEN TO EVERYONE. THE IRS RULED THAT THE HOSPITAL QUALIFIED AS A CHARITABLE ORGANIZATION BECAUSE IT PROMOTED THE HEALTH OF PEOPLE IN ITS COMMUNITY. THE IRS REASONED THAT BECAUSE THE PROMOTION OF HEALTH WAS A CHARITABLE PURPOSE ACCORDING TO THE GENERAL LAW OF CHARITY, IT FELL WITHIN THE ""GENERALLY ACCEPTED LEGAL SENSE"" OF THE TERM ""CHARITABLE,"" AS REQUIRED BY THE DEPARTMENT OF TREASURY REG. 1.501(C)(3)-1(D)(2). THE IRS RULING STATED THAT THE PROMOTION OF HEALTH, LIKE THE RELIEF OF POVERTY AND THE ADVANCEMENT OF EDUCATION AND RELIGION, IS ONE OF THE PURPOSES IN THE GENERAL LAW OF CHARITY THAT IS DEEMED BENEFICIAL TO THE COMMUNITY AS A WHOLE EVEN THOUGH THE CLASS OF BENEFICIARIES ELIGIBLE TO RECEIVE A DIRECT BENEFIT FROM ITS ACTIVITIES DOES NOT INCLUDE ALL MEMBERS OF THE COMMUNITY, SUCH AS INDIGENT MEMBERS OF THE COMMUNITY, PROVIDED THAT THE CLASS IS NOT SO SMALL THAT ITS RELIEF IS NOT OF BENEFIT TO THE COMMUNITY. THE IRS CONCLUDED THAT THE HOSPITAL WAS ""PROMOTING THE HEALTH OF A CLASS OF PERSONS THAT IS BROAD ENOUGH TO BENEFIT THE COMMUNITY"" BECAUSE ITS EMERGENCY ROOM WAS OPEN TO ALL AND IT PROVIDED CARE TO EVERYONE WHO COULD PAY, WHETHER DIRECTLY OR THROUGH THIRD-PARTY REIMBURSEMENT. OTHER CHARACTERISTICS OF THE HOSPITAL THAT THE IRS HIGHLIGHTED INCLUDED THE FOLLOWING: ITS SURPLUS FUNDS WERE USED TO IMPROVE PATIENT CARE, EXPAND HOSPITAL FACILITIES, AND ADVANCE MEDICAL TRAINING, EDUCATION AND RESEARCH; IT WAS CONTROLLED BY A BOARD OF TRUSTEES THAT CONSISTED OF INDEPENDENT CIVIC LEADERS; AND HOSPITAL MEDICAL STAFF PRIVILEGES WERE AVAILABLE TO ALL QUALIFIED PHYSICIANS. MEDICARE UNDERPAYMENTS AND BAD DEBT ARE COMMUNITY BENEFIT AND ASSOCIATED COSTS ARE INCLUDABLE ON THE FORM 990, SCHEDULE H, PART I. THE AMERICAN HOSPITAL ASSOCIATION (""AHA"") FEELS THAT MEDICARE UNDERPAYMENTS (SHORTFALL) AND BAD DEBT ARE COMMUNITY BENEFIT AND THUS INCLUDABLE ON THE FORM 990, SCHEDULE H, PART I. THIS ORGANIZATION AGREES WITH THE AHA'S POSITION. AS OUTLINED IN THE AHA'S LETTER TO THE IRS DATED AUGUST 21, 2007 WITH RESPECT TO THE FIRST PUBLISHED DRAFT OF THE NEW FORM 990 AND SCHEDULE H, THE AHA FELT THAT THE IRS SHOULD INCORPORATE THE FULL VALUE OF THE COMMUNITY BENEFIT THAT HOSPITALS PROVIDE BY COUNTING MEDICARE UNDERPAYMENTS (SHORTFALL) AS QUANTIFIABLE COMMUNITY BENEFIT FOR THE FOLLOWING REASONS: - PROVIDING CARE FOR THE ELDERLY AND SERVING MEDICARE PATIENTS IS AN ESSENTIAL PART OF THE COMMUNITY BENEFIT STANDARD - MEDICARE, LIKE MEDICAID, DOES NOT PAY THE FULL COST OF CARE. FROM THE LATEST DATA PROVIDED BY THE AMERICAN HOSPITAL ASSOCIATION, AS OF 2012, MEDICARE REIMBURSES HOSPITALS ONLY 86 CENTS FOR EVERY DOLLAR THEY SPEND TO TAKE CARE OF MEDICARE PATIENTS. THE MEDICARE PAYMENT ADVISORY COMMISSION (""MEDPAC""), IN ITS MARCH 2013 REPORT TO CONGRESS, STATES THAT BENEFICIARIES WILL GROW NOTABLY FASTER IN THE NEXT 10 YEARS THAN IN THE PAST DECADE AS THE BABY-BOOM GENERATION AGES INTO THE PROGRAM. IN ADDITION, THE POPULATION AGING INTO THE MEDICARE PROGRAM WILL PRESENT A NEW SET OF CHALLENGES SINCE RISING OBESITY LEVELS PUT THIS POPULATION AT A GREATER RISK THAN PREVIOUS GENERATIONS FOR CHRONIC DISEASE. - MANY MEDICARE BENEFICIARIES, LIKE THEIR MEDICAID COUNTERPARTS, ARE POOR. MORE THAN 42 PERCENT OF MEDICARE SPENDING IS FOR BENEFICIARIES WHOSE INCOME IS BELOW 200 PERCENT OF THE FEDERAL POVERTY LEVEL. MANY OF THOSE MEDICARE BENEFICIARIES ARE ALSO ELIGIBLE FOR MEDICAID -- SO CALLED ELIGIBLE."" THERE IS EVERY COMPELLING PUBLIC POLICY REASON TO TREAT MEDICARE AND MEDICAID UNDERPAYMENTS SIMILARLY FOR PURPOSES OF A HOSPITAL'S COMMUNITY BENEFIT AND INCLUDE THESE COSTS ON FORM 990, SCHEDULE H, PART I. MEDICARE UNDERPAYMENT MUST BE SHOULDERED BY THE HOSPITAL IN ORDER TO CONTINUE TREATING THE COMMUNITY'S ELDERLY AND POOR. THESE UNDERPAYMENTS REPRESENT A REAL COST OF SERVING THE COMMUNITY AND SHOULD COUNT AS A QUANTIFIABLE COMMUNITY BENEFIT. BOTH THE AHA AND THIS ORGANIZATION ALSO FEEL THAT PATIENT BAD DEBT IS A COMMUNITY BENEFIT AND THUS INCLUDABLE ON THE FORM 990, SCHEDULE H, PART I. LIKE MEDICARE UNDERPAYMENT (SHORTFALLS), THERE ALSO ARE COMPELLING REASONS THAT PATIENT BAD DEBT SHOULD BE COUNTED AS QUANTIFIABLE COMMUNITY BENEFIT AS FOLLOWS: - A SIGNIFICANT MAJORITY OF BAD DEBT IS ATTRIBUTABLE TO LOW-INCOME PATIENTS, WHO, FOR MANY REASONS, DECLINE TO COMPLETE THE FORMS REQUIRED TO ESTABLISH ELIGIBILITY FOR HOSPITALS' CHARITY CARE OR FINANCIAL ASSISTANCE PROGRAMS. A 2006 CONGRESSIONAL BUDGET OFFICE (""CBO"") REPORT, NONPROFIT HOSPITALS AND THE PROVISION OF COMMUNITY BENEFITS, CITED TWO STUDIES INDICATING THAT ""THE GREAT MAJORITY OF BAD DEBT WAS ATTRIBUTABLE TO PATIENTS WITH INCOMES BELOW 200% OF THE FEDERAL POVERTY LINE."" - THE REPORT ALSO NOTED THAT A SUBSTANTIAL PORTION OF BAD DEBT IS PENDING CHARITY CARE. UNLIKE BAD DEBT IN OTHER INDUSTRIES, HOSPITAL BAD DEBT IS COMPLICATED BY THE FACT THAT HOSPITALS FOLLOW THEIR MISSION TO THE COMMUNITY AND TREAT EVERY PATIENT THAT COMES THROUGH THEIR EMERGENCY DEPARTMENT, REGARDLESS OF ABILITY TO PAY. PATIENTS WHO HAVE OUTSTANDING BILLS ARE NOT TURNED AWAY, UNLIKE OTHER INDUSTRIES. BAD DEBT IS FURTHER COMPLICATED BY THE AUDITING INDUSTRY'S STANDARDS ON REPORTING CHARITY CARE. MANY PATIENTS CANNOT OR DO NOT PROVIDE THE NECESSARY, EXTENSI"

In the quantitative analysis, multiple sources provided the reportable statistics including the New York State Community Health Indicators, the County Health Rankings Report, as well as internal data from Cayuga Medical Center. The data collected for the quantitative assessment was then sorted into the following health categories: * Demographics and socioeconomic status * Access to health care * Health Status of overall population and priority populations * Risk factor behaviors and conditions related to top 5 causes of death * Child health * Infectious diseases * Natural environment * Social and Mental Health environment * Resources/Assets. For every indicator, comparisons were made utilizing the mean value for each individual county, the aggregate value for the total community, the New York State w/o New York City (NYC) state value, and the U.S. value where applicable to generate context for interpretation. Information for this assessment was collected in a different manner this year, as the CHNA and Community Health Improvement Plan (CHIP) was a combined effort with the Local Health Department of Tompkins County. The CHNA/CHIP team was comprised of representatives from Tompkins County, Cayuga Medical Center and several community-based non-profit organizations. Much of the information driving the selection/confirmation of our priorities was gathered through conversations with service providers, and through panels and presentations by peers and providers. Key data indicators were reviewed to guide selection decisions for our priority focus areas. For example, data on hospitalizations related to mental health and substance abuse showed steep increases over the last 2-10 years, indicating that mental health and substance abuse continues to be a priority for Tompkins County. Finally, review of chronic disease indicators revealed that Tompkins County is in the second quartile statewide, indicating the need to continue our efforts to focus on underserved populations, particularly in the rural parts of the county."

Many of these areas are designated rural counties and Tompkins County is NYS's smallest Metropolitan Statistical Area. The total service area spans approximately 1,000 square miles in the middle of the state with an average population density of fewer than 125 persons per square mile. There are several distinct health and health-related factors affecting residents of this area: A)The Region is home to an older community. According to HANYS, 11.3% of adults are 55-64 years of age. Since the 2000 Census, growth in the 65+ age cohort has ranged from 15% to 32% across the region and is projected to increase by 18% between 2016-2021. Issues with chronic disease and psychological distress are well documented for this demographic. Overall, 22.9% of adults aged 55 and over are likely to be in fair or poor health, ranging from 19.6% of those aged 55-64 to 32.1% of those aged 85 and over (National Health Statistics Reports, Health Characteristics of Adults Aged 55 Years and Over: United States, 2004-2007, CDC, 2009). B) Access to health care professionals within the Region is problematic. Many of the counties have zip codes within that county with Health Professional Shortage Areas (HPSAs) designations for physician, dental, and mental health care for Medicaid beneficiaries. Even when a provider is available, the rural environment, defined by hilly terrains and lakes as geographic barriers, creates transportation challenges that can limit access. C) In aggregate, residents of the service area are fiscally challenged. The median salary within the Region is $52,624, which is $6,645 below the state average (ACS 5-year Estimate, Census Bureau)."

As a 501(c)(3) organization, Cayuga Medical Center reinvests any surplus in annual operating margin to improve medical care for the community, including patient-side and technology improvements, facility structure and infrastructure, and improvements in care delivery. As an example, Cayuga Medical Center is investing in a $6.9 million facilities project to renovate and expand its inpatient Behavioral Services Unit starting in 2017. Part of this project will be funded through a NYS grant ($2.47 million), but the majority of the project will be funded through Cayuga Medical Center's own reserves.

The Rockefeller University Hospital community served/service area is determined based on research being conducted. Principal Investigators identify an area of interest and submit a protocol for review and approval by our institutional review board. If and when the protocol is approved, our recruitment office works with the investigator to develop and submit advertisements in local newspapers, magazines and online. Identification of lucrative places to advertise is determined by current trends in readership among local newspapers, magazines and visits to particular websites such as Craigslist and Facebook. Research participants are culled from all over New York City as well as through collaborations with neighboring hospitals, Universities, and clinics. As a result, our enrolled research participant demographics are similar to those of New York City overall. In calendar year 2016 20% of research participants identified as Hispanic, 36% identified as Black or African-American and 32% identified as white (RUH subject race and ethnicity report 2016), which is similar to the geographic makeup of New York City (69.9% white, 17.7% Black or African-American, and 19% Hispanic) (https://www.census.gov/quickfacts/fact/table/newyorkcitynewyork,NY/PST045216)."

THE ASSESSMENT FOCUSES ON COMMUNITY NEED AS A DETERMINING FACTOR IN ASSESSING THE APPROPRIATENESS OF PHYSICIAN RECRUITMENT INITIATIVES. THE APPROACH TO EVALUATING PHYSICIAN NEED IS BASED ON THE FOLLOWING FACTORS: -DEFINING THE DEMOGRAPHIC PROFILE AND PAYOR MIX OF THE HOSPITAL'S SERVICE AREA. -RESEARCHING UNIQUE SERVICE AREA FACTORS THAT MIGHT INFLUENCE THE DEMAND FOR HEALTHCARE SERVICES WITHIN THE AREA. -IDENTIFYING THE TOTAL NUMBER OF PHYSICIANS BY SPECIALTY IN THE DEFINED SERVICE AREA. -DEVELOPING A PROFILE OF THE CURRENT MEDICAL STAFF. -UTILIZING SIX ESTABLISHED PHYSICIAN NEEDS ASSESSMENT MODELS TO IDENTIFY POTENTIAL PHYSICIAN SURPLUSES OR DEFICITS IN EACH MEDICAL SPECIALTY. -EXAMINING RESULTS OF THE MEDICAL STAFF SURVEY AND PHYSICIAN FOCUS INTERVIEWS TO DETERMINE THE PERCEIVED RECRUITMENT NEEDS OF THE HOSPITAL'S EXISTING STAFF PHYSICIANS AND TO IDENTIFY MEDICAL COMMUNITY CONCERNS. -CONDUCT A COMMUNITY SURVEY TO INTEGRATE PERCEIVED SHORTAGES INTO RECOMMENDATIONS. -EVALUATING RESULTS OF THE ABOVE EFFORTS IN THE CONTEXT OF OUR MEDICAL STAFFING AND CONSULTING EXPERIENCE.

A HOSPITAL REPRESENTATIVE WILL EXPLAIN THE STATE PROGRAMS TO THE PATIENT AND ASSIST IN THE PREPARATION OF THE APPLICATION AND GATHERING OF INFORMATION, IF APPLICABLE. IF THE PATIENT DOES NOT QUALIFY FOR ASSISTANCE, THE REPRESENTATIVE INFORMS HIM/HER OF THE HOSPITAL'S CHARITY CARE PROGRAM. OUTPATIENT: CERTAIN OUTPATIENT AREAS (EMERGENCY ROOM, REGISTRATION) HAVE SIGNS THAT LET PATIENTS KNOW THE HOSPITAL HAS A CHARITY CARE PROGRAM. SOME AREAS ALSO HAVE MEDICAL ASSISTANCE APPLICATIONS ON HAND TO GIVE TO PATIENTS. CONSISTENT WITH THE HOSPITAL MISSION, ALL PATIENTS REQUIRING IMMEDIATE CARE ARE TREATED WITHOUT REGARD TO THEIR ABILITY TO PAY. ALLPATIENTS: FOR PATIENTS THAT ARE UNINSURED OR UNDER INSURED, A HOSPITAL REPRESENTATIVE IS AVAILABLE TO DISCUSS OPTIONS FOR PAYMENT WITH THE PATIENT. WHEN APPROPRIATE, PAYMENT FOR ELECTIVE SERVICES IS DISCUSSED UPFRONT AND IF THE PATIENT IS ABLE TO PAY, IS COLLECTED IN ADVANCE OF SERVICE. EFFORTS ARE MADE TO COLLECT PATIENT LIABILITIES IN CERTAIN AREAS SUCH AS OPSU AND ADMISSIONS. INSURANCE COPAYS ARE ATTEMPTED TO BE COLLECTED IN THE EMERGENCY DEPARTMENT IN ACCORDANCE WITH EMTALA REGULATIONS. WHEN THERE IS A BALANCE DUE (SELF-PAY OR BALANCE AFTER INSURANCE) AND NO COLLECTION WAS MADE IN ADVANCE OF OR AT THE TIME OF SERVICE, A STATEMENT WILL BE SENT TO PATIENTS PROVIDING A PHONE NUMBER FOR THEM TO CALL AND DISCUSS PAYMENT OPTIONS. IF THE PATIENT DOES NOT CALL OR MAKE PAYMENT, A HOSPITAL REPRESENTATIVE WILL CALL HIM/HER TO DISCUSS THE AMOUNT DUE AND TO DETERMINE IF THEY ARE ELIGIBLE FOR ANY PROGRAMS OR INSURANCES OR TO MAKE PAYMENT ARRANGEMENTS THAT CAN HELP THE PATIENT. AT ANY POINT IN THE CONVERSATION, IF THE PATIENT SAYS HE/SHE CANNOT AFFORD TO PAY THE BILL, THE PATIENT IS OFFERED A CHARITY CARE APPLICATION. ONCE THE CHARITY CARE APPLICATION IS COMPLETE, IF THE PATIENT DOES NOT QUALIFY BUT CONTINUES TO EXPRESS CONCERNS ABOUT BEING ABLE TO PAY HIS/HER BILL, THE ACCOUNT IS REVIEWED FOR THE POSSIBILITY OF A DISCOUNT OR AN AFFORDABLE PAYMENT PLAN. THE HOSPITAL STRIVES TO ACCOMMODATE EVERY PATIENT'S FINANCIAL SITUATION IF POSSIBLE. THE HOSPITAL'S CHARITY CARE PROGRAM PROVIDES FOR FREE OR DISCOUNTED CARE BASED ON FEDERAL POVERTY GUIDELINES (FPG).

The University of Miami Hospital and Anne Bates Leach Eye Hospital are reimbursed under the Medicare Prospective Payment System (PPS). For inpatient services, the reimbursement methodology is the Inpatient Prospective Payment System (IPPS), which uses the Diagnostic Related Groups (DRGS) methodology to reimburse the hospital. The DRG amounts are updated by the Medicare program annually by an updating factor. However, the amount of the updating factor is always significantly less than the actual healthcare inflation factor because the Medicare program includes a ""budget neutrality"" factor for the overall Medicare program. Thus, the hospital does not receive full reimbursement of its cost for inpatient services. For outpatient services, the reimbursement methodology is the Outpatient Prospective Payment System (OPPS), which uses ambulatory payment classifications (APCS) to reimburse the hospital. The APC amounts are updated by the Medicare program annually by an updating factor. However, the amount of the updating factor is always significantly less than the actual healthcare inflation factor because the Medicare program includes a ""budget neutrality"" factor for the overall Medicare program. Thus, the hospital does not receive full reimbursement for its cost for outpatient services. The University of Miami Hospital and Clinics is a cancer specialty hospital and, as such, is cost based reimbursed for both inpatient and outpatient services. For inpatient services, the limit is the TEFRA target limit. The hospital, on occasion, exceeds the target rate and does not receive full cost reimbursement. The TEFRA target amount is updated by the Medicare program annually by the TEFRA updating factor. However, the amount of the TEFRA updating factor is always significantly less than the actual healthcare inflation factor because the Medicare program includes a ""budget neutrality"" factor for the overall Medicare program. For outpatient services, the limit is the payment to cost ratio (PCR). The PCR was established using a base year, which was 1996, at a rate of 85.5% of cost. The PCR for all exempt cancer centers was 92% through 12/31/16, and then 91% from 1/1/17 to 5/31/17; therefore, the hospital currently does not receive payment for a range of 8% to 9% of its outpatient cost."

THE PROVISION FOR BAD DEBTS IS BASED UPON MANAGEMENT'S ASSESSMENT OF HISTORICAL AND EXPECTED NET COLLECTIONS CONSIDERING CURRENT BUSINESS AND ECONOMIC CONDITIONS, TRENDS IN HEALTH CARE COVERAGE AND OTHER COLLECTION INDICATORS. PERIODICALLY THROUGHOUT THE YEAR, MANAGEMENT ASSESSES THE ADEQUACY OF THE ALLOWANCE FOR UNCOLLECTIBLE ACCOUNTS BASED UPON HISTORICAL WRITE-OFF EXPERIENCE OF SELF-PAY ACCOUNTS RECEIVABLE INCLUDING THOSE BALANCES AFTER INSURANCE PAYMENTS AND NOT COVERED BY INSURANCE.

PART VI NEEDS ASSESSMENT OUR FIRST STEP IN CONDUCTING OUR 2016 COMMUNITY HEALTH NEEDS ASSESSMENT WAS TO DEFINE THE COMMUNITY WE SERVE. TO DO SO WE CONSIDERED A NUMBER OF RELEVANT FACTS AND CIRCUMSTANCES, INCLUDING THE GEOGRAPHIC AREA WE SERVE, THE TARGET POPULATIONS WE SERVE, AND OUR PRINCIPAL FUNCTIONS AS A HOSPITAL, WHICH INCLUDE OUR SERVICE LINES. IN DEFINING THE COMMUNITY WE SERVE, WE SPECIFICALLY INCLUDED THE MEDICALLY UNDERSERVED, LOW INCOME AND THE MINORITY POPULATIONS WHO LIVE IN THE GEOGRAPHIC AREA FROM WHICH WE DRAW PATIENTS. IN ADDITION, WE INCLUDED ALL PATIENTS WITHOUT REGARD TO WHETHER (OR HOW MUCH) THEY OR THEIR INSURERS PAY FOR CARE RECEIVED OR WHETHER THEY ARE ELIGIBLE FOR ASSISTANCE UNDER OUR FINANCIAL ASSISTANCE POLICY. WE ASSESSED THE HEALTH NEEDS OF THE COMMUNITY IN COLLABORATION WITH OTHER NONPROFIT HOSPITALS WHOSE COMMUNITIES OVERLAPPED WITH OURS AND THE HEALTH COLLABORATIVE. THE HEALTH COLLABORATIVE IS A NONPROFIT ORGANIZATION SERVING THE GREATER CINCINNATI AREA. IT WORKS WITH ITS MEMBER HOSPITALS ON HEALTH CARE IMPROVEMENT PROJECTS AND SHARES BEST PRACTICES. THE HEALTH COLLABORATIVE BROUGHT 20 HOSPITALS TOGETHER, INCLUDING THE CHRIST HOSPITAL, TO CONDUCT A COMPREHENSIVE, COLLABORATIVE COMMUNITY HEALTH NEEDS ASSESSMENT (COLLABORATIVE CHNA). THE COLLABORATIVE CHNA ALSO PROVIDES A DETAILED DESCRIPTION OF (1) HOW THE COLLABORATIVE CHNA TEAM SOLICITED AND TOOK INTO ACCOUNT INPUT RECEIVED FROM PERSONS WHO REPRESENT THE BROAD INTERESTS OF THE COMMUNITY, INCLUDING THOSE WITH SPECIAL KNOWLEDGE OF, OR EXPERTISE IN, PUBLIC HEALTH, (2) HOW AND OVER WHAT PERIOD OF TIME SUCH INPUT WAS PROVIDED, (3) THE NAMES OF ORGANIZATIONS PROVIDING INPUT AND THE NATURE AND EXTENT OF THE ORGANIZATIONS INPUT, (4) DESCRIPTIONS OF THE MEDICALLY UNDERSERVED, LOW INCOME OR MINORITY POPULATIONS BEING REPRESENTED BY ORGANIZATIONS OR INDIVIDUALS THAT PROVIDED INPUT. IN ADDITION, THE CHRIST HOSPITAL REVIEWED ANY WRITTEN COMMENTS RECEIVED REGARDING THE 2013 COMMUNITY HEALTH NEEDS ASSESSMENT AND IMPLEMENTATION STRATEGY. TO DATE, TO THE BEST OF OUR KNOWLEDGE, NO WRITTEN COMMENTS HAVE BEEN RECEIVED AND, THUS, WRITTEN COMMENTS WERE NOT AVAILABLE FOR CONSIDERATION IN THIS ASSESSMENT. FOR EASE OF REFERENCE, THE FOLLOWING PROVIDES AN EXECUTIVE OVERVIEW OF SOME OF THE PROCESSES, METHODS AND DATA INPUT COLLECTION AND ANALYSIS USED TO CONDUCT THE COLLABORATIVE CHNA. REPRESENTATIVES FROM 11 HEALTHCARE SYSTEMS (REPRESENTING 20 HOSPITALS), INCLUDING THE CHRIST HOSPITAL) MET FIVE TIMES AND COMPRISED THE COLLABORATIVE CHNA COMMITTEE. THIS GROUP ASSISTED IN PROCESS DESIGN, PROVIDED FEEDBACK TO THE CONSULTANT AND THE HEALTH COLLABORATIVE AND SHARED BEST PRACTICES WITH EACH OTHER. THE COLLABORATIVE CHNA COMMITTEE ALSO INCLUDED REPRESENTATIVES FROM THE CINCINNATI HEALTH DEPARTMENT, HAMILTON COUNTY PUBLIC HEALTH, INTERACT FOR HEALTH (A REGIONAL PHILANTHROPIC ORGANIZATION) AND A PHYSICIAN/PROFESSOR FROM XAVIER UNIVERSITY. CONSISTENT SOURCES OF COMPARABLE DATA WERE AVAILABLE ONLY AT THE STATE AND COUNTY LEVELS, AND THEREFORE EACH PARTICIPATING HOSPITAL IDENTIFIED WHICH COUNTIES CONTAINED THEIR SERVICES AREAS. SERVICE AREAS SPANNED 19 COUNTIES OVER THREE STATES. THE CINCINNATI-MIDDLETOWN METROPOLITAN STATISTICAL AREA INCLUDES AN ADDITIONAL FOUR COUNTIES (BRACKEN, GALLATIN, GRANT, AND PENDLETON), AND SO THE COLLABORATIVE CHNA ASSESSED THE NEEDS OF CITIZENS FOR 23 COUNTIES IN TOTAL. RESULTS IN THE COLLABORATIVE CHNA INCLUDE DATA FROM A STRUCTURED SURVEY, QUALITATIVE DATA FROM MULTIPLE FOCUS GROUPS, AN ANALYSIS OF AVAILABLE SECONDARY DATA AND FINDINGS FROM HEALTH DEPARTMENT INTERVIEWS AND SURVEYS. THE CHNA TEAM COLLECTED 106 MEASURES FROM PUBLICLY AVAILABLE SOURCES, STARTING WITH THE COUNTY HEALTH RANKINGS. CRITERIA FOR INCLUSION INCLUDED AVAILABILITY OF TREND DATA AT THE COUNTY LEVEL AND EASE OF COMPARISON AND UPDATING. PRIMARY DATA COLLECTION INVOLVED INTERVIEWS OF PUBLIC HEALTH OFFICIALS; ONLINE AND PAPER SURVEYS; AND COMMUNITY FOCUS GROUPS. THERE WERE FOUR DISTINCT STAKEHOLDER GROUPS WITH SEPARATE ANALYSIS FOR COMPARISON: (1) CONSUMERS AND ORGANIZATIONS WHICH ATTENDED MEETINGS, (2) INDIVIDUALS SURVEYED, (3) ORGANIZATIONS SURVEYED AND (4) HEALTH DEPARTMENTS (COLLECTIVELY, STAKEHOLDERS). ALL RESPONDENTS ANSWERED QUESTIONS ABOUT SERIOUS HEALTH ISSUES, ISSUES HANDLED WELL, ISSUES NOT ADDRESSED ENOUGH, AND BARRIERS TO CARE. HOSPITALS INVITED NONPROFIT AGENCIES AND ORGANIZATIONS SERVING THE MEDICALLY UNDERSERVED, LOW-INCOME, AND MINORITY POPULATIONS TO ATTEND MEETINGS AND COMPLETE SURVEYS. MORE THAN 80 SENT REPRESENTATIVES TO PARTICIPATE IN FOCUS GROUPS. PARTICIPATING ORGANIZATIONS PROVIDED THE NAME OF, AND AREAS SERVED BY, THEIR ORGANIZATION. SURVEY RESPONDENTS ALSO IDENTIFIED THE TYPES OF VULNERABLE POPULATIONS SERVED. MEETING ATTENDEES SHARED THE NAMES OF THE INDIVIDUALS REPRESENTING EACH ORGANIZATION. IN TOTAL, MORE THAN 600 PEOPLE PROVIDED INPUT FOR THE REGIONAL COMMUNITY HEALTH NEEDS ASSESSMENT PROCESS. IMPORTANTLY, THIS COMPREHENSIVE COMMUNITY HEALTH NEEDS ASSESSMENT WAS CONDUCTED IN CLOSE COORDINATION WITH A BROADER COLLECTIVE IMPACT ON HEALTH REGIONAL EFFORT, ALSO LED BY THE HEALTH COLLABORATIVE. COLLECTIVE IMPACT ON HEALTH INCLUDED A SIGNIFICANT MICROSIMULATION MODELING PROCESS FOR NOT ONLY UNDERSTANDING THE CURRENT STATE, BUT ALSO FOR MODELING WHAT THE COMMUNITY COULD HOPE TO ACCOMPLISH TOGETHER OVER A LONGER PERIOD OF TIME TO IMPROVE HEALTH, HEALTHCARE AND AFFORDABILITY (E.G.

SINCE 2010, THE COMMUNITY OVERALL HAS GROWN BY ANOTHER 9%. CHAMBERS COUNTY HAS THE SMALLEST POPULATION, ACCOUNTING FOR 34,863 OF HMH COMMUNITY RESIDENTS, WHICH IS APPROXIMATELY 1% OF THE COMMUNITY POPULATION. FORT BEND COUNTY AND MONTGOMERY COUNTY EXPERIENCED THE MOST POPULATION GROWTH WITHIN THE MSA COUNTIES BETWEEN 2010 AND 2015, AT RATES OF 16% AND 13%, RESPECTIVELY. BETWEEN 2015 AND 2020, FORT BEND IS EXPECTED TO EXPERIENCE AN 11% POPULATION INCREASE, AND MONTGOMERY COUNTY IS EXPECTED TO EXPERIENCE A 9% INCREASE. BETWEEN 2010 AND 2015, THE HOUSTON-SUGARLAND-BAYTOWN MSA SAW A 9% POPULATION INCREASE OVERALL, WITH ANOTHER 8% INCREASE EXPECTED BETWEEN 2015 AND 2020. WHARTON COUNTY EXPERIENCED THE LEAST AMOUNT OF POPULATION GROWTH WITHIN THE MSA COUNTIES BETWEEN 2010 AND 2015 AT 1%. WHARTON COUNTY IS EXPECTED TO HAVE THE LOWEST POPULATION GROWTH IN COMPARISON TO THE OTHER MSA COUNTIES BETWEEN 2015 AND 2020. THE HMH COMMUNITY REFLECTS THE RACIAL MAKEUP OF THE HOUSTON-SUGARLAND-BAYTOWN METROPOLITAN STATISTICAL AREA. THIS COMMUNITY IS CONSIDERED ONE OF THE MOST DIVERSE IN THE NATION, WITH HOUSTON MAINTAINING A MINORITY-MAJORITY CITY STATUS DUE IN PART TO A LARGE HISPANIC/NON-WHITE POPULATION. HMH SERVES AN INCREDIBLY DYNAMIC AND DIVERSE COMMUNITY. THE COMMUNITY LACKS A SINGULAR RACIAL MAJORITY AND EVERY RACE CURRENTLY OCCUPIES A MINORITY POSITION. THE ASIAN POPULATION EXPERIENCED THE MOST GROWTH IN THE HMH COMMUNITY (19%) BETWEEN 2010 AND 2015.

IN ADDITION TO THE FEDERAL POVERTY GUIDELINES ELIGIBILITY CRITERIA NOTED ELIGIBILITY FOR FINANCIAL ASSISTANCE WILL BE CONSIDERED FOR THOSE INDIVIDUALS WHO ARE UNINSURED, INELIGIBLE FOR ANY GOVERNMENT HEALTHCARE BENEFIT PROGRAM, AND THOSE WHO ARE UNABLE TO PAY FOR THEIR CARE, BASED UPON DETERMINATION OF FINANCIAL NEED IN ACCORDANCE WITH THE FINANCIAL ASSISTANCE POLICY. PATIENTS WHOSE FAMILY INCOME EXCEEDS 300% OF THE FPL MAY BE ELIGIBLE TO RECEIVE DISCOUNTED RATES ON A CASE-BY-CASE BASIS BASED ON THEIR SPECIFIC CIRCUMSTANCES, SUCH AS CATASTROPHIC ILLNESS OR MEDICAL INDIGENCE, AT THE DISCRETION OF ST. LUKES UNIVERSITY HEALTH NETWORK. THERE ARE INSTANCES WHEN A PATIENT APPEARS TO BE ELIGIBLE FOR FINANCIAL ASSISTANCE, BUT THERE IS NO FINANCIAL ASSISTANCE FORM ON FILE DUE TO LACK OF SUPPORTING DOCUMENTATION. OFTEN THERE IS ADEQUATE INFORMATION PROVIDED BY THE PATIENT OR OBTAINED THROUGH OTHER SOURCES, WHICH COULD PROVIDE SUFFICIENT EVIDENCE TO PROVIDE THE PATIENT WITH FINANCIAL ASSISTANCE. IN THE EVENT THERE IS NO EVIDENCE TO SUPPORT A PATIENTS ELIGIBILITY FOR FINANCIAL ASSISTANCE, ST. LUKES UNIVERSITY HEALTH NETWORK MAY USE OUTSIDE AGENCIES IN DETERMINING ESTIMATED INCOME AMOUNTS FOR THE BASIS OF DETERMINING FINANCIAL ASSISTANCE ELIGIBILITY AND POTENTIAL DISCOUNT AMOUNTS. PRESUMPTIVE ELIGIBILITY MAY BE DETERMINED ON THE BASIS OF INDIVIDUAL LIFE CIRCUMSTANCE THAT MAY INCLUDE: - STATE-FUNDED PRESCRIPTION PROGRAMS; - HOMELESS OR RECEIVED CARE FROM A HOMELESS CLINIC; - PARTICIPATION IN WOMEN, INFANTS AND CHILDREN PROGRAMS (WIC); - FOOD STAMP ELIGIBILITY; - SUBSIDIZED SCHOOL LUNCH PROGRAM ELIGIBILITY; - ELIGIBILITY FOR OTHER STATE OR LOCAL ASSISTANCE PROGRAMS THAT ARE UNFUNDED (E.G., MEDICAID SPEND DOWN); - LOW INCOME/SUBSIDIZED HOUSING IS PROVIDED AS A VALID ADDRESS; - PATIENT IS DECEASED WITH NO KNOWN ESTATE; - DECLARED CHAPTER 7 BANKRUPTCY AND CARE WAS INCURRED PRIOR TO BANKRUPTCY; AND - DECLARED CHAPTER 13 BANKRUPTCY AND PATIENT WILL HAVE UNPAID BALANCE AFTER THE PAYMENT SCHEDULE IS RECEIVED. ADDITIONALLY, PRESUMPTIVE ELIGIBILITY MIGHT INCLUDE THE USE OF EXTERNAL PUBLICALLY AVAILABLE DATA SOURCES THAT PROVIDE INFORMATION ON A PATIENTS OR A PATIENTS GUARANTORS ABILITY TO PAY (SUCH AS CREDIT SCORING). ONCE DETERMINED, DUE TO THE INHERENT NATURE OF THE PRESUMPTIVE CIRCUMSTANCES, THE PATIENT MAY BE ELIGIBLE FOR UP TO 100% WRITE OFF OF THE ACCOUNT BALANCE. ST. LUKES UNIVERSITY HEALTH NETWORK PROVIDES, WITHOUT DISCRIMINATION, CARE FOR ALL EMERGENCY MEDICAL CONDITIONS TO INDIVIDUALS REGARDLESS OF THEIR FINANCIAL ASSISTANCE ELIGIBILITY OR ABILITY TO PAY. IT IS THE POLICY OF ST. LUKES UNIVERSITY HEALTH NETWORK TO COMPLY WITH THE STANDARDS OF THE FEDERAL EMERGENCY MEDICAL TREATMENT AND ACTIVE LABOR TRANSPORT ACT OF 1986 (""EMTALA"") AND THE EMTALA REGULATIONS IN PROVIDING A MEDICAL SCREENING EXAMINATION AND SUCH FURTHER TREATMENT AS MAY BE NECESSARY TO STABILIZE AN EMERGENCY MEDICAL CONDITION FOR ANY INDIVIDUAL COMING TO THE EMERGENCY DEPARTMENT SEEKING TREATMENT."

201801319349302720,231352213,"SCHEDULE H, PART III, LINE 8","MEDICARE COSTS WERE DERIVED FROM THE MEDICARE COST REPORT FILED BY THE ORGANIZATION. THE ORGANIZATION FEELS THAT MEDICARE UNDERPAYMENTS (SHORTFALL) AND BAD DEBT ARE COMMUNITY BENEFIT AND ASSOCIATED COSTS ARE INCLUDABLE ON THE FORM 990, SCHEDULE H, PART I. AS OUTLINED MORE FULLY BELOW THE ORGANIZATION BELIEVES THAT THESE SERVICES AND RELATED COSTS PROMOTE THE HEALTH OF THE COMMUNITY AS A WHOLE AND ARE RENDERED IN CONJUNCTION WITH THE ORGANIZATION'S CHARITABLE TAX-EXEMPT PURPOSES AND MISSION IN PROVIDING MEDICALLY NECESSARY HEALTHCARE SERVICES TO ALL INDIVIDUAL'S IN A NON-DISCRIMINATORY MANNER WITHOUT REGARD TO RACE, COLOR, CREED, SEX, NATIONAL ORIGIN OR ABILITY TO PAY AND CONSISTENT WITH THE COMMUNITY BENEFIT STANDARD PROMULGATED BY THE INTERNAL REVENUE SERVICE (""IRS""). THE COMMUNITY BENEFIT STANDARD IS THE CURRENT STANDARD FOR A HOSPITAL FOR RECOGNITION AS A TAX-EXEMPT AND CHARITABLE ORGANIZATION UNDER INTERNAL REVENUE CODE (""IRC"") 501(C)(3). THE ORGANIZATION IS RECOGNIZED AS A TAX-EXEMPT ENTITY AND CHARITABLE ORGANIZATION UNDER 501(C)(3) OF THE IRC. ALTHOUGH THERE IS NO DEFINITION IN THE TAX CODE FOR THE TERM ""CHARITABLE"", A REGULATION PROMULGATED BY THE DEPARTMENT OF THE TREASURY PROVIDES SOME GUIDANCE AND STATES THAT ""[T]HE TERM CHARITABLE IS USED IN 501(C)(3) IN ITS GENERALLY ACCEPTED LEGAL SENSE,PROVIDES EXAMPLES OF CHARITABLE PURPOSES, INCLUDING THE RELIEF OF THE POOR OR UNPRIVILEGED; THE PROMOTION OF SOCIAL WELFARE; AND THE ADVANCEMENT OF EDUCATION, RELIGION, AND SCIENCE. NOTE: IT DOES NOT EXPLICITLY ADDRESS THE ACTIVITIES OF HOSPITALS. IN THE ABSENCE OF EXPLICIT STATUTORY OR REGULATORY REQUIREMENTS APPLYING THE TERM ""CHARITABLE"" TO HOSPITALS, IT HAS BEEN LEFT TO THE IRS TO DETERMINE THE CRITERIA HOSPITALS MUST MEET TO QUALIFY AS IRC 501(C)(3) CHARITABLE ORGANIZATIONS. THE ORIGINAL STANDARD WAS KNOWN AS THE CHARITY CARE STANDARD. THIS STANDARD WAS REPLACED BY THE IRS WITH THE COMMUNITY BENEFIT STANDARD WHICH IS THE CURRENT STANDARD. CHARITY CARE STANDARD IN 1956, THE IRS ISSUED REVENUE RULING 56-185, WHICH ADDRESSED THE REQUIREMENTS HOSPITALS NEEDED TO MEET IN ORDER TO QUALIFY FOR IRC 501(C)(3) STATUS. ONE OF THESE REQUIREMENTS IS KNOWN AS THE ""CHARITY CARE STANDARD."" UNDER THE STANDARD, A HOSPITAL HAD TO PROVIDE, TO THE EXTENT OF ITS FINANCIAL ABILITY, FREE OR REDUCED-COST CARE TO PATIENTS UNABLE TO PAY FOR IT. A HOSPITAL THAT EXPECTED FULL PAYMENT DID NOT, ACCORDING TO THE RULING, PROVIDE CHARITY CARE BASED ON THE FACT THAT SOME PATIENTS ULTIMATELY FAILED TO PAY. THE RULING EMPHASIZED THAT A LOW LEVEL OF CHARITY CARE DID NOT NECESSARILY MEAN THAT A HOSPITAL HAD FAILED TO MEET THE REQUIREMENT SINCE THAT LEVEL COULD REFLECT ITS FINANCIAL ABILITY TO PROVIDE SUCH CARE. THE RULING ALSO NOTED THAT PUBLICLY SUPPORTED COMMUNITY HOSPITALS WOULD NORMALLY QUALIFY AS CHARITABLE ORGANIZATIONS BECAUSE THEY SERVE THE ENTIRE COMMUNITY AND A LOW LEVEL OF CHARITY CARE WOULD NOT AFFECT A HOSPITAL'S EXEMPT STATUS IF IT WAS DUE TO THE SURROUNDING COMMUNITY'S LACK OF CHARITABLE DEMANDS. COMMUNITY BENEFIT STANDARD IN 1969, THE IRS ISSUED REVENUE RULING 69-545, WHICH ""REMOVE[D]"" FROM REVENUE RULING 56-185 ""THE REQUIREMENTS RELATING TO CARING FOR PATIENTS WITHOUT CHARGE OR AT RATES BELOW COST."" UNDER THE STANDARD DEVELOPED IN REVENUE RULING 69-545, WHICH IS KNOWN AS THE ""COMMUNITY BENEFIT STANDARD,"" HOSPITALS ARE JUDGED ON WHETHER THEY PROMOTE THE HEALTH OF A BROAD CLASS OF INDIVIDUALS IN THE COMMUNITY. THE RULING INVOLVED A HOSPITAL THAT ONLY ADMITTED INDIVIDUALS WHO COULD PAY FOR THE SERVICES (BY THEMSELVES, PRIVATE INSURANCE, OR PUBLIC PROGRAMS SUCH AS MEDICARE), BUT OPERATED A FULL-TIME EMERGENCY ROOM THAT WAS OPEN TO EVERYONE. THE IRS RULED THAT THE HOSPITAL QUALIFIED AS A CHARITABLE ORGANIZATION BECAUSE IT PROMOTED THE HEALTH OF PEOPLE IN ITS COMMUNITY. THE IRS REASONED THAT BECAUSE THE PROMOTION OF HEALTH WAS A CHARITABLE PURPOSE ACCORDING TO THE GENERAL LAW OF CHARITY, IT FELL WITHIN THE ""GENERALLY ACCEPTED LEGAL SENSE"" OF THE TERM ""CHARITABLE,"" AS REQUIRED BY TREAS. REG. 1.501(C)(3)-1(D)(2). THE IRS RULING STATED THAT THE PROMOTION OF HEALTH, LIKE THE RELIEF OF POVERTY AND THE ADVANCEMENT OF EDUCATION AND RELIGION, IS ONE OF THE PURPOSES IN THE GENERAL LAW OF CHARITY THAT IS DEEMED BENEFICIAL TO THE COMMUNITY AS A WHOLE EVEN THOUGH THE CLASS OF BENEFICIARIES ELIGIBLE TO RECEIVE A DIRECT BENEFIT FROM ITS ACTIVITIES DOES NOT INCLUDE ALL MEMBERS OF THE COMMUNITY, SUCH AS INDIGENT MEMBERS OF THE COMMUNITY, PROVIDED THAT THE CLASS IS NOT SO SMALL THAT ITS RELIEF IS NOT OF BENEFIT TO THE COMMUNITY. THE IRS CONCLUDED THAT THE HOSPITAL WAS ""PROMOTING THE HEALTH OF A CLASS OF PERSONS THAT IS BROAD ENOUGH TO BENEFIT THE COMMUNITY"" BECAUSE ITS EMERGENCY ROOM WAS OPEN TO ALL AND IT PROVIDED CARE TO EVERYONE WHO COULD PAY, WHETHER DIRECTLY OR THROUGH THIRD-PARTY REIMBURSEMENT. OTHER CHARACTERISTICS OF THE HOSPITAL THAT THE IRS HIGHLIGHTED INCLUDED THE FOLLOWING: ITS SURPLUS FUNDS WERE USED TO IMPROVE PATIENT CARE, EXPAND HOSPITAL FACILITIES, AND ADVANCE MEDICAL TRAINING, EDUCATION, AND RESEARCH; IT WAS CONTROLLED BY A BOARD OF TRUSTEES THAT CONSISTED OF INDEPENDENT CIVIC LEADERS; AND HOSPITAL MEDICAL STAFF PRIVILEGES WERE AVAILABLE TO ALL QUALIFIED PHYSICIANS. THE AMERICAN HOSPITAL ASSOCIATION (""AHA"") FEELS THAT MEDICARE UNDERPAYMENTS (SHORTFALL) AND BAD DEBT ARE COMMUNITY BENEFIT AND THUS INCLUDABLE ON THE FORM 990, SCHEDULE H, PART I. THIS ORGANIZATION AGREES WITH THE AHA POSITION. AS OUTLINED IN THE AHA LETTER TO THE IRS DATED AUGUST 21, 2007 WITH RESPECT TO THE FIRST PUBLISHED DRAFT OF THE NEW FORM 990 AND SCHEDULE H, THE AHA FELT THAT THE IRS SHOULD INCORPORATE THE FULL VALUE OF THE COMMUNITY BENEFIT THAT HOSPITALS PROVIDE BY COUNTING MEDICARE UNDERPAYMENTS (SHORTFALL) AND BAD DEBT AS QUANTIFIABLE COMMUNITY BENEFIT FOR THE FOLLOWING REASONS: - PROVIDING CARE FOR THE ELDERLY AND SERVING MEDICARE PATIENTS IS AN ESSENTIAL PART OF THE COMMUNITY BENEFIT STANDARD. - MEDICARE, LIKE MEDICAID, DOES NOT PAY THE FULL COST OF CARE. RECENTLY, MEDICARE REIMBURSES HOSPITALS ONLY 92 CENTS FOR EVERY DOLLAR THEY SPEND TO TAKE CARE OF MEDICARE PATIENTS. THE MEDICARE PAYMENT ADVISORY COMMISSION (""MEDPAC"") IN ITS MARCH 2007 REPORT TO CONGRESS CAUTIONED THAT UNDERPAYMENT WILL GET EVEN WORSE, WITH MARGINS REACHING A 10-YEAR LOW AT NEGATIVE 5.4 PERCENT. - MANY MEDICARE BENEFICIARIES, LIKE THEIR MEDICAID COUNTERPARTS, ARE POOR. MORE THAN 46 PERCENT OF MEDICARE SPENDING IS FOR BENEFICIARIES WHOSE INCOME IS BELOW 200 PERCENT OF THE FEDERAL POVERTY LEVEL. MANY OF THOSE MEDICARE BENEFICIARIES ARE ALSO ELIGIBLE FOR MEDICAID -- SO CALLED ELIGIBLES."" THERE IS EVERY COMPELLING PUBLIC POLICY REASON TO TREAT MEDICARE AND MEDICAID UNDERPAYMENTS SIMILARLY FOR PURPOSES OF A HOSPITAL'S COMMUNITY BENEFIT AND INCLUDE THESE COSTS ON FORM 990, SCHEDULE H, PART I. MEDICARE UNDERPAYMENT MUST BE SHOULDERED BY THE HOSPITAL IN ORDER TO CONTINUE TREATING THE COMMUNITY'S ELDERLY AND POOR. THESE UNDERPAYMENTS REPRESENT A REAL COST OF SERVING THE COMMUNITY AND SHOULD COUNT AS A QUANTIFIABLE COMMUNITY BENEFIT. BOTH THE AHA AND THIS ORGANIZATION ALSO FEEL THAT PATIENT BAD DEBT IS A COMMUNITY BENEFIT AND THUS INCLUDABLE ON THE FORM 990, SCHEDULE H, PART I. THERE ARE COMPELLING REASONS THAT PATIENT BAD DEBT SHOULD BE COUNTED AS QUANTIFIABLE COMMUNITY BENEFIT AS FOLLOWS: - A SIGNIFICANT MAJORITY OF BAD DEBT IS ATTRIBUTABLE TO LOW-INCOME PATIENTS, WHO, FOR MANY REASONS, DECLINE TO COMPLETE THE FORMS REQUIRED TO ESTABLISH ELIGIBILITY FOR HOSPITALS' CHARITY CARE OR FINANCIAL ASSISTANCE PROGRAMS. A 2006 CONGRESSIONAL BUDGET OFFICE (""CBO"") REPORT, NONPROFIT HOSPITALS AND THE PROVISION OF COMMUNITY BENEFITS, CITED TWO STUDIES INDICATING THAT ""THE GREAT MAJORITY OF BAD DEBT WAS ATTRIBUTABLE TO PATIENTS WITH INCOMES BELOW 200% OF THE FEDERAL POVERTY LINE."" - THE REPORT ALSO NOTED THAT A SUBSTANTIAL PORTION OF BAD DEBT IS PENDING CHARITY CARE. UNLIKE BAD DEBT IN OTHER INDUSTRIES, HOSPITAL BAD DEBT IS COMPLICATED BY THE FACT THAT HOSPITALS FOLLOW THEIR MISSION TO THE COMMUNITY AND TREAT EVERY PATIENT THAT COMES THROUGH THEIR EMERGENCY DEPARTMENT, REGARDLESS OF ABILITY TO PAY. PATIENTS WHO HAVE OUTSTANDING BILLS ARE NOT TURNED AWAY, UNLIKE OTHER INDUSTRIES. BAD DEBT IS FURTHER COMPLICATED BY THE AUDITING INDUSTRY'S STANDARDS ON REPORTING CHARITY CARE. MANY PATIENTS CANNOT OR DO NOT PROVIDE THE NECESSARY, EXTENSIVE DOCUMENTATION REQUIRED TO BE DEEMED CHARITY CARE BY AUDITORS. AS A RESULT, ROUGHLY 10% OF BAD DEBT IS PENDING CHARITY CARE. - THE CBO CONCLUDED THAT ITS FINDINGS ""SUPPORT THE VALIDITY OF THE USE OF UNCOMPENSATED CARE [BAD DEBT AND CHARITY CARE] AS A MEASURE OF COMMUNITY BENEFITS"" ASSUMING THE FINDINGS ARE GENERALIZABLE NATIONWIDE; THE EXPERIENCE OF HOSPITALS AROUND THE NATION REINFORCES THAT THEY ARE GENERALIZABLE. AS OUTLINED BY THE AHA, DESPITE THE HOSPITAL'S BEST EFFORTS AND DUE DILIGENCE, PATIENT BAD DEBT IS A PART OF THE HOSPITAL'S MISSION AND CHARITABLE PURPOSES. BAD DEBT REPRESENTS"

FOOTNOTE:The amount of the provision for doubtful accounts is based upon management's assessment of historical and expected net collections, business and economics conditions, trends in federal and state governmental health care coverage, and other collection indicators. The provision for doubtful accounts and the allowance for doubtful accounts relate primarily to amounts due directly from patients. Management relies on the results of detailed reviews of historical write offs and recoveries as a primary source of information to utilize in estimating the collectability of the Company's accounts receivable. The results of the detailed reviews of historical write-offs and recoveries, adjusted for changes in trends and conditions, are used to estimate the allowance for doubtful accounts for the current period.

Collection of outstanding receivables from third-party payers (Medicare, managed care payers, etc.) is the Hospitals' primary source of cash and is critical to our ability to fund operations. The primary collection risks relate to uninsured patient accounts, including patient accounts for which the primary insurance carrier has paid the amounts covered by the applicable agreement, but patient responsibility amounts (deductibles and copayments) remain outstanding. The provision for doubtful accounts and the allowance for doubtful accounts relate primarily to amounts due directly from patients. An estimated allowance for doubtful accounts is recorded for all uninsured accounts, regardless of the aging of those accounts. Accounts are written off when all reasonable internal and external collections efforts have been performed. Our collection policies include a review of all accounts against certain standard collection criteria, upon completion of our internal collection efforts. Accounts determined to possess positive collectability attributes are forwarded to a secondary external collections agency and the other accounts are written off. The accounts that are not collected by the secondary external collection agency are written off when they are returned to us by the collection agency (usually within 12 months). Write-offs are based upon specific identification and the write-off process requires a write-off adjustment entry to the patient accounting system. We do not pursue collection of amounts related to patients that meet our guidelines to qualify as charity care. The methodology to determine the bad debt expense reported at cost on Part III, Line 2 is to take the ratio of patient care costs to gross patient charges and multiply this resulting ratio by the gross charges for bad debt accounts."

This was a first of its kind service collaboration in Louisiana. In 2015 this service was expanded through a broader network of public schools to include an additional site open to the district.

The Pink Ribbon Program covers the costs of mammograms or diagnostic screenings for women living in rural areas who are under or uninsured. The Vicky Wagner Breast Cancer Assistance Fund assists women living in Shelby County who are receiving treatment for breast cancer with out of pocket expenses such as wigs, transportation to treatment appointments, child care, meals or other expenses that insurance doesn't cover. In southwest Illinois, HSHS St. Joseph's Hospital in Highland provides enhanced offerings for senior population based on their CHNA. ""Senior Renewal"" is an outpatient counseling program for senior adults who may be facing emotional and physical problems unique to the aging process such as feelings of loneliness, isolation and anxiety. Clients receive a comprehensive level of treatment without inpatient hospitalization through counseling strategies and education. In addition, St. Joseph's Hospital is the lead collaborator in the Highland Area Meals on Wheels Program. In April 1977, the hospital partnered with the now defunct Highland Area Council of Churches to introduce the Meals on Wheels program. Today, St. Joseph's partners with the civic organization Highland Area Meals on Wheels Program to prepare and deliver nutritious meals to the elderly, those who are recuperating from illness or hospital stays, or anyone wishing to participate in the program within a 15-mile radius (cumulative population 20,000+) of the hospital. Annually, approximately 16,896 meals are delivered in eight communities. In addition to programs designed to increase access to care, HSHS makes sure that those who need financial assistance receive it. HSHS's Financial Assistance (Charity Care) policy was modified to offer a 45 percent self-pay discount to all patients who register without insurance. HSHS Financial Assistance programs have a sliding scale, in some instances providing up to a 55 percent reduction off billed charges if an uninsured patient's family income level is determined to be above 500 percent but equal to our less than 600 percent of the current Federal Poverty Guidelines. HSHS hospitals waive all charges for patients below 200 percent of the Federal Poverty Levels. Counselors are available in our hospitals to explain our financial assistance policy to patients, provide them with assistance in filling out a simple application form, or help them enroll in publicly funded health care programs. Enhance community health As part of our mission to embody Christ's healing love for all people, we understand that we have a responsibility to improve the overall quality of life in our communities by supporting initiatives that promote health and wellness. We recognize we are most successful when we work together with a wide array of public and private organizations that share our commitment to improving lives. By doing so, we maximize our efforts and reduce the duplication of services. To ensure the health care needs of all are being met, HSHS hospitals also understand we need to listen closely to the residents of the communities we serve. In turn, 13 HSHS hospitals conducted Community Health Needs Assessments (CHNAs) in FY2015. HSHS St. Clare Memorial Hospital in Oconto Falls, Wisconsin, who affiliated with HSHS in September 2015, and HSHS Holy Family Hospital in Greenville, Illinois, who affiliated with HSHS in May 2016, both completed their CHNAs in FY2014. HSHS Good Shepherd Hospital in Shelbyville, Illinois who affiliated with HSHS in January 2017, conducted its most recent CHNA in FY2016. HSHS hospitals are using the information gathered from their most recent CHNAs to develop new, and enhance existing, programs and services that best address the needs of the community. Priority health care needs were identified in the FY2015 CHNAs including access to health care services; alcohol, tobacco, and other drug abuse; chronic disease prevention and management; nutrition/wellness; mental health; and oral health. HSHS hospitals are addressing these and other needs by proactively offering educational opportunities, preventative screenings, and new or enhanced clinical services. In many cases, the hospitals collaborate with other hospital facilities, local departments of public health and community organizations to address identified needs. In western Wisconsin, HSHS Sacred Heart Hospital in Eau Claire and HSHS St. Joseph's Hospital in Chippewa Falls are taking the lead to educate the public about mental health issues and treatment, the stigma associated with mental health, and the recognition of mental health issues. Under the umbrella of 3D Community Health, the hospitals led suicide prevention activities across multiple sectors in collaboration with the Chippewa Health Improvement Partnership in FY2017. Strategies included community trainings of an evidence-based suicide prevention program, QPR (question, persuade & refer), and a variety of events, activities and displays pertaining to suicide prevention. Efforts are measured by the county suicide rate, inventory of change in community knowledge, stigma and behaviors, as well as participation in the county suicide death review team to monitor for potential trends and respond accordingly. 3D formed a suicide death review team in both Eau Claire and Chippewa Counties. These teams review details of each suicide to look for trends and key pieces of information that may guide efforts in targeting certain geographic areas, certain age or gender, etc. 3D is also focused on increasing community awareness and knowledge of the factors that offer protection from suicidal behaviors and that promote wellness and recovery in collaboration with multiple community partners on an ongoing basis. One strategy is to promote effective programs and practices i.e. adverse childhood experiences (ACEs) that increase protection from suicidal risk and promote connectedness among residents of Chippewa and Eau Claire Counties. At the Children, Health and Family Summit that 3D Community Health coordinated in partnership with the County Department of Human Services in FY2017, 99 of the 190 attendees took a pre-and- post-event survey about ACEs and brain development. There was a 24% increase in the percentage who strongly agreed that exposing infants to stress can actually cause them to develop a smaller brain post-event compared to pre-event survey. HSHS Holy Family Hospital in Greenville, Illinois has sponsored a multi-faceted health fair for decades, one of the largest Health Fairs in the east St. Louis metropolitan area. The event provides many free health tests in addition to five, low-cost comprehensive blood tests. In FY2017, more than 2,000 blood tests were performed as part of the hospital's annual Health Fair. Participants could choose from a comprehensive blood test, prostate specific antigen blood test (PSA), Hemoglobin A1-C, Vitamin D blood test, Colovantage or a combination of the five blood tests. The cost incurred by HSHS Holy Family Hospital for offering these discounted services was $1,431,105. In addition to the services provided on the day of the Health Fair, the hospital also performs the low-cost blood tests at several off-site locations including area schools, businesses, and manufacturers. Through the years, life-threatening and serious medical conditions have been discovered through testing performed in association with the Health Fair. Mary's Garden is a community teaching garden located on the campus of HSHS St. Mary's Hospital in Decatur, Illinois. The goals of the community garden are to improve community health and food accessibility for those in need, teach the younger generation sustainable gardening and offer a comprehensive, place-based approach to community health improvement. In FY2017 Mary's Garden became a living classroom for Eisenhower High School students who use the garden for interactive instruction on health and nutrition, science, mathematics, ecology and agriculture. Mary's Garden also provided opportunities for two apprentices to develop competencies and self-confidence to move into rural and urban farming/gardening leadership roles and launched a community-supported agriculture (CSA) program for colleagues. This created two jobs and is providing a model for turning dilapidated city lots into urban gardens. The hospital has engaged City officials about a job creation program and neighborhood revitalization."

First year funding by the hospital in FY2016 was used to create the position. In FY2018, the position will be solely funded by LCHC. SBIRT is an evidence-based practice designed to identify, reduce and prevent problematic use, abuse and dependence on drugs and alcohol. The creation of the SBIRT case manager position stems from Healthy Sheboygan County's 2020 Community Health Implementation Plan which was created following the Community Health Needs Assessment in 2014. Studies show that excessive use of alcohol and other drugs contributes to more than 70 diseases and leads to expensive, long-term health problems. Through early intervention, provided by the SBIRT case manager, the plan is to reduce costs and decrease the severity of drug and alcohol abuse. Advance medical knowledge HSHS works to advance medical knowledge by supporting research initiatives and educational opportunities. In FY2017, HSHS hospitals and affiliated physician groups contributed more than $21.5 million toward research and health professions education. Highlights of this commitment include subsidizing medical school residency programs, offering ongoing medical education to physicians and clinicians, and providing job shadowing programs for high school students. In southern Illinois, HSHS St. Joseph's Hospital in Breese, hosted members of the Health Occupations Students of America onsite to learn about job opportunities in health care from health care professionals. St. Joseph's also provided clinical experience for Kaskaskia College students enrolled in nursing, physical therapy and radiology programs. Pharmacy students have also completed their clinical training at St. Joseph's Hospital. In FY2017, the program served more than 200 students. In FY2017, HSHS St. Mary's Hospital Medical Center and HSHS St. Vincent Hospital in Green Bay invested more than $636,000 to provide onsite training and education of nurses and allied health professionals. In addition, the hospitals have been collaborating with the Medical College of Wisconsin to establish a community medical education program in Green Bay and to provide financial support to offset operating costs in FY2017. Also in eastern Wisconsin, HSHS St. Clare Memorial Hospital in Oconto Falls provided training for local paramedics and emergency response personnel through the hospital's EMS liaison program. Mission-driven and strategically implemented Community Benefit is an integral part of Hospital Sisters Health System's Mission. Our commitment to Community Benefit arises from our Catholic identity, Mission and Core Values shared by 14,000 colleagues across Illinois and Wisconsin. Through our work to improve access to health care services, enhance community health, advance medical knowledge, and relieve or reduce the burden of government, we believe we have made a positive difference in the quality of lives of tens of thousands of people in Illinois and Wisconsin in FY2017. As a Catholic health care ministry, HSHS is concerned with the dignity of all persons, the common good, and the stewardship of resources. We advocate for health care for all and work to improve social conditions that lead to improved health and well-being. We engage partners in our communities to improve health and quality of life and to reduce duplication. Working side- by-side with many faith communities, HSHS remains dedicated to our common purpose of compassionate care for all people."

Once verification of no coverage has been completed, the guarantors will be screened for charity or uninsured discounts based on income levels. Those guarantors who do not qualify for charity through the screening process will be asked to provide proof of income in the form of a recent pay stub and/or recent tax return to determine the level of uninsured discounting. If no proof of income is provided or a guarantor's income is greater than 201% of the federal poverty level, the appropriate discount according to the established criteria up to 600% of the federal poverty level will be applied. The amount of money not collected from those self-pay patients who are not eligible for charity care is reported as bad debt. Allowances for Doubtful Accounts have been recorded based on an historical matrix, using collectability percentages by payor and aging category in accordance with HSHS Executive Policy #F-23, Valuation of Net Accounts Receivable. Percentages are based on historical experience at the hospital and adjusted for known limitations.

Thus, the hospital's bad debt includes a portion that could be classified as charity care if application for such care was sought and/or completed."

Nonetheless, the Medicare program, in many cases, does not provide payment that covers the full cost of the care provided. Since it is the mission of the hospital to respond to community need, hospital management continually advocates for improved Medicare payment so that the cost of quality care to those patients who are not able to afford it is not compromised and is fairly subsidized by all payers. While this shortfall in Medicare payments is not classified as community benefit by the IRS, we nonetheless believe it is an important contribution made by the hospital to the health and well-being of the community. If the Medicare program did not exist, many Medicare patients would be eligible for charity care or other means-tested government programs. Further, by absorbing this payment shortfall and providing care below cost to these individuals, St. John's Hospital is relieving the burdens of the government. Accordingly, this shortfall restricts St. John's Hospital's ability to make funds available to provide for charity care and other community benefits. The hospital Medicare shortfall at cost for fiscal year 2017 was $25,766,145."

If the patient qualified for charity/community care for the full balance of their account, the entire amount is written off to charity/community care and hence no debt collection is pursued. If the patient qualified for charity/community care for a portion of their account balance, that portion is written off to charity/community care, with the patient being responsible for the remainder of the balance. Additionally, reasonable effort will be made to obtain third-party or government payer reimbursement on behalf of the patient. If those efforts are not fruitful, an offer will be extended to the patient to make installment payments on their balance. Only at such point that the patient defaults on installment payments or refuses to cooperate with the hospital's efforts to be reimbursed will the account be sent to collections."

In addition to conducting a Community Health Needs Assessment (CHNA) triennially per the provisions in the Affordable Care Act, the hospital routinely assesses the health care needs of the communities it serves in a variety of ways, including reviewing the health needs assessments of other health care organizations in our service area as well our local and state health departments and the United Way. We continually review primary data such as hospital and emergency department utilization and patient surveys as well as secondary data from our county and state public health departments, the Centers for Disease Control, County Health Rankings, and the Behavioral Risk FS Survey to name a few. On occasion, we will also collect primary data through telephone and electronic survey instruments. In addition to ongoing primary and secondary data collection and analysis, the hospital regularly assesses the health care needs of the communities it serves through feedback received from its internal assessment team, assessment advisory team, hospital leadership, Strategy department and hospital Board members. As part of the three-year Implementation Plan, the hospital shares its progress toward achieving its short and long term indicators in various community venues such as town hall meetings, community forums, and Chamber of Commerce.

Available on SJS website is information about how to read and understand the billing information on payment assistance, billing procedures and explanation of Medicare forms. Signage indicating that Financial Assistance is available is located at hospital patient access points. HSHS St. John's Hospital's website provides an explanation of Medicare forms at https://hshs.patientsimple.com/app/index.html#/articles/index?sid=Financial-Assistance_Help-With-Your-Medical-Bills. The organization has a representative on site to assist patients who may be eligible for Medicaid assistance through the Illinois Department of Healthcare and Family Services. They work with patients to determine if they may be eligible, and if so, assist in pulling together the necessary application for submission. Patients are also provided a Fair Billing Act notification at the point of registration regarding separate physician billing they can expect to receive, plus information about the patient's financial responsibility if their insurance plan is out of network. One-on-one conversations to educate patients about financial assistance often stem from patients receiving a statement or a pre-collection letter. At that point, the customer service representative or cashier, or other qualified staff, will inform/educate the caller about financial assistance options. The first pre-collection letter reminds the patient their account is in delinquent status. It also informs them they may be eligible for financial assistance through the organization's charity care program. The letter provides direct contact information to begin the application process for charity care and lists the Internet address where the policy can be obtained. A system called Search America is now being utilized after failed attempts made by the hospital to work out payment arrangements. That system accesses credit and other information and allows us to see the probability of a patient being able to pay their bill. After assessing that information, the hospital determines whether to grant charity care or continue collection efforts."

The total primary and secondary service area of the hospital has a population of 425,189 people, 200,580 people from Sangamon County and 224,609 people from the surrounding counties. Additionally, St. John's provides tertiary care to residents of Bond, Brown, Clay, Coles, De Witt, Effingham, Fayette, Greene, Marion, Mason, Moultrie, Piatt, Pike, Schuyler and Shelby counties. Aside from the city of Springfield, the economy of St. John's service area is primarily rural and is supported by small businesses, industries, mining and agriculture. Springfield, on the other hand, is an urban area supported by large businesses, such as the State of Illinois and other industries. Based on 2014 population estimates derived from the 2010 census, Sangamon County's population of 200,580 people is comprised of 83.04 percent Caucasians, 12.9 percent African Americans, 0.21 percent American Indians/Alaska Natives, 1.79 percent Asians, 0.02 percent Native Hawaiians/Other Pacific Islanders, 0.57 percent people stating another race and 2.3 percent people stating two or more races. Thirty percent of Sangamon County's residents have a high school diploma, 8.54 percent hold an associate's degree, 19.64 percent have a bachelor's degree, 7.78 percent hold a master's degree and 3.56 percent have a professional school degree or doctorate degree.

Within HSHS St. John's Hospital's service area 17.12 percent of the population is living below the Federal Poverty Level (FPL). This is higher than the statewide poverty level of 15 percent. This indicator is relevant because poverty creates barriers to access including health services, nutritional food and other necessities that contribute to poor health status. HSHS St. John's Hospital employs more than 2,300 people and is a regional medical center and the flagship hospital of Hospital Sisters Health System. Dedicated to providing exceptional care to the whole patient, St. John's offers services spanning from primary care to complex tertiary care, including a Level I Trauma Center, a Birth Center, a Cancer Institute, a Children's Hospital, a Neurosciences Institute, a Pain Management Center, Prairie Heart Institute, a Regional Wound Care Center, a Sleep Center and many others.

201801319349303685,370661238,"Schedule H, Part VI, Line 5 Promotion of community health","As a healing ministry of the Catholic Church and an affiliate of Hospital Sisters Health System HSHS St. John's Hospital is committed to delivering high quality, compassionate, and cost-effective health care services to all. The hospital was founded more than 140 years ago to bring a healing presence and improve the health of our community, especially for those persons who are sick, poor, and disadvantaged. Because of the hospital's purpose and tradition, it is organized to promote the health of Springfield and surrounding areas. The hospital is governed by a Board of Directors, of whom a majority reside in the hospital's primary service area and who are neither employees nor independent contractors of the hospital (nor family members thereof). The Board ensures that HSHS St. John's Hospital is responding to community need. In FY2016, for example, the Board reviewed the Community Health Needs Assessment and approved an Implementation Plan for addressing selected health focus areas. Consistent with its exempt purpose, HSHS St. John's Hospital has an open medical staff with privileges available to all qualified physicians in the area. The hospital also operates an emergency department that is open 24 hours to all persons regardless of their ability to pay. As a not-for-profit hospital, HSHS St. John's Hospital reinvests surplus funds to support the mission of the organization and health of the community rather than distributing surplus funds as profits to shareholders or individuals. Funds not committed to ongoing operations are generally used to upgrade facilities, secure new technologies, improve patient care, provide medical education and conduct medical research and support initiatives designed to promote health and ensure access for all. HSHS St. John's Hospital also devotes significant resources to access for patients who cannot afford care, along with other community benefits. In FY 2017 St. John's Hospital provided more than $35 million in Community Benefit services, including charity care at cost, unpaid costs of Medicaid and other public programs, and a range of diverse programs designed to enhance access and improve community health. Additionally, in FY2017 St. John's Hospital provided $2.1 million (at cost) in uncompensated care to patients who did not qualify for charity care or public assistance and more than $25.8 million (at cost) in excess of Medicare payment for health care services. St. John's Hospital provides a range of Community Benefit activities and programs that further our mission and long-standing commitment to our community. In many cases, these Community Benefit initiatives would not exist without the leadership role played by St. John's Hospital and they often relieve a burden that would otherwise be carried by government. The hospital's FY2015 Community Health Needs Assessment (CHNA) surfaced the following health focus areas to be addressed by the hospital in collaboration with other hospitals and community organizations: ACCESS TO HEALTH CARE: Populations to be served include high-risk, underserved, uninsured vulnerable populations in Sangamon County. Strategies selected for this priority will provide one-on-one skilled assistance to identify needs and wrap needed services around clients. Services can include basic needs such as transportation, housing, jobs, life skills training, food access, etc.; or medical services including healthcare visits, insurance assistance, disability assistance, mental health access, etc. Strategies Identified: We created a community health worker program to increase access to health care and coordination of care for residents of Enos Park Neighborhood. As part of this program our Community Health Workers developed an Enos Park Neighborhood Advisory Council and Providers Alliance to drive health changes and improved health outcomes. Community Health Workers assist with the development of personal health care action plan and care coordination. Outcomes: In the first three years of this program, we have realized 93% engagement by 300 clients. Services rendered include basic needs and health care access. Sixteen individuals or families were taken off the streets and placed in affordable, safe housing. Of the 35 parolees with whom we worked, we achieved an 18% recidivism rate compared to 60% nationwide. The only reason our parolees went back to prison was because of lack of a job or lack of housing. One-hundred percent of our clients saw a primary care provider and 84% were connected to a medical home. This program is being replicated to a second location in Sangamon County's eastside where our most vulnerable, low-income and underserved populations exist. Ongoing anticipated outcomes of this program include: 1. Increase number of insured residents in Sangamon County. 2. Increase use of well-visits and preventive care visits through education on insurance plan and benefits. 3. Increase number of individuals who have a primary care provider. 4. Improve health outcomes and quality of life for individuals participating in access initiatives. 5. Better management of chronic conditions and other health conditions. 6. Decrease use of Emergency Department for non-emergent care. 7. Decrease hospitalization for ambulatory sensitive conditions. MENTAL HEALTH: Populations to be served include high-risk, underserved, vulnerable populations in Sangamon County; strategies developed will also focus on increasing knowledge and appropriate care amongst health care providers. Services will include a behavioral health specialist placed in a very low-income school. Ninety-six percent of students attending McClernand Elementary School qualify for the free lunch program. Thirty percent of students are considered homeless. To meet the need identified in our community, and particularly, at this school, we placed a behavioral health specialist at the elementary school. The Behavioral Health Specialist works closely with school teachers and the school to increase access to mental health screening, intervention and educational services. In spring 2017 Trauma Informed Care (TIC) training was introduced to health, social and behavioral services colleagues. HSHS St. John's Hospital provided training to 153 individuals. The trainings taught professionals how to use a person's history to better inform them of the patient/client's current condition and reactions. PEDIATRIC ASTHMA: Populations to be served include high-risk, underserved, uninsured vulnerable populations in Brandon Court which includes subsidized housing units. According to heat maps created from St. John's ED data there is a high number of 'super-users' utilizing the ED for unmanaged chronic conditions. In this area specifically, these 'super-users' are between the ages of 0-5. St. John's has partnered with SIU School of Medicine and Springfield Community Federation to create an asthma home assessment program for Brandon Court. Twenty-five families were enrolled in the study which provided each family with a home assessment, trigger reduction plan and weekly home visits for three months. Ongoing objectives include: * Decrease school absenteeism due to uncontrolled asthma through parent and student education around quick relief vs. long-term control inhaler use. * Better management of asthma in the pediatric population. * Partner with existing community groups to mobilize resources and streamline interventions to increase capacity for improved outcomes. * Develop data-driven, neighborhood-specific interventions based on an analysis of patient data for pediatric asthma hospitalizations and Emergency Department visits where asthma was a primary or secondary diagnosis. Anticipated Outcomes: 1. Reduce allergen levels in indoor environments. 2. Reduce misuse of emergency inhaler in schools. 3. Improve school attendance in children with chronic asthma. 4. Increase use of well-visits and preventive care visits through education on insurance plan and benefits. 5. Better management of asthma. 6. Decrease use of Emergency Department for non-emergent care. 7. Decrease hospitalization for ambulatory sensitive conditions. OVERWEIGHT AND OBESITY: Populations to be served include broader community and high-risk, underserved, uninsured vulnerable populations in Sangamon County. We are continuing the Gotta Dance initiatives to increase the number of physical activity minutes for children in school and at home as well as improve a child's overall mental and emotional function."
201801319349303685,370661238,"Schedule H, Part VI, Line 6 Affiliated health care system","HSHS St. John's Hospital is an affiliate of Hospital Sisters Health System (HSHS), a health care ministry that includes 15 hospitals, numerous community-based health centers and clinics, and hundreds of physician partners across Illinois and Wisconsin. The mission of HSHS is ""to reveal and embody Christ's healing love for all people through our high-quality Franciscan health care ministry."" We live our mission by providing holistic healing to all who seek our care, as well as through Community Benefit. In tandem with others in the communities we serve, our Community Benefit initiatives are strategically increasing access to care, improving the health status of residents, and increasing medical education and knowledge. In FY2017, our hospitals responded to the top needs identified in each of their most recent Community Health Needs Assessments (CHNAs). The information gathered from these assessments was used to develop or enhance Community Benefit programs and services to best address community health needs. Among the priority needs identified in the most recent CHNA process were access to care; alcohol, tobacco, and other drug abuse; chronic disease prevention and management; nutrition/wellness; mental health; and oral health. HSHS hospitals are proactively addressing these and other needs through patient, provider and community education, preventative screenings, self-management classes, and new or enhanced clinical services. In FY2017, HSHS collectively provided $197.6 million in Community Benefit (9.2% of total hospital expenses). This amount included $26.0 million provided for Financial Assistance (a.k.a. Charity Care) and $128.6 million for unreimbursed care provided as part of the Medicaid program. In addition, HSHS hospitals committed significant resources to treat Medicare patients. The cost of providing services to primarily elderly beneficiaries of the Medicare program - in excess of governmental and managed care contract payments - was $205.9 million. HSHS hospitals also recorded $40.9 million in uncollectible accounts. While HSHS does not count the latter two amounts as Community Benefit, they nonetheless reflect our commitment to serving all persons in need of care. In addition to the dollars invested in our Community Benefit programs, HSHS continues to reinvest any surplus revenue from operations and investments into new medical technology, facility infrastructure and health care services in our communities. By doing so, we ensure our ability to meet the ongoing demand for high quality, efficient and easily accessible health care. Improve access to health care As a Franciscan health care ministry, HSHS is deeply committed to serving those who are most in need with a special focus on the poor and vulnerable. We not only provide care to every patient who walks through our doors, but also reach out beyond the walls of our hospitals and clinics to care for those in our communities. Our efforts to ensure residents in the communities we serve receive the right care, at the right time, and in the right setting involve collaborating with others to achieve this goal. Across our two-state System, there are numerous examples of partnerships with departments of public health, other health care facilities and community and social service organizations to enhance access to care for those in need. In FY2017, HSHS and our 15 hospitals dedicated Community Benefit resources to educate uninsured persons about enrollment opportunities in affordable health care coverage and to facilitate the enrollment process. Studies have shown that people without insurance are more likely to postpone care and develop more severe and expensive conditions than their insured counterparts. It is for this reason that the Catholic Church, Catholic health care and HSHS have long promoted ""coverage and access for all."" HSHS and our 15 hospitals in partnership with local health departments, social service agencies and other health care providers played a vital role in educating eligible people in their service areas, by referring people to Certified Application Counselors and/or in enrolling them in the health insurance exchanges, or by helping them to obtain coverage through Medicaid expansion. In southern Illinois, HSHS St. Elizabeth's Hospital in Belleville is committed to improving access to health care services by assisting eligible patients to enroll in health care plans. In FY2017, more than 3,200 patients were screened and 74% met eligibility criteria and were enrolled in Medicaid. Access to health care is not limited to insurance coverage and access to primary care providers. In FY2017, the hospital assisted patients with access to medications, durable medical equipment, and transportation including more than $5,600 in cab and bus tickets for patients and $14,000 for patients who needed transfer by ambulance. In response to its FY2015 CHNA, HSHS St. John's Hospital in Springfield, Illinois established a community health worker program to increase access to health care and coordination of care for residents of the Enos Park Neighborhood. The hospital also helped establish an Enos Park Neighborhood Advisory Council and Providers Alliance as part of the access collaborative to drive behavior changes and improve health outcomes. In the first three years, the program has realized 93% engagement of 300 clients. Services rendered include basic needs and health care access. Sixteen formally homeless individuals or families were placed in affordable, safe housing. Of the 35 parolees in the program, the recidivism rate was only 18% compared to 60% nationwide. The only reason participating parolees went back to prison was because of lack of a job or housing. One-hundred percent of our clients saw a primary care provider and 84% were connected to a medical home. This program is being replicated in a second location in Sangamon County's eastside where our most vulnerable, low-income and underserved populations exist. Through the support of HSHS St. Mary's Hospital Medical Center and St. Vincent Hospital in Green Bay, the Oral Health Partnership (OHP) continues to expand to communities throughout Brown County, providing dental care to 0 - 19 year olds who are uninsured or underinsured. In FY2017, more than 12,000 general dentistry procedures, including exams, X-rays, cleanings, fillings, and crowns, were completed for youth in Brown County's smaller, less urban communities, and more than 1,300 preventative sealants were applied. OHP serves more than 9,000 kids each year through three fixed-site clinics and the traveling school-based program. In January 2017, OHP's West location was opened in response to data showing an unmet need of medical assistance children in the Ashwaubenon area. This clinic, along with the traveling school-based team, will help OHP and HSHS reach the goal of expanding services to a wider population of Brown County children in need. HSHS St. Francis Hospital in Litchfield, Illinois collaborated with Lewis & Clark Community College and local dental providers to bring the College's mobile dental health unit to the Litchfield area; the unit provides free or low cost dental exams and screenings, x-rays and hygiene services. In addition, three local dental providers also participated by opening their offices and donating time, staff and supplies to provide either a free filling, extraction or hygiene services. Beginning in 2015, the hospital collaborated with Catholic Charities to launch a dental voucher program. Five dentists in Macoupin and Montgomery counties participate in the program, which covers an initial exam and x-rays, one tooth extraction and up to three fillings per year per individual. The percentage of total emergency department visits related to dental issues has decreased from 2.2% in 2011 to .95% in 2016 because of this collaboration. In southeast Illinois, area residents can get help filling a prescription through the long-term collaboration between HSHS St. Anthony's Memorial Hospital in Effingham and Catholic Charities. In FY2017, St. Anthony's Memorial Hospital helped to underwrite the cost of prescription medications for 246 residents. St. Anthony's Memorial Hospital and Catholic Charities believe no one should be without prescriptions because of the inability to pay."

For this program, Rush utilizes data received from a third party vendor to determine whether the patient's income meets the income threshold. Charges for services rendered to patients meeting this threshold are written off in full prior to a bill being sent to the patient. A patient may also be eligible for presumptive charity care if the patient is eligible for Medicaid for other dates of service or services deemed non-covered by Medicaid; the patient is enrolled in, or eligible for, an assistance program for low income individuals; or the patient is homeless, deceased with no estate, or mentally incapacitated with no one to act on the patient's behalf. Patients not qualifying for Presumptive Charity Care, may also complete an application to determine eligibility under Rush's Charity Care and Limited Income Programs identified in the Financial Assistance Policy. Both programs are income-based but also utilize an asset test to determine eligibility. Patients meeting the asset test whose income is 201-300% of FPG qualify for 100% discount to their hospital bill; patients meeting the asset test whose income is 301-400% FPG qualify for a 75% discount to their hospital bill.

201801349349301940,362174823,"Part II, Community Building Activities:","Rush has been particularly focused on its community building activities, as in the year 2016-2017 Rush adopted a community anchor mission with the West Side Anchor Committee (WSAC) and also helped form the West Side Total Health Collaborative (WSTHC). The two initiatives have spun off of Rush's effort in the collaborative Community Health Needs Assessment process with the Alliance for Health Equity, including the Cook County and Chicago Departments of Public Health. WSAC and WSTHC both are new collaborative approaches to address community health improvement and community building on Chicago's West Side into the suburbs of Oak Park, River Forest, and Forest Park. The following narrative describes some of these areas of focus, though there will be some connection between community health improvement and community building. Economic developmentRush has been actively engaged in the economic development of the West Side of Chicago and neighborhoods that need more commitment to their economies for many years. Through Rush's work with CASE, Chicago Anchors for a Strong Economy, Rush has targeted its focus on economic opportunity and investment in more vulnerable communities. In addition, through the newly adopted anchor mission, Rush is helping invest in the West Side, particularly with local businesses - especially in communities such as Austin, which is a bridge community of 100,000 people between Rush University and Rush Oak Park. From bringing new local organizations into our hospital to sell their products/goods as an economic engine, to developing a survey about local needs with the economy/services needed on the West Side, to investing some of our balance sheet into Community Development Financial Institutions - Rush is making a clear commitment and change. Environmental improvementsOver the past year, Rush has been thinking about the environment as health. Rush has begun to think about its footprint, and how we as an organization can support improvement in regard to the environment. The Rush Oak Park Hospital Green Team has been in existence for some time, and helps the organization think about improvements. This recently expanded and a Green Team was also created at Rush University Medical Center. Rush was an early adopter of smoke-free policies for the health campuses, took on some requirements to think about construction policies and the green footprint, our recent hospital tower is LEED Gold, and Rush actually began to develop a clean air policy for the system in 2017 as a commitment to the West Side. In addition, Rush recognizes the importance of environment on our patients, as respiratory conditions are of particular need such as asthma, which is often triggered by environment. Coalition BuildingRush is proud to be a convener of coalitions to build community and improve health, but also to be a strong partner at the table. As mentioned, Rush was actively involved in our effort to be part of Alliance for Health Equity, of which we helped lead to develop our Community Health Needs Assessment and develop work around our Community Health Implementation Plan. In addition, Rush helped form in 2017 the West Side Total Health Collaborative, which is a West Side place based initiative, with a mission ""to build community health and economic wellness on Chicago's West Side and build healthy, vibrant neighborhoods"". This organization has been forming with hospitals, health organizations, community based organizations, and other partners on the West Side. In addition, Rush has been part of the Coalition of Hope, which is a faith based coalition to improve health. Rush also helped form the West Side Anchor Committee, with particular focus to buy and source locally, hire inclusively and develop talent, invest locally, and volunteer/support community building. These four pillars have been adopted by the West Side Anchor Committee, which includes Rush, Presence, Loretto, UI Health, Lurie Children's, Illinois Medical District, and the Cook County Health and Hospitals System.Leadership Development / Training for Community MembersRush is committed to providing leadership development and training for our community members. For example, Rush is committing to developing trauma based training around adverse childhood events for community partners such as churches. Rush is thinking about how trauma impacts our west side communities and wants community members to feel well suited to tackle this need. Workforce DevelopmentRush is committing to training and developing individuals to both ready them for the workforce and enhance opportunity. This includes Rush's involvement from years ongoing, such as being a training lead for our colleagues including physicians, nurses, social workers, navigators/community health workers and so forth in the Medical Home Network Accountable Care Organization - this 3 hospital, 9, federally qualified health system partnership is an ACO that is proving to be very successful. Rush provides the continuing education for this important workforce who are serving Medicaid patients in Cook County. In addition, Rush helps with workforce development through programs like One Summer Chicago, and InRoads, where Rush (throughout both hospitals) provides internships/jobs for students. In addition, Rush has committed to enhancing pipeline programs for our employees to grow their careers and is also hiring more individuals from the West Side, as our focus groups through WSTHC demonstrated in the ""What We Heard Report"", a report of ongoing community need and focus groups across our communities, that jobs are of particular need and desire."
201801349349301940,362174823,"Part III, Line 2:","The cost for the total bad debt provision of $35,630,686 was calculated using the FY17 As-Filed Medicare Cost Report as a source for computing an overall cost-to-charge ratio. This reduces the bad debt expense of $35,630,686 to cost of $11,427,837. Due to the process that Rush and other hospitals must facilitate to prove a patient's eligibility for discounted or free care, the precise amount of charity care often can be indistinguishable from other categories of uncompensated care. Without the cooperation of the patient in providing appropriate documentation, Rush cannot correctly distinguish patients who meet the defined charity care policies and appropriately categorize those individuals as charity care write-offs. Instead these patient cases can be classified as bad debt write-offs due to a lack of support information. This can create a situation in which patient scan be mistakenly classified as bad debt that could actually be classified as charity care, but cannot be confirmed. As a matter of policy, this wouldn't happen, but can on occasion."

201801349349301940,362174823,"Part VI, Line 3:","In keeping with RUMC's mission to provide comprehensive, coordinated health care services to our patients, RUMC offers several financial assistance programs to help patients with their hospital bill.Through utilization of a patient eligibility service RUMC is extremely proactive in enrolling patients, who present for service without insurance coverage, for coverage under various state and federal programs. The maintenance of this service for our patients has a significant impact on decreasing the amount of charity care provided and ensuring that patients have the opportunity to obtain insurance. In addition to achieving appropriate, available coverage for our patients' medical services, this eligibility service also obtains eligibility for SSI or SSA benefits for applicable patients. Guiding the patient through this often time-consuming and arduous process is extremely beneficial to the patient, as once SSI/SSA eligibility is approved, the patient will begin receiving a monthly assistance check which provided a benefit well beyond their health care at RUMC.To assist the patient in deciding which is the right program for them, RUMC offers the services of Financial Counselors and Billing Customer Service Representatives. These individuals will assist patients in completion of financial application forms, obtaining an estimated cost of anticipated hospital services, providing an explanation and copy of their hospital bill, and notary services. RUMC makes all financial assistance information and policies available on the hospital's website."
201801349349301940,362174823,"Part VI, Line 4:","Rush provides patient care services to a much broader audience than is defined in its Community Health Needs Assessment (CHNA), but Rush defines its respective community as the West Side of Chicago and near city suburbs of Oak Park, Forest Park, and River Forest. Rush purposely chose to define its community for the CHNA as the geographic area between the two hospitals because this is an area of great need and some hardship and we are in their backyard. Rush's patient population is varied in regard to ethnicity, economic status and insurance status, but many on the west side face hardship and are members of more vulnerable populations - racial/ethnic minorities, lower socio-economic status, crowded housing, higher levels of joblessness and less access to education, transportation, and other community resources such as grocery stores and healthcare centers. Rush's defined community, most specifically the West Side of Chicago, while incredibly resilient, faces some of the greatest hardship and health disparities in the City of Chicago - Rush hopes to serve as an anchor to alleviate some of these issues through the empowerment of communities and the wonderful individuals that call the West Side home. Some of the general population demographics are that we are seeing a great deal of diversity in our communities served. For example, there are approximately 500,000 people living in our defined west sides communities. The racial / ethnic breakdowns of our communities are quite diverse, with Austin, West and East Garfield Park, and North Lawndale averaging at least 85% of the population identifying as black, South Lawndale and Lower West Side being over 80% Hispanic/Latino and Forest Park, Oak Park, and River Forest being more varied, with whites making up the majority. We also recognize that there are a great number of youth in our communities, with 19 and under making up in some communities close to a third of the population.The City of Chicago's hardship index ranks each community area's socioeconomic hardship on a scale of 0-100, with a higher number representing a greater level of hardship. The index measures: socioeconomic indicators of public health significance; the percentage of occupied housing units with more than one person per room; the percentage of households living below the federal poverty level; the percentage of people over 16 who are unemployed; the percentage of people over 25 without a high school diploma; the percentage of the population that is under 18 or over 64; per capita income. We know that most of our communities fall under the definition of ""high hardship"" in particular East Garfield Park, West Garfield Park, Austin, North Lawndale, South Lawndale, Lower West Side, and Austin.Some highlighted demographic information of our respective communities is that they face some of the greatest hardship in the City of Chicago. For example, life expectancy varies widely on the West Side of Chicago, as if you travel from the Loop to the West Side, in particular the West Garfield Park Community, life expectancy goes from 85 years to just under 69 years. If you look at issues such as insurance status, we have some of the highest need communities, with 34.8% of the population in South Lawndale lacking health insurance. Income segregation and employment is also of high need in some of our areas, with North Lawndale having a median household income of $23,066 and an unemployment rate of 27.4 in West Garfield Park. There are many other hospitals serving these communities, but we know that access to care and community resources is still of great need and that we must work together to improve the health of our communities. Based on market scan and our community health needs assessment, we have identified 15+ hospitals located in our communities. For more information on our neighborhood breakdowns and specific demographic information, please visit our FY17-FY19 CHNA at https://www.rush.edu/sites/default/files/rush-chna-2016.pdf and the community health needs assessment plan at https://www.rush.edu/sites/default/files/community-health-implementation-plan.pdf"
201801349349301940,362174823,"Part VI, Line 5:","RUMC has provided high quality services to underserved populations for many years through ongoing successful community-based programs and partnerships. Examples include opening the Rush Adolescent Family (AFC) center 42 years ago to provide reproductive health care, prenatal care and pregnancy prevention services to underserved adolescents. Over 25 years ago, Rush opened two school health centers at Chicago Public Schools (CPS) to provide safety-net care to vulnerable adolescents living in high poverty communities. These health centers continue to thrive and Rush has added a third school health center at a school for pregnant and/or parenting girls in sixth through twelfth grade. The Science and Math Excellence (SAME) network was started over 25 years ago to narrow the gap in math and science test scores between schools on the South and West sides of Chicago and schools in more affluent neighborhoods. Another example of Rush's commitment is the development of Rush Community Service Initiative Program (RCSIP) 26 years ago. This all volunteer program was developed to meet the health needs of Chicago's West side residents.RUMC is a founding member of the Medical Home Network Accountable Care Organization. The Medical Home Network (MHN) Accountable Care Organization (ACO) spawned out of the Medical Home Network, a 501c3 data and technology collaborative founded by the Comer Science and Education Foundation to address problems accessing health care in populations with Medicaid living on Chicago's South and Southwest sides. The goal of both the MHN and MHN ACO is to collaborate to transform the current care delivery system to improve patient care coordination and access to health care services, while reducing cost and fragmentation. The MHN ACO consists of three west side hospitals (including Rush University Medical Center) and nine Federally Qualified Health Centers. Rush takes a leadership role in the MHN through board representation, providing the Better Care Teams education program to MHN clinicians and more recently by providing complex care coordination for the most at-risk MHN patients within the ACO covered lives panel of 80,000+ patients.RUMC and the Cook County Health and Hospitals System collaborated to create the Ruth M. Rothstein CORE Center in 1998. The CORE Center is the nation's first public-private outpatient facility dedicated to the care of people with HIV/AIDS. Today, it is the largest, most comprehensive provider of HIV/AIDS treatment in the Midwest. Faculty members from Rush and Stroger Hospital work side-by-side delivering care to this population. The Center also serves patients with tuberculosis, hepatitis and other infectious diseases. Clinical research projects at the center seek new answers in screening, treating and halting the spread of infectious diseases.RUMC is also a founding and active member of the Illinois Medical District Hospital Emergency Preparedness Coalition (IMD HEPC). The mission of this coalition is to create and maintain a community wide emergency management interoperability within one of the nation's largest urban healthcare, educational, research and technology districts resulting in minimal loss of life and reduced collateral damage to surrounding structures and the environment during a disaster.This past year, RUMC provided over 12,200 clinic visits to the most at-risk underserved populations through numerous community based programs and partnerships at no charge to the patients."
201801349349301940,362174823,"Part VI, Line 5","Additional Community Partnerships and Programs Rush maintains many partnerships and programs in order to improve the health of the communities that we serve. Some of these important partnerships and programs, which relate to our community benefit for the enterprise, are listed below.Alliance for Health EquityFormerly known as the Health Impact Collaborative of Cook County, this is a partnership between the Illinois Public Health Institute hospitals, health departments, and community organizations across Chicago and Cook County. This initiative is one of the largest collaborative hospital-community partnerships in the country with the current involvement of 25+ nonprofit and public hospitals, seven local health departments, and representatives of more than 100 community organizations serving on action teams. Partners are coming together with the goal to collectively address community health needs to achieve greater impact. Rush is an inaugural member and is represented on the Steering Committee by Raj Shah, Co-Director, Center for Community Health Equity, Christopher Nolan, Manager of Community Benefit and Population Health, and Darlene Oliver Hightower, Associate Vice President of Community Engagement and Practice.Blood Drives In collaboration with the American Red Cross (ARC), Rush hosts blood drives within the hospitals. The Donate Life event invites all of Rush and the public to join us in one convenient location to participate and sign-up for the National Marrow Donor Program (NMDP), Organ and Tissue Registration, Rush Blood and Platelet donor programs and ARC Blood Drive. By providing a central location as well as employee and student volunteers for these events, Rush provides a much needed life resources to the people of Chicago and beyond. In FY17, approximately 373 whole blood units were collected.Building Healthy Urban Communities The Building Healthy Urban Communities project is a public-private partnership between Rush, Malcolm X College (MXC), and the Medical Home Network (MHN), funded through a $5 million dollar grant from BMO Harris Bank to create healthier urban communities. The goals of this project are to improve education, employment, and health outcomes of the underserved West Side and South Side communities of Chicago served by Rush. This is being achieved through creating new models of care that focus on interprofessional teams and proactive care coordination, developing and training a workforce from the community that supports these new models of care, and rigorously measuring and evaluating each project component for sustainability and replication. One of the major focuses of this project is developing and training a workforce to deliver high value population-based health care. Embedding training opportunities within existing models of care will improve quality, efficiency, and reduce costs. There are five components of workforce development that include the Rush Community Investments Initiative, and Curriculum Development for Allied Health Professionals, Scholarships for Rush Bachelor of Science in Health Sciences, Continuing Education Training for existing healthcare providers, and Health Disparities Research and Evaluation Fellowships. These components target different types and levels of the healthcare workforce thus creating a pipeline of educational programs. The program components are described in further detail below. Charitable ContributionsCharitable Contributions are a series of donations to community based organizations and nonprofits determined by the Senior Leadership Team on behalf of Rush. The funds are intended to support various community initiatives and events throughout the fiscal year. In FY17, Rush funds were donated to 23 organizations totaling approximately $283,641. Chicago Healthcare System Coalition for Preparedness and Response Since 2008, Rush has been an active member of the Hospital Preparedness Program (HPP), administered by the Department of Health and Human Services. The HPP's mission is to improve the ability of hospitals and healthcare systems to respond to public health emergencies. The heart of the HPP is the Chicago Healthcare System Coalition for Preparedness and Response (CHSCPR). The purpose of the CHSCPR is to develop plans to unify, coordinate and manage emergency planning and response for the healthcare system within the City of Chicago. During a planned event or unplanned disaster or emergency, the CHSCPR participates and supports response efforts in coordination with the Chicago Department of Public Health [CDPH]. The support shall be in the form of sharing information and subject matter expertise that will enhance emergency preparedness capacity and proficiency across the healthcare system during emergencies. In June 2012, the HPP aligned with the Public Health Emergency Preparedness (PHEP) grant program to develop capabilities based processes targeting disaster preparedness and resiliency at the community level. The functional units of CHSCPR are working committees, which address HPP - PHEP capabilities. The committees are led by co-chairs chosen through an application process by the CHSCPR's executive committee. Rush has been actively involved in this program by co-chairing the Medical Surge Capability which has been divided into three distinct committees: Pediatrics Planning Committee, Crisis Standards of Care Planning Committee and Behavioral Health Committee.Continuing Education Training for existing healthcare providers Continuing Education Training is being offered to existing care coordinators, outreach workers, and clinicians at federally qualified health centers within the Medical Home Network Accountable Care Organization, to prepare them for future healthcare needs. The modules offered include motivational interview training, leading change, mental health first aid, and disease-specific trainings. Approximately 850 clinicians and care team members have been trained so far.Curriculum Development for Allied Health Professionals A competency and assessment based basic certificate program for community health workers (CHW) has been launched at Malcolm X College in fall 2014. The goal is to allow students graduating from these programs to enroll and transfer credits to a bachelors program, thus creating career ladders for these students. We have had a completion rate of 56% from the first cohort of the CHW basic certificate program.Extreme Weather AssistanceIn conjunction with the Village of Oak Park, ROPH offers space in its emergency room for those without adequate air conditioning or heat in instances of extreme temperatures. This effort helps prevent hypothermia and frostbite in extreme cold; and heat stroke and other heat-related illnesses when the thermometers spike. Health Disparities Research and Evaluation Fellowships The Health Disparities Fellowship program is designed to develop a cadre of well-trained health care researchers with a passion for creating sustainable ways for providing access to high-quality care for individuals in underserved communities. The fellowship targets individuals with PhDs, MDs, and other terminal degrees with a strong foundation in research methods and knowledge of the health care field. Expertise in health services research, epidemiology, bioinformatics, community health, public health, or health economics is preferred. These mentored fellowships involve development and evaluation of new ways to educate and deploy community-based providers, and evaluation of the new models of care in which they will be working. Fellowships span over a five-year period with a timeframe of two-three years for each cohort. The second cohort began their fellowships January of 2017. Each fellow has identified an area of research that is directly aligned with the priorities of community health and quality of life improvement, with a particular focus on the communities served by Rush. Their projects will focus on care coordination, mental health, social determinants of health, education program evaluation and career pathways. Within this first year of the fellowship the second cohort has completed 19 external presentations, and had 1 manuscript accepted for publication.Illinois Medical District Hospital Emergency Preparedness CoalitionRush is a founding and active member of the Illinois Medical District Hospital Emergency Preparedness Coalition (IMD HEPC). The mission of this coalition is to create and maintain a community wide emergency management within one of the nation's largest urban healthcare, educational, research and technology districts resulting in minimal loss of life and reduced collateral damage to surrounding structures and the environment during a disaster."

Most recently, MHN created the MHN Accountable Care Organization (MHN ACO), which is a partnership of 3 area hospitals (including Rush) and 9 Federally Qualified Health Centers (FQHCs) working to improve access, quality, and utilization for all of their primary care Medicaid patients enrolled in County Care. This new organization is utilizing best practices in the industry to reach the most vulnerable of patients and providing care coordination enhancements to improve the lives of their patients. Rush takes a leadership role in MHN in many ways. For example, Rush's CEO, Larry Goodman, MD, serves as co-chairman of the organization, and Rush's Senior Vice President, Business & Network Development and Vice President, Population Health both serve on the MHN ACO board. As an Academic Medical Center, Rush provides the Better Care Teams educational program to MHN ACO clinicians and to the entire ACO network with the Centralized Complex Care Coordination (4C) program. 4C at Rush is a dedicated wrap-around, interprofessional care team model, which aims to provide complex care coordination and management for the highest needs ACO network patients.Rush Community Investments Initiative A weekly student-led community program at Rush Wellness Center at Facing Forward is designed to offer health screening and health coaching to underserved women and children, and enhance students' ability to provide team-based care for diverse populations. There are approximately 13-16 participants in the program and about 22 student health coaches. The health coaches are formally trained in motivational interviewing. Within two years the outcomes of this initiative include 62% of participants lost an average of 11 pounds of weight, 79% participants said that the program motivated them to eat healthier, 50% said that the program motivated them to exercise more and 14% said that the program motivated them to reduce smoking.Rush Heart Walk The Rush University Hospital and ROPH Heart Walk team promotes heart health and associate camaraderie while raising lifesaving funds. For this event, Rush University Hospital and ROPH is closely aligned with the American Heart Association's mission of building healthier lives free of cardiovascular diseases and stroke. Our partnership is evidenced in our patient care, community education and employee wellness programs, and Heart Walk participation. Rush University Hospital and ROPH employees raised over $118,465 for this cause this past year with Rush contributing through providing internal resources for the annual Heart Walk.Rush TeleStroke Network The Rush TeleStroke Network consists of eleven community hospitals throughout the Chicago region and Rush University Medical Center. The network provides access to vascular neurology services for ischemic stroke patients that present in one of our affiliate emergency rooms 24-hours a day, seven days a week, 365 days a year. Board-certified vascular neurologists from the Rush Stroke Program assess patients and help the affiliate emergency department physicians determine if a patient is a candidate for tissue plasminogen activator (tPA) through an FDA-cleared telemedicine platform. Telemedicine allows consulting physicians to speak face-to-face with patients and their families, as well as remote clinical staff. The telemedicine assessment includes reviewing CT scans and vital signs, and the high-definition camera allows the Rush neurologist to even view a patient's pupils. The physician has access to the patient's medical information through an electronic health record. Within minutes, the stroke neurologist, along with the remote clinical staff, can determine a plan of care and then turn over the treatment to the emergency physician or initiate a transfer if the patient requires advanced neurological care such as an endovascular procedure. This is particularly important, as time is of the essence, and this helps remove any transportation limitations for our patients to better serve the community. During FY17, the services provided by Rush health professionals through this 11-site network impacted the lives of over 800 patients.Ruth M. Rothstein CORE CenterRush and the Cook County Health and Hospitals System collaborated to create the Ruth M. Rothstein CORE Center in 1998. The CORE Center is the nation's first public-private outpatient facility dedicated to the care of people with HIV/AIDS. Today, it is the largest, most comprehensive provider of HIV/AIDS treatment in the Midwest. Faculty members from Rush and Stroger Hospital work side-by-side delivering care to this population. The Center also serves patients with tuberculosis, hepatitis and other infectious diseases. Clinical research projects at the center seek new answers in screening, treating and halting the spread of infectious diseases. In addition, Larry Goodman, MD, chief executive officer at Rush University Medical Center, serves on the Board of the CORE Foundation. The Foundation built the CORE Center and completed a major facility improvement project in 2012. Rush's partnership with CORE is particularly important. While HIV is now a manageable disease in which individuals can lead healthy lives, the disease persists. In its Healthy Chicago 2.0 strategy, the Chicago Department of Public Health specifically highlights goals to end transmission.Scholarships and Internships for Rush Bachelor of Science in Health Sciences Students In an attempt to create career ladders for individuals from low-income underserved communities, a ""pipeline program"" is funded through this project. Individuals from the Malcolm X City College can enroll and transfer credits to the Rush Bachelor of Science in Health Sciences program. These students are offered scholarships for two years. We have offered approximately $56,000 in scholarships over a period of two years.West Side Total Health CollaborativeKicked off in January 2017, the West Side Total Health Collaborative (WSTHC) is a collaborative effort that Rush helped incubate in response to our FY17-FY19 Community Health Needs Assessment (CHNA) and the health disparities that exist on Chicago's West Side. Through the CHNA, we learned that life expectancy gaps between the loop and under resourced areas on the West Side can are as high as 16 years. The mission of the West Side Total Health Collaborative is to build community health and economic wellness on Chicago's West Side. The vision of the WSTHC is to improve neighborhood health by addressing inequities in healthcare, education, economic vitality and the physical environment using a cross-sector, place-based strategy. Some of the partners include other healthcare providers, community based organizations, education providers, the faith community, business, government and residents of the community. The ultimate aim of the WSTHC is to reduce the life expectancy gap by 50 percent in the next 10 years.United Way of Metropolitan Chicago The United Way of Metropolitan Chicago seeks to assist local communities of greatest need around income, education and health - the building blocks to a good quality of life. Each year through the Rush United Way Campaign, Rush employees raise money through an annual campaign to support the United Way mission, focused on the social determinants of health for individuals and families across the Chicagoland region. In 2017, Rush University Hospital and ROPH employees donated $348,000 with Rush contributing through providing internal resources for Rush's United Way campaign. Rush was also honored by United Way for its incredibly successful campaign in 2017."

Rush spearheaded the SAME Network's first effort long before others recognized the importance of STEM (science, technology, engineering, and math) programs to improve education by raising funds from Chicago's business community to build state-of-the-art science laboratories in local schools that lacked these facilities. Since then, SAME has grown to become a collaboration between Rush and 22 elementary schools, many local businesses and several other educational organizations. Rush's dedication to promoting a healthy community has fostered a strong commitment to supporting the growth and development of our local neighborhoods. Each year SAME serves more than 600 students, teachers and parents. SAME includes the programs below.Early Childhood Enhancement Program (ECEP)In 1998, SAME developed its preschool program to introduce preschool children to science, math, and literacy skills. The program currently operates in 14 public and private schools. The goal of the SAME Preschool Program is to provide a stimulating environment for guiding children in the development of science, math, and literacy skills by providing science labs and materials appropriate for young children. Children begin to understand fundamental science concepts and develop inquiry skills by using their natural curiosity to motivate exploration of their surroundings. SAME offers workshops to parents of children participating in SAME Network sponsored preschool program. SAME believes early parental involvement is crucial for children to be successful in school. In FY17, the program served 632 students.College Preparatory Enrichment Program (CPEP)SAME collaborated on an enrichment program with Chicago Public Schools and Benedictine University in Lisle, Illinois. CPEP offers students an opportunity to participate in year-round after-school and summer learning activities. The intent of CPEP is to provide students with the experiences they need to pique their interest in science and math, pursue college entrance and, potentially, a science-related career. Students who participate in CPEP have the opportunity to become involved with the SAME High School Internship Program when they graduate from elementary school. The program is geared toward students entering fifth grade that also attend a SAME Network school. The students are recommended by their school principals and teachers because they show academic promise in the areas of science and math. During the summer, students are exposed to one or two week campus living at Benedictine University, which provides them with the experience of living away from home. Coupled with campus life, the students receive instruction in math, science, and technology. Field trips to educational institutions in the western suburbs and fun outings are a part of the experience. Students work independently, collaboratively, and cooperatively on inquiry-based science tasks emphasizing high-order thinking skills while integrating math and technology. Families also participate in a variety of activities throughout the year. In FY17, 283 students participated in this program.High School Internship ProgramSAME summer internship experiences to high school students. The objectives of SAME's internship program are to encourage students to pursue education and careers in math, science, and technology fields, provide students with hands-on experience, classes and mentoring; and develop good work habits, ethics and job readiness skills. A mentoring relationship was developed between the internship students and Rush's Health Systems Management faculty and staff. After graduating from high school, students are eligible to transition into the College Internship Program. Throughout high school, the students work at Rush in various departments. In FY17, the program served 56 students. College Internship ProgramThe College Internship Program supports SAME students from matriculation through college. Eligible students receive scholarship assistance and academic support. The students are given an opportunity to work at Rush in an area closely related to their career choice. The students return from colleges and universities across the United States during the holiday season and summer break to learn, work and interact with patients, peers, and management. College students receive mentoring through preceptor relationships with professionals at Rush University Hospital. During FY17, 16 college students benefited from this program. Chicago Public Schools Career and Technical Education Program Richard T. Crane Medical Preparatory High School (Crane) is part of the Chicago Pubic School (CPS) Career and Technical Education (CTE) Program established by the Cook County President's and the City of Chicago Mayor's offices to increase the number of Chicago's youth recruited into Chicago's healthcare workforce. Rush is a part of the CPS CTE program and partners with Crane. Through Rush Community Service Initiatives Program (RCSIP), Rush student and faculty volunteers provide mentorship and activities to facilitate the Crane students' efforts to successfully pursue their interest in health careers. CPS CTE activities are focused on awareness, exploration, and application of the health sciences. In addition to mentorship and educational services to all students at Crane, over 120 first-year high school students had paid healthcare related internships at Rush this past year. Malcolm X College Partnership Malcolm X College (MXC), and Rush have a rich, multi-year history of collaboration. The partnership includes hosting students' clinical rotations in nursing, surgical technology, radiologic technology, EMT/paramedic, and respiratory care at Rush and providing anatomy labs for MXC health occupations students. Rush also provides guest lecturers and recently began offering a monthly interprofessional lunch and learn series for MXC students and faculty. MXC wants to ensure that its graduates have the knowledge, skills and professional attributes they will need to function in the healthcare system, both now and in the future. To help achieve that goal, Rush participates in MXC advisory committees and provides transfer programs for graduates of the MXC radiologic technology and respiratory care programs to allow students the opportunity to obtain a bachelor's degree in their fields.Mini Medical School The Rush Community Service Initiatives Program (RCSIP) Mini Medical School is a five-week summer day camp for 200 students, in fourth and fifth grade, from Chicago Public Schools. The main objective of the program is to expose young students to the health sciences. The summer camp is held at Rush University and includes an orientation, anatomy and physiology lectures, activities on the five major body systems, dissections, homework, and a completion celebration. Rush student and physician volunteers plan the curriculum, implement activities, and assist the youth during the camp. This year, 100 grade school students attended Mini Medical School."

Rush currently has three SBHCs located within Chicago Public Schools that include, Orr Academy High School, Richard T. Crane Medical Preparatory High School, and Simpson Academy for Young Women. Crane and Orr have students in grades 9-12 and Simpson is for girls in grades six to 12 that are pregnant, parenting, or both. All three schools have student bodies from underserved populations, and are located in neighborhoods with high poverty levels and hardship.The Rush SBHCs act as safety nets for these vulnerable students. Wide-ranging clinic services are provided by advanced practice nurses, registered nurses, collaborating physicians and large numbers of Rush's inter-professional students. The services include physicals, immunizations, treatment of injuries, primary care, intermittent care, mental health services, prenatal care, pregnancy prevention programs, heath education programs and health care for the children of the students. Outcomes of this health care and education collaboration include improved immunization rates, decreased incidence of infectious disease, decreased emergency room usage, detecting and treating illness, healthy baby deliveries, increased access to mental health services, success in pregnancy prevention programs, and students establishing healthy living patterns aimed at chronic disease prevention and improved graduation rates. In FY17, these health centers provided over 3,880 healthcare encounters to approximately 1,130 students.Adolescent Family Center The Rush Adolescent Family Center (AFC) has existed for over forty years. The AFC provides reproductive healthcare, prenatal care, gynecological care, pregnancy prevention programs, sexually transmitted infection (STI) testing and treatment, and community health education to underserved Chicago-area youth. All of AFC's services are provided regardless of income or ability to pay for care. Although AFC draws patients from over 107 Chicago-area zip codes, the majority of patients served reside in the Chicago West Side communities of East Garfield Park, West Garfield Park, North Lawndale, Austin, Humboldt Park and the Near West Side. As part of AFC's community education program, staffs regularly travel off-site to Chicago-area high schools and middle schools to provide community education on pregnancy prevention, reproductive anatomy, contraception, sexually transmitted infection prevention and reproductive health. AFC also offers free prenatal education classes to pregnant teens and their partners. This year, AFC provided clinic services to 545 youth - in total 2,260 healthcare encounters - and provided reproductive health education to 10,655 youth at 23 different schools and community education encounters. The Road Home Program at the Center for Veterans and Their Families at Rush The Road Home Program provides care for the ""invisible wounds of war"" for veterans and their families. Services for veterans deployed in Iraq and Afghanistan include: an adult mental health clinic that specializes in post-traumatic stress disorder; child and family services such as support groups, counseling and guidance for parenting; traumatic brain injury clinic; a military sexual trauma clinic; and an Intensive Outpatient Program (IOP). The IOP is a three-week program where veterans locally, and from all around the country fly in to receive intensive treatment Monday thru Friday, 8:00am to 4:00pm. This past year the Road Home Program provided clinical services to 404 veterans and their family members for a total of 6,706 encounters. In addition, The Road Home Program conducted veteran outreach to 12,020 people within the community (vet organizations, veterans, and veteran family members) and conducted Military 101-type training with 1,719 Rush personnel and local leaders.College of Nursing Faculty Practice ProgramThe College of Nursing (CON) has a 30-year history of providing healthcare services to underserved individuals, families, and communities at a variety of diverse community practice sites through the CON Faculty Practice Program. These sites are deployed where individuals live, learn and work and include a wellness and health program for the Children's School at the Lighthouse for the Blind, a women's health clinic, a case management program for chronic medical and mental illness, a work-place health clinic for the working poor and nurse practitioner led primary healthcare sites. Most recipients of care at the faculty practice sites are uninsured or underinsured and rely on the sites as their main healthcare source. In addition to the hours of care provided by Rush CON faculty practitioners, Rush nursing students deliver healthcare and health education services at the various sites. The students' efforts greatly enhance the volume of health services provided. In addition, Rush University nursing, medical, physician assistant and health systems management students volunteer at these sites developing and delivering health education programs. Several thousand health encounters are provided per year through the CON Faculty Practice Program.Goal 3: Prevent and reduce chronic disease by focusing on risk factors Supporting Program Information:5 + 1 = 20 5 + 1 = 20 is a Rush Community Service Initiatives Program (RCSIP) program that aims to educate high school students at Chicago Public Schools on the five diseases prevalent in the surrounding underserved community (asthma, hypertension, HIV, diabetes, and cancer). 5 + 1 = 20 is based on the idea that knowledge of these 5 common conditions plus 1 informed high school student (or person) can extend one's life by 20 years (individuals without health insurance have a life expectancy of 20 years less than the general US population). Twice a month, Rush student volunteers teach a health topic related to the five diseases to high school students. The content of the interactive health lectures ranges from disease prevention to practical skills such checking blood pressure. The high school students have opportunities to spread their knowledge through 5 + 1 = 20 health fairs at their schools. Health fair activities include body mass index calculations, blood pressure screenings, vision screenings, glucose level checks, referrals, and health education. Health fair participants include families and friends of the students as well as other members of their communities. This past year, 5 + 1 = 20 provided health education and screenings to approximately 4,274 community members.Mini Health Fairs Rush's Professional Nursing staff helps provide Mini Health Fairs for patients receiving care at Thresholds, an organization that provides services to individuals with chronic mental illness. The Mini Health Fairs provide health education and screenings. This is important since those living with chronic mental illness have a lifespan that is 25 years less than the general population related to chronic medical diseases. Rush's Wellness Center at Facing Forward to End Homelessness Rush's Wellness Center at Facing Forward to End Homelessness is part of Rush's Building Healthy Urban Communities project, a partnership project supported by BMO Harris Bank, Rush University, the Medical Home Network, and the City Colleges of Chicago. Facing Forward is a housing first program that provides permanent housing to homeless individuals with histories of substance abuse. In addition to their substance abuse histories approximately 65% have other mental health issues and a high burden of chronic diseases. The Wellness Center utilizes a holistic and diverse approach to address the mental and physical health issues of the population. The weekly sessions are supported by inter-professional student volunteers and faculty from Rush University in addition to other community partners. The Rush University students receive training in motivational interviewing to enhance their skills as life coaches when assisting participants in their decisions to make healthier life-style choices. The two hour weekly sessions incorporate blood pressures and weight checks, life coach counseling, health education lectures, healthy cooking demonstrations and 30 minutes of exercise. This program has assisted many of the women in decreasing tobacco use and reducing anxiety. Outcomes to date include an increased consciousness of the importance of taking control of one's health, healthier eating habits, increased activity, sustained weight loss, and smoking reduction."

Rush Generations, a free health affinity membership program of approximately 15,000 members, offers older adults and their caregivers the opportunity to benefit from health and wellness educational programs. Rush Generations offers its members a free quarterly newsletter, monthly e-newsletter, access to community health fairs and screenings, and opportunities to become more active and engaged by joining the Generations volunteer ambassador program. SWACH offers evidence-based workshops designed to help members manage their health such as A Matter of Balance falls prevention education and Chronic Disease Self-Management and Diabetes Self-Management. Additionally, Rush physician experts speak on a variety of topics related to health and aging at their monthly ""Ask the Expert"" presentations. SWACH operates the Anne Bryon Waud Resource Center and the Tower Resource Center (TRC) which are open daily to the public. Each center is staffed by a licensed clinical social worker who is available to help with a myriad of issues related to health and chronic health issues that particularly impact adults and caregivers. SWACH also supports the Senior Health Insurance Program (SHIP), which connects patients as well as community members to free options counseling to assist with navigation of Medicare and the related systems.Rush Wellness Program with the Chicago Department of Family and Support Services The Rush Wellness Program with the Chicago Department of Family and Support Services primarily serves a racial/ethnic minority older adult population and has been in existence since 1985. Rush advanced practice nurses, dietitians, pharmacists, social workers, and students provide health education and healthcare for older adults at five Chicago senior centers. Rush has provided thousands of service encounters over time for older adults which included health consultations, screenings - such as blood pressure, cholesterol, diabetes, memory, stroke risk, and PSA levels as well as health talks on topics such as diabetes, managing chronic conditions, stroke awareness, and fall prevention. Oak Park Diabetes Health FairThe ROPH diabetes health fair provides blood pressure, a fasting glucose and lipid profile blood test, optional foot screening and a healthy breakfast for every participant. In addition, a dozen or more pharmaceutical and other vendors are present to give away free literature and share information about diabetes care and related matters. The annual diabetes health fair provides free health screenings to more than 150 community participants. The screenings included blood tests for A1c and total cholesterol, vision checks and feet exams. In addition, a medical doctor and a registered dietician were on hand to provide health information and answer questions. Each year, people benefit from early detection of the disease, some of whom were not previously receiving regular health care.Project Lifestyle ChangeFor the fifth consecutive year, ROPH's Project Lifestyle Change, a group education and support program that informs on pre-diabetes health, continued to make an impact in the community. ROPH received a grant from the National Diabetes Prevention Program to educate people on how to delay or prevent the development of type 2 diabetes for those at high risk. The program teaches blood glucose monitoring, restricted fat and calorie meal planning, exercise and behavior modification at no chargeGoal 4: Increase access to care and community services Supporting Program Information:Rush Community Service Initiative Program Clinics Rush Community Service Initiative Program (RCSIP) Clinics are run by Rush volunteers, more specifically a physician lead and an interprofessional team of Rush student volunteers. The clinics offer various clinical services to patients such as physical exams, health education, free basic medications, procedures such as wound care and use referrals to help patients establish primary and/or specialty care relationships that are affordable or available through charity care. Examples of these clinics include:1.RCSIP Clinic at Franciscan Outreach is located within the Franciscan House homeless shelter for adult men and women. Over 1,600 healthcare encounters/visits were provided during FY17.2.RCSIP Clinic at Freedom Center serves adults males that are in rehabilitation for substance abuse issues. The clinic is housed within the Salvation Army's Harbor Light Center and provided healthcare to over 150 men during FY17. 3.RCSIP Clinic at Chicago City Church serves homeless and other at-risk adults.

Rush also had a Spanish plain language summary available directly from the financial counselors. However, Rush was not compliant in having the full financial assistance policy translated into Spanish in FY17. This was discovered in November 2017 as Rush worked with tax consultants on Schedule H.

However, Rush did not calculate AGB on an annual basis after that calculation completed in January 2016 as required. This was discovered in November 2017 as Rush worked with tax consultants on Schedule H. Rush calculated what AGB would have been for FY17 on February 2, 2018. Rush estimates that this fortunately did not cause any patients who qualify for financial assistance to be charged greater than AGB. This was evaluated by determining the AGB for claims allowed in FY17 and comparing that that to the discounts offered to patients who qualify for financial assistance under the FAP (either 75% discount or 100% discount, depending on patient eligibility). Rush has also implemented procedures to ensure compliance with this requirement in the future. Going forward, Rush will implement a checklist of items that will ensure compliance with the AGB requirement.

201801349349304915,230596940,"SCHEDULE H, PART III, LINE 8","MEDICARE COSTS WERE DERIVED FROM THE MEDICARE COST REPORT FILED BY THE ORGANIZATION. THE ORGANIZATION FEELS THAT MEDICARE UNDERPAYMENTS (SHORTFALL) AND BAD DEBT ARE COMMUNITY BENEFIT AND ASSOCIATED COSTS ARE INCLUDABLE ON THE FORM 990, SCHEDULE H, PART I. AS OUTLINED MORE FULLY BELOW THE ORGANIZATION BELIEVES THAT THESE SERVICES AND RELATED COSTS PROMOTE THE HEALTH OF THE COMMUNITY AS A WHOLE AND ARE RENDERED IN CONJUNCTION WITH THE ORGANIZATION'S CHARITABLE TAX-EXEMPT PURPOSES AND MISSION IN PROVIDING MEDICALLY NECESSARY HEALTHCARE SERVICES TO ALL INDIVIDUALS IN A NON-DISCRIMINATORY MANNER WITHOUT REGARD TO RACE, COLOR, CREED, SEX, NATIONAL ORIGIN OR ABILITY TO PAY AND CONSISTENT WITH THE COMMUNITY BENEFIT STANDARD PROMULGATED BY THE INTERNAL REVENUE SERVICE (""IRS""). THE COMMUNITY BENEFIT STANDARD IS THE CURRENT STANDARD FOR A HOSPITAL FOR RECOGNITION AS A TAX-EXEMPT AND CHARITABLE ORGANIZATION UNDER INTERNAL REVENUE CODE (""IRC"") 501(C)(3). THE ORGANIZATION IS RECOGNIZED AS A TAX-EXEMPT ENTITY AND CHARITABLE ORGANIZATION UNDER 501(C)(3) OF THE IRC. ALTHOUGH THERE IS NO DEFINITION IN THE TAX CODE FOR THE TERM ""CHARITABLE"", A REGULATION PROMULGATED BY THE DEPARTMENT OF THE TREASURY PROVIDES SOME GUIDANCE AND STATES THAT ""[T]HE TERM CHARITABLE IS USED IN 501(C)(3) IN ITS GENERALLY ACCEPTED LEGAL SENSE,PROVIDES EXAMPLES OF CHARITABLE PURPOSES, INCLUDING THE RELIEF OF THE POOR OR UNPRIVILEGED; THE PROMOTION OF SOCIAL WELFARE; AND THE ADVANCEMENT OF EDUCATION, RELIGION, AND SCIENCE. NOTE: IT DOES NOT EXPLICITLY ADDRESS THE ACTIVITIES OF HOSPITALS. IN THE ABSENCE OF EXPLICIT STATUTORY OR REGULATORY REQUIREMENTS APPLYING THE TERM ""CHARITABLE"" TO HOSPITALS, IT HAS BEEN LEFT TO THE IRS TO DETERMINE THE CRITERIA HOSPITALS MUST MEET TO QUALIFY AS IRC 501(C)(3) CHARITABLE ORGANIZATIONS. THE ORIGINAL STANDARD WAS KNOWN AS THE CHARITY CARE STANDARD. THIS STANDARD WAS REPLACED BY THE IRS WITH THE COMMUNITY BENEFIT STANDARD WHICH IS THE CURRENT STANDARD. CHARITY CARE STANDARD IN 1956, THE IRS ISSUED REVENUE RULING 56-185, WHICH ADDRESSED THE REQUIREMENTS HOSPITALS NEEDED TO MEET IN ORDER TO QUALIFY FOR IRC 501(C)(3) STATUS. ONE OF THESE REQUIREMENTS IS KNOWN AS THE ""CHARITY CARE STANDARD."" UNDER THE STANDARD, A HOSPITAL HAD TO PROVIDE, TO THE EXTENT OF ITS FINANCIAL ABILITY, FREE OR REDUCED-COST CARE TO PATIENTS UNABLE TO PAY FOR IT. A HOSPITAL THAT EXPECTED FULL PAYMENT DID NOT, ACCORDING TO THE RULING, PROVIDE CHARITY CARE BASED ON THE FACT THAT SOME PATIENTS ULTIMATELY FAILED TO PAY. THE RULING EMPHASIZED THAT A LOW LEVEL OF CHARITY CARE DID NOT NECESSARILY MEAN THAT A HOSPITAL HAD FAILED TO MEET THE REQUIREMENT SINCE THAT LEVEL COULD REFLECT ITS FINANCIAL ABILITY TO PROVIDE SUCH CARE. THE RULING ALSO NOTED THAT PUBLICLY SUPPORTED COMMUNITY HOSPITALS WOULD NORMALLY QUALIFY AS CHARITABLE ORGANIZATIONS BECAUSE THEY SERVE THE ENTIRE COMMUNITY AND A LOW LEVEL OF CHARITY CARE WOULD NOT AFFECT A HOSPITAL'S EXEMPT STATUS IF IT WAS DUE TO THE SURROUNDING COMMUNITY'S LACK OF CHARITABLE DEMANDS. COMMUNITY BENEFIT STANDARD IN 1969, THE IRS ISSUED REVENUE RULING 69-545, WHICH ""REMOVE[D]"" FROM REVENUE RULING 56-185 ""THE REQUIREMENTS RELATING TO CARING FOR PATIENTS WITHOUT CHARGE OR AT RATES BELOW COST."" UNDER THE STANDARD DEVELOPED IN REVENUE RULING 69-545, WHICH IS KNOWN AS THE ""COMMUNITY BENEFIT STANDARD,"" HOSPITALS ARE JUDGED ON WHETHER THEY PROMOTE THE HEALTH OF A BROAD CLASS OF INDIVIDUALS IN THE COMMUNITY. THE RULING INVOLVED A HOSPITAL THAT ONLY ADMITTED INDIVIDUALS WHO COULD PAY FOR THE SERVICES (BY THEMSELVES, PRIVATE INSURANCE, OR PUBLIC PROGRAMS SUCH AS MEDICARE), BUT OPERATED A FULL-TIME EMERGENCY ROOM THAT WAS OPEN TO EVERYONE. THE IRS RULED THAT THE HOSPITAL QUALIFIED AS A CHARITABLE ORGANIZATION BECAUSE IT PROMOTED THE HEALTH OF PEOPLE IN ITS COMMUNITY. THE IRS REASONED THAT BECAUSE THE PROMOTION OF HEALTH WAS A CHARITABLE PURPOSE ACCORDING TO THE GENERAL LAW OF CHARITY, IT FELL WITHIN THE ""GENERALLY ACCEPTED LEGAL SENSE"" OF THE TERM ""CHARITABLE,"" AS REQUIRED BY TREAS. REG. 1.501(C)(3)-1(D)(2). THE IRS RULING STATED THAT THE PROMOTION OF HEALTH, LIKE THE RELIEF OF POVERTY AND THE ADVANCEMENT OF EDUCATION AND RELIGION, IS ONE OF THE PURPOSES IN THE GENERAL LAW OF CHARITY THAT IS DEEMED BENEFICIAL TO THE COMMUNITY AS A WHOLE EVEN THOUGH THE CLASS OF BENEFICIARIES ELIGIBLE TO RECEIVE A DIRECT BENEFIT FROM ITS ACTIVITIES DOES NOT INCLUDE ALL MEMBERS OF THE COMMUNITY, SUCH AS INDIGENT MEMBERS OF THE COMMUNITY, PROVIDED THAT THE CLASS IS NOT SO SMALL THAT ITS RELIEF IS NOT OF BENEFIT TO THE COMMUNITY. THE IRS CONCLUDED THAT THE HOSPITAL WAS ""PROMOTING THE HEALTH OF A CLASS OF PERSONS THAT IS BROAD ENOUGH TO BENEFIT THE COMMUNITY"" BECAUSE ITS EMERGENCY ROOM WAS OPEN TO ALL AND IT PROVIDED CARE TO EVERYONE WHO COULD PAY, WHETHER DIRECTLY OR THROUGH THIRD-PARTY REIMBURSEMENT. OTHER CHARACTERISTICS OF THE HOSPITAL THAT THE IRS HIGHLIGHTED INCLUDED THE FOLLOWING: ITS SURPLUS FUNDS WERE USED TO IMPROVE PATIENT CARE, EXPAND HOSPITAL FACILITIES, AND ADVANCE MEDICAL TRAINING, EDUCATION, AND RESEARCH; IT WAS CONTROLLED BY A BOARD OF TRUSTEES THAT CONSISTED OF INDEPENDENT CIVIC LEADERS; AND HOSPITAL MEDICAL STAFF PRIVILEGES WERE AVAILABLE TO ALL QUALIFIED PHYSICIANS. THE AMERICAN HOSPITAL ASSOCIATION (""AHA"") FEELS THAT MEDICARE UNDERPAYMENTS (SHORTFALL) AND BAD DEBT ARE COMMUNITY BENEFIT AND THUS INCLUDABLE ON THE FORM 990, SCHEDULE H, PART I. THIS ORGANIZATION AGREES WITH THE AHA POSITION. AS OUTLINED IN THE AHA LETTER TO THE IRS DATED AUGUST 21, 2007 WITH RESPECT TO THE FIRST PUBLISHED DRAFT OF THE NEW FORM 990 AND SCHEDULE H, THE AHA FELT THAT THE IRS SHOULD INCORPORATE THE FULL VALUE OF THE COMMUNITY BENEFIT THAT HOSPITALS PROVIDE BY COUNTING MEDICARE UNDERPAYMENTS (SHORTFALL) AND BAD DEBT AS QUANTIFIABLE COMMUNITY BENEFIT FOR THE FOLLOWING REASONS: - PROVIDING CARE FOR THE ELDERLY AND SERVING MEDICARE PATIENTS IS AN ESSENTIAL PART OF THE COMMUNITY BENEFIT STANDARD. - MEDICARE, LIKE MEDICAID, DOES NOT PAY THE FULL COST OF CARE. RECENTLY, MEDICARE REIMBURSES HOSPITALS ONLY 92 CENTS FOR EVERY DOLLAR THEY SPEND TO TAKE CARE OF MEDICARE PATIENTS. THE MEDICARE PAYMENT ADVISORY COMMISSION (""MEDPAC"") IN ITS MARCH 2007 REPORT TO CONGRESS CAUTIONED THAT UNDERPAYMENT WILL GET EVEN WORSE, WITH MARGINS REACHING A 10-YEAR LOW AT NEGATIVE 5.4 PERCENT. - MANY MEDICARE BENEFICIARIES, LIKE THEIR MEDICAID COUNTERPARTS, ARE POOR. MORE THAN 46 PERCENT OF MEDICARE SPENDING IS FOR BENEFICIARIES WHOSE INCOME IS BELOW 200 PERCENT OF THE FEDERAL POVERTY LEVEL. MANY OF THOSE MEDICARE BENEFICIARIES ARE ALSO ELIGIBLE FOR MEDICAID -- SO CALLED ELIGIBLES."" THERE IS EVERY COMPELLING PUBLIC POLICY REASON TO TREAT MEDICARE AND MEDICAID UNDERPAYMENTS SIMILARLY FOR PURPOSES OF A HOSPITAL'S COMMUNITY BENEFIT AND INCLUDE THESE COSTS ON FORM 990, SCHEDULE H, PART I. MEDICARE UNDERPAYMENT MUST BE SHOULDERED BY THE HOSPITAL IN ORDER TO CONTINUE TREATING THE COMMUNITY'S ELDERLY AND POOR. THESE UNDERPAYMENTS REPRESENT A REAL COST OF SERVING THE COMMUNITY AND SHOULD COUNT AS A QUANTIFIABLE COMMUNITY BENEFIT. BOTH THE AHA AND THIS ORGANIZATION ALSO FEEL THAT PATIENT BAD DEBT IS A COMMUNITY BENEFIT AND THUS INCLUDABLE ON THE FORM 990, SCHEDULE H, PART I. THERE ARE COMPELLING REASONS THAT PATIENT BAD DEBT SHOULD BE COUNTED AS QUANTIFIABLE COMMUNITY BENEFIT AS FOLLOWS: - A SIGNIFICANT MAJORITY OF BAD DEBT IS ATTRIBUTABLE TO LOW-INCOME PATIENTS, WHO, FOR MANY REASONS, DECLINE TO COMPLETE THE FORMS REQUIRED TO ESTABLISH ELIGIBILITY FOR HOSPITALS' CHARITY CARE OR FINANCIAL ASSISTANCE PROGRAMS. A 2006 CONGRESSIONAL BUDGET OFFICE (""CBO"") REPORT, NONPROFIT HOSPITALS AND THE PROVISION OF COMMUNITY BENEFITS, CITED TWO STUDIES INDICATING THAT ""THE GREAT MAJORITY OF BAD DEBT WAS ATTRIBUTABLE TO PATIENTS WITH INCOMES BELOW 200% OF THE FEDERAL POVERTY LINE."" - THE REPORT ALSO NOTED THAT A SUBSTANTIAL PORTION OF BAD DEBT IS PENDING CHARITY CARE. UNLIKE BAD DEBT IN OTHER INDUSTRIES, HOSPITAL BAD DEBT IS COMPLICATED BY THE FACT THAT HOSPITALS FOLLOW THEIR MISSION TO THE COMMUNITY AND TREAT EVERY PATIENT THAT COMES THROUGH THEIR EMERGENCY DEPARTMENT, REGARDLESS OF ABILITY TO PAY. PATIENTS WHO HAVE OUTSTANDING BILLS ARE NOT TURNED AWAY, UNLIKE OTHER INDUSTRIES. BAD DEBT IS FURTHER COMPLICATED BY THE AUDITING INDUSTRY'S STANDARDS ON REPORTING CHARITY CARE. MANY PATIENTS CANNOT OR DO NOT PROVIDE THE NECESSARY, EXTENSIVE DOCUMENTATION REQUIRED TO BE DEEMED CHARITY CARE BY AUDITORS. AS A RESULT, ROUGHLY 10% OF BAD DEBT IS PENDING CHARITY CARE. - THE CBO CONCLUDED THAT ITS FINDINGS ""SUPPORT THE VALIDITY OF THE USE OF UNCOMPENSATED CARE [BAD DEBT AND CHARITY CARE] AS A MEASURE OF COMMUNITY BENEFITS"" ASSUMING THE FINDINGS ARE GENERALIZABLE NATIONWIDE; THE EXPERIENCE OF HOSPITALS AROUND THE NATION REINFORCES THAT THEY ARE GENERALIZABLE. AS OUTLINED BY THE AHA, DESPITE THE HOSPITAL'S BEST EFFORTS AND DUE DILIGENCE, PATIENT BAD DEBT IS A PART OF THE HOSPITAL'S MISSION AND CHARITABLE PURPOSES. BAD DEBT REPRESENTS"

TO FULFILL ITS MISSION OF PROVIDING COMPASSIONATE, HIGH QUALITY CARE TO ALL PATIENTS IT SERVES, ARIA HEALTH MUST ALSO ENSURE ITS OWN FINANCIAL VIABILITY. IN ORDER TO SECURE REIMBURSEMENT OF COSTS FOR SERVICES PROVIDED, EVERY EFFORT IS MADE TO ASSIST UNINSURED PATIENTS IN OBTAINING INSURANCE COVERAGE THROUGH MEDICAL ASSISTANCE (MA), CHILDREN'S HEALTH INSURANCE PROGRAM (CHIP) OR OTHER FEDERAL, STATE, OR CITY CARE COVERAGE SOURCES. ARIA PROVIDES CHARITY CARE TO THOSE PATIENTS WHO ARE UNABLE TO PAY BASED UPON THE ELIGIBILITY CRITERIA INCLUDED IN THEIR FINANCIAL ASSISTANCE POLICY. THE ORGANIZATION PROVIDES DISCOUNTS TO PATIENTS SIMILAR TO DISCOUNTS PROVIDED TO THIRD PARTY INSURANCE AND GOVERNMENTAL PAYERS. SUCH DISCOUNTS ARE ESTABLISHED AT RATES WHICH COVER OR CONTRIBUTE TOWARD THE COST TO PROVIDE THE SERVICES. IN ORDER TO CONSERVE HEALTHCARE RESOURCES, ARIA WILL SEEK PAYMENT FROM PATIENTS WHO DO NOT QUALIFY FOR CHARITY CARE AT ITS DISCOUNTED RATES. IT IS THE POLICY OF ARIA HEALTH TO DIFFERENTIATE BETWEEN UNINSURED PATIENTS WHO ARE UNABLE TO PAY FROM THOSE WHO ARE UNWILLING TO PAY FOR ALL OR PART OF THEIR CARE. FOR AN UNINSURED PATIENT TO RECEIVE NON-EMERGENT CARE AT DISCOUNTED RATES, THE PATIENT MUST MAKE A PAYMENT OR MAKE AN ARRANGEMENT FOR PAYMENT PRIOR TO SERVICES BEING RENDERED. BILLING -------- THE HOSPITAL BILLING SYSTEM WILL REDUCE CHARGES TO THE SELF-PAY FEE SCHEDULE BY POSTING THE DIFFERENCE TO AN ""UNINSURED ALLOWANCE."" THIS PROCESS IS ENACTED WHEN A FINAL BILL IS GENERATED. A FIRST SELF-PAY FINAL BILL IS PRODUCED SHOWING THE UNINSURED ALLOWANCE. THE BILL WILL INFORM THE PATIENT THAT: (1) ALL FINANCIAL ARRANGEMENTS MADE BEFORE, DURING OR SHORTLY AFTER A VISIT MAY NOT BE REFLECTED ON THE FIRST BILL; AND (2) IF THE PATIENT IS LOW INCOME AND ENROLLED IN A GOVERNMENT PROGRAM (E.G., MEDICARE OR MEDICAID) OR WITHOUT INSURANCE, HE OR SHE MAY QUALIFY FOR ARIA HEALTHS CHARITY CARE PROGRAM. CONSISTENT WITH NORMAL BUSINESS OFFICE PRACTICES, ALL UNPAID SELF-PAY ACCOUNTS THAT HAVE AN UNINSURED ALLOWANCE MAY BE FORWARDED TO OUTSIDE VENDORS FOR PRE-ADMISSION AND POST DISCHARGE COLLECTION ASSISTANCE. SELF-PAY ACCOUNTS WITH AN OPEN BALANCE REMAINING AFTER THE PRE-COLLECTION PERIOD EFFORT SHALL BE SENT TO A COLLECTION AGENCY.

PROMOTING HEALTHY LIFESTYLES, OFFERING PREVENTIVE CARE, AND ENGAGING THE COMMUNITY ARE CENTRAL TO ARIA'S MISSION. ARIA HEALTH BELIEVES THAT IN ORDER TO EFFECTIVELY CARE FOR A COMMUNITY, IT IS NECESSARY TO UNDERSTAND THE HEALTH CONDITIONS, BEHAVIORS AND NEEDS OF THE INDIVIDUALS WHO LIVE THERE. THIS IS ACHIEVED THROUGH THE CHNA PROCESS, WHICH INCLUDES DEFINING THE COMMUNITY, ANALYZING PRIMARY AND SECONDARY DATA RELATED TO THE COMMUNITYS HEALTH STATUS AND HEALTH NEEDS, IDENTIFYING THE GREATEST NEEDS, AND DESIGNING A PLAN TO MEET THOSE NEEDS. THE PURPOSE OF THE CHNA WAS THREEFOLD: 1. IDENTIFY COMMON HEALTH CONDITIONS AND CONCERNS THAT ARE AFFECTING THE MEMBERS OF THE COMMUNITY; 2. IDENTIFY BARRIERS FACED BY MEMBERS OF THE COMMUNITY THAT IMPACT THEIR ABILITY TO MAINTAIN GOOD HEALTH AND WELL-BEING; AND 3. ENGAGE HEALTHCARE PROVIDERS AND COMMUNITY MEMBERS IN JOINT EFFORTS TO IMPROVE THE HEALTH OF THE COMMUNITY. THROUGH INITIATIVES FOLLOWING ARIAS PREVIOUS CHNA, THE HOSPITAL WAS ABLE TO REACH HUNDREDS OF COMMUNITY MEMBERS WITH PROGRAMS TARGETING TYPE 2 DIABETES, OBESITY, SMOKING CESSATION, GENERAL HEALTH MANAGEMENT AND PROGRAMS SPECIFIC TO THE HEALTH OF OLDER ADULTS. FEEDBACK FROM INITIATIVE PARTICIPANTS, AS WELL AS KNOWLEDGE AND BIOMETRIC ASSESSMENTS, SHOWED POSITIVE IMPACTS OF THESE PROGRAMS ON HEALTH AND WELL-BEING. THE ORGANIZATION ASSESSED THE HEALTHCARE NEEDS OF ITS COMMUNITY BY OBTAINING PRIMARY AND SECONDARY DATA FROM MULTIPLE SOURCES. AS DESCRIBED IN SCHEDULE H, PART V, SECTION B, PRIMARY DATA WAS COLLECTED THROUGH INTERVIEWS WITH LEADERS OF COMMUNITY-BASED ORGANIZATIONS WHO REPRESENT THE NEEDS OF THE COMMUNITY, LOCAL PUBLIC HEALTH OFFICIALS AND THROUGH HEALTH-RELATED SURVEYS OF COMMUNITY RESIDENTS. IN ADDITION, SECONDARY DATA WAS OBTAINED FROM THE PUBLIC HEALTH MANAGEMENT CORPORATIONS SOUTHEASTERN PENNSYLVANIA HOUSEHOLD HEALTH SURVEY, PENNSYLVANIA DEPARTMENT OF HEALTH, DIVISION OF HEALTH INFORMATICS, HEALTHY COMMUNITIES INSTITUTE, NATIONAL CANCER INSTITUTE AND THE AMERICAN COMMUNITY SURVEY. THE DATA OBTAINED WAS ANALYZED BY REGION AND COMPARED TO COUNTY, STATE AND NATIONAL LEVEL INDICATORS AND HEALTHY PEOPLE 2020 OBJECTIVES (WHERE AVAILABLE). DATA WAS ALSO ANALYZED USING THE HEALTHY COMMUNITIES INSTITUTES DATA SCORING TOOL, WHICH RANKS INDICATORS BASED ON SYSTEMATIC COMPARISON THAT ASSIGNS THE COMMUNITY A SCORE BASED ON COMPARISON TO OTHER COMMUNITIES, HEALTH TARGETS, AND TRENDS OVER TIME.

IF THE PATIENT WISHES TO APPLY FOR CHARITY CARE, THE REGISTRAR WILL PROVIDE A CHARITY CARE APPLICATION. THE PATIENT SHALL BE INSTRUCTED TO COMPLETE AND RETURN THE APPLICATION TO THE FINANCIAL COUNSELOR. SHOULD THE PATIENT DECLINE THE CHARITY CARE OPTION, THE REGISTRAR SHALL REQUEST FROM PATIENTS WITHOUT INSURANCE AN UPFRONT DISCOUNTED PRICE WHICH INCLUDES BOTH HOSPITAL AND PHYSICIAN SERVICES.

WE PROVIDE EXCELLENT AND COMPASSIONATE CARE AND RESPONSIVE SERVICE. AS WE SEEK TO UNDERSTAND AND FULLY MEET OUR PATIENTS' CURRENT AND FUTURE NEEDS AND EXPECTATIONS, WE RECOGNIZE OUR RESPONSIBILITY TO PRUDENTLY USE THE SCARCE RESOURCES ENTRUSTED TO US. LAWS, REGULATIONS, CATASTROPHIC ILLNESSES AND THE RISING COSTS OF NEW TECHNOLOGY HAVE CREATED A CATEGORY OF PATIENTS WHO ARE EITHER UNINSURED OR UNDERINSURED. THIS CHARITY CARE PROGRAM HAS BEEN DEVELOPED TO HELP THE HOSPITAL MEET THE NEEDS OF THESE PATIENTS AND, CONCURRENTLY, MAINTAIN THE FINANCIAL VIABILITY OF THE HOSPITAL FOR FUTURE GENERATIONS. THIS CHARITY CARE POLICY EXPLAINS HOW THE HOSPITAL ASSISTS PATIENTS WHO CANNOT PAY FOR PART OR ALL OF THE ESSENTIAL MEDICAL CARE THEY RECEIVE. PRINCIPLES: STRONG MEMORIAL HOSPITAL PROACTIVELY CONVEYS INFORMATION ABOUT THIS CHARITY CARE POLICY TO PATIENTS AND THEIR FAMILIES. - WE BELIEVE THAT FEAR OF A HOSPITAL BILL SHOULD NEVER GET IN THE WAY OF ESSENTIAL HEALTH SERVICES. THE PROVISION OF URGENT OR EMERGENT HEALTHCARE IS NEVER DELAYED PENDING A FINANCIAL ASSISTANCE DETERMINATION. SIGNS ANNOUNCING THE CHARITY CARE PROGRAM ARE POSTED IN THE HOSPITAL (E.G. EMERGENCY DEPARTMENT, ADMITTING OFFICE) TO PROACTIVELY CONVEY THIS MESSAGE TO PROSPECTIVE PATIENTS AND THE PUBLIC IN GENERAL. - WE MAINTAIN FINANCIAL AID POLICIES THAT ARE CONSISTENT WITH THE MISSION, VALUES AND CAPACITY OF THE HOSPITAL AND THAT TAKE INTO ACCOUNT EACH INDIVIDUAL'S ABILITY TO CONTRIBUTE TO THE COST OF HIS OR HER CARE. - WE COMMUNICATE THE AVAILABILITY OF FINANCIAL AID IN A MANNER THAT IS CLEAR, UNDERSTANDABLE, SENSITIVE TO THE PATIENT'S DIGNITY, AND IN MULTIPLE LANGUAGES. A NOTICE IS AVAILABLE AT REGISTRATION SITES THAT INFORMS PATIENTS OF THIS PROGRAM AND PROVIDES THE PHONE NUMBER TO CALL TO OBTAIN MORE INFORMATION AND TO APPLY FOR THIS PROGRAM. DESIGNATED STAFF ARE PROVIDED DETAILED TRAINING SO THAT THEY CAN PROVIDE INFORMATION AND ANSWER QUESTIONS ABOUT THE CHARITY CARE PROGRAM. INFORMATION IS GENERALLY AVAILABLE IN BOTH ENGLISH AND SPANISH. WHEN REQUESTED, IT WILL ALSO BE MADE AVAILABLE IN OTHER LANGUAGES. - INFORMATION REGARDING OUR CHARITY CARE PROGRAM IS ALSO AVAILABLE ON THE URMC WEBSITE. - WE IMPLEMENT FINANCIAL AID PROCEDURES THAT ARE CONSUMER-FRIENDLY, RESPECTFUL, AND CONFIDENTIAL, AS WELL AS DEBT COLLECTION POLICIES THAT REFLECT THE MISSION AND VALUES OF THIS HOSPITAL. - WE WORK WITH GOVERNMENT, PAYERS, BUSINESS, CONSUMER GROUPS AND OTHERS TO ADDRESS THE UNDERLYING PROBLEM THAT TOO MANY NEW YORKERS LACK HEALTH INSURANCE. GENERAL GUIDELINES: AS PART OF FINANCIAL PLANNING ASSISTANCE, WE PROVIDE PATIENTS, AND/OR THEIR LEGAL REPRESENTATIVE, WITH INFORMATION ABOUT THE CRITERIA THAT MUST BE MET IN ORDER TO OBTAIN MEDICAID, MEDICARE, OR OTHER HEALTH INSURANCES. PATIENTS ARE ASSISTED IN MAKING APPLICATIONS FOR ANY OF THESE INSURANCES OR DISCOUNTED FEE PLANS. PATIENTS ARE EXPECTED TO PARTICIPATE FULLY IN ALL EFFORTS TO OBTAIN ANY INSURANCE FOR WHICH THEY MAY QUALIFY. UNDER CERTAIN CIRCUMSTANCES, AS DETERMINED BY THE FINANCIAL CASE MANAGERS OR OTHER HOSPITAL SENIOR ADMINISTRATORS. APPLICATIONS FOR MEDICAID, MEDICARE OR OTHER INSURANCE PROGRAMS MAY BE WAIVED WHEN DEEMED UNNECESSARY. IF AVAILABLE INSURANCE BENEFITS ARE NOT SUFFICIENT TO COVER THE COST OF THEIR CARE, PATIENTS MAY THEN APPLY FOR ASSISTANCE FROM THE CHARITY CARE PROGRAM. CHARITY CARE APPLICATIONS MUST BE COMPLETED AND RETURNED TO THE HOSPITAL WITH THE REQUESTED INCOME DOCUMENTATION. PATIENTS WILL NOT RECEIVE CHARITY CARE ASSISTANCE IF THEY (A) DO NOT COMPLETE THE APPLICATION PROCESS FOR MEDICAID OR OTHER INSURANCE FOR WHICH THEY MAY QUALIFY, (B) ELECT NOT TO MAKE APPLICATION FOR CHARITY CARE, OR (C) HAVE ADEQUATE RESOURCES OR INCOME TO PAY PRIVATELY FOR THEIR CARE. IN THESE SITUATIONS, THEY WILL REMAIN FINANCIALLY RESPONSIBLE FOR FULL PAYMENT OF THEIR HOSPITAL BILLS. CHARITY CARE ASSISTANCE IS AVAILABLE FOR PATIENTS WHO RESIDE IN NEW YORK STATE AND RECEIVE EMERGENCY HOSPITAL SERVICES, INCLUDING EMERGENCY TRANSFERS, AND TO PATIENTS WHO RESIDE IN STRONG MEMORIAL HOSPITAL'S PRIMARY SERVICE AREA IN NEW YORK STATE WHO RECEIVE SERVICES IN DESIGNATED STRONG MEMORIAL HOSPITAL PROGRAMS, INCLUDING MOST INPATIENT AND OUTPATIENT SERVICES. IN ADDITION, THE HOSPITAL MAY, IN ITS DISCRETION, GRANT CHARITY CARE TO INDIVIDUALS WHO RESIDE OUTSIDE OF NEW YORK STATE. CHARITY CARE ASSISTANCE DOES NOT COVER MEDICALLY UNNECESSARY CARE, COSMETIC ALTERATION, TELEPHONE, TELEVISION AND PRIVATE ROOM CHARGES. IT DOES NOT COVER SERVICES GENERATED BY AN INSURED PATIENT WHO CHOOSES TO RECEIVE CARE AT AN OUT-OF-NETWORK HOSPITAL, OR WHO FAILS TO COMPLY WITH INSURANCE POLICY REQUIREMENTS (E.G. UNAUTHORIZED SERVICES) NOR DOES IT APPLY TO NON-RESIDENT ALIENS (UNLESS APPROVED IN ADVANCE OF CARE BEING PROVIDED), TO DRUGS NOT ADMINISTERED IN THE HOSPITAL, TO TRANSPORTATION FURNISHED BY THIRD PARTY VENDORS, OR TO CARE, SERVICES, DRUGS OR SUPPLIES FOR THE PURPOSE OF GENDER CHANGE PROCEDURE. SPECIFIC QUESTIONS ABOUT SERVICES THAT ARE NOT COVERED SHOULD BE DIRECTED TO THE PATIENT ACCOUNTS MANAGER OR THEIR DELEGATE. FINANCIAL GUIDELINES: FINANCIAL AID IS INTENDED TO ASSIST THOSE INDIVIDUALS WHO CANNOT AFFORD TO PAY IN PART OR IN FULL FOR THEIR CARE. IT SHOULD TAKE INTO ACCOUNT EACH INDIVIDUAL'S ABILITY TO CONTRIBUTE TO THE COST OF HIS OR HER CARE. HOSPITAL FINANCIAL AID SHOULD NOT BE VIEWED AS A SUBSTITUTE FOR EMPLOYER-SPONSORED OR INDIVIDUALLY PURCHASED INSURANCE. PATIENTS WITHOUT INSURANCE AND WITH INCOME THAT WOULD QUALIFY THEM FOR THE CHARITY CARE PROGRAM BUT ALSO HAVE SUBSTANTIAL RESOURCES (OTHER THAN TAX-DEFERRED OR COMPARABLE RETIREMENT SAVINGS OR COLLEGE SAVINGS ACCOUNTS) MAY BE EXPECTED TO PAY PART OF THEIR BILLS(S). CHARITY CARE ASSISTANCE IS GENERALLY AVAILABLE TO INDIVIDUALS WHOSE INCOME IS LESS THAN OR EQUAL TO 400% OF THE FEDERAL POVERTY LEVEL. HOWEVER, PATIENTS WHO HAVE EXHAUSTED THEIR INSURANCE BENEFITS, EXCEEDED FINANCIAL ELIGIBILITY CRITERIA, FACE EXTRAORDINARY MEDICAL COSTS, OR WHO HAVE OTHER UNIQUE CIRCUMSTANCES MAY BE CONSIDERED FOR CHARITY CARE APPROVAL IN THE HOSPITAL'S SOLE DISCRETION. WHILE APPLICATION FOR MEDICAID OR OTHER INSURANCE IS USUALLY REQUIRED, THE HOSPITAL MAY, AT ITS SOLE DISCRETION, IN APPROPRIATE CASES, ALSO CONSIDER PATIENTS FOR CHARITY CARE WHEN THEY MEET THE FINANCIAL CRITERIA OF THIS PROGRAM, BUT HAVE NOT SATISFACTORILY COMPLETED ALL THE REQUIREMENTS OF THE CHARITY CARE APPLICATION PROCESS. THIS MAY INCLUDE PATIENTS WHO HAVE BEEN SANCTIONED BY MEDICAID, HAVE FILED BANKRUPTCY OR APPEAR TO BE ELIGIBLE FOR CHARITY CARE ASSISTANCE BASED ON AVAILABLE INFORMATION. ELIGIBILITY DETERMINATIONS IN COMPLEX CASE CIRCUMSTANCES WILL BE MADE AFTER CONSIDERATION BY THE CHARITY CARE REVIEW TEAM THAT INCLUDES THE CHARITY CARE OFFICER, FINANCIAL CASE MANAGER AND/OR THEIR MANAGERS, OR MAY BE MADE BY SENIOR HOSPITAL ADMINISTRATORS. THE AMOUNT OF THE DISCOUNT AFFORDED TO QUALIFIED CHARITY CARE PATIENTS WILL BE DETERMINED THROUGH ASSESSMENT OF THE RESPONSIBLE PARTY'S ANNUAL HOUSEHOLD INCOME AND THE NUMBER OF PEOPLE IN THE HOME, AS A PERCENTAGE OF THE FEDERAL POVERTY GUIDELINE AMOUNTS FOR SAME SIZE HOUSEHOLDS. THE FINANCIAL GUIDELINES WILL BE UPDATED ANNUALLY IN CONJUNCTION WITH THE FEDERAL POVERTY UPDATES PUBLISHED BY CMS. PATIENTS MAY RECEIVE FULL OR PARTIAL DISCOUNT FROM THE COST OF CARE, DEPENDING ON THE PERCENTAGE OF THE GUIDELINES MATCHED BY THE PATIENT'S HOUSEHOLD INCOME. ANY BILL AMOUNT REMAINING AFTER APPLICATION OF A PARTIAL CHARITY CARE DISCOUNT IS THE RESPONSIBILITY OF THE PATIENT. THE AMOUNT AN APPROVED CHARITY CARE PATIENT WILL GENERALLY BE EXPECTED TO PAY FOR SERVICES COVERED BY THE POLICY WILL BE LIMITED TO THE LOWER OF THE AMOUNT THAT THE HOSPITAL WOULD HAVE RECEIVED FOR THE SAME SERVICE UNDER MEDICARE PARTS A AND B, (INCLUDING COINSURANCE, CO-PAYMENTS AND DEDUCTIBLES) OR THE USUAL AND CUSTOMARY CHARGES. THE PATIENT WILL BE ASSISTED BY THE HOSPITAL IN MAKING ARRANGEMENTS TO SATISFY ANY BALANCE REMAINING ON THE ACCOUNT(S) AFTER THE APPLICATION OF THE APPROPRIATE CHARITY CARE DISCOUNT BY USE OF A PAYMENT PLAN. THE MONTHLY PAYMENTS UNDER SUCH PLANS SHALL NOT EXCEED TEN PERCENT (10%) OF THE ELIGIBLE PATIENT'S GROSS MONTHLY INCOME. THE RATE OF INTEREST ON UNPAID BALANCES SHALL NOT EXCEED THE US TREASURY RATE FOR 90 DAY SECURITIES PLUS 0.5%. HOSPITAL PATIENT FINANCIAL AID STATUTE DISCOUNTING REQUIREMENTS DISCOUNT / GROSS INCOME AS % OF FEDERAL POVERTY LEVEL 100% / UP TO 200% 80% / BETWEEN 201-250% 60% / BETWEEN 251-300% 40% / BETWEEN 301-350% 20% / BETWEEN 351-400% 0% / OVER 401% PROCESS: APPLICATIONS WILL BE ACCEPTED IMMEDIATELY BEFORE, DURING OR AFTER CARE IS PROVIDED. THE HOSPITAL WILL STRIVE TO ASSIST PATIENTS RECEIVING HIGH-COST SERVICES AS THEY OCCUR. PATIENTS MAY BE APPROVED FOR CHARITY CARE ON AN ACCOUNT-BY-ACCOUNT BASIS OR FOR A PERIOD OF TIME (FOR A COURSE OF TREATMENT). F"

OUR MEDICAL STAFF AND COMMUNITY BOARD PLAY AN IMPORTANT ROLE IN COMMUNITY HEALTH IMPROVEMENT. STRONG MEMORIAL HOSPITAL IS OVERSEEN BY THE UNIVERSITY OF ROCHESTER MEDICAL CENTER BOARD, A 30 MEMBER BOARD, INCLUSIVE OF 14 EX-OFFICIO MEMBERS AND 18 SENIOR AND LIFE MEMBERS, THAT REPORT TO THE UNIVERSITY BOARD OF TRUSTEES. THE MEDICAL CENTER BOARD IS LED BY AND COMPRISED OF A DIVERSE GROUP OF COMMUNITY AND INDUSTRY LEADERS AND ADVOCATES - PEOPLE WHO LIVE AND WORK IN THIS COMMUNITY AND CARE DEEPLY ABOUT THE HEALTH AND WELFARE OF ITS CITIZENS. THE BOARD INCLUDES NON-UR MEDICAL CENTER-EMPLOYED PRIVATE COMMUNITY PHYSICIANS, MEMBERS OF THE BUSINESS COMMUNITY, LOCAL PHILANTHROPISTS WITH AN INTEREST IN ADVOCATING FOR HEALTH CARE, AND OTHER LOCAL REPRESENTATIVES. AS A DEDICATED BOARD, EACH MEMBER UPHOLDS WELL-ESTABLISHED PRINCIPLES OF NONPROFIT CORPORATION LAW CONCERNING THE STANDARDS OF CONDUCT AND ATTENTION A BOARD MEMBER MUST MEET: FIDUCIARY RESPONSIBILITY, OBEDIENCE TO THE CHARITABLE PURPOSE OF THE ORGANIZATION, LOYALTY, A COMMITMENT TO ACT BASED ON BEST INTERESTS OF THE ORGANIZATION AND THE WIDER COMMUNITY IT SERVES, AND DILIGENCE IN CARRYING OUT THE WORK OF THE BOARD. ADMINISTRATIVELY, UR MEDICAL CENTER LEADERSHIP HAS INITIATED A COMPREHENSIVE AND AMBITIOUS STRATEGIC PLANNING PROCESS ACROSS THE INSTITUTION. THE GOALS OF THE PLAN INCLUDE EXPANDING COMMUNITY HEALTH PROGRAMS AND RESEARCH THAT IMPROVE THE OVERALL HEALTH OF THE GREATER ROCHESTER COMMUNITY. THE BOARD OF DIRECTORS ENDORSE AND CHAMPION THE VISION OF THE PLAN. THE COMMUNITY ADVISORY COUNCIL (CAC) WAS CREATED IN 2006 TO REPRESENT THE VOICE OF THE COMMUNITY AND TO GUIDE AND SUPPORT THE MISSION OF THE URMC. THE THIRTY-SEVEN MEMBER CAC REPRESENTS EIGHTEEN COMMUNITY-BASED ORGANIZATIONS, INCLUDING HEALTH AND SOCIAL SERVICE AGENCIES, THE FAITH COMMUNITY, LOCAL GOVERNMENT, THE CITY SCHOOL DISTRICT AND MEDIA. A PRIMARY FUNCTION OF THE CAC IS TO STRENGTHEN URMC-COMMUNITY PARTNERSHIPS WITH A MUTUAL GOAL TO REDUCE INEQUALITIES AND IMPROVE ACCESS TO HEALTH CARE AND SERVICES. TO HIGHLIGHT THE IMPORTANCE OF THE COMMUNITY HEALTH MISSION, THE ANNUAL ""DR. DAVID SATCHER COMMUNITY HEALTH IMPROVEMENT AWARDS"" PROGRAM WAS ESTABLISHED IN 2010 TO RECOGNIZE URMC FACULTY/STAFF AND THEIR COMMUNITY PARTNERS FOR EXEMPLARY COMMUNITY-ENGAGED WORK WHICH CONTRIBUTES TO REDUCING HEALTH INEQUALITIES AND IMPROVES THE COMMUNITY'S HEALTH THROUGH RESEARCH, EDUCATION, AND SERVICE. URMC EXTENDS MEDICAL STAFF PRIVILEGES TO EMPLOYED UR MEDICAL CENTER FACULTY PHYSICIANS AND ALL ELIGIBLE PRIVATE PHYSICIANS WHO PRACTICE AT UR MEDICAL CENTER AFFILIATED HOSPITALS. MANY FACULTY MEMBERS SERVE A DUAL ROLE WITH COMMUNITY AGENCIES, PROVIDING SERVICE AS A MEDICAL DIRECTOR OR ATTENDING PHYSICIAN FOR COMMUNITY HEALTH INITIATIVES.

THE 55,000-SQUARE-FOOT FRANK AND CAROLINE GANNETT EMERGENCY CENTER WAS DESIGNED TO IMPROVE EFFICIENCY, WITH THE DIGNITY AND COMFORT OF OUR PATIENTS IN MIND. IT WAS DESIGNATED BY THE NEW YORK STATE DEPARTMENT OF HEALTH AS A LEVEL ONE REGIONAL TRAUMA CENTER. THE ADULT TREATMENT AREA WAS CONSTRUCTED WITH 25 SEMI-PRIVATE PATIENT CUBICLES, AND UNLIKE OTHER EMERGENCY FACILITIES IN THE REGION, IT ALSO INCLUDES A DEDICATED CHILDREN'S EMERGENCY DEPARTMENT WITH A PRIVATE WAITING ROOM. SURPLUS FUNDS ARE ALSO DEDICATED TO SUPPORT RESEARCH. FINAL RENOVATIONS WERE MADE TO OUR CLINICAL AND TRANSLATIONAL RESEARCH INSTITUTE (CTSI) THAT SERVES AS THE HUB OF RESOURCES, EXPERTISE AND NETWORKS NECESSARY TO ACCELERATE THE CLINICAL APPLICATION OF BIOMEDICAL AND BEHAVIORAL RESEARCH SO THAT INTERVENTIONS CAN REACH INDIVIDUALS IN THE COMMUNITY MORE QUICKLY. THE CTSI'S COMMUNITY ENGAGEMENT FUNCTION, WHICH IS ADMINISTERED BY THE UR MEDICAL CENTER'S CENTER FOR COMMUNITY HEALTH, SUPPORTS THE CTSI COMMUNITY ENGAGEMENT MISSION BY FACILITATING COMMUNICATION AND PARTNERSHIPS AMONG RESEARCHERS, HEALTH CARE PROVIDERS, AND COMMUNITY MEMBERS AND ORGANIZATIONS. IN ADDITION, SURPLUS FUNDS ALSO SUPPORT THE UR MEDICAL CENTER'S COMMITMENT TO COMMUNITY HEALTH, WHICH DATES BACK TO THE MEDICAL SCHOOL'S FOUNDING.

A patient may be determined to have financial need based on the following: 1. Indigency: If income falls at or below 200% of the federal poverty guidelines, the patient will have no financial responsibility. The patient is approved for 100% free care. 2. Low Income Sliding Scale: Assistance may be a discounted or reduced patient liability depending on the patient's income. If the combined family income is greater than 200% and less than or equal to 400% of the federal poverty guidelines and uninsured, the patient is eligible for reduced charity care. There will be an 85% reduction in the patient bill.

Discounts and payments in patients' accounts are deducted before the cost of bad debt expense is determined. The method employed is in line with those described in Schedule H, Worksheet 2, ""Ratio of Patient Costs to Charges"". The organization's bad debt expense consists solely of self pay patients accounts deemed uncollectable. It is UPMC Group's contention that the cost of bad debt should be stated in Part I Line 7 of Schedule H as they represent the costs for provision of services to patients for which the entity has exhausted all recourse for reimbursement. The services provided to patients who present themselves are provided regardless of a patient's ability to pay and is in line with the organization's charitable mission and service to our community. These expenses are incurred regardless of the efficiency of the provision of the related medical care and are deemed to have been medically necessary for the patient. Process for reallocation from bad debt to charity care UPMC reclassifies bad debt accounts as charity care by utilizing a predictive model called PARO (Payment Assistance Rank Order). PARO was built as a socio-economic score that identifies those patients that are most likely to be the highest need of financial assistance. This is accomplished by analyzing consumer data and activity, court records, government records, property files, census data and IRS data. PARO provides a systematic approach to financial assistance using the following: 1. Predictive model that encompasses healthcare economics and credit policies; 2. Uniform assessment measure for every patient regardless of financial standing; 3. Accounts for patients that are unresponsive, illiterate, or otherwise challenged to apply; 4. Eliminate barrier to application and meets increased pressure to provide additional financial resources to consumers; 5. Identify and support those community needs efforts to provide assistance to those consumers in need. There are to data points returned to UPMC in order to make the decision whether the patient would qualify for charity care. The first is the estimated income level based on the Federal Poverty Level guidelines. The second is the PARO score which utilized an algorithm based approach and returns a score based on personal attributes of the patient. Data elements were combined to create two primary indicators of need, the PARO score and the Federal Povery Level. PARO analyzed our historical charity care approvals to determine our PARO threshold and the FPL threshold for the historical approvals. The approved charity care accounts were compared against accounts that were in active accounts receivable. This was done to determine if the distributions were similar or if any pattern existed based on the approved accounts and the unknown accounts. If the patient's estimated income and PARO score are within the scores identified by the calibration of UPMC existing charity care patients, the account is reclassified from bad debt to charity care. Every patient is able to apply for charity care; however, the automated strategy focuses on patients that do not complete the application process. The US Department of Education estimates that 1 in 5 consumers are functionally illiterate. This, coupled with the low levels of participation in traditional banking methods, makes the application process virtually impossible for some consumers."

Accounts are written off when they are determined to be uncollectible based upon management's assessment of individual accounts. In evaluating the collectability of patient accounts receivable, the Corporation analyzes its past history and identifies trends for each of its major payor sources of revenue to estimate the appropriate allowance for doubtful accounts and provision for bad debts. For receivables associated with services provided to patients who have third-party coverage, the Corporation analyzes contractual amounts due and provides an allowance for doubtful accounts and a provision for bad debts, if necessary. For receivables associated with self-pay patients, which includes both patients without insurance and insured patients with deductible and copayment balances, the Corporation records a significant provision for bad debts in the period of service on the basis of its past experience, which indicates that many patients are unable or unwilling to pay the portion of their bill for which they are financially responsible. The difference between the billed rates and the amounts actually collected after all reasonable collection efforts have been exhausted is charged off against the allowance for doubtful accounts.The Corporation's allowance for doubtful accounts for self-pay patients was 80% of self-pay accounts receivable at June 30, 2017 and 77% of self-pay accounts receivable at June 30, 2016. The Corporation's self-pay account write-offs (net of recoveries) was approximately $1,667,000 at June 30, 2017 and $2,241,000 at June 30, 2016. The decrease was due to the automatic application of a self-pay courtesy discount, which was a manual process inprior years.

201821309349300642,370663567,"Schedule H, Part VI, Line 5 Promotion of community health (continued A)","HSHS St. Elizabeth's also devotes significant resources to improve access to health care for patients who cannot afford care, in addition to other Community Benefit. In FY2017, HSHS St. Elizabeth's provided more than $23.8 million in Community Benefit, including financial assistance at cost, unpaid costs of Medicaid and other public programs, and a range of diverse programs designed to enhance access improve community health. Additionally, in 2017 HSHS St. Elizabeth's provided $17.7 million (at cost) in uncompensated care to patients who did not qualify for charity care to public assistance and more than $6.7 million (at cost) in excess of Medicare payment for health care services. HSHS St. Elizabeth's provides a range of Community Benefit activities and programs that furthers our mission and long-standing commitment to our community. In many cases, these Community Benefit initiatives would not exist without the leadership role played by HSHS St. Elizabeth's and they often relieve a burden that would otherwise be carried by government. The hospital's FY2015 Community Health Needs Assessment (CHNA) surfaced the following health focus areas to be addressed by the hospital in collaboration with other hospitals and community organizations: nutrition and wellness, access to care and cardiac disease. Implementation strategies were developed to maximize resources and impact the community. Access to health care Over the past three years, HSHS St. Elizabeth's has been committed to providing and assisting eligible patients to enroll in health care plans. Attending to the needs of the poor and vulnerable, HSHS St. Elizabeth's continues to contract with Med-Data, formerly Cardon Outreach, to screen all self-pay patients that present in inpatient or outpatient. Once screened and eligibility criteria met, patients are assisted with enrollment in Medicaid. In FY2017, more than 3,200 patients were screened and 74% were enrolled in Medicaid. For other patients, financial assistance is offered. For example, a patient was being discharged but needed outpatient infusions. However, the patient did not have the resources to obtain this needed service. A colleague facilitated a financial assistance referral. With this help, the patient completed the necessary paperwork and was able to receive the outpatient infusion. Access to health care goes beyond seeing a provider. Assisting patients with medication, durable medical equipment and transportation is another way that HSHS St. Elizabeth's ensures that the underserved are treated with respect and dignity. HSHS St. Elizabeth's provides funding to purchase medication or equipment for those patients who have no ability to pay. By doing so, the patient maintains their dignity and can help themselves. Occasionally, a patient who was hospitalized or seen in the Emergency Department (ED) has no transportation home. Supervisors have the authority to assess the situation and determine if a patient needs a bus pass, cab or ambulance ride to their home. In FY2017, HSHS St Elizabeth's provided more than $5,600 in cab and bus tickets for patients and more than $6,000 in medications for those in need. The hospital contributed more than $14,000 for patients who needed to be transported by ambulance. In collaboration with our physician partners, the hospital hosted a community resource fair to address education gaps with our patients regarding their new health care coverage. HSHS St. Elizabeth's initiated the resource fair concept last year, and many local agencies that had surfaced similar education gaps united to help those in need by providing education based on areas of expertise. HSHS St. Elizabeth's focused on cardiovascular and cardiac education, while other agencies provided education on health care coverage and benefits by plan. Routinely, he hospital participates in events and programs in our communities to serve the poor and vulnerable. Chronic disease; cardiac and cardiovascular Although great health care advances have been made in cardiac and cardiovascular disease, these conditions continue to plague our communities, especially the underserved or poor. The poor are still likely to have high blood pressure, to smoke and have other risk factors for heart disease and stroke as they did 15 or 20 years ago. With this in mind, HSHS St. Elizabeth's continues to provide monthly blood pressure screenings and 1:1 education at East St. Louis's Cosgrove's Kitchen. Cosgrove's Soup Kitchen has been an important ministry serving those suffering from the effects of poverty. It is the only facility in the East St. Louis area that offers a free noon meal six days a week. Each month, two hospital colleagues engage with the clients at the Kitchen, treating them with dignity and respect while checking their blood pressure, offering health information and providing hygiene kits. Over the past two years, the clients have become more comfortable with hospital colleagues and now ask questions about their health. Although it is difficult to measure the impact of this ministry, it is easy to recognize the positive impact that personal interaction has on the community when we are present. Now, some clients bring their medications with them and ask questions to understand what and why they are taking the medication. One client approached a ""familiar face"" at a local East St. Louis church health fair. He asked the nurse if she knew him, and she did recognize him from the Kitchen. He proceeded to explain his symptoms and she directed him to the nearest Emergency Department because his symptoms resembled a stroke. He followed her instructions and sought medical care. The following month at the Kitchen, the client eagerly approached the nurse asking ""Do you remember me?"" After acknowledging him, he said, ""Look, I'm okay! They told me I caught it in time!"" Due to relationship and trust established at the Kitchen, the man did not suffer a stroke. To provide ongoing health care education, HSHS St. Elizabeth's participates in health fair events throughout the community. Connecting with residents in shelters, participating in East St. Louis corner grocery store initiatives, and attending church-sponsored events are some of the examples of events where the hospital takes took our mission outside of our walls. Annually, HSHS St. Elizabeth's colleagues provide blood pressure screens and education on cardiovascular risk factors and signs and symptoms of a heart attack to hundreds of community members. Hospital colleagues also taught hands only CPR in area grade schools. As a result of her participation in the hands only CPR class, a 5th grader recognized that her father was not feeling well and asked if she should call 911 since her mother was not at home. The father did not want her to call 911 but based on the information she learned at school, she called anyway. The ambulance came and father had a cardiac arrest on the way to the hospital. Had it not been for the hospital's school-based education and the bravery of this young girl, her father would not be alive. Happily, he made a full recovery and the family shared their story publicly through a testimonial video used on the hospital's website and on social media. HSHS St. Elizabeth's also collaborates with the YMCA to provide the Lifefit program to meet the complex needs of 15 YMCA underserved families. Through monthly meetings, educational offerings, and bi-weekly check-ins, Lifefit provided the families with opportunity, connections and information to lead healthier lives. Lifefit concluded last summer, however, the success of the program resulted in partnership with the YMCA to sponsor a bike and ride program for the citizens of our local community to promote healthy physical activity. HSHS St Elizabeth's continues to provide education classes to our military and civilian partners in the community through courses such as Advanced Cardiac Life Support, Pediatric Advanced Life support and Neonatal Resuscitation courses. Wellness, Nutrition and Access to Healthy Food The East St. Louis Make Health Happen partnership consists of local community organizations working together to change policy, improve food access, and increase consumption of healthy foods in East St. Louis, Illinois. The Corner Store Initiative increased access to healthy food while building demand in the community through education and promotion of healthy food options. Community partners improved access to nutrition information through healthy cooking demonstrations and an ongoing nutrition-based education series. HSHS St. Elizabeth's participated in community events in East St Louis including a church health fair, a Corner Store event, and a community center event to support Make Health Happen, and to provided blood pressure screenings, healthy recipes and cardiac health education."

The Pink Ribbon Program covers the costs of mammograms or diagnostic screenings for women living in rural areas who are under or uninsured. The Vicky Wagner Breast Cancer Assistance Fund assists women living in Shelby County who are receiving treatment for breast cancer with out of pocket expenses such as wigs, transportation to treatment appointments, child care, meals or other expenses that insurance doesn't cover. In southwest Illinois, HSHS St. Joseph's Hospital in Highland provides enhanced offerings for senior population based on their CHNA. ""Senior Renewal"" is an outpatient counseling program for senior adults who may be facing emotional and physical problems unique to the aging process such as feelings of loneliness, isolation and anxiety. Clients receive a comprehensive level of treatment without inpatient hospitalization through counseling strategies and education. In addition, St. Joseph's Hospital is the lead collaborator in the Highland Area Meals on Wheels Program. In April 1977, the hospital partnered with the now defunct Highland Area Council of Churches to introduce the Meals on Wheels program. Today, St. Joseph's partners with the civic organization Highland Area Meals on Wheels Program to prepare and deliver nutritious meals to the elderly, those who are recuperating from illness or hospital stays, or anyone wishing to participate in the program within a 15-mile radius (cumulative population 20,000+) of the hospital. Annually, approximately 16,896 meals are delivered in eight communities. In addition to programs designed to increase access to care, HSHS makes sure that those who need financial assistance receive it. HSHS's Financial Assistance (Charity Care) policy was modified effective January 1, 2014 to offer a 25 percent self-pay discount to all patients who register without insurance. HSHS Financial Assistance programs have a sliding scale, in some instances providing up to a 55 percent reduction off billed charges if an uninsured patient's family income level is determined to be above 500 percent but equal to our less than 600 percent of the current Federal Poverty Guidelines. HSHS hospitals waive all charges for patients below 200 percent of the Federal Poverty Levels. Counselors are available in our hospitals to explain our financial assistance policy to patients, provide them with assistance in filling out a simple application form, or help them enroll in publicly funded health care programs. Enhance community health As part of our mission to embody Christ's healing love for all people, we understand that we have a responsibility to improve the overall quality of life in our communities by supporting initiatives that promote health and wellness. We recognize we are most successful when we work together with a wide array of public and private organizations that share our commitment to improving lives. By doing so, we maximize our efforts and reduce the duplication of services. To ensure the health care needs of all are being met, HSHS hospitals also understand we need to listen closely to the residents of the communities we serve. In turn, 13 HSHS hospitals conducted Community Health Needs Assessments (CHNAs) in FY2015. HSHS St. Clare Memorial Hospital in Oconto Falls, Wisconsin, who affiliated with HSHS in September 2015, and HSHS Holy Family Hospital in Greenville, Illinois, who affiliated with HSHS in May 2016, both completed their CHNAs in FY2014. HSHS Good Shepherd Hospital in Shelbyville, Illinois who affiliated with HSHS in January 2017, conducted its most recent CHNA in FY2016. HSHS hospitals are using the information gathered from their most recent CHNAs to develop new, and enhance existing, programs and services that best address the needs of the community. Priority health care needs were identified in the FY2015 CHNAs including access to health care services; alcohol, tobacco, and other drug abuse; chronic disease prevention and management; nutrition/wellness; mental health; and oral health. HSHS hospitals are addressing these and other needs by proactively offering educational opportunities, preventative screenings, and new or enhanced clinical services. In many cases, the hospitals collaborate with other hospital facilities, local departments of public health and community organizations to address identified needs. In western Wisconsin, HSHS Sacred Heart Hospital in Eau Claire and HSHS St. Joseph's Hospital in Chippewa Falls are taking the lead to educate the public about mental health issues and treatment, the stigma associated with mental health, and the recognition of mental health issues. Under the umbrella of 3D Community Health, the hospitals led suicide prevention activities across multiple sectors in collaboration with the Chippewa Health Improvement Partnership in FY2017. Strategies included community trainings of an evidence-based suicide prevention program, QPR (question, persuade & refer), and a variety of events, activities and displays pertaining to suicide prevention. Efforts are measured by the county suicide rate, inventory of change in community knowledge, stigma and behaviors, as well as participation in the county suicide death review team to monitor for potential trends and respond accordingly. 3D formed a suicide death review team in both Eau Claire and Chippewa Counties. These teams review details of each suicide to look for trends and key pieces of information that may guide efforts in targeting certain geographic areas, certain age or gender, etc. 3D is also focused on increasing community awareness and knowledge of the factors that offer protection from suicidal behaviors and that promote wellness and recovery in collaboration with multiple community partners on an ongoing basis. One strategy is to promote effective programs and practices i.e. adverse childhood experiences (ACEs) that increase protection from suicidal risk and promote connectedness among residents of Chippewa and Eau Claire Counties. At the Children, Health and Family Summit that 3D Community Health coordinated in partnership with the County Department of Human Services in FY2017, 99 of the 190 attendees took a pre-and- post-event survey about ACEs and brain development. There was a 24% increase in the percentage who strongly agreed that exposing infants to stress can actually cause them to develop a smaller brain post-event compared to pre-event survey. HSHS Holy Family Hospital in Greenville, Illinois has sponsored a multi-faceted health fair for decades, one of the largest Health Fairs in the east St. Louis metropolitan area. The event provides many free health tests in addition to five, low-cost comprehensive blood tests. In FY2017, more than 2,000 blood tests were performed as part of the hospital's annual Health Fair. Participants could choose from a comprehensive blood test, prostate specific antigen blood test (PSA), Hemoglobin A1-C, Vitamin D blood test, Colovantage or a combination of the five blood tests. The cost incurred by HSHS Holy Family Hospital for offering these discounted services was $1,431,105. In addition to the services provided on the day of the Health Fair, the hospital also performs the low-cost blood tests at several off-site locations including area schools, businesses, and manufacturers. Through the years, life-threatening and serious medical conditions have been discovered through testing performed in association with the Health Fair. Mary's Garden is a community teaching garden located on the campus of HSHS St. Mary's Hospital in Decatur, Illinois. The goals of the community garden are to improve community health and food accessibility for those in need, teach the younger generation sustainable gardening and offer a comprehensive, place-based approach to community health improvement. In FY2017 Mary's Garden became a living classroom for Eisenhower High School students who use the garden for interactive instruction on health and nutrition, science, mathematics, ecology and agriculture. Mary's Garden also provided opportunities for two apprentices to develop competencies and self-confidence to move into rural and urban farming/gardening leadership roles and launched a community-supported agriculture (CSA) program for colleagues. This created two jobs and is providing a model for turning dilapidated city lots into urban gardens. The hospital has engaged City officials about a job creation program and neighborhood revitalization."

HSHS St. Elizabeth's honors the over 140 year tradition of the Sisters in the Belleville and surrounding communities by ensuring it can sustain the Sisters' mission well into the future. One way HSHS St. Elizabeth's is able to sustain its mission is through the effective development and utilization of the hospital's financial resources in its policies and practices. HSHS St. Elizabeth's purposefully and diligently planned careful utilization of its financial resources in the construction and planning of the replacement hospital and medical office building in O'Fallon, Illinois. First, HSHS St. Elizabeth's made a commitment to the community to ensure representation on the project from minority and women owned businesses in the construction of the building. In addition, local subcontractors are used whenever possible to support the local community and continue the partnership between the hospital and community. Workforce (non-hospital) development: Bridges Connections District 201 Bridges Connections District 201 is designed to help special needs students learn marketable skills through on the job training. Up to three students receive two hours of supervised job training for each day during the school year. Each student progresses through a three-phase program. Bridges enhances this high-risk population's ability to be productive members of our community. Environmental improvements: Sanitary Pump Station Throughout the process of construction, the neighbors to the new hospital in Misty Valley subdivision have been kept informed. Misty Valley residents experienced many issues relative to their current sanitary pump station. When the new hospital construction team identified the need for a new sanitary pump station on the campus, the hospital built the pump station in a location that would also serve the Misty Valley neighborhood. This demonstrated our commitment to work with the community, improve the environment and be good stewards of our resources. Leadership Development: Leadership Belleville Partnerships with community business leaders is an important part of furthering positive perceptions of HSH St. Elizabeth's as a healing and caring organization. One of HSHS St. Elizabeth's leaders participated in community functions to further convey our message of commitment to southwestern Illinois, and completed Leadership Belleville is a nine-month commitment and unique training program for individuals who have demonstrated high leadership qualities. Coalition Building: BASIC Initiative (Belleville Achieves Strength in Character) BASIC is a partnership of schools, the City of Belleville, and the business community to strengthen character in our youth and in the community. BASIC encourages youth and adults to be productive citizens in our community. HSHS St Elizabeth's is an active member of this organization. Coalition Building: St. Clair County Health Commission HSHS St. Elizabeth's Hospital initiated practices that later became part of the health department when they formed in 1985. A member of HSHS St. Elizabeth's participates in the Health Care Commission. The Health Care Commission, founded in 1991, is a 20 plus organization that serves as a public health system to establish priority health issues, mobilize resources to meet identified needs, and promote the health and well-being of the county residents. This year, HSHS St. Elizabeth's was a lead sponsor for the 8th annual policy summit. The summit launched further discussion and advancement toward agencies working together for collective impact to improve the health of the county. The county is in the middle of the IPLAN process and HSHS St Elizabeth's co-chaired one aspect of the plan in collaboration with another local hospital. Coalition Building: East Side Aligned HSHS St. Elizabeth's joined East Side Aligned, a collective impact model for children and youth within East St Louis that is led by the United Way. As a member of the health care strategy team, we align our Community Health Needs Assessment and partner with other agencies that have similar goals. For example, Eastside Health District's Make Health Happen coalition sponsored by the CDC (Center of Disease Control) and WIC (Women, Infants, and Children) focused on policy change and increasing healthy foods in the area. Although the grant ended, the coalition remains and is transitioning into a separate non-profit agency in which a HSHS St. Elizabeth's colleague will serve on the board. Community Support: Emergency Management and Disaster Preparedness HSHS St. Elizabeth's is a community leader for emergency management. The hospital's EMS coordinator is on the Advisory Council for two counties and is a certified National Incident Management System (NIMS) and Incident Command Structure (ICS). In conjunction with HSHS St. Elizabeth's colleagues, the EMS coordinator taught 42 community partners NIMS and ICS. However, it is this colleague's involvement in the Local Emergency Planning Committees (LEPC) that integrates and prepares HSHS St. Elizabeth's to respond effectively in a disaster. Two of HSHS St Elizabeth's colleagues who are trained in emergency management served as evaluators at a local mock tornado drill. HSHS St. Elizabeth's was the only hospital involved in this county-wide exercise. In addition, HSHS St. Elizabeth's continues as an assessing hospital for EBOLA Community Support: Pregnancy Care Center The hospital's Mother Child Department coordinates donation drives for the Pregnancy Care Center, which is located on the Belleville campus in space donated by the hospital. The Center provides free services including pregnancy tests, referrals for medical care, WIC and other resource information; these resources are also provided by the hospital. The Pregnancy Care Center also provides clothing and supplies to those with financial needs. Community Support: Social Agency Donations Food, clothing, and school supply drives, as well as electronics recycling events were conducted in collaboration with local social agencies such as St. Vincent DePaul, Catholic Urban Programs, and local food pantries to meet the needs of the underserved and reduce the burden of government In FY2017, colleagues donated 56 food baskets weighing approximately pounds 70 each for colleagues in need, and donated an additional 230 pounds of food to Cathedral Food Pantry. More than 75 pounds of clothing supported a local church ministry and backpacks and school supplies were donated to the Violence Prevention Center and hospital colleagues in need. HSHS St. Elizabeth's partners with the local blood services and provides a location to blood donation and contributes to incentives to encourage colleagues and the public to participate. A hospital colleague also serves on the board for the Center of Autism. Community Health improvement and advocacy: Behavioral Health Care In January of 2016, the Behavioral Healthcare Unit at HSHS St. Elizabeth's Hospital closed after working closely with Touchette Regional Hospital to create a Mental Health Center of Excellence. We met with our counterparts from Touchette regularly during the planning stages in order to make this transition of facilities a smooth and effortless process. Both hospitals are members of the Metro-east Behavioral Health Network Council. This is a group of agencies within our community that share resources and implement new treatment strategies for our patients with psychiatric needs. Even though HSHS St. Elizabeth's no longer offers this type of treatment, it is aligned with area facilities and specialists that accommodate our patient population. To facilitate the care of mental health patients at HSHS St Elizabeth's, a mental health nurse practitioner is on staff to assess the needs of this patient population."

201821309349300642,370663567,"Schedule H, Part III, Line 3 Bad Debt Expense Methodology","The hospital strongly believes that its charity care, and the related community benefit obtained from such care, is understated because of those patients who potentially qualify for charity care but do not wish to apply for it. In addition, some care is not classified as charity because of missing documentation on patient resources. Thus, the hospital's bad debt includes a portion that could be classified as charity care if application for such care was sought and/or completed."

201821309349300642,370663567,"Schedule H, Part III, Line 8 Community benefit & methodology for determining medicare costs","HSHS St. Elizabeth's Hospital continually strives to provide excellent patient care in the most cost effective fashion. Nonetheless, the Medicare program, in many cases, does not provide payment that covers the full cost of the care provided. Since it is the mission of the hospital to respond to community need, hospital management continually advocates for improved Medicare payment so that the cost of quality care to those patients who are not able to afford it is not compromised and is fairly subsidized by all payers. While this shortfall in Medicare payments is not classified as community benefit by the IRS, we nonetheless believe it is an important contribution made by the hospital to the health and well-being of the community. If the Medicare program did not exist, many Medicare patients would be eligible for charity care or other means-tested government programs. Further, by absorbing this payment shortfall and providing care below cost to these individuals, HSHS St Elizabeth's is relieving the burdens of the government. Accordingly, this shortfall restricts HSHS St Elizabeth's ability to make funds available to provide for charity care and other community benefits. The hospital Medicare shortfall at cost for fiscal year 2017 was $6,796,590."
201821309349300642,370663567,"Schedule H, Part III, Line 9b Collection practices for patients eligible for financial assistance","The hospital makes reasonable efforts to determine a patient's eligibility for the Financial Assistance Program before utilizing any extraordinary collection actions. Upon admission, a patient receives information about the Financial Assistance Program and how to fill out an application, along with a phone number to contact for further help. Inpatients that are uninsured and not eligible for Medicaid are given a Financial Assistance Application. Each patient will then receive a minimum of three bills with information on how to apply for Financial Assistance. Accounts of patients who have not responded to any of these inquiries will be recommended for bad debt. However, before submitting accounts to a collection agency, the guarantor is screened (using an external program) for charity qualification. If the guarantor qualifies for a full adjustment, the account is settled. We do offer a sliding scale discount for charity. If they qualify for less than 100%, the discount will be posted and the account transferred to the collection agency. The collection agency will do further screening based on their credit score and propensity to pay. Based on this screening, the collection agency may return the account with a recommendation of charity."

In addition to conducting a Community Health Needs Assessment (CHNA) triennially per the provisions in the Affordable Care Act, the hospital routinely assesses the health care needs of the communities it serves in a variety of ways, including reviewing the health needs assessments of other health care organizations in our service area as well our local and state health departments and the United Way. We continually review primary data such as hospital and emergency department utilization and patient surveys as well as secondary data from our county and state public health departments, the Centers for Disease Control, County Health Rankings, and the Behavioral Risk FS Survey to name a few. On occasion, we will also collect primary data through telephone and electronic survey instruments. In addition to ongoing primary and secondary data collection and analysis, the hospital regularly assesses the health care needs of the communities it serves through feedback received from its internal assessment team, assessment advisory team, hospital leadership, Strategy department and hospital Board members. As part of the three-year Implementation Plan, the hospital shares its progress toward achieving its short and long term indicators in various community venues such as town hall meetings, community forums, and Chamber of Commerce. Also through volunteer and board service with other local health care, social service agencies, law enforcement task forces, and area schools, hospital colleagues gather ongoing information on the health care needs of the communities it serves."
201821309349300642,370663567,"Schedule H, Part VI, Line 3 Patient education of eligibility for assistance","The Registration Department informs all patients about the Financial Assistance Policy and provides applications and brochures upon request. They are printed and readily available. This packet contains a letter identifying financial assistance opportunities offered to our patients as well as a financial assistance application. At the time of registration, a brochure is provided to self-pay patients upon registration regarding the Financial Assistance Program available to them at HSHS St. Elizabeth's. The brochures are also supplied in waiting and ancillary areas for easy access by the patient. The hospital has onsite advocates to assist patients with enrollment in several federal, state and local government programs. These Advocates visit patients while in the hospital or contact them by phone once discharged. The advocates will also make home visits as needed to assist patients with enrollment as well as gathering necessary documents for application. We also offer an online business office portal that provides information on how to read and understand HSHS St. Elizabeth's billing information. HSHS St. Elizabeth's website provides an explanation of Medicare forms at www.steliz.org. Each statement that a patient receives contains information about our Financial Assistance Program and a phone number for assistance with applying. Any patient visiting the onsite financial counselor as well as contacting us via phone are given information about payment options including our financial assistance options. Even after an account is sent to a collection agency and/or anytime in the process they believe a patient may be eligible for financial assistance, the account is returned to the hospital for evaluation. HSHS St. Elizabeth's makes their financial assistance application and standard response letters available in Spanish, as well as English. Patients are also provided a Fair Billing Act notification at the point of registration regarding separate physician billing they can expect to receive, plus information about the patient's financial responsibility if their insurance plan is out of network. A system called Payment Navigator is now being utilized after failed attempts have been made by the hospital to receive payment, but before sending to a collection agency. That system accesses credit and other information and allows us to see the probability of a patient being able to pay their bill. After assessing that information, the hospital determines whether to grant charity care or continue collection efforts."

The service area consists of the following communities: St. Clair, Monroe, Madison, and Clinton counties. The population of these counties is 270,056, 32,957, 269,282, and 37,762 respectively. The population increased in the service area by 5.51% between 2000 and 2010. The population in HSHS St. Elizabeth's service area had a similar age distribution as the state as a whole. Belleville, the county seat of St. Clair county, has median household income is $49,634 compared to the national median income of $53,271. More than 85,000 residents (14.0%) in the service area live below poverty. Thirty percent of the area's population lives below 200% of the poverty level.

Hospitals that also provide service include five hospitals in Madison County, one hospital in Clinton County, three hospitals in St. Clair County with one being a FQHC, and no hospitals in Monroe county. The hospital does not exclude Medically Underserved Areas (MUAs), low income or minority populations from its service area."
201821309349300642,370663567,"Schedule H, Part VI, Line 5 Promotion of community health","As a healing ministry of the Catholic Church and an affiliate of Hospital Sisters Health System (HSHS), HSHS St. Elizabeth's is committed to delivering high quality, compassionate, and cost-effective health care services to all. Founded in 1875, the hospital brings a healing presence and improves the health of our community, especially for those persons who are sick, poor, and disadvantaged. Because of the hospital's mission and heritage, the hospital is dedicated to promoting the health of St. Clair County and the surrounding counties of Madison, Clinton, and Monroe. The hospital is governed by a Board of Directors, at least a majority of whom reside in the hospital's primary service area and who are neither employees nor independent contractors of the hospital (nor family members thereof). The Board ensures that HSHS St. Elizabeth's is responding to community need. In FY2017, for example, the board reviewed the Community Benefit implementation plan and was especially impressed by the work at Cosgrove's Kitchen. In addition, the Hospital Advisory/Community Benefit Committee expanded membership to complement the CHNA priority needs. Along with this committee, the Foundation and our volunteer auxiliary group advocate on behalf of the hospital in the community. Consistent with its exempt purpose, HSHS St. Elizabeth's has an open medical staff with privileges available to all qualified physicians in the area. The hospital also operates an Emergency Department that is open 24 hours to all persons regardless of their ability to pay. As a not-for-profit hospital, HSHS St. Elizabeth's reinvests surplus funds to support the mission of the organization and health of the community rather than distributing surplus funds as profits to shareholders or individuals. Funds not committed to ongoing operations are generally used to upgrade facilities, secure new technologies, improve patient care, and support initiatives designed to promote health and ensure access for all along with providing medical education and research. Replacement Hospital HSHS St. Elizabeth's largest capital investment is the replacement hospital. With the support of the Hospital Sisters and HSHS, HSHS St. Elizabeth's began the journey years ago, and it will soon be a reality. With the expected patient move date on November 4, 2017, the investment in the new hospital is not merely an investment in bricks and mortar, but in state-of-the-art equipment and patient care. The 144-bed, patient centered facility is built on a 120-acre campus with an adjoining ambulatory care center. The new campus will enhance HSHS St. Elizabeth's ability to develop an integrated care delivery model that will serve residents from across southwestern Illinois for decades to come. The new hospital will offer the latest technology in nearly every department. For example, the lab will be automated, dramatically saving the precious Medical Laboratory Scientists (MLS) resources to complete the more advanced testing; pharmacy will have an automatic dispensing unit; and ultrasound will offer 4D capability. Throughout the process, identifying capital purchases for the new hospital was also balanced with the need for equipment to care for our patients on our current campus. A prime example of this is that HSHS St. Elizabeth's had initially planned to take the existing ventilators to the new hospital due to budgetary constraints. While the existing ventilators were functional, they were starting to show their age. With the savings realized from negotiating other equipment, HSHS St. Elizabeth's purchased new ventilators that allow for a common platform to treat neonates to adults with one ventilator, as well as the ability to interface with EPIC, our new electronic health care record (EHR). HSHS St. Elizabeth's will also start up a new electronic medical record (EHR) on the day of the move to the new campus. Along with this interface, we will obtain the ability to track and monitor all quality metrics with the ventilators in any area of the hospital. Capital Purchasing HSHS St. Elizabeth's utilizes a multi-disciplinary task force to prioritize capital projects. The team reviewed every desired asset and prioritized the list, both clinical and non-clinical to determine which assets to purchase during the year. The criteria used in the evaluation process include: patient and colleague safety, regulatory requirements, infection prevention, equipment age and usage, physician needs and financial information. One example was the purchase and standardization of new defibrillators and crash carts to ensure patient safety and compliance. The Imaging department procured new equipment for several areas including mammography, ultrasound, and nuclear medicine. A new stereotactic biopsy machine was purchased and allows for a more definitive diagnosis. The ultrasound machine increased the scope of testing and the nuclear medicine scanner was obsolete and needed replacement. The additional benefit of purchasing this equipment before the move allows colleagues to train and be proficient which will decrease training time at the new facility. Reinvestment of support services for the community Since 2013, HSHS St. Elizabeth's has utilized telehealth technology to enhance access to health care. We continue to be an Emergent Stroke Ready hospital but we also expanded our services to include pediatrics. In July 2016, HSHS St. Elizabeth's and SSM Health Cardinal Glennon Children's Hospital partnered to bring region leading expertise on pediatric care to Belleville, O'Fallon, and many other communities throughout St. Clair County. Board-certified pediatric physicians are available 24/7 in the Emergency Department and they are readily available to support the newborn nursery in our Mother Child Center. With the support of our telehealth project manager, HSHS St. Elizabeth's further expanded its telehealth services to include pediatrics at our sister facilities of HSHS St. Joseph's Hospital in Breese and HSHS St. Joseph's Hospital in Highland. Through telehealth technology, children that present at either hospital can be quickly connected with SSM Health Cardinal Glennon pediatricians who are at HSHS St. Elizabeth's. The high-resolution video and audio communication provides an interactive experience with the consulting physician who is connected in real-time. The benefit of tele-pediatrics is to prevent delay of care when time is of the essence, especially in an emergency. Children are observed and treated, often without the need for transfer. Other service lines include cardiology and neurology. A cardiologist at HSHS St. Elizabeth's can remote into HSHS St. Joseph's Hospital in Highland when a cardiologist is not readily available. The robot also assists with neurology cases at all three hospitals for Inpatient and Emergency Department care. The benefits of telehealth medicine include faster access to board-certified specialists close to home and near their support systems. It also encourages utilization of local community resources, such as rehabilitation services. HSHS St. Elizabeth's Hospital strives to keep people who suffer from cancer in their community, close to their support systems, and most importantly, actively involved in decisions about their care and treatment. As a recent recipient of Cancer Accreditation through the Commission on Cancer, HSHS St. Elizabeth's provides patients with guaranteed access to important components of treatment recommended by the Health and Medicine Division, National Cancer Comprehensive Network, and the American Society of Clinical Oncology. Patients are treated by a multidisciplinary oncology team and informed about clinical research studies and trial options. As part of the accreditation process, HSHS St. Elizabeth's also implemented an Oncology Wellness Program. The Oncology Wellness Program assists those undergoing cancer treatments to receive the full spectrum of quality care and quality of life care from cancer diagnosis, before, during, and after treatment. Pre-treatment consists of a functional assessment, education, and a home exercise program. During and after treatment, the team evaluates and creates a plan to assist with physical, occupational and speech therapy. A chaplain is also on the care team to assist with emotional and spiritual care. HSHS St. Elizabeth's added the services of a Nurse Navigator to further support and advocate for our cancer patients and their care givers. The Nurse Navigator is a liaison for newly diagnosed cancer patients by providing information and resources to facilitate informed decision making and timely access to health care. The Nurse Navigator helps patients keep track of appointments; educate, guide and empower their decision-making during treatment; and identify and connect patients to other resource in the community."
201821309349300642,370663567,"Schedule H, Part VI, Line 6 Affiliated health care system","HSHS St. Elizabeth's Hospital is an affiliate of Hospital Sisters Health System (HSHS), a health care ministry that includes 15 hospitals, numerous community-based health centers and clinics, and hundreds of physician partners across Illinois and Wisconsin. The mission of HSHS is ""to reveal and embody Christ's healing love for all people through our high-quality Franciscan health care ministry."" We live our mission by providing holistic healing to all who seek our care, as well as through Community Benefit. In tandem with others in the communities we serve, our Community Benefit initiatives are strategically increasing access to care, improving the health status of residents, and increasing medical education and knowledge. In FY2017, our hospitals responded to the top needs identified in each of their most recent Community Health Needs Assessments (CHNAs). The information gathered from these assessments was used to develop or enhance Community Benefit programs and services to best address community health needs. Among the priority needs identified in the most recent CHNA process were access to care; alcohol, tobacco, and other drug abuse; chronic disease prevention and management; nutrition/wellness; mental health; and oral health. HSHS hospitals are proactively addressing these and other needs through patient, provider and community education, preventative screenings, self-management classes, and new or enhanced clinical services. In FY2017, HSHS collectively provided $197.6 million in Community Benefit (9.2% of total hospital expenses). This amount included $26.0 million provided for Financial Assistance (a.k.a. Charity Care) and $128.6 million for unreimbursed care provided as part of the Medicaid program. In addition, HSHS hospitals committed significant resources to treat Medicare patients. The cost of providing services to primarily elderly beneficiaries of the Medicare program - in excess of governmental and managed care contract payments - was $205.9 million. HSHS hospitals also recorded $40.9 million in uncollectible accounts. While HSHS does not count the latter two amounts as Community Benefit, they nonetheless reflect our commitment to serving all persons in need of care. In addition to the dollars invested in our Community Benefit programs, HSHS continues to reinvest any surplus revenue from operations and investments into new medical technology, facility infrastructure and health care services in our communities. By doing so, we ensure our ability to meet the ongoing demand for high quality, efficient and easily accessible health care. Improve access to health care As a Franciscan health care ministry, HSHS is deeply committed to serving those who are most in need with a special focus on the poor and vulnerable. We not only provide care to every patient who walks through our doors, but also reach out beyond the walls of our hospitals and clinics to care for those in our communities. Our efforts to ensure residents in the communities we serve receive the right care, at the right time, and in the right setting involve collaborating with others to achieve this goal. Across our two-state System, there are numerous examples of partnerships with departments of public health, other health care facilities and community and social service organizations to enhance access to care for those in need. In FY2017, HSHS and our 15 hospitals dedicated Community Benefit resources to educate uninsured persons about enrollment opportunities in affordable health care coverage and to facilitate the enrollment process. Studies have shown that people without insurance are more likely to postpone care and develop more severe and expensive conditions than their insured counterparts. It is for this reason that the Catholic Church, Catholic health care and HSHS have long promoted ""coverage and access for all."" HSHS and our 15 hospitals in partnership with local health departments, social service agencies and other health care providers played a vital role in educating eligible people in their service areas, by referring people to Certified Application Counselors and/or in enrolling them in the health insurance exchanges, or by helping them to obtain coverage through Medicaid expansion. In southern Illinois, HSHS St. Elizabeth's Hospital in Belleville is committed to improving access to health care services by assisting eligible patients to enroll in health care plans. In FY2017, more than 3,200 patients were screened and 74% met eligibility criteria and were enrolled in Medicaid. Access to health care is not limited to insurance coverage and access to primary care providers. In FY2017, the hospital assisted patients with access to medications, durable medical equipment, and transportation including more than $5,600 in cab and bus tickets for patients and $14,000 for patients who needed transfer by ambulance. In response to its FY2015 CHNA, HSHS St. John's Hospital in Springfield, Illinois established a community health worker program to increase access to health care and coordination of care for residents of the Enos Park Neighborhood. The hospital also helped establish an Enos Park Neighborhood Advisory Council and Providers Alliance as part of the access collaborative to drive behavior changes and improve health outcomes. In the first three years, the program has realized 93% engagement of 300 clients. Services rendered include basic needs and health care access. Sixteen formally homeless individuals or families were placed in affordable, safe housing. Of the 35 parolees in the program, the recidivism rate was only 18% compared to 60% nationwide. The only reason participating parolees went back to prison was because of lack of a job or housing. One-hundred percent of our clients saw a primary care provider and 84% were connected to a medical home. This program is being replicated in a second location in Sangamon County's eastside where our most vulnerable, low-income and underserved populations exist. Through the support of HSHS St. Mary's Hospital Medical Center and St. Vincent Hospital in Green Bay, the Oral Health Partnership (OHP) continues to expand to communities throughout Brown County, providing dental care to 0 - 19 year olds who are uninsured or underinsured. In FY2017, more than 12,000 general dentistry procedures, including exams, X-rays, cleanings, fillings, and crowns, were completed for youth in Brown County's smaller, less urban communities, and more than 1,300 preventative sealants were applied. OHP serves more than 9,000 kids each year through three fixed-site clinics and the traveling school-based program. In January 2017, OHP's West location was opened in response to data showing an unmet need of medical assistance children in the Ashwaubenon area. This clinic, along with the traveling school-based team, will help OHP and HSHS reach the goal of expanding services to a wider population of Brown County children in need. HSHS St. Francis Hospital in Litchfield, Illinois collaborated with Lewis & Clark Community College and local dental providers to bring the College's mobile dental health unit to the Litchfield area; the unit provides free or low cost dental exams and screenings, x-rays and hygiene services. In addition, three local dental providers also participated by opening their offices and donating time, staff and supplies to provide either a free filling, extraction or hygiene services. Beginning in 2015, the hospital collaborated with Catholic Charities to launch a dental voucher program. Five dentists in Macoupin and Montgomery counties participate in the program, which covers an initial exam and x-rays, one tooth extraction and up to three fillings per year per individual. The percentage of total emergency department visits related to dental issues has decreased from 2.2% in 2011 to .95% in 2016 because of this collaboration. In southeast Illinois, area residents can get help filling a prescription through the long-term collaboration between HSHS St. Anthony's Memorial Hospital in Effingham and Catholic Charities. In FY2017, St. Anthony's Memorial Hospital helped to underwrite the cost of prescription medications for 246 residents. St. Anthony's Memorial Hospital and Catholic Charities believe no one should be without prescriptions because of the inability to pay."

201811279349301781,231352222,Part VI - Needs Assessment,"WellSpan Health and its entities have a long history of understanding and responding to the needs of the communities and populations it serves. This commitment was strengthened in 1998 when, in partnership with the Healthy York County Coalition, WellSpan conducted its first Community Health Needs Assessment (CHNA). Five subsequent CHNAs were conducted in 2000, 2005, 2008, 2012 and 2015. These assessments one method for collecting diverse information on a community and which involves surveying a representative sample of community members on their demographics, chronic health conditions, lifestyle behaviors, finances, access to health services, and related topics have been administered before the Affordable Care Act (ACA) requirement. As previously noted, the WellSpan CHNA process, which includes survey development, data collection and analysis, and result dissemination, was led by both county-level health coalitions Healthy Adams County and the Healthy York County Coalition. These coalitions receive financial support from WellSpan Health and its entities, and other community stakeholders. The following community organizations partnered to provide guidance and support to the 2015 CHNA: County of York; Family First Health; Hanover Hospital; TrueNorth Wellness Services; United Way of York County; York City Health Bureau; York College of Pennsylvania, and; York County Community Foundation. Additional consulting support was provided through a contract with the Floyd Institute for Public Policy at Franklin and Marshall College. Dr. Berwood Yost, Institute Director and Project has an extensive background conducting and analyzing community and corporate surveys, and has been integral to the prior two CHNAs (2008 and 2012). This collaboration of community stakeholders: determined the survey questions to be asked of the community; discussed data collection methodology, including sample size and method of obtaining data; reviewed the raw data and supporting charts/graphs; identified potential community health priorities, and; developed the process by which results and priorities were to be shared with the community.The 2015 CHNA planning process engaged a wide range of community organizations serving the diverse interests of all partners without burdening CHNA respondents with too many questions. Committee members reviewed questions asked in the 2012 CHNA and edited accordingly based on the current health care environment and areas of interest. Survey questions were derived from the Behavioral Risk Factor Surveillance System (BRFSS), a validated survey tool utilized by the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC), and organized into four categories: healthcare access, behavioral risk, health conditions, and prevention behaviors and context. A representative sample of 1,028 adult residents in York County were interviewed between October 27 and December 12, 2014. Supplemental secondary data from the Robert Wood Johnson Foundation (RWJF) annual County Health Rankings and from the Pennsylvania Department of Health was compiled and integrated into the 2015 CHNA. Data collected and analyzed by the Floyd Institute for Public Policy included breakdowns by age, gender, geographic area, race/ethnicity, and income level, and enabled the development of charts/graphs focused on: quantity of residents affected; health risks and disability-adjusted life years; correlates of obesity and depression (two significant health priorities); health disparities, and; social determinants of health impact. This information is included in the 2015 Community Health Needs Assessment Summary Report available at www.wellspan.org. In 2015, CHNA results and related priorities identified by the Healthy York County Coalition were shared with the system-wide Planning Committee at WellSpan Health. This Committee is comprised of community members and leaders that represent each of WellSpans primary entities and service areas, in addition to corporate leadership. Planning Committee members reviewed the CHNA data, adopted HYCCs priorities of adult overweight/obesity, depression/mental health, and maternal/child health while also identifying two additional priorities pertinent to WellSpan Health: access related to gaps in care caused by high-deductible insurance plans and the emerging opioid misuse and abuse issue facing the community. These five priorities and associated data were subsequently presented to the WellSpan-York Hospital Board for their adoption. Board members discussed the data and identified priorities within the context of existing staffing and financial resources, current and future entity initiatives, and community partnership opportunities to address systemic community change."
201811279349301781,231352222,Part VI - Explanation Of How Organization Furthers Its Exempt Purpose,"Historically, WellSpan Health and its entities have taken planned steps to build community capacity that addresses complex health issues, as identified by the Community Health Needs Assessment (CHNA). Through financial and management support of a county health coalition, the Healthy York County Coalition (HYCC), more than 200 York County community members have been engaged in community health improvement initiatives. HYCC consists of three committees Access and Empowerment; Community Engagement, and; Prevention and Wellness, each of which continue to attract new community members, leaders, and professionals. These committees foster partnerships and collaboration between entities to ensure that efforts to address and impact identified community health needs are coordinated and successful. As a charitable, community-based healthcare organization, our commitment to improving the lives and well-being of the people and communities we serve is evident in our mission statement: Working as one to improve health through exceptional care for all, lifelong wellness, and healthier communities. Employees live out this mission statement every day by engaging in community benefit activities that address community needs, especially the five health priorities identified in the 2015 CHNA adult overweight/obesity; access related to gaps in care caused by high-deductible insurance plans; depression/mental health; maternal/child health, and opioid misuse and abuse. Below are a few examples of the work accomplished to address each:*Access to healthcare and medications for uninsured community members or those with high out-of-pocket costs is often financially challenging. Healthy Community Network, a collaborative between WellSpan Health, physicians and community partners to support prospective enrollment, the management and support of patients, and coordination of care, serves as a support for those individuals, offering free or discounted resources based on need. In addition, through support of the Family First Health Hannah Penn Center, 2,074 acute and preventative visits were provided to underserved adults and children. *Feeling Blue, an online depression awareness campaign (www.feeling-blue.com) launched in November 2014, continues to demonstrate increased online traffic (viewer hits). The campaign is designed to encourage individuals who are feeling blue or suffering from mild depression to engage in non-medical means of managing their symptoms (i.e., healthy eating, increased physical activity, social support). Since its launch, the Feeling Blue campaign committee with representation by behavioral health providers across the community - annually updates the website with new information to support community members suffering from mild depression as well as working to reduce the social stigma associated with this prevalent mental health condition. *In 2017, WellSpan Health celebrated the 5th anniversary of its regional 10Lb. Throwdown initiative, a 10-week community challenge that encourages participants to lose or maintain a healthy weight through healthier eating and increased physical activity. The initiative was created to address the growing issue of adult overweight/obesity, and utilizes a core website (www.10poundthrowdown.com) to encourage team participation and to offer an online weight tracker, badges to encourage healthier choices, and diverse health education resources. More than 6200 community members across four southcentral Pennsylvania counties Adams, Lancaster, Lebanon, and York participated in the 2017 iteration of the 10Lb. Throwdown program; this represents a 66.5% increase over the prior years program enrollment.*Through a community partnership grant, WellSpan-York Hospital has helped York Fresh Farms build a cold storage room to keep its harvest of locally-grown food on its two urban farms fresh and readily accessible to underserved community members.*Celebrating nearly a decade of promoting summertime physical activity, Get Outdoors (GO) York!, a partnership between WellSpan-York Hospital and York County Libraries, 10,928 children participated in an adaptation of letterboxing, an international hobby where participants use written clues to find items hidden in various places. More than 1200 participants (11.8%) submitted their program rubbing sheets and collectively walked a total of 25,573 miles. *Opioid use, as in other communities across the United States, has become a crisis in York County. WellSpan Health staff regularly participate in community-level opioid dialogues, and on the Opioid Aware coalition, a regional multi-sector collaborative seeking to create coordinated messaging, outreach and management of opioid users in southcentral Pennsylvania.Community members are also vital to furthering our exempt purpose by actively volunteering their time and donating financial resources to health-related initiatives. During the fiscal year, contributions to the York Health Foundation and York Hospital Auxiliary supported: completion of a new behavioral health unit in the emergency department of WellSpan-York Hospital; a breastfeeding program; Cribs for Kids, an initiative of Safe Kids York County and the NICU at WellSpan-York Hospital, and; expansion of the Hoodner Dental Center. Additional examples of how WellSpan-York Hospital fulfilled its community mission in York County may be found in the 2017 WellSpan Community Benefit Report Its What Neighbors Do available online at www.wellspan.org."

The organization and its affiliates prepare and issue audited consolidated financial statements. The system's allowance for doubtful accounts (bad debt expense) methodology and financial assistance policies are consistently applied across all hospital affiliates. The attached text was obtained from the footnotes to the audited consolidated financial statements of the organization and its affiliates. Charitable medical care provided Tju provides medically necessary services to all patients regardless of their ability to pay. Some patients qualify for charity care based on policies established by tju and are therefore not responsible for payment for all or a part of their healthcare services. These policies allow for the provision of free or discounted care in circumstances where requiring payment would impose financial hardship on the patient. Charges for services rendered to patients who meet tjus guidelines for charity care are not separately recorded in the accompanying consolidated financial statements. Tju maintains records to identify and monitor the level of charity care provided. These records include the amount of charges foregone for services and supplies furnished. Such amounts have been excluded from net patient service revenue. Management estimates that the cost of charity care provided by tju was $28.6 million and $21.8 million for the years ended june 30, 2017 and 2016, respectively. These amounts are not included the provision for bad debts of $124.8 million and $102.7 million in 2017 and 2016, respectively, which are reflected as deductions in net patient service revenue. The estimated costs of providing charity services are based on a calculation which applies a ratio of costs to charges to the gross uncompensated charges associated with providing care to charity patients. The ratio of cost to charges is calculated based on the tju total expenses divided by gross patient service revenue. Net patient service revenue Net patient service revenue is reported at the estimated net realizable amounts from patients, third-party payers and others for services rendered, including estimated retroactive adjustments under reimbursement agreements with third-party payers. Retroactive adjustments are considered in the recognition of revenue on an estimated basis in the period the related services are rendered and are adjusted in future periods as final settlements are determined. Revenue from the medicare and medicaid fee-for-service programs accounted for approximately 23.5% and 3.0%, respectively, and 24.1% and 3.3%, respectively of net patient service revenue in 2017 and 2016, respectively. Most payments to tju from the medicare and pennsylvania medicaid programs for inpatient hospital services are made on a prospective basis. Under these programs, payments are made at a pre-determined specific rate for each discharge based on a patients diagnosis. Additional payments are made to tju as a teaching and disproportionate share hospitals, as well as for cases that have an extremely long length-of-stay or unusually high costs. Laws governing the medicare and medicaid programs are complex and subject to interpretation. Services billed to the medicare program are subject to external review for both medical necessity and billing compliance. Medicare cost reports for all years, except 2011, 2015, 2016 and 2017 have been audited and final settled as of june 30, 2017. No significant adjustments are expected. In addition, tju received funds from the philadelphia hospital assessment program and the medical assistance modernization act-quality care assessment program in the amount of $125.3 million and $93.5 million in 2017 and 2016, respectively, and are recorded in net patient service revenue. Tju paid taxes in respect to these programs amounting to $95.29 million and $78.9 million in 2017 and 2016, respectively, and are recorded in other operating expenses.

201831359349306048,231352152,"SCHEDULE H, PART III, SECTION B; LINE 8","Financial information listed on schedule h part iii lines 5, 6 & 7 were derived from the hospital's cost accounting system and not the 2016 filed Medicare cost report. Using the cost report would result in an decrease to the amount on line 5 of $17,322,181 and a decrease to line 6 of $23,105,882. Medicare underpayments and bad debt are community benefit and associated costs are includable on the form 990, schedule h, part i. The organization believes that medicare underpayments (shortfall) and bad debt are community benefit and associated costs are includable on the form 990, schedule h, part i. As outlined more fully below the organization believes that these services and related costs promote the health of the community as a whole and are rendered in conjunction with the organization's charitable tax-exempt purposes and mission in providing medically necessary healthcare services to all individuals in a non-discriminatory manner without regard to race, color, national origin, gender, gender identity or expression, sexual orientation, age, status as an individual with a handicap/disability or ability to pay and consistent with the community benefit standard promulgated by the irs. The community benefit standard is the current standard for a hospital for recognition as a tax-exempt and charitable organization under internal revenue code (""irc"") 501(c)(3). The organization is recognized as a tax-exempt entity and charitable organization under 501(c)(3) of the irc. Although there is no definition in the tax code for the term ""charitable"" a regulation promulgated by the department of the treasury provides some guidance and states that ""the term charitable is used in section 501(c)(3) in its generally accepted legal sense,provides examples of charitable purposes, including the relief of the poor or unprivileged; the promotion of social welfare; and the advancement of education, religion, and science. Note it does not explicitly address the activities of hospitals. In the absence of explicit statutory or regulatory requirements applying the term ""charitable"" to hospitals, it has been left to the irs to determine the criteria hospitals must meet to qualify as irc 501(c)(3) charitable organizations. The original standard was known as the charity care standard. This standard was replaced by the irs with the community benefit standard which is the current standard. Charity care standard In 1956, the irs issued revenue ruling 56-185, which addressed the requirements hospitals needed to meet in order to qualify for irc 501(c)(3) status. One of these requirements is known as the ""charity care standard."" under the standard, a hospital had to provide, to the extent of its financial ability, free or reduced-cost care to patients unable to pay for it. A hospital that expected full payment did not, according to the ruling, provide charity care based on the fact that some patients ultimately failed to pay. The ruling emphasized that a low level of charity care did not necessarily mean that a hospital had failed to meet the requirement since that level could reflect its financial ability to provide such care. The ruling also noted that publicly supported community hospitals would normally qualify as charitable organizations because they serve the entire community and a low level of charity care would not affect a hospital's exempt status if it was due to the surrounding community's lack of charitable demands. Community benefit standard In 1969, the irs issued revenue ruling 69-545, which ""remove(d)"" from revenue ruling 56-185 ""the requirements relating to caring for patients without charge or at rates below cost."" under the standard developed in revenue ruling 69-545, which is known as the ""community benefit standard,"" hospitals are judged on whether they promote the health of a broad class of individuals in the community. The ruling involved a hospital that only admitted individuals who could pay for the services (by themselves, private insurance, or public programs such as medicare), but operated a full-time emergency room that was open to everyone. The irs ruled that the hospital qualified as a charitable organization because it promoted the health of people in its community. The irs reasoned that because the promotion of health was a charitable purpose according to the general law of charity, it fell within the ""generally accepted legal sense"" of the term ""charitable,"" as required by treas. Reg. 1.501(c)(3)-1(d)(2). The irs ruling stated that the promotion of health, like the relief of poverty and the advancement of education and religion, is one of the purposes in the general law of charity that is deemed beneficial to the community as a whole even though the class of beneficiaries eligible to receive a direct benefit from its activities does not include all members of the community, such as indigent members of the community, provided that the class is not so small that its relief is not of benefit to the community. The irs concluded that the hospital was ""promoting the health of a class of persons that is broad enough to benefit the community"" because its emergency room was open to all and it provided care to everyone who could pay, whether directly or through third-party reimbursement. Other characteristics of the hospital that the irs highlighted included the following: its surplus funds were used to improve patient care, expand hospital facilities, and advance medical training, education, and research; it was controlled by a board of trustees that consisted of independent civic leaders; and hospital medical staff privileges were available to all qualified physicians. The american hospital association (""aha"") believes that medicare underpayments (shortfall) and bad debt are community benefit and thus includable on the form 990, schedule h, part i. This organization agrees with the aha position. As outlined in the aha letter to the irs dated august 21, 2007 with respect to the first published draft of the new form 990 and schedule h, the aha felt that the irs should incorporate the full value of the community benefit that hospitals provide by counting medicare underpayments (shortfall) as quantifiable community benefit for the following reasons: - providing care for the elderly and serving medicare patients is an essential part of the community benefit standard. - medicare, like medicaid, does not pay the full cost of care. Recently, medicare reimburses hospitals only 92 cents for every dollar they spend to take care of medicare patients. The medicare payment advisory commission (""medpac"") in its march 2007 report to congress cautioned that underpayment will get even worse, with margins reaching a 10-year low at negative 5.4 percent. - many medicare beneficiaries, like their medicaid counterparts, are poor. More than 46 percent of medicare spending is for beneficiaries whose income is below 200 percent of the federal poverty level. Many of those medicare beneficiaries are also eligible for medicaid -- so called eligibles."" There is every compelling public policy reason to treat medicare and medicaid underpayments similarly for purposes of a hospital's community benefit and include these costs on form 990, schedule h, part i. Medicare underpayment must be shouldered by the hospital in order to continue treating the community's elderly and poor. These underpayments represent a real cost of serving the community and should count as a quantifiable community benefit. Both the aha and this organization also feel that patient bad debt is a community benefit and thus includable on the form 990, schedule h, part i. Like medicare underpayment (shortfalls), there also are compelling reasons that patient bad debt should be counted as quantifiable community benefit as follows: - a significant majority of bad debt is attributable to low-income patients, who, for many reasons, decline to complete the forms required to establish eligibility for hospitals' charity care or financial assistance programs. A 2006 congressional budget office (""cbo"") report, nonprofit hospitals and the provision of community benefits, cited two studies indicating that ""the great majority of bad debt was attributable to patients with incomes below 200% of the federal poverty line."" - the report also noted that a substantial portion of bad debt is pending charity care. Unlike bad debt in other industries, hospital bad debt is complicated by the fact that hospitals follow their mission to the community and treat every patient that comes through their emergency department, regardless of ability to pay. Patients who have outstanding bills are not turned away, unlike other industries. Bad debt is further complicated by the auditing industry's standards on reporting charity care. Many patients cannot or do not provide the necessary, extensive documentation required to be deemed charity care by auditors. As a result, roughly 40% of bad debt is pending charity care. - the cbo"
201831359349306048,231352152,"SCHEDULE H, PART III, SECTION C; QUESTION 9B","For the abington health community, every attempt will be made to identify patients having an inability to pay in order to assess the patient for financial assistance from either outside resources (e.g., ma, chip, etc.) Or via the hospital policy for financial assistance. Patients will receive one (1) hospital generated statement indicating their responsibilities and payment due dates. The statements include information regarding the availability of financial assistance. If, in the course of communication with the patient, there is an indication that the patient cannot pay the balance, the patient is given the opportunity to set up a payment plan, and where appropriate, information related to available financial assistance. Anywhere along the continuum of collections, whether it be via internal staff or extended outsourced agencies, patients are offered the opportunity to apply for financial assistance. For the uninsured: at the time of registration, abington health financial counseling staff will determine that the patient is uninsured. Whenever possible, an assessment will be done regarding eligibility for medical assistance and/or financial assistance. Patients with the designation of uninsured can and should be encouraged to apply for the financial assistance program anytime a hardship in paying the discount amount is identified. If assistance is approved, the percentage discount will be applied to the medicare fee-for-service rates in place at the time of service. Accounts considered to be charity care are not included in the bad debt expense, but rather, accounted for as an allowance. It is the policy of the abington health system business office, and all its hospital affiliates, to treat all patients equally regardless of insurance and their ability to pay. For accounts determined to be ""self-payor accounts with balances after primary insurance payments, the collection policy requires: sending one statement, then referral to an outside extended business office agency who performs follow up via statements and telephone contact for 90 days. The facility also has a financial assistance policy to assure patients are provided with charity care assistance determined by state and federal regulations. It is the policy to inform all patients deemed self-pay of the appropriate assistance programs available. Patients applying for financial assistance will be financially screened by a resource advisor to determine eligibility according to state and federal guidelines and will be informed of documentation needed to complete a charity care application. Patients not eligible for charity care and/or financial assistance will be financially counseled for all other options. Qualified patients will be referred to all appropriate agencies or programs to meet other financial needs. At the time of the patient visit and part of the registration process at the facility, the following options are made available to patients: - a copy of the plain language summary is offered to the patient for their reference; - financial counseling for possible eligibility for medical assistance including medicaid and ssi; - financial counseling for possible eligibility for the hospital's financial assistance program; and, - financial arrangements including: 1. Cash/credit card (american express, discover, visa, mastercard), 2. Flexible payment plans. In addition to the above options, the facility has established a self-pay assistance program for our uninsured patients that do not qualify for medicaid or the hospital's financial assistance program."

The collaborative process for ah including abington memorial hospital and lansdale hospital corporation began in may 2015 when ah leaders reached out to our new jefferson colleagues at the center for urban health to begin a dialogue for the 2016 chna process. The enterprise team was formed with meetings, conference calls and discussions immediately following. Together a new chna model was created and together we agreed to continue with public health management corporation (""phmc"") household health survey for data and quantitative information. Numerous secondary data and literature sources, and internal experts and external representatives of healthcare and community based organizations who have knowledge of health and social conditions of these communities were represented in key interviews and small group meetings during the chna process. The community health needs assessment provides a definition of the community, the demographic and socioeconomic characteristics of the residents, and the existing healthcare resources. Immediately following were the needs assessments process and methods; findings; identification of unmet needs and asset mapping. Quantitative information from the u.s. census, pennsylvania department of health vital statistics and phmc's southeastern pa household health survey was analyzed for the hospital's service area using the statistical program for social sciences (""spss""). The unmet healthcare needs for this service area were identified and prioritized by comparing the health status, access to care, health behaviors, and utilization of services for residents of the service area to results for the county and state and the healthy people 2020 goals for the nation. In addition, for household health survey measures, tests of significance were conducted to identify and prioritize. This organization conducts a review of key factor information annually which includes: a review of healthcare utilization of its service area population by services (urology, cardiology, obstetrics, etc.) For determining increased or decreased health needs; healthcare service estimates and forecasts (both inpatient and outpatient); assessments of local demographic and socioeconomic information; and, a review of health status/needs assessments and studies conducted by external parties including phmc household health survey data; healthy people 2020; pa department of health, bureau of health statistics and research; behavioral risks of pa adults; minority health disparities in pennsylvania; death rates in pa, montgomery county and southeastern pennsylvania; county health rankings; national organization websites, i.e., american diabetes association, american heart association and american stroke association. Using the quantitative and qualitative data presented in the chna and a prioritization process, ah identified the most important priority health needs for the population of AMH'S community benefit areas which include: mental health services; social and healthcare needs of the older adults; obesity; alcohol/substance abuse; womens cancer; chronic disease management (diabetes, heart disease and hypertension, stroke, asthma); health education, social services and regular source of care. The community health department, working under the guidance of the abington health foundation community benefit committee is responsible for developing implementation plans focusing on priority issues and most important health needs. In addition, this organization works with local providers to plan and discuss health needs of the population. AMH continues to attend local and regional community organization meetings and county collaboratives for the greater abington area. Regional county collaboratives include the healthcare system with representation from local politicians, local community health centers, emergency health providers and other community health leaders. AMH worked with area hospitals and nonprofits to form the montgomery county health alliance which received pa state designation of ship status (state health improvement plan). In addition, during the chna process, abington health joined coach and the montgomery county hospital partnership."

HUH is a Level One (1) Trauma Center, offering comprehensive health care facilities in Washington, DC. HUH serves the Washington, DC population of approximately 660,000 people. HUH is a Disproportionate Share Hospital and in FY 2017 our general admittance payor mix for Medicare and Medicaid was 27% and 56%, respectively. Howard is among the top producers of black medical students. The mission of Howard University Hospital is the provision of excellence, service, education and research in an environment of safety. In furtherance of its commitment to education, the hospital maintains an environment that supports the training of postgraduate trainees, medical, dental, nursing and other students by health care practitioners. Between 2001 and 2005, the District of Columbia ranked sixth highest in the nation for cancer deaths, third highest in the nation for colorectal cancer deaths, and first in the nation for deaths due to prostate, cervical, and breast cancers. HUH's Cancer Center was established in order to serve minorities and underserved populations and to address health disparities. Thus, the mission of the Cancer Center is to reduce the burden of cancer through research, education, and service, with emphasis on the unique ethnic and cultural aspects of minority and underserved populations. The Cancer Center, under a grant from the District of Columbia Department of Health and the DC Cancer Consortium, offers free colon cancer screening to District of Columbia residents between the ages of 50 and 64 at Howard University Hospital.Howard University's Center for Sickle Cell Disease (SCD) was founded by the late Dr. Roland B.

It offers medical students a superior learning environment and opportunities to observe or participate in clinical and research work with professionals. HUH was established on the basis of being able to provide health care services to the underserved by providing a refuge where ex-slaves received the medical care they were denied elsewhere. In this regard, Howard University and HUH have offered the following programs during the year:Howard University College of Medicine - Provides students of high academic potential with a medical education of exceptional quality and prepares physicians and other health care professionals to serve the underserved. The emphasis is on developing skills and habits of life-long learning and producing world leaders in medicine. The College living alumni, more than 4,000, are a testimony that an excellent medical education can be obtained at Howard University. Although opportunities for minority students have increased at other medical schools, the College uniquely addresses the special health care needs of medically underserved communities and continues to produce a significant number of the nation's minority physicians.The College is a part of Howard University, a comprehensive research university. While the University community has traditionally been predominantly black, Howard University has been an interracial and cosmopolitan institution throughout its history, with students, faculty and staff of all races and from many foreign nations. All must meet the high standards of excellence of Howard University, which has the largest concentration of black faculty and student scholars in the country.

A patient is classified as a charity care patient by reference to established policies of the Hospital. Essentially, these policies define charity services as those services for which no payment is anticipated. In assessing a patient's inability to pay, the Hospital utilizes the generally recognized federal poverty income guidelines, but also includes certain cases where incurred charges are significant when compared to a responsible party's income and their countable assets. Those charges are not included in net patient service revenue for financial reporting purposes. Because the hospital is not paid for these services, they are considered to be community benefit. When private pay patients are sent to the collection agency their account is considered to be a bad debt. Subsequently, Medicaid may be granted for some of those patients. At that time those accounts would become charity care or a community benefit."

ADDITIONS TO THE ALLOWANCE FOR UNCOLLECTIBLE ACCOUNTS RESULT FROM THE PROVISION FOR UNCOLLECTIBLE ACCOUNTS. ACCOUNTS WRITTEN OFF AS UNCOLLECTIBLE ARE DEDUCTED FROM THE ALLOWANCE FOR UNCOLLECTIBLE ACCOUNTS. The Hospital's estimation of the allowance for uncollectible accounts is based primarily upon the type and age of the patient accounts receivable and the effectiveness of the Hospital's collection efforts. The Hospital's policy is to reserve a portion of all self-pay receivables, including amounts due from the uninsured and amounts related to co-payments and deductibles, as these charges are recorded. On a monthly basis, the Hospital reviews its accounts receivable balances and various analytics to support the basis for its estimates. These efforts primarily consist of reviewing the following: Historical write-off and collection experience using a hindsight or look-back approach; Revenue and volume trends by payor, particularly the self-pay components; Changes in the aging and payor mix of accounts receivable, including increased focus on accounts due from the uninsured and accounts that represent co-payments and deductibles due from patients; Cash collections as a percentage of net patient revenue less the provision for uncollectible accounts; and Trending of days revenue in accounts receivable The Hospital regularly performs hindsight procedures to evaluate historical write-off and collection experience throughout the year to assist in determining the reasonableness of its process for estimating the allowance for uncollectible accounts. The Hospital's primary concentration of credit risk is patient accounts receivable, which consists of amounts owed by various governmental agencies, insurance companies and private patients. The Hospital manages the receivables by regularly reviewing its patient accounts and contracts, and by providing appropriate allowances for uncollectible amounts. Significant concentrations of gross patient accounts receivable include 30%, 13% and 57% and 37%, 13% and 50% for Medicare, Medicaid and non-government payors, respectively, at September 30, 2016 and 2015, respectively."

Workgroups were created for chronic disease, mental health/substance abuse, access, and healthy aging. The community benefit in the Coalition Building category was provided through planning and development meetings, as well as programs for each priority area: Chronic Disease: -The Coalition for Healthy Kids was formed in 2009, and launched two initiatives to address rising childhood obesity rates. The Go! 5,2,1,0 Program and Students Can Run and Move (SCRAM) initiative focus on low income Hispanic children attending Title 1 elementary schools. Go! Engaged 1,351 children ages 2-19 in weekly health nutrition and fitness lessons. The program also works with 30 community sector sites in Danbury, including Childcare, After school, and camp programs. SCRAM is an after school program that has reached over 2,750 children and their parents in physical activity and nutrition programing. It educates families to reinforce healthy behaviors at home and features 45 minutes of daily physical activities and snacks after school. All initiatives were successful in reaching children in various settings and improving BMI 33% from 2012-2016 for all students participating. New additions to the plan include targeting fall prevention, conducting an inventory of all community prevention and maintenance programs, bridging the gap between healthcare and CPMP, and expanding health equity for low income populations. A Community Health Resource Guide is being developed for physicians and healthcare providers to refer their patients to community health programs. Mental Health and Substance Abuse: In January 2015, Danbury Hospital launched a community care team with the goal of targeting mental health and substance abuse populations. The formation of the Greater Danbury Community Care Team (CCT) has allowed us to deliver enhanced care to individuals with complex medical and psychosocial challenges. This broad community initiative provides wrap around services to individuals with housing instability suffering from mental health and/or substance abuse issues or serious medical conditions. Danbury Hospitals Greater Danbury CCT consists of approximately 35 representatives from local programs, agencies and institutions. The CCT meets weekly in the community to develop, review, implement, and monitor treatment plans for vulnerable populations. The CCT Navigator works to improve outcomes by referring targeted individuals to appropriate community-based mental health and substance abuse services and serving as a liaison to coordinate and leverage existing community-based resources. As of September 30, 2017, individualized care plans have been developed for more than 100 individuals. Outcomes for patients with care plans in place include maintained sobriety, mental health stabilization, improved access to care, a 43% reduction in inappropriate Emergency Department (ED) visits and reduced homelessness with more than 50 individuals assisted in finding stable housing. A new CCT was created to serve New Milford Hospitals community in March 2018. It has the same structure as Danbury Hospitals CCT and will serve the same function. The Western Connecticut Health Network, which includes Danbury Hospital, has formed a Medicare Shared Savings Program Accountable Care Organization (ACO) to work together to provide higher-quality coordinated care for our patients, while helping to slow health care cost growth. The ACO will also help to provide better care to Medicares seniors and people with disabilities. In addition to helping us serve our community members in a more comprehensive way, the ACO will help us identify gaps in care. CMS defines quality as meeting 33 identified benchmarks in 4 domains: Patient caregiver experience; care coordination; patient safety; preventative health; at-risk populations. The ACO has defined processes and procedures to promote evidence-based medicine and patient engagement and must report on quality and cost measures. It must also meet patient-centeredness criteria such as the use of patient and caregiver assessments or individualized care teams which will align with our current Greater Danbury CCT initiative to improve management of complex patients and reduce unnecessary emergency department visits and admissions. The ACO serves approximately 28,000 Medicare beneficiaries throughout our region. Healthy Aging: As a new initiative compared to previous CHIPs, healthy aging is focused on supporting those planning for healthy aging and those managing immediate needs for services and support. Their goal is to enhance education, advocacy, access, and communication to support ability of seniors to age in place. Initiatives include the CT Healthy Living Collective, Aging Mastery Program, and Living Well with Diabetes. Related to Line #2, Economic Development, and Line #7, Community Health Improvement Advocacy totaling $42,459: Various WCHN officials participated in Chamber of Commerce meetings and events, working to promote economic development in the Danbury Hospital area. State and local elected officials and agency heads were lobbied in support of maintaining patient access to essential services for the uninsured and underinsured.

To determine the cost of Medicaid services provided, a cost-to-charge ratio is applied to traditional and managed Medicaid gross charges captured in the patient accounting system and general ledger. Payments include payments for individual claims, payments from the Medicaid program paid outside the claim process (such as medical education payments) and expected or actual cost report settlements.Part I, line 7c: Unreimbursed costs from other means-tested government programs are computed by applying a cost-to-charge ratio to the total charges to patients covered under these programs.

The cost report segregates the total facility actual expenses into costs for support departments, clinical departments (routine and ancillary) and nonreimburseable departments. The cost report uses appropriate statistical bases to ""step down"" support costs to allowable clinical and nonreimburseable departments. The charges for clinical departments are matched to the total cost for these departments for a cost-to-charge ratio. Medicare-specific allowable costs for in- and outpatient ancillary departments are computed by applying the department-specific cost-to-charge ratio to the Medicare program charges by department. For routine departments, a per diem total cost is computed and applied to Medicare program days for the Medicare routine program cost.The organization feels the total shortfall of Medicare reimbursement compared to computed Medicare allowable costs should be treated as community benefit. The hospital improves access to patient care by providing services regardless of a patient's ability to pay or the hospital's ability to receive full cost reimbursement for services. The hospital also relieves the government of a financial burden when it provides care to publicly insured patients where reimbursement is less than cost of providing the service."

When a patient remits a payment on an account that has already been written off to bad debt expense, the payment is recorded as a recovery of bad debt, which reduces bad debt expense."

201821849349300212,541744931,"Part III, Line 8:","Medicare allowable costs reflected in Part III come directly from the facility's Medicare cost report. The cost report segregates the total facility actual expenses into costs for support departments, clinical departments (routine and ancillary) and nonreimburseable departments. The cost report uses appropriate statistical bases to ""step down"" support costs to allowable clinical and nonreimburseable departments. The charges for clinical departments are matched to the total cost for these departments for a cost-to-charge ratio. Medicare-specific allowable costs for in- and outpatient ancillary departments are computed by applying the department-specific cost-to-charge ratio to the Medicare program charges by department. For routine departments, a per diem total cost is computed and applied to Medicare program days for the Medicare routine program cost.The organization feels the total shortfall of Medicare reimbursement compared to computed Medicare allowable costs should be treated as community benefit. The hospital improves access to patient care by providing services regardless of a patient's ability to pay or the hospital's ability to receive full cost reimbursement for services. The hospital also relieves the government of a financial burden when it provides care to publicly insured patients where reimbursement is less than cost of providing the service."

201831319349302238,421264647,Pt VI Supplemental Information,"Schedule H Part 1 Line 6a For fiscal years prior to 2017, the Annual Report that included the Hospitals community benefit information was contained in a report prepared by the former parent organization, Wheaton Franciscan Services, Inc. However, effective May 1, 2016, the Iowa region of Wheaton Franciscan Healthcare was transferred to Mercy Health Network. As a result of this transfer, the Iowa region conducted their own audit, and prepared their own Community Benefit Reports for Fiscal 2016 and subsequent years. The fiscal 2017 community benefit report entitled moving our community forward can be accessed at this link: http://wfhcia.trinity-health.org/documents/2017%20community%20benefit%20re port.pdf. Schedule H Part 1 Line 7 Community Benefit amounts are reported using total actual costs per the hospitals managerial accounting system in use, which includes all patient segments including inpatient, outpatient, emergency room, private insurance, Medicaid, Medicare, Medicare HMO, uninsured, and self-pay patients. Medicare is reported using the most recently filed cost report at the time the Annual Report and related community benefit information is published. Amounts are summarized using a software application recommended by the Catholic Health Association in conjunction with the Iowa Hospital Association, because it has the ability to provide the information in a format suitable for Schedule H presentation. After the data is entered by the Site Finance Directors, its accuracy is verified by employees who are trained in community benefit reporting, and then approved by the Chief Financial Officer and the President/CEO of the Iowa organization. After amounts are verified and approved, community benefit amounts become finalized. Finally, the information is compiled with the assistance of CBISA software for presentation in IRS Forms 990 Schedule H and Statement of Program Service Accomplishments Part III. The Iowa hospital facilities are not required to report community benefit information to the State of Iowa, but do make the information readily available on certain websites, and report the information to the Iowa Hospital Association. Schedule H Part 1 Line 7 Column f Iowa Hospitals follow guidelines established by the Catholic Health Association and the Iowa Hospital Association, who recommend that bad debt expense not be included in community benefit amounts. As a result of this applied methodology, a total amount of $3,537,280 has not been included in the denominator of the calculation that determines the percentages reported on Schedule H Line 7 Column f. Schedule H Part 1 Line 7g In the Iowa region, clinic operations are included as a department of the hospital, Covenant Medical Center, Inc. Clinic operations for the Iowa clinics are included only in the community benefit reporting of charity care, government sponsored health care, and Medicare shortfall. Therefore, costs related to physician clinics are not included in subsidized health services reported on Schedule H Part I Line 7g. Schedule H Part III Section A Lines 1-3 In determining bad debt amounts, the Iowa organizations use a two-level scoring process as follows: First, for any patient account that is categorized as having no insurance, when the amount becomes 60 days overdue or greater, the patients account is reviewed for financial assistance qualification. If the patient is found to qualify for financial assistance, the necessary steps are taken to apply, and the needed adjustments are made so as to treat as charity care and not as bad debt. A similar scoring process is completed for those patients who do have insurance, but after 120 days or greater, still have not paid the patient responsibility portion. Again, these patient accounts are reviewed for financial assistance, and if they qualify, similar steps are taken to remove from bad debt. As a result of these scoring procedures, Iowas position is therefore that none of the patients resulting in uncollectible accounts would have qualified as charity care patients as this determination is made at the time of admission, or later with the timing of the scoring procedures mentioned above. Bad debt is therefore only determined for each organization at the time the amount due is truly determined to be uncollectible, after financial assistance has been determined, and after many months of collection efforts. Additionally, the organization followed guidelines established by the Catholic Health Association and the Iowa Hospital Association, who recommends that no bad debt amounts be included in community benefit amounts. For these reasons, Part III Section A Line 3 is reported at zero. Schedule H Part III Section A Line 4 Covenant Medical Center, Inc. is included in the consolidated financial statements of Wheaton Franciscan Healthcare - Iowa, Inc. The following is the text of the footnote from the financial statements which addresses the allowance for doubtful accounts. This footnote can be found on page 14 of the attached consolidated financial statements. Patient's account receivable are reduced by an allowance for uncollectible accounts. In evaluating the collectability of patient accounts receivable, the Hospitals analyze their past history and identify trends for each of their major payor sources of revenue to estimate the appropriate allowance for uncollectible accounts and provision for bad debts. Management regularly reviews data about these major payor sources of revenue in evaluating the sufficiency of the allowance for doubtful accounts. For receivables associated with services provided to patients who have third-party coverage, the Hospitals analyze contractually due amounts and provide an allowance for doubtful accounts and a provision for bad debts, if necessary. For receivables associated with patient responsibility (which includes both patients without insurance and patients with deductible and copayment balances due for which third-party coverage exists for part of the bill), the patients are screened against the Hospital's charity care policy and uninsured discount policy. Each charity care application is inspected even if a patient has insurance, as they may be underinsured and qualify for the charity care discount. For any remaining patient responsibility balance, the Hospitals record a provision for bad debts in the period of service on the basis of its past experience, which indicates that many patients are unable or unwilling to pay the portion of their bill for which they are financially responsible. The difference between the standard rates (or the discounted rates if negotiated) and the amounts actually collected after all reasonable collection efforts have been exhausted is charged off against the allowance for doubtful accounts. The Hospitals' allowance for uncollectible accounts for self-pay patients, which includes unisured patients and residual copayments and deductibles for which managed care has already paid, covers 65% of self-pay accounts receivable at June 30, 2017. The Hospitals do not maintain a material allowance for uncollectible accounts from third-party payors, nor did the Hospitals have significant write-offs from third-party payors. The Hospitals recognize patient service revenue associated with services provided to patients who have third-party payor coverage on the basis of contractual rates for the services rendered. For uninsured patients that do not qualify for charity care, the Hospitals recognize revenue for services provided (on the basis of discounted rates, as provided by policy). On the basis of historical experience, a portion of the Hospital's uninsured patients will be unable or unwilling to pay for the services provided. Thus, the Hospitals record a provision for bad debts related to uninsured patients in the period the services are provided. Schedule H Part III Section B Line 6-8 Schedule H Part III Section B Line 6 reports allowable costs of care as taken from the most recently filed Medicare cost report available at the time the Community Benefit Report is published. The Medicare cost report calculates its allowable total costs based on applicable Medicare regulations. Medicare and Medicaid cost is determined using individual cost center cost-to-charge ratios. This cost to charge ratio is determined using all payer cost and all payer charges. The cost to charge ratio is applied to the actual Medicare and Medicaid charges to determine the Medicare and Medicaid cost. This organization has adopted the cost and charge practices as recommended by the Catholic Health Association and the Iowa Hospital Association, and therefore, does not count any Medicare shortfall numbers in its annual reporting of Community Benefit amounts. Schedule H Part III Section C Line 9b: Iowa organizations follow a policy that outlines all collection practices for patients who are known to qualify for government programs and for our charity care program.

Patients covered by insurance, but required to pay deductibles or copayments, are considered to be uninsured for those portions.

201842219349300974,042790311,"Part I, Line 7:","Line 7a (Charity Care) - community benefit expense was calculated by applying the ratio of patient care cost to charges, calculated on Worksheet 2, against total charity care gross patient charges from the audited financial statements.Line 7b (Unreimbursed Medicaid) - community benefit expense was derived using the organization's cost accounting system, which takes into account all hospital inpatients, outpatients and emergency room patients for whom services were provided and covered under Medicaid and Medicaid managed care plans.Line 7c (Other Means-Tested Programs) - community benefit expense was derived using the organization's cost accounting system, which takes into account all hospital inpatients, outpatients and emergency room patients for whom services were provided and covered under other means-tested government programs.Line 7e (Community Health Improvement Services & Benefit Operations) - Community Health Improvement Services calculations are derived from direct and indirect costs associated with community benefit activities that are aligned with the hopital's 2013 community health needs assessment. These activities are carried out to improve community health and wellness and extend beyond patient care, beyond the walls of the hospital.Community Benefit Operations calculations are derived from costs associated with assigned staff and community health needs and/or assets assessment, as well as other costs associated with community benefit strategy and operations. Line 7f (Health Professional Education) - community benefit expense was derived using the organization's cost accounting system.Line 7g (Subsidized Programs) - community benefit expense was derived using the organization's cost accounting system. The expense relates to specific outpatient programs. There are no costs attributable to physician clinics reported as subsidized health services in Part I, line 7g.Line 7h (Research) - community benefit expense was derived using the organization's cost accounting system. In addition to the research costs reported on line 7h, there was $756,611 of expenses related to Industry-sponsored grants that we believe should be treated as community benefit expense because they were incurred to promote the health and well-being of the local population and are a key component of our commitment to the community."
201842219349300974,042790311,"Part I, Ln 7 Col(f):","In fiscal year 2013, the organization adopted the provisions of Accounting Standards Update 2011-07, Health Care Entities (Topic 954), Presentation and disclosure of Patient Service Revenue, Provision for Bad Debts, and the Allowance for Doubtful Accounts for Certain Health Care Entities on October 1, 2012. The update changed how the provision for bad debts is reported on the audited financial statements. In prior years it was included with total operating expenses, and subtracted from total expenses reported in Part IX, Line 25, column (A) for the purpose of calculating the percentages in Part I, Line 7, column (f). Beginning in 2013, the provision for bad debts was reported as a deduction to net patient service revenue. The 2017 provision for bad debts totaled $15,409,450 and is not included in total expenses reported in Part IX, Line 25, column (A) for the purpose of calculating the percentages in Part 1, Line 7, column (f)."
201842219349300974,042790311,"Part II, Community Building Activities:","The following description is not quantified specifically in Part II of Schedule H. The hospital facility is committed to creating healthier communities and understands that many state and federal mandated community benefit programs and services are not sufficent to address ethnic, racial and economic health disparities and inequities. The hospital embraces the traditional definition of ""health"" to include economic opportunity, affordable housing, quality education, safe neighborhoods, food security, social and racial justice, and the arts/culture - all elements that are needed for individuals, families and communities to thrive. The hospital provides many valuable services, resources, programs and financial support - beyond the walls of the hospital and into the communities and homes of the people we serve; including grants and sponsorship of local community-based organizations and the involvement of Baystate leadership with various community boards that align with our mission. The hospital facility provided $59,949 as a Payment in Lieu of Taxes (PILOT) to the City of Springfield for our outpatient facility at 3300 Main Street and $209,778 as a Payment in Lieu of Taxes (PILOT) to the City of Springfield for our facilities at 3400 Main Street & 11 Wilbraham Road. Baystate Medical Center provided $38,503 as a Payment in Lieu of Taxes (PILOT) to the City of Chicopee for our employee parking lot located at Center Street, Chicopee. The hospital facility is a dues paying member of the Economic Development Council of Western Massachusetts (EDC) and the Springfield Regional Chamber of Commerce. The hospital participates in the EDC and local Chamber as we are the largest employer in our region. The Chamber and its membership coordinate activities toward a common purpose of sustainability and economic growth for the region."
201842219349300974,042790311,"Part III, Line 4:","The cost of bad debts reported in Part III, line 2 was calculated by applying a ratio of cost to charges (based on the organization's cost accounting system including all hospital inpatients and outpatients) against total patient bad debt net of recoveries as reported in the audited financial statements. The portion of bad debt that reasonably could be attributable to patients who may qualify for financial assistance under the hospital's charity care program (reported in Part III line 3) was calculated by applying the percentage of bad debts by zip code (for which the average household income for each zip code is less than 150% of the federal poverty level) to the total cost of bad debt reported in Part III line 2. Since this portion of bad debt is attributable to patients residing in an area where the average income is less than 150% of the Federal poverty level, it is highly likely these patients would have qualified for the organization's charity care program had they applied. For this reason, we believe the amount, totalling $631,496, should be treated as community benefit expense in Part I. As noted above, the organization adopted Accounting Standards Update 2011-07 effective October 1, 2012, which changed the way entities report and disclose certain financial information including the provision for bad debts. See footnote #2 (Significant Accounting Policies) on page 13 and 14 of the audited financial statements under the caption ""Allowance for Uncollectible Accounts"" for a description of the organization's reporting of its provision for bad debts.If a patient is determined eligible for financial assistance, the appropriate adjustment is made to the patient account based on their income level. Once the necessary approvals are obtained, it then flows to the general ledger. Patients applying for a prompt payment discount will have this allowance entered after agreed upon payment is received."

There is no shortfall reported on line 7."
201842219349300974,042790311,"Part III, Line 9b:","For patients who are known to qualify for Charity Care or Financial Assistance: The patient may have requested assistance up front at time of service with a Financial Counselor or the Patient could have asked for assistance after receiving their bill by contacting our Patient Billing Services Representatives. The Financial Counselor will assist the patient in applying for the appropriate type of assistance based on their income and circumstances. Once approved for a State Medicaid or other program, all billing and collection activity will stop (except for required co-payments or deductibles).For all other patients, our statements contain information regarding how to apply for financial assistance.

BMC recognizes that the cost of necessary health care services can impose a significant financial burden on patients who are uninsured or underinsured and acts affirmatively to lessen that burden by offering patients in need the opportunity to apply for free or reduced cost services. BMC not only offers free and reduced cost care to the financially needy as required by law, but has also voluntarily established discount and financial assistance programs that provide additional free and reduced cost care to more patients residing within the communities served by BMC.Baystate Medical Center recognizes that the billing and collection process can be bewildering and burdensome for patients and has implemented procedures to make the process understandable for patients; to inform patients about discount and financial assistance options; and to ensure that patients are not subject to aggressive collection activities. Consistent with its patient commitment BMC is required to maintain a financial assistance policy and a billing and collection policy that reflects its financial assistance options and patient billing and collection procedures and complies with applicable state and federal laws and regulations.Baystate Medical Center has Financial Counselors available to help patients apply for financial assistance programs that may cover unpaid hospital bills, including a variety of federal and state programs as well as financial assistance through Baystate Medical Center. BMC Financial Counselors have all been trained and certified by the state as Certified Account Counselors to assist patients in applying for available state and federal programs. BMC is committed to ensuring that patients or prospective patients in the community are aware of financial assistance programs. For uninsured or underinsured patients, BMC will assist in applying for available financial assistance programs. BMC notifies patients of the availability of assistance in both the initial bill sent to patients as well as in general notices posted throughout the hospital.When applicable, BMC also assists patients in applying for coverage of services as a Medical Hardship based on the patient's documented income and allowable medical expenses. BMC provides, upon request, specific information about the eligibility process to be a Low Income Patient under either the Massachusetts Health Safety Net Program or additional assistance for patients who are low income through BMC's own internal financial assistance program. BMC also notifies patients about available payment plans based on their family size and income. Our Financial Assistance Policy and Billing and Collection Policy are posted on the baystatehealth.org website. https://www.baystatehealth.org/patients/billing-and-financial-assistance. The goal of posting the Financial Assistance Policy and the Billing and Collection Policy is to ensure that patients or prospective patients in our community are aware of our financial assistance programs. Baystate Medical Center's Billing and Collection Policy was developed to ensure BMC provides adequate and affordable health care assecible to everyone, regardless of income, social or economic status.Signs about the availability of financial assistance programs at the hospital are translated into Spanish, and Russian because Spanish and Russian are primarily spoken by 1000 or 1% of the residents in the hospital's service area. Signs are large enough to be clearly visible. Hospital signs are 8.5 x 11 inches and the header print font is 24 pts.

201842219349300974,042790311,"Part VI, Line 4:","Baystate Medical Center is a 713-bed academic medical center (including Baystate Children's Hospital) based in Springfield, Massachusetts and is Western New England's only tertiary care referral medical center, Level 1 trauma center, and neonatal and pediatric intensive care units. Baystate Medical Center serves as a regional resource for specialty medical care and research, while providing comprehensive primary medical services to the community.The service area for Baystate Medical Center includes all 23 communities within Hampden County, including the third largest city in Massachusetts -- Springfield (population over 150,000). Three adjacent cities (Holyoke, Chicopee and West Springfield) create a densely-populated urban core that includes over half of the population of the service area (around 270,000 people). Smaller, suburban communities exist to the east and west of this central core area. Many of these communities have populations under 20,000 people. Urban areas, as defined by the U.S. Census Bureau consist of census tracts and/or blocks meeting the minimum population density requirement (2,500-49,999 for urban clusters and over 50,000 for urbanized areas) or are adjacent and meet additional criteria. The service area has more racial and ethnic diversity than many other parts of Western Massachusetts. County-wide, 22% of the population identifies as Hispanic or Latino, 9% Black or African American, and 2% as Asian (ACS, 2010-2014). However, this diversity is not equally spread throughout the region and tends to be concentrated in the urban core. The Pioneer Valley Transit Authority, the second largest public transit system in the state, serves 11 communities in the service area and connects suburban areas to the core cities and services. Paratransit service is also available for people with disabilities within 3/4 mile of a fixed route to facilitate access to medical care. Economically, the Baystate Medical Center service area is home to many of the largest employers in the region as well as numerous colleges and universities, and provides a strong economic engine for the broader region. The largest industries and employers include health care, service and wholesale trade and manufacturing. At the same time, the county struggles with higher rates of unemployment and poverty, lower household incomes and lower rates of educational attainment as compared to the state. The median household income in the service area is about $50,000 ($17,000 less than the state) (ACS 2010-2014). The poverty rate is more than 5% higher than that statewide, and the child poverty rate is an alarming 27%, more than 10% higher than the state rate (ACS, 2010-2014). Despite being at the core of the Knowledge Corridor region, only 26% of the population age 25 and over has a bachelor's degree. Hampden County's unemployment rate of 6.8% is higher than the state average of 4.9%. The unemployment rate is based on the number of people who are either working or actively seeking work. The median age for the service area is similar to that of Massachusetts, though the population over 45 years old is growing as a percentage of the total population."

Kennestone and Windy Hill Hospitals are two of five hospitals that are affiliated with Wellstar Health System.

This process is further described in Community Served by the Health System. 3) Population demographics and socioeconomic characteristics of the community were gathered and reported utilizing various third parties. The health status of the community was then reviewed. Information on the leading causes of death and morbidity information was analyzed in conjunction with health outcomes and factors reported for the community by the Center for Disease Control and Prevention (Community Health Status Indicators). Health factors with significant opportunity for improvement were noted. 4) Community input was provided through nine key stakeholder meetings and a community health survey. Results and findings are described in the Community Input - Key Stakeholder Interviews and Survey section of the CHNA at www.upmcsusquehanna.org/communityhealth. 5) Information gathered in the above steps was analyzed and reviewed to identify health issues of uninsured persons, low-income persons and minority groups and the community as a whole. Health needs were ranked utilizing a weighing method that weighs the size of the problem, the seriousness of the problem, the impact of the issues on vulnerable populations, the prevalence of common themes, how important the issue is to the community, and how the issue aligns with the Hospital's strategic plan. 6) An inventory of health care facilities and other community resources potentially available to address the significant health needs identified through the CHNA was prepared and collaborative efforts were identified.Health needs were then prioritized taking into account the perceived degree of influence the Health System has to impact the need and the health needs impact an overall health for the community.To help see the implementation plan come to fruition an implementation team has been formed which is comprised of various individuals from community organization throughout Lycoming and Tioga counties.

These activities include: active engagement and collaboration with local Health Departments, Chambers of Commerce, and organizations that work to improve the quality of life for the residents of the Mid-Shore (Talbot, Caroline, Dorchester, Queen Annes, and Kent Counties). Because local action is essential to public health progress, UM Shore Regional Health is a key stakeholder in the Mid-Shore Health Improvement Coalition, a partnership of public sector agencies, health care providers and community-based partners. The coalition was formed in December 2011 in response to a Statewide Health Improvement Process (SHIP). In addition to providing the coalition with leadership, a variety of clinical and non-clinical UM SRH associates serve on various coalition workgroups. The work of the coalition began by reviewing and prioritizing objectives identified by the Maryland Department of Health and Mental Hygienes (DHMH) State Health Improvement Process (SHIP). SHIP, launched in September 2011, focuses on improving the health of Maryland residents in six vision areas: Healthy Babies, Healthy Social Environments, Safe Physical Environments, Infectious Disease, Chronic Disease and Health Care Access. Under SHIPs umbrella, the coalition develops and implements strategies that will improve local public health. The coalition decided to focus on three health priorities: (1) adolescent obesity, (2) adolescent tobacco use, and (3) diabetes related emergency department visits. The coalition formulated an action plan that articulates specific goals and strategies for the three health priorities. Through coalition workgroups and committees, representatives from the Mid-Shore collaborate to assess local health needs and services; share data and other resources; explore evidence-based health practices; and acquire support to enhance and initiate health programs that impact targeted populations and communities. The coalition plans to effectively leverage and utilize new and existing resources to measurably improve the health status of the residents of the Mid-Shore. In addition to being an integral part of the Mid-Shore Health Improvement Coalition, UM SRH continues to maintain open communication with the Health Departments of Talbot, Caroline, Dorchester, Queen Annes, and Kent Counties, Mid-Shore Mental Health System, Choptank Community Health System, local government and schools. UM SRHs community outreach programs can be found in County schools, senior centers, community centers and churches throughout the Mid-Shore. UM SRHs director of community outreach participates in committees and advisory councils, promoting continuous dialogue between the medical center and community stakeholders. This provides opportunities for new ideas and programs to be exchanged, allowing UM SRH to maximize community outreach efforts. UM SRH seeks insight from community members attending educational programs through its outreach events. Program participants are asked to complete a brief survey evaluation, providing feedback and comments about the program they attended, as well as providing suggestions for future program topics."

For receivables associated with self-pay patients or balances remaining after third-party coverage has already paid, the Corporation records a significant provision for bad debts in the period of service on the basis of its historical collections, which indicates that many patients ultimately do not pay the portion of their bill for which they are financially responsible. The difference between the discounted rates and the amounts collected after all reasonable collection efforts have been exhausted is charged off against the allowance for Bad Debts."

The legislation established a workgroup on rural health care delivery to oversee a study of healthcare delivery in the Middle Shore region and to develop a plan for meeting the health care needs of the five counties -- Caroline, Dorchester, Kent, Queen Annes and Talbot. The purpose of the study was to assess the health care of the residents of the five-county study area and the capacities of the health system in the region, and propose options for enhancing health and health care delivery on the Mid-Shore. The research team was asked to consider: (1) the limited availability of health care providers and services; (2) the special needs of vulnerable populations, including the frail and elderly, racial and ethnic minorities, immigrants and patients with persistent behavioral illnesses; (3) barriers to access caused by transportation limitations; and (4) the economic impact of closures, partial closures or conversions of health care facilities. The Summary Report provides highlights of findings from all components of the study and integrates them into key recommendations. Methods and findings are detailed for review at: http://mhcc.maryland.gov/mhcc/pages/home/workgroups/documents/rural_health /September%2025th%202017%20Meeting/lgsrpt_%20ExecutiveSummary_rpt_20170928 .pdf The University of Maryland Medical System in partnership with UM Shore Regional Health as members of the Rural Health Care Delivery Workgroup produced a white paper, Commitment to Meeting the Health Care Needs of Our Vulnerable Rural Communities.

All patients presenting as self pay and requesting charity relief from their bill will be screened at all points of entry, for possible coverage through state programs and a probable determination for coverage for either Medical Assistance or Financial Assistance (charity care) from the hospital is immediately given to the patient. The process is resource intensive and time consuming for patients and the hospital; however, if patients qualify for one of these programs, then they will have health benefits that they will carry with them beyond their current hospital bills, and allow them to access preventive care services as well. UM Shore Regional Health works with a business partner who will work with our patients to assist them with the state assistance programs, which is free to our patients. If a patient does not qualify for Medicaid or another program, UM Shore Regional Health offers our financial assistance program. UM Shore Regional Health posts notices of our policy in conspicuous places throughout the hospitals- including the emergency department, has information within our hospital billing brochure, educates all new employees thoroughly on the process during orientation, and does a yearly re-education to all existing staff. All staff have copies of the financial assistance application, both in English and Spanish, to supply to patients who we deem, after screening, to have a need for assistance. UM Shore Regional Health has a dedicated Financial Assistance Liaison to work with our patients to assist them with this process and expedite the decision process. Shore Regional Health notifies patients of availability of financial assistance funds prior to service during our calls to patients, through signage at all of our registration locations, through our patient billing brochure and through our discussions with patients during registration. In addition, the information sheet is mailed to patients with all statements and/or handed to them if needed. -Shore Regional Health prepares its FAP in a culturally sensitive manner, at a reading comprehension level appropriate to the CBSAs population, and in Spanish. -Shore Regional Health posts its FAP and financial assistance contact information in admissions areas, emergency rooms, and other areas of facilities in which eligible patients are likely to present; -Shore Regional Health provides a copy of the FAP and financial assistance contact information to patients or their families as part of the intake process; -Shore Regional Health provides a copy of the FAP and financial assistance contact information to patients with discharge materials. -A copy of Shore Regional Healths FAP along with financial assistance contact information, is provided in patient bills; and/or -Shore Health discusses with patients or their families the availability of various government benefits, such as Medicaid or state programs, and assists patients with qualification for such programs, where applicable. -An abbreviated statement referencing Shore Regional Healths financial assistance policy, including a phone number to call for more information, is run annually in the local newspaper (Star Democrat)"
201811319349303061,520610538,Description of Community Served,"Schedule H, Part VI, line 4 Situated on Maryland's Eastern Shore, Shore Regional Healths three hospitals, University of Maryland Medical Center at Easton (UMC at Easton), University of Maryland Medical Center at Dorchester (UMC at Dorchester), University of Maryland Medical Center at Chestertown (UMC at Chestertown) are not for profit hospitals offering a complete range of inpatient and outpatient services to over 170,000 people throughout the Mid-Shore of Maryland. Shore Regional Healths service area is defined as the Maryland counties of Caroline, Dorchester, Talbot, Queen Annes and Kent. UMC at Easton is situated at the center of the mid-shore area and thus serves a large rural geographical area (all 5 counties of the mid-shore). UMC at Dorchester is located approximately 18 miles from Easton and primarily serves Dorchester County and portions of Caroline County. UMC at Chestertown located in Chestertown, in Kent County merged with Shore Regional Health in July 2013. UMC at Chestertown serves the residents of Kent County, portions of Queen Annes and Caroline Counties and the surrounding areas. The five counties of the Mid-Shore comprise 20% of the landmass of the State of Maryland and 2% of the population. The entire region has over 4,400 employers with nearly 45,000 workers. Only 50 of those employers employ 100 or more workers. Almost 85% of employers in this rural region are manufacturing firms, which require workers with high-level technology skills as well as low-skilled workers. ( 9.62% adults have less than a 9th grade education and another 9.62% have an education at the 9th -12th grade level but do not have a high school diploma). The service industry is growing rapidly as the local population shifts to include more senior adults who retire to this beautiful area of the State. Although the seafood industry continues to be important to the region it is fast becoming an endangered species. The economic condition varies significantly throughout the region, especially for Caroline, Dorchester, and Kent Counties. It should be noted that Talbot County appears to have a significantly higher median income than Caroline and Dorchester, however, a large percentage of the population has incomes in line with those of Caroline and Dorchester. The figures for Talbot are somewhat skewed due to large incomes of a few individual families and high net worth individuals. Shore Regional Healths service area has a higher percentage of population aged 65 and older as compared to Maryland overall. Talbot County has a 27.2% rate for this age group and Kent County has 25.3% of its residents age 65 years or older. These rates are 65% higher than Marylands percentage, and higher than other rural areas in the state by almost a quarter. Today, more than two-thirds of all health care costs are for treating chronic illnesses. Among health care costs for older Americans, 95% are for chronic diseases. The cost of providing health care for one person aged 65 or older is three to five times higher than the cost for someone younger than 65.

JAMA. 1996;276(18):1473-1479 While progress is being made, the Mid-Shore economy still faces a myriad of challenges that include limited access to affordable high speed broadband services, a shortage of affordable housing, an inadequate supply of skilled workers, low per capita income, and more layoffs in the manufacturing sector.(Source: Mid Shore Comprehensive Economic Development Strategy CEDS) County Health Rankings for the Mid-Shore counties also reveal the large disparities between counties for health outcomes in the service area. The Mid-Shore Region has 26,203 minority persons, representing 25.3% of the total population. In terms of healthcare, large disparities exist between Black or African Americans and Whites as reported by the Office of Minority Health and Health Disparities, DHMH. For emergency department (ED) visit rates for diabetes, asthma and hypertension, the Black or African American rates are typically 3- to 5 fold higher than White rates. Adults at a healthy weight is lower (worse) for Black or African Americans in all three counties where Black or African American data could be reported. Heart disease mortality Black or African American rates are variously higher or lower compared to White rates in individual counties. In Caroline, the Black or African American rate is lower than the White rates not because the Black or African American rate is particularly low, but because the White rate is unusually high. For cancer mortality, Black or African American rates exceed White rates in Dorchester, Kent, Queen Annes and Talbot. In Caroline, Black or African American rates are lower, again because of a rather high White rate. The Black or African American rates and White rates are below the State Health Improvement Process (SHIP) goals.

201811319349303061,520610538,Promoting the Health of the Community,"Schedule H, Part VI, line 5 The analysis of local data indicated that diabetes, heart disease, cancer, behavioral health and access to care were all health improvement priorities for the Mid-Shore. After careful review of County health data, the Mid-Shore SHIP Coalition prioritized the potential health improvement areas and decided to focus the Coalitions efforts on three areas: (1) adolescent obesity, (2) adolescent tobacco use, and (3) diabetes related emergency department visits. The Coalition is committed to examining what evidence-based initiatives can improve the countys health in these three areas related to racial, ethnic and other demographic and geographic-related health disparities. Marylands State Health Improvement Process (SHIP) provides a framework for continual progress toward a healthier Maryland. Marylands State Heath Improvement Process (SHIP) began with national, state and local data being reviewed and analyzed by the Maryland Department of Health and Mental Hygiene (DHMH) Office of Population Health as well as by the 5 Departments of Health (Talbot, Caroline, Dorchester, Queen Annes, Kent). It has three main components: accountability, local action and public engagement. SHIP includes 39 measures that provide a framework to improve the health of Maryland residents. Twenty-eight of the measures have been identified as critical racial/ethnic health disparities. Each measure has a data source and a target, and where possible, can be assessed at the county level. UM SRHs priorities are aligned with the Maryland State Health Improvement Process vision areas and those objectives outlined by the local health improvement coalition. UM SRHs Priorities: 1. Chronic Diseases (obesity, hypertension, diabetes, smoking) 2. Behavioral Health 3. Access to Care 4. Cancer 5. Outreach & Education (preventive care, screenings, health literacy) Several additional topic areas were identified by the CHNA Steering Committee including: safe housing, transportation, and substance abuse. The unmet needs not addressed by UM SRH will continue to be addressed by key governmental agencies and existing community- based organizations. While UM SRH will focus the majority of our efforts on the identified priorities outlined in the CHNA Action Plan, we will review the complete set of needs identified in the CHNA for future collaboration and work. These areas, while still important to the health of the community, will be met through other health care organizations with our assistance as available. Initiative 1 Identified Need: Chronic Disease Management How was the need identified: Identified through the CHNA process Hospital Initiative: UMSRH Population Health Management: Enhanced transitions in care: A: Shore Wellness Partner- Community Case Management & B: Follow-up Clinic Both programs address high utilizing patients who are not connected to ongoing primary care -Chronically ill patients with typical, long standing combinations of diabetes, CHF, COPD, and/or kidney disease who are prescribed between 5 and 15 medications -Rural patients with long travel times to care providers and who often do not have access to information technology resources http://dhmh.maryland.gov/ship/SitePages/Home Primary Objective of Initiative: -Identify follow-up needs from community resources -Reduce readmissions during the transitional period related to Chronic Disease Management -Diabetes-related readmission/revisits -Congestive Heart Failure-related readmissions/revisits -Hypertension-related readmissions/revisits -COPD-related readmissions/revisits -Chronic Kidney Disease-related readmissions/revisits -Provide assessment of dietary status and educational needs -Provide assessment of safe medication use/educational needs/financial assistance needs -Provide transitional case management services Total number of people within target population: Patients with sub-acute mental illness, social isolation, and/or limited family support who need assistance in making healthcare decisions that provide the best care in the best venue.

201812269349300991,042767880,"Part II, Community Building Activities:","As part of its efforts to improve the health status of its core communities, MELROSEWAKEFIELD HEALTHCARE, INC. participates in a variety of broad-based community coalitions and initiatives that work towards addressing the specific and general health needs in these cities and towns. A sample of current activities include: the Joint Committee for Children's Healthcare in Everett; the Malden's Promise Coalition; local Councils on Aging; the Healthy Families Community Coalition; local substance abuse prevention coalitions in Malden, Melrose, Medford, Reading, Stoneham, and Wakefield; as well as the regional Massachusetts Opioid Abuse Prevention Collaborate (MOAPC) and Substance Abuse Prevention Collaborative (SAPC), both programs of the Mystic Valley Public Health Coalition. MELROSEWAKEFIELD HEALTHCARE, INC. also partners with the North Suburban Child and Family Resource Network, serving Lynnfield, Melrose, North Reading, Reading, Stoneham, Wakefield, and Winchester; and the Malden, Everett, and Medford Coordinated Family and Community Engagement (CFCE) grant programs funded by the MA department of Early Education and Care; the Tri-City Hunger Network and a host of other community-based and guided coalitions and initiatives. A specific example of this community building includes MELROSEWAKEFIELD HEALTHCARE, INC.'s representation on the Melrose Alliance Against Violence (MAAV). MAAV is a non-profit, community-based organization that focuses on outreach, education and community collaboration in order to raise awareness of the problems of domestic and sexual assault violence in Melrose. Working closely with the Melrose Police Department, the Board of Directors of MAAV includes a representative from MELROSEWAKEFIELD HEALTHCARE, INC., as well as members from the Melrose schools, clergy, Health Department, as well as students and community members at large.In addition, MELROSEWAKEFIELD HEALTHCARE, INC. has continued to convene a number of Community Outreach Teams to assist with the collection of community health need information to optimize the benefits of community health education and screenings. The Teams have sponsored events ranging from informal (planning, health events and screenings) to more formal (Healthy Melrose, Stoneham Summer Safety Day, and the Mobile Food Market in Malden), offering multiple opportunities to interact with a wide range of community members to form trusting relationships, listening to the voices of individual community members, and fostering the Development of resilience within each community. As MELROSEWAKEFIELD HEALTHCARE, INC. begins the first year of its new Implementation Plan for 2017-2019, it continues to utilize the collective knowledge of the Team Captains. The Team Organizing Charter guides the membership toward salient activities. Relevant health data and the identified target population lists are provided to each Team Captain to assist them in planning programs in their communities. Currently, there are six (6) community outreach teams named for Malden/Everett, Medford, Melrose, Wakefield, Reading/North Reading and Stoneham. Saugus did not have a team in 2017. The Teams continuously solicit input from community leaders including superintendents of schools, state representatives, business leaders, fire and police officials and local health departments. Many employees serving on Teams also participate in other community groups and civic organizations. More than 40 employees, volunteers, and physicians were involved in Team-sponsored events in Fiscal Year 2017/Tax Year 2016 (FY 2017/TY 2016).The Community Team efforts have been acknowledged by four area Chambers of Commerce, other civic organizations, the American Hospital Association, and the Massachusetts Hospital Association."

201812269349300991,042767880,"Part III, Line 4:","The following is from the Hallmark Health Corporation Consolidated Audited Financial Statements, of which MELROSEWAKEFIELD HEALTHCARE, INC. is included, relating to Charity Care and Bad Debt Expense:2017 CHARITY CARE AND COMMUNITY BENEFIT FOOTNOTECharity Care - The Corporation provides care to patients regardless of their ability to pay. Consistent with its tax exempt status and community service responsibilities, the Corporation provides financial assistance in the form of free or discounted care to patients who meet certain criteria under the Corporation's charity care policy. In assessing a patient's inability to pay, the Corporation utilizes federal poverty income guidelines and follows procedures set forth in its credit and collections policy, which has been approved by the Commonwealth of Massachusetts (the ""Commonwealth"") Division of Healthcare Finance and Policy. Because the Corporation does not pursue collection of amounts determined to qualify as charity care, these amounts are not reported as patient service revenue. During the years ending September 30, 2017 and 2016, the Corporation estimated that the cost associated with the charity care provided was approximately $606,000 and $506,000, respectively. Such costs have been estimated based on ratios of expenses to established patient service charges.Health Safety Net (HSN) - The Commonwealth administers the HSN program to act as the payer of last resort for covered health care services provided by acute hospitals and community health centers in the Commonwealth. All hospitals have been assessed a uniform allowance based on estimates of their share of total HSN funding and have been reimbursed for a portion of the cost of actual uncompensated care which they provide, subject to certain limitations. Reimbursable uncompensated care includes net charity care and bad debts resulting from emergency services. Hospitals' recoveries from the HSN are based on regulated payment rates. The Corporation has recorded its activity with the HSN as a component of net patient service revenue in the accompanying consolidated statements of operations. Management believes that the accompanying consolidated balance sheets reflect reasonable estimates of the Corporation's net obligation to the HSN as of September 30, 2017 and 2016. The Corporation's share of the total Commonwealth's assessment was $4,150,230 and $1,669,338 for 2017 and 2016, respectively. During 2017 and 2016, the Corporation received reimbursement from the HSN in the amounts of $2,191,731 and $193,424, respectively. Total uncompensated care provided by the Corporation for the years ended September 30, 2017 and 2016, was as follows:Provision for charity care (at cost)$605,541 (2017) ; $505,725 (2016)Provisions for bad debts (at cost)$4,163,997 (2017) ; $3,690,589 (2016)HSN (assessments net of reimbursement)$1,958,499 (2017) ; $1,475,914 (2016)TOTAL UNCOMPENSATED CARE$6,728,037 (2017) ; $5,672,228 (2016) Total MELROSEWAKEFIELD HEALTHCARE, INC. Uncompensated care for FYE 2017 & 2016 is as follows: Provision for charity care (at cost)$616,091 (2017) ; $531,145 (2016)Provisions for bad debts (at cost)$4,003,662 (2017) ; $3,613,873 (2016)HSN (assessments net of reimbursement)$1,958,499 (2017) ; $1,475,914 (2016)TOTAL UNCOMPENSATED CARE$6,578,252 (2017) ; $5,620,932 (2016) Provision for Uncollectible Accounts - The provision for uncollectible accounts in the accompanying consolidated statement of operations reflects the charges at established rates for services provided to those individuals who do not qualify for charity care under the guidelines described above, but who are otherwise unable or unwilling to pay the Corporation. The provision for uncollectible accounts of approximately $9,570,000 in 2017 and $8,448,000 in 2016 represents charges for services provided that are deemed to be uncollectible. The estimated cost of providing these services was approximately $4,164,000 in 2017 and $3,691,000 in 2016. Such costs have been estimated based on ratios of expenses to established patient service charges.Accounts receivable are reduced by an allowance for uncollectible accounts. In evaluating the collectability of accounts receivable, the Corporation analyzes its past history and identifies trends to estimate the appropriate provision for uncollectible accounts. Management regularly reviews these trends in evaluating the sufficiency of the allowance for uncollectible accounts. The Corporation records a significant provision for uncollectible accounts in the period of service on the basis of its past experience, which indicates that many patients are unable or unwilling to pay the portion of their bills for which they are financially responsible. The difference between the standard rates and the amounts actually collected after all reasonable collection efforts have been exhausted is charged off against the allowance for uncollectible accounts. The Corporation's allowance for uncollectible accounts for all patients increased from 23% of accounts receivable as of September 30, 2016, to 26% of accounts receivable as of September 30, 2017. In addition, the Corporation's write-offs, net of recoveries, increased from approximately $6.7 million in 2016 to approximately $6.9 million in 2017. The changes were a result of management's review of historical trends in uncollectible accounts and determination of reserves, including the impact of the provisions of the Patient Protection and Affordable Care Act.The Corporation updated its financial assistance policy in 2017 to ensure compliance with 501(r). The Corporation does not maintain a material allowance for uncollectible accounts from third-party payors, nor did it have significant bad debt write-offs from third-party payors.Community Benefit - In furthering its charitable purpose, the Corporation provides a wide variety of health care services to the community in order to provide access to appropriate care for populations in need. The Corporation has developed a formal Community Benefit Plan, which responds to a comprehensive assessment of health care needs in the community. The Community Benefit Plan supports services that target not only the general population in the Corporation's service area, but also particular populations with special health care needs, including the poor, the elderly, children, and minority populations. Supported services include various clinics, health screening programs, health education programs, and support groups operated in the Corporation's service area. The Corporation works actively with other area service providers to facilitate the development of an effective community health network. The Corporation also participates in activities designed to foster and enhance the economic and civic environment of its service areas. MELROSEWAKEFIELD HEALTHCARE, INC. does not include Bad Debt as a Community Benefit."

This effort is achieved by:-Re-investing surplus funds back into communities through programs and services.-Making sure that care is available to everyone regardless of the ability to pay.-Using compassion as a cornerstone in improving the health of our communities.-Attending to the needs of patients and their family members by addressing the needs of the whole person not just as a disease or a diagnosis.-Providing a range of special benefits to the community, such as programs to manage care for persons with chronic diseases, health education and disease prevention initiatives, outreach for the elderly, and care for persons who are poor or uninsured.In compliance with IRS guidelines, an 18 month-long process to develop a formal Community Health Needs Assessment (CHNA) was completed by MELROSEWAKEFIELD HEALTHCARE, INC. in August 2016, in collaboration with the Institute for Community Health (ICH), a non-profit organization recognized for community-based participatory research, assessment, and dissemination. This process included a review of reputable public health, socio-economic, and foundation data; input from the Hallmark Health Community Benefits Advisory Council, Community Outreach Teams, Patient/Family Advisory Council, local community coalitions, and the Community Health Network Areas membership. Stakeholder interviews and community forums were also completed. Reflecting IRS requirements, and to foster transparency, the entire CHNA and prior CHNA as well as an Executive Summary of the findings are posted on the MELROSEWAKEFIELD HEALTHCARE, INC. website and in printed versions at each hospital campus and other key service delivery locations in the catchment area. The Community Health Improvement Plan (CHIP) for 2017-2019 is also posted on the MELROSEWAKEFIELD HEALTHCARE, INC.'s website. From the fourth quarter of fiscal 2017 and into the first quarter of fiscal 2018, it became apparent that due to significant financial challenges facing the organization, the community benefits expected to be delivered to the community would need to be reduced. In fiscal 2018, the CHIP will be amended to reflect the changes. The changes will be posted on the MELROSEWAKEFIELD HEALTHCARE, INC.'s website. Ongoing monitoring of the CHNA and its identified health priorities is the responsibility of the Community Benefits Advisory Council (CBAC). As of the end of FY 2017/TY 2016, the Hallmark Health Council included: A Trustee of MELROSEWAKEFIELD HEALTHCARE, INC.; System Vice President of Home Care & Community Programs; Executive Vice President & Chief Legal Officer; Chief Marketing Officer; two MELROSEWAKEFIELD HEALTHCARE, INC. employed physicians; Fiscal Controller; Executive Director of the Cancer Center; Director of Clinical Services ; Director, Community Services; Manager, Case Management; Manager, Central Scheduling, Insurance Coordination, and Interpreter Services; Manager, Community Benefits and Operations; and five community representatives. The CBAC acts as overseers for the CHNA, and defines the process for recognizing current and emerging health needs in the community, as well as developing a multi-year Community Health Improvement Plan (CHIP) to respond to these needs. The CBAC meets six times per year to ensure compliance with the CHIP, review program outcomes, discuss important community health issues, and offer recommendations to the Board of Trustees related to community health needs and disparities. The CBAC approves any and all amendments to the CHIP resulting from emerging health issues or unplanned changes in capacity. It also engages new members from the communities served to join the group, prioritizes candidates who can assist the CBAC and MELROSEWAKEFIELD HEALTHCARE, INC. to better understand community health needs and barriers to access. In FY 2017, three new members were added; two representing the community and one from Hallmark Health VNA and Hospice, who is also a community resident.MELROSEWAKEFIELD HEALTHCARE, INC. also actively participated with the community through its Community Outreach Teams, soliciting input from key community leaders, including superintendents of schools, state representatives, business leaders, fire and police personnel and local health departments. Additional approaches include work as members of community coalitions and with the Community Health Network Areas (CHNA 15 and 16) designated by the MA Department of Public Health. These have proven effective in gaining vital perspective around the health needs of local residents, and in tailoring outreach messages and programming based on what constituencies and communities value most.(Community Teams functions are further explained in the description of Community Activities in Part II.)Another way that MELROSEWAKEFIELD HEALTHCARE, INC. assessed needs within the community is through the Patient/Family Advisory Council (PFAC). This Council was formed to obtain feedback and ideas from community members on how the hospitals can be more receptive to the unique needs of community residents, especially those of diverse backgrounds, and to promote the highest quality of patient-centered services by fostering a strong partnership through outreach activities with community residents. The Council often assists MELROSEWAKEFIELD HEALTHCARE, INC. staff by providing input into the planning of future community activities and initiatives.As part of its efforts to improve health status in the catchment area, MELROSEWAKEFIELD HEALTHCARE, INC. also participated in a variety of broad-based community coalitions and initiatives that work towards addressing the specific and general health needs in these cities and towns. A sample of these memberships include: local Councils on Aging; the Middlesex County District Attorney's Opioid Task Force, the Care Collaborative to support providers treating pregnant and postnatal women with Substance Use Disorders and their infants; The Safe Baby/Safe Kids Task Force through the Middlesex County District Attorney's Office; Medford Health Matters; Tri-City Hunger Network; the Chinese Culture Connection; substance abuse prevention coalitions in Malden, Melrose, Medford, Wakefield, and Stoneham; the Malden's Promise Coalition, MA Department of Public Health in Mass in Motion programs in Melrose-Wakefield, Malden, and Everett; and the Melrose, Stoneham, and Wakefield Alliances Against Violence. One central focus of MELROSEWAKEFIELD HEALTHCARE, INC.'s community benefits groups and local leaders, includes enhancing relationships with faith-based and grassroots organizations. Such relationships provide insight into how these groups view MELROSEWAKEFIELD HEALTHCARE, INC.'s role in their community, how our system can improve the ways we serve diverse residents, and how the system should strengthen collaboration to best meet divergent health needs."
201812269349300991,042767880,"Part VI, Line 3:","Massachusetts Hospitals and MELROSEWAKEFIELD HEALTHCARE, INC. provide patients with information about financial assistance programs through the Commonwealth of Massachusetts or through the Hospital's own financial assistance program as outlined in the Financial Assistance Policy and the Credit and Collection Policy of MELROSEWAKEFIELD HEALTHCARE, INC. and at the MELROSEWAKEFIELD HEALTHCARE, INC. website http://www.melrosewakefield.org. For those patients that request such assistance, MELROSEWAKEFIELD HEALTHCARE, INC.'s certified financial counselors assist patients by screening them for eligibility in available public assistance programs or the MELROSEWAKEFIELD HEALTHCARE, INC.'s financial assistance program (including but not limited to MassHealth, the premium assistance payment program operated by the Health Connector, the Children's Medical Security Program, the Health Safety Net and Medical Hardships) and assisting them in applying for these programs. Assistance for these programs is determined by reviewing, among other items, an individual's household income, assets, family size, expenses and medical needs, current insurance coverage, and any other information that may be necessary. The screening and application process for public assistance programs is done through a single uniform application that is submitted through the MA Health Connector (http://www.mahealthconnector.org/), or through a standard paper application. The screening and application process for MELROSEWAKEFIELD HEALTHCARE, INC. assistance is done through a separate paper application.MELROSEWAKEFIELD HEALTHCARE, INC. has no role in specifically determining the eligibility for enrollment in a public assistance program, but at the patient's request may take a direct role in appealing or seeking information related to the coverage decision.MELROSEWAKEFIELD HEALTHCARE, INC. provides all individuals with a general notice of the availability of public assistance and financial assistance programs during a patient's initial in-person pre-registration at a hospital location for non-emergency services, by phone call or in-person interviews once a patient is admitted to the hospital from the emergency room or discharged from the emergency room, in all billing invoices that are sent to a patient or guarantor, and when the provider is notified or through its own diligence becomes aware of a change in the patient's eligibility status for public or private insurance coverage.In addition, MELROSEWAKEFIELD HEALTHCARE, INC. also posts general notices and business cards of Certified Financial Counselors at service delivery areas where there is a registration or check-in area, including but not limited to, inpatient, outpatient, emergency departments, and in the general business office areas that are customarily used by patients (e.g. admissions and registration areas or patient financial service offices that are actively open to the public). The general notice informs the patient and/or visitor of the availability of the various public assistance payment programs as well as the location(s) within the hospital and phone numbers to call to schedule an appointment with the Certified Financial Counselors. When communicating with patients regarding financial assistance, especially during scheduled interviews, or on the telephone, MELROSEWAKEFIELD HEALTHCARE, INC. attempts to do so in the primary language of the patient or his/her family, if reasonably possible, and in a manner consistent with all applicable federal and state laws and regulations. Additionally, the FAP is distributed in multiple languages at non-traditional locations such as the Mobile Food Market and family networks in our service area. The FAP is available on the MELROSEWAKEFIELD HEALTHCARE, INC. website which also offers a translation feature to accommodate visits."
201812269349300991,042767880,"Part VI, Line 4:","MELROSEWAKEFIELD HEALTHCARE, INC. is a community hospital system, located on two hospital campuses approximately ten (10) miles north of Boston, Massachusetts. MELROSEWAKEFIELD HEALTHCARE, INC.'s overall service area is primarily within Middlesex County, with some slight overlap into Essex and Suffolk Counties.The MELROSEWAKEFIELD HEALTHCARE, INC. Community Benefit catchment area (as defined through the Community Health Needs Assessment process) includes the six core communities of Malden, Medford, Melrose, Reading, Stoneham, and Wakefield, and three additional communities of Everett, North Reading, and Saugus (hereafter referred to as ""MELROSEWAKEFIELD HEALTHCARE, INC. CB""). These communities were selected and approved by leadership based on an assessment of communities from which MELROSEWAKEFIELD HEALTHCARE, INC. draws its patient population, communities where HHS has an existing physical or program presence, as well as long-standing relationships with community stakeholders or organizations. Additional communities are served by the hospital's community-based programs that are proximate to the catchment area. For example, the North Suburban Women, Infants, and Children (WIC) program serves the towns of Burlington, Wilmington, Winchester, and Woburn in addition to eight other catchment area cities and towns, and the North Suburban Child and Family Resource Network serves Lynnfield and Winchester, in addition to five other catchment area communities. In 2017 MELROSEWAKEFIELD HEALTHCARE, INC. has expanded its role with the Malden Public Schools for the Coordinated Family and Community Engagement (CFCE) grant to provide services to the Malden community.For purposes of monitoring Language Needs and the hospital's Interpreter Services program, the MA Department of Public Health defines a 12-community assessment area for review, consisting of the nine catchment area cities and towns, plus the addition of the communities of Revere, Lynnfield, and Winthrop, reflecting their relative utilization of emergency department and inpatient services of their populations.The following statistical and demographic profile of the catchment area is excerpted from the comprehensive MELROSEWAKEFIELD HEALTHCARE, INC. FY 2017 Community Health Needs Assessment:Population Size and DensityThe MELROSEWAKEFIELD HEALTHCARE, INC. community benefits (CB) nine-community catchment or service area covers 71.7 square miles, with a total population of 302,797. Size and population density vary by community, with Malden and Medford having the largest population at 60,309 and 56,981 respectively, and North Reading the smallest, at 15,249. Malden is the most densely populated community at 11,788 people per square mile, and North Reading is the least densely populated at 1,103 people per square mile.Race/Ethnicity & Foreign-Born ResidentsCompared to Massachusetts as a whole, the area has a smaller Hispanic population (8 percent, compared to 10 percent in MA); a larger population of Asians (9 percent vs. 6 percent) and slightly larger population of Black/African-Americans (7 percent vs. 6 percent); a larger foreign-born population (23 percent compared to 15 percent); and a population in which fewer people speak English at home (71 percent compared to 78 percent). Malden has a slightly higher proportion of the population identifying as Asian or Black/African-American and a slightly lower population identifying as Hispanic compared to Massachusetts as a whole. However, breaking it down by community, more variation is observed. Wakefield and Stoneham both have very high proportions identifying as White (non-Hispanic): 93% and 92%, respectively, compared to a state wide rate of 75%. Malden has the highest rate of people describing themselves as Asian (24%, compared to a MA rate of 6%), and Everett has the highest rates of people identifying as Hispanic (21%, versus the MA rate of 10%) and Black/African-American (16%, versus a MA rate of 6%).The MELROSEWAKEFIELD HEALTHCARE, INC. CB service area also has a higher population of foreign-born residents compared to the state of Massachusetts as a whole: 23% compared to 15% statewide. Within the service area, the rates vary from a high of 42% in Malden to a low of 7% in Wakefield.LanguageBased on Census data, the most common languages spoken in the catchment area, besides English, include Spanish, Portuguese, Chinese (Mandarin and Cantonese dialects), Arabic, and Vietnamese. In many cases, a majority of the speakers of many of the most common languages also report their spoken English proficiency as ""less than very well,"" including Portuguese (54.33%), French Creole (50.29%), Chinese (68.27%), Vietnamese (56.64%), Cambodian (60.22%) and Arabic (62.20%). Other less prevalent but becoming increasingly more common languages within the catchment area include Haitian Creole, French, Italian, Urdu, Khmer-Cambodian, Russian, Serbo-Croatian, and various African dialects.In FY 2017/TY 2016, Hallmark Health Financial Counselors provided 5,632 interactions with community members and completed 1,273 applications for individuals in the state health programs. MELROSEWAKEFIELD HEALTHCARE, INC. contracts with a service provider for a variety of language interpreters and also with the Massachusetts Commission for the Deaf and Hard of Hearing for American Sign Language Interpreters (ASL). In addition, Language Line telephone Interpreter Services are available for rarely encountered languages or when timely in-person interpreter services cannot be accessed, such as during emergencies. MELROSEWAKEFIELD HEALTHCARE, INC. also has Video Remote Interpreting available in nineteen languages at both hospital campuses, and some offsite locations. There is 24/7 coverage for both Spanish and American Sign Language, with the additional languages available Monday thru Friday from 8am-11pm. The service also allows us to connect with an over the phone interpreting vendor when the language needed is not available in video format.Age & Birth RatesCompared to Massachusetts, Medford, Melrose, Saugus, Stoneham and Wakefield all have larger elderly populations. Everett, North Reading and Reading have larger populations of children, and the age distribution in Malden is comparable to the state.Looking at the MELROSEWAKEFIELD HEALTHCARE, INC. CB catchment area as a whole, the birth rate is higher than in the state for women ages 30 to 44 (74.3 births per 1,000 women vs. 58.4 births per 1,000 women statewide) in Malden, Medford, Melrose, Reading, Stoneham, and Wakefield. Everett, Malden, North Reading, Reading, Saugus, and Stoneham all have higher birth rates than in the state for women ages 20 to 29, and Malden, Medford, Melrose, Reading, Stoneham, and Wakefield have higher birth rates for women ages 30 to 44.Income, Poverty & CrimeThe median household income levels in the MELROSEWAKEFIELD HEALTHCARE, INC. CB catchment area range from $51,056 in Everett to $112,419 in North Reading, compared to a state median income level of $67,846.In the CB service area as a whole, overall poverty rates are comparable to those of Massachusetts. Rates of children under age 18 living in poverty are lower than state-wide rates (10% compared to 15% statewide). However, the rate of older adults (over age 65) in poverty is higher (11% compared to 9% statewide). Further, there is significant variation within the service area. Malden contains the highest rates of poverty, with 21% of children and 18% of older adults living in poverty. Reading and Stoneham contain the lowest rates: only 4% of Stoneham older adults live in poverty and only 2% of Reading children live in poverty. Malden's violent crime rate is higher than the state. Everett has a higher rate of property crime than the state. Reading and North Reading had the lowest rates of violent and property crime of the CB service areas.Educational Attainment & UnemploymentEducational attainment varies by community in the MELROSEWAKEFIELD HEALTHCARE, INC. CB catchment area. Compared to the state, Everett and Malden have higher rates of people with less than a high school degree. These two communities plus Saugus and Stoneham also have higher rates of people with just a high school diploma. On the other end of the scale, Medford, Melrose, North Reading, and Wakefield have high rates of people with a bachelor's degree, and Medford, Melrose, and Reading have high rates of people with a graduate or advanced degree. Although the overall MELROSEWAKEFIELD HEALTHCARE, INC. service area rate of unemployment is unavailable, the highest rate, in Everett, matches the overall Massachusetts rate (5.7%), while the lowest rate, in Reading, is 4.2%.(see continuation later)"
201812269349300991,042767880,"Part VI, Line 5:","MELROSEWAKEFIELD HEALTHCARE, INC. has a 16 member Board of Trustees, comprised of a majority of community members. Only three (3) of 16 Trustees are employed by MELROSEWAKEFIELD HEALTHCARE, INC. or the hospital's parent, Hallmark Health Corporation (i.e. the Chief Executive Officer, the Chief Operating Officer, and an employed physician leader). Medical Staff Membership and Privileges are open and available to all qualified physicians, including a large and diverse Medical Staff of more than 400 members (employed and affiliated). Hallmark Health operates active emergency departments on each of its campuses. They are accessible to anyone needing care regardless of their ability to pay. No part of the income of MELROSEWAKEFIELD HEALTHCARE, INC. inures to the benefit of any private individual nor is any private interest being served. All surplus funds are reinvested into the facilities, equipment or programs of MELROSEWAKEFIELD HEALTHCARE, INC. to improve the quality of patient care, access to care, advance medical practice and to improve the communities health and wellbeing. In FY 2017/TY 2016, Hallmark Health Financial Counselors provided 5,632 interactions with community members and completed 1,273 applications for individuals in the state health programs; such as Mass Health, Commonwealth Care, Children's Medical Security Plan, Healthy Start and the Health Safety Net. This does not include interactions that did not result in an application. Hallmark Health System Financial Navigators also helped patients to enroll in SNAP (formally Food Stamps) and other social service programs. In addition, MELROSEWAKEFIELD HEALTHCARE, INC. staff attended several community outreach events to assist participants and provide enrollment information. Other services provided include advocating for residents, making appointments, procuring other services and providing information about programs such as the Mobile Food Market. Billing and collections practices are posted on the system web site. MELROSEWAKEFIELD HEALTHCARE, INC. also provided meeting space in-kind and subsidized or provided rent and utilities in-kind for key community partners, such as Portal to Hope, which provides domestic violence prevention and support services. Meeting space is offered to community agencies on a regular basis, when mission and goals align with the priorities of the Community Benefits Implementation Plan, such as Alcoholics/Overeaters Anonymous Groups, Red Cross for blood drives, District Attorney Marian Ryan's Eastern Middlesex Opioid Task Force and Melrose Alliance Against Violence and Portal to Hope for community support groups.In addition to providing a range of programs to address primary and secondary health priorities identified in the Community Health Needs Assessment, MELROSEWAKEFIELD HEALTHCARE, INC. has also, as part of its multi-year Implementation Plan, identified and implemented efforts that more proactively address factors that have been demonstrated to adversely impact health status, increase health disparities, and reduce overall health in vulnerable populations. These so called social determinants of health, such as availability of healthy food, employment, and safe housing, reflect the opportunity to have measureable impact on population health status, and are becoming a meaningful part of efforts to address primary and secondary health priorities.Examples of these efforts, and their impact both directly and indirectly on the health priorities identified in the CHNA and by other community stakeholders, include:Integrated Breastfeeding ServicesAs a Baby Friendly Hospital, providing new mothers with an integrated approach to encouraging breastfeeding supports a number of key factors in reducing a number of issues for mother and child alike. Lactation services for post-partum mothers are available both at Melrose-Wakefield Hospital, and at three Baby Cafes in Melrose, Malden, and Everett. All Maternal/Child Health Staff, Childbirth Education staff, and North Suburban WIC nutritionist and family support staff are certified in lactation (CLC or IBCLC depending on other clinical training). Continuing Medical Education programs are provided to physicians and clinicians annually. Breastfeeding has been shown to reduce risk for cancer and other chronic diseases later in life. Hallmark Health was re-designated as a Baby-Friendly birth facility in May 2017. Encouraging Healthy Food ConsumptionSeveral hospital departments and clinical areas, including Diabetes, Rehab Services, Nutrition, and WIC, all support healthy eating-reducing consumption of added sugar, eating ample fruits and vegetables, and providing education programs targeting the dietary needs and challenges of student athletes, cancer patients, and others in the community living with chronic diseases such as hypertension and diabetes.MELROSEWAKEFIELD HEALTHCARE, INC. works with organizations such as the Greater Boston Food Bank and Bread of Life, around addressing food insecurity and access to healthy foods. Nutrition and dietary staff support the creation of healthy menu options, not only for hospital inpatients and in cafeterias, but also through programs such as Mass in Motion offering guidance on healthful eating and nutritional boost. Efforts also extend to directly supporting increased access to healthy foods, including fresh fruits and vegetables provided through a Mobile Food Market serving 300-400 families per month with approximately 30 lbs. each of fresh, healthy foods. Vouchers from WIC to its program participants are also provided for use at local Farmers' Markets during summer months. The North Suburban Child and Family Resource Network (NSFRN) offers Storybook Walks promoting physical activity while connecting with nature and fostering literacy skills. The NSFRN also hosts Fitness, Food and Friends group for families with young children to promote a healthy lifestyle, learn about healthy eating habits and fun physical activities to do as a family. In partnership with the City of Medford and Mass in Motion, the Produce in a SNAP program provided low cost locally grown produce and educational sessions and screening during the time of the food pick-up to elders in Medford. Some of the education and screenings were provided by Hallmark Health providers and clinicians. The topics were developed to focus on the expressed needs of the elders served and the past experience of the program providers.In the early summer of 2017, representatives from MELROSEWAKEFIELD HEALTHCARE, INC. and the Greater Boston Food Bank met with the Mayor of Medford to discuss food insecurity in Medford. During this meeting a collaborative summer project was discussed. The project provided healthy fresh and canned food items to children and families enrolled in the Medford Summer Fun Program. Through this initiative a Medford Food Insecurity Task Force was formed and a Medford Food Plan is being developed. MELROSEWAKEFIELD HEALTHCARE, INC. employees are key leaders on this important initiative.Workplace wellness efforts, in terms of increasing physical activity, as well as promoting weight loss and healthier eating, have been continued during FY 2017/TY 2016 through the work of the Employee Wellness Committee. Correlating greater physical health and wellbeing through reductions in obesity, cardiovascular and other related health problems supports a whole-health approach to reducing chronic disease and the impacts of treatment by presenting opportunities to identify and reduce these health risks for employees. While these employee efforts are not community benefit, the modeling of healthy behavior by health workers is important in a community hospital where the employees are often also local residents.Additionally, in 2017 a MELROSEWAKEFIELD HEALTHCARE, INC. leader was invited to join the newly developed Greater Boston Food Bank (GBFB) Food Insecurity Task Force to address the need to strategize and share best practice ideas in addressing food insecurity in the area. In 2017, six new fruit and vegetable outdoor markets were opened across the GBFB service area using strategies developed at the Hallmark Health Mobile Market which was awarded the 2017 Jackson Health Care Charitable Service Award ""Program of Excellence"", one of 10 nationwide.(see continuation later)"

201812269349300991,042767880,"Part VI, Line 5 - Promotion of Community Health Continued","Supporting Regional Tobacco Prevention and Reduction EffortsThe MELROSEWAKEFIELD HEALTHCARE, INC. works actively with the Mystic Valley Tobacco and Alcohol Prevention Program (MVTAP), around regional solutions to tobacco control and prevention, including standardization of local ordinances related to the sale of tobacco, monitoring of regulation and enforcement of bans to minors, and other predatory practices related to the sale of tobacco products. The advent of e-cigarettes as vehicles for nicotine and other substance delivery has also promoted regional responses to address their use, especially in school age populations, given the unknown risks and potential future causation of health risks when compared to regular tobacco use.As part of the Mystic Valley Public Health Coalition, MVTAP also works with the region's Massachusetts Opioid Abuse Prevention Collaborative (MOPAC), serving six HHS service area communities. MVTAP and MOAPC work in tandem, given documented higher rates of alcohol consumption, and tobacco/tobacco-based products use among individuals with substance use disorders. Along with MELROSEWAKEFIELD HEALTHCARE, INC., these partnerships also work to address the co-morbid behavioral health conditions impacting individuals with substance use disorders, as well as attempting to mitigate and reduce their increased odds for chronic health conditions, including hepatitis, HIV/AIDS, diabetes, cardiovascular disease, as well as multiple adverse social determinant factors. These issues continue to impact individuals, even when they are in active recovery.Reducing Environmental Factors Impacting DiseaseMELROSEWAKEFIELD HEALTHCARE, INC. promotes several efforts focused around reduction of its carbon footprint, greenhouse gas, particulate and other emissions. This includes energy efficiency upgrades in infrastructure and physical plants and the addition of an electric vehicle charging station at the Melrose-Wakefield Hospital campus to encourage use of zero-emission vehicles in the community. Green technology has the secondary benefit of reducing triggers for asthma and other respiratory diseases, as well as risk for certain cancers. Immunization and vaccination, particularly related to the human papilloma virus (HPV), can also be a substantial preventive factor in protecting against future infection and subsequent cervical cancer in women and oral/head/neck cancers in both males and females. The hospital supports immunization for HPV, as well as the full timeline of recommended vaccinations, through its primary care practices, the services provided in its WIC program and with community partners such as the Joint Committee for Children's Health Care in Everett.Remembrance events, including an annual tree lighting honoring those lost to cancer in Stoneham, where MELROSEWAKEFIELD HEALTHCARE, INC.'s cancer center is located, helps form a connection to those lost with the opportunity to encourage screening and education. Highlighting risks among family members and other loved ones of those impacted by cancer, including loss of life, connects these messages to a receptive audience in a way that extends the reach of screening and cancer prevention messages.Raising awareness of the severity of domestic violence, working with local groups, organizations and coalitions to prevent and end domestic violence, sexual assault and stalking crimesIn January 2017, a panel of eight local agencies and coalitions providing Intimate Partner Violence (IPV) Support Services, convened at Melrose Wakefield Hospital to attend a round table event titled ""Domestic Violence and Sexual Assault: How Professionals Can Help"". Those in attendance gained a unique understanding and perspective on the roles of each agency providing IPV services to our local communities. Participants were able to identify best practices for assessing and working with survivors of IPV, and were also able to collaborate and network with one another for resources for prevention, intervention and referrals. In FY 2017, MELROSEWAKEFIELD HEALTHCARE, INC. staff spent nearly 300 hours at meetings and events providing support and working towards prevention, education, awareness, mentoring, and service to reduce the impact of domestic violence by partnering with the following groups and programs: Wakefield Alliance Against Violence (WAAV), a community based volunteer organization, dedicated to creating a lifestyle free from violence in Wakefield by reaching out to the community, raising awareness, providing education resources, and support to families and individuals, with an emphasis on prevention. Two MELROSEWAKEFIELD HEALTHCARE, INC. employees represent MELROSEWAKEFIELD HEALTHCARE, INC. on the WAAV Board of Directors. In March 2017, MELROSEWAKEFIELD HEALTHCARE, INC. helped to sponsor WAAV'S White Ribbon Campaign and Reception. The Director of Medical Staff Development and Services for Hallmark Health System serves as the Vice President of Melrose Alliance Against Violence (MAAV). MAAV's mission is to raise community awareness of domestic and teen dating violence, promote programs that work to reduce violence and encourage healthy relationships through community awareness activities, education and prevention programs in the schools, including bullying prevention, mentoring and peer leadership programs; and information, support, resource and referral services. Additionally, HHS also provides space for MAAV's relationship discussion group at Melrose-Wakefield Hospital. A Community Health Educator for MELROSEWAKEFIELD HEALTHCARE, INC. serves as a member of the Stoneham Alliance Against Violence (SAAV), a diverse group whose members care about Stoneham and its quality of life. Noting an upswing in reported incidences of violence in the Town, the group came together to address this issue.

ASCENSION IS THE SOLE CORPORATE MEMBER AND PARENT ORGANIZATION OF ASCENSION HEALTH, A CATHOLIC NATIONAL HEALTH SYSTEM CONSISTING PRIMARILY OF NONPROFIT CORPORATIONS THAT OWN AND OPERATE LOCAL HEALTHCARE FACILITIES, OR HEALTH MINISTRIES, LOCATED IN 23 OF THE UNITED STATES AND THE DISTRICT OF COLUMBIA. ASCENSION IS SPONSORED BY ASCENSION SPONSOR, A PUBLIC JURIDIC PERSON. THE PARTICIPATING ORGANIZATIONS/ENTITIES OF ASCENSION SPONSOR ARE THE DAUGHTERS OF CHARITY OF ST. VINCENT DE PAUL, ST. LOUISE PROVINCE; THE CONGREGATION OF ST. JOSEPH; THE CONGREGATION OF THE SISTERS OF ST. JOSEPH OF CARONDELET; THE CONGREGATION OF ALEXIAN BROTHERS OF THE IMMACULATE CONCEPTION PROVINCE, INC. - AMERICAN PROVINCE; AND THE SISTERS OF THE SORROWFUL MOTHER OF THE THIRD ORDER OF ST.FRANCIS OF ASSISI - US/CARIBBEAN PROVINCE. The System directs its governance and management activities toward strong, vibrant, Catholic Health Ministries united in service and healing and dedicates its resources to spiritually centered care that sustains and improves the health of the individuals and communities it serves. In accordance with the System's mission of service to those persons living in poverty and to other vulnerable persons, each Health Ministry accepts patients regardless of their ability to pay. The System uses four categories to identify the resources utilized for the care of persons living in poverty and for community benefit programs: Traditional charity care includes the cost of services provided to persons who cannot afford health care because of inadequate resources and/or who are uninsured or underinsured. Unpaid cost of public programs, excluding Medicare, represents the unpaid cost of services provided to persons covered by public programs for persons living in poverty and for other vulnerable persons. Cost of other programs for persons living in poverty and for other vulnerable persons includes unreimbursed costs of programs intentionally designed to serve the persons living in poverty and the other vulnerable persons of the community, including substance abusers, the homeless, victims of child abuse, and persons with acquired immune deficiency syndrome. Community benefit consists of the unreimbursed costs of community benefit programs and services for the general community, not solely for the persons living in poverty, including health promotion and education, health clinics and screenings, and medical research. Discounts are provided to all uninsured patients, including those with the means to pay. Discounts provided to those patients who did not qualify for assistance under charity care guidelines are not included in the cost of providing care to persons living in poverty or in the cost of other community benefit programs. The cost of providing care to persons living in poverty and of other community benefit programs is estimated using internal cost data and is estimated by reducing charges forgone by a factor derived from the ratio of total operating expenses to billed charges for patient care."

Founded by the Sisters of Mercy in 1893, Mercy is Des Moines' longest continually operating hospital and one of the largest employers in the state, with more than 6,600 employees and a medical staff of more than 950 physicians and allied health professionals. As the first Catholic hospital to serve the community, Mercy embraced the mission of the founding religious congregation, which has since joined with other religious congregations to form Catholic Health Initiatives. CHI serves as the parent corporation of its MBOs which are comprised of 101 hospitals, including four academic medical centers, and 29 critical access facilities; community health service organizations; accredited nursing colleges; home health agencies; and other facilities that span the inpatient and outpatient continuum of care. Together, these facilities provided $1.2 billion in charity care and community benefit in the 2017 fiscal year, including services for the poor, free clinics, education and research. Financial assistance and community benefit totaled approximately $2.1 billion with the inclusion of the unpaid costs of Medicare. Mercy is one of the Midwest's largest referral centers, offering a variety of specialty services that are unique to Iowa and the region. In addition, a 24-hour emergency room is open to all individuals regardless of ability to pay. While a participant in Medicare and Medicaid, Mercy also deploys a robust financial assistance program for the uninsured and underserved, meeting the needs of all seeking care. Dedicated to serving our entire community, Mercy is enriched by a board of directors comprised of civic-minded leaders. Working in conjunction with this esteemed team, Mercy's leadership evaluates and dedicates resources to the promotion of a healthy community and an improvement in the lives of those we serve. One example of Mercy's commitment to unmet needs exists in the House of Mercy. Initially developed to provide safe and supportive housing for vulnerable women and their children, the House of Mercy is now one of Iowa's largest providers of transitional housing and clinical services for parenting women with addiction. The House of Mercy is dedicated to assisting pregnant, parenting/non-parenting, and adolescent/adult women in developing personal responsibility and independence through counseling, education, and medical care in collaboration with other caring individuals. It is home to 11 vital human service and health care related programs and, on average, houses nearly 170 women and children in the residential treatment program. During their stay, women gain the skills they need to live independently, deal with addiction, overcome the effects of trauma and effectively parent their children. Mercy Medical Center - Des Moines is included in the Official Catholic Directory as a tax-exempt hospital."

Multiple account balances may be combined to reach this amount. Patients/Guarantors with balances below thirty-five dollars ($35) may contact a financial counselor to make monthly installment payment arrangements. * The patient's Family Income must be at or below 300% of the FPG. * The patient must comply with Patient Cooperation Standards as described [in the FAP]. * The patient must submit a completed Financial Assistance application. For patients and Guarantors who are unable to provide required documentation, a Hospital Facility may grant Presumptive Financial Assistance based on information obtained from other resources. In particular, presumptive eligibility may be determined on the basis of individual life circumstances that may include: * Recipient of state-funded prescription programs; * Homeless or one who received care from a homeless clinic; * Participation in Women, Infants and Children programs (WIC); * Food stamp eligibility; * Subsidized school lunch program eligibility; * Eligibility for other state or local assistance programs (e.g., Medicaid spend-down); * Low income/subsidized housing is provided as a valid address; or * Patient is deceased with no known estate."

201831319349301448,420680448,"Schedule H, Part III, Line 4 Bad debt expense - financial statement footnote","Catholic Health Initiatives - Iowa Corp does not issue separate company audited financial statements. However, the organization is included in the consolidated financial statements of Catholic Health Initiatives. The consolidated footnote reads as follows: The provision for bad debts is based upon management's assessment of historical and expected net collections, taking into consideration historical business and economic conditions, trends in health care coverage, and other collection indicators. Management routinely assesses the adequacy of the allowances for uncollectible accounts based upon historical write-off experience by payor category. The results of these reviews are used to modify, as necessary, the provision for bad debts and to establish appropriate allowances for uncollectible net patient accounts receivable. After satisfaction of amounts due from insurance, CHI follows established guidelines for placing certain patient balances with collection agencies, subject to the terms of certain restrictions on collection efforts as determined by each facility. The provision for bad debts is presented in the consolidated statement of operations as a deduction from patient services revenues (net of contractual allowances and discounts) since CHI accepts and treats all patients without regard to the ability to pay."
201831319349301448,420680448,"Schedule H, Part III, Line 8 Community benefit & methodology for determining medicare costs","Using essentially the same Medicare cost report principles as to the allocation of general services costs and ""apportionment"" methods, the ""CHI Workbook"" calculates a payers' gross allowable costs by service (so as to facilitate a corresponding comparison between gross allowable costs and ultimate payments received). The term ""gross allowable costs"" means costs before any deductibles or co-insurance are subtracted. CHI Iowa Corp's ultimate reimbursement will be reduced by any applicable copayment/ deductible. Where Medicare is the secondary insurer, amounts due from the insured's primary payer were not subtracted from Medicare allowable costs because the amounts are typically immaterial. Although not presented on the Medicare cost report, in order to facilitate a more accurate understanding of the ""true"" cost of services (for ""shortfall"" purposes) the CHI Workbook allows a health care facility not to offset costs that Medicare considers to be non-allowable, but for which the facility can legitimately argue are related to the care of the facility's patients. In addition, although not reportable on the Medicare cost report, the CHI workbook includes the cost of services that are paid via a set fee-schedule rather than being reimbursed based on costs (e.g. outpatient clinical laboratory). Finally, the CHI Workbook allows a facility to include other health care services performed by a separate facility (such as a physician practice) that are maintained on separate books and records (as opposed to the main facility's books and records which has its costs of service included within a cost report). True costs of Medicare computed using this methodology: Total Medicare Revenue: $192,089,459 Total Medicare costs: $205,285,978 Surplus or Shortfall $(13,196,519) CHI Iowa Corp believes that excluding Medicare losses from community benefit makes the overall community benefit report more credible for these reasons: Unlike subsidized areas such as burn units or behavioral-health services, Medicare is not a differentiating feature of tax-exempt health care organizations. In fact, for-profit hospitals focus on attracting patients with Medicare coverage, especially in the case of well-paid services that include cardiac and orthopedics. Significant effort and resources are devoted to ensuring that hospitals are reimbursed appropriately by the Medicare program. The Medicare Payment Advisory Commission (MedPAC), an independent Congressional agency, carefully studies Medicare payment and the access to care that Medicare beneficiaries receive. The commission recommends payment adjustments to Congress accordingly. Though Medicare losses are not included by Catholic hospitals as community benefit, the Catholic Health Association guidelines allow hospitals to count as community benefit some programs that specifically serve the Medicare population. For instance, if hospitals operate programs for patients with Medicare benefits that respond to identified community needs, generate losses for the hospital, and meet other criteria, these programs can be included in the CHA framework in Category C as ""subsidized health services."" Medicare losses are different from Medicaid losses, which are counted in the CHA community benefit framework, because Medicaid reimbursements generally do not receive the level of attention paid to Medicare reimbursement. Medicaid payment is largely driven by what states can afford to pay, and is typically substantially less than what Medicare pays."
201831319349301448,420680448,"Schedule H, Part III, Line 9b Collection practices for patients eligible for financial assistance","The organization's billing and collections policy applies to all individuals presenting for emergency or other medically necessary care. The policy contains provisions for collecting amounts due from those patients who the organization knows to qualify for financial assistance either through the traditional financial assistance application process or through presumptive eligibility processes. Before engaging in extraordinary collection actions (ECAs) to obtain payment for EMCare, Hospital Facilities must make reasonable efforts through its billing and collections processes, pursuant to Treas. Reg. 1.501(r)-6(c), to determine whether an individual is eligible for Financial Assistance. In no event will an ECA be initiated prior to 120 days from the date the Facility provides the first post-discharge billing statement (i.e., during the Notification Period) unless all reasonable efforts have been made. Hospital Facilities will not refer accounts for collection where the patient has initially applied for Financial Assistance, and the Hospital Facility has not yet made reasonable efforts with respect to the account. For patients and Guarantors who are unable to provide required documentation, a Hospital Facility may grant Presumptive Financial Assistance based on information obtained from other resources. Patients who qualify for Medicaid are presumed to qualify for full charity write off. Any charges for days or services written off (excluding Medicaid denials related to timeliness of billing, insufficient medical record documentation, missing invoices, authorization, or eligibility issues) as a result of a Medicaid are booked as charity. Some Medicaid plans offer coverage for a limited or restricted list of services. If a patient is eligible for Medicaid, any charges for days or services not covered by the patient's coverage may be written off to charity without a completed application. This does not include any Share of Cost (SOC) or other patient cost-sharing amounts such as deductibles or copayments, as such costs are determined by the state to be an amount that the patient must pay before the patient is eligible for Medicaid. Health and Human Services (HSS) uses the term ""Spend Down"" instead of Share of Cost. All collection activities conducted by the Facility, a Designated Supplier, or its third-party collection agents will be in conformance with all federal and state laws governing debt collection practices. All third-party agreements governing collection and recovery activities must include a provision requiring compliance with the hospital facilities' financial assistance and billing and collections policy and indemnification for failures as a result of its noncompliance. This includes, but is not limited to, agreements between third parties who subsequently sell or refer debt of the Hospital Facility."

In addition, Hospital registration clerks are trained to provide consultation to those who have no insurance or potentially inadequate insurance concerning their financial options including application for Medicaid and for assistance under the Financial Assistance Policy. Counselors assist Medicare eligible patients in enrollment by providing referrals to the appropriate government agencies. Once it is determined that the patient does not qualify for any third party funding, the patient is verbally notified about the existence of Financial Assistance Application and additional screening takes place by a Hospital employee to determine if the patient is eligible for charity service prior to discharge. Upon registration (and once all EMTALA requirements are met), patients who are identified as uninsured (and not covered by Medicare or Medicaid) are provided with a packet of information that addresses the Financial Assistance Policy, the plain language summary of that policy, and an application for assistance. Hospital registration clerks read the organization's medical assistance policy to those who appear to be incapable of reading, and provide translators for non-English-speaking individuals. Patients that have been discharged prior to charity screening, such as emergency room patients, receive a written notification of possible eligibility for services. If the patient is determined not to be eligible for government assistance, he/she may notify the hospital that they seek charity assistance. The appropriate charity form is sent to the patient/guarantor for completion and then returned to the hospital for evaluation and qualification. Once determination of eligibility is made, the patient is sent a notice informing him/her if they qualify for full, partial, or no charity care services. Hospital Facilities must make reasonable efforts through its billing and collections processes, pursuant to Treas. Reg. 1.501(r)-6(c), to determine whether any individual is eligible for Financial Assistance."

In evaluating the collectibility of accounts receivable, the Health System analyzes its past history and identifies trends for each of its major payer sources of revenue to estimate the appropriate allowance for doubtful accounts and provision for uncollectible accounts. Management regularly reviews data about these major payer sources of revenue in evaluating the sufficiency of the allowance for doubtful accounts. For receivables associated with services provided to patients who have third-party coverage, the Health System analyzes contractually due amounts and provides an allowance for doubtful accounts and a provision for uncollectible accounts, if necessary (for example, for expected uncollectible deductibles and copayments on accounts for which the third-party payer has not yet paid, or for payers who are known to be having financial difficulties that make the realization of amounts due unlikely). For receivables associated with self-pay patients (which includes both patients without insurance and patients with deductible and copayment balances due for which third-party coverage exists for part of the bill), the Health System records a significant provision for uncollectible accounts in the period of service on the basis of its past experience, which indicates that many patients are unable or unwilling to pay the portion of their bill for which they are financially responsible.

These are activities, separate from our ""community health improvement"" activities that advance the health or safety of the neighborhoods we serve.COMMUNITY SUPPORT:(1)Violence Prevention and Intervention. Under the leadership of our department of surgery, our Trauma Unit conducts a number of programs that address the financial, emotional and societal costs of gun violence in Philadelphia. Our Cradle to Grave program works with at-risk youth to break the cycle of gun violence, reaching more than 1,200 this year. Since its inception, Cradle-to-Grave connected with more than 12,000 middle and high school students and youth from alternative schools and the Juvenile Justice Center of Philadelphia. Fighting Chance teaches residents in high violence neighborhoods to administer first aid to victims until first responders arrive. Safe Bet provides gun locks to families to reduce accidental shootings. Turning Point, with a focus on survivors, helps change attitudes toward gun violence and encourages victims to alter their paths.(2)Emergency Preparedness and Research. This program helps make sure that our staff and hospital facilities are prepared to continue to provide safe, quality patient care under the most austere conditions. We ensure that our staff and facilities are prepared for disasters and other emergencies by working within the hospital and in the communities we serve. This Program is a critical link in the federal, state and local disaster response plans. Our Emergency Preparedness Department is involved in three local committees, including the North Philadelphia Emergency Healthcare Support Zone, the Regional Hospital Subcommittee; and the Emergency Support Function-8 Work Group. These committees are focused on creation of drills, policy development, and continuing education.(3)Safe-T Program. In addition to the personal education about newborn care and safety, all families will receive a Safe Sleeper kit complete with a sleep-safe baby box, layette items such as fleece and cotton clothing, sheets and blanket, a baby book, (English and Spanish language), diapers, a thermometer, nasal aspirator, baby wash, smoke detectors (provided by the Philadelphia Fire Department) and educational materials and resource referral. 4,950 people served last year.(4)Philadelphia MOM. Temple University Hospital assists the Philadelphia Department of Health in providing early interventions for healthy newborns. After identification at Temple University Hospital, city social workers make home visitations through the child's 6th birthday to ensure that they have access to healthcare and educational resources. (5)Blood Drives. Temple University Hospital works closely with the American Red Cross to support its mission of providing a safe and reliable blood supply that helps ensure quality outcomes and save lives. This year, Temple helped collect 403 pints of blood from employees and physicians.(6)At Your Service. Temple University Hospital's volunteer intern program connected undergraduate students who engage in pro-active non-clinical rounding on inpatient and outpatient units and interact with patients and families. Volunteer interns gain familiarity with hospital settings while enhancing the experience of patients and visitors. Total volunteer hours logged last year was 14,924 serving 65,614 patients.(7)Temple Center for Population Health. Serves as an interface with federal, state and local agencies and with community based organizations to collaborate on initiatives to improve the health of our low-income, diverse, medically complex population. This program served more than 2,000 community members last year.(8) Southeast Pennsylvania Collaborative Opportunities to Advance Community Health (COACH) initiative. In partnership with the U.S. Department of Health & Human Services, Philadelphia Department of Health and the Healthcare Improvement Foundation, Temple helps address food insecurity. In selected clinical settings, a member of our hospital staff asks patients about their access to sufficient food. If a patient indicates food insecurity, we refer the patient to community resources for SNAP food assistance, food banks and other needs.(9) Employee Community Engagement. Temple University Hospital conducts numerous engagement activities throughout the year, including collections for new coats and clothing, holiday gifts, food, and school supplies to benefit low income families living in our communities. We are particularly proud of the support that we provide to local public schools, including Bethune and Kenderton Elementary Schools and Simon Gratz High School where many families have limited resources to purchase warm weather clothing and school supplies for young children. (10) Temple University Hospital partners with the LKSOM Block by Block program to establish partnerships to increase research participation while improving community health.(11) Caregivers Group provides orientation to welcome new patient and caregivers and provide education and support to patients and families post-transplant.(12) Leadership Summit. This is a forum to introduce undergraduate and graduate students to enhance professional career development in healthcare administration.(13) Addressing Philadelphia's Opioid Epidemic. Temple Health is working closely with the Philadelphia Department of Behavioral Health and Disability Services (DBGIDS) Office of Addiction Services (AOS), the single county authority, to address our city's opioid epidemic. We have been a key partner with the City as it develops strategies addressing the opioid epidemic, with two members serving on the Mayor's Task Force Services Access & Best Treatment Committee. Temple Health and the City are working together to strengthen services on Temple University Hospital's Episcopal Campus, which is situated at the epicenter of the opioid crisis.(14) Support for Early Learning. Provide facility use for charitable purpose of providing early learning for low-income children with autism and disabilities.WORKFORCE DEVELOPMENT:(1)Investment in Community's Healthcare Workforce. The purpose of this program is to build local workforce and improve skills sets needed to deliver quality healthcare. This involves comprehensive training and education to help workers living in our community adapt and improve skills to enable them to participate in a changing healthcare workplace. About half the students are union members and half from the general community, including laid-off workers and Welfare recipients. Career pathways include nursing, behavioral health, allied health, childcare, health IT. Education services include GED classes and testing as well as ESL and safety instruction.(2)Community Health Worker Program: Work in partnership with TU Center for Social Policy, District Council 1199c Training and Upgrade Fund and Philadelphia Workforce Development Corporation to develop job skills for unemployed individuals living in our community while achieving the national goals of improving healthcare quality, improving the health of our communities, and reducing the cost of quality care.Part III, Line 2:Bad debt expense is calculated based on the product of monthly gross charges and a rolling six month average of the ratio of bad debt transfers to gross charges.

PFACs connected with six separate practice locations in our community and the PFAC of the Temple University Hospital Hearth and Vascular Institute. These groups are organized under the Temple University Hospital's Department of Patient Experience.In addition to data sources, we also work closely with local government offices and not-for-profit community-based health and social services organizations and actively participate in local, regional and state level workgroups to address specific needs of vulnerable populations.As the primary safety net hospital serving Philadelphia and its surrounding counties, Temple University Hospital maintains strong relationships with area community Health Centers, including the City of Philadelphia Department of Human Services, including its Health Centers and many Federally Qualified Health Centers (FQHCs). These partnerships enable Temple University Hospital to coordinate care delivery in both the inpatient and outpatient settings.In Woman's Health Temple University Hospital collaborates with three FQHCs, Esperanza Community Health Center, Maria Del los Santos Health Center, and Greater Philadelphia Health Action to provide Obstetrical Care. Through this partnership community physicians are integrated with the Temple faculty and community practices to provide a full range of obstetrical services for their patients. In addition, TUH participates with the City of Philadelphia MOM Program. This early intervention program consists of frequent phone calls and home visits to encourage mothers to have their babies immunized on schedule and to participate in needed developmental and educational services. The program seeks to fill the gap between children's need for services and mothers' ability to assure their children's participation in those services.Temple University Hospital also works closely with our community partners to provide for adult health services. The Public Health Management Corporation operates a clinic adjacent to the TUH Emergency Department. The physicians of Esperanza Community Health Center maintain staff privileges and provide continuity of care for their patients at TUH. The group participates in the Temple University Internal Medicine Residency Programs. Maria Delos Santos Health Center and Greater Philadelphia Health Action provide outpatient services and refer patients to TUH for inpatient care.TUH also maintains a close relationship with City of Philadelphia Health Department, its District Health Centers and the Police and Fire Departments. TUH works closely with the city to provide for aftercare following hospitalization and often expedites needed specialty care and diagnostic evaluations.Representatives of Temple University Hospital serve on several health-and safety related boards and committees of the City of Philadelphia, including the Health Department, the Mayor's Task Force to Combat the Opioid Epidemic, the Philadelphia Task Force on Sports-Based Youth Development and the Fire Commissioner's Medical Advisory Board."

The Portland area is experiencing an increase in diversity, with at least six percent of area residents born outside of the United States. Many of these new Mainers are refugees and asylum-seekers, who bring a unique set of circumstances and health needs to the community. Approximately 11 percent of Cumberland county households fall below the federal poverty level.Mercy is a Catholic hospital founded by the Sisters of Mercy in 1918. Its mission is to carry out the healing work of Christ by providing clinically excellent, compassionate health care for all, with special concern for the poor and disadvantaged. It has fulfilled that mission for nearly 100 years, both in the hospital and in the community. Mercys mission-based programs such as McAuley Residence, a comprehensive program with housing for women battling opioid use disorder and their children and Garys House, a hospitality house are tremendous community resources. The Medical Neighborhood project, a formal health collaborative created by Mercy, proactively seeks uninsured and under-insured persons in Greater Portland to complete a comprehensive search of all coverage options and facilitate access to concrete supports such as housing, food, and employment services. Mercy Hospital served as the convener and facilitates the ongoing work of the Greater Portland Addiction Collaborative, a formal collaborative charged with optimizing the care delivery system and creating safe, sober housing for uninsured persons with opioid use disorder. Mercys financial counselors routinely meet patients at the local shelters or other social service agencies."

The new partnerships with local parish in the poorest neighborhood in Portland allowed Portland Internal Medicine, Surgical Services, and other departments to organize food drives, volunteer at food pantry, and provide a valuable food resource to a food insecure population. Wayside Cafs allowed staff to volunteer at local schools, Salvation Army, and directly with Wayside for food prep and delivery. The Digestive Health presentations by Mercy Gastroenterologist at WEX and UNUM were well received. Each presentation had roughly thirty participants.Mercy Hospital considered all priorities identified in the Shared CHNA, as well as other sources, through an extensive review process. While the full spectrum of needs is important, Mercy Hospital is currently poised to focus only on the highest priorities at this time. A number of priorities not selected, due to a variety of reasons are listed below:Unemployment/economic opportunityOral HealthDental CareFearWhile we support the non-selected priorities, we are not positioned to impact them directly. Our CHNA recognized the significant need for oral health services for the vulnerable, but the task force felt that Mercy Hospital was not positioned to address directly.-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------Disclosure in accordance with Revenue Procedure 2015-21:Part V Facility Information, Section B Facility Policies and PracticesIn accordance with Revenue Procedure 2015-21, Mercy is disclosing the following information with respect to Section 501(r) issues that were discovered during the 2017 tax year and how these have been corrected to satisfy 501(r) requirements.For all items:A good-faith effort was made to implement the requirements of the Section 501(r) regulations. Mercy obtained information about the requirements and sought to implement them accordingly, but later identified some compliance gaps due to the detailed nature of the regulations.The issues were discovered in fiscal year 2017 during an internal audit of Mercys compliance with Sections 501(r)(3-4). The correction of these issues did not result in any changes to our overall processes and, therefore, Mercy has not identified any persons directly affected by these issues. All individuals would have been in the same position had these issues not occurred.To ensure full compliance with Section 501(r) regulations, EMHS Community Health and Revenue Cycle Departments perform routine reviews to assure Mercy is in compliance with Section 501(r). In addition, EMHS continues to engage EMHS Internal Audit to review Mercys compliance with Section 501(r).Specific issues and corrections:1. Information in the FAP regarding Amounts Generally Billed (AGB) a. Requirement: The FAP must include the method the hospital facility uses to determine the amounts generally billed to individuals who have insurance covering emergency or other medically necessary care and must state the AGB percentages or explain how members of the public may readily obtain such percentages.b. Condition: While the Plain Language Summary (PLS) indicated that AGB will be calculated using the look-back method, based on actual past claims paid to the hospital by Medicare and by other private insurers, the FAP did not adequately explain the method used to determine AGB, state the AGB percentages or explain how members of the public may readily obtain the AGB percentages (and these AGB percentages also were not otherwise readily available). c. Corrective Action: The FAP was updated to explain the method used to determine AGB. The FAP was also updated to state To request a free written description of how EMHS calculates the AGB or to find out the actual AGB for a particular EMHS hospital, please contact (207) 973-6473 or (207) 973-4483 or on the Web at http://emhs.org/Billing-help.aspx. Mercys AGB percentage was added to this Web site. d. Date Corrected: These revisions to the FAP were approved by EMHS Leadership in Fiscal Year 2017 and the EMHS Board of Directors at its October 4, 2017 meeting. The updated FAP was widely publicized upon approval by the EMHS Board of Directors. The AGB percentages were added to the EMHS Web site in January 2018.2. Presumptive eligibilitya. Requirement: The FAP must include whether and under what circumstances prior FAP-eligibility determinations are used for presumptive eligibility.b. Condition: The FAP explained that approved applications from one EMHS Member Organization will be honored at another EMHS Member Organization, but did not fully describe the circumstances under which prior FAP-eligibility determinations are used for presumptive eligibility.c. Corrective Action: The FAP has been updated to fully describe whether and under what circumstances prior-FAP eligibility determinations are used for presumptive eligibility. d. Date Corrected: These revisions to the FAP were approved by EMHS Leadership on May 1, 2018 and the revised FAP has been widely publicized. 3. Emergency Medical Care Language in the FAPa. Requirement: A written policy must be established to require that care will be provided, without discrimination, for emergency medical conditions to individuals regardless of whether they are FAP-eligible.b. Condition: It was and is Mercys practice to provide care for emergency conditions to individuals regardless of whether they are FAP-eligible; however, upon review of Mercys FAP it was determined that this practice was not explicitly stated.c. Corrective Action: The FAP was updated to explicitly state that EMHS Hospitals will provide, without discrimination, care for emergency medical conditions to individuals regardless of their eligibility for assistance under the FAP and as required under the EMHS Emergency Medical Care Policy. d. Date Corrected: These revisions to the FAP were approved by EMHS Leadership in Fiscal Year 2017 and the EMHS Board of Directors at its October 4, 2017 meeting. The updated FAP was widely publicized upon approval by the EMHS Board of Directors. 4. Billing and Collection Practicesa. Requirement: The FAP (or separate billing and collection policy) must include information on the actions the hospital will take to collect outstanding balances, including the reasonable efforts made to determine FAP eligibility. This information must be widely publicized along with the FAP.b. Condition: The billing and collection practices were adequately described in the Billing and Collections Policy which was referenced in the widely publicized FAP. However, the Billing and Collections Policy itself was not widely publicized.c. Corrective Action: The required billing and collection practices were added to the FAP. d. Date Corrected: These revisions to the FAP were approved by EMHS Leadership in Fiscal Year 2017 and the EMHS Board of Directors at its October 4, 2017 meeting. The updated FAP was widely publicized upon approval by the EMHS Board of Directors.5. Widely Publicized a. Requirement: In order to ensure the FAP is widely publicized , a hospital must take several actions, one of which is to include a conspicuous written notice on billing statements that notifies and informs recipients about the availability of financial assistance under the hospital facilitys FAP and includes the telephone number of the hospital facility office or department that can provide information about the FAP and FAP application process and the direct Web site address (or URL) where copies of the FAP, FAP application form and plain language summary of the FAP may be obtained.b. Condition: While Mercys billing statements included a conspicuous written notice to notify recipients about the availability of financial assistance, telephone numbers to the department that can provide more information about financial assistance, and the EMHS billing help Web site address, the billing statements did not clearly state the FAP documents could be obtained from the Web site address provided.c. Corrective Action: Billing statements were updated in Fiscal Year 2017 to clarify that certain FAP-related documents may be obtained from the Web site address provided on the statement. In Fiscal Year 2018, Mercy made additional revisions to further clarify the language included on the billing statements.d. Date Corrected: June 15, 2017 with additional revisions made in Fiscal Year 2018.Continued in Schedule O in Addi"

LOW BIRTH WEIGHT AND PREMATURITY ARE INTERTWINED AND CORRELATED. AS CITED IN QUESTION #2, LOW BIRTH WEIGHT IS A KEY HEALTH STATUS INDICATOR THAT IS MEASURED AND TRACKED BY BALTIMORE CITY DEPARTMENT OF HEALTH THAT MUST BE DECREASED IN INCIDENCE.THE HOSPITAL HAS TAKEN A LEADERSHIP ROLE THROUGH ITS ACTIVE PARTICIPATION IN ""B'MORE FOR HEALTHLY BABIES"", A LONG TERM INITIATIVE LED BY THE MAYOR'S OFFICE AND MANAGED BY BALTIMORE CITY HEALTH DEPARTMENT TO REDUCE THE INCIDENTS OF LOW BIRTH WEIGHT. DR ROBERT ATLAS, CHAIRMAN OF MERCY MEDICAL CENTER'S DEPARTMENT OF OBSTETRICS AND GYNECOLOGY, HAS A LEADERSHIP ROLE WITHIN THIS WORKGROUP. THE GOALS OF ""B'MORE FOR HEALTHY BABIES"" ARE REDUCTION IN THE FOLLOWING:1. RATE OF PRE-TERM BIRTHS BY AT LEAST 10%2. RATE OF LOW BIRTH WEIGHT INFANTS BY AT LEAST 10%3.

201821299349302312,470757164,"Schedule H, Part III, Line 4 Bad debt expense - financial statement footnote","Alegent Creighton Health does not issue separate company audited financial statements. However, the organization is included in the consolidated financial statements of Catholic Health Initiatives. The consolidated footnote reads as follows: The provision for bad debts is based upon management's assessment of historical and expected net collections, taking into consideration historical business and economic conditions, trends in health care coverage, and other collection indicators. Management routinely assesses the adequacy of the allowances for uncollectible accounts based upon historical write-off experience by payor category. The results of these reviews are used to modify, as necessary, the provision for bad debts and to establish appropriate allowances for uncollectible net patient accounts receivable. After satisfaction of amounts due from insurance, CHI follows established guidelines for placing certain patient balances with collection agencies, subject to the terms of certain restrictions on collection efforts as determined by each facility. The provision for bad debts is presented in the consolidated statement of operations as a deduction from patient services revenues (net of contractual allowances and discounts) since CHI accepts and treats all patients without regard to the ability to pay."
201821299349302312,470757164,"Schedule H, Part III, Line 8 Community benefit & methodology for determining medicare costs","Using essentially the same Medicare cost report principles as to the allocation of general services costs and ""apportionment"" methods, the ""CHI Workbook"" calculates a payers' gross allowable costs by service (so as to facilitate a corresponding comparison between gross allowable costs and ultimate payments received). The term ""gross allowable costs"" means costs before any deductibles or co-insurance are subtracted. Alegent Creighton Health's ultimate reimbursement will be reduced by any applicable copayment/deductible. Where Medicare is the secondary insurer, amounts due from the insured's primary payer were not subtracted from Medicare allowable costs because the amounts are typically immaterial. Although not presented on the Medicare cost report, in order to facilitate a more accurate understanding of the ""true"" cost of services (for ""shortfall"" purposes) the CHI Workbook allows a health care facility not to offset costs that Medicare considers to be non-allowable, but for which the facility can legitimately argue are related to the care of the facility's patients. In addition, although not reportable on the Medicare cost report, the CHI workbook includes the cost of services that are paid via a set fee-schedule rather than being reimbursed based on costs (e.g. outpatient clinical laboratory). Finally, the CHI Workbook allows a facility to include other health care services performed by a separate facility (such as a physician practice) that are maintained on separate books and records (as opposed to the main facility's books and records which has its costs of service included within a cost report). True costs of Medicare computed using this methodology: Total Medicare Revenue: $83,530,204 Total Medicare costs: $139,071,498 Shortfall: ($55,541,294) Alegent Creighton Health believes that excluding Medicare losses from community benefit makes the overall community benefit report more credible for these reasons: Unlike subsidized areas such as burn units or behavioral-health services, Medicare is not a differentiating feature of tax-exempt health care organizations. In fact, for-profit hospitals focus on attracting patients with Medicare coverage, especially in the case of well-paid services that include cardiac and orthopedics. Significant effort and resources are devoted to ensuring that hospitals are reimbursed appropriately by the Medicare program. The Medicare Payment Advisory Commission (MedPAC), an independent Congressional agency, carefully studies Medicare payment and the access to care that Medicare beneficiaries receive. The commission recommends payment adjustments to Congress accordingly. Though Medicare losses are not included by Catholic hospitals as community benefit, the Catholic Health Association guidelines allow hospitals to count as community benefit some programs that specifically serve the Medicare population. For instance, if hospitals operate programs for patients with Medicare benefits that respond to identified community needs, generate losses for the hospital, and meet other criteria, these programs can be included in the CHA framework in Category C as ''subsidized health services''. Medicare losses are different from Medicaid losses, which are counted in the CHA community benefit framework, because Medicaid reimbursements generally do not receive the level of attention paid to Medicare reimbursement. Medicaid payment is largely driven by what states can afford to pay, and is typically substantially less than what Medicare pays."
201821299349302312,470757164,"Schedule H, Part III, Line 9b Collection practices for patients eligible for financial assistance","The organization's billing and collections policy applies to all individuals presenting for emergency or other medically necessary care. The policy contains provisions for collecting amounts due from those patients who the organization knows to qualify for financial assistance either through the traditional financial assistance application process or through presumptive eligibility processes. Before engaging in extraordinary collection actions (ECAs) to obtain payment for EMCare, Hospital Facilities must make reasonable efforts through its billing and collections processes, pursuant to Treas. Reg. 1.501(r)-6(c), to determine whether an individual is eligible for Financial Assistance. In no event will an ECA be initiated prior to 120 days from the date the Facility provides the first post-discharge billing statement (i.e., during the Notification Period) unless all reasonable efforts have been made. Hospital Facilities will not refer accounts for collection where the patient has initially applied for Financial Assistance, and the Hospital Facility has not yet made reasonable efforts with respect to the account. For patients and Guarantors who are unable to provide required documentation, a Hospital Facility may grant Presumptive Financial Assistance based on information obtained from other resources. Patients who qualify for Medicaid are presumed to qualify for full charity write off. Any charges for days or services written off (excluding Medicaid denials related to timeliness of billing, insufficient medical record documentation, missing invoices, authorization, or eligibility issues) as a result of a Medicaid are booked as charity. Some Medicaid plans offer coverage for a limited or restricted list of services. If a patient is eligible for Medicaid, any charges for days or services not covered by the patient's coverage may be written off to charity without a completed application. This does not include any Share of Cost (SOC) or other patient cost-sharing amounts such as deductibles or copayments, as such costs are determined by the state to be an amount that the patient must pay before the patient is eligible for Medicaid. Health and Human Services (HSS) uses the term ""Spend Down"" instead of Share of Cost. All collection activities conducted by the Facility, a Designated Supplier, or its third-party collection agents will be in conformance with all federal and state laws governing debt collection practices. All third-party agreements governing collection and recovery activities must include a provision requiring compliance with the hospital facilities' financial assistance and billing and collections policy and indemnification for failures as a result of its noncompliance. This includes, but is not limited to, agreements between third parties who subsequently sell or refer debt of the Hospital Facility."

(PRC) is a third-party agent contracted by local health systems and local health departments ( see list below) to conduct the Community Health Needs Assessment for a four-county area, referred to as the Omaha Metro Area that includes Douglas, Sarpy, and Cass Counties, Nebraska, and Pottawattamie County, Iowa. PRC is a nationally recognized healthcare consulting firm with extensive experience conducting CHNAs across the United States since 1994. Along with several other community stakeholders, CHI Health was an active key health partner working with PRC to design, implement, and review the data. The Omaha Metro Area CHNA, conducted by PRC, utilized both primary and secondary data collected through the PRC Community Health Survey (primary); Online Key Informant Survey (primary); and public health, vital statistics, and other data collection (secondary). Please reference the complete CHNA attached for more in-depth details regarding the CHNA process. The process of identifying the community health needs across Pierce County was accomplished by utilizing the Mobilizing for Action through Planning and Partnerships (MAPP) strategy led by the North Central District Health Department (NCDHD). * North Central District Health Department (NCDHD) is a state-approved district health department that serves nine rural Nebraska counties-Antelope, Boyd, Brown, Cherry, Holt, Keya Paha, Knox, Pierce, and Rock. NCDHD has been state-approved as a multi-county public health department, a government body at the county level, since December 2001, providing education and services to the nine-county area. NCDHD completed a Community Health Needs Assessment for all nine counties within their district. * Ionia Research- Joseph Nitzke, PhD- North Central District Health Department and the partnering district hospitals contracted with Dr. Joseph Nitzke for data collection, compilation, analysis, and presentation for this community health assessment process. Facilitated by public health leaders, MAPP is a community-driven strategic planning approach used to improve community health through applying strategic thinking to prioritize public health issues and identify the resources to address them. This approach utilized both primary and secondary data collected throughout the process. Primary data included four MAPP assessments and secondary data consisted of public health, vital statistics, and other data collection. The assessment also incorporates a broad range of both qualitative and quantitative data. The quantitative data is primary (as derived from the North Central District Health Department Community Health Survey) and secondary (as derived from statistics from large datasets, as well as hospital-specific data); these resources allow for trend analysis and comparisons to both state and national levels. Qualitative data input is also derived from the North Central District Health Department Community Health Survey and focus group meetings.

A request for assistance may be made by the patient or a family member, close friend, or associate of the patient, subject to applicable privacy laws. In addition, Hospital registration clerks are trained to provide consultation to those who have no insurance or potentially inadequate insurance concerning their financial options including application for Medicaid and for assistance under the Financial Assistance Policy. Counselors assist Medicare eligible patients in enrollment by providing referrals to the appropriate government agencies. Once it is determined that the patient does not qualify for any third party funding, the patient is verbally notified about the existence of Financial Assistance Application and additional screening takes place by a Hospital employee to determine if the patient is eligible for charity service prior to discharge. Upon registration (and once all EMTALA requirements are met), patients who are identified as uninsured (and not covered by Medicare or Medicaid) are provided with a packet of information that addresses the Financial Assistance Policy, the plain language summary of that policy, and an application for assistance. Hospital registration clerks read the organization's medical assistance policy to those who appear to be incapable of reading, and provide translators for non-English-speaking individuals. Patients that have been discharged prior to charity screening, such as emergency room patients, receive a written notification of possible eligibility for services. If the patient is determined not to be eligible for government assistance, he/she may notify the hospital that they seek charity assistance. The appropriate charity form is sent to the patient/guarantor for completion and then returned to the hospital for evaluation and qualification. Once determination of eligibility is made, the patient is sent a notice informing him/her if they qualify for full, partial, or no charity care services. Hospital Facilities must make reasonable efforts through its billing and collections processes, pursuant to Treas. Reg. 1.501(r)-6(c), to determine whether any individual is eligible for Financial Assistance."

This was the second CHNA completed with the first one done and reported in Fiscal Year 2012. The Association for Community Health Improvements (ACHI) 6-step Community Health Assessment Process was utilized as an organizing methodology. The UMMC/Midtown Community Health Improvement Team (CHI Team) served as the lead team to conduct the CHNA with input from other University of Maryland Medical System Baltimore City-based hospitals, community leaders, the academic community, the public, health experts, and the Baltimore City Health Department. In addition to using the ACHI 6-step process to lead the assessment process, the UMMC/Midtown CHI Team used an additional 5-component assessment and engagement strategy to lead the data collection methodology. UMMC Midtown Campus, part of the University of Maryland Medical System (UMMS), is a non-profit, 190-bed urban community teaching hospital located in midtown Baltimore with a network of services providing care to approximately 100,000 patients each year. University of Maryland Midtown Campus admissions are primarily from within the Baltimore City and the greater metropolitan region. However, for purposes of community benefits programming and this report, the Community Benefit Service Area (CBSA) of UMMC is within Baltimore City. The zip codes within Baltimore City prominently represent the top 66% of all Baltimore City admissions in FY14. These targeted zip codes are: 21201, 21215, 21216, 21217, 21218, 21223, and 21229 The populations in these zip codes are some of the most vulnerable, underserved residents in Baltimore City. There are significant health disparities in these zip codes when compared to other zip codes in Baltimore City and Maryland. Using the above frameworks, data was collected from multiple sources, groups, and individuals and integrated into a comprehensive document which was utilized at a retreat on March 11, 2015 of the UMMC/Midtown Community Health Improvement (CHI) Team. During that strategic planning retreat, priorities were identified using the collected data and an adapted version of the Catholic Health Associations (CHA) priority setting criteria. The identified priorities were also validated by a panel of UM Clinical Advisors and UMB Campus experts. UMMC Midtown Campus collaborated with the University of Maryland Medical Center and used primary and secondary sources of data as well as quantitative and qualitative data and consulted with numerous individuals and organizations during the CHNA, including other University of Maryland Medical System (UMMS) Baltimore City-based hospitals (University of Maryland Medical Center, University of Maryland Rehabilitation and Orthopedic Institute, and Mt Washington Pediatric Hospitals), community leaders, community partners, the University of Maryland Baltimore (UMB) academic community, the general public, local health experts, and the Baltimore City Health Department. A) Community Perspective The communitys perspective was obtained through one survey offered to the public using several methods throughout Baltimore City. A 6-item survey queried Baltimore City residents to identify their top health concerns and their top barriers in accessing health care.

201821319349303202,520591667,Description of Community Served,"Schedule H, Part Vi, line 4 For purposes of community benefits programming to the State, the community benefit service area for the University of Maryland Medical Center Midtown Campus is defined within Baltimore City. There are seven zip codes which specifically defines the target population: 21201, 21215, 21216, 21217, 21218, 21223, and 21229. Zip codes in this community are part of the federally designated West Baltimore Medicaid Health Professional Shortage Area (HPSA). This designation indicates that there is less than one primary care provider practicing in the area for every 3,000 Medicaid eligible community members. The populations in these zip codes are some of the most vulnerable, underserved residents in Baltimore City with significant health disparities when compared to other zip codes in Baltimore City and Maryland. Residents within the targeted zip codes face significant health disparities. Life expectancy in the target population is 62.9 years vs 71.8 years for Baltimore City overall and 82 years for Roland Park, an upscale Baltimore City neighborhood. Life expectancy is affected by chronic disease prevalence and uncontrolled risk factors, like hypertension. According to Marylands Statewide Health Improvement Plan (SHIP), ER visits due to hypertension are 658.9/100,000 population in Baltimore City as compared with 252.2/100,000 for Maryland, placing Baltimore City with the highest prevalence in the State. This 20-year disparity in life expectancy and quality of life is also profoundly affected by multiple social determinants of health (SDoH). While there are numerous social determinants which affect this population, the main SDOHs include the prevalence of food deserts, unemployment and poverty, transportation issues, and violence. Physical environment determinants include the prevalence of inadequate/unsafe housing, vacant homes, and high tobacco and alcohol store density. The following table illustrates demographics and some of the significant social determinants of health affecting the target population. For a more detailed analysis of these and other determinants of health in this population, please review UMMC Midtown Campus FY2015 Community Health Needs Assessment at: http://ummidtown.org/~/media/systemhospitals/midtown/pdfs/aboutus/midtown- chna-executive-report-fy2015.pdf?la=en Target Population Description: Target Population Total 260,969 (Male=120,058, Female=140,911) Median Age 34.6 years Race White/Caucasian 45,918 Black/African American 199,656 Amer Indian/Alaska Native 996 Asian 6,063 Native Hawaiian/Other Pacific 101 Other 1,797 Two or More Races 6,438 Ethnicity Hispanic 5,490 Non-Hispanic 255,479 Median Household Income $42,266 Percentage of households w/ incomes below the federal poverty guidelines 22.7% Percentage of uninsured people 14% Percentage of Medicaid recipients 30.9% Percentage of HS graduates 66% Unemployment Rate21.9% - 28.6% No Vehicle Available 15.3% Severe Housing Problems 24% Healthy Food Availability Index 7.8-12.4 (Scale = 0-25) Tobacco Store Density 27.8- 51.4 stores/10,000 people"
201821319349303202,520591667,Promoting the Health of the Community,"Schedule H, Part Vi, line 5 Analysis of all quantitative and qualitative data from the FY15 CHNA identified three top areas of need within Baltimore City. These top priorities represent the intersection of documented unmet community health needs and the organizations key strengths and mission. These priorities were identified and approved by the UMMC/Midtown CHI Team and validated with the health experts from the UMB Campus Panel. All community health improvement programming is focused on these strategic priorities: 1.HIV Prevention 2.Substance Abuse 3.Diabetes Prevention Health Literacy (shared UMMS priority) Identified Need: Diabetes Prevention In Baltimore City, 33.8% of adults are obese. With adults of lower incomes <$15,000/annually), 39% are obese. Of these obese adults, 21% of them have diabetes. Contributing factors to the obesity in the targeted CBSA include significant food deserts, lack of safe outdoor environments to be physically active and high percentage of corner store density. The 2017 Maryland SHIP goal for % of adults who are not overweight or obese is 36.6. The healthy food availability index (HFAI) averages at 10.3 for Baltimore City overall (scale 0-25 with higher scores being better). Within the targeted CBSA, the HFAI ranges as low as 6.4 and 7.8. All of these significant health disparities in Baltimore City speaks to the identified need, and subsequently, the UMMC priority of Diabetes Prevention. http://health.baltimorecity.gov/sites/default/files/HealthyBaltimore2015_F inal_Web.pdf http://ship.md.networkofcare.org/ph/ship-detail.aspx?id=md_ship30 During the CHNA conducted in FY12 and FY15, UMMC identified key community priorities, one of which was Diabetes Prevention. This need was identified both years and was based on the high prevalence of diabetes and obesity in the CBSA targeted zip codes as stated above. Hospital Initiative: Diabetes Prevention Program (DPP) To combat the high prevalence of diabetes in the targeted CBSA area, UMMC Midtown has several initiatives to address the above identified need, one of which is the Diabetes Prevention Program (DPP). Primary Objectives of Initiative: 1) Provide education and information on heart healthy lifestyle through engaging, evidence-based diabetes prevention programs (DPP) in the community 2) Decrease the ED visit rate due to diabetes 3) Increase the proportion of adults who are at a healthy weight Single or Multi-year Plan: Multi-Year UMMC is working on this identified need over the three year cycle that is consistent with the CHNA cycle. Updates per Implementation Plan metric for each Fiscal Year are provided in the HSCRC Report and to the IRS. Key Collaborators in Delivery: -UMMC Dept of Community Health Improvement -American Diabetes Association -American Heart Association -Centers for Disease Control (CDC) Metrics: -# of cohorts annually -# of total participants -# of participants completing program -Pounds lost Evaluation of Outcomes: -2 Cohorts completed program in FY17; 1 additional Cohort started in FY17 but is not yet completed -Cohort #2 10 started/6 completed with 47 pound weight loss -Cohort #3 14 started/9 completed with 93 pound weight loss (4 participants met the program weight loss goal of 7% or more with 1 out of the 4 losing 30 pounds -Cohort #4 only held two classes -Cohort #5 8 started still ongoing through FY18 Continuation of Initiative: UMMC will continue to monitor performance and outcome measures annually. This priority and the accompanying initiatives will continue until the FY18 CHNA is completed. Expense: $6,246 with $0 external funding Identified Need: HIV Prevention & Education In Baltimore City, the HIV prevalence rate is 53.7 per 100,000 population. This is the highest prevalence rate in Maryland. Additionally, its reported that 21% of individuals are undiagnosed with HIV infection. The State 2017 goal is 26.7 per 100,000, so Baltimore City has nearly 3 times the prevalence of the States health goal. All of these significant health disparities in Baltimore City speaks to the identified need, and subsequently, the UMMC priority of HIV Prevention. http://ship.md.networkofcare.org/ph/ship-detail.aspx?id=md_ship20 During the CHNA conducted in FY12 and FY15, UMMC identified key community priorities, one of which was HIV Prevention. This need was identified both years and was based on the high prevalence of HIV infection in the CBSA targeted zip codes as outlined above. The University of Maryland Medical Centers Midtown Campus is addressing HIV prevention in the community through many clinical programs and services (All University of Maryland HIV programs were integrated into 1 comprehensive program housed at Midtown Campus and were fully operational in FY17). Hospital Initiative: HIV Screening, Prevention & Education Primary Objectives of Initiative: 1) Identify new HIV positive individuals in the community 2) Identify partners of HIV positive individuals and refer them in the HIV PREP program 3) Provide education to community on prevention of HIV Single or Multi-year Plan: Multi-Year UMMC is working on this identified need over the three year cycle that is consistent with the CHNA cycle. Updates per Implementation Plan metric for each Fiscal Year are provided in the HSCRC Report and to the IRS.

This priority and the accompanying initiatives will continue until the FY18 CHNA is completed. Expense: $20,000 with $0 external funding Identified Need: Substance Abuse Tobacco Use Prevention & Education Baltimore City Data: In Baltimore City, 23.1% of the adult population smoke. This is the highest prevalence rate in Maryland. Contributing to this high prevalence is the high tobacco store density in the targeted CBSA. For Baltimore overall, there are 21.8 stores/10,000 people. In the targeted CBSA, this density ranges from 28, to 39 and the highest at 51.4 in Southwest Baltimore. All of these significant health disparities in Baltimore City speaks to the identified need, and subsequently, the UMMC Midtown Campus priority of Tobacco Use Prevention. http://ship.md.networkofcare.org/ph/ship-detail.aspx?id=md_ship32 http://ship.md.networkofcare.org/ph/ship-detail.aspx?id=md_ship33 During the CHNA conducted in FY12 and FY15, UMMC identified key community priorities, one of which was Substance Abuse and Tobacco Use Prevention. This need was identified both years and was based on the high prevalence of substance use and smoking in the CBSA targeted zip codes as outlined below. The University of Maryland Medical Centers Midtown Campus as well as the University Campus are addressing substance abuse in the community through many clinical programs and services (Methadone clinics, counseling, and psychiatric support services), so the focus of this substance use need is tobacco use prevention. Hospital Initiative: Tobacco Use Prevention & Education Primary Objectives of Initiative: 1) Increase awareness about the dangers of tobacco use 2) Decrease the use of tobacco products among adults & adolescents (Maryland SHIP) Single or Multi-year Plan: Multi-Year UMMC is working on this identified need over the three year cycle that is consistent with the CHNA cycle.

These lines require use of the Medicare Cost Report as prepared by the required guidelines which disallows numerous costs of hospitals, particularly if they are part of an integrated system such as Sacred Heart Health Services. In these cases the entity must file a home office cost report which ""steps down"" overhead to non-cost report entities disproportionately to actual allowable share and essentially removing the costs from the hospital's cost report entirely. Examples of non-cost report entities operated by Sacred Heart Health Services include clinics, long-term care facilities, and other health care related businesses. There are also costs completely disallowed by cost report rules such as bad debt expense, marketing, CRNA's, and interest expense. In addition to these disallowed costs within the Hospital, Sacred Heart Health Services operates clinics, long-term care facilities, and other health care related businesses which do not file a cost report.Medicare allowable costs of care are based on the Medicare cost report. The Medicare Cost Report is completed based on the rules and regulations set forth by Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services. Sacred Heart Health Services follows the CHA guidelines in reporting community benefits and therefore any Medicare shortfall is excluded from our community benefit report. However, Medicare is the organization's largest payer and patients with Medicare coverage are accepted regardless of whether or not a surplus or deficit is realized from providing the services.

Income is defined as the total annual cash receipts before taxes from all sources.Financially indigent. Uncompensated care shall include unreimbursed services to the financially indigent. Financially indigent shall mean uninsured or underinsured patients accepted for care with no obligation or a discounted obligation to pay for services rendered based on the medical center's eligibility system which may include:(a) income levels and means testing or other criteria for determining a patient's inability to pay; or (b) other criteria for determining a patient's inability to pay that are consistent with the medical center's mission and established policy. The federal poverty level shall serve as an index for the threshold below which patients receiving care at St. Mary's Medical Center are deemed financially indigent. Financially indigent services include noncovered services for patients eligible for the Medicaid program, services providedunder county indigent care contracts, and other state or federal assistance programs for low income groups.Medically indigent. Uncompensated care shall include unreimbursed services to the medically indigent. Medically indigent shall mean patients who are responsible for their living expenses, but whose medical and hospital bills, after payment by third party payers, where applicable, exceed: (a) a specified percentage of the patient's annual gross income (i.e., catastrophic medical expenses) in accordance with the Medical Center's formal eligibility system in such instances where payment would require liquidation of assets critical to living or earning a living; or (b) the criteria for determining a patient's inability to pay.While financial indigence is based strictly on an income level, medical indigence considers both income and the financial obligation for healthcare services to calculate the patient's ability to pay without liquidating assets critical to living or earning a living, such as a home, car, personal belongings, etc. Therefore, patients are considered for medically indigent status on a case by case basis. The patient would be required to provide documentation of income to determine if he/she is to be considered medically indigent. All patients are eligible to be considered for medically indigent status with the exception of patients with income below 200% of the federal poverty level as these patients are considered for some level of uncompensated care under the financially indigent category."

Some of these are as follows:Kids in MotionKids In Motion is a fun and innovative exercise and nutrition program designed to improve the health of Tri-State area children. It began as a new program in early 2013 as a joint initiative with the Huntington YMCA and other community health partners with everyone working together to fight childhood obesity. It is the only program of its kind in West Virginia. At the heart of the program is Kid Fit, a 10-week program to get kids ages 5-14 moving and having fun, while also learning about fitness and nutrition. Weight, body mass index, body fat percentage and blood pressure are tracked throughout the program to measure progress and to customize the program to fit each child. During Kid Fit, children utilize exer-gaming equipment, which combines video games and exercise. Parents are also encouraged to participate and entire families are losing weight and getting healthier because of the program.St. Mary's has committed tremendous financial resources to providing equipment and staff and St. Mary's provided the key leadership role in planning and development of the program. Several local families are already providing testimony about how Kids in Motion has helped them.Total Woman ProgramSt. Mary's Women's Health Program has 5000+ members and thousands more are reached with wellness activities and programs held every month of the year. The Total Woman provides free health information and screenings and a chance for members to ask questions of health providers. The coordinator of the program helps women schedule their appointments to fit busy schedules. A magazine is published twice a year with important health information and sent to all members. Fitness EventsThe Annual St. Mary's Tri-State Triathlon was held in August and includes three separate races - a triathlon, triathlon relay and duathlon. The triathlon consists of a half-mile swim, 15-mile bike ride and 2.9-mile loop run. In the duathlon, the swim course is replaced by a 2.9-mile loop run in the opposite direction of the previous loop. Races use computer-chip timing. The event averages 200+ participants each year but it has a wider reaching impact of promoting fitness in the community with news coverage of stories about first time participants and their ability to complete a triathlon. Many family and friends also gather at the event as spectators and some are inspired to compete in the next year's event. www.healthtristate.org. St. Mary's partnered with the same organization for the Marshall/St. Mary's Marathon with more than 2000 participants in November with a Marathon, half-marathon and 5-K at the Joan C. Edwards Stadium at Marshall University.Girls On The Run of Cabell and Wayne CountiesGirls on the Run of Cabell and Wayne County is a nonprofit organization dedicated to creating a world where every girl knows and activates her limitless potential and is free to boldly pursue her dreams. Girls on the Run inspires girls to recognize their inner strength and celebrate what makes them one of a kind. Trained coaches lead small teams through our research-based curricula which includes dynamic discussions, activities and running games. Over the course of the ten-week program, girls in 3rd-8th grade develop essential skills to help them navigate their worlds and establish a lifetime appreciation for health and fitness. St. Mary's support of $11,500 covers the program expenses as well as a part-time coordinator for the area.American Heart Association Heart Walk and Go Red for Women Luncheon St. Mary's has been the main sponsor for the Heart Walk each year in April. As one of St. Mary's major service lines, the Regional Heart Institute promotes healthy heart activities for the public throughout the year, but the Heart Walk and the Go Red Luncheon for Women are two of our main events. The Heart Walk generates team building by raising funds for the American Heart Association, ending with the actual walk at Ritter Park. St. Mary's employee teams are joined by teams all across Cabell and Wayne Counties both raising funds for heart research and supporting walking as a family heart-healthy activity. 800+ people participant each year for the walk. The cause receives wider exposure through advertising heart healthy education tips and information. www.heart.orgColors for a Cure 5-KSt. Mary's is the major sponsor for this 5/K run/walk in September that raises close to $60,000 per year. A majority of the proceeds pay for mammograms for uninsured and underinsured women in the Tri-State as well as other cancer treatment programs at St. Mary's Regional Cancer Center. Community Health ScreeningsAdditionally St. Mary's participates in numerous health fairs throughout the year. They provide screenings for health issues such as cholesterol, blood sugar, HDL, osteoporosis, etc. at no charge.

201842269349302279,042103612,COMMUNITY HEALTH NEEDS ASSESSMENT -- APPROACH AND METHODS,"NEBH IS COMMITTED TO COLLABORATING WITH COMMUNITY PARTNERS AND RESIDENTS FROM ACROSS BOSTON TO IDENTIFY AREAS OF SPECIAL NEED AND IMPROVE THE OVERALL HEALTH OF THE REGION. NEBH WORKS WITH ALL SEGMENTS OF THE POPULATION BUT IN RECOGNITION OF ITS STRONG TIES TO ITS SURROUNDING COMMUNITY AND ITS SPECIFIC CLINICAL EXPERTISE, NEBH FOCUSES ITS COMMUNITY BENEFIT EFFORTS ON IMPROVING THE HEALTH AND WELL-BEING OF THE LOW INCOME, UNDERSERVED POPULATIONS LIVING IN MISSION HILL AND ROXBURY AND ON MUSCULOSKELETAL HEALTH. NEBH CURRENTLY OPERATES NUMEROUS EDUCATIONAL, OUTREACH, AND COMMUNITY-STRENGTHENING INITIATIVES, COLLABORATES WITH MANY OF THE COMMUNITY'S LEADING SERVICE ORGANIZATIONS. DURING THE PERIOD COVERED BY THIS FILING, THE HOSPITAL COST TO SUPPORT ITS COMMUNITY BENEFIT COMMITMENTS AND THE MASSACHUSETTS UNCOMPENSATED CARE POOL EXCEEDED $4.5 MILLION. NEBH IS ALWAYS EAGER TO EXPLORE WAYS THAT IT CAN FURTHER ENGAGE AND ENRICH ITS CONNECTIONS TO THE COMMUNITY.THE 2016 COMMUNITY HEALTH NEEDS ASSESSMENT AND ASSOCIATED COMMUNITY HEALTH IMPROVEMENT PLAN WERE THE CULMINATION OF SEVERAL MONTHS OF WORK. THIS PROJECT WAS BORNE LARGELY OUT OF NEBH'S DESIRE TO BETTER UNDERSTAND AND ADDRESS THE HEALTH-RELATED NEEDS OF THOSE LIVING IN ITS SURROUNDING COMMUNITY. THE PROCESS IS ALSO DESIGNED TO MEET THE REQUIREMENTS OF THE MASSACHUSETTS ATTORNEY GENERAL'S OFFICE AND FEDERAL INTERNAL REVENUE SERVICE (IRS) REQUIREMENTS UNDER INTERNAL REVENUE CODE SECTION 501(R), WHICH MANDATE THAT ALL NONPROFIT HOSPITALS CONDUCT A PERIODIC COMMUNITY HEALTH NEEDS ASSESSMENT (CHNA) AND STRATEGIC PLANNING PROCESS. THE COMMONWEALTH REQUIRES NONPROFIT HOSPITALS AND MANAGED CARE ORGANIZATIONS TO UPDATE THEIR CHNAS EVERY YEAR AND THE IRS REQUIRES THAT A CHNA BE CONDUCTED EVERY THREE YEARS. MORE SPECIFICALLY, THE COMMONWEALTH AND IRS REGULATIONS REQUIRE THAT NEBH ASSESS COMMUNITY HEALTH NEED, ENGAGE THE COMMUNITY, IDENTIFY PRIORITY HEALTH ISSUES, AND CREATE A COMMUNITY HEALTH STRATEGY THAT DESCRIBES HOW THE HOSPITAL, IN COLLABORATION WITH THE COMMUNITY AND LOCAL HEALTH DEPARTMENT, WILL ADDRESS THE NEEDS AND THE PRIORITIES IDENTIFIED BY THE ASSESSMENT.IN LIGHT OF THESE REQUIREMENTS, NEBH HIRED JOHN SNOW, INC. (JSI), A NATIONALLY RECOGNIZED PUBLIC HEALTH CONSULTING FIRM, TO CONDUCT A COMPREHENSIVE COMMUNITY HEALTH NEEDS ASSESSMENT FOCUSING ON MISSION HILL AND ROXBURY, ITS PRIMARY SERVICE AREA WITH RESPECT TO ITS COMMUNITY BENEFIT INITIATIVES. THE OVERALL GOAL OF THE ASSESSMENT WAS TO COMPILE INFORMATION FROM A RANGE OF QUANTITATIVE AND QUALITATIVE SOURCES TO CLARIFY THE HEALTH CARE NEEDS AND PRIORITIES OF COMMUNITY RESIDENTS AND ASSESS THE OVERALL STRENGTHS AND WEAKNESSES OF THE AREA'S HEALTH AND SOCIAL SERVICE SYSTEMS. THE CHNA PROCESS WAS CONDUCTED IN THREE PHASES:- PHASE I: THE JSI PROJECT TEAM CONDUCTED A PRELIMINARY NEEDS ASSESSMENT THAT RELIED HEAVILY ON QUANTITATIVE HEALTH-RELATED DATA DRAWN FROM THE MASSACHUSETTS COMMUNITY HEALTH INFORMATION PROFILE (MASSCHIP) SYSTEM AS WELL AS OTHER NATIONAL, STATE, AND LOCAL SOURCES. THESE DATA ALLOWED THE JSI PROJECT TEAM TO UNDERSTAND THE UNDERLYING CHARACTERISTICS OF AREA RESIDENTS AND IDENTIFY THE SPECIFIC SEGMENTS OF THE COMMUNITY MOST AT-RISK. - PHASE II: JSI CONDUCTED A SERIES OF INTERVIEWS WITH KEY STAKEHOLDERS AND TWO FOCUS GROUPS WITH COMMUNITY MEMBERS. THE FOCUS GROUPS HELPED THE JSI PROJECT TEAM TO ENGAGE THE COMMUNITY AND BETTER UNDERSTAND THEIR HEALTH STATUS, HEALTH-SEEKING BEHAVIORS, SERVICE GAPS, HEALTH-RELATED CHALLENGES, AND PRIORITIES. - PHASE III: CHRISTINE DWYER, DIRECTOR OF PUBLIC AFFAIRS AND COMMUNITY RELATIONS, WORKED WITH JSI TO INTEGRATE THE CHNA'S FINDINGS, INCLUDING FEEDBACK FROM NEBH STAFF AND THE COMMUNITY, AND DEVELOPED NEBH'S COMMUNITY HEALTH IMPROVEMENT PLAN. IN PHASE III, JSI ALSO DEVELOPED A FINAL CHNA REPORT, OBTAINED APPROVAL FOR ITS COMMUNITY HEALTH IMPROVEMENT PLAN FROM NEBH'S BOARD OF TRUSTEES, AND DISSEMINATED THE RESULTS OF THE PROJECT TO INTERNAL AND EXTERNAL STAKEHOLDERS.THE CHNA UTILIZED A PARTICIPATORY, COLLABORATIVE APPROACH TO LOOK AT HEALTH IN ITS BROADEST CONTEXT. AS NOTED ABOVE, THE ASSESSMENT PROCESS INCLUDED SYNTHESIZING EXISTING DATA ON SOCIAL, ECONOMIC, AND HEALTH INDICATORS IN THE REGION AS WELL AS INFORMATION FROM COMMUNITY DIALOGUES CONDUCTED WITH COMMUNITY RESIDENTS, AND INTERVIEWS WITH COMMUNITY STAKEHOLDERS.

201842269349302279,042103612,LEADING HEALTH-RELATED FINDINGS,"- SOCIAL DETERMINANTS OF HEALTH (E.G., ECONOMIC STABILITY, EDUCATION, AND COMMUNITY/SOCIAL CONTEXT) CONTINUE TO HAVE A TREMENDOUS IMPACT ON MANY SEGMENTS OF THE POPULATION. THE DOMINANT THEME FROM THE ASSESSMENT'S KEY INFORMANT INTERVIEWS AND COMMUNITY FORUMS WAS THE CONTINUED IMPACT THAT THE UNDERLYING SOCIAL DETERMINANTS OF HEALTH ARE HAVING ON THE CBSA'S LOW INCOME, UNDERSERVED, DIVERSE POPULATION COHORTS. MORE SPECIFICALLY, DETERMINANTS SUCH AS POVERTY, EMPLOYMENT OPPORTUNITIES, VIOLENCE, TRANSPORTATION, RACIAL SEGREGATION, LITERACY, PROVIDER LINGUISTIC/CULTURAL COMPETENCY, SOCIAL SUPPORT, AND COMMUNITY COHESION LIMIT MANY PEOPLE'S ABILITY TO CARE FOR THEIR OWN AND/OR THEIR FAMILIES' HEALTH.- LOW INCOME. 35% OF ROXBURY RESIDENTS AND 41% OF MISSION HILL RESIDENTS LIVED BELOW THE FEDERAL POVERTY LINE COMPARED TO 22% FOR BOSTON AND 12% FOR THE COMMONWEALTH OVERALL. 58% OF ROXBURY'S POPULATION AND 62% OF MISSION HILL'S POPULATION LIVE IN HOUSEHOLDS EARNING LESS THAN 200% OF THE FEDERAL POVERTY LEVEL COMPARED TO 38% FOR BOSTON AND 25% FOR THE COMMONWEALTH OVERALL.- ECONOMIC CHALLENGES. 79% OF ROXBURY'S HOUSING UNITS AND 91% OF MISSION HILL'S HOUSING UNITS WERE RENTER-OCCUPIED COMPARED TO 66% FOR BOSTON AND 38% FOR THE COMMONWEALTH. 46% OF ROXBURY RESIDENTS AND 50% OF MISSION HILL RESIDENTS LIVING IN RENTAL UNITS WERE CONSIDERED TO BE ""HOUSE POOR"" AS 35% OR MORE OF THEIR INCOME WAS SPENT ON HOUSING COMPARED TO 41% FOR BOSTON AND THE COMMONWEALTH.- EDUCATIONAL ATTAINMENT. 77% OF ROXBURY'S POPULATION AND 85% OF MISSION HILL'S POPULATION HAD A HIGH SCHOOL DEGREE OR HIGHER COMPARED TO 85% FOR BOSTON AND 90% FOR THE COMMONWEALTH. ONLY 23% OF ROXBURY'S POPULATION AND 36% OF MISSION HILL'S POPULATION HAD A BACHELOR'S DEGREE OR HIGHER COMPARED TO 45% FOR BOSTON AND 40% FOR THE COMMONWEALTH.- VIOLENCE. KEY INFORMANTS AND COMMUNITY FORUM ATTENDEES NAMED VIOLENCE AS A LEADING HEALTH AND SAFETY CONCERN. NEIGHBORHOOD VIOLENCE CAN SEVERELY LIMIT AN INDIVIDUAL'S ABILITY AND MOTIVATION TO EXERCISE AND PARTICIPATE IN OUTDOOR EVENTS AND ACTIVITIES. FURTHERMORE, STUDIES HAVE SHOWN THAT NEIGHBORHOODS IN WHICH RESIDENTS SHARE FEELINGS OF MUTUAL TRUST AND CONNECTEDNESS ARE MORE LIKELY TO WORK TOGETHER TO ACHIEVE COMMON GOALS, LIKE CLEANER AND SAFER PUBLIC SPACES, AND MAINTAIN SOCIAL CONTROLS THAT DISCOURAGE UNDESIRABLE BEHAVIORS, LIKE UNDERAGE SUBSTANCE USE AND GANG ACTIVITY. AMONG RESIDENTS OF ROXBURY, THE HOMICIDE RATE PER 100,000 POPULATION WAS 16.1 COMPARED TO 6.6 FOR BOSTON OVERALL.4 THE RATE OF NONFATAL GUNSHOT/STABBING EMERGENCY DEPARTMENT VISITS WAS 153.6 PER 100,000 POPULATION IN ROXBURY, COMPARED TO 76.9 FOR BOSTON OVERALL.- TRANSPORTATION. COMMUNITY FORUM ATTENDEES IDENTIFIED A NEED FOR A BROAD INTERVENTION TO ADDRESS TRANSPORTATION EQUITY ISSUES ON MISSION HILL. ACCESS TO AFFORDABLE AND RELIABLE FORMS OF TRANSPORTATION WAS A KEY AREA OF CONCERN FOR OLDER ADULTS, WHO RELY ON VARIOUS FORMS OF PUBLIC TRANSPORT TO ATTEND DOCTOR'S APPOINTMENTS, VISIT THE PHARMACY, AND ACCESS OTHER HEALTH AND SOCIAL SERVICES.- OLDER ADULTS. 12% OF ROXBURY'S POPULATION AND 7% OF MISSION HILL'S POPULATION IS OVER 65 YEARS OF AGE COMPARED TO 10% FOR BOSTON AND 14% FOR THE COMMONWEALTH. MANY FORUM ATTENDEES IDENTIFIED OLDER ADULTS AS A POPULATION THAT HAS UNIQUE NEEDS AND DISPARATE HEALTH OUTCOMES, YET ARE RELUCTANT TO VOICE CONCERNS OVER FEAR OF DISPLACEMENT FROM THEIR HOMES AND COMMUNITIES.- DISPARITIES IN HEALTH OUTCOMES EXIST IN NEBH CBSA BY RACE/ETHNICITY, FOREIGN BORN STATUS, AND LANGUAGE: AS WAS ESTABLISHED IN THE 2013 NEBH COMMUNITY BENEFITS CHNA REPORT, THERE ARE MAJOR HEALTH DISPARITIES FOR RESIDENTS LIVING IN NEBH'S CBSA. THIS IS PARTICULARLY TRUE FOR RACIALLY/ETHNICALLY DIVERSE, FOREIGN BORN, AND NON-ENGLISH SPEAKING RESIDENTS LIVING IN ROXBURY, AT THE HEART OF NEBH'S CBSA, WHICH FACE MANY OF THE MOST SIGNIFICANT DISPARITIES IN THE CITY OF BOSTON AND MASSACHUSETTS OVERALL. THE IMPACT OF RACISM, BARRIERS TO CARE, AND DISPARITIES IN HEALTH OUTCOMES THAT THOSE LIVING IN NEBH'S CBSA FACE ARE WIDELY DOCUMENTED IN THE LITERATURE AND ARE CONFIRMED BY NUMEROUS NATIONAL, COMMONWEALTH, AND LOCAL DATA SOURCES, INCLUDING QUANTITATIVE DATA FROM THE BOSTON PUBLIC HEALTH COMMISSION 2014-15 HEALTH OF BOSTON REPORT. IT SHOULD ALSO BE NOTED THAT ONE OF THE DOMINANT THEMES FROM THE ASSESSMENT'S KEY INFORMANT INTERVIEWS AND COMMUNITY FORUMS WAS THE IMPACT THAT THE UNDERLYING SOCIAL DETERMINANTS LISTED ABOVE HAVE ON THE SERVICE AREA, PARTICULARLY ON LOW INCOME, RACIALLY/ETHNICALLY DIVERSE, AND OLDER ADULT COHORTS.- RACE/ETHNICITY. 9% OF ROXBURY'S POPULATION AND 45% OF MISSION HILL'S POPULATION IS NON- HISPANIC WHITE COMPARED TO 75% FOR BOSTON AND THE COMMONWEALTH. NON-HISPANIC BLACKS, NON-HISPANIC ASIANS, AND HISPANICS REPRESENT A SIGNIFICANTLY LARGER PERCENTAGE OF ROXBURY'S POPULATION (55%, 2%, 29%) AND MISSION HILL'S POPULATION (21%, 12%, 20%) COMPARED TO BOSTON (13%, 6%, 5%) AND THE COMMONWEALTH (6%, 6%, 10%).- FOREIGN BORN. 27% OF ROXBURY'S POPULATION AND 23% OF MISSION HILL'S POPULATION IS FOREIGN BORN COMPARED TO 15% FOR THE COMMONWEALTH.- LINGUISTICALLY ISOLATED. 43% OF ROXBURY'S POPULATION AND 39% OF MISSION HILL'S POPULATION IS LINGUISTICALLY ISOLATED COMPARED TO 37% FOR BOSTON AND 22% FOR THE COMMONWEALTH. 27% OF ROXBURY'S POPULATION AND 18% OF MISSION HILL'S POPULATION SPEAK SPANISH AT HOME COMPARED TO 16% FOR BOSTON AND 8% FOR THE COMMONWEALTH.IT IS CRUCIAL THAT THESE DISPARITIES BE ADDRESSED AND, TO THIS END, NEBH'S COMMUNITY HEALTH IMPROVEMENT PLAN CONTINUES TO INCLUDE A RANGE OF PROGRAMS THAT ARE TARGETED TO ADDRESS THESE DISPARITIES. HOWEVER, IT IS CRITICAL TO NOTE THAT THERE IS A MULTITUDE OF INDIVIDUAL, COMMUNITY AND SOCIETAL FACTORS THAT WORK TOGETHER TO CREATE THESE INEQUITIES. THE UNDERLYING ISSUE IS NOT ONLY RACE/ETHNICITY, FOREIGN BORN STATUS, OR LANGUAGE BUT RATHER A BROAD ARRAY OF INTER-RELATED ISSUES INCLUDING ECONOMIC OPPORTUNITY, EDUCATION, CRIME, AND COMMUNITY COHESION. ARGUABLY, THESE ARE THE LEADING DETERMINANTS OF HEALTH FOR ALL URBAN COMMUNITIES IN THE UNITED STATES, AND THEY ARE DAUNTING CHALLENGES. NEBH IS COMMITTED TO DOING WHAT IT CAN TO ADDRESS THESE FACTORS AND MANY OF THE COMPONENTS OF NEBH'S CHIP IS STRUCTURED TO ADDRESS THE EXISTING HEALTH DISPARITIES AND INEQUITIES IN SOME WAY.- LIMITED ACCESS TO PRIMARY CARE MEDICAL AND SPECIALTY CARE, ORAL HEALTH, AND BEHAVIORAL HEALTH SERVICES FOR LOW INCOME, MEDICAID INSURED, UNINSURED, AND OTHER POPULATION SEGMENTS FACING BARRIERS TO CARE. MASSACHUSETTS HAS ONE OF THE HIGHEST RATES OF HEALTH INSURANCE AND ONE OF THE STRONGEST, MOST ROBUST HEALTH SERVICE SYSTEMS IN THE NATION, YET THERE ARE STILL SUBSTANTIAL POCKETS OF LOW INCOME, MEDICAID INSURED, UNINSURED, AND UNDERINSURED RESIDENTS WHO HAVE LIMITED ACCESS TO NEEDED SERVICES AND/OR ARE NOT PROPERLY ENGAGED IN ESSENTIAL MEDICAL, ORAL, AND BEHAVIORAL HEALTH SERVICES. AS WILL BE DISCUSSED BELOW, THESE POPULATIONS ARE, IN TURN, MORE LIKELY TO USE THE EMERGENCY ROOM AND MORE LIKELY TO HAVE HEALTH RISK FACTORS SUCH AS OBESITY, POOR FITNESS, AND RISKY ALCOHOL USE AS WELL AS MORE LIKELY TO HAVE DIABETES, HYPERTENSION, AND ASTHMA.- LOW INCOME SEGMENTS MOST AT-RISK. KEY INFORMANTS AND COMMUNITY FORUM PARTICIPANTS STRESSED THE FACT THAT DESPITE THE RELATIVE AFFLUENCE OF THE AREA, THERE WERE POCKETS OF SERVICE AREA RESIDENTS WHO STRUGGLED WITH POOR HEALTH OUTCOMES AND FACED SIGNIFICANT BARRIERS TO ACCESS. THESE POPULATIONS WERE MORE LIKELY TO BE LOW INCOME, OLDER ADULT, AND FOREIGN BORN.- HIGH UNINSURANCE RATES IN LOW INCOME. AMONG LOW-INCOME RESIDENTS OF THE COMMONWEALTH, THE UNINSURANCE RATE WAS 8% - DOUBLE THE UNINSURANCE RATE OF THE COMMONWEALTH'S TOTAL POPULATION (4%). ACCORDING TO THE BLUE CROSS FOUNDATION, UNINSURED ADULTS IN THE COMMONWEALTH WERE MORE LIKELY TO BE YOUNG, MALE, AND SINGLE, WITH LOWER REPORTED EDUCATIONAL ATTAINMENT. HOWEVER, THE MAJORITY OF UNINSURED ADULTS WERE EMPLOYED.- LACK OF ACCESS TO PRIMARY MEDICAL AND ORAL HEALTH CARE SERVICES. UNINSURED ADULTS ARE LESS LIKELY TO USE HEALTH CARE SERVICES THAN THOSE THAT ARE INSURED. APPROXIMATELY 87% OF INSURED ADULTS IN THE COMMONWEALTH REPORTED VISITING A GENERAL PHYSICIAN WITHIN THE PAST 12 MONTHS, COMPARED TO 63% OF UNINSURED ADULTS. UNINSURED ADULTS ARE MORE LIKELY TO REPORT PROBLEMS OBTAINING CARE COMPARED TO THOSE THAT WERE INSURED (37% VERSUS 21%, RESPECTIVELY. MOST CONCERNING IS THAT AMONG ALL ADULTS WHO REPORTED A HEALTH CARE VISIT, UNINSURED ADULTS WERE NEARLY 30 PERCENTAGE POINTS LESS LIKELY TO RATE THE QUALITY OF CARE AS VERY GOOD OR EXCELLENT.15 FINALLY, 3 IN 10 (30.1%) OF THOSE LIVING AT 138% OF THE FEDERAL POVERTY LEVEL OR BELOW REPORTED NOT GETTING NEEDED DENTAL CARE DUE TO COST AND 1 IN 5 (19.3%) WERE NOT ABLE TO FILL A NEEDED DRUG PRESCRIPTION DUE TO COST."
201842269349302279,042103612,- LACK OF ACCESS TO BEHAVIORAL HEALTH SERVICES,"ONE OF THE MOST COMMON FINDINGS FROM THOSE WHO WERE INTERVIEWED OR PARTICIPATED IN THE COMMUNITY FORUMS WAS THE BURDEN OF MENTAL HEALTH AND SUBSTANCE ABUSE ON RESIDENTS THROUGHOUT NEBH'S SERVICE AREA. RESIDENTS SUFFERED FROM A BROAD RANGE OF ISSUES INCLUDING DEPRESSION, ANXIETY, DEMENTIA, ALCOHOL ABUSE, AND OPIOID ABUSE. IN ADDITION TO DISCUSSING THE BURDEN OF THESE ISSUES ON INDIVIDUALS, FAMILIES, AND THE COMMUNITY, PARTICIPANTS REFLECTED ON THE LACK OF EDUCATIONAL, ASSESSMENT, AND TREATMENT SERVICES AVAILABLE IN THE COMMUNITY TO SUPPORT THOSE WITH BEHAVIORAL HEALTH ISSUES.- HIGHER EMERGENCY DEPARTMENT UTILIZATION. APPROXIMATELY 38% OF UNINSURED ADULTS IN THE COMMONWEALTH REPORTED VISITING THE EMERGENCY DEPARTMENT IN THE PAST YEAR; 18% REPORTED THAT THEIR MOST RECENT ED VISIT WAS FOR A NON-EMERGENCY CONDITION THAT COULD HAVE BEEN TREATED BY A GENERAL PHYSICIAN IF ONE WAS AVAILABLE. THIS COMPARED TO 32% AND 13%, RESPECTIVELY, FOR INSURED ADULTS.- HIGH RATES OF THE LEADING HEALTH RISK FACTORS. ONE OF THE LEADING FINDINGS FROM THE ASSESSMENT IS THAT MANY COMMUNITIES AND/OR POPULATION SEGMENTS IN NEBH'S CBSA HAVE HIGH RATES OF CHRONIC PHYSICAL AND BEHAVIORAL HEALTH CONDITIONS. IN SOME INDIVIDUALS, THESE CONDITIONS HAVE UNDERLYING GENETIC ROOTS THAT ARE DIFFICULT TO COUNTER. HOWEVER, FOR MOST PEOPLE THESE CONDITIONS ARE WIDELY CONSIDERED TO BE PREVENTABLE OR MANAGEABLE. ADDRESSING THE LEADING HEALTH RISK FACTORS (E.G., LACK OF NUTRITIONAL FOOD AND PHYSICAL ACTIVITY, ALCOHOL/ILLICIT DRUG ABUSE, AND TOBACCO USE) IS CRITICAL TO CHRONIC DISEASE PREVENTION AND MANAGEMENT EFFORTS. IT SHOULD BE NOTED THAT MOST AREAS WITHIN NEBH'S SERVICE AREA FARE WELL AGAINST COMMONWEALTH AVERAGES ON THESE RISK FACTORS. HOWEVER, THERE ARE CITIES/TOWNS WHOSE RATES ARE NOT AS FAVORABLE. AS STATED ABOVE, LOW-INCOME, FOREIGN BORN, AND OLDER SEGMENTS OF THE POPULATION ARE MORE LIKELY TO BE AT-RISK.- OVERWEIGHT/OBESE. 30% OF ROXBURY ADULTS REPORTED IN OBESE CATEGORIES COMPARED TO 22% FOR BOSTON. 30% OF ROXBURY ADULTS CONSUMED VEGETABLES LESS THAN ONCE PER DAY COMPARED TO 25% FOR BOSTON.- CIGARETTE SMOKING. 18% OF ROXBURY ADULTS REPORTED AS CURRENT SMOKERS COMPARED TO 16% FOR BOSTON OVERALL.- ALCOHOL USE. ROXBURY'S ALCOHOL-RELATED HOSPITAL PATIENT ENCOUNTER RATE PER 1,000 POPULATION WAS 22.6 COMPARED TO 17.7 FOR BOSTON.- HIGH RATES OF SUBSTANCE USE AND MENTAL HEALTH ISSUES. DURING INTERVIEWS AND COMMUNITY FORUMS, RESIDENTS AND AREA SERVICE PROVIDERS SPOKE PASSIONATELY ABOUT THE TREMENDOUS IMPACT THAT MENTAL HEALTH AND SUBSTANCE USE ISSUES HAVE ON MANY INDIVIDUALS AND FAMILIES IN THE SERVICE AREA. DEPRESSION AND ANXIETY, ISOLATION, ALCOHOL ABUSE, OPIOID AND PRESCRIPTION DRUG ABUSE, AND POST-TRAUMATIC STRESS DISORDER WERE IDENTIFIED AS MAJOR HEALTH CONCERNS. OPIOID ABUSE WAS A PARTICULAR CONCERN FOR RESIDENTS AND SERVICE PROVIDERS IN NEBH'S SERVICE AREA AND THERE WERE CALLS FOR GREATER OUTREACH, EDUCATION, SCREENING, AND TREATMENT SERVICES FOR ALL SEGMENTS OF THE POPULATION. DESPITE THE BURDEN OF MENTAL HEALTH AND SUBSTANCE ABUSE ON ALL PEOPLE, THERE IS AN EXTREMELY LIMITED SERVICE SYSTEM AVAILABLE TO MEET SPECIALIZED NEEDS, ESPECIALLY FOR OLDER ADULTS, THOSE WITH MILD TO MODERATE EPISODIC ISSUES, AND THOSE WITH SEVERE, COMPLEX, CHRONIC CONDITIONS. EFFORTS NEED TO BE MADE TO EXPAND ACCESS, REDUCE BARRIERS TO CARE (INCLUDING STIGMA), AND IMPROVE THE QUALITY OF PRIMARY CARE AND SPECIALIZED BEHAVIORAL HEALTH SERVICES.- SUBSTANCE USE. ROXBURY'S RATE OF ADMISSIONS TO TREATMENT PROGRAMS FOR SUBSTANCE USE PER 1,000 POPULATION WAS 55.8 COMPARED TO 30.2 FOR BOSTON.- SUBSTANCE USE. ROXBURY'S ALCOHOL-RELATED HOSPITAL PATIENT ENCOUNTER RATE PER 1,000 POPULATION WAS 22.6 COMPARED TO 17.7 FOR BOSTON. SIMILARLY, THE DRUG-RELATED HOSPITAL PATIENT ENCOUNTER RATE PER 1,000 POPULATION WAS 12.2 COMPARED TO 6.8 FOR BOSTON.- SUBSTANCE USE. ROXBURY'S UNINTENTIONAL DRUG OVERDOSE DEATH RATE PER 100,000 POPULATION WAS 15.9 COMPARED TO 15.5 FOR BOSTON. THE UNINTENTIONAL OPIOID OVERDOSE/POISONING HOSPITAL PATIENT ENCOUNTER RATE WAS 1.9 FOR ROXBURY COMPARED TO 1.1 FOR BOSTON.- SUBSTANCE USE. ROXBURY'S SUBSTANCE ABUSE MORTALITY RATE PER 100,000 RESIDENTS WAS36.3 COMPARED TO 33.9 FOR BOSTON (HOB 2012-2013 - AVERAGE ANNUAL RATES FOR 2005- 2011).- MENTAL HEALTH. THE RATE OF MENTAL HEALTH HOSPITALIZATIONS FOR ROXBURY WAS 9.0 COMPARED TO 8.0 FOR BOSTON.- MENTAL HEALTH. 13% OF ROXBURY ADULTS REPORTED AS BEING IN POOR MENTAL OR EMOTIONAL HEALTH MORE THAN 15 DAYS IN THE PAST MONTH COMPARED TO 12% FOR BOSTON RESIDENTS.- MENTAL HEALTH. KEY INFORMANTS AND COMMUNITY FORUM PARTICIPANTS IDENTIFIED ISOLATION AND DEPRESSION AS A LEADING ISSUE FACED BY THE AREA'S OLDER ADULT POPULATION. INTERVIEWEES AND FORUM PARTICIPANTS DISCUSSED ADDITIONAL CHALLENGES FACED BY OLDER ADULTS WHO ARE MORE LIKELY TO STRUGGLE WITH CHRONIC PHYSICAL HEALTH CONDITIONS. THEY FACE BARRIERS THAT MAKE IT HARDER FOR THEM TO LEAVE THEIR HOMES, ESPECIALLY IF THEY ARE SICK, FRAIL, OR DEPRESSED.- HIGH RATES OF CHRONIC AND ACUTE PHYSICAL HEALTH CONDITIONS, PARTICULARLY FOR LOW INCOME POPULATIONS (E.G., HEART DISEASE, HYPERTENSION, CANCER, AND ASTHMA). THE ASSESSMENT'S QUANTITATIVE DATA SHOWS THAT, OVERALL, NEBH'S SERVICE AREA FARES BETTER THAN THE COMMONWEALTH WITH RESPECT TO CHRONIC DISEASE RATES. IT SHOULD BE NOTED THAT EVEN FOR THOSE COMMUNITIES THAT DO NOT HAVE RATES THAT ARE STATISTICALLY HIGHER THAN THE COMMONWEALTH, THESE CONDITIONS ARE STILL THE LEADING CAUSES OF PREMATURE DEATH.- CARDIOVASCULAR DISEASE. THE HOSPITALIZATION RATE PER 1,000 POPULATION DUE TO HEART DISEASE WAS 13.2 FOR ROXBURY COMPARED TO 9.1 FOR BOSTON. THE MORTALITY RATE PER 100,000 DUE TO HEART DISEASE WAS 148.3 FOR ROXBURY COMPARED TO 133.6 FOR BOSTON.- HYPERTENSION. THE HOSPITALIZATION RATE PER 100,000 DUE TO HYPERTENSION WAS 110 FOR BOSTON COMPARED TO 45 FOR THE COMMONWEALTH. 28.3% OF ROXBURY ADULTS REPORTED HAVING HYPERTENSION COMPARED TO 24% FOR BOSTON OVERALL.- DIABETES. THE DIABETES PREVALENCE IN ROXBURY WAS SIGNIFICANTLY HIGHER COMPARED TO BOSTON OVERALL. 15.1% OF ROXBURY ADULTS REPORTED HAVING DIABETES COMPARED TO 8.6% OF BOSTON ADULTS.

THE HOSPITALIZATION RATE DUE TO ASTHMA PER 1,000 POPULATION WAS 5.9 FOR ROXBURY, COMPARED TO 2.6 FOR BOSTON. SIMILARLY, THE HOSPITAL EMERGENCY DISCHARGE PER 1,000 POPULATION DUE TO ASTHMA WAS 17.5 FOR ROXBURY, COMPARED TO 9.0 FOR BOSTON OVERALL.- HIGH RATES OF HIV/AIDS. GREAT STRIDES HAVE BEEN MADE IN CONTROLLING AND MANAGING HIV/AIDS, AND FOR MANY IT IS MANAGED AS A CHRONIC CONDITION WITH MEDICATIONS. ALTHOUGH RATES OF ILLNESS, DEATH, AND HIV TRANSMISSION DECLINED OVERALL IN THE PAST DECADE, HIV/AIDS CONTINUES TO IMPACT CERTAIN SEGMENTS OF THE POPULATION, INCLUDING MEN WHO HAVE SEX WITH MEN AND INJECTION DRUG USERS. IN NEBH'S CBSA, RATES OF HIV/AIDS ARE PARTICULARLY HIGH IN ROXBURY. THE HOSPITALIZATION RATE PER 100,000 WHERE HIV/AIDS WAS THE PRIMARY REASON FOR THE VISIT WAS 40 FOR BOSTON COMPARED TO 12 FOR THE COMMONWEALTH.- HIGH RATES OF CANCER, PARTICULARLY FOR LOW INCOME, RACIALLY/ETHNICALLY DIVERSE, AND OTHERWISE AT- RISK POPULATION SEGMENTS. MANY OF THE COMMUNITIES THAT ARE PART OF NEBH'S SERVICE AREA HAVE HIGH CANCER INCIDENCE, HOSPITALIZATION OR MORTALITY RATES. THIS IS PARTICULARLY TRUE FOR CERTAIN CANCERS IN SPECIFIC COMMUNITIES. ROXBURY IS MORE BURDENED BY COLORECTAL CANCER, BREAST CANCER, LUNG CANCER, PANCREATIC CANCER, AND PROSTATE CANCER. THERE ARE A MYRIAD OF FACTORS ASSOCIATED WITH CANCER AND MANY OF THEM ARE DIFFICULT TO ASSESS OR ADDRESS. HOWEVER, AT THE ROOT OF ADDRESSING CANCER AND HIGH MORTALITY IS SCREENING, EARLY DETECTION, PEER SUPPORT, AND ACCESS TO TIMELY, SUPPORTIVE, QUALITY TREATMENT.- CANCER. ROXBURY'S MORTALITY RATE DUE TO COLORECTAL CANCER PER 100,000 POPULATION WAS 25.5 COMPARED TO 16.4 FOR BOSTON. THE MORTALITY RATE DUE TO LUNG CANCER WAS 64.3 COMPARED TO 45.4 FOR BOSTON.- CANCER. ROXBURY'S MORTALITY RATE DUE TO BREAST CANCER IN FEMALES PER 100,000 POPULATION WAS 23.6 COMPARED TO 17.9 FOR BOSTON. THE MORTALITY RATE DUE TO PROSTATE CANCER WAS 49.5 COMPARED TO 25.7 FOR BOSTON.- CANCER. ROXBURY'S MORTALITY RATE DUE TO PANCREATIC CANCER PER 100,000 WAS 16.1 COMPARED TO 12.1 FOR BOSTON."

NEBH HAS FRAMED THE COMMUNITY HEALTH NEEDS IN THREE PRIORITY AREAS, WHICH TOGETHER ENCOMPASS THE BROAD RANGE OF HEALTH ISSUES AND SOCIAL DETERMINANTS OF HEALTH FACING RESIDENTS LIVING IN NEBH'S CBSA. THESE THREE AREAS ARE: 1) SOCIAL DETERMINANTS HEALTH (INCLUDING POVERTY, FOOD INSECURITY, SAFETY AND VIOLENCE), 2) CHRONIC DISEASE MANAGEMENT AND PREVENTION (INCLUDING PHYSICAL, BEHAVIORAL, AND EMOTIONAL RISK FACTORS AS WELL AS CHRONIC DISEASE MANAGEMENT) AND 3) ELDER HEALTH (INCLUDING ACCESS TO CARE, FALLS PREVENTION, DEPRESSION/ANXIETY, AND ISOLATION).IT SHOULD BE NOTED THAT ONE OF THE PRIMARY DIFFERENCES WITH RESPECT TO NEBH'S COMMUNITY HEALTH ASSESSMENT IN 2016 COMPARED TO ITS ASSESSMENT IN 2013 WAS THE IMPACT AND BURDEN OF BEHAVIORAL HEALTH ISSUES. WHILE, NEBH DOES NOT HAVE THE EXPERTISE AND CAPACITY TO DEDICATE A GREAT DEAL OF COMMUNITY BENEFITS RESOURCES TO BEHAVIORAL HEALTH ISSUES, THE ORGANIZATION IS COMMITTED TO DOING WHAT IT CAN TO PROMOTE AWARENESS, EDUCATE, AND REDUCE THE IMPACTS OF BEHAVIORAL HEALTH ISSUES, PARTICULARLY FOR YOUTH/ADOLESCENT AND OLDER ADULT SEGMENTS OF ITS SERVICE AREA. FOR EXAMPLE, NEBH WORKS WITH COMMUNITY PARTNERS TO REDUCE VIOLENCE AND ITS IMPACTS AMONG YOUTH. NEBH ALSO PROMOTES PHYSICAL ACTIVITY AND SOCIALIZATION AMONG ITS OLDER ADULT POPULATION WHICH HAS CLEAR BENEFITS WITH RESPECT TO PHYSICAL AND EMOTIONAL WELL-BEING. FINALLY, WITH RESPECT TO CHRONIC DISEASE MANAGEMENT, NEBH SPONSORS EDUCATIONAL SESSIONS AND WORKSHOPS THAT EDUCATE PARTICIPANTS ON THE RISK FACTORS ASSOCIATED WITH CHRONIC DISEASE, INCLUDING THE PHYSICAL, BEHAVIORAL, AND EMOTIONAL FACTORS SUCH AS DEPRESSION, ALCOHOL AND DRUG ABUSE."
201842269349302279,042103612,COMMUNITY HEALTH NEEDS ASSESSMENT - ADDRESSING COMMUNITY HEALTH NEEDS,"DURING THE FISCAL YEAR ENDED SEPTEMBER 30, 2016LARGE PROPORTIONS OF INDIVIDUALS RESIDING WITHIN BOSTON AND NEBH'S COMMUNITY BENEFITS SERVICE AREA LIVE IN POVERTY, HAVE LIMITED FORMAL EDUCATION, ARE UNEMPLOYED, AND STRUGGLE TO AFFORD FOOD AND OTHER ESSENTIAL HOUSEHOLD ITEMS. THESE POPULATIONS ARE DISPROPORTIONATELY FROM RACIAL/ETHNIC MINORITY GROUPS AND, PARTLY AS A RESULT OF THEIR POVERTY, FACE DISPARITIES IN HEALTH AND ACCESS TO CARE OUTCOMES. IT IS CRITICAL TO NOTE THAT THERE IS A MULTITUDE OF INDIVIDUAL, COMMUNITY AND SOCIETAL FACTORS THAT WORK TOGETHER TO CREATE THESE INEQUITIES. IT IS INSUFFICIENT TO TALK SOLELY ABOUT RACE/ETHNICITY, FOREIGN BORN STATUS, OR LANGUAGE AS THE UNDERLYING AND CORRELATIVE ISSUES RELATED TO HEALTH AND WELL-BEING INVOLVE ECONOMIC OPPORTUNITY, EDUCATION, CRIME, AND COMMUNITY COHESION. NEBH STRIVES TO ADDRESS THE PRIORITY AREAS IN ITS CHNA AND IMPLEMENTATION STRATEGY WHICH ARE AVAILABLE ON THE HOSPITAL'S WEBSITE. AS NOTED THROUGHOUT THIS FORM 990 SCHEDULE H, NEBH'S MOST RECENTLY COMPLETED CHNA WAS COMPLETED DURING THE FISCAL YEAR ENDED 2016.

The hospitals CHNA was led by an Advisory Task Force (ATF) comprised of a diverse group of 16 individuals, including hospital representatives, public health leaders, and other stakeholder organizations, such as representatives from local health departments. The ATF reviewed quantitative and qualitative community health data, as well as local, regional and national health goals. Based on their findings, ATF members designed a survey to identify trends in how participants perceived the severity of key health issues in the following categories: wellness and prevention, access to care, quality of life, and environment. Community members responded to the survey by attending a community input session or completing it online or via hardcopy. Based on the ATFs recommendation, the hospital identified Southern BALTIMORE CITY and Northern Anne Arundel County as its Community Benefit Service Area (CBSA) a geography with a high density of low-income or vulnerable residents within close proximity of the hospital. Health priorities for the CBSA include chronic disease (heart disease/stroke, cancer, diabetes, and obesity), and child and family wellness. The hospitals FY15 CHNA and three-year Implementation Strategies were endorsed by MedStar Harbors Board of Directors and approved by the MedStar Health Board of Directors. The document was published on the hospitals website on June 30, 2015. As a proud member of MedStar Health, representatives from MedStar Harbor routinely participate in the MedStar Health community benefit workgroup. The workgroup is comprised of community health professionals who represent all ten MedStar hospitals. The team analyzes local and regional community health data, establishes system-wide community health programming performance and evaluation measures and shares best practices."

MedStar Health and its healthcare facilities will: * TREAT ALL PATIENTS EQUITABLY, WITH DIGNITY, WITH RESPECT AND WITH COMPASSION. * SERVE THE EMERGENCY HEALTH CARE NEEDS OF EVERYONE WHO PRESENTS AT OUR FACILITIES REGARDLESS OF A PATIENT'S ABILITY TO PAY FOR CARE. * ASSIST THOSE PATIENTS WHO ARE ADMITTED THROUGH OUR ADMISSIONS PROCESS FOR NON-URGENT, MEDICALLY NECESSARY CARE WHO CANNOT PAY FOR PART OF ALL OF THE CARE THEY RECEIVE. * BALANCE NEEDED FINANCIAL ASSISTANCE FOR SOME PATIENTS WITH BROADER FISCAL RESPONSIBILITIES IN ORDER TO KEEP ITS HOSPITALS' DOORS OPEN FOR ALL WHO MAY NEED CARE IN THE COMMUNITY. IN MEETING ITS COMMITMENTS, MEDSTAR HEALTHS FACILITIES WORK WITH THEIR UNINSURED PATIENTS TO GAIN AN UNDERSTANDING OF EACH PATIENTS FINANCIAL RESOURCES PRIOR TO ADMISSION (FOR SCHEDULED SERVICES) OR PRIOR TO BILLING (FOR EMERGENCY SERVICES). BASED ON THIS INFORMATION AND PATIENT ELIGIBILITY, MEDSTAR HEALTHS FACILITIES ASSISTS UNINSURED PATIENTS WHO RESIDE WITHIN THE COMMUNITIES WE SERVE IN ONE OR MORE OF THE FOLLOWING WAYS: * ASSIST WITH ENROLLMENT IN PUBLICLY-FUNDED ENTITLEMENT PROGRAMS (E.G., MEDICAID). * ASSIST WITH CONSIDERATION OF FUNDING THAT MAY BE AVAILABLE FROM OTHER CHARITABLE ORGANIZATIONS. * PROVIDE CHARITY CARE AND FINANCIAL ASSISTANCE ACCORDING TO APPLICABLE GUIDELINES. * PROVIDE FINANCIAL ASSISTANCE FOR PAYMENT OF FACILITY CHARGES USING A SLIDING SCALE BASED ON PATIENT FAMILY INCOME AND FINANCIAL RESOURCES. * OFFER PERIODIC PAYMENT PLANS TO ASSIST PATIENTS WITH FINANCING THEIR HEALTHCARE SERVICES. Each facility posts the policy, including a description of the applicable communities it serves, in each major patient registration area and in any other areas required by applicable regulations, communicates the information to patients as required by this policy and applicable regulations and makes a copy of the policy available to all patients. Additionally, the Maryland Patient Information Sheet/MedStars Patient Information Sheet is provided to inpatients on admission and at time of final account billing. MedStar Health believes that its patients have personal responsibilities related to the financial aspects of their healthcare needs. The charity care, financial assistance, and periodic payment plans available under this policy are not available to those patients who fail to fulfill their responsibilities. For purposes of this policy, patient responsibilities include: * Completing financial disclosure forms necessary to evaluate their eligibility for publicly-funded healthcare programs, charity care programs, and other forms of financial assistance. These disclosure forms must be completed accurately, truthfully, and timely to allow MedStar Healths facilities to properly counsel patients concerning the availability of financial assistance. * Working with the facilitys financial counselors and other financial services staff to ensure there is a complete understanding of the patients financial situation and constraints. * Completing appropriate applications for publicly-funded healthcare programs. This responsibility includes responding in a timely fashion to requests for documentation to support eligibility. * Making applicable payments for services in a timely fashion, including any payments made pursuant to deferred and periodic payment schedules. * Providing updated financial information to the facilitys financial counselors on a timely basis as the patients circumstances may change. * It is the responsibility of the patient to inform the MedStar hospital of their existing eligibility under a medical hardship during the 12-month period. Uninsured patients of MedStar Healths facilities may be eligible for charity care or sliding-scale financial assistance under this policy. The financial counselors and financial services staff determine eligibility for charity care and sliding-scale financial assistance based on review of income for the patient and their family (household), other financial resources available to the patients family, family size, and the extent of the medical costs to be incurred by the patient."
201821319349301312,520491660,COMMUNITY INFORMATION,"PART VI, LINE 4 GEOGRAPHIC: MedStar Harbor Hospitals CBSA includes all residents of ZIP code 21225, the hospitals home ZIP code. The CBSA spans southern Baltimore City and northern Anne Arundel County, and includes four neighborhoods: Brooklyn, Brooklyn Park, Cherry Hill and Pumphrey. In particular, the hospital will focus on the Cherry Hill community. This area was selected due to its very high poverty rate and its close proximity to the hospital, as well as the opportunity to build on pre-existing programs, services, and partnerships. DEMOGRAPHIC: Cherry Hill is historically a Black/African American neighborhood, with roots going back to the 17th century. After World War II, more than 600 housing units were built there by the United States War Housing Administration, specifically for African American war workers. Shortly after the war, these units were made into low-income housing. Additional low-income housing units have been added throughout the years, making Cherry Hill one of the largest housing projects east of Chicago. 90.3% of Cherry Hill residents are Black/African American. 60.3% of Cherry Hill residents age 25 years and older have a high school education or less. The median household income for Cherry Hill is $22,659, compared to $37,992 for the entire CBSA and approximately 57.2% of Cherry Hill families live in poverty. In terms of health care, the Cherry Hill community houses MHH, as well as a local branch of the Family Health Centers of Baltimore, which is a FEDERALLY QUALIFIED HEALTH CENTER(FQHC) PROVIDING HEALTH CARE SERVICES ON A SLIDING FEE SCALE. IN ADDITION, BALTIMORE CITY HEALTH DEPARTMENT PROGRAMS OPERATE CITY-WIDE, AND VARIOUS MOBILE SERVICES-SUCH AS A NEEDLE EXCHANGE PROGRAM, VIOLENCE PREVENTION, MATERNAL AND INFANT NURSING, LEAD POISONING AND ABATEMENT PROGRAMS AND OTHERS-IN THE CHERRY HILL AREA. According to the Cherry Hill Health Profile, the life expectancy at birth of a Cherry Hill resident is 69.5, compared to 73.6 in Baltimore City. The all cause mortality rate In Cherry Hill is 124.6; the all cause mortality rate in Baltimore City is 99.5. High rates of type 2 diabetes and heart disease, including stroke, occur in this community. For a variety of reasons, including the high poverty rate and low rate of health care insurance coverage, many Cherry Hill residents often use the MedStar Harbor Hospital emergency department for primary care services. A steady decrease is anticipated in this area over the next few fiscal years as patients become insured through the Affordable Care Act. Despite the convenient neighborhood location of a FQHC, many residents do not utilize a primary care physician. Typically, a chronic condition, such as diabetes or heart disease, presents severe enough symptoms to warrant a trip to the emergency department. In many cases, several co-morbidities are found to be present at this time. Without primary care follow-up, however, these conditions usually cannot be addressed fully in the time allotted for the emergent issue. In other CASES, PATIENTS MAY HAVE SYMPTOMS OF A MUCH LESS SERIOUS ILLNESS-A SIMPLE COLD, FOR EXAMPLE-BUT, SINCE THEY DO NOT HAVE A PRIMARY HEALTH CARE PROVIDER, THEY ALSO VISIT THE EMERGENCY DEPARTMENT FOR THESE AILMENTS. AS A RESULT, MANY OF THEIR MOST BASIC HEALTH NEEDS OFTEN ARE NOT MET."
201821319349301312,520491660,PROMOTION OF COMMUNITY HEALTH,"PART VI, LINE 5 As a community partner, MedStar Harbor provided services to improve the health and well-being of residents in one of the most underserved communities in Baltimore City Cherry Hill. Priority areas of focus, as determined by the community health needs assessment, are chronic disease, specifically targeting heart disease/stroke, cancer, diabetes, and obesity; and child and family wellness. In effort to reduce the incidence, prevalence and risk factors contributing to chronic diseases, the hospital offers a walking program that will focus on increasing physical activity. In FY17 MedStar Harbor collaborated with the MedStar Visiting Nurses Association to provide free blood pressure and diabetes screenings in community settings. Participants with elevated blood pressure and blood/glucose levels are navigated to a primary care provider. MedStar Harbor also offers free and low-cost community-based health education lectures. Lectures are organized and taught by physicians, nurses, and specialized content experts; discussion topics include but are not limited to heart health, diabetes management, and cancer prevention. The hospital also works to establish a community cancer center that provides support, education and resources to patients and family members experiencing cancer. Additionally, cancer programs were offered. The Colorectal Cancer program served 179 people and the Breast & Cervical Cancer Program provided outreach services to more than 600 women. Through its Cherry Hill Healthy Schools Healthy Families program, the hospital also provided a nurse to work closely with at-risk middle and high school students at four schools. The nurse developed lesson plans and taught classes that target children, parents and school staff. She also managed relationships with community partners and served as a liaison between the hospital and the community."

THE ORGANIZATION BELIEVES THAT MEDICARE UNDERPAYMENTS (SHORTFALL) AND THE COST OF BAD DEBT ARE COMMUNITY BENEFIT AND SHOULD BE INCLUDED ON FORM 990, SCHEDULE H, PART I. AS OUTLINED MORE FULLY BELOW, THE ORGANIZATION BELIEVES THAT THESE SERVICES AND RELATED COSTS PROMOTE THE HEALTH OF THE COMMUNITY AS A WHOLE AND ARE RENDERED IN CONJUNCTION WITH THE ORGANIZATION'S CHARITABLE TAX-EXEMPT PURPOSES AND MISSION IN PROVIDING MEDICALLY NECESSARY HEALTHCARE SERVICES TO ALL INDIVIDUALS IN A NON- DISCRIMINATORY MANNER WITHOUT REGARD TO RACE, COLOR, CREED, SEX, NATIONAL ORIGIN, RELIGION OR ABILITY TO PAY AND IS CONSISTENT WITH THE COMMUNITY BENEFIT STANDARD PROMULGATED BY THE IRS. THE COMMUNITY BENEFIT STANDARD IS THE CURRENT STANDARD FOR A TAX-EXEMPT AND CHARITABLE ORGANIZATION UNDER THE INTERNAL REVENUE CODE (""IRC"") 501(C)(3). SATISFYING THE ""COMMUNITY BENEFIT STANDARD,"" AS ARTICULATED BY THE INTERNAL REVENUE SERVICE (IRS) IN REVENUE RULING 69-545, IS CURRENTLY REQUIRED FOR A HOSPITAL TO BE RECOGNIZED AS A CHARITABLE ORGANIZATION UNDER INTERNAL REVENUE CODE (IRC) 501(C)(3). THIS RULING REMOVED THE PREVIOUS REQUIREMENT OF REVENUE RULING 56-185, KNOWN AS THE ""CHARITY CARE STANDARD,"" THAT IN ORDER TO BE A CHARITABLE ORGANIZATION, A HOSPITAL HAD TO PROVIDE, TO THE EXTENT OF ITS FINANCIAL ABILITY, FREE OR REDUCED-COST CARE TO PATIENTS UNABLE TO PAY FOR THEIR CARE. THIS EARLIER RULING EMPHASIZED THAT A LOW LEVEL OF CHARITY CARE DID NOT MEAN THAT A HOSPITAL WAS CHARITABLE SINCE THAT LEVEL COULD REFLECT THE HOSPITAL'S FINANCIAL ABILITY TO PROVIDE SUCH CARE. REVENUE RULING 56-185 ALSO NOTED THAT PUBLICLY SUPPORTED COMMUNITY HOSPITALS WOULD NORMALLY QUALIFY AS CHARITABLE BECAUSE THEY SERVE THE ENTIRE COMMUNITY AND A LOW LEVEL OF CHARITY CARE WOULD NOT IMPACT A HOSPITAL'S CHARITABLE STATUS IF IT WAS DUE TO THE SURROUNDING COMMUNITY'S LACK OF CHARITABLE DEMANDS. DEVELOPED IN REVENUE RULING 69-545, UNDER THE COMMUNITY BENEFIT STANDARD, HOSPITALS WERE JUDGED ON WHETHER THEY PROMOTE THE HEALTH OF A BROAD CLASS OF INDIVIDUALS IN THE COMMUNITY. THIS RULING INVOLVED A HOSPITAL THAT ONLY ADMITTED THOSE WHO COULD PAY FOR THE SERVICES EITHER BY THEMSELVES, THROUGH PRIVATE INSURANCE OR PUBLIC PROGRAMS SUCH AS MEDICARE. IN ADDITION, THE HOSPITAL OPERATED A FULL-TIME EMERGENCY ROOM THAT WAS OPEN TO EVERYONE. THE IRS RULED THAT THE HOSPITAL WAS CHARITABLE BECAUSE IT PROMOTED THE HEALTH OF PEOPLE IN ITS COMMUNITY. THE IRS REASONED THAT BECAUSE THE PROMOTION OF HEALTH WAS A CHARITABLE PURPOSE ACCORDING TO THE GENERAL LAW OF CHARITY, IT FELL WITHIN THE ""GENERALLY ACCEPTED LEGAL SENSE"" OF THE TERM CHARITABLE, AS REQUIRED BY TREASURY REGULATION SECTION 1.501 (C)(3)-1(D)(2). THE IRS RULED THAT THE PROMOTION OF HEALTH, LIKE RELIEF OF POVERTY AND THE ADVANCEMENT OF EDUCATION AND RELIGION, IS ONE OF THE PURPOSES OF THE GENERAL LAW OF CHARITY THAT IS DEEMED BENEFICIAL TO THE COMMUNITY AS A WHOLE EVEN THOUGH THE CLASS OF BENEFICIARIES ELIGIBLE TO RECEIVE A DIRECT BENEFIT FROM ITS ACTIVITIES DOES NOT INCLUDE ALL MEMBERS OF THE COMMUNITY, SUCH AS INDIGENT MEMBERS OF THE COMMUNITY, PROVIDED THAT THE CLASS IS NOT SO SMALL THAT ITS RELIEF IS NOT OF BENEFIT TO THE COMMUNITY. THE IRS CONCLUDED THAT THE HOSPITAL WAS ""PROMOTING THE HEALTH OF A CLASS OF PERSONS THAT IS BROAD ENOUGH TO BENEFIT THE COMMUNITY"" BECAUSE ITS EMERGENCY ROOM WAS OPEN TO ALL AND IT PROVIDED CARE TO THOSE WHO COULD PAY, WHETHER DIRECTLY OR THROUGH THIRD-PARTY REIMBURSEMENT. OTHER FACTORS THAT DEMONSTRATED COMMUNITY BENEFIT INCLUDED: SURPLUS FUNDS WERE USED TO IMPROVE PATIENT CARE, EXPAND FACILITIES AND ADVANCE MEDICAL TRAINING, EDUCATION AND RESEARCH; AND IT WAS CONTROLLED BY A BOARD OF DIRECTORS THAT CONSISTED OF INDEPENDENT CIVIC LEADERS. THE AMERICAN HOSPITAL ASSOCIATION (""AHA"") HOLDS THE POSITION THAT MEDICARE UNDERPAYMENTS (SHORTFALLS) AND BAD DEBT SHOULD BE REPORTED AS COMMUNITY BENEFIT ON FORM 990, SCHEDULE H, PART I, LINE 7. IN A LETTER TO THE IRS DATED AUGUST 21, 2007 RESPONDING TO A DRAFT OF THE NEW FORM 990 AND SCHEDULE H, THE AHA ARGUED THAT MEDICARE UNDERPAYMENTS (SHORTFALLS) IS COMMUNITY BENEFIT FOR THE FOLLOWING REASONS: -PROVIDING CARE FOR THE ELDERLY AND SERVING MEDICARE PATIENTS REMAINS AN ESSENTIAL PART OF THE COMMUNITY BENEFIT STANDARD. -MEDICARE, LIKE MEDICAID, DOES NOT PAY THE FULL COST OF CARE. RECENTLY, MEDICARE REIMBURSES ONLY 92 CENTS FOR EVERY DOLLAR HOSPITALS SPEND TO CARE FOR MEDICARE PATIENTS. -MANY MEDICARE PATIENTS, LIKE THEIR MEDICAID COUNTERPARTS, ARE POOR. MORE THAN 46% OF MEDICARE SPENDING IS FOR BENEFICIARIES WHOSE INCOME IS BELOW 200% OF THE FEDERAL POVERTY LEVEL. MANY ARE ALSO ELIGIBLE FOR MEDICAID, SO CALLED -DUAL ELIGIBLES"". PENNSYLVANIA REQUIRES NON-PROFIT HOSPITALS LIKE CMC TO PROVIDE A MINIMUM LEVEL OF COMMUNITY BENEFIT TO RETAIN EXEMPTION FROM STATE AND LOCAL TAXES. ACCORDING TO STATE GUIDANCE AND CASE LAW, THE UNREIMBURSED COST OF MEDICARE AND BAD DEBT IS CONSIDERED TO BE COMMUNITY BENEFIT FOR STATE TAX EXEMPTION PURPOSES. PART III, LINE 6 ONLY INCLUDES THOSE COSTS THAT ARE ALLOWED TO BE REPORTED ON CMC'S MEDICARE COST REPORT THAT ARE REQUIRED TO BE FILED WITH THE FEDERAL GOVERNMENT. CMC CONSIDERS THE TOTAL MEDICARE UNDERPAYMENTS (SHORTFALL) OF 16,756,589 SHOULD BE REPORTED AS COMMUNITY BENEFIT ON THE FORM 990, SCHEDULE H, PART I, LINE 7. ALONG WITH PROVIDING CARE TO MEDICAID PATIENTS AND PROVIDING FREE OR DISCOUNTED CARE TO OTHER LOW INCOME PATIENTS, THE IRS COMMUNITY BENEFIT STANDARD INCLUDES THE PROVISION OF CARE TO THE ELDERLY AND MEDICARE PATIENTS. LIKE MEDICAID, MEDICARE DOES NOT PAY THE FULL COST OF PROVIDING CARE TO THESE PATIENTS, FORCING CMC TO USE OTHER FUNDS TO COVER THE SHORTFALL. MEDICARE SHORTFALLS MUST BE ABSORBED BY CMC IN ORDER TO CONTINUE TREATING THE ELDERLY IN OUR COMMUNITY. CMC PROVIDES CARE REGARDLESS OF THE MEDICARE SHORTFALL AND IS THEREBY PROVIDING ACCESS TO MEDICAL SERVICES FOR THE ELDERLY AND RELIEVING THE FEDERAL GOVERNMENT OF THE BURDEN OF PAYING THE FULL COST FOR PROVIDING CARE TO MEDICARE PATIENTS. ABSENT THE MEDICARE PROGRAM, IT IS LIKELY THAT MANY MEDICARE PATIENTS WOULD BE ELIGIBLE FOR CHARITY CARE OR OTHER NEEDS BASED GOVERNMENT PROGRAMS. THE AMOUNT EXPENDED TO COVER THE SHORTFALL IS MONEY NOT AVAILABLE FOR FINANCIAL ASSISTANCE AND OTHER COMMUNITY BENEFIT NEEDS. BOTH CMC AND THE AHA BELIEVE THAT PATIENT BAD DEBT BE REPORTED AS A COMMUNITY BENEFIT ON FORM 990, SCHEDULE H, PART I, LINE 7. LIKE MEDICARE UNDERPAYMENTS (SHORTFALLS), BAD DEBT SHOULD BE REPORTED AS COMMUNITY BENEFIT BECAUSE: -A SIGNIFICANT PORTION OF BAD DEBT IS ATTRIBUTABLE TO LOW-INCOME PATIENTS, WHO FOR MANY REASONS DECLINE TO COMPLETE THE FORMS REQUIRED TO ESTABLISH ELIGIBILITY UNDER CMC'S CHARITY CARE OR FINANCIAL ASSISTANCE POLICY (FAP). A 2006 CONGRESSIONAL BUDGET OFFICE (""CBO""), ""NONPROFIT HOSPITALS AND THE PROVISION OF COMMUNITY BENEFIT"", CITED TWO STUDIES INDICATING THAT ""THE GREAT MAJORITY OF BAD DEBT WAS ATTRIBUTABLE TO PATIENTS WITH INCOMES BELOW 200% OF THE FEDERAL POVERTY LINE."" -THE CBO REPORT ALSO NOTED THAT A SUBSTANTIAL PORTION OF THE BAD DEBT IS PENDING CHARITY CARE. UNLIKE BAD DEBT IN OTHER INDUSTRIES, HOSPITAL BAD DEBT IS COMPLICATED BY THE FACT THAT HOSPITALS FOLLOW THEIR CHARITABLE MISSION TO THE COMMUNITY AND TREAT EVERY PATIENT THAT COMES THROUGH THE EMERGENCY DEPARTMENT, REGARDLESS OF ABILITY TO PAY. PATIENTS WHO HAVE OUTSTANDING BILLS ARE NOT TURNED AWAY, UNLIKE OTHER INDUSTRIES. BAD DEBT IS FURTHER COMPLICATED BY THE AUDITING INDUSTRY'S STANDARDS ON REPORTING CHARITY CARE. MANY PATIENTS CANNOT OR DO NOT PROVIDE THE NECESSARY DOCUMENTATION REQUIRED TO BE DEEMED CHARITY CARE BY AUDITORS. AS A RESULT, ACCORDING TO THE CBO REPORT, ROUGHLY 40% OF BAD DEBT IS PENDING CHARITY CARE. (IN FY 2017, APPROXIMATELY 8% OF CMC'S BAD DEBT WAS SUBSEQUENTLY RECLASSIFIED TO CHARITY CARE.) THE CBO CONCLUDED THAT ITS FINDINGS ""SUPPORT THE VALIDITY OF THE USE OF UNCOMPENSATED CARE (BAD DEBT AND CHARITY CARE) AS A MEASURE OF COMMUNITY BENEFITS"" ASSUMING THE FINDINGS ARE GENERALIZED NATIONALLY. THE EXPERIENCE OF HOSPITALS NATIONWIDE REINFORCE THAT THEY ARE GENERALIZABLE. AS OUTLINED BY THE AHA, DESPITE THE HOSPITAL'S BEST EFFORTS AND DUE DILIGENCE, PATIENT BAD DEBT IS A PART OF THE CHARITABLE MISSION AND CHARITABLE PURPOSES. BAD DEBT REPRESENTS PART OF THE BURDEN HOSPITALS' SHOULDER IN SERVING ALL PATIENTS REGARDLESS OF RACE, COLOR, CREED, SEX, NATIONAL ORIGIN, RELIGION OR ABILITY TO PAY. IN ADDITION, THE HOSPITAL INVESTS SIGNIFICANT RESOURCES IN SYSTEMS AND STAFF TRAINING TO ASSIST PATIENTS THAT ARE IN NEED OF FINANCIAL ASSISTANCE. FOR FISCAL YEAR ENDED 6/30/2017, CMC'S COST OF PROVIDING PATIENT CARE FOR SERVICES ACCOUNTED FOR AS BAD DEBT WAS 374,974."

GEISINGER FOUNDED THE GEORGE F. GEISINGER MEMORIAL HOSPITAL IN MEMORY OF HER HUSBAND. FROM THE BEGINNING, THE NEW HOSPITAL WAS DESIGNED AS A COMPREHENSIVE HEALTHCARE INSTITUTION THAT WOULD OFFER SPECIALIZED MEDICAL CARE TO PEOPLE IN THE RURAL AREAS OF CENTRAL AND NORTHEASTERN PENNSYLVANIA. UNLIKE MOST HEALTHCARE SYSTEMS, WHICH EVOLVED WITH A HOSPITAL FOCUS, GEISINGER'S HISTORY AND TRADITION IS THAT OF A PHYSICIAN-LED AND PHYSICIAN-DRIVEN HEALTHCARE ORGANIZATION.

TODAY, GEISINGER IS REGARDED AS A NATIONAL MODEL OF HEALTHCARE DELIVERY CENTERED ON A SOPHISTICATED MULTISPECIALTY GROUP PRACTICE. SINCE THE 1970S, GEISINGER'S STRATEGY OF INTEGRATING PHYSICIANS AND HOSPITALS EXPANDED TO INCLUDE THE MANAGEMENT OF HEALTH AND THE FINANCING OF HEALTHCARE SERVICES THROUGH ITS WHOLLY CONTROLLED HEALTH MAINTENANCE ORGANIZATION, GEISINGER HEALTH PLAN.

THIS RULING REMOVED THE PREVIOUS REQUIREMENT OF REVENUE RULING 56-185, KNOWN AS THE ""CHARITY CARE STANDARD,"" THAT IN ORDER TO BE A CHARITABLE ORGANIZATION, A HOSPITAL HAD TO PROVIDE, TO THE EXTENT OF ITS FINANCIAL ABILITY, FREE OR REDUCED-COST CARE TO PATIENTS UNABLE TO PAY FOR THEIR CARE. THIS EARLIER RULING EMPHASIZED THAT A LOW LEVEL OF CHARITY CARE DID NOT MEAN THAT A HOSPITAL WAS CHARITABLE SINCE THAT LEVEL COULD REFLECT THE HOSPITAL'S FINANCIAL ABILITY TO PROVIDE SUCH CARE. REVENUE RULING 56-185 ALSO NOTED THAT PUBLICLY SUPPORTED COMMUNITY HOSPITALS WOULD NORMALLY QUALIFY AS CHARITABLE BECAUSE THEY SERVE THE ENTIRE COMMUNITY AND A LOW LEVEL OF CHARITY CARE WOULD NOT IMPACT A HOSPITAL'S CHARITABLE STATUS IF IT WAS DUE TO THE SURROUNDING COMMUNITY'S LACK OF CHARITABLE DEMANDS. UNDER THE COMMUNITY BENEFIT STANDARDS, DEVELOPED IN REVENUE RULING 69-545, HOSPITALS WERE JUDGED ON WHETHER THEY PROMOTE THE HEALTH OF A BROAD CLASS OF INDIVIDUALS IN THE COMMUNITY. THIS RULING INVOLVED A HOSPITAL THAT ONLY ADMITTED THOSE WHO COULD PAY FOR THE SERVICES EITHER BY THEMSELVES, THROUGH PRIVATE INSURANCE OR PUBLIC PROGRAMS SUCH AS MEDICARE. IN ADDITION, THE HOSPITAL OPERATED A FULL-TIME EMERGENCY ROOM THAT WAS OPEN TO EVERYONE. THE IRS RULED THAT THE HOSPITAL WAS CHARITABLE BECAUSE IT PROMOTED THE HEALTH OF PEOPLE IN ITS COMMUNITY. THE IRS REASONED THAT BECAUSE THE PROMOTION OF HEALTH WAS CHARITABLE PURPOSE ACCORDING TO THE GENERAL LAW OF CHARITY, IT FELL WITHIN THE ""GENERALLY ACCEPTED LEGAL SENSE"" OF THE TERM CHARITABLE, AS REQUIRED BY TREASURY REGULATION SECTION 1.501(C)(3)-1(D)(2). THE IRS RULED THAT THE PROMOTION OF HEALTH, LIKE RELIEF OF POVERTY AND THE ADVANCEMENT OF EDUCATION AND RELIGION, IS ONE OF THE PURPOSES OF THE GENERAL LAW OF CHARITY THAT IS DEEMED BENEFICIAL TO THE COMMUNITY AS A WHOLE EVEN THOUGH THE CLASS OF BENEFICIARIES ELIGIBLE TO RECEIVE A DIRECT BENEFIT FROM ITS ACTIVITIES DOES NOT INCLUDE ALL MEMBERS OF THE COMMUNITY, SUCH AS INDIGENT MEMBERS OF THE COMMUNITY, PROVIDED THAT THE CLASS IS NOT SO SMALL THAT ITS RELIEF IS NOT OF BENEFIT TO THE COMMUNITY. THE IRS CONCLUDED THAT THE HOSPITAL WAS ""PROMOTING THE HEALTH OF A CLASS OF PERSONS THAT IS BROAD ENOUGH TO BENEFIT THE COMMUNITY"" BECAUSE ITS EMERGENCY ROOM WAS OPEN TO ALL AND IT PROVIDED CARE TO THOSE WHO COULD PAY, WHETHER DIRECTLY OR THROUGH THIRD-PARTY REIMBURSEMENT. OTHER FACTORS THAT DEMONSTRATED COMMUNITY BENEFIT INCLUDED: SURPLUS FUNDS WERE USED TO IMPROVE PATIENT CARE, EXPAND FACILITIES AND ADVANCE MEDICAL TRAINING, EDUCATION AND RESEARCH; AND IT WAS CONTROLLED BY A BOARD OF DIRECTORS THAT CONSISTED OF INDEPENDENT CIVIC LEADERS. THE AMERICAN HOSPITAL ASSOCIATION (""AHA"") HOLDS THE POSITION THAT MEDICARE UNDERPAYMENTS (SHORTFALLS) AND BAD DEBT SHOULD BE REPORTED AS COMMUNITY BENEFIT ON FORM 990, SCHEDULE H, PART I, LINE 7. IN A LETTER TO THE IRS DATED AUGUST 21, 2007 RESPONDING TO A DRAFT OF THE NEW FORM 990 AND SCHEDULE H, THE AHA ARGUED THAT MEDICARE UNDERPAYMENTS (SHORTFALLS) IS COMMUNITY BENEFIT FOR THE FOLLOWING REASONS: -PROVIDING CARE FOR THE ELDERLY AND SERVING MEDICARE PATIENTS REMAINS AN ESSENTIAL PART OF THE COMMUNITY BENEFIT STANDARD. -MEDICARE, LIKE MEDICAID, DOES NOT PAY THE FULL COST OF CARE. RECENTLY, MEDICARE REIMBURSES ONLY 92 CENTS FOR EVERY DOLLAR HOSPITALS SPEND TO CARE FOR MEDICARE PATIENTS. -MANY MEDICARE PATIENTS, LIKE THEIR MEDICAID COUNTERPARTS, ARE POOR. MORE THAN 46% OF MEDICARE SPENDING IS FOR BENEFICIARIES WHOSE INCOME IS BELOW 200% OF THE FEDERAL POVERTY LEVEL. MANY ARE ALSO ELIGIBLE FOR MEDICAID, SO CALLED -DUAL ELIGIBLES"". PENNSYLVANIA REQUIRES NON-PROFIT HOSPITALS LIKE GLH TO PROVIDE A MINIMUM LEVEL OF COMMUNITY BENEFIT TO RETAIN EXEMPTION FROM STATE AND LOCAL TAXES. ACCORDING TO STATE GUIDANCE AND CASE LAW, THE UNREIMBURSED COST OF MEDICARE AND BAD DEBT IS CONSIDERED TO BE COMMUNITY BENEFIT FOR STATE TAX EXEMPTION PURPOSES. PART III, LINE 6 ONLY INCLUDES THOSE COSTS THAT ARE ALLOWED TO BE REPORTED ON GLH'S MEDICARE COST REPORT THAT ARE REQUIRED TO BE FILED WITH THE FEDERAL GOVERNMENT. GLH CONSIDERS THE TOTAL MEDICARE UNDERPAYMENTS (SHORTFALL) OF 5,631,756 SHOULD BE REPORTED AS COMMUNITY BENEFIT ON THE FORM 990, SCHEDULE H, PART I, LINE 7. ALONG WITH PROVIDING CARE TO MEDICAID PATIENTS AND PROVIDING FREE OR DISCOUNTED CARE TO OTHER LOW INCOME PATIENTS, THE IRS COMMUNITY BENEFIT STANDARD INCLUDES THE PROVISION OF CARE TO THE ELDERLY AND MEDICARE PATIENTS. LIKE MEDICAID, MEDICARE DOES NOT PAY THE FULL COST OF PROVIDING CARE TO THESE PATIENTS, FORCING GLH TO USE OTHER FUNDS TO COVER THE SHORTFALL. MEDICARE SHORTFALLS MUST BE ABSORBED BY GLH IN ORDER TO CONTINUE TREATING THE ELDERLY IN OUR COMMUNITY. GLH PROVIDES CARE REGARDLESS OF THE MEDICARE SHORTFALL AND IS THEREBY PROVIDING ACCESS TO MEDICAL SERVICES FOR THE ELDERLY AND RELIEVING THE FEDERAL GOVERNMENT OF THE BURDEN OF PAYING THE FULL COST FOR PROVIDING CARE TO MEDICARE PATIENTS. ABSENT THE MEDICARE PROGRAM, IT IS LIKELY THAT MEDICARE PATIENTS WOULD BE ELIGIBLE FOR CHARITY CARE OR OTHER NEEDS BASED GOVERNMENT PROGRAMS. THE AMOUNT EXPENDED TO COVER THE SHORTFALL IS MONEY NOT AVAILABLE FOR FINANCIAL ASSISTANCE AND OTHER COMMUNITY BENEFIT NEEDS. BOTH GLH AND THE AHA BELIEVE THAT PATIENT BAD DEBT BE REPORTED AS A COMMUNITY BENEFIT ON FORM 990, SCHEDULE H, PART I, LINE 7. LIKE MEDICARE UNDERPAYMENTS (SHORTFALLS), BAD DEBT SHOULD BE REPORTED AS COMMUNITY BENEFIT BECAUSE: -A SIGNIFICANT PORTION OF BAD DEBT IS ATTRIBUTABLE TO LOW-INCOME PATIENTS, WHO FOR MANY REASONS DECLINE TO COMPLETE THE FORMS REQUIRED TO ESTABLISH ELIGIBILITY UNDER GLH'S CHARITY CARE OR FINANCIAL ASSISTANCE POLICY (FAP). A 2006 CONGRESSIONAL BUDGET OFFICE (""CBO""), ""NONPROFIT HOSPITALS AND THE PROVISION OF COMMUNITY BENEFIT"", CITED TWO STUDIES INDICATING THAT ""THE GREAT MAJORITY OF BAD DEBT WAS ATTRIBUTABLE TO PATIENTS WITH INCOMES BELOW 200% OF THE FEDERAL POVERTY LINE."" -THE CBO REPORT ALSO NOTED THAT A SUBSTANTIAL PORTION OF THE BAD DEBT IS PENDING CHARITY CARE. UNLIKE BAD DEBT IN OTHER INDUSTRIES, HOSPITAL BAD DEBT IS COMPLICATED BY THE FACT THAT HOSPITALS FOLLOW THEIR CHARITABLE MISSION TO THE COMMUNITY AND TREAT EVERY PATIENT THAT COMES THROUGH THE EMERGENCY DEPARTMENT, REGARDLESS OF ABILITY TO PAY. PATIENT WHO HAVE OUTSTANDING BILLS ARE NOT TURNED AWAY, UNLIKE OTHER INDUSTRIES. BAD DEBT IS FURTHER COMPLICATED BY THE AUDITING INDUSTRY'S STANDARDS ON REPORTING CHARITY CARE. MANY PATIENTS CANNOT OR DO NOT PROVIDE THE NECESSARY DOCUMENTATION REQUIRED TO BE DEEMED CHARITY CARE BY AUDITORS. AS A RESULT, ACCORDING TO THE CBO REPORT, ROUGHLY 40% OF BAD DEBT IS PENDING CHARITY CARE. THE CBO CONCLUDED THAT ITS FINDINGS ""SUPPORT THE VALIDITY OF THE USE OF UNCOMPENSATED CARE (BAD DEBT AND CHARITY CARE) AS A MEASURE OF COMMUNITY BENEFITS"" ASSUMING THE FINDINGS ARE GENERALIZED NATIONALLY. THE EXPERIENCE OF HOSPITALS NATIONWIDE REINFORCE THAT THEY ARE GENERALIZABLE. AS OUTLINED BY THE AHA, DESPITE THE HOSPITAL'S BEST EFFORTS AND DUE DILIGENCE, PATIENT BAD DEBT IS A PART OF THE CHARITABLE MISSION AND CHARITABLE PURPOSES. BAD DEBT REPRESENTS PART OF THE BURDEN HOSPITALS' SHOULDER IN SERVING ALL PATIENTS REGARDLESS OF RACE, COLOR, CREED, SEX, NATIONAL ORIGIN, RELIGION OR ABILITY TO PAY. IN ADDITION, THE HOSPITAL INVESTS SIGNIFICANT RESOURCES IN SYSTEMS AND STAFF TRAINING TO ASSIST PATIENTS THAT ARE IN NEED OF FINANCIAL ASSISTANCE. GLH'S COST OF PROVIDING PATIENT CARE FOR SERVICES ACCOUNTED FOR AS BAD DEBT SHOULD BE CONSIDERED COMMUNITY BENEFIT."

THIS RURAL AREA CONTAINS SOME 145,000 PEOPLE SPREAD OVER MORE THAN 2,500 SQUARE MILES OF RUGGED TERRAIN LOCATED IN THE HEART OF THE APPALACHIAN MOUNTAINS IN CENTRAL PENNSYLVANIA. THE AVERAGE POPULATION DENSITY IS APPROXIMATELY 60 PERSONS PER SQUARE MILE. THE JUNIATA RIVER RUNS ALONG THE VERDANT VALLEYS AND SLICES THROUGH NARROW MOUNTAIN PASSES TO CONNECT OUR RESIDENTS TOGETHER, WHICH IS WHY OUR AREA IS CALLED THE JUNIATA VALLEY. TRANSPORTATION BARRIERS PLAY A MAJOR ROLE IN ACCESS TO HEALTHCARE IN OUR REGION. THESE NATURAL BARRIERS INCLUDE NARROW ROADS THAT EITHER MEANDER ALONG STREAMS AND CREEKS OR CROSSOVER THE MOUNTAIN RANGES THAT TRAVERSE OUR APPALACHIAN RIDGE REGION. THESE BARRIERS ARE EVEN MORE DAUNTING GIVEN HAZARDOUS WINTER DRIVING CONDITIONS CAUSED BY SNOW OR ICE COVERED ROADS. LOW-INCOME AND SENIOR CITIZENS ALSO FACE TRANSPORTATION ISSUES, AS THERE IS NO PUBLIC TRANSPORTATION IN OUR SERVICE AREA. SENIOR CITIZENS AND MEDICAID-ELIGIBLE PERSONS CAN USE THE ""CARS"" VAN SYSTEM FOR TRANSPORTATION TO REGULARLY SCHEDULED APPOINTMENTS WITH A WEEKS' NOTICE BUT NOT FOR URGENT OR EMERGENCY CARE. LOW INCOME CITIZENS HAVE NO ACCESS TO ANY PUBLIC TRANSPORTATION AT ALL IN OUR COMMUNITY. IF A TRIP TO A SPECIALIST IS REQUIRED THE MAJOR SUPPORT HOSPITALS ARE AT LEAST A ONE AND HALF HOUR DRIVE AWAY. THE POPULATION OF OUR TOTAL SERVICE AREA IS JUST ABOUT 145,000 PERSONS BASED ON 2010 US CENSUS DATA. MIFFLIN COUNTY HAS A RELATIVELY FLAT GROWTH RATE WITH A POPULATION CHANGE OF 0.4% FROM 2000 TO 2010. JUNIATA COUNTY, ON THE OTHER HAND, HAS SEEN SIGNIFICANT GROWTH WITH A 10.6% INCREASE IN POPULATION FROM 2000 TO 2010. IT IS BELIEVED THAT THIS GROWTH IS MOSTLY COMING FROM PEOPLE WHO WORK IN THE NEARBY HARRISBURG AREA WHO ARE LOOKING FOR A LOWER COST OF LIVING. WITH THE RECENT COMPLETION OF A NEW FOUR-LANE HIGHWAY NORTH OF HARRISBURG, THE COMMUTE TO HARRISBURG HAS BECOME MORE CONVENIENT RESULTING IN AN INCREASE IN JUNIATA COUNTY'S POPULATION AS PEOPLE MOVE FURTHER AWAY FROM THE URBAN AREAS TO LIVE IN THE COUNTRY. HIGHER GROWTH IN FULTON COUNTY IS EXPLAINED BY MIGRATION FROM MARYLAND AS PEOPLE TRY TO MOVE AWAY FROM HIGHER HOUSING COSTS IN MARYLAND. HUNTINGDON COUNTY'S GROWTH IS MOSTLY OCCURRING IN THE NORTHERN PORTION OF THE COUNTY THAT IS CLOSE ENOUGH TO STATE COLLEGE TO ALLOW RESIDENTS TO COMMUTE TO PENN STATE UNIVERSITY. THESE GROWTH RATES ARE STILL VERY LOW WHEN COMPARED TO A NATIONAL GROWTH RATE OF OVER 13%. OTHER IMPORTANT DEMOGRAPHIC STATISTICS ARE OUTLINED BELOW.

THE PENNSYLVANIA AVERAGE FOR THIS STATISTIC IS 15.4%. BOTH MIFFLIN AND JUNIATA COUNTIES HAVE HIGHER PERCENTAGES OF PERSONS LESS THAN 18 YEARS OF AGE, 23.1% AND 24.0% RESPECTIVELY, THAN THE PA AVERAGE OF 22.0%. BOTH OF THESE GROUPS REQUIRE MORE HEALTH CARE RESOURCES THAN OTHER AGE GROUPS IN OUR COMMUNITY. MIFFLIN COUNTY HAS 16.6% OF THE POPULATION WITH INCOME BELOW THE POVERTY LINE AND 28.1% OF CHILDREN UNDER 18 LIVING IN POVERTY. JUNIATA COUNTY HAS 11.1% OF THE POPULATION WITH INCOME BELOW THE POVERTY LINE, WHILE HUNTINGDON AND SNYDER COUNTIES ARE 13% AND 14% RESPECTIVELY.

Accounts receivable are reduced by an allowance for doubtful accounts. In evaluating the collectability of accounts receivable, the Organization analyzes their past history and identifies trends for each of its major payor sources of revenue to estimate the appropriate allowance for doubtful accounts and provision for bad debts. Management regularly reviews data about these major payor sources of revenue in evaluating the sufficiency of the allowance for doubtful accounts. For receivables associated with services provided to patients who have third-party coverage, the Organization analyzes contractually due amounts and provides an allowance for doubtful accounts, if necessary, for receivables associated with self-pay patients (which includes both patients without insurance and patients with deductible and copayment balances due for which third-party coverage exists for part of the bill). The Organization records a provision for bad debts in the period of service on the basis of its past experience, which indicates that many patients are unable or unwilling to pay the portion of their bill for which they are financially responsible. The difference between the standard rates (or the discounted rates if negotiated) and the amounts actually collected after all reasonable collection efforts have been exhausted is charged off against the allowance for doubtful accounts. The Organization's allowance for doubtful accounts decreased from 13.5% of gross accounts receivable at December 31, 2016 to 10.1% of gross accounts receivable at December 31, 2017. In addition, the Organization's bad debt write-offs increased approximately $250,000 from approximately $18,800,000 for fiscal year end 2016 to approximately $19,050,000 for fiscal year end 2017. The Organization has not changed its charity care or uninsured discount policies during the fiscal year 2017 and 2016.

The year-long process of assessing community health needs was facilitated by consultants contracted by the Chemung County Health Department from the S2AY Rural Health Network. Arnot Health, in partnership with this dual-county collaborative network, used the MAPP process (Mobilizing for Action through Planning and Partnership) to collect and analyze data from a variety of sources.

Also, input was gained from diverse community focus groups made of both Chemung and Steuben County residents. The focus group meetings were facilitated by S2AY, Chemung and Steuben County Health Departments, Arnot Health and other partnership members. The residents were engaged in discussions concerning their current health status and opinions on specific county-wide health challenges. Areas of disparity were assessed within each county. Findings from the Community Health Assessment (CHA) data and community focus groups identified some overlapping areas of public health concerns and disparities in Chemung and Steuben Counties.

BAD DEBT PROVISION: TO RECORD NET PATIENT SERVICE REVENUE AT AN ESTIMATED NET REALIZABLE AMOUNT, MANAGEMENT DETERMINES AN ALLOWANCE FOR DOUBTFUL ACCOUNTS BASED ON EXPECTED PAYMENT FROM PATIENTS AND OTHER PAYERS. ADDITIONS TO THE ALLOWANCE FOR DOUBTFUL ACCOUNTS ARE RECOGNIZED THROUGH THE BAD DEBT PROVISION, AS REPORTED IN THE ACCOMPANYING CONSOLIDATED STATEMENTS OF OPERATIONS. THE COST OF THE PATIENT SERVICES TO WHICH BAD DEBT RELATES IS ESTIMATED BY UTILIZING A COST ACCOUNTING SYSTEM, AND INCLUDES THE DIRECT AND INDIRECT COST OF PROVIDING MEDICAL AND PROFESSIONAL SERVICES. DURING THE REGISTRATION, BILLING AND COLLECTION PROCESS, A PATIENT'S ELIGIBILITY FOR CHARITY CARE OR THE MEDICAL CENTER'S COMPASSIONATE CARE PROGRAM IS DETERMINED. FOR PATIENTS WHO DO NOT QUALIFY FOR CHARITY CARE UNDER THE DOH STANDARDS AND WHO ARE DETERMINED TO BE ELIGIBLE FOR CARE IN THE FORM OF REDUCED PRICE MEDICAL SERVICES UNDER THE MEDICAL CENTER'S COMPASSIONATE CARE AND FINANCIAL AID POLICY, CARE GIVEN BUT NOT PAID FOR IS CLASSIFIED AS A REDUCTION IN NET PATIENT SERVICE REVENUE AS A COMPASSIONATE CARE ALLOWANCE. FOR PATIENTS WHO WERE DETERMINED BY THE MEDICAL CENTER TO HAVE THE ABILITY TO PAY BUT DID NOT, UNCOLLECTED AMOUNTS ARE CLASSIFIED AS BAD DEBT PROVISION. DISTINGUISHING BETWEEN BAD DEBT AND CHARITY CARE OR COMPASSIONATE CARE IS DIFFICULT, IN PART BECAUSE SERVICES ARE OFTEN RENDERED PRIOR TO THE FULL EVALUATION OF A PATIENT'S ABILITY TO PAY."
201823199349301952,221487322,"SCHEDULE H, PART III, SECTION B, QUESTION 8","MEDICARE COSTS WERE DERIVED FROM THE HOSPITAL'S COST ACCOUNTING SYSTEM. THE ORGANIZATION BELIEVES MEDICARE UNDERPAYMENTS AND BAD DEBT ARE CONSIDERED TO BE COMMUNITY BENEFIT AND ASSOCIATED COSTS ARE INCLUDABLE ON THE FORM 990, SCHEDULE H, PART I. THE ORGANIZATION FEELS THAT MEDICARE UNDERPAYMENTS (SHORTFALL) AND BAD DEBT ARE COMMUNITY BENEFIT AND ASSOCIATED COSTS ARE INCLUDABLE ON THE FORM 990, SCHEDULE H, PART I. AS OUTLINED MORE FULLY BELOW THE ORGANIZATION BELIEVES THAT THESE SERVICES AND RELATED COSTS PROMOTE THE HEALTH OF THE COMMUNITY AS A WHOLE AND ARE RENDERED IN CONJUNCTION WITH THE ORGANIZATION'S CHARITABLE TAX-EXEMPT PURPOSES AND MISSION IN PROVIDING MEDICALLY NECESSARY HEALTH CARE SERVICES TO ALL INDIVIDUALS IN A NON-DISCRIMINATORY MANNER WITHOUT REGARD TO RACE, COLOR, CREED, SEX, NATIONAL ORIGIN, RELIGION OR ABILITY TO PAY AND CONSISTENT WITH THE COMMUNITY BENEFIT STANDARD PROMULGATED BY THE IRS. THE COMMUNITY BENEFIT STANDARD IS THE CURRENT STANDARD FOR A HOSPITAL FOR RECOGNITION AS A TAX-EXEMPT AND CHARITABLE ORGANIZATION UNDER INTERNAL REVENUE CODE (""IRC"") 501(C)(3). THE MEDICAL CENTER IS RECOGNIZED AS A TAX-EXEMPT ENTITY AND CHARITABLE ORGANIZATION UNDER 501(C)(3) OF THE IRC. ALTHOUGH THERE IS NO DEFINITION IN THE TAX CODE FOR THE TERM ""CHARITABLE,"" A REGULATION PROMULGATED BY THE DEPARTMENT OF THE TREASURY PROVIDES SOME GUIDANCE AND STATES THAT ""[T]HE TERM CHARITABLE IS USED IN SECTION 501(C)(3) IN ITS GENERALLY ACCEPTED LEGAL SENSE,PROVIDES EXAMPLES OF CHARITABLE PURPOSES, INCLUDING: THE RELIEF OF THE POOR OR UNPRIVILEGED; THE PROMOTION OF SOCIAL WELFARE; AND THE ADVANCEMENT OF EDUCATION, RELIGION, AND SCIENCE. NOTE IT DOES NOT EXPLICITLY ADDRESS THE ACTIVITIES OF HOSPITALS. IN THE ABSENCE OF EXPLICIT STATUTORY OR REGULATORY REQUIREMENTS APPLYING THE TERM ""CHARITABLE"" TO HOSPITALS, IT HAS BEEN LEFT TO THE IRS TO DETERMINE THE CRITERIA HOSPITALS MUST MEET TO QUALIFY AS IRC 501(C)(3) CHARITABLE ORGANIZATIONS. THE ORIGINAL STANDARD WAS KNOWN AS THE CHARITY CARE STANDARD. THIS STANDARD WAS REPLACED BY THE IRS WITH THE COMMUNITY BENEFIT STANDARD WHICH IS THE CURRENT STANDARD. CHARITY CARE STANDARD IN 1956, THE IRS ISSUED REVENUE RULING 56-185, WHICH ADDRESSED THE REQUIREMENTS HOSPITALS NEEDED TO MEET IN ORDER TO QUALIFY FOR IRC 501(C)(3) STATUS. ONE OF THESE REQUIREMENTS IS KNOWN AS THE ""CHARITY CARE STANDARD."" UNDER THE STANDARD, A HOSPITAL HAD TO PROVIDE, TO THE EXTENT OF ITS FINANCIAL ABILITY, FREE OR REDUCED-COST CARE TO PATIENTS UNABLE TO PAY FOR IT. A HOSPITAL THAT EXPECTED FULL PAYMENT DID NOT, ACCORDING TO THE RULING, PROVIDE CHARITY CARE BASED ON THE FACT THAT SOME PATIENTS ULTIMATELY FAILED TO PAY. THE RULING EMPHASIZED THAT A LOW LEVEL OF CHARITY CARE DID NOT NECESSARILY MEAN THAT A HOSPITAL HAD FAILED TO MEET THE REQUIREMENT SINCE THAT LEVEL COULD REFLECT ITS FINANCIAL ABILITY TO PROVIDE SUCH CARE. THE RULING ALSO NOTED THAT PUBLICLY SUPPORTED COMMUNITY HOSPITALS WOULD NORMALLY QUALIFY AS CHARITABLE ORGANIZATIONS BECAUSE THEY SERVE THE ENTIRE COMMUNITY, AND A LOW LEVEL OF CHARITY CARE WOULD NOT AFFECT A HOSPITAL'S EXEMPT STATUS IF IT WAS DUE TO THE SURROUNDING COMMUNITY'S LACK OF CHARITABLE DEMANDS. COMMUNITY BENEFIT STANDARD IN 1969, THE IRS ISSUED REVENUE RULING 69-545, WHICH ""REMOVE[D]"" FROM REVENUE RULING 56-185 ""THE REQUIREMENTS RELATING TO CARING FOR PATIENTS WITHOUT CHARGE OR AT RATES BELOW COST."" UNDER THE STANDARD DEVELOPED IN REVENUE RULING 69-545, WHICH IS KNOWN AS THE ""COMMUNITY BENEFIT STANDARD,"" HOSPITALS ARE JUDGED ON WHETHER THEY PROMOTE THE HEALTH OF A BROAD CLASS OF INDIVIDUALS IN THE COMMUNITY. THE RULING INVOLVED A HOSPITAL THAT ONLY ADMITTED INDIVIDUALS WHO COULD PAY FOR THE SERVICES (BY THEMSELVES, PRIVATE INSURANCE, OR PUBLIC PROGRAMS SUCH AS MEDICARE), BUT OPERATED A FULL-TIME EMERGENCY ROOM THAT WAS OPEN TO EVERYONE. THE IRS RULED THAT THE HOSPITAL QUALIFIED AS A CHARITABLE ORGANIZATION BECAUSE IT PROMOTED THE HEALTH OF PEOPLE IN ITS COMMUNITY. THE IRS REASONED THAT BECAUSE THE PROMOTION OF HEALTH WAS A CHARITABLE PURPOSE ACCORDING TO THE GENERAL LAW OF CHARITY, IT FELL WITHIN THE ""GENERALLY ACCEPTED LEGAL SENSE"" OF THE TERM ""CHARITABLE,"" AS REQUIRED BY TREASURY REG. 1.501(C)(3)-1(D)(2). THE IRS RULING STATED THAT THE PROMOTION OF HEALTH, LIKE THE RELIEF OF POVERTY AND THE ADVANCEMENT OF EDUCATION AND RELIGION, IS ONE OF THE PURPOSES IN THE GENERAL LAW OF CHARITY THAT IS DEEMED BENEFICIAL TO THE COMMUNITY AS A WHOLE EVEN THOUGH THE CLASS OF BENEFICIARIES ELIGIBLE TO RECEIVE A DIRECT BENEFIT FROM ITS ACTIVITIES DOES NOT INCLUDE ALL MEMBERS OF THE COMMUNITY, SUCH AS INDIGENT MEMBERS OF THE COMMUNITY, PROVIDED THAT THE CLASS IS NOT SO SMALL THAT ITS RELIEF IS NOT OF BENEFIT TO THE COMMUNITY. THE IRS CONCLUDED THAT THE HOSPITAL WAS ""PROMOTING THE HEALTH OF A CLASS OF PERSONS THAT IS BROAD ENOUGH TO BENEFIT THE COMMUNITY"" BECAUSE ITS EMERGENCY ROOM WAS OPEN TO ALL AND IT PROVIDED CARE TO EVERYONE WHO COULD PAY, WHETHER DIRECTLY OR THROUGH THIRD-PARTY REIMBURSEMENT. OTHER CHARACTERISTICS OF THE HOSPITAL THAT THE IRS HIGHLIGHTED INCLUDED THE FOLLOWING: ITS SURPLUS FUNDS WERE USED TO IMPROVE PATIENT CARE, EXPAND HOSPITAL FACILITIES, AND ADVANCE MEDICAL TRAINING, EDUCATION, AND RESEARCH; IT WAS CONTROLLED BY A BOARD OF TRUSTEES THAT CONSISTED OF INDEPENDENT CIVIC LEADERS; AND HOSPITAL MEDICAL STAFF PRIVILEGES WERE AVAILABLE TO ALL QUALIFIED PHYSICIANS. MEDICARE UNDERPAYMENTS AND BAD DEBT ARE COMMUNITY BENEFIT AND ASSOCIATED COSTS ARE INCLUDABLE ON THE FORM 990, SCHEDULE H, PART I. THE AMERICAN HOSPITAL ASSOCIATION (""AHA"") HOLDS THE POSITION THAT MEDICARE UNDERPAYMENTS (OR, ""SHORTFALLS"") AND BAD DEBT ARE COMMUNITY BENEFIT AND THUS INCLUDABLE ON THE FORM 990, SCHEDULE H, PART I. THE MEDICAL CENTER AGREES WITH THE AHA'S POSITION. AS OUTLINED IN THE AHA LETTER TO THE IRS DATED AUGUST 21, 2007 WITH RESPECT TO THE FIRST PUBLISHED DRAFT OF THE NEW FORM 990 AND SCHEDULE H, THE AHA STATED THAT THE IRS SHOULD INCORPORATE THE FULL VALUE OF THE COMMUNITY BENEFIT PROVIDED BY HOSPITALS BY COUNTING MEDICARE UNDERPAYMENTS (SHORTFALL) AS QUANTIFIABLE COMMUNITY BENEFIT FOR THE FOLLOWING REASONS: - THE PROVISION OF CARE FOR THE ELDERLY AND SERVING MEDICARE PATIENTS IS AN ESSENTIAL PART OF THE COMMUNITY BENEFIT STANDARD. - MEDICARE, LIKE MEDICAID, DOES NOT FUND THE FULL COST OF CARE. MEDICARE'S REIMBURSEMENT TO HOSPITALS EQUATES TO ONLY 92 CENTS FOR EVERY DOLLAR SPENT BY THE HOSPITALS ON CARE OF MEDICARE PATIENTS. THE MEDICARE PAYMENT ADVISORY COMMISSION (""MEDPAC"") IN ITS MARCH 2007 REPORT TO CONGRESS CAUTIONED THAT UNDERPAYMENT WILL WORSEN. - MANY MEDICARE BENEFICIARIES, LIKE THEIR MEDICAID COUNTERPARTS, ARE POOR. MORE THAN 46 PERCENT OF MEDICARE SPENDING IS FOR BENEFICIARIES WHOSE INCOME IS BELOW 200 PERCENT OF THE FEDERAL POVERTY LEVEL. MANY OF THOSE MEDICARE BENEFICIARIES ARE ALSO ELIGIBLE FOR MEDICAID, THE SO CALLED ELIGIBLES."" THERE IS A VERY COMPELLING PUBLIC POLICY REASON TO TREAT MEDICARE AND MEDICAID UNDERPAYMENTS SIMILARLY FOR PURPOSES OF A HOSPITAL'S COMMUNITY BENEFIT AND INCLUDE THESE COSTS ON FORM 990, SCHEDULE H, PART I. MEDICARE UNDERPAYMENT MUST BE SHOULDERED BY THE HOSPITAL IN ORDER TO CONTINUE TREATING THE COMMUNITY'S ELDERLY AND POOR. THESE UNDERPAYMENTS REPRESENT A REAL COST OF SERVING THE COMMUNITY AND SHOULD COUNT AS A QUANTIFIABLE COMMUNITY BENEFIT. BOTH THE AHA AND THE MEDICAL CENTER ALSO REGARD PATIENT BAD DEBT AS A COMMUNITY BENEFIT AND THUS INCLUDABLE ON THE FORM 990, SCHEDULE H, PART I. SIMILAR TO MEDICARE UNDERPAYMENT (SHORTFALLS), THERE ALSO ARE COMPELLING REASONS THAT PATIENT BAD DEBT SHOULD BE COUNTED AS QUANTIFIABLE COMMUNITY BENEFIT AS NOTED BELOW: - A SIGNIFICANT MAJORITY OF BAD DEBT IS ATTRIBUTABLE TO LOW-INCOME PATIENTS, WHO, FOR MANY REASONS, DECLINE TO COMPLETE THE FORMS REQUIRED TO ESTABLISH ELIGIBILITY FOR HOSPITALS' CHARITY CARE OR FINANCIAL ASSISTANCE PROGRAMS. A 2006 CONGRESSIONAL BUDGET OFFICE (""CBO"") REPORT, NON-PROFIT HOSPITALS AND THE PROVISION OF COMMUNITY BENEFITS, CITED TWO STUDIES INDICATING THAT ""THE GREAT MAJORITY OF BAD DEBT WAS ATTRIBUTABLE TO PATIENTS WITH INCOMES BELOW 200% OF THE FEDERAL POVERTY LINE."" - THE REPORT ALSO NOTED THAT A SUBSTANTIAL PORTION OF BAD DEBT IS ACTUALLY PENDING CHARITY CARE. UNLIKE BAD DEBT IN OTHER INDUSTRIES, HOSPITAL BAD DEBT IS COMPLICATED BY THE FACT THAT HOSPITALS FOLLOW THEIR MISSION TO THE COMMUNITY AND TREAT EVERY PATIENT THAT COMES THROUGH THEIR EMERGENCY DEPARTMENTS, REGARDLESS OF ABILITY TO PAY. PATIENTS WHO HAVE OUTSTANDING BILLS ARE NOT TURNED AWAY, IN SHARP CONTRAST TO OTHER INDUSTRIES. BAD DEBT IS FURTHER COMPLICATED BY THE AUDITING INDUSTRY'S STANDARDS ON REPORTING CHARITY CARE. MANY PATIENTS CANNOT OR DO NOT PROVIDE THE NECESSARY, EXTENSIVE DOCUMENTATION REQUIRED TO BE DEEMED CHARITY CARE BY AUDITORS. AS A RESULT, ROUGHLY 40% OF BAD DEBT IS PENDING CHARITY CARE. - THE CBO CONCLUDED THAT ITS FINDINGS ""SUPPORT THE VALIDITY OF THE USE OF UNCOMPENSATED CARE (BAD DEBT AND CHARITY CARE) AS A MEASURE OF"
201823199349301952,221487322,"SCHEDULE H, PART III, SECTION B, QUESTION 9B","ACCOUNTS CONSIDERED TO BE CHARITY CARE ARE NOT INCLUDED IN THE BAD DEBT EXPENSE BUT, RATHER, ACCOUNTED FOR AS AN ALLOWANCE. IT IS THE POLICY OF HOLY NAME MEDICAL CENTER AND ITS SUBSIDIARIES TO TREAT ALL PATIENTS EQUALLY REGARDLESS OF INSURANCE AND THEIR ABILITY TO PAY. ADDITIONALLY, HNMC IS COMMITTED TO BILL PATIENTS AND INSURANCE CARRIERS IN A MANNER THAT IS UNDERSTANDABLE, PROFESSIONAL, COMPASSIONATE AND IN COMPLIANCE WITH ALL STATE, LOCAL AND FEDERAL RULES INCLUDING INTERNAL REVENUE CODE SECTION 501(R). IT IS THE INTENTION THAT THE BILLING AND COLLECTION POLICY BE CONSISTENT WITH HNMC'S FINANCIAL ASSISTANCE POLICY (""FAP"") AND ANY INCONSISTENCIES SHALL BE GUIDED BY THE FAP AND APPLIED IN A MANNER THAT BENEFITS THE PATIENT. HNMC WILL FOLLOW THE FOLLOWING PROCEDURES WHEN PURSUING BILLING AND COLLECTION ACTIONS: (1) PATIENTS SHALL BE REGISTERED IN THE HOSPITAL'S INFORMATION SYSTEM IN A MANNER THAT ENSURES THE CAPTURE OF THE INFORMATION NECESSARY TO EFFECTIVELY PROVIDE MEDICALLY NECESSARY CARE AND TO PROFESSIONALLY BILL FOR SERVICES RENDERED; (2) AFTER SERVICES ARE RENDERED THE PATIENTS OR GUARANTOR'S INSURANCE (IF ANY) SHALL BE BILLED. IF THE PATIENT HAS NO INSURANCE AND WAS REGISTERED SELF-PAY THE BILL FOR SERVICES WILL BE ADJUSTED IN ACCORDANCE WITH THE HOSPITAL'S FAP; (3) THE HOSPITAL WILL MAKE REASONABLE EFFORTS TO COLLECT FROM AN INSURANCE CARRIER PRIOR TO BILLING THE PATIENT FOR SERVICES RENDERED. IF AFTER REASONABLE EFFORTS ARE MADE TO COLLECT FROM THE INSURANCE CARRIER THE HOSPITAL SHALL SEEK ASSISTANCE FROM THE PATIENT TO CONTACT THE INSURANCE CARRIER AND RESOLVE THE OUTSTANDING CLAIM. IF THESE EFFORTS ARE NOT SUCCESSFUL THEN THE ACCOUNT MAY BE CHANGED TO A SELF-PAY ACCOUNT; (4) AFTER THE ACCOUNT, OR ANY PORTION OF SUCH ACCOUNT, IS DEEMED SELF-PAY THE HOSPITAL, OR IT'S DESIGNATED AGENT, WILL BILL THE PATIENT OR GUARANTOR FOR THE REMAINING BALANCE ON THE ACCOUNT; (5) ACCOUNTS THAT ARE DEEMED SELF-PAY WILL RECEIVE UP TO FOUR STATEMENTS AND/OR NOTICES ASKING THAT THE ACCOUNT BALANCE BE PAID; (6) AFTER EXHAUSTING REASONABLE EFFORTS OVER A PERIOD OF UP TO 120 DAYS TO COLLECT A SELF-PAY BALANCE, THE HOSPITAL MAY REFER THE ACCOUNT TO A COLLECTION AGENCY. SUCH REFERRAL SHALL NOT BE DEEMED TO BE AN EXTRAORDINARY COLLECTION ACTION (""ECA""); (7) AN ACCOUNT WITH A COLLECTION AGENCY SHALL GENERALLY BE PURSUED UP TO 180 DAYS UNLESS, AFTER CONSULTING WITH THE HOSPITAL, IT IS DETERMINED TO MAINTAIN AN ACCOUNT BEYOND THAT TIMEFRAME. IF IT IS DETERMINED BY THE HOSPITAL'S PATIENT FINANCIAL SERVICES DEPARTMENT THAT THE ACCOUNT REQUIRES AN ECA, AND SUCH ACCOUNT MEETS THE REQUIREMENTS OF INTERNAL REVENUE CODE SECTION 501(R), INCLUDING BUT NOT LIMITED TO WAITING A MINIMUM OF 120 DAYS AFTER THE FIRST POST DISCHARGE BILL TO COMMENCE ECA ACTIVITIES, THE AGENCY SHALL NOTIFY THE PATIENT IN WRITING A MINIMUM OF 30 DAYS PRIOR TO COMMENCING ECA. SUCH NOTIFICATION SHALL INCLUDE A COPY OF THE HOSPITALS PLAIN LANGUAGE SUMMARY OF THE FAP ALONG WITH A STATEMENT AS TO WHICH ECA'S THE AGENCY MAY BE TAKING. IF WITHIN THE 30 DAY NOTICE PERIOD THE PATIENT REQUESTS FINANCIAL ASSISTANCE, AND THE ACCOUNT IS NOT OLDER THAN 240 DAYS FROM THE FIRST POST DISCHARGE BILL, THEN THE PATIENT SHALL BE GIVEN TIME TO APPLY FOR FINANCIAL ASSISTANCE BEFORE ANY ECAS MAY BE INITIATED. IN THE EVENT THAT AN ECA HAS BEEN INITIATED AND THE ACCOUNT IS NOT OLDER THAN 240 DAYS FROM THE FIRST POST DISCHARGE BILLING DATE AND THE PATIENT REQUESTS FINANCIAL ASSISTANCE THEN THE ECA WILL BE SUSPENDED TO ALLOW FOR THE PATIENT TO APPLY FOR FINANCIAL ASSISTANCE. THE FIRST POST DISCHARGE BILL SHALL BE THE FIRST BILL A PATIENT RECEIVES FOR SERVICES REGARDLESS IF SERVICES ARE ONGOING. ECA'S THAT THE HOSPITAL OR ITS AGENTS MAY TAKE UPON THE EXPIRATION OF THE NOTIFICATION PERIOD INCLUDE: - REPORTING ADVERSE INFORMATION TO A CREDIT REPORTING AGENCY; - PLACING A LIEN ON PROPERTY; - FORECLOSING ON PROPERTY; - ATTACHING OR SEIZING A BANK ACCOUNT OR PROPERTY; - GARNISHING WAGES; AND - DEFERRING, DENYING OR REQUIRING PAYMENT FOR NON-EMERGENCY MEDICALLY NECESSARY CARE WHEN THERE IS NON-PAYMENT OF PREVIOUSLY PROVIDED CARE."

A COMPLETE NEEDS ASSESSMENT IS PERFORMED EVERY THREE YEARS AND IS MADE WIDELY AVAILABLE ON THE ORGANIZATIONS WEBSITE. IN ADDITION TO THE CHNA PROCESS DESCRIBED ABOVE AND IN SCHEDULE H, SECTION B, QUESTIONS 1-12 AND SECTION C, HNMC UTILIZES A VARIETY OF MEANS BY WHICH IT IDENTIFIES AND ANALYZES PATIENT CARE NEEDS.

HNMC'S SECONDARY SERVICE AREA (""SSA"") INCLUDES 17 MUNICIPALITIES IN BERGEN COUNTY AND 2 MUNICIPALITIES IN HUDSON COUNTY. TOGETHER, THE PSA AND SSA ACCOUNT FOR APPROXIMATELY 80 PERCENT OF THE MEDICAL CENTER'S ADMISSION VOLUME. AS THE SOLE CATHOLIC HOSPITAL IN AN AREA THAT IS ESTIMATED AT MORE THAN 50% ROMAN CATHOLIC, HNMC ALSO DRAWS FROM TOWNS WELL BEYOND BOTH THE PSA AND SSA. THE MAJORITY OF PSA TOWNS HAVE AN AVERAGE POPULATION OF 27,500, AND ARE LOCATED IN THE SOUTHERN HALF OF BERGEN COUNTY. OVERALL, THE SERVICE AREA IS 44% HISPANIC, ALTHOUGH THE PROPORTIONS DIFFER MARKEDLY BETWEEN BERGEN AND HUDSON: 76% OF THE RESIDENTS OF BERGEN PSA TOWNS ARE NOT HISPANIC; WHILE THE FOUR HUDSON COUNTY TOWNS TOGETHER COUNT 76% OF THEIR RESIDENTS AS HISPANIC. THE RACIAL MIX OF THE PSA IS APPROXIMATELY 60% WHITE, 22% ASIAN, 10% BLACK, AND 8% OTHER, INCLUDING MULTI-RACIAL PERSONS. CERTAIN TOWNS IN THE REGION ARE HEAVILY KOREAN; KOREAN/ASIAN PRESENCE IS MUCH LESS PRONOUNCED IN THE FOUR HUDSON COUNTY TOWNS. THE BROAD AGE MAKE-UP OF THE PRIMARY SERVICE AREA INCLUDES 23% AGED UP TO 19; 50% AGED 20-54; AND 27% AGED 55 AND OLDER. THE LAST CATEGORY IS PROJECTED TO SEE THE MOST SIGNIFICANT GROWTH DURING THE NEXT FIFTEEN YEARS. WITH THE EXCEPTION OF TWO HUDSON COUNTY TOWNS, ALL SSA ZIP CODES ARE LOCATED THROUGHOUT BERGEN COUNTY. THE TOWNS IN THIS SERVICE AREA ARE MUCH SMALLER THAN THOSE OF THE PSA, AVERAGING ONLY 14,000 RESIDENTS EACH. IN STARK CONTRAST TO THE LARGELY HISPANIC HUDSON COUNTY PSA TOWNS, THE TWO HUDSON SSA TOWNS ARE ONLY 20% HISPANIC. THE OVERALL RACIAL MIX OF THE SERVICE AREA IS 76% WHITE, 13% ASIAN, 4% BLACK, AND 7% OTHER, INCLUDING MULTI-RACIAL PERSONS. THE OVERALL KOREAN PRESENCE IS SIGNIFICANT, BUT ONLY HALF THAT SEEN IN THE PRIMARY SERVICE AREA. THE AREA'S AGE MIX IS SIMILAR TO THE PSA, WITH 23% AGED UP TO 19; 51% AGED 20-54; AND 26% AGED 55 AND OLDER. THE MEDICAL CENTER'S SERVICE AREA IS PRIMARILY SUBURBAN, WITH MANY RESIDENTS WORKING OUTSIDE BERGEN COUNTY IN PLACES SUCH AS NEW YORK CITY. HOWEVER, THERE ARE LARGE EMPLOYERS IN THE SERVICE AREA, E.G., OTHER HOSPITALS, A LARGE SPORTS CHAIN, A LARGE COMMUNICATIONS FIRM, A LARGE PHARMACEUTICAL FIRM, AND A LARGE COMMERCIAL LABORATORY. RESIDENTS OF HNMC'S SERVICE AREA ARE ALSO SERVED BY ANOTHER COMMUNITY HOSPITAL AND A TERTIARY CARE FACILITY WITH TRAUMA SERVICES. HNMC'S PSA COVERS A MAJORITY OF THE TOWNS SERVICED BY THE OTHER COMMUNITY HOSPITAL, WHEREAS THE TERTIARY CARE FACILITY'S PRIMARY SERVICE AREA ALSO INCLUDES MANY TOWNS TO THE WEST THAT ARE NOT PART OF HNMC'S SERVICE AREA. GIVEN THE NUMBER OF SERVICE AREA RESIDENTS WHO WORK IN NEARBY NEW YORK CITY, IT IS NOT SURPRISING THAT A SMALL PORTION OF THESE RESIDENTS ALSO RECEIVE THEIR HEALTHCARE IN MANHATTAN. WHILE THE SERVICE AREA IS PREDOMINANTLY NON-HISPANIC CAUCASIAN, BOTH HISPANICS (OF ANY RACE) AND ASIAN POPULATIONS (PRINCIPALLY KOREAN) ARE THE FASTEST GROWING GROUPS. IN RESPONSE, THE MEDICAL CENTER HAS PROGRAMS ADDRESSING THESE GROUPS' NEEDS, AND PHYSICIANS AND NURSES FLUENT IN THE APPLICABLE LANGUAGES. IN 2008, APPROXIMATELY 75 KOREAN PHYSICIANS JOINED THE MEDICAL STAFF, ADDING TO THE NEED FOR STAFF AND SERVICES TO MEET THIS GROWING SEGMENT OF THE COMMUNITY. IN 2014, THE MEDICAL CENTER EXPANDED ITS KOREAN MEDICAL PROGRAM TO INCLUDE A FOCUS ON CHINESE AND FILIPINO RESIDENTS AS WELL, RENAMING THE SERVICE ""ASIAN HEALTH SERVICES."""

HNMC'S EMERGENCY DEPARTMENT (""ED"") IS OPEN 24 HOURS A DAY, EVERY DAY OF THE YEAR. ALTHOUGH THE ED GENERALLY IS ABLE TO COVER ITS COSTS, IT PROVIDES A SIGNIFICANT AMOUNT OF UNCOMPENSATED CARE AND IS A WELL-USED RESOURCE FOR MANY WITHOUT INSURANCE WHO RELY ON IT FOR CARE. OTHER SERVICES, SUCH AS CLINICS, DO NOT COVER THEIR COSTS, AND HNMC ABSORBS THE ADDITIONAL EXPENSE.

HNMC'S STATE-OF-THE-ART FACILITIES MATCH THE HIGHEST STANDARDS FOR CARRYING OUT TODAY'S MOST PROMISING CLINICAL RESEARCH. THE INSTITUTE PROVIDES SPONSORS WITH RESEARCH SUPPORT THROUGHOUT ALL THE STAGES OF THEIR CLINICAL TRIALS. SINCE ITS INCEPTION, HNMC HAS BEEN ACTIVELY INVOLVED IN HEALTH PROFESSIONS EDUCATION, TRAINING, EDUCATING AND MENTORING HEALTHCARE PROFESSIONALS. THE HOLY NAME SCHOOL OF NURSING WAS FOUNDED IN 1925, WITH A DEDICATION TO FOSTERING THE WELL-BEING AND DIGNITY OF ALL INDIVIDUALS, SICK OR WELL. THE REGISTERED NURSE (""RN"") PROGRAM IS A HIGHLY COMPETITIVE REGISTERED NURSE DIPLOMA PROGRAM, AND IS ACCREDITED WITH THE NEW JERSEY BOARD OF NURSING AND THE NATIONAL LEAGUE FOR NURSING ACCREDITING COMMISSION. IN 1972 THE SCHOOL EXPANDED TO INCLUDE A PRACTICAL NURSE (""LPN"") PROGRAM AS WELL, WHICH IS A 12-MONTH PRACTICAL NURSE DIPLOMA PROGRAM ALSO ACCREDITED WITH THE NEW JERSEY BOARD OF NURSING. BOTH PROGRAMS CONTINUE TO SUPPLY THE REGION WITH HIGHLY SKILLED NURSES OF MANY ETHNICITIES AND AGE GROUPS. IN ADDITION TO ITS OWN NURSING SCHOOL, HNMC PROVIDES, FREE OF CHARGE, BOTH A TRAINING GROUND AND MENTORING FOR STUDENTS FROM VARIOUS HEALTH ACADEMIC PROGRAMS OF SEVERAL COLLEGES AND UNIVERSITIES. A VARIETY OF ""EXTERNSHIPS"" ARE ALSO OFFERED WITHOUT CHARGE. CAREER DAYS ARE ALSO HELD ON CAMPUS, AND THE MEDICAL CENTER PARTICIPATES IN HEALTH CAREER DAYS THROUGHOUT VARIOUS SCHOOLS AND COMMUNITIES.

THESE ACTIVITIES ARE DESIGNED TO PROMOTE THE HEALTH OF THE BROADER COMMUNITY. WE CONTINUE TO BUILD ON OUR LONG AND STRONG RECORD OF COLLABORATION WITH COMMUNITY GROUPS, BUSINESSES, ACADEMIC INSTITUTIONS AND GOVERNMENTAL AND NON-GOVERNMENTAL ORGANIZATIONS, WITH THE GOAL OF IMPROVING HEALTH OUTCOMES AND REDUCING HEALTH DISPARITIES FOR CHILDREN AND THEIR FAMILIES. ADDITIONALLY, SIGNIFICANT RESOURCES WERE ALLOCATED IN 2017 TO SUPPORT EFFORTS TO ENGAGE COMMUNITY MEMBERS IN ADVOCATING FOR ACCESS TO HEALTH CARE AS WELL AS PROVIDING EDUCATIONAL SESSIONS FOR BOTH POLICYMAKERS AND ADVOCATES ON CHILD HEALTH ISSUES OF IMPORTANCE. IMPROVING THE HEALTH OF THE COMMUNITY THROUGH ENVIRONMENTAL EFFORTS WAS ALSO A PRIORITY, INCLUDING LONG-STANDING RECYCLING AND RETRO COMMISSIONING EFFORTS. FINALLY, THE HOSPITAL CONTRIBUTED SUBSTANTIAL RESOURCES TO PROGRAMS, SUCH AS OUR HIRE LOCAL PROGRAM, THAT PROVIDE A PIPELINE FOR AT-RISK HIGH SCHOOL STUDENTS, AND UNDERSERVED COMMUNITY MEMBERS TO PURSUE HEALTHCARE SPECIFIC CAREERS. SELECTED COMMUNITY BUILDING ACTIVITIES ARE HIGHLIGHTED BELOW. CHILDRENS COLORADOS GOVERNMENT AFFAIRS TEAM HAS ENGAGED IN ACTIVITIES TO HELP IMPROVE THE LIVES OF CHILDREN AND FAMILIES ACROSS LEGISLATIVE AND REGULATORY POLICIES AT THE STATE AND NATIONAL LEVEL. BY TRACKING AND ENSURING SUCCESSFUL IMPLEMENTATION OF BILLS, PARTNERING WITH HEALTHCARE PROFESSIONALS AND FAMILIES TO PROVIDE PUBLIC TESTIMONY TO LAWMAKERS, RECRUITING AND TRAINING CHILD HEALTH ADVOCATES AND PARTNERING WITH COALITIONS AND ORGANIZATIONS ACROSS THE STATE, THE GOVERNMENT AFFAIRS TEAM SERVES AS A KEY LEADER IN CHILD HEALTH POLICY AND ADVOCACY IN COLORADO. IN 2017, CHILDRENS COLORADO WORKED ON 68 BILLS AND DURING THIS TIME, NEARLY 700 ADVOCATES WERE TRAINED THROUGH A RESIDENCY ADVOCACY TRAINING, SPEAK UP FOR KIDS, PROVIDER TRAINING, OR ADVOCACY 101 TRAINING. ENVIRONMENTAL IMPROVEMENTS: IN 2017, THE TEAM WORKED ON COLORADO HOUSE BILL 17-1306 ADDRESSING LEAD POISONING PREVENTION. RECENTLY, SEVEN OF COLORADO'S 178 SCHOOL DISTRICTS TESTED THEIR WATER FOR LEAD, AND IN THESE DISTRICTS, 77 SCHOOLS WERE FOUND TO HAVE LEAD IN THEIR WATER. CHILDREN'S COLORADO WAS PROUD TO PARTNER WITH ENVIRONMENTAL, EDUCATIONAL AND PUBLIC HEALTH GROUPS TO SUPPORT A BILL THAT SUPPORTS SCHOOLS TO TEST FOR LEAD IN THEIR WATER. THIS LEGISLATION GIVES SCHOOLS THE OPPORTUNITY, WITHOUT CREATING UNFUNDED MANDATES, TO APPLY FOR GRANTS TO TEST FOR LEAD IN THEIR WATER. FUNDING ALREADY EXISTS AT THE COLORADO DEPARTMENT OF PUBLIC HEALTH AND ENVIRONMENT TO SUPPORT THESE GRANTS, AND WOULD PRIORITIZE THOSE AT THE HIGHEST RISK FOR LEAD, SUCH AS OUR OLDEST PUBLIC ELEMENTARY SCHOOLS WITH AGING PIPES AND INFRASTRUCTURE. IF SCHOOLS REQUIRE REMEDIATION, THERE MAY BE FUNDS ACCESSED THROUGH THE EXISTING, BUILDING EXCELLENT SCHOOLS TODAY (BEST) PROGRAM, WHICH SUPPORTS SCHOOL CAPITAL CONSTRUCTION PROJECTS. COMMUNITY HEALTH IMPROVEMENT: SENATE BILL 17-68, ENHANCING THE SCHOOL HEALTH PROFESSIONAL GRANT PROGRAMS WAS PASSED IN 2017. INVESTING IN SCHOOL HEALTH PROFESSIONALS CAN CONTRIBUTE TO IMPROVED GRADUATION RATES AND BETTER HEALTH OUTCOMES BY GETTING MORE SCHOOL COUNSELORS, NURSES, PSYCHOLOGISTS, AND SOCIAL WORKERS INTO THE SETTING WHERE KIDS SPEND MUCH OF THEIR TIME. CHILDREN'S COLORADO SUPPORTED LEGISLATION TO EXPAND THE SCHOOL HEALTH PROFESSIONAL AND COUNSELOR CORPS GRANT PROGRAMS INTO ELEMENTARY SCHOOLS. ADDITIONALLY, WE SUCCESSFULLY LED THE COALITION TO SUPPORT AN ADDITIONAL $9 MILLION INVESTMENT OF MARIJUANA TAX CASH FUNDS INTO THE SCHOOL HEALTH PROFESSIONAL GRANT PROGRAM SO THAT MORE SCHOOLS WILL HAVE THE OPPORTUNITY TO HIRE THESE PROFESSIONALS TO IMPLEMENT EVIDENCE-BASED SUBSTANCE USE AND MENTAL HEALTH PROGRAMMING. COALITION BUILDING: THE GOVERNMENT AFFAIRS TEAM LEAD TWO COALITIONS FOCUSED IN MENTAL HEALTH AND MARIJUANA PUBLIC HEALTH AND SAFETY: 1. EARLY CHILDHOOD MENTAL HEALTH POLICY COALITION A GROUP OF 10 REPRESENTATIVES FROM EARLY CHILDHOOD ADVOCACY ORGANIZATIONS (RANGING FROM STATE AND COUNTY AGENCY PARTNERS TO PRIVATE PHILANTHROPIC FOUNDATIONS AND POLICY ADVOCACY GROUPS) THAT WORK TO ADVANCE EARLY CHILDHOOD MENTAL HEALTH POLICY IN THE STATE, 2. MARIJUANA PUBLIC HEALTH AND SAFETY NETWORK A NETWORK OF PUBLIC HEALTH ADVOCATES THAT COORDINATES STATE-LEVEL POLICY WORK TO ELIMINATE CHILD AND YOUTH EXPOSURE TO AND CONSUMPTION OF MARIJUANA THAT CAN HARM HEALTH AND SAFETY. ADDITIONALLY, THE TEAM ACTIVELY PARTICIPATES IN 10 STATE-WIDE COALITIONS ADDRESSING ISSUES CRITICAL TO THE HEALTH OF CHILDREN. EXAMPLES INCLUDE: COLORADO TOBACCO-FREE ALLIANCE, COLORADO CHILDRENS IMMUNIZATION COALITION, SNAP IN FARM BILL COALITION, COLORADO SUBSTANCE EXPOSED NEWBORNS POLICY WORKGROUP, AND ORAL HEALTH COLORADO POLICY COMMITTEE. PARTNERSHIPS ARE AN ESSENTIAL COMPONENT TO CHILDRENS COMMUNITY HEALTH WORK. THE HOSPITAL HAS PARTNERED WITH AN ARRAY OF LOCAL, STATE AND NATIONAL ORGANIZATIONS TO COORDINATE, COLLABORATE AND SHARE KEY FINDINGS AND LESSONS LEARNED IN IMPROVING HEALTH AND QUALITY OF LIFE FOR CHILDREN IN COLORADO. BELOW ARE A FEW EXAMPLES OF CHILDRENS COLLABORATIONS ADDRESSING COMMUNITY HEALTH IMPROVEMENT. COALITION BUILDING: IN 2016, CHILDRENS HOSPITAL COLORADO JOINED FORCES WITH EIGHT OTHER STATEWIDE HEALTH AND EDUCATION ORGANIZATIONS TO FORM THE COLORADO ALLIANCE FOR SCHOOL HEALTH (THE ALLIANCE). THE ALLIANCE AIMS TO TRANSFORM HOW HEALTH CARE AND EDUCATION PARTNERS COLLABORATE TO CREATE SUSTAINABLE SYSTEMS THAT RESULT IN HEALTH EQUITY AMONG ALL COLORADO STUDENTS. OVER THE PAST YEAR, THE ALLIANCE IDENTIFIED ADVOCACY PRIORITIES THAT INCLUDE FUNDING FOR SCHOOL HEALTH SERVICES, ACCESS TO INTEGRATED CARE FOR STUDENTS AND FAMILIES, AND EFFORTS TO DEVELOP A COMMON, COMPREHENSIVE, APPROACH TO SHARING DATA ACROSS SYSTEMS TO INFORM PLANNING, DOCUMENT PROGRESS, AND ULTIMATELY IMPROVE THE HEALTH, DEVELOPMENT, LEARNING, AND SUCCESS OF CHILDREN AND THEIR SCHOOL COMMUNITIES. ADDITIONALLY, THE ALLIANCE IS WORKING WITH LOCAL PUBLIC-SCHOOL DISTRICTS INTERESTED IN INCREASING STUDENT HEALTH AND SCHOOL PERFORMANCE THROUGH DECREASING SCHOOL ABSENCES. THE ALLIANCE IS FOCUSING ON THE ISSUE OF STUDENT ATTENDANCE BECAUSE HEALTH ISSUES ARE A LEADING CAUSE OF CHRONIC ABSENTEEISM, AND IMPROVING STUDENT ATTENDANCE INCREASES THE LIKELIHOOD OF STUDENT SUCCESS. THE OUTCOMES OF THE PLANNING PROCESS WILL BE IDENTIFICATION OF BEST PRACTICES AND POTENTIAL DEMONSTRATION PROJECTS FOR COLLABORATING ACROSS SYSTEMS, AS WELL AS DEVELOPMENT OF A POLICY AND ADVOCACY PLATFORM TO DRIVE SUSTAINABLE SYSTEMS CHANGE. COMMUNITY HEALTH IMPROVEMENT: INCREASING ACCESS TO HEALTHY FOODS AND PHYSICAL ACTIVITY OPPORTUNITIES ARE IMPERATIVE TO THE SUCCESS OF HEALTHY EATING AND ACTIVE LIVING INITIATIVES. IN COLORADO, 1 IN 6 CHILDREN STRUGGLE WITH HUNGER AND LACK ACCESS TO HEALTHY FOOD WHILE FEWER THAN HALF (47 PERCENT) OF PARENTS REPORT THAT THEIR CHILD IS PHYSICALLY ACTIVE FOR AT LEAST 60 MINUTES PER DAY. CHILDRENS COLORADO HAS PARTICIPATING IN THE FOLLOWING INITIATIVES: 1. UNIVERSAL SCREENING FOR FOOD INSECURITY MEDICAL PROVIDERS ARE INCREASINGLY AWARE OF THE IMPACT FOOD INSECURITY HAS ON THEIR PATIENTS LIVES. IN 2016, CHILDREN'S COLORADO AND HUNGER FREE COLORADO PARTNERED TO USE A VALIDATED QUESTIONNAIRE TO UNIVERSALLY SCREEN FAMILIES FOR FOOD INSECURITY AND REFER THEM TO SERVICES AND SUPPORTS IN THE CHILD HEALTH CLINIC, WHICH SERVES 11,000 PATIENTS ANNUALLY. HUNGER FREE COLORADO, THE STATES LEADING ANTI-HUNGER ORGANIZATION, PARTNERS WITH MEDICAL PRACTICES TO ASSIST FAMILIES WITH APPLYING FOR FOOD ASSISTANCE PROGRAMS, INCLUDING SUPPLEMENTAL NUTRITION ASSISTANCE PROGRAM (SNAP) AND THE SPECIAL SUPPLEMENTAL NUTRITION PROGRAM FOR WIC, AS WELL AS PROVIDING OTHER FOOD RESOURCES. 2. THE FAMILIAS SALUDABLES PARTNERSHIP - THIS PARTNERSHIP WAS ESTABLISHED TO ENSURE THAT LOW-INCOME HISPANIC CHILDREN (AGES 0-5) ACHIEVE A HEALTHY WEIGHT, AND IT HAS SUCCESSFULLY ENGAGED HISPANIC PARENTS, RESEARCHERS, MEDICAL PROVIDERS AND PROFESSIONALS FROM CHILDRENS COLORADO AND OTHER COMMUNITY-BASED ORGANIZATIONS. THESE PERSPECTIVES COMPRISE THE MEMBERSHIP OF THE THREE COMMITTEES THAT ENCOMPASS FAMILIAS SALUDABLES GOVERNANCE: LEADERSHIP, FAMILY LEADERS AND RESEARCH. FAMILIAS SALUDABLES RETAINED A CORE GROUP OF 25 PARENTS AND CAREGIVERS, AS WELL AS COMMUNITY PARTNERS INCLUDING CHILDRENS COLORADO (PROJECT LEAD), UNIVERSITY OF COLORADO (CU) SCHOOL OF MEDICINE, ROCKY MOUNTAIN YOUTH CLINICS AND AMERICAN DIABETES ASSOCIATION. NEW PARTNERS INCLUDE THE CU SCHOOL OF NURSING AND THE EARLY CHILDHOOD OBESITY PREVENTION PROGRAM AT THE COLORADO DEPARTMENT OF PUBLIC HEALTH AND ENVIRONMENT.

WE ARE CHARTING NEW TERRITORY TO FURTHER OUR REACH AND IMPACT, AND SUPPORT THE WHOLE PICTURE OF A CHILD'S HEALTH AND WELLBEING. A NEWLY APPOINTED VICE PRESIDENT OF POPULATION HEALTH AND ADVOCACY IS RESPONSIBLE FOR THE CREATION AND OPERATION OF A COMMUNITY BASED, PARTNER DRIVEN NETWORK OF CARE. THIS NETWORK BOTH EXPANDS ACCESS TO TRADITIONAL PEDIATRIC HEALTHCARE AND EXPANDS ACCESS TO NON-TRADITIONAL CARE THAT ADDRESSES A CHILDS TOTAL PICTURE OF HEALTH, THE SOCIAL DETERMINANTS OF HEALTH. OPERATING A COMMUNITY BASED, PARTNER DRIVEN NETWORK OF CARE REQUIRES IDENTIFYING PARTNERS THAT WILL ENGAGE IN A TRANSFORMATIVE SYSTEM OF CARE, ONE THAT ALLOWS A PEDIATRIC SPECIALTY HOSPITAL TO WORK WITH COMMUNITY BASED PARTNERS TO GENERATE IMPROVED HEALTH FOR ALL KIDS IN A TARGETED REGION, DESPITE NEVER BEING PATIENTS OR HAVING LIMITED INTERACTIONS WITH THAT HOSPITAL. THE NETWORK MUST SUPPORT IMPROVEMENTS IN THE DELIVERY OF TRADITIONAL HEALTHCARE SERVICES, LIKE THE NUMBER OF IMMUNIZATIONS, WELL-CHILD VISITS, ORAL HEALTH SCREENINGS AND BEHAVIORAL HEALTH INTERVENTIONS. AND THE NETWORK MUST ALSO SUPPORT IMPROVEMENTS IN SOCIAL CONDITIONS IMPACTING HEALTH SUCH AS INCREASED ATTENDANCE AT SCHOOL, INCREASED ACCESS TO NUTRITIONAL FOOD AND SUSTAINED ACCESS TO STABLE HOUSING. THE VICE PRESIDENT IS RESPONSIBLE FOR ENSURING THE NETWORK SUPPORTS THE MANY COMPONENTS OF A CHILDS HEALTH BY RECRUITING AND SUPPORTING A ROBUST ARRAY OF COMMUNITY BASED PARTNERS THAT MAY RANGE FROM SCHOOLS TO CHILDCARE CENTERS TO CHURCHES AND FOOD PANTRIES. EACH PARTICIPATING PARTNER MUST WORK COHESIVELY TO EXCHANGE DATA THAT ALLOWS FOR A CHILDS NEEDS TO BE IDENTIFIED AND MET. FINALLY, THE VICE PRESIDENT IS RESPONSIBLE FOR DIRECTING HOSPITAL RESOURCES TO SUPPORT THE CREATION AND OPERATION OF THE COMMUNITY BASED NETWORK."

CHILDRENS COLORADO FOCUSED ON SIX HEALTH PRIORITY AREAS THAT WERE IDENTIFIED IN THE 2015 COMMUNITY HEALTH NEEDS ASSESSMENT (CHNA) AND LED OR COLLABORATED WITH PARTNERS ON INITIATIVES WITHIN THE HOSPITAL, IN THE COMMUNITY AND ACROSS THE STATE. THESE INITIATIVES INCLUDED EDUCATION AND PUBLIC AWARENESS, TRAININGS, SCREENINGS AND IMPROVING ACCESS TO CARE, POLICY AND ADVOCACY EFFORTS AND EXPANSION OF THE WORKFORCE IN COMMUNITY HEALTH. SINCE THE ADOPTION OF THE IMPLEMENTATION PLAN A POPULATION HEALTH EPIDEMIOLOGIST JOINED THE TEAM. RESPONSIBILITIES OF THE EPIDEMIOLOGIST INCLUDE USING ANALYTICS TO IDENTIFY, ASSESS AND EVALUATE POPULATION-BASED TRENDS TO INFORM OUR STRATEGIES DEVELOPED IN THE COMMUNITY HEALTH ACTION PLAN (IMPLEMENTATION PLAN).

THIS REORGANIZATION AND EXPANSION OF RESOURCES IN CHAI DEMONSTRATES A COMMITMENT TO COHESIVELY AND EFFECTIVELY IMPACT THE PRIORITY AREAS DEFINED IN OUR CHNA. PLEASE SEE HIGHLIGHTED ACTIVITIES BELOW. SOCIAL AND ENVIRONMENTAL IMPROVEMENTS: IN 2017, THE CHILD HEALTH ADVOCACY INSTITUTE HIRED SIX COMMUNITY HEALTH LIAISONS (CHLS) AND THE BREATHING INSTITUTE HIRED TWO CHLS TO ADDRESS SOCIAL AND ENVIRONMENTAL FACTORS THAT AFFECT CHILD HEALTH. THE CHLS WITHIN CHAI SERVE CHILDREN AND FAMILIES IN TWO PRIMARY CARE SETTINGS AND ONE COMMUNITY SETTING (THE WOMEN, INFANTS, AND CHILDREN OFFICE THROUGH THE BUILD HEALTH CHALLENGE GRANT). THESE FAMILIES ASSIST FAMILIES WITH RESOURCE AND SERVICE SUPPORT NEEDS INCLUDING FINANCIAL ASSISTANCE, BENEFITS, FOOD INSECURITY, AND CONNECTING FAMILIES TO A MEDICAL PROVIDER. IN 2017, MORE THAN 1,000 CHILD HEALTH CLINIC (CHC) PATIENTS WERE REFERRED TO A COMMUNITY HEALTH LIAISON FOR RESOURCE SUPPORT. SOME OF THE MOST COMMON RESOURCE REFERRALS IN THE CHC INCLUDE FOOD RESOURCES, PRIMARY CARE PROVIDER RESOURCES FOR PARENTS, AND MEDICAID SUPPORT, INCLUDING MEDICAID TRANSPORTATION. IN THE WIC OFFICE, THE CHLS PROVIDED RESOURCE SUPPORT FOR MORE THAN 300 FAMILIES IN 2017, ASSISTING PRIMARILY WITH WIC BENEFITS UTILIZATION, MEDICAID ASSISTANCE, AND DIAPER OR BABY SUPPLIES. THE TWO CHLS WHO ARE IN OTHER PRIMARY CARE PRACTICES HAVE FAMILIES WITH TRANSPORTATION NEEDS TO ENSURE THEY MAKE IT TO THEIR APPOINTMENTS, CONNECTING PARENTS TO A PRIMARY CARE PROVIDER, AND ASSISTING FAMILIES WITH THEIR BENEFITS, AS PART OF A LARGER PROJECT AIMED TO REDUCE UNNECESSARY EMERGENCY DEPARTMENT UTILIZATION. THE CHLS WITHIN THE BREATHING INSTITUTE ARE PART OF THE JUST KEEP BREATHING (JKB) PROGRAM AIMED AT IMPROVING CARE FOR CHILDREN WITH HIGH RISK ASTHMA IN DENVER. THESE CHLS WORK WITH FAMILIES TO IDENTIFY BARRIERS TO RECEIVING CARE AND ACHIEVING ASTHMA CONTROL, INCLUDING CONDUCTING AN ENVIRONMENTAL ASSESSMENT OF THE FAMILYS HOME AND ASSISTING WITH MINIMAL HOME REMEDIATION, SUCH AS PEST EXTERMINATION. THROUGH THE HOME VISITATION PROGRAM, 55 PATIENTS HAVE RECEIVED AT LEAST ONE VISIT, WITH A TOTAL OF 212 COMPLETED VISITS. JKB PATIENTS HAVE DEMONSTRATED SIGNIFICANTLY IMPROVED MEDICATION DEVICE TECHNIQUE AND IMPROVED ASTHMA CONTROL. COMMUNITY HEALTH IMPROVEMENT: INCREASING ACCESS TO HEALTHY FOODS AND PHYSICAL ACTIVITY OPPORTUNITIES ARE IMPERATIVE TO THE SUCCESS OF HEALTHY EATING AND ACTIVE LIVING INITIATIVES.

NEW PARTNERS INCLUDE THE CU SCHOOL OF NURSING AND THE EARLY CHILDHOOD OBESITY PREVENTION PROGRAM AT THE COLORADO DEPARTMENT OF PUBLIC HEALTH AND ENVIRONMENT. INFANT SAFE SLEEP INITIATIVE: ACCORDING TO DATA FROM THE COLORADO CHILD FATALITY PREVENTION SYSTEM, ABOUT 50 INFANTS DIE SUDDENLY AND UNEXPECTEDLY, SOMETIMES CALLED SUDDEN INFANT DEATH SYNDROME (SIDS), EACH YEAR IN COLORADO WHILE THEY SLEEP. MOST OF THESE SLEEP-RELATED INFANT DEATHS ARE PREVENTABLE. IN RESPONSE TO THIS CHALLENGING PUBLIC HEALTH ISSUE, IN 2017 THE INJURY PROGRAM AT CHILDREN'S HOSPITAL COLORADO ESTABLISHED AN INSAFE SAFE SLEEP INITIATIVE DESIGNED TO PROMOTE AWARENESS OF AMERICAN ACADEMY OF PEDIATRICS SAFE INFANT SLEEP GUIDELINES AND RECOMMENDATIONS TO REDUCE THE RISK OF SIDS AND SUFFOCATION.

THE BASIS FOR PAYMENT TO THE MEDICAL CENTER UNDER THESE AGREEMENTS INCLUDES PROSPECTIVELY DETERMINED RATES PER DISCHARGE OR DAYS OF HOSPITALIZATION AND DISCOUNTS FROM ESTABLISHED CHARGES. SOME OF THESE AGREEMENTS HAVE RETROSPECTIVE AUDIT CLAUSES, ALLOWING THE PAYOR TO REVIEW AND ADJUST CLAIMS SUBSEQUENT TO INITIAL PAYMENT. THE MEDICAL CENTER RECOGNIZES PATIENT SERVICE REVENUE ASSOCIATED WITH SERVICES PROVIDED TO PATIENTS WHO HAVE THIRD-PARTY PAYOR COVERAGE ON THE BASIS OF THESE ESTABLISHED RATES FOR THE SERVICES RENDERED. FOR UNINSURED PATIENTS THAT DO NOT QUALIFY FOR CHARITY CARE, THE MEDICAL CENTER RECOGNIZES REVENUES ON THE BASIS OF ITS STANDARD RATES, DISCOUNTED IN ACCORDANCE WITH THE MEDICAL CENTER'S POLICY. ON THE BASIS OF HISTORICAL EXPERIENCE, A SIGNIFICANT PORTION OF THE MEDICAL CENTER'S UNINSURED PATIENTS WILL BE UNABLE OR UNWILLING TO PAY FOR THE SERVICES PROVIDED. THUS, THE MEDICAL CENTER RECORDS A SIGNIFICANT PROVISION OF BAD DEBTS RELATED TO UNINSURED PATIENTS IN THE PERIOD THE SERVICES ARE PROVIDED. FOR THE YEARS ENDED DECEMBER 31, 2017 AND 2016, NET PATIENT SERVICE REVENUE WAS INCREASED BY APPROXIMATELY $5,091,000 AND $10,906,000, RESPECTIVELY, FOR FAVORABLE ADJUSTMENTS AND SETTLEMENTS RELATED TO PRIOR YEARS."
201823199349301957,221487173,"SCHEDULE H, PART III, SECTION B; QUESTION 8","MEDICARE COSTS WERE DERIVED FROM THE 2017 MEDICARE COST REPORT. THE ORGANIZATION FEELS THAT MEDICARE UNDERPAYMENTS (SHORTFALL), BAD DEBT AND ASSOCIATED COSTS ARE COMMUNITY BENEFIT AND ARE INCLUDABLE ON THE FORM 990, SCHEDULE H, PART I. AS OUTLINED MORE FULLY BELOW, THE ORGANIZATION BELIEVES THAT THESE SERVICES AND RELATED COSTS PROMOTE THE HEALTH OF THE COMMUNITY AS A WHOLE AND ARE RENDERED IN CONJUNCTION WITH THE ORGANIZATION'S CHARITABLE TAX-EXEMPT PURPOSES AND MISSION IN PROVIDING MEDICALLY NECESSARY HEALTHCARE SERVICES TO ALL INDIVIDUALS IN A NON-DISCRIMINATORY MANNER WITHOUT REGARD TO RACE, COLOR, CREED, SEX, NATIONAL ORIGIN OR ABILITY TO PAY AND CONSISTENT WITH THE COMMUNITY BENEFIT STANDARD PROMULGATED BY THE IRS. THE COMMUNITY BENEFIT STANDARD IS THE CURRENT STANDARD FOR A HOSPITAL FOR RECOGNITION AS A TAX-EXEMPT AND CHARITABLE ORGANIZATION UNDER INTERNAL REVENUE CODE (""IRC"") 501(C)(3). THE ORGANIZATION IS RECOGNIZED AS A TAX-EXEMPT ENTITY AND CHARITABLE ORGANIZATION UNDER 501(C)(3) OF THE IRC. ALTHOUGH THERE IS NO DEFINITION IN THE TAX CODE FOR THE TERM ""CHARITABLE"" A REGULATION PROMULGATED BY THE DEPARTMENT OF THE TREASURY PROVIDES SOME GUIDANCE AND STATES THAT ""THE TERM CHARITABLE IS USED IN SECTION 501(C)(3) IN ITS GENERALLY ACCEPTED LEGAL SENSE,PROVIDES EXAMPLES OF CHARITABLE PURPOSES, INCLUDING THE RELIEF OF THE POOR OR UNPRIVILEGED; THE PROMOTION OF SOCIAL WELFARE; AND THE ADVANCEMENT OF EDUCATION, RELIGION, AND SCIENCE. NOTE IT DOES NOT EXPLICITLY ADDRESS THE ACTIVITIES OF HOSPITALS. IN THE ABSENCE OF EXPLICIT STATUTORY OR REGULATORY REQUIREMENTS APPLYING THE TERM ""CHARITABLE"" TO HOSPITALS, IT HAS BEEN LEFT TO THE IRS TO DETERMINE THE CRITERIA HOSPITALS MUST MEET TO QUALIFY AS IRC 501(C)(3) CHARITABLE ORGANIZATIONS. THE ORIGINAL STANDARD WAS KNOWN AS THE CHARITY CARE STANDARD. THIS STANDARD WAS REPLACED BY THE IRS WITH THE COMMUNITY BENEFIT STANDARD WHICH IS THE CURRENT STANDARD. CHARITY CARE STANDARD IN 1956, THE IRS ISSUED REVENUE RULING 56-185, WHICH ADDRESSED THE REQUIREMENTS HOSPITALS NEEDED TO MEET IN ORDER TO QUALIFY FOR IRC 501(C)(3) STATUS. ONE OF THESE REQUIREMENTS IS KNOWN AS THE ""CHARITY CARE STANDARD."" UNDER THE STANDARD, A HOSPITAL MUST PROVIDE, TO THE EXTENT OF ITS FINANCIAL ABILITY, FREE OR REDUCED-COST CARE TO PATIENTS WHO CANNOT PAY FOR SUCH SERVICES. A HOSPITAL THAT EXPECTED FULL PAYMENT DID NOT, ACCORDING TO THE RULING, PROVIDE CHARITY CARE BASED ON THE FACT THAT SOME PATIENTS ULTIMATELY FAILED TO PAY. THE RULING EMPHASIZED THAT A LOW LEVEL OF CHARITY CARE DID NOT NECESSARILY MEAN THAT A HOSPITAL HAD FAILED TO MEET THE REQUIREMENT SINCE THAT LEVEL COULD REFLECT ITS FINANCIAL ABILITY TO PROVIDE SUCH CARE. THE RULING ALSO NOTED THAT PUBLICLY SUPPORTED COMMUNITY HOSPITALS WOULD NORMALLY QUALIFY AS CHARITABLE ORGANIZATIONS BECAUSE THEY SERVE THE ENTIRE COMMUNITY AND A LOW LEVEL OF CHARITY CARE WOULD NOT AFFECT A HOSPITAL'S EXEMPT STATUS IF IT WAS DUE TO THE SURROUNDING COMMUNITY'S LACK OF CHARITABLE DEMANDS. COMMUNITY BENEFIT STANDARD IN 1969, THE IRS ISSUED REVENUE RULING 69-545, WHICH ""REMOVED"" FROM REVENUE RULING 56-185 ""THE REQUIREMENTS RELATING TO CARING FOR PATIENTS WITHOUT CHARGE OR AT RATES BELOW COST."" UNDER THE STANDARD DEVELOPED IN REVENUE RULING 69-545, WHICH IS KNOWN AS THE ""COMMUNITY BENEFIT STANDARD,"" HOSPITALS ARE JUDGED ON WHETHER THEY PROMOTE THE HEALTH OF A BROAD CLASS OF INDIVIDUALS IN THE COMMUNITY. THE RULING INVOLVED A HOSPITAL THAT ONLY ADMITTED INDIVIDUALS WHO COULD PAY FOR THE SERVICES (BY THEMSELVES, PRIVATE INSURANCE, OR PUBLIC PROGRAMS SUCH AS MEDICARE), BUT OPERATED A FULL-TIME EMERGENCY ROOM THAT WAS OPEN TO EVERYONE. THE IRS RULED THAT THE HOSPITAL QUALIFIED AS A CHARITABLE ORGANIZATION BECAUSE IT PROMOTED THE HEALTH OF PEOPLE IN ITS COMMUNITY. THE IRS REASONED THAT BECAUSE THE PROMOTION OF HEALTH WAS A CHARITABLE PURPOSE ACCORDING TO THE GENERAL LAW OF CHARITY, IT FELL WITHIN THE ""GENERALLY ACCEPTED LEGAL SENSE"" OF THE TERM ""CHARITABLE,"" AS REQUIRED BY THE DEPARTMENT OF TREASURY REG. 1.501(C)(3)-1(D)(2). THE IRS RULING STATED THAT THE PROMOTION OF HEALTH, LIKE THE RELIEF OF POVERTY AND THE ADVANCEMENT OF EDUCATION AND RELIGION, IS ONE OF THE PURPOSES IN THE GENERAL LAW OF CHARITY THAT IS DEEMED BENEFICIAL TO THE COMMUNITY AS A WHOLE EVEN THOUGH THE CLASS OF BENEFICIARIES ELIGIBLE TO RECEIVE A DIRECT BENEFIT FROM ITS ACTIVITIES DOES NOT INCLUDE ALL MEMBERS OF THE COMMUNITY, SUCH AS INDIGENT MEMBERS OF THE COMMUNITY, PROVIDED THAT THE CLASS IS NOT SO SMALL THAT ITS RELIEF IS NOT OF BENEFIT TO THE COMMUNITY. THE IRS CONCLUDED THAT THE HOSPITAL WAS ""PROMOTING THE HEALTH OF A CLASS OF PERSONS THAT IS BROAD ENOUGH TO BENEFIT THE COMMUNITY"" BECAUSE ITS EMERGENCY ROOM WAS OPEN TO ALL AND IT PROVIDED CARE TO EVERYONE WHO COULD PAY, WHETHER DIRECTLY OR THROUGH THIRD-PARTY REIMBURSEMENT. OTHER CHARACTERISTICS OF THE HOSPITAL THAT THE IRS HIGHLIGHTED INCLUDED THE FOLLOWING: ITS SURPLUS FUNDS WERE USED TO IMPROVE PATIENT CARE, EXPAND HOSPITAL FACILITIES, AND ADVANCE MEDICAL TRAINING, EDUCATION AND RESEARCH; IT WAS CONTROLLED BY A BOARD OF TRUSTEES THAT CONSISTED OF INDEPENDENT CIVIC LEADERS; AND HOSPITAL MEDICAL STAFF PRIVILEGES WERE AVAILABLE TO ALL QUALIFIED PHYSICIANS. THE AMERICAN HOSPITAL ASSOCIATION (""AHA"") FEELS THAT MEDICARE UNDERPAYMENTS (SHORTFALL) AND BAD DEBT ARE COMMUNITY BENEFIT AND THUS INCLUDABLE ON THE FORM 990, SCHEDULE H, PART I. THIS ORGANIZATION AGREES WITH THE AHA'S POSITION. AS OUTLINED IN THE AHA'S LETTER TO THE IRS DATED AUGUST 21, 2007 WITH RESPECT TO THE FIRST PUBLISHED DRAFT OF THE NEW FORM 990 AND SCHEDULE H, THE AHA FELT THAT THE IRS SHOULD INCORPORATE THE FULL VALUE OF THE COMMUNITY BENEFIT THAT HOSPITALS PROVIDE BY COUNTING MEDICARE UNDERPAYMENTS (SHORTFALL) AS QUANTIFIABLE COMMUNITY BENEFIT FOR THE FOLLOWING REASONS: - PROVIDING CARE FOR THE ELDERLY AND SERVING MEDICARE PATIENTS IS AN ESSENTIAL PART OF THE COMMUNITY BENEFIT STANDARD - MEDICARE, LIKE MEDICAID, DOES NOT PAY THE FULL COST OF CARE. FROM THE LATEST DATA PROVIDED BY THE AHA, AS OF 2012, MEDICARE REIMBURSES HOSPITALS ONLY 86 CENTS FOR EVERY DOLLAR THEY SPEND TO TAKE CARE OF MEDICARE PATIENTS. THE MEDICARE PAYMENT ADVISORY COMMISSION (""MEDPAC""), IN ITS MARCH 2013 REPORT TO CONGRESS, STATES THAT BENEFICIARIES WILL GROW NOTABLY FASTER IN THE NEXT 10 YEARS THAN IN THE PAST DECADE AS THE BABY-BOOM GENERATION AGES INTO THE PROGRAM. IN ADDITION, THE POPULATION AGING INTO THE MEDICARE PROGRAM WILL PRESENT A NEW SET OF CHALLENGES SINCE RISING OBESITY LEVELS PUT THIS POPULATION AT A GREATER RISK THAN PREVIOUS GENERATIONS FOR CHRONIC DISEASE. - MANY MEDICARE BENEFICIARIES, LIKE THEIR MEDICAID COUNTERPARTS, ARE POOR. MORE THAN 42 PERCENT OF MEDICARE SPENDING IS FOR BENEFICIARIES WHOSE INCOME IS BELOW 200 PERCENT OF THE FEDERAL POVERTY LEVEL. MANY OF THOSE MEDICARE BENEFICIARIES ARE ALSO ELIGIBLE FOR MEDICAID -- SO CALLED ELIGIBLE."" THERE IS EVERY COMPELLING PUBLIC POLICY REASON TO TREAT MEDICARE AND MEDICAID UNDERPAYMENTS SIMILARLY FOR PURPOSES OF A HOSPITAL'S COMMUNITY BENEFIT AND INCLUDE THESE COSTS ON FORM 990, SCHEDULE H, PART I. MEDICARE UNDERPAYMENT MUST BE SHOULDERED BY THE HOSPITAL IN ORDER TO CONTINUE TREATING THE COMMUNITY'S ELDERLY AND POOR. THESE UNDERPAYMENTS REPRESENT A REAL COST OF SERVING THE COMMUNITY AND SHOULD COUNT AS A QUANTIFIABLE COMMUNITY BENEFIT. BOTH THE AHA AND THIS ORGANIZATION ALSO FEEL THAT PATIENT BAD DEBT IS A COMMUNITY BENEFIT AND THUS INCLUDABLE ON THE FORM 990, SCHEDULE H, PART I. LIKE MEDICARE UNDERPAYMENT (SHORTFALLS), THERE ALSO ARE COMPELLING REASONS THAT PATIENT BAD DEBT SHOULD BE COUNTED AS QUANTIFIABLE COMMUNITY BENEFIT AS FOLLOWS: - A SIGNIFICANT MAJORITY OF BAD DEBT IS ATTRIBUTABLE TO LOW-INCOME PATIENTS, WHO, FOR MANY REASONS, DECLINE TO COMPLETE THE FORMS REQUIRED TO ESTABLISH ELIGIBILITY FOR HOSPITALS' CHARITY CARE OR THOSE WHO DO NOT PAY ALL, OR A PORTION OF THE ALREADY DISCOUNTED BILLED AMOUNTS UNDER OUR FINANCIAL ASSISTANCE POLICY. A 2006 CONGRESSIONAL BUDGET OFFICE (""CBO"") REPORT, NONPROFIT HOSPITALS AND THE PROVISION OF COMMUNITY BENEFITS, CITED TWO STUDIES INDICATING THAT ""THE GREAT MAJORITY OF BAD DEBT WAS ATTRIBUTABLE TO PATIENTS WITH INCOMES BELOW 200% OF THE FEDERAL POVERTY LINE."" - THE REPORT ALSO NOTED THAT A SUBSTANTIAL PORTION OF BAD DEBT IS PENDING CHARITY CARE. UNLIKE BAD DEBT IN OTHER INDUSTRIES, HOSPITAL BAD DEBT IS COMPLICATED BY THE FACT THAT HOSPITALS FOLLOW THEIR MISSION TO THE COMMUNITY AND TREAT EVERY PATIENT THAT COMES THROUGH THEIR EMERGENCY DEPARTMENT, REGARDLESS OF ABILITY TO PAY. PATIENTS WHO HAVE OUTSTANDING BILLS ARE NOT TURNED AWAY, UNLIKE OTHER INDUSTRIES. BAD DEBT IS FURTHER COMPLICATED BY THE AUDITING INDUSTRY'S STANDARDS ON REPORTING CHARITY CARE. MANY PATIENTS CANNOT OR DO NOT PROVIDE THE NECESSARY, EXTENSIVE DOCUMENTATION REQUIRED TO BE DEEMED CHARITY CARE BY AUDITORS. AS A RESULT, ROUGHLY 40% OF BAD DEBT IS PENDING CHARITY CARE. THE CBO CONCLUDED THAT ITS FINDINGS ""SUPPORT THE VALIDITY OF THE USE OF U"

201813169349305651,550525724,Part III Line 4,"United Hospital Centers financial statements are prepared on a consolidated basis as a member of the WV United Health System. The footnote for Accounts Receivable is as follows Patient accounts receivable are reported at net realizable value. Accounts are written off when they are determined to be uncollectible based upon managements assessment of individual accounts. In evaluating the collectability of patient accounts receivable, the System analyzes its past history and identifies trends for each of its major payor sources of revenue to estimate the appropriate allowance for doubtful accounts and provision for bad debts. For receivables associated with services provided to patients who have third-party coverage, the System analyzes contractual amounts due and provides an allowance for doubtful account and a provision for bad debts, if necessary. For receivables associated with self-pay patients, which includes both patients without insurance and insured patients with deductible and copayment balances, the System records a significant provision for bad debts in the period of service on the basis of its past experience, which indicates that many patients are unable or unwilling to pay the portion of their bill for which they are financially responsible. The difference between the billed rates and the amounts actually collected after all reasonable collection efforts have been exhausted is charged off against the allowance for doubtful accounts. The Systems allowance for doubtful accounts for self-pay patients increased to 60 of self-pay accounts receivable at December 31, 2017, from 57 of self-pay accounts receivable at December 31, 2016. In addition, the Systems self-pay write-offs net of recoveries increased approximately 61,142,000 in 2017, from approximately, 51,775,000 in 2016, which is the result of a slightly higher payor mix percentage of individuals without insurance and a slightly higher exposure to self-pay balances from high deductible third-party insurance plans. The System does not maintain a material allowance for doubtful accounts from third-party payors, nor does it have a history of significant write-offs from third-party payors. The System grants credit without collateral to its patients, most of whom are local residents and are insured under third-party payor agreements, primarily with Medicare, Medicaid, and various commercial insurance companies. The System maintains allowances for potential credit losses and such losses have historically been within managements expectations. The mix of receivables at December 31, 2017 and 2016 from patients and third-party payors is as follows. For 2017, Medicare 29, Medicaid 14, Blue Cross 21, Commercial/HMO/Other 32, Patients 4, Total 100. For 2016, Medicare 31, Medicaid 14, Blue Cross 21, Commercial/HMO/Other 30, Patients 4, Total 100."

201823189349312287,226019101,"SCHEDULE H, PART VI, QUESTION 5","As one of the state's major healthcare facilities, JFK Medical Center has a proud tradition of clinical excellence in numerous medical and surgical specialties, including two world-class institutes under one roof -- The Neuroscience Institute and the Johnson Rehabilitation Institute. The Neuroscience Institute has been rated as the number one hospital in New Jersey for the treatment of stroke and complex neurological disorders. The Johnson Rehabilitation Institute has received a national designation in rehabilitation medicine and traumatic brain recovery. From cutting-edge technology for diagnostic imaging and radiation therapies, to participating in the prestigious nationwide Johns Hopkins University School of Medicine elective cardiac catheterization study, JFK Medical Center remains on the forefront of delivering high quality care for the entire family. JFK continues our history of innovation and growth with recent facility investments including a state of the art cardiac catheterization laboratory (for elective and emergency angioplasty), enhanced digital mammography at the Breast Center, the comprehensive Center for Wound Healing, and a brand new pediatric and adult emergency department. JFK's Cardiac Catheterization Lab became the first in Middlesex County to provide a new bio-absorbable stent as an alternative to traditional metal stents in treating coronary artery disease. Heart disease is a serious public health issue and is now the leading cause of death among men and women; coronary artery disease is the most common form of heart disease. The Emergency Department consists of 50 adult private beds, a separate Pediatric Emergency Department with 14 private beds and a spacious and efficient Patient Arrival Center. The new Emergency Department offers privacy, safety and fast access to a team of specialists trained in emergency medicine who provide streamlined patient care. Lung Cancer ========== Lung cancer is the leading cause of cancer-related mortality in the United States and worldwide. Five-year survival rates are low, as most patients have advanced stage lung cancer at the time of diagnosis. In the past, a CT scan was not an approved screening method. Now, early detection with a low dose screening CT (""LDCT"") scan can improve prognosis. The JFK Diagnostic Imaging Department uses prudent scanning protocols to reduce the radiation dose by as much as 50% without compromising image quality. This technique, with the addition of state-of-the-art Adaptive Statistical Iterative Reconstruction technology, further minimizes radiation dose to its patients. It also provides a highly detailed look at the lungs for effective diagnosis, early detection and treatment of lung disease and lung cancer. The LDCT screening scan can provide early detection of lung cancer which allows timely treatment and improved survival as the disease is found at an earlier stage. The LDCT screening scan can also provide incidental detection of other diseases such as breast and other cancers, COPD and other lung diseases, and coronary artery disease. The outcomes are: a reduction in disease-related and treatment related morbidity; improvement in healthy lifestyle; and decreased anxiety. Robotic Surgery ============ JFK Medical Center surgeons use the latest da Vinci Xi surgical system, which is the newest addition to the da Vinci line of robotic surgery tools. Robotic surgery uses advanced robotic, computer and optical technologies to assist the surgeon with an operation. Its movements are completely controlled by the surgeon, but with 3D high definition vision systems, special instruments and computer software, the surgeon can operate with enhanced vision, precision, dexterity and control. The inclusion of the latest in robotic surgery tools among JFK Medical Center's surgical offerings is yet another reinforcement of its efforts to stay on the leading edge of treatment, ensuring that the JFK community receives the best care. JFK Johnson Rehabilitation Institute =========================== Open since 1974, the JFK Johnson Rehabilitation Institute (""JRI"") is a Center of Excellence of JFK Health System, Inc. It is also the Physical Medicine and Rehabilitation Department of Rutgers Robert Wood Johnson Medical School. JRI's mission is to provide quality rehabilitation that will assist adults and children living with disabilities to obtain optimal function and independence within an accepting community. Our continuum of care assures patients of an integrated, personalized program that facilitates the recovery process and encourages family participation. JRI is now expanding many of its existing services, including those focused on spasticity, Parkinson's, pain management, cardiac rehabilitation, and men's and women's health services. JRI is also expanding its research capabilities to ensure that its patients receive the best in new innovations that translate to improvements in clinical care. The Center for Brain Injuries at JRI developed the Continuum of Care model where patients receive intensive and integrated care that progresses as their needs change. The Continuum of Care provides patients with highly specialized rehabilitation at every step of their journey toward recovery. First Phase: Trauma Center for Rehabilitation Immediately after a traumatic brain injury, perhaps a car or bicycle accident, a fall or assault, the patient may be facing multiple and critical injuries. Yet brain injury rehabilitation must nonetheless begin, even for patients with tracheostomy tubes, on ventilators or with serious orthopedic injuries. Second Phase: Brain Trauma Unit If patients have a change in mental status, a seizure or other health care issue, JRI has resources to help them that are second to none. If necessary, patients are just an elevator ride to an ICU. And because JRI can draw on the wider resources of JFK Medical Center, rehabilitation can start early, and continue even if a patient needs additional medical treatment. Third Phase: Extended Recovery Unit The subacute rehabilitation program was created within JRI for patients who are more stable medically but not yet ready to return home. These patients benefit greatly from continued intensive rehabilitation. The Extended Recovery Unit is the only state-certified subacute brain injury rehabilitation program in New Jersey. Fourth Phase: Outpatient Comprehensive Neuro Rehabilitation Many patients who are well enough to go home can still benefit greatly from ongoing, highly specialized outpatient therapy that includes neuropsychology and all the therapies - recreational, speech, vocational and academic. Patients in outpatient cognitive rehabilitation can receive up to 25 hours of therapy each week. Neuroscience Institute ================= The Neuroscience Institute is New Jersey's leader in the diagnosis and treatment of brain and spine disorders. The Institute offers extensive clinical care programs, research and education in neurology and neurosurgery. In the past few years, the use of immunotherapy represents a novel approach to cancer treatment, based on a sophisticated understanding of cancer biology and the immune response. For that reason, JFK has been part of clinical trials that explore new treatment options. In addition to trials on ImmunoCellular's therapy, JFK has been the site for clinical testing of Tacagen's gene therapy effort. The JFK Brain Tumor Center will also be studying the effect of the next class of drugs in the treatment of malignant brain tumors, known as PD1/PDL inhibitors. These drugs block immunosuppressive factors in the body, allowing for a more robust immune reaction against the brain tumor cells. JFK has the reputation of having a 'look forward' view in delivering healthcare, whether it be technology or advances in treatment. JFK's Neurocritical Care Unit is a natural outgrowth of the commitment it has made to provide comprehensive treatment of acute ischemic stroke and similar emergent conditions. The Unit enables JFK to provide efficient continuity of care for patients without the need for transfer to New York City or Philadelphia. This is good for the patient and a great benefit for their families. In keeping with its focus on meeting the full range of a patient's medical needs, JFK has a multi-disciplinary team. The team includes neurologists, neurointensivists, neurointerventionalists (who perform image-guided, minimally invasive procedures on the brain and spine), critical care registered nurses, respiratory therapists, pharmacists, dieticians, physical therapists, occupational therapists, speech-language pathologies, physiatrists, case managers and social workers. Its nurses are certified in Emergency Neurological Life Support and trained in both intensive care and stroke management. Its imaging specialists employ sophisticated technologies to provide highly detailed views of the brain and spinal cord, so that bleeding or swelling in the brain, and the status of tumors an"

The service areas are also defined as Brooklyn Community Districts 3 and 8. According to the 2015 NYC Community Health Profile for Brooklyn Community District 3, the population totaled 154,332 with 64% of residents identifying as black or African-American and 32% were ages 25 to 44. The 2015 NYC Community Health Profile for Brooklyn Community District 8 reported a population of 97,772 with 64% of residents identifying as black or African-American and 36% were ages 25 to 44. The hospital provides healthcare to approximately 40,000 unique patients each year, including more than 9,000 inpatient stays, 130,000 outpatient visits, and 36,000 adult & pediatric emergency visits. In 2015, IMC served 175,514 patients (38,924 unduplicated). More than half(51%) of the hospitals patients were female, 36% were ages 18 to 39, 4% were homeless, 80% were African American, 6% were White Hispanic, 4% were Black Hispanic, 4% were white; 65% were covered by Medicaid or a Medicaid HMO, and 5% were uninsured; 13% abused substances, and 21% had mental health issues. Another distinct aspect of the community that IMC serves is the high percentage of individuals who have had incarceration experiences or have been on parole, which exacerbates the observed mental health and substance abuse disparities. According to the Justice Mapping Centers Justice Atlas of Sentencing and Corrections, NYC neighborhoods that are home to 18% of the citys adult population account for more than 50% of prison admission each year. The parolee rate is also disproportionately high for Central Brooklyn. This demographic profile reflects Central Brooklyn as a whole, which is a designated Medically Underserved Area and Health Professional Shortage Area for Dental Health, Mental Health, and Primary Care."
