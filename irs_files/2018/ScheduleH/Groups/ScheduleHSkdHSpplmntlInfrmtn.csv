ELEMENTS OF THE MINI-MAPP PROCESS INCLUDED A COMMUNITY THEMES AND STRENGTHS SURVEY, HEALTH STATUS ASSESSMENT, COUNTY HEALTH RANKINGS AND FOCUS GROUPS WITH ELEMENTS OF FORCES OF CHANGE. THE MINI-MAPP PROCESS ALSO HELPED TO IDENTIFY AND VALIDATE PREVIOUSLY DETERMINED COMMUNITY HEALTH NEEDS THAT ENABLED MARY LANNING TO CREATE AN IMPLEMENTATION PLAN THAT IS IN ALIGNMENT WITH THE SHDHD'S CHIP (COMMUNITY HEALTH IMPROVEMENT PLAN) AS BOTH PLANS WORK TOGETHER TO ADDRESS THE NEEDS IN THE IDENTIFIED COMMUNITY."

MARY LANNING PARTNERED WITH THE SOUTH HEARTLAND DISTRICT HEALTH DEPARTMENT TO COORDINATE OUR IMPLEMENTATION PLAN WITH THEIR COMMUNITY HEALTH IMPROVEMENT PLAN (CHIP). MONTHLY MEETINGS WERE HELD WITH THE HEALTH DEPARTMENT AND OTHER PARTNER ORGANIZATIONS TO DISCUSS PROGRESS AND AVOID DUPLICATION. THE MARY LANNING TEAM ALSO CONTINUED TO UPDATE AND PROVIDE SERVICES IN THE FIVE AREAS OF NEED. HIGHLIGHTS FROM EACH AREA OF NEED INCLUDE THE FOLLOWING: OBESITY: MLH IS COMMITTED TO INCREASING COMMUNICATION WITH THEIR PATIENTS ON OPPORTUNITIES AVAILABLE TO ADDRESS OBESITY; AND INCREASE COMMUNITY AWARENESS OF THE IMPORTANCE OF WELLBEING IN ALL FIVE AREAS: PURPOSE, SOCIAL, FINANCIAL, PHYSICAL AND COMMUNITY; CANCER: MLH IS COMMITTED TO DEVELOPING A WOMEN'S HEALTH PROGRAM, DEVELOPING A PATIENT NAVIGATION SYSTEM AT THE MORRISON CANCER CENTER, PROVIDING AND EDUCATING THE COMMUNITY ON AVAILABLE SCREENING, AND COLLABORATING WITH THE HOME HEALTH DEPARTMENT TO DEVELOP SERVICES FOR WOMEN AND CHILDREN. MENTAL HEALTH: MLH IS COMMITTED TO IMPLEMENTING THE INTEGRATED CARE MODEL; EXPANDING TELE-MENTAL HEALTH; AND EXPANDING MENTAL HEALTH FIRST AID. SUBSTANCE ABUSE: MLH IS COMMITTED TO TRAINING PROVIDERS TO IDENTIFY AND REFER HIGH-RISK PATIENTS. ACCESS TO CARE: MLH IS COMMITTED TO DEVELOPING A STRATEGY TO ENCOURAGE MEDICARE RECIPIENTS TO EXAMINE THEIR PART D OPTIONS ANNUALLY, EXPANDING INTERPRETER SERVICES; EXPANDING TELE-HEALTH TECHNOLOGY; COLLABORATING WITH HOSPITALIST LEADERSHIP TO DEVELOP A FORMAL PALLIATIVE CARE PROGRAM; AND IMPLEMENT A HEALTH LITERACY INITIATIVE AT MLH THROUGH PARTNERSHIP WITH SHDHD.PRIORITIZED NEEDS STAKEHOLDERS IN THE ORIGINAL MAPP PROCESS WERE ASKED TO RANK ALL NEEDS ON A SCALE TO DETERMINE PRIORITY AREAS. THE TOP FOUR RANKED AREAS THROUGH THIS PROCESS WERE: OBESITY, CANCER, SUBSTANCE ABUSE AND MENTAL HEALTH. ACCESS TO CARE WAS ALSO IDENTIFIED PREVIOUSLY THROUGH THE PUBLIC HEALTH SYSTEM ASSESSMENT. THE PROCESS OF THE MINI-MAPP AGAIN IDENTIFIED ALL FIVE AS AN AREA OF NEED AND THESE AREAS WILL CONTINUE TO BE THE PRIORITY FOR MARY LANNING HEALTHCARE. THE OTHER NEEDS THAT WERE IDENTIFIED THROUGH THE ASSESSMENT PROCESS THAT ARE NOT CURRENTLY BEING ADDRESSED INCLUDE: CARDIOVASCULAR, INJURY, ENVIRONMENTAL, DIABETES, COMMUNICABLE DISEASE, REPRODUCTIVE HEALTH AND ORAL HEALTH. IT IS ANTICIPATED THAT SEVERAL AREAS WILL OVERLAP AND ONE ACTIVITY MAY MEET THE STRATEGIC GOAL IN SEVERAL AREAS AND MAY HAVE A POSITIVE IMPACT ON NEEDS THAT ARE IDENTIFIED BUT NOT IN THE TOP FIVE PRIORITY AREAS. FOR EXAMPLE, ADDRESSING NUTRITION UNDER THE PRIORITY AREA OF OBESITY WOULD LOGICALLY HAVE AN IMPACT ON PREVALENCE OF DIABETES AND HEART DISEASE AS WELL AS INCREASING ACCESS TO CARE."

201723199349305457,210634462,"Part V, Section B","The Community Health Needs Assessment (CHNA) was conducted from February to October of 2016 with the purpose of gathering information about local health needs and health behaviors. The assessment used both primary and secondary research to illustrate and compare health trends and disparities across the region. Primary research solicited input from key community stakeholders representing the broad interests of the community, including experts in public health and individuals representing medically underserved, low-income, and minority populations. Secondary research identified demographic and health trends across geographic areas and populations. The Cooper Board of Trustees met on December 21, 2016 to review the findings of the CHNA and the recommended implementation strategy. The board voted to adopt the final summary report and the implementation strategy and provide the necessary resources and support to carry out the initiatives therein. Question 5: The Burlington, Camden, Gloucester, and Ocean County Health Departments participated in the design and completion of Cooper's Community Health Needs Assessment, including meetings to identify and prioritize health needs. Specific research methods: - A review of secondary health and socioeconomic indicators for the service area. - An analysis and comparison of hospital utilization data. - Partner forums with community representatives and leaders to identify community health priorities and facilitate population health strategy collaboration. - Focus groups with health consumers. Question 6: The Health Assessment Collaborative included the following partners: Cooper University Hospital, Deborah Heart and Lung Center, Kennedy Health System, Lourdes Health System, Virtua Health, and the Health Departments of Burlington, Camden, Gloucester, and Ocean Counties. Question 10A: WWW.COOPERHEALTH.ORG/SITES/COOPER/FILES/SITE/PDF/CHNA-2016.PDF Question 11: A voting system based on the criteria of scope, severity, and ability to impact was used to help participants in the assessment prioritize local health needs. The prioritized list of health needs is as follows: 1. behavioral health and chronic disease comorbidities 2. linkages to care - access 3. substance abuse Cooper is addressing the significant needs identified in the recently conducted CHNA as follows: Behavioral health/chronic disease comorbidities: -creation of an advanced care center with implementation of an innovative multidisciplinary group visit model -Patients with similar diagnoses meet together and learn best practices of care together -community education programs and support groups linkages to care - access: -partnered with a third party vendor to assist patients in completing applications for financial assistance, medicaid, etc. -trained staff as certified application counselors to assist patients in obtaining insurance -launched urgent care services in three locations -implemented dedicated schedule slots with primary care physicians to ensure available follow-up appointments for patients within two weeks after hospital discharge Substance abuse: -implemented standardized, systematic mental health screening for all patients admitted to Cooper -launched an initiative to address the gaps in behavioral health resources and identify partnership opportunities in service provision -hosted and supported many community events in collaboration with the county's addiction awareness task force Rationale for community health needs not specifically addressed: Cooper recognizes that partnerships with community agencies have the broadest reach to improve community health issues. While additional disease specific and population specific needs were identified, the group found that other resources, such as the Southern New Jersey Perinatal Cooperative and disease specific resources were available and the health systems would be more effective in utilizing the available resources in addressing the prioritized needs.

THE HOSPITAL IS AN ACTIVE PARTICIPANT IN THE FDRHPO'S NORTH COUNTRY HEALTH COMPASS PARTNERS (NCHCP), A COALITION OF MORE THAN 40 PUBLIC HEALTH DEPARTMENTS, HEALTHCARE FACILITIES AND AGENCIES, AND COMMUNITY-BASED ORGANIZATIONS WORKING TO IMPROVE THE REGION'S POPULATION HEALTH THROUGH COORDINATED SUPPORT OF NEW YORK STATE'S MANY POPULATION HEALTH IMPROVEMENT INITIATIVES. KEY WORK OF THE NCHCP IS TO ASSESS AND IMPROVE POPULATION HEALTH FOR THE 250,000 PEOPLE LIVING WITHIN THE TRI-COUNTY REGION, STRENGTHEN THE POPULATION HEALTH INFRASTRUCTURE, IMPROVE ACCESS TO PRIMARY AND PREVENTION CARE, AND FOCUS ON ELIMINATING HEALTH DISPARITIES. FDRHPO/NCHCP UNDERTOOK THE 2016 COMMUNITY HEALTH NEEDS ASSESSMENT. DATA ASSEMBLED FROM A VARIETY OF STATE, FEDERAL AND LOCAL SOURCES - INCLUDING A REGIONAL COMMUNITY SURVEY - WERE COMPARED AND EVALUATED TO IDENTIFY DISPARITIES AND SIGNIFICANT ISSUES IMPACTING REGIONAL, AS WELL AS COUNTY-WIDE, POPULATION HEALTH. THE 2016 CHNA FOR JEFFERSON COUNTY (SAMARITAN'S PRIMARY SERVICE AREA) WERE AS FOLLOWS: "" HIGH AND GROWING OBESITY RATES FOR ADULTS AND CHILDREN: TWO-THIRD OF ADULTS AND TWO-FIFTHS OF CHILDREN WERE IDENTIFIED AS OBESE OR OVERWEIGHT (2013-14 FIGURES). OBESITY IS A RISK FACTOR FOR HEART DISEASE, STROKE, CANCER IN MANY FORMS, DIABETES AND KIDNEY DISEASE, AND COULD OVERTAKE CANCER AS THE LEADING CAUSE OF PREVENTABLE DEATHS IN THE NEXT DECADE. "" HOSPITALIZATIONS FOR SHORT-TIME DIABETES COMPLICATIONS ALMOST DOUBLED BETWEEN 2011 AND 2014. "" THE CIGARETTE SMOKING RATE SHOWED A NON-SIGNIFICANT DECREASE SINCE THE LAST COMMUNITY ASSESSMENT, BUT REMAINS SIGNIFICANTLY HIGHER THAN THE NEW YORK STATE RATE. "" THE RATE OF COLORECTAL CANCER SCREENING REMAINED BELOW NYS TARGETS."" THE AREA'S SUICIDE RATE REMAINED HIGHER THAN STATEWIDE AND REGIONAL BENCHMARKS."" ADULTS REPORTING BINGE DRINKING GREW BY SIX PERCENTAGE POINTS BETWEEN 2011 AND 2014, WITH 2014 RATE MORE THAN 7% HIGHER THAN THE STATE RATE."" THE PERCENTAGE OF RESIDENTS SERVED BY OPTIMALLY FLUORIDATED COMMUNITY WATER SYSTEMS FELL FROM 79% TO 71% PERCENT BETWEEN 2012 AND 2015."" THE PERCENTAGE OF CHILDREN IN PUBLIC INSURANCE PROGRAMS WITH RECOMMENDED WELL-CHILD VISITS REMAINED LOWER COMPARED TO THE STATEWIDE AVERAGE, ALTHOUGH THE RATE FOR ALL AGE GROUPS INCREASED SIX PERCENTAGE POINTS."" DESPITE A SMALL DECREASE FROM 2011, THE 2014 PERCENTAGE OF UNINTENDED PREGNANCIES, AT 33% OF LIVE BIRTHS, REMAINED HIGHER THAN THE STATEWIDE AVERAGE OF 26.5%."" THE PERCENTAGE OF WOMEN AGED 13-17 WITH HPV IMMUNIZATIONS REMAINED LOW, WITH ONLY 15.9% IMMUNIZED COMPARED TO 30.3% FOR THE STATE EXCLUDING NEW YORK CITY."" ABOUT ONE-FIFTH OF JEFFERSON COUNTY RESIDENTS DO NOT HAVE A REGULAR HEALTH CARE PROVIDER. THIS IS HIGHER THAN THE STATEWIDE RATE OF 16%, AND WELL SHORT OF THE NEW YORK STATE'S PREVENTION AGENDA 2018 OBJECTIVE OF LESS THAN 10%. JEFFERSON COUNTY HAS FEWER PRIMARY CARE CLINICIANS PER POPULATION COMPARED TO THE STATEWIDE RATE.HOSPITALS AND COUNTY HEALTH DEPARTMENTS PARTICIPATING IN THE CHNA MET AT COUNTY LEVELS TO DISCUSS THE IDENTIFIED ISSUES AND PRIORITIZE NEEDS IN ALIGNMENT WITH THE NEW YORK STATE HEALTH DEPARTMENT'S PREVENTION AGENDA, CHOOSING SPECIFIC PRIORITIES TO MUTUALLY TACKLE. THESE COMMON PRIORITIES WERE THEN ADDRESSED BY EACH ORGANIZATION IN ITS OWN THREE-YEAR COMMUNITY SERVICE PLAN (CSP). IN DETERMINING WHICH PRIORITIES TO WORK ON, THESE COLLABORATING INSTITUTIONS CONSIDERED NOT ONLY THE ISSUES AND DISPARITIES, BUT THE IMPACT THESE DISPARITIES AND THEIR POSSIBLE SOLUTIONS MIGHT HAVE ON OTHER HEALTH OUTCOMES; AVAILABLE RESOURCES; EASE OF SOLUTION IMPLEMENTATION; LEADERSHIP SUPPORT AVAILABLE, AND IMPORTANCE TO THE PUBLIC HEALTH SYSTEM. ULTIMATELY, THOSE COMMUNITY NEEDS NOT DIRECTLY ADDRESSED IN THE COMMUNITY SERVICE PLAN WERE SIMPLY OF A LOWER PRIORITY, NOT ACHIEVABLE IN A REASONABLE TIMEFRAME OR DID NOT HAVE THE ADEQUATE RESOURCES AVAILABLE TO EFFECTIVELY IMPACT THE NEED. JEFFERSON COUNTY'S PUBLIC HEALTH DEPARTMENT AND THREE HOSPITALS AGREED TO WORK ON THE FOLLOWING TWO NYS PREVENTION AGENDA PRIORITIES DURING THE 2016-2018 CSP PERIOD: (1) PREVENT CHRONIC DISEASE, WITH A FOCUS ON REDUCING OBESITY IN CHILDREN AND ADULTS IN ORDER TO ADDRESS DISPARITIES RELATED TO HIGH OBESITY RATES AND DIABETES COMPLICATIONS AND (2) PROMOTE MENTAL HEALTH AND PREVENT SUBSTANCE ABUSE, WITH A FOCUS ON STRENGTHENING INFRASTRUCTURE ACROSS SYSTEMS, IN ORDER TO TACKLE DISPARITIES RELATED TO SUICIDE RATES AND SUBSTANCE ABUSE.SAMARITAN'S CSP OUTLINES THE FOLLOWING SPECIFIC ACTIVITIES, INTERVENTIONS AND STRATEGIES. TO REDUCE OBESITY, THE HOSPITAL WILL: (1) PROVIDE COMMUNITY-BASED NUTRITION EDUCATION AND HEALTHY COOKING DEMONSTRATION CLASSES TO THE PUBLIC THROUGH SAMARITAN'S NETWORK OF SEVEN COMMUNITY-BASED PRIMARY CLINICS LOCATED THROUGHOUT THE HOSPITAL'S SERVICE AREA AND (2) IMPLEMENT AN AMERICAN ACADEMY OF DIABETES EDUCATION-ACCREDITED DIABETES SELF-MANAGEMENT EDUCATION PROGRAM, OFFERING CLASSES TO DIABETES AND PRE-DIABETES PATIENTS AND THEIR FAMILY MEMBERS. TO STRENGTHEN BEHAVIORAL HEALTH INFRASTRUCTURE, SAMARITAN WILL: (1) SCREEN ALL PATIENTS AT EACH OF THE HOSPITAL'S SEVEN PRIMARY CLINICS AT LEAST ONCE ANNUALLY FOR DEPRESSION USING PHQ-2 AND PHQ-9 COMPONENTS OF THE PATIENT HEALTH QUESTIONNAIRE, AND ESTABLISH SCREENING, BRIEF INTERVENTION AND REFERRAL TO TREATMENT (SBIRT) PROCEDURES IN EACH CLINIC TO ENSURE PATIENTS ARE SCREENED FOR SUBSTANCE ABUSE RISK BEHAVIORS AND REFERRED FOR ADDITIONAL SERVICES AS NECESSARY AND (2) LOCATE A FULL- OR PART-TIME NYS-LICENSED CLINICAL SOCIAL WORKER (LCSW) IN EACH OF THE HOSPITAL'S SEVEN PRIMARY CARE CLINICS TO SUPPORT AND ASSIST MENTAL HEALTH PATIENTS AND THEIR FAMILIES. IN ADDITION TO THESE SPECIFIC ACTIVITIES, SAMARITAN WILL CONTINUE TO PARTICIPATE ON REGIONAL COMMITTEES AND IN INITIATIVES COORDINATED BY FDRHPO AND NCI THAT ADDRESS AREAS RELATIVE TO CHRONIC AND BEHAVIORAL HEALTH ISSUES, AS WELL AS PARTNER WITH THESE AND OTHER COMMUNITY PROVIDERS AND AGENCIES ON PROJECTS ADDRESSING ADDITIONAL REGIONAL POPULATION HEALTH CONCERNS THAT ARE NOT SPECIFICALLY TACKLED IN THE CURRENT CSP. THESE ONGOING ACTIVITIES INCLUDE PREVENTION AND AWARENESS EDUCATION ON THE REGION'S MOST PREVALENT CHRONIC DISEASES AND CONDITIONS, EARLY CANCER DETECTION SCREENINGS, SMOKING CESSATION CLASSES, PARTICIPATION IN AND SUPPORT FOR REGIONAL HEALTH CAMPAIGNS, PHYSICIAN RECRUITMENT/RETENTION ACTIVITIES, ADOPTION OF EVIDENCE-BASED MEDICAL AND CLINICAL IMPROVEMENTS TO ENHANCE PATIENT OUTCOMES, AND DEVELOPMENT OF TELEMEDICINE INFRASTRUCTURE AND TOOLS TO IMPROVE THE ACCESS OF OUR REGION'S RURAL, UNDER-SERVED POPULATION TO COST-EFFECTIVE, QUALITY HEALTH CARE."

The MHVC collaborative partners reviewed findings from the CHNA research, including input from community residents and health care providers and public health findings, to determine the highest priorities within Westchester County on which to focus community health improvement efforts. In alignment with the New York State Prevention Agenda, the partners selected the following health priorities to address during the next three year cycle: Prevent Chronic Diseases & Promote Mental Health and Prevent Substance Abuse.In coordination with the Westchester County Health Department and in alignment with the Delivery System Reform Incentive Payment (DSRIP) program, Saint Joseph's Medical Center will focus on two areas within Prevent Chronic Diseases: asthma and cardiovascular disease. SJMC is committed to addressing Westchester County's initiative to promote mental health and prevent substance abuse. Saint Joseph's operates Saint Vincent's Hospital Westchester, the largest behavioral health provider in Westchester County. With this expertise and long history of promoting comprehensive mental health and treating/preventing substance abuse, Saint Joseph's will continue to promote, support, and implement interventions and strategies to address behavioral health issues. See below for an outline of the plan.Prevention Agenda Priority: Prevent Chronic DiseaseGoals: - To ensure all patients with asthma access to care consistent with evidence-based medicine guidelines for asthma management.- Support implementation of evidence-based best practices for disease management in medical practice for adults with cardiovascular conditions.Specific Strategies and Process Measures:SJMC will assemble Project Teams for asthma and cardiovascular disease based on toolkits created by the MHVC. The Project Teams will be responsible for identifying community training/educational needs and improving access to care and quality improvement. Project Team members will be assigned specific tasks and responsibilities for measuring progress.SJMC will implement programs both internally and in the community to improve asthma and cardiovascular disease outcomes. Community-based programs will focus on building capacity to identify and self-manage conditions, targeting populations experiencing disparity. SJMC will work with providers, Medicaid Management Care Organizations, Health Homes, and community-based organizations to implement evidence-based guidelines and protocols. One program to be implemented by SJMC is the Million Hearts Campaign, an initiative co-led by the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention and the Centers for Medicare & Medicaid Services to improve heart disease outcomes.Hospital staff programming will increase the number of providers who are trained in patient self-management support principles and best practices for disease diagnosis, treatment, and management. A specific strategy to be implemented by SJMC is the National Heart, Lung and Blood Institute Expert Panel Report 3 (EPR 3) guidelines for asthma management. SJMC will also increase the number of providers who deliver a Chronic Disease Self-Management Program for people with hypertension.SJMC will develop and implement best practice protocols for the assessment and treatment of patients with asthma and cardiovascular disease and embed them in Electronic Medical Records (EMR). Records will be updated to monitor patient self-management goals and action plans, changes in disease progress, and updates from the care management team.Process measures for monitoring progress and community impact as a result of chronic disease initiatives include: Development and implementation of Asthma Action Plans that include patient monitoring of signs and symptoms and peak flow meter readings when appropriate, Documentation of collaboration with school nurses, teachers, school administrators, and day care centers to educate, assess, and treat school-age children with asthma, Embedded best practices for the diagnosis, treatment, and management of asthma in SJMC's EMR, Identification of asthma and cardiovascular disease Project Team members with determined tasks and responsibilities, Number of home/work/school environment assessments for smoking, allergenic materials, and other known asthma triggers, Number of patients that participate in a Chronic Disease Self-Management Program, Number of patients with asthma (and caregivers) participating in workshops to better manage their condition, Number of patients with documented self-management goals in their medical record, Percentage of MCOs and Health Homes actively engaged in care/treatment coordination with those patients served by SJMC, Percentage of primary care providers receiving training in evidence-based guidelines for asthma and cardiovascular disease diagnosis, treatment and management, Percentage of smokers referred to NYS Quit Line, and Percentage of staff trained/educated in patient self-management support principles and motivational interviewing.Prevention Agenda Priority: Promote Mental Health and Prevent Substance AbuseGoals:- Improve care coordination for behavioral health patients.- Increase the percentage of patients with depression whose condition is diagnosed.- Improve the integration of behavioral health and physical health services.Specific Strategies and Process Measures:In March of 2016, a full-time Social Worker was added to the Saint Joseph's Family Health Center Care Team to integrate behavioral health services within the primary care site and provide immediate therapy services. The Care Team delivery system enables providers to refer patients directly to the Social Worker via a warm handoff, lessening the stress and stigma attached with having to seek services at outside facilities.The Social Worker works with individuals and families to address both health and social issues. A detailed and comprehensive care plan is developed, inclusive of all Care Team members. The plan is transmitted to the New York State RHIO, a regional database that can be accessed by providers outside of Saint Joseph's community. Information sharing provides a safety net for instances when patients are not able to return to their primary care provider, or find themselves in an emergency situation.Patients with depression are targeted for the development of a comprehensive care plan. All patients are periodically screened for depression using approved evidence-based screening tools. Patients with a positive initial screening receive follow-up screening to determine the extent of their depression. The patient is then connected to a Social Worker for more intensive mental health services and programs as necessary.In early 2017, SJMC plans to expand the availability of Social Worker services to our nearby locations of Family Medicine and the Saint Vincent's Primary Care Clinic. By the 4th quarter of 2017, SJMC plans to enhance behavioral integration by adopting a model known as IMPACT. The model expands the Care Team with the addition of another Social Worker, a Depression Manager, and a Psychiatrist to consult with the primary care team. The model will allow for the treatment of more behavioral health patients and increased access to services.Process measures for monitoring progress and community impact as a result of behavioral health initiatives include: The integration of social workers into SJMC's Family Medicine and Saint Vincent's Primary Care Clinic locations, The number of care plans transmitted to the New York State RHIO, The number of patients connected with social workers and enrolled in comprehensive care plans, The number of patients screened for depression, and the number of patients with positive depression screenings who are referred to either a social worker or enhance mental health services, The number of patients who have benefited from the IMPACT model and additional services offered, The number of patients with documented self-management goals in their medical record, and Tracked medical outcomes (self-management skills, health status, and ED usage) as a result of care coordination efforts.The CHNA identified cancer care, adolescent care and domestic violence as priority areas to be addressed. The Hospital is not a cancer center, and does not provide adolescent care and therefore is unable to address these specific needs due to budgetary constraints. Although the Hospital does provide medical and psychiatric care to patients who have experienced domestic violence, the Hospital does not have the resources to address the cause of this specific need. However, any patient presenting to the Hospital who requires cancer therapy, adolescent care or counseling for domestic abuse is referred to the appropriate healthcare provider or social service agency."
201733149349303183,131624135,"PART V, LINE 5","A 54-question survey was developed through a collective effort by a five-member HSS CHNA steering committee, community partners, internal stakeholders and the public. The CHNA steering committee identified validated research questions to be addressed, drafted the individual survey questions, and identified community partners and internal stakeholders to review and provide input to survey development. Collaboration with the public, community partners and internal stakeholders was crucial to the success of this survey with valuable feedback provided on survey construction and length. In an effort to reach a culturally diverse community, the survey was translated into Spanish and Chinese using a culturally sensitive back translation approach. Below outlines the list of community partners involved in survey construction: . Arthritis Foundation New York Chapter . Clinical & Translational Science Center (CTSC) Weill Cornell Medicine . Memorial Sloan Kettering Cancer Center . New York Presbyterian Hospital . Lenox Hill Neighborhood House . Medicare Rights Center . NYC DOHMH Office of Policy, Planning and Strategic Data Use . New York City Department of Aging . S.L.E. Lupus Foundation . Self Help Innovative Senior . Isabella Geriatric . Touro College Graduate School of Social Work HSS facilitated systematic, scheduled input and feedback from its varied constituents internal stakeholders, the public, and community partners based on the CHNA results to guide the selection of the health needs and services to address in its community programming. Relevant national, state and city health data and needs assessment results were also utilized to drive community programming. Our approach in identifying, prioritizing and selecting significant health needs is described below: Input from Internal Stakeholders- Recognizing that the development of community health programming requires a concerted effort by all members of the organization, we involved various representatives from HSS departments. The knowledge and experience of physicians, nurses, social workers and other staff that have a vested interest in serving the community was essential in identifying and addressing the communitys health needs. An internal stakeholder meeting was held on May 26, 2016 with 15 HSS staff to discuss identified health priorities and explore areas for implementing initiatives, using results from the CHNA and stakeholders awareness of community needs to guide the discussion. The group discussed focusing on increasing access to high quality, culturally relevant chronic disease preventive care and management of musculoskeletal and rheumatologic conditions and reducing obesity in adults and children, which aligns with the NYSDOH CSP priority areas. Input from Community Partners- Feedback from community partner organizations was critical to driving the assessment and selection of public health priorities for the Hospital. Using results of the CHNA as the basis for discussion, HSS and its partners exchanged valuable information regarding community needs, explored areas for future collaboration, and solidified a mutual commitment to advancing public health. Furthermore, community partner knowledge of their respective community helped to identify gaps in community programming or more specifically, areas where HSS could use its areas of expertise to make a lasting public health impact. Overall, feedback from these meetings solidified the direction for programs that improve the communitys diet and increase physical activity to combat obesity among children and adults, examine specific communities in need of chronic disease preventive care and management of musculoskeletal and rheumatologic conditions, and provide culturally relevant education regarding musculoskeletal and rheumatologic issues. HSS met with the Greater New York Hospital Association (GNYHA), a trade association, to inform the structure and process for selecting its public health priorities. In-person meetings and conference calls with GNYHA were held on 07/21/15, 07/28/15, 01/15/16, 03/11/16, 04/8/16, 04/13/16, 04/28/16, and 05/09/16 to discuss the NYS DOH CSP requirements and federal requirements for the CHNA. HSS also attended one of the 29 community consultations hosted by the NYC DOHMH Take Care New York on January 26, 2016 in Central Harlem to foster continued partnership in improving health needs of New Yorkers. These community consultations provided New Yorkers the opportunity to rank health indicators outlined in the TCNY 2020, and discuss health goals of the community and resources that help meet these goals. Our involvement in this process provided valuable insight into the publics needs and helped in guiding the selection of public health needs to ensure it resonates with the health care needs of New Yorkers. In addressing the NYS prevention agenda, conference calls and in-person meetings were held with the NYCDOH on 03/21/16, 04/18/16 and 06/08/16 to explore areas of partnership. Furthermore, a community partners meeting was held on May 25, 2016. Nine individuals from the community partner organizations attended this meeting at which we shared the CHNA results, elicited feedback and ranked health issues according to the communities they serve. CHNA results were received positively and there was extensive discussion about how results accurately depicted the various communities served and how these results could be used to impact the community at large. Specifically, there were discussions about access to educational programs and ways in which HSS could extend the reach of its programs. Input from the General Public- To further HSS commitment to developing programs that improve community health, obtaining feedback from the public and patient community was also instrumental in driving the Hospitals selection of significant health needs. Our approach in soliciting input from the public is described below. Community Forums- Four community forums were held to allow community members an opportunity to prioritize health needs that provided HSS with the appropriate direction in selecting its public health priorities. The main communication channel for notifying the public about the forums were through flyers distributed at HSS community programs and outpatient clinics and posting on digital media (web, Facebook and twitter). In addition, announcements were made during public and patient programs held at HSS, and a poster was strategically placed in a high traffic area of the Hospital to publicize the meeting. Furthermore, in order to reach at-risk and minority populations, HSS partnered with Senior Centers in Manhattan and Chinatown to advertise community forums to their community members. Specific dates, locations, and attendance for these Community forums were as follows: . May 17, 2016 at Lenox Hill Neighborhood House, Manhattan (11 people present) . May 21, 2016 at the Living Healthy with Lupus Workshop, HSS (50 people present) . May 23, 2016 at Chinatown Community Center, Visiting Nurses Services New York (35 people present) . May 25, 2016 at the Senior Health and Fitness Day, HSS (17 people present) Community members were asked to rank the health needs most important to them and give their perspective on community health issues in an open discussion. Each significant health need identified in the CHNA results were ranked from 1 to 22. All rankings were added together across each location and health issues were re-ranked based on their overall score. Community health needs that were considered significant were ranked among the top five of identified needs, which are . Osteoarthritis/Osteoporosis/Rheumatoid Arthritis . Muscle, Bone and Joint Pain . Fatigue . Falls . Obesity"

Program 1: HSS Nursing Community Education Outreach Initiative This initiative targets underserved older adults living in the community. The programs overall goal is to deliver evidence-based educational content germane to issues appropriate for older adults. The quality educational sessions use teaching strategies and educational principles deigned to improve knowledge, skills and confidence to manage and prevent chronic diseases. Educational lectures are mainly delivered by HSS nursing staff, and topics are selected based upon needs assessment results and participant feedback, such as management of chronic conditions (i.e. osteoarthritis, osteoporosis and rheumatoid arthritis), falls prevention, nutrition and medication safety. The anticipated program impact includes increase in knowledge about managing their chronic conditions, maintaining a healthy lifestyle, identifying increased risk of falls and preventing likelihood of falls. Program 2: Musculoskeletal Health Wellness Initiative (MHI) To address the public health issue of musculoskeletal conditions, HSS developed the Musculoskeletal Health Wellness Initiative (MHI), comprised of educational and exercise programs, to raise awareness, educate and reduce the impact of musculoskeletal conditions in the community. The initiative offers lectures, workshops and webinars about musculoskeletal health specific topics such as osteoarthritis, osteoporosis, and rheumatoid arthritis and some of the symptoms associated with these conditions (falls, fatigue, stiffness, and muscle, bone and joint pain), in addition to maintaining a healthy lifestyle. The exercise component of the initiative is comprised of weekly exercise classes such as Yoga, Pilates, Tai Chi, Dance, and Yogalates specifically designed for individuals that are suffering from or at risk of musculoskeletal and rheumatologic conditions. The anticipated program impact includes improved musculoskeletal health by decreasing musculoskeletal pain, stiffness, fatigue and falls, and increasing frequency of physical activity and self-efficacy. Program 3: Pain and Stress Management Series In response to the lack of confidence in managing chronic conditions, and mental health issues identified in the CHNA, HSS developed the pain and stress management series. This is comprised of educational, and mindfulness based coping techniques to raise awareness, educate and improve the ability to cope with pain and stress. This program offers mind/body workshops, exercises such as Yoga, and expert-guided meditation to help reduce physical and mental stressors. All the educational programs are taught by experienced physicians, nurses, physical and occupational therapists, while Yoga workshops are led by certified yoga instructors. The anticipated program impact includes improving confidence in managing chronic conditions and its symptoms such as pain, and improving ability to cope with stress. Program 4: HSS Asian Community Bone Health Initiative In response to the health needs of the growing number of Asian older adults living in NYCs Chinatown community and the CHNA results where Asians reported that they were told by their doctor to engage in more physical activity, HSS developed the Asian Community Bone Health Initiative (ACBHI). The overall goal of this initiative is to improve Asian seniors management of their chronic musculoskeletal conditions (such as osteoarthritis and osteoporosis) and its symptoms (e.g. falls, stiffness, fatigue, muscle bone and joint pain) while also increasing access to care in this medically underserved community. The ACBHI is comprised of culturally relevant musculoskeletal health lectures and workshops, self-management education, yoga and low impact chair exercise programs. The anticipated program impact includes improved musculoskeletal health by decreasing musculoskeletal pain, stiffness, fatigue and falls, and increasing frequency of physical activity and self-efficacy. Program 5: Resident Geriatric Training Program This program is designed to enhance communication skills of third-year orthopedic surgery residents with older adults that are suffering from or at risk of musculoskeletal and rheumatologic conditions. The program includes meetings with the Program Coordinator, a licensed social worker, for the residents to explore their attitudes toward older patients, weekly resident rounds for selected residents to present and illustrate specific geriatric needs, and presentations to participants of the HSS Greenberg Academy for Successful Aging. Presentations cover topics such as management of musculoskeletal conditions (i.e. osteoarthritis and osteoporosis) and some of the symptoms associated with these conditions (such as muscle, back, bone and joint pain), and falls prevention. The anticipated program impact includes improving the ability of older adults to manage their musculoskeletal conditions and symptoms and improved doctor/patient communication. Program 6: VOICES 60+ Senior Advocacy Program This program was launched in recognition of the multiple challenges older adults face in effectively utilizing high quality chronic disease care to optimize health outcomes, and access needed social support, particularly for those who are from low-income and Spanish speaking communities. VOICES 60+ is designed to enhance the medical care experience of low income, ethnically diverse (primarily Hispanic) HSS patients 60 and older in these areas. The program helps patients to navigate and access support, education and communication resources needed to manage their rheumatologic or musculoskeletal conditions and its symptoms to improve their quality of life. In addition, the program provides services focused on identifying and addressing communication barriers between older adult patients and healthcare providers to optimize health outcomes. Anticipated program impact includes improved provider/patient communication that will enhance communication skills of older adults and management of rheumatologic or musculoskeletal conditions and its symptoms. Program 7: Rheumatoid Arthritis (RA) Support and Education Programs This initiative addresses the psychoeducational needs of community members and their families living with long-standing rheumatoid arthritis, and for people newly diagnosed. These monthly programs feature a lecture on an RA-specific topic its management, presented by healthcare professionals, and are followed by a support group, co-facilitated by a social worker and a rheumatology nurse. Anticipated program impact includes enhancing self-management skills and self-efficacy around managing RA and its symptoms. Program 8: LANtern Lupus Asian Network In response to the CHNA results highlighting health disparities in the Asian community specifically related to lupus, HSS has implemented LANtern, which is a national model for support and education of Asian Americans with lupus and their families. LANtern is the only hospital based support and education program designed specifically for Asians/Asian Americans with lupus. Through its bilingual (Chinese) SupportLine, publications, community and professional programs, and capacity building, the program seeks to enhance awareness, understanding, coping and knowledge for Asian Americans with lupus and their loved ones. Anticipated program impact includes increased knowledge about high quality preventive care for the Asian community and improved clinical management of lupus and its symptoms. Program 9: Charla de Lupus/Lupus Chat The Charla de Lupus/Lupus Chat (""Charla"") program addresses health disparities among African Americans and Latinos with lupus according to the CHNA findings. This social work led program engages and trains peer volunteers to become empowering role models by providing culturally relevant strategies to help increase understanding of this complex illness and its treatment, improve medical adherence, and enhance coping and healthy behaviors. Comprehensive bilingual (English/Spanish) services include: the Charla Line, a toll-free national support and education helpline; weekly Onsite Peer Support Outreach at four hospital-based clinics, monthly Charla Teen and Parent Lupus Chat Groups; numerous community, professional education and government collaborations. Anticipated program impact includes increased knowledge and self-management skills of lupus and its symptoms.

201743149349301614,135564934,"SCHEDULE H, PART V, LINE 5","A key philosophy of the CNA is recognizing that both quantitative data and qualitative data are crucial to a comprehensive assessment of community need in the Mount Sinai Performing Providers System (PPS) proposed service area. This area includes five boroughs in NYC (Brooklyn, Bronx, Manhattan, Queens, and Staten Island), as well as Westchester County. The population examined in the CNA includes the overall New York State population and in particular the New York City population. The New York City population accounts for 43% of New York States population. New York City population has a greater proportion of African Americans, Asians, Latinos, and multi-racial residents than the rest of the state, with nearly half of the population speaking a language other than English. With respect to income and education, Manhattan residents have the highest income as well as the highest high school and college graduation rates, while those in the Bronx account for the lowest income and lowest college graduation rates. The populations in Queens and the Bronx have the highest illiteracy rates. Unemployment rates are the highest in the Bronx and Brooklyn. The population living below the poverty level is greatest in the Bronx, followed by Brooklyn, Manhattan, and Queens, and Staten Island. In particular, housing and homelessness is widespread in New York City. The CNA also has data on all-payer populations, which includes Medicaid beneficiaries. Brooklyn Medicaid beneficiaries account for a third of the total citywide Medicaid population with more than 1.2 enrollees. Brooklyn and the Bronx have more Medicaid beneficiaries in the ages of 18-44, while Queens has more Medicaid members who are seniors. The populations studied included a cross section of residents and organizations covering all five boroughs with a concentration on people with limited means and medical coverage. The study did include all relevant types of payers including government sponsored, private insurance and self-pay (self-pay includes patients that would require financial assistance from the hospital). Initially, we used quantitative measures available in the states data books and other identified data sources that align with the DSRIP metrics for measuring the success of each project. We also used data that PPS stakeholders designated as critical for successful project planning and execution. In addition, existing CNAs conducted by Mount Sinai PPS hospital partners were examined for this analysis. Data for about 500 indicators was collected from a wide range of data sources, including the Census, SPARCS, Epiquery, Salient Dashboards, and other publicly available data sources. These indicators fall under the following categories: Demographics, Mortality, Hospitalizations, Barriers to Accessing Health Care, Health Care Resources, and Community Resources. The extensive quantitative data collected provides a wealth of comprehensive information on the health status and community needs in the PPS service area. For this assessment, PPS providers and community members in the Mount Sinai PPS service area were surveyed to confirm and validate quantitative feedback identified through the data analysis. The provider surveys also address any resource gaps, such as a lack of adequate behavioral health providers to meet the needs identified in the CNA, present among our providers. Partners and stakeholders were surveyed from October through November 2014 through Survey Monkey, an online survey tool. In addition to completing web-based surveys, stakeholder engagement groups were convened with community based organizations in each borough, which included local neighborhood and council participants, borough presidents, advocacy groups and social services organizations. These discussion forums covered participants representing the spectrum of services within the PPS, further detailed in the Appendix, and even included a large proportion of non-PPS representation. Town hall style forums were conducted in each borough to gather more qualitative information, validate findings and solicit additional input. Beyond these community based forums, the CNA was also posted online for public input and commentary. Organizations represented in this process covered special populations, i.e. substance abuse, behavioral health, HIV, seniors and persons with disabilities, as well as representatives of low-income housing, homecare, outreach workers, community social works, legal aid, public health providers, homeless shelters, transitional housing, foster care and EMS. The intent was to capture as broad a set of inputs as possible, using pre-established community forums and advocacy groups that had trusted thought leaders from the community. Once data was gathered from the various data sources and the accompanied survey, we conducted a thorough analysis of the current state of the community, summary of provider organizations, and review of the populations health care needs. The CNA focused on the health needs in the service area and includes analyses by population for the Medicaid, duals, uninsured and all-payer populations. By comparing the indicators of these payer groups, we can examine the health disparities between those with access to coverage and those without. Quantitative data were selected based on their alignment with the DSRIP metrics and milestones for each domain and project category. To the extent possible, data sources with statewide, citywide, borough, and county-level data were selected. Details on the data, including the definition of the indicator, data source, year(s), geography, location, and data type, were compiled in a standardized template. Data were then collected and verified as being accurate and reproducible to their source. Throughout the CNA process, we engaged partners and the public in meaningful dialogue to better understand community needs, challenges and barriers to accessing care, and disparities in service provision and health outcomes. To ensure full transparency, we provided multiple opportunities for feedback and input through document review, survey instruments, webinar, and local meetings. The Mount Sinai PPS Clinical Committee and subgroups were intimately involved in selecting health care indicators, vetting gathered data, and evaluating the analysis. An analysis of topline results from the data was shared with our partners at the Mount Sinai PPS October 16th Town Hall to gather insights. Provider feedback from this event was distributed to planning committees the following week to be more closely vetted and incorporated into project planning. To engage our provider partners in the development of the CNA, we had providers form breakout groups in the following categories: Post-Acute Care Transitions, Disease Management, Care Coordination and Patient Engagement, and Behavioral Health and Primary Care Integration. These small groups were then instructed to brainstorm data points they felt the CNA should include based on those key strategies. Providers suggested a wide range of data needs, including measures showing patients' access to stable housing, service coordination with the criminal justice system, and the impact of trauma on patients. These suggestions were compiled, posted on the PPS website, and incorporated into the CNA survey. Qualitative data were derived from Mount Sinai PPS provider partner survey results, which collected on-the-ground insights from providers on key community health needs and barriers to accessing care. Respondents answered 62 questions divided into six components: Organizational Information, Access to Health Care Services, Care Coordination, Population Health, Health Care Barriers, and Patient Centered Medical Homes. Of the approximately 200 parent organization and unique standalone organizations in our PPS, 190 completed and submitted a survey. Many stakeholder organizations contributed to the CNA, including The Brooklyn Hospital Center, several federally qualified health centers, such as William F. Ryan Community Health Center. ArchCare, Coordinated Behavioral Care IPA network member agencies, and Visiting Nurse Service of New York were additional respondents. (See Appendix A of the CNA, which can be found on our website at http://www.mountsinai.org/locations/mount-sinai/about/community, for a complete list.) In addition, the PPS asked providers to complete a comprehensive survey which captured data on provider readiness and gaps in care. Input and dialogue was encouraged through PPS committee meetings and local community boards. A critical aspect of these local meetings was to review and discuss findings from the qualitative data analysis. The feedback received was incorporated into the qualitative analysis and included in the CNA. Furthermore, the general public, including community leaders, were invited to comment on topline CNA results posted on the PPS webpage, distributed through PPS listserv, and noted in the PPS weekly newslette"

IN 2015, ALL FIVE ADVOCATE HEALTH CARE HOSPITALS PRINCIPALLY SERVING COOK COUNTY, INCLUDING ADVOCATE CHRIST MEDICAL CENTER, WERE FOUNDING MEMBERS OF THE HEALTH IMPACT COLLABORATIVE OF COOK COUNTY (HICCC). HICCC IS A BEST PRACTICE COMMUNITY HEALTH INITIATIVE INVOLVING 26 HOSPITALS, 7 HEALTH DEPARTMENTS AND NEARLY 100 COMMUNITY-BASED ORGANIZATIONS. THE GOAL OF THIS COLLABORATIVE IS TO WORK TOGETHER ON A COUNTY-WIDE HEALTH ASSESSMENT AND COMMON IMPLEMENTATION STRATEGIES ONCE PRIORITIES ARE IDENTIFIED. THE ILLINOIS PUBLIC HEALTH INSTITUTE (IPHI) SERVED AS THE BACKBONE ORGANIZATION FOR THE COLLABORATIVE-PROVIDING FACILITATION, DATA COORDINATION AND REPORT PREPARATION ACTIVITIES. GIVEN THE SIZE AND DIVERSITY OF COOK COUNTY, THE COLLABORATIVE CREATED THREE REGIONS-NORTH, CENTRAL AND SOUTH-FOR PURPOSES OF ORGANIZING THE ASSESSMENT PROCESS. CHRIST MEDICAL CENTER WAS APPROPRIATELY ASSIGNED TO THE SOUTH REGION CONSISTING OF BOTH THE SOUTH SIDE OF CHICAGO AND THE SOUTH SUBURBS OF COOK COUNTY. A REGIONAL LEADERSHIP TEAM WAS FORMED INCLUDING REPRESENTATIVES FROM THE HOSPITALS AND HEALTH DEPARTMENTS IN THE REGION. A REGIONAL STAKEHOLDER GROUP WAS ALSO ORGANIZED INCLUDING MEMBERS OF COMMUNITY ORGANIZATIONS REPRESENTING VARIOUS SECTORS. FROM FEBRUARY 2015 THROUGH JUNE OF 2016, THE COLLABORATIVE COMPLETED AN EXTENSIVE COMMUNITY HEALTH NEEDS ASSESSMENT PROCESS WITHIN EACH OF THE THREE REGIONS USING THE PUBLIC HEALTH PROCESS-MAPP-MOBILIZING FOR ACTION THROUGH PARTNERSHIPS AND PLANNING. ADDITIONALLY, FOR PURPOSES OF THE 2014-2016 CHNA CYCLE, THE HOSPITAL FORMED A COMMUNITY HEALTH COUNCIL (COUNCIL) CONSISTING OF 25 COMMUNITY AND MEDICAL CENTER LEADERS. THIS COUNCIL, IN PARTNERSHIP WITH THE COMMUNITY HEALTH DEPARTMENT, WAS CONVENED TO OVERSEE THE ASSESSMENT. DATA FROM THE HEALTH IMPACT COLLABORATIVE OF COOK COUNTY WAS PRESENTED TO THE COUNCIL INCLUDING THE HICCC PRIORITY-SETTING PROCESS THAT IDENTIFIED SOCIAL DETERMINANTS OF HEALTH, MENTAL HEALTH AND SUBSTANCE ABUSE, ACCESS TO CARE AND CHRONIC DISEASE AS THE FOUR COUNTY-WIDE PRIORITIES. ALL HOSPITALS THAT PARTICIPATED IN HICCC AGREED TO ACCEPT SOCIAL DETERMINANTS AS ONE OF THEIR PRIORITIES, WITH CHRIST MEDICAL CENTER IDENTIFYING THAT ONE OF THEIR STRATEGIES WITHIN THIS PRIORITY WOULD BE VIOLENCE PREVENTION. IN ADDITION, MULTIPLE INDICATORS FROM THE HEALTHY COMMUNITIES INSTITUTE (HCI) DATA PLATFORM WERE SHARED WITH THE CHRIST MEDICAL CENTERS COMMUNITY HEALTH COUNCIL. MANY OF THESE INDICATORS WERE PARTICULARLY USEFUL TO THE ASSESSMENT BECAUSE THE HOSPITALIZATION AND EMERGENCY ROOM VISIT RATES WERE AVAILABLE BY ZIP CODE, THUS PERMITTING A DEEPER LOOK INTO THE HEALTH STATUS OF THE MEDICAL CENTERS PRIMARY SERVICE AREA (PSA). A CONSENSUS VOTING PROCESS WAS USED WITH THE COUNCIL TO SELECT THE SECOND AND THIRD PRIORITIES FOR THE 2014-2016 CHNA CYCLE-ASTHMA AND DIABETES. CANCER, HEART DISEASE AND HYPERTENSION (STROKE) WERE NOT SELECTED PRIMARILY BECAUSE THE MEDICAL CENTER ALREADY HAS INSTITUTES ADDRESSING EACH OF THESE IMPORTANT HEALTH NEEDS. THE THREE PRIORITIES SELECTED BY CHRIST MEDICAL CENTER ARE VIOLENCE PREVENTION, ASTHMA AND DIABETES. IN 2014, ADVOCATE HEALTH CARE BEGAN ORGANIZING RESOURCES TO IMPLEMENT THE 2014-2016 CHNA CYCLE. THE SYSTEM SIGNED A THREE-YEAR CONTRACT WITH THE HEALTHY COMMUNITIES INSTITUTE (HCI), NOW A XEROX COMPANY, TO PROVIDE AN INTERNET-BASED DATA RESOURCE FOR THEIR ELEVEN HOSPITALS DURING THE 2014-2016 CHNA CYCLE. THIS ROBUST PLATFORM OFFERED THE HOSPITALS 171 HEALTH AND DEMOGRAPHIC INDICATORS INCLUDING THIRTY-ONE (31) HOSPITALIZATION AND EMERGENCY DEPARTMENT (ED) VISIT INDICATORS AT THE SERVICE AREA AND ZIP CODE LEVELS. IN ADDITION, SYSTEM LEADERS COLLABORATED WITH THE STRATEGIC PLANNING DEPARTMENT TO CREATE SETS OF DEMOGRAPHIC, MORTALITY AND UTILIZATION DATA FOR EACH HOSPITAL SITE. THIS COLLABORATION WITH STRATEGIC PLANNING CONTINUED DURING THE THREE-YEAR CYCLE ENSURING THAT EACH HOSPITAL SITE HAD DETAILED INPATIENT, OUTPATIENT AND EMERGENCY DEPARTMENT DATA FOR ITS SITE. BY THE END OF 2014, A NEW DEPARTMENT OF COMMUNITY HEALTH WAS ESTABLISHED UNDER MISSION AND SPIRITUAL CARE, A VICE-PRESIDENT NAMED TO LEAD THE DEPARTMENT, AND A PLAN DEVELOPED TO ENSURE THAT EACH HOSPITAL IN THE SYSTEM WOULD HAVE A COMMUNITY HEALTH EXPERT TO COORDINATE ITS COMMUNITY HEALTH WORK. THIS NEW SYSTEM LEVEL DEPARTMENT EXPANDED STAFFING RESOURCES AT CHRIST MEDICAL CENTER BY ADDING A NEW COORDINATOR POSITION DEDICATED TO THE MEDICAL CENTER AND THE POSITION OF SOUTH REGION DIRECTOR FOR CHRIST MEDICAL CENTER, AND TRINITY AND SOUTH SUBURBAN HOSPITALS. COMMUNITY HEALTH COUNCIL CHRIST MEDICAL CENTER, IN COLLABORATION WITH ADVOCATE CHILDRENS HOSPITAL, CONVENED A COMMUNITY HEALTH COUNCIL TO OVERSEE ITS COMPREHENSIVE COMMUNITY HEALTH NEEDS ASSESSMENT.

201733179349302768,362169147,CULTURAL HEALTH DISPARITIES,"SINCE 2011, LUTHERAN GENERAL HOSPITAL HAS HAD A STRATEGIC FOCUS ON IDENTIFYING UNIQUE HEALTH NEEDS OF CULTURAL/ETHNIC GROUPS AND DEVELOPING PROGRAMS TO MEET THOSE NEEDS. CULTURAL AND ETHNIC INITIATIVES HAVE EXPANDED OVER THE YEARS, SO THE COUNCIL DID NOT FEEL ADDITIONAL FOCUS ON CULTURAL HEALTH DISPARITIES WAS NECESSARY FOR THE 2011-2013 CHNA. AN EXAMPLE IS THE DEVELOPMENT OF CULTURAL OR PATIENT NAVIGATOR POSITIONS FOR THE KOREAN (2011) AND POLISH (2012) PATIENTS. RESPONSIBILITIES INCLUDE CREATING CULTURALLY COMPETENT CARE, ROUNDING ON PATIENTS, CONDUCTING CULTURE SPECIFIC NEEDS ASSESSMENTS AND DEVELOPING PROGRAMS TO ADDRESS THE MOST SIGNIFICANT HEALTH NEEDS IDENTIFIED AND PROVIDING HEALTH EDUCATION IN THE COMMUNITY AND MEDIA. A CHNA OF THE KOREAN AMERICAN COMMUNITY WAS COMPLETED IN DECEMBER 2014 WITH HANUL FAMILY ALLIANCE. DISSEMINATION AND PROMOTION OF THOSE CHNA FINDINGS WAS DONE IN 2015 AND 2016. MULTIPLE KOREAN PROGRAMS WERE IMPLEMENTED IN RESPONSE TO THESE FINDINGS. THE PROGRAMS INCLUDED COMMUNITY HEALTH LECTURES AND DIABETES MANAGEMENT CLASSES. IN 2015-2016, LUTHERAN GENERAL HOSPITAL ADDRESSED ANOTHER CULTURAL HEALTH DISPARITY BY PARTICIPATING IN A NATIONAL INITIATIVE OF GRADUATE MEDICAL PROGRAMS TO IMPROVE HEALTH EQUITY. THE HOSPITAL PARTNERED WITH A FAITH COMMUNITY TO IMPLEMENT A DIABETES PREVENTION PROGRAM TARGETED TO THE HISPANIC POPULATION IN THE 60018 ZIP CODE OF DES PLAINES, ILLINOIS. THIS ZIP CODE HAS THE HIGHEST PERCENTAGE OF HISPANICS IN THE HOSPITALS PSA (34 PERCENT). THE 60018 AREA ALSO HAD BEEN IDENTIFIED AS A HIGH-RISK COMMUNITY FOR DIABETES AND LONG-TERM COMPLICATIONS. THE HOSPITAL ADMINISTERED A SURVEY TO HISPANIC PARISHIONERS, ADMINISTERED PRE- AND POST-ASSESSMENTS AND HELD A FOUR-WEEK DIABETES MANAGEMENT CLASS. ADDITIONALLY, A GRANT WAS RECEIVED THAT ENABLED THE HOSPITAL TO HIRE A COMMUNITY HEALTH WORKER TO SUPPORT THE CONGREGATION AND THE DES PLAINES COMMUNITY TO CONTINUE TO REDUCE DIABETES PREVALENCE WITHIN THE COMMUNITY. 2014-2016 CHNA THE HOSPITALS COMMUNITY HEALTH COUNCIL MET QUARTERLY FOR THE 2014-2016 CHNA PROCESS. THERE WERE TWO ADDITIONAL MEETINGS IN 2016 FOR DATA REVIEW AND PRIORITIZATION OF HEALTH NEEDS. THE COMMUNITY HEALTH COUNCIL SELECTED THE THREE NEEDS OUTLINED BELOW FOR HOSPITAL ACTION. LUTHERAN GENERAL HOSPITALS HEALTH NEEDS SELECTED TO ADDRESS IMPROVE HEALTH LITERACY IN THE LUTHERAN GENERAL HOSPITAL PRIMARY SERVICE AREA (PSA) HEALTH LITERACY IS DEFINED AS THE DEGREE TO WHICH INDIVIDUALS HAVE THE CAPACITY TO OBTAIN, PROCESS, AND UNDERSTAND BASIC HEALTH INFORMATION AND SERVICES NEEDED TO MAKE APPROPRIATE HEALTH DECISIONS (NATIONAL ACTION PLAN TO IMPROVE HEALTH LITERACY, 2010). LUTHERAN GENERAL HOSPITAL, IN PARTNERSHIP WITH ADVOCATE CHILDRENS HOSPITAL, COMMITTED TO ENGAGE LOCAL SCHOOL DISTRICTS IN IMPLEMENTING THE NEMOURS FOUNDATIONS NAVIGATING THE HEALTH CARE SYSTEM, A HEALTH LITERACY CURRICULUM. THE HOSPITALS WILL ALSO PARTNER WITH PHYSICIANS TO IMPLEMENT THE AHRQ (AGENCY FOR HEALTHCARE RESEARCH AND QUALITY) HEALTH LITERACY ASSESSMENT AND RECOMMENDATIONS WITHIN THE PRIMARY CARE SETTING. REDUCE THE RISK OF HEART ATTACK AND/OR STROKE IN IRVING PARK (60641), AN IDENTIFIED HIGH-RISK COMMUNITY IRVING PARK (60641) WAS IDENTIFIED AS ONE OF LUTHERAN GENERAL HOSPITALS HIGHEST SOCIO-NEEDS COMMUNITIES AS DEFINED BY HEALTHY COMMUNITIES INSTITUTE (HCI). HCI IS A PROPRIETARY FORMULA THAT EVALUATES COMMUNITIES BY SIX MAJOR SOCIO-NEEDS INDICATORS: INCOME, UNEMPLOYMENT, OCCUPATION, EDUCATION, LANGUAGE, AND POVERTY. SOCIOECONOMIC NEED WAS DETERMINED BY THE HEALTHY COMMUNITIES INSTITUTES (HCI) CALCULATIONS TO CREATE AN INDEX USING SIX MAJOR SOCIO-NEEDS INDICATORS THAT ARE CORRELATED WITH POOR HEALTH OUTCOMES. THE INDICATORS INCLUDE INCOME, UNEMPLOYMENT, OCCUPATION, EDUCATION, LANGUAGE, AND POVERTY. THIS COMMUNITY ALSO HAD A HIGH RATE OF CARDIOVASCULAR DISEASE INCLUDING HEART FAILURE, HYPERTENSION AND CORONARY HEART DISEASE. LUTHERAN GENERAL HOSPITAL COMMITTED TO PARTNER WITH PRESENCE RESURRECTION MEDICAL CENTER AND THE IRVING PARK FOOD PANTRY TO: (1) TRACK THE BLOOD PRESSURE OF ADULTS UTILIZING THE IRVING PARK FOOD PANTRY; 2) PROVIDE CARDIOVASCULAR HEALTH EDUCATION WITH EVALUATION OF EFFECTIVENESS; (3) PROVIDE MONTHLY AMERICAN HEART ASSOCIATIONS EMPOWERED TO SERVE CURRICULUM (ETS) IN ENGLISH AND SPANISH; AND (4) TRAIN COMMUNITY MEMBERS TO TEACH THE EMPOWERED TO SERVE CURRICULUM. THE HOSPITALS ALSO WILL UTILIZE THE AMERICAN HEART ASSOCIATIONS ""COMMITMENT TO BUILDING A CULTURE OF HEALTH"" STRATEGY. THE STRATEGY WILL BE USED TO ENGAGE COMMUNITY PARTNERS IN DEVELOPING ACTION PLANS TO INCREASE HEALTHY VENDING OPTIONS. TO INCREASE INTERNSHIPS AND JOB OPPORTUNITIES FOR MAINE TOWNSHIP DISTRICT 207 LOW-INCOME YOUTH (STUDENTS AGES 16-24 YEARS OF AGE) AS PART OF ITS COMMITMENT TO ADDRESS THE SOCIAL DETERMINANTS OF HEALTH, LUTHERAN GENERAL HOSPITAL WILL PARTNER WITH ADVOCATE CHILDRENS HOSPITAL. THE SHARED PROJECT WILL INCREASE JOB OPPORTUNITIES AND CAREER READINESS FOR LOW-INCOME STUDENTS THROUGH EXPANSION OF THE JUMPSTART PROGRAM AT BOTH HOSPITALS, AS RESOURCES PERMIT. THE HOSPITALS ALSO WILL COLLABORATE WITH THE PARK RIDGE, NILES AND DES PLAINES CHAMBERS OF COMMERCE TO INCREASE THE NUMBER OF BUSINESSES/ORGANIZATIONS IN THE COMMUNITY THAT OFFER INTERNSHIPS AND/OR JOB OPPORTUNITIES TO JUMPSTART PARTICIPANTS. ADVOCATE CHILDRENS HOSPITALS HEALTH NEEDS SELECTED IN THE 2014-2016 CHNA, ADVOCATE CHILDRENS HOSPITAL IDENTIFIED THREE COMMUNITY HEALTH NEEDS AS OUTLINED BELOW. IMPROVE HEALTH LITERACY IN THE LUTHERAN GENERAL PRIMARY SERVICE AREA (PSA) THIS ITEM IS DESCRIBED ABOVE IN LUTHERAN GENERAL HOSPITALS HEALTH NEEDS SELECTED SECTION. BECOME A TRAUMA-INFORMED CHILDREN'S HOSPITAL ADVOCATE CHILDRENS HOSPITAL HAS A GOAL TO BECOME THE FIRST TRAUMA-INFORMED CHILDRENS HOSPITAL IN THE METROPOLITAN CHICAGO AREA. ADDITIONALLY, THE HOSPITAL WILL FURTHER THE PARTNERSHIP WITH THE ADVERSE CHILDHOOD EXPERIENCES (ACE) PROGRAM OF THE HEALTH AND MEDICINE POLICY RESEARCH GROUP TO DETERMINE BEST PRACTICES FOR TRAINING THE HOSPITAL'S CLINICAL TEAM REGARDING ACES AND THEIR IMPACT ON HEALTH OUTCOMES. THE CHILDRENS HOSPITAL WILL ALSO WORK CLOSELY WITH THE CHICAGO DEPARTMENT OF PUBLIC HEALTH TO PROVIDE ASSISTANCE IN REACHING ITS HEALTHY CHICAGO 2.0 GOAL OF BECOMING A TRAUMA-INFORMED CITY, AND WITH ILLINOIS SENATOR DICK DURBIN TO SUPPORT LEGISLATION TO FURTHER TRAUMA-INFORMED CARE FOR CHILDREN. PROVIDE SCHOOL-BASED HEALTH CARE SERVICES TO HIGH RISK, LOW-INCOME CHILDREN IN THE NORTH REGION OF THE MEDICAID MANAGED CARE PROGRAM ADVOCATE CHILDREN'S HOSPITAL PLANS TO OFFER TARGETED, SCHOOL-BASED HEALTH SERVICES TO HIGH RISK, LOW-INCOME CHILDREN IN THE NORTH REGION. SERVICES WILL INCLUDE PRIMARY MEDICAL CARE, IMMUNIZATIONS, ASTHMA AND WEIGHT MANAGEMENT, WELLNESS AND HEALTH EDUCATION. ADVOCATE CHILDRENS HOSPITAL WILL WORK CLOSELY WITH THE HEALTHY SCHOOLS CAMPAIGN AND THE CHICAGO PUBLIC SCHOOLS TO DEVELOP AND PILOT A SUSTAINABLE AND REPLICABLE MODEL FOR THE DELIVERY OF COMPREHENSIVE AND COORDINATED HEALTH SERVICES IN SCHOOLS, WITH PLANS FOR EXPANSION TO THE SUBURBAN AREA. THE MODEL WILL INCLUDE AN INTEGRATED TEAM OF CHILDRENS HOSPITAL CLINICIANS AND SCHOOL STAFF WORKING COLLABORATIVELY TO CREATE AN OVERALL ENVIRONMENT TO PROMOTE HEALTH AND WELLNESS AMONG STUDENTS, THEIR FAMILIES AND SCHOOL STAFF. UNDER THIS MODEL, SCHOOLS BECOME AN IMPORTANT DELIVERY POINT FOR SCREENING, PREVENTION AND DISEASE MANAGEMENT SERVICES TO SUPPORT CHILDRENS PHYSICAL, MENTAL AND BEHAVIORAL HEALTH. THE CHILDREN'S HOSPITAL WILL PILOT THE PROGRAM IN SELECT SCHOOLS THAT HAVE A HIGH PERCENTAGE OF MEDICAID MANAGED CARE PATIENTS, BUT IS COMMITTED TO SERVING ALL STUDENTS IN THE SELECTED SCHOOLS. MOBILE HEALTH SERVICES PROVIDED BY THE HOSPITALS RONALD MCDONALD CARE MOBILE WILL BE AN INTEGRAL PART OF THE SCHOOL-BASED, COORDINATED HEALTH PROGRAM. 2014-2016 CHNA LUTHERAN GENERAL HOSPITAL HEALTH NEEDS NOT SELECTED TO ADDRESS MENTAL HEALTH AS IN THE 2011-2013 CHNA, MENTAL HEALTH WAS RECOGNIZED AS AN IMPORTANT HEALTH NEED. DUE TO THE EXISTING PROGRAMMING AND PARTNERSHIPS WORKING TO ADDRESS MENTAL HEALTH AS OUTLINED ABOVE, MENTAL HEALTH WAS NOT CHOSEN AS A HEALTH PRIORITY. CULTURAL HEALTH DISPARITIES AS INDICATED IN THE 2011-2013 CHNA, CULTURAL HEALTH DISPARITIES STILL EXIST, BUT THIS AREA WAS NOT CHOSEN AS A PRIORITY FOR THE 2014-2016 CHNA. AS PREVIOUSLY OUTLINED, LUTHERAN GENERAL HOSPITAL HAS CONTINUED TO EXPAND AND ENHANCE ITS CULTURAL INITIATIVES TO ADDRESS HEALTH EQUITY. THESE INITIATIVES INCLUDE THE SOUTH ASIAN CARDIOVASCULAR CENTER AND PROGRAMS FOR THE KOREAN, POLISH AND HISPANIC COMMUNITIES. ADVOCATE CHILDRENS HOSPITAL HEALTH NEEDS NOT SELECTED TO ADDRESS CHILDHOOD OBESITY CHILDHOOD OBESITY WAS NOT SELECTED AS A HEALTH NEED. THE HOSPITAL IS, HOWEVER, ADDRESSING CHILDHOOD OBESITY THROUGH THE HOSPITAL'S HEALTHY ACTIVE LIVING PROGRAM-A WEIGHT MANAGEMENT PROGRAM FOR OVERWEIGHT AND OBESE CHILDREN LARGELY INSURED THROUGH MEDICAID. COMPONENTS OF THE PROGRAM ARE OFFERED TO STUDENTS IN THE EXPANDED"
201733179349302768,362169147,2014-2016 CHNA,"HEALTH NEEDS SELECTED TO ADDRESS HEALTHY LIFESTYLES OBESITY AND POOR NUTRITION ARE THE MAIN CAUSES OF MANY CHRONIC DISEASES AND HEALTH ISSUES INCLUDING HEART DISEASE, STROKE, SOME CANCERS AND DIABETES. TAKING THIS INTO CONSIDERATION, THE CHC SELECTED HEALTHY LIFESTYLES AS ONE OF THE TWO HEALTH PRIORITIES TO ADDRESS, DUE TO THE LARGE IMPACT IT HAS ON QUALITY OF LIFE AND OVERALL HEALTH STATUS. THE PREVENTION OF OBESITY, PROPER NUTRITION AND PHYSICAL ACTIVITY HAVE THE POTENTIAL TO DECREASE THE RATE OF CHRONIC DISEASE THUS INCREASING LIFE EXPECTANCY AND QUALITY OF LIFE. THE TERM HEALTHY LIFESTYLES IS USED TO ENCOMPASS MULTIPLE FACTORS THAT CAUSE OBESITY AND IMPACT QUALITY. DATA ALSO REVEALED THAT LOW-INCOME POPULATIONS WITHIN DUPAGE COUNTY HAVE HIGHER RATES OF OBESITY INDICATING OBESITY PREVENTION AND NUTRITION EDUCATION IS AN ESSENTIAL NEED IN THE MORE VULNERABLE COMMUNITIES WITHIN THE HOSPITALS PSA. BELOW, ARE STRATEGIES THAT THE HOSPITAL WILL IMPLEMENT TO ADDRESS THE HEALTHY LIFESTYLES PRIORITY IN THE HOSPITALS DEFINED COMMUNITY. -HEALTHY LIFESTYLE WORKSHOPS- THE HOSPITAL WILL IMPLEMENT HEALTHY LIFESTYLE WORKSHOPS AT TWO COMMUNITY FOOD PANTRIES IN PARTNERSHIP WITH WITH THE UNIVERSITY OF ILLINOIS EXTENSION AND THE NORTHERN ILLINOIS FOOD BANK. FOOD PANTRY CLIENTS WILL RECEIVE A SERIES OF FOUR HEALTHY LIFESTYLE WORKSHOPS INCLUDING PERSONALIZED NUTRITION EDUCATION FROM THE GOOD SAMARITAN HEALTH AND WELLNESS CENTER (HWC) DIETITICIAN AND PHYSICAL ACTIVITY LESSONS FROM THE GOOD SAMARITAN HWC PHYSIOLOGIST. -HEALTHEIRUS SCHOOLS CHALLENGE- GOOD SAMARITAN HOSPITAL WILL FUND ACTION FOR HEALTHY KIDS (AFHK), AN ORGANIZATON FOCUSED ON CHILDHOOD OBESITY, TO PROVIDE TECHNICAL SUPPORT TO TWO SCHOOLS IN THE HOSPITALS PRIMARY SERVICE AREA. AFHK WILL WORK WITH SCHOOLS TO COMPLETE AN ASSESSMENT AND ACTION PLAN GEARED TOWARD CREATING A HEALTHIER SCHOOL ENVIRONMENT. THE OVERALL GOAL OF THIS INITIATIVE IS FOR EACH PARTNER SCHOOL TO RECEIVE HEALTHEIRUS SCHOOL CERTIFICATION. -HEART AND BRAIN ATTACK PREVENTION WORKSHOP- THE GOOD SAMARITAN HOSPITAL CARDIOVASCULAR SERVICE LINE AND COMMUNITY HEALTH DEPARTMENT ARE PARTNERING TO IMPLEMENT A HEALTHY LIFESTYLES WORKSHOP AIMED AT PREVENTING HEART ATTACKS AND STROKES. THE WORKSHOPS WILL BE IMPLEMENTED IN COMMUNITY SETTINGS SUCH AS THE LIBRARY, DOWNERS GROVE FIRE DEPARTMENT AND LOCAL CHURCHES. -PROACTIVE KIDS (PAK)- PAK IS AN 8-WEEK NUTRITION EDUCATION PROGRAM FOR OVERWIGHT AND OBESE KIDS. THE PROGRAM INCLUDES HEALTHY LIFESTYLE COACHING, PARENT/FAMILY ENGAGEMENT AND PHYSICAL ACTIVITY LESSONS. MENTAL HEALTH THE CHC SELECTED MENTAL HEALTH AS THE SECOND HEALTH NEED PRIORITY. DATA TRENDS INDICATED THAT MENTAL HEALTH ISSUES ARE INCREASING AND THE NEED FOR MENTAL HEALTH SERVICES AND PROGRAMMING IS CONTINUING TO GROW. THIS IS A HEALTH NEED THAT IS ALSO CORRELATED WITH SUBSTANCE ABUSE AS MANY SUBSTANCE USERS/ABUSERS ALSO EXPERIENCE MENTAL HEALTH ISSUES AND MANY INDIVIDUALS WITH MENTAL HEALTH DISORDERS EXPERIENCE SUBSTANCE ABUSE ISSUES. THE NATIONAL ALLIANCE FOR MENTAL ILLNESS (NAMI), ONE OF THE LEADING MENTAL HEALTH AGENCIES IN DUPAGE COUNTY, PROVIDED MENTAL HEALTH DATA THAT ALSO INDICATED THE NEED FOR RESILIENCE AND MENTAL HEALTH CRISIS TRAINING AMONG ADOLESCENTS AND YOUNG ADULTS. THE HIGH RATES OF ED VISITS AND HOSPITALIZATION DUE TO MENTAL HEALTH ISSUES ARE PREVENTABLE THROUGH EMPLOYING COPING MECHANISMS AND RESILIENCE TRAINING. THE CHC IS SPECIFICALLY INTERESTED IN PROGRAMS THAT PREVENT MENTAL HEALTH EMERGENCIES AND DECREASE ED VISITS AND HOSPITALIZATION DUE TO MENTAL HEALTH ISSUES. BELOW, ARE STRATEGIES THAT THE HOSPITAL WILL IMPLEMENT TO ADDRESS MENTAL HEALTH IN THE HOSPITALS PSA. -ENDING THE SILENCE- GOOD SAMARITAN HOSPITAL WILL PARTNER WITH NAMI TO IMPLEMENT THE ENDING THE SILENCE PROGRAM, WHICH AIMS TO CREATE AWARENESS AND DECREASE STIGMA AROUND MENTAL ILLNESS IN THE ADOLSECENT/TEEN POPULATION. THE HOSPITAL HAS IDENTIFIED TWO PARTNER SCHOOLS AND WILL FUND THE ENDING THE SILENCE PROGRAM FOR ALL OUTGOING 8TH GRADERS AND INCOMING FRESHMAN. -MENTAL HEALTH FIRST AID (MHFA)- MHFA IS AN 8-HOUR EVIDENCE BASED TRAINING THAT EDUCATES PARTICPANTS ON MENTAL ILLNESS INCLUDING: HOW TO IDENTIFY A MENTAL ILLNESS, WHAT TO DO IN THE CASE OF A MENTAL HEALTH EMERGENCY AND HOW TO SUPPORT INDIVIDUALS STRUGGLING WITH A MENTAL HEALTH CONDITION. GOOD SAMARITAN HOSPITAL WILL PROVIDE MENTAL HEALTH FIRST AID TRAINING FOR HOSPITAL EMPLOYEES, COMMUNITY ORGANIZATONS, CHURCHES, LOCAL LAW ENFORCEMENT AND COMMUNITY LEADERS FROM 2017 THROUGH 2019. -TEEN RECOVERY SUPPORT GROUP- THE HOSPITAL WILL SUPPORT THE DEVELOPMENT OF NAMIS TEEN RECOVERY SUPPORT GROUP THROUGH PROVIDING A GOOD SAMARITAN HOSPITAL MENTAL HEALTH COUNSELOR TO FACILITATE RECOVERY GROUP DISCUSSIONS. -MENTAL HEALTH CRISIS INTERVENTION CENTER COLLABORATIVE- GOOD SAMARITAN HOSPITAL WILL BE ENGAGED IN A DUPAGE COUNTY COLLABORTIVE THAT FOCUSES ON ADDRESSING MENTAL HEALTH CRISES IN DUPAGE COUNTY. THE COLLABORATIVE WILL REVIEW VARIOUS METHODS AND PROGRAMS THAT ADDRESS MENTAL HEALTH CRISES AND WILL CONDUCT AN ASSESSMENT ON THE EXISTING MENTAL HEALTH CRISES RESOURCES. THE GOAL OF THE COLLABORATIVE WILL BE TO IDENTIFY THE MOST EFFECTIVE METHOD(S) TO ADDRESS MENTAL HEALTH CRISES IN DUPAGE COUNTY. -EMERGENCY DEPARTMENT MENTAL HEALTH TRAINING- GOOD SAMARITAN HOSPITAL WILL PARTNER WITH NAMI TO IMPLEMENT AN ANNUAL 90-MINUTE MENTAL HEALTH TRAINING FOR EMERGENCY DEPARTMENT (ED) STAFF AND PHYSICIANS. COMMUNITY HEALTH NEEDS NOT SELECTED SUBSTANCE ABUSE SUBSTANCE ABUSE WAS INCLUDED IN THE TOP THREE HEALTH NEEDS FOR THE 2014-2016 CHNA BUT WAS NOT SELECTED AS A PRIORITY AT THIS TIME. GOOD SAMARITAN HOSPITAL RECOGNIZES THE NEED TO ADDRESS SUBSTANCE ABUSE IN THE COMMUNITY AND HAS DEDICATED MULTIPLE RESOURCES TO ADDRESSING THE ISSUE. THE HOSPITALS DETOX CENTER SERVES PATIENTS WITH ADDICTION ISSUES AND PROVIDES A SAFE ENVIRONMENT FOR SUBSTANCE ABUSE WITHDRAWAL. IN ADDITION, THE HOSPITAL RECEIVED A GRANT TO IMPLEMENT A LINKAGE TO CARE PROGRAM, WHICH EMPLOYS A COMMUNITY LINKAGE SPECIALIST TO LINK DISCHARGED DETOX UNIT PATIENTS TO COMMUNITY SUPPORT SERVICES AND TO FOLLOW-UP WITH PATIENTS AT 30, 60, 90 AND 180 DAYS TO CHECK-IN ON PROGRESS AND PROVIDE ADDITIONAL SUPPORT IF NEEDED. THE HOSPITAL ALSO PROVIDES RESOURCES FOR COMMUNITY PARTNERS SUCH AS ALCOHOL ANONYMOUS (AA) AND NARCOTICS ANONYMOUS (NA). BOTH AA AND NA SUPPORT GROUPS HOLD REGULAR MEETINGS AT GOOD SAMARITAN HOSPITAL. ASTHMA ASTHMA WAS IDENTIFIED AS A HEALTH NEED IN THE 2014-2016 CHNA BUT WAS NOT SELECTED AS A PRIORITY TO ADDRESS DUE TO THE LACK OF COMMUNITY PARTNERS AND THE AVAILABILITY OF ASTHMA PREVENTION PROGRAMS. THE MAJORITY OF ASTHMA PROGRAMS WITHIN THE COUNTY ARE FOCUSED ON ASTHMA ATTACK PREVENTION AND TREATMENT. THE CHC ALSO IDENTIFIED HOSPITALIZATION AND ED VISIT RATES DUE TO ASTHMA AS A POTENTIAL ACCESS TO HEALTH CARE ISSUE. TAKING THIS INTO CONSIDERATION, THE COMMUNITY HEALTH MANAGER ALONG WITH THE CHC IDENTIFIED SEVERAL HOSPITAL PROGRAMS THAT ADDRESSED ACCESS TO HEALTH CARE, INCLUDING SUPPORT SERVICES FOR ED OVERUTILIZATION DUE TO LACK OF PRIMARY CARE FOR CHRONIC CONDITIONS LIKE ASTHMA. THROUGH HOSPITAL PARTNERSHIPS, SUCH AS GOOD SAMARITAN HOSPITALS PARTNERSHIP WITH ENGAGE DUPAGE, ASTHMATIC PATIENTS WHO ARE IN NEED OF PRIMARY CARE WILL RECEIVE SUPPORT FROM PROGRAM STAFF THAT PROVIDE LINKAGES TO PRIMARY CARE AND INSURANCE COVERAGE. ACCESS TO HEALTH CARE SERVICES THE CHC ACKNOWLEDGES ACCESS TO HEALTH CARE SERVICES AS A CRITICAL NEED FOR THE HOSPITALS PSA. THIS NEED WAS NOT PRIORITIZED DUE TO SEVERAL PROGRAMS AND PARTNERSHIPS THAT ARE CURRENTLY BEING IMPLEMENTED TO ADDRESS ACCESS TO HEALTH IN THE HOSPITAL SERVICE AREA. THE HOSPITAL HAS A FINANCIALLY SIGNIFICANT LONG STANDING PARTNERSHIP WITH ACCESS DUPAGE, WHICH WORKS WITH UNINSURED AND UNDERINSURED PATIENTS TO CONNECT THEM TO HEALTH CARE COVERAGE AND PRIMARY CARE SERVICES. THE HOSPITAL SERVES MANY ACCESS DUPAGE CLIENTS AND WILL CONTINUE TO WORK WITH THE ORGANIZATION TO LINK VULNERABLE POPULATIONS TO EFFECTIVE HEALTH CARE COVERAGE AND SERVICES. THE HOSPITAL ALSO PARTNERS WITH ENGAGE DUPAGE, WHICH IS A PROGRAM THAT WORKS WITH PATIENTS WHO OVER-UTILIZE THE HOSPITALS ED AND ARE UNINSURED OR UNDERINSURED. THE PROGRAMS PRIMARY GOAL IS TO IDENTIFY AND SOLIDIFY HEALTH CARE COVERAGE FOR THOSE PATIENTS WHO ARE UNINSURED. PROGRAM STAFF ALSO WORK WITHIN THE HOSPITALS ED TO LINK PATIENTS TO COMMUNITY SUPPORT SERVICES, INCLUDING EMERGENCY FOOD, HOUSING AND SOCIAL SERVICES. THE HOSPITAL IS ENGAGING IN STRONG PARTNERSHIPS WITH ENGAGE DUPAGE AND ACCESS DUPAGE TO IMPROVE HEALTH OUTCOMES IN THE PSA AND ED UTILIZATION WITHIN THE HOSPITAL. THE COMMUNITY HEALTH MANAGER WILL CONTINUE TO TRACK PROGRESS OF BOTH PROGRAMS AND REPORT PROGRAM OUTCOMES TO THE CHC. CANCER CANCER WAS IDENTIFIED AS A HEALTH NEED FOR THE HOSPITALS PRIMARY SERVICE AREA DUE TO HIGH INCIDENCE AND PREVALENCE RATES OF THE DISEASE. THE CHC DID NOT SELECT THIS NEED AS A PRIORITY DUE TO THE MYRIAD OF CANCER SERVICES AND SUPPORT GROUPS THE HOSPITAL CURRENT"
201733179349302768,362169147,MOTOR VEHICLE ACCIDENTS (TEEN),"THE COMMUNITY HEALTH COUNCIL DID NOT SELECT MOTOR VEHICLE ACCIDENTS AS THE HOSPITAL WAS ALREADY ADDRESSING THIS ISSUE BY PARTICIPATING IN OPERATION CLICK. OPERATION CLICK IS A COMMUNITY PROGRAM THAT ADDRESSES THE RISK FOR YOUTH MOTOR VEHICLE FATALITIES BY EDUCATING TEENS ON THE IMPORTANCE OF SAFE DRIVING HABITS. THE HOSPITAL HAS BEEN ACTIVE ON OPERATION CLICKS BOARD OF DIRECTORS, PROVIDES FUNDING FOR ITS ANNUAL BANQUET, AND RECENTLY PROVIDED FUNDING SO THE ORGANIZATION COULD HIRE A PART-TIME PROGRAM COORDINATOR FOR 24 MONTHS. THIS SEED FUNDING ALLOWED THE COORDINATOR TO DEVELOP A FUNDING STREAM TO SUSTAIN OPERATION CLICK. IN 2016, GOOD SHEPHERD HOSPITAL CONTINUED TO FUND THE PROGRAM. OVERALL, OPERATION CLICK HAS BEEN IMPACTFUL, RESULTING IN AN INCREASE IN TEEN SEAT BELT COMPLIANCE AS DOCUMENTED BY AN INCREASE IN AVERAGE COMPLIANCE RATES FROM 79% ON THE PRE-SURVEY IN 2013 TO 99% AS REPORTED BY PARTICIPANTS ON THE POST-PROGRAM SURVEY IN 2016. THERE WERE TWO REMAINING HEALTH NEEDS IDENTIFIED THAT THE HOSPITAL ALSO DID NOT ADDRESS-DENTAL HEALTH AND BILINGUAL LITERACY. DENTAL HEALTH GOOD SHEPHERD HOSPITAL HAS SIX DENTISTS AND TWO ORAL SURGEONS ON-STAFF TO HELP ADDRESS THE GROWING DENTAL NEEDS IN THE COMMUNITY. BILINGUAL LITERACY THE HOSPITAL IS ALWAYS WILLING TO CONTRIBUTE TO A COMMUNITY-WIDE PROJECT IN COLLABORATION WITH THE UNITED WAY, THE LOCAL CAREER CENTER OR ONE OF THE MANY COALITIONS, SUCH AS THE HEALTHIER BARRINGTON COALITION OF WHICH THE HOSPITAL IS AN ACTIVE MEMBER. THE HOSPITAL HAS SUPPORTED ASSOCIATES PURSUING MEDICAL SPANISH TRAINING AT THE AREA COMMUNITY COLLEGE. GOOD SHEPHERD HOSPITAL ALSO HAS A ROBUST LANGUAGE ASSISTANCE PROGRAM WHICH PROVIDES INTERPRETATION ASSISTANCE DURING MEDICAL CARE. IN 2016, GOOD SHEPHERD HOSPITAL PROVIDED APPROXIMATELY 3,600 LANGUAGE ASSISTANCE ENCOUNTERS THROUGH TELEPHONE AND VIDEO. 2014-2016 CHNA GOOD SHEPHERD HOSPITAL CONDUCTED A COMPREHENSIVE COMMUNITY HEALTH NEEDS ASSESSMENT WHICH INCLUDED THE SELECTION OF HEALTH PRIORITIES THROUGH A CONSENSUS PRIORITIZATION PROCESS BY THE COMMUNITY HEALTH COUNCIL. THE COUNCIL RECOMMENDED, AND THE HOSPITAL GOVERNING COUNCIL APPROVED, TWO HEALTH AREAS FOR PRIORITY ACTION: OBESITY AND MENTAL HEALTH. STEPS BEING TAKEN TO ADDRESS THE TWO PRIORITIES ARE BELOW. NEEDS SELECTED TO ADDRESS OBESITY GOOD SHEPHERD HOSPITAL IS ADDRESSING OBESITY IN THE SERVICE AREA THROUGH THREE EVIDENCE-BASED PROGRAMS. THE FIRST PROGRAM, THE NUTRITION AND PHYSICAL ACTIVITY SELF-ASSESSMENT FOR CHILD CARE (GO NAP SACC) PROGRAM, IS AN EVIDENCE-BASED CHILDCARE FACILITY INTERVENTION. THE GO NAP SACC PROGRAM IS AN EARLY INTERVENTION PROGRAM TARGETING INFANTS THROUGH PRE-KINDERGARTEN AND AIMS TO ADVANCE THE CHILDCARE ENVIRONMENT BY IMPROVING NUTRITION, PHYSICAL ACTIVITY AND POLICIES IN THE CHILD CARE CENTER. THE HOSPITAL WILL LEAD THE GO NAP SACC ASSESSMENT PROCESS WITH CHILDCARE CENTERS IN COMMUNITIES WITH HIGH SOCIONEEDS INDEX SCORES WITHIN THE HOSPITAL SERVICE AREA. SOCIOECONOMIC NEED WAS DETERMINED BY THE HEALTHY COMMUNITIES INSTITUTES (HCI) CALCULATIONS TO CREATE AN INDEX USING SIX MAJOR SOCIO-NEEDS INDICATORS THAT ARE CORRELATED WITH POOR HEALTH OUTCOMES. THE INDICATORS INCLUDE INCOME, UNEMPLOYMENT, OCCUPATION, EDUCATION, LANGUAGE, AND POVERTY. GOOD SHEPHERD HOSPITAL HAS PARTNERED WITH ADVOCATE CONDELL MEDICAL CENTER AND ADVOCATE SHERMAN HOSPITAL TO MAKE THIS PROGRAM A REGIONAL INITIATIVE. THE SECOND OBESITY-PREVENTION PROGRAM IS THE CENTERS FOR DISEASE CONTROL AND PREVENTION (CDC) WORKSITE WELLNESS PROGRAM WHICH TARGETS ADULTS IN THE WORKPLACE. THE PROGRAM FOLLOWS THE CDC FOUR-STEP WORKPLACE HEALTH MODEL AND INVOLVES USING THE CDC WORKSITE HEALTH SCORECARD. WORKSITE NUTRITION AND PHYSICAL ACTIVITY PROGRAMS ARE DESIGNED TO IMPROVE HEALTH-RELATED BEHAVIORS AND HEALTH OUTCOMES. GOOD SHEPHERD HOSPITAL COMMUNITY HEALTH STAFF WILL WORK IN CONJUNCTION WITH THE HOSPITALS COMMUNITY RELATIONS DIRECTOR TO PROVIDE WORKSITE HEALTH TRAINING AND PROGRAMS TO CHAMBERS OF COMMERCE AND SMALL BUSINESSES WITHIN THE SERVICE AREA. THE THIRD PROGRAM IS THE FOOD INSECURITY (FI) SCREENING AND RESOURCE PROGRAM. THE FI SCREEN RAPIDLY IDENTIFIES HOUSEHOLDS AT RISK FOR FOOD INSECURITY, ENABLING PROVIDERS TO TARGET SERVICES THAT AMELIORATE THE ASSOCIATED HEALTH AND DEVELOPMENTAL CONSEQUENCES. THE TWO-ITEM FI SCREEN IS EVIDENCE BASED TO BE SENSITIVE, SPECIFIC AND VALID AMONG LOW-INCOME FAMILIES WITH YOUNG CHILDREN. THE HOSPITAL WILL COLLABORATE WITH SENIOR SERVICE ORGANIZATIONS IN THE GOOD SHEPHERD HOSPITAL SERVICE AREA TO SCREEN SENIORS FOR FOOD INSECURITY, USING THE TWO-ITEM FOOD INSECURITY SCREEN QUESTIONNAIRE. INDIVIDUALS WHO ARE IDENTIFIED AS FOOD INSECURE WILL BE REFERRED TO COMMUNITY RESOURCES (FOOD PANTRIES, SNAP, MEALS ON WHEELS, CONGREGATIONAL MEAL PROGRAMS, FARMERS MARKETS, COMMUNITY GARDENS, ETC.). MENTAL HEALTH THE HOSPITAL IS ADDRESSING MENTAL HEALTH IN THE GOOD SHEPHERD HOSPITAL SERVICE AREA THROUGH THREE STRATEGIES. THE FIRST STRATEGY UTILIZES MENTAL HEALTH FIRST AID TRAINING. MENTAL HEALTH FIRST AID IS AN INTERNATIONAL EVIDENCE-BASED PROGRAM, DESIGNED TO HELP PEOPLE RECOGNIZE INDIVIDUALS WITH MENTAL HEALTH PROBLEMS AND PROVIDE SKILLS TO HELP THOSE WHO ARE HAVING A MENTAL HEALTH CRISIS TO ACCESS HELP. THE HOSPITAL WILL HOLD SEVERAL EIGHT-HOUR MENTAL HEALTH FIRST AID SESSIONS IN MCHENRY COUNTY. TARGET GROUPS IN THE COUNTY WILL BE TEACHERS, PE INSTRUCTORS AND COACHES AND SENIOR SERVICES STAFF. THE HOSPITAL WILL ALSO HOLD EIGHT-HOUR MENTAL HEALTH FIRST AID SESSIONS FOR GOOD SHEPHERD HOSPITAL CARE MANAGERS, SOCIAL WORKERS AND ONCOLOGY NURSE NAVIGATORS. FINALLY, THE HOSPITAL WILL STRIVE TO SUCCESSFULLY TRAIN TWO INDIVIDUALS TO BECOME MENTAL HEALTH FIRST AID TRAINERS, WHICH REQUIRES COMPLETING A 40-HOUR TRAINING COURSE. THE SECOND STRATEGY TO ADDRESS MENTAL HEALTH IS TO INCREASE THE NUMBER OF ADULTS WHO ARE SCREENED FOR DEPRESSION AND, IF POSITIVE, REFERRED TO SUPPORTIVE SERVICES BY HEALTH CARE PROFESSIONALS. COLLABORATIVE CARE FOR THE MANAGEMENT OF DEPRESSIVE DISORDERS IS A MULTICOMPONENT, HEALTHCARE SYSTEM-LEVEL INTERVENTION THAT USES CASE MANAGERS TO LINK PRIMARY CARE PROVIDERS, PATIENTS AND MENTAL HEALTH SPECIALISTS. THIS COLLABORATION IS DESIGNED TO IMPROVE THE ROUTINE SCREENING AND DIAGNOSIS OF DEPRESSIVE DISORDERS, INCREASE PROVIDER USES OF EVIDENCE-BASED PROTOCOLS FOR THE PROACTIVE MANAGEMENT OF DIAGNOSED DEPRESSIVE DISORDERS, AND IMPROVE CLINICAL AND COMMUNITY SUPPORT FOR ACTIVE PATIENT ENGAGEMENT IN TREATMENT GOAL SETTING AND SELF-MANAGEMENT. GOOD SHEPHERD HOSPITAL WILL IMPLEMENT DEPRESSION SCREENING FOR HOSPITAL PATIENTS, AGE 65 AND OLDER, OBSTETRIC PATIENTS AND CARDIOLOGY PATIENTS. HOSPITAL HEALTH CARE PROFESSIONALS WILL REFER INDIVIDUALS WHO SCREEN POSITIVE TO COMMUNITY AND MENTAL HEALTH SUPPORT SERVICES. THE THIRD STRATEGY TO ADDRESS MENTAL HEALTH IS TO STRENGTHEN GOOD SHEPHERD HOSPITALS LINKAGE TO COMMUNITY MENTAL HEALTH AGENCIES WITHIN THE SERVICE AREA. THE HOSPITAL WILL SPONSOR A MENTAL HEALTH RESOURCE FAIR TO INTRODUCE MENTAL HEALTH AGENCIES AND PROVIDERS TO GOOD SHEPHERD HOSPITAL STAFF (PROVIDERS, NURSES, SOCIAL WORKERS, CARE MANAGERS). RESOURCE FAIR ATTENDEES WILL LEARN ABOUT SERVICES PROVIDED AND INSURANCE COVERAGE ACCEPTED BY THE MENTAL HEALTH AGENCIES IN ORDER TO INCREASE THE KNOWLEDGE THAT GOOD SHEPHERD HOSPITAL STAFF HAVE ABOUT MENTAL HEALTH RESOURCES AVAILABLE FOR HOSPITAL PATIENTS. NEEDS NOT SELECTED TO ADDRESS DIABETES DIABETES WAS IDENTIFIED AS A HEALTH NEED WITHIN THE GOOD SHEPHERD HOSPITAL SERVICE AREA. DIABETES PREVALENCE IS INCREASING OVER TIME IN THE NATION AND LOCALLY. EMERGENCY ROOM AND HOSPITALIZATION RATES FOR DIABETES HAVE ALSO CONTINUED TO INCREASE OVER TIME. THOUGH A SIGNIFICANT NEED, THE COMMUNITY HEALTH COUNCIL MADE THE DECISION TO FOCUS ON OBESITY AS A PRIORITY, GIVEN ITS IMPACT ON THE RISK FOR PRE-DIABETES AND DIABETES. GOOD SHEPHERD HOSPITAL HAS A DIABETES ADVISORY COMMITTEE THAT IS COMMITTED TO DIABETES PREVENTION AND TREATMENT IN THE COMMUNITY THOUGH EDUCATION, PROGRAMMING AND SCREENINGS. CARDIOVASCULAR DISEASE IN MCHENRY COUNTY, THERE HAS BEEN A DECLINE IN MORTALITY RATES FOR HEART DISEASE AND STROKE. OVER THE PAST DECADE, MCHENRY COUNTYS HEART DISEASE DEATH RATE HAS DROPPED BY 19%, WHILE THE STROKE DEATH RATE HAS FALLEN BY 25%. THE PREVALENCE RATE OF HEART DISEASE IS SLIGHTLY HIGHER IN MCHENRY COUNTY THAN LAKE COUNTY; HOWEVER, THE MORTALITY RATE FROM HEART DISEASE IS HIGHER IN LAKE COUNTY THAN MCHENRY COUNTY. THE COMMUNITY HEALTH COUNCIL DECIDED IT WAS MORE BENEFICIAL TO PRIORITIZE OBESITY BECAUSE OF ITS IMPACT ON THE RISK FACTORS FOR HEART DISEASE. THE HOSPITAL IS COMMITTED TO DECREASING THE RATE OF HEART DISEASE THROUGH MANY OF THE ADVOCATE HEART INSTITUTE PROGRAMS. THE HOSPITAL CONTINUES TO BE A MEMBER OF THE CARDIOVASCULAR MAPP (MOBILIZING FOR ACTION THROUGH PLANNING AND PARTNERSHIPS) GROUP IN MCHENRY COUNTY AND PARTNERS WITH THE MCHENRY COUNTY HEALTH DEPARTMENT TO ADMINISTER THE HEART AGE TOOL THROUGHOUT THE COMMUNITY.

THE HEART RATE MONITORS ARE BEING UTILIZED IN CONJUNCTION WITH THE SPARK PROGRAM TO HELP INCREASE THE NUMBER OF MINUTES STUDENTS ARE ENGAGING IN MODERATE TO VIGOROUS PHYSICAL ACTIVITY DURING PHYSICAL EDUCATION CLASS. IN ADDITION, BODY MASS INDEX (BMI) VALUES ARE COLLECTED AT THREE DIFFERENT POINTS DURING THE SCHOOL YEAR FOR SIXTH AND SEVENTH GRADERS. DATA COLLECTED FOR THE 2015-2016 SCHOOL YEAR IS SUMMARIZED BELOW: -THE PERCENT OF SIXTH GRADE STUDENTS FALLING IN THE UNDERWEIGHT CATEGORY ACCORDING TO BMI DECREASED FROM TWO PERCENT TO ZERO PERCENT DURING THE 2015-2016 SCHOOL YEAR. THE PERCENT OF SIXTH GRADE STUDENTS WITH A NORMAL BMI REMAINED THE SAME AT 43 PERCENT DURING THE SAME TIME PERIOD. THE PERCENT OF SIXTH GRADE STUDENTS FALLING INTO THE OVERWEIGHT CATEGORY ACCORDING TO BMI VALUES ALSO REMAINED THE SAME AT 13 PERCENT DURING THE 2015-2016 SCHOOL YEAR. THE PERCENT OF STUDENTS FALLING INTO THE OBESE CATEGORY INCREASED FROM 33 PERCENT TO 35 PERCENT FROM THE FALL OF 2015 TO THE SPRING OF 2016. -THE PERCENT OF SEVENTH GRADE STUDENTS FALLING IN THE UNDERWEIGHT CATEGORY ACCORDING TO BMI INCREASED DURING THE 2015-2016 SCHOOL YEAR FROM ZERO PERCENT TO TWO PERCENT. THE PERCENT OF SEVENTH GRADE STUDENTS WITH A NORMAL BMI DECREASED FROM 61 PERCENT TO 56 PERCENT FROM THE FALL OF 2015 TO THE SPRING OF 2016. THE PERCENT OF SEVENTH GRADE STUDENTS FALLING INTO THE OVERWEIGHT CATEGORY ACCORDING TO BMI VALUES DECREASED FROM 17 PERCENT TO 12 PERCENT DURING THE SAME TIME PERIOD. THE PERCENT OF STUDENTS FALLING INTO THE OBESE CATEGORY INCREASED FROM 17 PERCENT TO 21 PERCENT FROM THE FALL OF 2015 TO THE SPRING OF 2016. THE COMMUNITY HEALTH MANAGER FOR BROMENN MEDICAL CENTER ALSO SERVES ON THE MCLEAN COUNTY WELLNESS COALITION AND MCLEAN COUNTY WELLNESS COALITION LEADERSHIP COMMITTEE, A GROUP COMPRISED OF CAMPUS AND COMMUNITY ORGANIZATIONS WORKING TO PROMOTE HEALTHY EATING AND ACTIVE LIVING AND TO DECREASE OBESITY RATES. THE COALITION HAS BEEN IN PLACE SINCE 2011 AND PROMOTES THE ADOPTION OF HEALTHY LIFESTYLE POLICY, SYSTEM AND ENVIRONMENTAL CHANGES. A SAMPLING OF THE 2016 ACTIVITIES OF THE MCLEAN COUNTY WELLNESS COALITION ARE PROVIDED BELOW: -SPONSORED A WALK/BIKE TO SCHOOL DAY WITH APPROXIMATELY 400 PARTICIPANTS; AND -MANAGED VOLUNTEERS FOR THE VEGGIE OASIS. THE VEGGIE OASIS PROVIDES LOCALLY-GROWN PRODUCE, DONATED BY FARMERS FROM THE DOWNTOWN BLOOMINGTON ASSOCIATE FARMERS MARKET, TO LOW-INCOME NEIGHBORHOODS IN BLOOMINGTON. APPROXIMATELY 5,720 POUNDS OF PRODUCE WERE DISTRIBUTED TO APPROXIMATELY 30 COMMUNITY MEMBERS PER WEEK FOR SIX MONTHS IN 2016. AS STATED IN THE 2014 IMPLEMENTATION PLAN PROGRESS REPORT, SEPARATE GROUP DIABETES SELF-MANAGEMENT EDUCATION CLASSES FOR PATIENTS OF THE COMMUNITY HEALTH CARE CLINIC WERE DISCONTINUED DUE TO LOW PARTICIPATION. IN 2015, APPROPRIATE PATIENTS OF THE COMMUNITY HEALTH CARE CLINIC WERE PROVIDED WITH THE OPPORTUNITY TO MEET INDIVIDUALLY WITH A BROMENN MEDICAL CENTER DIABETES EDUCATOR OR ATTEND A DIABETES EDUCATION CLASS AT THE HOSPITAL. TWO PATIENTS TOOK ADVANTAGE OF THE GROUP CLASS. IN 2016, THERE WERE NO PATIENTS REFERRED FROM THE CLINIC TO ATTEND THE DIABETES EDUCATION CLASSES AT BROMENN MEDICAL CENTER. CLASSES ARE NOW OFFERED ON-SITE AT THE COMMUNITY HEALTH CARE CLINIC. HEALTH NEEDS NOT SELECTED BROMENN MEDICAL CENTER DID NOT SELECT ORAL HEALTH, HEART DISEASE, CANCER OR LOW BIRTH WEIGHT AS KEY HEALTH ISSUES FOR THE REASONS IDENTIFIED BELOW. ORAL HEALTH ORAL HEALTH IS AN ISSUE FOR WHICH THE HOSPITAL HAS A LIMITED SPHERE OF INFLUENCE. BROMENN MEDICAL CENTER DOES NOT HAVE DENTAL RESIDENTS OR A MOBILE DENTAL VAN, BOTH OF WHICH COULD BE KEY COMPONENTS OF A SUCCESSFUL INTERVENTION. HOWEVER, A COLLABORATION WITH THE MCLEAN COUNTY PUBLIC HEALTH DEPARTMENT, ST. JOSEPH MEDICAL CENTER, THE COMMUNITY HEALTH CARE CLINIC AND CHESTNUT HEALTH SYSTEMS MAY LESSEN THE ORAL HEALTH BURDEN IN THE COMMUNITY. AN ADVOCATE MEDICAL GROUP PEDIATRICIANS OFFICE LOCATED IN NORMAL, ILLINOIS, HAS BEEN PARTICIPATING IN THE BRIGHT SMILES FROM BIRTH PROGRAM THROUGH THE ILLINOIS CHAPTER OF THE AMERICAN ACADEMY OF PEDIATRICS FOR SEVERAL YEARS. AFTER COMPLETING A COURSE, THE PEDIATRICIANS OFFICE CAN BILL MEDICAID FOR THE APPLICATION OF FLUORIDE VARNISH ON FULLY ERUPTED TEETH OF CHILDREN UNDER THREE YEARS OF AGE. EACH APPLICATION CAN BE DONE THREE TIMES PER YEAR. THE FLUORIDE SERVES TO PROTECT THE BABY TEETH, RESULTING IN FEWER CAVITIES. HEART DISEASE AND CANCER DESPITE THEIR PERVASIVENESS, HEART DISEASE AND CANCER WERE NOT SELECTED AS KEY HEALTH ISSUES. BROMENN MEDICAL CENTERS COMMUNITY HEALTH COUNCIL DETERMINED THAT SIGNIFICANT COMMUNITY RESOURCES WERE ALREADY BEING DEVOTED TO BOTH OF THESE ISSUES. IN PARTICULAR, THE COMMUNITY HAS AN EXCELLENT RESOURCE IN THE COMMUNITY CANCER CENTER, WHICH IS A JOINT VENTURE BETWEEN BROMENN MEDICAL CENTER AND OSF SAINT JOSEPHS MEDICAL CENTER. IN THE AREA OF HEART DISEASE, BROMENN MEDICAL CENTER SCREENED APPROXIMATELY 1,444 COMMUNITY MEMBERS FOR CHOLESTEROL, BLOOD PRESSURE AND/OR PERCENT OF BODY FAT IN 2016. IN ADDITION, APPROXIMATELY 1,239 HIGH SCHOOL STUDENTS WERE SCREENED THROUGH ADVOCATE FOR YOUNG HEARTS IN 2016. ADVOCATE FOR YOUNG HEARTS PROGRAM SCREENS LOCAL HIGH SCHOOL STUDENTS AT NO COST FOR UNIDENTIFIED GENETIC DISORDERS THAT PLACE THEM AT HIGH RISK FOR SUDDEN CARDIAC DEATH. BROMENN MEDICAL CENTER ALSO RAISED THE HIGHEST DOLLAR AMOUNT, COMPARED TO OTHER EMPLOYERS IN MCLEAN COUNTY, FOR THE 2016 AMERICAN HEART ASSOCIATION HEART WALK FUNDRAISING EFFORT. LOW BIRTH WEIGHT INFANTS ALTHOUGH, LOW BIRTH WEIGHT WAS IDENTIFIED AS A HEALTH ISSUE IN MCLEAN COUNTY DATA, BROMENN MEDICAL CENTER DID NOT SELECT IT AS A SIGNIFICANT HEALTH NEED TO BE ADDRESSED. THE HOSPITAL HAS TAKEN STEPS TO ADDRESS THE ISSUE, HOWEVER, DUE TO THE FACT THAT THE PERCENT OF ELECTIVE INDUCTIONS WAS DEEMED TO BE HIGHER THAN WHAT WAS ACCEPTABLE TO THE HOSPITAL. IN OCTOBER 2011, A COLLABORATIVE EFFORT BEGAN BETWEEN BROMENN MEDICAL CENTER, SAINT JOSEPHS MEDICAL CENTER, THE MARCH OF DIMES AND LOCAL PHYSICIANS. THE MARCH OF DIMES INITIATIVE OF NO ELECTIVE INDUCTIONS PRIOR TO 39 WEEKS WITHOUT MEDICAL NECESSITY BEGAN. IN 2012, BROMENN MEDICAL CENTER HAD ZERO ELECTIVE INDUCTIONS AT LESS THAN 39 WEEKS. A REVIEW OF LOW BIRTH WEIGHT DATA SHOWED THAT WOMEN HAVE SUFFICIENT ACCESS TO PRENATAL CARE IN BROMENNS PRIMARY SERVICE AREA. THE ISSUE SEEMED TO BE THAT WOMEN WERE CHOOSING TO HAVE ELECTIVE INDUCTIONS OR ELECTIVE CAESAREAN-SECTIONS. IT WAS HYPOTHESIZED THAT THE MARCH OF DIMES INITIATIVE WOULD HAVE A POSITIVE IMPACT ON DECREASING THE NUMBER OF VERY LOW BIRTH WEIGHT (VLBW) BABIES. THE HOSPITAL SAW A 50 PERCENT REDUCTION IN THE NUMBER OF VLBW BABIES AT THE END OF THE FIRST REPORTING PERIOD FOLLOWING IMPLEMENTATION OF THE ELECTIVE INDUCTION INITIATIVE (FROM OCTOBER 2011 THROUGH SEPTEMBER 2012), AND ANOTHER 50 PERCENT REDUCTION FROM OCTOBER 2012 THROUGH SEPTEMBER 2013. THE HOSPITAL CURRENTLY REPORTS ON A CALENDAR YEAR BASIS FOR VLBW BABIES. THERE WERE FOUR VLBW BABIES IN 2013 OUT OF 1,576 LIVE BIRTHS. THIS EQUATES TO .21 PERCENT. IN 2014, THERE WERE SIX VLBW BABIES OUT OF 1,565 LIVE BIRTHS EQUATING TO .38 PERCENT. IN 2015, THERE WERE FIVE VLBW BABIES OUT OF 1,684 LIVE BIRTHS EQUATING TO .29 PERCENT. IN 2016, THERE WAS ONE VLBW BABY OUT OF 1,607 LIVE BIRTHS EQUATING TO .06 PERCENT. FOR 2013, 2014, 2015 AND 2016, THE PERCENTAGE OF VLBW BABIES IS WELL BELOW THE HEALTHY PEOPLE 2020 RECOMMENDATION OF <1.4 PERCENT. 2014-2016 CHNA HEALTH NEEDS SELECTED THE MCLEAN COUNTY COMMUNITY HEALTH COUNCIL SELECTED ACCESS TO APPROPRIATE HEALTHCARE FOR THE UNDERSERVED AND AREAS OF HIGH SOCIOECONOMIC NEEDS, BEHAVIORAL HEALTH, AND OBESITY AS THE THREE HEALTH PRIORITIES FOR THE 2016 MCLEAN COUNTY COMMUNITY HEALTH NEEDS ASSESSMENT. IN ADDITION TO COMPLETING A JOINT COMMUNITY HEALTH NEEDS ASSESSMENT FOR MCLEAN COUNTY, BROMENN MEDICAL CENTER, THE MCLEAN COUNTY HEALTH DEPARTMENT, ST. JOSEPH MEDICAL CENTER AND UNITED WAY OF MCLEAN COUNTY COMPLETED THE JOINT MCLEAN COUNTY 2017-2"
201733179349302768,362169147,ADVOCATE TRINITY HOSPITAL,"2011-2013 CHNA AFTER COMPLETING A COMPREHENSIVE CHNA, THE COMMUNITY HEALTH COUNCIL AND HOSPITAL STAFF PRIORITIZED THE HEALTH NEEDS AS IDENTIFIED THROUGH THE 2013 ADVOCATE TRINITY HOSPITAL COMMUNITY HEALTH NEEDS ASSESSMENT REPORT. A CONSENSUS PROCESS WAS IMPLEMENTED TO PRIORITIZE THE TOP THREE HEALTH NEEDS IN THE SERVICE AREA. THE PRIORITY AREAS SELECTED WERE: HEART DISEASE, STROKE, AND ASTHMA. IMPLEMENTATION PLANS WERE CREATED IN 2013 AND APPROVED AND POSTED IN 2014 TO ADDRESS THE SELECTED NEEDS IN THE AREAS OF ASTHMA, HEART DISEASE AND STROKE. THE IMPLEMENTATION PLAN SET GOALS, PERFORMANCE MEASURES AND IDENTIFIED STRATEGIES FOR SUCCESSFUL PROGRAM IMPLEMENTATION. THE PROGRAM ACCOMPLISHMENTS IN 2016 INCLUDE THE FOLLOWING: HEALTH NEEDS SELECTED TO ADDRESS HEART DISEASE/STROKE -OVER 350 INDIVIDUALS WERE SCREENED (GLUCOSE, CHOLESTEROL, AND BLOOD PRESSURE) AND REFERRED TO ADDITIONAL SERVICES FOR FOLLOW UP OF ABNORMAL RESULTS. -TWO COMMUNITY WIDE EVENTS WERE HELD IN MARCH AND MAY TO EDUCATE OVER 400 COMMUNITY MEMBERS REGARDING THE RISK FACTORS FOR HEART DISEASE AND STROKE. -OVER 1,000 COMMUNITY MEMBERS WERE EDUCATED REGARDING HOW TO IDENTIFY STROKE VICTIMS USING F.A.S.T. (FACE DROOPING, ARM WEAKNESS, SPEECH DIFFICULTY, TIME TO CALL 911), AND THE IMPORTANCE OF SEEKING MEDICAL CARE WITHIN ONE HOUR IN ORDER TO SAVE LIVES. THE EDUCATION WAS PROVIDED VIA SEMINARS AND WORKSHOPS WITHIN COMMUNITY AND FAITH ORGANIZATIONS. -DEVELOPED NEW PARTNERSHIPS AND MAINTAINED EXISTING RELATIONSHIPS WITH FAITH-BASED ORGANIZATIONS TO INCREASE THE NUMBER OF PEOPLE WHO PARTICIPATE IN HEALTH EDUCATION WORKSHOPS FOR HEART DISEASE AND STROKE. -ESTABLISHED A STROKE SUPPORT GROUP AT TRINITY HOSPITAL FOR STROKE PATIENTS AND COMMUNITY MEMBERS. ASTHMA -A TOTAL OF 414 ASTHMA PATIENTS ADMITTED TO TRINITY HOSPITAL IN 2016 ENROLLED IN PROJECT HEALTH WHERE THEY HAVE BEEN FOLLOWED UP POST-DISCHARGE BY COMMUNITY HEALTH WORKERS (CHW). -A TOTAL OF 1333 FOLLOW-UP WELLNESS CALLS WERE PROVIDED BY THE CHWS. -OF THE 450 ASTHMA PATIENTS ADMITTED TO TRINITY HOSPITAL FROM JANUARY TO DECEMBER 2016, 10.2% WERE READMITTED WITHIN 30 DAYS AS COMPARED TO 8.9% IN 2015. ALTHOUGH THERE WAS AN INCREASE IN THE RATE FROM 2015 TO 2016, THE READMISSION RATE IS SLIGHTLY LOWER THAN THE BASELINE OF 11%. -OF THE 1084 ASTHMA PATIENTS SEEN IN THE EMERGENCY ROOM, 18% WERE READMITTED WITHIN 30 DAYS AS COMPARED TO 15% IN 2015. -IN 2016, PATIENTS ENROLLED IN PROJECT HEALTH HAD A 12.2% READMISSION RATE COMPARED TO 15.6% IN 2015. -THE PROGRAM CONDUCTED 10 HOME VISITS IN 2016 AS COMPARED TO 5 HOME VISITS IN 2015. NEEDS NOT SELECTED TO ADDRESS IN 2011-2013 CHNA THE KEY HEALTH ISSUES THAT WERE IDENTIFIED AND NOT SPECIFICALLY TARGETED FOR NEW PROGRAMMING IN TRINITYS COMMUNITY HEALTH IMPROVEMENT PLAN WERE CANCER, ACCIDENTS AND HOMICIDE. CANCER TRINITY HOSPITAL IS ADDRESSING THE CANCER CARE NEEDS OF THE COMMUNITY THROUGH ITS ONCOLOGY CENTER AND ONGOING COMMUNITY OUTREACH PROGRAMS DEDICATED TO THE EARLY DETECTION OF CANCER. THESE COMMUNITY OUTREACH PROGRAMS INCLUDE THE LADIES NIGHT THINK PINK EVENT FOR BREAST CANCER PREVENTION EDUCATION AND THE COLON CANCER SCREENING PROGRAM IN COLLABORATION WITH THE AMERICAN CANCER SOCIETY. THE ONCOLOGY CENTERS PROGRAMS ARE STRUCTURED TO FACILITATE A MULTIDISCIPLINARY ENVIRONMENT WHILE PROVIDING MINIMALLY INVASIVE PROCEDURES AND ADVANCED SURGICAL INTERVENTION TO TREAT CANCER. THE ONCOLOGY CENTER INCLUDES ADVANCED DIAGNOSTICS, IMAGING SERVICES, INTERVENTIONAL RADIOLOGY AND AN INFUSION CENTER. ACCIDENTS TRINITY HOSPITAL IMPLEMENTS VARIOUS ACTIVITIES THAT AID IN EDUCATING THE COMMUNITY REGARDING SAFETY AND HOW TO PREVENT ACCIDENTS PARTICULARLY WITHIN THE SENIOR POPULATION SERVED BY THE HOSPITAL. THESE ACTIVITIES INCLUDE EDUCATION FOR SAFE DRIVING AND INJURY/FALL PREVENTION. THE HOSPITAL PARTNERS WITH THE AMERICAN ASSOCIATION OF RETIRED PERSONS (AARP) TO PROVIDE QUARTERLY WORKSHOPS ON DRIVER SAFETY TO EDUCATE SENIORS ON SAFE AND DEFENSIVE DRIVING TECHNIQUES. ADDITIONALLY, THE HOSPITAL UTILIZES ADVANCED PRACTICE NURSES TO PROVIDE COMMUNITY EDUCATION TO PREVENT FALLS AND INJURY IN THE HOME. HOMICIDE TRINITY HOSPITAL CONTINUALLY ASSESSES HOW IT CAN IMPLEMENT STRATEGIES IN SUPPORT OF ITS COMMUNITY PARTNERS TO ADDRESS NEEDS INCLUDING HOMICIDE. COMMUNITY PARTNERS SPECIFICALLY ADDRESSING THIS AND OTHER NEEDS INCLUDE ORGANIZATIONS SUCH AS THE NEIGHBORHOOD CHICAGO ALTERNATIVE POLICING STRATEGY (CAPS) PROGRAM OF THE CHICAGO POLICE DEPARTMENT (CPD). THIS PROGRAM BRINGS COMMUNITIES, POLICE, AND OTHER CITY AGENCIES TOGETHER TO DISCUSS POTENTIAL PROBLEMS AND STRATEGIES TO ADDRESS THEM-WORKING TO PREVENT CRIMES RATHER THAN TO REACT TO CRIMES AFTER THEY HAPPEN. TRINITY HOSPITAL, THROUGH PARTICIPATION IN THE NATIONAL NIGHT OUT EVENT, SUPPORTS THE CPDS EFFORTS TO INCREASE AWARENESS ABOUT VIOLENCE AND TO EDUCATE COMMUNITY MEMBERS REGARDING VIOLENCE PREVENTION, DRUG PREVENTION, TOWN WATCH, NEIGHBORHOOD WATCH AND OTHER ANTI-CRIME EFFORTS. 2014-2016 CHNA AS AN IMPORTANT PART OF THE CHNA PROCESS, TRINITY HOSPITALS COMMUNITY HEALTH TEAM REVIEWED HICCC DATA AS WELL AS ADDITIONAL SERVICE AREA SPECIFIC DATA FROM PRIMARY AND SECONDARY SOURCES. THIS DATA HIGHLIGHTED THE PREVALENT HEALTH ISSUES WITHIN THE HOSPITALS PRIMARY AND SECONDARY SERVICE AREA. AFTER REVIEW OF EXTENSIVE DATA, THE LEADING CAUSES OF DEATH, HOSPITALIZATIONS AND OVERARCHING HEALTH ISSUES WERE SUMMARIZED AND PRESENTED TO THE HOSPITALS COMMUNITY HEALTH COUNCIL (CHC) FOR PRIORITIZATION. DATA PRESENTED TO THE COUNCIL TARGETED THE FOLLOWING HEALTH CONDITIONS IDENTIFIED AS IMPORTANT IN TRINITY HOSPITALS PRIMARY AND SECONDARY SERVICE AREA: ASTHMA, CANCER, DIABETES, HEART DISEASE, HYPERTENSION, STROKE, MENTAL HEALTH AND VIOLENCE. THE FOLLOWING CRITERIA WERE ALSO CONSIDERED IN DETERMINING PRIORITIES: -THE ALIGNMENT OF THE HOSPITALS MISSION, AND EXISTING PROGRAMS; -THE ABILITY TO MAKE AN IMPACT WITHIN A REASONABLE TIME FRAME; -HOSPITAL AND COMMUNITY RESOURCES TO ADDRESS THE HEALTH ISSUE; -THE IMPORTANCE OF THE HEALTH PROBLEM TO THE COMMUNITY AND -AVAILABILITY OF EVIDENCE BASED PROGRAMS WITH PROVEN MEASURABLE OUTCOMES TO ADDRESS IDENTIFIED COMMUNITY NEEDS. AFTER DISCUSSION AND REVIEW OF SIGNIFICANT DATA FINDINGS, THE CHC MEMBERS WERE INSTRUCTED TO RANK THE SEVEN HEALTH CONDITIONS BY VOTING ON THOSE THAT THEY PERCEIVED TO BE THE MOST IMPORTANT TO ADDRESS FOR THE COMMUNITIES WITHIN THE HOSPITALS PRIMARY SERVICE AREA. THE MULTI-VOTING STRATEGY RESULTED IN ASTHMA AND DIABETES RECEIVING THE HIGHEST NUMBER OF VOTES. WORKFORCE DEVELOPMENT WAS SELECTED AS A FOCUS AREA BY CHC MEMBERS AS THE SOCIAL, ECONOMIC OR STRUCTURAL DETERMINANTS OF HEALTH RELATED TO THE HICCC. THEREFORE, FOR THE 2014-2016 CHNA, TRINITY HOSPITAL HAS SELECTED THREE PRIORITIES FOR IMPLEMENTATION PLANNING: ASTHMA, DIABETES, AND WORKFORCE DEVELOPMENT (SOCIAL DETERMINANT OF HEALTH). HEALTH NEEDS SELECTED TO ADDRESS SOCIAL DETERMINANTS OF HEALTH - HEALTHCARE WORKFORCE DEVELOPMENT WITH UNEMPLOYMENT RATES AS HIGH AS 32 PERCENT IN SOME OF THE NEIGHBORHOODS IN CHICAGO, EFFECTIVE WORKFORCE DEVELOPMENT PROGRAMS PLAY A CRUCIAL ROLE IN PREPARING INDIVIDUALS FOR ENTRY-MIDDLE SKILL OPPORTUNITIES WITHIN THE HEALTHCARE SECTOR. THE HEALTHCARE WORKFORCE COLLABORATIVE IS A PARTNERSHIP BETWEEN ADVOCATE HEALTH CARE AND JP MORGAN CHASE BANK TO ESTABLISH AN INTENTIONAL SERIES OF PARTNERSHIPS, AIMED AT ENHANCING THE ALIGNMENT BETWEEN ADDRESSING AVAILABLE HEALTHCARE JOBS AND THE SKILLS OF CURRENT JOB SEEKERS IN THE GREATER CHICAGOLAND AREA. THE PROGRAM AIMS TO DEVELOP AND IMPLEMENT 'BEST PRACTICES' TO BE ADOPTED BY OTHER METROPOLITAN AREAS AND HEALTHCARE ORGANIZATIONS. THE COLLABORATIVE WILL SERVE MORE THAN 1,000 INDIVIDUALS BY 2020, ALL OF WHOM WILL RECEIVE SUPPORTIVE SERVICES AND GUARANTEED POST-PROGRAM INTERVIEWS WITH ADVOCATE OR OTHER REGIONAL HEALTH CARE PROVIDERS. TRINITY HOSPITAL WILL SERVE AS AN INTERNSHIP SITE FOR EDUCATIONAL INSTITUTIONS IN OUR SERVICE AREA. HTTP://WWW.ADVOCATEGIVING.ORG/ABOUT/HEALTHCARE-WORKFORCE-COLLABORATIVE/EXE CUTIVE-SUMMARY/ ASTHMA ASTHMA IS A CONDITION IN WHICH A PERSONS AIR PASSAGES BECOME INFLAMED, AND THE NARROWING OF THE RESPIRATORY PASSAGES MAKES IT DIFFICULT TO BREATHE. ASTHMA IS ONE OF THE MOST COMMON LONG-TERM DISEASES OF CHILDREN. ADDITIONALLY, IT AFFECTS 15.7 MILLION NON-INSTITUTIONALIZED ADULTS NATIONWIDE. SYMPTOMS CAN INCLUDE TIGHTNESS IN THE CHEST, COUGHING, AND WHEEZING. THESE SYMPTOMS ARE OFTEN BROUGHT ON BY EXPOSURE TO INHALED ALLERGENS (DUST, POLLEN, CIGARETTE SMOKE, ANIMAL DANDER, ETC.). AN ASTHMA ATTACK CAN ALSO BE BROUGHT ON BY EXERTION AND STRESS. THERE IS NO CURE FOR ASTHMA BUT, FOR MOST PEOPLE, THE SYMPTOMS CAN BE MANAGED THROUGH A COMBINATION OF LONGER-ACTING MEDICATIONS FOR PREVENTATIVE MAINTENANCE AND SHORT-TERM RESCUE INHALERS FOR ACUTE ATTACKS. IN SOME CASES, HOWEVER, ASTHMA SYMPTOMS ARE SEVERE ENOUGH TO WARRANT HOSPITALIZATION, AND THE DISEASE CAN EVEN RESULT IN DEATH (HEALTHY COMMUNITIES INSTITUTE (HCI), 2016). TRINITY HOSPITALS GOAL IS TO DECREASE THE AGE-AD"
201733179349302768,362169147,ADVOCATE EUREKA HOSPITAL,"2011-2013 CHNA SIGNIFICANT NEED BEING ADDRESSED MENTAL HEALTH MENTAL HEALTH WAS CHOSEN AS A KEY HEALTH PRIORITY BY EUREKA HOSPITAL FOR THE 2011-2013 CHNA FOR SEVERAL REASONS. FIRST, ACCESS TO MENTAL HEALTH SERVICES IN WOODFORD COUNTY WAS SEVERELY LIMITED DUE TO THE CLOSURE OF THE TAZWOOD WELLNESS CENTER SATELLITE FACILITY IN EUREKA IN 2009, THUS CAUSING RESIDENTS TO LEAVE THE COUNTY TO FIND MENTAL HEALTH CARE. SECONDLY, THE RESULTS OF THE 2011 ILLINOIS PROJECT FOR LOCAL ASSESSMENT OF NEED (IPLAN) COMMUNITY HEALTH PLAN AND NEEDS ASSESSMENT FOR WOODFORD COUNTY SHOWED A GROWING NEED FOR MENTAL HEALTH SERVICES IN WOODFORD COUNTY. FINALLY, PARTNERSHIPS WITH THE WOODFORD COUNTY HEALTH DEPARTMENT AND THE TAZWOOD WELLNESS CENTER STRONGLY SUPPORTED THE DECISION. AS OUTLINED IN THE 2014-2016 EUREKA COMMUNITY HEALTH IMPLEMENTATION PLAN FOR MENTAL HEALTH, IN JUNE OF 2014, ADVOCATE BROMENN MEDICAL CENTER, IN PARTNERSHIP WITH EUREKA HOSPITAL, OFFERED AN EVIDENCE-BASED MENTAL HEALTH PROGRAM TO THE COMMUNITY ENTITLED MENTAL HEALTH FIRST AID (MHFA). MENTAL HEALTH FIRST AID IS A NATIONALLY RECOGNIZED ADULT PUBLIC EDUCATION PROGRAM THAT TEACHES INDIVIDUALS HOW TO IDENTIFY, UNDERSTAND AND RESPOND TO THE SIGNS OF MENTAL ILLNESS AND SUBSTANCE ABUSE DISORDERS. CERTIFIED INSTRUCTORS TEACH PARTICIPANTS TO BECOME MENTAL HEALTH FIRST AIDERS. PARTICIPANTS LEARN ABOUT THE SIGNS AND SYMPTOMS OF ACUTE MENTAL HEALTH CRISES AND CHRONIC MENTAL HEALTH PROBLEMS, SUCH AS ANXIETY AND DEPRESSION. IN 2014 AND 2015, EUREKA HOSPITAL COLLABORATED WITH BROMENN MEDICAL CENTER, THE WOODFORD COUNTY HEALTH DEPARTMENT, MCLEAN COUNTY CENTER FOR HUMAN SERVICES, CENTRAL ILLINOIS AREA HEALTH EDUCATION CENTER AND THE MCLEAN COUNTY HEALTH DEPARTMENT IN OFFERING THIS PROGRAM TO THE COMMUNITY. IN 2016, 421 COMMUNITY MEMBERS FROM MCLEAN AND WOODFORD COUNTIES WERE TRAINED IN MENTAL HEALTH FIRST AID (MHFA). IN APRIL 2016, A EUREKA HOSPITAL SOCIAL WORKER BECAME A CERTIFIED MHFA INSTRUCTOR AND COLLABORATED WITH THE WOODFORD COUNTY HEALTH DEPARTMENT TO OFFER COURSES FOR COUNTY RESIDENTS. THE SOCIAL WORKER BEGAN TEACHING COURSES TARGETED SPECIFICALLY FOR WOODFORD AND NEARBY COUNTIES IN OCTOBER 2016. IN OCTOBER, MHFA FOR FIRST RESPONDERS WAS HELD FOR 24 FIRST RESPONDERS AND ON NOVEMBER 1, 2016, MENTAL HEALTH FIRST AID WAS HELD FOR 13 COMMUNITY MEMBERS. THE OUTCOMES MEASURED FOR ACCESS TO MENTAL HEALTH SERVICES INCLUDE THE NUMBER OF PATIENTS VISITING THE EUREKA HOSPITAL EMERGENCY ROOM WITH A BEHAVIORAL HEALTH-RELATED DIAGNOSIS. THE NUMBER OF PATIENTS VISITING EUREKA HOSPITALS EMERGENCY ROOM WITH A BEHAVIORAL HEALTH-RELATED DIAGNOSIS DECREASED OVERALL BY NINE PERCENT FROM 2010 TO 2016, HOWEVER, THE NUMBER OF VISITS STARTED TRENDING UPWARD AGAIN IN 2014. POSITIVELY CONTRIBUTING TO THIS DECREASE ABOVE IS THE COLLABORATION BETWEEN EUREKA HOSPITAL, THE WOODFORD COUNTY HEALTH DEPARTMENT AND THE TAZWOOD WELLNESS CENTER. PARTICIPANTS FROM THESE ENTITIES AND OTHER COMMUNITY ORGANIZATIONS FORM THE WOODFORD COUNTY HEALTH DEPARTMENT IPLAN MENTAL HEALTH SUBCOMMITTEE. AS A RESULT OF THE SUBCOMMITTEES EFFORTS, BEGINNING IN JANUARY 2013, THE TAZWOOD WELLNESS CENTER STAFF BEGAN OFFERING COUNSELING SERVICES ONE TIME PER WEEK AND PSYCHIATRIC SERVICES ONE TIME PER MONTH AT THE WOODFORD COUNTY HEALTH DEPARTMENT. TO ASSIST WITH REFERRALS TO THIS PROGRAM AND WITH EFFECTIVE COMMUNICATION, A EUREKA HOSPITAL SOCIAL WORKER COORDINATED EDUCATIONAL SESSIONS FOR LOCAL ADVOCATE MEDICAL GROUP PHYSICIANS AND THE MEDICAL STAFF SERVING EUREKA HOSPITALS EMERGENCY ROOM. THE HOSPITAL SOCIAL WORKER ALSO COORDINATED EDUCATIONAL SESSIONS FOR THE STAFF AT NURSING HOMES AND WITH WOODFORD COUNTY CLERGY AT DELEGATE CHURCHES. PROVIDING COUNSELING AND PSYCHIATRIC SERVICES AT THE WOODFORD COUNTY HEALTH DEPARTMENT HAS IMPROVED ACCESS TO MENTAL HEALTH SERVICES IN WOODFORD COUNTY. IN 2014, 106 RESIDENTS WERE ABLE TO ACCESS COUNSELING AND PSYCHIATRIC SERVICES WITHIN WOODFORD COUNTY, NO LONGER REQUIRING THEM TO TRAVEL OUTSIDE OF THE COUNTY TO RECEIVE TREATMENT. THIS NUMBER INCREASED TO 143 RESIDENTS IN 2015 AND DECREASED TO 103 IN 2016. IN JUNE 2016, EUREKA HOSPITAL BEGAN OFFERING PSYCHIATRIC AND COUNSELING SERVICES ON-SITE AT THE HOSPITAL IN LIEU OF THEM BEING HELD AT THE WOODFORD COUNTY HEALTH DEPARTMENT. THE TAZWOOD WELLNESS CENTER CONTINUES TO PROVIDE THE STAFF FOR THE MENTAL HEALTH SERVICES HELD ON-SITE AT THE HOSPITAL. NEEDS NOT BEING ADDRESSED OBESITY EUREKA HOSPITAL DID NOT SELECT OBESITY AS A PRIORITY HEALTH NEED FOR THE HOSPITAL FOR THE 2011-2013 COMMUNITY HEALTH NEEDS ASSESSMENT. THE COMMUNITY HEALTH NEEDS ASSESSMENT TEAM DETERMINED THAT OBESITY WAS BEING ADDRESSED BY THE WOODFORD COUNTY HEALTH DEPARTMENT AND ELECTED TO FOCUS ITS EFFORTS ON ONE MAJOR INITIATIVE GIVEN ITS RESOURCES ARE LIMITED AS A CRITICAL ACCESS HOSPITAL. THE HOSPITAL, HOWEVER, EMPLOYS NURSES IN ALL OF THE PUBLIC SCHOOLS IN WOODFORD COUNTY WHO CAN REINFORCE HEALTHIER EATING HABITS AND EXERCISE AMONG STUDENTS. ADDITIONALLY, IN 2016, NUTRITION DAY WAS HELD BY HOSPITAL STAFF AT DAVENPORT ELEMENTARY SCHOOLS IN WOODFORD COUNTY. THE EVENT FOCUSED ON PROVIDING EDUCATION AND STATIONS ON HEALTHY SNACKS, MAKING A NUTRITIONAL MEAL, THE IMPORTANCE OF PHYSICAL ACTIVITY AND HAND HYGIENE. THERE WERE 438 STUDENTS IN ATTENDANCE. ORAL HEALTH ORAL HEALTH WAS THE SECOND HEALTH PRIORITY ISSUE THAT THE HOSPITALS COMMUNITY HEALTH COUNCIL DECIDED NOT TO ADDRESS. ORAL HEALTH IS A HEALTH NEED FOR WHICH THE HOSPITAL HAS LIMITED INFLUENCE. EUREKA HOSPITAL DOES NOT HAVE DENTAL RESIDENTS OR A MOBILE DENTAL VAN, BOTH OF WHICH COULD BE KEY COMPONENTS OF A SUCCESSFUL INTERVENTION. 2014-2016 CHNA EUREKA HOSPITAL PARTICIPATED IN THE PRIORITY SETTING PROCESS AS OUTLINED IN APPENDIX 7, PAGE 102, IN THE TRI-COUNTY COMMUNITY HEALTH NEEDS ASSESSMENT 2016 REPORT. THE LINK FOR THE ASSESSMENT CAN BE FOUND AT: HTTP://HEALTHYHOI.ORG. IN BRIEF, THE FOLLOWING STEPS OCCURRED DURING THE PRIORITIZATION PROCESS WITH THE CENTRAL ILLINOIS COMMUNITY HEALTH COLLABORATIVE. -DATA WAS PRESENTED FOR HEALTH CONCERNS FOR THE TRI-COUNTY REGION -DISCUSSION OCCURRED REGARDING THE ISSUES AND POTENTIAL GROUPING OF ISSUES -THE PEARL TEST WAS APPLIED FROM THE HANLON METHOD -THE COLLABORATIVE COUNCIL VOTED TO NARROW ISSUES -THE COLLABORATIVE COUNCIL VOTED A SECOND TIME BASED ON MAGNITUDE, SEVERITY AND ABILITY TO IMPACT THROUGH COLLABORATION -CONSENSUS WAS AGREED UPON FOR TWO HEALTH PRIORITIES FOR THE TRI-COUNTY REGION THE TWO NEEDS IDENTIFIED DURING THE PRIORITIZATION PROCESS ARE: -HEALTHY EATING/ACTIVE LIVING; AND -MENTAL HEALTH HEALTH NEED SELECTED MENTAL HEALTH THE COMMUNITY HEALTH NEEDS ASSESSMENT TEAM AT EUREKA HOSPITAL SELECTED MENTAL HEALTH AS A HEALTH PRIORITY FOR SEVERAL REASONS. IN ADDITION TO MENTAL HEALTH BEING IDENTIFIED AS A TOP HEALTH PRIORITY FOR THE CENTRAL ILLINOIS COMMUNITY HEALTH COLLABORATIVE, BEHAVIORAL HEALTH WAS ALSO IDENTIFIED AS ONE OF THREE HEALTH PRIORITIES FOR THE TRI-COUNTY HEALTH DEPARTMENT COLLABORATION. THE HEALTH DEPARTMENTS UTILIZED THE MOBILIZING FOR ACTION THROUGH PLANNING AND PARTNERSHIPS (MAPP) PROCESS TO DETERMINE THE HEALTH PRIORITIES. SPECIFIC TO WOODFORD COUNTY, ON DECEMBER 3, 2015, SEVERAL STAFF MEMBERS FROM EUREKA HOSPITAL, INCLUDING THE ADMINISTRATOR OF EUREKA HOSPITAL, PARTICIPATED IN THE LOCAL FORCES OF CHANGE ASSESSMENT CONDUCTED BY THE WOODFORD COUNTY HEALTH DEPARTMENT AS A PART OF THE TRI-COUNTY MAPP PROCESS. MENTAL HEALTH WAS IDENTIFIED AS ONE OF THE TOP THREE FORCES OF CHANGE BY THE 30 INDIVIDUALS THAT PARTICIPATED IN THE ASSESSMENT. FORCES OF CHANGE ARE DEFINED AS THOSE THINGS THAT INFLUENCE THE HEALTH AND QUALITY OF LIFE FOR WOODFORD COUNTY RESIDENTS. A SECOND REASON MENTAL HEALTH WAS SELECTED AS A KEY HEALTH PRIORITY IS THAT WOODFORD COUNTY RESIDENTS THAT PARTICIPATED IN THE 2016 TRI-COUNTY COMMUNITY HEALTH SURVEY PERCEIVED MENTAL HEALTH AS THE SECOND MOST IMPORTANT HEALTH ISSUE IN THE COMMUNITY. IN ADDITION TO THE ABOVE SURVEY DATA AND LOCAL FORCES OF CHANGE ASSESSMENT RESULTS, THE NUMBER OF SUICIDE ATTEMPTS IN WOODFORD COUNTY FOR THE FIRST HALF OF THE YEAR FOR 2016 HAS EXCEEDED THE NUMBER OF ATTEMPTS FOR THE ENTIRE YEAR IN BOTH 2014 AND 2015. THE NUMBER OF DEATHS DUE TO SUICIDE ALSO INCREASED FROM 2014 2015. AS STATED ABOVE, MENTAL HEALTH WAS ALSO PREVIOUSLY SELECTED AS A KEY HEALTH PRIORITY FOR THE 2011-2013 COMMUNITY HEALTH NEEDS ASSESSMENT BY BOTH EUREKA HOSPITAL AND THE WOODFORD COUNTY HEALTH DEPARTMENT. IT IS CLEAR FROM COMMUNITY INPUT AND CURRENT DATA THAT CONTINUED EFFORTS ARE NEEDED TO REDUCE THE STIGMA ASSOCIATED WITH MENTAL HEALTH AND GIVE FURTHER MOMENTUM TO THE EFFORTS OF IMPROVING MENTAL HEALTH FOR COUNTY RESIDENTS. HEALTH NEED NOT SELECTED HEALTHY BEHAVIORS EUREKA HOSPITAL DID NOT SELECT HEALTHY BEHAVIORS AS A PRIORITY HEALTH NEED FOR THE HOSPITALS 2014-2016 COMMUNITY HEALTH NEEDS ASSESSMENT. THE HOSPITAL COMMUNITY HEALTH NEEDS ASSESSMENT TEAM WANTED TO FOCUS ITS EFFORTS ON ONE MAJOR INITIATIVE AS ITS RESOURCES ARE LIMITED AS A CRITICAL ACCESS HOSPITAL. THE HOSPIT"

As stated in the 2016 CHNA, among the most identified pressing needs of the community that will be targeted include: 1. Prevention and management of chronic disease 2. Reduce obesity in children and adults 3. Cancer Prevention & Screening 4. Healthy & Safe Environment (Fall Prevention) These will be addressed through educational programs, screenings, and various community outreach activities.

Springfield Regional Medical Center (SRMC) is addressing the significant needs identified in the most recently conducted CHNA as follows: MENTAL HEALTH SRMC continues to partner with the Clark County Mental Health Task Force to work with the State in the area of medical Mental Health Homes and managed care so our focus in on prevention. A Gatekeepers Reference Card has been developed. The Resource Card is the tool used to evaluate how many persons are referred to Mercy Health and how many of those actually sought services. Additionally, physicians were surveyed to determine how many of their patients are being treated for mental illness, depression, how many are referred to Mercy Health and what triggers a referral. MHRB advocates adoption of treatment overlay; the FQHC provides mental health services; there is an array of Mercy Health providers for adults and youth (Osterlin, Catholic Charities, Well Spring, Rocking Horse-and Medicaid is available through all providers); MHRB is beginning a focus on prevention using the Good Behavior Game (GBG) in local schools, which is also embedded in the local university's education program curriculum; A Trauma informed care initiative at SRMC; Crisis intervention training done by the board on a regular basis to first responders where focus is recognition and referral. CHRONIC DISEASE MANAGEMENT Diabetes - Established an additional ADA certified education site. The Health Resources Center opened in November of 2016 to support post discharge follow up appointments for unattached patients as well as patients with a primary care physician who are unable to be seen by their physician in a timely fashion. Congestive Heart Failure (CHF) - Following the Diabetes successful protocols, a plan was developed for post discharged CHF patients, to track weight, medication compliance, and as well as the admission rates at 30, 60 and 90 days having staffing in place 1st quarter of 2017. Asthma - The Chronic Disease Task Force decreased the number of asthma attacks that required emergency room services by implementing home-based environmental assessments/interventions. There was a 22% decrease in ER visits for asthma between 2015 and 2016. There was a 70% decrease in asthma admissions to inpatient through the ER, from 134 in 2015 to 40 admissions in 2016. Oral Health - In 2016 the first steps to decrease the number of Clark County residents with poor oral health by fluoridation of the public water supply. This included data collection, developing infographic and fact sheets, as well as discussion with local business for support. Next step in 2017 to place a fluoridation ordinance to the city commission for approval. Education and group support for patients with chronic disease will be available to all in the community. SUBSTANCE ABUSE Clark County, like many communities in the country, is experiencing an increase in the use of heroin among other substance abuse trends. The community determined that the primary barrier to improving substance abuse prevention strategies is the overall lack of capacity in the County. In 2016, Community Mercy Health Partners continued the Vivitrol program. This program offers medication assistance treatment (MAT) to our Springfield clients of Mercy REACH, Outpatient Drug, Alcohol and Tobacco rehab program. The Vivitrol Company offers the first injection free to our clients. In partnership with the Substance Abuse task force, through McKinley Hall grant, clients are offered a free NARCAN medication. An inpatient Detox Program was established in the 3rd quarter with 39 self-referrals and 20 completed detox; 15 left AMA. In the 4th quarter we had 46 self-referrals with 35 completing detox and 12 leaving AMA. With the increase of clients in 2016, Mercy REACH hired an additional therapist in the 3rd quarter reducing the client wait from 4 weeks to a 2 week wait period. Identified needs that are not being addressed specifically by SRMC OBESITY As identified in the 2013 CHNA and 2014 Implementation plan, the Obesity Task Force's strategic plan was to implement a child health, multi-dimensional, school-wide, evidence-based program in Lincoln Elementary as a pilot program to determine what works then scale up to additional schools. The Obesity Task Force determined that a core criterion for their decision was prevention, and therefore their focus is on youth in schools, which also engages parents, via a multidimensional, school-wide, child health evidence-based program. Due to the number of school based prevention programs available, the Task Force preferred to present the various programs to school representatives and allow them to select the program that best suits their needs. Although SRMC chose not to specifically address childhood obesity, SRMC recognizes that one third of Americans are overweight. SRMC opened the Springfield Regional Weight Management Solutions due to the challenges associated with weight loss. A weight management solution program was designed specifically for individuals, including Sleeve Gastrectomy, Gastric Bypass, Adjustable Gastric Banding, Robotic Bariatric Surgery and Revision Surgery. In addition to providing surgical weight loss options, we also offer counseling, support group programs, meal planning and fitness programs to guide our patients to become healthier individuals. In 2016, SRMC added 163 new patients to our surgical program, 50 new patients to our non-surgical program, and 91 patients attended support groups throughout the year. Total lbs. lost for our surgical program - 4574 lbs., Total lbs. lost for our non-surgical program - 845 lbs. In 2016, 12 unduplicated individuals qualified for assistance with 48 cases of ensure health supplement. HEALTHY BIRTHS/SEXUALITY Strategic plan - To identify and engage pregnant women in first trimester prenatal care. Partnering Agencies are Clark County Combined Health District including its WIC program, the Community Foundation, the Pregnancy Resource Center, Clark County Department of Job and Family Services, and Springfield's Women's Network. The gap analysis uncovered the need for better outreach to pregnant women to get them to the FQHC's OB program. A concerning proportion of pregnant women delay prenatal care, and this trend is especially evident among the growing Spanish speaking-only households, where it is not uncommon for pregnant women to get a confirmation of pregnancy at 4-6 months. An SRMC Mother Baby educator participated in the Clark County Healthy Births/Sexuality Task Force in support of the needs as follows: * Decrease in the teen birthrate 15-17 year olds for Clark County * Increase in percent of infants born to pregnant women receiving prenatal care beginning in the first trimester * Minority populations and other vulnerable populations have increased access to sexual health information and services."

Mercy Memorial Hospital is addressing the significant needs identified in the most recently conducted CHNA as follows: MENTAL HEALTH The goal to provide a safe room in the Emergency Department at Mercy Memorial Hospital was met in 2015. The room is fully enclosed and specially designed to remove all potentially dangerous objects. There is a monitoring system that provides safety for the staff in the case of violent patients and also eliminates the need for a ""sitter"" which upholds the dignity of the patient. A Precision Medicine program was started in 2016 to support appropriate medication for mental health patients. Using the patient's DNA, the prescriber can tell which anti-depressant, anti-psychotic or ADHD medication will be likely to work. While no guarantee, it has cut down on moving through multiple medications with an average cost savings just in pharmaceuticals to consumers of approximately $1,000.00 annually. This also can reduce the cost of treatment for side effects, added visits to the healthcare provider or testing that may not be needed. MMH's NP is meeting with outpatient mental health once a month, with a focus on streamlining the process and support all mental health collaborative issues. NUTRITION AND EXERCISE A fitness center was opened for employees at Mercy Memorial Hospital in 2015 to promote wellness for employees. Employees are taking advantage to the fitness center noting the opportunity to use before or after work, eliminating an extra stop at a community gym and eliminating the cost of membership. Continue to operate the fitness center. Mercy Memorial Hospital partnered with the YMCA beginning in 2016 to develop and execute a 12 week community diabetes prevention program. In 2016, 44 persons were served. Other actions taken by MMH in 2016 include: * A Healthy Kids Day event promoting the 5-2-1 Almost None program. 325 children served * A Go Red for Women program focused on heart health and healthy eating. Served 45 persons * A health fair event with the Champaign County Health Department program on Healthy Eating served 41 persons. CHRONIC DISEASE MANAGEMENT The Chronic Care Clinic at MMH, opened in May of 2015 provides post discharge, follow up appointments for patients without a primary care physician, medication reconciliation and support in finding a medical home. The recent reduction in readmissions in 2015 has been attributed to the clinic. The Chronic Care Clinic continued focus on patients without a primary care physician, to provide follow up visits after discharge from the ED and inpatient setting in 2016. MMH also established an additional ADA certified education site at MMH to provide education for diabetic patients in Champaign County. The Chronic Care Clinic at mercy Memorial Hospital continued focus on patients without a primary care physician, to provide follow up visits after discharge from the ED and inpatient setting. Identified needs that are not being addressed specifically by Mercy Memorial Hospital: YOUTH SUBSTANCE ABUSE AND WELLNESS: Other community agencies are specifically designed and better prepared to address this health need. MMH continues to support groups such as Champaign County Drug Free Youth Coalition, Champaign County Family and Children First Council, Triad Local Schools North Lewisburg, Ohio and Mercy Well Child Pediatrics, Urbana Ohio."

Qualitative data input includes primary research gathered through an Online Key Informant Survey of various community stakeholders. Online Key Informant Survey --------------------------- In an effort to solicit input from key informants, those individuals who have a broad interest in the health of the community, the organization utilized an Online Key Informant Survey as part of its CHNA process. A list of recommended participants was provided by the Community Health Improvement Partnership of Bergen County; this list included names and contact information for physicians, public health representatives, other health professionals, social service providers, and a variety of other community leaders. Potential participants were chosen because of their ability to identify primary concerns of the populations with whom they work, as well as of the community overall. Key informants were contacted by email, introducing the purpose of the survey and providing a link to take the survey online; reminder emails were sent as needed to increase participation. In all, 75 community stakeholders in Bergen County took part in the Online Key Informant Survey. Through this process, input was gathered from several individuals whose organizations work with low-income, minority populations, or other medically underserved populations. Minority/medically underserved populations represented include: African-Americans, Asians, children, day laborers, the disabled, elderly population, foster children, those with high deductibles, Hispanics, the homeless, immigrants, Koreans, residents with low education level, low income residents, Medicare/Medicaid recipients, the mentally ill, MICA clients, Native Americans, non-English speaking persons, obese individuals, students attending schools in low income areas, teenage mothers, undocumented individuals, unemployed residents, the uninsured/underinsured, veterans. In the online survey, key informants were asked to rate the degree to which various health issues are a problem in their own community. Follow-up questions asked them to describe why they identify problem areas as such, and how these might be better addressed. Results of their ratings, as well as their verbatim comments, are included in EHMCs CHNA.

These areas were determined after consideration of various criteria, including: standing in comparison with benchmark data (particularly national data); the preponderance of significant findings within topic areas; the magnitude of the issue in terms of the number of persons affected; and the potential health impact of a given issue. On August 4, 2016 EHMC, along with the Bergen County Department of Health Services and the other hospitals sponsoring the broader Bergen County assessment project, convened a group of community stakeholders (representing a cross-section of community-based agencies and organizations) to evaluate, discuss and prioritize health issues for Bergen County, based on findings of the countywide CHNA. The results of this prioritization will inform the selection of priorities for each of the hospitals in its respective service area. PRC began the meeting with a presentation of key findings from the CHNA, highlighting the significant health issues identified from the research. Following the data review, PRC answered any questions and facilitated a group dialogue, allowing participants to advocate for any of the health issues discussed. Finally, participants were provided an overview of the prioritization exercise that followed. In order to assign priority to the identified health needs (Areas of Opportunity), a wireless audience response system was used in which each participant was able to register his/her ratings using a small remote keypad. Individuals' ratings for each criteria were averaged for each tested health issue, and then these composite criteria scores were averaged to produce an overall score. This process yielded the following prioritized list of community health needs: 1. Substance Abuse 2. Mental Health 3. Diabetes 4. Nutrition, Physical Activity, & Weight 5. Access to Healthcare Services 6. Heart Disease & Stroke 7. Dementias, Including Alzheimers Disease 8. Immunization & Infectious Diseases 9. Cancer EHMC is committed to achieving the ""triple aim"": improved health through better quality of care at lower costs. To address the needs of its community, EHMC allocated significant resources to ensure achievement of the CHNA implementation strategy goals. Additionally, EHMC has developed a Population Health Department which includes both clinical and support services. EHMC is dedicated to being a beacon of health for its community. EHMC has prioritized the significant needs identified into the following Goals: Goal 1: Increase Access to Health Care Through Population Health Management ---------------------------------------------------------------- 1) Expand primary and preventative care to meet the community needs; 2) Enhance access and convenience to meet consumer expectations; 3) Ensure adequate network of providers to meet needs of community; 4) Develop a system-wide care management program; 5) Develop population-specific programs to ensure access to care; and 6) Partner with local communities and community based agencies to provide resources and expertise in achieving healthy populations. Goal 2: Promote Behavioral Health --------------------------------- 1) Continue to offer behavioral health education and screenings to the community; 2) Integrate behavioral health into the primary care setting; 3) Increase population-specific programs and services; and 4) Collaborate with other providers on cross continuum initiatives.

This intervention was selected based on observed mental health disparities in Central Brooklyn and multiple key stakeholders at community events requesting mental health interventions directly in the community, with one faith-based representative requesting the intervention by name. * The Screening, Assessment and Treatment Services recommended intervention for local action has been selected by IMC as the evidence-based intervention to address Promote Mental Health & Prevent Substance Abuse Priority Focus Area 2: Prevent Substance Abuse and Other Mental Emotional Behavioral Disorders. This intervention will promote the coordination of mental health practitioners with other care providers through the hospitals DSRIP-related programs and activities overseen by its Performing Provider System (PPS) that institutionalize the use of screenings such as the PHQ-9, DAST, and AUDIT through the Patient-Centered Medical Home (PCMH+) Initiative.

This intervention will increase the number of institutions with nutrition standards for healthy food and beverage procurement and was selected based on obesity, diabetes, and other nutrition-related illness surveillance data and community feedback (both in workgroups and listening sessions) on access to healthy foods. While several health issues, unhealthy behaviors, and social determinants of health that merit prioritization and action were identified through the CHNA, the hospital will not address the following issues specifically through its 2016-2018 CSP: * Angry Behavioral/Violence: the hospital is unable to single-handedly confront violence directly like law enforcement, but through mental health and substance abuse programs the hospital will address these issues. * Child Abuse: it is not the hospitals specialty to address child abuse directly like the Administration for Childrens Services, but through mandated reporter requirements for healthcare professionals the hospital will address this issue. * Domestic Violence: because of limited hospital resources IMC utilizes NYC and NYS public health resources like Partner Services to assess, aid, and address people in need of services."

THERE WERE 496 RESPONDENTS. *TARGETED SURVEY: AFTER SURVEY RESULTS WERE COLLECTED, THE MAPP EXECUTIVE COMMITTEE REALIZED THAT THE SURVEY RESPONDENTS DID NOT REFLECT THE DEMOGRAPHICS OF WILL COUNTY. IN ORDER TO OBTAIN THE PERSPECTIVE OF RESIDENTS UNDERREPRESENTED IN THE RANDOM SURVEY, TARGETED SURVEYS WERE DISTRIBUTED IN JANUARY 2014 TO GATHER ADDITIONAL INFORMATION FROM VULNERABLE POPULATIONS. EIGHTY-THREE PARTICIPANTS GAVE THEIR INPUT ON STRENGTHS AND ASSETS OF THEIR COMMUNITY AND THEIR PERCEPTION ABOUT THE QUALITY OF LIFE IN WILL COUNTY THROUGH THESE TARGETED SURVEYS. *PHOTOVOICE: THE THIRD METHOD USED FOR DATA COLLECTION. PHOTOVOICE IS A TECHNIQUE THAT ENABLES COMMUNITY RESIDENTS OF ALL AGES AND LANGUAGES TO SHARE INFORMATION ABOUT THEIR COMMUNITIES THROUGH PICTURES. TWENTY-EIGHT PHOTOS WERE RECEIVED FROM A NUMBER OF RESIDENTS IN WILL COUNTY. FORCES OF CHANGE ASSESSMENT (FOCA): THE FOCA WAS COMPLETED IN SEPTEMBER 2013 WITH 41 PARTICIPANTS, CONSISTING OF MAPP EXECUTIVE COMMITTEE MEMBERS AND OTHER COMMUNITY LEADERS.

The focus group participants included a total of 26 key informants, including physicians, other health professionals, social service providers, and other business and community leaders. A list of recommended participants for the focus groups was provided by the study sponsors. Potential participants were chosen because of their ability to identify primary concerns of the populations with whom they work, as well as the community overall. Participants included several individuals who work with low-income, minority, or other medically underserved populations. Focus group candidates were first contacted by letter to request their participation. Follow-up phone calls were then made to ascertain whether they would be able to attend. Confirmation calls were placed the day before the group was scheduled in order to ensure a reasonable turnout. When requested, all of these stakeholders provided input. METHODOLOGY: To ensure the best representation of the population surveyed, a telephone interview methodology - one that incorporates both landline and cell phone interviews - was employed.

201733179349302873,840166760,"SCHEDULE H, PART V, SECTION B, LINE 5","THE FOLLOWING DESCRIPTION FOR SCHEDULE H, PART V, SECTION B, LINE 5 APPLIES TO ALL HOSPITAL FACILITIES INCLUDED IN FACILITY REPORTING GROUP A: Before launching the 2015 Community Health Needs Assessment, Childrens Hospital Colorado conducted a review of the prior health needs assessment, which was produced in 2012. To inform the current assessment, we asked both internal and external parties to read the prior report and submit written feedback. Representatives from public health, policy and advocacy, clinical practice and the nonprofit sector provided feedback on the 2012 report. We also commissioned a professor with the Colorado School of Public Health to conduct a formal review of the prior health needs assessment and implementation strategy. To prepare the 2015 CHNA, Childrens Hospital Colorado engaged in a comprehensive process of gathering data and input from nonprofit organizations, government agencies, public health departments, the business community and individual parents and community members. Data collection included 40 key informant interviews, 9 focus groups (92 parent participants), an online survey that was completed by 346 parents and 13 comprehensive data reports. Special effort was made to solicit input for the CHNA report from underserved populations. Outreach to these populations included contacting nonprofit organizations that represent the interests of underserved groups and including them in stakeholder interviews. Key organizations contacted included: Colorado Coalition for the Medically Underserved, Colorado Black Health Collaborative, Commit Crisis Center, The Fields Foundation, Promotoras de Salud, Rocky Mountain Youth Clinic and Street Smart. Please refer to the CHNA for a complete list of stakeholders. Focus groups were held in partnership with local nonprofit organizations. Emphasis was placed on working with groups that serve low-income and at-risk parents. Focus groups for this targeted population included two sessions at the Hoffman Youth Center in Ward 1 of Aurora. One session was conducted in English and one session was conducted in Spanish. One session was at the Epworth United Methodist Church in central Denver in a predominantly African American neighborhood. The other was at the Fields Opportunity Center with pregnant and parenting teens. Two sessions were at the Commit Crisis Center with homeless families that were temporarily residing at the center. One of the two sessions specifically targeted homeless veterans. A total of nine focus groups were conducted in a variety of locations. Collectively, there were 92 parent participants of which 80% of participants utilize Medicaid benefits. Recognizing that the number of individuals who could be reached through interviews and focus groups was inherently limited, the hospital also sought to reach a significantly greater number of community members through an online survey. To compensate for lack of Internet access among some populations, a paper version of the survey was distributed in community health clinics, at a mobile home community and at a child care center for low-income families. The survey was available in both English and Spanish and had a total of 346 respondents. Since more demographic information was collected for the parent survey, we were able to analyze the results in a more in-depth manner. First, an analysis of the top-rated issues/concerns was performed with differences noted between the English language and Spanish language survey responses. Next, we sorted results by county as well as by income levels to determine significant variations in the issues identified as top concerns. This approach permitted the team to gain insight into a large cross section of the population. Overall, 42 percent of respondents were ethnic minorities and close to one-third of respondents had household incomes of less than $50,000 per year."

201733179349302873,840166760,"SCHEDULE H, PART V, SECTION B, LINE 11","THE FOLLOWING DESCRIPTION FOR SCHEDULE H, PART V, SECTION B, LINE 11 APPLIES TO ALL HOSPITAL FACILITIES INCLUDED IN FACILITY REPORTING GROUP A: An internal leadership committee established criteria that would be used to analyze the data collected and select the issues that the hospital will focus on for the coming years. Those criteria include: Scale these issues touch a large number of children; Impact these issues have significant effectS on children; Community Interest community members expressed concern about these issues through the various channels we used to gather input; and Sustainability Childrens Hospital Colorado has the resources needed to address these issues. Once the criteria were established, the final step in the process was to present the research findings to key stakeholders and ask them for input on the issues that the hospital will prioritize. Two different prioritization meetings were held, one with representatives from nonprofit, government and public health agencies, and one with internal hospital leadership. There was clear consensus among both groups that mental health, obesity/nutrition/physical activity and oral health were high priorities. Also, further discussion with hospital leadership led to the conclusion that some areas prioritized by the internal team and community (medical home, parent education) are strategies for addressing key issues. While these strategies will be considered as part of the implementation plan, for the purposes of the needs assessment, they were not included in the list of top priorities. We acknowledge that the community raised numerous other concerns and that the data supports the need to address a wide range of issues. However, we believe that concentrating our efforts in these three key areas will have the most meaningful and lasting impact. It should be noted that mental health and obesity were also identified as priorities in the 2012 CHNA, and the hospital has launched programs that address these needs and will continue to expand our work in these respective priority areas. It is also important to point out that in addition to the above identified priority needs, the hospital will sustain our current work on three issues that are critical to the long-term health and wellness of children in our community: Injury, prematurity and respiratory illness. The above-mentioned priorities were identified in the CHNA as data driven priorities. Once the CHNA priorities were selected, Childrens Hospital Colorado developed and employed several strategies to address the health concerns identified in the 2015 community health needs assessment. These actions included partnering with community organizations to develop data-driven approaches to identify targeted neighborhoods and populations for program implementation, developing the three-year implementation plan to guide activities focused in identified health priority areas, and formalizing the measures and tracking mechanisms to inform program planning and measure outreach and impact. In early 2016, Childrens Hospital Colorado partnered with the Colorado Health Institute to develop a child health severity index to identify ZIP codes where youth have the most severe health concerns. The interactive map was developed with the six prioritized health needs in mind, and helped prioritize where there was the greatest need and opportunities to address the priority health needs. Childrens Hospital Colorado used this index to identify the initial ZIP codes to target programmatic efforts and develop the appropriate partnerships within the hospitals urban centers. We will continue to refer to this map was we expand our programs into other communities. Childrens Hospital Colorado also began a partnership with Aurora Public Schools (APS) to promote community-based programs and services in the school setting. Through this partnership, Childrens Hospital Colorado and APS will begin implementing programs to address students top health needs, including oral health and mental health-related programs and services. In May 2016, our three-year implementation plan to address the six community health priority areas was finalized and approved by the CHCO Board of Directors. Strategies in the report were driven by the 2015 CHNA and the neighborhoods with high needs identified through the child health severity index. Following the implementation plan, we developed over 80 measures to track outreach and impact of each priority areas programs and initiatives. Our measures will include: tracking the volume of educational workshops and trainings, growth in community partnerships and collaborations to expand and develop new programs to address community health needs, improved coordination of care and community-based services and supports, improved access to programs and services, and changes in health outcomes. Measures will continuously be tracked and reviewed to improve processes and ensure the programs are meeting their intended goals and populations. To date, data has been collected for 38 of the measures (43%), 35 measures are in process (39%) and 16 measures are in the planning and/or under revision (18%)."

The facilities serve a diverse population in Westchester County and share an authorized body which adopted the assessment in 2016. The St. John's CHNA was developed during 2016 in collaboration with the Westchester County Department of Health's 'Health and Hospital Planning Teamthe Montefiore Hudson Valley Collaborative Performing Provider System (PPS) Hospital Group, and referenced the 'One Region, One CNA' - An Eight County Community Needs Assessment Undertaken in Collaboration With: Westchester Medical Center, Montefiore Medical Center, Refuah Health Center and Health Alliance of the Hudson Valley, December 2014. The Westchester County Department of Health (WCDOH), http://health.westchestergov.com/, and the Montefiore Hudson Valley Collaborative PPS, http://www.montefiore.org/hudson-valley-collaborative, Community Health Needs Assessments, which meet both IRS and NYS needs assessment and service plan requirements, contain more detailed information and data on the health status of the population and distribution of health issues based on analysis of demographic factors and identification of the main health challenges facing the community; as well as a discussion of the contributing causes of these challenges, including broad determinants of health. Our partner sessions gave the opportunity for area hospitals to discuss NYS Prevention Agenda priorities, feedback from their public needs assessments, services provided, gaps in service and best practices. While all hospitals in Westchester County share the same priorities, each hospital selected priorities that aligned with their mission, were attainable, and created a program that best suited its institution and patient service area. The public input process also encompassed collaboration with the following partners: City of Yonkers/SJRH's Healthy Yonkers Initiative and the SJRH community advisory committee. A multidisciplinary group was involved in assessing community health needs in Westchester County with public participation solicited via a survey sponsored by the WCDOH and community partners. The collaborative process was beneficial in researching current health data, conducting health needs assessments within our communities, sharing of best practice interventions and leveraging of resources. To determine the most pressing health needs of our community, we surveyed members of the medically underserved, low-income, and minority population in the SJRH service area, who represent the health interests of our patients and their families. St. John's leadership also considered its own resources, strengths, and abilities in the selection of SJRH's priority community needs. To help support and coordinate this collaboration, the WCDOH invited all Westchester hospitals to attend a kick-off meeting in April 2016. To support in the selection of priorities the WCDOH's Health and Hospital Planning Team held collaborative meetings from April through November 2016. The collection of primary data from a sample of the Westchester County residents was an important element of the development of the Community Health Needs Assessment. SJRH engaged with the WCDOH's on-line Community Resident and Provider Health Surveys to facilitate the implementation of the data collection process. We identified the following partners to help implement interventions identified in our community health needs ASSESSMENT: Hudson River HealthCare FQHC, Hudson Community Health Alliance's Local IMPACT Initiative, primary practice offices, Cancer Coalition of Westchester, Healthy Yonkers Initiative, SJRH Behavioral Health Services, SJRH Community Advisory Team, Westchester County Department of Health and the Montefiore Hudson Valley Collaborative. Our planning team also conducted a survey of selected stakeholders representing health care and service-providing agencies within the county. The purpose of the study was to provide feedback from community service providers in order to: 1) guide strategic planning, 2) highlight topics for increased public awareness, 3) identify areas for training, and 4) inform the statewide Prevention Agenda. The survey was developed through a collaborative effort by an eighteen-member survey committee representing county public health department and local hospitals during the spring-summer of 2016. A total of 1,318 community surveys and 218 provider surveys were conducted May 16 to June 30, 2016. To ensure a broad assessment of our community health needs, we engaged a variety of participants including, but not limited to, the community-at-large through local residents participating in SJRH speaker's bureau's heath education programs. We shared health data and sought feedback through the following SJRH groups: community advisory committee, pastoral care committee, physician alignment committee, radiology advisory committee, wellness committee, board of trustees and our employees. SJRH also gathered information from external sources by conducting public forums at the Cross County Shopping Center in Yonkers, New York and other health sessions held at select locations to address the community that represented the diverse population that we serve. We plan to provide ongoing opportunities for hospitals and other stakeholders, i.e. community-based organizations, to strategize on how to address health priorities. We will also work with partners to provide more refined data to track and evaluate progress in achieving goals related to selected priorities. SJRH will continue to communicate with other community-based organizations regarding advocacy, participation in local community events, and exchange of referral information. Engaging local community members in our efforts enables us to involve our health care institution and the community in the activities of national health advocacy organizations, including walks, fairs, and other awareness-raising activities for health issues that impact the community.

201723179349303037,141338428,ELLIS HOSPITAL,"PART V, SECTION B, LINE 11: SCHENECTADY'S 2013 COMMUNITY HEALTH NEEDS ASSESSMENT IDENTIFIED FIFTEEN HEALTH NEEDS. THE 2016 CHNA FOCUSED MORE SPECIFICALLY ON TWO HEALTH NEEDS: 1) CHRONIC DISEASE (OBESITY AND DIABETES) AND 2) MENTAL HEALTH (SUICIDE AND M/E/B INFRASTRUCTURE). THE 2016 CHNA, HOWEVER, CONTINUED TO IDENTIFY ALL FIFTEEN HEALTH NEEDS FROM 2013 AS REMAINING IN NEED OF ATTENTION. DURING 2014 THROUGH 2016 ELLIS HOSPITAL, SCHENECTADY COUNTY PUBLIC HEALTH SERVICES, AND THEIR COMMUNITY PARTNERS TOOK ACTIONS TO ADDRESS SUCH NEEDS, COMMENSURATE WITH THE PRIORITY OF EACH NEED AND THE AVAILABILITY OF RESOURCES. ACTIONS INCLUDED THE FOLLOWING:-ASTHMA AND SMOKING: SCHENECTADY COUNTY PUBLIC HEALTH SERVICES, ELLIS, AND OTHER COMMUNITY ORGANIZATIONS APPLIED FOR AND RECEIVED A GRANT FROM NEW YORK STATE HEALTH FOUNDATION TO SUPPORT A ""SCHENECTADY ASTHMA SUPPORT COLLABORATIVE"" (SASC). A REQUIRED LOCAL CASH MATCH WAS PROVIDED BY THE SCHENECTADY FOUNDATION, THE GE FOUNDATION, AND MVP HEALTHCARE. SERVICES OF A COLLABORATIVE MODEL COMBINING CARE MANAGEMENT, PATIENT EDUCATION, AND IN-HOME NURSING SERVICES BEGAN IN LATE 2014, WITH THE GRANT PERIOD ENDING IN DECEMBER 2015. SASC CREATED A SEAMLESS THREE-TIERED CARE MODEL (CENTRALIZED CARE COORDINATION, HOME VISITS/ASSESSMENTS, AND ASTHMA EDUCATION). OVER THE COURSE OF THE PROJECT, 68 PATIENTS CONSENTED TO PARTICIPATE IN CARE COORDINATION. WHILE 57 (84%) OF THESE REMAINED ENGAGED AFTER TWO MONTHS, ONLY 13 (19%) COMPLETED BOTH THE HOME VISITS AND ASTHMA EDUCATION COMPONENTS. THE PROJECT'S FINAL REPORT CONCLUDED THAT CULTURAL DYNAMICS (""FATALISM"") AND STRUCTURAL BARRIERS (ISSUES OF TRUST) MAY HAVE PREVENTED INDIVIDUALS FROM ACCESSING OPTIMAL CARE.ALTHOUGH THE PROJECT CLEARLY DEMONSTRATED THE CHALLENGES OF ENGAGING PATIENTS, THE CLINICAL ASPECTS OF THE THREE-TIERED MODEL REMAIN VALID. THE DESIGN OF THE SCHENECTADY MODEL WAS USED TO INFORM DEVELOPMENT OF ASTHMA PROJECTS ACROSS THE SIX-COUNTY SERVICE AREA OF THE REGIONAL DSRIP PARTNERSHIP, THE ALLIANCE FOR BETTER HEALTH CARE.ELLIS AND THE SCHENECTADY CITY SCHOOL DISTRICT (SCSD) PARTICIPATED IN THE ""SCHOOL-BASED ASTHMA MANAGEMENT PROGRAM,"" WHICH FOR THE 2015-16 SCHOOL YEAR ENROLLED 84 OF THE 1,137 DIAGNOSED ASTHMATICS IN SCSD. THIS ENROLLMENT TRIPLED THAT OF THE 2014-15 SCHOOL YEAR. THE PROGRAM ADMINISTERED 347 ALBUTEROL TREATMENTS, ENABLING STUDENTS TO RETURN TO CLASS 96% OF THE TIME. (IN 12 CASES THE STUDENT WAS SENT HOME TO RECOVER, AND THERE WAS ONLY ONE INSTANCE WHEN THE STUDENT WENT TO THE EMERGENCY DEPARTMENT.) IN ADDITION TO THE IN-SCHOOL COMPONENT, NEARLY A THIRD OF THE STUDENTS AND THEIR PARENTS ATTENDED OUTPATIENT ASTHMA SELF-MANAGEMENT TRAINING SESSIONS THROUGH ELLIS ASTHMA CARE.THE ELLIS ASTHMA EDUCATION PROGRAM FOUND THAT ""GRADUATES"" ACHIEVE A 60-70% REDUCTION IN EMERGENCY DEPARTMENT VISITS OVER 12 MONTHS POST-DISCHARGE.A CARE MANAGER FROM THE ELLIS-SPONSORED HEALTH HOME COMPLETED A TWO-DAY ASTHMA TRAINING COURSE.ELLIS CONTINUED ITS STRONG ASTHMA EDUCATION PROGRAM, AND CONTINUED TO COLLABORATE WITH THE CAPITAL DISTRICT TOBACCO FREE COALITION.

IHANY WAS SUCCESSFUL IN REDUCING EMERGENCY DEPARTMENT USE BY ITS ATTRIBUTED PATIENTS DURING ITS FIRST YEAR OF OPERATIONS.LEVERAGING DATA MINING OF PATIENTS' INTAKE REGISTRATION FORMS, ELLIS CREATED A COMPUTER APPLICATION THAT IDENTIFIES ALL EMERGENCY DEPARTMENT PATIENTS WHO PRESENT WITHOUT A PRIMARY CARE PROVIDER LISTED ON THEIR REGISTRATION FORM. THIS INFORMATION IS THEN SORTED AND GIVEN TO CENTRAL SCHEDULING. DURING THE PATIENT'S TIME IN THE EMERGENCY DEPARTMENT, THEY RECEIVE EDUCATIONAL INFORMATION ABOUT THE DIFFERENT SETTINGS FOR CARE AND TIPS ON HOW TO PICK THE MOST APPROPRIATE SETTING - EMERGENCY DEPARTMENT, URGENT CARE, OR PRIMARY CARE.

THE PLANNING GROUP MET REGULARLY TO DISCUSS THE DATA, COMMUNITY INPUT, AND HEALTH PRIORITIES. INPUT WAS COLLECTED FROM A LARGE COMMUNITY FORUM WITH STAKEHOLDER FEEDBACK ON COMMUNITY STRENGTHS, WEAKNESSES, AND PRIORITY AREAS FOR IMPROVEMENT. A CHA/CHIP PLANNING TEAM COMPRISED OF OCHD, FSL, SEMC AND RMH STAFF MET REGULARLY STARTING IN EARLY 2016. THE PLANNING TEAM MET TO REVIEW AND DISCUSS THE 2016-2018 CHA/CHIP UPDATE PROCESS, CLARIFY EXPECTATIONS, AND DEVELOP A DETAILED WORK PLAN WITH TEAM RESPONSIBILITIES, ASSIGNED TASKS, AND DEADLINES TO DEVELOP AND FINALIZE THE PLAN UPDATE. THE PLANNING TEAM CAME TO CONSENSUS ON THE APPROACH TO UPDATE THE CHA AND REASSESS PRIORITIES ESTABLISHED IN THE CHIP. DATA FROM THE ONEIDA COUNTY PREVENTION AGENDA DASHBOARD, NEW YORK STATE QUITLINE PARTNERS REPORTS, ONEIDA COUNTY TEEN ASSESSMENT PROJECT (TAP), PEDIATRIC NUTRITION SURVEILLANCE SYSTEM (PEDNSS) REPORTS, COUNTY HEALTH RANKINGS, BRIDGES COMMUNITY SURVEY, AND THE CNY CARE COLLABORATIVE (CNYCC) COMMUNITY HEALTH ASSESSMENT WERE REVIEWED TO ASSESS AREAS FOR IMPROVEMENT AND STATUS IN ACHIEVING THE GOALS AND OBJECTIVES OUTLINED IN THE PREVIOUS CHIP. THE CNYCC COMMUNITY HEALTH ASSESSMENT AND WORK TO SUPPORT THE DELIVERY SYSTEM REFORM INCENTIVE PAYMENT PROGRAM (DSRIP), AN INITIATIVE TO TRANSFORM THE HEALTH SYSTEM OF NEW YORK STATE, WERE ALSO FACTORED INTO THE ASSESSMENT PROCESS. IN MARCH 2016, THE PLANNING TEAM PRESENTED TO THE ONEIDA COUNTY HEALTH COALITION GENERAL MEMBERSHIP (APPROXIMATELY 60 PEOPLE IN ATTENTANCE) INFORMATION ON THE CHA AND CHIP ACTIVITIES. THE OCHC IS COMPRISED OF BROAD REPRESENTATION OF SECTORS AND ORGANIZATIONS THAT CONVENE UNDER THE DIRECTION OF THE OCHD TO DISCUSS AND ANALYZE DATA ON VARIOUS HEALTH ISSUES AND TRENDS. PARTNERS WERE PROVIDED WITH A SUMMARY OF THE PREVENTION AGENDA DATA AND THE SELECTED CHIP FOCUS AREAS AND WORK GROUP ACTIVITIES. MEMBERS WERE APPRISED OF AND INVITED TO PARTICIPATE IN THE WORK GROUPS AND COMMUNITY HEALTH ASSESSMENT ACTIVITIES. AS A FOLLOW UP TO COLLECT MORE IN-DEPTH PARTNER FEEDBACK, IN MAY 2016, THE PLANNING TEAM CONVENED MEMBERS OF THE ONEIDA COUNTY HEALTH COALITION STEERING COMMITTEE, A GROUP OF APPROXIMATELY 20 COMMUNITY AGENCIES AND ORGANIZATIONS THAT OVERSEE AND GUIDE THE LARGER COMMUNITY HEALTH PARTNERSHIP. PARTNERS WERE PRESENTED WITH AN OVERVIEW OF THE COMMUNITY HEALTH ASSESSMENT UPDATE AND COMMUNITY HEALTH IMPROVEMENT PLAN REQUIREMENTS, CHIP WORK GROUP PROJECTS, TIMELINES, AND STATUS IN ACHIEVING THE DEFINED GOALS AND OBJECTIVES. THE PREVENTION AGENDA INDICATOR DATA AND GOALS WERE REVIEWED ALONG WITH AN OVERVIEW OF HOW EACH OF THE FOCUS AREAS ALIGN WITH HOSPITAL DSRIP INITIATIVES, SPECIFICALLY: THE INITIATIVES OF THE TOBACCO CESSATION WORK GROUP ALIGNED WITH DSRIP FOCUS AREAS TO DSRIP 4.D.I. - REDUCE PRETERM BIRTHS AND DSRIP 3.B.I. - CARDIOVASCULAR DISEASE MANAGEMENT AND THE INITIATIVES OF THE BREASTFEEDING WORK GROUP INDIRECTLY ALIGN WITH DSRIP GOALS (E.G., HEALTHY START FOR BABIES AND HEALTH BENEFITS TO MOTHER) TO REDUCE UNNECESSARY UTILIZATION THROUGH PRIMARY PREVENTION. THE PLANNING TEAM OUTLINED ITS SUCCESSES AND CHALLENGES AND OBTAINED INPUT FROM THE STEERING COMMITTEE ON AREAS FOR IMPROVEMENT AND IDENTIFIED OTHER POTENTIAL PARTNERS OR RESOURCES THAT COULD SUPPORT CHIP WORK GROUP ACTIVITIES. AS A RESULT OF THE DIALOGUE, THE OCHC STEERING COMMITTEE REAFFIRMED THAT THE PLANNING TEAM AND WORK GROUPS SHOULD CONTINUE THEIR EFFORTS TO ADDRESS THE CHIP FOCUS AREAS AND GOALS OUTLINED IN THE 2013-2017 CHIP. THE PLANNING TEAM ALSO ESTABLISHED MECHANISMS TO COLLECT COMMUNITY PERSPECTIVE ON THE CHIP FOCUS AREAS.

The survey also appeared in the spring/summer 2016 issue of our community health magazine Thrive (circulation 250,000 Brooklyn residents); readers were encouraged to fill it out and mail it back or respond online. Hard copies of the survey were distributed at health fairs and community lectures. Respondents included people of all ages, races and education levels. Over 50 percent of respondents represented minority groups and those who are medically underserved.

201713199349317036,111631796,PART V LINE 11,"Our Community Health Needs Assessment revealed that some of Brooklynites major health needs are in the areas of diabetes, obesity and preventing falls/injuries. Therefore, NYP/BMH aimed to increase already existing programming in these areas by partnering with local coalitions, churches, schools and community based organizations, as well as by creating a new programming. As part of our State-mandated Community Service Plan, we chose to focus on Preventing Chronic Disease; Focus on Diabetes, Preventing Chronic Disease; Focus on Childhood Obesity, and Promoting a Healthy and Safe Environment; Reducing Fall Risk among Most Vulnerable Populations. We regularly address community concerns regarding chronic diseases by providing free screenings and health lectures both on and off of the Hospital's main campus. We are addressing diabetes prevention and treatment in a number of ways. We offer a free monthly diabetes support group that is open to the community. In addition, in conjunction with IPRO, NYP/BMH now hosts six-session diabetes management education seminars, available in English and Spanish, offered several times a year. Clinically, NYP/BMH also offers a Comprehensive Weight Management program. With regard to childhood obesity, we are working to identify partners who will provide instruction and space for us to run weekly exercise and dance programs for children and their parents in underserved communities. An earlier program, Dance Your Heart Healthy, enjoyed success, but was terminated when we lost the spaces that had been available. We are hopeful that this program will be reinstated in 2017 or early in 2018. NYP/BMH also runs a free weekly breastfeeding support group which encourages and teaches new mothers to provide wholesome nutrition to their infants in the form of breast milk and this group is being expanded beyond NYP/BMH's community to reach women in medically underserved areas. Several major studies have indicated that, along with other benefits of breastfeeding, babies who are breastfed face a lower risk of childhood obesity. As a result of the findings in the Community Health Needs Assessment, NYP/BMH has also developed a Fall Prevention Program, which seeks to give older adults the confidence and tools they need to help them age safely. The program includes seminars on home safety, healthy living, and avoiding falls, given by experts in trauma and injury prevention, environmental gerontology, and public health. These seminars are offered at NYP/BMH, as well as at various sites throughout Brooklyn. In addition, two staff members have been trained in Stepping On and two have been trained in Matter of Balance. These are both evidence-based programs that promote balance and behavioral change among seniors who have an increased fear of or risk of falling. Attendees at the fall prevention seminars are given the opportunity to attend Stepping On or Matter of Balance classes, at no cost. NYP/BMH also provides all participants in any fall prevention activities with a fall prevention kit, equipped with a variety of effective items (eg., nightlight, glow tape, non-skid socks, etc.) to help seniors safeguard themselves within their homes. In addition to the specific need areas identified in the CHNA, we continue to provide a general community outreach program which hosts roughly 400 annual events, featuring health lectures and support groups targeting various health concerns, including cancer, Hepatitis C, stroke, and pulmonary hypertension.

The CHNA/CHIP team was comprised of representatives from Tompkins County, Cayuga Medical Center and several community-based non-profit organizations. Much of the information driving the selection/confirmation of our priorities was gathered through conversations with service providers, and through panels and presentations by peers and providers. Key data indicators were reviewed to guide selection decisions for our priority focus areas. For example, data on hospitalizations related to mental health and substance abuse showed steep increases over the last 2-10 years, indicating that mental health and substance abuse continues to be a priority for Tompkins County. Finally, review of chronic disease indicators revealed that Tompkins County is in the second quartile statewide, indicating the need to continue our efforts to focus on underserved populations, particularly in the rural parts of the county."

201821349349300717,460224604,Avera Queen of Peace Hospital,"Part V, Section B, Line 11: A. Behavioral Health ServicesBehavioral health has been identified an area of need that Avera Queen of Peace is addressing. Access to services, early intervention, and education are critical to achieving improved long-term outcomes for individuals and communities. The hospital has developed the following goals to address this need.1. Improve mental health and prevent crisis situations within our communities. 2. Improve recovery rates and reduce public health crisis related to alcohol and substance use disorders.3. Improve behavioral health and substance use disorders screening, wellness, and awareness through education and self-management programs. Progress toward these goals has included: * Suicide prevention/screening education for area Primary Care providers, their staff, and Emergency Management Services staff (23 attendees). Training provided by Helpline Center (South Dakota). * Avera Queen of Peace provided leadership expertise for the Mitchell Chamber Community Health and Wellness Fair. Wellness fair co-chairs were hospital employees-director of education and community health coordinator. The wellness fair was open to the public free of charge, and 400 persons attended. Vendors and programs that address behavioral health awareness and substance use disorders were invited and participated in the fair. * AQOP staff collaborated with local experts to provide suicide prevention screenings (2 screenings), and panel discussion, ""Meth Changes Everything"" (20 attendees) during Mitchell Chamber Community Health and Wellness Fair. * Avera Queen of Peace Community Health Coordinator became certified lay leader for Better Choices, Better Health programming. B. Access to CareAccess to primary and mental healthcare services was identified as a priority of the community. Our goal is to improve access to primary care and mental health care services. Although great efforts have been made, much of the area is still designated a Primary Care Healthcare Professional Shortage Area and most of the area remains designated as a Medically Underserved Area/Population. Increasing access to primary care, specialties, and care coordination teams contributes to improved health outcomes. Access to services, early intervention, education, and support are critical to achieve improved long-term outcome for individuals and communities. Avera Queen of Peace continues to actively recruit family practice and internal medicine physicians. Fiscal year 2017 physician recruitments included an internal medicine physician, pediatrician, and dermatologist. C. Prevention, Wellness, Screening and EducationOngoing education related to how physical and mental health issues impact overall health of an individual and learning to manage chronic disease conditions was identified to be a priority of the community. As the focus on community and population health increases, it becomes more critical to invest resources and create partnerships related to prevention, wellness, screenings and education. The hospital's education programs, participation in health fairs, and support group programs are intended to address community education and support. Personalized chronic disease management education and support are also essential to improve the overall health of individuals and communities. Partnerships and collaborations with health agencies, providers, and community organizations are essential to increase breadth and depth of prevention, wellness, screening, and education knowledge. The hospital has developed the following goals to address this need.1. Build a culture of health through collaborative prevention, wellness, screening and education. 2. Engage and empower individuals to actively manage their chronic disease through education and support. Progress toward these goals has included: * Implementation of A1C Champions Program (education and awareness event attended by 18 individuals.) * Many pre-diabetic patients have the ability to prevent diabetes but may need pre-diabetic education. In fiscal year 2017 the Foundation began offering financial assistance for pre-diabetic patients to attend preventative education sessions when the patient is uninsured or the session is not a covered benefit. * Diabetic supply assistance to patients who cannot afford supplies (8 patients). * Avera Queen of Peace provided $3000 for diabetic test strips for patients of Rural Electronic Gestational Diabetes Program (eGDM). * Several educational events provided free of charge to community members (service clubs, senior citizens, and others). Some of the topics covered: Girls' adolescent health, Boys' adolescent health, how to communicate with one's physician, spiritual/emotional health, colorectal cancer, caregiver support and self-care, heat exposure/stroke, healthy vision, anxiety and stress management, healthy holiday eating, fall prevention. * Free blood pressure clinics and education.

We regularly submit educational articles to the local newspaper. We create awareness of our services through social media, health fair, newspaper articles, and our fun run/walk event on the 4th of July. CHNA Needs Not Addressed:Though Avera Weskota Memorial Hospital is a leader in identifying the needs of the community, some needs fall outside the span of control of the hospital. Unmet needs identified by the 2016 Community Health Needs Assessment will be addressed by recommended community organizations. These unmet needs include: * Assisted Living: Assisted living was identified as a need in the community for the 2013 and 2016 CHNA. In 2013, this issue was referred to Weskota Manor Avera. Developing assisted living is in the nursing home's long range strategic plan, but it is not financially feasible at this time. The health care community, hospital advisory board, and nursing home governing board will be educated regarding this plan. Avera Weskota Memorial Hospital will refer the identified need to Weskota Manor Avera for consideration in their long range strategic planning.In-home services are available to assist tenants in the independent living apartments. Services include: skilled home health and hospice services, hot meal programs, bus transit services and homemaker programs. * Recruitment of Healthcare Workers: Recruitment of healthcare staff was also identified as a concern. Low unemployment rate as well as a shortage of healthcare and home maker program applicants is a problem across the state. The facility will continue to apply creative ideas to recruitment and will not pursue this as a community health needs priority. Avera Weskota Memorial Hospital and the other healthcare facilities will continue to work with this issue. The hospital is using the South Dakota Retention Bonus as an incentive to recruit and retain professional staff, in addition to loan forgiveness and bonuses. This incentive has helped recruit and retain some, but not all, staff. Avera Weskota is participating in a Margaret A. Cargill Foundation Grant with Dakota Wesleyan University to educate and prepare Certified Nursing Assistants (CNA) and nurses in rural communities. In addition, the hospital will participate with University of South Dakota and United States Department of Agriculture (USDA) project, a project whereby student education is delivered via telemedicine to rural students at the facility."

Participants were invited by the Glendale Hospital Collaborative, leveraging its extensive networks and relationships within the greater Glendale area and the Glendale Healthier Community Coalition. These stakeholders represented a broad range of geographic, public health, and population interest in compliance with the ACA. The goal of this component of the CHNA was to identify broad health outcomes and drivers (which, combined are health needs), as well as assets and gaps in resources, through the perceptions and knowledge of varied and multiple stakeholders. The CHNA included the collection of over 300 data indicators that helped illustrate the health states of the community. Secondary data were collected from a wide range of local, county, state, and national sources to present demographics, mortality, morbidity, health behaviors, clinical care, social and economic factors, and physical environment. These categories are based on the Mobilizing Action Toward Community Health (MATCH) framework, which illustrates the interrelationships among the elements of health and their relationship to each other: social and economic factors, health behaviors, clinical care, physical, environmental, and health outcomes.

This Implementation Strategy focuses on the priority health needs that will be addressed by USC Verdugo Hills Hospital through its community benefit programs and activities. They are: - Access to care - Cancer - Diabetes - Mental health - Overweight/obesity The Implementation Strategy adopted by USC Verdugo Hills Hospital actively addresses health needs that were identified in the CHNA as priority health needs. USC Verdugo Hills Hospital plans to meet the identified priority health needs through a commitment of resources with specific programs and services. For each health need the hospital plans to address, the Implementation Strategy describes: actions the hospital intends to take, including programs and resources it plans to commit, planned collaboration between the hospital and community organizations, and anticipated impacts of these actions. In addition to the specific strategies for the selected priority health needs, USC Verdugo Hills Hospital will investigate the development of a community grants program to provide financial and in-kind support to community organizations addressing these needs. Other health needs were identified but are not specifically addressed in the Implementation Strategy. These include: cardiovascular disease, geriatric support,communicable/infectious diseases, dental care, homelessness/housing, poverty, preventive wellness, STDs, substance abuse, transportation, and violence/injury. While these issues are addressed on a day-to-day basis in the normal course of operations, the hospital has chosen not to focus this Implementation Plan on these other needs as it believes that it can have a greater impact on the priority health needs that were selected. These other health needs are less aligned with the Hospitals strategic initiatives. Additionally, while some of these needs are not being directly addressed, it should also be noted that health needs can influence one another. For example, reducing weight and improving nutrition and physical activity have been shown to positively influence cardiovascular disease.

UTILIZING THE DATA FROM THE CLARITAS REPORT AND THE TRENTON HEALTH TEAM (THT) UPDATE OF JANUARY 2016, OF WHICH SFMC TRENTON IS A LEADING MEMBER, THE HOSPITAL LOOKED SPECIFICALLY AT THE SIX ZIP CODES THAT LIE WITHIN THE CITY BOUNDARIES (08608, 08609, 08611, 08618, 08629, AND 08638). THT'S COLLABORATIVE APPROACH HAS ALLOWED FOR A MORE COMPLETE PICTURE OF THE CITY'S HEALTH NEEDS UTILIZING BOTH QUANTITATIVE AND QUALITATIVE DATA TO DEFINE THE EMERGING PRIORITIES OF TRENTON. IN ADDITION TO THIS UPDATE, VARIOUS RESOURCES WERE INCLUDED WITH MANY ROBUST PUBLISHED REPORTS AVAILABLE FOR REVIEW. COMMUNITY ADVISORY BOARD (CAB) MEMBERS AND THE PREVIOUSLY WRITTEN COMMUNITY HEALTH NEEDS ASSESSMENT (CHNA) REPORTS WERE ADDITIONAL TOOLS UTILIZED TO ASSESS NEW, OLD AND ONGOING PRIORITIES. AT THE END OF 2015, AN UPDATE TO THE CHNA WAS NEEDED AND THT AGAIN FACILITATED THE PROCESS. SURVEY FINDINGS FROM A COUNTY-WIDE HEALTH ASSESSMENT, CONDUCTED BY HEALTH RESOURCES IN ACTION (HRIA), ON BEHALF OF THE GREATER MERCER PUBLIC HEALTH PARTNERSHIP (WWW.HEALTHYMERCER.ORG), WERE REVIEWED AND COMPARED TO RESPONSES FROM INDIVIDUALS RESIDING IN THE TRENTON ZIP CODES. THERE WERE 1,927 RESPONSES TO THE COUNTY SURVEY; OF THOSE, 369 RESPONSES CORRESPONDED TO TRENTON ZIP CODES. FINDINGS FROM THIS SURVEY WERE SUPPLEMENTED WITH DIRECT INPUT FROM TRENTON RESIDENTS PROVIDED THROUGH THE COMMUNITY FORUMS, HELD BETWEEN NOVEMBER 30 AND DECEMBER 11, 2015. FINDINGS FROM THIS PROCESS AFFIRMED THAT THE PRIORITY AREAS IDENTIFIED IN THE 2013 CHNA ARE STILL MAJOR CONCERNS FOR THE COMMUNITY.

BASED ON AREA OF EXPERTISE AND RESOURCES, EACH CHNA HEALTH PRIORITY WAS ASSIGNED TO A COMMUNITY LEADER WHOSE ORGANIZATION WOULD LEAD THAT PRIORITY'S IMPROVEMENT INITIATIVE, GUIDED BY THE CHIP STEERING TEAM. METRICS FOR EACH OF THE CHIP PRIORITIES HAVE BEEN DEVELOPED AND CAN BE FOUND IN THE UNIFIED CHIP PLAN, WHICH IS AVAILABLE ON THE TRENTON HEALTH TEAM AND SFMC TRENTON WEBSITES. SFMC TRENTON HAS IMPLEMENTED PROGRAMS AND STRATEGIES RELATED TO THE ESTABLISHED GOALS AND OBJECTIVES OF THE CHIP PLAN. IT HAS AN ACTIVE ROLE IN THREE OUT OF THE FIVE CHNA PRIORITY AREAS WHICH INCLUDE THE FOLLOWING: CHRONIC DISEASE AND OBESITY, SUBSTANCE ABUSE AND BEHAVIORAL HEALTH, AND HEALTH LITERACY AND DISPARITIES. CHRONIC DISEASE AND OBESITY - THE HOSPITAL DEVELOPED AND IMPLEMENTED A DIABETIC DISEASE MANAGEMENT EDUCATIONAL PROGRAM (DSRIP), OFFERED A NUMBER OF DISEASE MANAGEMENT EDUCATIONAL PROGRAMS TARGETING INDIVIDUALS WITH DIABETES, HEART DISEASE AND CANCER, AND DEVELOPED/PILOTED A FAITH-BASED WEIGHT-LOSS PROGRAM. HEALTH LITERACY AND DISPARITIES - SFMC TRENTON CONTINUED ITS SUPPORT OF THE HEALTH TEACHER/GONOODLE PROGRAM IN THE TRENTON SCHOOL DISTRICT. IN THE 2016 - 2017 SCHOOL YEAR (AUG 1 - NOV 30), THIS PROGRAM WAS UTILIZED BY 18 SPONSORED ELEMENTARY SCHOOLS, INCLUDING 277 ELIGIBLE TEACHERS AND 6,088 ELIGIBLE STUDENTS, DEMONSTRATING SFMC TRENTON HAS CONTINUED TO WORK WITH OUR PARTNER, NOVO NORDISK, THROUGHOUT THE YEAR 2017 AND IS CURRENTLY PLANNING A PRESS CONFERENCE TO ANNOUNCE THE SUCCESS OF THIS PROGRAM IN THE TRENTON SCHOOL DISTRICT.CHRONIC DISEASE: PREVENTING ACCESS TO ALL TOBACCO PRODUCTS BEFORE THE AGE OF 21 - STATISTICS HAVE SHOWN THAT SMOKING IS THE LEADING CAUSE OF PREVENTABLE DEATH. IN ADDITION, 95% OF ADULT SMOKERS BEGIN BEFORE THE AGE OF 21. SFMC TRENTON, WORKING IN CONJUNCTION WITH THT, HAS DEVELOPED AN ACTION PLAN TO ENACT REGULATIONS TO CONTROL TOBACCO USE IN THE TRENTON COMMUNITY. THROUGH MEETINGS WITH THE MAYOR AND THE CITY OF TRENTON DEPARTMENT OF HEALTH AND SENIOR SERVICES, OUR PARTNERSHIP WILL ASSIST THE CITY IN THE DEVELOPMENT OF A TOBACCO 21 POLICY TO RAISE THE MINIMUM AGE FOR PURCHASE AND SALE OF TOBACCO PRODUCTS AND ELECTRONIC SMOKING DEVICES FROM 19 TO 21 YEARS OF AGE. THE LEGISLATION IS ENDORSED BY SFMC TRENTON AND THT AS WELL AS A COALITION OF OTHER ORGANIZATIONS, INCLUDING THE HUNTERDON MERCER REGIONAL TOBACCO COLLABORATIVE, THE NEW JERSEY QUITLINE, MOMS QUIT CONNECTION, TOBACCO-FREE FOR A HEALTHY NEW JERSEY, OUR CONCERNED PASTORS ORGANIZATION AND OUR HOSPITAL EMPLOYEES. SFMC TRENTON HAS WORKED EXTENSIVELY WITH THE TRINITY HEALTH SYSTEM, OUR PARENT ORGANIZATION, TO PROVIDE THE EXTENSIVE MEDIA AND EDUCATIONAL INFORMATION NECESSARY TO INFORM OUR CITY COUNCIL AND OUR COMMUNITY OF THE IMPORTANCE OF THIS BILL.THIS ACTIVE COALITION WAS ABLE TO BUILD COMMUNITY SUPPORT THROUGH THIS MEDIA CAMPAIGN AND EDUCATIONAL EFFORTS REGARDING THE HAZARDS OF TOBACCO USE, ESPECIALLY ITS IMPACT ON YOUNG PEOPLE. IN JANUARY OF 2017, THE CITY OF TRENTON PASSED THIS LEGISLATION, BECOMING THE 22ND CITY IN THE STATE OF NEW JERSEY TO ENACT TOBACCO 21. AS OF JUNE 30, 2017, THE COALITION IS WORKING WITH GOVERNOR CHRIS CHRISTIE AND THE ENTIRE STATE OF NEW JERSEY TO PASS THIS LEGISLATION STATE-WIDE. THIS WOULD MAKE NEW JERSEY THE THIRD STATE, AFTER CALIFORNIA AND HAWAII, TO ENACT THIS LEGISLATION.SFMC IS CURRENTLY WORKING WITH THE TRENTON HEALTH TEAM, THE CITY DEPARTMENT OF HEALTH AND THE NEW JERSEY PREVENTION NETWORK TO EDUCATE THE MERCHANTS AND PROVIDE SIGNAGE FOR THE 11/1/2017 ENACTMENT OF THIS LAW.OBESITY AND HEALTHY LIFESTYLES - OBESITY RATES IN TRENTON WERE REPORTED IN THE CHNA TO BE WELL ABOVE NATIONAL OR STATE LEVELS, WITH ADULTS AT 39% OBESE AND 49% OF 3-5 YEAR-OLD CHILDREN OVERWEIGHT OR OBESE (COMPARED TO 21% NATIONALLY). -ACCESS TO HEALTHY FOODS CONTINUES TO BE A CONCERN FOR TRENTON RESIDENTS AND PLAYS A SIGNIFICANT ROLE IN THESE STATISTICS. IN ORDER TO MEET THAT NEED, SFMC TRENTON PARTNERED WITH THE THT AND OTHER COMMUNITY VENDORS TO FORM THE GREENWOOD AVE. FARMERS MARKET TO GIVE OUR COMMUNITY ACCESS TO FRESH, LOCAL PRODUCE ON A WEEKLY BASIS FROM JUNE TO OCTOBER. SFMC TRENTON WORKED WITH THE CITY DEPARTMENT OF HEALTH AND HUMAN SERVICES AND THE LOCAL FEDERALLY QUALIFIED HEALTH CENTER (FQHC) TO PROVIDE BLOOD GLUCOSE, BLOOD PRESSURE AND VISION SCREENINGS, SERVING MORE THAN 500 INDIVIDUALS.THE MARKET ACCEPTED ALL STATE AND FEDERAL ASSISTANCE PROGRAMS INCLUDING SNAP, WIC, FMNP AND SENIOR VOUCHERS. TO ENCOURAGE BENEFIT USE AND ADDRESS THE ECONOMIC NEED IN THE COMMUNITY, THE MARKET INTRODUCED A DOLLAR-FOR-DOLLAR MATCHING PROGRAM FOR CUSTOMERS USING THEIR BENEFITS. THE MATCHING INITIATIVE WAS OVERWHELMINGLY SUCCESSFUL, EVIDENCED BY ITS 100% REDEMPTION RATE. THE GAFM SERVED NEARLY 4,000 CUSTOMERS, PROVIDING A LOW-INCOME, HIGH-CRIME, FOOD-INSECURE COMMUNITY WITH AN INCREASED OPPORTUNITY FOR HEALTHY LIVING IN A SAFE AND FUN ENVIRONMENT.IN 2017, THE GAFM INITIATED A PROGRAM WHICH PROVIDED MEALS FOR PARENTS AND CHILDREN ATTENDING THE MARKET. THIS INITIATIVE PROVIDED MORE THAN 200 COMMUNITY MEMBERS WITH HEALTHY, LOW-COST MEALS.CHRONIC DISEASE: DIABETES - RATES OF DIABETES IN THE CITY OF TRENTON ARE EXCEEDINGLY HIGH: 16% OF TRENTON RESIDENTS ARE DIABETIC COMPARED WITH JUST OVER 9% OF MERCER COUNTY RESIDENTS, 8% OF NEW JERSEY RESIDENTS, AND APPROXIMATELY 6% NATIONALLY. OVER 72% OF THE TRENTON COMMUNITY RANKED THE NEED FOR PROGRAM DEVELOPMENT TO ASSIST WITH MANAGING THEIR CHRONIC DISEASE AS A HIGH PRIORITY.THE DELIVERY SYSTEM REFORM INCENTIVE PAYMENT (DSRIP) PROGRAM IS ONE COMPONENT OF THE NEW JERSEY'S COMPREHENSIVE MEDICAID WAIVER AS APPROVED BY THE CENTERS FOR MEDICARE AND MEDICAID SERVICES (CMS). DSRIP IS A DEMONSTRATION PROGRAM DESIGNED TO RESULT IN BETTER CARE FOR INDIVIDUALS (INCLUDING ACCESS TO CARE, QUALITY OF CARE, AND HEALTH OUTCOMES), BETTER HEALTH FOR THE POPULATION, AND LOWER COSTS BY TRANSITIONING HOSPITAL FUNDING TO A MODEL WHERE PAYMENT IS CONTINGENT ON ACHIEVING HEALTH IMPROVEMENT GOALS. THE DSRIP PROGRAM SUPPORTS THE HEALTHY NEW JERSEY 2020 VISION: ""FOR NEW JERSEY TO BE A STATE IN WHICH ALL PEOPLE LIVE LONG, HEALTHY LIVES."" IN 2017, THE SFMC DSRIP PROGRAM SCREENED 3,607 PATIENTS FROM REFERRAL SOURCES, PROVIDED DIABETES EDUCATION TO 501 IN-PATIENT CONSULTS, 48 IN-PATIENT ED CONSULTS AND 9 CLINIC CONSULTS.THE ASSUMPTION IS THAT OUR PROGRAM AVOIDS READMISSIONS WITHIN 30 DAYS. HOWEVER, THE PROBABILITY OF ADMISSION OVER A 90-DAY PERIOD IS HIGHER. THE PROGRAM PROVIDES A GREAT DEAL OF SUPPORT FOR COMPLEX PATIENTS INCLUDING EDUCATION REGARDING DISEASE PROCESS, NAVIGATION OF THE HEALTH CARE SERVICES TO INCLUDE ACCESS TO CARE, MEDICATION MANAGEMENT, PROPER NUTRITION AND COMPLIANCE OF MEDICAL CARE. IT IS DIFFICULT TO ASCERTAIN THE IMPACT OF OUR EDUCATIONAL INTERVENTIONS ON THE LONG-TERM HEALTH CARE COST OF THE POPULATION WE SERVE THROUGH OUR DSRIP PROJECT.SFMC TRENTON IS ALSO PARTNERING WITH THE THT TO TRANSFORM OUR LOCAL CORNER STORES INTO HEALTHY CORNER STORES BY OFFERING FRESH PRODUCE AND OTHER HEALTHY OPTIONS TO COMMUNITY MEMBERS. IN 2017, WORKING WITH THT, THE FOOD TRUST AND THE NJ PARTNERSHIP FOR HEALTHY KIDS, THE LUCKY STAR DELI, LOCATED IN THE CITY OF TRENTON, PARTICIPATED IN THE HEALTHY CORNER STORE NETWORK. ONCE A MONTH HEART SMARTS BROUGHT NUTRITION LESSONS TO THE DELI. CUSTOMERS LEARNED ABOUT SELECTING HEALTHY FOODS SUCH AS HEART HEALTHY WHOLE GRAINS AND TASTED RECIPES MADE FROM HEALTHY PRODUCTS AVAILABLE IN THE STORE. FOLLOWING A BLOOD PRESSURE SCREENING BY A SFMC TRENTON NURSE, EACH PARTICIPANT RECEIVED FOUR HEART BUCKS (EACH $1) TO REDEEM FOR ANY HEART HEALTHY ITEMS IN THE STORE AS WELL AS OTHER INCENTIVES AND INFORMATION TO ENCOURAGE HEALTHY EATING. AS NOTED IN THE CHNA, TRENTON'S HEALTH CHALLENGES ARE NUMEROUS. SOME OF THOSE CHALLENGES ARE BEYOND THE SCOPE OF THE 2016 CHNA, AN UPDATE TO THE 2013 REPORT, AND THEREFORE NOT A PRIMARY FOCUS. IT REMAINS IMPORTANT TO NOTE THAT WHILE THESE ARE NOT PRIMARY FOCUS AREAS, THE HOSPITAL STAYS COMMITTED TO ADDRESSING ALL OF THE NEEDS OF THE COMMUNITY WHEN POSSIBLE. COMMUNITY FORUM INPUT CONFIRMED THAT THE PRIORITIES IDENTIFIED IN 2013 CONTINUE TO BE CONCERNS FOR THE COMMUNITY. A NUMBER OF ADDITIONAL ISSUES WERE RAISED, WHICH SFMC TRENTON IS NOT ADDRESSING DUE TO FINANCIAL RESTRICTIONS AND THE ABILITY OF OTHER AGENCIES TO ADDRESS THE SAME ISSUES. THE HOSPITAL WILL CONTINUE TO ACKNOWLEDGE THE IMPACT OF THESE ISSUES WHILE IT FOCUSES ON THE EMERGING PRIORITIES IDENTIFIED BY QUANTITATIVE DATA AND COMMUNITY ENGAGEMENT EFFORTS.THESE ISSUES INCLUDE TEEN PREGNANCY AND POOR BIRTH OUTCOMES, SEXUALLY TRANSMITTED DISEASES, LEAD POISONING, CITY PLANNING, ACCESS TO MEDICATION, ISSUES RELATED TO DOCTOR'S VISITS, HOUSING (INCLUDING SAFETY ISSUES), FOOD INSECURITY, BED BUGS, AND JOB INSECURITY."

OTHER HEALTH CARE FACILITIES SERVING OUR COMMUNITY CONTINUED TO ADDRESS THE OTHER AREAS IDENTIFIED AS WELL.THE RESPIRATORY THERAPISTS PROVIDE QUARTERLY ASTHMA EDUCATION & MANAGEMENT CLASSES FOR INTERESTED COMMUNITY MEMBERS, STUDENTS AND STAFF. THE LUNG CENTER AT ALBANY MEMORIAL HOSPITAL CONTINUED TO PROVIDE PULMONARY MANAGEMENT, WHICH INCLUDED QUICK ASSESSMENT, TREATMENT AND PATIENT-CENTERED EDUCATION TO ALL ASTHMA AND COPD PATIENTS. BEFORE DISCHARGE, EACH PATIENT IS PROVIDED AN APPOINTMENT WITH A PRIMARY CARE DOCTOR'S OFFICE. DURING FY17, 78 PATIENTS WERE PROVIDED TREATMENT AND EDUCATION THROUGH THE LUNG CENTER AT ALBANY MEMORIAL HOSPITAL. PATIENTS ARE ALSO CONNECTED TO A CARE TRANSITION PROGRAM DEVELOPED BY THE EDDY VISITING NURSING GROUP, AN AFFILIATE OF ST. PETER'S HEALTH PARTNERS (SPHP), WHICH SCHEDULES HOME VISITS WITH AN EMPHASIS ON ASTHMA EDUCATION TO INCREASE ASTHMA MANAGEMENT, ALONG WITH MONITORING FOR THE COPD HOME CARE PATIENTS. ALL MEDICAL ASSOCIATE PHYSICIANS AFFILIATED WITH SPHP ARE BEING EDUCATED ON THE USE OF ASTHMA ACTION PLANS WITHIN THE HOSPITAL'S CLINICS AND THEIR PRACTICES. FURTHERMORE, PATIENTS IDENTIFYING AS SMOKERS ARE GIVEN INFORMATION AND REFERRALS TO THE NYS SMOKERS QUIT LINE, ""OPT TO QUIT"" PROGRAM, A SYSTEM-WIDE SOLUTION FOR ENSURING THAT CESSATION SUPPORT IS OFFERED AND ACCESSIBLE TO ALL INPATIENTS SO THAT ONCE THEY LEAVE THE HEALTH CARE SETTING, THEY WILL HAVE A NICOTINE REPLACEMENT THERAPY AT HOME TO UTILIZE IF THEY OPT TO QUIT. THE NUMBER OF REFERRALS RECEIVED FROM ALBANY MEMORIAL HOSPITAL TO THE NYS SMOKER'S QUITLINE WAS 157 FOR FY17. IN ADDITION, ALBANY MEMORIAL HOSPITAL HAS A LONG TRADITION OF PROVIDING INFORMATION AND REFERRALS TO THE BUTT STOPS HERE, A SEVEN-WEEK SMOKING CESSATION PROGRAM THAT IS TAUGHT ON SITE WHENEVER THERE ARE INTERESTED COMMUNITY MEMBERS AND/OR STAFF. IN PARTNERSHIP WITH ST. PETER'S HEALTH PARTNERS, THE ASTHMA EDUCATION PROJECT CONTINUED IN FY 17. THIS PROJECT UTILIZED COMMUNITY HEALTH WORKERS (CHW) TO PROVIDE SERVICES FOR LOW-INCOME AND UNDERSERVED INDIVIDUALS, WHICH INCLUDED CHILDREN REFERRED FROM OUR CLINICS AND EMERGENCY DEPARTMENTS WITH HIGH INCIDENTS OF UNCONTROLLED ASTHMA. THROUGHOUT FY 17, CHW CONDUCTED HOME VISITS, FAMILIARIZED FAMILIES WITH ASTHMA TERMINOLOGY, AND OFFERED TRAINING FOR MANAGEMENT OF THE DISEASE. ALSO, CHW ASSESSED PATIENT HOMES FOR ENVIRONMENTAL FACTORS, SUCH AS MOLD AND DUST, WHICH MAY TRIGGER ASTHMA SYMPTOMS, AND PROVIDED HOUSEHOLDS WITH ""GREEN"" CLEANING SUPPLIES AND VACUUMS WITH HEPA FILTERS. TO BETTER DIAGNOSE DIABETES, ALL AFFILIATED AND EMPLOYED PHYSICIANS WERE EDUCATED ABOUT THE NEED TO SCREEN AND REFER PATIENTS TO APPROPRIATE CARE. ON AN OUTPATIENT BASIS, DIABETES EDUCATORS FROM SPHP DIABETES AND ENDOCRINE CARE PROVIDED DPP (DIABETES PREVENTION PROGRAMS) AND OTHER APPROPRIATE DIABETES EDUCATION AS NEEDED. FINANCIAL ASSISTANCE IS AVAILABLE TO THOSE PATIENTS WITHOUT RESOURCES WHO SEEK DIABETES PREVENTION, EDUCATION AND MANAGEMENT CLASSES. ALSO IN FY17, MONTHLY SUPPORT GROUPS WERE OFFERED, FREE OF CHARGE, FOCUSING ON A VARIETY OF TOPICS RELATED TO DIABETES.IN ORDER TO ADDRESS CHILDHOOD OBESITY IN FY17, ALBANY MEMORIAL HOSPITAL PARTNERED WITH OTHER HOSPITALS WITHIN SPHP, THE U.S. SOCCER FOUNDATION, AND THE TROY BOYS AND GIRLS CLUB, TO SUPPORT THE CREATION OF THE SOCCER FOR SUCCESS PROGRAM FOR CHILDREN WITHIN THE CITIES OF TROY, ALBANY AND SCHENECTADY. SOCCER FOR SUCCESS IS AN AFTERSCHOOL PROGRAM THAT IS PROVEN TO HELP CHILDREN ESTABLISH HEALTHY HABITS AND DEVELOP CRITICAL LIFE SKILLS, THROUGH CARING COACH MENTORS AND FAMILY ENGAGEMENT. THE PROGRAM IS OFFERED FREE OF CHARGE TO CHILDREN. PARTICIPANTS LEARN SOCCER SKILLS AND ABOUT EATING RIGHT AND OTHER WAYS TO STAY HEALTHY, WHILE GAINING IMPORTANT DECISION MAKING AND RELATIONSHIP SKILLS FROM THEIR INTERACTIONS WITH COACH-MENTORS AND PEERS. DURING THE FIRST SESSION (SPRING 2017), 609 CHILDREN PARTICIPATED IN SOCCER FOR SUCCESS AT THE BOYS AND GIRLS CLUB. OUT OF THESE PARTICIPANTS, 91% MAINTAINED OR DECREASED THEIR PERSON BMI, AND 74% INCREASED THEIR AEROBIC CAPACITY AND SCORED AT LEAST TWO LEVELS HIGHER ON THE PACER TEST. DURING FY17, SUBSTANCE ABUSE NEEDS WERE ADDRESSED. ACTION PLANS WERE DEVELOPED TO INCREASE EDUCATION AND PRACTICE STRATEGIES TO REDUCE OPIOID OVERDOSE AND NON-MEDICAL USE OF OPIATES. PROVIDER EDUCATION WAS OFFERED TO ALL PRESCRIBERS OF ALBANY MEMORIAL HOSPITAL, AS WELL AS SPHP, REGARDING ADDICTION AND PAIN MANAGEMENT (INCLUDING GUIDELINES, COMMUNITY RESOURCES AND INFORMATION TO PROVIDE TO PATIENTS REGARDING RISK AND HARM/MISUSE) USING THE FEDERAL GUIDELINES. HOSPITAL STAFF PROMOTED SAFE STORAGE AND PROPER DISPOSAL OF UNUSED PRESCRIPTION MEDICATIONS. IN THE AREA OF MENTAL HEALTH, STRENGTHENING MENTAL HEALTH INFRASTRUCTURE ACROSS HEALTH SYSTEMS WAS IDENTIFIED AS A PRIORITY. DURING FY17, LEADERSHIP STAFF FROM ALBANY MEMORIAL HOSPITAL WERE MEMBERS OF WORKGROUPS TO DEVELOP THIS CONCEPT, SPECIFICALLY WITH THE HCDI BEHAVIORAL HEALTH/SUBSTANCE ABUSE TASKFORCE.WHILE THE ORGANIZATION WILL CONTINUE TO OFFER SERVICES ADDRESSING OTHER PRESSING HEALTH NEEDS, IT FELT THAT THE INCREASED FOCUS ON THE SELECTED AREAS REPRESENTS THE BEST USE OF RESOURCES AND EXPERTISE.ALBANY MEMORIAL HOSPITAL ACKNOWLEDGES THE WIDE RANGE OF PRIORITY HEALTH ISSUES THAT EMERGED FROM THE CHNA PROCESS, AND DETERMINED IT COULD EFFECTIVELY FOCUS ON ONLY THOSE HEALTH NEEDS WHICH IT DEEMED MOST PRESSING, UNDER-ADDRESSED, AND WITHIN ITS ABILITY TO INFLUENCE. THUS, ADVERSE BIRTH OUTCOMES, STD'S AND LYME DISEASE WILL NOT DIRECTLY BE ADDRESSED BY ALBANY MEMORIAL HOSPITAL. AS MENTIONED ABOVE, OTHER HEALTH CARE FACILITIES SERVING OUR COMMUNITY WILL CONTINUE TO ADDRESS THE OTHER AREAS AS WELL. THE FOCUS AREAS WERE CHOSEN ACCORDING TO THE RESULTS OF THE COMMUNITY HEALTH NEEDS ASSESSMENT - WE LOOKED AT DISEASE PREVALENCE RATES, WHICH CONDITIONS AFFECTED DISPARATE POPULATIONS MOST, AND THE AVAILABILITY OF EVIDENCE-BASED INTERVENTIONS TO ADDRESS THE PROBLEM, AS DIRECTED BY THE NY STATE PREVENTION AGENDA."

CLASSES PROVIDED BY THESE INDIVIDUALS INCLUDE SPECIFIC SUBJECT MATTER SUCH AS: GESTATIONAL DIABETES, PREDIABETES, MEDICAL NUTRITION THERAPY AND DIABETES SELF-MANAGEMENT TRAINING. PARTICIPATION IN OPPORTUNITIES TO EDUCATE PATIENTS AND THE COMMUNITY ON INFANT MORTALITY AND SAFE SLEEP PRACTICES WILL LEAD TO SAFE SLEEP COMPLIANCE FOR FAMILIES WITH NEW BABIES. CURRENTLY, 95% OF PARENTS WITHIN THE CHRIST HOSPITAL ARE PRACTICING SAFE SLEEP TECHNIQUES. THE GOAL IS TO REACH 99% COMPLIANCE BY FISCAL YEAR 2018. THE CHRIST HOSPITAL WILL UTILIZE A COORDINATED TEAM OF EDUCATORS, NURSES, NURSE PRACTITIONERS AND MEDICAL DIRECTORS TO IMPROVE EDUCATION REGARDING INFANT MORTALITY AND DISSEMINATE THAT INFORMATION IN A TIMELY MANNER. THIS TEAM WILL ALSO COLLABORATIVELY WORK WITH CRADLE CINCINNATI, THE MARCH OF DIMES, THE NATIONAL INSTITUTE FOR HEALTH AND THE CINCINNATI HEALTH DEPARTMENT AS WELL AS CRIBS FOR KIDS TO ASSIST FAMILIES IN NEED AND EDUCATE THE PUBLIC AND HEALTHCARE PROVIDERS ALIKE. THIS WILL OCCUR IN THE HOSPITAL SETTING AS WELL AS IN CHILDBIRTH EDUCATION CLASSES AND IN VARIOUS COMMUNITY OUTREACH SETTINGS. THE PARTNERSHIPS WITH THESE ORGANIZATIONS ASSIST US IN ACQUIRING EDUCATIONAL MATERIALS FOR STAFF AS WELL AS FOR THE PUBLIC, AND ASSIST US IN ACQUIRING SUPPLIES AS WELL. THE CHRIST HOSPITAL WILL INCREASE THE NUMBER OF LOW-DOSE CT LUNG CANCER SCREENINGS IN OUR PRIMARY CARE OFFICES AND MONITOR THE PERCENT OF PATIENT SCREENED. CURRENTLY THE NUMBER OF LOW-DOSE CT LUNG CANCER SCREENINGS IS 27 PER YEAR, WITH THE GOAL OF IMPROVING THAT TO 52 PER YEAR. THERE WILL ALSO BE UTILIZATION OF THE LUNG NODULE PROGRAM TO MONITOR PATIENTS AT HIGH RISK FOR LUNG CANCER, AND TO FOLLOW HIGH RISK PATIENTS REGULARLY TO FACILITATE EARLY DETECTION FOR THOSE WHO DEVELOP LUNG CANCER. THE CHRIST HOSPITAL WILL IMPLEMENT THESE STRATEGIES WITH THE COLLABORATION OF ORGANIZATIONS SUCH AS: AMERICAN LUNG ASSOCIATION, LUNG CANCER ALLIANCE, AMERICAN LUNG ASSOCIATION, CANCER FAMILY CARE, CANCER SUPPORT COMMUNITY, AMERICAN CANCER SOCIETY, NATIONAL CANCER INSTITUTE, NATIONAL COALITION FOR CANCER SURVIVORSHIP AND NATIONAL COMPREHENSIVE CANCER NETWORK. THE CHRIST HOSPITAL WILL WORK TO CREATE A COMPREHENSIVE OUTPATIENT PROGRAM THAT ADDRESSES THE NEEDS OF PATIENTS WITH MENTAL HEALTH CONDITIONS. THIS PROGRAM WILL INCLUDE EDUCATIONAL SERVICES, FACILITATION OF SUPPORT GROUPS AND MORE SPECIFIC SERVICES TO ADDRESS MENTAL HEALTH CONCERNS. THIS PROGRAM WILL ALLOW THE CHRIST HOSPITAL TO TREAT THE MENTAL HEALTH POPULATION WITH CARE APPROPRIATE FOR THEIR CONDITIONS. THIS TARGETED CARE WILL ALSO CONTRIBUTE TO THE OVERALL UNDERSTANDING OF MENTAL HEALTH NEEDS, HELPING TO DEBUNK MYTHS AND MISUNDERSTANDINGS. A TEAM OF COORDINATED PRACTITIONERS, INCLUDING CLINICAL THERAPISTS, NURSE PRACTITIONERS, PSYCHIATRISTS AND MEDICAL DIRECTORS WILL WORK TO IMPROVE ACCESS TO MENTAL HEALTH SERVICES FOR PATIENTS AND MAKE CARE RECEIVED MORE COMPREHENSIVE. OUR ONGOING WORK HAS YIELDED FAVORABLE RESULTS. ACROSS ALL SECTORS PROGRESS IS BEING MADE TO MEET OUR GOALS. SPECIFICALLY, THE DIABETES CENTER PATIENTS BMI AVERAGE AND A1C SCORES HAVE DECREASED FROM FY15. THERE WAS 100% PARTICIPATION IN SAFE SLEEP PRACTICES AND TECHNIQUES IN THE LAST 3 QUARTERS OF FY 2017. THIS IS AN 18% INCREASE OVER FY 2015 QUARTER 4 REPORT AND HAS EXCEED GOAL BY 3%. ADDITIONALLY, THERE HAS BEEN AN INCREASE IN THE NUMBER OF LOW DOSE CT SCREENINGS PROVIDED BY OUR PRIMARY CARE OFFICES. LASTLY, A COMPREHENSIVE OUTPATIENT PROGRAM HAS BEEN CREATED AND THE GOAL HAS BEEN MET.

Personal Development focus on lifestyle skills: communicating, problem solving, decision making, responsibility, self-esteem, etc. As part of the identification and prioritization of health needs, the CHNA core group identified 22 health focus areas from extant data sources. The core group used a set of defined criteria to narrow the health focus area to 12. Following this process, the core group presented the 12 focus areas to the advisory council. Data was presented for each focus area and the advisory council was led through a forced ranking process to further narrow the list to nine focus areas for consideration as part of the FY16-FY18 CHNA. The core group commissioned University of Illinois in Springfield Office of Survey Research to develop an on-line survey available for community members to provide feedback around the nine priority areas. Participants were asked to rank the top three focus areas by order of importance. They were also invited to list any additional health focus areas they thought should be considered. Five community forums were presented in concurrence with the online survey. Forums were held in five locations around Sangamon County. The locations were selected to reach persons from varied socioeconomic, educational and ethnic backgrounds. During the forums, community residents were invited to provide input on community data, help identify community assets and gaps and assist in identifying priority health and quality of life issues. HSHS St. John's Hospital's internal advisory council met to review community forum and survey feedback in addition to data around the nine health focus areas. The internal advisory council was then asked to force rank the issues to identify the top four FY16-FY18 CHNA Health Focus Areas. As an outcome of the prioritization process five of the nine health focus areas ranked by the community and internal advisory council were not identified as ranking high against the defined criteria and were not advanced for consideration for the implementation strategy. In some cases, the focus area is currently being addressed by another organization in the community or there is another organization within the community better equipped to address the need. While the list below will not be areas of primary focus for St. John's, the hospital will continue to participate in efforts with other organizations as appropriate and where the hospital can lend support. 1. Child abuse a. In 2014 the Illinois Department of Children and Family Services entered into a year-long contract with the Mental Health Centers of Central Illinois to revamp the state's child protection training. b. The goal of this partnership is to provide experiential training through simulated real-life situations to better train child welfare workers with the necessary skills to protect children. 2. Dental care a. Dental care was not identified through the existing data sets; however, it was an issue brought to our attention by our advisory council and during the community forums. b. During our assets and gaps process it was noted the Federally Qualified Health Centers are preparing to expand their dental services. Additionally, there are new services such as Familia Dental which provide affordable dental care. 3. Diabetes a. HSHS St. John's Hospital has representation on the Prairie Diabetes Alliance (PDA), which is run through the Central Illinois American Diabetes Association. Through our ongoing work with PDA and the implementation strategies designed to address Metabolic Syndrome, which surfaced as an identified health need in the hospital's FY12 CHNA, we will continue our diabetes prevention and management efforts. 4. Food insecurity a. HSHS St. John's Hospital continues to sponsor, organize and run the Eastside Farmers Market which began as a result of the FY12 CHNA. b. St. John's Hospital also works closely with other organizations in the community who are actively addressing food security issues: genHkids Coalition, Illinois Stewardship Alliance, Downtown Springfield, Inc., to name a few. 5. Heart disease a. Prairie Heart Institute at HSHS St. John's Hospital is committed to ongoing community education and outreach around heart disease. b.

At Rush, the process was led by the Center for Community Health Equity (www.healthequitychicago.org), coordinated by the Office of Community Engagement, and overseen by the Building Healthy Communities Steering Committee (which has transformed into the Community Health Equity leadership group in 2017). First, the Rush team reviewed its initial CHNA reports from the previous iteration, benchmarked it against others produced three years ago in the region and assessed whether the reports contained the right content to enable us to make an impact. We sought to include more stakeholders in our process of developing the CHNA. We began by gathering input from community members as well as from Rush faculty, students and staff (especially those who live in our service area). We sought perspective from our colleagues at health systems and public health entities in the area; community leaders and members; our colleagues in the Center for Community Health Equity based at Rush University and DePaul University; and those participating in the Alliance for Health Equity (formerly the Health Impact Collaborative of Cook County (HICCC) and the Healthy Chicago Hospital Collaborative, as the two collaboratives merged in 2017 - the lead for the CHNA was the former). The Alliance for Health Equity is a collaborative group convened by the Illinois Public Health Institute and consisted at the time of 26 hospitals, seven health departments and more than 100 community-based organizations working together on a joint CHNA process. As described, this group has since grown with the merging of HICCC and the Healthy Chicago Hospital Collaborative. As we developed our recommended actions for this iteration of the CHNA, we again sought input from our key stakeholders. To see a list of those who engaged in this process and Rush worked with at the time, please view our CHNA online and proceed to Appendix 2 on Page 73."

201801349349301940,362174823,Rush University Medical Center,"Part V, Section B, Line 11: Rush's Community Health Implementation Plan (CHIP) was adopted in November 2016, and we are proud to report that we believe we have made significant progress since its adoption. The following Community Health Needs/Improvements were identified in partnership with the Alliance for Health Equity (formerly Health Impact Collaborative of Cook County), and as a result we developed our internal CHIP as a roadmap on how to achieve improvements in these areas for our communities. Rush has taken a robust approach to alleviating the identified needs and called out specific goals (addressing the needs) and strategies to tackle these goals(improvements). In addition, there have been seven work-groups formed around the CHIP strategies consisting of Rush leaders, community partners, and community residents in order to collaboratively tackle these with a collective impact approach. Our newly adopted CHIP is as follows, as well highlights of some of our efforts:1.Goal: Reduce inequities caused by the social, economic and structural determinants of health During the year ending June 30, 2017, Rush has actively been engaged in the newly merged Alliance for Health Equity, and what a group that has recently been renamed Westside ConnectED (a group of West Side organizations who worked together on the Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Innovation Accountable health Communities Grant application - while we did not receive funding, the organizations are committed to the goal) to look at the social determinant needs of communities with hardship. Rush has also been on the steering committee of both aforementioned collaborative organizations, as well as the recently formed West Side Total Health Collaborative and Anchor Mission Collaborative, all of which represent many health departments, most city and county hospitals, and 100+ community based organizations across different groups.Rush developed a social determinant of health screening tool (includes topics such as food security, housing, utilities, primary care/insurance) in partnership with the Westside ConnectED leadership such as Catholic Charities, Presence Health, UI Health, the Patient Innovation Center and partners such as the Greater Chicago Food Depository. Rush will be implementing this in the emergency department, select primary care settings, and community based settings. Rush has actively been working to improve educational attainment through existing longstanding programs such as our partnership with Malcolm X College, Crane Medical Preparatory, and many K-12 programs in affiliation with our Science and Math Excellence Network (SAME) program. Recently Rush has made strategic decisions to align external educational partnerships under one organizational effort - REACH, the Rush Education and Career Hub (SAME now rolls into this umbrella). This builds on years of partnership, but focuses our efforts in an intentional way in communities with most need on the West Side of Chicago. 2.Goal: Improve access to mental and behavioral health services Rush has actively been working to address the mental and behavioral health needs of our patients and communities by having social work services offered to our primary care, inpatient, and emergency department patients. In addition, having the College of Nursing and Rush Community Based Practices offering mental health services in the community, for example at Simpson Academy for Young Women, the College of Nursing Faculty Practice sites, and many community sites. Rush has also offered mental/behavioral health services through the Health Legacy Program for Women. The Health Legacy Program for Women is an evidenced based chronic disease program that also addresses mental/behavioral health needs of the participants such as stress, trauma, and life events.In the past fiscal year, Rush adopted Adverse Childhood Events (ACEs) screenings in some of its community settings. In the Rush Community Based Practices - School Based Health Centers at Orr Academy High School, Simpson Academy for Young Women, and Crane Medical Preparatory as well as our Adolescent Family Center on the near west side campus. 3.Goal: Prevent and reduce chronic disease by focusing on risk factors Tobacco:In the past fiscal year, Rush has been working on standardizing its approach to tobacco control and cessation per our defined needs and our work with the Chicago Department of Public Health's (CDPH) Healthy Chicago 2.0. Rush has developed a formal partnership with other West Side entities to bring Courage to Quit and Counsel to Quit, the Respiratory Health Association of Metropolitan Chicago's tobacco cessation programming, to our west side community partners as part of the Chicago Quits Grant. Rush was one of the academic partners on the application to CDPH. Rush Oak Park Hospital (ROPH) and Rush University Medical Center both offer Courage to Quit classes already for employees, patients, and community members, and they are especially well attended at ROPH - the goal is to expand this effort. In addition, Rush helped sponsor CDPH's Nobody Quits Like Chicagoland and has joined the City's work-group on tobacco efforts. In addition Rush is automating a referral to the Illinois Tobacco Quit Line to help our patients and community members from 2018 onward.Food Security/Healthy Eating:The Food Surplus Project began at Rush Oak Park Hospital and not only decreases our food waste, but also helps the Oak Park River Forest Food Pantry (OPRFFP) in offering nutritious meals to their guests. Rush University Medical Center learned from ROPH and beginning in 2017, RUMC also implemented the Surplus Project. This not only works to reduce waste, but it also uses the surplus food to feed our community. The Food Surplus is donated every Monday, Wednesday, Friday to Franciscan Outreach, the second-largest emergency overnight shelter in the City of Chicago. Rush has also developed partnership with Top Box Foods and Greater Chicago Food Depository to help connect patients, community members, and employees to food. This will be expanding in 2017-2018. Oak Park has also implemented a health screening effort, led by nurses, at OPRFFP. Chronic Disease:Healthy Motivations is Rush Oak Park Hospital's community wellness program. It provides free educational seminars and fitness classes, which are designed to help community members lead healthier lives and address chronic disease. Healthy Motivations provided education on topics such as heart and vascular disease, preventive health and depression.The Rush Community Service Initiative Program Clinic at Facing Forward to End Homelessness, is an example of a student and employee led wellness clinic that occurs on a weekly basis and focuses on disease management, access to healthy food, and tobacco control. Lastly, the Health Promotion: Chronic Disease Self-Management Program through Rush's Department of Health and Aging offers interactive, six-week workshops to help those with ongoing health conditions - such as arthritis, heart or lung disease and asthma - maintain control and confidence in managing their health while doing the things that matter most in life4.Goal: Increase access to care and community services Rush's formal partnership with CommunityHealth, which includes provider/students volunteering their time, as well as a formal referral source which began in 2016, allows for better connecting patients to primary care and insurance. CommunityHealth improves access to care by offering health services ranging from routine physicals and immunization programs to a full laboratory and pharmacy as well as free services for medications and dental, something that Rush does not traditionally offer. Rush screens patients for lack of primary care providers and insurance and our Transitional Care Program helps alleviate this need through a connection to charity care or CommunityHealth. Since Rush providers also work at CommunityHealth, we ensure continuity of care and can ensure help with specialty care that CommunityHealth cannot provide to patients. This referral process in the past year expanded to one of our community programs at Franciscan Outreach, the second largest emergency overnight shelter in Chicago, to screen patients for primary care/insurance and provide transitional care services and when possible- connecting patients with primary care/insurance at CommunityHealth. In addition, Rush community clinics, administered by the College of Nursing and the Office of Community Engagement, provide healthcare services to underserved individuals, families, and communities at a variety of diverse community practice sites. These sites include three School-Based Health Centers, employee wellness programs, women's health clinics, nurse practitioner primary care, and case management programs for mental illness and substance abuse."

SPECIFICALLY FOR THE 2016 CHNA, COMMUNITY INPUT WAS ACQUIRED BY REVIEWING EXISTING COMMUNITY REPORTS AND BY DISCUSSIONS WITH EXISTING COMMUNITY BASED GROUPS ABOUT THE DATA-IDENTIFIED NEEDS. THE CHIW REVIEWED SEVERAL RECENTLY CONDUCTED COMMUNITY ENGAGED REPORTS AROUND COMMUNTY HEALTH IN MONROE COUNTY, PRIMARILY THOSE CONDUCTED FOR DSRIP IN LATE 2015. FOCUS GROUPS AND KEY INFORMANT INTERVIEWS WERE CONDUCTED BY COMMON GROUND HEALTH FOR THE DSRIP COMMUNITY NEEDS ASSESSMENT IN 2015. THE FOCUS GROUP FINDINGS PROVIDED INSIGHT INTO ISSUES IMPACTING HEALTH OF THE MEDICAID POPULATION. THREE KEY THEMES THAT EMERGED FROM THE FOCUS GROUPS INCLUDED 1. THE EFFECT OF SOCIAL DETERMINANTS INCLUDING POVERTY ON HEALTH, 2. HEALTH LITERACY AND THE IMPACT IT HAS ON PEOPLES ABILITY TO MANAGE THEIR HEALTH AND 3. THE IMPORTANCE OF CULTURALLY APPROPRIATE CARE. IN LATE 2014, COMMON GROUND HEALTH, IN COLLABORATION WITH THE HIGH BLOOD PRESSURE COLLABORATIVE OF THE ROCHESTER CHAMBER OF COMMERCE, CONDUCTED A SERIES OF FOCUS GROUPS WITH PEOPLE DIAGNOSED WITH HIGH BLOOD PRESSURE. KEY THEMES IDENTIFIED DURING THE FOCUS GROUPS INCLUDED A NEED TO SUPPORT PEOPLE IN MAKING LIFESTYLE CHANGES, HEALTH LITERACY, AND STRATEGIES AROUND MEDICATION COMPLIANCE. THE ROCHESTER-MONROE ANTI-POVERTY INITIATIVE AT UNITED WAY (RMAPI), IN 2015, FORMED SIX WORKGROUPS INCLUDING HEALTH & NUTRITION, EDUCATION, HOUSING, JOBS, JUSTICE SYSTEM AND SAFE NEIGHBORHOODS WITH CROSS-SECTION REPRESENTATION INCLUDING COMMUNITY MEMBERS. RECOMMENDATIONS FROM THE HEALTH AND NUTRITION WORK GROUP CENTERED AROUND FOOD ACCESS, SCREENING FOR FOOD INSECURITY, FOOD LITERACY, AND PREVENTING AND ADDRESSING TRAUMA ACROSS THE LIFESPAN (INCLUDING EMPOWERING EVERY WOMAN IN HER SEXUAL AND REPRODUCTIVE CHOICES.)

IN SHORT, THE WORKGROUP EXTENSIVELY REVIEWED THE NEW YORK STATE PREVENTION AGENDA WITH PARTICULAR INTEREST IN THE COUNTY LEVEL DASHBOARDS. THE CHIW GROUP EXAMINED AREAS IN WHICH MONROE COUNTY WAS IDENTIFIED AS WORSE THAN NEW YORK STATE AS A WHOLE OR IN WHICH MONROE COUNTY WAS NOT PREVIOUSLY ABLE TO MEET THE PREVENTION AGENDA TARGET. ADDITIONALLY, THE GROUP LOOKED FOR NEW OR EMERGING TROUBLESOME HEALTH TRENDS THAT MAY NOT HAVE BEEN IDENTIFIED AS A PREVENTION AGENDA TARGET. THIRTEEN AREAS OF PARTICULAR CONCERN WERE IDENTIFIED AND WERE PRIORITIZED ACCORDING TO WHERE THE COMMUNITY HAD THE GREATEST POTENTIAL FOR MAKING THE MOST IMPACT WITHIN THE 3-6 YEAR TIMEFRAME. THE FOLLOWING HEALTH NEEDS WERE IDENTIFIED AND PRIORITIES SELECTED: Tobacco Use Chronic Disease Care Childhood Health Unplanned Pregnancy Substance Abuse Additional areas of concern: Obesity STD morbidity Colorectal Cancer Adverse childhood experiences Violence Suicide Premature Birth Teen pregnancy INTERVENTIONS WERE PLANNED AROUND THE SELECTED AREAS OF TOBACCO CESSATION, CHRONIC DISEASE MANAGEMENT, CHILDHOOD HEALTH, UNPLANNED PREGNANCY AND SUBSTANCE ABUSE. THE OTHER AREAS OF CONCERN WERE NOT ADDRESSED IN THE IMPROVEMENT PLAN, PRIMARILY BECAUSE OF LIMITED RESORUCES, LACK OF FUNDING AND TIME, AS WELL AS AVOIDING ""MISSION CREEP"" FOR THE HOSPITALS. OBESITY, ALTHOUGH A MAJOR PROBLEM IN OUR COMMUNITY WAS NOT SELECTED BECAUSE THE CHIW WAS NOT CLEAR ON AN EFFECTIVE INTERVENTION GIVEN THE 3-YEAR IMPLEMENTATION PERIOD. COLORECTAL CANCER SCREENINGS ARE BEING ADDRESSED THROUGH THE CANCER SERVICES DEPARTMENT WITHIN THE CENTER FOR COMMUNITY HEALTH, AND ONLY IMPACTS A SMALLER SUBSET OF THE POPULATION. ADVERSE CHILDHOOD EXPRIENCES, VIOLENCE AND SUICIDE PREVENTION ALL CENTER AROUND MENTAL HEALTH WHICH IS THE PRIMARY FOCUS OF THE DSRIP INITIATIVE IN OUR COMMUNITY, AND VIOLENCE PREVENTION WAS THOUGHT TO BE BEYOND THE MISSION OF THE HOSPITALS AT THIS TIME. STDS, PREMATURE BIRTHS AND TEEN PREGNANCIES SOMEWHAT OVERLAP WITH THE UNPLANNED PREGNANCY PRIORITY AREA THAT WAS SELECTED. EDUCATION AROUND AVOIDING RISKY SEXUAL BEHAVIOR, AS RECOMMENDED TO ADDRESS UNPLANNED PREGNANCY, WILL ALSO IMPACT THESE AREAS OF CONCERN. OF COURSE, WITH UNLIMITED RESOURCES, WE WOULD ADDRESS ALL THESE AREAS, BUT UNFORTUNATELY WE NEED TO PRIORITIZE FOR THE GIVEN TIME PERIOD. THE HOSPITAL IS ADDRESSING THE SIGNIFICANT NEEDS IDENTIFIED IN THE 2016 CHNA THROUGH MANY INTERVENTIONS DESCRIBED IN THE IMPLEMENTATION STRATEGY. PROGRESS ON THE IMPLEMENTATION STRATEGY IS WIDELY AVAILABLE TO THE PUBLIC AND CAN BE FOUND ON THE SAME WEBSITE AS THE CHNA (https://www.urmc.rochester.edu/community.aspx). TOBACCO USE: IMPLEMENTATION EFFORTS CONTINUE SMOKING CESSATION, AT THE TIME OF THE CHNA 2016, UNIVERSITY OF ROCHESTER STRONG AND HIGHLAND WERE WORKING TO ADOPT AN OPT-TO-QUIT POLICY WHERE IDENTIFIED SMOKERS WILL BE AUTOMATICALLY REFERRED TO THE NY STATE QUIT LINE. EMR CHANGES WERE IN PROCESS AND THE POLICY HAS BEEN IMPLEMENTED AT STRONG AND HIGHLAND. THE OBJECTIVES FOR THIS FOCUS AREA INCLUDE: Objective 1.1: UR STRONG will enact a tobacco cessation policy that incorporates the ""opt-to-quit"" program and will implement that policy thereby electronically linking tobacco using patients to the NYS quit line. Objective 1.3: UR STRONG WILL WORK TO decrease the percent of women who smoke during pregnancy from 11% of births (2013 vital statistics) to less than 10% of births, and to especially concentrate on those women who receive Medicaid baseline 20% of births were smoking during pregnancy. UR STRONG AGREES WITH THE CONCEPT OF REFERRING ALL TOBACCO USERS TO THE NY STATE QUITLINE VIA THE EMR. IMPLEMENTATION EFFORTS FOR THE 2016-18 TIME PERIOD WILL INCLUDE ESTABLISHING THE EMR CHANGES, ASSURING PRIVATE TRANSFER OF DATA TO THE QUITLINE, ESTABLISHING FEEDBACK TO THE REFERRING PHYSICIANS AND EVALUATING THE INCREASE IN REFERRALS TO THE QUITLINE. UR STRONG IS ALSO ADDRESSING SMOKING DURING PREGNANCY BY LINKING PATIENTS WITHIN THE BABY LOVE PROGRAM WITH THE ""MOMMY AND ME TOBACCO FREE"" PROGRAM TO INCREASE CESSATION. CHRONIC DISEASE CARE: OUR WORK HERE FOCUSES ON HYPERTENTION CONTROL. TO ADDRESS BLOOD PRESSURE CONTROL, UR CONTINUES TO BE AN ACTIVE MEMBER OF THE ROCHESTER BUSINESS ALLIANCE (CHAMBER OF COMMERCE) HEALTH CARE PLANNING TEAM THAT MEETS WEEKLY AND IS FOCUSING ON HYPERTENSION. UR HAS MANAGED A COMMUNITY HEALTH WORKER PROGRAM THAT CONCENTRATES ON BLOOD PRESSURE CONTROL, CONTRIBUTES TO A REGIONAL REGISTRY OF HYPERTENSIVE PATIENTS, HELPS FUND IMPROVEMENT INITIATIVES, AND PARTICIPATES IN THE PRACTICE IMPROVEMENT CONSULTANT PROGRAM TO INCREASE CONTROL RATES. THE OBJECTIVES FOR THIS FOCUS AREA INCLUDE: Objective 2.1: By December 2018, decrease the disparity among hypertensive residents in the local registry who have their blood pressure in control by increasing the control rate among Monroe County African Americans [58.8% and Latinos (61.5%) compared to Whites (75.4%)] Objective 2.2: Increase the control rate for hypertensive patients who also have diabetes ADDRESSING DISPARITY IN HYPERTENSION CONTROL RATES WILL INCLUDE COLLABORATION WITH THE DSRIP CULTURAL COMPETENCY WORKGROUP AS WELL AS THE REGISTRY REPORTING FUNCTION. CHILDHOOD HEALTH: UR STRONG WILL BE WORKING TO IMPROVING CHILDHOOD HEALTH BY FOLLOWING THE APA GUIDELINE TO SCREEN ALL CHILDREN FOR FOOD INSECURITY AT WELL CHILD VISITS. THE OBJECTIVE FOR THIS FOCUS AREA IS: Objective 4.1: Decrease the percent of children living in food insecure households from 20.5% (Feeding America, 2014) while also striving to decrease the percent of adults who experienced food insecurity in the past year worried or stressed about having enough money to buy nutritious meals (EBRFSS2013-4) from 23% in Monroe County. AT LEASE ONE PEDIATRIC CLINIC IN STRONG IS CURRENTLY SCREENING FOR FOOD INSECURITY AND UR STRONG COMMITS TO ENHANCING THIS PROCESS WITH ACTIVE REFERRAL AS WELL AS EXPANDING THE MODEL TO OTHER CLINICS WITHIN UR AS WELL AS WITHIN OTHER HOSPITALS AND OFFICES IN MONROE COUNTY. WE WILL ALSO ASSURE THAT RESOURCES TO FOOD FOR FAMILIES WHO POSITIVELY SCREEN FOR FOOD INSECURITY ARE KNOWN AND ACCESSIBLE AND UPDATED. UNPLANNED PREGNANCY: THE CHIW AND UR STRONG ARE COMMITTED TO REDUCING THE UNPLANNED PREGNANCY RATE IN MONROE COUNTY AND TO ADDRESSING THE SIGNIFICANT DISPARITIES THAT EXIST BY RACE, ZIP CODE AND ECONOMIC STATUS. WE HAVE THE FOLLOWING OBJECTIVES: Objective 3.1: By December 2018, reduce significant barriers to the use of LARC (Long-Acting Reversible Contraception), particularly among at-risk women of reproductive age Objective 3.2: By December 2018, increase the number of youth reached with evidence-based sexual health education (baseline measure of current youth being reached is needed) PRIMARY TO THE BARRIERS TO THE USE OF LARC IS THE MEDICAID REIMBURSEMENT RULES IN NEW YORK THAT DOES NOT ACCOUNT FOR PLACEMENT OF LARC IN MEDICAID MANAGED CARE PARTICIPANTS (AT THE TIME OF THE CHNA/IMPROVEMENT PLANNING). UR STRONG IS COMMITTED TO CHANGING THIS RULE AND ASSURING THE MEDICAID CLIENTS CAN RECEIVE LARC AT DELIVERY IF DESIRED. OTHER BARRIERS TO BE ADDRESSED INCLUDE LACK OF EDUCATION AND LACK OF TRAINING ON INSERTION. IN ADDITION TO LOGISTICAL BARRIERS TO LARC, UNPLANNED PREGNANCY CAN BE REDUCED BY WORKING TO EDUCATE YOUTH IN OUR COMMUNITY AROUND SAFE SECURE HEALTH AND GOAL SETTING, ETC. UR AND THE CHIW WILL WORK WITH COMMUNITY AGENCIES, PARTICULARY THE METRO COUNCIL FOR TEEN POTENTIAL. SUBSTANCE ABUSE: UR STRONG WILL JOIN OTHER LEAD AGENCIES TO ADDRESS THE OPIOID EPIDEMIC PLAGUING OUR COMMUNITY. ADDRESSING THIS PROBLEM HAS MANY PREVENTION STRATEGIES FROM PREVENTING SUBSTANCE ABUSE TO DECREASING DEATHS DUE TO OPIOID OVERDOSE AND TREATMENT FOR THOSE WHO ARE ADDICTED. OUR OBJECTIVE FOCUSES ON DEATHS DUE TO OVERDOSE: Objective 5.1: By December 2018, decrease the number of deaths due to opioid overdose from 69 in 2015 (Medical Examiners report of 2015). THERE IS A MONROE COUNTY TASK FORCE ADDRESSING OPIOID MISUSE AND UR STRONG COMMITS TO SENDING REPRESENTATION TO THE TASK FORCE AND SUPPORTING ANY PLANS THAT COME FROM THAT GROUP OF EXPERTS. --------------------"

These community members were selected based on their involvement within the community and because they provided distinctive backgrounds and a variety of perspective on the state of the community and health care. Interviews were conducted with a number of directors and staff members from the community health centers, members from social service organizations, educational leaders, religious groups and elected officials. The selected participants give an overarching viewpoint of the community and through these interviews the health needs from the perspective of the community were identified. BKD, LLP was engaged to conduct a formal community health needs assessment. The community health needs assessment was conducted from January 2016 through May 2016. Based on current literature and other guidance from the treasury and the IRS, the following steps were conducted as part of the Health System's community health needs assessment. An evaluation of the impact of actions taken to address the significant health needs identified in the prior community health needs assessment was completed and an implementation strategy scorecard was prepared to understand the effectiveness of the Health System's current strategies and programs. The ""community"" served by the Health System was defined by utilizing inpatient and outpatient data regarding patient origin. This process is further described in Community Served by the Health System. Population demographics and socioeconomic characteristics of the community were gathered and reported utilizing various third parties. The health status of the community was then reviewed. Information on the leading causes of death and morbidity information was analyzed in conjunction with health outcomes and factors reported for the community by CountyHealthRankings.org. Health factors with significant opportunity for improvement were noted. Community input was provided through key informant interviews. Results and findings are described in the Key informant section of the formal report. Information gathered in the steps above was analyzed and reviewed to identify health issues of uninsured persons, low income persons and minority groups and the community as a whole. Health needs were ranked utilizing a weighting method that weighs the following: the size of the problem; the seriousness of the problem; impact of the issues on vulnerable populations; the prevalence of common themes; how important the issue is to the community; how the issue aligns with the Health System's strategic plan. An inventory of health care facilities and other community resources potentially available to address the significant health needs identified through the CHNA was prepared and collaborative efforts were identified. Health needs were then prioritized taking into account the perceived degree of influence the Health System has to impact the need and the health needs impact on overall health for the community. Information gaps identified during the prioritization process have been reported."

201821299349302007,231365353,"PART V, SECTION B, LINE 11 - ADDRESSING NEEDS","ENGAGED STAKEHOLDERS AND COMMUNITY HEALTH LEADERSHIP FROM BOTH HEALTH SYSTEMS USED THE FOLLOWING CRITERIA FOR DETERMINING HEALTH PRIORITIES: SCOPE OF PROBLEM, SERIOUSNESS OF PROBLEM AND ABILITY TO IMPACT LOCALLY. BASED ON THE IDENTIFIED NEEDS FOR LANCASTER COUNTY FROM THE 2016 CHNA AND THE VALUABLE INPUT RECEIVED FROM COMMUNITY HEALTH STAKEHOLDERS, THE BOARD OF TRUSTEES FOR LG HEALTH/PENN MEDICINE APPROVED THE DEVELOPMENT OF A 2017-2019 IMPLEMENTATION STRATEGY FOCUSED ON IMPROVING OBESITY, MENTAL WELL-BEING, AND SUBSTANCE ABUSE, WHILE ADDRESSING DISPARITIES, POVERTY, AND ACCESS WITHIN EACH HEALTH TOPIC. BOARD APPROVAL WAS OBTAINED ON MARCH 10, 2016. THESE PRIORITIES HAVE BEEN ADOPTED INTO LG HEALTHS ANNUAL OPERATING PLAN AND BUDGET. ALTHOUGH ACCESS TO CARE HAS BEEN AN ORGANIZATIONAL PRIORITY AT LG HEALTH FOR MANY YEARS, THIS TARGETED AND SYSTEMIC APPROACH TO IMPACT THE SOCIAL DETERMINANTS OF HEALTH ILLUSTRATES A SHIFT IN HEALTH IMPROVEMENT. THIS APPROACH TO BOTH CARE DELIVERY AND COMMUNITY HEALTH IMPROVEMENT IS VALIDATED BY FEDERALLY DEVELOPED PROGRAMS SUCH AS THE ACCOUNTABLE HEALTH COMMUNITIES MODEL (CENTERS FOR MEDICARE AND MEDICAID SERVICES) AND THE HI-5 HEALTH IMPACT IN 5 YEARS INITIATIVE (CENTERS FOR DISEASE CONTROL AND PREVENTION). TO APPROPRIATELY ADDRESS THE NEEDS OF OUR FRIENDS AND NEIGHBORS IN LANCASTER COUNTY, THE 2017-2019 STRATEGIES FOR COMMUNITY HEALTH IMPROVEMENT WILL BE DEPLOYED AT 3 LEVELS: ENGAGEMENT OF PATIENTS THAT WE SEE WITHIN OUR ENTITIES, UNDER RESOURCED COMMUNITIES THAT HAVE BEEN IDENTIFIED AS THOSE WITH THE HIGHEST SOCIOECONOMIC NEED BASED ON HIGH POVERTY, LOW EDUCATIONAL ATTAINMENT, AND LIMITED ACCESS TO CARE. ENGAGEMENT OF PATIENTS THAT WE SEE WITHIN OUR ENTITIES ARE THE IDENTIFIED COMMUNITIES: LANCASTER CITY (SOUTH OF KING STREET), COLUMBIA, PEQUEA VALLEY SCHOOL DISTRICT, AND SOLANCO SCHOOL DISTRICT AS WELL AS THE COMMUNITY AT LARGE (LANCASTER COUNTY). PARTNERSHIPS WITHIN THE UNDER RESOURCED COMMUNITIES AS WELL AS THE COUNTY AT LARGE, ARE VITAL TO ACHIEVING LASTING IMPACT ON HEALTH OUTCOMES. WE WILL WORK COLLABORATIVELY WITH SPECIFIC KEY PARTNERS THAT HAVE: COMMITTED TO ADDRESS SOCIAL AND ENVIRONMENTAL DETERMINANTS OF HEALTH, AGREED TO A COMMON AGENDA TO ADDRESS ROOT CAUSES OF HEALTH PROBLEMS AND HEALTH DISPARITIES IN LANCASTER COUNTY, AGREED TO MEASURE HEALTH RELATED INDICATORS AND REGULARLY REPORT PROGRESS TOWARDS IMPROVING THESE INDICATORS, DEMONSTRATED ORGANIZATIONAL CAPACITY TO ACHIEVE GOALS. EVIDENCE-BASED TACTICS TO ADDRESS OBESITY, MENTAL WELL-BEING, AND SUBSTANCE MISUSE/ABUSE ARE ADDRESSED AND WILL BE OUTLINED IN THE COMMUNITY HEALTH IMPROVEMENT PLAN THAT WILL BE RELEASED PUBLICALLY AT THE END OF 2016. THESE TACTICS WILL ADDRESS EACH LEVEL OF THE SOCIO-ECOLOGICAL MODEL AND ARE FOCUSED SPECIFICALLY ON: AWARENESS, EDUCATION, BEHAVIORAL CHANGE, SYSTEMS CHANGE, POLICY CHANGE (BOTH ORGANIZATIONAL/LOCAL POLICIES, AS WELL AS LEGISLATIVE CHANGE), AND ENVIRONMENTAL CHANGE. THIS TARGETED AND SYSTEMIC APPROACH HAS BEEN VETTED THROUGH OUR BOARD OF TRUSTEES, PHYSICIAN LEADERS, KEY PARTNERS, AND COMMUNITY NURSES AT VARIOUS MEETINGS DURING JUNE, JULY, AND AUGUST OF 2016. THE HEALTH NEED NOT BEING ADDRESSED IS ASTHMA. LANCASTER COUNTYS POOR AIR QUALITY IS NOT ENTIRELY A RESULT OF THE ACTIVITIES OF THOSE WHO WORK AND LIVE IN LANCASTER COUNTY. POOR AIR QUALITY IS ALSO A RESULT OF THE PROXIMITY OF SIGNIFICANT SOURCES AND THE PREVAILING WINDS FROM THOSE SOURCES. IN ADDITION TO THE AIR POLLUTION THAT IS PRODUCED IN THE COUNTY, POLLUTION TRAVELS ON THE WIND FROM NEARBY CITIES SUCH AS THE BALTIMORE-WASHINGTON METRO AREA AND LARGE INDUSTRIAL NEIGHBOR COUNTIES SUCH AS YORK COUNTY, AS WELL AS FROM MORE DISTANT UPWIND AREAS SUCH AS WESTERN PENNSYLVANIA AND THE OHIO RIVER VALLEY. LANCASTER COUNTY IS NOT DIRECTLY RESPONSIBLE FOR ITS POOR AIR QUALITY AND CANNOT CHANGE THE LAND OR WIND PATTERNS; ENCOURAGING RESIDENTS TO ADOPT MORE ENVIRONMENTALLY FRIENDLY LIFESTYLES MAY MAKE A SUBTLE DIFFERENCE. LG HEALTH DOES NOT PLAN TO INCLUDE AIR QUALITY AND ENVIRONMENTAL CHANGE AS A KEY PRIORITY. HOWEVER, LG HEALTH PLANS TO ADDRESS CHRONIC DISEASES THROUGH ADDRESSING OBESITY AND TOBACCO. BY ADDRESSING THESE KEY PRIORITIES, LG HEALTH WILL HELP TO REDUCE THE NUMBER OF INDIVIDUALS IN LANCASTER COUNTY WHO DEVELOP A CHRONIC DISEASE, THUS REDUCING THE NUMBER OF INDIVIDUALS IN LANCASTER COUNTY WHO ARE AT A HIGHER RISK FOR COMPLICATIONS DUE TO POOR AIR QUALITY. LG HEALTH WILL ALSO INCLUDE ADDRESSING ASTHMA AND LUNG DISEASE AS PART OF THE TOBACCO HEALTH IMPROVEMENT PLAN AND WILL CONTINUE TO MONITOR THIS INDICATOR. IF THIS INDICATOR WERE TO CHANGE FOR THE WORSE, LG HEALTH WILL REASSESS ANNUAL PARTICLE POLLUTION AND TAKE APPROPRIATE ACTIONS. -------------------------"

These included representatives who understood the needs and issues related to various underrepresented groups including medically underserved populations, low-income persons, minority groups, and those with chronic disease and mental health needs, individuals with expertise in public health, and internal program managers. The OVH steering committee met three times to provide guidance on the various components of the CHNA. The staff, steering committee members and consulting team made significant efforts to ensure that the entire primary service territory, all socio-demographic groups and all potential needs, issues and underrepresented populations were considered in the assessment. This was accomplished by identifying focus groups and key stakeholders that represented the various subgroups in the community. In addition, the process included public health participation and input, through extensive use of the PA Health Department and Centers for Disease Control data."

Expand primary care to promote nutrition, smoking cessation and psychological screeningsWhile there are many priorities being addressed by OVH's needs assessment, there were other health indicators that were not considered a high priority and subsequently are not addressed through these implementation strategies because they are already being addressed by the hospital, existing community assets, necessary resources to meet these needs are lacking, or these needs fall outside of the OVH mission. These indicators include: COPD/chronic Bronchitis, cerebrovascular disease, lung cancer, access to patient advocate, Alzheimer's disease, prescription drug and alcohol misuse/abuse/mortality, arthritis, pneumonia, medication management, asthma, colorectal cancer, prostate cancer, short-term home health assistance, affordability of health care including insurance costs, co-pays, and deductibles, communication between doctors, specialists, insurance companies, health/insurance literacy, melanoma/skin cancer, at-home risk assessments, falls, suicide, HIV testing, pre-approval wait time, accessibility of doctor's office, communication between home health workers, patient, and family, tobacco use during pregnancy, teen pregnancy and birth outcomes, breastfeeding, auto accidents and firearms. Other nonhealthcare indicators noted were related to poverty, unemployment and lack of jobs, while the Hospital offers numerous health and wellness programs addressing the financial needs of OVH's service area residents, addressing these specific items is outside of the scope of the mission of the hospital."

HSHS St. Elizabeth Hospital undertook a nine-month planning and implementation effort to develop the CHNA, identify and prioritize community health needs for its service area and formulate an implementation plan to guide ongoing population health initiatives with like-missioned partners and collaborators. HSHS St. Elizabeth's senior leadership engaged Southern Illinois School of Medicine's Center for Clinical Research and Office of Community Health and Service to provide quantitative and secondary data and community health data on the four county service areas. In addition, the team along with members of the Community Benefit Committee identified additional data sets to review and discuss with focus groups. Internal data collected consisted of the top 10 diagnosis of patients admitted to the hospital from the Emergency Department and the top 10 diagnosis of patients discharged from the Emergency Department. The FY12 Community Health Needs Assessment was also included in the data review. A core group of HSHS St. Elizabeth's colleagues and our physician partners provided valuable input for this CHNA. This focus group discussed the data, shared insights from their perspective and identified their top three health care focus areas. HSHS St. Elizabeth's Hospital also leveraged existing relationships that provided diverse input for a comprehensive review and analysis of community health needs in the hospital's service area. These external component steps included conducting a survey at the Regional Health Policy Summit, leading focus groups, and utilizing the expertise of the existing Community Benefit Committee members. Community members were invited based on their awareness and expertise in the needs of our community. There was attention afforded to those who work with the underserved, low income, and minority populations as well as populations with chronic disease. In addition, a special focus group was conducted with the homeless in their environment. Local focus groups were sponsored by community partners, which further demonstrate HSHS St. Elizabeth's integration with the community. Members include: director, St. Clair County Public Health Commission; retired nurse, St. Clair Mental Health Board (mental health); the Carla Smith Foundation (families of the mentally ill); USAF Nurse, Scott Air Force Base (Population Health); local clergy; community based hospice; BEACON ministries (social services agency for the poor and underserved); Health Visions East social worker for low income, medically underserved, and the elderly; local mental health agencies; representatives from senior living; a university professor; agency for domestic violence prevention; legal and financial services that represent low income population; and a member of the local Federally Quantified Healthcare Agency."

Identifying and prioritizing the areas of focus was completed using LEAN Principles. The charter, the first step in the LEAN process, consisted of identifying the primary customers, the scope of the project, the primary goal and the metrics selected for the CHNA. HSHS St. Elizabeth's listened to the voice of the customer and collaborated with our community partners. Individuals included the Community Benefit team, social agencies such as BEACON ministries, the executive medical staff, and SIU School of Medicine. The key drivers selected included the SIU secondary data analysis, focus groups, surveys, and Emergency Department (ED) data. These key drivers were further delineated into critical to quality requirements that provided measureable specifications. Data collected and measured included focus group members' top three health needs, survey results of the top three health needs, and the top 10 ED diagnoses for both admitted and discharged patients. The data was collected and analyzed using a pareto chart. A pareto chart measures data in decreasing order of occurrence. The pareto chart identified poverty as the largest area of need followed by access to health care, obesity, food scarcity, diabetes and substance abuse as the top six community health needs. As a health care organization, HSHS St. Elizabeth's expertise and resources are best used addressing a health care need with measureable outcomes. Noting the association among some of the topics, the data was categorized using an affinity diagram, which organizes a large amount of data into natural relationships. Using the data in the affinity diagram, a new pareto chart was created. The priority areas that rose to the top were nutrition, mental health/substance abuse, access to care, and cardiac disease. As part of the identification and prioritization of health needs, HSHS St. Elizabeth's senior leadership team and the CHNA Steering Committee considered the estimated feasibility and effectiveness of possible interventions by the hospital to impact these health priorities; the burden, scope, severity, or urgency of the health need; the health disparities associated with the health needs; the importance the community places on addressing the health need; and other community assets and resources that could be leveraged through strategic collaboration in the hospital's service area to address the health need. Based on the CHNA planning and development process described, the following community health needs were identified: 1. Nutrition and Wellness 2. Access to Care 3. Cardiac Disease Implementation Plan to Address Identified Needs HSHS St. Elizabeth's Hospital partnered with other organizations to develop, implement, monitor and evaluate both new and ongoing initiatives that address the identified priority community health needs. The set of implementation strategies and interventions are contained in the Implementation Plan, which was approved and adopted by an authorized body of the hospital. The implementation strategies and interventions will include, but are not limited to, the following initiatives: Wellness related to Nutrition a. Goal: To partner with Cosgrove's Kitchen to provide a series of education classes on nutrition and provide free health screening services. Measure: Conduct quarterly classes at Cosgrove's Kitchen. b. Goal: To provide support and information to individuals with diabetes to help with diabetes self-management. Measure: Continue to provide diabetes support. Measure: Provide health screenings/glucose test and education to the community. Measure: Refer and track pre-diabetes patients for classes to our partner, the YMCA. c. Goal: To provide the services of a dietitian to organizations free of charge for education about nutrition and healthy eating. Measure: Registered dietitian will make presentations during the year in partnership with local agencies. Access to Health Care a. Goal: To continue providing financial assistance programs for patients who cannot pay for services received. To determine eligibility, a scale based upon the Federal Poverty Guidelines (FPG) will be used. Measure: Information about financial assistance programs will be communicated in registration areas and through patient accounting representatives. Eligibility will be based upon the Federal Poverty Guidelines (FPG) established by the U.S. Department of Health & Human Service b. Goal: To increase enrollment in the health insurance exchange (HIE). Measure: During the period of open enrollment on the HIE, November 1, 2015 and end January 31, 2016, HSHS St. Elizabeth's Hospital will distribute one news release to the local media about open enrollment and place information on the hospital's website. The services of an enrollment counselor will be funded by the hospital as the level of need is determined for the county and in coordination with the local/regional public health departments. c. Goal: To further assess the need for non-emergency medical transportation and identify other organizations for possible collaboration. Measure: Assessment will be completed and one action taken as identified to improve transportation access and/or reduce costs for low income residents. Collaboration will be completed with current public transportation provider, as appropriate. d. Goal: To address to the needs of eligible patients that require medications and services to safely transition patients to an appropriate level of care. Measure: Collaborate with other organizations that support the continuum of care for eligible patients and can provide needed services. Heart Disease/Cerebrovascular Disease a. Goal: To promote heart health awareness, education about cardiovascular disease, and healthy eating and lifestyle choices. Measure: During the month of February, nationally recognized as Heart Health month, one activity will be held for community health education. Measure: Conduct/participate in quarterly community health programs. Measure: Meet with outside agencies and hospitals and provide cardiac and stroke education. Measure: Participate in a division wide diabetes/cardiac campaign in partnership with Walmart and create a cohort of patients that we can measure and track physical behavioral changes. In addition to the above activities HSHS St. Elizabeth's continues to engage the community in many other activities that provide support to the poor and underserved. Colleagues mentor students in a variety of disciplines to include a family practice residency program, pharmacy, nursing and multiple ancillary departments. As an outcome of the prioritization process, the following community health needs were also identified and will not be addressed directly by the hospital for the reasons indicated: Mental Health and Substance Abuse was listed as the second health care priority. HSHS St. Elizabeth's will continue to partner with local and state agencies to assist when feasible with mental health and substance abuse. HSHS St. Elizabeth's transitioned of our mental health resources and expertise to a local community partner. HSHS St. Elizabeth's lacks necessary resources to pursue this priority. Tobacco Use is addressed by the County Health Department smoking cessation classes. Due the complexity of this issue, the hospital will not take lead on poverty. There are several agencies that are addressing this issue. HSHS St. Elizabeth's partners with agencies such as East-Side Aligned, Catholic Urban Programs, St. Vincent DePaul, and BEACON ministries, where we can provide support. The hospital will not take lead on violent crime because it is not an area of expertise for HSHS St. Elizabeth's, however an active partnership exists with the Violence Prevention Center and a positive working relationship exists between HSHS St Elizabeth's and local law enforcement. Sexually Transmitted Diseases are addressed by the local health department. The hospital did not take the lead on available healthy food and food scarcity. These needs are addressed by groups including local food pantries, East Side Health District, and East Side Aligned. The hospital supports these efforts by donating health food to the local food pantry through our food drives. The hospital has a special care nursery and a pediatrician on staff but lacks the resources to further enhance programs for maternal and child health at this time. It is part of the St Clair County IPLAN. Lung Cancer is being addressed in the IPLAN and HSHS St. Elizabeth's does offer new technology to screen for lung cancer."

The Healthy York County Coalition (HYCC) a local health coalition representing the diversity of the community has led each of the six CHNAs that have been conducted. For the 2015 CHNA, HYCC partnered with its sister health coalition in Adams County Healthy Adams County to form a CHNA Planning Committee comprised of representatives from health and human service agencies, government entities, community-based organizations, higher education institutions, and other interested community members to assist with survey development, data review and analysis, and results distribution. This core committee also assisted with sharing the data and associated community health priorities, once identified by Coalition leadership, to community members at a public form in June 2016. WellSpan-York Hospital is a funding partner and governance leader within the Healthy York County Coalition and served on the CHNA Planning committee. In that regard, York Hospital partners to conduct the CHNA, disseminate its results both among hospital leadership and in the community, and integrate evidence-based strategies that impact identified community health needs into its annual planning process. Whether in meetings with community stakeholders or system/hospital leaders or at larger public forums, WellSpan-York Hospital is committed to obtaining community input to ensure that the CHNA and its associated implementation strategies appropriately address the identified needs of the entire community.

In 2015, CHNA results and related priorities identified by the Healthy York County Coalition were shared with the system-wide Planning Committee at WellSpan Health. This Committee is comprised of community members and leaders that represent each of WellSpans primary entities and service areas, in addition to corporate leadership. Planning Committee members reviewed the CHNA data, adopted HYCCs priorities of adult overweight/obesity, depression/mental health, and maternal/child health while also identifying two additional priorities: access related to gaps in care caused by high-deductible insurance plans and the emerging opioid misuse and abuse issue facing the community. These five priorities and associated data were subsequently presented to the WellSpan-York Hospital Board for their adoption. The Healthy York County Coalition communicated the CHNA results and identified priorities to approximately 200 community members at a public forum held on June 11, 2016. During that forum, community members discussed the opportunities and risks associated with each priority, as well as how the organization which they represent can have an impact on the priority.

A focus on improving healthy eating and physical activity behaviors and reducing tobacco use has demonstrated efficacy in reducing the impact of various chronic conditions. A few cardiovascular indicators were ranked high by Community Benefit Council members, but not selected as priorities. These include those who have high blood pressure and high cholesterol, and those who have been told that they have heart disease, heart attack, or stroke risk indicators. Council members felt that the root causes of these conditions - unhealthy eating, physical inactivity, and tobacco use - were already part of the selected priorities - adult overweight/obesity and tobacco use."

In recent years, overall charity care has decreased slightly as more people have obtained health insurance coverage through the Affordable Care Act and the expansion of Pennsylvanias Medical Assistance (Medicaid) program. WellSpan is proud to be a leading partner in the Healthy Community Network, which works to address the needs of uninsured and underinsured individuals in our community. In addition, the health system recently enhanced its financial assistance policy and the discounts that it provides on services. For example, if a patients income is less than 300 percent of the federal poverty level, that patient would be eligible for a 100 percent discount on the services provided. Additionally, significant discounts are available for patients whose income is between 300 percent and 400 percent of the federal poverty level.

To that end the healthcare improvement foundation, Philadelphia, pennsylvania, in partnership with the hospital and health system association of pennsylvania and the u.s. department of health and human services (region 3) convened the regions hospitals in the collaborative opportunities to advance community health (""coach"") project. The goals of coach are to: gather input from public health authorities and key community stakeholders; explore growing number of health and epidemiologic data sources; and collaborate with public health and other stakeholders to prioritize needs, coordinate interventions, and establish measures for evaluating results. Additionally, the health care improvement foundation began facilitation in fy16 of a Montgomery county hospital partnership. The partnerships role, similar to coach, has an exclusive focus on Montgomery county, pennsylvania, and all hospitals, whether profit or non-profit for involvement. Abington Memorial Hospital (""amh"") community health and community benefit leaders worked diligently with the Montgomery county hospital partnership and Jefferson health colleagues, as part of a newly formed organization, to conduct the 2016 chna for Abington health including AMH and Lansdale Hospital Corporation (""LHC""). Community health leaders scheduled meetings, conference calls and follow up conversations, obtained meeting venues, contacted potential participants, and encouraged attendance. Meeting participants were not compensated. Input from all participants, including county and local health department officials and public health experts, was used to further identify and prioritize unmet needs, local problems with access to care and populations with special healthcare needs. Several follow up telephone calls resulted in additional information shared between the non-profit providers and the hospital leaders as the process ensued. Information on the health status and healthcare needs of the residents of AMH's service area was also collected through interviews and meetings and guided by a set of written questions finalized by Abington, Lansdale and Jefferson colleagues in community health and community benefit. Almost 30 interviews were conducted with individuals representing healthcare and community-based organizations who have knowledge of the health and underlying social conditions that affect health of people in their neighborhood and broader community. These interviews were conducted by community health and community benefit leaders to gain insight about health needs and priorities, barriers to improving community health, and the community assets and efforts already in place or being planned to address these issues and concerns. In addition, interviews were conducted with health providers of Abington health to gain their perspective about the health issues of their patients and community and to identify Lansdales and others efforts to address these issues. Interviewees were asked to prioritize the needs/recommendations discussed during their interview. AMH interviews and meetings included: hospital senior leaders, emergency room nursing leadership, corporate departments, population health, women and childrens services, muller institute for senior health staff and human resources and hospitalists to name a few. Community organizations were represented from: Montgomery county health department, Montgomery county intermediate unit, north penn community health foundation leadership, north penn mosque, north penn school district, north penn united way, souderton area school district nurse coordinator, vna foundation of north penn, wissahickon school district nurse coordinator, manna on main street executive director, north penn ymca and Philadelphia freedom valley ymcas of ambler leaders.

The chna from 2013 continues to be posted. Several requests from local nonprofit organizations seeking a copy of the document were given access via the downloadable document on the website or emailed by ah leaders. In fy16, this process remained in effect. All 2016 chna and implementation plans were shared with all key community stakeholders and participants in interviews and meetings. Teams were formed at ah to coincide with the major topic areas in spring 2016. Action plans or implementation plans were written, adopted and approved by the community benefit committee of the abington health foundation (AHF"") board by june 30, 2016. A presentation was made to abingtons legacy board of trustees in april 2016 followed by a presentation to the jefferson health clinical affairs committee. The community health department continues responsibility for the chna and resultant implementation plans to meet community benefit requirements. The strategy of the implementation plans identifies the means through which the hospital plans to address needs that are consistent with the hospitals charitable mission as part of its community benefit programs from 2016 through 2019. Beyond programs discussed in the strategy, the hospital is addressing many of these needs simply by providing care to all, regardless of ability to pay. The hospital anticipates health needs and resources may change, and thus a flexible approach was adopted in the development of its strategy to address needs identified in the 2016 chna. In addition, changes may be warranted by the publication of final regulations. Themes emerged from the chna meetings and were analyzed and coded with all quantitative data. Recognition of themes were discussed and the resulting analysis in the community health needs assessment was organized into major topic or domain areas. Overall, the health of the populations served in the lhc service area is good, ranking higher than the montgomery county and pennsylvania state populations as a whole. Ah's access to care ip/action plan was reviewed immediately with several enhancements introduced. A thorough review of the policy and procedures for financial assistance took place in accordance with internal revenue code 501(r). In fy16 ah continued with a financial counseling center centralizing this function to better accommodate patients and the community. Services onsite at lansdale hospital corporation include a financial counselor to help determine eligibility for government-sponsored programs, and offer assistance with the health insurance exchange and other insurance coverage. A printed financial assistance brochure was created and distributed at ah access points, including clinics, outpatient areas, emergency department at lansdale hospital corporation and primary care offices. Overview of implementation strategy includes: Prioritization was placed into the chna to maximize the resources available to the hospital using domains. The strategy will focus on the priority health needs that are most important in the domain of access to care: mental health services, access to care and healthy lifestyle behaviors especially for social and healthcare needs of older adults and health education, social services and regular source of care. In the chronic disease management domain, most important was obesity followed by diabetes, heart disease and hypertension, stroke and asthma. Healthy lifestyle behaviors and community environment domain includes alcohol/substance abuse and womens cancer. The domain of health screening and early detection includes colon cancer.

Members of the DCHCC deliberated and decided access to care and stress-related conditions should not be addressed as independent priority issues as they are systemic issues that impact all of the other priority health areas. Thus, the implementation strategy (Community Health Improvement Plan) addresses the remaining four priority issues: Sexual Health, Mental Health and Substance Abuse, Obesity/Overweight, and Asthma. HUH adopted the DCHCC priority issues and added Cancer.In preparation for developing the implementation strategy, HUH conducted a series of internal meetings with experts to assess its capacity to address and prioritize the identified health areas based on organizational strategy. With the organizational capacity identified and sanctioned, HUH reconvened as part of the DCHCC process to develop the implementation strategy (Community Health Improvement Plan) as follows: conducted Gap and Strength, Weaknesses, Opportunities, and Threats (SWOT) analyses (for each health priority); prioritization of issues (to rank the health issues); creation of action plan; and monitoring of the action plan.DCHCC, with input from community stakeholders, developed a Community Health Improvement Plan (CHIP) to respond to the findings of the needs assessment. DCHCC conducted a community forum that provided an opportunity for health professionals, public and elected officials, non-profit organizations, academia, businesses, parents and families, and individual citizen-advocates to review the findings from the assessment. Forum participants then assisted with developing and supporting a citywide community health improvement plan that responds to the findings of the assessment.Each DCHCC member organization received approval of the implementation strategy (community health improvement plan) by their Board of Directors/Trustees.

The process also included integrating existing data regarding social, economic, and health indicators in the region with qualitative information. To provide feedback and guidance to Danbury Hospital on the assessment, an advisory committee, the Community Action Planning Steering Committee (CAPSC), was engaged. In place since the 2012 Community Report Card and 2013 CHIP, the group, comprised of approximately 20 individuals from key partner agencies and organizations, was involved to advise on the current process, support data collection, and participate in the development and implementation of programs and policies to address priority issues. Engagement of community members and partners was expanded throughout the project to include over 50 individuals, including representatives from housing, transportation, social services, education, business, local government, and neighboring health departments. CAPSC met as a whole in December 2015, March 2016, and June 2016. These community members agreed to assist in the CHNA. Specifically, the committee was asked to provide existing quantitative and qualitative data; identify additional appropriate secondary data sources; provide input on primary data collection; motivate and recruit community members to participate in the assessment process; provide technical assistance in their areas of expertise; identify priority issues for health improvement; and to develop and implement programs and policies to address priority issues. The United Way of Western Connecticut shared the ALICE (Asset Limited, Income Constrained, Employed) Community Conversations and Survey 2015 Summary report, the Regional YMCA of Western Connecticut provided their 2016 Online CHNA Summary report, and the Pomperaug Health District provided their Community Survey results. Information from these sources was reviewed and incorporated into the community health needs assessment. Throughout the process, information was provided to all CAPSC members through email allowing participants to be informed on the progress of the project and the opportunities to share their expertise. Another qualitative data tool, online key informant surveys (KIS) were developed and sent via email to 200 community leaders in the Greater Danbury Region; including elected officials, social service organizations, schools, libraries, housing, police, and community health agencies. The survey was designed to better understand the health needs of the Greater Danbury region and included questions on community health initiatives, strengths and challenges, health concerns and limitations, and vulnerable populations. A 21% participation rate was achieved. A follow-up CAPSC Forum was held in August 2016 and preliminary findings were shared with this group. Key themes that emerged across all groups were identified, as well as unique issues that were noted for specific populations. While community differences are noted where appropriate, analyses emphasized findings common across the Greater Danbury Area. The group then completed a ranking voting exercise to determine health priorities, and identify resources needed for the Community Health Improvement Plan (CHIP) process.

The survey was offered in Spanish and English. 65 individuals completed the survey in Spanish and 694 completed the survey in English. Individuals were invited to participate based on their ability to represent: underserved, low-income and minority population needs; needs of chronically ill patients; and awareness of healthcare needs in their respective communities. Participants were asked to share their viewpoints on: Important health concerns in the community; Significant service gaps in the community; Ideas for addressing concerns and service gaps.To gauge the importance of various health concerns, respondents were asked to ""Choose the top 5 priorities you think should be addressed in your community"" from a list of 34 health concerns. Respondents were then asked to rate their overall health, the health of the community, and the quality of life of the community. Other questions included reviewing lists of services typically important to addressing health concerns and how strong the community was in providing those services. Respondents were then asked to indicate services that needed to be strengthened in terms of availability, access, and quality. Open-ended response items were provided for participants to indicate additional service gaps in the community and ideas for addressing concerns and service gaps. Community ConversationsFive Community Conversations were held as part of the CHNA process in which 78 individuals participated from all of the core jurisdictions of Hanover, Henrico, Chesterfield, and Richmond City. Overall, the racial and geographical diversity of the participants represented a healthy mix of the region's residents. The purpose of the conversation was to elicit feedback from community members about publicly available health data describing health conditions in the services area, and to review the online survey results to further explore findings. Attendees were asked to 1) rank the health issues identified in the Community Survey according to the issues that impact them and the people close to them the most and 2) rank the issues needing to be addressed to improve the overall health of the region from a community view.Priority Needs Bon Secours Richmond convened a CHNA Advisory Board to support the process by engaging community members and providing feedback on the findings. The CHNA Advisory Board included individuals with special knowledge of public health and underserved populations and included the following: Directors from the Richmond City Health Department and the Chickahominy Health District, an Executive Director of a Free Clinic, a Vice President from VCU Health, Vice Presidents from the Better Housing Coalition and United Methodist Family Services, and the Executive Director of the Richmond Academy of Medicine. A group conversation was facilitated by Becky Clay Christensen and included a review of all qualitative and quantitative data gather from the Community Survey, Community Conversations, and publicly available secondary health data. Advisory Board members were asked to categorize issues as high or low need in the community using a Strategy Grid. They were also asked to determine the feasibility of the community's ability to make an impact on the issues."

Goals and objectives were created for each area and were based on Healthy People 2020 objectives, Virginia's Plan for Well-Being 2016-2020 goals, and other evidence-based sources.The overarching goal for Access to Care for the Uninsured with Chronic Disease is to improve access to high quality health care services. This will be achieved in part by supporting the many community partners who work with the uninsured population to include: the Free Clinic Network, the Capital Region Collaborative, and the two other hospital systems in the region. Additionally, Bon Secours will provide services to the uninsured through the Care-A-Van, St. Joseph's Outreach Clinic, and the Community Nutrition program. Partnerships to achieve this objective include Churches, nutrition and healthy food providers, St. Joseph's Villa and The Daily Planet (FQHC).The goal in addressing Mental Health is to improve mental health status by ensuring access to appropriate, quality mental health services. We aim to achieve this by increasing the proportion of people who receive appropriate treatment for mental health disorders. Increasing the use of depression screenings and integrating behavioral health with primary care are two strategies to impact this goal. Partners in this work include The Daily Planet, the National Alliance on Mental Health, United Methodist Family Services, Childsavers, Stop Child Abuse Now, and the Bon Secours Bereavement Center. Additionally, Henrico Area Mental Health and Development Services, Chesterfield Department of Mental Health Support Services, the City of Richmond Department of Health, and the two other health systems in the region will be influential partners to impact Mental Health.Transportation will be addressed by increasing safe, healthy, and reliable transportation options for residents in the Richmond service area. Bon Secours will promote active transportation through advocacy for and provision of place making in the neighborhoods we serve. Additionally, we will be an advocate for the expansion of public transportation options to increase access for those in underserved areas and improve ridership through a community-based design. Place making activities include opening the Sarah Garland Jones Center for Health Communities and a local market with fresh produce in the East End of Richmond. Additionally, advocacy efforts will include the expansion of safe walking and biking opportunities and the redesign of the public bus system to ensure timely access for all those we serve. Bon Secours will also provide transportation to and from Richmond Community Hospital.The goal for Education is to promote student success in schools to improve health and quality of life for the Richmond community and future generations. Our efforts will focus on kindergarten readiness, 3rd grade SOL reading test scores, and high school graduation rates. The Care-A-Van will provide no cost vaccines and school physicals to children to ensure school readiness as well as enroll eligible children in FAMIS Medicaid. Partners to support this work include, Commonwealth Parenting, Excel VCU, Faison School for Autism, Friends Association, Richmond Cycling Corps, First Things First, Reach Out and Read, Sacred Heart Center, Virginia Literacy Foundation, YMCA, YWCA, Peter Paul Development Center, Armstrong Priorities Freshman Academy, Anna Julie Cooper School, Church Hill Activities and Tutoring, Great Aspirations Scholarship Program, United Way, Higher Achievement, Salvation Army Boys and Girls Club, and many others providing direct education and workforce readiness training.Needs Not AddressedAccess to care for Medicaid and Medicare beneficiaries, adult and childhood obesity, jobs with fair wages, families living in poverty and seniors were identified as high needs in the community. The CHNA Advisory Board also identified these needs as having high feasibility meaning there was sufficient community support to make an impact.During the Community Conversations, older adults with Medicare shared they had challenges finding community physicians who accepted Medicare patients. This is being addressed by Bon Secours Richmond Health System that includes Bon Secours Medical Group and VCU Health in that they accept Medicaid and Medicare patients.Adult and childhood obesity are being addressed in the community by multiple organizations including Active RVA, City of Richmond's Corner Store initiative, Faces of Hope, Fit 4 Kids, the Seventh District Health and Wellness Initiative, Shalom Farms, Sports Backers/Richmond Strikers, Tricycle Gardens, Virginia Recreation and Parks and the YMCA.Jobs with Fair Wages is being addressed by the City of Richmond Community Wealth Building, Goodwill, Richmond Technical Center, Chesterfield Career and Technical Center, The Hanover Center for Trades and Technology, Henrico County Public Schools Career and Technical Education, United Way of Greater Richmond & Petersburg.A family living in poverty is a multi-factorial issue which may be impacted through enhanced education and transportation, both areas of focus for the 2016 CHNA.

Publicity, websites, and emails invited the public to take the survey any time before December 20, 2015. Paper surveys were available at the hospitals and clinics, the local food bank and other non-profit agencies. Information on how to access the link for the online survey was promoted heavily and emailed to internal and external audiences. The partners received nearly 600 electronic and paper surveys with additional efforts made to ensure a cross-section of residents completed the survey. Additionally, one-on-one interviews were conducted with local organizations and businesses (listed below) to better understand the populations they serve, and the health needs of their clients and/or employees. This information was compared to existing secondary data, including a 2015 health assessment completed by Black Hawk County Health Department.

The following summarizes how the hospital addressed priority health needs in the community. Access and Education o Coordinated a Medical Leaders Program again in FY17 for Hoover Junior High to provide hands-on real life learning experiences to provide an interactive learning forum to generate interest in health care careers. o Continued our partnership with the Ethnic Minorities of Burma Advocacy and Resource Center (EMBARC) on the Community Navigator Program with Burma Refugees to enhance access and education on how to navigate the health system, when to use the emergency department or convenient care, how to properly store food, dental hygiene, etc. o Med School is a spring break educational program designed to give Burma youth the opportunity to learn o Covenant's Pediatric department launched a Reach Out and Read program to promote early childhood literacy. o Sent associates to be trained on Mental Health First Aid, who have then educated staff and community at local schools and churches to better arm residents on how to identify signs of mental health issues. o Opened a Covenant Clinic Family Medicine location on Franklin Street and continually hire primary care providers. Health Behaviors & Community Wellness (Obesity & Physical Inactivity) o CMC partnered with community organizations to support the Mayor's Fun Run where 800 fourth graders in the Waterloo School District participate in this event by running alongside the Mayor of Waterloo in the downtown area. o CMC partnered with the city of Waterloo and Blue Zones to secure a $445,000 grant to support childhood obesity prevention programs. Because of this partnership, CMC received more than $43,000 to continue to offer a Fruit and Vegetable Voucher Program (FVVP) in its pediatric office so families could meet with a dietician and access vouchers to redeem at local farmers' markets. Mental Health Services & Education o CMC collaborated with several community agencies including Cedar Valley United Way, and the Waterloo Human Rights Commission to address the critical issues surrounding mental health, working together to advance mental health programs and services. Multiple strategies and tactics are identified, defined and will be implemented in the coming years. Cardiovascular Disease o Sponsored the American Heart Association's Heart Walk in May 2017 providing heart education, interactive activities, etc. Cancer o CMC's accredited breast center and the Covenant Cancer Treatment Center (CCTC) collaborated to offer cancer prevention education through 20 community events and conferences. o CMC collaborated with the Black Hawk County Tobacco and Clean Air Coalition and financially supported the creation and dissemination of Quit Kits to promote online counseling and free nicotine replacement therapy through Quit Line Iowa. The partnership also provided ""Ask, Assess, Refer"" (2As/R) training to more than 250 health care professionals at CMC and Sartori. Maternal, Infant, and Child Health o Covenant Midwives and Womens Health Center (CMWHC) offered a Centering Pregnancy Program, a best-practice model of health care and support to pregnant women including an individual prenatal health check-up, and time for group education and sharing. It allows pregnant women with similar due dates to gather and bond while experiencing the uniqueness of their pregnancies together. Although progress was achieved, CMC will remain focused on the same key findings with its partners. These will include: Access and Education; Healthy Behaviors and Community Wellness; Mental Health Services and Education, Cardiovascular Disease, Cancer and Mental, Infant and Child Health. Based on the CHNA completed in June 2016, the hospital developed and adopted a three-year Implementation Strategy to address the same priority community health needs. The following summarizes how the hospital will address the priority health needs in the June 2016 Implementation Strategy: Expand Access o Continue to recruit primary care providers o Provide womens health education, specifically to expectant mothers o Expand clinic access in rural or low income areas o Continue partnerships that help the low income population understand health care systems (access, etc.) Healthy Behaviors and Community Wellness o Improve access to healthy food, diabetes education, etc. o Provide screenings and education at community events o Partner with local government, organizations and the school system to create awareness and impact change. o Continue education and advocacy efforts related to tobacco use o Participate in educational programs centered on the effects of alcohol/drug abuse Mental Health o Continue our partnership with community leaders to develop strategies to improve local care o Promote and educate residents on the benefits of a nutritious diet and exercise to improve mental health Cardiovascular o Maximize the American Heart Association Mission: Lifeline program to ensure all emergency medical services that can transmit vital patient information from the field o Participate in the American Heart Associations ACTION Registr"

THE BEEBE CHNA PROCESS FOLLOWED THE FOLLOWING STEPS: STEP 1: PLAN AND PREPARE FOR THE ASSESSMENT STEP 2: DETERMINE THE PURPOSE AND SCOPE OF THE CHNA STEP 3: IDENTIFY DATA THAT DESCRIBES THE HEALTH AND NEEDS OF THE COMMUNITY STEP 4: UNDERSTAND AND INTERPRET THE DATA STEP 5: DEFINE AND VALIDATE PRIORITIES STEP 6: DOCUMENT AND COMMUNICATE RESULTS THE ORGANIZATION FELT IT WAS IMPERATIVE TO COLLECT PRIMARY DATA DUE TO THE LIMITATION OF SERVICING A RELATIVELY RURAL POPULATION NOT WELL CHARACTERIZED BY SOLELY SECONDARY DATA SOURCES. ACCORDING TO THE DELAWARE HEALTH TRACKER, INACCURATE DATA ON THE POPULATION AT RISK IN SMALL GEOGRAPHIC AREAS CONTINUES TO COMPLICATE EPIDEMIOLOGIC STUDIES IN COMMUNITY SETTINGS. CENSUS DATA ARE LESS ACCURATE FOR CITIES OR COUNTIES THAN FOR STATES. THEREFORE, AN IDEAL APPROACH INCORPORATES BOTH PRIMARY AND SECONDARY DATA. IN ORDER TO FULLY INCORPORATE THE PRIMARY DATA ELEMENTS, THE CHNA TEAM CONDUCTED FOCUS GROUPS, TOWN HALL MEETINGS, STAKEHOLDER INTERVIEWS, AND ONLINE SURVEYS. BY GATHERING INFORMATION FROM LOCAL RESIDENTS AND AREA ORGANIZATIONS, THE ORGANIZATION HOPES TO GAIN A BETTER INSIGHT TO THE PRIORITY NEEDS OF THOSE LIVING IN THE SERVICE AREA. ADDITIONAL DATA WAS ALSO COLLECTED THROUGH COMPLETION OF A COMMUNITY HEALTH SURVEY BY AREA RESIDENTS, COMMUNITY BASED ORGANIZATIONS AND HEALTH CARE PROVIDERS. IN 2015, WITH THE HELP OF THE DELAWARE DIVISION OF SOCIAL SERVICES MOBILE CRISIS UNIT, A PORTION OF THE SUSSEX COUNTY HOMELESS POPULATION WAS SURVEYED AT THE LOCAL HOMELESS SHELTERS. LASTLY, KEY INFORMANT INTERVIEWS WERE COMPLETED WITH COMMUNITY STAKE HOLDERS. BEEBES POPULATION HEALTH DEPARTMENT STAFF ORGANIZED AND ANALYZED THE DATA, AND WAS RESPONSIBLE FOR COLLECTING CURRENT DEMOGRAPHIC INFORMATION FROM THE DELAWARE POPULATION CONSORTIUM, U.S. CENSUS BUREAU, THE DELAWARE HOSPITAL ASSOCIATION, AND THE DELAWARE HEALTH TRACKER. STAFF ALSO CONDUCTED A COMMUNITY ASSETS AND RESOURCE ANALYSIS, WHICH WAS INCLUDED IN THE OVERALL ASSESSMENT AND RATIONALE FOR PRIORITIZED COMMUNITY NEEDS. THE FINAL PRODUCT OF THE COMMUNITY HEALTH NEEDS ASSESSMENT REFLECTS THE PRIMARY DATA COLLECTED VIA SURVEYS AND ANALYZED FOR SIGNIFICANCE, IN CONJUNCTION WITH THE SECONDARY DATA OBTAINED FROM RESOURCES SUCH AS THE DELAWARE HEALTH TRACKER WHICH HOUSES ALL OF THE AVAILABLE NATIONAL DATA SOURCES. ONCE THIS INFORMATION WAS SYNTHESIZED, THE BEEBE POPULATION AND COMMUNITY HEALTH COMMITTEE EVALUATED THE RESULTS OF THE DATA COLLECTION AND ANALYSIS USING THE PRINCIPLES OF THE ROBERT WOOD JOHNSON FOUNDATION COUNTY HEALTH RANKINGS MODEL, EMPHASIZING THE VARIED AND VAST DETERMINANTS OF HEALTH.

Other institutions, organizations and agencies as well as members of the Children's Hospital Community Benefit Advisory Committee also contributed time and resources to assist with this assessment.The CNM team has extensive experience through being involved in and conducting more than 30 CHNA's for hospitals throughout Los Angeles County and San Diego County. In 2013, CNM conducted CHNA's for three Kaiser Foundation Hospitals (Baldwin Park, Los Angeles and West Los Angeles),Citrus Valley Health Partners, The Glendale Hospitals Collaborative (Glendale Adventist Medical Center, Glendale Memorial Hospital and US Verdugo Hills Hospital) and the Metro Hospitals Collaborative (California Hospital Medical Center, Good Samaritan Hospital and St. Vincent Medical Center) and assisted an additional two Kaiser Foundation Hospitals (Panorama City and San Diego) in community benefit planning based on the needs assessments. More recently, the CNM team conducted the 2014 CHNA for CASA Colina Hospital and Centers for Healthcare, and for Hope Street Family Center. The CNM team is currently in various stages of conducting 2016 CHNAs for two Kaiser Foundation Hospitals (West Los Angeles and Baldwin Park), Citrus Valley Health Partners, The Glendale Hospitals Collaborative and The Metro Hospitals Collaborative.CHLA has conducted a Community Health Needs Assessment (CHNA) in an effort to understand the health and social needs of the community and as required by state and federal law. The CHNA is a primary tool used by the Hospital to determine its community benefit plan. This assessment incorporates components of primary data collection and secondary data analysis that focus on the health and social needs of the service area. Sources of data include the U.S. Census 2010 Decennial Census and American Community Survey, California Health Interview Survey, California Department ofPublic Health, California Employment Development Department, Los Angeles County Health Survey, Los Angeles Homeless Services Authority, CDC National Health Statistics, National Cancer Institute, U.S. Department of Education, and others. When pertinent, these data sets are presented in the context of California State. The 2016 Community Health Needs Assessment methodology and process involved the collection of both secondary data and primary data. Approximately 300 secondary data indicators on a variety of health, social, economic, and environmental topics were collected by zip code, service planning area (spa), county, and state levels (as available). In addition, primary data collection included an online survey, a youth-led photovoice project and a community forum with individuals who represent the broad interests of the community served by the Hospital. Additionally, input was obtained from Los Angeles County Department of Public Health Officials. For the community forum, community stakeholders identified by key departments at Children's Hospital Los Angeles were contacted andasked to participate in the prioritization of needs process. Participants included individuals who are leaders and representatives of medically underserved, low-income, minority and chronic disease populations, or regional, state or local health or other departments or agencies that have current data or other information relevant to the health needs of the community served by the hospital facility."

It has been estimated that less than a third of our health is influenced by our genetics or biology. Our health is largely determined by the social, economic, cultural, and physical environments that we live in and healthcare we receive.The hospital facility anticipates health needs and available resources may change, therefore, a flexible approach was adopted in the development of its implementation strategy. For example, certain community health needs may become more pronounced and require changes to the initiatives identified by the hospital in the Strategy. Other community organizations may address certain needs, indicating that the hospital's strategies should be refocused on alternative community health needs or assume a different focus on the needs identified in the 2016 CHNA.Hospital resource inputs that will help address priority health needs include, Community Benefits Investments, Community Relations Investments, Better Together Grant Program, hospital-based community benefits activities, external grants received by hospital, and other hospital-based program/services.The hospital facility views a community benefits implementation strategy as a ""LIVING"" document. Due to the evolving climate in health care, the hospital's financial health year to year remains unknown; therefore hospital resources and inputs may increase, decrease, or need to be modified. The hospital's implementation strategy work plan provides an opportunity for the hospital to be strategic and focused, yet flexible in its community health planning and improvement efforts. The hospital facility, in partnership with its Community Benefits Advisory Council updates the work plan with annual outputs and outcomes for each input and activity.No health care system or hospital facility can address all the health needs present in its community. The hospital facility is committed to adhering to its mission and remaining financially healthy so that it can continue to enhance its clinical excellence and patient experience, as well as continue community health planning and improvement efforts. The hospital facility's implementation strategy does not explicitly address all the priority community health needs identified in the 2016 CHNA due to; 1. the hospital's limited resources (time, talent and financial), 2. other hospitals or community organizations within service area are addressing the need; 3. the need falls outside of the hospitals' mission or limited resource capacity. However, many, if not all of the CHNA priority health needs will be addressed INDIRECTLY by the hospital and/or community partners through existing community health planning and improvement efforts.Needs being addressed by the hospital include, basic needs (such as housing), care coordination, community safety, cultural humility, health equity, institutional racism, insurance challenges, limited availability of providers, maternal/infant/child health, mental health and substance use disorders, physical activity and healthy diet, and transportation. Needs not directly being addressed the hospital include, chronic health conditions, environmental concerns, food deserts/insecurity, health literacy, and sexual health."

As a result, GPHCs data collection and analysis contributed to the CHNAs of four health systems (WellStar Health System, Grady Health System, Kaiser Permanente, and Piedmont Healthcare), a health plan and an urban county health department.

This varied approach from the individual 2013 CHNA reports and implementation strategies is attributed to WellStars System-wide delivery system of community benefit services and the ability to best leverage its economies of scale and services to address the prioritized health needs of the community, especially the most vulnerable. For the WellStar hospitals and its collaborative community partners, the joint approach to addressing priority health needs maximizes resources to enhance care access, strengthens partnerships for shared responsibility and helps improve overall community health.

Due to hospital and community collaboration, the information and implementation strategy were basically the same for each hospital to be delivered and lead at the System-level.) (1) The joint WellStar legacy hospital CHNA report meets the requirements of paragraph (b)(6)(i) of this section. WellStars five legacy hospitals collaborated in conducting the 2015 CHNA, and, for specified quantitative and qualitative data, other hospital systems including Kaiser Permanente, Piedmont and Grady. Guided at the System level, WellStar hospitals solicited the help of state and local health departments and key informants to assess the health needs of the community and collaborated in conducting community surveys and hosting listening sessions and focus groups to solicit and receive input from residents, including its medically underserved, low-income, and minority populations. The 2015 CHNA report documents the joint CHNA process and contains all of the elements described in paragraph (b)(6)(i) of the IRSs 501(r) section in the Code of Regulations as it relates to community health needs assessments. The WellStar Health System Board of Trustees adopted the joint CHNA and its implementation strategy on June 2, 2016. (2) The joint CHNA report is clearly identified as applying to the hospital facility. All five WellStar legacy hospitals, WellStar Cobb, Douglas, Kennestone, Paulding, and Windy Hill hospitals, are noted on the cover of the joint CHNA and each hospitals president is listed as members of the WellStar Community Benefit Oversight Committee within the CHNA, along with a hospital-specific profiles and county-specific primary and secondary data and noted in the Tracking Progress section (2015 CHNA, page 62). (3) All of the collaborating hospital facilities and organizations included in the joint CHNA report define their community to be the same. Yes, based upon WellStars: 1. System-based model for delivering most all community benefit services and evaluating its impact (again, to leverage the economies of scale and services to deliver program that address the priority needs) 2. Overlapping hospital 90 percent catchment areas 3. Similar community health needs key findings and themes (access to care and healthy lifestyles prevalence of chronic disease) based upon intensive quantitative and qualitative data and the work of the WellStar Community Health Collaborative task force to identify the priority needs of the overall community (representatives from WellStar services lines, hospitals, departments and the community stakeholders) based on the severity of the need and assets of WellStar and its community stakeholders and partners to address the need."

201821369349300247,582032904,"SCHEDULE H, PART V, SECTION B, LINE 11","PROGRAMS & STRATEGIES TO ADDRESS THE NEEDS OF THE COMMUNITY: WellStar IS implementing two new System-wide WCHC programs, WellStar 4-1 Care Network and Live Well, to address the priority health needs of the 2015 Joint CHNA. The programs are designed to: - Provide organization, framework and leadership to the delivery of community benefit services and enables us to more effectively evaluate and measure the impact on community health - Strengthen WellStars strategic community partnerships in public AND PRIVATE SECTORS THROUGH FORMALIZED ENGAGEMENT AS AS ""PARTNERS IN HEALTH"" LEVERAGING EXPERTISE, RESOURCES AND SERVICES TO COMPLEMENT AND/OR BRIDGE INTERVENTION GAPS AND ADDRESS HEALTH DISPARITIES - Boost WellStars ability to replicate and deliver community benefit services across an expanding health system footprint - Maximize the investment in WellStars safety net clinic/non-profit partners by better aligning our services and resources to address priority health needs - Improve overall community health, especially among the vulnerable. The WellStar 4-1 Care Network and Live Well programs provide organizational structure and accountability to WellStar and its legacy hospitals efforts to reach out to those in need, to improve the health of the communities we serve and to enhance access to care. These efforts flow from the WellStar mission and vision and to meet the requirements of federal government (Affordable Care Act Section 9007) of system-wide oversight and guidance regarding tracking community benefit activities, assessing community health needs and developing strategic plans that prioritize community benefit programming. 1. WellStar 4-1 Care Network: Clinical Care Intervention Program - Priority Need Addressed from the 2015 Joint CHNA: Underuse of Primary Care: includes ED utilization and increased care capacity at community safety net clinics Goals: - Expand the WellStar patient experience to partnering community safety net clinics to reduce health disparities through improved access to volunteer primary care physicians and other specialty medical services to vulnerable populations - Build a cost-efficient model of care - Develop and educate about available health resources and facilities to ""prescribe"" to the medically underserved and uninsured - Decrease ED utilization and readmissions for non-emergent needs to deliver the right care at the right place to the medically underserved and uninsured. THE NAME REFERS TO THE AIM OF THE LOW-COST HEALTHCARE DELIVERY SYSTEM IN THE COMMUNITY TO CARE ""FOR ONE"" ANOTHER BY ADDRESSING THE UNDERUSE OF PRIMARY CARE AND REDUCING ED UTILIZATION AND READMISSIONS FOR NON-EMERGENT ISSUES THAT POTENTIALLY COULD BE TREATED IN AN OUTPATIENT SETTING. It also reflects increasing safety net clinic capacity, education and resources via WellStar Medical Group (WMG) citizenship, with MDs and NPs volunteering four hours one time per month. 2. Live Well: Healthy Behaviors Intervention Program - Priority Health Needs Addressed from the 2015 Joint CHNA: Cancer, Cardiovascular Disease, COPD/Asthma, Obesity, Type 2 Diabetes Goal: - Improve the health of medically underserved and uninsured residents through targeted preventive services, education and outreach. Live Wells targeted outreach to vulnerable populations to address healthy lifestyle-related priority health needs leverages the WellStar 4-1 Care Network partners by delivering health need-specific education, events and preventive screenings on-site and in other high-need site locations. Live Well works in tandem with 4-1 Care and other collaborative partnerships to help reduce the prevalence of chronic disease and its complications through prevention and wellness activities and the promotion of healthy lifestyles. Aligning the resources of the WellStar Community Education & Outreach team, Live Well also will partner with other community groups and organizations proximate to community safety net clinics for volunteerism, health navigation, transportation, and other supportive services. UNADDRESSED CHNA NEEDS - Health needs not identified as priority fall into one of three categories: 1) Beyond the scope of WellStar services, e.g. dental care which is addressed by safety nets clinics 2) Needs further intervention, but no plans for expanding current community benefit services at this time, e.g. maternal/infant health 3) Relying on community partners to lead efforts with expertise in these areas with WellStar in a supportive role, e.g. substance abuse, violence, suicide, STDs, transportation. To identify the six priority health needs WellStars legacy hospitals will address, leaders of Kennesaw State Universitys A.L. Burruss Institute of Public Service & Research were solicited to guide the WellStar Community Health Collaborative task force (made up of WellStar internal team members and community stakeholders) through the prioritization process. Health needs data summaries were advanced ahead of the Health Needs Summit on FebRUARY 25, 2016 for review. From the significant health needs identified by CHNA research conducted in the fall/winter of 2015, the priority health needs were determined via an online survey tool for the community WellStar legacy hospitals serve."

201811359349302371,240795508,The Williamsport Hospital,"Part V, Section B, Line 11: Health needs were identified based on information gathered and analyzed through the 2016 CHNA conducted by the Health System. For the health needs prioritization process, the Health System engaged a hospital leadership team to review the most significant health needs reported the prior CHNA using the following criteria, 1) Current area of hospital focus. 2) Established relationships with community partners to address the health need. 3) Organizational capacity and existing infrastructure to address the health need.Based on the criteria outlined above, the leadership team ranked each of the health needs. As a result of the priority setting process, the identified priority areas that will be addressed through the Health System's Implementation Strategy for fiscal years 2017 through 2019 will be, 1) Substance abuse 2) Lack of mental health services 3) Heart disease 4) Financial barriers/poverty/low socioeconomic 5) Cancer 6) Lack of preventative care 7) Lack of health knowledge/education 8) Obesity 9) Lack of primary care physicians.The Health System's next step included developing an Implementation Strategy to address these priority areas which can be found at www.upmcsusquehanna.org/communityhealth.In some cases the hospital does not have the resources and specialty staff that would be required to adequately address all the identified needs. In other words, there may already be other agencies and healthcare providers working to effect change in these areas by providing related community resources and services. For more detailed discussion regarding identified health needs you may view the CHNA and related implementation strategy at www.upmcsusquehanna.org/communityhealth.To date, our progress on the implementation strategies are as follows: (1) Improve access to primary / specialty services and programs available within Lycoming County. Implementing longer office hours, walk-in access and 24/7 to nurse triage and ability to make an appointment in primary care; improve acess to specialty service lines (i.e. Cancer, Heart, Ortho, GI....); working with various organizations to establish a more robust way to connect the community to services within the county and wellness fairs available. (2) Continue to partner in the fight against opiate addiction and support local services/task forces. Authorize implementation of prescription drug monitoring program system wide; access to certified recovery specialist for all Susquehanna Emergency departments; collaborate with organizations to help educate the community. (3) Collaborate with community organizations on health and wellness initiatives, such as routine wellness check-ups and cancer screenings. Promote routine cancer screenings for breast, colon and lung cancer; Susquehanna signed the 80% by 2018 initiative to have 80% of individuals ages 50 or older screened for colon cancer in Lycoming County; continue to partner with River Valley Regional YMCA to suport health and wellness programs for both children and adults; continue to grow and expand the Spirit of Women programs. (4) Support mental health services; Have licensed clinical socal workers available at all primary care offices; ease access into behavioral health specialists. (5) Support transportation options to healthcare for rural areas; establish a stronger connection to STEP; bring wellness clinics to rural area."

NEEDS ARE BEING ADDRESSED THROUGH A HOSPITAL-WIDE INTERNAL COMMITTEE, FUNDING TO EXTERNAL ORGANIZATIONS ENGAGED IN SELECTED PRIORITY NEEDS, COLLABORATION ON COMMUNITY WIDE COALITIONS AND INITIATIVES, ONGOING PROGRAMS THAT ADDRESS NEEDS, AND INTERNAL STRATEGIC ALIGNMENT. TWO COMMUNITY NEEDS WERE IDENTIFIED IN THE 2016 ASSESSMENT THAT WERE NOT INCLUDED IN THE IMPLEMENTATION STRATEGY: ECONOMIC OPPORTUNITIES AND SEXUALLY TRANSMITTED INFECTIONS AND TEEN BIRTHS. ALTHOUGH UVM MEDICAL CENTER'S ROLE AS A MAJOR ECONOMIC ENGINE WITHIN THE COMMUNITY IS ACKNOWLEDGED, THE STEERING COMMITTEE DECIDED THAT THE MEDICAL CENTER COULD MORE EFFECTIVELY LEAD THE FOCUS ON OTHER HEALTH-RELATED IDENTIFIED NEEDS. AS FOR STIS AND TEEN BIRTHS, THE GROUP AGREED THAT ALTHOUGH THE TREND IS MOVING IN A NEGATIVE DIRECTION, IT REPRESENTS A SMALL PERCENTAGE OF THE POPULATION AND OTHERS IN THE COMMUNITY ARE ADDRESSSING THIS NEED.

201822229349300942,410682405,Betty Ford Center,"Part V, Section B, Line 11: The CHNA identified gaps in services that Betty Ford Center is able to provide. The strategies for addressing these gaps are detailed within the implementation plan. The gaps to be addressed include the following:-Expanding services to treat addiction in individuals aged 55 and older;-Establishing additional outpatient treatment facilities within the service area-Offering children's services to the community-Presenting education on addiction, treatment, and recovery-Providing training on marijuana and options for prevention, intervention, and treatment; and-Addressing the opioid epidemic in the State of California through advocacy, prevention, education, and treatmentThe strategy to expand services to those age 55 and older calls for the development and implementation of a business plan to expand services for older adults through the ""Recovery@60Plus Program."" The second strategy being considered is the collaboration with senior housing communities and/or agencies in and around Betty Ford Center to enchance awareness of the signs and symptoms of prescription drug addiction and alcoholism.In addressing the needs of additional outpatient service facilities within the service area, Betty Ford Center opened a outpatient facility in the San Diego area and will continue to assess the need for outpatient services in the area.The next area of significant need is the offering of children's services to the community. The strategy is to collaborate with schools and school districts in the service area to reach more students. Staff of the Children's Program participated in the Red Ribbon Campaign at numerous schools in California, Texas and Colorado. Early prevention education and recovery awareness events were held in communities and schools, along with training sessions for school administrators, principlas, counselors and teachers to provide information, resources and tools regarding the family disease of addiction. The training session, called Tools for the Journey, is also open to therapists, counselors, non-profits and other organizations that work with children. The other tactic is to expand opportunities for impacted children to attend Children's Progams through scholarship programs. The Children's Program is funded entirely through donor support.The fourth priority is to educate the community on addiction, treatment, and recovery which is a three pronged plan:-Expand the community service programming for both the surrounding outreach and online communities by sponsoring 6-8 Awareness Hour programs per year on various topics as they relate to addiction.-Feature internal and external experts in their field as speakers; and-Provide educational materials and online resources for all individuals.The next priority is to provide training and education on marijuana and options for prevention, intervention and treatment which will be accomplished by serving as a resource and promoting materials being developed by the wider Hazelden Betty Ford Foundation for different audiences to better understand and address the use and legalization of marijuana. The organization will also facilitate ""thought leaders"" to provide education on marijuana, its medical uses, and options for prevention, intervention, and treatment.The final priority is to address the opioid epidemic in State of California. This will be accomplished by providing broad-based advocacy efforts and community education to address the opioid crisis. The organization will mobilize the local communities on prevention, intervention, and referral to treatment strategies to impact the opioid epidemic. Education will also be provided on both the community and professional level about the proven track record of the evidence-based Comprehensive Opioid Response with Twelve Steps treament protocol along with training for other treatment providers."

EVIDENCE BASED INTERVENTIONS ARE UTILIZED THROUGHOUT THE PLAN WITH SPECIFIC DATA RESOURCES THAT WILL BE TRACKED. IT SHOULD BE NOTED THAT THIS IS A THREE YEAR PLAN. WHILE THE GOALS, OBJECTIVES, AND STRATEGIES ARE LONG TERM, THE ACTIVITIES ARE PRIMARILY FOCUSED FOR THE FIRST YEAR. EACH YEAR, THE ACTIVITIES WILL BE EVALUATED AND ADJUSTED AS NEEDED. SOME OF THE ACTIVITIES COULD ROLL OVER AND REMAIN THE SAME, BE CHANGED SLIGHTLY, OR BE ADJUSTED ENTIRELY IF IT IS DETERMINED THEY ARE NOT MOVING US TOWARDS OUR GOALS AND OBJECTIVES. HEALTH PRIORITY 1: PREVENT CHRONIC DISEASETHE PURPOSE OF THIS PRIORITY IS TO ASSIST NYS IN ADDRESSING CHRONIC DISEASES AND THEIR CAUSES TO EFFECTIVELY STEM THE TIDE OF ESCALATING HEALTH CARE COSTS AND ENSURE THAT NEW YORKERS LEAD HEALTHY AND PRODUCTIVE LIVES. CHRONIC DISEASES SUCH AS CANCER, DIABETES, HEART DISEASE, STROKE AND ASTHMA ARE CONDITIONS OF LONG DURATION AND GENERALLY SLOW PROGRESSION. THEY ARE AMONG THE MOST PREVENTABLE OF ALL DISEASES. THREE MODIFIABLE RISK BEHAVIORS - LACK OF PHYSICAL ACTIVITY, UNHEALTHY NUTRITION, AND TOBACCO USE - ARE LARGELY RESPONSIBLE FOR THE INCIDENCE, SEVERITY AND ADVERSE OUTCOMES OF CHRONIC DISEASE.THE NEW YORK STATE PREVENTION AGENDA PLACES EMPHASIS ON THREE KEY AREAS IN REGARDS TO PREVENTING CHRONIC DISEASE: 1) HEALTH PROMOTION ACTIVITIES TO ENCOURAGE HEALTHY LIVING AND LIMIT THE ONSET OF CHRONIC DISEASES; 2) EARLY DETECTION OPPORTUNITIES THAT INCLUDE SCREENING POPULATIONS AT RISK; AND 3) SUCCESSFUL MANAGEMENT STRATEGIES FOR EXISTING DISEASES AND RELATED COMPLICATIONS.FOCUS AREA 1: REDUCE OBESITY IN CHILDREN AND ADULTSTHE GOAL AROUND THIS FOCUS AREA IS CREATING COMMUNITY ENVIRONMENTS THAT PROMOTE AND SUPPORT HEALTHY FOOD AND BEVERAGE CHOICES AND PHYSICAL ACTIVITY. THE TWO EVIDENCE BASED LONG TERM OBJECTIVES CHOSEN ARE AROUND DECREASING THE PERCENTAGE OF CLINTON COUNTY ADULTS WHO REPORT PARTICIPATING IN NO LEISURE TIME ACTIVITY AND INCREASE THE PERCENTAGE OF CLINTON COUNTY ADULTS REPORTING ADEQUATE DAILY FRUIT AND VEGETABLE CONSUMPTION. THE FOLLOWING STATISTICS/INFORMATION WERE USED AS SUPPORT AND RATIONALE IN THE SELECTION OF THIS AS A PRIORITY:- 26.8% OF ADULTS IN CLINTON COUNTY ARE OBESE, COMPARED TO 24.6% IN NYS. THE PREVENTION AGENDA GOAL FOR 2013-2018 IS 23.2% (HEALTHYADK)- 64.0% OF ADULTS IN CLINTON COUNTY ARE OVERWEIGHT OR OBESE, COMPARED TO 60.5% IN NYS (HEALTHYADK)- 37.5% OF ELEMENTARY STUDENTS IN CLINTON COUNTY ARE OVERWEIGHT OR OBESE, COMPARED TO 33.1% IN NYS. THIS HAS GOTTEN 0.2% WORSE IN THE LATEST MEASUREMENT PERIOD (HEALTHYADK)- 41.6% OF MIDDLE AND HIGH SCHOOL STUDENTS IN CLINTON COUNTY ARE OVERWEIGHT OR OBESE. ONLY 35.2% ARE IN THIS CATEGORY FOR NYS (HEALTHYADK)- ONLY 66.8% OF ADULTS IN CLINTON COUNTY HAVE ACCESS TO EXERCISE OPPORTUNITIES, WHILE 90.7% OF ADULTS IN NYS DO (HEALTHYADK) OF THE SUBCATEGORIES UNDER PREVENTING CHRONIC DISEASE, 53% OF SURVEY RESPONDENTS SELECTED THIS FOCUS AREA REDUCE OBESITY IN CHILDREN AND ADULTS).THERE ARE SEVERAL STRATEGIES CVPH AND CCHD WILL BE UTILIZING TO ADDRESS THIS FOCUS AREA AND ACHIEVE THE GOAL AND OBJECTIVES. THEY ARE AS FOLLOWS:- CONDUCT GENERAL EDUCATION FOR HEALTH PROFESSIONALS ON DIET AND EXERCISE WITH A FOCUS ON THE DEVELOPMENT OF A PROGRAM TARGETING NURSES IN CONJUNCTION WITH THE MAGNET APPLICATION PROCESS TO FOCUS ON DIET, EXERCISE, STRESS, COPING, OBESITY AND DISABILITIES. CURRENTLY, THERE ARE NO PROGRAMS LIKE THIS OCCURRING, BUT THE HOPE IS TO COMPLETE ONE PROGRAM PER YEAR AT CVPH WITH THE OPPORTUNITY TO OPEN THIS UP TO NURSES AT THE CCHD.- IMPLEMENTATION OF PROGRAMS TO INCREASE ACCESS TO LEISURE TIME ACTIVITIES FOR MEMBERS OF THE COMMUNITY WITH A FOCUS ON CONTINUATION OF YEAR TWO OF THE FITNESS IN THE PARKS GRANT. SIGNIFICANT PROGRESS HAS BEEN MADE IN YEAR ONE AND THE FOCUS OF YEAR TWO WILL BE AROUND SOCCER GOLF, PICKLE BALL, AND TRANSITIONING OF FITNESS IN PARKS TO THE TOWNS. CVPH WILL WORK TO MAKE TRAIL MAPS PROVIDED BY CCHD AVAILABLE IN HOSPITAL LOCATIONS. THE CCHD WILL FINALIZE ENHANCEMENTS TO ONE ADDITIONAL RECREATIONAL SPACE TO SUPPORT ACTIVITY AS WELL AS FACILITATE COMMUNITY ENTITIES TO SUBMIT PROJECTS TO THE HEALTH FOUNDATION'S MATCHING FUNDS PROGRAM. - CONTINUATION AND EXPANSION OF THE DIABETES PROGRAM WHICH CVPH HAS IMPLEMENTED AND SEEN SIGNIFICANT SUCCESS WITH.- CONTINUED USAGE OF HEALTHY MEAL AND BEVERAGE STANDARDS FOR MEALS SOLD AND SERVED IN THE HOSPITAL WITH A FOCUS ON USING HEALTHY, LOCALLY GROWN FOODS IN THE CAFETERIA AND PATIENT MEALS. THIS WILL FOCUS ON A REGULAR REVIEW OF MENUS, NO SUGAR ADDED OPTIONS, AND INCLUSION OF NUTRITIONALS ON FOOD TO EMPOWER EMPLOYEES AND PATIENTS TO TAKE CONTROL OF THEIR FOOD CHOICES. - EXPAND PARTICIPATION IN LOCAL BETTER CHOICES CERTIFICATION PROGRAM BY RECRUITING AND PROMOTING LOCALLY OWNED RESTAURANTS TO PARTICIPATE IN SEVERAL PROGRAMS. - SUPPORT AND PROMOTE USE OF LOCALLY GROWN FRUITS AND VEGETABLES THROUGHOUT THE CLINTON COUNTY FOOD ENVIRONMENT BY WORKING WITH LOCAL FARMS, INSTITUTE ENVIRONMENTAL CHANGES AT LOCAL FOOD PANTIES, AND DESIGNING AND LAUNCHING A TARGETED MEDIA CAMPAIGN AIMED AT INCREASING DONATIONS TO FOOD PANTRIES. THERE IS SIGNIFICANT OPPORTUNITY TO PROVIDE THIS SUPPORT AND PROMOTION THROUGH THE CVPH MALNUTRITION PROGRAM.CONTINUED ON SCHEDULE O"

201842269349301844,610444716,Ashland Hospital Corporation,"Part V, Section B, Line 11: In 2016, KDMC conducted a CHNA, through which six primary needs were identified - substance abuse, obesity, access to care, poverty/unemployment, diabetes, and hypertension. The medical center developed an Implementation Plan, which covers three years, to address these needs. Each need was addressed using multiple approaches, as follows:Substance abuse: Several programs were offered to tackle substance abuse, including tobacco education in local schools and offering tobacco cessation for patients and community members. Through partnerships, the medical center held three programs to directly impact abuse of illicit substances. Two of these educational programs provided training for social workers, case managers, and others who work with individuals abusing drugs to help improve their knowledge and create a better referral system. In addition, a youth summit was held to educate young people about substance abuse. The medical center also reclassified four beds in the behavioral medicine nursing unit for detox patients. Safe medication take-back programs were also implemented through community events and fixed site drop-offs at KDMC family pharmacies.Obesity: As part of tackling the issue of obesity, the medical center chose to address nutrition, physical activity, and BMI. With a focus on healthy eating, KDMC provided nutrition education for students in area schools. Wellness programs were provided for school staff which included a healthy living challenge. At community events, KDMC staff provided nutrition education. Special events held included nutrition education and healthy cooking demonstrations. In addition, KDMC helped meet the needs of vulnerable populations through sponsorship of the Meals-on-Wheels program, helping collect food for the local food pantry through the Food Feud and sponsoring a Farmer's Market on campus which is located in a healthy food desert. To address physical activity, KDMC sponsored four events that included physical activity and education encouraging people to be physically active. Through the electronic medical record, primary care providers now include BMI as part of the patient assessment. Wellness programs also include BMI assessment as part of their programming.Access to Care: To improve access to care, KDMC established school-based clinics in four school districts in the service area. A 24/7 Care line was created to help community members reach a nurse to answer questions about their health or aid them in getting an appointment or with prescription medications. KDMC also expanded access to primary care, pediatric care, urgent care, and walk-in clinics, which has improved how quickly appointments can be provided. Through mobile services, KDMC takes mammography and cardiac screenings into areas of the region that have limited healthcare services. In addition, KDMC offers low-cost blood profiles and vascular screenings throughout the region to offer affordable options in convenient locations. Poverty/Unemployment: Poverty and unemployment are tough issues to tackle for a single organization. KDMC chose to work with area partners and provide staff at career fairs and as speakers on healthcare careers at local colleges/universities, technical schools, and high schools. In addition, through donations from KDMC, Ashland Independent School was able to expand its health careers classes from one to four career paths. Diabetes: During the fiscal year, KDMC staff conducted an evaluation for the need to do diabetes education and testing in area schools. A plan is under development to address these needs. KDMC also conducted free screening events and offered low-cost A1C blood profiles throughout the region to help identify people who may have pre-diabetes or diabetes and to educate them about seeking care and assisting individuals who are managing their condition. Hypertension: KDMC provided multiple screening and education events focused on hypertension in the service area and beyond. Materials were provided to participants on how to lower or maintain a healthy blood pressure.In addition to the programming focused specifically on the six primary needs from the CHNA, KDMC provided additional programming in the primary, secondary and tertiary market, including health screenings, health education programs, support groups, clinical research opportunities, blood drives, mobile services, and others.KDMC addressed all of the significant needs identified through the CHNA. All goals and objectives for the three-year plan are currently being met."

Key informants were contacted by email, introducing the purpose of the survey and providing a link to take the survey online. Key informants were asked to rate the degrees to which various health issues were a problem in the Region. Follow up questions asked them to describe why they identified areas as such, and how these might be better addressed. After reviewing the Community Health Needs Assessment findings, the community representatives met on June 10, 2015 to determine the health needs to be prioritized for action. During a detailed presentation of the CHNA findings, the Hospital used audience response system (ARS) technologies to lead steering committee members through a process of understanding key local data findings (Areas of Opportunity) and ranking identified health issues against the following established, uniform criteria: Magnitude, Impact / Seriousness / Feasibility, Consequences of Inaction. From this exercise, the areas of opportunity were prioritized as follows by the committee: Mental Health, Nutrition, Physical Activity & Weight Status, Diabetes, Substance Abuse, Cancer, Heart Disease and Stroke.

The following applies to both Des Moines and Westlake. The two facilities are in close proximity to one another, define their community the same and share resources. The Central Iowa Health Needs Assessment (CHNA) was a collaboration among the three community based hospitals in our community - Mercy Medical Center-Des Moines, Unity Point - Des Moines, and Broadlawns Medical Center. These three hospitals serve multi-county areas, so the CHNA process included Polk, Warren and Dallas counties. Each county brought the information from their own county assessment to the table for discussion. As the workgroups refined the data and community input, a CHNA Steering Committee provided a final level of analysis and structure. The final report addresses six priorities, based on the potential for implementation and depth of impact. Those priorities include: A. Increase opportunities for expanded and alternative means of healthcare delivery to address issues limiting access to care To expand its patient reach and services, Mercy will: * Explore the development of a 23-hour observation crisis unit to be staffed by 1-2 nurses. This area would be for patients who are ready to be discharged home but don't have the family or support system to assist with their discharge and treatment plan. * Implement creative ways to treat all types of behavioral health patients as the need for this growing population intensifies and access to care moves to the forefront of behavioral health service needs in Iowa. * Examine opportunities to meet the health needs of the most vulnerable, especially the chronically homeless * Assess locations with increasing need and capacity B. Establish more vibrant communities and neighborhoods characterized by mixed- and joint-use spaces and facilities that are accessible and available to everyone, including public gathering places for diverse and integrated engagement, and designs that promote healthy lifestyles To enhance the surroundings for all to feel safe and welcome, Mercy will: * Provide volunteer teams for community activities, especially clean up and restoration activities for the most vulnerable residents. * Sponsor the Multi-cultural Market The 6th Avenue Corridor, Inc. , a summer-long festival featuring a diverse array of ethnic and multicultural products (textiles, artisan goods, food) while encouraging neighborhood activity and community-building. * Work with the city and county leaders as well as other partners to support success of a new streetscape. This will include new pedestrian safety features, aesthetic improvements, and sustainability concepts C. Expand statewide training efforts for all professionals working with children across the various health and child-serving systems in Trauma Informed Care, cultural competency, and mental health first aid To improve the care of children through the education of their providers, Mercy will: * Mercy will host, at minimum, two training opportunities per year for health care staff on the topics of trauma-informed care, the impact of adverse childhood experiences, toxic stress, and/or mental health first aid. These trainings will continue to increase awareness and gain understanding of these important issues. Trainings will also offer potential responses to consider implementing within our systems of care. * Mercy Children's Hospital and Clinics will continue to share the Connections Matter training with medical staff and communities by having other staff complete the train-the-presenter Connections Matter workshop and offer Connections Matter trainings. * Knowing that early intervention is key in reducing the impacts of trauma and that the foundations of mental health are set in the first five years of life, Mercy will re-engage staff and medical providers within our clinics to increase referrals to our local 1st Five program. D. Identify additional sources of funding to create new and expand existing training programs in Psychiatry and Psychology and improve the mental health and disabilities training of primary care doctors and other primary care providers To work for an increase of behavioral health services, Mercy will: * Develop an assessment of current and emerging trends in Behavioral Health services; * Develop a forecast for the next 3 to 5 years; * Compare the current supply and resources compared to the projected resource needs based on the forecast of future demand. * While exploring collaboration alternatives, maximize the investment and services of Mercy's Behavioral Health service line * Provide increased mental health services to the underserved via House of Mercy programming E. Ensure access to high-quality pre-K and K-12 education for Central Iowa children To contribute to the education of all children in grades K-12, Mercy will: * Provide support and human resources to programs seeking volunteers in school settings * Maintain supportive mental health and substance abuse counselling for children and families in need of assistance through the House of Mercy * Provide learning opportunities to students interested in health care fields * Participate in Project SEARCH for young adults with learning disabilities * Partner with schools via GIRL POWER, an empowerment program to increase self-esteem and reduce risk behaviors F. Ensure access to health care services and education for Central Iowa's newcomer population To improve health care for the newest Iowans with diverse backgrounds, Mercy will: * Provide cultural and linguistic support to Limited English Proficiency (LEP) refugees served by the USCRI * Increase access to physical and mental health resources for Limited English Proficiency (LEP) refugees * Build the capacity of health care providers to provide culturally and linguistically appropriate services to refugees * Provide direct case management services to refugees in the community under supervision of USCRI Wellness Program staff * Conduct home visits, intakes and assessments of clients referred to the Wellness Program under supervision of Wellness Program staff; * Coordinate appointments and services, maintain appointment notes for clients enrolled in the Wellness Program; * Communicate with healthcare providers about ongoing barriers or needs of clients served in the Wellness Program, and work to eliminate these barriers."

INCREASE ACCESS TO TOBACCO CESSATION RESOURCES FOR PATIENTS AND FAMILIES PRESENTING TO OUR HOSPITALS AND CLINICS -AN ASSET ASSESSMENT AND GAP ANALYSIS OF THE SYSTEMS CURRENT TOBACCO TREATMENT OFFERINGS WAS CONDUCTED EARLIER THIS YEAR. RECOMMENDATIONS FROM THAT ASSESSMENT INCLUDE CREATION AND IMPLEMENTATION OF A CLEARLY OUTLINED REFERRAL PROCESS AND DEFINED RESOURCES; PROMOTION OF THE ASK, ADVISE, ACT/REFER MODEL TO INITIATE INTERVENTION; DEVELOPMENT AND IMPLEMENTATION OF PREOPERATIVE PROTOCOL TO PROMOTE TOBACCO CESSATION 12 HOURS PRE- AND POST-SURGERY. -EARLIER THIS YEAR, WE PROVIDED TRAINING TO 12 KEY COXHEALTH STAFF MEMBERS AND 3 COMMUNITY EDUCATORS. COMPLETION OF THE UMASS EDUCATION CURRICULUM, REQUIRED EXAMS, AND PRACTICE HOURS MAKE CLASS PARTICIPANTS ELIGIBLE FOR CERTIFICATION AS TOBACCO TREATMENT SPECIALISTS. AS A RESULT OF THIS EDUCATION, THERE WILL BE A LARGE INCREASE IN THE AMOUNT OF CESSATION RESOURCES AVAILABLE WITHIN THE SYSTEM. -THE QUIT RATE FOR OUR MFH STONE AND TANEY COUNTIES TOBACCO CESSATION GRANT HAS STEADILY INCREASED SINCE ITS INCEPTION IN 2013, WITH THE CURRENT QUIT RATE FOR 2018 TO DATE AT 75%. AVERAGING ACROSS THE HISTORY OF THE PROGRAM, THE AGGREGATED QUIT RATE IS 53%. -DUE TO THE SUCCESS OF THIS PROGRAM, FOLLOWING THE GRANTS END ON MAY 31, 2018, WE WERE ABLE TO HIRE A FULL TIME TOBACCO CESSATION COORDINATOR WHO WILL BE RESPONSIBLE FOR COORDINATING SYSTEM EFFORTS TO STANDARDIZE POLICIES AND REFERRAL PROCESSES ACROSS ALL CAMPUSES AND SETTINGS. 4. DECREASE CHILDHOOD OBESITY -THE CARDIAC KIDS PROGRAM IS IMPLEMENTED IN 13 RURAL SCHOOLS IN THE COXHEALTH SERVICE AREA. ITS MAIN OBJECTIVE IS TO SCREEN 5TH GRADE STUDENTS FOR HEALTH INDICATORS THAT PUT THEM AT HIGH RISK FOR DEVELOPING CARDIAC DISEASE. SCREENING BY COXHEALTH STAFF INCLUDES HEIGHT AND WEIGHT MEASUREMENT, BMI CONSULT, AND HEALTH/NUTRITION EDUCATION. -APPROXIMATELY 400 CHILDREN ARE SCREENED ANNUALLY. THOSE WHO ARE DEEMED HIGH RISK ARE REFERRED TO THE COMMITTED TO KIDS PROGRAM. THIS 8-WEEK PROGRAM IS AN INTENSIVE INTERVENTION FOR AT-RISK CHILDREN AND THEIR FAMILIES FOCUSING ON HEATHY BEHAVIOR AND NUTRITION EDUCATION. -PLANS ARE IN PLACE TO FURTHER INTEGRATE THE TWO PROGRAMS TO PROVIDE A COHESIVE UNIT AND BETTER UTILIZE RESOURCES TO SERVE AT-RISK COMMUNITIES. 5. INCREASE THE NUMBER OF WOMEN WHO BREASTFEED THEIR INFANTS AFTER DELIVERY -COXHEALTH AND THE SPRINGFIELD-GREENE COUNTY HEALTH DEPARTMENT ARE CURRENTLY ENGAGED IN A COMMUNITY BREASTFEEDING COALITION WITH THE GOAL OF STRATEGICALLY ALIGNING EFFORTS TO HELP MOVE THE CHIP INITIATIVE FORWARD. -IN ADDITION TO EDUCATION PRESENTED IN OUR GENERAL PRENATAL CLASSES, THE COXHEALTH LACTATION CONSULTANTS FACILITATE A MONTHLY BREASTFEEDING SUPPORT GROUP CALLED THE LACTATION CLUB. -THE ANNUAL COXHEALTH BABY FAIR IS A FREE EVENT THAT FEATURES VENDOR DISPLAYS, DEMONSTRATIONS, DOOR PRIZES, AND CLASSES WITH A VARIETY OF TOPICS INCLUDING BREASTFEEDING. 6. INCREASE DETECTION AND TREATMENT OF THE EARLIEST STAGES OF LUNG CANCER NODULES -COXHEALTH OFFERS LOW-DOSE CT SCANS AS A DIAGNOSTIC SCREENING FOR LUNG CANCER. LOW-DOSE CT SCANS USE LOWER AMOUNTS OF RADIATION TO HELP IDENTIFY LUNG NODULES IN THE EARLIEST STAGES OF LUNG CANCER WHEN IT IS MOST TREATABLE. STUDIES HAVE SHOWN THAT PATIENTS WHO PARTICIPATE IN A LOW-DOSE CT LUNG CANCER PROGRAM ARE 20% LESS LIKELY TO DIE FROM LUNG CANCER THAN THOSE WHO WERE NOT SCREENED WHEN APPROPRIATE. -SINCE THE PROGRAM BEGAN, THE NUMBER OF INDIVIDUALS WHO HAD A LOW-DOSE CT SCAN COMPLETED HAS INCREASED NEARLY THREE-FOLD. AS A RESULT, 354 PEOPLE HAVE BEEN SCREENED FOR EARLY STAGE LUNG CANCER USING LOW-DOSE CT SCAN TECHNOLOGY. -THE GOAL OF DEVELOPING A REFERRAL PATHWAY BETWEEN THE CLINIC AND SYSTEM TOBACCO CESSATION RESOURCES IS UNDERWAY. 7. INCREASE REFERRALS TO COMMUNITY ORAL HEALTH RESOURCES FOR PATIENTS PRESENTING TO THE ED FOR DENTAL ISSUES -COMMUNITY PARTNERSHIPS WITH LOCAL RESOURCES HAVE BEEN STRENGTHENED AND REFINED TO ENSURE STAFF FEEL EMPOWERED TO REFER PATIENTS TO FACILITIES LIKE THE JORDAN VALLEY COMMUNITY HEALTH CENTER (JVCHC) FOR THE APPROPRIATE LEVEL OF CARE FOR ORAL HEALTH ISSUES. -WHEN EVALUATING THE CHIEF COMPLAINTS OF PATIENTS THAT PRESENTED TO THE EMERGENCY DEPARTMENT (ED) FIVE OR MORE TIMES IN A 12-MONTH PERIOD FOR NON-EMERGENT CARE, DENTAL COMPLAINTS RANKED AMONG THE HIGHEST. -PROTOCOLS WERE DEVELOPED FOR PATIENTS THAT PRESENT WITH TOOTH PAIN IN THE ED. AFTER THE MEDICAL SCREENING EXAM COMPLETION, THE PATIENT IS TRANSITIONED TO JVCHC FOR IMMEDIATE DENTAL CARE. -COXHEALTH WORKED IN COLLABORATION WITH JVCHC TO APPLY FOR A GRANT THAT ALLOWED FOR THE HIRE OF ADDITIONAL DENTISTS. TO ENSURE SAME-DAY OR NEXT DAY APPOINTMENTS, THE DENTAL CLINIC EXPANDED TO ADD SATURDAY HOURS. -QUICK ACCESS TO THE DENTAL CLINIC ALLOWED COXHEALTH ED PHYSICIANS TO DISCONTINUE PRESCRIBING NARCOTICS TO PATIENTS WHO PRESENTED WITH TOOTH PAIN. IN 2017, 2,098 INDIVIDUALS WHO PRESENTED TO THE SPRINGFIELD ED WITH NON-EMERGENT DENTAL PAIN WERE REFERRED TO JORDAN VALLEY FOR TREATMENT. OF THOSE INDIVIDUALS, 1,061 (50.5%) RECEIVED TREATMENT. -FOLLOWING A JOINT EFFORT BETWEEN PROGRAM ADMINISTRATORS AT COXHEALTH AND JORDAN VALLEY TO IMPROVE COMMUNICATION AND DATA REPORTING, THE MONTHLY REFERRAL COMPLETION RATE TO DATE HAS INCREASED EXPONENTIALLY TO 91.0%. -IN 2017, OF THE 612 INDIVIDUALS WHO PRESENTED TO COX BRANSON ED WITH DENTAL PAIN, 426 WERE REFERRED TO APPROPRIATE DENTAL CARE. OF THOSE REFERRAL PATIENTS WHO COULD BE REACHED FOR FOLLOW-UP, 31.5% HAD FULFILLED THEIR REFERRAL APPOINTMENT. THE LOW COMPLETION RATE CAN BE CORREL"

To support the development of the 2015 CHNA and to foster broad collaboration among health systems and hospitals, WellStar engaged Georgia Health Policy Center (GHPC) in the Andrew Young School of Policy Studies at Georgia State University to work with its third-party CHNA consultant to leverage the quantitative and some of its qualitative (focus group) research it does for Kaiser Permanente. As a result, GPHCs data collection and analysis contributed to the CHNAs of four health systems (WellStar Health System, Grady Health System, Kaiser Permanente, and Piedmont Healthcare), a health plan and an urban county health department. WellStars third-party consultant solicited community input via photo testimonies, interviewing/surveying community stakeholders (representing a broad array of community-based organizations and other institutional assetS engaged in socioeconomic determinants of health and health improvement), community members utilizing listening sessions at WellStars partnering community safety net clinics and Hispanic congregations/organizations and an online survey, and WellStar Medical Group providers. A comprehensive and expansive listing of CHNA collaborators can be found on page 39 of the joint legacy hospital CHNA report accessible to the public at www.wellstar.org/chna Quantitative data sources include: 1. Community Commons (through Kaiser Permanente's web portal: www.chna.org/kp) 2. Georgia Department of Public Health's Online Analytical Statistical Information System (OASIS) 3. U.S. Census Bureau American Community Survey 5-Year Dataset 4. University of Wisconsin's County Health Rankings 5. Georgia Area Resource File 6.

WellStar Health Systems Enterprise Intelligence 8. Cobb Douglas Public Health 9. Behavioral Risk Factor Surveillance System (BRFSS) 10. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention for various indicators Qualitative data sources include: 1. Insights from 99 WellStar Medical Group (WMG) representatives regarding patient health status and community resources were gleaned from an online survey tool sent to WMG providers (MDs and nurse practitioners) and registered nurses. 2. A wide net was cast for community input with an online survey tool (available in English and Spanish) capturing demographics and overall personal health status and behaviors of 447 community members. Community clinics, health e-newsletters, workplace partners, a Public Health Department, a school system, a Hispanic non-profit, and faith-based organizations disseminated the online link via email and social media. Its approximated the survey link was distributed to 5,000 people. 3. 61 key informant surveys/interviews (all WellStar driven except eight by GHPC) were conducted with multi-sector leaders representing diverse organizations including Public Health Departments, governmental agencies, safety net clinics, business leaders, and regional health board representatives. Collecting information from a wide range of experts with first-hand knowledge about the community provided insight on health issues and care barriers along with recommended interventions. 4. To provide a broader base of input and use the CHNA process as a means to strengthen community partnerships, seven listening sessions (three in Spanish) were conducted with 58 medically underserved and uninsured community members. Sites for the sessions were partnering safety net clinic patients (Bethesda Community Clinic in Cherokee, Good Samaritan Health Center in Cobb, The CarePlace in Douglas), Latino community members (WellStar Congregational Health Network members Iglesia de Dios in South Cobb and McEachern UMC in Powder Springs), Ser Familia community members, and the Paulding County Health Department. In each listening session, a few community members provided: 5. photo testimonies from participants in listening sessions were taken to communicate the individuals greatest health-related need. 6.

201811359349311426,582032904,"SCHEDULE H, PART V, SECTION B, LINE 6A","ORGANIZATIONS INCLUDED IN COMMUNITY HEALTH NEEDS ASSESSMENT (CHNA): As an integrated health system, WellStar Health System submitted a joint 2015 CHNA for the five legacy hospitals (WellStar Cobb, Douglas, Kennestone, Paulding, and Windy Hill) located in its primary service area defined as one community. This varied approach from the individual 2013 CHNA reports and implementation strategies is attributed to WellStars System-wide delivery system of community benefit services and the ability to best leverage its economies of scale and services to address the prioritized health needs of the community, especially the most vulnerable. For the WellStar hospitals and its collaborative community partners, the joint approach to addressing priority health needs maximizes resources to enhance care access, strengthens partnerships for shared responsibility and helps improve overall community health. (Also, note there were no variances on the priority health needs of each individual hospital in the 2013 reports except for the data included. Due to hospital and community collaboration, the information and implementation strategy were basically the same for each hospital to be delivered and led at the System-level.) (1) The joint WellStar legacy hospital CHNA report meets the requirements of paragraph (b)(6)(i) of this section. WellStars five legacy hospitals collaborated in conducting the 2015 CHNA, and, for specified quantitative and qualitative data, other hospital systems including Kaiser Permanente, Piedmont and Grady. Guided at the System level, WellStar hospitals solicited the help of state and local health departments and key informants to assess the health needs of the community and collaborated in conducting community surveys and hosting listening sessions and focus groups to solicit and receive input from residents, including its medically underserved, low-income, and minority populations. The 2015 CHNA report documents the joint CHNA process and contains all of the elements described in paragraph (b)(6)(i) of the IRSs 501(r) section in the Code of Regulations as it relates to community health needs assessments. The WellStar Health System Board of Trustees adopted the joint CHNA and its implementation strategy on June 2, 2016. (2) The joint CHNA report is clearly identified as applying to the hospital facility. All five WellStar legacy hospitals, WellStar Cobb, Douglas, Kennestone, Paulding, and Windy Hill hospitals, are noted on the cover of the joint CHNA and each hospitals president is listed as members of the WellStar Community Benefit Oversight Committee within the CHNA, along with a hospital-specific profiles and county-specific primary and secondary data and noted in the Tracking Progress section (2015 CHNA, page 62). (3) All of the collaborating hospital facilities and organizations included in the joint CHNA report define their community to be the same. Yes, based upon WellStars: 1. System-based model for delivering most all community benefit services and evaluating its impact (again, to leverage the economies of scale and services to deliver program that address the priority needs) 2. Overlapping hospital 90 percent catchment areas 3. Similar community health needs key findings and themes (access to care and healthy lifestyles prevalence of chronic disease) based upon intensive quantitative and qualitative data and the work of the WellStar Community Health Collaborative task force to identify the priority needs of the overall community (representatives from WellStar services lines, hospitals, departments and the community stakeholders) based on the severity of the need and assets of WellStar and its community stakeholders and partners to address the need."

The programs are designed to: - Provide organization, framework and leadership to the delivery of community benefit services and enables us to more effectively evaluate and measure the impact on community health - Strengthen WellStars strategic community partnerships in public AND PRIVATE SECTORS THROUGH FORMALIZED ENGAGEMENT AS AS ""PARTNERS IN HEALTH"" LEVERAGING EXPERTISE, RESOURCES AND SERVICES TO COMPLEMENT AND/OR BRIDGE INTERVENTION GAPS AND ADDRESS HEALTH DISPARITIES - Boost WellStars ability to replicate and deliver community benefit services across an expanding health system footprint - Maximize the investment in WellStars safety net clinic/non-profit partners by better aligning our services and resources to address priority health needs - Improve overall community health, especially among the vulnerable. The WellStar 4-1 Care Network and Live Well programs provide organizational structure and accountability to WellStar and its legacy hospitals efforts to reach out to those in need, to improve the health of the communities we serve and to enhance access to care. These efforts flow from the WellStar mission and vision and to meet the requirements of federal government (Affordable Care Act Section 9007) of system-wide oversight and guidance regarding tracking community benefit activities, assessing community health needs and developing strategic plans that prioritize community benefit programming. 1. WellStar 4-1 Care Network: Clinical Care Intervention Program - Priority Need Addressed from the 2015 Joint CHNA: Underuse of Primary Care: includes ED utilization and increased care capacity at community safety net clinics Goals: - Expand the WellStar patient experience to partnering community safety net clinics to reduce health disparities through improved access to volunteer primary care physicians and other specialty medical services to vulnerable populations - Build a cost-efficient model of care - Develop and educate about available health resources and facilities to ""prescribe"" to the medically underserved and uninsured - Decrease ED utilization and readmissions for non-emergent needs to deliver the right care at the right place to the medically underserved and uninsured. THE NAME REFERS TO THE AIM OF THE LOW-COST HEALTHCARE DELIVERY SYSTEM IN THE COMMUNITY TO CARE ""FOR ONE"" ANOTHER BY ADDRESSING THE UNDERUSE OF PRIMARY CARE AND REDUCING ED UTILIZATION AND READMISSIONS FOR NON-EMERGENT ISSUES THAT POTENTIALLY COULD BE TREATED IN AN OUTPATIENT SETTING. It also reflects increasing safety net clinic capacity, education and resources via WellStar Medical Group (WMG) citizenship, with MDs and NPs volunteering four hours one time per month. 2. Live Well: Healthy Behaviors Intervention Program - Priority Health Needs Addressed from the 2015 Joint CHNA: Cancer, Cardiovascular Disease, COPD/Asthma, Obesity, Type 2 Diabetes Goal: - Improve the health of medically underserved and uninsured residents through targeted preventive services, education and outreach. Live Wells targeted outreach to vulnerable populations to address healthy lifestyle-related priority health needs leverages the WellStar 4-1 Care Network partners by delivering health need-specific education, events and preventive screenings on-site and in other high-need site locations. Live Well works in tandem with 4-1 Care and other collaborative partnerships to help reduce the prevalence of chronic disease and its complications through prevention and wellness activities and the promotion of healthy lifestyles. Aligning the resources of the WellStar Community Education & Outreach team, Live Well also will partner with other community groups and organizations proximate to community safety net clinics for volunteerism, health navigation, transportation, and other supportive services. UNADDRESSED CHNA NEEDS - Health needs not identified as priority fall into one of three categories: 1) Beyond the scope of WellStar services, e.g. dental care which is addressed by safety nets clinics 2) Needs further intervention, but no plans for expanding current community benefit services at this time, e.g. maternal/infant health 3) Relying on community partners to lead efforts with expertise in these areas with WellStar in a supportive role, e.g. substance abuse, violence, suicide, STDs, transportation. To identify the six priority health needs WellStars legacy hospitals will address, leaders of Kennesaw State Universitys A.L. Burruss Institute of Public Service & Research were solicited to guide the WellStar Community Health Collaborative task force (made up of WellStar internal team members and community stakeholders) through the prioritization process. Health needs data summaries were advanced ahead of the Health Needs Summit on FebRUARY 25, 2016 for review. From the significant health needs identified by CHNA research conducted in the fall/winter of 2015, the priority health needs were determined via an online survey tool for the community WellStar legacy hospitals serve."

201821359349312367,710240352,"FORM 990, SCHEDULE H, PART V, SECTION B, LINE 11","MERCY HOSPITAL FORT SMITH IS ADDRESSING THE SIGNIFICANT NEEDS IDENTIFIED IN ITS MOST RECENTLY CONDUCTED CHNA BY FOCUSING PROGRAMMING, SERVICES AND EDUCATION AND AWARENESS AROUND: (1) ACCESS TO CARE, (2) MENTAL HEALTH, AND (3) NUTRITION. THE COMMUNITY HEALTH IMPROVEMENT PLAN (CHIP) WILL DESCRIBE THE ACTIONS THAT THE HOSPITAL INTENDS TO TAKE TO ADDRESS THE HEALTH NEEDS, THE ANTICIPATED IMPACT OF THESE ACTIONS, AND THE PLAN TO EVALUATE SUCH IMPACT; IDENTIFY THE PROGRAMS AND RESOURCES THAT THE HOSPITAL PLANS TO COMMIT TO ADDRESS THE HEALTH NEEDS AND DESCRIBE ANY PLANNED COLLABORATION BETWEEN THE HOSPITAL AND OTHER AGENCIES IN ADDRESSING THE HEALTH NEED. MERCY HOSPITAL FORT SMITH WAS AWARDED A COACHING GRANT THROUGH THE ROBERT WOOD JOHNSON FOUNDATION TO HELP DEVELOP THE STRUCTURE OF THE COMMUNITY HEALTH COUNCIL. THE COUNCIL IS IN ITS SECOND YEAR AND CONSISTS OF 40 PLUS COMMUNITY LEADERS AND NOT-FOR-PROFIT ORGANIZATIONS TO IMPACT AND CHANGE THE CULTURE OF HEALTHCARE. THE FIRST IDENTIFIED NEED IS ACCESS TO CARE. WHILE HAVING ACCESS TO CARE IS VITAL TO IMPROVING TREATMENT AND HEALTH FOR PEOPLE, ACCESSING APPROPRIATE CARE IS EQUALLY IMPORTANT. THIS INCLUDES ENSURING INDIVIDUALS HAVE A PLAN TO COVER THE COST OF CARE AND MAKING SURE THAT THERE IS APPROPRIATE PROVIDER COVERAGE IN COMMUNITIES. ANOTHER IMPORTANT COMPONENT IS CHANGING THE CULTURE TO ACCESS CARE APPROPRIATELY. EFFORTS TO ADDRESS EACH HEALTH ISSUE SHOULD FOCUS ON IMPROVING THE SYSTEMS AROUND THE INDIVIDUAL TO IMPROVE HEALTH AND ACCESS TO APPROPRIATE CARE AND WORK TO MODIFY THE WAY THAT INDIVIDUALS CONSUME HEALTH SERVICES TO ENSURE CARE IS EFFECTIVE AND EFFICIENT. MERCY HOPE CLINIC OPENED IN SEPTEMBER 2017 AT THE HOPE CAMPUS TO SERVE THE MARGINALIZED AND HOMELESS IN THE COMMUNITY. MERCY FORT SMITH HAS PARTNERED WITH FIVE LOCAL ELEMENTARY SCHOOLS IN ECONOMICALLY AND MEDICALLY UNDERSERVED AREAS (ZIP CODES 72901 AND 72904) TO PROVIDE FREE KINDERGARDEN PHYSICALS TO ENSURE ENROLLMENT. MERCY IS PARTNERING WITH THE SISTERS OF MERCY MINISTRIES INTERNATIONALLY TO LEARN AND SHARE INFORMATION AND SERVICES ON WAYS TO SERVE THE MOST VULNERABLE POPULATIONS, PARTICULARLY IN AREAS OF PERU. THE SECOND IDENTIFIED NEED IS MENTAL HEALTH AWARENESS AND EMOTIONAL WELLBEING. MENTAL HEALTH IS A COMMON THREAD IN MANY CHRONIC HEALTH CONDITIONS. DEPRESSION HAS BEEN LINKED TO HIGHER RATES OF CARDIOVASCULAR DISEASE AND DIABETES. ADDITIONALLY, PERSONS WITH DEPRESSION TEND TO ENGAGE IN MORE RISK BEHAVIORS FOR THESE DISEASES SUCH AS SMOKING, POOR DIET OR LACK OF EXERCISE THAN PERSONS WITHOUT DEPRESSION. A 2006 STUDY SUGGESTS THAT 80% OF THOSE DIAGNOSED WITH SCHIZOPHRENIA USE TOBACCO PRODUCTS. A GROWING BODY OF EVIDENCE SUGGESTS THAT THE LACK OF SOCIAL CONNECTEDNESS, PARTICULARLY IN OLDER ADULTS, CONTRIBUTES TO POOR HEALTH OUTCOMES. MERCY WILL IMPLEMENT STRATEGIES TO PROMOTE IMPROVED MENTAL HEALTH AND EMOTIONAL WELLBEING BY IDENTIFYING GAPS AND PROMOTING/DEVELOPING STRATEGIES TO EVIDENCED BASED STRATEGIES TO CLOSE THE GAP; WORK TO INCREASE THE NUMBER OF PEOPLE ABLE TO ACCESS APPROPRIATE, QUALITY MENTAL HEALTH TREATMENT/CARE; ADVOCATE AND SUPPORT THE SEBASTIAN COUNTY SHERIFFS DEPARTMENT FOR THE DEVELOPMENT OF A STABILIZATION UNIT TO DIVERT PERSONS SUFFERING FROM A MENTAL HEALTH CRISIS AND TO ENSURE APPROPRIATE LEVEL OF CARE IS RECEIVED; ADVOCATE FOR LEGISLATION TO IMPROVE MENTAL HEALTH SERVICE DELIVERY THROUGH OUR STATE REPRESENTATIVES AND LEGISLATURE AND SUPPORT THE HOPE CAMPUS TO ENSURE THE HOMELESS AND UNDERSERVED RECEIVE ASSISTANCE IN OBTAINING THE APPROPRIATE LEVEL OF CARE. MERCY IS ALSO WORKING WITH RESTORE HOPE, A TASK FORCE APPOINTED BY THE CURRENT ARKANSAS GOVERNOR, TO IDENTIFY AND ADDRESS THE HIGH RECIDIVISM RATES IN SEBASTIAN COUNTY AND THE INCREASING NUMBER OF CHILDREN ENTERING THE FOSTER CARE SYSTEM. THE THIRD IDENTIFIED NEED IS PHYSICAL ACTIVITY AND NUTRITION. REGULAR PHYSICAL ACTIVITY IMPROVES OVERALL HEALTH AND WELL-BEING AND REDUCES THE RISK OF CHRONIC DISEASES AND OBESITY. MORE THAN 80% OF ADULTS AND ADOLESCENTS DO NOT MEET THE GUIDELINES FOR PHYSICAL ACTIVITY. PEOPLE WHO ARE PHYSICALLY ACTIVE TEND TO LIVE LONGER AND HAVE LOWER RISK FOR CARDIOVASCULAR DISEASE, DIABETES, DEPRESSION AND CANCER. PHYSICAL ACTIVITY CAN ALSO HELP WITH WEIGHT CONTROL, AND INACTIVE ADULTS HAVE A HIGHER RISK FOR PREMATURE DEATH. POOR DIETS ARE NOT ONLY A RISK FACTOR FOR OBESITY, BUT FOR OTHER CHRONIC DISEASES AS WELL. FEWER THAN 1 IN 3 ADULTS AND AN EVEN LOWER PROPORTION OF ADOLESCENTS EAT THE RECOMMENDED AMOUNT OF FRUITS AND VEGETABLES EACH DAY. MERCY WILL WORK TO PROMOTE A HEALTHY LIFESTYLE AND IMPROVE ACCESS AND EDUCATION TO NUTRITIOUS FOODS AND PHYSICAL ACTIVITY TO INCREASE THE PERCENTAGE OF PEOPLE LIVING AT A HEALTHY WEIGHT BY EXPLORING FOOD SYSTEMS IN THE FORT SMITH COMMUNITY AND IDENTIFY PARTNERSHIP OPPORTUNITIES THAT INCREASE HEALTHY FOOD CHOICES AND ACCESS TO HEALTHY FOODS, ENGAGE AND EDUCATE MERCY FORT SMITH COMMUNITY EMPLOYEES TO HELP ADDRESS FOOD INSECURITIES AND OBESITY RATES IN THE COMMUNITIES THEY SERVE; SUPPORT AND COLLABORATE WITH LOCAL COMMUNITY GARDENS AND FOOD PANTRIES TO OFFER HEALTHY FOOD CHOICES IN TARGETED FOOD INSECURITY AREAS; PROVIDE COOKING CLASSES WITH FOOD PREPARED FROM THE COMMUNITY GARDENS AND FOOD PANTRIES AND CONTINUE TO SUPPORT LOCAL HEALTHIFICATION ACTIVITIES IN THE COMMUNITIES SERVED; AND PARTNER WITH THE FITNESS CENTER TO PROVIDE EXERCISE CLASSES OUT IN THE COMMUNITY. FOR ALL THESE IDENTIFIED NEEDS AND PRIORITIES, MERCY CONTINUES TO WORK CLOSELY WITH ITS LOCAL PUBLIC SCHOOL SYSTEMS, NONPROFIT ORGANIZATIONS, THE CHAMBER OF COMMERCE, AND PUBLIC OFFICIALS TO ENSURE WE ARE COLLABORATIVELY ADDRESSING THE NEEDS OF OUR COMMUNITY IN A MEASURABLE WAY."

Respondents represented health care agencies, public health agencies, law enforcement, municipalities, schools, local businesses, social service agencies, and nongovernmental organizations. In addition to the stakeholder survey, each county conducted a number of community engagement opportunities (forums) to ensure broad interests of the local community were represented; Obtain stakeholder input on identifying significant health needs based on review of shared CHNA data; Solicit stakeholder feedback on prioritizing significant health needs, and; Identify local assets and resources that potentially may address local health priorities. The local forums were conducted in collaboration with the Maine CDC to solicit input from individuals representing populations with health disparities.

201821359349307847,520591658,MERCY MEDICAL CENTER,"Part V, Section B, Line 11: THE HEALTH AND SOCIAL NEEDS OF MERCY'S COMMUNITY WERE IDENTIFIED IN THE Community Health Needs Assessment (CHNA) which was completed and published before June 30, 2016. Prior to 2013, Mercy's community benefit outreach was focused on a large geographic area within Baltimore City. The hospital primary service area historically covered 17 zip codes in which 60% of all inpatient admissions originated. 15 of these 17 zip codes were previously selected as Mercy's Community Benefit Service Area (""CBSA"") based on the prevalence and concentration of emergency room visits. While appropriate and well intentioned, the use of zip codes as the basis for Mercy's CBSA has proved cumbersome for the following reasons:- Zip codes are by nature large. Mercy's previous CBSA covered almost 70 square miles within the City-the total land area in Baltimore is 81 square miles. Other peer hospitals have designated a much smaller CBSA footprint that tends to focus on the immediate neighborhood(s) in which they reside.- A concentration of emergency room visits (or any other variable) may only exist in a small portion of a zip code. Yet the entire zip code was being added into our CBSA. - Accessible, timely, and high quality community health profiles have already been created by the Baltimore City Health Department. But these community health profiles are organized by much smaller Community Statistical Areas (CSAs), not zip codes.- Finally, zip codes are faceless, impersonal designations that do not carry the same connection and impact as a specifically named community. Mercy's Community Benefits Committee believes that we should focus attention on our neighbors in ""Midtown or ""Mt. Vernon"", and not ""21202"".During a series of meetings, Mercy's Community Benefits Committee discussed the socioeconomic and health parameters that should help define Mercy's ""community"" for purposes of this CHNA. The Sisters of Mercy were originally founded in Dublin, Ireland to care for homeless, abused and neglected women and children. This timeless legacy influenced the Committee to focus attention on certain target populations, such as infants, women, and the impoverished. With a strong desire to be data-driven and mission focused, the Committee identified three relevant factors to help shape the community in which Mercy will focus its limited financial resources as part of the CHNA process: - Low birth weight babies born at Mercy- Repeat emergency room visitors (10+ visits in one year)- Charity care recipientsAdditionally, since the implementation of the new Maryland all-payer model which followed the completion of Mercy's 2013 CHNA, Mercy is increasingly focused on high-utilizer patients, including those within our previously-defined CHNA Community Benefit Service Area. As expected, there is significant geographic overlap of high utilizer patient origin and our previously-defined CBSA, especially in the immediate areas where the most vulnerable populations reside. The similarity of geography presents an ongoing opportunity to increase alignment between Mercy's Community Benefit Activities and Mercy's focused population health interventions to reduce potentially avoidable utilization as identified in Mercy's HSCRC Strategic Hospital Transformation Plan. Mercy believes our population health strategies are integral to our CHNA focus areas:- Improving access to care and the frequency of care for our homeless neighbors.- Identifying tactics and strategies to improve birth outcomes and pre-natal care for expectant mothers.- Facilitating better care coordination with the City's Federally Qualified Health Centers.- Providing support to victims of violence and addiction.- Providing narrowly tailored health education to segments of the population within our community."

Cancer. CHI Health will continue to perform existing cancer outreach throughout the community but did not feel cancer should be a top priority based on the considerations above and in order to focus and meaningfully impact other areas of need. Diabetes. CHI Health will continue performing diabetes outreach and education across the Omaha Metro Area while also addressing diabetes within the priority access to care. Notably, the area of nutrition, physical activity, and weight is a priority which relates to several root causes for diabetes and other chronic disease. Respiratory Diseases. This was not determined as a priority area based on the considerations above and in order to focus and meaningfully impact other areas of need. Sexually Transmitted Disease. There is extensive existing work by community partners currently taking place around sexually transmitted diseases across the Omaha Metro area.

The hospital will not address the following health needs for the following reasons: In acknowledging the range of priority health issues that emerged from the CHNA process, CHI Health Plainview prioritized the health issues above in order to most effectively focus resources and meaningfully impact the selected health issues. As described in the process above, the hospital took into consideration health disparities, in order to select the priorities. The following identified needs will not be prioritized in this implementation plan for the following reasons. Access to Healthcare Services. By providing care as a critical access hospital, CHI Health Plainview allows for increased access to services along with providing charity care to for patients who are low income. Increased access to behavioral health services is also being addressed in the priority area chosen. Aging Population & Related Illnesses. Due to resources and hospital capacity, this priority will not be a focus for the hospital. The hospital will participate in any Health Department efforts around this priority through partnering and attending work group meetings. Housing and Environmental Health. This priority is currently being addressed by other organizations within the community. Chronic Disease. CHI Health will continue to perform existing work around chronic disease and will address some of this priority through the work around obesity, nutrition, and physical activity. Safety.

A) Community Perspective The communitys perspective was obtained through one survey offered to the public using several methods throughout Baltimore City. A 6-item survey queried Baltimore City residents to identify their top health concerns and their top barriers in accessing health care. The sample size was 1,212 Baltimore City residents from the identified CBSA zip codes. B) Health Experts Methods -Reviewed & included National Prevention Strategy Priorities, Maryland State Health Improvement Plan (SHIP) indicators, and Healthy Baltimore 2015 plan from the Baltimore City Health Department -Reviewed Marylands State Health Improvement Plan (SHIP) and attended state-wide health summit in October 2014. -Progress to date on SHIP measures were presented as well as state- wide health priorities for upcoming multi-year cycle. -Conducted campus-wide stakeholder retreat in March 2015, including University of Maryland Schools of Medicine, Nursing, Social Work and UMB Community Affairs office -Interviewed Director of Chronic Disease Prevention at Baltimore City Health Department C) Community Leaders Methods -Hosted a focus group in collaboration with the other Baltimore-based UMMS hospitals for community-based organization partners to share their perspectives on health needs (October 30, 2014).

These top priorities represent the intersection of documented unmet community health needs and the organizations key strengths and mission. These priorities were identified and approved by the UMMC/Midtown CHI Team and validated with the health experts from the UMB Campus Panel. An additional priority, health literacy, is shared throughout the UMMS system. 1. HIV Prevention 2. Substance Abuse Prevention (Smoking) 3. Diabetes Prevention Health Literacy (shared UMMS priority) Each strategic priority has an accompanying implementation plan where objectives, initiatives, community partners, and evaluation strategies are outlined. These implementation plans drive the various initiatives within the three years between needs assessments. Progress is reviewed annually and revisions and/or improvements are made as needed. In addition to the identified strategic priorities from the CHNA, UMMC Midtown Campus employs the following prioritization framework which is stated in the UMMC/Midtown Community Outreach Plan. Because the Medical Center, serves the region and state, priorities may need to be adjusted rapidly to address an urgent or emergent need in the community, (i.e. disaster response or infectious disease issue). The CHNA prioritized needs for the Sustained and Strategic Response Categories and the Rapid and Urgent Response Categories needs will be determined on an as-needed basis. UMMC and UMMC Midtown Campus will provide leadership and support within the communities served at variety of response levels. Rapid and Urgent response levels will receive priority over sustained and strategic initiatives as warranted. -Rapid Response - Emergency response to local, national, and international disasters, i.e. civil unrest, weather disasters earthquake, blizzards, terrorist attack -Urgent Response - Urgent response to episodic community needs, i.e. H1N1/ Flu response -Sustained Response - Ongoing response to long-term community needs, i.e. obesity and tobacco prevention education, health screenings, workforce development -Strategic Response - Long-term strategic leadership at legislative and corporate levels to leverage relationships to promote health-related policy or reform and build key networks Future Community Health Needs Assessments will be conducted in Fiscal Year 2018 and every three years afterward and strategic priorities will be re-evaluated then. Programmatic evaluations will occur on an ongoing basis and annually, and adjustments to programs will be as needed. All community benefits reporting will occur annually to meet state and federal reporting requirements. Unmet Community Needs Several additional topic areas were identified by the Community Health Improvement Team during the CHNA process including: Behavioral/mental health, safe housing, transportation, and substance abuse. While the UMMC Midtown Campus will focus the majority of its efforts on the identified strategic programs outlined below, we will review the complete set of needs identified in the CHNA for future collaboration and work. These areas, while still important to the health of the community, will be met through either existing clinical programs (i.e. Methadone clinics, Residential Psychiatric program) or through collaboration with the University of Maryland Medical Center or other health care organizations as needed. Additionally, substance abuse programming is already integrated into existing programs at the Medical Center Storks Nest and Violence Prevention programs. The additional unmet needs not addressed by UMMC or UMMC Midtown Campus will also continue to be addressed by key Baltimore City governmental agencies and existing community-based organizations. The UMMC Midtown Campus strategic community priorities target the intersection of the identified community needs and the organizations key strengths and mission. The needs assessment process will be repeated in Fiscal Year 2018."

EACH GROUP WAS DESIGNED TO CAPTURE THE COLLECTED KNOWLEDGE AND OPINIONS OF PEOPLE WHO LIVE AND WORK IN THE COMMUNITIES SERVED BY COVENANT HEALTH. WE DEVELOPED A PROTOCOL (NOTED IN CHNA APPENDIX 3B, POSTED ON THE COVENANT WEBSITE) FOR EACH GROUP TO ENSURE CONSISTENCY ACROSS INDIVIDUAL FOCUS GROUPS, ALTHOUGH THE FACILITATORS HAD SOME DISCRETION ON ASKING FOLLOW-UP QUESTIONS OR PROBES AS THEY SAW FIT. INVITATION AND RECRUITMENT PROCEDURES VARIED FOR EACH TYPE OF GROUP. CHNA APPENDIX 3, AVAILABLE ONLINE, ON COVENANT HEALTH WEBSITE, INCLUDES A FULL REPORT OF THE COMMUNITY INPUT PROCESS AND FINDINGS ALONG WITH DESCRIPTIONS OF THE PARTICIPANTS. SPRING 2017 - RESIDENT FOCUS GROUPS: FOR COMMUNITY RESIDENT GROUPS, COMMUNITY BENEFIT STAFF, IN COLLABORATION WITH THEIR COMMITTEES AND THE SYSTEM OFFICE, IDENTIFIED GEOGRAPHIC AREAS WHERE DATA SUGGESTED THERE WERE SIGNIFICANT HEALTH, PHYSICAL ENVIRONMENT, AND SOCIOECONOMIC CONCERNS. THIS PROCESS ALSO IDENTIFIED THE LANGUAGE NEEDS OF THE COMMUNITY, WHICH DETERMINED THE LANGUAGE IN WHICH EACH FOCUS GROUP WAS CONDUCTED. COMMUNITY BENEFIT STAFF THEN PARTNERED WITH COMMUNITY-BASED ORGANIZATIONS THAT SERVE THOSE AREAS TO RECRUIT FOR AND HOST THE FOCUS GROUPS. THE COMMUNITY-BASED ORGANIZATION DEVELOPED AN INVITATION LIST USING THEIR CONTACTS AND KNOWLEDGE OF THE AREA, AND PARTICIPANTS WERE PROMISED A SMALL INCENTIVE FOR THEIR TIME. DESCRIPTION OF MEDICALLY UNDERSERVED, LOW INCOME AND/OR MINORITY POPULATIONS REPRESENTED IN COMMUNITY INPUT PROCESS: TWO CONSULTANTS STAFFED EACH FOCUS GROUP, SERVING AS FACILITATORS AND NOTE TAKERS. THESE CONSULTANTS WERE NOT DIRECTLY AFFILIATED WITH THE MINISTRY TO ENSURE CANDOR FROM THE PARTICIPANTS. THE DEMOGRAPHICS OF THE RESIDENT FOCUS GROUPS ARE AS FOLLOWS: FEMALE - 81% MALE - 19% RACE/ETHNICITY: HISPANIC/LATINO - 69% NON-LATINO WHITE - 15% BLACK/AFRICAN-AMERICAN - 12% NATIVE AMERICAN 4% CHRONIC CONDITIONS: PERSON WITH CHRONIC CONDITIONS OR A LEADER OR REPRESENTATIVE OF INDIVIDUALS WITH CHRONIC CONDITIONS - 58% INCOME: TOTAL HOUSEHOLD INCOME BEFORE TAXES LESS THAN $20,000 - 68%. SPRING 2017 NONPROFIT & GOVERNMENT STAKEHOLDER FOCUS GROUP: FOR THE NONPROFIT AND GOVERNMENT STAKEHOLDER FOCUS GROUP, COMMUNITY BENEFIT STAFF DEVELOPED A LIST OF LEADERS FROM ORGANIZATIONS THAT SERVE DIVERSE CONSTITUENCIES WITHIN THE HOSPITALS SERVICE AREA. MINISTRY STAFF SOUGHT TO INVITE ORGANIZATIONS WITH WHICH THEY HAD EXISTING RELATIONSHIPS, BUT ALSO USED THE FOCUS GROUP AS AN OPPORTUNITY TO BUILD NEW RELATIONSHIPS WITH STAKEHOLDERS. PARTICIPANTS WERE NOT GIVEN A MONETARY INCENTIVE FOR ATTENDANCE. AS WITH THE RESIDENT FOCUS GROUPS, THIS GROUP WAS FACILITATED BY OUTSIDE CONSULTANTS WITHOUT A DIRECT LINK TO ST. JOSEPH HEALTH. SPRING 2017 - RESIDENT COMMUNITY FORUM: RECRUITMENT FOR THE COMMUNITY RESIDENT FORUM WAS MUCH BROADER TO ENCOURAGE AS MANY PEOPLE AS POSSIBLE TO ATTEND THE SESSION. COMMUNITY BENEFIT STAFF PUBLICIZED THE EVENT THROUGH FLYERS AND EMAILS USING THEIR EXISTING OUTREACH NETWORKS, AND ALSO ASKED THEIR PARTNER ORGANIZATIONS TO INVITE AND RECRUIT PARTICIPANTS. NO FORMAL INVITATION LIST WAS USED FOR THE FORUMS AND ANYONE WHO WISHED TO ATTEND WAS WELCOMED. THE FORUM WAS CONDUCTED BY AN OUTSIDE CONSULTANT IN ENGLISH, WITH SIMULTANEOUS SPANISH LANGUAGE TRANSLATION FOR ANYONE WHO REQUESTED IT. WHILE THE FOCUS GROUPS FOLLOWED A SIMILAR PROTOCOL TO EACH OTHER IN WHICH FIVE TO SIX QUESTIONS WERE ASKED OF THE GROUP, THE FORUM FOLLOWED A DIFFERENT PROCESS. THE LEAD FACILITATOR SHARED THE HEALTH NEEDS THAT HAD EMERGED FROM THE CHNA PROCESS SO FAR AND ASKED THE PARTICIPANTS TO COMMENT ON THEM AND ADD ANY OTHER CONCERNS. ONCE THE DISCUSSION WAS COMPLETE, THE PARTICIPANTS ENGAGED IN A CUMULATIVE VOTING PROCESS USING DOTS TO INDICATE THEIR GREATEST CONCERNS.

Healthy Roanoke Valley (HRV), housed under the United Way of Roanoke Valley, was formed in 2012 as a community response to needs identified in Carilion Medical Center's triennial Roanoke Valley CHNA.In June 2015, the CHAT participated in a prioritization activity to determine the greatest needs in the service area based on the primary and secondary data collected during the assessment period. To quantitatively determine health needs, CHAT members were asked to rank the top ten pertinent community needs, with one being the most pertinent. Next, on a scale of 1-5, CHAT members were asked to assign a feasibility and potential impact score for each of the ranked needs. This information was used for the CHAT strategic planning retreat held in August 2015.The top ten priority areas that emerged from these findings include:1. Poor eating habits / lack of nutrient dense foods in diet 2. Access to mental health counseling / substance abuse 3. Access to adult dental care 4. Access to dental care for children 5. Lack of exercise / physical activity 6. Value not placed on preventive care and chronic disease management 7. Access to primary care 8. High prevalence of obesity / overweight individuals 9. Lack of knowledge of community resources 10. Improved coordination of care across the health and human sectorThe CHAT participated in strategic planning on August 31, 2015. It reviewed and accepted the priority areas of access to services (primary care, mental health & substance abuse, and oral health), coordination of care, and wellness. Expected outcomes were approved by the CHAT and will be used by Carilion Medical Center (CMC) to measure impact around the priority areas. Significant Health Needs to be AddressedCMC plans to address key community health needs identified in the 2015 assessment by focusing its efforts on a particular community, one that emerged with the greatest need. Through greater access to clinical care, enhanced community outreach programs, creative community partnerships and focused financial and in-kind support of initiatives, CMC plans to improve community health in the South East neighborhood of Roanoke City. Key focus areas of this health improvement project over the next three years include access to services, coordination of care and wellness.A. Access to Services:CMC will explore the development of a community health center in South East with the goal of increasing access to primary care, urgent care and dental services in the neighborhood. The center may also include a mix of services to address social determinants of health, such as job training, health education and wellness services. This offering will be planned with and provided by community partners, including the City of Roanoke, safety net providers and private businesses.B. Coordination of Care:Carilion's family practices have adopted the medical home model and have added care coordinators to proactively work with its high risk, chronic care patients. Carilion will take a focused approach on the South East patients, integrating medical home approaches with a planned community coordination hub being developed by Healthy Roanoke Valley. C. Wellness:Carilion's Community Outreach staff will provide education, flu shots, and community health screenings to the target population in the South East community. Education includes free interactive presentations on the topics of cancer prevention, diabetes prevention, fitness/exercise, food safety, health/stroke, healthy lifestyles, nutrition, smoking cessation, and stress. Poor eating habits were identified as a key concern in the 2015 RVCHNA. The Carilion Clinic Healthy Food Program (formed to respond to the 2012 RVCHNA) is designed to address this need by promoting healthy, local (when possible), and nutrient-dense food to patients and employees and to encourage healthy eating in the community. Fresh Foods RX, is a partnership with HRV, a program which includes a physician's prescription for healthy food, and a waiver for free local fruits and vegetables was successfully piloted in 2015 with a second pilot expanding the program to three sites in 2016. The Healthier Hospital Healthy Food Initiative, the Carilion Farm Share program, and funding of community programs that address increased access to healthy food will continue.Exercise and fitness opportunities will be a key focus for South East, particularly in relation to childhood obesity. Through a partnership with a local soccer club, Carilion will help build fields in the South East neighborhood and provide scholarships to local children. Carilion also helped to build a community kayak launch on the Roanoke River with access in that neighborhood. Funding of community programs that address increased access to physical activity opportunities will continue.D. Focused Community Grants and Partnerships:Carilion Clinic funds health safety-net providers and causes identified through the RVCHNA and will focus on providing financial support to community health improvement initiatives in the South East neighborhood through community grants and sponsorships.In-kind assistance is also provided through community partnerships that align with the RVCHNA. Carilion actively looks for opportunities to support by providing outreach and educational support. Partnerships include HRV, Anchor of Hope's Community Health Promoter Program, West End Freedom First, Roanoke Regional Housing Authority, Kohl's Cares, the PATH Coalition, Safe Kids, Leap for Local Foods, the Feeding America of SWVA Veggie Mobile, as well as many others. E. Implementation and Measurement:HRV is serving as a key partner in the implementation of health improvement initiatives emerging from the CHNA. The findings of this assessment are key in measuring the progress of HRV initiatives and their impact in the community. The HRV Strategic Action Framework to better meet the needs of our target population includes data driven, evidence-based goals and strategies which address access to care (mental health, oral health, primary care); coordination of care; and wellness. As a result of the 2015 RVCHNA, HRV underwent strategic planning with both its Steering Committee and Action Team members to update the Governance Guidelines, Operations Structure, and Strategic Action Framework to ensure HRV continues to align with the priorities identified in the needs assessment. HRV completed this process in 2016 and began implementation of the 2016-2019 Strategic Action Framework in the summer of 2016.Priority Areas Not being Addressed and the ReasonsA community approach to determine and address priority needs as described above was used in determining which needs cannot be addressed immediately. The needs not identified as ""priority"" are those that will not be actively addressed in this time period."

201831319349300428,240862246,"FACILITY 1, COMMUNITY MEDICAL CENTER - PART V, LINE 11","BELOW ARE SYSTEM-WIDE PROGRAMS OFFERED BY GEISINGER TO FULFILL COMMUNITY NEEDS THAT WERE IDENTIFIED IN CMC'S 2015 CHNA. SOME PROGRAMS ARE COMPLETELY OPERATED OR FUNDED BY GEISINGER AND SOME ARE OFFERED IN COOPERATION WITH LOCAL HEALTH AND HUMAN SERVICE AGENCIES. FOR MORE SPECIFIC NEEDS FOUND IN OUR LOCAL COMMUNITIES, WE OFFER PROGRAMS TO SERVE PATIENTS CLOSE TO HOME. THE TOP THREE NEEDS IDENTIFIED IN THE MOST RECENT AND/OR PAST CHNA SURVEYS FALL INTO ONE OF THREE COMMUNITY NEED CATEGORIES: 1)IMPROVING ACCESS TO HEALTHCARE: THE MOST SIGNIFICANT NEED IDENTIFIED WAS FOR BETTER, FASTER, MORE CONVENIENT AND LESS COSTLY ACCESS TO HEALTHCARE SERVICES. GEISINGER IS TAKING INNOVATIVE STEPS TO ADDRESS BARRIERS TO HEALTHCARE AND HELP PROVIDE PHYSICAL, MENTAL, DENTAL, REHABILITATIVE AND PREVENTIVE SERVICES TO PATIENTS, REGARDLESS OF THEIR HEALTH INSURANCE STATUS. THE TOPICS ADDRESSED INCLUDE: HOW TO FIND THE RIGHT DOCTOR, PROVIDER OR FACILITY; SPECIAL SERVICES PROVIDED TO PATIENTS WITH SPECIFIC NEEDS (SUCH AS THE ELDERLY, UNDERINSURED OR UNINSURED); TRAUMA PREVENTION AND TREATMENT; AND MANY OTHERS. 2)ADDRESSING BEHAVIORAL HEALTH AND SUBSTANCE ABUSE: GEISINGER HAS A WIDE RANGE OF PROGRAMS TO HELP PATIENTS FIND HEALTHCARE SERVICES WHEN THEY ARE FACING BEHAVIORAL HEALTH CHALLENGES OR STRUGGLING WITH ADDICTION. ALZHEIMER'S DISEASE AND OTHER AGING BRAIN ISSUES AS WELL AS ALCOHOLISM AND OPIOID ABUSE ARE ADDRESSED IN A LARGE AND GROWING NUMBER OF PROGRAMS SPECIFICALLY AIMED AT EXPANDING SERVICES. 3)IMPROVING HEALTHY BEHAVIORS: GEISINGER HAS NUMEROUS EDUCATIONAL PROGRAMS TO HELP PATIENTS LIVE WELL. EFFORTS INCLUDE COMMUNITY AND OUTREACH PROGRAMS THAT BRING HEALTHCARE PROFESSIONALS, EDUCATION, NUTRITION AND MEDICATION TO THE PEOPLE. OUR GOAL IS TO ASSIST PATIENTS WITH THEIR HEALTH BEFORE A SERIOUS PROBLEM ARISES SENDING THEM TO THE HOSPITAL. IMPROVING ACCESS TO HEALTHCARE COMPLEX CARE, CLOSER TO HOME: CARE FOR COMPLEX CONDITIONS SUCH AS HEART, LUNG AND KIDNEY DISEASE ARE USUALLY FOUND AT LARGE HEALTH FACILITIES. LONG DRIVES TO A HOSPITAL, LACK OF TRANSPORTATION OPTIONS AND OF SPECIALISTS IN THE AREA MAKES ACCESS TO CARE DIFFICULT. OUR SPECIALISTS TRAVEL SO PATIENTS ARE PROVIDED WITH NEEDED, CONVENIENT SPECIALTY CARE, WITHOUT LONG DRIVES OR THE CHALLENGES OF SEEKING CARE ONLY AT A HOSPITAL. INSTEAD OUR SPECIALISTS TRAVEL ACROSS THE REGION TO CLINICS THAT PROVIDE ADVANCED CARE, WITH THE BENEFIT OF BETTER TRACKING OF PATIENTS WITH CHRONIC CONDITIONS. CLINICS ARE STAFFED WITH DOCTORS, NURSES AND OTHER HEALTHCARE PROFESSIONALS AND DIAGNOSTIC LAB AND IMAGING SERVICES. MANY LOCATIONS ALSO OFFER SPECIALTY PEDIATRIC AND WOMEN'S HEALTH SERVICES. OUR SPECIALISTS, INCLUDING CARDIOLOGY, DERMATOLOGY, COMPLEX ORTHOPAEDIC AND THORACIC SURGERY AND NEUROSURGERY ARE AVAILABLE IN MORE THAN 30 COMMUNITIES ACROSS NORTHEAST AND CENTRAL PA. GEISINGER HEALTH PLAN (GHP): COMPREHENSIVE COVERAGE FOR THE UNINSURED AND SENIORS: GHP, A NONPROFIT HMO, OFFERS AFFORDABLE HEALTH PLANS THAT SERVES THE MOST VULNERABLE IN OUR COMMUNITIES: UNINSURED ADULTS, CHILDREN AND SENIORS. GHP FAMILY IS A MEDICAL-ASSISTANCE, MANAGED-CARE PLAN THAT OFFERS COMPREHENSIVE COVERAGE TO UNINSURED AND UNDERINSURED RESIDENTS OF 22 COUNTIES IN PA. MANY SERVICES ARE PROVIDED AT NO COST, INCLUDING DOCTOR'S OFFICE VISITS, EMERGENCY CARE, PREVENTIVE SERVICES (INCLUDING IMMUNIZATIONS AND SCREENINGS), DIABETES CARE, MATERNITY CARE, DENTAL AND VISION SERVICES AND PRESCRIPTION DRUGS. THERE IS ALSO 24-HOUR ACCESS TO E-NURSES AND HEALTH COACHES. GHP KIDS OFFERS HEALTH COVERAGE TO UNINSURED CHILDREN UNDER 20 YEARS OF AGE IN 40 COUNTIES THROUGH PA'S CHILDREN'S HEALTH INSURANCE PROGRAM (CHIP). FOR MOST CHIP IS FREE AND INCLUDES ROUTINE CHECKUPS AND IMMUNIZATIONS, PRESCRIPTION DRUGS, VISION AND DENTAL SERVICES AND EMERGENCY CARE. FOR SENIORS, NAVIGATING THE COMPLEXITIES OF HEALTHCARE COVERAGE CAN BE OVERWHELMING. GHP OFFERS A DUAL ELIGIBILITY PLAN FOR SENIORS WHO QUALIFY FOR MEDICARE PARTS A AND B COVERAGE AS WELL AS MEDICAID. GEISINGER GOLD SECURE RX IS DESIGNED TO MAKE MEDICAL EXPENSES MORE PREDICTABLE, ALLOW BETTER COORDINATION AMONG PROVIDERS AND LOWER OUT-OF-POCKET EXPENSES FOR SENIORS. THIS PLAN OFFERS CONVENIENT BENEFITS WITH LOW OR NO PREMIUMS, A SINGLE ID CARD, PRESCRIPTION DRUG COVERAGE, DENTAL AND VISION SERVICES, FITNESS PROGRAMS AND CARE MANAGEMENT NURSES. PROVENHEALTH NAVIGATOR: IS A TEAM-ORIENTED MEDICAL HOME. A MEDICAL ""HOME"" IS A PATIENT-CENTERED MODEL OF CARE LED BY THE PATIENT'S PRIMARY DOCTOR AND A TEAM OF HEALTHCARE PROFESSIONALS WORKING TOGETHER TO ENSURE THE PROPER CARE. THE TEAM OF SPECIALISTS, CARE MANAGERS, PHARMACISTS, SOCIAL WORKERS AND COMMUNITY HEALTH ASSISTANTS WORK WITH THE PATIENT, FAMILY AND CAREGIVERS TO PLAN CARE THAT WILL PREVENT URGENT/EMERGENT CARE VISITS AND HOSPITALIZATIONS. RESEARCH HAS SHOWN THAT PATIENTS UNDER THE MEDICAL HOME MODEL ARE HEALTHIER AND SPEND LESS TIME HOSPITALIZED. MEDICAL HOME CARE FOCUSES ON FREQUENT DOCTOR VISITS AND CONSISTENT FOLLOW-UP BY THE TEAM, WHICH HAS SHOWN TO BENEFIT THOSE WITH CHRONIC ILLNESSES (DIABETES, HEART DISEASE, ETC.) MEDICAL HOME PATIENTS ALSO HAVE ACCESS TO DOCTORS AND PHN CARE MANAGERS 24/7. CARE MANAGERS HELP PATIENTS NAVIGATE THE COMPLEX HEALTHCARE SYSTEM, COORDINATING CARE AND COMMUNICATING WITH THE TEAM OF PROVIDERS. CARE MANAGERS, SOCIAL WORKERS AND COMMUNITY HEALTH ASSISTANTS ARE ALSO AVAILABLE TO HELP OUR PATIENTS ADDRESS DIFFICULT CHALLENGES, SUCH AS COPING WITH MENTAL ILLNESS, ADDICTION, ABUSE AND LOSS AND MANAGING DISABILITIES. THE TEAM ALSO COORDINATES COMMUNITY RESOURCES THAT ARE AVAILABLE AND ASSISTS THE PATIENT WITH THEIR NEEDS. BY EXPANDING OUR SUCCESSFUL MEDICAL HOME INITIATIVE, WE'RE ENSURING THAT OUR PATIENTS HAVE ACCESS TO THE MOST EFFECTIVE MODELS OF CARE. GEISINGER TELEMEDICINE BRINGS HEALTHCARE CLOSER TO HOME: IN OUR 31-COUNTY SERVICE AREA, NEARLY HALF OF OUR PATIENT POPULATION RESIDES IN RURAL AREAS, AND MORE THAN 60 PERCENT OF PATIENTS HAVE CHRONIC HEALTH CONDITIONS. OUR TELEMEDICINE PROGRAM ALLOWS PATIENTS TO STILL RECEIVE SPECIALIZED CARE LOCALLY. OUR PROGRAM USES HIGH-DEFINITION AUDIO/VIDEO TECHNOLOGY AND TOOLS SUCH AS DIGITAL STETHOSCOPES TO CONNECT REMOTE PATIENTS TO OUR HOSPITALS AND PRIMARY CARE CLINICS, AS WELL AS TO NON-GEISINGER FACILITIES. INPATIENTS ARE DIAGNOSED EARLIER, BEGIN TREATMENT SOONER AND AVOID HOSPITAL TRANSFERS, SINCE THEIR PHYSICIANS CAN CONSULT OUR SPECIALISTS ANYWHERE WITHIN OUR SYSTEM. OUR SPECIALISTS HAVE ACCESS TO PATIENTS AT CLINICS ACROSS THE STATE WITHOUT THE PATIENT TRAVELING TO A HOSPITAL TO SEE THE SPECIALIST. THIS SAVES TIME AND REDUCES TRAVEL COSTS AND ALLOWS THE SUPPORT OF LOVED ONES AT HOME. EARLIER DIAGNOSIS REDUCES COSTS FOR EVERYONE. THIS PROGRAM ALLOWS PATIENTS TO CONNECT WITH THE RIGHT SPECIALIST WHEN NEEDED. BY CONNECTING PATIENTS TO OUR SPECIALISTS, ACCESS TO HEALTHCARE IS AVAILABLE TO EVERY PATIENT IN OUR COMMUNITIES. SUPPORT FOR SENIORS AT HOME: LIFE GEISINGER (LIVING INDEPENDENTLY FOR ELDERS) HELPS SENIORS STAY AT HOME, STAY INDEPENDENT AND STAY HEALTHY. THE LIFE GEISINGER TEAM IS ON CALL 24/7, PROVIDING SUPPORT FOR SENIORS AND THEIR LOVED ONES.

TRANSPORTATION SERVICES MAKE HOME DELIVERIES OF SUPPLIES AND/OR MEDICATIONS, CARRY SENIORS TO MEDICAL AND OTHER APPOINTMENTS AND DELIVER LIFE PARTICIPANTS TO AND FROM OUR ADULT DAY CENTERS FOR SCHEDULED VISITS. SENIOR DAY CENTERS OFFER SENIORS COMPREHENSIVE MEDICAL AND SOCIAL SERVICES AND OPPORTUNITIES TO SOCIALIZE AND EXERCISE. OUR ADULT DAY CENTERS ARE OPEN TO ALL SENIORS, REGARDLESS OF WHETHER THEY PARTICIPATE IN LIFE GEISINGER. HIGH-QUALITY, NON-EMERGENCY CARE: FOR PATIENTS EXPERIENCING A NON-EMERGENT INJURY OR ILLNESS, GEISINGER CAREWORKS CLINICS OFFER HIGH-QUALITY MEDICAL SERVICES AT CONVENIENT LOCATIONS THROUGHOUT PA. THESE URGENT CARE CLINICS PROVIDE ECONOMICAL AND CONVENIENT HEALTHCARE FROM HIGHLY TRAINED CERTIFIED NURSE PRACTITIONERS AND PHYSICIAN ASSISTANTS. CAREWORKS ATTENDS TO THE MEDICAL NEEDS OF ADULTS AND CHILDREN 12 MONTHS OR OLDER, AND NO APPOINTMENT IS NECESSARY. THE OFFICES COMMUNICATE WITH THE PRIMARY CARE PHYSICIAN ABOUT THE PATIENT'S VISIT. CAREWORKS KEEPS FAMILIES WELL BY INCREASING ACCESS TO OUR PROVIDERS, PROFESSIONALS AND SERVICES IN CONVENIENT COMMUNITY LOCATIONS. BRIDGING THE COMMUNICATIONS GAP: AT GEISINGER, WE SEE PATIENTS WHO HAVE DIFFERENT LEVELS OF HEARING ABILITY AND LITERACY. THEY SPEAK HUNDREDS OF LANGUAGES. TO GIVE OUR PATIENTS THE BEST EXPERIENCE POSSIBLE, WE USE ADVANCED TECHNOLOGY AND CONTINUOUS TRAINING. OUR GOAL IS TO HELP PATIENTS CLEARLY UNDERSTAND HOW BEST TO MANAGE THEIR CONDITION. STRATUS IS A VIDEO-INTERPRETING DEVICE USED FOR PATIENTS WHO ARE HEARING-IMPAIRED OR WHO HAVE LIMITED ENGLISH SKILLS. THERE ARE NOW OVER 250 STRATUS DEVICES ACROSS THE SYSTEM.

A COMMUNITY HEALTH NEEDS ASSESSMENT WAS CONDUCTED BETWEEN OCTOBER 2014 AND MARCH 2015 THAT IDENTIFIES THE NEEDS OF THE RESIDENTS SERVED BY GLH. AS A PARTNERING HOSPITAL OF A REGIONAL COLLABORATIVE EFFORT TO ASSESS COMMUNITY HEALTH NEEDS; GLH COLLABORATED WITH HOSPITALS AND OUTSIDE ORGANIZATIONS IN THE SURROUNDING REGION (INCLUDING JUNIATA AND MIFFLIN COUNTIES) DURING THE COMMUNITY HEALTH NEEDS ASSESSMENT PROCESS. THE FOLLOWING IS A LIST OF ORGANIZATIONS THAT PARTICIPATED IN THE COMMUNITY HEALTH NEEDS ASSESSMENT PROCESS IN SOME WAY: AREA AGENCY ON AGING, JUNIATA BEHAVIORAL & DEVELOPMENTAL SERVICES, JUNIATA COUNTY COMMISSIONERS, JV TRI-COUNTY DRUG & ALCOHOL, MIFFLIN COUNTY COMMISSIONERS, MIFFLIN COUNTY INDUSTRIAL DEVELOPMENT CORPORATION, MIFFLIN-JUNIATA SPECIAL NEEDS CENTER, PA OFFICE OF RURAL HEALTH, SACRED HEART CATHOLIC SCHOOL, STATE HEALTH CENTER, AND UNITED WAY OF MIFFLIN-JUNIATA. TRIPP UMBACH, HEADQUARTERED IN PITTSBURGH, PA, IS A RECOGNIZED NATIONAL LEADER IN CONDUCTING CHNAS, HAVING CONDUCTED MORE THAN 250 CHNAS OVER THE PAST 20 YEARS, WITH MORE THAN 50 HAVING BEEN COMPLETED WITHIN THE LAST 2 YEARS. TODAY, MORE THAN 1 IN 5 AMERICANS LIVE IN A COMMUNITY WHERE TRIPP UMBACH HAS COMPLETED A CHNA. PAUL UMBACH, FOUNDER AND PRESIDENT OF TRIPP UMBACH, IS AMONG THE MOST EXPERIENCED COMMUNITY HEALTH PLANNERS IN THE NATION, HAVING DIRECTED PROJECTS IN EVERY STATE AND INTERNATIONALLY. TRIPP UMBACH HAS WRITTEN TWO NATIONAL GUIDE BOOKS ON THE TOPIC OF COMMUNITY HEALTH AND HAS PRESENTED AT MORE THAN 50 STATE AND NATIONAL HEALTH CONFERENCES. THE ADDITIONAL TRIPP UMBACH TEAM BROUGHT MORE THAN 30 YEARS OF COMBINED EXPERIENCE TO THE PROJECT. KEY DATA SOURCES IN THE CHNA INCLUDED: CHNA PLANNING: A SERIES OF PLANNING MEETINGS WAS FACILITATED BY TRIPP UMBACH AND THE CHNA OVERSIGHT COMMITTEE, CONSISTING OF REPRESENTATIVES FROM GLH AND OTHER PARTICIPATING HOSPITALS AND ORGANIZATIONS (I.E., GEISINGER MEDICAL CENTER, GEISINGER HEALTHSOUTH REHABILITATION HOSPITAL, GEISINGER WYOMING VALLEY MEDICAL CENTER, GEISINGER COMMUNITY MEDICAL CENTER, GEISINGER-LEWISTOWN HOSPITAL AND GEISINGER-BLOOMSBURG HOSPITAL.) SECONDARY DATA: THE HEALTH OF A COMMUNITY IS LARGELY RELATED TO THE CHARACTERISTICS OF ITS RESIDENTS. AN INDIVIDUAL'S AGE, RACE, GENDER, EDUCATION AND ETHNICITY OFTEN DIRECTLY OR INDIRECTLY IMPACT HEALTH STATUS AND ACCESS TO CARE. TRIPP UMBACH COMPLETED COMPREHENSIVE ANALYSIS OF HEALTH STATUS AND SOCIO-ECONOMIC ENVIRONMENTAL FACTORS RELATED TO THE HEALTH OF RESIDENTS OF THE GLH COMMUNITY FROM EXISTING DATA SOURCES SUCH AS STATE AND COUNTY PUBLIC HEALTH AGENCIES, THE CENTERS FOR DISEASE CONTROL AND PREVENTION, COUNTY HEALTH RANKINGS, THOMPSON REUTERS, CNI, HEALTHY PEOPLE 2020, AND OTHER DATA SOURCES. TRENDING FROM 2012 CHNA: IN 2012, GLH COMPLETED A CHNA FOR THE SAME COUNTIES INCLUDED IN THE SERVICE AREA (JUNIATA AND MIFFLIN COUNTIES). TRIPP UMBACH DID NOT COMPLETE THE 2012 CHNA. AS A RESULT, THE DATA SOURCES USED WERE NOT THE SAME DATA SOURCES FROM THE 2012 CHNA. HOWEVER, TRIPP UMBACH PROVIDED DATA FOR THE SAME YEARS WHICH MADE IT POSSIBLE TO REVIEW TRENDS AND CHANGES ACROSS THE HOSPITAL SERVICE AREA. WHEN POSSIBLE, FINDINGS FROM THE PREVIOUS CHNA HAVE BEEN INCLUDED IN THE EXECUTIVE SUMMARY ""KEY COMMUNITY HEALTH PRIORITIES"". THERE WERE SEVERAL DATA SOURCES WITH CHANGES IN THE DEFINITION OF SPECIFIC INDICATORS, WHICH RESTRICTED THE USE OF TRENDING IN SEVERAL CASES. THE FACTORS THAT COULD NOT BE TRENDED ARE CLEARLY DEFINED IN THE SECONDARY DATA. INTERVIEWS WITH KEY COMMUNITY STAKEHOLDERS: TRIPP UMBACH WORKED CLOSELY WITH THE COLLABORATING ORGANIZATIONS TO IDENTIFY LEADERS FROM ORGANIZATIONS THAT 1) HAD PUBLIC HEALTH EXPERTISE; 2) WERE PROFESSIONALS WITH ACCESS TO COMMUNITY HEALTH RELATED DATA; AND 3) WERE REPRESENTATIVES OF UNDERSERVED POPULATIONS (I.E., SENIORS, LOW-INCOME RESIDENTS, LATINO(A) RESIDENTS, AND RESIDENTS THAT ARE UNINSURED). SUCH PERSONS WERE INTERVIEWED AS PART OF THE NEEDS ASSESSMENT PLANNING PROCESS. A SERIES OF 20 INTERVIEWS WERE COMPLETED WITH KEY STAKEHOLDERS IN THE GLH COMMUNITY, INCLUDING: AREA AGENCY ON AGING, JUNIATA BEHAVIORAL & DEVELOPMENTAL SERVICES, JUNIATA COUNTY COMMISSIONERS, JV TRI-COUNTY DRUG & ALCOHOL, MIFFLIN COUNTY COMMISSIONERS, MIFFLIN COUNTY INDUSTRIAL DEVELOPMENT CORPORATION, MIFFLIN-JUNIATA SPECIAL NEEDS CENTER, PA OFFICE OF RURAL HEALTH, SACRED HEART CATHOLIC SCHOOL, STATE HEALTH CENTER, AND UNITED WAY OF MIFFLIN-JUNIATA. SURVEY OF VULNERABLE POPULATIONS: VULNERABLE POPULATIONS WERE IDENTIFIED BY THE CHNA OVERSIGHT COMMITTEE AND THROUGH STAKEHOLDER INTERVIEWS. VULNERABLE POPULATIONS TARGETED BY THE SURVEYS WERE SENIORS, LOW-INCOME RESIDENTS (INCLUDING FAMILIES), AND RESIDENTS WITH SPECIAL NEEDS. A TOTAL OF 154 SURVEYS WERE COLLECTED IN THE GLH SERVICE AREA. TRIPP UMBACH WORKED WITH THE OVERSIGHT COMMITTEE TO DESIGN A 33 QUESTION HEALTH STATUS SURVEY. THE SURVEY WAS ADMINISTERED BY COMMUNITY BASED ORGANIZATIONS (I.E., MIFFLIN-JUNIATA SPECIAL NEEDS CENTER AND AREA AGENCY ON AGING) PROVIDING SERVICES TO VULNERABLE POPULATIONS IN THE HOSPITAL SERVICE AREA. COMMUNITY BASED ORGANIZATIONS WERE TRAINED TO ADMINISTER THE SURVEY USING HAND-DISTRIBUTION. SURVEYS WERE ADMINISTERED ONSITE AND SECURELY MAILED TO TRIPP UMBACH FOR TABULATION AND ANALYSIS. IDENTIFICATION OF TOP COMMUNITY HEALTH NEEDS: TOP COMMUNITY HEALTH NEEDS WERE IDENTIFIED AND PRIORITIZED BY COMMUNITY LEADERS DURING A REGIONAL COMMUNITY HEALTH NEEDS IDENTIFICATION FORUM HELD ON MARCH 12, 2015. CONSULTANTS PRESENTED TO COMMUNITY LEADERS THE CHNA FINDINGS FROM ANALYZING SECONDARY DATA, KEY STAKEHOLDER INTERVIEWS, AND SURVEYS. COMMUNITY LEADERS DISCUSSED THE DATA PRESENTED, SHARED THEIR VISIONS AND PLANS FOR COMMUNITY HEALTH IMPROVEMENT IN THEIR COMMUNITIES, AND IDENTIFIED AND PRIORITIZED THE TOP COMMUNITY HEALTH NEEDS IN THE GLH COMMUNITY. PUBLIC COMMENT REGARDING THE 2012 CHNA AND IMPLEMENTATION PLAN: TRIPP UMBACH SOLICITED PUBLIC COMMENTARY FROM COMMUNITY LEADERS AND RESIDENTS. COMMENTERS WERE ASKED TO REVIEW THE CHNA AND ACTION PLAN ADOPTED BY GLH IN 2013 AND WERE PROVIDED ACCESS TO EACH DOCUMENT FOR REVIEW. COMMENTERS WERE THEN ASKED TO RESPOND TO A QUESTIONNAIRE WHICH PROVIDED OPEN AND CLOSED RESPONSE QUESTIONS. THE PRIOR CHNA AND IMPLEMENTATION PLAN AND A QUESTIONNAIRE WERE OFFERED IN HARD COPY AT TWO LOCATIONS INSIDE THE HOSPITAL AND WERE ALSO PROVIDED ELECTRONICALLY USING A WEB-BASED PLATFORM. THERE WERE NO RESTRICTIONS OR QUALIFICATIONS REQUIRED OF PUBLIC COMMENTERS. FLYERS WERE CIRCULATED AND ELECTRONIC REQUESTS WERE MADE FOR PUBLIC COMMENT THROUGHOUT THE COLLECTION PERIOD.

Follow-up questions asked them to describe why they identified areas as such, and how these might be better addressed. After reviewing the Community Health Needs Assessment findings, the community representatives met on June 10, 2015 to determine the health needs to be prioritized for action. During a detailed presentation of the CHNA findings, the Hospital used an Audience Response System (ARS) technology to lead steering committee members through a process of understanding key local data findings (Areas of Opportunity) and ranking identified health issues against the following established, uniform criteria: Magnitude, Impact, Seriousness, Feasibility and Consequences of Inaction. From this exercise, the areas of opportunity were prioritized as follows by the committee: Mental Health, Nutrition, Physical Activity & Weight Status, Diabetes, Substance Abuse, Cancer, Heart Disease and Stroke.Part V, Section B, Line 7ahttps://midstatemedical.org/health-wellness/community-health-needs- assessment"

ONE OF THE TWO SESSIONS SPECIFICALLY TARGETED HOMELESS VETERANS. A TOTAL OF NINE FOCUS GROUPS WERE CONDUCTED IN A VARIETY OF LOCATIONS. COLLECTIVELY, THERE WERE 92 PARENT PARTICIPANTS OF WHICH 80% OF PARTICIPANTS UTILIZE MEDICAID BENEFITS. RECOGNIZING THAT THE NUMBER OF INDIVIDUALS WHO COULD BE REACHED THROUGH INTERVIEWS AND FOCUS GROUPS WAS INHERENTLY LIMITED, THE HOSPITAL ALSO SOUGHT TO REACH A SIGNIFICANTLY GREATER NUMBER OF COMMUNITY MEMBERS THROUGH AN ONLINE SURVEY. TO COMPENSATE FOR LACK OF INTERNET ACCESS AMONG SOME POPULATIONS, A PAPER VERSION OF THE SURVEY WAS DISTRIBUTED IN COMMUNITY HEALTH CLINICS, AT A MOBILE HOME COMMUNITY AND AT A CHILD CARE CENTER FOR LOW-INCOME FAMILIES. THE SURVEY WAS AVAILABLE IN BOTH ENGLISH AND SPANISH AND HAD A TOTAL OF 346 RESPONDENTS. SINCE MORE DEMOGRAPHIC INFORMATION WAS COLLECTED FOR THE PARENT SURVEY, WE WERE ABLE TO ANALYZE THE RESULTS IN A MORE IN-DEPTH MANNER. FIRST, AN ANALYSIS OF THE TOP-RATED ISSUES/CONCERNS WAS PERFORMED WITH DIFFERENCES NOTED BETWEEN THE ENGLISH LANGUAGE AND SPANISH LANGUAGE SURVEY RESPONSES. NEXT, WE SORTED RESULTS BY COUNTY AS WELL AS BY INCOME LEVELS TO DETERMINE SIGNIFICANT VARIATIONS IN THE ISSUES IDENTIFIED AS TOP CONCERNS. THIS APPROACH PERMITTED THE TEAM TO GAIN INSIGHT INTO A LARGE CROSS SECTION OF THE POPULATION. OVERALL, 42 PERCENT OF RESPONDENTS WERE ETHNIC MINORITIES AND CLOSE TO ONE-THIRD OF RESPONDENTS HAD HOUSEHOLD INCOMES OF LESS THAN $50,000 PER YEAR."

201823099349301287,840166760,"SCHEDULE H, PART V, SECTION B, LINE 11","THE FOLLOWING DESCRIPTION FOR SCHEDULE H, PART V, SECTION B, LINE 11 APPLIES TO ALL HOSPITAL FACILITIES INCLUDED IN FACILITY REPORTING GROUP A: AN INTERNAL LEADERSHIP COMMITTEE ESTABLISHED CRITERIA THAT WOULD BE USED TO ANALYZE THE DATA COLLECTED AND SELECT THE ISSUES THAT THE HOSPITAL WILL FOCUS ON FOR THE COMING YEARS. THOSE CRITERIA INCLUDE: SCALE THESE ISSUES TOUCH A LARGE NUMBER OF CHILDREN; IMPACT THESE ISSUES HAVE A SIGNIFICANT EFFECT ON CHILDREN; COMMUNITY INTEREST COMMUNITY MEMBERS EXPRESSED CONCERN ABOUT THESE ISSUES THROUGH THE VARIOUS CHANNELS WE USED TO GATHER INPUT; AND SUSTAINABILITY CHILDRENS HOSPITAL COLORADO HAS THE RESOURCES NEEDED TO ADDRESS THESE ISSUES. ONCE THE CRITERIA WERE ESTABLISHED, THE FINAL STEP IN THE PROCESS WAS TO PRESENT THE RESEARCH FINDINGS TO KEY STAKEHOLDERS AND ASK THEM FOR INPUT ON THE ISSUES THAT THE HOSPITAL WILL PRIORITIZE. TWO DIFFERENT PRIORITIZATION MEETINGS WERE HELD, ONE WITH REPRESENTATIVES FROM NONPROFIT, GOVERNMENT AND PUBLIC HEALTH AGENCIES, AND ONE WITH INTERNAL HOSPITAL LEADERSHIP. THERE WAS CLEAR CONSENSUS AMONG BOTH GROUPS THAT MENTAL HEALTH, OBESITY/NUTRITION/PHYSICAL ACTIVITY AND ORAL HEALTH WERE HIGH PRIORITIES. ALSO, FURTHER DISCUSSION WITH HOSPITAL LEADERSHIP LED TO THE CONCLUSION THAT SOME AREAS PRIORITIZED BY THE INTERNAL TEAM AND COMMUNITY (MEDICAL HOME, PARENT EDUCATION) ARE STRATEGIES FOR ADDRESSING KEY ISSUES. WHILE THESE STRATEGIES WILL BE CONSIDERED AS PART OF THE IMPLEMENTATION PLAN, FOR THE PURPOSES OF THE NEEDS ASSESSMENT, THEY WERE NOT INCLUDED IN THE LIST OF TOP PRIORITIES. WE ACKNOWLEDGE THAT THE COMMUNITY RAISED NUMEROUS OTHER CONCERNS AND THAT THE DATA SUPPORTS THE NEED TO ADDRESS A WIDE RANGE OF ISSUES. HOWEVER, WE BELIEVE THAT CONCENTRATING OUR EFFORTS IN THESE THREE KEY AREAS WILL HAVE THE MOST MEANINGFUL AND LASTING IMPACT. IT SHOULD BE NOTED THAT MENTAL HEALTH AND OBESITY WERE ALSO IDENTIFIED AS PRIORITIES IN THE 2012 CHNA, AND THE HOSPITAL HAS LAUNCHED PROGRAMS THAT ADDRESS THESE NEEDS AND WILL CONTINUE TO EXPAND OUR WORK IN THESE RESPECTIVE PRIORITY AREAS. IT IS ALSO IMPORTANT TO POINT OUT THAT IN ADDITION TO THE ABOVE IDENTIFIED PRIORITY NEEDS, THE HOSPITAL WILL SUSTAIN OUR CURRENT WORK ON THREE ISSUES THAT ARE CRITICAL TO THE LONG-TERM HEALTH AND WELLNESS OF CHILDREN IN OUR COMMUNITY: INJURY, PREMATURITY AND RESPIRATORY ILLNESS. THE ABOVE-MENTIONED PRIORITIES WERE IDENTIFIED IN THE CHNA AS DATA DRIVEN PRIORITIES. ONCE THE CHNA PRIORITIES WERE SELECTED, CHILDRENS HOSPITAL COLORADO DEVELOPED AND EMPLOYED SEVERAL STRATEGIES TO ADDRESS THE HEALTH CONCERNS IDENTIFIED IN THE 2015 COMMUNITY HEALTH NEEDS ASSESSMENT. THESE ACTIONS INCLUDED PARTNERING WITH COMMUNITY ORGANIZATIONS TO DEVELOP DATA-DRIVEN APPROACHES TO IDENTIFY TARGETED NEIGHBORHOODS AND POPULATIONS FOR PROGRAM IMPLEMENTATION, DEVELOPING THE THREE-YEAR IMPLEMENTATION PLAN TO GUIDE ACTIVITIES FOCUSED IN IDENTIFIED HEALTH PRIORITY AREAS, AND FORMALIZING THE MEASURES AND TRACKING MECHANISMS TO INFORM PROGRAM PLANNING AND MEASURE OUTREACH AND IMPACT. IN EARLY 2016, CHILDRENS HOSPITAL COLORADO PARTNERED WITH THE COLORADO HEALTH INSTITUTE TO DEVELOP A CHILD HEALTH SEVERITY INDEX TO IDENTIFY ZIP CODES WHERE YOUTH HAVE THE MOST SEVERE HEALTH CONCERNS. THE INTERACTIVE MAP WAS DEVELOPED WITH THE SIX PRIORITIZED HEALTH NEEDS IN MIND, AND HELPED PRIORITIZE WHERE THERE WAS THE GREATEST NEED AND OPPORTUNITIES TO ADDRESS THE PRIORITY HEALTH NEEDS. CHILDRENS USED THIS INDEX TO IDENTIFY THE INITIAL ZIP CODES TO TARGET PROGRAMMATIC EFFORTS AND DEVELOP THE APPROPRIATE PARTNERSHIPS WITHIN THE HOSPITALS URBAN CENTERS. WE WILL CONTINUE TO REFER TO THIS MAP WAS WE EXPAND OUR PROGRAMS INTO OTHER COMMUNITIES. CHILDRENS ALSO BEGAN A PARTNERSHIP WITH AURORA PUBLIC SCHOOLS (APS) TO PROMOTE COMMUNITY-BASED PROGRAMS AND SERVICES IN THE SCHOOL SETTING. THROUGH THIS PARTNERSHIP, CHILDRENS AND APS WILL BEGIN IMPLEMENTING PROGRAMS TO ADDRESS STUDENTS TOP HEALTH NEEDS, INCLUDING ORAL HEALTH AND MENTAL HEALTH-RELATED PROGRAMS AND SERVICES. IN MAY 2016, OUR THREE-YEAR IMPLEMENTATION PLAN TO ADDRESS THE SIX COMMUNITY HEALTH PRIORITY AREAS WAS FINALIZED AND APPROVED BY THE CHCO BOARD OF DIRECTORS. STRATEGIES IN THE REPORT WERE DRIVEN BY THE 2015 CHNA AND THE NEIGHBORHOODS WITH HIGH NEEDS IDENTIFIED THROUGH THE CHILD HEALTH SEVERITY INDEX. FOLLOWING THE IMPLEMENTATION PLAN, WE DEVELOPED OVER 80 MEASURES TO TRACK OUTREACH AND IMPACT OF EACH PRIORITY AREAS PROGRAMS AND INITIATIVES. OUR MEASURES WILL INCLUDE TRACKING THE VOLUME OF EDUCATIONAL WORKSHOPS AND TRAININGS, GROWTH IN COMMUNITY PARTNERSHIPS AND COLLABORATIONS TO EXPAND AND DEVELOP NEW PROGRAMS TO ADDRESS COMMUNITY HEALTH NEEDS, IMPROVED COORDINATION OF CARE AND COMMUNITY-BASED SERVICES AND SUPPORTS, IMPROVED ACCESS TO PROGRAMS AND SERVICES, AND CHANGES IN HEALTH OUTCOMES. MEASURES WILL CONTINUOUSLY BE TRACKED AND REVIEWED TO IMPROVE PROCESSES AND ENSURE THE PROGRAMS ARE MEETING THEIR INTENDED GOALS AND POPULATIONS. TO DATE, DATA HAS BEEN COLLECTED FOR 38 OF THE MEASURES (43%), 35 MEASURES ARE IN PROCESS (39%) AND 16 MEASURES ARE IN THE PLANNING AND/OR UNDER REVISION (18%)."

THE HOSPITAL IS AN ACTIVE PARTICIPANT IN THE FDRHPO'S NORTH COUNTRY HEALTH COMPASS PARTNERS (NCHCP), A COALITION OF MORE THAN 40 PUBLIC HEALTH DEPARTMENTS, HEALTHCARE FACILITIES AND AGENCIES, AND COMMUNITY-BASED ORGANIZATIONS WORKING TO IMPROVE THE REGION'S POPULATION HEALTH THROUGH COORDINATED SUPPORT OF NEW YORK STATE'S MANY POPULATION HEALTH IMPROVEMENT INITIATIVES. KEY WORK OF THE NCHCP IS TO ASSESS AND IMPROVE POPULATION HEALTH FOR THE 250,000 PEOPLE LIVING WITHIN THE TRI-COUNTY REGION, STRENGTHEN THE POPULATION HEALTH INFRASTRUCTURE, IMPROVE ACCESS TO PRIMARY AND PREVENTION CARE, AND FOCUS ON ELIMINATING HEALTH DISPARITIES. FDRHPO/NCHCP UNDERTOOK THE 2016 COMMUNITY HEALTH NEEDS ASSESSMENT. DATA ASSEMBLED FROM A VARIETY OF STATE, FEDERAL AND LOCAL SOURCES - INCLUDING A REGIONAL COMMUNITY SURVEY - WERE COMPARED AND EVALUATED TO IDENTIFY DISPARITIES AND SIGNIFICANT ISSUES IMPACTING REGIONAL, AS WELL AS COUNTY-WIDE, POPULATION HEALTH. THE 2016 CHNA FOR JEFFERSON COUNTY (SAMARITAN'S PRIMARY SERVICE AREA) WERE AS FOLLOWS: "" HIGH AND GROWING OBESITY RATES FOR ADULTS AND CHILDREN: TWO-THIRD OF ADULTS AND TWO-FIFTHS OF CHILDREN WERE IDENTIFIED AS OBESE OR OVERWEIGHT (2013-14 FIGURES). OBESITY IS A RISK FACTOR FOR HEART DISEASE, STROKE, CANCER IN MANY FORMS, DIABETES AND KIDNEY DISEASE, AND COULD OVERTAKE CANCER AS THE LEADING CAUSE OF PREVENTABLE DEATHS IN THE NEXT DECADE. "" HOSPITALIZATIONS FOR SHORT-TIME DIABETES COMPLICATIONS ALMOST DOUBLED BETWEEN 2011 AND 2014. "" THE CIGARETTE SMOKING RATE SHOWED A NON-SIGNIFICANT DECREASE SINCE THE LAST COMMUNITY ASSESSMENT, BUT REMAINS SIGNIFICANTLY HIGHER THAN THE NEW YORK STATE RATE. "" THE RATE OF COLORECTAL CANCER SCREENING REMAINED BELOW NYS TARGETS."" THE AREA'S SUICIDE RATE REMAINED HIGHER THAN STATEWIDE AND REGIONAL BENCHMARKS."" ADULTS REPORTING BINGE DRINKING GREW BY SIX PERCENTAGE POINTS BETWEEN 2011 AND 2014, WITH 2014 RATE MORE THAN 7% HIGHER THAN THE STATE RATE."" THE PERCENTAGE OF RESIDENTS SERVED BY OPTIMALLY FLUORIDATED COMMUNITY WATER SYSTEMS FELL FROM 79% TO 71% PERCENT BETWEEN 2012 AND 2015."" THE PERCENTAGE OF CHILDREN IN PUBLIC INSURANCE PROGRAMS WITH RECOMMENDED WELL-CHILD VISITS REMAINED LOWER COMPARED TO THE STATEWIDE AVERAGE, ALTHOUGH THE RATE FOR ALL AGE GROUPS INCREASED SIX PERCENTAGE POINTS."" DESPITE A SMALL DECREASE FROM 2011, THE 2014 PERCENTAGE OF UNINTENDED PREGNANCIES, AT 33% OF LIVE BIRTHS, REMAINED HIGHER THAN THE STATEWIDE AVERAGE OF 26.5%."" THE PERCENTAGE OF WOMEN AGED 13-17 WITH HPV IMMUNIZATIONS REMAINED LOW, WITH ONLY 15.9% IMMUNIZED COMPARED TO 30.3% FOR THE STATE EXCLUDING NEW YORK CITY."" ABOUT ONE-FIFTH OF JEFFERSON COUNTY RESIDENTS DO NOT HAVE A REGULAR HEALTH CARE PROVIDER. THIS IS HIGHER THAN THE STATEWIDE RATE OF 16%, AND WELL SHORT OF THE NEW YORK STATE'S PREVENTION AGENDA 2018 OBJECTIVE OF LESS THAN 10%. JEFFERSON COUNTY HAS FEWER PRIMARY CARE CLINICIANS PER POPULATION COMPARED TO THE STATEWIDE RATE.HOSPITALS AND COUNTY HEALTH DEPARTMENTS PARTICIPATING IN THE CHNA MET AT COUNTY LEVELS TO DISCUSS THE IDENTIFIED ISSUES AND PRIORITIZE NEEDS IN ALIGNMENT WITH THE NEW YORK STATE HEALTH DEPARTMENT'S PREVENTION AGENDA, CHOOSING SPECIFIC PRIORITIES TO MUTUALLY TACKLE. THESE COMMON PRIORITIES WERE THEN ADDRESSED BY EACH ORGANIZATION IN ITS OWN THREE-YEAR COMMUNITY SERVICE PLAN (CSP). IN DETERMINING WHICH PRIORITIES TO WORK ON, THESE COLLABORATING INSTITUTIONS CONSIDERED NOT ONLY THE ISSUES AND DISPARITIES, BUT THE IMPACT THESE DISPARITIES AND THEIR POSSIBLE SOLUTIONS MIGHT HAVE ON OTHER HEALTH OUTCOMES; AVAILABLE RESOURCES; EASE OF SOLUTION IMPLEMENTATION; LEADERSHIP SUPPORT AVAILABLE, AND IMPORTANCE TO THE PUBLIC HEALTH SYSTEM. ULTIMATELY, THOSE COMMUNITY NEEDS NOT DIRECTLY ADDRESSED IN THE COMMUNITY SERVICE PLAN WERE SIMPLY OF A LOWER PRIORITY, NOT ACHIEVABLE IN A REASONABLE TIMEFRAME OR DID NOT HAVE THE ADEQUATE RESOURCES AVAILABLE TO EFFECTIVELY IMPACT THE NEED. JEFFERSON COUNTY'S PUBLIC HEALTH DEPARTMENT AND THREE HOSPITALS AGREED TO WORK ON THE FOLLOWING TWO NYS PREVENTION AGENDA PRIORITIES DURING THE 2016-2018 CSP PERIOD: (1) PREVENT CHRONIC DISEASE, WITH A FOCUS ON REDUCING OBESITY IN CHILDREN AND ADULTS IN ORDER TO ADDRESS DISPARITIES RELATED TO HIGH OBESITY RATES AND DIABETES COMPLICATIONS AND (2) PROMOTE MENTAL HEALTH AND PREVENT SUBSTANCE ABUSE, WITH A FOCUS ON STRENGTHENING INFRASTRUCTURE ACROSS SYSTEMS, IN ORDER TO TACKLE DISPARITIES RELATED TO SUICIDE RATES AND SUBSTANCE ABUSE.SAMARITAN'S CSP OUTLINES THE FOLLOWING SPECIFIC ACTIVITIES, INTERVENTIONS AND STRATEGIES. TO REDUCE OBESITY, THE HOSPITAL WILL: (1) PROVIDE COMMUNITY-BASED NUTRITION EDUCATION AND HEALTHY COOKING DEMONSTRATION CLASSES TO THE PUBLIC THROUGH SAMARITAN'S NETWORK OF SEVEN COMMUNITY-BASED PRIMARY CLINICS LOCATED THROUGHOUT THE HOSPITAL'S SERVICE AREA AND (2) IMPLEMENT AN AMERICAN ACADEMY OF DIABETES EDUCATION-ACCREDITED DIABETES SELF-MANAGEMENT EDUCATION PROGRAM, OFFERING CLASSES TO DIABETES AND PRE-DIABETES PATIENTS AND THEIR FAMILY MEMBERS. TO STRENGTHEN BEHAVIORAL HEALTH INFRASTRUCTURE, SAMARITAN WILL: (1) SCREEN ALL PATIENTS AT EACH OF THE HOSPITAL'S SEVEN PRIMARY CLINICS AT LEAST ONCE ANNUALLY FOR DEPRESSION USING PHQ-2 AND PHQ-9 COMPONENTS OF THE PATIENT HEALTH QUESTIONNAIRE, AND ESTABLISH SCREENING, BRIEF INTERVENTION AND REFERRAL TO TREATMENT (SBIRT) PROCEDURES IN EACH CLINIC TO ENSURE PATIENTS ARE SCREENED FOR SUBSTANCE ABUSE RISK BEHAVIORS AND REFERRED FOR ADDITIONAL SERVICES AS NECESSARY AND (2) LOCATE A FULL- OR PART-TIME NYS-LICENSED CLINICAL SOCIAL WORKER (LCSW) IN EACH OF THE HOSPITAL'S SEVEN PRIMARY CARE CLINICS TO SUPPORT AND ASSIST MENTAL HEALTH PATIENTS AND THEIR FAMILIES.DURING 2017, PROGRESS WAS MADE ON THE ABOVE INITIATIVES AS FOLLOWS: -DIABETES SELF-MANAGEMENT EDUCATION WAS IMPLEMENTED ON A ONE-TO-ONE PATIENT BASIS BY A SAMARITAN DIETITIAN NEWLY ACCREDITED AS A CERTIFIED DIABETES EDUCATOR.-SOME 60 PATIENTS AND FAMILY MEMBERS PARTICIPATED IN A HEALTHY KITCHENS, HEALTHY LIVES COOKING CLASS, A CULINARY MEDICINE-INSPIRED SERIES DEVELOPED AND TAUGHT BY SAMARITAN PROVIDERS.-MORE THAN 15,000 PATIENTS WERE SCREENED FOR DEPRESSION DURING ROUTINE VISITS TO THEIR PRIMARY CARE PRACTITIONERS AT SAMARITAN FAMILY HEALTH CENTERS (SFHC). APPROXIMATELY 10% OF THESE PATIENTS SCREENED POSITIVELY FOR DEPRESSION, AND UNDERWENT A HIGHER LEVEL OF SCREENING, WITH SUBSEQUENT REFERRAL AS NEEDED FOR COUNSELING OR OTHER TREATMENT. -A LICENSED CLINICAL SOCIAL WORKER JOINED THE WATERTOWN SFHC STAFF, WORKING WITH PRIMARY CARE PATIENTS AND PROVIDERS TO PROVIDE SERVICES AND SUPPORT MENTAL HEALTH CARE AWARENESS. SAMARITAN IN 2017 ALSO ENGAGED IN THE FOLLOWING SPECIFIC INITIATIVES IMPACTING AREAS RELATIVE TO CHRONIC DISEASE PREVENTION, DETECTION, TREATMENT AND MANAGEMENT, AS WELL AS THE PROMOTION OF MENTAL HEALTH AND SUPPORT FOR RELATED SUPPORT AND TREATMENT PROGRAMS, AND THE REDUCTION OF SUBSTANCE ABUSE:-ENGAGED IN CANCER AWARENESS, PREVENTION AND EDUCATION THROUGH PARTICIPATION WITH STAFFED DISPLAYS AT MULTIPLE COMMUNITY EVENTS (HEALTH FAIRS, FARMERS' MARKETS, AND CANCER-RELATED FUND-RAISING AND AWARENESS EVENTS). MORE THAN 700 INDIVIDUALS VISITED SAMARITAN'S DISPLAYS AT EIGHT COMMUNITY AND HOSPITAL-HOSTED EVENTS, AND SAMARITAN PARTICIPATED IN THREE ADDITIONAL REGION-WIDE AWARENESS/FUND-RAISING ACTIVITIES.-EXPANDED THE HOSPITAL'S LOW-DOSE CT LUNG CANCER SCREENING PROGRAM, SCREENING 322 PATIENTS IN 2017, A 72% INCREASE OVER THE PRIOR YEAR'S NUMBER. THE SCREENINGS IDENTIFIED 98 SUSPICIOUS FINDINGS THAT WERE REPORTED TO PRIMARY CARE PROVIDERS FOR FOLLOW-UP. -ALL EIGHT OF SAMARITAN'S FAMILY HEALTH CENTERS - THE HOSPITAL'S NETWORK OF PRIMARY CARE OUTPATIENT CLINICS LOCATED THROUGHOUT ITS SERVICE AREA - ACHIEVED LEVEL III PATIENT CENTERED MEDICAL HOME (PCMH) RECOGNITION FROM THE NATIONAL COMMITTEE FOR QUALITY ASSURANCE, RESULTING IN SAMARITAN'S FULL TRANSITION TO THE PCMH MODEL OF CARE, WHICH PROVIDES PATIENTS WITH COMPREHENSIVE CARE COORDINATION AND MANAGEMENT THROUGH A TEAM APPROACH.-CONDUCTED A FREE HERNIA SCREENING OPEN TO THE PUBLIC.-RECEIVED A WAIVER FROM THE NEW YORK STATE OFFICE OF MENTAL HEALTH TO PROVIDE TELEPSYCHIATRY SERVICES FOR CHILDREN AND ADULTS. -HELPED TO PLAN AND PARTICIPATED IN A REGIONAL PUBLIC AWARENESS CAMPAIGN TO EDUCATE THE PUBLIC, BUILD UNDERSTANDING AND LESSEN THE STIGMA OF MENTAL ILLNESS AND SUBSTANCE ADDICTION. IN RELATED ACTIVITIES, THE HOSPITAL PARTICIPATED IN A ""KINDNESS ROCKS"" EXPRESSIVE THERAPY PROJECT, WHICH ENGAGED MENTAL HEALTH INPATIENTS AND OUTPATIENTS IN PROMOTING MENTAL HEALTH AWARENESS"

In its CHNA report, UHC has identified specific actions that the hospital has and will be taking to improve our community. These actions were developed, in part, through a survey where anyone could participate as well as a community meeting that was open to the public. Several organizations from local government, business, and non-profit organizations attended the community meeting. A few of these organizations were Harrison County Senior Center, Birth to Three and Health Check, Harrison-Clarksburg Health Department, Doddridge Health Department, Health Check, HealthSouth Mountainview, Harrison County Schools, Ritchie Regional Health Center, Community Care of WV, Harrison County EMS, Doddridge and Harrison County Family Resource Network, and American Cancer Society.

Several of the priorities identified in the 2016 CHNA are consistent with those identified in 2013, including cardiovascular disease, cancer, diabetes, and physical activity. Thus, resources identified in the 2013 CHNA may be relevant to address needs identified in 2016. Public outreach on the topic of cardiac risk identification and stroke symptoms was one solution to address this priority. Additionally, UHCs Cecil B. Highland and Barbara Highland Cancer Center offers a wide array of resources in addressing the physical and emotion needs of cancer patients and their families. Other organizations are also advertising their services to better serve the community in these priorities. Identified needs such as drug use and abuse not addressed directly by UHC are being addressed by various organizations within the area and UHC will work with these organizations to help address these needs. It was determined there was more need for more county-specific data around drug use and abuse so that law enforcement and the community could respond appropriately."

Elective procedures or cosmetic/plastic procedures may not be eligible to be covered under the financial assistance/charity care program. Financial assistance/charity care is predicated upon the completion of the Patient Financial Status Statement as well as the patient seeking Medicaid eligibility.

The principal investigatorprovided oversight to the surveying process including data collection andentry. Data was collected and entered using a web-based survey. Thisreport was compiled and verified for accuracy by members of the KanawhaCoalition for Community Health Improvement. This survey sample sizeresults in a statistically significant 95% confidence interval with anerror margin of plus or minus 5.73%. Not all respondents answered everyquestion; therefore the margin of error was adjusted and reported for eachquestion, based on the number of respondents. Numbers too small to bestatistically significant were noted as such. An independent samplingfirm randomly selected landline telephone numbers for Kanawha Countyhouseholds. The random landline sample consisted of 8,600 numbers whichwas screened for disconnects and businesses, resulting in a list of 4,568numbers. A total of 26 nursing students received training andadministered the phone survey. After learning that the number of Americanhomes with only wireless telephones continues to grow and 47.4% ofAmerican homes had only wireless telephones (January - June 2015 NationalCenter for Health Statistics Survey), the Kanawha Coalition attempted toincrease the number of responses among younger residents and lower incomeresidents, by doubling the acquired address based sample of householdswith only wireless phones. The wireless sample of 5,600 householdsreceived postcards in the mail directing them to the online survey or tocall the Kanawha Coalition to arrange a convenient time to take the surveyby telephone. The Kanawha Coalition process works to ensure that thesurvey sample size is valid, and that the sample is randomly selected. Italso ensured that the fourth-year nursing students with the University of Charleston's School of Nursing were adequately trained in how toadminister the phone survey. As with any telephone survey, there arecertain limitations. The result of the survey depends on the accuracy ofthe responses given by the persons interviewed. Self-reported behaviormust be interpreted with caution. To assure proper sampling distribution,the demographics of the survey respondents were compared to countydemographics based on 2010-2015 U.S. Census Quickfacts data. Thiscomparison reveals an over-representation of respondents who were female,over 55 years of age, widowed, had no children in the home and wereCaucasian. There was an under-representation of African Americans, peoplewith lower-educational attainment (high school or less), those withchildren in the home, and those who had never been married.Focus Groups:To understand community needs, focus groups were held throughout KanawhaCounty in November 2016. As one component of the Coalition's five-partassessment, focus groups offer insight into the needs, concerns andexperiences of people whose voice is not often heard. Typically, focusgroups are comprised of a small group of individuals, usually a vulnerableor target population. In this case focus groups were organized incommunities located in different geographical locations in the county. Itis important to note that the results reflect the perceptions of somecommunity members, but may not necessarily represent all community membersin Kanawha County. A series of six focus groups were convened.Participants received gift cards for their completion of the focus group.The purpose of the discussion was to obtain input on issues that couldimpact the health of the residents of their communities. A total of 51 community members participated in focus groups in the followingcommunities: Cross Lanes, Elkview, Kanawha City, Marmet, Miami andLondon, WV. The Kanawha Coalition provided training to fourth-yearUniversity of Charleston-School of Health Science's nursing students to enable them to facilitate the groups. The students also compiled the results and prepared reports of the findings for the Kanawha Coalition.Steering Committee:Steering Committee Members are from the CAMC, Thomas Health System, Highland Hospital, Charleston Area Alliance, Kanawha County Schools, WV Bureau for Public Health, Partnership of African American Churches and the Kanawha Coalition for Community Health Improvement and they serve in an advisory capacity for the Coalition. The Steering Committee follows a set of Guiding Principles as it promotes and safeguards the integrity of the collaborative process as each assumes the role of an equal partner in the process. They make tangible commitments of resources to the Coalition and believe that the process is the product and serves as the vehicle to put people together to explore and address challenges and opportunities to improve the health of the people of Kanawha County. The Steering Committee is committed to including all members of the community in the community health needs assessment process as it cultivates a community-wide sense of ownership, not organizational ownership. It provides encouragement and support to keep Coalition volunteers engaged and motivated while remaining flexible in its approach to meeting community needs. It believes in continuous quality improvement and supports an ongoing process to evaluate and improve outcomes and it celebrates successes along the way. Members of the Kanawha Coalition Steering Committee actively participate in the survey planning process to provide public health insight and ensure data integrity. Additionally, epidemiologists from the West Virginia Department of Health and Human Services work with the Coalition for question design for consistency with other surveys to allow benchmarks and comparisons. In addition, Key Informant Interviews provide in-depth information on the community. The Steering Committee also provides contact information for key informants in the community.Key Informant Interviews:The 87 key informants representing 20 different sectors or areas of expertise in the community were given both standardized questions and open ended questions designed to elicit a full range of responses. They were asked to identify the top three populations in Kanawha County with unmet needs and to share their biggest concerns in terms of health risk behaviors, clinical care, social and economic factors and the physical environment. They were also asked to share the challenges and barriers they believed exist and how best to overcome them.

Some of the ways CAMC Memorial, General, and Women and Children's Hospitals addressed the significant needs identified in its most recently conducted CHNA are included below:1.) One of the community need issues identified is Drugs (all types, does not include alcohol). We addressed this community need issue through the CAMC Ryan White Program. In 2017, there were 368 participants (an 11.8% increase) and we provided $61,622 in unreimbursed care. We also developed a satellite Ryan White Program Clinic in Beckley, Raleigh County when the provider serving those residents left the area. The new clinic is located in the Beckley-Raleigh County Health Department and services are provided via a combination of providers and telemedicine equipment. We also addressed this issue with the Drug Addicted Mother Baby Program. In 2017, 672 mothers were identified and participated in the program at CAMC Women and Children's Hospital. This was a 22% increase over the previous year.2.) Another community need issue identified is Diabetes. We addressed this community need issue with our Outpatient Diabetes Education Program and information available through our Health Information Center. We also provided community screenings via our annual Healthfest and Teddy Bear Fair health fairs. 3.) Obesity was addressed via our continued provision of Play Patch, a 940square feet children's play area that includes fruit and vegetable themedplay equipment along with a family restroom at the local shopping mall.It was also addressed via a financial donation to create a walking trailin the community of Pinch. 4.) Heart Disease/Hypertension/Heart Attack/Stroke wasaddressed via community education provided via the CAMC Mall Walkers, BLSTraining for the Community, CAMC Healthfest and the Physician Guest Lecture Programs. Health Screenings for heart disease were also providedat the CAMC Healthfest. In all, over 2,000 residents of the communitywere impacted by CAMC's outreach efforts.5.) Limited Access to Healthy Foods is addressed through our Local WealthCreation ""Value Chain program and our continued efforts to work with TheGreater Kanawha Valley Foundation to create and sustain a wealth creationvalue chain. This approach bridges conventional approaches to communityand economic development by using a systems framework, working with wealthcreation value chains. CAMC's 5 county primary service area is comprisedof 356,000 people with small increases in the size of the workingpopulation since 1990. 18% of people and 25% of children live in povertywith little improvement over of the past 10 years. The health connectionis that improvements in health care are associated with higherproductivity in the workforce and for the economy overall. The value chainpremises are that we need to be intentionally inclusive of local peopleand places as economic contributors to have a positive impact on wealth inour communities. This program's focus is on working with local growersto develop their capability to sell their produce to CAMC at a guaranteedquantity and price and once the process is established to roll it out toother ""buyers"". In 2017, we worked with over 100 individuals tocoordinate the number of growers providing fresh produce purchased by CAMCand to maintain and expand GAP certification.6.) Tobacco Use was addressed through ""Tobacco Free for Baby and Me"" cessation program for the 200 women who were identified as tobacco users in the CAMC Women's Medicine Center in 2017. The program had an 18.9% quit rate with quit validation (CO levels at non-smoker) at 72.5%. The program's quit rate continues to be above the National Quit Rate of 13%- 18%. A Certified Tobacco Treatment Specialist provides individual counseling four hours per week. The program Intake Form has been revised to compliment a research study on the usage of e-cigs in pregnant women. 7.) Lack of Access to Mental Health and Addiction Services was addressedthrough the Outpatient Mental Health Program offered through the CAMCFamily Resource Center. The program is for low income residents andserved 115 individuals in 2017.8.)

This intervention was selected based on observed mental health disparities in Central Brooklyn and multiple key stakeholders at community events requesting mental health interventions directly in the community, with one faith-based representative requesting the intervention by name. * The Screening, Assessment and Treatment Services recommended intervention for local action has been selected by IMC as the evidence-based intervention to address Promote Mental Health & Prevent Substance Abuse Priority Focus Area 2: Prevent Substance Abuse and Other Mental Emotional Behavioral Disorders. This intervention will promote the coordination of mental health practitioners with other care providers through the hospitals DSRIP-related programs and activities overseen by its Performing Provider System (PPS) that institutionalize the use of screenings such as the PHQ-9, DAST, and AUDIT through the Patient-Centered Medical Home (PCMH+) Initiative. This intervention was selected based on IMCs developing population health work with its Maimonides-led PPS: Community Care of Brooklyn. * The Nutrition Standards recommended intervention for local action has been selected by IMC as the evidence-based intervention to address Prevent Chronic Diseases Priority Focus Area 1: Reduce Obesity in Children and Adults. This intervention will increase the number of institutions with nutrition standards for healthy food and beverage procurement and was selected based on obesity, diabetes, and other nutrition-related illness surveillance data and community feedback (both in workgroups and listening sessions) on access to healthy foods. While several health issues, unhealthy behaviors, and social determinants of health that merit prioritization and action were identified through the CHNA, the hospital will not address the following issues specifically through its 2016-2018 CSP: * Angry Behavioral/Violence: the hospital is unable to single-handedly confront violence directly like law enforcement, but through mental health and substance abuse programs the hospital will address these issues. * Child Abuse: it is not the hospitals specialty to address child abuse directly like the Administration for Childrens Services, but through mandated reporter requirements for healthcare professionals the hospital will address this issue. * Domestic Violence: because of limited hospital resources IMC utilizes NYC and NYS public health resources like Partner Services to assess, aid, and address people in need of services."
