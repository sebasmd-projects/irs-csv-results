Participants were invited by the Glendale Hospital Collaborative, leveraging its extensive networks and relationships within the greater Glendale area and the Glendale Healthier Community Coalition. These stakeholders represented a broad range of geographic, public health, and population interest in compliance with the ACA. The goal of this component of the CHNA was to identify broad health outcomes and drivers (which, combined are health needs), as well as assets and gaps in resources, through the perceptions and knowledge of varied and multiple stakeholders. The CHNA included the collection of over 300 data indicators that helped illustrate the health states of the community. Secondary data were collected from a wide range of local, county, state, and national sources to present demographics, mortality, morbidity, health behaviors, clinical care, social and economic factors, and physical environment. These categories are based on the Mobilizing Action Toward Community Health (MATCH) framework, which illustrates the interrelationships among the elements of health and their relationship to each other: social and economic factors, health behaviors, clinical care, physical, environmental, and health outcomes.

This Implementation Strategy focuses on the priority health needs that will be addressed by USC Verdugo Hills Hospital through its community benefit programs and activities. They are: - Access to care - Cancer - Diabetes - Mental health - Overweight/obesity The Implementation Strategy adopted by USC Verdugo Hills Hospital actively addresses health needs that were identified in the CHNA as priority health needs. USC Verdugo Hills Hospital plans to meet the identified priority health needs through a commitment of resources with specific programs and services. For each health need the hospital plans to address, the Implementation Strategy describes: actions the hospital intends to take, including programs and resources it plans to commit, planned collaboration between the hospital and community organizations, and anticipated impacts of these actions. In addition to the specific strategies for the selected priority health needs, USC Verdugo Hills Hospital will investigate the development of a community grants program to provide financial and in-kind support to community organizations addressing these needs. Other health needs were identified but are not specifically addressed in the Implementation Strategy. These include: cardiovascular disease, geriatric support,communicable/infectious diseases, dental care, homelessness/housing, poverty, preventive wellness, STDs, substance abuse, transportation, and violence/injury. While these issues are addressed on a day-to-day basis in the normal course of operations, the hospital has chosen not to focus this Implementation Plan on these other needs as it believes that it can have a greater impact on the priority health needs that were selected. These other health needs are less aligned with the Hospitals strategic initiatives. Additionally, while some of these needs are not being directly addressed, it should also be noted that health needs can influence one another. For example, reducing weight and improving nutrition and physical activity have been shown to positively influence cardiovascular disease.

IN SHORT, THE WORKGROUP EXTENSIVELY REVIEWED THE NEW YORK STATE PREVENTION AGENDA WITH PARTICULAR INTEREST IN THE COUNTY LEVEL DASHBOARDS. THE CHIW GROUP EXAMINED AREAS IN WHICH MONROE COUNTY WAS IDENTIFIED AS WORSE THAN NEW YORK STATE AS A WHOLE OR IN WHICH MONROE COUNTY WAS NOT PREVIOUSLY ABLE TO MEET THE PREVENTION AGENDA TARGET. ADDITIONALLY, THE GROUP LOOKED FOR NEW OR EMERGING TROUBLESOME HEALTH TRENDS THAT MAY NOT HAVE BEEN IDENTIFIED AS A PREVENTION AGENDA TARGET. THIRTEEN AREAS OF PARTICULAR CONCERN WERE IDENTIFIED AND WERE PRIORITIZED ACCORDING TO WHERE THE COMMUNITY HAD THE GREATEST POTENTIAL FOR MAKING THE MOST IMPACT WITHIN THE 3-6 YEAR TIMEFRAME. THE FOLLOWING HEALTH NEEDS WERE IDENTIFIED AND PRIORITIES SELECTED: Tobacco Use Chronic Disease Care Childhood Health Unplanned Pregnancy Substance Abuse Additional areas of concern: Obesity STD morbidity Colorectal Cancer Adverse childhood experiences Violence Suicide Premature Birth Teen pregnancy INTERVENTIONS WERE PLANNED AROUND THE SELECTED AREAS OF TOBACCO CESSATION, CHRONIC DISEASE MANAGEMENT, CHILDHOOD HEALTH, UNPLANNED PREGNANCY AND SUBSTANCE ABUSE. THE OTHER AREAS OF CONCERN WERE NOT ADDRESSED IN THE IMPROVEMENT PLAN, PRIMARILY BECAUSE OF LIMITED RESORUCES, LACK OF FUNDING AND TIME, AS WELL AS AVOIDING ""MISSION CREEP"" FOR THE HOSPITALS. OBESITY, ALTHOUGH A MAJOR PROBLEM IN OUR COMMUNITY WAS NOT SELECTED BECAUSE THE CHIW WAS NOT CLEAR ON AN EFFECTIVE INTERVENTION GIVEN THE 3-YEAR IMPLEMENTATION PERIOD. COLORECTAL CANCER SCREENINGS ARE BEING ADDRESSED THROUGH THE CANCER SERVICES DEPARTMENT WITHIN THE CENTER FOR COMMUNITY HEALTH, AND ONLY IMPACTS A SMALLER SUBSET OF THE POPULATION. ADVERSE CHILDHOOD EXPRIENCES, VIOLENCE AND SUICIDE PREVENTION ALL CENTER AROUND MENTAL HEALTH WHICH IS THE PRIMARY FOCUS OF THE DSRIP INITIATIVE IN OUR COMMUNITY, AND VIOLENCE PREVENTION WAS THOUGHT TO BE BEYOND THE MISSION OF THE HOSPITALS AT THIS TIME. STDS, PREMATURE BIRTHS AND TEEN PREGNANCIES SOMEWHAT OVERLAP WITH THE UNPLANNED PREGNANCY PRIORITY AREA THAT WAS SELECTED. EDUCATION AROUND AVOIDING RISKY SEXUAL BEHAVIOR, AS RECOMMENDED TO ADDRESS UNPLANNED PREGNANCY, WILL ALSO IMPACT THESE AREAS OF CONCERN. OF COURSE, WITH UNLIMITED RESOURCES, WE WOULD ADDRESS ALL THESE AREAS, BUT UNFORTUNATELY WE NEED TO PRIORITIZE FOR THE GIVEN TIME PERIOD. THE HOSPITAL IS ADDRESSING THE SIGNIFICANT NEEDS IDENTIFIED IN THE 2016 CHNA THROUGH MANY INTERVENTIONS DESCRIBED IN THE IMPLEMENTATION STRATEGY. PROGRESS ON THE IMPLEMENTATION STRATEGY IS WIDELY AVAILABLE TO THE PUBLIC AND CAN BE FOUND ON THE SAME WEBSITE AS THE CHNA (https://www.urmc.rochester.edu/community.aspx). TOBACCO USE: IMPLEMENTATION EFFORTS CONTINUE SMOKING CESSATION, AT THE TIME OF THE CHNA 2016, UNIVERSITY OF ROCHESTER STRONG AND HIGHLAND WERE WORKING TO ADOPT AN OPT-TO-QUIT POLICY WHERE IDENTIFIED SMOKERS WILL BE AUTOMATICALLY REFERRED TO THE NY STATE QUIT LINE. EMR CHANGES WERE IN PROCESS AND THE POLICY HAS BEEN IMPLEMENTED AT STRONG AND HIGHLAND. THE OBJECTIVES FOR THIS FOCUS AREA INCLUDE: Objective 1.1: UR STRONG will enact a tobacco cessation policy that incorporates the ""opt-to-quit"" program and will implement that policy thereby electronically linking tobacco using patients to the NYS quit line. Objective 1.3: UR STRONG WILL WORK TO decrease the percent of women who smoke during pregnancy from 11% of births (2013 vital statistics) to less than 10% of births, and to especially concentrate on those women who receive Medicaid baseline 20% of births were smoking during pregnancy. UR STRONG AGREES WITH THE CONCEPT OF REFERRING ALL TOBACCO USERS TO THE NY STATE QUITLINE VIA THE EMR. IMPLEMENTATION EFFORTS FOR THE 2016-18 TIME PERIOD WILL INCLUDE ESTABLISHING THE EMR CHANGES, ASSURING PRIVATE TRANSFER OF DATA TO THE QUITLINE, ESTABLISHING FEEDBACK TO THE REFERRING PHYSICIANS AND EVALUATING THE INCREASE IN REFERRALS TO THE QUITLINE. UR STRONG IS ALSO ADDRESSING SMOKING DURING PREGNANCY BY LINKING PATIENTS WITHIN THE BABY LOVE PROGRAM WITH THE ""MOMMY AND ME TOBACCO FREE"" PROGRAM TO INCREASE CESSATION. CHRONIC DISEASE CARE: OUR WORK HERE FOCUSES ON HYPERTENTION CONTROL. TO ADDRESS BLOOD PRESSURE CONTROL, UR CONTINUES TO BE AN ACTIVE MEMBER OF THE ROCHESTER BUSINESS ALLIANCE (CHAMBER OF COMMERCE) HEALTH CARE PLANNING TEAM THAT MEETS WEEKLY AND IS FOCUSING ON HYPERTENSION. UR HAS MANAGED A COMMUNITY HEALTH WORKER PROGRAM THAT CONCENTRATES ON BLOOD PRESSURE CONTROL, CONTRIBUTES TO A REGIONAL REGISTRY OF HYPERTENSIVE PATIENTS, HELPS FUND IMPROVEMENT INITIATIVES, AND PARTICIPATES IN THE PRACTICE IMPROVEMENT CONSULTANT PROGRAM TO INCREASE CONTROL RATES. THE OBJECTIVES FOR THIS FOCUS AREA INCLUDE: Objective 2.1: By December 2018, decrease the disparity among hypertensive residents in the local registry who have their blood pressure in control by increasing the control rate among Monroe County African Americans [58.8% and Latinos (61.5%) compared to Whites (75.4%)] Objective 2.2: Increase the control rate for hypertensive patients who also have diabetes ADDRESSING DISPARITY IN HYPERTENSION CONTROL RATES WILL INCLUDE COLLABORATION WITH THE DSRIP CULTURAL COMPETENCY WORKGROUP AS WELL AS THE REGISTRY REPORTING FUNCTION. CHILDHOOD HEALTH: UR STRONG WILL BE WORKING TO IMPROVING CHILDHOOD HEALTH BY FOLLOWING THE APA GUIDELINE TO SCREEN ALL CHILDREN FOR FOOD INSECURITY AT WELL CHILD VISITS. THE OBJECTIVE FOR THIS FOCUS AREA IS: Objective 4.1: Decrease the percent of children living in food insecure households from 20.5% (Feeding America, 2014) while also striving to decrease the percent of adults who experienced food insecurity in the past year worried or stressed about having enough money to buy nutritious meals (EBRFSS2013-4) from 23% in Monroe County. AT LEASE ONE PEDIATRIC CLINIC IN STRONG IS CURRENTLY SCREENING FOR FOOD INSECURITY AND UR STRONG COMMITS TO ENHANCING THIS PROCESS WITH ACTIVE REFERRAL AS WELL AS EXPANDING THE MODEL TO OTHER CLINICS WITHIN UR AS WELL AS WITHIN OTHER HOSPITALS AND OFFICES IN MONROE COUNTY. WE WILL ALSO ASSURE THAT RESOURCES TO FOOD FOR FAMILIES WHO POSITIVELY SCREEN FOR FOOD INSECURITY ARE KNOWN AND ACCESSIBLE AND UPDATED. UNPLANNED PREGNANCY: THE CHIW AND UR STRONG ARE COMMITTED TO REDUCING THE UNPLANNED PREGNANCY RATE IN MONROE COUNTY AND TO ADDRESSING THE SIGNIFICANT DISPARITIES THAT EXIST BY RACE, ZIP CODE AND ECONOMIC STATUS. WE HAVE THE FOLLOWING OBJECTIVES: Objective 3.1: By December 2018, reduce significant barriers to the use of LARC (Long-Acting Reversible Contraception), particularly among at-risk women of reproductive age Objective 3.2: By December 2018, increase the number of youth reached with evidence-based sexual health education (baseline measure of current youth being reached is needed) PRIMARY TO THE BARRIERS TO THE USE OF LARC IS THE MEDICAID REIMBURSEMENT RULES IN NEW YORK THAT DOES NOT ACCOUNT FOR PLACEMENT OF LARC IN MEDICAID MANAGED CARE PARTICIPANTS (AT THE TIME OF THE CHNA/IMPROVEMENT PLANNING). UR STRONG IS COMMITTED TO CHANGING THIS RULE AND ASSURING THE MEDICAID CLIENTS CAN RECEIVE LARC AT DELIVERY IF DESIRED. OTHER BARRIERS TO BE ADDRESSED INCLUDE LACK OF EDUCATION AND LACK OF TRAINING ON INSERTION. IN ADDITION TO LOGISTICAL BARRIERS TO LARC, UNPLANNED PREGNANCY CAN BE REDUCED BY WORKING TO EDUCATE YOUTH IN OUR COMMUNITY AROUND SAFE SECURE HEALTH AND GOAL SETTING, ETC. UR AND THE CHIW WILL WORK WITH COMMUNITY AGENCIES, PARTICULARY THE METRO COUNCIL FOR TEEN POTENTIAL. SUBSTANCE ABUSE: UR STRONG WILL JOIN OTHER LEAD AGENCIES TO ADDRESS THE OPIOID EPIDEMIC PLAGUING OUR COMMUNITY. ADDRESSING THIS PROBLEM HAS MANY PREVENTION STRATEGIES FROM PREVENTING SUBSTANCE ABUSE TO DECREASING DEATHS DUE TO OPIOID OVERDOSE AND TREATMENT FOR THOSE WHO ARE ADDICTED. OUR OBJECTIVE FOCUSES ON DEATHS DUE TO OVERDOSE: Objective 5.1: By December 2018, decrease the number of deaths due to opioid overdose from 69 in 2015 (Medical Examiners report of 2015). THERE IS A MONROE COUNTY TASK FORCE ADDRESSING OPIOID MISUSE AND UR STRONG COMMITS TO SENDING REPRESENTATION TO THE TASK FORCE AND SUPPORTING ANY PLANS THAT COME FROM THAT GROUP OF EXPERTS. --------------------"

201821359349311892,530204707,HOWARD UNIVERSITY HOSPITAL,"Part V, Section B, Line 3j: In 2016, through the work of the District of Columbia Healthy Communities Collaborative (DCHCC), a comprehensive citywide Community Health Needs Assessment (CHNA) was initiated. The DCHCC represents a unique collaboration among Howard University Hospital and three area hospitals (Children's National Medical Center, Providence Hospital, and Sibley Memorial Hospital) and three Federally Qualified Health Centers (FQHCs) (Community of Hope, Unity, and Bread for the City). In response to its community commitment, current economic challenges, and new federal guidelines, DCHCC set forth to conduct a CHNA that summarizes and evaluates community health needs with attention to health status, health service needs, and the input of community stakeholders. The scope of this project also includes support for an innovative data-reporting website and tool that will engage many different stakeholders committed to improving health outcomes in the District of Columbia.The CHNA documents trends in health needs and health service use among District children and adults, with particular attention paid to differences by age, race/ethnicity, ward and hospital, where relevant. The findings are of interest to a range of District stakeholders invested in improving health and health care in the city. The report may also be of interest to health services researchers or health care planners interested in conducting a community health needs assessment to drive local health decision-making.DCHCC also supports an innovative data-reporting website and tool that will engage many different stakeholders committed to improving health outcomes in the District of Columbia. The CHNA and Community Health Improvement Plan has been published on this web portal. The community health needs assessment also includes illustrative maps/figures of assets and vulnerabilities related to specific health metrics, including but not limited to major outlet fast food locations per ward of the District, hospitals and primary care centers in the District, medically underserved areas in the District, and locations of primary care and mental health professionals shortage areas in the District. Providing this information will assist in overall data analysis, program planning and informed decision-making on important health-related issues affecting the residents of Washington, DC."
201821359349311892,530204707,HOWARD UNIVERSITY HOSPITAL,"Part V, Section B, Line 5: In conducting the most recent CHNA, input was received via four focus groups conducted with key stakeholders who are advocates or providers of health and social services. Two of the groups focused on health and health service issues. The other two groups focused on social determinants and related social service issues that impact health. There were a total of 30 focus group participants including hopsital patient advocates, case managers, Department of Health officials, and community-based health and social service stakeholders. Stakeholders were queried about a number of major issues, including what they viewed as priority health and social services needs for the city in general, the particular needs that were relevant to the populations they serve, and their specific recommendations for concrete steps that could be implemented to improve overall health and social services for residents."
201821359349311892,530204707,HOWARD UNIVERSITY HOSPITAL,"Part V, Section B, Line 6a: In the 2016 CHNA, we engaged with 300+ community stakeholders across a diverse cross section of DC spanning health and non-health disciplines. Using structured data collection tools, we probed stakeholders about their perspectives on health and well-being in DC, the facilitators and inhibitors to leading healthy lives, and their recommendations.Additionally, we hosted five focus groups with staff from 60 different community-based organizations and social service agencies. We also conducted two public town hall meetings that each drew about 80 participants. DC residents, community representatives, and health care providers completed 113 online surveys.The qualitative analysis revealed nine pressing community health needs: care coordination, food insecurity, place-based care, mental health, health literacy, healthy behaviors, health data dissemination, community violence, and cultural competency."

201821359349311892,530204707,HOWARD UNIVERSITY HOSPITAL,"Part V, Section B, Line 11: The DCHCC accepted the six top health issues- Sexual Health, Mental Health and Substance Abuse, Obesity/Overweight, Asthma, Access to Care, and Stress-Related Conditions - that emerged through analyses of quantitative data sources (including the Behavioral Risk Factor Survey, Youth Behavioral Risk Survey, hospital discharge data, American Community Survey, and US Census data) and qualitative data (input from community representatives obtained during stakeholder focus groups). Members of the DCHCC deliberated and decided access to care and stress-related conditions should not be addressed as independent priority issues as they are systemic issues that impact all of the other priority health areas. Thus, the implementation strategy (Community Health Improvement Plan) addresses the remaining four priority issues: Sexual Health, Mental Health and Substance Abuse, Obesity/Overweight, and Asthma. HUH adopted the DCHCC priority issues and added Cancer.In preparation for developing the implementation strategy, HUH conducted a series of internal meetings with experts to assess its capacity to address and prioritize the identified health areas based on organizational strategy. With the organizational capacity identified and sanctioned, HUH reconvened as part of the DCHCC process to develop the implementation strategy (Community Health Improvement Plan) as follows: conducted Gap and Strength, Weaknesses, Opportunities, and Threats (SWOT) analyses (for each health priority); prioritization of issues (to rank the health issues); creation of action plan; and monitoring of the action plan.DCHCC, with input from community stakeholders, developed a Community Health Improvement Plan (CHIP) to respond to the findings of the needs assessment. DCHCC conducted a community forum that provided an opportunity for health professionals, public and elected officials, non-profit organizations, academia, businesses, parents and families, and individual citizen-advocates to review the findings from the assessment. Forum participants then assisted with developing and supporting a citywide community health improvement plan that responds to the findings of the assessment.Each DCHCC member organization received approval of the implementation strategy (community health improvement plan) by their Board of Directors/Trustees. HUH received approval by its Board on September 22, 2016."
