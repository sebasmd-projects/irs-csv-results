If any of this information is not available, the pass-through entity shall provide the best information available to describe the Federal award. The subrecipient is advised of requirements imposed by governing laws, regulations, and provisions of contracts or grant agreements and supplemental requirements imposed by the pass-through entity. The subrecipient's activities are monitored to ensure awards are used for authorized purposes in compliance with laws, regulations, and the provisions of contracts or grant agreements and performance goals are achieved. Assurance is ascertained that any subrecipient expending $750,000 or more in Federal awards during the subrecipient's fiscal year must meet the audit requirements of Uniform Grant Guidance (formerly OMB A-133). A management decision on audit findings must be issued within six months after receipt of the subrecipient's audit report and ensure that the subrecipient takes appropriate and timely corrective action. A determination is made as to whether subrecipient audits necessitate adjustment of the pass-through entity's own records. Each subrecipient is required to permit the pass-through entity and auditors to have access to the records and financial statements as necessary for the pass-through entity to comply with this part. POST-AWARD SUBRECIPIENT MONITORING: The Principal Investigator (PI) or Program Director (PD) is responsible for monitoring the activities. The subrecipient should submit progress reports, technical reports and other deliverables to the PI/PD by specified due dates. The PI/PD is responsible for forwarding copies of the subrecipient's report(s) to the Office of Sponsored Programs and Research (OSPR). Subrecipient invoices submitted to the university must contain the following information: invoice on subcontractor's letterhead, date of invoice, invoice number, period of performance covered by the invoice, itemized description of services and backup documentation, current period costs including cost sharing, cumulative project costs and subrecipient contact person with respect to invoice. Invoice must be signed by an authorized official of the subcontractor and must contain a certification that all payments requested are for appropriate purposes and in accordance with the agreements set forth in the application and award documents. The PI/PD is responsible for reviewing and approving invoices from subrecipient(s) for adherence to the budget and submitting invoices for payment in Smart Buy Plus. Grant Accounting will review the subrecipient's invoice(s) for the following: period of performance is within the contract period, appropriate invoice format and level of detail, signature by authorized subrecipient representatives, evidence of cost sharing, if applicable, and availability of funding. Grant Accounting is responsible for ensuring that subrecipients that expend $750,000 or more of Federal funds each fiscal year submit an Audit Certification Letter. The following is required to close out a subrecipient award: receipt of final invoice, receipt of cost share documentation, if applicable, time and effort certifications, final progress and technical reports, annual audit certification letter. Grant Accounting is responsible for tracking payments made to individuals or organizations and where payments are sent when outside of the U.S. as required by the Schedules F and I - Form 990. EDUCATIONAL ASSISTANCE: Educational assistance is awarded based on financial need and merit. Need based assistance is awarded after review of the student's FAFSA, tax return information, W-2 statements, and other relevant financial documents. Students are required to maintain satisfactory academic progress in order to continue to be eligible for need based assistance. Students' Grade Point Averages and earned units are reviewed each academic year to ensure satisfactory academic progress is achieved.

FOR MOST US INSTITUTIONS OF HIGHER EDUCATION, PROVISION OF FINANCIAL AID TO STUDENTS IS AN IMPORTANT ACTIVITY ENABLING QUALIFIED STUDENTS TO OBTAIN A COLLEGE EDUCATION AT THE UNDERGRADUATE, GRADUATE OR POSTDOCTORAL LEVEL. STANFORD IS COMMITTED TO A ""NEED-BLIND"" ADMISSION POLICY FOR US CITIZENS AND PERMANENT RESIDENTS; IT ADMITS QUALIFIED STUDENTS WITHOUT REGARD TO THEIR ABILITY TO PAY, AND PROVIDES A COMPREHENSIVE FINANCIAL AID PROGRAM FOR ALL ADMITTED STUDENTS WHO HAVE UNIVERSITY-COMPUTED NEED, AND WHO MEET STATED FINANCIAL AID ELIGIBILITY REQUIREMENTS. FOR THE FISCAL YEAR ENDED AUGUST 31, 2017 (FY 2017), 46% OF UNDERGRADUATE AND ABOUT 78% OF GRADUATE STUDENTS RECEIVED SOME FORM OF FINANCIAL AID, WITH A TOTAL OF $445,543,529 OF FINANCIAL AID DISBURSED TO ALL STANFORD STUDENTS. APPROXIMATELY 64% OF THIS AID TOOK THE FORM OF TRANSFERS FROM INTERNAL UNIVERSITY FUNDS (OFTEN PER DONOR TERMS) TO OFFSET TUITION AND OTHER UNIVERSITY CHARGES THAT WOULD OTHERWISE HAVE BEEN RECEIVED BY THE UNIVERSITY. THE BALANCE OF $158,692,206 REPRESENTS DISBURSEMENTS, PRIMARILY TO GRADUATE STUDENTS, FOR STIPENDS, FELLOWSHIPS AND OTHER STUDENT AID IN SUPPORT OF ACADEMIC EFFORT. GRANTS TO ORGANIZATIONS ARE PRIMARILY IN THE FORM OF RESEARCH SUB-AWARDS.
