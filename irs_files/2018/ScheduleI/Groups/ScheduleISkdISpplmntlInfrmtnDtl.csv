It shall be the policy of The Curtis Institute of Music that no prospective student who has been accepted for study will be unable to attend because of financial need. Similarly, it shall also be the policy of Curtis that no currently enrolled student would have to leave school because of unmet financial need. In practice, this shall mean that Curtis will determine what is a realistic level of financial need based upon then-prevailing costs for living expenses in Philadelphia and the experience of other Curtis students. (It is of course possible that some prospective or currently enrolled students may choose not to accept the proffered package of financial aid for a variety of reasons). 2. In fulfillment of the above commitment, Curtis shall review each student's request for financial aid. Where appropriate and necessary, Curtis may make adjustments to the stated level of need (to correspond with actual living expenses in Philadelphia and with the experience of other Curtis students) and/or the requested level of assistance. Thereafter, Curtis will be prepared to make available a financial aid package that is fully responsive to the adjusted level of financial need. Based upon experience, however, initial financial aid awards to both prospective and continuing students shall be targeted at approximately 80% of the adjusted level of need, with the explicit invitation for aid recipients to reapply for further financial aid should that prove necessary. Students may reapply for financial aid at any time during the course of the academic year. 3. When deciding upon a financial aid package, Curtis shall expect all students to first take full advantage of sources of financial assistance other than The Curtis Institute of Music. Only after assurance that all other sources have been fully explored and utilized, will Curtis's own financial aid resources be incorporated into the financial aid package. (The mix between outside sources of financial aid, Curtis's own resources, and outside employment may vary from student to student, reflecting unique circumstances applicable to each student.) 4. Supplemental financial assistance for students attending The Curtis Institute of Music is awarded in the following sequence: Pell grants, loans, on-campus employment, lab/opera orchestra, Curtis supplemental grants. 5. Students who require supplemental financial assistance for living expenses are expected to contribute to their own educational financing by taking low-interest loans. Accordingly, loans are the next level of funding after Pell grants to be awarded in a financial assistance package. 6. When it comes to determining the use of Curtis's own financial aid resources, all financial aid packages will include on-campus employment for eligible students. Recipients of Curtis's own financial aid resources will be expected to perform on-campus employment up to the maximum permissible number of hours per week of such employment as determined by Curtis. 7.

Baylor's Financial Aid Office reviews the students' cumulative grade point averages every year and awards/reviews academic scholarships and fellowships if the required grade point average level is satisfied. Scholarships for financial need are awarded annually based upon whether the need criterion/level is established or maintained per the completed Application for Federal Student Aid. The scholarship awards that are included in the cost of attendance are reviewed so as not to exceed the cost of a student to attend the University. Scholarships and/or fellowships are also awarded to cover student emergency situations. Students must complete an application describing the emergency situation. The University reviews each application to determine if such scholarships/fellowships will be awarded. Travel Grants - Travel grants are awarded to students to offset travel expenses used for educational purposes such as attending a conference, presenting a paper, etc. The awarding of travel grants is based upon an application process and meeting a set of criteria that establish the benefits to the students' educational endeavors. Research Grants - The Office of the Vice Provost for Research (OVPR) publishes guidelines for each of the internal grant programs that provide the general conditions of the award, as well as guidance on the expenses that may be charged to the award. Each grant is set up as a separate project in the University's financial system based on the award amount and budget categories approved by the OVPR and administered through the Office of Sponsored Programs. The financial system provides real time access to a Budget Summary Report for the project that provides a comparison of budgeted expenditures to cumulative actual expenditures by expenditure category. This report can be accessed by the Project Manager and others with administrative and financial oversight responsibilities. Expenditure transactions under internal grant programs are subject to internal controls for approval and processing similar to other University expenditure transactions. The system does not allow expenditures to be processed in excess of or outside of the approved budget categories. Student Awards - These awards are provided to students for winning educational competitions. The purpose of the competitions is to further the education of students. Grants and Other Assistance to Governments and Organizations in the United States: The University enters into a contract with the grant recipient that describes the recipient's responsibilities for the use of the grant funds. Under the terms of the contract, recipients are required to submit quarterly and final written progress reports to the principal investigator (""PI"") or project director for the grant, and funds are paid to the recipient on a cost reimbursable basis. When the grant recipient submits an invoice for reimbursement, the PI reviews the invoice to ensure the expenditures are consistent with the established budget and with the work completed to date, prior to approving the amount for payment. Grant recipients subject to the U.S. Office of Management and Budget Circular A-133 Audits of States, Local Governments, and Non-Profit Organizations are also required to provide certification of their compliance with the financial audit requirements of those guidelines prior to receiving funds. Thereafter, the University requires an annual certification of continuing compliance and a copy of their most recent audit report. If any of the above processes indicate an area of concern, site visits may be conducted by the University to review the programmatic and/or financial records. Charitable organizations that receive contributions from the University are carefully selected and must be approved through the Chief of Staff to the President & Vice President for Board Relations. Student organizations that are provided University grants must complete an application describing the need for the grant. University contributions must support the University's interest and be consistent with the University's core values."

The AMDA Grant is a tuition credit given by AMDA in the amounts of $1,000 to $4,000. The determination of the amount is calculated utilizing the student's EFC (Estimated Family Contribution) outlined in their SAR (Student Aid Report) which is based on their FAFSA information. Student's with an EFC from zero to 15,000 will receive some type of AMDA Grant. Applicants: Every applicant is reviewed for eligibility for the AMDA Grant when the applicant is being packaged. This occurs upon receipt of the applicant's SAR (Student Aid Report), which is generated by the US Department of Education after the student has completed their FAFSA. The review of AMDA Grant eligibility and packaging is done by the Financial Aid staff member that is responsible for the packaging and management of the incoming student population for that respective campus. Currently Enrolled Students: Each student who is currently enrolled is reviewed for eligibility for the AMDA Grant when the student is being packaged at the beginning of each new academic year.

The Associate Dean for Students and Admissions and The Office of Admissions communicate the availability of the scholarships, process the applications and determine which applicants have qualified based on information provided by the Registrar's office for those awarded on the basis of academic performance. Additionally for those that are donor-funded, a Committee established by the School may be called upon to determine which applicants qualify based on donor-requirements. Once awarded, the scholarships are posted to the individual students' accounts. The Financial Aid Office maintains records of scholarship awards and ensures that these are factored into the calculation of how much federally funded financial aid each student is eligible to receive. After the initial award letters are sent out, additional scholarships may be awarded. The posting of additional scholarships triggers a re-evaluation of the student's eligibility for federally funded student loans, which may result in adjustments to the student's loan awarded. A copy of the grant agreement is maintained at the School unit and the Business office. The School unit that applied for the grant is primarily responsible for compliance with the grant agreement.
