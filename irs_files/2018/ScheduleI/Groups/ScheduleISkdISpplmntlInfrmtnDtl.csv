Financial aid from the University and other sources is viewed only as supplementary to the efforts of the student and the student's family. Students requesting financial aid are expected to contribute toward their educational expenses through summer or university employment and/or loans in any reasonable combination. Financial aid is an important factor for many students, and 100 percent of eligible Manchester University students receive some combination of grants, scholarships, loans, and work.

Manchester University utilizes an awarding matrix based on a combination of academic and financial need criteria referenced above. Student Financial Services administers financial aid from federal, state, and institutional resources utilizing the federal guidelines established by the U.S. Department of Education. The following steps must be taken by a student to receive a financial aid package from Manchester University: 1. Apply for admission and be admitted to Manchester University. Eligibility for academic scholarships from the University is determined through the admission process. 2. Submit a FAFSA. Eligibility for federal, state and institutional need based grants and loans is determined through this process. The student must designate the results be sent to Manchester University, and Indiana students must have a receipt date between Oct.1 and April 15 to be considered for state grant eligibility. 3. Submit any additional documentation requested by Student Financial Services. Enrollment Requirements. Students receiving financial aid must maintain full-time enrollment (a minimum of 12 semester hours) in each of the fall and spring semesters. There are circumstances in which part-time students demonstrating need may be awarded financial aid depending on the guidelines and availability of federal, state and institutional funding. Part-time students must enroll in a minimum of six hours to maintain eligibility for institutional funds and loans. Degree Requirements.

After the initial award letters are sent out, additional scholarships may be awarded. The posting of additional scholarships triggers a re-evaluation of the student's eligibility for federally funded student loans, which may result in adjustments to the student's loan awarded.
