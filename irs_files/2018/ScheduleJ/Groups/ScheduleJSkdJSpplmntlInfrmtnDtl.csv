The CORD Committee maintains a roster of disqualified persons, as defined by the IRS, for whose compensation the procedure is used. The roster is reviewed periodically but at least annually. The procedure was last discussed with the full board in March 2011. The procedure requires three elements as follows: 1) The terms of transactions are approved by the organization's governing body, or a committee thereof, whose members have no conflict of interest with respect to the arrangement. The Board of Trustees delegated authority to the CORD Committee to act on behalf of the Board in these matters at its meeting on March 25, 1999. Compensation arrangements are reviewed and approved by the CORD Committee before the effective date. Members of the CORD Committee recuse themselves from any vote in which there is a potential or actual conflict of interest. 2) The governing body or committee obtains and relies upon appropriate, comparable data before making its determination. Rice participates in the annual survey by Willis Towers Watson of select universities' executive compensation, and additional appropriate peer surveys. These reports reflect executive compensation in universities of a stature similar to that of Rice, and with which Rice competes for faculty and staff. The CORD Committee may also seek and rely on other relevant information, including compensation paid by other taxable and tax-exempt organizations for functionally comparable positions, geographic market forces, and actual written offers from similar institutions competing for services. The CORD Committee relies on this data and documents any determinations that reasonable compensation is an amount more than the range of comparable data. 3) The governing body or committee adequately documents the basis for making determinations concurrently with making decisions. Minutes documenting the deliberations of the CORD Committee are prepared contemporaneously for review and approval at its next meeting."

As the University's principal fund-raiser, the President entertains actual or potential benefactors, visiting dignitaries and community leaders in the residence.

Compensation and benefits provided to this individual are determined pursuant to policies, procedures, and processes of AHSSHC that are designed to ensure compliance with the intermediate sanctions laws as set forth in IRC Section 4958. AHSSHC has taken steps to ensure that processes are in place to satisfy the rebuttable presumption of reasonableness standard as set forth in Treasury Regulation 53.4958-6 with respect to its active executive-level positions. The AHSSHC Board Compensation Committee (the Committee) serves as the governing body for all executive compensation matters. The Committee is composed of certain members of the Board of Directors (the Board) of AHSSHC. Voting members of the Committee include only individuals who serve on the Board as independent representatives of the community, who hold no employment positions with AHSSHC and who do not have relationships with any of the individuals whose compensation is under their review that impacts their best independent judgment as fiduciaries of AHSSHC. The Committee's role is to review and approve all components of the executive compensation plan of AHSSHC. As an independent governing body with respect to executive compensation, it should be noted that the Committee will often confer in executive sessions on matters of compensation policy and policy changes. In such executive sessions, no members of management of AHSSHC are present. The Committee is advised by an independent third party compensation advisor. This advisor prepares all the benchmark studies for the Committee. Compensation levels are benchmarked with a national peer group of other not-for-profit healthcare systems and hospitals of similar size and complexity to AHS and each of its affiliated entities. The following principles guide the establishment of individual executive compensation: - The salary of the President/CEO of AHS will not exceed the 40th percentile of comparable salaries paid by similarly situated organizations; and - Other executive salaries shall be established using market medians. The compensation philosophy, policies, and practices of AHSSHC are consistent with the organization's faith-based mission and conform to applicable laws, regulations, and business practices. As a faith-based organization sponsored by the Seventh-day Adventist Church (the Church), AHSSHC's philosophy and principles with respect to its executive compensation practices reflect the conservative approach of the Church's mission of service and were developed in counsel with the Church's leadership."

In recognition of the contribution that each executive makes to the success of AHS, AHS provides to eligible executives participation in the AHS Executive FLEX Benefit Program (the Plan). The purpose of the Plan is to offer eligible executives an opportunity to elect from among a variety of supplemental benefits, including deferred compensation benefits taxable under Internal Revenue Code (IRC) Section 457(f), to individually tailor a benefits program appropriate to each executive's needs. The Plan provides eligible participants a pre-determined benefits allowance credit that is equal to a percentage of the executive's base pay from which is deducted the cost of mandatory and elective employee benefits. The pre-determined benefits allowance credit percentage is approved by the AHSSHC Board Compensation Committee, an independent committee of the Board of Directors of AHSSHC. Any funds that remain after the cost of mandatory and elective benefits are subtracted from the annual pre-determined benefits allowance are contributed, at the employee's option, to either an IRC 457(f) deferred compensation account or to an IRC 457(b) eligible deferred compensation plan. Upon attainment of age 65, all previous 457(f) deferred amounts are paid immediately to the participant and any future employer contributions are made quarterly from the Plan directly to the participant. The Plan documents define an employee who is eligible to participate in the Plan to generally include the Chief Executive Officers of AHS entities and Vice Presidents of all AHS entities whose base salary is at least $236,000. The Plan provides for a class year vesting schedule (2 years for each class year) with respect to amounts accumulated in the executive's 457(f) deferred compensation account. Distributions could also be made from the executive's 457(f) deferred compensation account upon attainment of age 65 or upon an involuntary separation. The account is forfeited by the executive upon a voluntary separation. In addition to the Plan, AHS has instituted a defined benefit, non-tax-qualified deferred compensation plan for certain executives who have provided lengthy service to AHS and/or to other Seventh-day Adventist Church hospitals or health care institutions. Participation in the plan is offered to AHS executives on a prorata schedule beginning with 20 years of service as an employee of AHS and/or another hospital or health care institution controlled by the Seventh-day Adventist Church and who satisfy certain other qualifying criteria. This supplemental executive retirement plan (SERP) was designed to provide eligible executives with the economic equivalent of an annual income beginning at normal retirement age equal to 60% of the average of the participant's three, five or seven highest years of base salary from AHS active employment inclusive of income from all other Seventh-day Adventist Church healthcare employer-financed retirement income sources and investment income earned on those contributions through social security normal retirement age as defined in the plan. The number of years included in highest average compensation is determined by the individual's year of entry to the SERP and by the individual's year of entry to the AHS Executive FLEX Benefit Program.
