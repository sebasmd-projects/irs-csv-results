Compensation for 2016 of these upper level executives includes the payout of an annual incentive plan and a long-term incentive plan. This performance-oriented program conditions payments upon the achievement of multiple individual and group performance measures. Measures to monitor performance include: operational and financial strength, patient quality and safety, patient satisfaction, advancement of patient care, and people development and partnership. Incentive awards may only be granted if the organization achieves a financial surplus. Even if all relevant performance measurements are achieved, the NYP Board of Trustees retains full discretion to make or not make any incentive awards, or to reduce the amount of any incentive award. This initiative is critical to assuring that NYP has the requisite leadership to create and manage a highly motivated and engaged workforce, to drive superior performance throughout the organization and to achieve top tier medical center status. As a separate matter, due to restrictions imposed by the Internal Revenue Code, upper level executives are limited in the amount of benefits received under a tax-qualified retirement plan. Like many employers, NYP supplements these executives' pension benefits through a supplemental (""nonqualified"") retirement plan. The supplemental executive retirement plan (SERP) is subject to a multi-year vesting requirement (commencing after five years of participation in the SERP, in prorated amounts through age 65) which places an executive's supplemental retirement benefit at risk of forfeiture if the vesting requirements are not satisfied. Once vested, however, provisions of the Internal Revenue Code require that the vested executive include in current income the value of his or her vested supplemental retirement benefit. Notwithstanding the legal requirement to recognize the vested value of the supplemental retirement benefit as current income, the supplemental retirement benefit will not be distributed to the executive until the executive actually retires from NYP (although, as permitted by the Internal Revenue Code, the supplemental retirement plan will effect a distribution of an amount necessary to satisfy the executive's tax liability resulting from the income recognition upon vesting). As noted, this supplemental retirement benefit will not be distributed to the executive until the executive actually retires from NYP. There are constantly changing legal, tax, accounting, and public disclosure rules for a SERP (supplemental executive retirement plan) in not-for-profit organizations. The executive Compensation Committee continuously monitors these changes and incorporates any changes into the overall SERP plan design. As in past years, the executive Compensation Committee of NYP requires a third party complete a review of the organization's compensation program to ensure its effectiveness in terms of government regulations, market conditions and the need to continually elevate organizational performance. The report also serves to meet the regulatory obligations to ensure that all elements of the executive compensation programs are reasonable. The individuals listed in part VII that are compensated by New York and Presbyterian Hospital devote an average of sixty hours per week to perform their responsibilities for the New York and Presbyterian Hospital and other related organizations in the aggregate. Additionally, NewYork-Presbyterian/Brooklyn Methodist supplements their executives pension benefits through a supplemental (""nonqualified"") retirement plan. The supplemental executive retirement plan (SERP) is subject to a multi-year vesting requirement (commencing after three years of participation in the SERP, in prorated amounts through age 65) which places an executive's supplemental retirement benefit at risk of forfeiture if the vesting requirements are not satisfied. If the participant performs continuous, uninterrupted substantial service for the hospital through each applicable vesting date, the balance then credited to the participants account and in which the participant shall become vested on such vesting date shall be paid to the participant in a single sum within sixty (60) days following the vesting date. During 2016, Mr. Mark Mundy received distributions from his full vested employer funded deferred compensation plan. In connection with his retirement at the end of 2016 the liquidation of his executive option plan resulted in a payment of $4,280,050. There was an additional distribution in the amount of $207,293 from the SERP. Part I, Line 4A: Severance Pay: Stanley Sherbell received severance Pay 304,077.

The procedure is designed to comply with the requirements of Section 4958 of the Internal Revenue Code and Internal Revenue Service regulations. The CORD Committee maintains a roster of disqualified persons, as defined by the IRS, for whose compensation the procedure is used. The roster is reviewed periodically but at least annually. The procedure was last discussed with the full board in March 2011. The procedure requires three elements as follows: 1) The terms of transactions are approved by the organization's governing body, or a committee thereof, whose members have no conflict of interest with respect to the arrangement. The Board of Trustees delegated authority to the CORD Committee to act on behalf of the Board in these matters at its meeting on March 25, 1999. Compensation arrangements are reviewed and approved by the CORD Committee before the effective date. Members of the CORD Committee recuse themselves from any vote in which there is a potential or actual conflict of interest. 2) The governing body or committee obtains and relies upon appropriate, comparable data before making its determination. Rice participates in the annual survey by Willis Towers Watson of select universities' executive compensation, and additional appropriate peer surveys. These reports reflect executive compensation in universities of a stature similar to that of Rice, and with which Rice competes for faculty and staff. The CORD Committee may also seek and rely on other relevant information, including compensation paid by other taxable and tax-exempt organizations for functionally comparable positions, geographic market forces, and actual written offers from similar institutions competing for services. The CORD Committee relies on this data and documents any determinations that reasonable compensation is an amount more than the range of comparable data. 3) The governing body or committee adequately documents the basis for making determinations concurrently with making decisions. Minutes documenting the deliberations of the CORD Committee are prepared contemporaneously for review and approval at its next meeting."

David Martin and Jan Martin have not received any meaningful retirement benefits provided by AMDA during their entire respective careers. David Martin has been President of AMDA for 49 years; Jan Martin has been the Executive Director for AMDA for 43 years. The Martins' journey of devotion to AMDA began when they personally and financially rescued the struggling drama school in Greenwich Village in the 1970s, which at the time had only forty students. The AMDA Community has grown to over 2,000 people, with over 1,500 full-time students from every state in the U.S. and numerous international countries. David Martin and Jan Martin's success has included reaching significant goals for AMDA; they have ensured AMDA's financial legacy and future stability through a strategic plan which has included multiple purchases of commercial real estate holdings and consistent increases in AMDA's annual revenue. Currently, AMDA's real estate holdings are valued at over $150 Million Dollars and AMDA has annual revenue of over $60 Million Dollars. In 2003, the Martins founded a second sister campus in Hollywood, AMDA Los Angeles, which, under their leadership has thrived and grown rapidly to become a fully operational successful college, offering multiple Bachelor of Fine Arts Degrees. The AMDA community has been and will continue to be the privileged recipient of the Martins' unrelenting loyalty and passion for AMDA. The Board of Directors has taken this opportunity to formally thank David Martin and Jan Martin for all of their amazing contributions over the years. To address the issue of compensation and retirement using Best Practices, the Board hired an outside expert compensation firm to research and evaluate appropriate awards. Rather than structuring the retirement plan on a deferred vested basis, the retirement plan is being treated and reported (calculated, paid, taxed) on Form 990. David Martin and Jan Martin have worked for over four decades, relentlessly building the school artistically, academically and professionally until the school's transformational foundation was complete: AMDA is now a major, fully-accredited College and Conservatory which has earned the unique description of being the only accredited institution of higher education, offering Bachelor of Fine Arts Degrees and Professional Certificate Programs - devoted entirely to the performer, with campuses in New York City and Los Angeles. The Martins have developed a successful and innovative business model that will help guide AMDA for future generations. Of additional note is that the Martins have established a fund to support future scholarships and support student and faculty vision projects."

The President resides in a university-owned housing, which is less than 1/2 mile from main campus. By locating him in close proximity to the University, it helps to make the President available for the daily interaction between the community and the University staff/students/alumni/donors and physical plants. The University-provided housing is geographically integrated with the University's educational property. The President's residence has been owned by the University for a substantial number of years. Prior Presidents have been required to reside there. The President performs many University tasks and functions at the residence. The residence is furnished for the convenience of the University and is required to be occupied by the President as a condition of his employment. As the University's principal fund-raiser, the President entertains actual or potential benefactors, visiting dignitaries and community leaders in the residence. The heaviness of the President's administrative workload, the presence of University-related social functions and the number of conferences scheduled with students or faculty members require access to the majority of the residence. In addition, the University conducts other events that are essential to its educational exemption. In lieu of the aforementioned intricacies of multiple uses by many multiple parties involved, it is impractical and would not be considered an accurate calculation of the fair market value of qualified campus lodging furnished to the President. Due to these factors, the University has decided to omit entering the estimated amount of tax free housing allowance provided in column F of Form 990, Part VII, Section A and Schedule J, Part II, Column D - ""Nontaxable Benefits"". The university provides a house cleaner for the president and also performs all necessary maintenance on the home.

The university did not utilize chartered flights for air travel. Extensive travel is required of the position of president and they are encouraged by the Board of Trustees to travel business or first class on flights of two hours or more. This provision is made for several reasons: 1) business or first-class travel allows for the most flexibility to accommodate a travel schedule that must frequently be altered, often at the last minute to accommodate donors' schedules, add critical meetings, or to take advantage of other strategic opportunities for the university; 2) circumstances sometimes call for the president to return to campus without notice, or to remain on campus when a trip was planned, and first or business-class travel best accommodates these changing conditions; and 3) the Board of Trustees wishes the president to be at their best performance representing and seeking funding for the university during often grueling travel itineraries for meetings frequently critical to the institution's well-being. This accommodation was not treated as taxable compensation.

Travel for Companions: With the exception of the President, reimbursement or payment of the travel expenses of an eligible employee's family member must normally be pre-approved by the President or appropriate Executive Vice President or Senior Vice President. The travel expenses of an eligible employee's family member may be paid for or reimbursed by Emory University and are not included in the employee's taxable income, provided the employee can establish that the presence of his or her family member serves a ""bona fide business purpose"" as defined in the Treasury Regulations. A family member's presence is considered to serve a bona fide business purpose if the individual has a significant role in the proceedings or makes an important contribution to the success of the event. If attendance of an eligible employee's family member is desirable but does not serve a bona fide business purpose to Emory, any such payment or reimbursement for such family member's travel expenses will be a taxable payment.

Compensation and benefits provided to this individual are determined pursuant to policies, procedures, and processes of AHSSHC that are designed to ensure compliance with the intermediate sanctions laws as set forth in IRC Section 4958. AHSSHC has taken steps to ensure that processes are in place to satisfy the rebuttable presumption of reasonableness standard as set forth in Treasury Regulation 53.4958-6 with respect to its active executive-level positions. The AHSSHC Board Compensation Committee (the Committee) serves as the governing body for all executive compensation matters. The Committee is composed of certain members of the Board of Directors (the Board) of AHSSHC. Voting members of the Committee include only individuals who serve on the Board as independent representatives of the community, who hold no employment positions with AHSSHC and who do not have relationships with any of the individuals whose compensation is under their review that impacts their best independent judgment as fiduciaries of AHSSHC. The Committee's role is to review and approve all components of the executive compensation plan of AHSSHC. As an independent governing body with respect to executive compensation, it should be noted that the Committee will often confer in executive sessions on matters of compensation policy and policy changes. In such executive sessions, no members of management of AHSSHC are present. The Committee is advised by an independent third party compensation advisor. This advisor prepares all the benchmark studies for the Committee. Compensation levels are benchmarked with a national peer group of other not-for-profit healthcare systems and hospitals of similar size and complexity to AHS and each of its affiliated entities. The following principles guide the establishment of individual executive compensation: - The salary of the President/CEO of AHS will not exceed the 40th percentile of comparable salaries paid by similarly situated organizations; and - Other executive salaries shall be established using market medians. The compensation philosophy, policies, and practices of AHSSHC are consistent with the organization's faith-based mission and conform to applicable laws, regulations, and business practices. As a faith-based organization sponsored by the Seventh-day Adventist Church (the Church), AHSSHC's philosophy and principles with respect to its executive compensation practices reflect the conservative approach of the Church's mission of service and were developed in counsel with the Church's leadership."

In recognition of the contribution that each executive makes to the success of AHS, AHS provides to eligible executives participation in the AHS Executive FLEX Benefit Program (the Plan). The purpose of the Plan is to offer eligible executives an opportunity to elect from among a variety of supplemental benefits, including deferred compensation benefits taxable under Internal Revenue Code (IRC) Section 457(f), to individually tailor a benefits program appropriate to each executive's needs. The Plan provides eligible participants a pre-determined benefits allowance credit that is equal to a percentage of the executive's base pay from which is deducted the cost of mandatory and elective employee benefits. The pre-determined benefits allowance credit percentage is approved by the AHSSHC Board Compensation Committee, an independent committee of the Board of Directors of AHSSHC. Any funds that remain after the cost of mandatory and elective benefits are subtracted from the annual pre-determined benefits allowance are contributed, at the employee's option, to either an IRC 457(f) deferred compensation account or to an IRC 457(b) eligible deferred compensation plan. Upon attainment of age 65, all previous 457(f) deferred amounts are paid immediately to the participant and any future employer contributions are made quarterly from the Plan directly to the participant. The Plan documents define an employee who is eligible to participate in the Plan to generally include the Chief Executive Officers of AHS entities and Vice Presidents of all AHS entities whose base salary is at least $236,000. The Plan provides for a class year vesting schedule (2 years for each class year) with respect to amounts accumulated in the executive's 457(f) deferred compensation account. Distributions could also be made from the executive's 457(f) deferred compensation account upon attainment of age 65 or upon an involuntary separation. The account is forfeited by the executive upon a voluntary separation. In addition to the Plan, AHS has instituted a defined benefit, non-tax-qualified deferred compensation plan for certain executives who have provided lengthy service to AHS and/or to other Seventh-day Adventist Church hospitals or health care institutions. Participation in the plan is offered to AHS executives on a prorata schedule beginning with 20 years of service as an employee of AHS and/or another hospital or health care institution controlled by the Seventh-day Adventist Church and who satisfy certain other qualifying criteria. This supplemental executive retirement plan (SERP) was designed to provide eligible executives with the economic equivalent of an annual income beginning at normal retirement age equal to 60% of the average of the participant's three, five or seven highest years of base salary from AHS active employment inclusive of income from all other Seventh-day Adventist Church healthcare employer-financed retirement income sources and investment income earned on those contributions through social security normal retirement age as defined in the plan. The number of years included in highest average compensation is determined by the individual's year of entry to the SERP and by the individual's year of entry to the AHS Executive FLEX Benefit Program.
