""Be of service"" is an integral core value which we demonstrate in a variety of ways. Hazelden Betty Ford Foundation provides treatment services to individuals and families who seek and qualify for care but are unable to pay the full cost. The patient aid policy provides that Hazelden Betty Ford Foundation will annually establish a target amount of patient financial assistance. In addition to its annual provision for charity care, Hazelden Betty Ford Foundation provides a variety of other benefits for the public good including:Hazelden Betty Ford Graduate School of Addiction Studies: -The Hazelden Betty Ford Graduate School of Addiction Studies prepares future leaders in addiction counseling through our three available degrees: Master of Arts in Addiction Counseling, Master of Arts in Addiction Counseling: Advanced Practice and Master of Arts in Addiciton Studies: Integrated Recovery for Co-Occurring Disorders. The school emphasizes public engagement as a means of serving our constituent communities. In 2017, students provided more than 25,700 hours of clinical services at agencies reaching underserved and economically disadvantaged populations. The school offers a full scholarship each year to a student who works at Chisago County Health and Human Services, and we provide continuing education to these Chisago County professionals at no cost. Fifty-five students graduated with master's degrees from the school in 2017. Overall, more than 92 percent of graduates who seek careers in the addiction treatment field find employment in their home communities or at regional or national treatment agencies. Faculty and graduate school leaders participate in public service events throughout the United States and make research, educational, and scholarly contributions to the field of addiction treatment.Butler Center for Research: -The Butler Center for Research (BCR) is dedicated to improving recovery from addiction by conducting clinical and institutional research, collaborating with other research centers and communicating scientific findings. It is the Center's vision that sustained recovery for all who seek help will be achieved through advancements in knowledge and integration of research into practice. -In 2017, the BCR participated in the following activities: -As part of Hazelden Betty Ford Foundation's commitment to evidence-based practice, more than 50 data analysis projects were conducted to inform clinical care and academic programming, identify treatment needs, drive data-based decision-making, guide strategic planning and contribute to the field's knowledge of addiction treatment. -In 2017, the BCR completed recruitment for the ongoing study to explore outcomes for patients in the organization's Comprehensive Opioid Response with the Twelve Steps (COR-12) program. It also completed data collection activities for a pilot study organized by the National Association of Addiction Treatment Providers on treatment outcomes for providers across the country. Analysis and reporting for these studies is under way, and preliminary work with the data has yielded some interesting and exciting findings. A new study was also initiated in partnership with Soberlink to investigate the effects of using mobile breathalyzer devices in addition to participation in the Hazelden Betty Ford Foundation's Connection program (which offers ongoing recovery services following treatment for substance use disorders). -The BCR submitted a new scientific manuscript for publication in 2017; the paper outlined initial findings from the ongoing study of the organization's COR-12 program, which integrates the use of medication with Twelve Step Facilitation and other evidence-based addiction treatment practices. -Research Updates were disseminated to professionals, educators, researchers, students and other stakeholders. These two-page summaries of scientific findings from the field of addiction treatment research are provided at no cost as a community benefit to policymakers, treatment professionals and the public at large. Research Updates are also available on the BCR web page at www.hazeldenbettyford.org/bcr/addiction-research. Five new Research Updates were created in 2017, including: Substance Use Disorders among Legal Professionals, Applications of Positive Psychology to Substance Use Disorders, Prescription Rates of Opioid Analgesics in Medical Treatment Settings, Outcomes of Alcohol and Other Drug Dependencey Treament and Women and Alcohol.-In addition to the new Research Updates, the BRC published two white papers: ""Adolescent Motivational Interviewing and ""What does it really mean to be providing medication-assisted treatment for opioid addiction?"" The first paper was a case study exploring the use of motivational interviewing with adolescent patients in treatment for substance use disorders. The second was a paper explaining medication-assisted treatment for opioid use disorders. Both papers are available online at www.hazeldenbettyford.org/education/bcr/addiction-research.Community Education and Relations: -We presented free public talks at the Hazelden Betty Ford Foundation's ""Awareness Hour,"" an informative series held in Rancho Mirage, California, since 1976 on select Saturdays throughout the year; at our Minnesota Speaker Series held in St. Paul on select Tuesdays; at our Orgeon Speaker Series held twice a month in the Portland metro area; and at our monthly Second Sunday speaker series held in Center City, Minnesota.-Our Speakers Bureau helped place the organization's wide array of spokespeople at many events throughout the country, with 108 different employees delivering 232 presentations in 26 states and two Canadian provinces. -We also provided education and support at our free, open-to-the-public Caring Families groups, facilitated once a month in St. Paul, Minnesota; once a month in Plymouth, Minnesota; and, as of December 2017, once a week in Fort Myers, Florida-as well as weekly in an online format at www.TheDailyPledge.org.-Our Visitors Program in Center City, Minnesota, scheduled and conducted 85 tours for 377 individuals.

The pipeline programs have two important goals: expose urban minority students to science studies while helping them develop a strong interest in science and research, and improve opportunities for urban minority students who wish to pursue careers in medicine and science. The programs are a series of educational steps that establish an academic continuum in medical education. The academic continuum starts at preschool with the Saturday Science Academy (SSA) programs, including the SSA junior white coat ceremony, and extends upward through the Lincoln-Drew Elementary School (grades K-6). Lincoln-Drew Middle School (grades 7 through 9) and the King/Drew Magnet High School of Medicine and Science (grades 10 through 12). The white coat ceremony is a nationwide medical school activity to signal the transition of medical students from book learning and lab work to the world of clinical practice and direct interaction with real patients. The SSA junior white coat ceremony seeks to embrace the spirit of this exercise through encouraging students to commit to lifelong learning."
