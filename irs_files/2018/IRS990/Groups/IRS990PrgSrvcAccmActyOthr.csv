Drew University is actively committed to training future generations to make a difference through a number of novel and innovative youth education ""pipeline programs"" which are unique among medical education programs in Southern California. The pipeline programs have two important goals: expose urban minority students to science studies while helping them develop a strong interest in science and research, and improve opportunities for urban minority students who wish to pursue careers in medicine and science. The programs are a series of educational steps that establish an academic continuum in medical education. The academic continuum starts at preschool with the Saturday Science Academy (SSA) programs, including the SSA junior white coat ceremony, and extends upward through the Lincoln-Drew Elementary School (grades K-6). Lincoln-Drew Middle School (grades 7 through 9) and the King/Drew Magnet High School of Medicine and Science (grades 10 through 12). The white coat ceremony is a nationwide medical school activity to signal the transition of medical students from book learning and lab work to the world of clinical practice and direct interaction with real patients. The SSA junior white coat ceremony seeks to embrace the spirit of this exercise through encouraging students to commit to lifelong learning."

NSU is 1 of only 311 colleges and universities nationally selected for the Carnegie Foundation's Community Engagement Classification, and 1 of only 37 colleges and universities to hold both community engaged and high research activity designations.NSU delivers tangible benefits, including junior kindergarten through doctoral education, physical infrastructure, a professional workforce, employment opportunities, delivery of health care and law services in Broward and Miami-Dade counties, lifelong learning options, community-service initiatives, and public access to cultural and scholarly experiences. NSU continues to grow its academic and scientific research activities. More than 200 research projects are currently under way at NSU, including studies on cardiovascular disease, anti-cancer therapies, chronic fatigue syndrome, autism, coral reef restoration, stem cells, and wildlife DNA forensics, among other subjects. The university's commitment to scientific and technological exploration led to the opening of NSU's Guy Harvey Oceanographic Center building and the Center for Collaborative Research (CCR) in 2016. The CCR consists of 215,000 square feet of research and collaborative spaces. This project is registered with the U.S. Green Building Council (USGBC) and is the first NSU facility to achieve a LEED certification level of Gold. The facility houses core facilities including Genomics, Flow Cytometry, Cell Therapy and Imaging. The CCR is expected to bring multiple disciplines together, with students and NSU faculty members partnering with professionals and organizations outside of the NSU community-furthering cutting-edge research and developing technologies that will benefit the global community."
