An hours drive from DC, the Airlie Center in Warrenton, Virginia, sits on 300 pastoral acres and contains historic Airlie House, a village of guest rooms, meeting facilities, an organic garden, and a lake. Airlies Board of Directors gifted the property to AU in September 2016. One of the first conference facilities of its kind in the country, Airlie was considered a model of innovation when founder Murdock Head opened the doors in 1960. Since then it has been welcoming international leaders, policy makers, and diplomats for significant meetings and programs dedicated to social progress, education, environmental research, and public health - some of which have shaped social movements and institutions. It is fitting that an institution committed to active citizenship and global leadership would continue Airlies mission. ""The university is honored to have been selected for this wonderful gift. It is our intent to carry on the very impressive and important legacy of Airlie, while leveraging this marvelous facility for American Universitys academic initiatives,"" said AU president emeritus Neil Kerwin."
