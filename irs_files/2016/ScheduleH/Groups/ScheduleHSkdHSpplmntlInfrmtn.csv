201533159349302123,462931956,"PART V, SECTION B, LINE 11:","The two areas of most significant need that were identified in the CHNA were following: (1) The prevention of chronic disease. (2) The promotion of healthy women, Infants, and children. Prevention of Chronic Disease: Montefiore New Rochelle Hospital has selected to focus on reducing the racial disparities by decreasing the percentage of Blacks and Hispanics dying prematurely from heart related diseases by oncentrating on reducing tobacco and nicotine consumption among these populations in the service area. Tobacco and nicotine consumption, among these populations in the service area is a leading causal indicator in heart related disease. The strategic plan is to increase screening rates for cardiovascular disease as well as for diabetes, breast, cervical, and colorectal cancers. In conjunction with the screening process the plan is to influence patients to quit smoking and to reduce the prevalence of smoking in the service area. By providing 100% of the inpatient population with information on the New York State Quit Line, by expanding the smoke free campus to all locations, and by being an ardent supporter of supplemental nicotine replacement therapy there is a strong likelihood of reducing the racial disparity of rates of premature death from heart related and other diseases. Promotion of Healthy Women, Infants, and Children: The increase in the proportion of infants that are exclusively breastfed for the first six months of life is an important factor in the promotion of healthy women, infants, and children. The Montefiore Westchester Hospitals are committed to achieving the goals of the Baby Friendly Hospital initiative. The following objectives have been identified to achieve this initiative: 1. Enforcement of New York State Hospital regulation to not supplement breastfeeding infants with formula feeding unless medically indicated and documented within the infants medical record. 2. Provide physical restrictions to infant formula by hospital staff including the tracking of infant formula distribution with the Health Department. 3. Discontinue the distribution of free promotional formula 4. Prohibit the display and distribution of infant formula promotion materials in any hospital location. Montefiore New Rochelle Hospital will support the New Rochelle commitment to support mothers who choose to breastfeed by providing additional resources to breastfeeding mothers and to minimize practices that can interfere with that choice such as supplementing breastfeeding infants with formula, unless medically indicated or at the mother's specific request."

201543159349300439,160743905,"Schedule H, Part V, Section B, Line 5-Group A Arnot Ogden Medical Center","Arnot Health in collaboration with partners from HP2 and SHPT, developed broad based five-year Community Health Improvement Plans in 2013 to address chronic disease as a public health priority. Arnot Health and its partners continued to implement the plans in 2014, and plan to conduct another Comprehensive Community Health Needs Assessment in 2016. However, the Finger Lakes Health Association conducted a Comprehensive Needs Assessment for the Finger Lakes Region in 2014 as part of the DSRIP initiative. The Community Health Improvement Plans (CHIP) plans in both Chemung and Steuben Counties focus on reducing obesity and tobacco use. The CHIP from both counties place emphasis on three key areas 1 health promotion activities to encourage healthy living and limit the onset of chronic diseases 2 early detection opportunities that include screening populations at risk and successful management strategies for existing diseases and related complications. These strategies recommended by the NYSDOH Prevention Agenda and Health Impact Pyramid are based on the evidenced based potential to address health inequities the ability to measure success and potential reach potential for broad partner support and collaboration and political feasibility. This method is based on findings from such organizations as the Institute of Medicine of the National Academies and their report Accelerating Progress in Obesity Prevention Solving the Weight of the Nation or the CDCs Recommended Community Strategies and Measurements to Prevent Obesity in the United States. For each focus area under the selected Prevention Agenda Prevent Chronic Disease priority Chemung and Steuben County Partnerships identified objectives and goals that include improvement strategies and performance measures with measurable and time framed targets over the next five years. The proposed chronic disease prevention strategies are evidence based or promising practices. They include activities currently underway by partners and new strategies to be implemented. All proposed strategies in Chemung and Steuben Counties are supported by the HP2 and SHPT partnerships. Chronic disease prevention strategies will be implemented in multiple sectors, including at local schools, worksites, businesses, community organizations, and with providers, to make it easier for residents to make healthy choices. By planning and implementing strategies from many levels of the Health Impact Pyramid, and through our network of diverse partnerships, we can create an environment that is conducive to physical activity, good nutrition and tobacco cessation. The Chemung and Steuben County partnerships have included many suggested activities from the States Prevent Chronic Disease Plan that will encourage increased physical activity, better nutrition and tobacco cessation strategies that aim toward reducing and preventing the incidence of chronic disease in Chemung and Steuben Counties. Some of these interventions include environmental, policy and systems changes to create communities that support physical activity, improved nutrition and breastfeeding, and tobacco cessation. Chemung County will continue its work through the Creating Healthy Places to Live, Work and Play grant and improve parks and playgrounds, establish community gardens to improve access to fresh fruits and vegetables, and work with local restaurant partners to make eating out healthier. Steuben County will continue to work with the cross county Southern Tier Tobacco Awareness Community Partnership, STTAC to establish tobacco free policies and urge members of the Regional Economic Development Council to consider health in their projects. Both counties plan to pursue joint use agreements with local school districts. Promote breast feeding policies at worksites, and create resource guides that promote the counties many opportunities for physical activity and healthy foods, including local farmers markets, parks and hiking trails. Other strategies include the clinical and community solutions such as provider 51 referrals to Diabetes Prevention Programs, Chronic Disease Self Management Programs and Tobacco Cessation Education. One exciting aspect of the CHIP is the unlimited possibilities offered by technological advances. Arnot Health and other local providers are beginning to implement Electronic Health Records, EHR. When fully functional, the benefits of EHRs will include improved quality and convenience of patient care, accuracy of diagnoses, enhanced care coordination, increased patient participation in their care, improved health outcomes and increased practice efficiencies and cost savings. EHRs will give providers decision support tools and available resources to better prevent and manage chronic disease. Arnot Health is currently working towards consolidating existing technologies within the healthcare system, with the objective of getting everyone on the same system organization wide. Consolidating technology within the healthcare system will improve communication among care providers, and between patients with their providers, enhance patient care coordination, improve chronic disease management and health outcomes. Arnot Health is increasing its focus on population health management and working towards increasing the systems abilities and competencies related to population health management. Areas of focus include realigning our health care delivery system to be more patient and ambulatory centric, increasing patient engagement with primary care providers using PCMH as a model, improving care coordination, and improving the management of chronic disease. Successful consolidation of IT systems will, contribute towards the integration and interoperability of data, and data exchange among care providers. Create robust and functional analytics which can identify higher risk patients to better manage chronic disease and improve health outcomes. Equip providers with the competencies needed to manage health care in a more predictive and less reactive way. Reduce preventable utilization of higher cost health care services such as emergency room or inpatient settings. Chemung and Steuben Counties Community Health Improvement Plans propose training primary care providers to talk to their patients about their weight, physical activity, diet and tobacco use and offering professional training opportunities which include programs on prevention, screening, diagnosis and treatment of overweight, obesity and diabetes. Residents and medical students will benefit from this training through the healthcare systems graduate medical education program. Arnot Healths graduate medical education program is offered in partnership with Lake Erie College of Osteopathic Medicine, LECOM. Another CHIP strategy is to investigate the possibility of incorporating referrals to community resources to prevent or manage chronic disease through a link in EHR. Through the use of new technology, follow up calls can be made to check on patient compliance, and provide the opportunity to document and measure the effectiveness of healthcare interventions. 52 Arnot Healths service area includes two Medically Underserved Areas, MUA. Elmiras Census Tract 0007.00 in Chemung County and Troupsburg and Tuscarora Town Service Area in Steuben County. Poor access to care is associated with a higher incidence of chronic disease, poorly managed chronic disease and an increased incidence of preventable hospitalizations. In both counties, the ratio of residents to primary care providers exceeds the NYS average. Arnot Health, through its Arnot Medical Services provider practice group, continues to aggressively recruit providers for the counties most underserved areas, and expand its graduate medical program to help meet identified needs within the MUAs. As Arnot Health works in partnership with Chemung County's HP2 and Steuben County's SHPT to implement the CHIPs, we will continue to identify emerging best practices to reduce obesity and tobacco use. Data measures will be developed to assess the effectiveness of our plans in impacting the community's health, and set mid-course corrections where needed. Promising cases for return on investment will be shared with policymakers. The specifics of Chemung and Steuben Counties Community Health Improvement Plans are outlined in the following CHIP charts. Strategies, goals, objectives, improvement strategies, performance measures with measurable time-framed targets over a three year period are included in the CHIP charts."

201543159349300439,160743905,"Schedule H, Part V, Section B, Line 11-Group A","Four assessments inform the entire MAPP process. The assessment phase provides a comprehensive picture of the community in its current state using both qualitative and quantitative methods. The use of four different assessments is a unique feature of the MAPP process. Most planning processes look only at quantitative statistics and anecdotal data. MAPP provides tools to help communities analyze health issues through multiple lenses. Arnot Health, in cross-county collaborations with local health departments and community partners, participated in all four MAPP assessments in both Chemung and Steuben Counties. The first assessment examined local, regional and state Community Health Status Indicators. Two methods were used to examine indicators. The first method was to collect relevant statistical data using the NYSDOH Community Health Indicator Reports, Census data, BRFSS reports, CDC Healthy People 2020 and a wide variety of other data sources. Chemung County data collection and analysis was facilitated by a consultant contracted by the Chemung County Health Department. Data collection and analysis in Steuben County was facilitated by S2AY Rural Health Network staff. Data that was available in the fall of 2012 and early winter of 2013 was used for analysis to complete work in a timely fashion; allow time for partnerships to review and discuss the data, identify priorities, establish and refine goals and objectives, and prepare the CHA, CHIP and CSP.The second method was to collect primary data by conducting a comprehensive community health survey among a random sample of residents to determine their opinions, health-related behaviors and health needs. The surveys were designed to encompass questions in the five Prevention Agenda areas that NYSDOH has identified as high priority issues on a statewide basis, Prevent chronic diseases, Promote healthy and safe environments, Promote healthy women, infants and children, Promote mental health and prevent substance abuse, and Prevent HIV, sexually transmitted diseases, vaccine preventable diseases and healthcare associated Infections. This was completed in both counties by the fall of 2012 and early spring of 2013. Surveys were conducted electronically through a Survey Monkey link, along with paper copies which were distributed to the public through hospitals, employers, health educational and human services agencies, and through other community groups. Links to the surveys were posted on Rural Health Networks' Web sites, hospitals and health departments' Web sites and in signature lines of partners' communications. Press releases, TV ads, flyers, postcards were distributed, and partners promoted the completion of surveys at community presentations and health events. Arnot Health's community health nurses facilitated the completion of electronic and paper surveys for residents with limited ability to self complete, such as persons with low educational attainment, disability, or low level of literacy. In Chemung County, a total of 564 surveys were completed, which represents 63 percent of the county's population. In Steuben County, a total of 747 surveys, representing 77 percent of population, were completed. Once all the statistics and the results from the four assessments were tallied, a finalized list of the top issues from all components of the assessment process was compiled. Arnot Health attended a series of meetings to present data and pick public health priorities with the Health Priority Partnership (HP2) in Chemung County and the Steuben Health Priorities Team (SHPT) in Steuben County. The partnerships in both counties were charged with ranking the priorities based on their knowledge of health needs and available services, along with the data presented, to select two priorities and one disparity. In order to accomplish this, the Hanlon Method was used. This method of ranking health priorities focuses most heavily on how effective any interventions might be. The Hanlon Method utilizes the following formula to rank priorities. (A & 2B) X C Where A= the size of the problem, B= the severity of the problem and C=the effectiveness of the solution. The effectiveness of the solution is given a lot more weight than the size or seriousness of the problem, with the hope of making wise use of limited resources by targeting solutions that are known to be effective. Participants also considered the weight of the propriety, economic feasibility, acceptability, resources and legality (PEARL) of issues in this ranking system. PEARL Factors Propriety Is the problem one that falls within the overall scope of operation? Is it consistent with our mission statement? Economic Feasibility Does it make economic sense to address the problem? Are these economic consequences as a result of the problem NOT being addressed? Acceptability Will the community/or target population accept a program to address the problem? Resources Are, or should, resources be available to address the problem?"

Promote tobacco cessation, especially among low socioeconomic populations and those with mental health illness. Hypertension and tobacco use are two major contributing factors to cardiovascular diseases. Cigarette smoking increases the risk of coronary heart disease by itself. When it acts with other factors, it greatly increases risk. Smoking increases blood pressure, decreases exercise tolerance and increases the tendency for blood to clot. Smoking also increases the risk of recurrent coronary heart disease after bypass surgery. Cigarette smoking is widespread and significant as a risk factor that the Surgeon General has called it the leading preventable cause of disease and deaths in the United States. Both Chemung and Steuben Counties CHAs priority rankings through the Hanlon Method identified obesity and tobacco use as major focus areas to prevent chronic disease. According to the CDC, growing evidence indicates that a comprehensive approach to prevention can save tremendous costs and enhance the quality of life. The four common modifiable behaviors that contribute to chronic illness, disability, and premature death related to chronic disease. These include tobacco use, insufficient physical activity, poor eating habits, and excessive alcohol use. With hospital facilities in Chemung and Steuben Counties, and ongoing efforts to expand partnerships in both counties, Arnot Health is uniquely positioned to work more regionally across county lines to develop and implement prevention strategies that will improve the health of the community. The Health Impact Pyramid developed by Thomas R. Frieden, MD, MPH was extensively utilized. This is a pyramid approach to describe the impact of different types of public health interventions and provides a framework to improve health. The base of the pyramid indicates interventions with the greatest potential impact and in ascending order are interventions that change the context to make individuals default decisions healthy, clinical interventions that require limited contact but confer long term protection, on going direct clinical care, and health education and counseling. Interventions focusing on lower levels of the pyramid tend to be more effective because they reach broader segments of society and require less individual effort. Community Health Improvement Plans from both counties place emphasis on three key areas, health promotion activities to encourage healthy living and limit the onset of chronic diseases, early detection opportunities that include screening populations at risk and successful management strategies for existing diseases and related complications. These strategies, recommended by the Health Impact Pyramid, are based on the interventions evidenced base potential to address health inequities the ability to measure success and potential reach potential for broad partner support and collaboration and political feasibility. Chemung and Steuben County Partnerships identified objectives and goals that include improvement strategies and performance measures with measurable and time framed targets over the next five years.

Chronic disease prevention strategies will be implemented in multiple sectors, including at local schools, worksites, businesses, community organizations, and with providers, to make it easier for residents to make healthy choices. By planning and implementing strategies from many levels of the Health Impact Pyramid, and through our network of diverse partnerships, we can create an environment that is conducive to physical activity, good nutrition and tobacco cessation. The Chemung and Steuben County partnerships have included many suggested activities from the States Prevent Chronic Disease Plan that will encourage increased physical activity, better nutrition and tobacco cessation strategies that aim toward reducing and preventing the incidence of chronic disease in Chemung and Steuben Counties. Some of these interventions include environmental, policy and systems changes to create communities that support physical activity, improved nutrition and breastfeeding, and tobacco cessation. Chemung County will continue its work through the Creating Healthy Places to Live, Work and Play grant and improve parks and playgrounds, establish community gardens to improve access to fresh fruits and vegetables, and work with local restaurant partners to make eating out healthier. Steuben County will continue to work with the cross county Southern Tier Tobacco Awareness Community Partnership, STTAC to establish tobacco free policies and urge members of the Regional Economic Development Council to consider health in their projects. Both counties plan to pursue joint use agreements with local school districts, promote breast feeding policies at worksites, and create resource guides that promote the counties many opportunities for physical activity and healthy foods, including local farmers markets, parks and hiking trails. Other strategies include the clinical and community solutions such as provider referrals to Diabetes Prevention Programs, Chronic Disease Self Management Programs and Tobacco Cessation Education.

Reduce preventable utilization of higher cost health care services such as emergency room or inpatient settings. Chemung and Steuben Counties Community Health Improvement Plans propose training primary care providers to talk to their patients about their weight, physical activity, diet and tobacco use and offering professional training opportunities which include programs on prevention, screening, diagnosis and treatment of overweight, obesity and diabetes. Residents and medical students will benefit from this training through the healthcare systems graduate medical education program. Arnot Healths graduate medical education program is offered in partnership with Lake Erie College of Osteopathic Medicine LECOM. Another CHIP strategy is to investigate the possibility of incorporating referrals to community resources to prevent or manage chronic disease through a link in EHR. Through the use of new technology, follow up calls can be made to check on patient compliance, and provide the opportunity to document and measure the effectiveness of healthcare interventions. Poor access to care is associated with a higher incidence of chronic disease, poorly managed chronic disease and an increased incidence of preventable hospitalizations. Arnot Health, through its Arnot Medical Services provider practice group, continues to aggressively recruit providers for the counties most underserved areas, and expand its graduate medical program to help meet identified needs within the MUAs."

Holy name created an accompanying chna addressing its specific service areas. The community health improvement partnership (""chip"") of bergen county was also a partnering organization in the creation of the chna."

201503209349304230,221487322,"Schedule h, part v, section b, question 11","Both the bergen county chna and the medical center's chna identified five significant areas of need: obesity, chronic disease, elder health, access to care, and mental health and substance abuse. The last area, mental health and substance abuse, is not a specialty of the medical center; although a 23-bed acute care psychiatric unit is available, ambulatory services are not. Consequently, efforts to address excessive drinking, drug use and gambling issues are led by other community organizations and supported by the medical center through education, participation in county task forces, coordination efforts, screening, referral and other support. Obesity, deemed an ""umbrella"" condition that increases the risk of numerous diseases, is being addressed via community education, lectures, programs, classes and screening. Hnmc also participates with the county ""chip"" in its behavior change and self-management programs. Chronic disease encompasses a wide range of conditions, e.g., cardiac disease, cancer, chronic respiratory conditions and diabetes. Efforts have focused on prevention, education and chronic disease self-management. Diabetes, which may be categorized under both obesity and chronic disease, was the focus of a coordinated regional shared screening and referral event in conjunction with other county hospitals. Fully redesigned end-of-life offerings address the issues contributing to health quality and longevity that invariably accompany later stage chronic diseases. Various care screenings and referrals, programs, education, support and other types of intervention have been strengthened to address this too-often overlooked, yet crucial aspect. Bergen county is the third oldest county in new jersey and has the greatest absolute number of elderly. Education, screenings, follow-up, coordination with community groups, senior centers, re-education and expansion of home care staff have been employed. This category overlaps with chronic disease initiatives and, again, we note the use of end-of-life offerings to foster wellness and quality of life. Although present in bergen county, access to care is more pronounced in hudson county. Socioeconomic factors such as language barriers and lack of transportation greatly increase the risk of lack of both preventive care and care for existing conditions, resulting in overuse of ERs and less optimal outcomes. An expanded system of free transportation has been implemented for persons unable to obtain transportation; and a network of bilingual physician practices that will accept low-pay, Medicaid and free care has been increased in the target area. A multi-specialty volunteer physician practice in bergen county that provides free care to persons in financial need is also supported by the medical center via free clinical services and financial support. Perhaps the greatest access issue is lack of insurance, which has been addressed via the medical center's large-scale ACA enrollment activities targeting both spanish-speaking and asian language-speaking persons."

WITH THE NEW BUILDING AND CARE MODEL, REGIONS EXPERIENCED GROWTH IN VOLUMES AND IMPROVED PATIENT SATISFACTION. IN 2014, REGIONS CONTINUED TO RUN THE FACILITY AT FULL OCCUPANCY. THERE WERE 4,147 INPATIENTS. DAYBRIDGEIN MAY OF 2013, REGIONS OPENED DAYBRIDGE, A PARTIAL HOSPITALIZATION PROGRAM. DAYBRIDGE IS A MENTAL HEALTH PROGRAM FOR ADULTS WHO NEED INTENSIVE THERAPY BUT CAN CONTINUE TO LIVE IN THEIR COMMUNITY WITH THE SUPPORT OF FAMILY AND FRIENDS. INDIVIDUALS PARTICIPATE IN INPATIENT-LIKE TREATMENT DURING THE DAY AND RETURN TO THEIR HOME AT NIGHT AND ON WEEKENDS.

TO REDUCE AND SOMEDAY ELIMINATE STIGMA, REGIONS CONTINUES WORK WITH OVER 20 LOCAL COMMUNITY ORGANIZATIONS SUCH AS THE NATIONAL ALLIANCE ON MENTAL ILLNESS (NAMI) MINNESOTA, TWIN CITIES PUBLIC TELEVISION (TPT) AND THE ADVERTISING FIRM PRESTON KELLY TO CREATE THE MAKE IT OK ANTI-STIGMA CAMPAIGN. ALTHOUGH REGIONS' CAMPAIGN INCORPORATES SOME EDUCATION OF THE PUBLIC ABOUT MENTAL ILLNESS, IT IS MORE ABOUT CHANGING HEARTS AND ATTITUDES. BY MAKING MENTAL ILLNESSES LESS SCARY AND MORE LIKE OTHER DISEASES, PEOPLE WILL BE MORE LIKELY TO TAKE THE NECESSARY STEPS TOWARD HEALING. THE CAMPAIGN IS COMMUNITY BASED AND NOT BRANDED, SO OTHER ORGANIZATIONS HAVE ACCESS TO THE SAME MATERIALS. THE CAMPAIGN HARD LAUNCHED IN MAY 2013 WITH AN ADVERTISING ""FLIGHT"" THAT INCLUDED TELEVISION, RADIO, PRINT, SOCIAL MEDIA, ONLINE VIDEO, INTERNET PURCHASES AND TRANSIT SHELTERS. MORE ROBUST FLIGHTS WERE LAUNCHED IN SEPTEMBER 2013 AND THE SPRING AND FALL OF 2014. ALL THESE EFFORTS HAVE BENEFITTED GREATLY FROM THE IN-KIND SUPPORT OF OUR MEDIA PARTNERS. IN ORDER TO SPREAD THE ANTI-STIGMA MESSAGE IN A FORMAT THAT ALLOWS FOR MORE DEPTH THAN IS AVAILABLE WITH ADVERTISING OR PSAS, REGIONS WORKED WITH TPT TO PRODUCE 10 PROFILES OF MINNESOTANS WHO HAVE EXPERIENCED MENTAL ILLNESS AND STIGMA. THESE STORIES WERE USED TO CREATE FOUR HALF-HOUR DOCUMENTARIES THAT ARE BEING BROADCAST ON TPT IN PRIMETIME. THE SERIES BEGAN AIRING STATEWIDE IN OCTOBER 2013 AND WILL CONTINUE THROUGH 2018. IT HAS ALSO BEEN MADE AVAILABLE ON THE TPT WEBSITE AND MAKEITOK.ORG.

REGIONS PACKAGED ITS MESSAGE IN A TOOLKIT THAT IS BEING SHARED WITH THESE ORGANIZATIONS SO THEY CAN SHARE IT WITH THEIR OWN STAFF AND IN OTHER SETTINGS. REGIONS WILL TRAIN POTENTIAL TRAINERS WITHIN THESE ORGANIZATIONS SO THE MESSAGE CAN BE BEST SPREAD. REGIONS IS ALSO TRAINING A LINEUP OF ""AMBASSADORS"" WHO CAN TALK ABOUT THE HARM OF STIGMA AND THE THINGS WE CAN DO TO FIGHT IT.

NAMI MINNESOTA OFFERS EDUCATION, SUPPORT AND ADVOCACY. IN SEPTEMBER, 2014 REGIONS SPONSORED A TEAM OF NAMI WALK PARTICIPANTS. THERE WERE 82 PARTICIPANTS ON THE REGIONS TEAM AND THE TEAM RAISED APPROXIMATELY $5,700 TO CONTRIBUTE TO NAMI IN THE EFFORT TO INCREASE AWARENESS OF MENTAL ILLNESS AND TO ELIMINATE STIGMA.

PARTICIPATING ORGANIZATIONS WORK WITH A GROUP OF TWELVE EAST METRO PHARMACIES THAT FILL PRESCRIPTIONS, WAVING THE FULL PRICE OR CO-PAY AS NECESSARY. THE PHARMACIES THEN BILL THE GROUP FOR THE PRESCRIPTIONS OR CO-PAYS, AND THE GROUP PAYS FOR THEM USING FUNDS RAISED. PATIENTS CAN RECEIVE A TOTAL OF THREE MONTHS WORTH OF ASSISTANCE. SOCIAL WORKERS AND CARE PROVIDERS ENSURE THAT PATIENTS APPLY FOR OTHER ASSISTANCE PROGRAMS BEFORE RECEIVING PRESCRIPTIONS. IN THIS WAY, PATIENTS HAVE ACCESS TO ONGOING FUNDING FOR MEDICATIONS.WITHOUT ACCESS TO STOP-GAP MEDICATIONS, MANY OF THE PROGRAM'S PARTICIPANTS WOULD NOT BE ABLE TO AFFORD THEIR MENTAL HEALTH DRUGS AS THEY APPLY FOR LONGER-TERM ASSISTANCE, AND TAKING A BREAK FROM THEIR DRUG REGIMENT CAN LEAD TO INCREASED HOSPITALIZATIONS, INCARCERATIONS, AND SUICIDAL IDEATION. BY HELPING PATIENTS AVOID THESE CONSEQUENCES, THE MODEST COSTS OF MHDAP LEAD TO TREMENDOUS SAVINGS IN THE COMMUNITY'S EMERGENCY DEPARTMENTS, LAW ENFORCEMENT SECTORS AND OTHER HEALTH AND HUMAN SERVICE PROGRAMS. BY PREVENTING PSYCHIATRIC CRISES, THE PROGRAM PREVENTS EMERGENCY HOSPITALIZATIONS AND INCARCERATIONS WHICH COST AN AVERAGE OF $12,000 TO $15,000 COMPARED TO THE AVERAGE COST OF $161 FOR A PROGRAM PRESCRIPTION."

REPORTS INCLUDE TOTAL CLICKS ON HEALTHWISE HYPERLINKS DIRECTLY WITHIN MYCHART (WHERE PATIENTS LEARN ABOUT THEIR TESTS, MEDICATIONS, ALLERGIES AND IMMUNIZATIONS). THE REPORTS ALSO INCLUDE TOTAL CLICKS TO HEALTHWISE KNOWLEDGEBASE CONTENT FROM HEALTHPARTNERS.COM. THESE REPORTS SHOW WHAT TOPICS ARE ACCESSED THE MOST, AND/OR ARE TRENDING. - REPORTS ON HEALTHWISE PATIENT INSTRUCTION USAGE ARE AD HOC AND DEPENDENT ON THE CONTENT BEING ADDED TO THE AVS (AFTER VISIT SUMMARY)/DISCHARGE INSTRUCTIONS (A LIMITATION IN EPIC) SO THE USAGE NUMBERS DO NOT REFLECT THE FULL USE OF THESE MATERIALS. WE HAVE TRIED TO BUILD WORKFLOWS AND STAFF EDUCATION THAT DIRECTS THEM TO THE USE OF THE HEALTHWISE CONTENT SO THAT WE HAVE CONSISTENCY IN USE OF THIS AGREED UPON HEALTH EDUCATION MATERIAL.- WORK TO FURTHER REFINE REPORTING METRICS AND ANY OTHER OUTCOMES RELATED TO USE OF THE PATIENT EDUCATION CONTENT WILL CONTINUE IN 2015. IT SHOULD BE NOTED THAT FINDING DEFINITIVE CAUSAL POSITIVE OUTCOMES FROM THE USE OF PRINTED EDUCATION MATERIALS MAY BE DIFFICULT TO DEMONSTRATE.- WHAT IS MOST IMPORTANT IS THAT THE PATIENTS CARED FOR IN REGIONS AND OUR HEALTHPARTNERS SYSTEM RECEIVE EDUCATION MATERIALS WITH CONSISTENT MESSAGES AND DIRECTION, WHEREVER THEY ARE ACCESSING THEIR CARE IN THE CONTINUUM.

OUR MENTAL HEALTH DEPARTMENT OFFERS A ONE YEAR POST GRADUATE PSYCHIATRIC TRAINING PROGRAM FOR PHYSICIAN ASSISTANTS (PA'S) AND NURSE PRACTITIONERS (NP'S) INTERESTED IN OBTAINING FURTHER EXPERIENCE IN PSYCHIATRY. THIS IS ONE OF THREE PROGRAMS IN THE UNITED STATES THAT OFFERS POST GRADUATE TRAINING FOR PA'S AND THE FIRST POST-GRADUATE PROGRAM FOR NP'S IN THE FIELD OF PSYCHIATRY. THE FELLOWS PARTICIPATE IN A PROGRAM THAT IS 12 MONTHS IN DURATION, AND RECEIVE CLINICAL AS WELL AS DIDACTIC INSTRUCTION THAT EMPHASIZES DIFFERENTIAL DIAGNOSIS USING DSM V, PSYCHOPHARMACOLOGY, NEUROSCIENCE, PSYCHOLOGICAL, EMERGENCY PSYCHIATRY, ADDICTION PSYCHIATRY, AND FORENSIC PSYCHIATRY. THE PRIMARY AREAS OF FOCUS ARE ADULT INPATIENT, CRISIS, AND OUTPATIENT SERVICES. ADDITIONALLY, THE FELLOWS WILL RECEIVE CONTINUED TRAINING IN THE MANAGEMENT OF ACUTE AND CHRONIC MEDICAL CONDITIONS. THE MOTIVATION FOR DEVELOPING THIS PROGRAM WAS TO INCREASE ACCESS TO PSYCHIATRIC RESOURCES IN THE COMMUNITY, ON AN INPATIENT AND OUTPATIENT BASIS. THE MISSION IS TO GRADUATE PA'S AND NP'S WHO DEMONSTRATE CLINICAL EXPERTISE, ETHICAL BEHAVIOR, LEADERSHIP SKILLS, CULTURAL AWARENESS, PROFESSIONALISM AND ONGOING COMMITMENT TO LEARNING.

FOR THE PILOT, REGIONS IDENTIFIED PATIENTS WHO HAD USED ITS EMERGENCY DEPARTMENT FIVE OR MORE TIMES IN THE PREVIOUS YEAR AND HAD ONE OR MORE CHRONIC HEALTH CONDITIONS, SERIOUS AND PERSISTENT MENTAL ILLNESS, AND LONG HISTORIES OF HOMELESSNESS. FROM THE PATIENTS IDENTIFIED BY REGIONS, SEVEN INDIVIDUALS WERE ENROLLED IN THE HOSPITAL TO HOME PILOT BETWEEN AUGUST 2009 AND MAY 2010. HOSPITAL TO HOME AIMS TO:- SUPPORT PARTICIPANTS IN SECURING STABLE HOUSING, WHICH IS A STRONG DETERMINANT OF POSITIVE PHYSICAL AND MENTAL HEALTH OUTCOMES.- REDUCE PARTICIPANT EMERGENCY DEPARTMENT VISITS, THUS FREEING UP EMERGENCY DEPARTMENT RESOURCES FOR ACUTE MEDICAL CRISES AND REDUCING UNNECESSARY HEALTHCARE EXPENDITURES.- INCREASE PARTICIPANT RELATIONSHIPS WITH PRIMARY CARE CLINICS SO THEY WILL SEEK MEDICAL CARE FROM CLINICS RATHER THAN EMERGENCY DEPARTMENTS.- ASSIST PARTICIPANTS WITH ACCESSING AFFORDABLE MEDICATIONS FROM A LIMITED NUMBER OF PHARMACIES TO ALLOW FOR MEDICATION MONITORING.- PROMOTE PARTICIPANT SELF-RELIANCE AND LIFE FUNCTIONING.2014 ACCOMPLISHMENTS: THE 2014 HOSPITAL TO HOME COHORT INCLUDED 17 PARTICIPANTS.

ALL CARE PLANS ARE VIEWABLE TO ALL HOSPITAL CARE PROVIDERS. THE PLAN ALLOWS FOR CONTINUITY OF CARE FOR CONDITIONS LIKE NARCOTIC SEEKING BEHAVIOR, VERBAL ABUSE OF STAFF, ETC. WHEN THE PATIENT IS SEEN IN THE EMERGENCY DEPARTMENT, THE PROVIDER REVIEWS THE CARE PLAN RECOMMENDATIONS AND TALKS THROUGH TREATMENT OPTIONS FOR THE PATIENT. A PATIENT IS NOTIFIED OF THEIR CARE PLAN ONCE IT IS CREATED, AND THE SPECIFIC TREATMENT OPTIONS ARE DOCUMENTED IN THE ELECTRONIC MEDICAL RECORD (EMR) AND AVAILABLE TO REGIONS' EMERGENCY DEPARTMENT PHYSICIANS AND NURSES. THE PURPOSE IS TO SUPPORT HIGHER QUALITY, SAFER CARE FOR THE PATIENT IN THE BEST AVAILABLE SETTING. THE CARE PLAN SPECIFIES A TREATMENT PATHWAY FOR THE PATIENT RELATING TO THE CONDITION THAT SEEMS TO PRECIPITATE THE EXCESSIVE ED VISIT AND/OR HOSPITAL ADMISSIONS. WHEN A PATIENT RETURNS TO THE ED, PROVIDERS FOLLOW THE CARE PLAN OUTLINED IN THE EMR, WHICH ALLOWS FOR CONSISTENT CARE AND COMMUNICATION AMONG THE NUMEROUS PROVIDERS IN OUR ED. CURRENTLY IT IS A MANUAL PROCESS TO DEVELOP AND ENTER A CARE PLAN INTO THE EMR, AND THE CREATION OF A WORKFLOW MAP FOR CREATION OF THESE PLANS HAS RECENTLY BEEN COMPLETED. THE WORK PLAN IS TO DEVELOP A MORE SYSTEMIC PROCESS THAT WILL ROLL OUT IN 1Q2015 TO LEVERAGE EPIC TO OBTAIN MORE REFERRALS AND SUPPORT FOR GATHERING INFORMATION TO STREAMLINE THE PROVIDERS' DECISION MAKING FOR THE CARE PLAN. - PROGRESS: SINCE OCTOBER 2014, 55 PATIENTS WERE REFERRED FOR ED CARE PLAN EVALUATION. THE ED CARE PLAN COMMITTEE HAS REVIEWED 10 AND IMPLEMENTED CARE PLANS FOR ALL PATIENTS. THE COMMITTEE WILL CONTINUE TO MEET REGULARLY TO REVIEW THE ADDITIONAL REFERRED PATIENTS AND DETERMINE WHETHER A CARE PLAN IS NEEDED. OUR EVALUATION OF DATA FOR HOSPITAL MEDICINE CARE PLANS SHOWED PATIENT REFERRED FOR A HOSPITAL MEDICINE CARE PLAN HAD AN AVERAGE DECREASE OF 1.31 ED VISITS IN THE 90-DAYS POST CARE PLAN IMPLEMENTATION. SIMILARLY, HOSPITAL ADMISSIONS WERE REDUCED BY AN AVERAGE OF 1.08 IN THE 90-DAYS POST IMPLEMENTATION."

THIS WORK INTENDS TO IMPROVE HEALTH OUTCOMES AND THE EXPERIENCE FOR PATIENTS WITH CHRONIC OR COMPLEX CONDITIONS BY INTEGRATING SERVICES AND SMOOTHING HANDOVERS AND TRANSITIONS. THIS INITIATIVE INCLUDES:- POPULATION HEALTH MANAGEMENT BY DEVELOPING CARE PLANS FOR USE ACROSS THE CONTINUUM OF CARE AND PROVIDING A VARIETY OF SUPPORTS TO PATIENTS TO HELP THEM MANAGE OR IMPROVE THEIR CONDITION.- REDUCING READMISSIONS BY ENSURING SMOOTH CARE TRANSITIONS AND ENHANCING PATIENT SUPPORTS.- REDUCING USE OF THE EMERGENCY DEPARTMENT BY EDUCATING AND LINKING PATIENTS WITH A VARIETY OF WAYS TO ACCESS PRIMARY CARE INCLUDING PHONE VISITS, A NURSE CARELINE, ONLINE SERVICES AND CLINIC VISITS.- AS DESCRIBED BY ATUL GAWANDE, HOT SPOTTING IS USING GEOGRAPHIC INFORMATION SYSTEMS TO IDENTIFY GEOGRAPHIC AND DEMOGRAPHIC PREDICTORS FOR PREVENTABLE EMERGENCY DEPARTMENT PATIENT VISITS THAT ARE PROXY INDICATORS OF POOR COMMUNITY HEALTH AND HEALTHCARE ACCESS. REGIONS EMERGENCY DEPARTMENT WILL IMPROVE HEALTH AND HEALTHCARE QUALITY AND TO THEREBY REDUCE COSTS BY DEVELOPING COLLABORATIVE COMMUNITY HEALTH SOLUTIONS FOR PREVENTABLE CONDITIONS BY ANALYZING ED UTILIZATION DATA USING GEOGRAPHIC INFORMATION SYSTEMS (GIS) TO IDENTIFY GEOGRAPHIC AND DEMOGRAPHIC ""HOTSPOT"" PREDICTORS FOR PREVENTABLE EMERGENCY DEPARTMENT PATIENT VISITS AND PREDICTIONS OF PREVENTABLE EMERGENCY ROOM VISITS. THIS WILL BE USED TO DEVELOP AN ALERT IN THE ELECTRONIC MEDICAL RECORD (EMR) TO IDENTIFY PATIENTS MOST AT RISK OF EMERGENCY DEPARTMENT UTILIZATION. THAT EMR ALERT WILL THEN BE INTEGRATED AS A TRIGGER FOR TARGETED SUPPORT THROUGH OUR COMMUNITY PARTNERS. 2014 ACCOMPLISHMENTS: REGIONS INTEGRATION EFFORTS CONTINUED IN 2014 WITH A FOCUS ON CARE PLANS TO HELP PATIENTS MANAGE THEIR CARE, TRANSITIONS WORK TO CONNECT PATIENTS THROUGH THE CARE CONTINUUM AND CASE MANAGEMENT SUPPORT IN THE ED AND HOSPITAL UNITS TO FACILITATE SAFE AND APPROPRIATE DISCHARGES AND MANAGE READMISSION RISK.REGIONS CONVENED AN INTERDISCIPLINARY COMMITTEE, WHICH MEETS MONTHLY TO ADDRESS ED VISITS AND HOSPITAL ADMISSIONS. CARE PLANS ARE IMPLEMENTED ON PATIENTS CONSIDERED HIGH RISK INCLUDING THOSE WITH NARCOTIC ABUSING/SEEKING BEHAVIOR AND THOSE WITH HIGH RATES OF POTENTIALLY MEDICALLY UNNECESSARY ED VISITS.ALSO IMBEDDED IN THE ED ARE CARE MANAGERS WHO PROVIDE EDUCATION AND SUPPORT TO PATIENTS, CONNECT THEM TO PRIMARY CARE AND TO COMMUNITY RESOURCES. IN ADDITION, GEOGRAPHIC STUDIES WERE COMPLETED AND WE ARE PARTNERING WITH COMMUNITY PARAMEDICS IN NEIGHBORHOODS WHERE WE SEE A HIGH UTILIZATION OF THE EMERGENCY DEPARTMENT. MANY EFFORTS ARE IN PLACE TO MANAGE RISK OF READMISSION. AN ALGORITHM WAS BUILT TO ASSIGN A SCORE TO PATIENTS REPRESENTING THEIR RISK FOR RISK FOR READMISSION. THIS SCORE, ALONG WITH OTHER CRITERIA, IS USED BY CARE MANAGEMENT STAFF AND PHYSICIANS TO PUT IN PLACE ACTIVITIES TO MANAGE THE RISK. REGIONS CARE MANAGEMENT WORKS CLOSELY WITH THE HEALTHPLAN DISEASE AND CASE MANAGEMENT STAFF TO ENSURE HIGH RISK PATIENTS ARE BEING FOLLOWED OUTSIDE THE HOSPITAL. REGIONS CARE MANAGEMENT ALSO WORKS CLOSELY WITH GERIATRICS, HOSPICE AND HOME CARE TO ESTABLISH SMOOTH TRANSITIONS AND EXCHANGE OF INFORMATION. REGULAR MEETINGS TAKE PLACE WITH TCU'S, LTAC'S, SNF'S AND OTHER FACILITIES TO ESTABLISH AND MAINTAIN PROCESSES THAT SUPPORT EFFICIENT AND EFFECTIVE TRANSITIONS TO AND FROM THE ACUTE CARE SETTING.PROGRAM METRICS:2014 RE-ADMISSION RATE: 10.45%WORK CLOSELY WITH COMMUNITY CLINICSREGIONS WORKED CLOSELY WITH COMMUNITY CLINIC PARTNERS IN THE SERVICE AREA ON CONTINUITY OF CARE AND LINKAGES TO REGIONS, AS PART OF THE EAST METRO SAFETY NET. HEALTHPARTNERS MEDICAL GROUP PHYSICIANS CONTINUE TO PROVIDE ON CALL SERVICES FOR THESE CLINICS WHEN THEIR PATIENTS ARE HOSPITALIZED AT REGIONS.REGIONS CONDUCTED A TELEMEDICINE SERVICES PILOT TO ASSIST SMALL HOSPITALS AND RURAL COMMUNITIES TO INCREASE ACCESS TO CLINICAL EXPERTISE IN SELECT SUBSPECIALTY AREAS. BASED ON COMMUNITY CLINIC FEEDBACK, REGIONS IDENTIFIED THE NEED TO PROVIDE MORE STREAMLINED AND TIMELY ACCESS TO A PATIENT'S RECORD ONCE A PATIENT RECEIVED CARE AT REGIONS AND SUBSEQUENTLY RETURNED TO THEIR HOME CLINICS (BASED ON PATIENT'S PERMISSION). REGIONS HAS COMMITTED AND IS IN THE PROCESS OF IMPLEMENTING A NEW PORTAL THAT WILL PROVIDE EASIER ACCESS TO THE PATIENT'S ELECTRONIC HEALTH RECORD. THIS PORTAL WILL PROVIDE SECURE ACCESS WITHOUT THE NEED OF AN ADDITIONAL SECURITY TOKEN VIA THE INTERNET. PATIENTS WHO IDENTIFY A PHYSICIAN OR CLINIC IN THE COMMUNITY WILL BE PUBLISHED TO THEIR LIST OF PATIENTS FOR EASE OF SELECTION. PRIORITY 5: PROMOTE CHANGE IN UNHEALTHY LIFESTYLES (TOBACCO / ALCOHOL / SUBSTANCE ABUSE)REGIONS ALCOHOL AND DRUG ABUSE PROGRAM (ADAP)REGIONS ALCOHOL AND DRUG ABUSE PROGRAM (ADAP), ESTABLISHED IN 1972, MATCHES CLIENTS WITH APPROPRIATE COMMUNITY RESOURCES TO BUILD THE FOUNDATION FOR VIABLE, SUSTAINABLE RECOVERY. THE STAFF OF LICENSED DRUG AND ALCOHOL COUNSELORS ARE SUPPORTED BY A TEAM OF MENTAL HEALTH CARE PROFESSIONALS. THROUGH LONG-ESTABLISHED COMMUNITY RELATIONSHIPS WITH SOCIAL SERVICE, COUNTY AGENCIES, AND FINANCIAL AND HOUSING ORGANIZATIONS, REGIONS ADAP PROGRAM WILL CONTINUE TO CONNECT CLIENTS WITH APPROPRIATE COMMUNITY RESOURCES TO SUPPORT THEIR LONG-TERM RECOVERY.THE ADAP PROGRAM NAVIGATED SEVERAL CHANGES IN MANAGEMENT AND STAFFING STRUCTURE IN 2014. IN SEPTEMBER OF 2014, THE FINAL LEADERSHIP STRUCTURE WAS IN PLACE AND SINCE THAT TIME, EFFORTS HAVE FOCUSED ON INCREASING THE AVAILABILITY OF RESIDENTIAL AND OUTPATIENT PROGRAMS, BY INCREASING STAFF NUMBERS AND EXPERTISE, IMPROVING THE AMOUNT AND QUALITY OF PROGRAMMING, AND BY ACTIVELY BUILDING RELATIONSHIPS WITH OUR REFERRAL SOURCES AND COMMUNITY PARTNERS. AS A RESULT OF CHANGES, VOLUMES OF PATIENTS SERVED IN RESIDENTIAL, OUTPATIENT AND ASSESSMENT CLINICS HAVE BEEN INCREASING, AS HAVE THE PATIENTS' LEVEL OF SATISFACTION. 2014 ACCOMPLISHMENTS:- STREAMLINED INTAKE PROCESS- EDUCATED STAFF ON EVIDENCE BASED, GENDER SPECIFIC PROGRAMMING- DEVELOPED MARKETING BROCHURES AND BEGAN COMMUNITY MEETINGS TO INCREASE KNOWLEDGE OF ADAP SERVICES- UPDATED ENVIRONMENT WITH NEW CENTRAL STATION, EXERCISE ROOM, CLIENT LOUNGES.- TRAINED ALL STAFF IN MOTIVATIONAL INTERVIEWING- ADAP SERVED OVER 9800 CLIENTS IN RESIDENTIAL CARE AND PROVIDED APPROXIMATELY 30,000 HOURS IN OUTPATIENT COUNSELING. PROGRAM METRICS:- IN PROCESS OF DEVELOPING PROGRAM METRICS PARALLEL WITH GUIDELINES FROM SUBSTANCE ABUSE AND MENTAL HEALTH SERVICES ADMINISTRATION. PLANNED METRICS ARE: - CLIENT SATISFACTION - READMISSIONS - WAITING LIST >7 DAYS/SIZE OF LIST - % OCCUPANCY - COMPLETION % - HOMELESSNESS - MEDICAL CO-MORBIDITY - SYMPTOM REDUCTIONSCREENING, BRIEF INTERVENTION AND REFERRAL TO TREATMENT (SBIRT)SCREENING, BRIEF INTERVENTION, AND REFERRAL TO TREATMENT (SBIRT) IS AN EVIDENCE-BASED PRACTICE USED TO IDENTIFY, REDUCE, AND PREVENT PROBLEMATIC USE, ABUSE, AND DEPENDENCE ON ALCOHOL AND ILLICIT DRUGS. FOR APPROPRIATE EMERGENCY DEPARTMENT AND TRAUMA PATIENTS, REGIONS USED THE SBIRT TOOL AND SCREENED 2,311 PATIENTS FOR YEAR 2014.NEEDS NOT ADDRESSED IN CHNA:""INCREASE ACCESS TO DENTAL SERVICES"" WAS IDENTIFIED AS THE SIXTH PRIORITY IN THE COMMUNITIES SERVED BY REGIONS, LAKEVIEW, HUDSON AND WESTFIELDS HOSPITALS. WHILE THIS IS A CONCERN IN THE COMMUNITY, THE TEAM DECIDED TO FOCUS THEIR EFFORTS ON THE OTHER FIVE PRIORITIES BECAUSE HEALTHPARTNERS AS AN INSURANCE COMPANY IS CURRENTLY THE LEADING DENTAL CARE PROVIDER TO UNINSURED PEOPLE IN MINNEAPOLIS/ST. PAUL. ACCESS TO DENTAL CARE IS NOT A CORE SERVICE LINE FOR REGIONS AND IS OUTSIDE THE SCOPE OF REGIONS' INFLUENCE. AS A RESULT, COMMUNITY BENEFIT ACTIVITIES WOULD BE MORE BENEFICIAL IN THE OTHER PRIORITIZED AREAS. WHILE OVERALL THE TEAM DECIDED NOT TO FOCUS EFFORTS ON ORAL HEALTH SERVICES, IT IS NOTEWORTHY THAT ST. CROIX COUNTY IS ADDRESSING ""ORAL HEALTH"" AS A SUBSET WITHIN THE ""ACCESS TO PRIMARY AND PREVENTIVE HEALTH SERVICES"" HEALTH PRIORITY AND TASK FORCE."

The hospital took into account input from individuals by interviews and focus groups that captured personal perspectives from community members, providers and leaders with insight and expertise. To assist with the CHNA process, WPAHS, Inc. retained a planning and research firm. Schedule H, Part V, Line 11 Addressing the Needs Identified In the CHNA The hospital is addressing the significant needs identified in the most recent CHNA by community education, outreach and health screening, physician and Emergency Medical Services outreach and training and programs to help patients navigate the continuum of care. Some needs identified in the most recently conducted Community Health Needs Assessment (CHNA) are not addressed by implementation strategy programs because existing hospital and community resources work to address these needs. West Penn Allegheny Health System, Inc. evaluated all top priority needs and put forth plans to address the needs we felt we were best positioned to make a positive impact for the betterment of the health of the communities we serve. Various needs outlined in the CHNA will not be addressed through these planning efforts. These needs will not be addressed as a result of prioritization efforts, which included individuals with expertise in public health and representatives of underserved populations, the need was ranked low for any one or more of the following reasons: 1) the hospital was not identified as the accountable entity; 2) the need falls outside of the hospital area of expertise; 3) the issue is already being addressed by existing community assets; or 4) necessary internal resources to meet the need are lacking. Schedule H, Part V, Line 13h West Penn Allegheny Health System, Inc. is part of the integrated delivery system named Allegheny Health Network. In 2014, West Penn Allegheny Health System, Inc. adopted the Allegheny Health Network Financial Assistance Policy. During 2014, Allegheny Health Network enhanced its Financial Assistance Policy with a Presumptive eligibility program that enables AHN to make an informed decision on the financial need of patients utilizing the best estimates available in the absence of information provided directly by the patient. The Health system utilizes a healthcare industry-recognized model that is based on public record databases. This predictive model incorporates public record data to calculate a socio-economic and financial capacity score that includes estimates for income, assets and liquidity. The electronic technology is designed to assess each patient to the same standards and is calibrated against historical approvals for AHN financial assistance under the traditional application process. The electronic technology is deployed prior to bad debt assignment after all other eligibility and payment sources have been exhausted. This allows AHN to screen all patients for financial assistance prior to pursuing any extraordinary collection actions. The data returned from this electronic eligibility review will constitute adequate documentation of financial need under our policy. When electronic enrollment is used as the basis for presumptive eligibility, the highest discount of full free care is granted for eligible services for retrospective dates of service only."
201503179349302525,250969492,"Schedule H, Part V, Line 22d","Charges For Medical Care West Penn Allegheny Health System offers uninsured patients a fifty percent (50%) discount on total gross charges to all hospital charges. The intent of the discount is to standardize charging practices for covered and non covered patients. The discount is offered during patient contact for elective/ urgent (non cosmetic) procedures during the financial counseling process, as well as during the patient statement cycle process for services provided (including Emergency services.) Patient statements are clearly marked with the uninsured discount, reducing the ""amount owed"" of the gross charges. An uninsured discount of 50% is applied to the patient account either at the time of payment or prior to transferring the account to bad debt upon conclusion of the routine four statement cycle, for any unpaid balances. This methodology is applied consistently among the three Hospitals of West Penn Allegheny Health System, Inc."

The principal investigator provided oversight to the surveying process including data collection and entry. Data was collected and entered using a web-based survey. This report was compiled and verified for accuracy by members of the Kanawha Coalition for Community Health Improvement. This survey sample size results in a statistically significant 95% confidence interval with an error margin of plus or minus 5.63%. Not all respondents answered every question; therefore the margin of error was adjusted and reported for each question, based on the number of respondents. An independent sampling firm randomly selected landline telephone numbers for Kanawha County households. The random landline sample consisted of 4,000 numbers which was screened for disconnects and businesses, resulting in a list of 2,000 numbers. A total of sixteen individuals received training and administered the phone survey. After learning that the number of American homes with only wireless telephones continues to grow and that 39.4% of American homes had only wireless telephones (January - June 2013 National Health Interview Survey), the Kanawha Coalition acquired a random address sample of 5,000 additional Kanawha County residents which included wireless and some unlisted numbers. The wireless sample received postcards in the mail directing them to the online survey or to call the Kanawha Coalition to arrange a convenient time to take the survey by telephone. The Kanawha Coalition process works to ensure that the survey sample size is valid, and that the sample is randomly selected. It also ensured that the fourth-year nursing students with the University of Charleston's School of Nursing were adequately trained in how to administer the phone survey. As with any telephone survey, there are certain limitations. The result of the survey depends on the accuracy of the responses given by the persons interviewed. Self-reported behavior must be interpreted with caution. To assure proper sampling distribution, the demographics of the survey respondents were compared to county demographics based on 2010 U.S. Census data. This comparison reveals an over-representation of respondents who were female, over 55 years of age, had no children in the home and were Caucasian. There was an under-representation of African Americans, people with lower-educational attainment (high school or less), those with children in the home, and those who had never been married. The Kanawha Coalition conducted focus groups among individuals from these underrepresented populations. Focus group findings are intentionally reported independently from those of the scientific random telephone survey to maintain fidelity. Focus GroupsSix focus groups were held in 2013. A total of 15 senior citizens, 14 single-parents, and 10 African Americans participated. Host sites for the focus groups included the Kanawha Institute for Social Research and Action (KISRA), Shiloh Baptist Church, the United Way of Central West Virginia (Retired Senior Volunteer Program), and the Martin Luther King Community Center (after school program). Focus group participants were asked to share their opinions about barriers and challenges facing their particular population regarding access to health services, social and economic factors (e.g. employment, education, access to technology, and community attitudes surrounding discrimination, racism), the physical ""built"" environment (e.g. housing, access to healthy foods, air and water quality) and any other top health issues and pressing concerns."

Springfield Regional Medical Center (SRMC) and community representatives worked together to gather data and analyze the current health care needs in our region. A meeting was held on October 22, 2012 to review the data which included the following topics: * General Health Status * Prevalence of Disease * Lifestyle Choices * Early Detection * Immunization * Accident Prevention * Children's Health Attendees included representatives from Clark County Combined Health District (CCCHD), Community Health Foundation, Community Mercy Health Partners, Hyden Consulting (RHC/MHS), Rocking Horse Center, and the Springfield Foundation. Discussion led to the invitation of the following organizations to join the coalition: United Way of Clark, Champaign and Madison Counties; Ohio Valley Medical Center; local Dental and Medical Societies; Mental Health Board; United Senior Services/Area Agency on Aging; and Dayton Children's/Nationwide Children's Hospitals (for data on Clark County Pediatrics). The epidemiologist at CCCHD and Springfield Regional Medical Center staff worked together to gather ICD-9 data. Springfield Regional Medical Center participated in the Clark County Community Health Assessment that began in October 2012 and ended in June 2013 after twelve meetings. A team of Wright State University researchers reviewed current literature to identify evidence-based practices (EBP) that could be used to remedy the priority issues. Task forces reconvened in April 2013 with nine (9) subsequent meetings to review the data and prioritize the needs. A meeting was held in June 2013 with all partners to review and approve the priority list. Feedback collected from this meeting was used to refine research efforts and develop action steps to implement the chosen strategies. This information was organized into an action plan by the Wright State team and distributed to task force participants for review in October 2012."

201523179349301697,310785684,"Schedule H, Part V, Section B, Line 11 Facility , 1","Facility , 1 - Springfield Regional Medical Center. Springfield Regional Medical Center (SRMC) is addressing the significant needs identified in the most recently conducted CHNA as follows: 1. Mental Health Wellbeing - Currently, SRMC is partnering in Clark County to work with the State in the area of medical Mental Health Homes and managed care so our focus in on prevention. MHRB advocates adoption of treatment overlay; the FQHC provides mental health services; there is an array of MH providers for adults and youth (Osterlin, Catholic Charities, Well Spring, Rocking Horse-and Medicaid is available through all providers); MHRB is beginning a focus on prevention using the Good Behavior Game (GBG) in local schools, which is also embedded in the local university's education program curriculum; A Trauma informed care initiative at SRMC; Crisis intervention training done by the board on a regular basis to first responders where focus is recognition and referral. 2. Chronic Disease Management - A large portion of the city of Springfield is a Health Professionals Shortage Area (HPSA). The County does have an FQHC, but while it does have new physical capacity, the facility has dropped from four physicians to two with one of those two being the medical director. SRMC has worked with the FQHC, first by providing $150,000.00 to recruit and hire additional providers. SRMC and the FQHC have established a process for patients being discharged from the hospital with a diagnosis of diabetes and without a PCP, to schedule the first follow up appointment and become an established patient at the FQHC. This success of this program is proven by the zero readmission rate of these patients and a reduction in their A1C levels and overall improved health. 3. Substance Abuse - Clark County, like many communities in the country, is experiencing an increase in the use of heroin among other substance abuse trends. The community determined that the primary barrier to improving substance abuse prevention strategies is the overall lack of capacity in the County. To get to the point of targeting the highest priority strategies, the community first needs to build data collection and analysis capacity. Such capacity will enable the community to make a firm case for the need for more resources, then to obtain additional professionals, and to be able to prioritize and disseminate effective prevention interventions. In terms of community strengths, there is wide community support to follow the Strategic Prevention Framework and to pursue participation by the 12 partnering sectors recommended by the Substance Abuse and Mental Health Services Administration (SAMHSA). Additionally SRMC is part of the Drug Death Review Team whose purpose is to perform a multidisciplinary review of all unintentional drug deaths occurring in Clark County, identifying interventions to reduce the rate of drug deaths. Identified needs that are not being addressed specifically by SRMC 1. Obesity - Implement a child health, multi-dimensional, school-wide, evidence-based program in Lincoln Elementary as a pilot program to determine what works then scale up to additional schools. The Obesity Task Force determined that a core criterion for their decision was prevention, and therefore their focus is on youth in schools, which also engages parents, via a multidimensional, school-wide, child health evidence-based program. 2. Healthy Births - To identify and engage pregnant women in first trimester prenatal care. Partnering Agencies are Clark County Combined Health District including its WIC program, the Community Foundation, the Pregnancy Resource Center, Clark County Department of Job and Family Services, and Springfield's Women's Network. The gap analysis uncovered the need for better outreach to pregnant women to get them to the FQHC's OB program. A concerning proportion of pregnant women delay prenatal care, and this trend is especially evident among the growing Spanish speaking-only households, where it is not uncommon for pregnant women to get a confirmation of pregnancy at 4-6 months."

In addition, Mercy Memorial Hospital participated in the Champaign County Community Health Plan process beginning in November 2012 with six (6) meetings and concluding in June 2013. A team of Wright State University researchers reviewed current literature to identify evidence-based practices (EBP) that could be used to remedy the priority issues.

Feedback collected from this meeting was used to refine research efforts and develop action steps to implement the chosen strategies. This information was organized into an action plan by the Wright State team and distributed to task force participants for review in October 2012. A community health planning cycle was used to analyze the data in 5 steps: 1. Self-assessment 2. Build the partnership 3. Conduct planning Activities 4. Task forces 5. Evaluation A total of five meetings were held thereafter with Wright State consisting of the first steering meeting, two task force meetings (community and internal), and a second steering committee meeting to combine all the data. Active partners in this process included representatives from the Champaign County Mental Health/Suicide Coalition, County Health Commissioner, YMCA, Mercy Memorial Hospital, Drug Free Youth Coalition, Early Childhood Coordinating Committee, Family & Children First Council, Caring Kitchen, Mercy Well Child Pediatrics, local Cancer Association, Champaign County Board of Developmentally Delayed , Educational Services Center Office, Transitions Counseling, Home Health and area churches as well as the Administrators of local senior residential facilities, superintendents of Champaign County and Urbana City schools, North Lewisburg Township Trustees and the county's Medical Director.

In addition, Cooper performed the following: (1) A survey of ""key informants"". Key informants were defined as community stakeholders with expert knowledge including public health and health care professionals, social service providers, non-profit leaders, business leaders, faith-based organizations, and other area authorities. An on-line survey tool gathered qualitative feedback from 113 key informants regarding perceptions of community needs and strengths across 3 key domains: - key health issues - health care access - challenges and solutions (2) A household telephone survey was conducted with 575 randomly-selected community residents. It assessed health status, health risk behaviors, preventive health practices, and health care access primarily related to chronic disease and injury. (3) Two focus group were created and held with twenty-two community members and data collection sessions were conducted at four locations in Camden City to ensure broad participation from diverse groups including members of medically underserved, low income and minority populations. 165 Camden City residents took an abbreviated version of the household telephone survey tool and responses were collected through wireless keypad technology.

The 2014 Healthy Community Study included analysis of various extant data related to demographics, social and economic factors, physical environment, clinical care, healthy behaviors, and health outcomes. In addition, the survey tool that was used targeted the following health related areas: general health, chronic disease/obesity, behavioral health, and maternal/prenatal and early childhood. The latter three areas had been identified in previous studies as priority areas. By focusing on these health related areas, more focused, timely, and longitudinal information will be available to evaluate effects of targeted efforts. In the analysis, some demographic and social and economic deficits were revealed. Specifically, the local community showed deficits around poverty percentages as compared to the state and to the US. In addition, the data revealed deficits in educational attainment rates around high school and college diploma rates as compared to the state. While these are crucial areas that need to be addressed by the community, many other organizations are more knowledgeable and better equipped to develop strategies to improve these areas. Programs and strategies have been and are being developed by a multitude of community organizations to begin to affect the educational attainment and poverty deficits. Some of these organizations include The Rockford Public School System, Rock Valley College, Alignment Rockford, Transform Rockford, Rockford Literacy Council, etc. While Rockford Health System does play a role in supporting these organizations and efforts, our community benefit plan focuses on affecting the health needs/deficits of the local community."

IT WAS EVIDENT EARLY ON IN THE COMMUNITY HEALTH PLANNING PROCESS THAT A STRATEGIC APPROACH TO IDENTIFYING AND SELECTING PRIORITIES THAT WOULD HAVE THE GREATEST IMPACT ON THE OVERALL HEALTH OF CLINTON COUNTY WAS NECESSARY. BY FOCUSING ON CLINTON COUNTY DATA AND SURVEY RESULTS AND USING FEEDBACK FROM THE COMMUNITY PLANNING SESSION (STAKEHOLDER SESSION), THREE FOCUS AREAS WERE IDENTIFIED IN THE CHA AS COMMUNITY HEALTH NEEDS - MENTAL HEALTH AND SUBSTANCE ABUSE, BUILD ENVIRONMENT, AND CHRONIC DISEASE MANAGEMENT. CVPH, IN CONJUNCTION WITH THE CCHD, HAS CHOSEN TO FOCUS ON MENTAL HEALTH AND SUBSTANCE ABUSE AND BUILD ENVIRONMENT FOR THE NEXT 3-4 YEARS. CHRONIC DISEASE WAS A PRIORITY AREA IN THE LAST CHA. THE COMMUNITY HEALTH ASSESSMENT TEAM, COMPRISED OF CVPH, CCHD, AND COMMUNITY REPRESENTATIVES, FELT THAT POSITIVE MOMENTUM HAS BEEN MADE IN CHRONIC DISEASE OVER THE PAST 3 YEARS THAT MAY NOT BE EVIDENT YET IN SOME OF THE DATA USED TO IDENTIFY HEALTH NEEDS. IN ADDITION, THE COMMUNITY HEALTH ASSESSMENT TEAM FELT THAT CHOOSING MENTAL HEALTH AND SUBSTANCE ABUSE AND BUILD ENVIRONMENT WOULD HAVE A DOWNSTREAM IMPACT ON CHRONIC DISEASE MANAGEMENT.

With this in mind, NYM aimed to increase already existing programming in these two areas by partnering with local coalitions, churches, schools and community based organizations. As part of our Community Service Plan, we chose to focus on ""Preventing Chronic Diseases"" by ""increasing access to high-quality chronic disease preventive care and management in clinical and community settings."" One way we are doing this is by promoting culturally relevant chronic disease self-management education with free monthly classes open to the community like the Diabetes and Insulin Pump Support Groups. We also regularly address community concerns regarding chronic diseases by providing free screenings and health lectures both on and off of the Hospital's main campus. Clinically, NYM hosts diabetes management education classes, and a Comprehensive Weight Management Program. Another NYS Prevention Agenda priority area we are focusing on is ""Reducing Obesity in Children and Adults"" by ""increasing participation of adults in a class to learn how to manage their chronic condition."" In 2014, NYM offered a ""Dance Your Heart Healthy"" program, providing free weekly heart-pumping dance classes to residents in Bedford Stuyvesant. The program has been successful, with the majority of attendees reporting that they lost weight, increased their energy levels and improved their sleeping habits due to participation in the classes. The Hospital also runs a free weekly Breastfeeding Support Group which encourages and teaches new mothers to provide wholesome nutrition to their infants in the form of breast milk. NYM will continue its work addressing diabetes and obesity in Brooklyn, in addition to many other health conditions. We continue to provide a general community outreach program which hosts rougly 300 annual events, including health lectures and support groups targeting various health concerns, including cancer, hepatitis C, and pulmonary hypertension."

SJRH is an active participant in the Health Planning Team. Participating hospitals and health centers helped guide the Community Health Needs Assessment (CHNA) process by providing community input into the design of its framework and implementation plan. The public input process encompassed the following primary collaborations: WCDOH's Healthy Hospital's collaborative, Health Planning Team, and Health Summit; Healthy Yonkers Initiative; SJRH Community Advisory Committee, and the maternity and HIV partnerships. WHILE SJRH COLLABORATED WITH THESE UNRELATED ORGANIZATIONS THROUGH THE CHNA PROCESS, IT DOCUMENTED ITS COMMUNITY HEALTH NEEDS ASSESSMENT IN A SEPARATE WRITTEN REPORT. SJRH has experienced significant public involvement and enthusiasm, as community relationships were fortified and new ones were established with numerous health-related associations. To ensure a broad assessment of our community health needs we engaged a variety of participants including, but not limited to, the community at large through local residents participating in SJRH Speakers Bureau health education programs. We shared health data and sought feedback through the following SJRH groups: Community Advisory Committee, Employee Wellness Committee, Pastoral Care Committee, Radiology Advisory Committee, Physician Alignment Committee, Board of Trustees and our employees. SJRH also gathered information from external sources by conducting public forums at the Cross County Shopping Center in Yonkers, New York and other health sessions held at select locations to address the community that represented the diverse population that we serve. The hospital receives input from the community and patients through periodic focus groups, patient satisfaction surveys, sent by a third party provider and on-line surveys. Patient experience feedback is also captured through traditional compliment and complaint letters received through administration. SJRH'S 2013 COMMUNITY HEALTH NEEDS ASSESSMENT WAS CONDUCTED TO INCLUDE ITS THREE RELATED HOSPITAL FACILITIES (SJR HOSPITAL ANDRUS PAVILION, SJR PARK CARE PAVILION, AND SJR DOBBS FERRY PAVILION), AND A JOINT REPORT WAS ISSUED. THE FACILITIES SERVE A DIVERSE POPULATION IN WESTCHESTER COUNTY AND SHARE AN AUTHORIZED BODY WHICH ADOPTED THE JOINT REPORT. PART V, LINE 7A AND 10A THE HOSPITAL'S 2013 CHNA AND IMPLEMENTATION STRATGY CAN BE FOUND AT THE FOLLOWING WEBSITE: www.riversidehealth.org/About/CommunityServicePlan PART V, LINE 11 ADDRESSING COMMUNITY NEEDS The SJRH community health priorities were selected as part of a countywide planning process facilitated by the Westchester County Department of Health's (WCDOH) Health Planning Team, of which SJRH is an active participant. We formally collaborated with the WCDOH assessing needs, determining priorities, developing interventions and implementation of our CHNA. The service area assessed was Westchester County. The NYS Prevention Agenda 2013-2017 assisted in guiding our collaboration in development of our plan around community health improvement priorities that are consistent with the population health principles embodied in federal and state health care reform. Following review of this data and results from the myriad of community health assessments conducted by SJRH, we prioritized needs and developed a plan. The following is a summary of priority areas and goals identified in our most recently conducted CHNA are being addressed and are updated as follows: Priority 1: Prevent Chronic Diseases Focus Area: Increase access to high-quality chronic disease preventive care and management in both clinical and community settings Goal # 1: Promote culturally relevant chronic disease self-management education. Priority Area 2: Promote Healthy Women, Infants, and Children Focus Area: Maternal and Infant Health Goal # 2: Increase the proportion of babies who are breastfed. Priority Area 3: Prevent HIV, STDs, Vaccine-Preventable Diseases, and Health Care-Associated Infections Focus Area: Human Immunodeficiency Virus (HIV) Goal # 3: Increase early access to and retention in HIV care. Focus Area: Hepatitis C Virus (HCV ) Goal # 4: Increase and coordinate HCV prevention and treatment capacity. In addition to a thorough review of the data, the priorities selected included consideration of priorities that were attainable and that aligned with each agency's mission and service area. With the diversity and the number of hospitals in the County, it was quite challenging for the team to select its priorities especially when for a number of indicators the data revealed only certain parts of the County being impacted. Priority Areas, Goals and Interventions - details ----------------------------------------------------------------- PRIORITY 1: PREVENT CHRONIC DISEASES ----------------------------------------------------------------- FOCUS: Increase access to high-quality chronic disease preventive care and management in both clinical and community settings GOAL #1: Promote culturally relevant chronic disease self-management education.

COMMUNITY HEALTH NEEDS ASSESSMENT IMPLEMENTATION PLAN EVALUATION: OVER THE PAST THREE YEARS, BRYAN HEALTH HAS WORKED DILIGENTLY TO IMPLEMENT AND CONTINUE STRATEGIES THAT WILL ALLOW THE ORGANIZATION TO MEET THE NEEDS OF THE LINCOLN COMMUNITY AS WELL AS THE SURROUNDING LANCASTER COUNTY AREA. THROUGH THE COMMUNITY HEALTH NEEDS ASSESSMENT (CHNA) IMPLEMENTATION PLAN, AND MORE RECENTLY THE NEWLY ESTABLISHED 2020 BRYAN HEALTH STRATEGIC PLAN, BRYAN HEALTH CONTINUES TO PARTNER THROUGHOUT THE CITY AND COUNTY TO IMPROVE FOUR MAJOR AREAS OUTLINED IN THE CHNA: 1) ACCESS TO CARE, 2) BEHAVIORAL HEALTH, 3) CHRONIC DISEASE PREVENTION AND 4) INJURY PREVENTION. THE FOLLOWING EVALUATION DISCUSSES STRATEGIES THAT HAVE BEEN SUSTAINED THROUGHOUT THE LAST THREE YEARS AND HIGHLIGHTS NEW AND REVISED STRATEGIES THAT HAVE BEEN PUT INTO PLACE. ALL OF THESE INITIATIVES, ALONG WITH THOSE OF BRYAN HEALTH'S COMMUNITY PARTNERS, WORK IN UNISON TO IMPROVE THE HEALTH OF THE COMMUNITY AS WE MOVE FORWARD, TOGETHER. 1. ACCESS TO CARE BRYAN HEALTH CONTINUES TO WORK WITH COMMUNITY ORGANIZATIONS, OTHER PROVIDERS, AND THE BUSINESS COMMUNITY TO IMPROVE ACCESS TO COMPREHENSIVE, HIGH-QUALITY AND AFFORDABLE HEALTH CARE SERVICES FOR ALL RESIDENTS OF LANCASTER COUNTY. SINCE COMPLETION OF THE CHNA, BRYAN HEALTH HAS EXPANDED ITS USE OF NURSE NAVIGATORS TO INCLUDE THREE ONCOLOGY NAVIGATORS THAT FOCUS ON PATIENTS WITH LUNG, BREAST, AND COLORECTAL CANCER. THERE CONTINUES TO BE A PATIENT NAVIGATOR FOR BARIATRICS AND A RESPIRATORY THERAPY PATIENT NAVIGATOR HAS BEEN ADDED FOR PATIENTS WITH COPD. AS PART OF BRYAN HEALTH, BRYAN HEART HAS ALSO IMPLEMENTED HEART FAILURE NURSE NAVIGATORS TO IDENTIFY POTENTIAL CARE GAPS THAT CAN LEAD TO READMISSIONS. THESE INDIVIDUALS ASSIST PATIENTS AND THEIR FAMILIES TO MAKE INFORMED HEALTH CARE DECISIONS AND ACCESS APPROPRIATE HEALTHCARE SERVICES. BRYAN HEALTH ALSO CONTINUES TO SUPPORT COMMUNITY HEALTH CENTERS, SUCH AS PEOPLE'S HEALTH CENTER AND CLINIC WITH A HEART, THAT SERVE INDIVIDUALS THAT MIGHT NOT OTHERWISE BE ABLE TO AFFORD PRIMARY CARE SERVICES. BRYAN HEALTH HAS MADE PROGRESS IN DEVELOPING THE INFRASTRUCTURE NEEDED TO CREATE A MEDICAL HOME WITH THE CREATION OF MYHEALTH24-7, BRYAN HEALTH'S PATIENT PORTAL AND INTEGRATED HEALTH RECORD THAT ALLOWS FOR THE EXCHANGE OF INFORMATION BETWEEN PROVIDERS. TO PROVIDE ADDITIONAL ACCESS TO PRIMARY CARE SERVICES, BRYAN HEALTH ALSO HAS LAUNCHED BRYAN HEALTH eVISIT IN 2015, WHICH IS A VIRTUAL CARE MODEL WITH 24/7 ACCESS TO A NEBRASKA BOARD CERTIFIED PHYSICIAN VIA COMPUTER OR MOBILE DEVICE. BRYAN HEALTH CONTINUES TO EDUCATE ITS KEY STAFF ON PROVISIONS OF THE AFFORDABLE CARE ACT AS THEY ARE PUT INTO PLACE. AMONG THESE STAFF ARE THOSE WITHIN THE ED CONNECTIONS PROGRAM, WHO CONNECT INDIVIDUALS PRESENTING IN THE EMERGENCY DEPARTMENT WITH PROGRAMS FOR WHICH THEY MAY BE ELIGIBLE. WITHIN LANCASTER COUNTY AND BEYOND, BRYAN HEALTH OFFERS ONLINE, MOBILE, AND ON-SITE SCREENINGS TO IDENTIFY INDIVIDUALS WITH HIGH-RISK FOR CERTAIN CONDITIONS AND TO ENSURE THEY GET TIMELY ACCESS TO PREVENTATIVE CARE. A NEW SCREENING THAT IS QUICKLY BEING EMBRACED IS FOR FAMILY MEMBERS OF PATIENTS WITH BICUSPID AORTIC VALVE (BAV). BAV IS ONE OF THE MOST COMMON CONGENITAL HEART DISORDERS AND ABOUT 10 PERCENT OF BAV CASES ARE ATTRIBUTED TO HEREDITARY CAUSES. BRYAN HEALTH ALSO PARTNERS WITH MANY CITY OF LINCOLN DEPARTMENTS AS WELL AS PRIVATE BUSINESSES TO PROVIDE MOBILE SCREENINGS, EDUCATION AND HEALTH FAIRS. ONE OF THE MAJOR ACTIONS THAT BRYAN HEALTH HAS TAKEN TO INCREASE ACCESS IS THE DECISION SEVERAL YEARS AGO TO PROVIDE AN ADDITIONAL SUBSIDY FOR HEALTH INSURANCE PREMIUMS FOR BRYAN MEDICAL CENTER EMPLOYEES UNDER A CERTAIN WAGE LEVEL. THIS PROGRAM WAS CREATED BECAUSE A LARGE GROUP OF LOWER WAGE EMPLOYEES ELECTED NOT TO ENROLL IN BRYAN'S INSURANCE PLAN, AND ELECTED TO REMAIN UNINSURED DUE TO PREMIUM COSTS. THE ADDITIONAL SUBSIDY HAS PROVIDED ACCESS TO INSURANCE FOR MORE THAN 375 EMPLOYEES AND THEIR DEPENDENTS ON AN ANNUAL BASIS. WE BELIEVE THIS IS A SMALL STEP TOWARD ASSISTING UNINSURED INDIVIDUALS IN OUR COMMUNITY AS INSURED INDIVIDUALS GENERALLY HAVE BETTER ACCESS TO SERVICES. THERE ARE MANY REASONS BEHIND LACK OF ACCESS TO HEALTH CARE SERVICES; THE SHORTAGE OF HEALTH CARE PROFESSIONALS IS JUST ONE OF THESE REASONS. BRYAN HEALTH IS A HUGE SUPPORTER OF EDUCATION FOR HEALTH CARE PROFESSIONALS - INCLUDING ONGOING FINANCIAL SUPPORT FOR: 1) THE BRYAN COLLEGE OF HEALTH SCIENCES, WITH MORE THAN 650 STUDENTS ENROLLED IN GRADUATE AND UNDERGRADUATE DEGREE PROGRAMS THROUGH BRYAN'S SCHOOL OF NURSING, HEALTH PROFESSION AND NURSE ANESTHESIA PROGRAMS, AND 2) THE LINCOLN MEDICAL EDUCATION PARTNERSHIP RESIDENCY PROGRAM FOR FUTURE PRIMARY CARE PROVIDERS. IN ADDITION, BRYAN ALSO SERVES AS A CLINICAL TRAINING SITE FOR A LONG LIST OF HEALTH CARE DISCIPLINES; INCLUDING RADIOLOGY, LAB, PHYSICAL THERAPY, PHARMACY, EMTS AND PARAMEDICS, ETC. THIS COMMITMENT TO EDUCATION OF THE NEXT GENERATION OF HEALTH CARE PROFESSIONALS ULTIMATELY IMPROVES ACCESS TO HEALTHCARE IN OUR REGION. MADONNA IS THE DESIGNATED ORGANIZATION IN THE LINCOLN COMMUNITY THAT PROVIDES HANDICAP-ACCESSIBLE BUS TRANSPORTATION FOR COMMUNITY MEMBERS TO/FROM DOCTORS' APPOINTMENTS, THERAPY AND OTHER OUTPATIENT APPOINTMENTS. BRYAN PROVIDES AN ANNUAL CONTRIBUTION OF MORE THAN $20,000 FOR THESE SERVICES SO THAT FINANCIALLY CHALLENGED MEMBERS OF OUR COMMUNITY WILL HAVE ACCESS TO MEDICAL CARE. MANY PRIVATE PRACTICE PHYSICIANS IN LINCOLN HAVE ELECTED NOT TO SERVE MEDICAID AND/OR MEDICARE PATIENTS IN THEIR OUTPATIENT CLINICS FOR FINANCIAL REASONS. BRYAN PHYSICIAN NETWORK PHYSICIANS ACCEPT MEDICAID/MEDICARE PATIENTS INTO THEIR PRACTICE BY POLICY; THEREFORE, AS BRYAN PHYSICIAN NETWORK CONTINUES TO EXPAND WITHIN THE COMMUNITY, SO DOES ACCESS TO PHYSICIAN CARE FOR AREA MEDICAID/MEDICARE PATIENTS. BRYAN HEALTH'S CEO HAS SERVED AS THE CHAIRMAN OF THE COMMUNITY HEALTH ENDOWMENT (CHE) BOARD FOR THE PAST TWO YEARS. THE CHE IS THE DESIGNATED ORGANIZATION IN LINCOLN TO COORDINATE A WIDE VARIETY OF COMMUNITY HEALTH EFFORTS TO FURTHER THE HEALTH AND SAFETY OF THE COMMUNITY. CHE'S MISSION IS FOR LINCOLN TO BE THE HEALTHIEST CITY IN THE NATION. THIS IS ANOTHER GREAT EXAMPLE OF BRYAN'S SUPPORT FOR COMMUNITY HEALTH RELATED EFFORTS."

ACCESS TO CARE: Beth Israel Medical Center established a large network of ambulatory and primary care sites to enable greater patient access throughout the communities it serves. When St. Vincent's Catholic Medical Center closed Beth Israel took over operations of three key locations that had belonged to St. Vincent's, including their Cancer Center. Additionally, Beth Israel opened an expanded facility offering primary and specialty care services on 23rd street and Eighth Avenue, and operates a large Primary and Specialty Care facility adjacent to Union Square Park. Beth Israel Brooklyn maintains a primary and specialty care pavilion adjacent to the main hospital campus. Additionally, it has engaged a large network of attending physicians to meet the needs of the community residents. SERVICES TO THE ELDERLY: Beth Israel Senior Health and Senior Health House Calls is a program tailored to the needs of older adults. The program provides access to geriatrics physicians, nurse practitioners and social workers so that adults age 65 and over can enjoy better health, better quality of life, and possibly greater independence. High-quality medical and social services are also available to homebound older adults through house calls. The Karpas Health Information Center also works with numerous programs in the community to assist in monitoring the health conditions of seniors. Beth Israel Brooklyn employs a Social Worker whose function is dedicated to senior community outreach. HIV/AIDS: The AIDS Center at Beth Israel Medical Center in New York City is a leader in AIDS. Accredited by the New York State AIDS Institute as a Designated AIDS Center (DAC), it has the experience and expertise to provide comprehensive services to meet each patient's special health care needs. The world-renowned Peter Krueger Clinic offers outpatient HIV care: primary medical, gynecological, oral health care, mental health services, social work and COBRA case management, treatment education and adherence counseling, harm-reduction programs and nutritional support. If a patient requires hospitalization, Beth Israel Medical Center's inpatient unit is staffed with infectious disease specialists."

FOCUSED PRIORITIES ARE PART OF IN-SCOPE COMMUNITY HEALTH NEEDS, WHICH SAINT LUKE'S HOSPITAL OF KANSAS CITY IS TAKING OR PLANS TO TAKE AN ACTIVE LEADERSHIP ROLE IN ADDRESSING OVER THE NEXT THREE YEARS.1. HEALTH CARE ACCESS. SAINT LUKE'S HEALTH SYSTEM WILL CONTINUE TO ADVOCATE ON KEY HEALTH POLICY ISSUES AT THE STATE AND NATIONAL LEVEL, INCLUDING MEDICAID REFORM, ACCESS TO CARE, AND HEALTH CARE FINANCING FOR THE LOW-INCOME POPULATION. SLH WILL CONTINUE TO OFFER THE MEDICATION ASSISTANCE PROGRAM. SLH WILL CONTINUE TO HOST CLINIC-BASED AND COMMUNITY BASED WELLNESS EDUCATION FOR PATIENTS AND SLH'S COMMUNITY AT LARGE.2. CARDIOVASCULAR DISEASE AND DIABETES. SLH WILL CONTINUE TO PREVENT, TREAT, AND MANAGE CARDIOVASCULAR DISEASE AND DIABETES WITH BOTH HOSPITAL-BASED AND COMMUNITY-BASED PROGRAMS OPERATED BY SAINT LUKE'S MID-AMERICA HEART INSTITUTE AND SAINT LUKE'S MARION BLOCH NEUROSCIENCE INSTITUTE.3. MATERNAL AND NEWBORN HEALTH NEED. SLH WILL CONTINUE TO HOST THE RESOURCES ADDRESSING MATERNAL AND NEWBORN HEALTH NEEDS BY BEING THE ONLY MILK BANK IN THE KANSAS CITY AREA, SPONSOR OF MOTHER AND CHILD HEALTH COALITION AND CONTINUE CURRENT WOMEN'S AND CHILDREN'S SERVICES.4.

AS A TEACHING HOSPITAL, SLH WILL CONTINUE TO COMMIT THE RESOURCES IN AN EFFORT TO REDUCE THE PRIMARY CARE PHYSICIAN SHORTAGE INCLUDING PRE-MEDICINE TRAINING, M.D. PROGRAM, RESIDENCY AND FELLOWSHIP, NURSING SUPPORT, PHYSICIAN ASSISTANT (PA) TRAINING.9.

THESE NEEDS WERE DEEMED OUT-OF-SCOPE, MEANING THAT THEY FALL OUTSIDE SLH'S AND SLH AFFILIATES' AND ITS COMMUNITY COLLABORATIONS' SERVICE SCOPES.OUT-OF-SCOPE NEEDS:1. INPATIENT MENTAL AND BEHAVIORAL HEALTH NEEDSAINT LUKE'S HOSPITAL OF KANSAS CITY DOES NOT HAVE ITS OWN INPATIENT PSYCHIATRIC UNITS AND THEREFORE ONLY OFFERS OUTPATIENT MENTAL AND BEHAVIORAL HEALTH SERVICES WHILE REFERRING INPATIENT PSYCHIATRIC SERVICES TO OTHER HOSPITALS IN AND OUTSIDE SAINT LUKE'S HEALTH SYSTEM (SLHS).2. GENERAL CHILDREN'S HEALTH NEEDIN SLH'S COMMUNITY, CHILDREN'S MERCY HOSPITALS AND CLINICS (KANSAS CITY) HAS FAR MORE COMPREHENSIVE PEDIATRIC SERVICES THAN ANY OTHER LOCAL HEALTH CARE PROVIDERS (THE LARGEST PEDIATRIC SERVICE MARKET SHARE). SLH IS ONLY EQUIPPED TO ADDRESS MATERNAL AND NEWBORN HEALTH NEED AND SOME OUTPATIENT PEDIATRIC CARE NICHE AREAS. MOST PEDIATRIC PATIENTS (OUTPATIENT AND INPATIENT) ARE THEREFORE REFERRED TO CHILDREN'S MERCY HOSPITALS AND CLINICS. FURTHERMORE, LOCAL PUBLIC SCHOOL DISTRICTS HAVE CONTROL OVER IN-SCHOOL MEDICAL STAFF, FACILITIES, AND SUPPLIES. SLH CAN ONLY SERVE IN SUPPORTING ROLES.3. STREET VIOLENCEAS A HOSPITAL, SLH IS ONLY EQUIPPED TO ADDRESS VIOLENCE ISSUES WHILE VICTIMS ARE STILL IN THE CLINICAL SETTINGS (E.G., PATIENTS SUFFERING FROM DOMESTIC VIOLENCE). GOVERNMENT LAW ENFORCEMENT AGENCIES AND COMMUNITY-LED PROGRAMS CAN MORE EFFECTIVELY MANAGE AND PREVENT STREET VIOLENCE THROUGHOUT THE COMMUNITY."

The CHNA process began in September 2010 and concluded May 2013. The Board of Directors that govern Saint Vincent Health Center approved an implementation strategy designed to address the community health needs identified in the CHNA on September 27, 2013. The implementation strategies were developed in collaboration with the Erie County Health Department, Saint Vincent physicians and local employers. Improving access to mental health services for seniors is the top priority area for the hospital, through the hospital's Geropsychiatric program. The hospital will increase community outreach through a Geriatric Nurse Liaison to educate physician offices, senior service providers and other community groups regarding risk assessment and appropriate protocols for geriatric psychiatric admissions. The hospital will work with GECAC and other community agencies to identify additional strategies to improve access to services for adults with mental health challenges. Saint Vincent will offer access to Alcoholic Anonymous programs at its facilities. There is one priority identified by the Erie County Community Health Needs Assessment that Saint Vincent is not addressing. This is the area of Financial Distress. While the hospital offers numerous health and wellness programs at no charge to the public and offers psychiatric services for adults and seniors that might include stress-related issues, addressing the financial needs of Erie County residents and elimination of poverty of Erie County residents is outside of the scope of the mission of the hospital. Schedule H, Part V, Line 13h Saint Vincent Health Center is part of the integrated delivery system named Allegheny Health Network. In 2014, Saint Vincent Health Center adopted the Allegheny Health Network Financial Assistance Policy. During 2014, Allegheny Health Network enhanced its Financial Assistance Policy with a Presumptive eligibility program that enables AHN to make an informed decision on the financial need of patients utilizing the best estimates available in the absence of information provided directly by the patient. The Health system utilizes a healthcare industry-recognized model that is based on public record databases. This predictive model incorporates public record data to calculate a socio-economic and financial capacity score that includes estimates for income, assets and liquidity. The electronic technology is designed to assess each patient to the same standards and is calibrated against historical approvals for AHN financial assistance under the traditional application process. The electronic technology is deployed prior to bad debt assignment after all other eligibility and payment sources have been exhausted. This allows AHN to screen all patients for financial assistance prior to pursuing any extraordinary collection actions. The data returned from this electronic eligibility review will constitute adequate documentation of financial need under our policy. When electronic enrollment is used as the basis for presumptive eligibility, the highest discount of full free care is granted for eligible services for retrospective dates of service only.

Those segments include: -Public Transportation: Public transportation services are not provided by the community and Houston Methodist Hospital cannot currently address transportation services in the implementation strategy as this is regarded as patient inducement. -Dental Care: Dental care is not currently addressed in the implementation strategy. Houston Methodist Hospital will focus on primary and preventative care in the implementation plan as well as behavioral health. Dental care is not an issue that Houston Methodist Hospital has the resources to undertake directly but addresses them through external partnerships. -Drug Use, Sexual Behavior Risks and Accidents: Alcohol and other drug use; sexual behaviors that may result in HIV infection, other sexually transmitted diseases, and unintended pregnancy; and behaviors that contribute to unintentional injury and violence are health risk behaviors that are not currently addressed at Houston Methodist Hospital at a program level but are supported through sponsorship in several community organizations that address these health risk behaviors."

201503209349313530,362167800,"PART V, SECTION B, LINE 4","In Presence Health's 2012 Schedule H (Form 990), it was indicated that the CHNA was completed in 2012. Although the quantitative and qualitative data was collected and compiled in 2012, the CHNA report was not made publicly available until the beginning of 2013. The CHNA completion date has been updated on this form to 2013 to be consistent with when the IRS deems the CHNA to be conducted (the date on which the CHNA report is published and made ""widely available."") PART V, SECTION B, LINE 5 A community health needs assessment (CHNA) is a collaborative community process of identifying and prioritizing a community's health needs, accomplished through the collection and analysis of data, including input from community stakeholders. In July 2012, a CHNA Steering Committee was formed to represent stakeholders within the PSFH community, as well as to provide oversight and input throughout the CHNA process. The committee's role is also to assist in the identification of data-driven community priorities and to engage stakeholders in community solutions through partnerships and collaboration. By taking on a community approach to both the assessment and implementation strategies, the goal is to ensure the data, processes, and outputs add value to all community partners, not just the hospital. Engagement of Public Health Expertise Presence Health formally engaged the Illinois Public Health Institute (IPHI) for assistance in planning and executing the CHNA process. IPHI served as an expert public health consultant throughout the CHNA timeline. Further, IPHI provided invaluable assistance in obtaining partnerships with the local and county Health Departments. Given the vast number of county hospitals served by the same Health Department in Cook County, resource allocation was difficult to obtain. As such, IPHI functioned as a liaison role between Presence Health and the Health Departments so as to obtain engagement through public data sharing and linkages with implementation plans. Conversations were facilitated between the Cook County Department of Public Health so as to continually inform all parties of CHNA process inputs and obtain both feedback and support. CHNA Steering Committee To provide community level oversight for the process, a diverse group of community stakeholders and Presence Saint Francis Hospital representatives from its service area (Evanston, Rogers Park, and West Ridge) were invited to participate on the CHNA Steering Committee. To ensure representative engagement, personal invitations were sent to organizations representing cultural, linguistic, racial, ethnic, and other minority groups. In addition, individuals with specialized qualifications in dealing with special populations or clinical groups were solicited for their participation. Finally, efforts were made to include individuals on the CHNA Steering Committee with public health expertise. Those who committed to the assessment and planning process became the 23 members of the CHNA Steering Committee, which continues to meet regularly to provide feedback and oversight, assess progress, and modify plans as needed. The agencies represented on the CHNA Steering Committee are listed below: - Oakton School PTA - Cook County Commissioner Larry Suffredin's Office - Presence Saint Francis Hospital - St. Hillary Catholic Church - Holmestead Communications - Former Evanston Police Chief - PEER Services, Inc. - Trilogy - Former Evanston Mayor - Consortium to Lower Obesity in Chicago Children (CLOCC) - McGaw YMCA - Rogers Park Business Alliance - CJE SeniorLife - Howard Area Community Center - ACCESS Community Health Network - Evanston Health Department - Saint Nicholas - Evanston/Skokie School District 65 Community Health Profile The Community Health Profile is a compilation of secondary data (data already published and available) about a particular community. The profile provides comparative information to assist in understanding the needs and priorities of a community. The Community Health Profile for PSFH analyzed over 50 indicators. Example indicators include: population trends, race, income, poverty levels, and percentage of uninsured, health professional shortages, leading causes of death, teen births, birth weights, tobacco use, physical activity, crime rates, and food insecurity. The Community Health Profile can be found online at www.presencehealth.org/community. Community Input Report The community input process was completed between August and October 2012. The process included creating and administering a community input survey in Spanish, Polish and Russian as well as English, facilitating three focus groups, and completing an asset and resources inventory. The community survey explored residents' perceptions of issues surrounding quality of life, health, and social factors and collected respondents' demographics including insurance coverage. Nine hundred twenty-one (921) community residents completed the survey. The Community Input Report can be found online at www.presencehealth.org/community. In conjunction with the CHNA Steering Committee and numerous community stakeholders, an inventory of community assets was then conducted so as to determine existing health resources that could be built upon or collaborated with to conduct the work of PSFH's ministry. The Community Asset Matrix can be found in Appendix 1 of the Community Input Report online at www.presencehealth.org/community. PART V, SECTION B, LINE 7D Print copies are available upon request. In addition, copies were mailed to community partners who collected community input and participated in the CHNA process for more specific dissemination of findings. Partners were also provided links to the website via email for dissemination to their mailing lists and respective constituents. Part V, SECTION B, LINE 11 THE CHNA PROCESS WAS INITIATED BY PRESENCE SAINT FRANCIS HOSPITAL (PSFH) IN COLLABORATION WITH THE COMMUNITY IT SERVES. THE COMMUNITY SERVED FOR PURPOSES OF THE CHNA IS MADE UP OF PSFH'S PRIMARY SERVICE AREA INCLUDING ROGERS PARK, WEST RIDGE AND EVANSTON. THE PRESENCE HEALTH COMMUNITY HEALTH STRATEGY DEPARTMENT FACILITATED THE OVERALL PROCESS IN CONJUNCTION WITH PSFH LEADERSHIP. PRESENCE HEALTH FORMALLY ENGAGED WITH THE ILLINOIS PUBLIC HEALTH INSTITUTE (IPHI) FOR ASSISTANCE IN PLANNING AND EXECUTING THE CHNA PROCESS. IPHI SERVED AS AN EXPERT PUBLIC HEALTH CONSULTANT THROUGHOUT THE CHNA TIMELINE. FURTHER, IPHI PROVIDED INVALUABLE ASSISTANCE IN OBTAINING PARTNERSHIPS WITH THE LOCAL AND COUNTY HEALTH DEPARTMENTS. GIVEN THE VAST NUMBER OF COUNTY HOSPITALS SERVED BY THE SAME HEALTH DEPARTMENT IN THE CITY OF CHICAGO, RESOURCE ALLOCATION WAS DIFFICULT TO OBTAIN. AS SUCH, IPHI FUNCTIONED AS A LIAISON ROLE BETWEEN PRESENCE HEALTH AND THE CHICAGO DEPARTMENT OF PUBLIC HEALTH SO AS TO OBTAIN ENGAGEMENT THROUGH PUBLIC DATA SHARING AND LINKAGES WITH IMPLEMENTATION PLANS. CONVERSATIONS WERE FACILITATED BETWEEN THE CHICAGO AND COOK COUNTY DEPARTMENTS OF PUBLIC HEALTH SO AS TO CONTINUALLY INFORM ALL PARTIES OF CHNA PROCESS INPUTS AND OBTAIN BOTH FEEDBACK AND SUPPORT. THE EVANSTON HEALTH DEPARTMENT WAS FORMALLY ENGAGED IN THE CHNA PROCESS, AND A REPRESENTATIVE MEMBER ACTIVELY PARTICIPATED THROUGH MEMBERSHIP ON THE STEERING COMMITTEE. DATA AND RESOURCES WERE SHARED BETWEEN PRESENCE HEALTH AND THE EVANSTON HEALTH DEPARTMENT. PSFH COORDINATED A BROAD ARRAY OF COMMUNITY STAKEHOLDERS FROM THE COMMUNITY TO FORM A CHNA STEERING COMMITTEE. THIS COMMITTEE'S ROLE WAS TO PROVIDE OVERSIGHT AND INPUT INTO THE PROCESS, AS WELL AS TO IDENTIFY DATA-DRIVEN COMMUNITY PRIORITIES SO AS TO ENGAGE IN COMMUNITY SOLUTIONS THROUGH PARTNERSHIPS AND COLLABORATIONS. THE CHNA STEERING COMMITTEE FOLLOWED A NINE-STEP PROCESS THAT INVOLVED THE FOLLOWING: IDENTIFY THE COMMUNITY AND ITS GEOGRAPHIC BOUNDARIES; FORMED A STEERING COMMITTEE; ADOPTED A MISSION, VISION AND VALUES; ANALYZED SECONDARY DATA; GATHERED COMMUNITY INPUT; IDENTIFIED KEY ISSUES; AND DEVELOPED HIGH-LEVEL ACTION PLANS AND COMMUNICATING RESULTS WITH THE COMMUNITY. PSFH THEN WORKED WITH THE CHNA STEERING COMMITTEE TO IDENTIFY THE PRIORITY ISSUES THAT WERE DEEMED MOST SIGNIFICANT IN THE COMMUNITY. THE COMMITTEE GENERATED A LIST OF THEIR IDENTIFIED CROSS-CUTTING THEMES AND COMMUNITY ISSUES. THE FOLLOWING THEMES SURFACED AND WERE PRIORITIZED BY THE CHNA STEERING COMMITTEE AS THE SIGNIFICANT HEALTH NEEDS OF THE COMMUNITY: "" ADOLESCENT HEALTH "" MENTAL HEALTH "" OBESITY AND CHRONIC DISEASE "" SAFETY AND VIOLENCE THE CHNA STEERING COMMITTEE ALSO DETERMINED THAT ADDRESSING ECONOMIC DISPARITIES, HEALTH LITERACY, AFFORDABILITY, AND LANGUAGE BARRIERS SHOULD BE ADDRESSED THROUGHOUT ALL PRIORITIES AND STRATEGIES SO AS TO ENSURE A FOCUS ON THE MOST VULNERABLE AND UNDERSERVED POPULATIONS.

The Hospital addressed the following health needs: diabetes, heart disease and breast cancer. The CHNA identified the following health needs the Hospital chose not to address: flu and pneumonia, bronchus and lung cancer and health literacy because existing hospital and/or community resources work to address these needs. AKMC evaluated all top priority needs and put forth plans to address the needs we felt we were best positioned to make a positive impact for the betterment of the health of the communities we serve. AKMC is addressing the identified significant needs by community education, outreach and health screenings, physician outreach and training and programs for patients. AKMC has made the CHNA widely available to the public. The community health needs assessment can be viewed at : www.ahn.org. Schedule H, Part V, Section B, Line 13H AKMC is part of the integrated delivery system named Allegheny Health Network. In 2014, AKMC adopted the Allegheny Health Network Financial Assistance Policy. During 2014, Allegheny Health Network enhanced its Financial Assistance Policy with a Presumptive eligibility program that enables AHN to make an informed decision on the financial need of patients utilizing the best estimates available in the absence of information provided directly by the patient. The Health system utilizes a healthcare industry-recognized model that is based on public record databases. This predictive model incorporates public record data to calculate a socio-economic and financial capacity score that includes estimates for income, assets and liquidity. The electronic technology is designed to assess each patient to the same standards and is calibrated against historical approvals for AHN financial assistance under the traditional application process. The electronic technology is deployed prior to bad debt assignment after all other eligibility and payment sources have been exhausted. This allows AHN to screen all patients for financial assistance prior to pursuing any extraordinary collection actions. The data returned from this electronic eligibility review will constitute adequate documentation of financial need under our policy. When electronic enrollment is used as the basis for presumptive eligibility, the highest discount of full free care is granted for eligible services for retrospective dates of service only."

To this end, all groups were consulted in its development phase. Thirteen members of the community, including Public and Patient Education Department and Department of Social Work Programs participants and members of the Carter Burden and Mott Street Senior Centers, provided feedback on survey construction and length in late January and early February 2013, mainly through one-on-one interviews. In addition, the Hospital was careful to elicit public input about survey translations to ensure that they were culturally relevant; health literacy considerations were also taken into account. Internal stakeholders and community partners provided valuable feedback about survey construction, the use of validated measures, cultural relevance, health literacy and survey gaps via extensive phone conversations, emails and in- person discussions. All feedback was aggregated and used to adjust survey questions, construction and cultural relevance. Below outlines the community partners involved in survey construction: - Arthritis Foundation - New York Chapter - Sharon Jaycox-Daitz, MS, Regional Vice President, Northeast Programs; Kate Anastasia, MPA, Regional Director of Programs - Charles B.

Relevant national, state and city health data and needs assessment results were also utilized to drive community programming. - Input from Internal Stakeholders: Internal meetings were held with various parties within the Hospital (HSS Departments of Public and Patient Education, Social Work Programs, Nursing, Nutrition, and Rehabilitation) to discuss identified health priorities and explore areas for implementing initiatives, using results from the CHNA and stakeholders' awareness of community needs to guide the discussion. The group discussed focusing on increasing access to high quality, culturally relevant chronic disease preventive care and management of musculoskeletal and rheumatologic conditions and reducing obesity in adults and children, which aligns with the New York State Department of Health's Community Service Plan priority areas. - Input from the General Public: A public forum was held in May 2013 to allow members of the community an opportunity to discuss how the Hospital could prioritize community health needs. The public expressed the need for programs that improve diet and physical activity and empower the community to prevent and manage their musculoskeletal and rheumatologic conditions. Furthermore, community members agreed that HSS should focus on developing strong programs and services aimed at reducing obesity and increasing access to high quality chronic disease preventive care and management in clinical and community settings. - Community Partner Feedback: Feedback from community partner organizations was critical to driving the selection of public health priorities for the Hospital. Using results of the CHNA as the basis for discussion, HSS and its partners exchanged valuable information regarding community needs, explored areas for future collaboration, and solidified a mutual commitment to advancing public health. Furthermore, community partner knowledge of their respective community helped to identify gaps in community programming - or more specifically, areas where HSS could use its areas of expertise to make a lasting public health impact. Overall, feedback from these meetings solidified the direction for programs that improve the community's diet and increase physical activity to combat obesity among children and adults, examine specific communities in need of chronic disease preventive care and management (including older adults, diverse communities and lower-income groups), and provide culturally-relevant education regarding musculoskeletal and rheumatologic issues. Additionally, the Hospital met with the Greater New York Hospital Association (GNYHA), a trade association consisting of not-for-profit hospitals, and regulatory agencies to inform the structure and process for selecting its public health priorities. The Hospital also attended executive briefings regarding plans and updates to the NYC DOHMH Take Care New York health policy on February 20th and July 19th, 2013, meetings which were facilitated by GNYHA, to ensure the Hospital's priority/focus areas are aligned with state and local health department goals."

(A-2)Implementation Strategy 2: Employee flu initiative HSS offers flu vaccinations for all personnel through its occupational health services (OHS). Staff that decline the flu vaccination must wear a facemask in all patient areas during the period of time the influenza is determined to be prevalent. HSS staff vaccinated outside the Hospital are required to provide appropriate documentation. (B)Identified Need 2: Chronic Disease Self-Management Education (B-1)Implementation Strategy 1: HSS Nursing Community Education Outreach Initiative. This initiative was launched in August 2012 to address the health education needs of elderly NYC residents. The aim of the initiative is to develop self-care knowledge and provide self-management support strategies on issues germane to seniors. Educational topics are selected based upon needs assessment results and participant feedback, including falls prevention, nutrition and medication safety. (B-2) Implementation Strategy 2: Osteoarthritis Wellness Initiative (OAWI). To address the public health issue of OA, HSS developed OAWI, comprised of educational and exercise programs, to raise awareness, educate and reduce the impact of OA on the public. The initiative is comprised of lectures, workshops, and seminars regarding OA-specific topics of interest, including pain management techniques and maintaining a healthy lifestyle, while exercise programs include weekly classes on yoga, Pilates, Tai Chi, dance, and yogalates. (B-3)Implementation Strategy 3: Rheumatoid Arthritis Two programs are offered by the Hospital to address the pressing needs of community members and their families living with RA. Living with RA was developed for people with long standing severe RA. The Early RA Support and Education Program focuses on early intervention for people with newly diagnosed RA. The programs are co-facilitated by a social work manager and nurse manager. Both programs provide essential RA-related education by expert health care providers, and peer support in a group setting. In addition, individual RA-related psycho-educational counseling is available. (B-4)Implementation Strategy 4: Osteoporosis Wellness Initiative (OWI) The programs that comprise OWI were originally introduced in 1997 as part of the Osteoporosis Education Bill, which provided osteoporosis-related education and designated HSS as a New York State Osteoporosis Prevention and Education Program (NYSOPEP) Regional Center under Former Governor George Pataki from 1997-2011. When funding ended in 2011, HSS launched OWI to continue to provide members of the community with education about the causes, importance of prevention and early detection, and options for treatment of osteoporosis. The initiative is comprised of seminars, monthly forums, and exercise classes regarding self-management techniques to decrease pain, improve balance, and decrease falls. Exercise programs include weekly classes on yoga, Pilates, Tai Chi, dance, and yogalates. (B-5)Implementation Strategy 5: LANtern Lupus Asian Network Since its inception in 2003, LANtern has been a national model for support and education of Asian Americans with lupus and their families. Through the program's Support Line, community programs, participation in conferences, and publications, the program seeks to meet a gap to enhance awareness, understanding, coping and knowledge regarding lupus for this community. (B-6)Implementation Strategy 6: Charla de Lupus/Lupus Chat The ""Charla"" program was developed in 1994 to address health disparities among Black and Hispanic women with lupus. This social work-led program engages and trains peer volunteers to become empowering role models, provide culturally relevant strategies to help increase understanding of this complex illness and its treatment, improve medical adherence, and enhance coping and healthy behaviors. Comprehensive bilingual (English/Spanish) services include: the Charla Line, a toll-free national support and education helpline; weekly Onsite Peer Support Outreach at four hospital-based clinics, monthly Charla Teen and Parent Lupus Chat Groups; numerous community, professional education and government collaborations. (C)Identified Need 3: Increased Access to Health Care for Asian New Yorkers (C-1)Implementation Strategy: HSS Asian Community Bone Health Initiative. Launched in 2012 in response to the health needs of the growing number of Asian older adults living in NYC's Chinatown community, the overall goal of this initiative is to help Asian seniors better manage chronic musculoskeletal disorders while also increasing access to care in this medically underserved community. It is comprised of culturally-relevant musculoskeletal health lectures/workshops, self-management education, yoga and low impact chair exercise programs. Education around provider-patient communication and falls prevention will also be incorporated into health lectures/workshops. (D)Identified Need 4: Nutrition & Physical Activity Programming (D-1)Implementation Strategy 1: SNEAKER Super Nutrition Education for All Kids to Eat Right. This nutrition and physical activity education program, launched in 2003, provides children and families with essential knowledge about healthy eating and physical activity. The program utilizes interactive lessons to teach students the importance of eating a healthy, well-balanced diet and being physically active, encourage children to make healthier food decisions and educate students about how to make healthier food choices and be more physically active. SNEAKER also contains a parent/caregiver component wherein weekly newsletters are sent home to educate the parent/caregiver about the lessons their child learned in school so they can help foster healthy changes for the child and the entire family. The Program is implemented in public schools and after-school programs largely located in medically underserved areas throughout NYC. Residents in these areas are predominantly Hispanic/Latino, Black and Asian. (D-2)Implementation Strategy 2: Wellness Exercise Classes To increase physical activity among adults, HSS provides exercise programs through its Osteoarthritis and Osteoporosis Wellness Initiatives, which are aimed at educating and reducing the impact of osteoarthritis and osteoporosis on the public. Exercise programs include weekly classes on yoga, pilates, Tai Chi, dance, and yogalates, and are led by certified fitness instructors. (E)Identified Need 5: Improved Provider-Patient Communication/Health Literacy (E-1)Implementation Strategy 1: Resident Geriatric Training Program This program was launched in 2009 to improve communication skills of third-year orthopedic surgery residents with older patients. The program includes meetings with the Program Coordinator, a licensed social worker, for the residents to explore their attitudes toward older patients, weekly resident rounds for selected residents to present and illustrate specific geriatric needs, and presentations to participants of the HSS Greenberg Academy for Successful Aging. (E-2)Implementation Strategy 2: VOICES 60+ Senior Advocacy Program This program was launched in 2006 in recognition of the multiple challenges older adults face in effectively utilizing high quality chronic disease care to optimize health outcomes, and access needed social supports, particularly for those who are from low-income and Spanish speaking communities. VOICES 60+ will improve patient-provider communication through interventions that target both culturally diverse community-dwelling older adults, and their professional service providers. These strategies, facilitated in English and Spanish, will take into account low literacy and verbal response needs of participants, in a culturally sensitive manner. GIVEN THE HOSPITAL'S FOCUS ON MUSCULOSKELETAL AND RHEUMATOLOGIC CONDITIONS, CHNA RESULTS SUGGESTING THE NEED FOR INCREASING PREVENTIVE CARE SUCH AS MAMMOGRAMS OR PAP SMEARS EXTENDS BEYOND THE SCOPE OF THE HOSPITAL. NEVERTHELESS, HSS IS COMMITTED TO PROVIDING COMMUNITY HEALTH EDUCATION TO VARIOUS AUDIENCES ON TOPICS THAT RELATE TO GENERAL PUBLIC HEALTH ISSUES THROUGH EFFORTS SUCH AS THE HSS NURSING COMMUNITY EDUCATION OUTREACH INITIATIVE, TO ADDRESS THE HEALTH EDUCATION NEEDS OF OLDER ADULT NYC RESIDENTS. MOREOVER, THE HOSPITAL PLANS TO CONTINUE DEVELOPING WELLNESS EDUCATION AND EXERCISE PROGRAMS TO PROVIDE THE HIGHEST QUALITY PATIENT CARE, IMPROVE MOBILITY, AND ENHANCE THE QUALITY OF LIFE FOR ALL."

DURING THE CHNA PROCESS, THE HOSPITAL FACILITIES UNDERWENT A PRIORITIZATION PROCESS TO IDENTIFY THE SIGNIFICANT HEALTH NEEDS FOR WHICH IMPLEMENTATION STRATEGIES SHOULD BE DEVELOPED. THE PROCESS CONSIDERED FACTORS SUCH AS SIZE AND SCOPE OF THE HEALTH PROBLEM, THE INTENSITY AND SEVERITY OF THE ISSUE, THE POTENTIAL TO EFFECTIVELY ADDRESS THE PROBLEM AND THE AVAILABILITY OF COMMUNITY RESOURCES, AND SENTARA'S MISSION ""TO IMPROVE HEALTH EVERYDAY"". FOR THE SIGNIFICANT HEALTH NEEDS, IN ADDITION TO EXECUTIVE OF THE IMPLEMENTATION STRATEGIES, THE FACILITIES ARE PARTICIPATING IN CITY LEVEL COLLABORATIVE EFFORTS SUCH AS THE NORFOLK HEALTHCARE COALITION AND HEALTHYVB (VIRGINIA BEACH). SOME OF THE AREA NEEDS WHICH ARE NOT SPECIFICALLY ADDRESSED IN THE IMPLEMENTATION STRATEGIES WERE IDENTIFIED AS LOWER PRIORITY BECAUSE THEY DID NOT RANK HIGH WITH THE PRIORITIZATION FACTORS.

VIOLENCE VIOLENCE IS A SIGNIFICANT PROBLEM IN MANY NEIGHBORHOODS IN CHRIST MEDICAL CENTER'S TOTAL SERVICE AREA. THE COMMUNITIES WITH THE HIGHEST RATES OF VIOLENCE ARE ROSELAND, ENGLEWOOD, CHICAGO LAWN/WEST LAWN, GRAND BOULEVARD AND WOODLAWN. GIVEN THAT CHRIST MEDICAL CENTER IS THE ONLY LEVEL 1 TRAUMA CENTER SERVING THESE COMMUNITIES, THE MEDICAL CENTER PROVIDES TRAUMA SERVICES TO A HIGH VOLUME OF GUNSHOT VICTIMS. TO ADDRESS GUN VIOLENCE IN CHRIST MEDICAL CENTER'S SERVICE AREA, THE MEDICAL CENTER HAS PARTNERED WITH CEASEFIRE WITH THE GOAL OF REDUCING VIOLENCE IN THESE FIVE COMMUNITIES. CEASEFIRE IS A LOCAL BRANCH OF THE CURE VIOLENCE ORGANIZATION WHOSE MISSION IS TO STOP TRANSMISSION OF VIOLENCE AT THE SOURCE, WHILE ATLERING NORMS AND BEHAVIOR SO THAT FEWER PEOPLE ARE AFFECTED. HIGHLY TRAINED VIOLENCE INTERRRUPTERS -FORMER PERPETRATORS - AIM TO DISPRUPT CONFLICTS BEFORE THEY HAPPEN AND EDUCATE THE COMMUNITY ABOUT THE CONSEQUENCES OF VIOLENT BEHAVIOR. THE CEASEFIRE COLLABORATION'S OBJECTIVE IS TO REDUCE RETALIATORY VIOLENCE IN THE COMMUNITY FOLLOWING A VIOLENT INCIDENT. CEASEFIRE HAS ONE VIOLENCE INTERRUPTER ASSIGNED EXCLUSIVELY TO CHRIST MEDICAL CENTER WITH OTHERS AVAILABLE AS NEEDED. WHEN A VICTIM OF VIOLENCE IS TRANSPORTED TO CHRIST'S EMERGENCY DEPARTMENT, THE VIOLENCE INTERRUPTER MEETS WITH THE VICTIM'S FAMILY MEMBERS AND FRIENDS, PROVIDING COUNSELING BEFORE RETALIATION CAN BE INITIATED TO QUELL THE LIKELIHOOD OF ANOTHER ACT OF VIOLENCE OCCURRING. IN 2014, THIS VIOLENCE INTERRUPTER MET WITH 617 PATIENTS WHO WERE VICTIMS OF VIOLENCE. NINETY PERCENT OF THESE PATIENTS WERE ASSESSED FOR FOLLOW-UP NEEDS AND 97.9% WERE CONNECTED TO LONG-TERM COMMUNITY SUPPORT.

GIVEN THIS INITIAL DATA, ACMC FURTHER REVIEWED AND PRIORITIZED THE COMMUNITIES OF HIGHEST NEED BASED ON DEMOGRAPHIC DATA AND USING THE DIGNITY HEALTH COMMUNITY NEEDS INDEX (CNI) FOR THE CHNA. THE RESULTS GAVE ACMC THE ABILITY TO FOCUS ON COMMUNITIES IN ITS SERVICE AREA WITH SPECIFIC BARRIERS TO HEALTH CARE ACCESS - NAMELY INCOME, CULTURE/LANGUAGE, EDUCATION, INSURANCE AND HOUSING. AS A RESULT, ACMC REFOCUSED WHERE THE SERVICES OF THE RONALD MCDONALD CARE MOBILE (RMCM) ARE PROVIDED. THE RMCM PROVIDES FREE PHYSICALS, IMMUNIZATIONS AND REFERRALS TO SPECIALISTS, DENTAL AND EYE CARE PROVIDERS AND PRIMARY CARE PHYSICIANS TO LOW INCOME, UNINSURED CHILDREN. THE GOAL IS TO IMPROVE CHILDREN'S HEALTH BY PROVIDING PRIMARY HEALTH CARE SERVICES AND IMPROVING RELATIONSHIPS WITH AREA FEDERALLY QUALIFIED HEALTH CENTERS (FQHCS) AND OTHER HEALTH PARTNERS WHO CAN OFFER REFERRALS TO SPECIALTY CARE. THE FIRST OBJECTIVE WAS TO IMPROVE COMPLIANCE FOR SCHOOL PHYSICALS & IMMUNIZATIONS AT HIGH-NEED SCHOOLS.

THE MEDICAL CENTER HAS ONE OF THE NATION'S LEADING VENTRICULAR ASSIST DEVICE (VAD) PROGRAMS FOR HEART TRANSPLANT AND ASSIST DEVICE. THIS PROGRAM OFFERS A BRIDGE TO TRANSPLANT THERAPY OR DESTINATION THERAPY FOR PATIENTS WHO ARE NOT TRANSPLANT CANDIDATES. ACMC'S HEART INSTITUTE FOR CHILDREN PROVIDES OPEN AND CLOSED HEART SURGERY, AND ATRIAL FIBRILLATION ABLATION TO TREAT CONGENITAL HEART DISEASES. THE INSTITUTE IS THE LARGEST PEDIATRIC HEART CENTER IN ILLINOIS. THE CONGESTIVE HEART FAILURE CLINIC TREATS MORE THAN 1,000 PATIENTS PER YEAR AT ALL STAGES OF HEART FAILURE AND HAS EARNED DISEASE SPECIFIC CERTIFICATION FROM THE JOINT COMMISSION (TJC). THE COMPREHENSIVE CARDIAC REHABILITATION PROGRAM IS ALSO NATIONALLY CERTIFIED BY THE AMERICAN ASSOCIATION OF CARDIAC AND PULMONARY REHABILITATION. FREQUENT COMMUNITY LECTURES AND HEALTH SCREENINGS, INCLUDING BLOOD PRESSURE, BLOOD SUGAR, BODY MASS INDEX AND ANKLE BRACHIAL INDEX FOR PERIPHERAL VASCULAR DISEASE, ARE PROVIDED TO THE COMMUNITY. ACMC ALSO FINANCIALLY SUPPORTS AND PARTNERS WITH THE MUSEUM OF SCIENCE AND INDUSTRY TO PROVIDE ""LIVE...FROM THE HEART,"" A VIDEOCONFERENCE-BASED CARDIOVASCULAR EDUCATION PROGRAM FOR HIGH SCHOOL STUDENTS FROM SUBURBAN AND CHICAGO PUBLIC SCHOOLS. THE PROGRAM'S ""REAL TIME"" VIEWING OF OPEN HEART SURGERY IN THE OPERATING ROOM IMPRESSES UPON STUDENTS THE IMPORTANCE OF MAINTAINING GOOD CARDIAC HEALTH, AS WELL AS EXPOSING STUDENTS TO POTENTIAL INTEREST IN HEALTH CARE CAREERS.

201533179349304323,362169147,4) OTHER SPECIFIC PROGRAMS ADDRESSING CULTURAL HEALTH DISPARITIES,"SINCE 2011, ADVOCATE LUTHERAN GENERAL HOSPITAL HAS BEEN ON A JOURNEY TO IDENTIFY NEEDS OF SPECIFIC CULTURAL GROUPS AND DESIGN PROGRAMS TO MEET THESE NEEDS. THIS INITIATIVE WILL CONTINUE ALTHOUGH THE NEED WAS NOT SELECTED AS A PRIORITY FROM THE CHNA. IN MAY 2011, A KOREAN NAVIGATOR, AN ADVANCED PRACTICE NURSE, WAS HIRED TO: (1) TRANSFORM THE DELIVERY OF CARE FOR THE ALGH KOREAN-AMERICAN POPULATION; (2) CREATE A KOREAN-AMERICAN HEALTH EDUCATION PROGRAM; (3) CREATE A KOREAN-AMERICAN HEALTH SCREENING PROGRAM; AND 4) BUILD A PROCESS TO CONTINUALLY ASSESS, IDENTIFY AND ADDRESS SPECIFIC HEALTH NEEDS IN THE KOREAN-AMERICAN COMMUNITY. A SEPARATE IN-DEPTH COMMUNITY HEALTH NEEDS ASSESSMENT OF THE KOREAN-AMERICAN COMMUNITY WAS COMPLETED IN DECEMBER 2014 WITH THE HANUL FAMILY ALLIANCE, A COMMUNITY PARTNER THAT WILL BE THE FOUNDATION FOR NEW PROGRAMMING MOVING FORWARD. IN DECEMBER 2012, A POLISH PATIENT NAVIGATOR WAS HIRED INITIALLY TO FOCUS ON BREAST HEALTH, BUT WILL BEGIN ADDRESSING COLORECTAL HEALTH AND COMPLETING A FULL HEALTH NEEDS ASSESSMENT FOR THE POLISH COMMUNITY IN THE 2014-2016 COMMUNITY HEALTH NEEDS ASSESSMENT CYCLE. WHILE THE ACCESS GENESIS CLINIC IN DES PLAINES (ORIGINALLY FOUNDED BY ADVOCATE LUTHERAN GENERAL HOSPITAL) CONTINUES TO ADDRESS THE NEEDS OF THE HISPANIC COMMUNITY IN LUTHERAN GENERAL'S PRIMARY SERVICE AREA (PSA), A MORE IN-DEPTH NEEDS ASSESSMENT WILL BE INCLUDED IN THE UPCOMING 2014-2016 CHNA CYCLE. 2014-2016 COMMUNITY HEALTH NEEDS ASSESSMENT AS PART OF ORGANIZING FOR THE 2014-2016 CHNA PROCESS, THE HOSPITAL MAINTAINED ITS REGULAR MEETING SCHEDULE FOR THE COMMUNITY HEALTH COUNCIL IN 2014 AND RECRUITED A SECOND KEY INDIVIDUAL FROM THE COOK COUNTY DEPARTMENT OF PUBLIC HEALTH TO SERVE ON THE COUNCIL. ADVOCATE GOOD SAMARITAN HOSPITAL THE TWO PRIORITY NEEDS SELECTED BY THE COMMUNITY HEALTH COUNCIL FOR THE HOSPITAL TO ADDRESS WERE CHILDHOOD OVERWEIGHT AND OBESITY, AND FALLS AMONG SENIORS. OVERWEIGHT AND OBESITY TO ADDRESS THE NEEDS OF OVERWEIGHT AND OBESE CHILDREN, GOOD SAMARITAN HEALTH AND WELLNESS CENTER AND ADVOCATE GOOD SAMARITAN HOSPITAL (AGSAM) ARE PARTNERING WITH THE PROACTIVE KIDS (PAK) FOUNDATION AND THE FORWARD INITIATIVE (FIGHTING OBESITY REACHING HEALTHY WEIGHT AMONG RESIDENTS OF DUPAGE). PROACTIVE KIDS (PAK) PROACTIVE KIDS TEACHES KIDS AND THEIR FAMILIES' FUN WAYS TO IMPROVE HEALTH AND DECREASE WEIGHT THROUGH A THREE PART PROGRAM: PAK FITNESS, PAK NUTRITION AND PAK LIFESTYLE COACHING. PAK IS OPEN TO CHILDREN 8-14 YEARS OLD WHO HAVE A BMI IN THE 85 PERCENTILE OR HIGHER. THIS FREE 8-WEEK PROGRAM INCLUDES PHYSICAL TRAINING, COUNSELING, NUTRITION AND GUIDED DISCUSSION. PARENTS ALSO PARTICIPATE IN THE PROGRAM WHICH EDUCATES FAMILIES TOGETHER IN ENGAGING AND SUSTAINABLE WAYS TO IMPROVE THEIR HEALTH THROUGH WEEKLY PHYSICAL EXERCISE, LESSONS AND ASSIGNMENTS. DATA IS COLLECTED AT THE BEGINNING AND END OF EACH 8-WEEK SESSION TO MEASURE WEIGHT, BMI, BODY FAT, FAT MASS AND FAT FREE MASS. OBJECTIVE #1: INCREASE COMMITMENT TO FITNESS AMONG PROGRAM PARTICIPANTS BY IMPLEMENTING THREE PROACTIVE KIDS (PAK) PLAN SESSIONS EACH YEAR FROM 2014-2016 FOR A TOTAL OF 9 EIGHT-WEEK SESSIONS. ACCOMPLISHMENTS: IN 2014, 3 EIGHT-WEEK SESSIONS OF PROACTIVE KIDS WERE OFFERED. (WINTER, SUMMER AND FALL) 1. IN WINTER OF 2014, 64% OF THE PARTICIPANTS (12 OF 19) ATTENDING DAY 1 COMPLETED THE 8-WEEK PROGRAM. 2. IN SUMMER OF 2014, 50% OF THE PARTICIPANTS (12 OF 24) ATTENDING DAY 1 COMPLETED THE 8-WEEK PROGRAM. 3. IN FALL OF 2014, 64% OF THE PARTICIPANTS (16 OF 25) ATTENDING DAY 1 COMPLETED THE 8-WEEK PROGRAM. 4. IN WINTER OF 2014, 100% OF THE PARTICIPANTS (12 OF 12) THAT COMPLETED SURVEY HAD AN IMPROVED COMMITMENT TO THEIR FITNESS. 5. IN SUMMER OF 2014, 89% OF THE PARTICIPANTS (8 OF 9) THAT COMPLETED SURVEY HAD AN IMPROVED COMMITMENT TO THEIR FITNESS. 6. IN FALL OF 2014, 100% OF THE PARTICIPANTS (14 OF 14) THAT COMPLETED SURVEY HAD AN IMPROVED COMMITMENT TO THEIR FITNESS. OBJECTIVE #2: CREATE HEALTHIER HABITS IN FOOD SELECTION, COOKING & EATING AND NUTRITION KNOWLEDGE AMONG PROGRAM PARTICIPANTS BY IMPLEMENTING THREE PROACTIVE KIDS (PAK) PLAN PROGRAMS EACH YEAR FROM 2014-2016 FOR A TOTAL OF 9 SESSIONS. ACCOMPLISHMENTS: 1. IN WINTER OF 2014, 100% OF THE PARTICIPANTS (12 OF 12) THAT COMPLETED SURVEY HAD A POSITIVE ATTITUDE CHANGE TOWARD THEIR DIET AND NUTRITION. 2. IN SUMMER OF 2014, 89% OF THE PARTICIPANTS (8 OF 9) THAT COMPLETED SURVEY HAD A POSITIVE ATTITUDE CHANGE TOWARD THEIR DIET AND NUTRITION. 3. IN FALL OF 2014, 93% OF THE PARTICIPANTS (14 OF 15) THAT COMPLETED SURVEY HAD A POSITIVE ATTITUDE CHANGE TOWARD THEIR DIET AND NUTRITION. OBJECTIVE #3: BUILD CONFIDENCE, INCREASE COMMUNICATION & TEACH COPING SKILLS AMONG PROGRAM PARTICIPANTS BY IMPLEMENTING THREE PROACTIVE KIDS (PAK) PLAN PROGRAMS EACH YEAR FROM 2014-2016 FOR A TOTAL OF 9 SESSIONS. ACCOMPLISHMENTS: 1. IN WINTER OF 2014, 58% OF THE PARTICIPANTS (7 OF 12) THAT COMPLETED SURVEY RECOGNIZED AN IMPROVEMENT IN SOCIAL ENGAGEMENT. 2. IN SUMMER OF 2014, 88% OF THE PARTICIPANTS (7 OF 8) THAT COMPLETED SURVEY RECOGNIZED AN IMPROVEMENT IN SOCIAL ENGAGEMENT. 3. IN FALL OF 2014, 86% OF THE PARTICIPANTS (12 OF 14) THAT COMPLETED SURVEY RECOGNIZED AN IMPROVEMENT IN SOCIAL ENGAGEMENT. FORWARD INITIATIVE THE FORWARD INITIATIVE IS A BROAD-BASED COMMUNITY COALITION IN DUPAGE COUNTY THAT COLLABORATES TO PROMOTE EFFECTIVE AND SUSTAINABLE POLICY, SYSTEM, AND ENVIRONMENTAL (PSE) STRATEGIES FOR CHILDREN AND FAMILIES TO ACHIEVE A HEALTHY WEIGHT. OBJECTIVE #1: IDENTIFY EVIDENCE-BASED INTERVENTIONS TO REDUCE OBESITY THROUGH EFFECTIVE AND SUSTAINABLE POLICY, SYSTEM AND ENVIRONMENTAL (PSE) CHANGE STRATEGIES TO REVERSE THE TREND OF OBESITY IN DUPAGE COUNTY. ACCOMPLISHMENTS: PSE CHANGES 1. IN 2014-2015, ACHIEVED 15 POLICY AND ENVIRONMENTAL CHANGES WITH 5 CHILD CARE CENTERS IN AGSAM'S SECONDARY SERVICE AREA. OBJECTIVE #2: REDUCE THE PREVALENCE OF OVERWEIGHT AND OBESITY AMONG DUPAGE COUNTY SCHOOL CHILDREN AND ADOLESCENTS (KINDERGARTEN, 6TH AND 9TH GRADES) FROM 2010-2011 BASELINE OF 31.1% (N=11,496). ACCOMPLISHMENTS: REDUCTION IN OVERWEIGHT AND OBESITY RATES 1. THE OVERALL OVERWEIGHT AND OBESITY RATES AS MEASURED BY THE 2013-2014 BMI RATES REMAINED STEADY (29.7%, N=30, 174) AFTER DUPAGE COUNTY EXPERIENCED A 1% STATISTICALLY SIGNIFICANT DECREASE, IN 2012-2013 FROM 31.1% TO 29.9% (N=27,914). 2. OVERALL OBESITY ONLY RATES WERE REDUCED FROM 15.1% IN THE 2010-2011 BASELINE YEARS, TO 14.4% BY 2013-2014, AFTER AN INCREASE IN OVERALL OBESITY OF 0.3% IN 2011-2012. SENIOR HEALTH DATA FROM THE HOSPITAL'S TRAUMA REGISTRY INDICATED FALLS AMONG SENIORS AS THE NUMBER ONE REASON FOR ADMISSION INTO THE EMERGENCY DEPARTMENT. A MATTER OF BALANCE (MOB) IS AN EVIDENCE-BASED, LAY LED MODEL, DEVELOPED BY BOSTON UNIVERSITY THAT IS APPROPRIATE FOR SENIORS LIVING IN PEACE MEMORIAL MANOR AND FOR SENIORS LIVING IN THE HOSPITAL'S BROADER PRIMARY SERVICE AREA (PSA). IT IS AN 8-SESSION PROGRAM THAT INCORPORATES PHYSICAL ACTIVITY, EDUCATION AND SMALL GROUP DISCUSSION. THE GOALS OF THE PROGRAM ARE TO IMPROVE ATTITUDES AND ALLEVIATE A FEAR OF FALLING THROUGH INCREASING PHYSICAL ACTIVITY AS MEASURED BY PRE- AND POST-CLASS SURVEYS. RESEARCH FROM BOSTON UNIVERSITY INDICATES THAT SENIORS WHO FEEL IN CONTROL OF THEIR FEAR OF FALLING ARE MORE ACTIVE AND THOSE SENIORS WHO ARE MORE ACTIVE ARE LESS LIKELY TO FALL. WHILE ONLY ONE CLASS SERIES WAS IMPLEMENTED DURING 2014, THE HOSPITAL ANTICIPATES EXPANSION OF THIS PROGRAM INTO ADDITIONAL INDEPENDENT AND ASSISTED LIVING FACILITIES AS WELL AS DEVELOPMENT OF PARTNERSHIPS WITH COMMUNITY GROUPS TO BRING MATTER OF BALANCE TO INDEPENDENT SENIORS AT RISK FOR FALLS IN THE PSA. OBJECTIVE #1: SENIORS PARTICIPATING IN MATTER OF BALANCE PROGRAM LEARN TO VIEW FALLS AND FEAR OF FALLING AS CONTROLLABLE. ACCOMPLISHMENTS: 1. IN MAY 2014, 100% OF THE 12 SENIORS WHO ATTENDED MATTER OF BALANCE (MOB) COMPLETED 5 OUT OF 8 CLASSES REQUIRED TO GRADUATE. 2. IN NOVEMBER 2014, 89% OF THE 9 SENIORS WHO ATTENDED MATTER OF BALANCE (MOB) COMPLETED 5 OUT OF 8 CLASSES REQUIRED TO GRADUATE. 3. IN MAY 2014, 100% OF THE PARTICIPANTS (12 OF 12) SELF-REPORTED FEELING MORE COMFORTABLE TALKING WITH OTHERS ABOUT HIS/HER FEAR OF FALLING. 4. IN NOVEMBER 2014, 83% OF THE PARTICIPANTS (5 OF 6) SELF-REPORTED FEELING MORE COMFORTABLE TALKING WITH OTHERS ABOUT HIS/HER FEAR OF FALLING. 5. MOB COACH TRAININGS WERE CONDUCTED ON MARCH 13 AND NOVEMBER 13, 2014, FOR 6 COACHES TO LEAD MOB CLASSES. OBJECTIVE #2: SENIORS PARTICIPATING IN MATTER OF BALANCE PROGRAM SET REALISTIC GOALS TO INCREASE ACTIVITY. ACCOMPLISHMENTS: 1. IN MAY 2014, 100% OF THE PARTICIPANTS (12 OF 12) REPORTED ON THE POST SURVEY THAT THEY PLAN TO CONTINUE EXERCISING. 2. IN NOVEMBER 2014, 100% OF THE PARTICIPANTS (6 OF 6) REPORTED ON THE POST SURVEY THAT THEY PLAN TO CONTINUE EXERCISING. OBJECTIVE #3: SENIORS PARTICIPATING IN MATTER OF BALANCE PROGRAM CHANGE THEIR ENVIRONMENT TO REDUCE FALL RISK FACTORS. ACCOMPLISHMENTS: 1. IN MAY 2014, ON THE POST SURVEY, 92% OF THE PARTICIPANTS (11 OF 12) INDICATED THEY"
201533179349304323,362169147,NEEDS NOT SELECTED TO ADDRESS,"THERE ARE FOUR AREAS OF NEED FOR WHICH THE COMMUNITY HEALTH COUNCIL DID NOT CHOOSE PRIORITY ACTION BECAUSE THEY HAVE PREVIOUSLY BEEN, AND CONTINUE TO BE ADDRESSED, THROUGH SPECIFICALLY DESIGNED CLINICAL PROGRAMS AND COMMUNITY OUTREACH ACTIVITIES. THESE AREAS COMPRISE MENTAL HEALTH SERVICES, ACCESS TO CARE, SUBSTANCE ABUSE AND INFECTIOUS DISEASE. MENTAL HEALTH SERVICES THE COMMUNITY HEALTH COUNCIL DECIDED NOT TO FOCUS ON MENTAL HEALTH SERVICES AT THIS TIME. WHILE GOOD SAMARITAN HOSPITAL PROVIDES SIGNIFICANT MENTAL HEALTH RESOURCES FOR ADULT AND GERIATRIC POPULATIONS, THE HOSPITAL DOES NOT HAVE EXPERTISE WITH CHILD AND ADOLESCENT BEHAVIORAL HEALTH PATIENTS. ADDITIONALLY, DUE TO A VARIETY OF REASONS, THE HOSPITAL IS CURRENTLY EXPERIENCING A SHORTAGE OF PSYCHIATRISTS AND DOES NOT HAVE THE STAFFING RESOURCES TO EXPAND COMMUNITY-BASED SERVICES AT THIS TIME. HOWEVER, GOOD SAMARITAN HOSPITAL DOES PARTNER WITH SEVERAL ORGANIZATIONS TO OFFER SUPPORT GROUPS AND PROGRAMMING DEDICATED TO PROVIDING ASSISTANCE AND ENCOURAGEMENT TO PATIENTS WITH BEHAVIORAL HEALTH CONCERNS. THESE INCLUDE: * NATIONAL ALLIANCE ON MENTAL ILLNESS (NAMI) CONNECTION, RECOVERY SUPPORT GROUP PROGRAM FOR ADULTS LIVING WITH MENTAL ILLNESS. * NAMI FAMILY SUPPORT GROUP * FAMILIES AND MENTAL ILLNESS...LEARNING, INSPIRING, EDUCATION AND SUPPORT (F.A.M.I.L.I.E.S) LED BY NAMI COUNSELORS AND HELD AT ADVOCATE GOOD SAMARITAN HOSPITAL * GOOD SAMARITAN'S DOMESTIC VIOLENCE SUPPORT GROUP * DEPRESSION AND BIPOLAR SUPPORT ALLIANCE * DEMENTIA SUPPORT GROUP ACCESS TO HEALTH CARE ACCORDING TO THE AGENCY FOR HEALTHCARE RESEARCH AND QUALITY, ACCESS TO HEALTH CARE IS THE THIRD MOST IMPORTANT FACTOR NEEDED FOR A HEALTHY COMMUNITY. HOWEVER, SINCE THE HOSPITAL IS ALREADY MAKING MAJOR FINANCIAL CONTRIBUTIONS (AND WILL CONTINUE TO DO SO) AND IS COLLABORATING WITH MULTIPLE COMMUNITY PARTNERS TO ADDRESS HEALTH ACCESS NEEDS, THE COMMUNITY HEALTH COUNCIL HAS CHOSEN NOT TO EXPAND FOCUS INTO THIS AREA DURING THE 2011-2013 THREE-YEAR CHNA CYCLE. ACCESS DUPAGE FOR MORE THAN TEN YEARS, GOOD SAMARITAN HOSPITAL HAS PARTNERED WITH ACCESS DUPAGE AND HAS PROVIDED CASH DONATIONS AND CHARITY CARE FOR ACCESS DUPAGE PARTICIPANTS. ACCESS DUPAGE REPRESENTS A UNIQUE PARTNERSHIP OF HOSPITALS, PHYSICIANS, LOCAL GOVERNMENT, HUMAN SERVICES AGENCIES AND COMMUNITY GROUPS WORKING TOGETHER LOCALLY TO ADDRESS THE LOCAL ACCESS TO HEALTH CARE NEEDS. QUALIFIED APPLICANTS ARE TYPICALLY ENROLLED IN THE ACCESS DUPAGE PROGRAM FOR A PERIOD OF ONE YEAR, AFTER WHICH THEY MUST RE-APPLY FOR MEMBERSHIP IN THE PROGRAM AND THEIR ELIGIBILITY MUST BE RE-VERIFIED. MEMBERSHIP IN THE ACCESS DUPAGE PROGRAM PROVIDES ACCESS TO MEDICAL SERVICES TO DUPAGE COUNTY'S LOW-INCOME, MEDICALLY UNINSURED RESIDENTS. IN ADDITION TO SUPPORTING ACCESS DUPAGE WITH DONATIONS, GOOD SAMARITAN HOSPITAL ACCEPTS QUALIFIED PARTICIPANTS AT ITS SITES OF CARE FOR DIAGNOSIS AND TREATMENT AT NO COST. THE HOSPITAL ALSO ENCOURAGES PHYSICIANS ON ITS MEDICAL STAFF TO TAKE THESE PATIENTS INTO THEIR MEDICAL PRACTICES AT NO COST. THESE PHYSICIANS THEN BECOME THE MEDICAL HOME FOR ACCESS DUPAGE MEMBERS. ELIGIBLE PARTICIPANTS MUST: * RESIDE IN DUPAGE COUNTY FOR AT LEAST 30 DAYS * BE UNDER AGE 65 * HAVE A HOUSEHOLD INCOME BELOW 200% OF THE FEDERAL POVERTY LEVEL * HAVE NO MEDICAL INSURANCE * BE INELIGIBLE FOR PRIVATE OR PUBLIC HEALTH COVERAGE PROGRAMS (E.G., MEDICAID, MEDICARE, VETERANS BENEFITS, ETC.). IN 2014, THE HOSPITAL CONTRIBUTED OVER $834,218 IN DIRECT CASH DONATIONS TO SUPPORT PROGRAM OPERATIONS AND $2,367,026 FOR SERVICES FOR ACCESS DUPAGE PARTICIPANTS. THE DECREASE OF CASH DONATIONS AND SERVICES OF $10,946,372 FROM 2013 REPORTED FIGURE OF $13,310,753 IS DUE TO THE MANY ACCESS DUPAGE PATIENTS NOW ELIGIBLE FOR THE EXPANDED MEDICAID SERVICES. WHY WAIT CLINIC A SECOND LONG-TERM COMMUNITY COLLABORATION IS THE ""WHY WAIT CLINIC,"" IN COOPERATION WITH THE DUPAGE COUNTY HEALTH DEPARTMENT. THIS PROGRAM PROVIDES UNDERSERVED, UNINSURED, UNDERINSURED AND LOW-INCOME WOMEN ACCESS TO FREE SCREENING BREAST AND PELVIC EXAMS; PAP SMEARS; AND MAMMOGRAMS AS WELL AS DIAGNOSTIC BIOPSIES AND SURGERIES; AND TREATMENT WHEN NECESSARY. IN 2014, GOOD SAMARITAN HOSPITAL PROVIDED 239 SERVICES TO DUPAGE COUNTY WOMEN. USE OF GOOD SAMARITAN HOSPITAL'S DIAGNOSTIC IMAGING SUITES AND STAFF RESULTED IN A TOTAL COMMUNITY BENEFIT OF $477,367. ENGAGE DUPAGE ENGAGE DUPAGE IS A COLLABORATIVE INITIATIVE IMPLEMENTED IN OCTOBER OF 2014 BY THE DUPAGE COUNTY HEALTH DEPARTMENT AND ADVOCATE GOOD SAMARITAN HOSPITAL TO ADDRESS THE NEEDS OF SELF-PAY, MANG-PENDING AND MEDICAID PATIENTS WHO HAVE BEHAVIORAL/MENTAL HEALTH PROBLEMS, ARE CHEMICALLY DEPENDENT AND/OR ARE CONSIDERED TO BE ""AT RISK"" (I.E., PATIENTS WHO USE THE ED TO MANAGE THEIR CHRONIC CONDITIONS SUCH AS ASTHMA, COPD, HEART DISEASE DIABETES, HYPERTENSION, ETC.). A COMMUNITY RESOURCE LIAISON (CRL) FROM THE DUPAGE COUNTY HEALTH DEPARTMENT (DCHD) IS PLACED IN GSAM'S EMERGENCY ROOM DURING THE DAYS AND TIMES THAT CORRESPOND TO THE HEAVIEST ED TRAFFIC. THE GOALS OF THE PROGRAM INCLUDE: 1) IMPROVING THE HEALTH STATUS OF PATIENTS WHO ARE SELF-PAY, MANG-PENDING, AND MEDICAID BY ENROLLING PERSONS IN PROGRAMS FOR WHICH THEY ARE ELIGIBLE THROUGH A FOCUSED POPULATION-BASED HEALTH PARTNERSHIP; AND 2) CONNECTING FREQUENT ED USERS (DEFINED AS PATIENTS USING THE ED TWICE IN ONE MONTH OR MORE THAN 4 TIMES WITHIN A 6-MONTH ROLLING TIME FRAME) TO A MEDICAL HOME OR COMMUNITY PROGRAM TO HELP DECREASE THE NEED FOR UNNECESSARY ED VISITS. EXPECTED RESULTS OF THE PROGRAM INCLUDE: 1. HEALTH COVERAGE - FOR ALL PATIENTS THAT ATTEND A FOLLOW-UP APPOINTMENT, ACHIEVE A 50% ENROLLMENT INTO A FORM OF HEALTH COVERAGE. IN THE FOURTH QUARTER OF 2014, ACHIEVED 32% ENROLLMENT (24 APPROVED ENROLLMENTS OF 74 APPOINTMENTS). 2. FREQUENT USE - PATIENTS WHO ARE FREQUENT USERS WITH COMORBIDITIES RELATED TO BH/MENTAL HEALTH AND ""AT-RISK"" AND ARE SELF-PAY OR MEDICAID, ACHIEVE A 50% DECREASE IN ER VISITS. IN THE FOURTH QUARTER OF 2014, ACHIEVED 17.5% PATIENT DECREASE FROM BASELINE. 3. ENROLLMENT IN APPROPRIATE COMMUNITY PROGRAMS - PATIENTS WHO ARE BH/MENTAL HEALTH, CHEMICAL DEPENDENCY AND ""AT-RISK"" AND ATTEND A FOLLOW-UP APPOINTMENT, ACHIEVE A 40% ENROLLMENT RATE INTO A COMMUNITY PROGRAM (E.G., DUPAGE COUNTY BEHAVIORAL HEALTH SERVICES). IN THE FOURTH QUARTER OF 2014, 177 PATIENT CONTACTS WERE INITIATED WITH 110 BENEFITTING APPOINTMENTS SCHEDULED. OF THE 110 APPOINTMENTS SCHEDULED, 74 PATIENTS ATTENDED THEIR FOLLOW-UP APPOINTMENTS. 46 OF THE 74 PATIENTS WHO ATTENDED A FOLLOW-UP APPOINTMENT (OR 62%) COMPLETED APPLICATIONS AND WERE ENROLLED IN COMMUNITY PROGRAMS: 18 IN DCHD PROGRAMS, 6 IN SNAP, 1 IN ACCESS DUPAGE, AND 21 BETWEEN ADULT MEDICAID, ALL KIDS, AND MPE. IT SHOULD BE NOTED THAT THE RELATIONSHIP BETWEEN GSAM AND DCHD IN THE ENGAGE DUPAGE COLLABORATIVE IS A CONTRACTUAL ONE. AS PART OF THE AGREEMENT, THE CRL POSITION IS A PAID POSITION OF THE DUPAGE COUNTY HEALTH DEPARTMENT WHILE THE HOSPITAL PROVIDES THE WORKSPACE, ACCESS TO THE TECHNOLOGY NEEDED TO DO THE WORK (E.G., TELEPHONES, COMPUTER, EMR, ETC.) AND ORIENTATION TO THE WORK TEAM IN THE ED. GSAM IS ALSO RESPONSIBLE FOR GATHERING PERTINENT DATA AND PROVIDING IT TO THE PUBLIC HEALTH DEPARTMENT TO ASSIST THEM IN MONITORING AND REPORTING OUTCOMES. AN ADDITIONAL BARRIER TO ACCESSING HEALTH CARE IS LANGUAGE. COMMUNICATION IS CRITICAL TO A PATIENT'S UNDERSTANDING OF THEIR PLAN OF CARE. LACK OF COMMUNICATION DUE TO LANGUAGE BARRIERS OR DEAFNESS CAN IMPEDE THAT UNDERSTANDING. INTERPRETER SERVICES ARE PROVIDED BY THE HOSPITAL, AT NO COST, TO PATIENTS WHO NEED THEM. THE DUPAGE COUNTY COMMUNITY NEEDS ASSESSMENT INDICATES AN INCREASE IN ETHNIC AND CULTURAL DIVERSITY, ESPECIALLY IN THE HISPANIC POPULATION IN DUPAGE COUNTY. ACCESS TO HEALTH CARE CAN BE CHALLENGING FOR A VARIETY OF REASONS, BUT THESE DIFFICULTIES ARE MULTIPLIED FOR PEOPLE WITH DECREASED COMMUNICATION CAPACITY AND VARIED CULTURAL DIFFERENCES. DIFFICULTY COMMUNICATING CAN ALSO COMPOUND LOW HEALTH LITERACY. GOOD SAMARITAN HOSPITAL CONTINUES TO EXPAND ACCESS TO CARE WITH MEDICAL INTERPRETERS FOR LIMITED ENGLISH PROFICIENT PATIENTS WHO WOULD OTHERWISE NOT BE ABLE TO COMMUNICATE AND UNDERSTAND THEIR PLAN OF CARE. IN 2010, THREE FULL-TIME, ON-SITE, SPANISH INTERPRETERS, IN COMBINATION WITH OUTSIDE AGENCY INTERPRETERS, PROVIDED COMMUNICATION ASSISTANCE FOR 5,645 ENCOUNTERS. SERVICES WERE PROVIDED AT THE MAIN HOSPITAL AS WELL AS AT THE LEMONT, WOODRIDGE, AND DOWNERS GROVE OUTPATIENT CENTERS AND THE HEALTH AND WELLNESS CENTER AT A COST OF $468,379 TO THE HOSPITAL. BY 2012, THE NEED FOR INTERPRETERS HAD RISEN 29%, CLIMBING TO 7,292 ENCOUNTERS AT A COST OF $756,237 WITH REQUESTS FOR ASSISTANCE IN MORE THAN 40 DIFFERENT LANGUAGES AT THE MAIN HOSPITAL CAMPUS AND OFFSITE LOCATIONS. IN 2013, THE LANGUAGE ASSISTANCE COSTS FOR THE HOSPITAL INCREASED TO $888,077. IN 2014, THE LANGUAGE ASSISTANCE COST TO THE HOSPITAL DECREASED TO $528,943 DUE TO AN IMPROVED CONTRACTUAL AGREEMENT WITH THE HOSPITAL'S SERVICE PROVIDER BY USING INTERPRE"

ADVOCATE HEALTH CARE IMPLEMENTED A MANDATORY FLU VACCINE PROGRAM IN 2011 THAT INCLUDES GOOD SAMARITAN STAFF, PHYSICIANS AND VOLUNTEERS. STUDIES HAVE SHOWN THAT WHEN HEALTH CARE WORKERS GET FLU SHOTS, THE NUMBER OF PATIENTS WITH INFLUENZA-LIKE ILLNESS GREATLY DECREASES, AS DOES PATIENT MORTALITY. SINCE THE INCEPTION OF MANDATORY FLU VACCINATION, DEATHS FROM HOSPITAL-ACQUIRED INFLUENZA HAVE BEEN ELIMINATED FOR THE PERIODS 2011-2012 AND 2012-2013. IN ADDITION, THE NUMBER OF HOSPITAL-ACQUIRED INFLUENZA CASES HAS DECREASED FROM 3.2% TO 2% OF ALL FLU HOSPITALIZATIONS. ACCORDING TO THE DUPAGE COUNTY BEHAVIOR RISK FACTOR SURVEY (BRFS), THE CENTERS FOR DISEASE CONTROL'S ADVISORY COMMITTEE ON IMMUNIZATION PRACTICES RECOMMENDS THAT ADULTS OVER AGE 65 RECEIVE ONE DOSE OF THE PNEUMONIA VACCINE IN THEIR LIFETIME. THE PNEUMONIA VACCINE IS ONLY RECOMMENDED FOR INDIVIDUALS BETWEEN THE AGES OF 19 AND 64 WHO SUFFER FROM A CHRONIC CONDITION. FOR THIS YOUNGER POPULATION, A ONE-TIME REVACCINATION IS ADVISED 5 YEARS AFTER THE INITIAL VACCINATION. THE PERCENTAGE OF ADULTS IN DUPAGE COUNTY WHO HAD EVER RECEIVED A PNEUMONIA VACCINE WAS 26.0% IN 2010. THIS PERCENTAGE IS COMPARABLE TO THE 2010 ILLINOIS PERCENTAGE OF 26.2. ASSESSMENT DATA COMPILED BY PROFESSIONAL RESEARCH CONSULTANTS (PRC) FOR GOOD SAMARITAN HOSPITAL'S PSA INDICATES 59% OF RESPONDENTS DO NOT RECEIVE INFLUENZA VACCINES AND 77% OF RESPONDENTS DO NOT TAKE ADVANTAGE OF THE PNEUMOCOCCAL VACCINE. HOWEVER, OF ADULTS 65 YEARS OF AGE AND OLDER, 72.3% HAD A FLU VACCINE WITHIN THE PAST 12 MONTHS, A RATE HIGHER THAN THAT IN ILLINOIS IN 2010, AT 65.5%. LOCALLY, THE RETAIL SECTOR (OSCO DRUG, CVS PHARMACY AND WALGREENS IN DUPAGE COUNTY) PROMOTES THIS ENDEAVOR WITH TREMENDOUS ADVERTISING AND MAKES BOTH VACCINES READILY AVAILABLE TO THE PUBLIC FOR A LOW COST. NEW COLLABORATIONS IN 2014 TO IMPLEMENT FOR NEXT CHNA CYCLE IN 2014, ADVOCATE GOOD SAMARITAN HOSPITAL BEGAN PARTICIPATING IN IMPACT DUPAGE, A GROUP OF COMMUNITY LEADERS AND ORGANIZATIONS WORKING TOGETHER TO DETERMINE COMMUNITY NEEDS AND PRIORITIES THAT WILL IMPROVE THE WELL-BEING OF THE DUPAGE COUNTY COMMUNITY.

ACCOMPLISHMENTS DURING 2014 IN THESE THREE AREAS ARE DESCRIBED BELOW. FALLS AMONG SENIORS FALLS AMONG SENIORS (65+) ARE A SIGNIFICANT HEALTH RISK AND THE NUMBER ONE CAUSE OF TRAUMA ADMISSIONS TO ADVOCATE GOOD SHEPHERD HOSPITAL. IN 2009, THE HOSPITAL'S COMMUNITY HEALTH COMMITTEE EMBARKED ON EFFORTS TO ADDRESS THIS RISK. SINCE THAT TIME, ADVOCATE GOOD SHEPHERD HAS CONDUCTED PROGRAMMING TO ADDRESS FALLS. IN 2012, FOUR GOOD SHEPHERD ASSOCIATES (EMPLOYEES) BECAME LICENSED MASTER TRAINERS UNDER THE MATTER OF BALANCE LAY LEAD MODEL WHICH UTILIZES COMMUNITY COACHES TO TEACH THE 8 SESSION CLASSES. AS A RESULT, THE HOSPITAL WAS ABLE TO CONDUCT 15 COMMUNITY CLASSES USING THE COACHING MODEL IN 2014. THE RESULTS FROM PARTICIPANTS SHOWED A 30 PERCENT IMPROVEMENT IN THEIR ABILITY TO REDUCE FALL RISK FACTORS IN THEIR LIVES. CHILDHOOD OBESITY IN THE 2013-14 ACADEMIC YEAR, OVER 10,000 (K-12) STUDENTS FROM 39 SCHOOLS PARTICIPATED IN ADVOCATE GOOD SHEPHERD HOSPITAL'S SCHOOL-BASED CHILDHOOD OBESITY PREVENTION PROGRAM KNOWN AS CATCH, THE COORDINATED APPROACH TO CHILD HEALTH. THIS PROGRAM ADDRESSES INTERVENTIONS TO IMPACT NUTRITION AND HEALTH. STUDENTS ARE TESTED FOR FITNESS LEVELS IN THE FALL AND SPRING AND THE RESULTS ARE COMPARED. RESULTS INDICATED A 4% IMPROVEMENT IN THE SAMPLE OF STUDENTS TESTED ACROSS 39 SCHOOLS. IN ADDITION, 44 ENVIRONMENTAL IMPROVEMENTS HAVE BEEN MADE IN SCHOOLS, SUCH AS IMPROVEMENTS IN NUTRITIONAL VALUE OF SNACKS IN VENDING MACHINES, LIMITATION ON SALE OF SUGARED BEVERAGES, AND SO FORTH. EXPANSION OF THE PROGRAM WILL CONTINUE THROUGHOUT THE HOSPITAL'S SERVICE AREA. CANCER (PREVENTION AND DETECTION) ADVOCATE GOOD SHEPHERD HOSPITAL HAS A CANCER COMMITTEE IN PLACE THAT IS DEDICATED TO CANCER PREVENTION AND EARLY DETECTION. IN 2014, SOME OF THE TACTICS INCLUDED CONNECTING PATIENTS AND FAMILIES TO 2-1-1 INFORMATION AND REFERRAL TO SOCIAL SERVICE RESOURCES, CONTINUING TO WORK WITH PATIENT NAVIGATORS TO IDENTIFY PATIENT NEEDS, AND HOSTING COMMUNITY LECTURES ON MULTIPLE TYPES OF CANCER TO ENCOURAGE CONVERSATIONS WITH HEALTH CARE PROVIDERS. GOOD SHEPHERD ALSO HAD COMMUNITY OUTREACH CAMPAIGNS ON COLON CANCER AWARENESS AND SCREENING, BREAST CANCER AWARENESS FOR UNDERSERVED POPULATIONS, AND E-CIGARETTES IN SCHOOLS. IN REGARDS TO COLON CANCER AWARENESS, LETTERS WERE SENT TO COMMUNITY MEMBERS REMINDING THEM TO GET THEIR BASELINE COLONOSCOPY AT AGE 50 AND NURSES ATTENDED COMMUNITY EXPOS FOR EDUCATION AND AWARENESS. IN ADDITION, MEETINGS WERE COORDINATED WITH AREA PHYSICIANS, BOTH GENERAL PRACTITIONERS AND SPECIALISTS, ABOUT PARTICIPATING IN SCREENING PROGRAMS AT THE HOSPITAL. E-CIGARETTE PREVENTION WAS ALSO ADDRESSED BY PARTNERING WITH AREA MIDDLE SCHOOLS AND HIGH SCHOOLS AND/OR ATTENDING COMMUNITY EVENTS WHERE THE TARGET AUDIENCE - YOUTHS - WERE PRESENT, NOT ONLY PROVIDING PREVENTION EDUCATION BUT ALSO TO CAPTURE FEEDBACK RELATED TO EDUCATIONAL MATERIALS. THERE WERE THREE OTHER IMPORTANT NEEDS THAT WERE NOT SELECTED AS PRIORITIES FOR NEW ACTIVITY BECAUSE THEY HAVE BEEN, AND CONTINUE TO BE ADDRESSED THROUGH EXISTING PROGRAMS OR PARTNERSHIPS. MENTAL HEALTH MENTAL HEALTH IS ADDRESSED BY MULTIPLE COMMUNITY ORGANIZATIONS THAT THE HOSPITAL SUPPORTS, SUCH AS SAMARITAN COUNSELING CENTER AND THE PIONEER CENTER FOR HUMAN SERVICES. THE HOSPITAL IS ALSO PROVIDING COMPLIMENTARY SPACE AT TWO ADVOCATE FACILITIES TO BEHAVIORAL HEALTH PROVIDERS IN THE COMMUNITY. THE COMMUNITY HEALTH COUNCIL SET TARGETS FOR COLLABORATION AND INTEGRATION WITH COMMUNITY GROUPS TO HELP ADDRESS BEHAVIORAL HEALTH NEEDS. THE HEALTHIER BARRINGTON COALITION DEVELOPED A MENTAL HEALTH TASK FORCE TO HELP DETERMINE THE MOST PRESSING NEEDS AND HOW THE COMMUNITY MIGHT BETTER COLLABORATE TO MEET THOSE NEEDS. DIABETES/CHOLESTEROL/CARDIOVASCULAR DISEASE WHEN GOOD SHEPHERD HOSPITAL'S CHNA REVEALED THAT TYPE II DIABETES WAS CONTINUING TO INCREASE IN THE HOSPITAL'S COMMUNITY, THE HOSPITAL RESPONDED BY DEVELOPING AFFORDABLE DIABETES SCREENINGS. THESE SCREENINGS WERE OFFERED TO INDIVIDUALS IN THE COMMUNITY WITH THE INTENTION OF IDENTIFYING PEOPLE WHO UNKNOWINGLY HAVE PRE-DIABETES OR DIABETES, AND TO ENCOURAGE THEM TO ADOPT LIFESTYLE CHANGES THAT HELP THEM MANAGE THEIR CONDITION. BECAUSE THE HISPANIC POPULATION IS AT A GREATER RISK FOR TYPE II DIABETES, PROMOTIONAL MATERIALS ARE AVAILABLE IN SPANISH AND THE STAFF INCLUDES BILINGUAL CLINICIANS. IN 2014, DIABETES SCREENINGS WERE OFFERED QUARTERLY TO MEMBERS OF THE COMMUNITY. NEARLY 72 PERCENT OF THOSE IDENTIFIED AS HIGH-RISK RETURNED FOR FOLLOW-UP CARE AND RE-TESTING. FOR HALF OF THESE INDIVIDUALS, THEIR A1C SCORES IMPROVED. MOTOR VEHICLE ACCIDENTS (TEEN) THE COUNCIL FELT THAT THE HOSPITAL IS ALREADY ADDRESSING THIS NEED BY BEING PART OF OPERATION CLICK. OPERATION CLICK IS A COMMUNITY PROGRAM THAT ADDRESSES THE RISK FOR YOUTH MOTOR VEHICLE FATALITIES. THE HOSPITAL HAS BEEN ACTIVE ON OPERATION CLICK'S BOARD OF DIRECTORS, PROVIDES FUNDING FOR ITS ANNUAL BANQUET AND RECENTLY PROVIDED FUNDING SO THE ORGANIZATION COULD HIRE A PART-TIME PROGRAM COORDINATOR FOR 24 MONTHS. THE SEED FUNDING WILL ALLOW THE COORDINATOR TO DEVELOP A FUNDING STREAM FOR SUSTAINMENT OF OPERATION CLICK IN THE FUTURE. OVERALL, OPERATION CLICK HAS BEEN IMPACTFUL AND HAS RESULTED IN IMPROVED SEAT BELT COMPLIANCE AS DOCUMENTED BY AN INCREASE IN AVERAGE COMPLIANCE RATES FROM 79% ON THE PRE-SURVEY TO 98% AS REPORTED BY PARTICIPANTS ON THE POST-PROGRAM SURVEY. NEEDS NOT SELECTED TO ADDRESS THERE WERE TWO REMAINING IMPORTANT NEEDS IDENTIFIED THAT THE HOSPITAL IS NOT ADDRESSING-DENTAL HEALTH AND BILINGUAL LITERACY. DENTAL HEALTH ADVOCATE GOOD SHEPHERD HOSPITAL DOES NOT HAVE ANY"
201533179349304323,362169147,ADVOCATE SOUTH SUBURBAN HOSPITAL,"HEALTH NEED SELECTED TO ADDRESS ASTHMA ASTHMA AND OTHER RESPIRATORY-RELATED DISEASES WITHIN SOUTH SUBURBAN HOSPITAL'S PSA WERE SELECTED AS THE TOP HEALTH NEED TO ADDRESS. AN EXAMINATION OF SOUTH SUBURBAN HOSPITAL'S INPATIENT ADMISSIONS AND EMERGENCY DEPARTMENT (ED) UTILIZATION DATA SHOWS THERE ARE A SIGNIFICANT NUMBER OF INDIVIDUALS THAT SEEK SERVICES FOR ASTHMA/RESPIRATORY HEALTH ISSUES FROM THE HOSPITAL. IN FACT, PULMONARY ADMISSIONS WERE THE SECOND MOST PREVALENT TYPE OF INPATIENT ADMISSION AND THE EIGHTH MOST PREVALENT REASON FOR ED VISITS. THE SEVERITY AND PREVALENCE OF ASTHMA IS MOST EVIDENT IN LOW INCOME, MINORITY COMMUNITIES, AND THE DISPARITIES IN HOSPITALIZATION RATES FOR AFRICAN AMERICAN CHILDREN ARE STAGGERING, MAKING THIS A PROMINENT COMMUNITY HEALTH ISSUE. NATIONALLY, ASTHMA AFFECTS APPROXIMATELY 7.1 MILLION CHILDREN. THE DISEASE IS ONE OF THE LEADING CAUSES OF SCHOOL ABSENTEEISM - ACCOUNTING FOR MORE THAN 14 MILLION MISSED SCHOOL DAYS ANNUALLY (COOK COUNTY DEPARTMENT OF PUBLIC HEALTH, 2010). CHILDREN WITH ASTHMA MISS AN AVERAGE OF TWICE AS MANY SCHOOL DAYS AS OTHER CHILDREN (CENTERS FOR DISEASE CONTROL AND PREVENTION). MISSED SCHOOL DAYS BY CHILDREN RESULT IN MISSED WORKED DAYS BY ADULTS - SO THERE ARE BOTH SIGNIFICANT FINANCIAL AND QUALITY OF LIFE IMPLICATIONS FOR CHILDREN WITH ASTHMA AND THEIR FAMILIES. THE BURDEN OF ASTHMA IN ILLINOIS MIRRORS NATIONAL TRENDS YET ILLINOIS HAS ONE OF THE HIGHEST ASTHMA MORTALITY AND MORBIDITY RATES IN THE NATION, AND IT CONTINUES TO INCREASE EACH YEAR (ILLINOIS DEPARTMENT OF PUBLIC HEALTH, 2006). THE MAJORITY OF THE STATE'S ASTHMA DEATHS OCCUR IN COOK COUNTY (CHICAGO AND SUBURBAN COOK COUNTY), THE COUNTY IN WHICH SOUTH SUBURBAN HOSPITAL IS LOCATED. SOUTH SUBURBAN HOSPITAL HAS BOTH THE RESOURCES AND CAPACITY TO PARTNER WITH OTHER ORGANIZATIONS ENGAGED IN ADDRESSING ASTHMA. HISTORICALLY, SOUTH SUBURBAN HOSPITAL HAS DEVELOPED COMMUNITY PROGRAMS IMPACTING ASTHMA. THE HOSPITAL IS CURRENTLY CONDUCTING OUTREACH ACTIVITIES AIMED AT SCHOOLS AND CHURCHES TO ADDRESS THIS DISEASE, INCLUDING THE MOST RECENT DEVELOPMENT OF THE KICKIN' ASTHMA PROGRAM, A SCHOOL-BASED CURRICULUM THAT ADDRESSES THE NEEDS OF CHILDREN AGES 11 TO 16 WITH ASTHMA. THE PROGRAM PROMOTES INDIVIDUAL RESPONSIBILITY, SELF-MANAGEMENT AND EARLY ACTION AMONG ADOLESCENTS. THE OVERALL GOAL OF KICKIN' ASTHMA IS TO IMPROVE ASTHMA MANAGEMENT AND DECREASE ACUTE CARE UTILIZATION AMONG CHILDREN AGES 11 TO 16. IN ADDITION TO THE SCHOOL-BASED CURRICULUM, CONTINUING MEDICAL EDUCATION FOR LOCAL SCHOOL NURSES, PEDIATRIC HEALTH FAIRS, SCHOOL PROGRAMS PROVIDING ASTHMA SCREENINGS, EDUCATIONAL MATERIALS AND PEAK FLOW METERS, AND ASTHMA RESOURCE PACKETS INCLUDING EDUCATIONAL MATERIALS AND A RESOURCE DIRECTORY FOR LOCAL FAITH COMMUNITIES CONTRIBUTE TO THE PROGRAM'S EFFECTIVENESS AND HAVE HELPED TO LAY THE FOUNDATION FOR THE HOSPITAL'S EXPANSION OF INTERVENTIONS TO ADDRESS ASTHMA IN THE COMMUNITY. ADVOCATE SOUTH SUBURBAN HOSPITAL DEVELOPED AN ASTHMA ACTION TASK FORCE TO ADDRESS THE FOLLOWING COMMUNITIES, GOALS AND OBJECTIVES: TARGET POPULATION: CHILDREN AGES 5-17 THAT RESIDE IN THE PRIMARY SERVICE AREA OF ADVOCATE SOUTH SUBURBAN HOSPITAL (ASSH) WHICH INCLUDES BUT IS NOT LIMITED TO THE FOLLOWING ZIP CODES: 60429 CALUMET CITY; 60411 CHICAGO HEIGHTS/FORD HEIGHTS; 60419 DOLTON; 60422 FLOSSMOOR; 60423 FRANKFORT; 60425 GLENWOOD; 60426 HARVEY; 60428 MARKHAM; 60429 HAZEL CREST; 60430 HOMEWOOD; 60438 LANSING; 60443 MATTESON; 60445 MIDLOTHIAN; 60452 OAK FOREST; 60461 OLYMPIA FIELDS; 60466 PARK FOREST; 60471 RICHTON PARK; AND 60473 SOUTH HOLLAND. GOAL: TO DECREASE ASTHMA RELATED EMERGENCY DEPARTMENT VISITS AND/OR HOSPITALIZATIONS OF CHILDREN AGES 5-17 THAT RESIDE WITHIN ADVOCATE SOUTH SUBURBAN HOSPITAL'S PRIMARY SERVICE AREA BY DEVELOPING AND IMPLEMENTING PROGRAMS TO INCREASE THE KNOWLEDGE BASE OF THE PEDIATRIC ASTHMA COMMUNITY TO INCLUDE ASTHMA MANAGEMENT SKILLS, TRIGGER IDENTIFICATION, AND THERAPEUTIC AND SOCIAL INTERVENTIONS THAT WILL REDUCE ASTHMA RELATED COMPLICATIONS WHILE ESTABLISHING SELF-ADVOCACY SKILLS AND ULTIMATELY CREATING A BETTER QUALITY OF LIFE FOR THOSE THE HOSPITAL SERVES. OBJECTIVES OF THE PROGRAM INCLUDE: 1.

EXISTING COMMUNITY PROGRAMS AND RESOURCES PROVIDED BY SOUTH SUBURBAN HOSPITAL INCLUDE A CARDIAC REHABILITATION PROGRAM; VARIOUS CARDIOVASCULAR EDUCATION AND PREVENTION PROGRAMS, INCLUDING PROVISION OF HEART RISK ASSESSMENTS; A DIABETES WELLNESS PROGRAM INCLUDING SELF-MANAGEMENT EDUCATION; SELECTED HEALTH SCREENINGS; CANCER HEALTH PREVENTION EDUCATION AND CANCER SUPPORT SERVICES. THERE ARE A NUMBER OF LOCAL NONPROFIT ORGANIZATIONS CURRENTLY OFFERING RESOURCES TO ADDRESS THE HEALTH ISSUES OF TEEN PREGNANCY AND SEXUALLY TRANSMITTED DISEASES IN SOUTH SUBURBAN HOSPITAL'S PRIMARY SERVICE AREA. THESE COMMUNITY-BASED HEALTHCARE CLINICS AND CENTERS OFFER PRIMARY CARE SERVICES, INCLUDING FAMILY MEDICINE AND OB/GYN PHYSICIANS, AS WELL AS COUNSELING AND EDUCATION AIMED AT CURBING RATES OF TEEN BIRTH AND STD INFECTION RATES WITHIN THE TARGETED COMMUNITIES. TO BEST SERVE THOSE PATIENTS MOST IN NEED OF THEIR SERVICES, THESE PROVIDERS OFFER FREE AND/OR DISCOUNTED ACCESS TO UNINSURED AND UNDERINSURED PATIENTS.

ADVOCATE BROMENN MEDICAL CENTER SIGNIFICANT NEEDS BEING ADDRESSED BROMENN MEDICAL CENTER'S COMMUNITY HEALTH COUNCIL SELECTED MENTAL HEALTH AND OBESITY AS ITS TOP HEALTH PRIORITIES TO ADDRESS FOR THE 2011-2013 CHNA CYCLE. MENTAL HEALTH BROMENN MEDICAL CENTER MAKES SIGNIFICANT CONTRIBUTIONS TO ADDRESS THE ISSUE OF MENTAL HEALTH IN THE COMMUNITY. SINCE 2012, BROMENN MEDICAL CENTER HAS HAD TWO STAFF MEMBERS SERVING ON THE MCLEAN COUNTY PUBLIC HEALTH DEPARTMENT'S IPLAN MENTAL HEALTH TASK FORCE. HISTORICALLY, BROMENN MEDICAL CENTER DID NOT HAVE A CRISIS ADMISSIONS COUNSELOR IN THE EMERGENCY ROOM. IN RESPONSE TO CUTS IN STATE AND COMMUNITY FUNDING FOR MENTAL HEALTH, THE HOSPITAL IDENTIFIED AN INCREASED WAIT TIME FOR THE PSYCHIATRIC PATIENT TO BE SEEN BY THE ON-CALL COMMUNITY CRISIS SCREENING COUNSELOR. TO ADDRESS THIS ISSUE AND AT ITS OWN EXPENSE, BROMENN MEDICAL CENTER INVESTED IN HIRING A CRISIS ADMISSIONS COUNSELOR IN 2010. THIS STAFF MEMBER PROVIDES ASSESSMENTS IN THE EMERGENCY DEPARTMENT FROM 10:00 AM TO 6:30 PM, MONDAY THROUGH FRIDAY. ADDITIONALLY, THE INPATIENT MENTAL HEALTH UNIT AT BROMENN MEDICAL CENTER IS THE ONLY ONE OF ITS KIND IN MCLEAN COUNTY, PROVIDING CRITICAL SERVICES TO THOSE ADULTS NEEDING INPATIENT PSYCHIATRIC SERVICES. THE UNIT OPERATED AT AN ANNUAL LOSS OF $1,454,727, $1,786,254 AND $1,868,405 RESPECTIVELY IN 2012, 2013 AND 2014. BROMENN MEDICAL CENTER, IN PARTNERSHIP WITH ITS DELEGATE CHURCHES AND THE MCLEAN COUNTY MENTAL HEALTH COURT, ALSO PARTICIPATES IN A PROGRAM TITLED PARTNERS IN HELPING. THIS PROGRAM PROVIDES SUPPORT TO THE COURT FOR THEIR EFFORTS TOWARDS REHABILITATING INDIVIDUALS WITH MENTAL HEALTH CONDITIONS WHO ENTER THE CRIMINAL JUSTICE SYSTEM AS AN ALTERNATIVE TO INCARCERATION. DELEGATE CONGREGATIONS COLLECT INCENTIVE ITEMS, SUCH AS GIFT CARDS TO LOCAL RESTAURANTS, WHICH ARE DESIGNATED BY THE COURT FOR PARTICIPANTS IN THE PROGRAM. DONATIONS GIVEN TO THE COURT ARE USED TO INCENTIVIZE PROGRESS AND COMPLIANCE. IN ITS CONTINUED EFFORTS TO ADDRESS MENTAL HEALTH IN MCLEAN COUNTY, BROMENN MEDICAL CENTER'S SERVICE AREA ADMINISTRATOR FOR BEHAVIORAL HEALTH SERVICES SERVES AS VICE PRESIDENT OF THE BOARD FOR THE MCLEAN COUNTY MENTAL HEALTH COURT PROGRAM, WHICH IS AIMED AT KEEPING INDIVIDUALS WITH MENTAL HEALTH ISSUES OUT OF PRISON. THIS ADMINISTRATOR ALSO SERVED ON A COUNTY BOARD MENTAL HEALTH ADVISORY PANEL FOR SEVERAL MONTHS. THE ADVISORY PANEL WAS TASKED WITH: 1) COMPLETING A MENTAL HEALTH SERVICES NEEDS GAP ASSESSMENT; AND 2) IDENTIFYING THE BEST EVIDENCE-BASED PRACTICE FOR CARE OF THE MENTALLY ILL. THE ADMINISTRATOR ALSO SERVED AND CONTINUES TO SERVE ON A SECOND TASK FORCE/PANEL WHICH RECOMMENDED MCLEAN COUNTY OPEN A CRISIS STABILIZATION UNIT. THE UNIT IS NOW OPEN FOR COMMUNITY MEMBERS TO UTILIZE. AS OUTLINED IN THE CHNA IMPLEMENTATION PLAN FOR MENTAL HEALTH, IN JUNE OF 2014, THE HOSPITAL OFFERED AN EVIDENCE-BASED MENTAL HEALTH PROGRAM TO THE COMMUNITY ENTITLED MENTAL HEALTH FIRST AID. MENTAL HEALTH FIRST AID IS A NATIONALLY RECOGNIZED ADULT PUBLIC EDUCATION PROGRAM THAT TEACHES INDIVIDUALS HOW TO IDENTIFY, UNDERSTAND AND RESPOND TO THE SIGNS OF MENTAL ILLNESS AND SUBSTANCE ABUSE DISORDERS. CERTIFIED INSTRUCTORS TEACH PARTICIPANTS TO BECOME MENTAL HEALTH FIRST AIDERS. PARTICIPANTS LEARN ABOUT THE SIGNS AND SYMPTOMS OF ACUTE MENTAL HEALTH CRISES AND CHRONIC MENTAL HEALTH PROBLEMS, SUCH AS ANXIETY AND DEPRESSION. BROMENN MEDICAL CENTER HAS COLLABORATED WITH THE MCLEAN COUNTY CENTER FOR HUMAN SERVICES AND THE MCLEAN COUNTY HEALTH DEPARTMENT IN OFFERING THIS PROGRAM TO THE COMMUNITY. TO DATE, 370 COMMUNITY MEMBERS FROM MCLEAN AND WOODFORD COUNTY HAVE BEEN TRAINED IN MENTAL HEALTH FIRST AID. AS A RESULT OF THIS COLLABORATION, THE HEALTH DEPARTMENT HAS RECEIVED A GRANT FROM THE ILLINOIS PRAIRIE COMMUNITY FOUNDATION THAT ALLOWS THE COLLABORATIVE TO OFFER THE MENTAL HEALTH FIRST AID CLASSES TO THE COMMUNITY FOR $10, MAKING CLASSES AFFORDABLE TO ALL MEMBERS OF THE COMMUNITY."
201533179349304323,362169147,OBESITY,"ADVOCATE BROMENN MEDICAL CENTER (ABMC) IS PARTNERING WITH RIDGEVIEW COMMUNITY UNIT SCHOOL DISTRICT (CUSD) #19 IN COLFAX, ILLINOIS, TO ADDRESS OBESITY THROUGH IMPLEMENTATION OF THE EVIDENCE-BASED PHYSICAL EDUCATION PROGRAM SPARK. APPROXIMATELY ONE HUNDRED 6TH AND 7TH GRADE STUDENTS WILL BE ENGAGED IN SPARK, WHICH HAS BEEN COUNTERING CHILDHOOD OBESITY IN SCHOOLS SINCE 1989. RIDGEVIEW P.E. TEACHERS RECEIVED PROFESSIONAL TRAINING, CURRICULUM AND EQUIPMENT FOR SPARK P.E. THROUGH THEIR PARTNERSHIP WITH THE MCLEAN COUNTY HEALTH DEPARTMENT AND THE ILLINOIS DEPARTMENT OF PUBLIC HEALTH'S WE CHOOSE HEALTH INITIATIVE (MADE POSSIBLE BY THE CENTERS FOR DISEASE CONTROL AND PREVENTION). TWO RIDGEVIEW PHYSICAL EDUCATION TEACHERS RECEIVED HANDS-ON TRAINING FOR SPARK P.E. AND BEGAN IMPLEMENTING THE CURRICULUM IN THE ELEMENTARY AND JUNIOR HIGH SCHOOL PHYSICAL EDUCATION CLASSES AT THE BEGINNING OF THE 2014-2015 SCHOOL YEAR. ABMC WILL ASSIST IN THE CONTINUATION OF THE COLLECTION OF BODY MASS INDEX (BMI) VALUES WHICH BEGAN FOR RIDGEVIEW LAST YEAR (2013-2014 SCHOOL YEAR) AS PART OF THE WE CHOOSE HEALTH INITIATIVE. THE WE CHOOSE HEALTH GRANT OFFICIALLY ENDED ON SEPTEMBER 29, 2014. POPULATION TREND BMI DATA WILL BE TRACKED AT THE 6TH AND 7TH GRADE LEVEL. ABMC WILL ALSO ASSIST WITH SPARK EDUCATIONAL EVENTS FOR THE CHILDREN AND THEIR FAMILIES. IN ADDITION, THE HOSPITAL DONATED FUNDS TO RIDGEVIEW CUSD #19 TOWARD THE PURCHASE OF 26 HEART RATE MONITORS FOR STUDENTS TO MEASURE THE INTENSITY OF CARDIOVASCULAR ACTIVITY DURING PHYSICAL EDUCATION CLASSES. THIS WILL ASSIST STUDENTS IN RECEIVING IMMEDIATE FEEDBACK ON EXERCISE AND THE HEALTH BENEFITS OF EXERCISING IN DIFFERENT HEART RATE ZONES. THE ADDITION OF THE HEART RATE MONITORS TO THE PHYSICAL EDUCATION CLASSES HAS BEEN VERY POPULAR AND MOTIVATING TO THE STUDENTS. DIRECTLY RELATED TO DECREASING OBESITY RATES IN THE COMMUNITY, THE COMMUNITY HEALTH LEADER FOR BROMENN MEDICAL CENTER SERVES ON THE MCLEAN COUNTY WELLNESS COALITION AND LEADERSHIP COMMITTEE, A GROUP COMPRISED OF CAMPUS AND COMMUNITY ORGANIZATIONS WORKING TO PROMOTE HEALTHY EATING AND ACTIVE LIVING. THE COALITION HAS BEEN IN PLACE SINCE 2011 AND PROMOTES THE ADOPTION OF HEALTHY LIFESTYLE POLICIES, SYSTEMS AND ENVIRONMENTAL (PSE) CHANGES. THE COALITION HAS HAD MANY SUCCESSES WITH 17 PSE'S DEVELOPED THROUGHOUT MCLEAN COUNTY IN 2013 AND 2014. SOME EXAMPLES INCLUDE COMMUNITY GARDENS AND THE ENHANCED P.E. PROGRAM, SPARK, MENTIONED ABOVE. BROMENN MEDICAL CENTER ALSO PARTNERED WITH THE YMCA ON THEIR YOUTH FITNESS INTERVENTION PROGRAM (Y-FI). Y-FI IS A PROGRAM TO HELP REDUCE THE NUMBER OF OVERWEIGHT AND OBESE CHILDREN THROUGH PHYSICAL ACTIVITY, EDUCATION AND NUTRITION. YOUTHS ARE REFERRED TO THE PROGRAM BY THEIR PHYSICIANS. PARENTS ARE ALSO INVOLVED IN THE PROGRAM AND EXERCISE ALONG WITH THEIR CHILD. SINCE THE INCEPTION OF THE Y-FI PROGRAM IN SEPTEMBER 2012, 153 CHILDREN/PARENT(S) HAVE BEEN REFERRED TO THE PROGRAM BY BOTH ADVOCATE MEDICAL GROUP AND OTHER PEDIATRIC PHYSICIANS IN MCLEAN COUNTY, AND 142 CHILDREN AND THEIR PARENT(S) HAVE PARTICIPATED IN THE 16-WEEK Y-FI PROGRAM. PARENTS AND CHILDREN SHOWED AN 85 PERCENT INCREASE IN PHYSICAL ACTIVITY AND AN 85 PERCENT INCREASE IN NUTRITION AND EXERCISE KNOWLEDGE ACCORDING TO THE PRE AND POST-PROGRAM SURVEY RESULTS. TWO HEALTH FAIRS WITH A HEALTH SCREENING WERE HELD AT THE YMCA INSTEAD OF AT BROMENN MEDICAL CENTER COMMUNITY WELLNESS TO MAKE THE EVENT MORE EASILY ACCESSIBLE BY THE Y-FI PARTICIPANTS. THE FIRST EVENT HELD ON MAY 29, 2014, WAS VERY SUCCESSFUL WITH 29 PARENTS AND CHILDREN PARTICIPATING. THE SECOND EVENT ON AUGUST 7, 2014, HAD 0 PEOPLE IN ATTENDANCE. THE YMCA FELT THIS MIGHT HAVE BEEN DUE TO SCHOOL REGISTRATIONS OCCURRING DURING THIS TIME. THE BROMENN MEDICAL CENTER AND YMCA PARTNERSHIP ENDED IN DECEMBER 2014. THIS ALLOWED ABMC TO COLLABORATE WITH RIDGEVIEW COMMUNITY UNIT SCHOOL DISTRICT (CUSD) #19, ON THE SPARK PROGRAM, THUS REACHING A LARGER NUMBER OF CHILDREN TO MORE BROADLY IMPACT CHILDHOOD OBESITY. IN THE FIGHT AGAINST OBESITY, BROMENN MEDICAL CENTER IS ALSO PARTNERING WITH THE COMMUNITY HEALTH CARE CLINIC. OBESITY INCREASES THE RISK OF DIABETES AND IMPACTS THE CONTROL OF IT. ACCORDING TO THE MCLEAN COUNTY IPLAN 2012-2017, 61.5 PERCENT OF THE COUNTY'S ADULTS ARE OVERWEIGHT OR OBESE. IN 2013 AND 2014, BROMENN MEDICAL CENTER OFFERED 3 EXCLUSIVE FOUR-WEEK GROUP DIABETES EDUCATION CLASSES TO COMMUNITY HEALTHCARE CLINIC DIABETES PATIENTS -- SPECIFICALLY PATIENTS WITH HBA1C'S GREATER THAN 9 AND BMI'S GREATER THAN 30. EIGHT CLINIC PATIENTS TOOK ADVANTAGE OF THIS OPPORTUNITY. A STAFF MEMBER OF THE CLINIC ATTENDED THE CLASS TO INCREASE COMPLIANCE AND ASSIST WITH SPANISH SPEAKING PATIENTS WHEN NEEDED. OUTCOMES MEASURED OVER TIME INCLUDE HBA1C VALUES, BODY MASS INDEX, AND A PRE AND POST-SURVEY OF KNOWLEDGE ASCERTAINED. AT THE SIX MONTH FOLLOW-UP APPOINTMENT, 33 PERCENT OF PATIENTS HBA1C DECREASED, 33 PERCENT OF PATIENTS HBA1C INCREASED AND 33 PERCENT OF PATIENTS OPTED NOT TO RETEST. THERE WAS NO CHANGE IN BMI FOR ANY OF THE PATIENTS. OF THE PATIENTS THAT TOOK BOTH THE PRE AND POST DIABETES SELF-MANAGEMENT CLASS SURVEY, THE AVERAGE IMPROVEMENT WAS 25 PERCENT. DUE TO LOW PARTICIPATION IN THE CLASSES, CLINIC PATIENTS ARE NOW PROVIDED WITH AN OPPORTUNITY TO MEET INDIVIDUALLY WITH DIABETES EDUCATORS AT BROMENN MEDICAL CENTER OR TO ATTEND ALREADY ESTABLISHED GROUP CLASSES AT THE HOSPITAL. BROMENN MEDICAL CENTER OFFERS EXERCISE CLASSES, SCREENINGS, HEALTH EDUCATION PRESENTATIONS AND EVENTS TO THE COMMUNITY ON A RANGE OF TOPICS PERTINENT TO OVERALL PHYSICAL AND MENTAL HEALTH, AND HEALTHY LIFESTYLE CHANGES. IN 2014, APPROXIMATELY 230 COMMUNITY MEMBERS PER WEEK PARTICIPATED IN THE 18 YOGA, ZUMBA, BONE BUILDERS AND PILATES CLASSES OFFERED AT THE HOSPITAL. NEEDS NOT BEING ADDRESSED ABMC DID NOT SELECT ORAL HEALTH, HEART DISEASE, CANCER OR LOW BIRTH WEIGHT AS KEY HEALTH ISSUES FOR THE REASONS IDENTIFIED BELOW. ORAL HEALTH ORAL HEALTH IS AN ISSUE FOR WHICH THE HOSPITAL HAS A LIMITED SPHERE OF INFLUENCE. BROMENN MEDICAL CENTER DOES NOT HAVE DENTAL RESIDENTS OR A MOBILE DENTAL VAN, BOTH OF WHICH COULD BE KEY COMPONENTS OF A SUCCESSFUL INTERVENTION. HOWEVER, THE EXISTING COLLABORATION WITH THE MCLEAN COUNTY PUBLIC HEALTH DEPARTMENT, THE HOSPITAL'S DELEGATE CHURCHES, LOCAL PRIMARY CARE PHYSICIANS, AREA DENTISTS AND THE COMMUNITY HEALTH CARE CLINIC MAY LESSEN THE ORAL HEALTH BURDEN IN THE COMMUNITY. ALTHOUGH ORAL HEALTH IS NOT ONE OF THE SELECTED KEY HEALTH PRIORITIES, BROMENN MEDICAL CENTER COLLABORATES WITH EIGHT OF ITS DELEGATE CHURCHES TO ASSIST THE COMMUNITY WITH ITS ORAL HEALTH NEEDS. A PROGRAM CALLED PARTNERS IN SMILING WAS CREATED IN 2012. THE PROGRAM CONSISTS OF DELEGATE CHURCHES COLLECTING DENTAL HYGIENE SUPPLIES. BROMENN MEDICAL CENTER DELIVERS THE SUPPLIES TO THE MCLEAN COUNTY PUBLIC HEALTH DEPARTMENT OR THE JOHN SCOTT HEALTH CLINIC WHERE THEY ARE GIVEN TO INDIVIDUALS IN NEED. SINCE ITS INCEPTION, APPROXIMATELY $4,350 IN DENTAL HYGIENE SUPPLIES HAVE BEEN COLLECTED AND DISTRIBUTED TO INDIVIDUALS IN NEED IN MCLEAN COUNTY. BROMENN MEDICAL CENTER'S LEADERSHIP HAS ALSO MET ON SEVERAL OCCASIONS WITH THE MCLEAN COUNTY PUBLIC HEALTH DEPARTMENT, AND LOCAL DENTISTS AND ORAL SURGEONS TO DISCUSS THE ISSUE OF ACCESS TO DENTAL CARE FOR UNINSURED ADULTS IN MCLEAN COUNTY. ADDITIONALLY, THE HOSPITAL HAS HAD TWO STAFF MEMBERS SERVING ON THE MCLEAN COUNTY PUBLIC HEALTH DEPARTMENT'S IPLAN ORAL HEALTH TASK FORCE SINCE 2012. IN 2014, ABMC'S FAMILY HEALTH CARE CLINIC BEGAN EXPLORING THE POSSIBILITY OF ADDING A DENTAL RESIDENCY PROGRAM IN CONJUNCTION WITH THE COMMUNITY HEALTH CARE CLINIC. HEART DISEASE AND CANCER DESPITE THEIR PERVASIVENESS, HEART DISEASE AND CANCER WERE NOT SELECTED AS KEY HEALTH ISSUES. BROMENN MEDICAL CENTER'S COMMUNITY HEALTH COUNCIL DETERMINED THAT SIGNIFICANT RESOURCES ARE ALREADY DEVOTED TO BOTH OF THESE ISSUES. IN PARTICULAR, THE COMMUNITY HAS EXCELLENT RESOURCES IN BOTH THE COMMUNITY CANCER CENTER, WHICH IS A JOINT VENTURE BETWEEN BROMENN MEDICAL CENTER AND OSF SAINT JOSEPH'S MEDICAL CENTER. IN THE AREA OF HEART DISEASE, BROMENN MEDICAL CENTER SCREENED APPROXIMATELY 1,475 COMMUNITY MEMBERS FOR CHOLESTEROL, BLOOD PRESSURE, PERIPHERAL ARTERY DISEASE AND/OR PERCENT OF BODY FAT IN 2013, AND 1,050 COMMUNITY MEMBERS IN 2014. IN ADDITION, APPROXIMATELY 2,275 HIGH SCHOOL STUDENTS WERE SCREENED THROUGH ADVOCATE FOR YOUNG HEARTS IN 2013 AND AN ADDITIONAL 482 IN 2014. ADVOCATE FOR YOUNG HEARTS PROGRAM SCREENS LOCAL HIGH SCHOOL STUDENTS AT NO COST FOR UNIDENTIFIED GENETIC DISORDERS THAT PLACE THEM AT HIGH RISK FOR SUDDEN CARDIAC DEATH. LOW BIRTH WEIGHT INFANTS ALTHOUGH, LOW BIRTH WEIGHT WAS IDENTIFIED AS A HEALTH ISSUE IN MCLEAN COUNTY DATA, ABMC DID NOT SELECT IT AS A SIGNIFICANT HEALTH NEED TO BE ADDRESSED. THE HOSPITAL HAS TAKEN STEPS TO ADDRESS THE ISSUE, HOWEVER, DUE TO THE FACT THAT THE PERCENT OF ELECTIVE INDUCTIONS WAS DEEMED TO BE HIGHER THAN WHAT WAS DEEMED ACCEPTABLE TO THE HOSPITAL.

COMMUNITY OUTREACH PROGRAMS FOR THE EARLY DETECTION OF CANCER INCLUDE THE LADIES NIGHT THINK PINK EVENT FOR BREAST CANCER PREVENTION EDUCATION AND THE COLON CANCER SCREENING PROGRAM IN COLLABORATION WITH THE AMERICAN CANCER SOCIETY. THE ONCOLOGY CENTER'S PROGRAMS ARE STRUCTURED TO FACILITATE A MULTIDISCIPLINARY ENVIRONMENT WHILE PROVIDING MINIMALLY INVASIVE PROCEDURES AND ADVANCED SURGICAL INTERVENTION TO TREAT CANCER. THE ONCOLOGY CENTER INCLUDES ADVANCED DIAGNOSTICS, IMAGING SERVICES, INTERVENTIONAL RADIOLOGY AND AN INFUSION CENTER. ACCIDENTS TRINITY HOSPITAL IMPLEMENTS VARIOUS ACTIVITIES THAT AID IN EDUCATING THE COMMUNITY REGARDING SAFETY AND HOW TO PREVENT ACCIDENTS WITHIN THE SENIOR POPULATION SERVED BY THE HOSPITAL. THESE ACTIVITIES INCLUDE EDUCATION FOR SAFE DRIVING AND INJURY/FALLS PREVENTION. THE HOSPITAL PARTNERS WITH THE AMERICAN ASSOCIATION OF RETIRED PERSONS (AARP) TO PROVIDE QUARTERLY WORKSHOPS ON DRIVER SAFETY TO EDUCATE SENIORS ON SAFE AND DEFENSIVE DRIVING TECHNIQUES. ADDITIONALLY, THE HOSPITAL UTILIZES ADVANCE PRACTICE NURSES TO PROVIDE COMMUNITY EDUCATION TO PREVENT FALLS AND INJURY IN THE HOME. HOMICIDE TRINITY HOSPITAL CONTINUALLY ASSESSES WHETHER ADDITIONAL PREVENTION STRATEGIES ARE NEEDED WITHIN THE COMMUNITY AND WORKS IN SUPPORT OF ITS COMMUNITY PARTNERS TO ADDRESS NEEDS SUCH AS ACCIDENTS AND HOMICIDE. COMMUNITY PARTNERS SPECIFICALLY ADDRESSING THESE NEEDS INCLUDE ORGANIZATIONS SUCH AS THE NEIGHBORHOOD CHICAGO ALTERNATIVE POLICING STRATEGY (CAPS), CHICAGO POLICE DEPARTMENT. THE POLICE DEPARTMENT IS WORKING WITHIN THE COMMUNITY TO ADDRESS THESE NEEDS AND TRINITY HOSPITAL PARTNERS WITH THEM TO SUPPORT THEIR ACTIVITIES SUCH AS THE NATIONAL NIGHT OUT EVENT. THE NATIONAL NIGHT OUT EVENT IS DESIGNED TO INCREASE AWARENESS ABOUT POLICE AND COMMUNITY PARTNERSHIPS OR PROGRAMS THAT EDUCATE COMMUNITIES REGARDING VIOLENCE PREVENTION, DRUG PREVENTION, TOWN WATCH, NEIGHBORHOOD WATCH AND OTHER ANTI-CRIME EFFORTS. ADVOCATE EUREKA HOSPITAL SIGNIFICANT NEED BEING ADDRESSED MENTAL HEALTH MENTAL HEALTH WAS CHOSEN AS A KEY HEALTH PRIORITY BY EUREKA HOSPITAL FOR THE 2011-2013 CHNA FOR SEVERAL REASONS. FIRST, ACCESS TO MENTAL HEALTH SERVICES IN WOODFORD COUNTY IS SEVERELY LIMITED DUE TO THE CLOSURE OF THE TAZWOOD MENTAL HEALTH CENTER SATELLITE FACILITY IN EUREKA IN 2009, THUS CAUSING RESIDENTS TO LEAVE THE COUNTY TO FIND MENTAL HEALTH CARE. SECONDLY, A STRONG CONSIDERATION WAS THE PARTNERSHIP WITH THE WOODFORD COUNTY HEALTH DEPARTMENT AND THE TAZWOOD MENTAL HEALTH CENTER. FINALLY, THE RESULTS OF THE 2011 ILLINOIS PROJECT FOR LOCAL ASSESSMENT OF NEED (IPLAN) COMMUNITY HEALTH PLAN AND NEED ASSESSMENT FOR WOODFORD COUNTY SHOW A GROWING NEED FOR MENTAL HEALTH SERVICES IN WOODFORD COUNTY. AS OUTLINED IN THE CHNA IMPLEMENTATION PLAN FOR MENTAL HEALTH, IN JUNE OF 2014, ADVOCATE BROMENN MEDICAL CENTER, IN PARTNERSHIP WITH ADVOCATE EUREKA HOSPITAL, OFFERED AN EVIDENCE-BASED MENTAL HEALTH PROGRAM TO THE COMMUNITY ENTITLED MENTAL HEALTH FIRST AID. MENTAL HEALTH FIRST AID IS A NATIONALLY RECOGNIZED ADULT PUBLIC EDUCATION PROGRAM THAT TEACHES INDIVIDUALS HOW TO IDENTIFY, UNDERSTAND AND RESPOND TO THE SIGNS OF MENTAL ILLNESS AND SUBSTANCE ABUSE DISORDERS. CERTIFIED INSTRUCTORS TEACH PARTICIPANTS TO BECOME MENTAL HEALTH FIRST AIDERS. PARTICIPANTS LEARN ABOUT THE SIGNS AND SYMPTOMS OF ACUTE MENTAL HEALTH CRISES AND CHRONIC MENTAL HEALTH PROBLEMS, SUCH AS ANXIETY AND DEPRESSION. EUREKA HOSPITAL HAS COLLABORATED WITH BROMENN MEDICAL CENTER, THE WOODFORD COUNTY HEALTH DEPARTMENT, THE MCLEAN COUNTY CENTER FOR HUMAN SERVICES AND THE MCLEAN COUNTY HEALTH DEPARTMENT IN OFFERING THIS PROGRAM TO THE COMMUNITY. TO DATE, 370 COMMUNITY MEMBERS FROM MCLEAN AND WOODFORD COUNTIES HAVE BEEN TRAINED IN MENTAL HEALTH FIRST AID. THE OUTCOMES MEASURED FOR ACCESS TO MENTAL HEALTH SERVICES INCLUDE THE NUMBER OF PATIENTS VISITING THE EUREKA HOSPITAL EMERGENCY ROOM WITH A BEHAVIORAL HEALTH RELATED DIAGNOSIS. THIS NUMBER HAS STEADILY DECREASED FROM 2010 TO 2013, FROM 78 PATIENTS IN 2010 TO 49 PATIENTS IN 2013. IN 2014, THE NUMBER OF PATIENTS INCREASED TO 59; HOWEVER, THIS IS STILL LOWER THAN THE BASELINE OF 78 PATIENTS IN 2010. POSITIVELY CONTRIBUTING TO THIS DECREASE IS THE COLLABORATION BETWEEN EUREKA HOSPITAL, THE WOODFORD COUNTY HEALTH DEPARTMENT AND THE TAZWOOD WELLNESS CENTER. PARTICIPANTS FROM THESE ENTITIES AND OTHER COMMUNITY ORGANIZATIONS FORM THE WOODFORD COUNTY HEALTH DEPARTMENT IPLAN MENTAL HEALTH SUBCOMMITTEE. AS A RESULT OF THE SUBCOMMITTEE'S EFFORTS, BEGINNING IN JANUARY 2013, THE TAZWOOD WELLNESS CENTER STAFF OFFERED COUNSELING SERVICES ONE TIME PER WEEK AND PSYCHIATRIC SERVICES ONE TIME PER MONTH AT THE WOODFORD COUNTY HEALTH DEPARTMENT. TO ASSIST WITH REFERRALS TO THIS PROGRAM AND WITH EFFECTIVE COMMUNICATION, A EUREKA HOSPITAL SOCIAL WORKER COORDINATED EDUCATIONAL SESSIONS FOR LOCAL ADVOCATE MEDICAL GROUP PHYSICIANS AND THE MEDICAL STAFF SERVING EUREKA HOSPITAL'S EMERGENCY ROOM. THE HOSPITAL SOCIAL WORKER ALSO COORDINATED EDUCATIONAL SESSIONS FOR THE STAFF AT NURSING HOMES AND WITH WOODFORD COUNTY CLERGY AT DELEG"

This is accomplished through expanding provider participation, education, outreach and prevention activities/programs to promote healthy lifestyles and access to care (Phase 1) and creating a collaborative safety net organization for shared accountability to leverage and maximize complementary skills and capacity building (Phase 2). Currently, Phase 2 has shifted from creating an organization to integrating this type of care delivery into the community benefit services WellStar delivers at a health system-level across all hospitals. Progress ongoing in Phase 2: Strategy: Improve access to care to vulnerable populations - Strengthen collaborative partnerships with community stakeholders to increase access to preventative and primary care, improve quality and reduce costs. - Reduce preventable hospital admissions, re-admissions and Emergency Department visits by redirecting care to community clinics and primary care via the hospital-based care management program. - Increase the number of hospital-affiliated/WellStar Physicians Group primary care providers and specialists providing free or low-cost healthcare programs/clinics via a Graduate Medical Education program. (Commences in 2017) - Participate as a Cobb Access Health integrator/partner to build a low-income healthcare delivery system in Cobb County. (not being pursued as a separate entity, but as a part of community benefit services delivered by WellStar.) - Improve medication access through centralized reduced cost Pharmaceutical Patient Access Programs and the Federal 340B Drug Pricing Program for the management of chronic disease and to reduce complications. (Currently assessing the program) - Evaluate hospital-based subsidized health services to more effectively and efficiently allocate assets addressing prioritized needs of the medically underserved and uninsured. STRATEGY: Promote healthy lifestyles via preventative care, programs and activities - Engage faith-based organizations in coordination and provision of care (MEMPHIS Model). (Pilot to be conducted at WellStar Paulding Hospital.) - Expand free health screenings to the underserved and uninsured through WellStar Corporate & Community Health. - Provide at-risk, low income first time moms with care and education for healthy pregnancies via nurse home visiting program. (Not being pursued at this time.) - Collaborate with Cobb2020 Healthy Lifestyle initiatives (including physical activity, healthy eating, and obesity). - Provide community benefit leadership/consultation for the prevention and management of diabetes, cancer and cardiovascular disease. (Being delivered on a System-wide level.) - Increase cancer prevention and education community outreach (including smoking cessation program) utilizing WellStar Cancer Program team. (Underway) - Improve prevention-based educational resources and the referral process to free or low-cost healthcare clinics for continuity of care within the Emergency Department. UNADDRESSED CHNA NEEDS - Selection criteria for KENNESTONE HOSPITAL'S prioritized health needs were primarily based upon the bandwidth to build a sustainable community benefit model focused on preventable health behaviors and access to care. Sexually transmitted infections and teen pregnancy are not addressed leaving awareness education with schools, family and churches since the health needs are more cultural and societal. Improvement to health needs stemming from socioeconomic and physical environmental FACTORS such as air quality and transportation, gain traction from public policy and education. A health system can complement efforts to impact policy, but has to rely on public health, state and local municipalities and federal governmental agencies to drive these types of health improvements. Key questions when addressing health needs are: 1.) Do we have existing facilities and resources dedicated to the health needs showing clear disparities and poor performance? And, 2.) do we have effective and feasible interventions, a successful solution that has the potential to solve multiple problems, and the opportunity to intervene at the prevention level? Other needs not addressed are either beyond the scope or expertise of KENnESTONE Hospital, not being addressed at this time or are being addressed by WellStar on a system level or via other partners in public health."

201621339349303972,460224604,Avera Queen of Peace Hospital,"Part V, Section B, Line 11: Behavioral Health Services: Avera Queen of Peace has been involved with Avera Health in the establishment of Service Lines. The Service Line model is a systematic approach to integrating appropriate levels of care with system-wide resources. Regardless of a patient's geographical or clinical location and using existing resources within the system, the service line model insures patients have access to the care they need, where they need it. The model reduces unnecessary duplication of resources and increases opportunities to access services that would otherwise be unavailable in a facility or region due to limitations such as geography, utilization and affordability. Launched in 2012, Behavioral Health Services was the first Service Line established within Avera. The Behavioral Health Service Line Steering Team has identified long-term viability for support of a clinical psychologist and a psychiatrist within the Avera Queen of Peace Region. Avera Queen of Peace hired a clinical psychologist within a local Avera Medical Group primary care clinic in February 2014. Disease Prevention and Wellness: Avera Queen of Peace currently offers several educational and wellness initiatives to the community. These initiatives come in the form of support groups, fitness incentives, fitness classes, nutrition education, demonstrations (i.e. cooking demos), etc. While Avera Queen of Peace will continue to offer these programs, it will pursue additional partnering within the community, including deeper dialogue with public health agencies serving the area. The intention is to establish efficient and efficacious partnerships and programming that reaches those most in need, including youth and young adults. Avera Queen of Peace has developed strong partnerships with Dakota Wesleyan University, the Mitchell Recreation Center and Mitchell High School. The first activity has been to increase and organize the resources and programming across the community in the areas of athletic training, sports medicine and sports performance. One anticipated benefit of these partnerships is better utilization and less duplication of current resources.In January 2014 Avera Queen of Peace committed $2.5 million towards a joint-use sports and community wellness complex on the Dakota Wesleyan University Campus. Ground was broken for the Avera/DWU Sports and Wellness facility in September 2014 and is anticipated to be completed in February 2016.Primary Care Access: Avera Queen of Peace is actively recruiting both family practice and internal medicine physicians. To date a family practice physician, three emergency medicine physicians, a part-time pediatrician, and fellowship-trained sports medicine physician have begun practices. Fiscal year 2016 physician recruitments include two pediatricians, a urologist, a medical oncologist and two obstetrician/gynecologists. Fiscal year 2017 physician recruitments include an internal medicine physician, pediatrician and dermatologist.In August 2014, Avera Queen of Peace started construction of a 70,000 square foot medical office and outpatient building to house family medicine, internal medicine, pediatrics, general surgery, urology, dialysis, laboratory, radiology and dialysis services. The location of the clinic will be near Interstate 90 with easier access for patients travelling from outside the city limits. The facility will place many of Avera Medical Group practices under one roof, in a location that is more visible and accessible than current locations and nearer to a portion of the economically poor in the community. Construction of this facility is anticipated to be completed in March 2016.Items not being addressed:Adequate and Affordable housing: Avera Queen of Peace currently has representation on the Mitchell Development Corporation. The Mitchell Development Corporation is active in attracting investment in affordable housing.Affordable dental care: A mobile dental care clinic currently assists local dentists in providing free dental services to needy children. Our findings of patients who are unable to find a dentist with available appointments or willing to accept uninsured patients will be communicated with dentists. Affordable and reliable public transportation: The City of Mitchell currently operates a public transit system; additionally, a local company also provides transportation services. Our findings of wait times for transportation have been communicated with transportation providers."

Representation has included stakeholders from health and human services agencies, government entities, local businesses, community-based organizations, higher education institutions, and community members at-large. York Hospital, as an entity of WellSpan Health, partners to conduct the CHNA, disseminate its results, and integrate evidence-strategies that impact the identified needs into its annual planning process.

A key element of our strategy in addressing this need is to reach beyond simply informing patients about our patient assistance policies to proactively identifying patients without access and connecting them to available public and community programs. Outreach is evident through Community Health Workers and health coaches, who actively seek out patients and community members and focus on meeting them where they are, working through both medical and social needs. WellSpan also sponsors case managers within Healthy Community Network (HCN) to support patient enrollment in public programs (i.e., Medicaid), health insurance marketplace options or in its own HCN discounted care program, which is based on the charity care guidelines of health care providers. In this time of healthcare reform, Healthy Community Network focuses on communicating changes clearly to members and provides support in directing members to the health insurance marketplace and other resources. Finally, through a multi-year initiative to ensure awareness among all people who qualify for charity care and financial assistance, our website has been updated, our enrollment processes and late bill communications have been simplified, the provision and availability of financial support resources at high visibility care sites has improved, and our partnership with our local Federally Qualified Health Center (FQHC) for early identification and qualification of patients has been strengthened."

Mercy adopted implementation strategies for (1) Mercy Fort Smith hired an APN Patient Health Navigator to work in the Breast Center to customize educational needs to each patients unique circumstances, (2) Mercy Breast Cancer Committee serves as a governance body for excellence in Breast Center Services and (3) Mercy has expanded their mobile Mammography Van services into Oklahoma to improve access to screening. Mobile Mammography screening coverage will be expanded to churches, non-profits, rural venues and two identified areas of need in Oklahoma. The third identified need or priority is collaboration with community health care non-profits and schools to bolster education and service. (1) Mercy will strengthen their relationship with the Reynolds Cancer Support House (RCSH) through educating our co-workers and the community on the services and classes RCSH offers, (2) Mercy will work on growing that relationship through our Patient Health Navigator by collaborating with the RCSH to improve access to educational services, transportation needs, and preventative or follow-up medical care and (3) Due to the shortage of physicians in the communities Mercy Fort Smith, over the next 5 years, is actively recruiting 150 primary care physicians, mid-level providers and specialty care physicians to meet the needs of our communities. Mercy is also in the process of expanding primary care clinics to help improve continuity of care. Mercy Clinic will grow to 44 primary care providers with the development of new facilities in strategic locations, to include school based clinics in our rural service areas, throughout the community to help manage population health. For all of these identified needs and priorities, Mercy continues to work closely with its local public school systems, nonprofit organizations, the Chamber of Commerce, and public officials to ensure we are collaboratively addressing the needs of our community in a measurable way. Mercy is currently not addressing mental health due to the lack of mental health providers in the communities served."

FROM THE VARIOUS SETS OF DATA, FROM THE MULTIPLE COMMUNITY FORUMS, FROM THE CURRENT INITIATIVES ACTIVE AND NEW IN ROCHESTER, A LIST OF HEALTH NEEDS WAS ESTABLISHED. SOME OF THE PRIMARY NEEDS INCLUDE: - DECREASE CIGARETTE SMOKING AMONG ADULTS - DECREASE ADULT OBESITY - INCREASE HYPERTENSIVES WHO HAVE THEIR BLOOD PRESSURE IN CONTROL - DECREASE UNINTENDED PREGNANCY RATES - DECREASE STDS/STIS, ESPECIALLY CHLAMYDIA AND GONORRHEA RATES - IMPROVE MENTAL HEALTH AMONG ADULTS AND ADOLESCENTS THE COMMUNITY HEALTH IMPROVEMENT WORKGROUP CHOSE TO PRIORITIZE ""PREVENTING CHRONIC DISEASE"", WHICH CLEARLY INCLUDES THE TOP THREE BULLET POINTS.

ALTHOUGH MONROE COUNTY IS WORSE THAN THE STATE FOR PREVENTION AGENDA INDICATORS, THIS DIFFERENCE IS NOT SIGNIFICANT, SO MONROE COUNTY IS SOMEWHAT IN LINE WITH GOALS AND THE REST OF THE STATE.

In order to have meaningful input on community health needs, LG Health has selected health priorities. The priorities of focus for LG Health were determined by examining the number of lives impacted, quality of life years lost, community cost savings by avoiding the health issue, and ability to influence the health need. Upon review and discussion of the data, LG Health's Community Health Needs Assessment Task Force identified three key priorities: * Increase the number of people at a healthy weight * Reduce the use of tobacco * Improve mental health with a focus on depression and anxiety Obesity LG Health's strategic approach to healthy weight management is planned using national, state, and local data and engages community stakeholders to utilize evidenced-based best practices around policy, systems, and environmental changes. Implementation strategy framework and operational plan: to increase the number of adults and children maintaining a healthy weight in Lancaster County. The intermediate goals are to increase the number of individuals who are physically active and making healthy food choices. Interventions are targeted toward sectors where we live, work and play (schools, communities, and workplaces). Strategic initiatives within each sector are designed to increase awareness, educate individuals, promote behavior change, and implement policy and system changes to make the healthy choice the easy choice. Initiatives: * Seek earned media coverage, utilize social media networks and complete presentations to spread awareness regarding the obesity epidemic in Lancaster County. * Shift the Shapedown program from a Community Health and Wellness program (Community Benefit) to a Healthy Weight Management Center offering. * Healthy Beginnings Plus will continue to offer all current healthy weight programs. * Heightened focus on policy, system, environmental change strategies to prevent obesity across multiple sectors, thus programs targeted to the individual will be less of a priority and decrease in number of programs offered. * Identify LGHP practice educational resource needs, as it relates to screening patients for overweight and obesity. * Convene the school districts at least twice a year to share best practices and resources with the councils. * Continue efforts to engage the remaining four school districts in the county to become involved in school wellness council events. * Provide free technical assistance to schools that are interested in completing a School Health Index assessment. * Convene a School/Community Garden Workgroup, open to anyone looking for ways to start or enhance existing gardens. * Present education sessions to employers about the benefits of completing the CDC Worksite Health ScoreCard. * Maintain Baby Friendly Hospital Designation. Recertification due 2019. * Partner with the American Heart Association to promote school gardens. * Maintain or increase the percentage of women initiating breastfeeding at WBH. * Promote and coordinate community events, including Open Streets, Trails Day, and Food Day. * Participate in Lancaster Bikes! A Coalition for a Bicycle Friendly Lancaster, working to increase the number of bicyclists in the City of Lancaster. * Provide free walk audits in partnership with a local engineer to municipalities interested in making small changes to make their communities more walkable/bikeable. * Work with the Lancaster County Planning Commission to increase the number of municipalities with Complete Streets policy elements. * Complete a policy scan in 2016. * Partner with the Lancaster County Planning Commission to present Places 2040, a community driven, comprehensive a comprehensive plan and vision for how should Lancaster County to look and feel in 2040. Tobacco Lancaster General Health was a founding member of the Tobacco Free Coalition in 2002. Members represent all sectors of the community and assist Lancaster General Health in developing and implementing evidenced based programs, mirroring The PA Department of Health's Division of Tobacco Prevention and Control's strategic plan for all of Pennsylvania. This plan was designed to be a guideline at the local level to implement comprehensive evidenced based programs, improve health equity, and strengthen tobacco control policies. Lancaster General Health aims to significantly decrease tobacco-related morbidity, mortality, and economic costs incurred from tobacco use by preventing youth from using, providing cessation and eliminating second hand smoke exposure. Initiatives: * Increase outpatient TDT participant engagement through 4 or more individual counseling or group sessions. * Continue to educate healthcare providers to increase referrals of patients to outpatient tobacco dependence treatment program. * Promote TDT services to non-LGH practices and other community members (businesses, individuals, multi-unit housing, etc). * Target areas of Lancaster County that are currently underserved as it relates to TDT programs. * Align tobacco scorecard data with LGHP tobacco scorecard data. * Provide continuing education and ensure competency for counselors who facilitate tobacco dependence treatment programs. * Promote weekly quit tip email to TDT participants during program sessions. * Maintain 3 tobacco awareness campaigns annually. * Develop promotional materials related to other tobacco products including, e-cigarettes, smokeless tobacco, hookah, and vaping. * Continued collaboration between Tobacco Dependence Treatment Counselors and HBP smoking cessation committee to keep staff updated on current TDT trends. * Continue promotion and facilitation of LifeSkills in schools. * Provide technical assistance to local businesses that express interest in adopting tobacco free policies * Continue collaboration with local schools and regional tobacco free coalition to increase number of youth educated and engaged in tobacco control efforts in Lancaster County. * Engage and educate residents to encourage their municipal leaders to adopt Young Lungs at Play (YLAP). * Continue to follow up with municipalities that have not yet adopted a Young Lungs at Play (YLAP) policy. * Continue to pursue discussions with the Lancaster City Housing Authority to pass a smoke-free multi-unit housing policy. This adoption will affect 396 families in our community. * Identify additional multi-unit housing properties (public and private) to adopt smoke-free policies."
201601279349300300,231365353,"Schedule H, Part V, Section B, Line 11 Facility A, 2","Facility A, 2 - Facility A. Mental Health This is the first year LG Health has selected mental health as a key health priority. Public health initiatives and mental health initiatives in general are disjointed. Without coordination, only the physical health of an individual is treated, ignoring a major component necessary for recovery and a cause of the many diseases being addressed. LG Health currently collects utilization and provider data within the health system; however, Lancaster County level medical data is limited. Through focusing on mental health, LG Health plans to improve mental health indicators. With the treatment of health moving to prevention in the primary care setting, there is an increased opportunity for a unified approach to treating mental health and physical health. LG Health has begun convening community organizations to create a call to action in addressing anxiety and depression throughout the community. As a result, the Let's Talk Lancaster County Coalition was formed. Initiative: * Hold a Mental Well-Being Visioning Session to further finalize the SWOT analysis * Create a vision for mental well-being in Lancaster County and identify next steps to move the vision forward (Mission- To serve as a catalyst for advancing mental well-being in Lancaster County. Vision- Lancaster County is a vibrant community that promotes and supports an environment where people live mentally healthy lives.) * Engage community members in Action Teams (Workplace, Schools, Mental Health Providers, and Community) * Create the formal structure of the Mental Health Well Being Coalition-now known as Let's Talk Lancaster * In conjunction with the Lancaster County Business Group on Health, conduct a session for area employers around Mental Health Policies in the Workplace as part of their Health Summit Action Series. * Develop a Community Health Improvement model specific to Mental Health, including goal contributors. * Create an action team consisting of medical providers representing the largest primary care practices in Lancaster County to establish standardized depression screenings for adolescents and adults, aged 12-64. * Update United Way 2-1-1 database with detailed resources to enhance the referral process. * Provide education to primary care providers about various models of behavioral health relationships; referral, co-location, and integration. * Provide a mental well-being update at the 2015 Lancaster County Health Summit, including two stigma related videos: * Stigma in Lancaster County: https://youtu.be/BPyCbAlwsck * Start the Conversation: https://youtu.be/X5zylHdV9tw * Implement an EAP pilot program with 10 area businesses. * Focus efforts on creating worksite environments that support mental well-being through Mental Health First Aid trainings. * Develop a Request for Proposals for a marketing company to implement a campaign in FY 2016 focused on awareness, skill building, and accessibility of mental health services, based on collected data * Conduct a literature review and finalize SWOT analysis to gain a better understanding of mental well-being throughout the lifespan. * Integrate SWOT analysis findings into strategic plans for various action teams Additionally, on behalf of Let's Talk Lancaster, Lancaster General Health received a United Way Collective Impact Grant, with 18 community partners. This Impact Partnership will improve access and treatment for behavioral health care needs, especially for low income and minority residents. It will also provide finding for an anti-stigma campaign, community Mental Health First Aid trainings, and capacity building for depression screening in special populations (victims of domestic violence, for example). 2013 Identified Need that will not be addressed: Children without health insurance LG Health will not focus on increasing the number of children in Lancaster County with health insurance as a key priority. Through the three key priorities of LG Health, children in Lancaster County will receive preventative education and treatment through LG Health initiatives. Although this does not solve the problem of lack of health insurance, LG Health initiatives will prevent a worsening of children's health in Lancaster County. The Affordable Care Act (ACA) will help to increase health insurance coverage for children. LG Health envisions Lancaster County with 100% health insurance coverage for children. If a community organization chooses to focus on CHIP initiatives, LG Health will work with that organization to promote CHIP enrollment. 2013 Identified Need that will not be addressed: Annual particle pollution & ozone air quality Lancaster County's poor air quality is not entirely a result of the activities of those who work and live in Lancaster County. Poor air quality is also a result of the proximity of significant sources and the prevailing winds from those sources. In addition to the air pollution that is produced in the county, pollution travels on the wind from nearby cities such as the Baltimore-Washington metro area and large industrial neighbor counties such as York County, as well as from more distant upwind areas such as western Pennsylvania and the Ohio River Valley. Lancaster County is not directly responsible for its poor air quality and cannot change the land or wind patterns; encouraging residents to adopt more environmentally friendly lifestyles may make a subtle difference. LG Health does not plan to include air quality and environmental change as a key priority. However, LG Health plans to address chronic diseases through addressing obesity and tobacco. By addressing these key priorities, LG Health will help to reduce the number of individuals in Lancaster County who develop a chronic disease, thus reducing the number of individuals in Lancaster County who are at a higher risk for complications due to poor air quality. LG Health will also include addressing asthma and lung disease as part of the tobacco health improvement plan and will continue to monitor this indicator. If this indicator were to change for the worse, LG Health will reassess annual particle pollution and take appropriate actions."

As part of this process, St. John's leveraged existing relationships that provided diverse input for a comprehensive review and analysis of community health needs in the hospital's service area. St. John's Hospital (SJS) worked collaboratively with Memorial Medical Center (MMC), Sangamon County Department of Public Health (SCDPH) and Southern Illinois University (SIU) School of Medicine to complete the Sangamon County Health Needs Assessment. Members of the CHNA external Advisory Council were chosen based on their unique expertise and experience, informed perspectives community involvement.

The core group used a set of defined criteria to narrow the health focus area to 12. Following this process, the core group presented the 12 focus areas to the advisory council. Data was presented for each focus area and the advisory council was led through a forced ranking process to further narrow the list to nine focus areas for consideration as part of the FY2016-FY2018 CHNA. The core group commissioned University of Illinois in Springfield Office of Survey Research to develop an on-line survey available for community members to provide feedback around the nine priority areas. Participants were asked to rank the top three focus areas by order of importance. They were also invited to list any additional health focus areas they thought should be considered. Five community forums were presented in concurrence with the online survey. Forums were held in five locations around Sangamon County. The locations were selected in order to reach persons from varied socioeconomic, educational and ethnic backgrounds. During forums community residents were invited to provide input on community data, help identify community assets and gaps and assist in identifying priority health and quality of life issues. HSHS St. John's Hospital's internal advisory council met to review community forum and survey feedback in addition to data around the nine health focus areas.

As part of the identification and prioritization of health needs, the CHNA core group identified 22 health focus areas from extant data sources. The core group used a set of defined criteria to narrow the health focus area to 12. Following this process, the core group presented the 12 focus areas to the advisory council. Data was presented for each focus area and the advisory council was led through a forced ranking process to further narrow the list to nine focus areas for consideration as part of the FY2016-FY2018 CHNA. The core group commissioned University of Illinois in Springfield Office of Survey Research to develop an on-line survey available for community members to provide feedback around the nine priority areas. Participants were asked to rank the top three focus areas by order of importance. They were also invited to list any additional health focus areas they thought should be considered. Five community forums were presented in concurrence with the online survey. Forums were held in five locations around Sangamon County. The locations were selected in order to reach persons from varied socioeconomic, educational and ethnic backgrounds. During forums community residents were invited to provide input on community data, help identify community assets and gaps and assist in identifying priority health and quality of life issues. HSHS St. John's Hospital's internal advisory council met to review community forum and survey feedback in addition to data around the nine health focus areas. The internal advisory council was then asked to force rank the issues to identify the top four FY2016-FY2018 CHNA Health Focus Areas. As an outcome of the prioritization process, five of the nine health focus areas ranked by the community and internal advisory council were not identified as ranking high against the defined criteria and were not advanced for consideration for the implementation strategy. In some cases the focus area is currently being addressed by another organization in the community or there is another organization within the community better equipped to address the need. While the list below will not be areas of primary focus for St. John's, the hospital will continue to participate in efforts with other organizations as appropriate and where the hospital can lend support. 1. Child abuse a. In 2014, the Illinois Department of Children and Family Services entered into a year-long contract with the Mental Health Centers of Central Illinois to revamp the state's child protection training. b. The goal of this partnership is to provide experiential training through simulated real-life situations to better train child welfare workers with the necessary skills to protect children. 2. Dental care a. Dental care was not identified through the existing data sets; however, it was an issue brought to our attention by our advisory council during the community forums. b. During our assets and gaps process it was noted the Federally Qualified Health Centers are preparing to expand their dental services. Additionally, there are new services such as Familia Dental which provide affordable dental care. 3. Diabetes a. St. John's Hospital has representation on the Prairie Diabetes Alliance (PDA), which is run through the Central Illinois American Diabetes Association. Through our ongoing work with PDA and our initiatives around a FY12 identified needs: Metabolic Syndrome. We will continue our efforts around diabetes prevention and management. 4. Food insecurity a. St. John's Hospital continues to sponsor, organize and run the Eastside Farmers Market, which began as a result of the FY12 CHNA. b. St. John's Hospital also works closely with other organizations in the community who are actively addressing food security issues: genHkids Coalition, Illinois Stewardship Alliance, Downtown Springfield, Inc., to name a few. 5.

201621379349309332,510067938,"PART V.B., LINE 5:","bmc began the comprehensive Community Health Needs Assessment process in the summer of 2012, capturing data from a variety of primary and secondary sources. Utilizing guidelines set forth by the Catholic Health Association of the United States (CHA) in collaboration with VHA Inc. and Healthy Communities Institute, the Beebe CHNA process followed the following steps: Step 1: Plan and Prepare for the Assessment, Step 2: Determine the Purpose and Scope of the CHNA, Step 3: Identify Data that Describes the Health and Needs of the Community, Step 4: Understand and Interpret the Data, Step 5: Define and Validate Priorities, Step 6: Document and Communicate Results The organization felt it was imperative to collect primary data due to the limitation of servicing a relatively rural population not well characterized by solely secondary data sources. According to the Delaware Health Tracker, inaccurate data on the population at risk in small geographic areas continues to complicate epidemiologic studies in community settings. Census data are less accurate for cities or counties than for states. Therefore, an ideal approach incorporates both primary and secondary data. In order to fully incorporate the primary data elements, the CHNA team conducted focus groups, town hall meetings, stakeholder interviews, and online surveys. By gathering information from local residents and area organizations, the organization hoped to gain a better insight to the priority needs of those living in the service area. Additional data was also collected through completion of a community health survey by area residents, community based organizations and health care providers. Lastly, key informant interviews were completed with community stake holders. The following Organizations and groups participated: Alzheimer's Association; American Cancer Society; American Diabetes Association; Bayhealth, Beebe, & Nanticoke Employees (Social workers, discharge planners, patient access and financial services representatives, medical staff; Beebe Community Outreach & Home Health; Camp Rehoboth; Delaware Association of Hispanic Nurses; Delaware Breast Cancer Coalition; Delaware Healthcare Commission; Delaware Hospital Association; Delaware Hospice (Milford, Georgetown); Division of Public Health-Georgetown; Easter Seals; Ellendale Recovery Response Center; High School Wellness Centers (Lewes, Georgetown, & Indian River); Hope Medical Center; La Esperanza; La Red Federally Qualified Health Center; Law Enforcement Agencies (Milford, Georgetown, Lewes, & State); Mountairre & Perdue Chicken Plants; Nanticoke Indian Center; Peninsula Home Care; People's Place; Mid-Atlantic AIDS Training Center; Public Health Nurses (Milford, Georgetown, Milton); Southern Delaware Tourism; Strong Communities; Sussex County Association of Towns; Sussex Child Health Promotion Coalition; Sussex County Churches; Sussex County Chambers of Commerce; Sussex County EMS; Sussex County Libraries; Sussex County Fire Stations; Sussex Restaurant Association; Sussex County Senior Centers (CHEER); Sussex County Veterans Groups; VFW/American Legion; and YMCA-Rehoboth PART V.b, Line 6a and 6b: The Beebe CHNA was conducted in conjunction with the Healthier Sussex County Task Force which is led by the three healthcare systems in Sussex county Delaware- Bayhealth, Beebe and Nanticoke. Understanding that each health care system would ultimately be responsible for drafting and implementing the needs assessment and strategies, it was agreed that sharing the same methodological approach for completion of the assessment and developing strategy interventions collectively would ideally suit the needs of the residents of Sussex County. In the fall of 2012, Task Force members researched validated needs assessment tools and designed a survey and interview questionnaire in English and Spanish collaboratively. In January of 2013, outreach teams from all of the organizations involved in the Task Force began to distribute the surveys and perform interviews with stakeholders across the county. In addition, the Healthier Sussex County website was utilized to communicate regarding the Community Health Needs Assessment and served as the platform for the on-line survey tool disseminated in Sussex. PART V.b, Line 7b: Beebe Medical Center's Community Health Needs Assessment is also available on the following websites: www.delawarehealthtracker.com www.healthiersussexcounty.com PART V.b, Line 11: Five major themes were identified in the most current CHNA. They are as follows: 1) Obesity, 2) Cancer, 3) Cost/Access, 4) Mental Health, and 5) Transportation. To address the significant needs identified in the most recently conducted CHNA, Beebe has teamed up with Healthier Sussex County Task Force. The Healthier Sussex County Task Force is a collaborative effort of community members, community resources and area hospitals with a mission to make Sussex County one of the healthiest in the nation by addressing health issues and working toward optimal health. Obesity - Healthier Sussex is promoting the +3 Network which an online social site that helps join people together to encourage them to exercise. Due to the early success of the Healthier Sussex (Beebe) Plus +3 initiative, this program has grown from one based solely in Sussex county, to an entire statewide initiative title, ""Motivate the First State"". In 2015, more than 2,600 Delawareans participated, logged nearly 100,000 activities and 3.8 million minutes to raise $39,948, which was in turn donated to support several area programs, such as the YMCA of Delaware, Boys & Girls Club of Delaware and Special Olympics Delaware. In addition to providing ongoing support and participation, Beebe has been an active partner in the Walkable Bikeable Delaware campaign- working to gain funding and build out healthy infrastructure and environment for residents across the county. Cancer Healthier Sussex completed a mammography initiative focused on education and awareness efforts for minority women age 40 and older, especially those with Medicare insurance. Screening mammography is important because Sussex County has an incidence of breast cancer higher than the national average with 128.3 cases per 100,000 women. Breast health education seminars at local community organizations as well as strategic alignment with other organizations such as the Komen Foundation, Delaware Breast Cancer Coalition, Delaware Public Health and the American Cancer Society, who have all been ongoing partners in this part of our implementation plan. A second and incredibly component of our plan address cancer needs in Sussex, has been the roll out of our low dose computed tomography services for patients at risk of lung cancer. In fact, as of December 2015, Beebe Healthcare has been designated a Lung Cancer Screening Center by the American College of Radiology (ACR). The designation recognizes Beebes lung cancer screening initiative as one that is committed to practicing safe and effective testing with low dose computed tomography (CT) imaging technology. To help diagnose lung cancer in its early stages when it is most treatable, Beebe offers the low dose CT screening for people that are at a high risk of developing lung cancer. These scans are offered at very low cost to make them affordable to as many people as possible with a charge of $99, which includes the interpretation of the images. Patients who are uninsured or underinsured with an income between 138 % and 250 % of the Federal Poverty Level will qualify for screenings through Delawares Screening for Life program at no charge to them. Mental Health Beebe has implemented Insights Tele-Psychiatry service which provides access to psychiatric specialist at any time, emergent evaluations and commitments, STAT and floor psych consults, 24/7 call center, electronic consultation form, a collaborative team approach, scheduling of all clinicians, and continuous IT support. The tele-psychiatry service is currently providing care to an average of 15 inpatients per month and 20 emergency patients per month. Also, Beebe Healthcare is supporting the establishment of a free standing mental health facility here in Sussex County, provided by SUN Behavioral Health, who plans to offer an array of services to people from ages 5 years old and up on its campus, including outpatient care for people with mental health problems as well as those struggling with substance abuse. Cost and Access Under a State Partnership Exchange model, Delaware has been managing in-person consumer assistance, outreach and communications, and plan management functionality for enrollment in the Insurance Exchange/Marketplace. Guides have been placed in hospital emergency departments across the state. Beebe Patient Financial Services also works with patients who require financial assistance. In 2013, Beebe became an active team member in the Statewide Health Innovation Model design/planning and implementation. This pl"

Mercy Medical Center - Des Moines is an 802-bed acute care, not-for-profit Catholic hospital serving the residents of Iowa. Mercy was founded by the Sisters of Mercy in 1893 and is Des Moines' longest operating hospital. As a member of Catholic Health Initiatives (CHI) since 1995, Mercy continues to be a strong presence for both primary and tertiary-level health care. Mercy Medical Center - Des Moines is one of the Midwest's major referral centers, with areas of excellence including cardiology, cancer, birthing and pediatric services, emergency/trauma services, critical care, neurology, orthopedics, behavioral medicine and more. Mercy employs 7,100 people, with a medical staff of more than 800 physicians and allied health professionals. To involve all residents of our state in the full continuum of health care services, Mercy has adopted a ""Right Care, Right Place, Right Time"" philosophy in meeting the acute, chronic and preventative needs of the communities we serve. This team approach includes a network of health care facilities in 14 rural communities as well as 28 family practice and specialty clinics throughout the central Iowa area. Each primary care clinic is structured to offer a medical home for each of their patients. This medical home empowers patients by maintaining an ongoing relationship with a personal physician and clinic team. Mercy's goal is to engage and empower patients to be actively involved in managing their own health care. Today, living our mission and values at Mercy Medical Center - Des Moines means reaching people throughout the community where they live, work and interact. We are called to respond to the needs of people on all levels of well-being. This includes proactive behaviors such as providing immunizations, facilitating healthy lifestyles, and conducting screenings and examinations to diagnose and treat disease in its earliest possible stages. This report reflects our extension of service beyond the walls of the traditional hospital as we reach out to our community in partnerships with others. Target Areas and Priority Populations Mercy Medical Center - Des Moines has a primary service area of three counties and a secondary reach to the surrounding six counties. The population served includes both urban and rural communities, with a growing number of people residing in the 3-county primary service area (Polk, Dallas, and Warren). These residents have a median household income of $61,721, with roughly eight percent of persons living below the poverty level. Of those who live below the poverty level, 52 percent are single-parent families with children under 5 years of age. With an increasing immigrant and refugee population relocating to Iowa, approximately 10 percent of our 3-county area speak a language other than English at home. The largest non-native population has Hispanic origin, representing 10.7 percent of our community. Another demographic factor impacting Iowa's demand for health care service is our elderly, with 14.9 percent of our residents being over 65 years of age. The uninsured population of our 3-county service area is approximately eight percent. Medicare and Medicaid cover 22 percent of the residents in our primary service area. What Does Our Community Need? Working with nearly 30 community-based organizations, Mercy Medical Center - Des Moines joined in an in-depth evaluation of the health of our community. Designed to identify needs and develop improvement strategies, the process engaged thousands of residents and vested leaders in this valuable discussion. Many services identified as greatest need were critically important, but best addressed by community collaborators with specific expertise. Mercy Medical Center - Des Moines, through a discernment of data, community feedback and internal consultation, saw the proactive response to chronic disease management as an area where we could contribute and monitor outcomes. In particular, the Mercy physicians, staff and Board of Directors felt an impact was possible taking a pre-emptive approach to risk factors such as obesity, hypertension and lack of physical activity. Empowering patients to embrace a healthier lifestyle, especially in relation to the prevention and/or management of chronic disease has been identified as an area of targeted focus for our system. Major Needs and How Priorities Were Established The Central Iowa Community Health Need's Assessment (CHNA) was a collaboration among the three largest nonprofit hospitals in Iowa: Iowa Health Des Moines, Mercy Medical Center-Des Moines, and Broadlawns Medical Center. These three hospitals serve multi-county areas so the CHNA included Polk, Dallas and Warren Counties. Each county conducted an individual County Health Improvement Plan by engaging residents and local stakeholders in conversations to determine the greatest needs in their communities. The health needs identified in Polk County were: * Ensure access to affordable, healthy food for everyone * Devote additional resources to prevention and wellness * Provide youth with more ways to be physically active every day in school * Make sure all people in Polk County have health insurance * Expand health coverage for families who cannot afford private insurance * Ensure equal access to health care for all * Empower more people to take responsibility for maintaining their health * Identify personal health services needs of populations Dallas County identified the following health needs in their communities: * Increase public awareness of resources to address the issues of access to care * Increase awareness of mental health resources * Increase the percentage of Dallas County adults who consume five or more fruits/vegetables per day * Increase the percentage of Dallas County adults who engage in regular physical activity * Increase the percentage of residents seeking treatment to begin treatment within seven days * Decrease youth use of Alcohol/Tobacco/Other Drugs Warren County's health needs were identified as: * Reduce the adult obesity rate to 25-30% range from current 31-32% range * Increase the amount of physical activity in children * Increase family planning/pregnancy prevention resources to decrease teen pregnancy Based on the identified needs from each of the County Health Improvement Plans, healthy weight and access to health insurance/care are two identified in the community Needs Assessment. *Statistics courtesy of Iowa Department of Public Health 2009 Iowa Chronic Disease Report The Mercy Medical Center Community Health Assessment Team (CHAT) saw a common thread with both of these priorities. Obesity and lack of access to health care can result in chronic diseases like diabetes, hypertension and heart disease. By empowering patients to take a proactive role in their own health and connecting residents to both a personal support system and a medical home, the committee hopes to strengthen the network of support for wellness in Central Iowa. How the Implementation Strategy Was Developed Mercy Medical Center - Des Moines' Implementation Strategy has been developed based on the findings of the CHNA that was completed in June 2012. Approved by the Mercy Board of Directors on May 1, 2013, Mercy Medical Center - Des Moines has worked with the Iowa Department of Health and our county health departments to deliver a evidence-based program called Better Choices/Better Health (Chronic Disease Self-Management Education). Our focus has to offer this highly respected initiative, developed by Stanford University and the Stanford School of Medicine, to create networks of support where our residents work, play, and live. We vetted our proposed initiative with our community collaborators to validate our discernment process. Through their enthusiastic endorsement, our efforts continue to address both of the needs identified. The management of weight (and related conditions) in a supportive environment has proven to result in greater understanding and adoption of permanent lifestyle changes. Our goal is to enhance this opportunity and trend. Secondly, the support system created cultivates trust in and commitment to the use of a medical partner in the management of conditions requiring professional intervention. Given our expertise and established history of proactively creating a healthier community, we have wisely used our valuable resources in a focused and measurable manner."

IT HAS AN ACTIVE ROLE IN THREE OUT OF THE FIVE CHNA PRIORITY AREAS WHICH INCLUDES THE FOLLOWING: CHRONIC DISEASE AND OBESITY, SUBSTANCE ABUSE AND BEHAVIORAL HEALTH, AND HEALTH LITERACY AND DISPARITIES. FOR CHNA PRIORITY CHRONIC DISEASE AND OBESITY, THE HOSPITAL DEVELOPED AND IMPLEMENTED A DIABETIC DISEASE MANAGEMENT EDUCATIONAL PROGRAM (DSRIP), OFFERED A NUMBER OF DISEASE MANAGEMENT EDUCATIONAL PROGRAMS TARGETING INDIVIDUALS WITH DIABETES, HEART DISEASE AND CANCER, AND DEVELOPED/PILOTED A FAITH-BASED WEIGHT-LOSS PROGRAM. THE HOSPITAL ADDRESSED CHNA PRIORITY SUBSTANCE ABUSE AND BEHAVIORAL HEALTH BY IMPLEMENTING SCREENING, BRIEF INTERVENTION, AND REFERRAL TO TREATMENT (SBRIT) PROCESS IN THE EMERGENCY DEPARTMENT. FINALLY, FOR CHNA PRIORITY HEALTH LITERACY AND DISPARITIES, THE HOSPITAL CONTINUED ITS SUPPORT OF THE HEALTH TEACHER/GONOODLE PROGRAM IN THE TRENTON SCHOOL DISTRICT. AS NOTED IN THE CHNA, TRENTON'S HEALTH CHALLENGES ARE NUMEROUS. SOME OF THOSE CHALLENGES, WHILE BEYOND THE SCOPE OF THE CURRENT CHNA AND THEREFORE NOT A PRIMARY FOCUS OF THE CHIP, BEAR MENTIONING IN ORDER TO FULLY UNDERSTAND THE PICTURE OF HEALTH IN TRENTON. ADDITIONAL FACTORS IMPACTING HEALTH OUTCOMES IN THE CITY INCLUDE: - HIV/AIDS AND HEPATITIS C - TEEN PREGNANCY AND POOR BIRTH OUTCOMES - SEXUALLY TRANSMITTED DISEASES - LEAD POISONING - OTHER CHRONIC CONDITIONS SUCH AS ASTHMA - TRANSPORTATION EFFORTS ARE CURRENTLY UNDER WAY TO ADDRESS THESE ISSUES, WHICH MAY ULTIMATELY OVERLAP WITH SOME OF OUR CHIP INITIATIVES.

SOME OF THE PRIMARY NEEDS INCLUDE: - DECREASE CIGARETTE SMOKING AMONG ADULTS - DECREASE ADULT OBESITY - INCREASE HYPERTENSIVES WHO HAVE THEIR BLOOD PRESSURE IN CONTROL - DECREASE UNINTENDED PREGNANCY RATES - DECREASE STDS/STIS, ESPECIALLY CHLAMYDIA AND GONORRHEA RATES - IMPROVE MENTAL HEALTH AMONG ADULTS AND ADOLESCENTS THE COMMUNITY HEALTH IMPROVEMENT WORKGROUP CHOSE TO PRIORITIZE ""PREVENTING CHRONIC DISEASE"", WHICH CLEARLY INCLUDES THE TOP THREE BULLET POINTS. DUE TO LIMITED RESOURCES AND TO AVOID 'MISSION CREEP' THE HOSPITAL SYSTEMS CHOSE NOT TO ADDRESS RISKY SEXUAL BEHAVIORS AND MENTAL HEALTH PROMOTION IN THE IMPROVEMENT PLAN. REGARDING ISSUES OF RISKY SEXUAL BEHAVIOR: ALTHOUGH THE MEASURES OF SUCCESS INDICATE THAT MONROE COUNTY IS 'WORSE THAN' THE STATE AND HAS NOT REACHED THE GOALS SET IN THE NY STATE PREVENTION AGENDA, HOSPITAL LEADERS FELT THAT ALTHOUGH THIS ISSUE CERTAINLY AFFECTS THE MEMBERS IN THE HOSPITAL'S TARGET AREAS, THIS IS NOT A TOP PRIORITY FOR USE OF THE HOSPITALS' RESOURCES. HOSPITAL LEADERS FELT THEY WERE NOT THE BEST ENTITY TO ADDRESS THIS PROBLEM. IN ADDITION, THERE ARE COMMUNITY ORGANIZATIONS WHO HAVE THIS GOAL AS THEIR MISSION, AND SEVERAL INITIATIVES THAT HAVE JUST STARTED IN MONROE COUNTY THAT COULD BE QUITE IMPACTFUL. REGARDING ISSUES OF MENTAL HEALTH: ALTHOUGH MENTAL HEALTH IS ALWAYS A CONCERN AMONG THE COMMUNITY, THE COMMUNITY HEALTH IMPROVEMENT WORKGROUP FELT THAT THE DEGREE OF THE PROBLEM WAS NOT AS SEVERE AS SOME OTHER HEALTH ISSUES. ALTHOUGH MONROE COUNTY IS WORSE THAN THE STATE FOR PREVENTION AGENDA INDICATORS, THIS DIFFERENCE IS NOT SIGNIFICANT, SO MONROE COUNTY IS SOMEWHAT IN LINE WITH GOALS AND THE REST OF THE STATE. IN ADDITION, THE HOSPITALS FELT THAT THE LEVEL OF ACTIVITY BEING CONDUCTED BY MANY AGENCIES IN OUR COMMUNITY WAS STRONG. THE TEAM WAS ALSO NOT CONFIDENT IN THE LIKELIHOOD OF SUCCESS IF THE HOSPITALS CONCENTRATED ON ADDRESSING MENTAL HEALTH.

201621379349302182,362174823,Rush University Medical Center,"Part V, Section B, Line 11: The top eight health needs identified and described in the Rush University Medical Center's CHNA included the following: social determinants of health, access to health care services; physical activity, nutrition and weight control, diabetes, heart disease and cardiovascular risk factors, women's health, mental health and asthma and respiratory health.To address these needs, Rush University Medical Center applies five main strategies:1. Direct Patient Care2. Health Education and Promotion3. Healthcare Pipeline Training Programs4. Community-Based Research Studies5. Allocation of Corporate Resources and Building Corporate PartnershipsDirect Patient Care: This strategy includes any direct patient care, both preventive and acute care, provided by Rush faculty, staff or students to disadvantaged populations. This includes:Health care services provided by students in real-life teaching scenarios at community practice sites and community centersScreening and diagnostic servicesSocial work services integrated into primary care settingsExamples of those programs are:The Community Health clinic provides free preventive and primary health care services to members of the community who cannot afford or are ineligible for medical insurance. This service improves access to care by offering health services ranging from routine physicals and immunization programs to a full laboratory and pharmacy. First- and -second-year medical students triage patients at CommunityHealth inquire about the nature and course of patient illnesses, perform laboratory procedures, and observe and participate while patients are examined and treated. Third- and fourth-year medical students examine patients as well as diagnose and recommend a treatment plan under the close supervision of attending physicians.The Faculty Practice and Outreach administered by the College of Nursing and the Office of Community Engagement, provides healthcare services to underserved individuals, families, and communities at a variety of diverse community practice sites. These sites include School-Based Health Centers, employee wellness programs, women's health clinics, nurse practitioner primary care, and case management programs for mental illness and substance abuse.Health Education and Promotion: This strategy includes any program providing educational resources or opportunities that promote preventive lifestyle behaviors and/or the self-management of disease. This includes:CounselingHealth fairs, classes and workshopsLectures and presentationsExamples of those programs are:The Health Promotion: Chronic Disease Self-Management Program through Rush's Department of Health and Aging offers interactive, six-week workshops to help those with ongoing health conditions - such as arthritis, heart or lung disease and asthma - maintain control and confidence in managing their health while doing the things that matter most in life.The Mexican Consulate Health Outreach program plans quarterly health education and screening events to address social health disparities in the Latino population. This interdisciplinary program educates attendees on a wide range of topics including nutrition, diabetes management and hypertension.The Rush Generations program in Rush's Department of Health and Aging plans a robust, year-round calendar of classes, workshops and health screenings that enhance physical and emotional wellbeing of adults and older adults. This program increase physical activity levels of older adults by offering fitness classes such as Zumba, Yoga, and Tai Chi.Pipeline training programs: This strategy includes directing existing and future programs that train and educate people of all age groups on careers in health science, focusing on building the pipeline for future health care careerists. This can include:Educational events for young children on job opportunities and training in a health care settingEducational events and on-the-job training for adults interested in pursuing a career in health related field.Examples of those programs are:Malcolm X College (MXC) and Rush have a rich, multi-year history of interactions and cooperative activities. These include hosting health occupation students' clinical rotations in nursing, surgical technology, radiologic technology, EMT/paramedic, and respiratory care at Rush and providing anatomy labs for MXC health occupations students. Rush also provides guest lecturers and recently began offering a monthly interdisciplinary professional lunch and learn series for MXC students and faculty on issues and trends related to health care. This partnership, which RUMC enhanced under its FY2015-2016 Implementation Strategy addresses social determinants of health through the promotion of workforce training and education.The Rush Center for Urban Health Equity merges expertise from a broad range of scientific disciplines (including medical, biological, and behavioral sciences) to develop interventions and programs that reduce health disparities and address social determinants of health. This program also provides training opportunities for promising individuals from underrepresented and underserved communities to pursue careers in multidisciplinary research on health disparities.Community-based Research Studies: This strategy focuses on finding internal and external means to fund community-based research or studies developing evidence-based approaches to addressing top health needs. This can include:Investigations on the reasons for health disparities between vulnerable populationsDevelopment and testing of innovative interventionsExamples of those programs are:The CHART Study will test the value of a culturally-sensitive, multilevel, chronic care intervention for low-income patients hospitalized with heart failure.The Community United to Challenge Asthma (CURA) is a research study that compares a community health worker (CHW) self-management intervention to standard asthma education in high-risk Puerto Rican children in elementary and high school. During home visits, the family will be educated using a standard asthma core curriculum which is tailored to individual needs, strengths, and beliefs. The first aim is to assess the ability of the CHW intervention to reduce home asthma triggers and increase medication adherence in Puerto Rican children and adolescents with asthma. The second aim is to determine if any changes in triggers and adherence associated with this intervention are sustained 8 months after the completion of the active intervention.Allocation of corporate resources and building corporate partnerships: This strategy will focus on the overall organizational and corporate resources that are dedicated to building partnerships and support organizations that address health needs in the community. This can include:Direct funding to community programs or partnershipsOrganizational-wide initiatives to raise money on behalf of community partnersExamples of those programs are:Rush Charitable Contributions is a program where Rush's senior management allocates corporate funds to non-profit organizations who have a focus on health and other needs of their community. Donations are made based on the alignment of the requesting partner's mission with Rush's focus on the health needs of the community.The Science and Math Excellence (SAME) Network is a large-scale community service enterprise to improve the social determinants of health by focusing on education. Formed in 1990, the SAME Network provides students in these neighborhoods with the same opportunities to learn math and science as are available to their peers in more affluent areas. At the time of its formation, Rush Community Affairs staff spearheaded the SAME Network's first effort to improve education in the area by raising funds from the community to build state-of-the-art science laboratories in local schools that lacked these facilities. Since then, the SAME Network has grown into a collaborative between Rush and 45 elementary schools, six high schools and many Chicago-area businesses. Several of its specific programs are mentioned in this plan as well."
201621379349302182,362174823,Rush University Medical Center,"Part V, Section B, Line 13h: The State of Illinois requires that hospitals make a good faith effort to identify ""presumptive"" charity care for uninsured patients under 200% of FPL. We complete this process by receiving FPL information from a 3rd party vendor for all uninsured patients."
201621379349302182,362174823,Rush University Medical Center,"Part V, Section B, Line 20e: Rush conducts all of the efforts described in lines 20a-d prior to initiating any of the extraordinary collection activities (ECA) identified by line 19. The only ECA that Rush engages in is to report unpaid balances to credit agencies, which generally occurs no sooner than 540 days after the date on which the service giving rise to the unpaid balance was provided.In addition to meeting financial and residency requirements, individuals applying for financial assistance must: cooperate with Rush and provide information and documentation truthfully and in a timely manner; make a good faith effort to honor the terms of reasonable payment terms on open balances if the individual qualifies only for a partial discount; notify Rush of any change in financial situation which may impact the individual's eligibility for financial assistance or payment plan; AND agree to apply for local, state or federal assistance for which the individual may be eligible to help pay for some or all of the individual's hospital bill."
201621379349302182,362174823,Rush University Medical Center,"Part V, Section B, Line 22d: The uninsured patient discount for patients at or below 600% FPG for emergent and medically necessary care is set at 68%. Rush calculates this discount in accordance with the calculation prescribed by Illinois state law, which is based on the hospital's cost to charge ratio. The calculation as of December 2014 yielded a 66% discount. Rush elected to retain the discount at 68%, which is higher than what is required. Uninsured patients with incomes greater than 600% FPG are granted discounts at a lower level ranging from 50% to 33%.No individual who is determined to be eligible for financial assistance will be charged more for emergency or other medically necessary care than the amount generally billed for individuals who have insurance covering such care. The basis to which any discount is applied is equivalent to the billed charges posted to a patient account minus any prior insurance payments and adjustments from the patient's insurance (if applicable). Rush determines the amount generally billed (AGB) to individuals who have insurance covering their care by multiplying its charges for any emergency or other medically necessary care it provides by certain percentages using the Internal Revenue Service look-back method as described in Treas. Reg. 1.501(r)-5. The look back method, analyzes a recent 12-month period of allowed claims to determine the actual payment rate that Medicare and private insurers are collectively allowing. The intent is to ensure that the discount provided to financial assistance eligible patients is equal to or greater than the discount provided to patients with insurance."

The process was designed to identify the most pressing health concerns in Hamilton County with special emphasis on vulnerable populations. The essential components examined in this process included the data indicators compiled on TCH's online community health dashboard of over 100 economical, environmental and health categories; the A.I.M. (Ask. Inform. Make a difference.) Community Health Needs Assessment; the Hamilton County Public Health Department's Community Health Assessment for Hamilton County; the Greater Cincinnati Community Health Status Survey; and The United Way of Greater Cincinnati's Bold Goals. Key findings were reviewed with our community partners and internal stakeholders to further identify gaps in existing services. The prevalent health concerns identified in the Hamilton County area through this needs assessment include: 1. Access to care 2. Breast and prostate cancer 3. Cardiovascular disease a. Hypertension b. Hyperlipidemia c. Stroke d. Congestive heart failure 4. Diabetes 5. Behaviors Related to Obesity 6. Maternal and Infant Health a. Low-birth weight babies b. Infant mortality rates Through initiatives (investments in programs to improve specific needs identified within the community) within its six key service lines, and continued support of The Carl and Edyth Lindner Center for Research and Education at The Christ Hospital, LLC (Lindner Center), TCH is addressing the needs identified in its 2013 community health needs assessment. The following investments have been made by TCH to promote access to affordable healthcare within our community: Comprehensive Primary Care; Center for Health and Aging; TCH's Outpatient Clinic Offerings (including internal medicine and specialized clinical services); and Corporate Wellness Outreach. Each program targets a specific patient population and set individual goals aimed at developing community care and coordination pathways, increasing access points for affordable healthcare in addition to other targeted outcomes. Through the following investments, TCH is striving to improve the outcomes of our community affected by breast and prostate cancer: TCH's OB/Gyn Outpatient Clinic; Prostate Collaborative Committee; Breast Cancer Patient Navigator Program; American Cancer Society Partnership - Making Strides; and Subsidized Mammography Program. Each program targets a specific patient population and set individual goals aimed at improving the outcomes for patients, as well as increase the level of education and screening in the community. Utilizing the Lindner Center (which has participated in more than 1,200 clinical trials including multiple first-in-man and first-in-the-U.S. procedures, which have contributed to best practice standards for the care of patients); recent investments in TCH's Heart Tower (including the only heart failure center in the U.S. to be accredited by both the Joint Commission and the Heathcare Accreditation Colloquium); and expansion of itS primary care initiatives, TCH is tackling cardiovascular disease, diabetes and obesity through the following programs and investments: Comprehensive Primary Care; Center for Health and Aging; Corporate Wellness Outreach; Complete Health Improvement Plan (CHIP) offerings; and partnerships with the American Heart Association, YMCA and Cincinnati Sports. Each program targets a specific patient population and has set individual goals aimed at prevention education and screening for hypertension, hyperlipidemia, diabetes and obesity. By addressing these risk factors TCH hopes to reduce risk of congestive heart failure and stroke. TCH continues to make further investments in its Women's Health programs, and understands the importance of maternal and infant health needs within our community. Through the following programs and investments, TCH is addressing maternal and infant health needs of the community: TCH's Prenatal Clinic; Center for Centering Pregnancy; March of Dimes Partnership; Community Health Worker Program; and Cradle Cincinnati. Each program targets expecting or new mothers in at risk populations, and has set individual goals aimed at increasing access to care and ease of care for expecting motherS and increasing level of education for better outcomes. WHILE CONDUCTING ITS COMMUNITY NEEDS ASSESSMENT, TCH IDENTIFIED TWO HEALTH NEEDS WITHIN THE COMMUNITY - SEXUALLY-TRANSMITTED DISEASES, INCLUDING CHLAMYDIA, GONORRHEA AND SYPHILIS; AND ORAL CARE - WHICH FIT WITHIN ITS STRATEGIC MISSION OF IMPROVING THE HEALTH OF THE COMMUNITY, BUT FOR WHICH ITS RESOURCES ARE SLIM. WHILE THESE AREAS DO NOT FALL WITHIN THE SCOPE OF THEIR CURRENT SERVICES, TCH IS COGNIZANT OF THE IMPORTANCE OF THESE ISSUES WITHIN THE COMMUNITY AND SUPPORTS THEM THROUGH COMMUNITY PARTNERSHIPS WITH GROUPS LIKE THE CINCINNATI DEPARTMENT OF HEALTH. CONTINUED FOCUS ON THESE TYPE OF COLLABORATIVE RELATIONSHIPS AND ONGOING VIGILANCE IN MONITORING PROGRESS IN THESE AREAS WILL CONTINUE.

As an active member of the health care council of the lehigh valley (""hcclv""), st. Luke's health network worked in collaboration with four other regional, non-profit acute and post-acute care hospitals and the dorothy rider pool trust to develop the region's community health needs assessment. The hospital partners of the hcclv include: - sacred heart healthcare system - lehigh valley health network - st. Luke's university health network - good shepherd rehabilitation hospital - kidspeace The hcclv's approach to the chna incorporates best practice standards recommended by the american public health association (""apha"") and the association for community health improvement (""achi"") and has actively partnered with many stakeholders, community based organizations and community members. The dorothy rider pool trust reached out to two community-based organizations, the hispanic center lehigh valley in bethlehem and the resurrected community development corporation in allentown, as organizations trusted within each community to host the forums.

A multi-disciplinary team met and through a rigorous process an implementation plan was adopted to meet some of the identified unmet needs which were within the hospital's mission and ability to positively impact. Hospitals are not required to, nor can they meet all unmet needs in the community. Any unmet needs not addressed by the adopted implementation plan are already being addressed in the service area by the hospital, other healthcare providers, government, and local non-profit organizations; amongst others. There have been no new programs implemented by the hospital during the current year that address the unmet needs identified in the attached implementation plan. Our priority unmet needs in the implementation plan are integral to our community benefit strategy. St. Luke's leaders continue to monitor new program developments and services.

In FY2015, HSHS St. Elizabeth's senior leadership engaged Southern Illinois University School of Medicine's Center for Clinical Research and Office of Community Health and Service to provide quantitative and secondary data and community health data on the four county service areas. In addition, the team along with members of the Community Benefit committee identified additional data sets to review and discuss with focus groups. Internal data collected consisted of the top 10 diagnosis of patients admitted to the hospital from the Emergency Department and the top 10 diagnosis of patients discharged from the Emergency Department. The FY2012 Community Health Needs Assessment (CHNA) was also included in the data review. A core group of St. Elizabeth's colleagues along with our physician partners provided valuable input for this CHNA. This focus group discussed the data, shared insights from their perspective vantage point and identified their top three health care focus areas. HSHS St. Elizabeth Hospital also leveraged existing relationships that provided diverse input for a comprehensive review and analysis of community health needs in the hospital's service area. These external component steps included conducting a survey at the Regional Health Policy Summit, leading focus groups, and utilizing the expertise of the existing Community Benefits Committee members. Community members were invited based on their awareness of and expertise on addressing the needs of our community. There was particular attention afforded to those who work with the underserved, low income, and minority populations as well as populations with chronic disease. In addition a special focus group was conducted with the homeless in their environment. Local focus groups were sponsored by community partners, which further demonstrate St Elizabeth's integration with the community. Members included the director of St. Clair County Public Health Commission, a retired nurse; St. Clair Mental Health Board (mental health); the Carla Smith Foundation (families of the mentally ill); a USAF Nurse from Scott Air Force Base (population health): members of the clergy; community-based hospice; BEACON ministries (social services agency for the poor and underserved); Health Visions East social worker for low income, medically underserved, and the elderly; local mental health agencies; representatives from senior living; a university professor; an agency for domestic violence prevention; legal and financial services that represent low income population; and a member of the local Federally Quantified Healthcare Center."

Identification and Prioritization of Needs Identifying and prioritizing the areas of focus was completed using LEAN Principles. The charter, the first step in the LEAN process, consisted of identifying the primary customers, the scope of the project, the primary goal and the metrics selected for the CHNA. We listened to the voice of community members as St Elizabeth's collaborated with our community partners. Individuals included the Community Benefit team, social agencies such as BEACON ministries, the executive medical staff, and SIU School of Medicine. The key drivers selected included the SIU secondary data analysis, focus groups, surveys, and Emergency Department(ED) data. These key drivers were further delineated into critical to quality requirements that provided measurable specifications. Data collected and measured included focus group members top three health needs, survey results of the top three health needs, and the top 10 ED diagnosis codes for both admitted and discharged patients. The data was collected and analyzed using a pareto chart. A pareto chart measures data in decreasing order of occurrence. The pareto chart identified poverty as the largest area of need followed by access to healthcare, obesity, food scarcity, and diabetes and then substance abuse as the top six. As a health care organization St. Elizabeth's expertise and resources are best used addressing a health care need with measurable outcomes. Noting the association among some of the topics the data was categorized using an Affinity Diagram. An Affinity Diagram organizes a large amount of data into natural relationships. Using the data in the Affinity Diagram a new pareto chart was created. The priority areas that rose to the top were nutrition, followed by mental health/substance abuse, access to care, and cardiac disease. As part of the identification and prioritization of health needs, HSHS St. Elizabeth's senior leadership team and the CHNA Steering Committee considered the estimated feasibility and effectiveness of possible interventions by the hospital to impact these health priorities; the burden, scope, severity, or urgency of the health need; the health disparities associated with the health needs; the importance the community places on addressing the health need; and other community assets and resources that could be leveraged through strategic collaboration in the hospital's service area to address the health need. Based on the CHNA planning and development process described, the following community health needs were identified: 1. Nutrition and Wellness 2. Access to Care 3. Cardiac Disease Implementation Plan to Address Identified Needs HSHS St. Elizabeth Hospital partnered with other organizations to develop, implement, monitor and evaluate both new and ongoing initiatives that address the identified priority community health needs. The set of implementation strategies and interventions are contained in the Implementation Plan, which was approved and adopted by an authorized body of the hospital. The implementation strategies and interventions will include, but are not limited to, the following initiatives:. 1. Wellness related to Nutrition a. Goal: To partner with the local soup kitchen to provide a series of education classes on nutrition. Measure: Conduct quarterly classes at the soup kitchen. b. Goal: Partner with the Eastside Health District and provide customers with samples of healthy food and recipes at the farmer's market. Measure: Assess customer's feedback. c. Goal: Cultivate and support a community garden and donate the produce to the local food pantries. Measure: Weigh the amount of produce donated to the food pantry and encourage colleagues to donate surplus produce from their personal gardens. d. Goal: To provide support and information to individuals with diabetes that will help with diabetes self-management. Measure: Continue to conduct the Diabetes support Group and complete annual survey related to knowledge and behavioral changes. Measure: Provide health screenings/glucose test and education to the community on a quarterly basis. Measure: Refer and track pre-diabetes patients for classes to our partner, the YMCA. Measure: Enroll eligible patients in the DSME program and track their referral source. Measure: Participate in a division wide diabetes campaign in partnership with Walmart and create a cohort of patients that we can measure and track physical behavioral changes. e. Goal: To provide the services of a dietitian to organizations free of charge for education about nutrition and healthy eating. Measure: Dietitian will make three presentations during the year, which may include a grocery store tour and/or cooking demonstration to teach individuals how to shop and cook for healthy foods. 2. Access to Health Care To provide access to medical care for those in need a. Goal: to increase enrollment in the Health insurance exchange. Measure: During the period of open enrollment on the HIE, November 1, 2015 and end January 31, 2016, St. Elizabeth's Hospital will distribute one news release to the local media about open enrollment and place information on the hospital's website. The services of a enrollment counselor will be funded by the hospital as the level of need is determined for the county and in coordination with the local/regional public health departments. b. Goal: To further assess the need for non-emergency medical transportation and identify other organizations for possible collaboration. Measure: Assessment will be completed and one action taken as identified to improve transportation access and/or reduce costs for low income residents. Collaboration will be completed with current public transportation provider, as appropriate. c. Goal: To address to the needs of eligible patients that require medications and services to safely transition patients to an appropriate level of care. Measure: Collaborate with other organizations that support the continuum of care for eligible patients and can provide needed services."

Heart Disease/Cerebrovascular Disease and further evaluated until we reached sufficient detailed information that enabled us to measure the information. For example, the key drivers: a. Goal: To promote heart health awareness, education about cardiovascular disease as well as eating and lifestyle choices. Measure: During the month of February, nationally recognized as Heart Health month, one activity will be held for community health education. Measure: Conduct/participate in quarterly community health programs Measure: Meet with outside agencies and hospitals and provide cardiac and stroke education. Measure: Conduct quarterly classes at the soup kitchen on cardiac and stroke awareness. Measure: Participate in a division wide diabetes/cardiac campaign in partnership with Walmart and create a cohort of patients that we can measure and track physical and behavioral changes. In addition to the above activities HSHS St. Elizabeth's continues to engage the community in many other activities that provide support to the poor and underserved. As a teaching institute, hospital colleagues mentor students in a variety of disciplines including a family practice residency program, pharmacy, nursing and multiple ancillary departments. As an outcome of the prioritization process, the following community health needs were also identified and will not be addressed directly by the hospital for the reasons indicated: * Mental Health and Substance Abuse- this category is listed as the second health care priority. St. Elizabeth's will continue to partner with local and state agencies to assist when feasible with mental health and substance abuse. St. Elizabeth's is in the process of transitioning the majority of our mental health resources and expertise to a local community partner and St Elizabeth's lacks necessary resources to pursue this priority. * Tobacco Use - The hospital did not take the lead on this issue. It is best addressed through the County Health Department smoking cessation classes. * Poverty- due the complexity of this issue the hospital will not take lead. There are several agencies that are addressing this issue. St. Elizabeth's partners with agencies such as East-Side Aligned, Catholic Urban Programs, St. Vincent DePaul, and BEACON ministries to provide support. * Violent Crimes- The hospital will not take lead because it is not an area of expertise for St. Elizabeth's, however an active partnership exists with the Violence Prevention Center. * Sexually Transmitted Diseases-the local health department leads this focus area. * Lack of available healthy food and food scarcity. The hospital did not take the lead on this issue. It is addressed by groups including local food pantries, East Side Health District, and East Side Aligned. The hospital supports these efforts by donating community garden proceeds to the local food pantry and conducting food drives. * Maternal and Infant Health as it relates to infant mortality and teen pregnancy; the hospital has a special care nursery and a pediatrician on staff but the hospital lacks the resources to further enhance programs for maternal and child health at this time. It is part of the St Clair County IPLAN. * Lung Cancer - This is issue is being addressed in the IPLAN; additionally St. Elizabeth's offers new technology to screen for lung cancer."

The CHNA that was conducted: July - October 2012 identified the following 31 community needs, all of which impact and individuals/family's health and in turn the community's health, which are grouped by category: * Economics: Unemployment/Underemployment, Poverty, Lack of Jobs. * Education: children being adequately educated, unsafe school environment, bullying/harassment, use/availability of drugs. * Environmental: water and air pollution, noise pollution. * Health: alcohol/drug abuse, smoking and tobacco, adults with mental illness/emotional issues, children with mental health or emotional issues, lack of affordable medical care, HIV/AIDS, diabetes, and obesity. * Housing: shortage of affordable housing, substandard housing, overcrowded housing. * Leisure Activities: shortage of recreational facilities, lack of cultural activities. * Safety: crime, gangs. * Social: teen pregnancy, racial or ethnic intimidation, family violence, gambling, and lack of affordable daycare for children. * Transportation: inadequate public transportation, poor roads and traffic conditions. Following a needs prioritization process and evaluation, the HBCC chose to develop strategies to address the following top priority needs identified: Strategy 1: Promote a Healthy Lifestyle (to address: obesity, diabetes and encourage a healthy lifestyle) Strategy 2: Alcohol and Other Substance Abuse (to address alcohol/drug abuse) Strategy 3: Mental Health Needs of Children/Adolescents (to address (to address children with mental health or emotional issues) Strategy 4: Smoking/Tobacco (to address smoking and tobacco use) UPMC Altoona has chosen, in partnership with the HBCC, to address the following community needs: 1. Promote a healthy lifestyle: to address obesity, physical inactivity, and diabetes. 2. Mental health needs of children and adolescents. The other 2 community hospitals and the remaining 47 other community partners that are part of the HBCC are addressing some of the other 31 issues identified above. However neither UPMC Altoona - as a single community hospital, nor the HBCC with 75 community members, has sufficient financial and human resources to meet all of the 31 identified community needs. Many of these needs, which are common in many communities, are significant and are such that society has been working long term to address. However UPMC Altoona has committed resources and efforts, and is working with other community partners, to meet its above identified needs. UPMC Altoona, in partnership with the HBCC, has developed strategies to address its identified community health needs. Although the hospital is not able to address all of the needs identified in Blair County, UPMC Altoona is addressing the identified needs, which will result in healthier individual and families, which will in turn result in an overall healthier community. HBCC Work Group Accomplishments: As part of the implementation strategy to address the county needs identified, the Healthy Blair County Coalition for the following work groups: Healthy Lifestyle, Alcohol and Other Drug Abuse, Mental Health needs of Children and Adolescents, Poverty, and Tobacco-Free Community. The following is a summary of the accomplishments of each work group to date: 1. Healthy Lifestyle: * Adopted the national Let's Move Initiative and held a launch event in 5 communities. Over 380 participants and over 85 volunteers participated in educational and physical activities with the overall message of eating healthy, getting active, and having fun. * The Blair County Commissioners passed a resolution endorsing the Healthy Blair County Coalition concept and supported Blair County becoming a Let's Move Cities, Towns, and Counties site. * In collaboration with the Blair County Chamber of Commerce, a Workplace Wellness Committee hosted two Wake to Wellness events. * A Fuel Up to Play 60 training program was held for local school districts with 27 participants. * A Let's Move Blair county Facebook page has been sharing tips for healthy eating and getting active, including posting events and activities. The address is: facebook.com/letsmoveblaircounty. 2. Alcohol and Other Drug Abuse: * Under the leadership of the Blair County Drug and Alcohol Partnership, a $100,793 grant was secured to partner with two medical clinics (Altoona Family Physicians Residency Program - which is part of UPMC Altoona, and Partnering for Health Services for training and implementation of the evidence-based SBIRT process. This process screens patients for substance abuse as part of routine health care * A protocol was developed for healthcare providers to better understand the drug and alcohol system/resource in Blair County. 3. Mental Health Needs of Children and Adolescents * The Work Group gathered data to better understand the services available to identify, intervene, and provide treatment to children and adolescents within the county. Part of the work group mission is to explore unmet needs and work toward establishing or enhancing programs and services to more effectively serve children and families. 4. Poverty * In cooperation with other community partners, the Bridges Network sponsored and/or assisted with 5 poverty simulations in Blair, Bedford, and Cambria counties. * Members of the work group have worked with and/or expanded programs that provide resources to low-income students at the elementary, secondary, and higher education levels. * Assisted in developing a Fuel Bank Program to more efficiently provide financial assistance to low-income individuals and families. * Bridges Out of Poverty training is available to interested community organizations. * 5. Tobacco-Free Community * The work group developed and distributed a webinar in order to provide information and resources for businesses and organization on how to become 100% tobacco-free workplaces. * The work group conducted a meeting with career services personnel and guidance counselors then developed a second webinar. The purpose was to educate students on issues related to seeking employment in companies that are currently or will be tobacco-free workplaces. In collaboration with the Blair County Drug and Alcohol Partnership, local hospitals, businesses, and other organizations, smoking cessation educational programs have been conducted. Some of the significant community health needs identified in the most recent CHNA are beyond the scope and resources of UPMC Altoona and all of the community partners who are part of the Healthy Blair County Coalition. For example: poverty was identified as a significant community need which may directly impact the health of an individual or family and the HBCC formed a work group to address the issue of poverty - the Poverty Work Group which implemented the Bridges out of Poverty program to address poverty in Blair County. However the issue of poverty remain a significant issue which impact the health of individuals in Blair county. Also other issues, identified in the top 25 community challenge issues, identified in the most recent CHNA which are beyond the resource of UPMC Altoona and the HBCC to address include: lack of jobs, unemployment/underemployment, crime, lack of cultural activities, shortage of recreational facilities, shortage of affordable housing, poor roads and/or traffic conditions, substandard housing, inadequate public transportation, ;lack of affordable care for children, gangs, water or air pollution, and race or ethical discrimination."

The 2014 Healthy Community Study included analysis of various extant data related to demographics, social and economic factors, physical environment, clinical care, healthy behaviors, and health outcomes. In addition, the survey tool that was used targeted the following health related areas: general health, chronic disease/obesity, behavioral health, and maternal/prenatal and early childhood. The latter three areas had been identified in previous studies as priority areas. By focusing on these health related areas, more focused, timely, and longitudinal information will be available to evaluate effects of targeted efforts. In the analysis, some demographic and social and economic deficits were revealed. Specifically, the local community showed deficits around poverty percentages as compared to the state and to the US. In addition, the data revealed deficits in educational attainment rates around high school and college diploma rates as compared to the state. While these are crucial areas that need to be addressed by the community, many other organizations are more knowledgeable and better equipped to develop strategies to improve these areas. Programs and strategies have been and are being developed by a multitude of community organizations to begin to affect the educational attainment and poverty deficits. Some of these organizations include The Rockford Public School System, Rock Valley College, Alignment Rockford, Transform Rockford, Rockford Literacy Council, etc. While Rockford Health System does play a role in supporting these organizations and efforts, our community benefit plan focuses on affecting the health needs/deficits of the local community."

NorthShore has a Community Relations Department, whose personnel serve as points of contact for NorthShore's involvement with community building, partnership development, program building, local governmental advocacy, and outreach activities. Community Relations has developed relationships with local and state government, public health agencies, clergy, business, civic and social service agencies, and school leaders. Through these relationships, Community Relations identified health needs in the NorthShore community by regularly attending events, meetings, community boards, coalitions, consortiums, and one-on-one engagements. NorthShore's senior leadership also regularly participate in outreach programs to local leaders. NorthShore physicians and staff also play an equally important role in identifying health trends and needs through their leadership, board participation, and involvement in local, regional, and national organizations. Each NorthShore hospital has a Community Advisory Committee (CAC) comprised of a range of community leaders representing local public health agencies, non-profit organizations serving low-income residents, faith based groups, governmental agencies, and business and civic leaders. Each hospital's CAC meets quarterly to discuss the health needs in their communities, identifying gaps in delivery of services and providing strategic recommendations to the hospital to address the identified health needs. All four hospital CACs also meet annually to address more global health and healthcare related issues, promoting discussion about policy and services at the local, state and federal levels. The following organizations were represented on the NorthShore CACs while NorthShore conducted the fiscal year 2013 CHNA: Evanston Hospital - Village of Wilmette, CJE Senior Life, Childcare Network of Evanston, McGaw YMCA, Erie Evanston/Skokie Health Center, City of Evanston, North Shore Senior Center, Kenilworth School District 38, Mather LifeWays, Evanston/Skokie School District 65, Shorefront Legacy, New Trier High School, YWCA Evanston Northshore, and Evanston Township High School.

NorthShore also conducted a community health needs focus group, consisting of community leaders and public health experts who provide social services and healthcare within NorthShore's community. Discussions during the focus group centered on what pressing health concerns were present, which healthcare resources were available and not available, and what barriers to healthcare resources existed for individuals in the community. The following organizations were represented in the focus group: Evanston Health Department, City of Evanston, New Trier High School, Kenilworth School District 38, Evanston/Skokie School District 65, North Shore Senior Center, Lake County Health Department, Lake Forest Senior Center, Tri-Con Childcare Center, Northfield Township, Northbrook Police Department, Northbrook YMCA, Skokie Health Department, Erie Family Health Center, Metropolitan Family Services, and the Northwest Suburban United Way."

201632249349301688,362167060,Part V Section B Line 11 - Needs Addressed from the CHNA,"Facility Reporting Group A: Reporting Group A consists of the following hospital facilities: 1 - Evanston Hospital 2 - Glenbrook Hospital 3 - Highland Park Hospital 4 - Skokie Hospital NorthShore University HealthSystem (NorthShore) has implemented a three-fold strategy to address the identified health needs of the communities it serves, which includes: 1) Community benefit programs and partnerships will address a need identified in the Community Health Needs Assessment (CHNA), with a rationale provided for any identified needs not addressed by NorthShore, 2) Community benefit programs, initiatives, and partnerships will address a need requested by the community, and 3) Community benefit programs, initiatives, and partnerships will be aligned with the guiding principles outlined in Advancing the State of the Art of Community Benefits for Nonprofit Hospitals. The guiding principles are: Disproportionate Unmet Health-Related Needs, Primary Prevention, Seamless Continuum of Care, Build Community Capacity, and Community Collaboration. NorthShore places priority on providing community benefits and services in the communities located nearest to our hospitals, where we believe we have the greatest capacity and responsibility to serve. Community health needs data is also used in NorthShore's annual planning processes. Stakeholder participation is critical and influences NorthShore's prioritization and execution of its community benefits programs. In addition, collaboration with local leadership allows NorthShore to detect urgent and growing needs that may not be represented or absent from aggregate data. Lastly, collaboration with local leaders has facilitated the development of programs and partnerships to provide real time solutions to critical health challenges. For the fiscal year 2013 CHNA, NorthShore is evaluating the impact of the initiatives developed to address the identified needs by collecting data on how many individuals utilize components of the initiative. Measurement of the impact will also be assessed by gathering ongoing feedback from the hospitals' Community Advisory Committees, along with feedback from senior and physician leadership. The following needs identified in the fiscal year 2013 CHNA were not addressed by NorthShore: violence prevention, healthy environment (air/water), and tobacco use prevention. NorthShore decided not to address these needs in order to avoid duplication of services with other organizations dedicating resources to these areas. In addition, these needs were not areas of expertise for NorthShore and therefore would not have a measurable, significant impact on these issues. Actions taken during fiscal year 2015 to address the needs identified in the 2013 CHNA include the following NorthShore programs and service areas: The NorthShore Community Health Center at Evanston Hospital provides medical care to adults and children who lack private medical insurance. Medical services include, but are not limited to: primary care, obstetrics/gynecology, general surgery, orthopaedics, diabetes education, and podiatry. In fiscal year 2015, the clinic treated 3,673 adult patients at 10,605 visits. The Dental Center at Evanston Hospital provides primary care dental services and special consultations for medically underserved adult patients, pre-screenings for cardiovascular patients, and management for oral complications in oncology patients and those with refractory dental problems. The Dental Center provided free and discounted care for adult patients making 3,579 visits during fiscal year 2015. Be Well Lake County is a collaboration between NorthShore, Lake County Health Department and Community Health Center, and supporting community partners. The program goal is to build greater access through a coordinated network of healthcare targeting the underserved diabetes population in Lake County. The program enables the partner organizations to effectively pool and maximize resources in order to provide high quality comprehensive diabetes management, education, and support resources that will address one of the nation's fastest growing health threats. NorthShore provides annual funding to support a diabetes management program to 1,111 current patients. The Evanston Township High School Health Center was established as a collaborative partnership with Evanston Township High School, the Evanston Health Department, and NorthShore. The Health Center is a free school-based health clinic staffed by NorthShore employees that provides physical exams, immunizations, treatment of acute and chronic illnesses, health education, gynecological care, and counseling and support groups to students. During the 2014-2015 school year, 664 students made 2,479 visits to the Health Center. NorthShore's Medication Assistance Program helps patients with the cost of paying for prescription drugs. The Medication Assistance Program assisted 2,653 patients in filling 23,121 prescriptions during fiscal year 2015. The Perinatal Depression Program identifies women who are suffering from perinatal depression and offer referrals for women who many need additional support. The program screens women for perinatal depression during and after their pregnancy and offers a 24/7 crisis hotline for women and their family members who may find themselves in an emergent situation. The hotline provides multilingual interpretation services to assist those with limited or no English-speaking ability. All services are provided free of charge. In fiscal year 2015, NorthShore physicians conducted 8,620 screenings to identify at-risk patients, and the hotline received 785 calls. Free psychological support and referrals were provided for 619 women identified through the screenings as at-risk for perinatal mood disorders. NorthShore's Emergency Departments are staffed 24/7 with physicians, nurses, and technicians who are trained to respond to medical emergencies. In addition, Evanston Hospital provides Level One trauma services. During fiscal year 2015, the NorthShore Emergency Departments had a total of 125,183 patient visits. NorthShore's Cardiovascular Center provides comprehensive cardiology services with a combined expertise of cardiologists and cardiac surgeons working together to develop treatment plans designed to provide patients with exceptional heart care including cardiac imaging, cardiovascular surgery, clinical cardiology, electrophysiology, heart failure, interventional cardiology and a women's heart program. During fiscal year 2015, NorthShore hospitals had a total of 121,736 cardiology procedures including open heart surgeries, coronary interventions, echocardiograms, and stress tests. The Kellogg Cancer Center is a cancer treatment center that offers comprehensive, compassionate cancer care and treatments for oncology patients and their families. NorthShore's collaborative cancer treatment model focuses on each patient's individual needs, providing medical, surgical, radiation, psychological, and emotional care. During fiscal year 2015, the Kellogg Cancer Centers at Evanston, Glenbrook, and Highland Park Hospitals had a total of 79,712 patient visits."

The study area for the survey effort is defined by 23 residential ZIP Codes in Connecticut. This assessment incorporated data from both quantitative and qualitative sources. Quantitative data input include primary research and secondary research. The survey instrument used for this study was based largely on the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) Behavioral Risk Factor Surveillance System (BRFSS), as well as various other public health surveys and customized questions addressing gaps in indicator data relative to health promotion and disease prevention objectives and other recognized health issues. To ensure the best representation of the population surveyed, a telephone interview methodology - one that incorporates both landline and cell phone interviews - was employed. The sample design used for this effort consisted of a random sample of 798 individuals age 18 and older in the Hospital of Central CT service area. Because the study was part of a larger effort involving multiple regions and hospital service areas, the surveys were distributed among various strata. Once the interviews were completed, these were weighted in proportion to the actual population distribution so as to appropriately represent the Hartford Region as a whole.A variety of existing (secondary) data sources was consulted to complement the research quality of the Community Health Needs Assessment.Part V, Section B, Line 7ahttp://www.thocc.org/health-community/community-health-needs-assessment"

Key informants were contacted by email, introducing the purpose of the survey and providing a link to take a survey online. Key informants were asked to rate the degrees to which various health issues were a problem in the Hartford Region. Follow-up questions asked them to describe why they identified areas as such, and how these might be better addressed. The Hospital of Central CT recognizes that it cannot measure all possible aspects of health in the community, nor can it adequately represent all possible populations of interest. In terms of content, the assessment was designed to provide a comprehensive and broad picture of the health of the overall community. The CHNA analysis and report yielded a wealth of information about the health status, behaviors and needs for our population. A distinct advantage of the primary quantitative (survey) research is the ability to segment findings by geographic, demographic and health characteristics to identify the primary and chronic disease needs and other health issues of vulnerable populations, such as uninsured persons, low-income persons, and racial/ethnic minority groups. For additional statistics about uninsured, low-income, and minority health needs please refer to the complete Community Health Needs Assessment report, which can be viewed online at: http://thocc.org/health-community/community-health-needs-assessment After reviewing the Community Health Needs Assessment findings, the community representatives met on June 10, 2015 to determine the health needs to be prioritized for action. During a detailed presentation of the CHNA findings, we used audience response system (ARS) technologies to lead steering committee members through a process of understanding key local data findings (Areas of Opportunity) and ranking identified health issues against the following established, uniform criteria: Magnitude, Impact/Seriousness/Feasibility, Consequences of Inaction. From this exercise, the areas of opportunity were prioritized as follows by the committee: Mental Health, Nutrition, Physical Activity & Weight Status, Diabetes, Substance Abuse, Cancer, Heart Disease and Stroke."

Healthy Roanoke Valley (HRV), housed under the United Way of Roanoke Valley, was formed in 2012 as a community response to needs identified in Carilion Clinic's triennial Roanoke Valley CHNA.In June 2015, the CHAT participated in a prioritization activity to determine the greatest needs in the service area based on the primary and secondary data collected during the assessment period. To quantitatively determine health needs, CHAT members were asked to rank the top ten pertinent community needs, with one being the most pertinent. Next, on a scale of 1-5, CHAT members were ask to assign a feasibility and potential impact score for each of the ranked needs. This information was used for the CHAT strategic planning retreat held in August 2015.The top ten priority areas that emerged from these findings include:1. Poor eating habits / lack of nutrient dense foods in diet 2. Access to mental health counseling / substance abuse 3. Access to adult dental care 4. Access to dental care for children 5. Lack of exercise / physical activity 6. Value not placed on preventive care and chronic disease management 7. Access to primary care 8. High prevalence of obesity / overweight individuals 9. Lack of knowledge of community resources 10. Improved coordination of care across the health and human sectorThe CHAT participated in strategic planning on August 31, 2015. It reviewed and accepted the priority areas of access to services (primary care, mental health & substance abuse, and oral health), coordination of care, and wellness. Expected outcomes were approved by the CHAT and will be used by CMC to measure impact around the priority areas. Significant Health Needs to be AddressedCMC plans to address key community health needs identified in the 2015 assessment by focusing its efforts on a particular community, one that emerged with the greatest need. Through greater access to clinical care, enhanced community outreach programs, creative community partnerships and focused financial and in-kind support of initiatives, CMC plans to improve community health in the South East neighborhood of Roanoke City. Key focus areas of this health improvement project over the next three years include access to services, coordination of care and wellness.A. Access to Services:CMC will explore the development of a community health center in South East with the goal of increasing access to primary care, urgent care and dental services in the neighborhood. The center may also include a mix of services to address social determinants of health, such as job training, health education and wellness services. This offering will be planned with and provided by community partners, including the City of Roanoke, safety net providers and private businesses.B. Coordination of Care:Carilion's family practices have adopted the medical home model and have added care coordinators to proactively work with its high risk, chronic care patients. Carilion will take a focused approach on the South East patients, integrating medical home approaches with a planned community coordination hub being developed by Healthy Roanoke Valley. C. Wellness:Carilion's Community Outreach staff will provide education, flu shots, and community health screenings to the target population in the South East community. Education includes free interactive presentations on the topics of cancer prevention, diabetes prevention, fitness/exercise, food safety, health/stroke, healthy lifestyles, nutrition, smoking cessation, and stress. Poor eating habits were identified as a key concern in the 2015 RVCHNA. The Carilion Clinic Healthy Food Program (formed to respond to the 2012 RVCHNA) is designed to address this need by promoting healthy, local (when possible), and nutrient-dense food to patients and employees and to encourage healthy eating in the community. Fresh Foods RX, is a partnership with HRV, a program which includes a physician's prescription for healthy food and a waiver for free local fruits and vegetables will be implemented. The Healthier Hospital Healthy Food Initiative, the Carilion Farm Share program, and funding of community programs that address increased access to healthy food will continue.Exercise and fitness opportunities will be a key focus for South East, particularly in relation to childhood obesity. Through a partnership with a local soccer club, Carilion will help build fields in the southeast neighborhood and provide scholarships to local children. Carilion is also helping to build a community kayak launch on the Roanoke River with access in that neighborhood.D. Focused Community Grants and Partnerships:Carilion Clinic funds health safety-net providers and causes identified through the RVCHNA and will focus on providing financial support to community health improvement initiatives in the SE neighborhood through community grants and sponsorships.In-kind assistance is also provided through community partnerships that align with the RVCHNA. Carilion actively looks for opportunities to support by providing outreach and educational support. Partnerships include HRV, the YMCA Diabetes Prevention Program, Anchor of Hope's Community Health Promoter Program, West End Freedom First, Roanoke Regional Housing Authority, Kohl's Cares, the PATH Coalition, Safe Kids, Leap for Local Foods, the Feeding America of SWVA Veggie Mobile, as well as many others. E. Implementation and Measurement:HRV is serving as a key partner in the implementation of health improvement initiatives emerging from the CHNA. The findings of this assessment are key in measuring the progress of HRV initiatives and their impact in the community. The HRV Strategic Action Framework to better meet the needs of our target population includes data driven, evidence-based goals and strategies which address access to care (mental health, oral health, primary care); coordination of care; and wellness. As a result of the 2015 RVCHNA, HRV is undergoing strategic planning with both its Steering Committee and Action Team members to update the Governance Guidelines, Operations Structure, and Strategic Action Framework to ensure HRV continues to align with the priorities identified in the needs assessment. HRV anticipates completing this process in the Spring of 2016 and will begin implementation of the 2016-2019 Strategic Action Framework in the Summer of 2016.Priority Areas Not being Addressed and the ReasonsA community approach to determine and address priority needs as described earlier in this document was used in determining which needs cannot be addressed immediately.

The study area for the survey effort is defined by 16 residential ZIP codes in Connecticut. The population of the hospital's service area is estimated at 270,183 people. It is predominantly non-Hispanic White (81.8%), and has an Hispanic population of (10.4%). The poverty descriptions and segmentation used in the needs assessment report were based on administrative poverty thresholds determined by the US Department of Health & Human Services.This assessment incorporated data from both quantitative and qualitative sources. Quantitative data input include primary research and secondary research. The survey instrument used for this study was based largely on the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) Behavioral Risk Factor Surveillance System (BRFSS), as well as various other public health surveys and customized questions addressing gaps in indicator data relative to health promotion and disease prevention objectives and other recognized health issues.To ensure the best representation of the population surveyed, a telephone interview methodology - one that incorporates both landline and cell phone interviews - was employed. The sample design used for this effort consisted of a random sample of 579 individuals age 18 and older in the Windham Community Memorial Hospital service area. Because the study was part of a larger effort involving multiple regions and hospital service areas, the surveys were distributed among various strata. Once the interviews were completed, these were weighted in proportion to the actual population distribution so as to appropriately represent the Hartford Region as a whole. A variety of existing (secondary) data sources was consulted to complement the research quality of the Community Health Needs Assessment.Part V, Section B, Line 7a:http://www.windhamhospital.org/about-us/community-health-needs-assessment"

American Red Cross Blood Services Backus Hospital Catholic Charities Generations Family Health Center, Inc. Mohegan Tribe Norwich Adult Education Reliance House, Inc. Rose City Senior Center Southeastern Regional Action Council St. Vincent de Paul Place Norwich Three Rivers Community College Nursing Program Town of Windham TVCCA Uncas Health District United Community and Family Services Windham Community Memorial Hospital Windham Region No Freeze Project Participants were chosen because of their ability to identify primary concerns of the populations with whom they work, as well as of the community overall. Key informants were contacted by email, introducing the purpose of the survey and providing a link to take a survey online. Key informants were asked to rate the degrees to which various health issues were a problem in the Hartford Region. Follow-up questions asked them to describe why they identified areas as such, and how these might be better addressed. Windham Community Memorial Hospital recognizes that it cannot measure all possible aspects of health in the community, nor can it adequately represent all possible populations of interest. In terms of content, the assessment was designed to provide a comprehensive and broad picture of the health of the overall community. The CHNA analysis and report yielded a wealth of information about the health status, behaviors and needs for our population. A distinct advantage of the primary quantitative (survey) research is the ability to segment findings by geographic, demographic and health characteristics to identify the primary and chronic disease needs and other health issues of vulnerable populations, such as uninsured persons, low-income persons, and racial/ethnic minority groups. For additional statistics about uninsured, low-income, and minority health needs please refer to the complete Community Health Needs Assessment report, which can be viewed online at: windhamhospital.org/health-community /community-health-care-needs-assessmentAfter reviewing the Community Health Needs Assessment findings, the community representatives met on June 11, 2015 to determine the health needs to be prioritized for action. During a detailed presentation of the CHNA findings, we used audience response system (ARS) technologies to lead steering committee members through a process of understanding key local data findings (Areas of Opportunity) and ranking identified health issues against the following established, uniform criteria: Magnitude, Impact/Seriousness/Feasibility, Consequences of Inaction. From this exercise, the areas of opportunity were prioritized as follows by the committee: Mental Health, Nutrition, Physical Activity & Weight Status, Diabetes, Substance Abuse, Cancer, Heart Disease and Stroke."

In addition, formal collaboratives have been formed, and system-wide initiatives have been launched that address nutrition education such as our partnership with a statewide super market retailer. In acknowledging the wide range of priority health issues that emerged from the CHNA process, Windham Community Memorial Hospital determined that it could only effectively focus on those which it deemed most pressing, most under-addressed, and most within its ability to influence: * Nutrition, physical activity & weight (obesity), cancer, diabetes, heart disease & stroke, and respiratory diseases* Access to Care, including oral health, dementias, and Alzheimer's Disease* Mental Health & Substance Use, including tobacco useHealth Priorities Not Chosen for Action Reason - None.Together with the community partners, Windham Hospital plans to address all of the issues identified in the CHNA using a community-wide collaborative approach.Sch H Part V, Line 9:Although the approved implementation strategy date reflects the 2014 tax year, the implementation strategy was approved in December 2015.

Based upon factors including family size & income, patients were eligible to receive write-offs ranging between 25 - 100%.The Hospital Financial Assistance Policy (effective January 1, 2016) is compliant with IRS Code Sec. 501R. Per the Hospital's policy, no individual who is determined to be eligible for financial assistance will be charged more for emergency or other medically necessary care than the amount generally billed to individuals who have insurance covering such care. The basis to which any discount is applied is equivalent to the billed charges posted to a patient account minus any prior insurance payments and adjustments from the patient's insurance (if applicable). Starting January 1, 2016, the Hospital used the IRS 501R prescribed methodology to compute self-pay discount (AGB discount). The Hospital calculates AGB based on a retrospective or look back review of amounts allowed by governmental (Medicare, Medicaid, etc.) and commercial insurances."

Interviews were conducted with public health experts, representatives of health, social services, or other departments or agencies, community leaders, health care providers, and persons representing the broad interests of the community. The interviews were structured to help identify the most pressing health status and access issues in the community. BMC also sought input from the public regarding the health of the community through an online and paper-based survey. A website link to the survey (in both English and Spanish) was made available from January through February 2013. Paper copies of the survey were distributed at various local organizations and clinics in multiple languages. Efforts were made to reach those without internet access as well as vulnerable populations such as racial and ethnic minorities, low-income groups, individuals with low literacy levels, and non-English speakers. The survey was publicized via flyers, social media, human services organizations, boards of health, newspapers, email listservs, and other methods. A listening session was held during which community members reviewed and discussed preliminary findings from this assessment. Discussion at the listening session was helpful in that it validated assessment findings and contributed to the prioritization process. The survey consisted of 48 questions about a range of health status and access issues and respondent demographic characteristics. 1,321 residents from the Baystate community completed the survey. Seventy-four percent of respondents were female and 49 percent were between the ages of 45 and 64. Seventy-two percent were White and 98 percent did not identify as Hispanic (or Latino). The majority of respondents reported being in good or very good overall health (70 percent), married (50 percent), employed full time (61 percent), privately insured (67 percent), and having an undergraduate degree or higher (53 percent). The majority (83 percent) of respondents speak English in the home. Spanish was the top non-English language reported. Seven percent of respondents reported that they spoke multiple languages at home. Survey responses were received from residents of 43 of the Baystate community's 51 ZIP codes. Although the survey garnered many respondents, the sample is not representative of the community and the results are not generalizable to the community as a whole. 1,321 residents in Baystate's community responded to the community survey. Key informant interviews were conducted face-to-face and by telephone by Mark Rukavina, Principal at Community Health Advisors, LLC. The interviews were designed to gain perspective into health needs in the community served by Baystate. A total of 39 local key informants, including external and internal stakeholders (those affiliated or employed by Baystate Medical Center) were interviewed during December 2012 through February 2013. In addition, 10 staff members from the Massachusetts Department of Public Health regional office in Northampton also were interviewed as a part of this assessment. These interviews were conducted using a structured questionnaire. Informants were asked to discuss community health issues and encouraged to look broadly at the social determinants of health. Interviewees were asked about issues related to health care access, changes in community population, prevalence of chronic health conditions, and health disparities. The frequency with which community health issues was mentioned and the interviewees' perceptions of the significance of each concern were assessed.The 49 stakeholders were comprised of public health experts; individuals from health or other departments and agencies; leaders or representatives of medically underserved, low-income, and minority populations; and other community members.

Baystate Noble Hospital and Health New England were not a part of the Coalition during the initial formation in 2012. Following feedback from key community stakeholders during the community health needs assessment process, the Coalition has taken its unique collaboration to the next level by identifying a shared health priority that it will address in partnership across the region. The shared health priority the Coalition selected was behavioral health."

201602249349302325,042790311,Baystate Medical Center,"Part V, Section B, Line 11: The CHNA report also described collaborating organizations. BMC collaborated with each of the hospital facilities that are members of the Coalition of Western Massachusetts Hospitals for its CHNA. BMC also collaborated with organizations that participated in a ""Design Team"" established by the Coalition. Representatives from the Collaborative for Community Health, Inc., the Franklin Regional Council of Governments, the Massachusetts Department of Public Health, and the Springfield Department of Health and Human Services participated on this Team. Many individuals provided input for this assessment. Lists of interviewees are included in the report.In partnership with the Coalition of Western MA Hospitals, Baystate Medical Center conducted its most recent community health needs assessment (CHNA) in 2013 of the geographic areas served by the hospital pursuant to the requirements of the MA Attorney General's Community Benefit Guidelines and Section 501(r) of the Internal Revenue Code (""Section 501(r)""). The CHNA findings were made available on the hospital's website in September 2013. Per the Internal Revenue Service (IRS) and the Massachusetts Office of the Attorney General, each non-profit hospital must conduct a formal community health needs assessment (CHNA) every three-years in partnership with community organizations and individuals across the hospital's service area. The aim is to identify community assets as well as the critical gaps/needs in public health resources and the weak connections between medical care and community care. This ""gaps analysis"" assists Baystate Health's Board of Trustees and senior managers in developing community benefit policy, which targets our charitable resources in focused areas. These areas frame existing community benefit programs, assist in transforming community service activities to comply with the IRS and MA Attorney General's criteria, and set priorities in the design of new programs. The CHNA is the basis for developing accountable community benefit programs. In an ideal situation, an effective and large scale community benefit program will demonstrate measurable community impacts on the health status and quality of life for residents - effectively closing gaps when current data is compared to initial CHNA baseline indicators. At a more practical program level, the CHNA guides a ""theory of change"" - linking health needs to community benefit efforts to desired program and community outcomes. BMC's CHNA began by identifying the communities served by the hospital. Findings are based on various quantitative analyses regarding health-related needs in those areas, a review of health assessments conducted by other organizations in recent years, information obtained from interviews, and findings from a community survey. Preliminary assessment findings were discussed with community stakeholders during a series of ""listening sessions and feedback from participants helped validate findings. Finally, The Coalition applied a ranking methodology to help prioritize the community health needs identified by the assessment. Including multiple data sources and stakeholder views is important when assessing the level of consensus that exists regarding priority community health needs. If alternative data sources including interviews support similar conclusions, then confidence is increased regarding the most problematic health needs in a community. Further information about the analytic methods and prioritization process and criteria can be found in the CHNA report. The list that follows describes the health needs identified throughout the assessment as priorities in the community served by Baystate Medical Center. These needs are presented in alphabetical order, by category. The prioritized list identifies the 15 most problematic community health needs found by this assessment. Needs were determined by synthesizing findings from multiple data sources.Access to CareLack of Affordable and Accessible Medical CareNeed for Care Coordination and Culturally Sensitive Care Dental HealthLack of Access to Dental Care Health BehaviorsHigh Rates of Alcohol, Tobacco, and Drug Use High Rates of Unsafe Sex, Teen Pregnancy, and Chlamydia Maternal and Child HealthPrevalent Infant Health Risk Factors (e.g., smoking during pregnancy, lack of prenatal care) Pediatric DisabilityMental HealthLack of Access to Mental Health Services and Poor Mental Health Status Use Morbidity and MortalityHigh Rates of Diet and Exercise-Related Diseases and Mortality High Rates of Asthma Racial and Ethnic Disparities in Disease Morbidity and Mortality Physical EnvironmentPoor Community Safety (e.g., homicide and other violent crimes) Poor Built Environment and Environmental Quality (e.g., air quality, presence of food deserts) Social and Economic FactorsBasic Needs Insecurity: Financial Hardship, Housing, and Food Access Low Educational AchievementNo community hospital facility can address all of the health needs present in its community. BMC is committed to adhering to its mission and remaining financially healthy so that it can continue to enhance its clinical excellence and to provide a wide range of community benefits. The Strategy does not address the following community health needs identified in the 2013 CHNA due to no new funding or resources, other hospitals or community organizations within service area are already addressing the need or the need falls outside of the hospitals' mission or capacity.Racial and Ethnic Disparities in Disease Morbidity and Mortality: the hospital understands the connection between institutional racism and ethnic and racial health disparities and has committed DoN resources (see Section C and Appendix A of BMC Implementation Strategy) to fund local undoing racism education and training. Lack of Access to Dental Care: pediatric dental access is being addressed through Partners for aHealthier Community's BEST Oral Health Initiative (see Section 4b of BMC Implementation Strategy). High Rates of Alcohol, Tobacco, and Drug Use: a variety of existing community-based non-profits and agencies are addressing these needs, including, but not limited to: Behavioral Health Net, Center for Human Development, City of Springfield Tobacco Program, Gandara, and the Mason Square Drug Free Task Force. High Rates of Unsafe Sex, Teen Pregnancy, and Chlamydia: Teen pregnancy is being addressed through the efforts of the YEAH! Network and the Springfield Pregnant and Parenting Teens Collaborative (see Section 4b of BMC Implementation Strategy) as well as the City of Springfield's Springfield Adolescent Sexual Health Advisory Committee and the Community Health Network Area #4's Springfield Adolescent Health Project. Pediatric Disability: hospital clinicians and staff co-lead and participate in the Medical Home Workgroup for Children with Special Needs. As part of its regular service line, the hospital has a new Developmental and Behavioral Pediatrics Department (see section 6 of BMC Implementation Strategy). High Rates of Asthma: being addressed through Partners for a Healthier Community and the Pioneer Valley Asthma Coalition (see Section 4b of BMC Implementation Strategy). Poor Built Environment and Environmental Quality: being addressed through Partners for a Healthier Community's Live Well Springfield and Healthy Environment, Healthy Springfield Initiatives (see Section 4b of BMC Implementation Strategy)."

Patients must request the discount. The discount cannot be combined with the Hospital Supplemental Financial Assistance Program. Baystate Medical Center offers a co-payment discount program for the patients receiving services in the emergency department of the hospital. This discount program is available to all hospital emergency department patients with co-payment obligations under private or government health insurance (unless prohibited by law or a Baystate Medical Center's contract with a private insurer or government authority). These patients may reduce the otherwise applicable emergency department service co-payment by 10% if the patient elects to pay the co-payment at the conclusion of the patient's emergency department visit."

When applicable, BMC may also assist patients in applying for coverage of services as a Medical Hardship based on the patient's documented income and allowable medical expenses. BMC has contracted with the Executive Office of Health and Human Services and the Commonwealth Health Insurance Connector Authority to serve as a Certified Application Couselor Organization. As a Certified Application Counselor (CAC), appropriate staff will inform a patient of the functions and responsibility of a CAC, seek that the patient sign a Certified Application Counselor Designation Form, and assist the patient in finding applicable financial assistance."

THE CHNA GATHERED INPUT FROM REPRESENTATIVES OF THE COMMUNITY BY CONDUCTING 30-MINUTE TELEPHONE HEALTH SURVEYS IN ENGLISH AND SPANISH. 3,710 SURVEYS WERE CONDUCTED IN THE REGION WHICH CONSISTED OF COOK, DUPAGE AND LAKE COUNTIES, WITH 325 IN THE HOSPITAL'S IMMEDIATE SERVICE AREA. CAREFUL CONSIDERATION WAS TAKEN TO ENSURE THAT THE DEMOGRAPHICS OF THOSE PARTICIPATING IN THE SURVEY MIRRORED THE DEMOGRAPHICS OF THE COMMUNITY. THE SURVEY INSTRUMENT USED FOR THE STUDY IS BASED LARGELY ON THE CENTERS FOR DISEASE CONTROL AND PREVENTION (CDC) BEHAVIORAL RISK FACTOR SURVEILLANCE SYSTEM (BRFSS), AS WELL AS VARIOUS OTHER PUBLIC HEALTH SURVEYS AND CUSTOMIZED QUESTIONS ADDRESSING GAPS IN INDICATOR DATA RELATIVE TO HEALTH PROMOTION AND DISEASE PREVENTION OBJECTIVES AND OTHER RECOGNIZED HEALTH ISSUES. THE FINAL SURVEY INSTRUMENT WAS DEVELOPED BY PRC, WITH INPUT FROM THE HOSPITAL AND THE OTHER COMMUNITY SPONSORS. ISSUES ADDRESSED INCLUDED SELF-REPORTED HEALTH STATUS, PHYSICAL HEALTH STATUS, MENTAL HEALTH STATUS, DEATH AND DISABILITY, INFECTION AND CHRONIC DISEASE, BIRTHS, CHILDREN'S HEALTH STATUS, MODIFIABLE HEALTH RISKS, ACCESS TO HEALTHCARE, HEALTH EDUCATION AND OUTREACH, AND HEALTH INFORMATION SOURCES. TO SOLICIT INPUT FROM KEY INFORMANTS, THOSE INDIVIDUALS WHO HAVE A BROAD INTEREST IN THE HEALTH OF THE COMMUNITY, AN ONLINE KEY INFORMANT SURVEY WAS IMPLEMENTED AS PART OF THE CHNA PROCESS. A LIST OF RECOMMENDED PARTICIPANTS WAS PROVIDED BY MCHC; THIS LIST INCLUDED NAMES AND CONTACT INFORMATION FOR PHYSICIANS, PUBLIC HEALTH REPRESENTATIVES, OTHER HEALTH PROFESSIONALS, SOCIAL SERVICE PROVIDERS, AND A VARIETY OF OTHER COMMUNITY LEADERS.

An electronic survey using Survey Monkey was developed and administered by CHS to 495 community members and partners.Individuals were invited to participate based on their ability to represent: underserved, low-income and minority population needs; needs of chronically ill patients; and awareness of healthcare needs in their respective communities. A total of 139 (28%) responded, though not all participants completed each question. Participants represented over 60 agencies from across the primary service area, including concerned citizens, faith community leaders, free clinics, physicians, elected officials and governmental servants. Participants were asked to share their viewpoints on:- Important health concerns in the community;- Significant service gaps in the community; - Ideas for addressing concerns and service gaps.To gauge importance of various health concerns, respondents were asked to identify issues of community concern from a list modified from topics in Healthy People 2010. Respondents were able to enter additional concerns in an open-ended response item. Participants were also asked to review a list of services typically important to addressing health concerns. Respondents were then asked to indicate services that needed to be strengthened in terms of availability, access, or quality. Open-ended response items were provided for participants to indicate additional service gaps in the community and ideas for addressing concerns and service gaps.Priority NeedsMultiple meetings were conducted with various constituents to assist in prioritizing needs and receiving feedback on the Community Health Needs Assessment. One of the meetings warrants additional descriptions because of its unique contribution to the process. The Bon Secours Richmond CHNA Community Review session covered all four hospitals, and was facilitated by Becky Clay Christensen with The Clay Christensen Group. This review included: Medical Directors and an Associate Medical Director covering Health Departments for four jurisdictions; Health Department Registered Nurses from two jurisdictions; a Chief Operating Officer of a Free Clinic; an Executive Director of a Federally Qualified Health Center; an Executive Director for Community Health Services; the Director of Richmond Promise Neighborhoods. In addition to these community health leaders, the following internal leaders also participated: the Senior Vice President of Sponsorship for Bon Secours Richmond; the Administrative Director for Community Health Services; the Administrative Director for Advocacy; a Manager for Evaluation and Sustainability; a Manager for Community Nutrition; two Healthy Community Liaisons. After hearing a presentation on initial findings, which included secondary and survey data, this group discussed and made ""dot choices"" by distributing dots on issues from the report and raised by the group."
201631949349301163,541744931,"Memorial Regional Medical Center, Inc.","Part V, Section B, Line 11: The Implementation Plan focuses on three broad areas including Health Prevention and Promotion, Access to Health Care, and Support Services. A focus in the area of Health Prevention and Promotion is access to and preparation of healthy food. Multiple community partnerships advance this work including provision of fresh produce in identified food deserts, creation of community gardens in underserved neighborhoods and nutrition instruction in school and community settings. Over 11,500 community members were engaged in nutrition activities.Access to Health Care addresses the needs of the uninsured in the greater metropolitan Richmond area. The mobile health program, Care-A-Van, provides culturally competent primary care services to the uninsured in collaboration with 21 church partners. Over 19,000 patient visits were rendered in FY 2015. Bon Secours also supports the free clinic safety net by providing financial support, lab services and in-kind inpatient and outpatient services.Healthy Beginnings is an example of a Support Service focused on prenatal, postpartum and newborn care. Assistance is provided to women helping them identify and access resources to support their pregnancy. Services include Medicaid enrollment, parenting classes and nutritional support (WIC) among others.Dental Care/Oral HealthDental Care was identified in the CHNA community survey as a gap. Oral health is important because it can impact general health. Multiple community organizations are engaged in providing dental care services to the uninsured. They include Virginia Commonwealth University's School of Dentistry, Daily Planet, FQHC, Vernon J. Harris FQHC Dental Clinic, CrossOver Ministry and Goochland Free Clinic and Family Services. As such Bon Secours will not be addressing dental needs at this time.Transportation Other community organizations are better positioned to provide transportation. The Greater Richmond Transit Authority (GRTC) serves the City of Richmond and Henrico County. They have 186 buses and 40 routes. Each bus is equipped with a wheel chair lift. GRTC serves the Richmond Community Hospital campus.GRTC CARE service provides curb-to-curb public transportation to disabled individuals who may not be reasonably able to use the GRTC fixed route bus. It is also available for persons aged 80 or older. Richmond Community Hospital provides limited patient transportation. Patients who reside within a 10-mile radius of the hospital may utilize the patient transport van to reach the hospital campus. This service includes behavioral health patients.Lack of adequate transportation can be a barrier to accessing health care services. The Bon Secours Care-A-Van is a mobile health outreach program providing primary care services in local neighborhoods in the Richmond Community Hospital service area. The Care-A-Van contributes to the elimination of transportation as a barrier to care for uninsured patients."

The gaps to be addressed include the following:-Expanding services to treat addiction in individuals aged 55 and older;-Establishing additional outpatient treatment facilities within the service area-Offering children's services to the community-Presenting education on addiction, treatment, and recovery-Providing training on marijuana and options for prevention, intervention, and treatment; and-Addressing the opioid epidemic in the state of California through advocacy, prevention, education, and treatmentThe strategy to expand services to those age 55 and older calls for the development and implementation of a business plan to expand services for older adults through the ""Recovery@60Plus Program."" The second strategy being considered is the collaboration with senior housing communities and/or agencies in and around Betty Ford Center to enchance awareness of the signs and symptoms of prescription drug addiction and alcoholism.In addressing the needs of additional outpatient service facilities within the service area, Betty Ford Center has created a business plan to expand services in the San Diego area and will continue to assess the need for outpatient services in the area.The next area of significant need is the offering of children's services to the community. The strategy is to collaborate with schools and school districts in the service area to reach more students. The other tactic is to expand opportunities for impacted children to attend Children's Pograms through scholarship programs. The Children's Program is funded entirely through donor support.The fourth priority is to educate the community on addiction, treatment, and recovery which as a three pronged plan:-Expand the community service programming for both the surrounding outreach and online communities by sponsoring 6-8 Awareness Hour programs per year on various topics as they relate to addiction.-Feature internal and external experts in their field as speakers; and-Provide educational materials and online resources for all individuals.The next priority is to provide training and education on marijuana and options for prevention, intervention and treatment which will be accomplished by serving as a resource and promote materials being developed by the wider Hazelden Betty Ford Foundation for different audiences to better understand and address the use and legalization of marijuana. The organization will also facilitate ""thought leaders"" to provide education on marijuana, its medical uses, and options for prevention, intervention, and treatment.The final priority is to address the opioid epidemic in state of California. This will be accomplished by providing broad-based advocacy efforts and community education to address the opioid crisis. The organization will mobilize the local communities on prevention, intervention, and referral to treatment strategies to impact the opioid epidemic. Education will also be provided on both the community and professional level about the proven track record of the evidence-based Comprehensive Opioid Response with Twelve Steps treament protocol along with training for other treatment providers."

Betty Ford Center calculates the amount generally billed by multiplying the gross charges for any emergency or other medically necessary care it provides to a patient aid eligible individual by a percentage calculated based upon all claims paid in full to the hospital facility by private health insurers and the individuals they insured over a specified 12-month period, divided by the associated gross charges for those claims. Medicare and Medicad are not accepted at Betty Ford Center so private insurance is the only available method to determine amounts billed."

A hospital task force considered the data and identified areas of significant needs to be addressed, as well as areas of need unable to be addressed by the hospital. An implementation strategy was presented and adopted by the hospitals board of directors. The Implementation Strategy consists of actions the hospital intends to take to address the health need. Programs/resources the hospital plans to commit to address the health need were identified along with planned collaborations with other area organizations.3h To assure broad representation of the communitys interests, key public health and healthcare partners were engaged and consulted throughout the design and implementation phase of the 2014 CHNA. Qualitative Stakeholder Surveys were distributed to public and community health representatives who directly serve the communities interests. Sampling was monitored throughout the survey dissemination to assure a minimum threshold of respondents providing local insight to priority community health needs and opportunities. Survey outreach was conducted by the local hospital, partner healthcare facilities in the same region, the local public health liaison, and a local comprehensive community health coalition.3i The 2014 CHNA report presents findings of three sets of data, by county. The data sets include absolute indicators of health status as gathered in 2010 using BRFSS and other primary source data gathered using empirical methods; A qualitative stakeholder survey conducted in 2014 and 2014 County Health Rankings indicator set. The qualitative stakeholder survey was disseminated broadly to public health and community stakeholders who serve local populations. As such, the Community Health Needs Assessment does not provide for random assignment of survey respondents, nor does it attempt to function as a surveillance instrument. Limitations aside, taken together, the data provide a unique perspective on the health of Maine communities, with a focus on the social, environmental, and clinical factors which influence the ability of populations to lead healthy lives."

THE TAX YEAR 2012 ASSESSMENT WAS PLANNED IN COLLABORATION WITH THE FOLLOWING COMMUNITY PARTNERS: THE VERMONT DEPARTMENT OF HEALTH, THE VISITING NURSE ASSOCIATION OF CHITTENDEN AND GRAND ISLE COUNTIES AND THE COMMUNITY HEALTH CENTERS OF BURLINGTON. Interviews with seventeen key leaders in our community were completed in the initial phase of the work, with the leaders answering questions about healthy communities, unmet needs, important health issues, barriers, and the range of available community services and they offered recommendations for improving the quality of life for residents. These leaders were selected based on various age groups served (seniors, children, adults, families, for example) as well as a mix of subject areas (low-income, refugees, mental health, substance abuse, for example). The Leaders represented: human service agencies (C.I.D.E.R., HUNGER FREE VERMONT, MILTON FAMILY CENTER, SPECTRUM, UNITED WAY OF CHITTENDEN COUNTY, VISITING NURSE ASSOCIATION OF CHITTENDEN AND GRAND ISLE COUNTIES), state departments of health, federally qualified community health centers (COMMUNITY HEALTH CENTERS OF BURLINGTON), schools (WINOOSKI SCHOOL DISTRICT), law enforcement (BURLINGTON POLICE DEPARTMENT), state agencies (VERMONT DEPARTMENT OF HEALTH, VERMONT AGENCY OF HUMAN SERVICES, VERMONT OFFICE OF MINORITY HEALTH), local funders (UNITED WAY OF CHITTENDEN COUNTY, VERMONT HEALTH FOUNDATION), health care, mental health care (HOWARD CENTER), youth services (HOWARD CENTER, SPECTRUM, MILTON FAMILY CENTER) and senior services (VISITING NURSE ASSOCIATION OF CHITTENDEN AND GRAND ISLE COUNTIES).

THE CHNA INCLUDED BOTH QUALITATIVE AND QUANTITATIVE DATA COLLECTION METHODS. QUALITATIVE DATA WERE COLLECTED THROUGH BOTH A KEY INFORMANT ONLINE SURVEY AND SIX FOCUS GROUPS. TWO HUNDRED FIVE COMMUNITY LEADERS, PARTNERS AND HEALTH CARE PROVIDERS PARTICIPATED IN THE ONLINE KEY INFORMANT SURVEY. TWO FOCUS GROUPS WITH HEALTHCARE PROVIDERS WERE HELD AT EACH OF THE HOSPITALS; 24 HEALTH CARE PROVIDERS PARTICIPATED. FOUR FOCUS GROUPS WERE HELD AT NEIGHBORHOOD ASSOCIATIONS IN WATERBURY; 33 LOCAL RESIDENTS PARTICIPATED. QUANTITATIVE DATA WERE COLLECTED THROUGH A STATISTICAL HOUSEHOLD TELEPHONE SURVEY OF 1,100 PEOPLE IN THE SAINT MARY'S SERVICE AREA. THE STATISTICAL HOUSEHOLD SURVEY WAS BASED ON THE BEHAVIORAL RISK FACTOR SURVEILLANCE SYSTEM (BRFSS) STUDY DEVELOPED BY THE CENTERS FOR DISEASE CONTROL AND PREVENTION (CDC). THE SURVEY ASSESSED INDICATORS SUCH AS GENERAL HEALTH STATUS, PREVENTION ACTIVITIES (SCREENINGS, ETC.) AND RISK BEHAVIORS (ALCOHOL USE, ETC.). THE RESULTS WERE EXAMINED BY A VARIETY OF DEMOGRAPHIC INDICATORS INCLUDING AGE AND GENDER. SPECIAL ATTENTION WAS GIVEN TO IDENTIFYING THE NEEDS OF UNDERSERVED INDIVIDUALS, INCLUDING LOW-INCOME, MINORITY, AND CHRONIC CONDITION POPULATIONS IN THE SAINT MARY'S SERVICE AREA. IN ADDITION TO THE HOUSEHOLD SURVEY, SECONDARY DATA WERE ALSO ANALYZED AS PART OF THE CHNA.

THE SELECTED PRIORITIES ARE (1) ACCESS TO CARE; (2) MENTAL HEALTH AND SUBSTANCE ABUSE; (3) CHRONIC DISEASES - OBESITY, DIABETES, HEART DISEASE AND ASTHMA; AND (4) SMOKING. SAINT MARY'S HAS AN ANNUAL STRATEGIC PLANNING PROCESS THAT IDENTIFIES UNMET COMMUNITY NEEDS WHILE DEPLOYING STRATEGIES TO ADDRESS THESE UNMET COMMUNITY NEEDS AND IMPROVE OUR OVERALL COMMUNITY BENEFIT. SAINT MARY'S ALSO WORKS CLOSELY WITH MANY LOCAL CHARITABLE COMMUNITY SERVICE ORGANIZATIONS TO BOTH IDENTIFY AND ADDRESS COMMUNITY NEEDS. SAINT MARY'S HOSPITAL (SMH) INDIVIDUAL COMMUNITY BENEFIT PROGRAMS HAVE BEEN DESIGNED TO MEET THE LONG-STANDING NEEDS OF INDIVIDUALS LIVING IN THE SERVICE AREA. TO IDENTIFY NEED, SMH HAS RELIED ON EXISTING LOCAL AND REGIONAL NEEDS ASSESSMENTS INCLUDING: UNITED WAY OF GREATER WATERBURY'S COMMUNITY STATUS REPORT (2014); UNITED WAY'S TEN-YEAR PLAN TO END HOMELESSNESS (2014); THE CENTERS FOR DISEASE CONTROL AND PREVENTION BEHAVIORAL RISK FACTOR SURVEILLANCE SYSTEM (2014); CONNECTICUT DEPARTMENT OF PUBLIC HEALTH STATE HEALTH ASSESSMENT (2014); AND THE CONNECTICUT HEALTH CARE SURVEY (2014) BY THE CONNECTICUT HEALTH FOUNDATION.

The causes are cardiovascular diseases (including heart attack and stroke) and cancer. In order to educate about these causes of death we provide learning opportunities and patient screening for the community. Programs are offered through the year to educate the public about their risk for heart attacks and strokes. We hold community talks at local events (churches, festivals and those hosted by Ingalls). We also offer an online screening tool which provides participants an opportunity to learn more about their risk for cardiovascular disease and also provides them with information/tools to improve their health status. We specifically teach about stroke warning signs by holding education opportunities for church and women's groups. To address the high mortality rates for cancer in the area we will offer education and cancer screenings. Mammography and colorectal cancer screenings will be addressed with campaigns to educate about the importance of regularly scheduled screenings."

Individuals were invited to participate based on their ability to represent: underserved, low-income and minority population needs; needs of chronically ill patients; and awareness of healthcare needs in their respective communities. A total of 152 (31%) responded, though not all participants completed each question. Participants represented over 60 agencies from across the primary service area, including concerned citizens, faith community leaders, free clinics, physicians, elected officials and governmental servants. Participants were asked to share their viewpoints on:- Important health concerns in the community;- Significant service gaps in the community; - Ideas for addressing concerns and service gaps.To gauge the importance of various health concerns, respondents were asked to identify issues of community concern from a list modified from topics in Healthy People 2020. Respondents were able to enter additional concerns in an open-ended response item. Participants were also asked to review a list of services typically important to addressing health concerns. Respondents were then asked to indicate services that needed to be strengthened in terms of availability, access, or quality. Open-ended response items were provided for participants to indicate additional service gaps in the community and ideas for addressing concerns and service gaps. Priority Needs The Bon Secours Richmond CHNA Community Review session covered all four hospitals, and was facilitated by Becky Clay Christensen. This review included: Medical Directors and Associate Medical Directors covering Health Departments for four jurisdictions; Health Department Registered Nurses from two jurisdictions; Chief Operating Officer of a Free Clinic; Executive Director of a Federally Qualified Health Center; Executive Director for Community Health Services; Director of Richmond Promise Neighborhoods. In addition to these community health leaders, the following internal leaders also participated: Senior Vice President of Sponsorship for Bon Secours Richmond; Administrative Director for Community Health Services; Administrative Director for Advocacy; Manager for Evaluation and Sustainability; Manager for Community Nutrition; Two Healthy Community Liaisons. After hearing a presentation on initial findings, which included secondary and survey data, this group discussed and made ""dot choices"" to help prioritize issues by distributing dots on issues from the report and raised by the group."
201631949349300638,540793767,"St. Mary's Hospital of Richmond, Inc.","Part V, Section B, Line 11: The Implementation Plan focuses on three broad areas including Health Prevention and Promotion, Access to Health Care and Support Services. A focus in the area of Health Prevention and Promotion is access to and preparation of healthy food. Multiple community partnerships advance this work including provision of fresh produce in identified food deserts, creation of community gardens in underserved neighborhoods and nutrition instruction in school and community settings. Over 11,500 community members were engaged in nutrition activities.Access to Health Care addresses the needs of the uninsured in the greater metropolitan Richmond area. The mobile health program, Care-A-Van, provides culturally competent primary care services to the uninsured in collaboration with 21 church partners. Over 19,000 patient visits were rendered in FY 2015. Bon Secours also supports the free clinic safety net by providing financial support, lab services and in-kind inpatient and outpatient services.Healthy Beginnings is an example of a Support Service focused on prenatal, postpartum and newborn care. Assistance is provided to women helping them identify and access resources to support their pregnancy. Services include Medicaid enrollment, parenting classes and nutritional support (WIC) among others.Dental Care/Oral HealthDental Care was identified in the CHNA community survey as a gap. Oral health is important because it can impact general health. Multiple community organizations are engaged in providing dental care services to the uninsured. They include Virginia Commonwealth University's School of Dentistry, Daily Planet, FQHC, Vernon J. Harris FQHC Dental Clinic, CrossOver Ministry and Goochland Free Clinic and Family Services. As such Bon Secours will not be addressing dental needs at this time.Transportation Other community organizations are better positioned to provide transportation. The Greater Richmond Transit Authority (GRTC) serves the City of Richmond and Henrico County. They have 186 buses and 40 routes. Each bus is equipped with a wheel chair lift. GRTC serves the Richmond Community Hospital campus.GRTC CARE service provides curb-to-curb public transportation to disabled individuals who may not be reasonably able to use the GRTC fixed route bus. It is also available for persons aged 80 or older. Richmond Community Hospital provides limited patient transportation. Patients who reside within a 10-mile radius of the hospital may utilize the patient transport van to reach the hospital campus. This service includes behavioral health patients.Lack of adequate transportation can be a barrier to accessing health care services. The Bon Secours Care-A-Van is a mobile health outreach program providing primary care services in local neighborhoods in the Richmond Community Hospital service area. The Care-A-Van contributes to the elimination of transportation as a barrier to care for uninsured patients."
