201543169349301839,263162145,"SCHEDULE H, PART V, SECTION B, LINE 5 - INPUT FROM COMMUNITY","IU Health Arnett operates one hospital location licensed as a single hospital by the Indiana State Department of Health. IU Health Arnett is located in Lafayette, Tippecanoe County, Indiana. In conducting its most recent CHNA, IU Health Arnett took into account input from persons who represent the broad interests of the communities it serves by hosting several community conversation focus groups. These focus groups included public health officials and community leaders to discuss the healthcare needs of the service area and what role IU Health Arnett could play in addressing the identified needs. To obtain a more complete picture of the factors that play into the Tippecanoe County community's health, input from local health leaders was gathered through two separate focus group sessions. The first live group session lasted two hours and was held at IU Health Arnett Hospital and the second session was held via conference call. IU Health Arnett facilitators mailed letters and made follow-up telephone calls inviting public health officials and community leaders to attend the focus group discussion, paying special attention to including organizations that represent the interest of low-income, minority, and uninsured individuals. The goal of soliciting these leaders' feedback was to gather insights into the quantitative data that may not be easily identified from the secondary statistical data alone.

Upon arrival to the focus group, participants were asked to list their believed five prioritized health needs for the IU Health Arnett community. These responses were collected and aggregated into a comprehensive list of identified needs to be further discussed later in the session and ranked for severity of need within the community. IU Health Arnett facilitators then provided participants with a presentation featuring the mission of IU Health, current outreach priorities, and local health data, including demographics, insurance information, poverty rates, county health rankings, causes of death, physical activity, chronic conditions, preventive behaviors, and community needs index. Upon completion of the data presentation, IU Health Arnett facilitated a discussion on the comprehensive list of identified needs from earlier in the session. The objective of this method was intended to inspire candid discussions prior to a second identification of five prioritized health needs by each participant. The votes on the five prioritized health needs were tallied and final input from the group was encouraged during this process in order to validate the previously identified needs. Following additional discussion, participants were also asked to address what they thought the role of IU Health Arnett could be in meeting the local health needs. IU Health Arnett also solicited responses from the general public regarding the health of the IU Health Arnett community through an online survey. The survey consisted of approximately 15 multiple choice and open-ended questions that assessed the community members' feedback regarding healthcare issues and barriers to access. A link was made available on the hospital's Web site via an electronic survey tool from April 2012 through June 2012. A paper version was distributed to local community centers, health clinics, community health fairs and events, as well as within some hospital patient waiting areas. Additionally, an estimated 25,000 surveys were e-mailed, direct-mailed, or sent via newsletter. In addition to disseminating directly to the general public of the community, the survey was also sent via e-mail to participants in the needs assessment focus groups to provide an opportunity for these community leaders to pass on to their local community members. Respondent Demographics 9 respondents participated in the survey. All of the participants were from the PSA (Tippecanoe County). All but one participant (89%) was Caucasian (white), and the majority of respondents were 18-40 (77%) years of age, with only two respondents above the age of 60. The educational attainment of the sample was relatively high for the nine individuals who reported it, with more than 66% of respondents indicating they had completed either a college undergraduate (44%) or graduate degree (22%). One respondent indicated completing vocational or technical schooling, and another respondent reported completing some high school or a high school degree/GED only. A majority of survey participants reported a household income of over $44,701 (78%), with the majority of participants indicating an income of $44,701-$67,050 (56%). Only two respondents (22%) reported a household income lower than $44,701. Survey respondents were also asked to report their insurance status. Of the nine respondents who reported their insurance status, the majority had commercial/private insurance (67%). Two individuals also reported either being uninsured or self-pay (22%), and one respondent was covered by Medicaid."

201543169349301839,263162145,"SCHEDULE H - PART V, SECTION B, LINE 11 - ADDRESSING IDENTIFIED NEEDS","IU Health Arnett prioritized and determined which of the community health needs identified in its most recently conducted CHNA were most critical for it to address by using the Hanlon Method of prioritization. This method prioritizes identified needs based upon the prevalence and severity of the need and the effectiveness of interventions available to address the needs. Based upon the Hanlon Method of prioritization, IU Health Arnett selected the following three needs to be addressed: - Obesity Prevention - Access to Healthcare - K-12 Education Obesity Prevention To improve the lifestyle of Indiana residents, IU Health has utilized best practice methods to attack obesity in our communities. IU Health is working to improve access to nutritious foods and physical activity in low-income neighborhoods, in addition to providing traditional health education and public advocacy efforts. With these initiatives, IU Health strives to prevent chronic diseases such as obesity and diabetes and increase the awareness of the importance of making healthy choices, since Thirty-six percent of Hoosier adults are overweight and 29.5% are obese, costing the nations billions of dollars each year to treat these chronic health conditions. In order to provide educational information and promote health and safety to the local communities it serves, IU Health Arnett hosted its third annual health and safety fair on May 1, 2014. More than 800 adults and children in the community attended to learn more about healthy eating, falls prevention, car seat safety, sleep education and bike safety. In total, 42 education booths provided health and well-being education to families. In conjunction with the 2014 IU Health Day of Service, IU Health Arnett collaborated with the Lafayette Parks & Recreation Department. More than 40 IU Health Arnett team members volunteered their time to improve walking trails, landscape, place signage and conduct general cleanup at Armstrong Park in Tippecanoe County. Helping to improve local parks is a simple way for IU Health Arnett Hospital to encourage the local community to get out and be active. With support from the YMCA and Lafayette Parks & Recreation Department, a free walking program was established. Health and fitness experts collaborated to motivate the group as well as provide a fun and safe way to increase physical activity. Access to Healthcare One of the first steps to improved health outcomes is having access to healthcare resources. To show its commitment to providing affordable healthcare access, IU Health Arnett treats all patients regardless of their ability to pay. IU Health Arnett is also working to raise awareness and work to identify individuals within our communities that have barriers to care and connect these individuals with better access and consistency of healthcare resources to meet their needs. K-12 Education Education plays a crucial role in health outcomes. Level of education has an impact not only on personal health, but it has multigenerational implications as well. Children with a solid educational foundation and parents who are involved in their education are more likely to embrace healthy lifestyles and habits and succeed generally in life. Additionally, research from The National Center for Public Policy and Higher Education shows that greater educational attainment is associated with health-promoting behaviors, such as increased consumption of fruits and vegetables and other aspects of healthy eating; engaging in physical activity and refraining from smoking. Kindergarten Countdown is a free, four-week summer camp, sponsored by IU Health Arnett. The program is designed to prepare children with little to no preschool experience for their new roles as kindergarten students. The camp is taught by licensed, experienced teachers and takes place in a school setting. As part of its commitment to education and the community, IU Health Arnett continues to provide volunteers for the Read to Succeed program. This program is a partnership between three public school corporations, The Greater Lafayette Commerce and the United Way of Greater Lafayette. The program's goal is to ensure that every student leaves third grade reading at grade level or better. This age is the point where students shift from learning to read to reading to learn. The program was developed to help children in the community succeed. IU Health Arnett encourages team members to volunteer throughout the school year. Nearly 15 schools in the Lafayette area participated in 2014, and more than 4,000 local children benefited. Also, based upon the Hanlon Method of prioritization, the following identified community health needs were not amongst the needs chosen to be addressed: - Mental Health - Senior Health - Substance Abuse Prevention The identified community need of mental health was reviewed and after completing a gap analysis, it was determined that there are a number of local organizations working to address this community need such as the Lafayette Transitional Housing Corporation, Mental Health America Lafayette, Wabash Valley Alliance and Sycamore Springs. The identified community need of senior health was reviewed and after completing a gap analysis, it was determined that there are a number of local organizations working to address this community need such as the Area IV Council on Aging, Community Action Programs, and Healthy Active Tippecanoe programs. These programs include Senior Fairs and Health Fairs. Substance abuse prevention is closely linked with mental health; therefore Tippecanoe County shares the same lack of resources to treat substance abuse as they do mental health in the community. After completing a gap analysis, it was determined that there are a number of local organizations working to address this community need such as the Lafayette Transitional Housing Corporation, Mental Health America Lafayette, Wabash Valley Alliance, Sycamore Springs, and the Tobacco Free Partnership of Tippecanoe County."
201543169349301839,263162145,"SCHEDULE H, PART V, SECTION B, LINE 13B - INCOME LEVEL OTHER THAN FPG","In addition to FPG, IU Health Arnett may take into consideration a patient's income and/or ability to pay in calculation of a financial assistance award."
201543169349301839,263162145,"SCHEDULE H, PART V, SECTION B, LINE 13H - OTHER FAP FACTORS","IU Health Arnett takes into consideration several other factors in determining patient eligibility for financial assistance. These factors include the following: 1. Alternate Sources of Assistance When technically feasible, a patient will be required to exhaust all other state and federal assistance programs prior to receiving an award from IU Health Arnett's Financial Assistance Program. Patients who may be eligible for coverage under an applicable insurance policy, including, but not limited to, health, automobile, and homeowner's, must exhaust all insurance benefits prior to receiving an award from IU Health Arnett's Financial Assistance Program. This includes patients covered under their own policy and those who may be entitled to benefits from a third-party policy. Patients may be asked to show proof that such a claim was properly submitted to their insurance provider at the request of IU Health Arnett. Eligible patients who receive medical care from an IU Health Arnett facility as a result of an injury proximately caused by a third party, and later receive a monetary settlement or award from said third party, may receive Financial Assistance for any outstanding balance not covered by the settlement or award to which IU Health Arnett is entitled. Said patients may be asked to complete a financial assistance application. 2. Presumptive Financial Assistance Eligibility Patients who are deemed to be presumptively eligible for Financial Assistance will receive a Financial Adjustment to their final statement balance based on the patient's individual scoring criteria. Patients are considered to be presumptively eligible for Financial Assistance if the financial need has been determined by the following third parties: Eskenazi Health, formerly Wishard Memorial Hospital, Project Health, Indiana Children's Special Health Care Services, Medicaid, Out-of-State Medicaid, Healthy Indiana Plan, or Volunteers in Medicine. Patients are also considered to be presumptively eligible if they are pending Medicaid approval or have a hospital bill with a maximum balance to be determined by the Financial Assistance Committee and who meet certain risk segmentation scoring criteria. 3. Additional Considerations Financial Assistance may be granted to a deceased patient's account if said patient is found to have no estate. Additionally, IU Health Arnett will deny or revoke Financial Assistance for any patient or guarantor who falsifies any portion of a Financial Assistance application."

These measures include the following: 1. Signs are posted in appropriate acute care settings such as emergency departments and registration areas describing the available assistance and directing eligible patients to the Financial Assistance Application. 2. IU Health Arnett includes a plain language description of its FAP with all patient bills and statements of services. 3. IU Health Revenue Cycle Services representatives are available via telephone Monday through Friday, excluding major holidays, from 8 a.m. to 7 p.m. (Eastern Time) to address questions related to Financial Assistance. 4.

201543169349301839,263162145,"SCHEDULE H, PART V, SECTION B, LINE 22D - OTHER DETERMINATION OF CHARGES","IU Health Arnett limits the amounts charged for Emergency or other Medically Necessary Services provided to individuals eligible for assistance under its FAP to not more than amounts generally billed to individuals who have insurance coverage for such care. The basis for calculating the amount charged to all patients, including those who are eligible for Financial Assistance, is derived through the use of a chargemaster or physician fee schedule and are uniformly applied. All additional discounts required by insurance contract or IU Health Arnett's FAP are applied to the chargemaster or physician fee schedule calculated amount. IU Health Arnett does not use gross charges in the calculation of the amount to charge a Financial Assistance eligible patient."

THE ORGANIZATION IS IN THE PROCESS OF ADDRESSING THE NEEDS IDENTIFIED IN THE CHNA BUT HAS NOT FULLY ADDRESSED ALL NEEDS AT THIS TIME. FROM THE VARIOUS SETS OF DATA, FROM THE MULTIPLE COMMUNITY FORUMS, FROM THE CURRENT INITIATIVES ACTIVE AND NEW IN ROCHESTER, A LIST OF HEALTH NEEDS WAS ESTABLISHED. SOME OF THE PRIMARY NEEDS INCLUDE: - DECREASE CIGARETTE SMOKING AMONG ADULTS - DECREASE ADULT OBESITY - INCREASE HYPERTENSIVES WHO HAVE THEIR BLOOD PRESSURE IN CONTROL - DECREASE UNINTENDED PREGNANCY RATES - DECREASE STDS/STIS, ESPECIALLY CHLAMYDIA AND GONORRHEA RATES - IMPROVE MENTAL HEALTH AMONG ADULTS AND ADOLESCENTS THE COMMUNITY HEALTH IMPROVEMENT WORKGROUP CHOSE TO PRIORITIZE ""PREVENTING CHRONIC DISEASE"", WHICH CLEARLY INCLUDES THE TOP THREE BULLET POINTS. DUE TO LIMITED RESOURCES AND TO AVOID 'MISSION CREEP' THE HOSPITAL SYSTEMS CHOSE NOT TO ADDRESS RISKY SEXUAL BEHAVIORS AND MENTAL HEALTH PROMOTION IN THE IMPROVEMENT PLAN. REGARDING ISSUES OF RISKY SEXUAL BEHAVIOR: ALTHOUGH THE MEASURES OF SUCCESS INDICATE THAT MONROE COUNTY IS 'WORSE THAN' THE STATE AND HAS NOT REACHED THE GOALS SET IN THE NY STATE PREVENTION AGENDA, HOSPITAL LEADERS FELT THAT ALTHOUGH THIS ISSUE CERTAINLY AFFECTS THE MEMBERS IN THE HOSPITAL'S TARGET AREAS, THIS IS NOT A TOP PRIORITY FOR USE OF THE HOSPITALS' RESOURCES. HOSPITAL LEADERS FELT THEY WERE NOT THE BEST ENTITY TO ADDRESS THIS PROBLEM. IN ADDITION, THERE ARE COMMUNITY ORGANIZATIONS WHO HAVE THIS GOAL AS THEIR MISSION, AND SEVERAL INITIATIVES THAT HAVE JUST STARTED IN MONROE COUNTY THAT COULD BE QUITE IMPACTFUL. REGARDING ISSUES OF MENTAL HEALTH: ALTHOUGH MENTAL HEALTH IS ALWAYS A CONCERN AMONG THE COMMUNITY, THE COMMUNITY HEALTH IMPROVEMENT WORKGROUP FELT THAT THE DEGREE OF THE PROBLEM WAS NOT AS SEVERE AS SOME OTHER HEALTH ISSUES. ALTHOUGH MONROE COUNTY IS WORSE THAN THE STATE FOR PREVENTION AGENDA INDICATORS, THIS DIFFERENCE IS NOT SIGNIFICANT, SO MONROE COUNTY IS SOMEWHAT IN LINE WITH GOALS AND THE REST OF THE STATE. IN ADDITION, THE HOSPITALS FELT THAT THE LEVEL OF ACTIVITY BEING CONDUCTED BY MANY AGENCIES IN OUR COMMUNITY WAS STRONG. THE TEAM WAS ALSO NOT CONFIDENT IN THE LIKELIHOOD OF SUCCESS IF THE HOSPITALS CONCENTRATED ON ADDRESSING MENTAL HEALTH. THERE ARE OTHER ORGANIZATIONS MORE EQUIPPED, AND ALTHOUGH CERTAIN PARTS OF THE HOSPITALS ADDRESS MENTAL HEALTH TREATMENT, PREVENTING MENTAL HEALTH FROM THE HOSPITAL PERSPECTIVE WAS DIFFICULT TO ANTICIPATE. --------------------"

REGARDING ISSUES OF MENTAL HEALTH: ALTHOUGH MENTAL HEALTH IS ALWAYS A CONCERN AMONG THE COMMUNITY, THE COMMUNITY HEALTH IMPROVEMENT WORKGROUP FELT THAT THE DEGREE OF THE PROBLEM WAS NOT AS SEVERE AS SOME OTHER HEALTH ISSUES. ALTHOUGH MONROE COUNTY IS WORSE THAN THE STATE FOR PREVENTION AGENDA INDICATORS, THIS DIFFERENCE IS NOT SIGNIFICANT, SO MONROE COUNTY IS SOMEWHAT IN LINE WITH GOALS AND THE REST OF THE STATE.
