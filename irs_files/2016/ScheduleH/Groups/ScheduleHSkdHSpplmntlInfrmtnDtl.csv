201543169349301839,263162145,"Schedule H, Part II - Promotion of Health in Communities Served","IU Health Arnett participated in a variety of community-building activities that address the underlying quality of life in the communities it serves. IU Health, as a statewide healthcare system, invested in economic development efforts across the state, collaborated with like-minded organizations through coalitions that address key issues and advocated for improvements in the health status of vulnerable populations. IU Health contributed nearly $2 million to community-building activities in 2014, serving over 52,600 people statewide. Locally, IU Health Arnett invested over $238,000 in community-building activities by providing investments and resources to local community initiatives that addressed economic development, community health improvement and workforce development. Some examples of outreach activities include participating in our local United Way's Read-to-Succeed child-mentoring program and Get Strong Walking Groups. Additionally, through the IU Health team member community benefit service program, Strength That Cares, team members across the state made a difference in the lives of thousands of Hoosiers. On a local level, throughout 2014, the IU Health Arnett team members contributed as follows: "" More than 40 IU Health Arnett team members volunteered their time with the local parks department to improve walking trails and by painting, landscaping, installing playground surface material and providing general clean up at Armstrong Park in Tippecanoe County for the annual IU Health Day of Service. "" Throughout 2014, IU Health Arnett team members volunteered at local schools through United Way's Read-to-Succeed program.

201543169349301839,263162145,"Schedule H, Part III, Line 4 - Bad Debt Expense","IU Health Arnett is included in the consolidated audit report prepared for IU Health. The provision for uncollected patient accounts, for all payors, is recognized when services are provided based upon management's assessment of historical and expected net collections, taking into consideration business and economic conditions, changes and trends in health care coverage and other collection indicators. Periodically, management assesses the adequacy of the allowance for uncollectible accounts based upon accounts receivable payor composition and aging, the significance of individual payors to outstanding accounts receivable balances, and historical write-off experience by payor category, as adjusted for collection indicators. The results of this review are then used to make any modifications to the provision for uncollected accounts and the allowance for uncollectible accounts. In addition, IU Health follows established guidelines for placing certain past due patient balances with collection agencies. Patient accounts that are uncollected, including those placed with collection agencies, are initially charged against the allowance for uncollectible accounts in accordance with collection policies of IU Health and, in certain cases, are reclassified to charity care if deemed to otherwise meet financial assistance policies of IU Health."
201543169349301839,263162145,"Schedule H, Part III, Line 8 - Medicare Shortfall","The Medicare shortfall reported on Schedule H, Part III, Line 7 is calculated, in accordance with the Form 990 instructions, using ""allowable costs"" from IU Health Arnett's Medicare Cost Report. ""Allowable costs"" for Medicare Cost Report purposes are not reflective of all costs associated with IU Health Arnett's participation in Medicare programs. For example, the Medicare Cost Report excludes certain costs such as billed physician services, the costs of Medicare Parts C and D, fee schedule reimbursed services, and durable medical equipment services. Inclusion of all costs associated with IU Health Arnett's participation in Medicare programs would significantly increase the Medicare shortfall reported on Schedule H, Part III, Line 7. IU Health Arnett's Medicare shortfall is attributable to reimbursements that are less than the cost of providing patient care and services to Medicare beneficiaries and does not include any amounts that result from inefficiencies or poor management. IU Health Arnett accepts all Medicare patients knowing that there may be shortfalls; therefore it has taken the position that the shortfall should be counted as part of its community benefit. Additionally, it is implied in Internal Revenue Service Revenue Ruling 69-545 that treating Medicare patients is a community benefit. Revenue Ruling 69-545, which established the community benefit standard for nonprofit hospitals, states that if a hospital serves patients with governmental health benefits, including Medicare, then this is an indication that the hospital operates to promote the health of the community."

Financial Assistance Application Patients or their guarantors wishing to apply for Financial Assistance must submit a Financial Assistance Application within twenty-one (21) days of receiving their first billing statement from IU Health Arnett. Individuals other than the patient, such as the patient's physician, family members, community or religious groups, social services or hospital personnel may request a Financial Assistance Application to be mailed to a patient's primary mailing address free of charge. IU Health Arnett keeps all applications and supporting documentation confidential. 2. Eligibility Determination IU Health Arnett informs patients or guarantors of the results of their application by providing the patient or guarantor with a Financial Assistance Determination within ninety (90) days of receiving a completed Application and all requested documentation. If a patient or guarantor is granted less than full assistance and the patient or guarantor provides additional information for reconsideration, Revenue Cycle Services may amend a prior Financial Assistance Determination. If a patient or guarantor seeks to appeal the Financial Assistance Determination further, a written request may be submitted, along with the supporting documentation, to the Financial Assistance Committee for additional review/reconsideration. All decisions of the Financial Assistance Committee are final. A patient's Financial Assistance Application and eligibility determination will remain in effect for three-hundred-sixty-five (365) days from the date of receipt of a completed application. 3. Extraordinary Collection Actions IU Health Arnett only implements its ""Bad Debt Referral Policy"" or other Extraordinary Collection Action after it has made reasonable efforts to determine whether the patient account is eligible for assistance under its FAP. When it is necessary to engage in such action, IU Health Arnett, and its contracted third parties, will engage in fair, respectful and transparent collections activities. Patients or guarantors who have not applied for Financial Assistance and whose accounts have been engaged in Extraordinary Collection Actions may request Financial Assistance, complete an Application with requested documentation, and be considered for a reduction in their bill if it is within the two-hundred-forty (240) days of receiving their first billing statement. IU Health Arnett may also suspend collection activity on an account while an Application is being processed and considered. IU Health Arnett and its collection agencies will not provide assistance after an account has entered into legal proceedings without first obtaining written consent from its Financial Assistance Committee. The award of Financial Assistance may be subject to successful completion of a payment plan. In the event a patient or guarantor who is receiving Financial Assistance fails to complete the terms of their payment plan, IU Health Arnett reserves the right to submit the unadjusted account balance, less any amount previously paid by the patient, to an Extraordinary Collection Action."

IU Health Arnett understands that the health of individuals and communities are shaped by various social and environmental factors, along with health behaviors and additional influences. IU Health Arnett assesses the health care needs of the communities it serves by utilizing the detailed community needs assessments undertaken by organizations such as the Tippecanoe County Health Department, the Indiana State Department of Health, the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention and the United Way of Central Indiana. After completion of the CHNA, IU Health Arnett reviewed the information gathered from community leader focus groups, community input surveys and statistical data. The needs identified were analyzed and ranked using the Hanlon method of prioritization to determine the prevalence and severity of community health needs and which ones were most critical. Additionally, the effectiveness of an intervention for each need and IU Health's ability to impact positive change was evaluated."

To assist in meeting those needs, IU Health Arnett has adopted a Financial Assistance Policy that provides Financial Assistance to eligible patients receiving Emergency or Medically-Necessary Services. This policy was developed and is utilized to determine a patient's financial ability to pay for services. IU Health Arnett goes to great lengths to publicize its financial assistance policy and ensure that patients know they will be treated regardless of their ability to pay. IU Health Arnett shares financial assistance information with patients throughout their entire episode of care and beyond including the admissions process, billing process, and online. 1. Admissions Process IU Health Arnett educates all patient facing team members on its Financial Assistance Policy and the process for referring patients to the program. During the admissions process, opportunities for financial assistance are discussed with patients who are identified as self-pay (uninsured) or if they request assistance information. The patient is also provided with an Admissions Packet that outlines information regarding IU Health Arnett's financial assistance program. Financial counselors are onsite to assist with financial concerns or questions during the patient's stay. Patient Financial Services Customer Service representatives are also available after the patient's stay to help patients apply for financial assistance, understand their bills, explain what they can expect during the billing process, accept payment (if needed), update their insurance or payor information, and update their address or other demographic information. 2. Billing Process IU Health Arnett includes a plain language summary of its Financial Assistance Policy with all patient bills and statements of services. The plain language summary includes contact information allowing patients the ability to request financial assistance. Additionally, a Financial Assistance Application is mailed to all IU Health Arnett patients with a patient balance due after insurance. IU Health Revenue Cycle Services representatives are available via telephone Monday through Friday, excluding major holidays, from 8 a.m. to 7 p.m. (Eastern Time) to address questions related to Financial Assistance. Customer Service team members will also mail paper applications to a patient at their request. 3.

201543169349301839,263162145,"Schedule H, Part VI, Line 5 - Promotion of Community Health","IU Health Arnett is an affiliate of IU Health, a tax-exempt hospital, whose Board of Directors is composed of members, of which substantially all are independent community members. Additionally, IU Health Arnett invests in the community to improve the quality of the health of the community members. Several community benefit highlights are described below. In order to provide educational information and promote health and safety to the local communities it serves, IU Health Arnett hosted its third annual Health & Safety Fair on May 1, 2014. Over 800 people attended the Health & Safety Fair, which focused on providing education to children and their families about their health and well-being by learning about various topics such as healthy eating, falls prevention, car seat safety, sleep education and bike safety. Dozens of community organizations provided educational booths including the Tippecanoe County Library, which had its mobile library on site and the IU Health Arnett Foundation, which hosted bike helmet fittings and distributed 277 bike helmets to children throughout the day. Stress tests, blood pressure, cholesterol and BMI screenings were also available on site. New in 2014, was the addition of the community 5K run/walk event. Over 100 runners participated in the event, which took the participants around the hospital and the surrounding countryside. Developed in 2013, a free walking program was established to improve the health of the community. With support from the YMCA and Lafayette Parks & Recreation Department, health and fitness experts were provided to motivate the group to ""get strong"" by providing a fun and safe way to increase physical activity. The participants' goal was to dedicate 30 minutes of activity that could help achieve numerous health benefits, such as improved blood pressure and cholesterol levels. In 2014, 51 people registered for the group. Over the course of the four-month program, 77 percent of participants increased their level of activity after joining the group. Once a month, each of the supported walking sites hosted a gathering with a guest speaker who demonstrated more ways to help participants get strong. Each week, individuals had the option of having their body mass index (BMI) and blood pressure screened as a way to track how the walking was impacting their health. The hospital also donated more than $526,000 to non-profit community organizations in 2014. Some of the groups included the Riggs Community Health Center, Lafayette Medical Education Foundation, the United Way of Greater Lafayette and the American Heart Association."
201543169349301839,263162145,"Schedule H, Part VI, Line 6 - Affiliated Health Care Systems","IU Health Arnett is a part of the IU Health statewide healthcare system which continues to broaden its reach and positive impact throughout the state of Indiana. IU Health is Indiana's most comprehensive academic medical center, which encompasses IU Health Methodist Hospital, IU Health University Hospital, Riley Hospital for Children at IU Health and IU Health Saxony Hospital. Other entities within the IU Health system are IU Health West Hospital, IU Health North Hospital, IU Health White Hospital, IU Health Ball Memorial Hospital, IU Health Blackford Hospital, IU Health Bloomington Hospital, IU Health Paoli Hospital, IU Health Bedford Hospital, IU Health Tipton Hospital, IU Health La Porte Hospital, IU Health Starke Hospital, IU Health Morgan Hospital and IU Health Goshen Hospital. Although each IU Health hospital prepares and submits its own community benefits plan relative to the local community, IU Health considers its community benefit plan as part of an overall vision for strengthening Indiana's overall health. A comprehensive community outreach strategy and community benefit plan is in place that encompasses the academic medical center downtown Indianapolis, suburban Indianapolis and statewide entities around priority areas that focus on health improvement efforts statewide. IU Health is keenly aware of the positive impact it can have on the communities of need in the state of Indiana by focusing on the most pressing needs in a systematic and strategic way. After taking a careful look into IU Health's communities we serve, and by utilizing the detailed community needs assessments undertaken by public health officials and community partners, IU Health identified the following community health needs for 2014. Obesity Prevention To improve the lifestyle of Indiana residents, IU Health has utilized best practice methods to attack obesity in our communities. IU Health is working to improve access to nutritious foods and physical activity in low-income neighborhoods, in addition to providing traditional health education and public advocacy efforts. With these initiatives, IU Health strives to prevent chronic diseases such as obesity and diabetes and increase the awareness of the importance of making healthy choices, since 36% of Hoosier adults are overweight and 29.5% are obese, costing the nations billions of dollars each year to treat these chronic health conditions. Get Strong Walking Group As part of IU Health Arnett's mission to reduce area obesity rates, the free Get Walking groups were launched in 2013. IU Health Arnett hosted one walking groups every Monday from June through September. The groups met at Armstrong Park in Lafayette. The walking groups were developed to educate community members on the benefits of walking, in an encouraging atmosphere. The program was supported by the Lafayette Parks & Recreation Department as well as The Lafayette YMCA who provided certified walking instructors. IU Health Arnett physicians and Wellness Coordinators volunteered their time to provide additional resources and health screenings to participants. Fifty-one individuals participated throughout the course of the program, with nine improving their body mass index rates and three showing reduced blood pressure after completion of the program. Day of Service In conjunction with the 2014 IU Health Day of Service, IU Health Arnett collaborated locally with the Lafayette Parks & Recreation department. More than 40 IU Health Arnett employees volunteered their time to improve walking trails, landscape, place signage and general cleanup at both Armstrong and Trailhead Parks in Tippecanoe County. Helping to improve local parks is a simple way for IU Health Arnett to encourage the local community to get out and be active. Access to Affordable Healthcare One of the first steps to improved health outcomes is having access to healthcare resources. To show its commitment to providing affordable healthcare access, IU Health Arnett treats all patients regardless of their ability to pay. IU Health Arnett is also working to raise awareness and working to identify individuals within our communities that have barriers to care and connect these individuals with better access and consistency of healthcare resources to meet their needs. K-12 Education Education plays a crucial role in health outcomes. Level of education has an impact not only on personal health, but it has multigenerational implications as well. Children with a solid educational foundation and parents who are involved in their education are more likely to embrace healthy lifestyles and habits and succeed generally in life. Additionally, research from The National Center for Public Policy and Higher Education shows that greater educational attainment is associated with health-promoting behaviors, such as increased consumption of fruits and vegetables and other aspects of healthy eating; engaging in physical activity and refraining from smoking. Realizing that educational disparities appear early, IU Health is committed to enhancing childhood education to improve health and lifelong quality of life. Kindergarten Countdown Kindergarten Countdown is a free, four-week summer camp, sponsored by IU Health Arnett. The United Way of Greater Lafayette and IU Health Arnett piloted this program at Miller Elementary during the summer of 2011. Kindergarten Countdown is designed to prepare children with little to no preschool experience for their new roles as kindergarten students. The camp is taught by licensed, experienced teachers and takes place in a school setting. Students attend school for half a day to adjust to the routines and procedures of kindergarten to help them transition into school. IU Health Arnett supports Kindergarten Countdown as a community initiative to strengthen K-12 education. Since launching the program, IU Health Arnett has provided volunteers, school supplies and books to approximately 240 area children who participate in the program each year. Read to Succeed As part of its commitment to education and the community, IU Health Arnett continues to provide volunteers for the Read to Succeed program. This program is a partnership between three public school corporations, Greater Lafayette Commerce and the United Way of Greater Lafayette. The program's goal is to ensure that every third-grader leaves third grade reading at grade level or better. This age is the point when students shift from learning to read toward reading to learn. Without these skills, students get further behind each year, and they are dramatically more likely to drop out of school. This program was developed to help children in the community succeed. IU Health Arnett encourages employees to volunteer for this program weekly throughout the school year. Nearly 15 schools in the Lafayette area participated in 2014, and more than 4,000 local children benefited from the program."

PRINCIPLES: STRONG MEMORIAL HOSPITAL PROACTIVELY CONVEYS INFORMATION ABOUT THIS CHARITY CARE POLICY TO PATIENTS AND THEIR FAMILIES. - WE BELIEVE THAT FEAR OF A HOSPITAL BILL SHOULD NEVER GET IN THE WAY OF ESSENTIAL HEALTH SERVICES. THE PROVISION OF URGENT OR EMERGENT HEALTHCARE IS NEVER DELAYED PENDING A FINANCIAL ASSISTANCE DETERMINATION. SIGNS ANNOUNCING THE CHARITY CARE PROGRAM ARE POSTED IN THE HOSPITAL (E.G. EMERGENCY DEPARTMENT, ADMITTING OFFICE) TO PROACTIVELY CONVEY THIS MESSAGE TO PROSPECTIVE PATIENTS AND THE PUBLIC IN GENERAL. - WE MAINTAIN FINANCIAL AID POLICIES THAT ARE CONSISTENT WITH THE MISSION, VALUES AND CAPACITY OF THE HOSPITAL AND THAT TAKE INTO ACCOUNT EACH INDIVIDUAL'S ABILITY TO CONTRIBUTE TO THE COST OF HIS OR HER CARE. - WE COMMUNICATE THE AVAILABILITY OF FINANCIAL AID IN A MANNER THAT IS CLEAR, UNDERSTANDABLE, SENSITIVE TO THE PATIENT'S DIGNITY, AND IN MULTIPLE LANGUAGES. A NOTICE IS AVAILABLE AT REGISTRATION SITES THAT INFORMS PATIENTS OF THIS PROGRAM AND PROVIDES THE PHONE NUMBER TO CALL TO OBTAIN MORE INFORMATION AND TO APPLY FOR THIS PROGRAM. DESIGNATED STAFF ARE PROVIDED DETAILED TRAINING SO THAT THEY CAN PROVIDE INFORMATION AND ANSWER QUESTIONS ABOUT THE CHARITY CARE PROGRAM. INFORMATION IS GENERALLY AVAILABLE IN BOTH ENGLISH AND SPANISH. WHEN REQUESTED, IT WILL ALSO BE MADE AVAILABLE IN OTHER LANGUAGES. - INFORMATION REGARDING OUR CHARITY CARE PROGRAM IS ALSO AVAILABLE ON THE URMC WEBSITE. - WE IMPLEMENT FINANCIAL AID PROCEDURES THAT ARE CONSUMER-FRIENDLY, RESPECTFUL, AND CONFIDENTIAL, AS WELL AS DEBT COLLECTION POLICIES THAT REFLECT THE MISSION AND VALUES OF THIS HOSPITAL. - WE WORK WITH GOVERNMENT, PAYERS, BUSINESS, CONSUMER GROUPS AND OTHERS TO ADDRESS THE UNDERLYING PROBLEM THAT TOO MANY NEW YORKERS LACK HEALTH INSURANCE. GENERAL GUIDELINES: AS PART OF FINANCIAL PLANNING ASSISTANCE, WE PROVIDE PATIENTS, AND/OR THEIR LEGAL REPRESENTATIVE, WITH INFORMATION ABOUT THE CRITERIA THAT MUST BE MET IN ORDER TO OBTAIN MEDICAID, MEDICARE, OR OTHER HEALTH INSURANCES. PATIENTS ARE ASSISTED IN MAKING APPLICATIONS FOR ANY OF THESE INSURANCES OR DISCOUNTED FEE PLANS. PATIENTS ARE EXPECTED TO PARTICIPATE FULLY IN ALL EFFORTS TO OBTAIN ANY INSURANCE FOR WHICH THEY MAY QUALIFY. UNDER CERTAIN CIRCUMSTANCES, AS DETERMINED BY THE FINANCIAL CASE MANAGERS OR OTHER HOSPITAL SENIOR ADMINISTRATORS. APPLICATIONS FOR MEDICAID, MEDICARE OR OTHER INSURANCE PROGRAMS MAY BE WAIVED WHEN DEEMED UNNECESSARY. IF AVAILABLE INSURANCE BENEFITS ARE NOT SUFFICIENT TO COVER THE COST OF THEIR CARE, PATIENTS MAY THEN APPLY FOR ASSISTANCE FROM THE CHARITY CARE PROGRAM. CHARITY CARE APPLICATIONS MUST BE COMPLETED AND RETURNED TO THE HOSPITAL WITH THE REQUESTED INCOME DOCUMENTATION. PATIENTS WILL NOT RECEIVE CHARITY CARE ASSISTANCE IF THEY (A) DO NOT COMPLETE THE APPLICATION PROCESS FOR MEDICAID OR OTHER INSURANCE FOR WHICH THEY MAY QUALIFY, (B) ELECT NOT TO MAKE APPLICATION FOR CHARITY CARE, OR (C) HAVE ADEQUATE RESOURCES OR INCOME TO PAY PRIVATELY FOR THEIR CARE. IN THESE SITUATIONS, THEY WILL REMAIN FINANCIALLY RESPONSIBLE FOR FULL PAYMENT OF THEIR HOSPITAL BILLS. CHARITY CARE ASSISTANCE IS AVAILABLE FOR PATIENTS WHO RESIDE IN NEW YORK STATE AND RECEIVE EMERGENCY HOSPITAL SERVICES, INCLUDING EMERGENCY TRANSFERS, AND TO PATIENTS WHO RESIDE IN STRONG MEMORIAL HOSPITAL'S PRIMARY SERVICE AREA IN NEW YORK STATE WHO RECEIVE SERVICES IN DESIGNATED STRONG MEMORIAL HOSPITAL PROGRAMS, INCLUDING MOST INPATIENT AND OUTPATIENT SERVICES. IN ADDITION, THE HOSPITAL MAY, IN ITS DISCRETION, GRANT CHARITY CARE TO INDIVIDUALS WHO RESIDE OUTSIDE OF NEW YORK STATE. CHARITY CARE ASSISTANCE DOES NOT COVER MEDICALLY UNNECESSARY CARE, COSMETIC ALTERATION, TELEPHONE, TELEVISION AND PRIVATE ROOM CHARGES. IT DOES NOT COVER SERVICES GENERATED BY AN INSURED PATIENT WHO CHOOSES TO RECEIVE CARE AT AN OUT-OF-NETWORK HOSPITAL, OR WHO FAILS TO COMPLY WITH INSURANCE POLICY REQUIREMENTS (E.G. UNAUTHORIZED SERVICES) NOR DOES IT APPLY TO NON-RESIDENT ALIENS (UNLESS APPROVED IN ADVANCE OF CARE BEING PROVIDED), TO DRUGS NOT ADMINISTERED IN THE HOSPITAL, TO TRANSPORTATION FURNISHED BY THIRD PARTY VENDORS, OR TO CARE, SERVICES, DRUGS OR SUPPLIES FOR THE PURPOSE OF GENDER CHANGE PROCEDURE. SPECIFIC QUESTIONS ABOUT SERVICES THAT ARE NOT COVERED SHOULD BE DIRECTED TO THE PATIENT ACCOUNTS MANAGER OR THEIR DELEGATE. FINANCIAL GUIDELINES: FINANCIAL AID IS INTENDED TO ASSIST THOSE INDIVIDUALS WHO CANNOT AFFORD TO PAY IN PART OR IN FULL FOR THEIR CARE. IT SHOULD TAKE INTO ACCOUNT EACH INDIVIDUAL'S ABILITY TO CONTRIBUTE TO THE COST OF HIS OR HER CARE. HOSPITAL FINANCIAL AID SHOULD NOT BE VIEWED AS A SUBSTITUTE FOR EMPLOYER-SPONSORED OR INDIVIDUALLY PURCHASED INSURANCE. PATIENTS WITHOUT INSURANCE AND WITH INCOME THAT WOULD QUALIFY THEM FOR THE CHARITY CARE PROGRAM BUT ALSO HAVE SUBSTANTIAL RESOURCES (OTHER THAN TAX-DEFERRED OR COMPARABLE RETIREMENT SAVINGS OR COLLEGE SAVINGS ACCOUNTS) MAY BE EXPECTED TO PAY PART OF THEIR BILLS(S). CHARITY CARE ASSISTANCE IS GENERALLY AVAILABLE TO INDIVIDUALS WHOSE INCOME IS LESS THAN OR EQUAL TO 400% OF THE FEDERAL POVERTY LEVEL. HOWEVER, PATIENTS WHO HAVE EXHAUSTED THEIR INSURANCE BENEFITS, EXCEEDED FINANCIAL ELIGIBILITY CRITERIA, FACE EXTRAORDINARY MEDICAL COSTS, OR WHO HAVE OTHER UNIQUE CIRCUMSTANCES MAY BE CONSIDERED FOR CHARITY CARE APPROVAL IN THE HOSPITAL'S SOLE DISCRETION. WHILE APPLICATION FOR MEDICAID OR OTHER INSURANCE IS USUALLY REQUIRED, THE HOSPITAL MAY, AT ITS SOLE DISCRETION, IN APPROPRIATE CASES, ALSO CONSIDER PATIENTS FOR CHARITY CARE WHEN THEY MEET THE FINANCIAL CRITERIA OF THIS PROGRAM, BUT HAVE NOT SATISFACTORILY COMPLETED ALL THE REQUIREMENTS OF THE CHARITY CARE APPLICATION PROCESS. THIS MAY INCLUDE PATIENTS WHO HAVE BEEN SANCTIONED BY MEDICAID, HAVE FILED BANKRUPTCY OR APPEAR TO BE ELIGIBLE FOR CHARITY CARE ASSISTANCE BASED ON AVAILABLE INFORMATION. ELIGIBILITY DETERMINATIONS IN COMPLEX CASE CIRCUMSTANCES WILL BE MADE AFTER CONSIDERATION BY THE CHARITY CARE REVIEW TEAM THAT INCLUDES THE CHARITY CARE OFFICER, FINANCIAL CASE MANAGER AND/OR THEIR MANAGERS, OR MAY BE MADE BY SENIOR HOSPITAL ADMINISTRATORS. THE AMOUNT OF THE DISCOUNT AFFORDED TO QUALIFIED CHARITY CARE PATIENTS WILL BE DETERMINED THROUGH ASSESSMENT OF THE RESPONSIBLE PARTY'S ANNUAL HOUSEHOLD INCOME AND THE NUMBER OF PEOPLE IN THE HOME, AS A PERCENTAGE OF THE FEDERAL POVERTY GUIDELINE AMOUNTS FOR SAME SIZE HOUSEHOLDS. THE FINANCIAL GUIDELINES WILL BE UPDATED ANNUALLY IN CONJUNCTION WITH THE FEDERAL POVERTY UPDATES PUBLISHED BY CMS. PATIENTS MAY RECEIVE FULL OR PARTIAL DISCOUNT FROM THE COST OF CARE, DEPENDING ON THE PERCENTAGE OF THE GUIDELINES MATCHED BY THE PATIENT'S HOUSEHOLD INCOME. ANY BILL AMOUNT REMAINING AFTER APPLICATION OF A PARTIAL CHARITY CARE DISCOUNT IS THE RESPONSIBILITY OF THE PATIENT. THE AMOUNT AN APPROVED CHARITY CARE PATIENT WILL GENERALLY BE EXPECTED TO PAY FOR SERVICES COVERED BY THE POLICY WILL BE LIMITED TO THE LOWER OF THE AMOUNT THAT THE HOSPITAL WOULD HAVE RECEIVED FOR THE SAME SERVICE UNDER MEDICARE PARTS A AND B, (INCLUDING COINSURANCE, CO-PAYMENTS AND DEDUCTIBLES) OR THE USUAL AND CUSTOMARY CHARGES. THE PATIENT WILL BE ASSISTED BY THE HOSPITAL IN MAKING ARRANGEMENTS TO SATISFY ANY BALANCE REMAINING ON THE ACCOUNT(S) AFTER THE APPLICATION OF THE APPROPRIATE CHARITY CARE DISCOUNT BY USE OF A PAYMENT PLAN. THE MONTHLY PAYMENTS UNDER SUCH PLANS SHALL NOT EXCEED TEN PERCENT (10%) OF THE ELIGIBLE PATIENT'S GROSS MONTHLY INCOME. THE RATE OF INTEREST ON UNPAID BALANCES SHALL NOT EXCEED THE US TREASURY RATE FOR 90 DAY SECURITIES PLUS 0.5%. HOSPITAL PATIENT FINANCIAL AID STATUTE DISCOUNTING REQUIREMENTS DISCOUNT / GROSS INCOME AS % OF FEDERAL POVERTY LEVEL 100% / UP TO 200% 80% / BETWEEN 201-250% 60% / BETWEEN 251-300% 40% / BETWEEN 301-350% 20% / BETWEEN 351-400% 0% / OVER 401% PROCESS: APPLICATIONS WILL BE ACCEPTED IMMEDIATELY BEFORE, DURING OR AFTER CARE IS PROVIDED. THE HOSPITAL WILL STRIVE TO ASSIST PATIENTS RECEIVING HIGH-COST SERVICES AS THEY OCCUR. PATIENTS MAY BE APPROVED FOR CHARITY CARE ON AN ACCOUNT-BY-ACCOUNT BASIS OR FOR A PERIOD OF TIME (FOR A COURSE OF TREATMENT). FULLY COMP"

THE GROUP IS INVOLVED IN DEFINING UNMET COMMUNITY NEEDS, INCREASING COMMUNITY KNOWLEDGE, DEVELOPING DATA COLLECTION STANDARDS, AND IMPROVING THE COLLECTION OF DATA ON PATIENTS' RACE, ETHNICITY, AND PREFERRED LANGUAGE. THE COALITION FOCUSES ON NON-MEDICAL INTERVENTIONS AND ON MOBILIZING THE COMMUNITY IN HEALTH PROMOTION, HEALTH EDUCATION, AND THE PRACTICE OF POSITIVE HEALTH BEHAVIORS, AS WELL AS ON IMPROVING COMMUNITY HEALTH STATUS THROUGH PUBLIC POLICY AND HEALTH SYSTEMS ADVOCACY. COMMUNITY HEALTH IMPROVEMENT ADVOCACY THE UNIVERSITY OF ROCHESTER (UR) WELL STREET MEDICINE PROGRAM WAS LAUNCHED IN 2011 IN RESPONSE TO A MEDICAL STUDENT'S PROPOSAL, WHICH DREW ON HER EXPERIENCE WORKING IN STREET MEDICINE IN ANOTHER COMMUNITY. THE MISSION OF UR WELL STREET MEDICINE IS TO ENSURE ACCESS TO QUALITY MEDICAL CARE FOR ROCHESTER'S UNSHELTERED HOMELESS POPULATION, OPERATING UNDER THE PRINCIPLE THAT HEALTH CARE IS A BASIC HUMAN RIGHT. IT SEEKS TO BRIDGE GAPS BETWEEN THE HOMELESS AND MEDICAL COMMUNITIES THROUGH DIRECT STREET OUTREACH AND ENGAGEMENT WITH HOMELESS PEOPLE WHERE THEY LIVE, WHILE BUILDING RELATIONSHIPS OF TRUST AND RESPECT. OUTREACH TEAMS (EACH COMPOSED OF AN OUTREACH GUIDE, A PHYSICIAN, MEDICAL STUDENTS FROM THE SCHOOL OF MEDICINE AND DENTISTRY, AND SOCIAL WORKERS) MAKE WEEKLY VISITS TO HOMELESS SHELTERS, CAMPSITES, CITY PARKS, AND OTHER PLACES WHERE HOMELESS PEOPLE RESIDE. THESE TEAMS PROVIDE MEDICAL CARE THAT IS PATIENT-CENTERED AND HOLISTIC, INCLUDING HEALTH EDUCATION, HOUSING ASSISTANCE, SUBSTANCE ABUSE REHABILITATION, MENTAL HEALTH SERVICES, AND CASE MANAGEMENT TO MEET SPECIFIC NEEDS. EACH MEDICAL STUDENT AT THE UNIVERSITY OF ROCHESTER MEDICAL CENTER IS REQUIRED TO COMPLETE A COURSE CALLED ""COMMUNITY HEALTH IMPROVEMENT COURSE"" (CHIC) DURING THEIR FOURTH YEAR OF MEDICAL SCHOOL . DURING CHIC STUDENTS LEARN ABOUT THE COMMUNITY AND EFFECTIVE WAYS OF COMMUNITY ENGAGEMENT.

THE BOARD INCLUDES NON-UR MEDICAL CENTER-EMPLOYED PRIVATE COMMUNITY PHYSICIANS, MEMBERS OF THE BUSINESS COMMUNITY, LOCAL PHILANTHROPISTS WITH AN INTEREST IN ADVOCATING FOR HEALTH CARE, AND OTHER LOCAL REPRESENTATIVES. AS A DEDICATED BOARD, EACH MEMBER UPHOLDS WELL-ESTABLISHED PRINCIPLES OF NONPROFIT CORPORATION LAW CONCERNING THE STANDARDS OF CONDUCT AND ATTENTION A BOARD MEMBER MUST MEET: FIDUCIARY RESPONSIBILITY, OBEDIENCE TO THE CHARITABLE PURPOSE OF THE ORGANIZATION, LOYALTY, A COMMITMENT TO ACT BASED ON BEST INTERESTS OF THE ORGANIZATION AND THE WIDER COMMUNITY IT SERVES, AND DILIGENCE IN CARRYING OUT THE WORK OF THE BOARD. ADMINISTRATIVELY, UR MEDICAL CENTER LEADERSHIP HAS INITIATED A COMPREHENSIVE AND AMBITIOUS STRATEGIC PLANNING PROCESS ACROSS THE INSTITUTION. THE GOALS OF THE PLAN INCLUDE EXPANDING COMMUNITY HEALTH PROGRAMS AND RESEARCH THAT IMPROVE THE OVERALL HEALTH OF THE GREATER ROCHESTER COMMUNITY. THE BOARD OF DIRECTORS ENDORSE AND CHAMPION THE VISION OF THE PLAN. THE COMMUNITY ADVISORY COUNCIL (CAC) WAS CREATED IN 2006 TO REPRESENT THE VOICE OF THE COMMUNITY AND TO GUIDE AND SUPPORT THE FOUR MISSIONS OF THE URMC. THE THIRTY-SEVEN MEMBER CAC REPRESENTS EIGHTEEN COMMUNITY-BASED ORGANIZATIONS, INCLUDING HEALTH AND SOCIAL SERVICE AGENCIES, THE FAITH COMMUNITY, LOCAL GOVERNMENT, THE CITY SCHOOL DISTRICT AND MEDIA. A PRIMARY FUNCTION OF THE CAC IS TO STRENGTHEN URMC-COMMUNITY PARTNERSHIPS WITH A MUTUAL GOAL TO REDUCE INEQUALITIES AND IMPROVE ACCESS TO HEALTH CARE AND SERVICES. TO HIGHLIGHT THE IMPORTANCE OF THE COMMUNITY HEALTH MISSION, THE ANNUAL ""DR. DAVID SATCHER COMMUNITY HEALTH IMPROVEMENT AWARDS"" PROGRAM WAS ESTABLISHED IN 2010 TO RECOGNIZE URMC FACULTY/STAFF AND THEIR COMMUNITY PARTNERS FOR EXEMPLARY COMMUNITY-ENGAGED WORK WHICH CONTRIBUTES TO REDUCING HEALTH INEQUALITIES AND IMPROVES THE COMMUNITY'S HEALTH THROUGH RESEARCH, EDUCATION, AND SERVICE.

THE ADULT TREATMENT AREA WAS CONSTRUCTED WITH 25 SEMI-PRIVATE PATIENT CUBICLES, AND UNLIKE OTHER EMERGENCY FACILITIES IN THE REGION, IT ALSO INCLUDES A DEDICATED CHILDREN'S EMERGENCY DEPARTMENT WITH A PRIVATE WAITING ROOM. SURPLUS FUNDS ARE ALSO DEDICATED TO SUPPORT RESEARCH. FINAL RENOVATIONS WERE MADE TO OUR CLINICAL AND TRANSLATIONAL RESEARCH INSTITUTE (CTSI) THAT SERVES AS THE HUB OF RESOURCES, EXPERTISE AND NETWORKS NECESSARY TO ACCELERATE THE CLINICAL APPLICATION OF BIOMEDICAL AND BEHAVIORAL RESEARCH SO THAT INTERVENTIONS CAN REACH INDIVIDUALS IN THE COMMUNITY MORE QUICKLY. THE CTSI'S COMMUNITY ENGAGEMENT FUNCTION, WHICH IS ADMINISTERED BY THE UR MEDICAL CENTER'S CENTER FOR COMMUNITY HEALTH, SUPPORTS THE CTSI COMMUNITY ENGAGEMENT MISSION BY FACILITATING COMMUNICATION AND PARTNERSHIPS AMONG RESEARCHERS, HEALTH CARE PROVIDERS, AND COMMUNITY MEMBERS AND ORGANIZATIONS.

The Rockefeller University Hospital is a unique institution. As an institution solely committed to conducting clinical research our community/service area is defined as the New York Metropolitan Area. The Rockefeller University Hospital has provided an array of clinical research and patient care services since its founding in 1910. The Rockefeller University Hospital community served/service area is determined based on research being conducted. Principal Investigators identify an area of interest and submit a protocol for review and approval by our institutional review board. If and when the protocol is approved, our recruitment office works with the investigator to develop and submit advertisements in local newspapers, magazines and online. Identification of lucrative places to advertise is determined by current trends in readership among local newspapers, magazines and visits to particular websites such as Craigslist and Facebook. Research participants are culled from all over New York City as well as through collaborations with neighboring hospitals, Universities, and clinics. As a result, our enrolled research participant demographics follow those of New York City overall. In calendar year 2014 22% of research participants identified as Hispanic, 30% identified as Black or African-American and 44% identified as white (RUH subject race and ethnicity report 2014), which mirrors the geographic makeup of New York City (44% white, 25% Black or African-American, and 28% Hispanic) (www.census.gov 2010)."

The hospital accepts all Medicare patients with the knowledge that there may be shortfalls and operates to promote the health of the community.

This percentage does not include the impact associated with the services provided by USC to Los Angeles County and USC Medical Center. PART II, LINE 8: WORKFORCE DEVELOPMENT: Keck Medicine of USC continued its efforts to engage students from local Los Angeles schools that typically enroll underserved students. Students from the Bravo Medical Magnet High School participated in a job shadowing and mentoring program. Each semester, three classes of students spend 7.5 hours a week working with staff in a variety of roles and departments. Established in 1970, USCs Med-COR Program, which stands for Medical Counseling Organizing and Recruiting, works with high school students of color to help prepare them for careers in the health professions. Students are provided structured academic enrichment in the areas of mathematics, science, and English as well as academic counseling, SAT assistance, and summer internships at local hospitals. The program serves students from four local schools: Francisco Bravo Medical Magnet High School, King-Drew Medical Magnet High School, Orthopaedic Hospital Medical Magnet High School and Van Nuys High School. Each year, the hospitals also host a Minority Outreach Enrichment day, whereby approximately a dozen directors of non-clinical fields at the hospitals shared their career paths and daily job duties with 35 students, offering mentorship and internships. Additionally, hospital leaders participated in a number of health care career awareness events to increase interest among minority and low-income youth."

However, events after discharge may change the ability of the patient to pay. Designation as Charity Care will only be considered after all payment sources have been exhausted. Hospital charges for patient accounts identified as Charity Care at the time of admission or service are not recognized by the facility as net revenues or net receivables. If patient accounts are identified as Charity Care subsequent to the facility recognizing the charges as revenue, an adjustment is required to classify appropriately the revenue and any bad debt expense previously recorded. PART III, LINE 4: NET PATIENT SERVICE REVENUE IS REPORTED AT ESTIMATED NET REALIZABLE AMOUNTS FROM PATIENTS, THIRD PARTY PAYORS, GOVERNMENT PROGRAMS AND OTHERS IN THE PERIOD IN WHICH SERVICES ARE PROVIDED. THE MAJORITY OF THE HOSPITALS' SERVICES ARE RENDERED TO PATIENTS WITH COMMERCIAL OR MANAGED CARE INSURANCE, OR UNDER THE FEDERAL MEDICARE AND CALIFORNIA STATE MEDICAL PROGRAMS. REIMBURSEMENT FROM THESE VARIOUS PAYORS IS BASED ON A COMBINATION OF PROSPECTIVELY DETERMINED RATES, DISCOUNTS FROM CHARGES AND HISTORICAL COSTS. Amounts received under the Medicare program are subject to retroactive settlements based on review and final determination by program intermediaries or their agents. Provisions for contractual adjustments and retroactive settlements related to thOse payOrs are accrued on an estimated basis in the period the related services are rendered and adjusted in future periods as additional information becomes known or as final settlements are determined. The allowanceS for doubtful accounts ARE based upon management's assessment of historical and expected net collections considering historical business and economic conditions. Periodically throughout the year management assesses the adequacy of the allowance for doubtful accounts based upon historical write-off experience. The results of this review are then used to make any modifications to the allowance for doubtful accounts."

LAWS, REGULATIONS, CATASTROPHIC ILLNESSES AND THE RISING COSTS OF NEW TECHNOLOGY HAVE CREATED A CATEGORY OF PATIENTS WHO ARE EITHER UNINSURED OR UNDERINSURED. THIS CHARITY CARE PROGRAM HAS BEEN DEVELOPED TO HELP THE HOSPITAL MEET THE NEEDS OF THESE PATIENTS AND, CONCURRENTLY, MAINTAIN THE FINANCIAL VIABILITY OF THE HOSPITAL FOR FUTURE GENERATIONS. THIS CHARITY CARE POLICY EXPLAINS HOW THE HOSPITAL ASSISTS PATIENTS WHO CANNOT PAY FOR PART OR ALL OF THE ESSENTIAL MEDICAL CARE THEY RECEIVE. PRINCIPLES: STRONG MEMORIAL HOSPITAL PROACTIVELY CONVEYS INFORMATION ABOUT THIS CHARITY CARE POLICY TO PATIENTS AND THEIR FAMILIES. - WE BELIEVE THAT FEAR OF A HOSPITAL BILL SHOULD NEVER GET IN THE WAY OF ESSENTIAL HEALTH SERVICES. THE PROVISION OF URGENT OR EMERGENT HEALTHCARE IS NEVER DELAYED PENDING A FINANCIAL ASSISTANCE DETERMINATION. SIGNS ANNOUNCING THE CHARITY CARE PROGRAM ARE POSTED IN THE HOSPITAL (E.G. EMERGENCY DEPARTMENT, ADMITTING OFFICE) TO PROACTIVELY CONVEY THIS MESSAGE TO PROSPECTIVE PATIENTS AND THE PUBLIC IN GENERAL. - WE MAINTAIN FINANCIAL AID POLICIES THAT ARE CONSISTENT WITH THE MISSION, VALUES AND CAPACITY OF THE HOSPITAL AND THAT TAKE INTO ACCOUNT EACH INDIVIDUAL'S ABILITY TO CONTRIBUTE TO THE COST OF HIS OR HER CARE. - WE COMMUNICATE THE AVAILABILITY OF FINANCIAL AID IN A MANNER THAT IS CLEAR, UNDERSTANDABLE, SENSITIVE TO THE PATIENT'S DIGNITY, AND IN MULTIPLE LANGUAGES.

PATIENTS WILL NOT RECEIVE CHARITY CARE ASSISTANCE IF THEY (A) DO NOT COMPLETE THE APPLICATION PROCESS FOR MEDICAID OR OTHER INSURANCE FOR WHICH THEY MAY QUALIFY, (B) ELECT NOT TO MAKE APPLICATION FOR CHARITY CARE, OR (C) HAVE ADEQUATE RESOURCES OR INCOME TO PAY PRIVATELY FOR THEIR CARE.

ANY BILL AMOUNT REMAINING AFTER APPLICATION OF A PARTIAL CHARITY CARE DISCOUNT IS THE RESPONSIBILITY OF THE PATIENT. THE AMOUNT AN APPROVED CHARITY CARE PATIENT WILL GENERALLY BE EXPECTED TO PAY FOR SERVICES COVERED BY THE POLICY WILL BE LIMITED TO THE LOWER OF THE AMOUNT THAT THE HOSPITAL WOULD HAVE RECEIVED FOR THE SAME SERVICE UNDER MEDICARE PARTS A AND B, (INCLUDING COINSURANCE, CO-PAYMENTS AND DEDUCTIBLES) OR THE USUAL AND CUSTOMARY CHARGES.

Management relies on the results of detailed reviews of historical write-offs and recoveries as a primary source of information to utilize in estimating the collectability of the Company's accounts receivable. The results of the detailed reviews of historical write-offs and recoveries, adjusted for changes in trends and conditions, are used to estimate the allowance for doubtful accounts for the current period.

The primary collection risks relate to uninsured patient accounts, including patient accounts for which the primary insurance carrier has paid the amounts covered by the applicable agreement, but patient responsibility amounts (deductibles and copayments) remain outstanding. The provision for doubtful accounts and the allowance for doubtful accounts relate primarily to amounts due directly from patients. An estimated allowance for doubtful accounts is recorded for all uninsured accounts, regardless of the aging of those accounts. Accounts are written off when all reasonable internal and external collections efforts have been performed. Our collection policies include a review of all accounts against certain standard collection criteria, upon completion of our internal collection efforts. Accounts determined to possess positive collectability attributes are forwarded to a secondary external collections agency and the other accounts are written off. The accounts that are not collected by the secondary external collection agency are written off when they are returned to us by the collection agency (usually within 12 months). Write-offs are based upon specific identification and the write-off process requires a write-off adjustment entry to the patient accounting system. We do not pursue collection of amounts related to patients that meet our guidelines to qualify as charity care. The methodology to determine the bad debt expense reported at cost on Part III, Line 2 is to take the ratio of patient care costs to gross patient charges and multiply this resulting ratio by the gross charges for bad debt accounts."

The University of Miami Hospital and Anne Bates Leach Eye Hospital are reimbursed under the Medicare Prospective Payment System (PPS). For inpatient services, the reimbursement methodology is the Inpatient Prospective Payment System (IPPS), which uses the Diagnostic Related Groups (DRGS) methodology to reimburse the hospital. The DRG amounts are updated by the Medicare program annually by an updating factor. However, the amount of the updating factor is always significantly less than the actual healthcare inflation factor because the Medicare program includes a ""budget neutrality"" factor for the overall Medicare program. Thus, the hospital does not receive full reimbursement of its cost for inpatient services. For outpatient services, the reimbursement methodology is the Outpatient Prospective Payment System (OPPS), which uses ambulatory payment classifications (APCS) to reimburse the hospital. The APC amounts are updated by the Medicare program annually by an updating factor. However, the amount of the updating factor is always significantly less than the actual healthcare inflation factor because the Medicare program includes a ""budget neutrality"" factor for the overall Medicare program. Thus, the hospital does not receive full reimbursement for its cost for outpatient services. The University of Miami Hospital and Clinics is a cancer specialty hospital and, as such, is cost based reimbursed for both inpatient and outpatient services. For inpatient services, the limit is the TEFRA target limit. The hospital, on occasion, exceeds the target rate and does not receive full cost reimbursement. The TEFRA target amount is updated by the Medicare program annually by the TEFRA updating factor. However, the amount of the TEFRA updating factor is always significantly less than the actual healthcare inflation factor because the Medicare program includes a ""budget neutrality"" factor for the overall Medicare program. For outpatient services, the limit is the payment to cost ratio (PCR). The PCR was established using a base year, which was 1996, at a rate of 85.5% of cost. The PCR for all exempt cancer centers was 89% through 12/31/14, and then 90% from 1/1/15 to 5/31/15; therefore, the hospital currently does not receive payment for a range of 9% to 10% of its outpatient cost."
