Growing evidence indicates that a comprehensive approach to prevention can save tremendous costs and enhance the quality of life. There are four common modifiable behaviors that contribute to chronic illness, disability, and premature death related to chronic disease. These include tobacco use, insufficient physical activity, poor eating habits, and excessive alcohol use (http://www.cdc.gov/chronicdisease/resources/publications/aag/chronic.htm). According to the 2013 University of Wisconsin Population Health Institute's County Health Rankings, Chemung and Steuben County residents are among the unhealthiest in NYS, ranking 60th and 44th respectively, out of 62 counties for poor health outcomes. Two major contributors to the poor health outcomes in Chemung and Steuben Counties are the high percentage of residents using tobacco and who are overweight or obese. Obesity is a significant risk factor for many chronic diseases and conditions which reduce the quality of life, including type-2 diabetes, asthma, high blood pressure, and high cholesterol. Increasingly, these conditions are being seen in children and adolescents (http://www.health.ny.gov/prevention/prevention_agenda/2013-2017/docs/prevent_chronic_diseases.pdf). Tobacco use is the leading preventable cause of morbidity and mortality in NYS and is associated with illnesses such as lung and oral cancers, heart disease, stroke, chronic obstructive pulmonary disease, and other lung diseases (http://www.health.ny.gov/prevention/prevention_agenda/2013-2017/indicators/2013/chemung.htm). The incidence of obesity in children and adolescents in Chemung and Steuben Counties exceeds the NYS average of 16.7%. The percentage of adults who are obese with a BMI of 30 or higher in Chemung (30.1%) and Steuben (27.6%) Counties also exceed the NYS average (23.1%). Additionally, more Chemung and Steuben County residents use tobacco than the NYS average (16.8%). Although there have been substantial reductions in the percentage of adults who smoke in NYS, tobacco use disparities have become more pronounced over the past decade. Smoking rates have not declined among adults of low-socioeconomic status and adults with poor mental health. Lower socioeconomic status is associated with an increased risk of smoking initiation and progression to regular smoking, and a decreased likelihood of successful smoking cessation (""Who's Quitting in New York: A Decade of Progress Reducing Smoking and Promoting Cessation"", February 2011, Final Report""). According to NYS Tobacco Control Program in 2008-2009, the incidence of smoking among adults who reported poor mental health (32.5%), was twice the incidence of smoking among adults who reported good mental health (15.7%) (http://www.health.ny.gov/prevention/tobacco_control/reports/statshots/volume5/n2_mental_health_and_s moking_prevalence.pdf). Chemung and Steuben Counties have a high incidence of residents with low-socioeconomic status and poor mental health. Chemung County residents reporting poor mental health for 14 days or more is 12.8%, which exceeds the NYS average of 10.2%. Recent Census Data indicates the percentage of Chemung (16.5%) and Steuben County (15%) residents living below poverty level exceeds the NYS average of 14.5%.

Hnmc also assists other non-profits and provides various forms of non-monetary aid. In addition, employees are permitted to assist valid non-profit organizations during paid work time. Among the organizations so aided are nursing homes, boy scouts, houses of worship, community service groups, battered women's shelters, rotary clubs, police groups, environmental groups, schools, and nursing homes. Hnmc also allows the public to use various meeting rooms (in non-clinical areas) and its conference center for events. Career days are held for local high schools, fostering entrance of interested and applicable students into the health professions. Although hnmc's parking fees are minimal, free parking is extended to persons in need. Hnmc was one of nine hospitals in new jersey designated by the new jersey department of health (""njdoh"") as a regional medical coordination center (""mcc""). The only facility in bergen county to be so designated, hnmc's on-campus mcc was able to be activated in the event of public health emergencies and/or a terrorist attack causing mass casualty incidents, infectious or communicable disease, or other types of public health disruption. The mcc also monitored, on a daily basis, situational awareness of local activity. In 2014, the njdoh lost much of its federal funding for the statewide program, cutting in half the number of mcc's it could support. Hnmc chose not to apply to renew its designation but has maintained most of its capabilities on its own. Given hnmc's proximity to new york city (i.e., five miles north of the george washington bridge), emergency preparedness is deemed necessary to ensure the health and well-being of the community, regardless of the mcc designation. Central to this commitment is a hnmc-funded vice president whose job function includes substantial involvement in preparedness both on-campus and in the community. Hnmc has long been recognized by state and federal sectors for its expertise in emergency preparedness and response. A frequent participant in local and new york city disaster drills, hnmc has participated in several large scale disaster drills, as well as drills conducted by the centers for disease control involving local, county, state, and federal agencies' emergency response to threats of public health significance. Hnmc maintains its designation by the federal division of global migration and quarantine to deal with possible communicable diseases and acts of bioterrorism occurring on public health conveyances. Hnmc is also active in the northern new jersey urban area security initiative. Members of holy name ems serve on the statewide nj ems task force. The medical center maintains a special operations team comprised of paramedics and emergency medical technicians who are ready to respond 24 hours a day, 7 days a week to assist local communities with emergencies. During 2014, hnmc prepared and taught courses in responding to an active shooter situation. Devised in conjunction with the police department of teaneck, nj, hnmc's video training was used during over 2,000 hours of training."
201503209349304230,221487322,"SCHEDULE H, PART III, SECTION A; LINE 4","Bad debt expense was calculated using the providers' bad debt expense from its financial statements, net of accounts written off at charges. Hnmc and its affiliates prepare and issue audited consolidated financial statements. The attached texts were obtained from the footnotes to the audited financial statements of hnmc and subsidiaries. Patient accounts receivable and net patient service revenue Patient accounts receivable and net patient service revenue from third-party programs for which the company receives payment under various reimbursement formulae or negotiated rates are stated at the estimated net amounts realizable and receivable from such payers, which are generally less than the company's established billing rates. The amount of the allowance for doubtful accounts is based upon management's assessment of historical and expected net collections, business and economic conditions, trends in health care coverage and other collection indicators. Additions to the allowance for doubtful accounts result from the provision for bad debts. Accounts written off as uncollectible are deducted from the allowance for doubtful accounts. Net patient service revenue is reported at the estimated net realizable amounts from patients, third-party payers, and others for services rendered and includes retroactive revenue adjustments due to ongoing and future audits, reviews, and investigations. Charity care For patients that do not receive free care and who are deemed eligible for charity care, care given but not paid for is classified as charity care. Management believes that, because of the difficulties involved with obtaining patient cooperation, the present charity care guidelines understate the medical center's charity care amounts and overstate the level of bad debts reported. The cost of charity care is estimated by utilizing a cost accounting system, and includes the direct and indirect cost of providing charity care services."
201503209349304230,221487322,"SCHEDULE H, PART III, SECTION B; LINE 8","Medicare costs were derived from the hospital's cost accounting system. Medicare underpayments and bad debt are considered to be community benefit and associated costs are includable on the form 990, schedule h, part i. The organization feels that medicare underpayments (shortfall) and bad debt are community benefit and associated costs are includable on the form 990, schedule h, part i. As outlined more fully below the organization believes that these services and related costs promote the health of the community as a whole and are rendered in conjunction with the organization's charitable tax-exempt purposes and mission in providing medically necessary health care services to all individuals in a non-discriminatory manner without regard to race, color, creed, sex, national origin, religion or ability to pay and consistent with the community benefit standard promulgated by the irs. The community benefit standard is the current standard for a hospital for recognition as a tax-exempt and charitable organization under internal revenue code (""irc"") 501(c)(3). The medical center is recognized as a tax-exempt entity and charitable organization under 501(c)(3) of the irc. Although there is no definition in the tax code for the term ""charitable,"" a regulation promulgated by the department of the treasury provides some guidance and states that ""[t]he term charitable is used in section 501(c)(3) in its generally accepted legal sense,"" and provides examples of charitable purposes, including: the relief of the poor or unprivileged; the promotion of social welfare; and the advancement of education, religion, and science. Note it does not explicitly address the activities of hospitals. In the absence of explicit statutory or regulatory requirements applying the term ""charitable"" to hospitals, it has been left to the irs to determine the criteria hospitals must meet to qualify as irc 501(c)(3) charitable organizations. The original standard was known as the charity care standard. This standard was replaced by the irs with the community benefit standard which is the current standard. Charity care standard In 1956, the irs issued revenue ruling 56-185, which addressed the requirements hospitals needed to meet in order to qualify for irc 501(c)(3) status. One of these requirements is known as the ""charity care standard."" under the standard, a hospital had to provide, to the extent of its financial ability, free or reduced-cost care to patients unable to pay for it. A hospital that expected full payment did not, according to the ruling, provide charity care based on the fact that some patients ultimately failed to pay. The ruling emphasized that a low level of charity care did not necessarily mean that a hospital had failed to meet the requirement since that level could reflect its financial ability to provide such care. The ruling also noted that publicly supported community hospitals would normally qualify as charitable organizations because they serve the entire community, and a low level of charity care would not affect a hospital's exempt status if it was due to the surrounding community's lack of charitable demands. Community benefit standard In 1969, the irs issued revenue ruling 69-545, which ""remove[d]"" from revenue ruling 56-185 ""the requirements relating to caring for patients without charge or at rates below cost."" under the standard developed in revenue ruling 69-545, which is known as the ""community benefit standard,"" hospitals are judged on whether they promote the health of a broad class of individuals in the community. The ruling involved a hospital that only admitted individuals who could pay for the services (by themselves, private insurance, or public programs such as medicare), but operated a full-time emergency room that was open to everyone. The irs ruled that the hospital qualified as a charitable organization because it promoted the health of people in its community. The irs reasoned that because the promotion of health was a charitable purpose according to the general law of charity, it fell within the ""generally accepted legal sense"" of the term ""charitable,"" as required by treasury reg. 1.501(c)(3)-1(d)(2). The irs ruling stated that the promotion of health, like the relief of poverty and the advancement of education and religion, is one of the purposes in the general law of charity that is deemed beneficial to the community as a whole even though the class of beneficiaries eligible to receive a direct benefit from its activities does not include all members of the community, such as indigent members of the community, provided that the class is not so small that its relief is not of benefit to the community. The irs concluded that the hospital was ""promoting the health of a class of persons that is broad enough to benefit the community"" because its emergency room was open to all and it provided care to everyone who could pay, whether directly or through third-party reimbursement. Other characteristics of the hospital that the irs highlighted included the following: its surplus funds were used to improve patient care, expand hospital facilities, and advance medical training, education, and research; it was controlled by a board of trustees that consisted of independent civic leaders; and hospital medical staff privileges were available to all qualified physicians. Medicare underpayments and bad debt are community benefit and associated costs are includable on the form 990, schedule h, part i. The american hospital association (""aha"") holds the position that medicare underpayments (or, ""shortfalls"") and bad debt are community benefit and thus includable on the form 990, schedule h, part i. The medical center agrees with the aha's position. As outlined in the aha letter to the irs dated august 21, 2007 with respect to the first published draft of the new form 990 and schedule h, the aha stated that the irs should incorporate the full value of the community benefit provided by hospitals by counting medicare underpayments (shortfall) as quantifiable community benefit for the following reasons: - the provision of care for the elderly and serving medicare patients is an essential part of the community benefit standard. - medicare, like medicaid, does not fund the full cost of care. Medicare's reimbursement to hospitals equates to only 92 cents for every dollar spent by the hospitals on care of medicare patients. The medicare payment advisory commission (""medpac"") in its march 2007 report to congress cautioned that underpayment will worsen. - many medicare beneficiaries, like their medicaid counterparts, are poor. More than 46 percent of medicare spending is for beneficiaries whose income is below 200 percent of the federal poverty level. Many of those medicare beneficiaries are also eligible for medicaid, the so called ""dual eligibles."" There is a very compelling public policy reason to treat medicare and medicaid underpayments similarly for purposes of a hospital's community benefit and include these costs on form 990, schedule h, part i. Medicare underpayment must be shouldered by the hospital in order to continue treating the community's elderly and poor. These underpayments represent a real cost of serving the community and should count as a quantifiable community benefit. Both the aha and the medical center also regard patient bad debt as a community benefit and thus includable on the form 990, schedule h, part i. Similar to medicare underpayment (shortfalls), there also are compelling reasons that patient bad debt should be counted as quantifiable community benefit as noted below: - a significant majority of bad debt is attributable to low-income patients, who, for many reasons, decline to complete the forms required to establish eligibility for hospitals' charity care or financial assistance programs. A 2006 congressional budget office (""cbo"") report, non-profit hospitals and the provision of community benefits, cited two studies indicating that ""the great majority of bad debt was attributable to patients with incomes below 200% of the federal poverty line."" - the report also noted that a substantial portion of bad debt is actually pending charity care. Unlike bad debt in other industries, hospital bad debt is complicated by the fact that hospitals follow their mission to the community and treat every patient that comes through their emergency departments, regardless of ability to pay. Patients who have outstanding bills are not turned away, in sharp contrast to other industries. Bad debt is further complicated by the auditing industry's standards on reporting charity care. Many patients cannot or do not provide the necessary, extensive documentation required to be deemed charity care by auditors. As a result, roughly 40% of bad debt is pending charity care. - the cbo concluded that its findings ""support the validity of the use of uncompensated care (bad debt and charity care) as a measure of community benefits,"" assum"
201503209349304230,221487322,"SCHEDULE H, PART III, SECTION B; LINE 9B","Accounts considered to be charity care are not included in the bad debt expense but, rather, accounted for as an allowance. It is the policy of hnmc and subsidiaries' business office to treat all patients equally regardless of insurance and their ability to pay. For accounts determined to be ""self-pay"" and/or accounts with balance after primary insurance payments, the collection policy requires the sending of three statements, a minimum of one pre-collection letter, and telephone contact for any account over $5,000, or at the discretion of the account representative and/or supervisor. The medical center also has a charity care access policy to assure patients are provided with charity care assistance as determined by state and federal regulations. It is the policy to inform all patients deemed self-pay of the appropriate assistance programs available. Patients applying for charity care assistance are financially screened by a resource advisor to determine eligibility according to state and federal guidelines and are informed of documentation required to complete a charity care application. Patients not eligible for charity care receive financial counseling for all other options. Qualified patients are referred to all appropriate agencies or programs to meet other financial needs. At the time of the patient visit, and as part of the registration process at the medical center, the following options are made available to patients: - financial counseling for possible eligibility for medical assistance, including medicaid and ssi; - financial counseling for possible eligibility for the new jersey hospital care payment assistance program; and - financial arrangements including: 1. Cash/checks/credit card (american express, discover, visa, mastercard), 2. Flexible payment plans. In addition to the above options, the medical center has established a self-pay assistance program for its uninsured patients that do not qualify for either medicaid or the new jersey hospital care payment assistance program. Patients whose income falls between 300% and 500% of the federal poverty guideline are eligible for rates that are reflective of medicare reimbursement, as referred by the state of new jersey. For patients whose income is above 500% of the federal poverty guidelines, the medical center utilizes a compassionate care fee schedule."
201503209349304230,221487322,"SCHEDULE H, PART VI; QUESTION 2","Hnmc utilizes a variety of means by which it identifies and analyzes patient care needs. Among them are: patient satisfaction data; analysis of demographics; analysis of utilization and market trends; review of externally published data and information; acuity levels (daily planning of staffing); and individual projects/evaluation/reviews. Hnmc also commissions external specialists to conduct surveys and focus groups of individuals, households, physicians, and others. Hnmc also is a member of the bergen county community health improvement program (""chip""), whose mission is to evaluate and address the health needs of the county. The chip produces an extensive, very useful, database demonstrating the needs of the county's residents. Hnmc is a founding member of the northern new jersey maternal-child health consortium (now the partnership for maternal and child health of northern new jersey), whose mission is to educate and promote appropriate healthcare to woman and infants in the area. Again, a complete needs assessment is performed every three years and is provided to members for their use. In addition, us census bureau data is utilized, as is purchased market data, and databases of all acute and same-day care throughout both new jersey and new york, the source of which is billing data provided to the respective state departments of health. Such databases provide perhaps the greatest wealth of clinical, demographic, financial and other information, and are extremely valuable in understanding and addressing the needs of the communities served by hnmc. Data from the county and state health departments, and from the new jersey hospital association, are also used. In accordance with provisions of the affordable care act, enacted march 23, 2010, the medical center began a comprehensive community health needs assessment (""chna"") in late 2011 in cooperation with the bergen county ""chip"" and four other hospitals whose service areas also include municipalities in bergen county. This chna was completed in 2013. The medical center also created a hnmc-specific chna that addresses its service areas in northern hudson county, incorporates the bergen county chna, and provides an implementation plan for all areas. The two documents provide a wealth of information with respect to the needs of the community served and are posted on the medical center's website."
201503209349304230,221487322,"SCHEDULE H, PART VI; QUESTION 3","Prior to or during an admission, all patients without insurance are screened for possible assistance from other sources (e.g., medicaid, veteran administration, s.s.i., or municipal welfare). If the patient is found to be ineligible for any or all of the aforementioned, the patient will be screened for charity care. The education of patients at hnmc is provided in-person by knowledgeable medical center personnel at the time of the initial screening, and accompanied by a packet of information that includes all contact information as well. Arrangements for follow up are typically made immediately. If the patient qualifies for charity care, the patient is not billed for services. The medical center's billing and collection policy includes specific language stating that charity care patients are not billed. Through its compassionate care program, hnmc further assists uninsured patients who do not qualify for charity care and who are ineligible for medicare, medicaid or other federal and state insurance programs. The purpose of the program is to decrease the financial burden of patients in the community served by hnmc. If the patient meets certain eligibility requirements for financial assistance as described below, further discounts will be applied to the patient's bill. - self-pay patients are eligible for the compassionate care fee schedule regardless of income. - patients whose income levels fall within the published hhs poverty guidelines and do not qualify for benefits under the federal undocumented alien program, nj state medicaid program, or charity care program, will be considered for additional discounts. These discounts will be provided to patients who meet the required guidelines. - patients who qualify for the n.j. Medical care assistance program and whose income falls within 200%-300% of the federal poverty limits will be eligible for discounts ranging from 20%-100% off of gross billed charges. Patients who qualify for this program, but who have a balance after the discount, will be responsible for between 20%-80% of the n.j. Medicaid rate. - patients who do not qualify for the n.j. Medical care assistance program and whose income fall within 300%-500% of the federal poverty limits will be eligible for a discount based upon medicare rates. - patients whose income is above 500% of the federal poverty limits will be eligible for hnmc compassionate care fee schedule as stated above."
201503209349304230,221487322,"SCHEDULE H, PART VI; QUESTION 4","Located in teaneck, in the southern portion of bergen county and approximately five miles to the northwest of new york city, hnmc's primary service area (""psa"") comprises 15 municipalities in bergen county and 3 municipalities in hudson county, new jersey. Hnmc's secondary service area (""ssa"") includes 17 municipalities in bergen county and 2 municipalities in hudson county. Together, the psa and ssa account for approximately 80 percent of the medical center's admission volume. As the sole catholic hospital in an area that is estimated at more than 50% roman catholic, hnmc also draws from towns well beyond both the psa and ssa. The majority of psa towns have an average population of 27,500, and are located in the southern half of bergen county. Overall, the service area is 44% hispanic, although the proportions differ markedly between bergen and hudson: 76% of the residents of bergen psa towns are not hispanic; while the four hudson county towns together count 76% of their residents as hispanic. The racial mix of the psa is approximately 60% white, 22% asian, 10% black, and 8% other, including multi-racial persons. Certain towns in the region are heavily korean; korean/asian presence is much less pronounced in the four hudson county towns. The broad age make-up of the primary service area includes 23% aged up to 19; 50% aged 20-54; and 27% aged 55 and older. The last category is projected to see the most significant growth during the next fifteen years. With the exception of two hudson county towns, all ssa zip codes are located throughout bergen county. The towns in this service area are much smaller than those of the psa, averaging only 14,000 residents each. In stark contrast to the largely hispanic hudson county psa towns, the two hudson ssa towns are only 20% hispanic. The overall racial mix of the service area is 76% white, 13% asian, 4% black, and 7% other, including multi-racial persons. The overall korean presence is significant, but only half that seen in the primary service area. The area's age mix is similar to the psa, with 23% aged up to 19; 51% aged 20-54; and 26% aged 55 and older. The medical center's service area is primarily suburban, with many residents working outside bergen county in places such as new york city. However, there are large employers in the service area, e.g., other hospitals, a large sports chain, a large communications firm, a large pharmaceutical firm, and a large commercial laboratory. Residents of hnmc's service area are also served by another community hospital and a tertiary care facility with trauma services. Hnmc's psa covers a majority of the towns serviced by the other community hospital, whereas the tertiary care facility's primary service area also includes many towns to the west that are not part of hnmc's service area. Given the number of service area residents who work in nearby new york city, it is not surprising that a small portion of these residents also receive their healthcare in manhattan. While the service area is predominantly non-hispanic caucasian, both hispanics (of any race) and asian populations (principally korean) are the fastest growing groups. In response, the medical center has programs addressing these groups' needs, and physicians and nurses fluent in the applicable languages. In 2008, approximately 75 korean physicians joined the medical staff, adding to the need for staff and services to meet this growing segment of the community. In 2014, the medical center expanded its korean medical program to include a focus on chinese and filipino residents as well, renaming the service ""asian health services."""

The trustees' understanding of the service area is thus enhanced, as is their understanding of the need to reinvest funds in improvements in patient care, medical education and research. As part of its charitable purpose, hnmc provides a wide array of services to the community, targeted toward improving the health of the community. The majority of such services are free. A small sampling of such activities is provided below. - frequent health fairs throughout the region are given. At these fairs risk assessments, screenings and literature are provided (many in spanish and korean, as well as english). - immunizations are provided. - free and/or very low fee transportation (e.g., for cancer treatment, dialysis) is available. - community health nurses and mobile learning are also provided. - staff from various departments throughout the medical center visit local schools to provide health classes. - screenings, e.g., blood pressure, cancer, stroke, diabetes, prostate cancer, breast cancer, osteoporosis, peripheral artery disease, skin cancer, colon cancer, and other clinical screening and education are provided, often as part of community programs specific to the particular disease group. - senior centers are supported with free exercise classes, lectures and screenings. - support groups are provided, such as cancer, perinatal bereavement, adult bereavement, new mothers, diabetes, smoking, and cardiac disease. - hnmc's als bike team, als and bls vehicles and/or special operations vehicles are present at events occurring in municipalities in hnmc's service area without charge. - courses (provided either free or for a low fee) are provided throughout the year. Examples include: cpr certification, defensive driving, general and specialty (e.g., osteoporosis) exercise, breastfeeding preparation, stress management, diabetes self-management, baby care basics, weight management, and parenting. - classes to promote better health are abundant: yoga, weight reduction, osteoporosis, proper hand-washing, tai chi, cooking for cardiac patients. - lectures, often involving hnmc's medical staff as presenters, are provided, the majority of which are free. Men's health, women's health, a mid-life and menopause lecture series, sleep disorders, allergies, depression, asthma, uterine fibroids, copd, stroke, hypertension, mental wellness, cardiac issues, alzheimer's, joint replacement, sleep apnea, cancers, children's health, disaster preparedness, and general health and well-being are among the topics presented. - hnmc's fully updated and redesigned website (www.holyname.org) provides a wealth of free consumer health information. The site includes an on-line medical library housing information on diseases and conditions, surgeries and procedures, vitamins and supplements, nutrition, wellness, and a drug reference. On-line risk assessments and quizzes are also available, as is the ability to set up a personal health page. Information is also presented in spanish, and a korean language version is also available (www.kholyname.org). A new interactive body guide (""symptom checker"") to research health information about the symptoms the user is experiencing. - hnmc's ""ask-my-nurse"" program, which provides 24/7 phone access to registered nurses, is provided free of charge. - blood drives are hosted regularly at hnmc. Many health services are subsidized by hnmc, such as its clinics, hospice and hemodialysis programs. Each year the medical center contributes to airfare, supplies and other support for hnmc nurses and doctors to travel to third world countries (e.g., haiti) to provide medical care, including surgery, to persons who otherwise would never receive adequate treatment due to poverty and lack of access. Hnmc supports the bergen volunteer medical initiative (""bvmi""), which provides free care to persons in need and other similar programs. Hnmc also participates in the women, infants and children (""wic"") and health start programs, providing nutritional and social services, ancillary services and other programs to participants. Inexpensive medically supervised day care for ill children is available on campus to working parents in the community affording them the ability to work even when a child is sick. Senior or disabled persons requiring medical day care are transported free of charge to hnmc's adult day care program, reducing the burden on family caretakers. Hnmc's emergency department (""ed"") is open 24 hours a day, every day of the year. Although the ed generally is able to cover its costs, it provides a significant amount of uncompensated care and is a well-used resource for many without insurance who rely on it for care. Other services, such as clinics, do not cover their costs, and hnmc absorbs the additional expense. Language interpretation is available for approximately 220 languages at the medical center through use of a commercial service that provides a live translator 24/7 free of charge to the patient and family. Hnmc has an open medical staff with privileges available to all qualified physicians in the area. Hnmc has intentionally sought out physicians fluent in spanish and who care for hispanic populations, and provides free transportation for such populations (as well as others) unable to access care on their own. Hnmc has also added many korean physicians to its medical staff and provides a korean clinic weekly, with korean speaking physicians and nurses, as the asian community is one of the fastest growing sectors in the county. Recent additions of staff to support the expanded Chinese and Filipino populations address needs specific to these groups. Care is provided in a culturally sensitive manner. The institute for clinical research at hnmc provides exceptional investigators, facilities, and services for sponsoring agencies that seek to advance patient care through superior clinical research. The institute is dedicated to conducting expeditious, high-quality clinical trials to test new medications, devices, diagnostic modalities and treatment protocols. As a dynamic healthcare institution that has received many honors of distinction for its clinical excellence and compassionate patient care, hnmc is well-suited to participate in the quest for scientific breakthroughs. Hnmc's state-of-the-art facilities match the highest standards for carrying out today's most promising clinical research. The institute provides sponsors with research support throughout all the stages of their clinical trials. Since its inception, hnmc has been actively involved in health professions education, training, educating and mentoring healthcare professionals. The holy name school of nursing was founded in 1925, with a dedication to fostering the well-being and dignity of all individuals, sick or well. The registered nurse (""rn"") program is a highly competitive registered nurse diploma program, and is accredited with the new jersey board of nursing and the national league for nursing accrediting commission. In 1972 the school expanded to include a practical nurse (""lpn"") program as well, which is a 12-month practical nurse diploma program also accredited with the new jersey board of nursing. Both programs continue to supply the region with highly skilled nurses of many ethnicities and age groups. In addition to its own nursing school, hnmc provides, free of charge, both a training ground and mentoring for students from various health academic programs of several colleges and universities. A variety of ""externships"" are also offered without charge. Career days are also held on campus, and the medical center participates in health career days throughout various schools and communities. Hnmc has a number of academic relationships through which it serves as an educational environment for students. Affiliation agreements are maintained with several colleges and universities for nursing students, and for radiology, nuclear medicine, ultrasound, respiratory, and surgical technicians. Trainees from a university who are predominantly doctor of pharmacy students complete rotations in acute critical care, infectious disease, oncology, nephrology, and administration. Community health students rotate through the medical center as well. Physical and/or occupational therapy students from with ten colleges in new jersey and other states complete clinical rotations at the medical center; hnmc employees serve as supervisors and clinical instructors for these students. Undergraduate, nurse practitioner and nursing doctoral students from yet another university complete rotations with oversight from hnmc's department of nursing education. Each year, hnmc accepts a small number of residents in health policy, health finance, and health mana"

RESEARCH HAS CONTINUALLY SHOWN THAT WHEN THE FACTORS INFLUENCING HEALTH ARE EXPLORED, HEALTH CARE ACTUALLY PLAYS THE SMALLEST ROLE PROPORTIONATELY. A REPORT IN THE JOURNAL OF AMERICAN MEDICAL ASSOCIATION AND THE CENTER FOR DISEASE CONTROL (MCGINNIS, 1996) SUGGESTS THAT THE FACTORS IMPACTING HEALTH ARE AS FOLLOWS: LIFESTYLE AND BEHAVIORS, 50%, ENVIRONMENT (HUMAN AND NATURAL), 20%, GENETICS AND HUMAN BIOLOGY, 20%, AND HEALTH CARE, 10%. COMMUNITY BUILDING ACTIVITIES HELP TO ADDRESS THE OTHER INDICATORS OUTSIDE OF THE ROLE TRADITIONALLY PLAYED BY HEALTH-CARE ORGANIZATIONS. THESE ACTIVITIES ARE ALMOST EXCLUSIVELY DONE IN SOME FORM OF PARTNERSHIP IN WHICH THE COMMUNITY OR OTHER ORGANIZATIONS ARE BETTER SUITED TO ADDRESS. HEALTH-CARE ORGANIZATIONS GENERALLY PROVIDE TIMELY AND SPECIFIC RESOURCES TO HELP THESE ISSUES. HEALTH-CARE ORGANIZATIONS CAN BE A RICH AND VALUABLE COMMUNITY RESOURCE IN WAYS NOT TYPICALLY CONSIDERED. OFTEN THE MOST EFFECTIVE WAY TO HELP IMPACT AND IMPROVE THE COMMUNITY HEALTH STATUS IS TO SUPPORT OTHER AGENCIES AND ORGANIZATIONS IN A VARIETY OF WAYS OUTSIDE OF HEALTH SERVICES. THIS IS OFTEN DONE THROUGH CASH OR IN-KIND SERVICES TO SUPPORT OTHER NON-PROFITS, DONATIONS OF DURABLE MEDICAL EQUIPMENT AND SUPPLIES TO CERTAIN AGENCIES, OR THROUGH LEADERSHIP AND EDUCATIONAL EXPERTISE. CENTRAL IOWA HOSPITAL CORPORATION D/B/A UNITYPOINT HEALTH-DES MOINES CONTRIBUTES FINANCIALLY TO A WIDE VARIETY OF COMMUNITY ORGANIZATIONS THAT ADDRESS THE BROADER NEEDS OF THE COMMUNITY. THESE DONATIONS ALLOW OTHER NON-PROFIT ORGANIZATIONS TO FULFILL THEIR MISSIONS TO IMPROVE THE WELL BEING OF THE COMMUNITY AND CONTRIBUTE TO ITS OVERALL HEALTH STATUS IN WAYS THAT MAY DIFFER FROM THE DIRECT SERVICES OF THE HOSPITAL ORGANIZATION.

MEDICARE UNDERPAYMENTS AND BAD DEBT ARE COMMUNITY BENEFIT AND ASSOCIATED COSTS ARE INCLUDABLE ON THE FORM 990, SCHEDULE H, PART I. THE ORGANIZATION FEELS THAT MEDICARE UNDERPAYMENTS (SHORTFALL) AND BAD DEBT ARE COMMUNITY BENEFIT AND ASSOCIATED COSTS ARE INCLUDABLE ON THE FORM 990, SCHEDULE H, PART I. AS OUTLINED MORE FULLY BELOW THE ORGANIZATION BELIEVES THAT THESE SERVICES AND RELATED COSTS PROMOTE THE HEALTH OF THE COMMUNITY AS A WHOLE AND ARE RENDERED IN CONJUNCTION WITH THE ORGANIZATION'S CHARITABLE TAX-EXEMPT PURPOSES AND MISSION IN PROVIDING MEDICALLY NECESSARY HEALTHCARE SERVICES TO ALL INDIVIDUAL'S IN A NON-DISCRIMINATORY MANNER WITHOUT REGARD TO RACE, COLOR, CREED, SEX, NATIONAL ORIGIN, RELIGION OR ABILITY TO PAY AND CONSISTENT WITH THE COMMUNITY BENEFIT STANDARD PROMULGATED BY THE IRS. THE COMMUNITY BENEFIT STANDARD IS THE CURRENT STANDARD FOR A HOSPITAL FOR RECOGNITION AS A TAX-EXEMPT AND CHARITABLE ORGANIZATION UNDER INTERNAL REVENUE CODE (""IRC"") 501(C)(3). THE ORGANIZATION IS RECOGNIZED AS A TAX-EXEMPT ENTITY AND CHARITABLE ORGANIZATION UNDER 501(C)(3) OF THE IRC. ALTHOUGH THERE IS NO DEFINITION IN THE TAX CODE FOR THE TERM ""CHARITABLE"" A REGULATION PROMULGATED BY THE DEPARTMENT OF THE TREASURY PROVIDES SOME GUIDANCE AND STATES THAT ""[T]HE TERM CHARITABLE IS USED IN SECTION 501(C)(3) IN ITS GENERALLY ACCEPTED LEGAL SENSE,"" AND PROVIDES EXAMPLES OF CHARITABLE PURPOSES, INCLUDING THE RELIEF OF THE POOR OR UNPRIVILEGED; THE PROMOTION OF SOCIAL WELFARE; AND THE ADVANCEMENT OF EDUCATION, RELIGION, AND SCIENCE. NOTE IT DOES NOT EXPLICITLY ADDRESS THE ACTIVITIES OF HOSPITALS. IN THE ABSENCE OF EXPLICIT STATUTORY OR REGULATORY REQUIREMENTS APPLYING THE TERM ""CHARITABLE"" TO HOSPITALS, IT HAS BEEN LEFT TO THE IRS TO DETERMINE THE CRITERIA HOSPITALS MUST MEET TO QUALIFY AS IRC 501(C)(3) CHARITABLE ORGANIZATIONS. THE ORIGINAL STANDARD WAS KNOWN AS THE CHARITY CARE STANDARD. THIS STANDARD WAS REPLACED BY THE IRS WITH THE COMMUNITY BENEFIT STANDARD WHICH IS THE CURRENT STANDARD. CHARITY CARE STANDARD IN 1956, THE IRS ISSUED REVENUE RULING 56-185, WHICH ADDRESSED THE REQUIREMENTS HOSPITALS NEEDED TO MEET IN ORDER TO QUALIFY FOR IRC 501(C)(3) STATUS. ONE OF THESE REQUIREMENTS IS KNOWN AS THE ""CHARITY CARE STANDARD."" UNDER THE STANDARD, A HOSPITAL HAD TO PROVIDE, TO THE EXTENT OF ITS FINANCIAL ABILITY, FREE OR REDUCED-COST CARE TO PATIENTS UNABLE TO PAY FOR IT. A HOSPITAL THAT EXPECTED FULL PAYMENT DID NOT, ACCORDING TO THE RULING, PROVIDE CHARITY CARE BASED ON THE FACT THAT SOME PATIENTS ULTIMATELY FAILED TO PAY. THE RULING EMPHASIZED THAT A LOW LEVEL OF CHARITY CARE DID NOT NECESSARILY MEAN THAT A HOSPITAL HAD FAILED TO MEET THE REQUIREMENT SINCE THAT LEVEL COULD REFLECT ITS FINANCIAL ABILITY TO PROVIDE SUCH CARE. THE RULING ALSO NOTED THAT PUBLICLY SUPPORTED COMMUNITY HOSPITALS WOULD NORMALLY QUALIFY AS CHARITABLE ORGANIZATIONS BECAUSE THEY SERVE THE ENTIRE COMMUNITY, AND A LOW LEVEL OF CHARITY CARE WOULD NOT AFFECT A HOSPITAL'S EXEMPT STATUS IF IT WAS DUE TO THE SURROUNDING COMMUNITY'S LACK OF CHARITABLE DEMANDS. COMMUNITY BENEFIT STANDARD IN 1969, THE IRS ISSUED REVENUE RULING 69-545, WHICH ""REMOVE[D]"" FROM REVENUE RULING 56-185 ""THE REQUIREMENTS RELATING TO CARING FOR PATIENTS WITHOUT CHARGE OR AT RATES BELOW COST."" UNDER THE STANDARD DEVELOPED IN REVENUE RULING 69-545, WHICH IS KNOWN AS THE ""COMMUNITY BENEFIT STANDARD,"" HOSPITALS ARE JUDGED ON WHETHER THEY PROMOTE THE HEALTH OF A BROAD CLASS OF INDIVIDUALS IN THE COMMUNITY. THE RULING INVOLVED A HOSPITAL THAT ONLY ADMITTED INDIVIDUALS WHO COULD PAY FOR THE SERVICES (BY THEMSELVES, PRIVATE INSURANCE, OR PUBLIC PROGRAMS SUCH AS MEDICARE), BUT OPERATED A FULL-TIME EMERGENCY ROOM THAT WAS OPEN TO EVERYONE. THE IRS RULED THAT THE HOSPITAL QUALIFIED AS A CHARITABLE ORGANIZATION BECAUSE IT PROMOTED THE HEALTH OF PEOPLE IN ITS COMMUNITY. THE IRS REASONED THAT BECAUSE THE PROMOTION OF HEALTH WAS A CHARITABLE PURPOSE ACCORDING TO THE GENERAL LAW OF CHARITY, IT FELL WITHIN THE ""GENERALLY ACCEPTED LEGAL SENSE"" OF THE TERM ""CHARITABLE,"" AS REQUIRED BY TREAS. REG. 1.501(C)(3)-1(D)(2). THE IRS RULING STATED THAT THE PROMOTION OF HEALTH, LIKE THE RELIEF OF POVERTY AND THE ADVANCEMENT OF EDUCATION AND RELIGION, IS ONE OF THE PURPOSES IN THE GENERAL LAW OF CHARITY THAT IS DEEMED BENEFICIAL TO THE COMMUNITY AS A WHOLE EVEN THOUGH THE CLASS OF BENEFICIARIES ELIGIBLE TO RECEIVE A DIRECT BENEFIT FROM ITS ACTIVITIES DOES NOT INCLUDE ALL MEMBERS OF THE COMMUNITY, SUCH AS INDIGENT MEMBERS OF THE COMMUNITY, PROVIDED THAT THE CLASS IS NOT SO SMALL THAT ITS RELIEF IS NOT OF BENEFIT TO THE COMMUNITY. THE IRS CONCLUDED THAT THE HOSPITAL WAS ""PROMOTING THE HEALTH OF A CLASS OF PERSONS THAT IS BROAD ENOUGH TO BENEFIT THE COMMUNITY"" BECAUSE ITS EMERGENCY ROOM WAS OPEN TO ALL AND IT PROVIDED CARE TO EVERYONE WHO COULD PAY, WHETHER DIRECTLY OR THROUGH THIRD-PARTY REIMBURSEMENT. OTHER CHARACTERISTICS OF THE HOSPITAL THAT THE IRS HIGHLIGHTED INCLUDED THE FOLLOWING: ITS SURPLUS FUNDS WERE USED TO IMPROVE PATIENT CARE, EXPAND HOSPITAL FACILITIES, AND ADVANCE MEDICAL TRAINING, EDUCATION, AND RESEARCH; IT WAS CONTROLLED BY A BOARD OF TRUSTEES THAT CONSISTED OF INDEPENDENT CIVIC LEADERS; AND HOSPITAL MEDICAL STAFF PRIVILEGES WERE AVAILABLE TO ALL QUALIFIED PHYSICIANS. MEDICARE UNDERPAYMENTS AND BAD DEBT ARE COMMUNITY BENEFIT AND ASSOCIATED COSTS ARE INCLUDABLE ON THE FORM 990, SCHEDULE H, PART I. THE AMERICAN HOSPITAL ASSOCIATION (""AHA"") FEELS THAT MEDICARE UNDERPAYMENTS (SHORTFALL) AND BAD DEBT ARE COMMUNITY BENEFIT AND THUS INCLUDABLE ON THE FORM 990, SCHEDULE H, PART I. THIS ORGANIZATION AGREES WITH THE AHA POSITION. AS OUTLINED IN THE AHA LETTER TO THE IRS DATED AUGUST 21, 2007 WITH RESPECT TO THE FIRST PUBLISHED DRAFT OF THE NEW FORM 990 AND SCHEDULE H, THE AHA FELT THAT THE IRS SHOULD INCORPORATE THE FULL VALUE OF THE COMMUNITY BENEFIT THAT HOSPITALS PROVIDE BY COUNTING MEDICARE UNDERPAYMENTS (SHORTFALL) AS QUANTIFIABLE COMMUNITY BENEFIT FOR THE FOLLOWING REASONS: - PROVIDING CARE FOR THE ELDERLY AND SERVING MEDICARE PATIENTS IS AN ESSENTIAL PART OF THE COMMUNITY BENEFIT STANDARD. - MEDICARE, LIKE MEDICAID, DOES NOT PAY THE FULL COST OF CARE. RECENTLY, MEDICARE REIMBURSES HOSPITALS ONLY 92 CENTS FOR EVERY DOLLAR THEY SPEND TO TAKE CARE OF MEDICARE PATIENTS. THE MEDICARE PAYMENT ADVISORY COMMISSION (""MEDPAC"") IN ITS MARCH 2007 REPORT TO CONGRESS CAUTIONED THAT UNDERPAYMENT WILL GET EVEN WORSE, WITH MARGINS REACHING A 10-YEAR LOW AT NEGATIVE 5.4 PERCENT. - MANY MEDICARE BENEFICIARIES, LIKE THEIR MEDICAID COUNTERPARTS, ARE POOR. MORE THAN 46 PERCENT OF MEDICARE SPENDING IS FOR BENEFICIARIES WHOSE INCOME IS BELOW 200 PERCENT OF THE FEDERAL POVERTY LEVEL. MANY OF THOSE MEDICARE BENEFICIARIES ARE ALSO ELIGIBLE FOR MEDICAID -- SO CALLED ""DUAL ELIGIBLES."" THERE IS EVERY COMPELLING PUBLIC POLICY REASON TO TREAT MEDICARE AND MEDICAID UNDERPAYMENTS SIMILARLY FOR PURPOSES OF A HOSPITAL'S COMMUNITY BENEFIT AND INCLUDE THESE COSTS ON FORM 990, SCHEDULE H, PART I. MEDICARE UNDERPAYMENT MUST BE SHOULDERED BY THE HOSPITAL IN ORDER TO CONTINUE TREATING THE COMMUNITY'S ELDERLY AND POOR. THESE UNDERPAYMENTS REPRESENT A REAL COST OF SERVING THE COMMUNITY AND SHOULD COUNT AS A QUANTIFIABLE COMMUNITY BENEFIT. BOTH THE AHA AND THIS ORGANIZATION ALSO FEEL THAT PATIENT BAD DEBT IS A COMMUNITY BENEFIT AND THUS INCLUDABLE ON THE FORM 990, SCHEDULE H, PART I. LIKE MEDICARE UNDERPAYMENT (SHORTFALLS), THERE ALSO ARE COMPELLING REASONS THAT PATIENT BAD DEBT SHOULD BE COUNTED AS QUANTIFIABLE COMMUNITY BENEFIT AS FOLLOWS: - A SIGNIFICANT MAJORITY OF BAD DEBT IS ATTRIBUTABLE TO LOW-INCOME PATIENTS, WHO, FOR MANY REASONS, DECLINE TO COMPLETE THE FORMS REQUIRED TO ESTABLISH ELIGIBILITY FOR HOSPITALS' CHARITY CARE OR FINANCIAL ASSISTANCE PROGRAMS. A 2006 CONGRESSIONAL BUDGET OFFICE (""CBO"") REPORT, NONPROFIT HOSPITALS AND THE PROVISION OF COMMUNITY BENEFITS, CITED TWO STUDIES INDICATING THAT ""THE GREAT MAJORITY OF BAD DEBT WAS ATTRIBUTABLE TO PATIENTS WITH INCOMES BELOW 200% OF THE FEDERAL POVERTY LINE."" - THE REPORT ALSO NOTED THAT A SUBSTANTIAL PORTION OF BAD DEBT IS PENDING CHARITY CARE. UNLIKE BAD DEBT IN OTHER INDUSTRIES, HOSPITAL BAD DEBT IS COMPLICATED BY THE FACT THAT HOSPITALS FOLLOW THEIR MISSION TO THE COMMUNITY AND TREAT EVERY PATIENT THAT COMES THROUGH THEIR EMERGENCY DEPARTMENT, REGARDLESS OF ABILITY TO PAY. PATIENTS WHO HAVE OUTSTANDING BILLS ARE NOT TURNED AWAY, UNLIKE OTHER INDUSTRIES. BAD DEBT IS FURTHER COMPLICATED BY THE AUDITING INDUSTRY'S STANDARDS ON REPORTING CHARITY CARE. MANY PATIENTS CANNOT OR DO NOT PROVIDE THE NECESSARY, EXTENSIVE DOCUMENTATION REQUIRED TO BE DEEMED CHARITY CARE BY AUDITORS. AS A RESULT, ROUGHLY 40% OF BAD DEBT IS PENDING CHARITY CARE. - THE CBO CONCLUDED THAT ITS FINDINGS ""SUPPORT THE VALIDITY OF THE USE OF UNCOMPENSATED CARE [BAD DEBT AND CHARITY CARE] AS A MEASURE OF COMMUNITY BENEFITS"" ASSUMING THE FINDINGS ARE GENERALIZABLE NATIONWIDE;"

The position actilvely recruits for vacancies and shortages among hospital employed physicians, and partners with independent practices to help them keep a full complement of physicians across specialties.

In a very real sense, it is the safety-net hospital for the patients in these communities. THE HOSPITAL PROVIDES SERVICES TO ALL PATIENTS REGARDLESS OF THEIR ABILITY TO PAY AND GRANTS CREDIT TO ALL PATIENTS REGARDLESS OF CREDITWORTHINESS AND WITHOUT COLLATERAL. WHILE THE HOSPITAL PRUSUES COLLECTIONS OF AMOUNTS OWED INCLUDING THE USE OF COLLECTION AGENCIES, IT DOES SO IN A MANNER THAT IS RESPECTFUL OF THE NEEDS OF OUR PATIENTS, IN ADHERENCE WITH ALL APPLICABLE LAWS AND IS REFLECTIVE OF OUR VALUES AND PUBLIC MISSION.

THE HOSPITAL APPROVES 98% OF APPLICATIONS IT RECIEVES FOR PATIENT ASSISTANCE. THE COSTING METHODOLOGY USED TO DETERMINE THE AMOUNT REPORTED ON PART III, LINE 2 IS AS FOLLOWS. GROSS BAD DEBT PER THE GENERAL LEDGER IS MULTIPLIED BY THE RATIO OF COST TO CHARGES TO GET AN ESTIMATED COST OF BAD DEBT ATTRIBUTABLE TO PATIENT ACCOUNTS. EXPECTED POOL PAYMENTS ARE ADDED TO THIS RESULT TO GET A TOTAL COMMUNITY BENEFIT.

Communities are identified, strategies are identified and plans are funded, implemented, tracked and measured. Our Board approves the plan and reviews plan progress annually. Because of the size and scope of our services, the approach we use to identify our key communities is based on the strategy, key stakeholder needs, and our capacity. Our community for the KCCHI work groups is Kanawha County as determined by the KCCHI mission. For our CAMC community strategy, community is based on the need identified and population to be addressed. We develop Health Indicator Data Sheets for each of our service area counties and identify key issues to address for all or part of our service area. For example, our Perinatal Telemedicine Project includes 14 rural counties and our Child Advocacy Center and HIV program serve our entire service area. Each strategy is deployed through a planning process that addresses key stakeholder needs and is evaluated based on predetermined criteria for outcomes expected. Cycles of learning have ensured the Civic Affairs Council monetary contributions support community organizations in the service area that are clearly aligned with our community strategy. In addition to addressing community needs and contributing financially, our leadership team serves in key leadership roles for community activities, programs and organizations as well as supports the workforce in participating in many community benefit activities such as Day of Caring and HealthFest.CAMC Teays has a separate CHNA process as described in their Community Benefit report (available at www.camc.org).In addition, CAMC and CAMC Teays Valley Hospital develops County Profiles for each service area county to identify health risks and priorities for the counties.

The Prevention First Program seeks to reduce medical costs, facilitate all aspects of health care, including support of the medical plan established by the primary care physician, while meeting the special needs of low-income children and families in the home environment. Specifically, the Prevention First Program promotes healthy outcomes that will decrease pre-term labor, infant mortality, unplanned C-Section rate, NICU/PICU length of stay and increase infant birth weight while promoting well-child care and immunizations.

Integrated Health Care Providers (IHCPI) is an affiliated company of the CAMC Health System existing to support the mission of CAMC in striving to provide the best healthcare to every patient every day. When the CAMC Health System identifies an essential physician need, an access issue for patients, or when the existing provider community cannot provide an essential service, IHCPI through its affiliation with the CAMC Health System works to fill the gaps. Currently, IHCPI operates the mission critical entity of the David Lee Cancer Center and a host of sub-specialty physician practices primarily operated to support the Level I trauma and tertiary care mission of CAMC. IHCPI practices see a disproportionate share of the underinsured in their practice locations. When many of the sub-specialists are not providing trauma support, they are providing access to care for many who cannot receive services locally such as pediatric dental and oral maxilla-facial care."

201523179349301697,310785684,"Schedule H, Part I, Line 7 Costing Methodology used to calculate financial assistance",Cost of Charity Care was calculated with a cost to charge ratio using Worksheet 2. The cost related to Medicaid patients was determined using the hospital cost accounting system and included both inpatients and outpatients for traditional Medicaid and Medicaid managed care plans. For subsidized services the hospital's cost accounting system is used to determine cost related to the specific service excluding traditional Medicaid and Medicaid managed care patients. Costs for charity and bad debt accounts are deducted using a ratio of cost to charge specific to that subsidized service. Costs for other programs reflect the direct and indirect costs of providing those programs.

201523179349301697,310785684,"Schedule H, Part III, Line 2 Bad debt expense - methodology used to estimate amount","The provision for bad debts is based upon management's assessment of historical and expected net collections considering historical business and economic conditions, trends in health care coverage, and other collection indicators. Net patient accounts are reduced by an allowance for doubtful receivables based upon the hospital's historical collection experience adjusted for current environmental risks and trends for each major payor source. Significant provision is made for self-pay patient accounts in the period of service based on past collection experience. The hospital's concentration of credit risk related to net patient accounts is limited due to the diversity of patients and payors. Net patient accounts consist of amounts due from governmental programs (primarily Medicare and Medicaid), private insurance companies, managed care programs and patients themselves. Net patient service revenue for services provided to patients who have third-party payor coverage is recognized based on contractual rates for services rendered. The hospital recognizes a significant amount of patient service revenue at the time services are rendered even though it does not assess the patient's ability to pay. As a result, the provision for bad debts is presented as a deduction from patient service revenue (net of contractual provisions and discounts). Amounts recognized are subject to adjustment upon review by third-party payors. For uninsured patients that do not qualify for charity care, the hospital recognizes revenue when services are provided. Based on historical experience, a significant portion of the hospital's uninsured patients will be unable or unwilling to pay for services provided. Thus, the hospital records a significant provision for bad debts related to uninsured patients in the period the services are provided. Any discounts applied to self-pay patients would be deemed either Charity or a contractual adjustment. Bad debt would be based on the balance after the charity or contractual adjustment that is deemed uncollectable following a reasonable collection effort."

The hospital's financial assistance policy requires an application and supporting documentation. Therefore, zero dollars are being reported on Part III, Line 3 as amounts included in bad debt that could be attributable to patients eligible under the hospital's financial assistance policy. The hospital follows the Catholic Health Association of the United States policy document, Community Benefit Program, A Revised Resource for Social Accountability (""CHA guidelines"") for determining community benefit.

THE HOSPITALS HAVE IMPLEMENTED A MONTHLY STANDARDIZED APPROACH TO ESTIMATE AND REVIEW THE COLLECTIBILITY OF RECEIVABLES BASED ON THE PAYER CLASSIFICATION AND THE PERIOD THE RECEIVABLES HAVE BEEN OUTSTANDING. PAST DUE BALANCES OVER 90 DAYS FROM THE DATE OF BILLING AND OVER A SPECIFIED AMOUNT ARE CONSIDERED DELINQUENT AND ARE REVIEWED INDIVIDUALLY FOR COLLECTABILITY. ACCOUNT BALANCES ARE WRITTEN OFF AGAINST THE ALLOWANCE WHEN MANAGEMENT FEELS IT IS PROBABLE THE RECEIVABLES WILL NOT BE RECOVERED. HISTORICAL COLLECTION AND PAYER REIMBURSEMENT EXPERIENCE IS AN INTEGRAL PART OF THE ESTIMATION PROCESS RELATED TO RESERVES FOR DOUBTFUL ACCOUNTS. IN ADDITION, THE HOSPITALS ASSESS THE CURRENT STATE OF ITS BILLING FUNCTIONS IN ORDER TO IDENTIFY ANY KNOWN COLLECTION OR REIMBURSEMENT ISSUES IN ORDER TO ASSESS THE IMPACT, IF ANY, ON RESERVE ESTIMATES, WHICH INVOLVES JUDGMENT.

REVISIONS IN RESERVE FOR DOUBTFUL ACCOUNTS ESTIMATES ARE RECORDED AS AN ADJUSTMENT TO PROVISION FOR BAD DEBTS. A SUMMARY OF THE PAYMENT ARRANGEMENTS WITH MAJOR THIRD-PARTY PAYERS FOLLOWS: 1) MEDICARE PAYMENTS: INPATIENT ACUTE CARE SERVICES AND OUTPATIENT SERVICES RENDERED TO MEDICARE PROGRAM BENEFICIARIES ARE PAID AT PROSPECTIVELY DETERMINED RATES. THESE RATES VARY ACCORDING TO A PATIENT CLASSIFICATION SYSTEM THAT IS BASED ON CLINICAL, DIAGNOSTIC, AND OTHER FACTORS. CERTAIN ITEMS, SUCH AS MEDICARE BAD DEBTS, ARE PAID BASED ON A COST REIMBURSEMENT METHODOLOGY. REIMBURSEMENTS FOR COST REIMBURSABLE ITEMS ARE RECEIVED AT TENTATIVE INTERIM RATES, WITH FINAL SETTLEMENT DETERMINED AFTER SUBMISSION OF ANNUAL COST REPORTS BY THE MEDICAL CENTER AND AUDITS THEREOF BY THE MEDICARE FISCAL INTERMEDIARY. 2) NON-MEDICARE PAYMENTS: THE NEW YORK HEALTH CARE REFORM ACT OF 1996, AS UPDATED, GOVERNS PAYMENTS TO HOSPITALS IN NEW YORK STATE (""NYS""). UNDER THIS SYSTEM, HOSPITALS AND ALL NON-MEDICARE PAYORS, EXCEPT MEDICAID, WORKERS' COMPENSATION AND NO-FAULT INSURANCE PROGRAMS, NEGOTIATE HOSPITAL'S PAYMENT RATES. IF NEGOTIATED RATES ARE NOT ESTABLISHED, PAYORS ARE BILLED AT HOSPITALS ESTABLISHED CHARGES. MEDICAID, WORKERS' COMPENSATION AND NO-FAULT PAYORS PAY HOSPITAL RATES PROMULGATED BY THE NEW YORK STATE DEPARTMENT OF HEALTH (""DOH"") ON A PROSPECTIVE BASIS. ADJUSTMENTS TO CURRENT AND PRIOR YEARS' RATES FOR THESE PAYORS WILL CONTINUE TO BE MADE IN THE FUTURE. EFFECTIVE JANUARY 1, 2013 THE DOH UPDATED THE DATA UTILIZED TO CALCULATE THE NYS DRG SERVICE INTENSITY WEIGHTS (""SIWS"") IN ORDER TO UTILIZE MORE CURRENT DATA IN DOH PROMULGATED RATES. EFFECTIVE DECEMBER 1, 2009, NYS IMPLEMENTED INPATIENT REIMBURSEMENT REFORM. THE REFORM UPDATED THE DATA UTILIZED TO CALCULATE THE NYS DRG RATES AND SIWS IN ORDER TO UTILIZE REFINED DATA AND MORE CURRENT INFORMATION IN DOH PROMULGATED RATES. SIMILAR TYPE OUTPATIENT REFORMS WERE IMPLEMENTED EFFECTIVE DECEMBER 1, 2009. ON FEBRUARY 19, 2004, THE SECRETARY OF HEALTH AND HUMAN SERVICES CONFIRMED THAT HOSPITALS CAN PROVIDE DISCOUNTS FOR UNINSURED PATIENTS, WHICH ALLOWED THE HOSPITALS TO IMPLEMENT A DISCOUNT POLICY IN ACCORDANCE WITH STATE LAW. THE HOSPITALS' GOAL WAS TO CREATE A FINANCIAL AID PROGRAM THAT IS CONSISTENT WITH THE MISSION, VALUES AND CAPACITY OF THE HOSPITALS, WHILE CONSIDERING AN INDIVIDUAL'S ABILITY TO CONTRIBUTE TO HIS OR HER CARE. THE HOSPITALS HAVE A DISCOUNT POLICY AND PROVIDES DISCOUNTS TO UNINSURED PATIENTS. UNDER THIS POLICY, THE DISCOUNT OFFERED TO UNINSURED PATIENTS IS REFLECTED AS A REDUCTION TO THE NET PATIENT SERVICE REVENUE AT THE TIME THE UNINSURED BILLINGS ARE RECORDED. NET PATIENT SERVICE REVENUE IS REPORTED AT THE ESTIMATED NET REALIZABLE AMOUNTS FROM PATIENTS, THIRD-PARTY PAYORS AND OTHER SERVICES RENDERED AND INCLUDES ESTIMATED RETROACTIVE REVENUE ADJUSTMENTS DUE TO FUTURE AUDITS, REVIEWS AND INVESTIGATIONS. FEDERAL AND STATE REGULATIONS PROVIDE FOR CERTAIN RETROSPECTIVE ADJUSTMENTS TO CURRENT AND PRIOR YEARS' PAYMENT RATES BASED ON INDUSTRY-WIDE AND HOSPITAL-SPECIFIC DATA. THE HOSPITALS HAVE ESTIMATED THE POTENTIAL IMPACT OF SUCH RETROSPECTIVE ADJUSTMENTS BASED ON INFORMATION PRESENTLY AVAILABLE AND ADJUSTMENTS ARE RENDERED AND ARE ADJUSTED IN FUTURE PERIODS AS ADDITIONAL INFORMATION BECOMES AVAILABLE OR FINAL SETTLEMENTS ARE DETERMINED. AS A RESULT OF SUCH PRIOR YEAR ADJUSTMENTS THE 2014 AND 2013 NET PATIENT SERVICE REVENUE INCREASED BY APPROXIMATELY $9,900,000 AND $3,800,000, RESPECTIVELY. AS DISCUSSED ABOVE, THE CURRENT MEDICAID AND MEDICARE PROGRAMS ARE BASED UPON COMPLEX LAWS AND REGULATIONS. NONCOMPLIANCE WITH SUCH LAWS AND REGULATIONS COULD RESULT IN FINES, PENALTIES, AND EXCLUSION FROM SUCH PROGRAMS. THE HOSPITAL IS NOT AWARE OF ANY ALLEGATIONS OF NONCOMPLIANCE THAT COULD HAVE A MATERIAL ADVERSE EFFECT ON THE FINANCIAL STATEMENTS AND BELIEVES THAT IT IS IN COMPLIANCE WITH ALL APPLICABLE LAWS AND REGULATIONS. FOR THE YEARS ENDED DECEMBER 31, 2014 AND 2013, NET INPATIENT REVENUE FOR INDIVIDUAL PAYORS CONSISTED OF THE FOLLOWING: MEDICARE 2014-40% 2013-39%, MEDICAID 2014-22%, 2013-23%, SELF PAY 2014-4%, 2013-4%, COMMERCIAL, MANAGED CARE AND OTHER 2014-34%, 2013-34%."

The organization is recognized as a tax-exempt entity and charitable organization under IRC section 501(c)(3). Although there is no definition in the tax code for the term ""charitable"", a regulation promulgated by the department of the treasury provides some guidance and states that ""the term charitable is used in IRC section 501(c)(3) in its generally accepted legal sense,"" and provides examples of charitable purposes, including the relief of the indigent or unprivileged; the promotion of social welfare; and the advancement of education, religion, and science.

RESEARCH HAS CONTINUALLY SHOWN THAT WHEN THE FACTORS INFLUENCING HEALTH ARE EXPLORED, HEALTH CARE ACTUALLY PLAYS THE SMALLEST ROLE PROPORTIONATELY. A REPORT IN THE JOURNAL OF AMERICAN MEDICAL ASSOCIATION AND THE CENTER FOR DISEASE CONTROL (MCGINNIS, 1996) SUGGESTS THAT THE FACTORS IMPACTING HEALTH ARE AS FOLLOWS: LIFESTYLE AND BEHAVIORS, 50%, ENVIRONMENT (HUMAN AND NATURAL), 20%, GENETICS AND HUMAN BIOLOGY, 20%, AND HEALTH CARE, 10%. COMMUNITY BUILDING ACTIVITIES HELP TO ADDRESS THE OTHER INDICATORS OUTSIDE OF THE ROLE TRADITIONALLY PLAYED BY HEALTH-CARE ORGANIZATIONS. THESE ACTIVITIES ARE ALMOST EXCLUSIVELY DONE IN SOME FORM OF PARTNERSHIP IN WHICH THE COMMUNITY OR OTHER ORGANIZATIONS ARE BETTER SUITED TO ADDRESS. HEALTH-CARE ORGANIZATIONS GENERALLY PROVIDE TIMELY AND SPECIFIC RESOURCES TO HELP THESE ISSUES. HEALTH-CARE ORGANIZATIONS CAN BE A RICH AND VALUABLE COMMUNITY RESOURCE IN WAYS NOT TYPICALLY CONSIDERED. OFTEN THE MOST EFFECTIVE WAY TO HELP IMPACT AND IMPROVE THE COMMUNITY HEALTH STATUS IS TO SUPPORT OTHER AGENCIES AND ORGANIZATIONS IN A VARIETY OF WAYS OUTSIDE OF HEALTH SERVICES.

THE HOSPITAL CONTRIBUTES FINANCIALLY TO A WIDE VARIETY OF COMMUNITY ORGANIZATIONS THAT ADDRESS THE BROADER NEEDS OF THE COMMUNITY. THESE DONATIONS ALLOW OTHER NON-PROFIT ORGANIZATIONS TO FULFILL THEIR MISSIONS TO IMPROVE THE WELL BEING OF THE COMMUNITY AND CONTRIBUTE TO ITS OVERALL HEALTH STATUS IN WAYS THAT MAY DIFFER FROM THE DIRECT SERVICES OF THE HOSPITAL ORGANIZATION AND MAXIMIZE THE RESOURCES THEY HAVE TO WORK WITH.

If the patient qualifies for financial assistance, the expected reimbursement is based on charity care policy guidelines. If the patient has no insurance and doesn't qualify for financial assistance, the expected reimbursement is 75% of billed charges. The organization maintains a bad debt reserve on the Balance Sheet. Any bad debt write-offs of patient accounts will go against the bad debt reserve. At each month end based on the accounts receivable by financial class and aging bucket, the reserve amount is re-evaluated. The amount needed to maintain the appropriate reserve level is the bad debt expense. Any payments received on patient accounts previously written off to bad debt will offset the bad debt expense."

Our mission is to provide health care to everyone who comes to our door, regardless of their ability to pay. We will submit a claim to all 3rd party payors on behalf of the patient. We help patients apply for all possible insurance or assistance such as crime victims, an automobile accident, workers' compensation, Medicaid, COBRA, local assistance and/or hospital financial assistance. If they do not qualify for any of these, we can extend payment options such as monthly payments, credit card payments or financial assistance. This is offered to patients who are experiencing legitimate financial hardships and are unable to pay for all or part of the patient's medical care. Forgiveness may apply to an amount after applying all payments such as any insurance company, health plan or personal payments, any negotiated discounts or any uninsured discounts. If a patient eligible for charity care or partial financial assistance still has a portion of the outstanding balance due, other arrangements are made. RMH accepts a variety of payments and alternative payment plans. Monthly statements are sent as payment reminders for contracted arrangements. In case of default, additional letters and calls are made to bring it to a current status. An account is turned over to a collection agency only after non-payment or no contact in 120 days although RMH will suspend collection efforts once a completed application has been received and is pending approval or denial."

Formed in 1995 as a not-for-profit community membership collaborative, Rockford Health Council is comprised of various community leaders and is committed to promoting health and improving access for the residents of northern Illinois. The 2014 Healthy Community Study included a comprehensive community analysis that reviewed demographic, socioeconomic, general health behavior, and disease incidence and mortality information for the residents of Winnebago and Boone Counties and provided comparisons to state and national data. A household survey which focused on demographic, general health conditions, behavioral health, maternal, prenatal, and early childhood health, and chronic disease and obesity was also distributed to residents throughout the community. In addition, a key informant questionnaire was conducted with various individuals throughout the community to identify health and human service needs. The completed study is available on the Rockford Health System and Rockford Health Council respective websites. In addition to the 2014 Healthy Community Study, Rockford Health System completed a community needs assessment in order to plan for and anticipate future clinical program needs and related physician requirements specific to our local and regional community. This study analyzed physicians by specialty within the community including review of suggested physician manpower requirements as determined by population forecasts, physician age, and physician accessibility of the local area and forms the basis for physician recruitment and succession planning. Out-migration analysis was also completed. Understanding why residents of the local community leave the area for various inpatient services is used to plan for future clinical programs and services that may not be readily available in our local community. The study looks at pediatric versus adult patients, actual patient diagnosis and hospital services received. All of these tools were used to develop the Rockford Health System Community Benefit Implementation Plan which was approved by the Board of Directors in 2014. An oversight committee meets routinely to ensure plan implementation of the various strategies and tactics with a progress report provided to the Board on an annual basis."

201543169349305074,362167847,"Schedule H, Part VI, Line 4 Community information","Rockford Memorial Hospital is located in Rockford, IL (Winnebago County) with a defined primary service area that includes Winnebago, Boone, and Ogle Counties. 2013 US Census Bureau estimates project the population for the entire area at slightly more than 400,500 individuals with a little more than 73% living in Winnebago County (approximately 293,000). Located in northern Illinois, the primary service area is characterized as largely rural and populated with very small communities with the exception of the neighboring cities of Rockford, Loves Park, and Machesney Park which comprise more than 197,000 individuals. The next largest community is Belvidere, located in Boone County where the entire county has a population of approximately 54,000 people. In calendar year 2014, approximately 84% of hospital inpatients were from the Primary Service Area. As a community that relies heavily on manufacturing companies and small businesses, the area was particularly hard hit in recent years. Currently, the largest employers include Chrysler (Boone County), the Rockford Public Schools, and the three Rockford health care providers. The most recent median household income figures (U.S. Census Bureau) in Winnebago County were $47,000 compared to the state's median household income of $54,000. These disparities are also reflected in unemployment, education and poverty rates. Unemployment rates have improved with most recent figures for Rockford at 7.2%. Only 21% of Winnebago County residents attain a bachelor's degree or higher while in the state 31% do. More than 17% of the residents in Winnebago County live below the poverty line and children in the community have been particularly hit with more than 27% considered at or below poverty levels. The hospital also serves the secondary service area which includes DeKalb, McHenry, Whiteside, Lee, LaSalle, Stephenson and Rock counties for select tertiary services."
201543169349305074,362167847,"Schedule H, Part VI, Line 5 Promotion of community health","Led by a community board of directors, Rockford Memorial Hospital (RMH) and its affiliates are very involved in promoting a healthier community. As one of Rockford's largest employers, the organization takes a leading role in financially supporting not only health-related initiatives, but also community-building activities across the region. This includes providing financial support and talent for economic development and business related activities, as well as quality of life and educational initiatives. Employees participate on community boards and are actively involved in promoting the region and its assets. Based on the results of the Rockford Health Council 2013 Healthy Community Study, the 2014 - 2017 Community Benefit Implementation Plan identified several key areas to focus efforts. For example, as the predominate provider of pediatric services, Rockford Memorial maintains its commitment to the children of our community. This is evident in our support of the Ronald McDonald Care Mobile which provides free dental and medical care to uninsured and underinsured children in five northern Illinois counties. The 40-foot, 26,000 pound mobile unit houses two patient exam rooms, a central waiting room, and a sterilization area and has provided care to more than 6,500 children since the inception of the program in 2003. This totals more than $1.85 million in free care over the life of the program. The Care Mobile is completely funded by philanthropy from the Rockford Memorial Development foundation, Rockford Memorial Hospital Auxiliary, and the Ronald McDonald House Charities of Madison. The Bridge Clinic is yet another venue for un- and under-insured adults to receive free medical treatment for chronic medical issues. Since its opening in 2008, hundreds of people from our community have received care. Many physicians and other health care providers give freely of their time to provide these services to less fortunate individuals in our community to better manage their chronic conditions. Since 2012, Rockford Memorial continues to partner with A Silver Lining Foundation to provide free breast health services to un- and under-insured women in the community. Approximately 500 women have received free screening mammograms and other breast related services and procedures since the program's inception. These are only some of the many contributions that Rockford Memorial makes to promote and improve the health of the community. Rockford Memorial remains committed to educating the public about various health care issues and initiatives and improving the lives of our citizens. RMH does not restrict admission of providers and provides an open medical staff."

FOR 2014, FOR ANSHN, THE ALLOWANCE FOR DOUBTFUL ACCOUNTS COVERED 28.9% OF NET PATIENT ACCOUNTS RECEIVABLE. PATIENT ACCOUNTS RECEIVABLE ARE STATED AT NET REALIZABLE VALUE. ANSHN EVALUATES THE COLLECTABILITY OF ITS ACCOUNTS RECEIVABLE BASED ON THE LENGTH OF TIME THE RECEIVABLE IS OUTSTANDING, PAYER CLASS, HISTORICAL COLLECTION EXPERIENCE, AND TRENDS IN HEALTH CARE INSURANCE PROGRAMS. ACCOUNTS RECEIVABLE ARE CHARGED TO THE ALLOWANCE FOR UNCOLLECTIBLE ACCOUNTS WHEN THEY ARE DEEMED UNCOLLECTIBLE. THE COSTING METHODOLOGY USED IN DETERMINING THE AMOUNTS REPORTED ON LINES 2 AND 3 IS BASED ON THE RATIO OF PATIENT CARE COST TO CHARGES. THE UNREIMBURSED COST OF BAD DEBT WAS CALCULATED BY APPLYING THE ORGANIZATION'S COST TO CHARGE RATIO FROM THE MEDICARE COST REPORTS (CMS 2252-96 WORKSHEET C, PART 1, PPS INPATIENT RATIOS) TO THE ORGANIZATION'S BAD DEBT PROVISION PER GENERALLY ACCEPTED ACCOUNTING PRINCIPLES, LESS ANY PATIENT OR THIRD PARTY PAYOR PAYMENTS RECEIVED. ADVOCATE MAKES EVERY EFFORT TO IDENTIFY THOSE PATIENTS WHO ARE ELIGIBLE FOR FINANCIAL ASSISTANCE BY STRICTLY ADHERING TO ITS FINANCIAL ASSISTANCE POLICY. WE BELIEVE THAT ADVOCATE HAS A POPULATION OF PATIENTS WHO ARE UNINSURED OR UNDERINSURED BUT WHO DO NOT COMPLETE THE FINANCIAL ASSISTANCE APPLICATION OR ARE NOT IDENTIFIED THROUGH OTHER MEANS AS PERMITTED IN THE POLICY. THE ESTIMATED AMOUNT OF BAD DEBT EXPENSE (AT COST) WHICH COULD BE REASONABLY ATTRIBUTABLE TO PATIENTS WHO WOULD LIKELY QUALIFY FOR FINANCIAL ASSISTANCE UNDER THE ORGANIZATION'S FINANCIAL ASSISTANCE POLICY, IF SUFFICIENT INFORMATION HAD BEEN AVAILABLE TO MAKE A DETERMINATION OF THEIR ELIGIBILITY, WAS BASED UPON SELF PAY PATIENT ACCOUNTS WHICH HAD AMOUNTS WRITTEN OFF TO BAD DEBTS. OUR METHOD WAS TO BEGIN WITH THE SELF-PAY PORTION OF BAD DEBT EXPENSE PROVISION. THE SELF PAY PORTION EXCLUDES THOSE PATIENTS WHO HAD CHARITY APPLICATIONS PENDING AT THE TIME OF SERVICE. THIS COST WAS THEN REDUCED BY CHARGES IDENTIFIED AS TRUE BAD DEBT EXPENSE, INCLUDING COPAYS FOR PATIENTS WHO QUALIFIED FOR LESS THAN 100% FINANCIAL ASSISTANCE. THE COST TO CHARGE RATIO WAS THEN APPLIED TO THE REMAINING CHARGES, TO DETERMINE THE VALUE (AT COST) OF PATIENT ACCOUNTS THAT DID NOT COMPLETE FINANCIAL COUNSELING AND WERE ASSIGNED TO BAD DEBT. WE BELIEVE THIS PROCESS IS A REASONABLE BASIS FOR OUR ESTIMATE. AS WE ARE ONLY CONSIDERING SELF-PAY ACCOUNTS WRITTEN OFF TO BAD DEBT FOR THIS ESTIMATE, THIS ESTIMATE DOES NOT INCLUDE THE IMMEDIATE 25% DISCOUNT TO CHARGES WHICH IS APPLIED TO ALL SELF-PAY PATIENTS. IT ALSO DOES NOT INCLUDE ACCOUNT BALANCES OR CO-PAYS OF NON-SELF PAY ACCOUNTS WHICH ARE WRITTEN OFF TO BAD DEBT WHEN THE PATIENT HAS NO OTHER FINANCIAL RESOURCES TO PAY THESE AMOUNTS AND THE PATIENT DOES NOT APPLY FOR FINANCIAL ASSISTANCE. BAD DEBT AMOUNTS HAVE BEEN EXCLUDED FROM OTHER COMMUNITY BENEFIT AMOUNTS REPORTED THROUGHOUT SCHEDULE H. PART III, LINE 8 IN 2014, NO SHORTFALL WAS REPORTED ON PART III, LINE 7. FOR ANSHN'S HOSPITAL OPERATIONS, THE UNREIMBURSED COST OF MEDICARE WAS CALCULATED BY APPLYING THE ORGANIZATION'S COST TO CHARGE RATIO FROM THE MEDICARE COST REPORTS (CMS 2252-96 WORKSHEET C, PART 1, PPS INPATIENT RATIOS) AND FOR NON-HOSPITAL OPERATIONS THE COST TO CHARGE RATIO CALCULATED ON WORKSHEET 2 RATIO OF PATIENT CARE COST TO CHARGES TO THE ORGANIZATION'S MEDICARE, LESS ANY PATIENT OR THIRD PARTY PAYOR PAYMENTS AND/OR CONTRIBUTIONS RECEIVED THAT WERE DESIGNATED FOR THE PAYMENT OF MEDICARE PATIENT BILLS."

201543179349301204,363196629,6. AFFILIATED HEALTH CARE SYSTEM,"AS AN EXTENSION OF ITS MISSION, ADVOCATE HEALTH CARE SUPPORTS SYSTEM-WIDE PROGRAMS THAT MEET THE NEEDS OF BOTH ITS PATIENTS AS WELL AS THE COMMUNITIES SERVED. ADVOCATE HEALTH CARE'S BOARD OF DIRECTORS, SENIOR LEADERSHIP AND ASSOCIATES (EMPLOYEES) ARE COMMITTED TO POSITIVELY AFFECTING THE HEALTH STATUS AND QUALITY OF LIFE OF INDIVIDUALS AND POPULATIONS IN COMMUNITIES SERVED BY ADVOCATE THROUGH PROGRAMS AND PRACTICES THAT REFLECT ADVOCATE'S WHOLISTIC PHILOSOPHY. TO THAT END, THEY CONTINUE TO UNDERTAKE AND SUPPORT INITIATIVES THAT ENHANCE ACCESS TO HEALTH AND WELLNESS SERVICES WITHIN THE DIVERSE COMMUNITIES THAT ADVOCATE SERVES. SYSTEM LEADERSHIP IS BOTH DESIGNED TO DIRECT AND SUPPORT THE HOSPITALS IN THEIR EFFORTS TO ADDRESS IDENTIFIED COMMUNITY NEEDS. IN 2010, A MULTI-DISCIPLINARY TEAM OF INDIVIDUALS AT THE SYSTEM LEVEL HAVING OVERSIGHT RESPONSIBILITY FOR COMMUNITY BENEFITS REPORTING AND THE CHNA PROCESS WAS CONVENED TO LEAD THE HOSPITALS THROUGH THE CHNA PROCESS TO MEET STATE AND FEDERAL REGULATORY REQUIREMENTS. THIS TEAM, CALLED THE COMMUNITY HEALTH STEERING COMMITTEE, MET FREQUENTLY TO ASSURE THAT: THE HOSPITAL COMMUNITY HEALTH LEADERS ARE EDUCATED REGARDING HOW TO CONDUCT A CHNA; SITE COMMUNITY HEALTH COUNCILS ARE DEVELOPED AND MAINTAINED; THOSE CONDUCTING THE CHNA PROCESS PULL DATA FROM RELIABLE SOURCES; SOUND ASSUMPTIONS ARE MADE BASED ON THAT DATA; INTERNAL ADVOCATE AND COMMUNITY RESOURCES ARE MAPPED TO DETERMINE STRENGTHS AND WEAKNESSES; ACHIEVABLE NEEDS ARE SELECTED AS PRIORITIES; AND PLANNED INITIATIVES ARE GROUNDED IN EVIDENCE-BASED PROGRAMS THAT WILL YIELD RELIABLE OUTCOMES TO DETERMINE IMPACT. TO FOCUS THESE EFFORTS THROUGHOUT ADVOCATE HEALTH CARE, THE COMMUNITY BENEFITS PLAN WAS WRITTEN. THE PLAN'S BROAD GOALS AND OBJECTIVES WERE DESIGNED TO STRUCTURE SYSTEM-WIDE COMMUNITY BENEFITS ACTIVITIES WITHIN A STRATEGIC FRAMEWORK. INCLUDED IN THE COMMUNITY BENEFITS PLAN ARE NOT ONLY PLANNED GOALS AND OBJECTIVES FOCUSED ON ADDRESSING NEEDS AS IDENTIFIED THROUGH THE HOSPITAL COMMUNITY HEALTH NEEDS ASSESSMENT PROCESS, BUT ALSO OTHER SYSTEM-WIDE EFFORTS TO ADDRESS THE BROADER ISSUES OF DISPARITY AND ACCESS SUCH AS PROVIDING CHARITY CARE TO THE UNDER AND UNINSURED. ADVOCATE'S COMMUNITY BENEFITS PLAN WAS DEVELOPED TO ESTABLISH STRATEGIES FOR IMPROVING ACCESS TO CARE AND POSITIVELY AFFECTING THE HEALTH OF THE COMMUNITIES THAT ADVOCATE SERVES. THE PLAN SETS THE COURSE FOR STRENGTHENING EXISTING PARTNERSHIPS AND BUILDING NEW ONES WITH INDIVIDUALS AND ORGANIZATIONS WITHIN ADVOCATE'S SERVICE AREAS IN ORDER TO LEVERAGE AND MAXIMIZE THE IMPACT OF ITS PROGRAMS. ADVOCATE'S COMMUNITY BENEFITS PLAN GOALS ARE AS FOLLOWS: GOAL 1: OPTIMIZE ADVOCATE'S ABILITY TO LEVERAGE ITS COMMUNITY HEALTH RESOURCES AND CONTINUE PROGRAMS THAT BENEFIT THE COMMUNITY BY PROSPECTIVELY ALIGNING SYSTEM AND SITE PLANS AND ACTIVITIES. IN ORDER TO ASSURE ALIGNMENT BETWEEN SITE AND SYSTEM GOALS, QUALITY AND CONSISTENCY AMONGST THE HOSPITALS' CHNAS AND TO LEVERAGE THE HOSPITALS' STAFF TIME AND CHNA EFFORTS, THE SYSTEM LEVEL COMMUNITY HEALTH STEERING COMMITTEE PROVIDED A STANDARDIZED CHNA PROCESS, TOOLS, EDUCATION AND STRUCTURE. SPECIFIC EXAMPLES OF THE SUPPORT PROVIDED BY THE STEERING COMMITTEE TO ENABLE THE HOSPITALS TO REALIZE THEIR COMMUNITY HEALTH GOALS AND OBJECTIVES ARE AS FOLLOWS: * A STANDARDIZED CHNA PROCESS THAT INCLUDED DEVELOPMENT OF A COMMUNITY HEALTH COUNCIL AT EACH HOSPITAL WITH BOTH HOSPITAL AND COMMUNITY REPRESENTATION. THE COUNCILS WERE CHARGED WITH MANAGING THEIR SITE'S ASSESSMENT, EXAMINING DATA, SITE AND COMMUNITY RESOURCES, SELECTING KEY PRIORITIES TO ADDRESS AND DEVELOPING A COMMUNITY HEALTH PLAN. * PURCHASE OF AND INSTRUCTION ON HOW TO USE SURVEY RESULTS AND THE ASSESSMENT TOOL DEVELOPED BY PROFESSIONAL RESEARCH CONSULTANTS. * LED A SERIES OF WORKSHOPS OVER THREE YEARS WITH INTERNAL AND EXTERNAL SPEAKERS PROFICIENT IN CHNAS, IDENTIFYING RELIABLE DATA SOURCES, PRIORITY SETTING, AND SELECTING EVIDENCE-BASED INTERVENTIONS. * SET THE COMMUNITY HEALTH LEADERSHIP COUNCIL'S AGENDAS, A COUNCIL COMPRISED OF COMMUNITY HEALTH STAKEHOLDERS FROM ACROSS ADVOCATE, TO FOCUS ON CHNA OBJECTIVES. * MANAGED HOSPITAL PROGRESS AGAINST SYSTEM ANNUAL TIMELINES TO ACHIEVE THE THREE-YEAR VISION, REQUIRING ANNUAL CHNA PROGRESS REPORTS AND THEIR REVIEW AND ENDORSEMENT BY THE HOSPITAL GOVERNING COUNCILS EACH YEAR. * PROVIDED ONGOING CONSULTATION ON AN AS NEED BASIS THROUGHOUT THE PROCESS. * ENGAGED AND FUNDED AN OUTSIDE CHNA CONSULTANT TO MEET ONE-ON-ONE WITH THE SITE COMMUNITY HEALTH LEADERS AND REVIEW CHNA PROGRESS AND PROVIDE GUIDANCE IN AREAS OF DIFFICULTY OR UNCERTAINTY. * PROVIDED AN OVERVIEW OF THE CHNA RESULTS AND PLANNED INTERVENTIONS TO THE MISSION & SPIRITUAL COMMITTEE OF THE ADVOCATE HEALTH CARE BOARD OF DIRECTORS TO SECURE THE COMMITTEE'S ENDORSEMENT. * A STANDARDIZED FORMAT FOR HOSPITALS TO USE IN DRAFTING THEIR CHNAS AND IMPLEMENTATION PLANS, WHICH SYSTEM LEADERS THEN REVIEWED AND EDITED FOR CONSISTENCY, ACCURACY AND QUALITY OF CONTENT. * WORKED WITH SYSTEM LEVEL MEDIA CENTER AND WEB TEAM TO DEVELOP PLACEMENT AND POSTING OF CHNA REPORTS & IMPLEMENTATION PLANS TO MEET PPACA/IRS REGULATORY REPORTING REQUIREMENTS. * IN PREPARATION FOR THE NEXT CHNA CYCLE, ADVOCATE PURCHASED THE HEALTHY COMMUNITIES INSTITUTE'S CHNA TOOL IN LATE 2013 AND PAID THE ANNUAL FEE FOR ONGOING SUPPORT FOR TRAINING AND THE ADDITION OF 2013 AND 2014 UPDATES AT THE SYSTEM LEVEL. FOR 2015, THE TOOL IS EXPECTED TO ALSO SUPPORT THE WORK OF THE COUNTY CHNA COLLABORATIVES. WITH SUPPORT FROM THE SYSTEM LEVEL, ALL ADVOCATE'S HOSPITALS ARE PARTICIPATING IN THESE COLLABORATIVE ASSESSMENTS WITH OTHER ADVOCATE AND NON-ADVOCATE HOSPITALS AND THEIR COUNTY AND LOCAL PUBLIC HEALTH DEPARTMENTS. THESE COLLABORATIVES REMOVE DUPLICATION OF STAFF TIME AND EFFORT WHILE FORGING AND STRENGTHENING RELATIONSHIPS AMONG PARTICIPATING ORGANIZATIONS, LEVERAGING THEIR ABILITY TO POSITIVELY IMPACT KEY NEEDS AS IDENTIFIED THROUGH THE ASSESSMENT PROCESS. THROUGH ADVOCATE'S HOSPITAL-BASED SERVICES, AS WELL AS ITS PARTICIPATION IN PROVIDING PROGRAMS AND SERVICES IN THE COMMUNITY, ADVOCATE PROMOTES A SHARED APPROACH TO COMMUNITY BENEFITS. IN ADDITION TO HOSPITAL/COMMUNITY SPECIFIC PROGRAMS, THERE ARE ALSO PROGRAMS ADDRESSING NEEDS OF BROAD GEOGRAPHIC PORTIONS OF ADVOCATE'S SERVICE AREA WHICH ARE MANAGED AND FUNDED AT THE SYSTEM LEVEL. THESE PROGRAMS INCLUDE THE FOLLOWING: ADVOCATE'S HEALTHY STEPS PROGRAM SPECIALISTS TOUCHED THE LIVES OF 6,248 YOUNG CHILDREN IN 2014 THROUGH CHILDHOOD PROGRAMS WITHIN PEDIATRIC/FAMILY PRACTICE RESIDENCIES AT ADVOCATE ILLINOIS MASONIC MEDICAL CENTER, AND THE ADVOCATE CHILDREN'S HOSPITAL OAK LAWN AND PARK RIDGE CAMPUSES. THIS SYSTEM-WIDE PROGRAM USES A NATIONAL MODEL TO ENGAGE PARENTS AS PARTNERS WITH PHYSICIANS IN THEIR CHILDREN'S HEALTH. HEALTHY STEPS SPECIALISTS HELP BRIDGE THE TWO GROUPS BY PREPARING PARENTS TO TAKE AN ACTIVE ROLE IN, AND PHYSICIANS TO ASSESS AND MEET MORE EFFECTIVELY, A RANGE OF CHILD DEVELOPMENT NEEDS. IN 2014, 9,981 DEVELOPMENTAL SCREENINGS WERE PROVIDED AND 411 FAMILIES WERE REFERRED TO COMMUNITY SERVICES FOR FOLLOW UP. IN ADDITION, HEALTHY STEPS HAS TRAINED AND PROVIDED TECHNICAL ASSISTANCE TO PRIMARY CARE PROVIDERS ACROSS THE STATE TO IMPROVE PREVENTIVE PRACTICES IN THEIR SITE AROUND TOPICS SUCH AS USE OF VALIDATED TOOLS FOR DEVELOPMENTAL AND SOCIAL EMOTIONAL CONCERNS, AS WELL AS FAMILY RISK FACTOR SCREENINGS (SUCH AS POSTPARTUM DEPRESSION, DOMESTIC VIOLENCE, TRAUMA, AND PSYCHOSOCIAL ISSUES). PRIMARY CARE PROVIDERS AND THEIR STAFF ARE TAUGHT HOW TO WORK CLOSELY WITH LOCAL COMMUNITY RESOURCES FOR REFERRAL AND FOLLOW-UP CARE. DURING 2014, ADVOCATE HEALTHY STEPS CONSULTANTS PROVIDED 91 PRESENTATIONS IN 42 PRIMARY CARE SITES TO 585 PHYSICIANS AND THEIR STAFFS THROUGHOUT THE STATE OF ILLINOIS. THESE PROVIDERS CARE FOR APPROXIMATELY 78,715 CHILDREN BETWEEN BIRTH AND AGE THREE. CURRENTLY, HEALTHY STEPS IS FOCUSING ON DEVELOPMENTAL BEHAVIORAL MENTAL HEALTH TRAINING FOR PRIMARY CARE PROVIDERS. THE STAFF ALSO MEETS REGULARLY WITH APPROXIMATELY 20 COMMUNITY ORGANIZATIONS, AND WORKS WITH PEDIATRIC AND FAMILY MEDICINE RESIDENCY PROGRAMS, PEDIATRIC NURSE PRACTITIONERS AND PHYSICIAN ASSISTANT PROGRAMS THROUGHOUT THE STATE. THE ADVOCATE CHILDHOOD TRAUMA TREATMENT PROGRAM (CTTP) OFFERS HOPE AND HEALING TO CHILDREN WHO HAVE EXPERIENCED MALTREATMENT, PSYCHOLOGICAL TRAUMA AND SEXUAL ABUSE. CLINICIANS WORK WITH A CHILD'S ENTIRE SUPPORT NETWORK - PARENTS, THE SCHOOL AND MORE - TO HELP FOSTER A SAFE ENVIRONMENT FOR THE CHILD. CTTP IS ONE OF JUST A HANDFUL OF PROGRAMS IN ILLINOIS THAT SPECIALIZES IN THE SEXUAL ABUSE OF CHILDREN. IN 2014, CTTP SERVED 168 CHILDREN AND ADOLESCENTS, AS WELL AS 415 ADULTS, CAREGIVERS, PARENTS AND OTHERS. IN ADDITION, THE PROGRAM HAS PARTNERED WITH ""DARKNESS TO LIGHT,"" A NATIONALLY RECOGNIZED CHILD SEXUAL ABUSE PREVENTION LEADER. AS A RESULT OF THIS PARTNERSHIP, CTTP HAS LAUNCHED A MAJOR ADULT EDUCATION PROGRAM CALLED ""STEWARDS OF CHILDREN/7 STEPS TO PROTECT A CHILD."" T"

CENTRA ENCOURAGES ITS EXECUTIVE TEAM AND EMPLOYEES TO BE AN INTEGRAL PART OF COMMUNITY ORGANIZATIONS, NOT ONLY TO OFFER ADVICE AND SERVICE, BUT ALSO TO BETTER UNDERSTAND AND RECOGNIZE THE NEEDS OF THE REGIONAL COMMUNITY. IN 2013, CENTRA COMPLETED THE 2013 - 2016 COMMUNITY HEALTH NEEDS ASSESSMENT AND IMPLEMENTATION PLAN TO MEASURE THE HEALTH NEEDS OF CENTRAL VIRGINIA RESIDENTS SERVED AT CENTRA LYNCHBURG GENERAL HOSPITAL, CENTRA VIRGINIA BAPTIST HOSPITAL AND CENTRA SOUTHSIDE COMMUNITY HOSPITAL. THE CENTRA FOUNDATION PROVIDED FUNDING FOR THE DETAILED REPORT, WHICH IDENTIFIES THE HEALTH NEEDS AND PRIORITIES FOR THE COMMUNITIES SERVED BY CENTRA.

THE REGION HAS A POPULATION OF 92,106. THE CUMULATIVE REPORT OFFERS A STATISTICALLY RELIABLE SNAPSHOT OF THE COMMUNITY'S HEALTH AND PROVIDES A WEALTH OF INFORMATION TO GUIDE THE CENTRA FOUNDATION IN ITS GRANT FUNDING EFFORTS. EXPERTS SAY CLINICAL CARE INFLUENCES ONLY ABOUT 20% OF THE HEALTH OF A COMMUNITY. OTHER INFLUENCES INCLUDE SOCIAL AND ENVIRONMENTAL FACTORS SUCH AS EDUCATION, EMPLOYMENT AND INCOME LEVELS (40%); HEALTH STATUS AND BEHAVIORS SUCH AS DIET, SMOKING AND EXERCISE (30%); AND PHYSICAL ENVIRONMENT FACTORS SUCH AS AIR/WATER QUALITY, HOUSING AND ACCESS TO TRANSPORTATION (10%).

201543179349303459,570828733,"Part VI, Line 2:","Roper St. Francis Healthcare identified community health needs by undergoing an assessment process in 2013 that complies with IRS Section 501(r). The Needs Assessment is posted on our website: http://www.rsfh.com/About_Us/Mission_and_Community_Activities/Needs_Assessment.aspx and we invite the community to review and respond to this document so that our collaborative efforts can make living in our community more enjoyable and healthier.As allowed by IRS guidelines, Roper St. Francis Healthcare decided to produce a joint CHNA report in collaboration with its three Charleston area hospitals as those facilities define their communities to be the same. Each hospital files a Schedule H and has a customized implementation plan attached.The community needs assessment process consists of 5 steps: data assessment, community input, prioritization and implementation strategy, reporting, and monitoring. In the data assessment step, service areas were defined, external data research was completed and key findings were summarized. Interviews were conducted with persons with special knowledge of public health, hospital personnel, local organizations, and community outreach advocates. Our service area for this assessment is defined as the Tri-County area of Charleston, Berkeley, and Dorchester Counties. We used the following sources in the data assessment process: Nielson Claritas, 2012 County Health Rankings, Health Indicators Warehouse, The Advisory Board Company, Kids Count Data Center, Truven Health Analytics, and the USDA. Data from these sources was used to identify at-risk populations, underserved populations, health need areas, and professional shortage areas. See the answer to Schedule H, Part VI, question 4 for a description of the community served.Subsequent to the data assessment step, the Community Needs Assessment Team entered into dialogue with key hospital administrators, physicians, those with knowledge/expertise in public health, and those serving underserved and chronic disease populations. During the community input phase, the team conducted face-to-face interviews, phone interviews, and surveys in which respondents were able to comment and discuss general community health issues of their specific service area. Through these numerous interviews and surveys, a summary of community input was created. This summary would eventually be used to help focus in on priorities and ultimately, implementation strategies. Respondents who participated in this phase included experts in the field of public health, hospital administration members, community outreach groups, and other local organizations. Respondents included Dana Millet, Director of DHEC Lowcountry Region, Joseph Chambers, MD; Public Health expert and consultant, Thaddeus Bell, MD; with Closing the Gap in Healthcare. Other respondents were from focus groups in the Charleston Promise Neighborhood (North Charleston), East Cooper Community Outreach (Mt. Pleasant), Neighborhood House (Charleston), and Our Lady of Mercy Outreach Center (Johns Island). Collection and analysis of results from the CHNA data assessment, survey, interviews, and focus groups provided a strong foundation for identifying health needs and service gaps. In June 2013, Roper St. Francis Healthcare held multiple sessions with leading stakeholders to assess initial findings and establish priorities. These various constituents included representatives from the Medical University of South Carolinas strategic planning team, leadership of Trident United Way's Health Council and 2-1-1 program, experts from Joseph P. Riley Jr. Center for Livable Communities at the College of Charleston, and public health consultants. Twelve priority areas of need emerged for the Tri-County service area. As part of the prioritization process, Roper St. Francis Healthcare conducted an inventory of existing system-based outreach programs, community partnerships, and other collaborative resources that currently address each of the priority areas:1)Access to Services for Uninsured and Underinsured: Access Health Tri-county Network; RSF Financial Assistance Policy and Patient Financial Services staff to assist; partnerships with Free Clinics such as Barrier Island Free Medical Clinic, Our Lady of Mercy Outreach and Crisis Ministries; new RSF Mt. Pleasant Hospital and Physician Partners network development.2)Obesity, Nutrition, and Activity: RSF Bariatric & Metabolic Services; Diabetes Treatment Center; Cardiac Rehabilitation Centers and related programs; Lowcountry Senior Center programs; Families for Healthy Heart program; Employee ""Wellness Works"" program with coaching available; partnering with community groups such as City of Charleston's ""Lighten Up Charleston"" and ""Closing the Gap in Healthcare""; farmers markets at hospitals.3)Mental Health: ""Highway to Hope"" program with mobile van/partnership with mental health departments; Behavioral Health Unit; case management/assessment through Emergency Departments.4)Alcohol and Drug Abuse: Community investment support for community programs; addressed through Behavioral Health Unit and Physician Partners practices.5)Breast Center/Mammography: Breast Cancer Center at Roper Hospital; RSF Cancer Center; ""Ladies Night Out"" community outreach programs.6)Maternal and Child Healthcare/Infant Mortality: Prenatal Care programs throughout system; special focus on prenatal care and treatment through RSF Mt. Pleasant and Bon Secours St. Francis hospitals specifically, with outreach to rural communities; support and partnership with Our Lady of Mercy Outreach, Franklin C. Fetter Clinic and others.7)Prevention/Wellness/Outreach: Employee ""Wellness Works"" program with coaching available; Families for Healthy Heart program; Community Screenings and health fairs; partnerships and support for community wellness and prevention programs.8)High Prevalence of Chronic Disease: Heart and Vascular treatments and programs; development of Palliative Care program; Cancer Center outreach and support programs.9)Lack of Transportation: ITN (Independent Transportation Network), volunteers giving rides for medical appointments; support for CARTA public transportation and use of taxis throughout system when needed; development of Physician Partners network for closer proximity of population areas.10)Low Healthcare Literacy and Distrust Among Those with Limited Access: Health Literacy training through Professional Development; Case Management and Nursing focus on discharge planning and instructions; ""Closing the Gap in Healthcare"" public education programs.11)Coordination of Care Across Settings: ""Transitions of Care"" process throughout RSF; new grant through Duke Endowment for this; Case Management model for Access Health Tri-County Network; RSF Home Health, Palliative Care program and new Hospice program.12)Cultural Awareness and Effective Programs: Professional Development programs for cultural competencies; development of Diversity program and educational efforts; support for ""Closing the Gap in Healthcare"" program; Mandatory on-line program for employees.After examining the range of services currently available, the expertise, outreach, and capacity of the RSFH system, and the resources available to best address needs through other community organizations, Roper St. Francis Healthcare senior leadership chose the following 6 issues as priorities to implement for its current CHNA: Access to Services and Coverage for the Uninsured and Underserved, Mental Health, Maternal and Child Health, Prevention/Wellness/Outreach, High Prevalence of Chronic Disease, and Coordination of Care Across Settings.For the needs identified through the CHNA that did not emerge as strategic priority areas of need (Obesity, Nutrition and Activity; Alcohol and Drug Abuse; Breast Cancer/Mammography; Lack of Transportation; Low Healthcare Literacy and Distrust Among Those with Limited Access; Cultural Awareness and Effective Programs), Roper St. Francis Healthcare will continue to provide the support and services as listed in the inventory of community outreach and services to address these issues.The Roper St. Francis Community Needs Assessment Team developed implementation strategies for each health issue identified as a strategic priority. This implementation plan (attached) will be rolled out over the next 3 years. Strategies are be clearly defined with a matrix of which areas each RSFH hospital will address. Some strategies may be addressed by more than one RSFH hospital or the system as a whole. The team will develop a monitoring method to provide status and results of these efforts to improve community health. RSFH is committed to conducting another health needs assessment in three years.The Community Health Needs Assessment for fiscal December 31, 2013 was approved by the Board of Directors at its meeting held on October 12, 2013."

201533209349302173,160743032,"Part III, Line 4:","Reserve for Doubtful Accounts Footnote:The Hospitals, the P. C., Living Centers and the Homestead estimate the amount to be recognized in the consolidated financial statements for doubtful accounts by analyzing specific patient and resident accounts for collectability and also by applying historically established percentages for self-pay and various third-party payers to the aging categories in the accounts receivable aging for each facility.In 2013, the System decreased the reserve for doubtful accounts as a result of the change in its policy for recognizing financial aid for self-pay patients. Specifically, self-pay charges are now marked down at the time of billing resulting in a smalller balance being included in the System's bad debt reserve calculation. There were no significant changes in the calculation of the allowance for doubtful accounts in 2014.Other Explanation:Beginning in 2012 bad debts are recorded as a deduction from revenue rather than as an expense.Part III, Section A, 3Costing Methodology:HFMA P&P Board Statement 15, IX. Valuation and Disclosure of Bad Debts, 9.1 has been applied to the amount reported on line 2. The bad debt amount is recorded at the amount that the payer is expected to pay. The amount reported on line 3 is valued at patient care cost, i. e. the expected payment amount included in line 2 has been multiplied by the ratio of patient care cost to charges (39.93%). Based upon an analysis of income levels for accounts included in bad debts we estimated that 24% were eligible under the financial assistance program.Rationale for including a portion of bad debt amount as community benefit:It is not always possible to obtain sufficient information to make a determination of eligibility for financial assistance or reclassify bad debts as charity care. When income levels are learned we identify individuals unable to pay for services. Having provided services to those individuals we believe represents a community benefit."

We are developing initiatives, and designing our facilities with patient-centered, evidence-based, outcome driven goals in mind. Our team has been working to achieve the best quality care outcomes to keep patients healthy and to develop prevention-oriented programs aimed at creating and sustaining healthy communities. We base programming on areas of health and wellness that matter most in our communities. That is determined by conducting health needs assessments in our communities.Finger Lakes Health collaborates with public health departments in our service area, as well as other human services providers, to use the framework of the NYS Health Commissioner's ""Prevention Agenda"" as a basis for our community health planning. We worked together to conduct a Community Health Needs Assessment (CHNA) in 2009 and establish health priorities for 2010-2013. By drawing upon the state's prevention agenda, studying data collected through primary and secondary research, and partnering with local health departments in Ontario, Seneca and Yates counties, we identified health priorities and subsequent community outreach initiatives to align with those priorities.We again partnered with these agencies and providers to conduct another Community Health Needs Assessment in 2012-2013 and establish health priorities for 2013-2017. After the issues were ranked, we determined the two health prevention priorities that our Community Health Improvement Plans are based upon. Tools used to conduct the CHNA and get them to the largest group possible, included:- An online survey available to anyone in the community.

Asset tests cannot be used to deny financial assistance, but only to ""upgrade"" a patient's level of obligation, up to the legal maximum permitted under the financial assistance law. Part I, Line 6a: The Community Benefit report is prepared by the hospital, in conjunction with an affiliated entity (North Shore-Long Island Jewish Health System) of the hospital. The Community Benefit Report is accessible to the public and can be accessed on the North Shore-LIJ website: http://www.northshorelij.com. Part I, 7: Row (a) The cost of charity care was determined by utilizing the ratio of cost to charges (RCC) calculated on Worksheet 2 applied to gross charges written off for patients qualifying for charity under the hospital's financial assistance policy. Bad Debt was not reported in any row of Part I, Line 7. Row (b) The Ratio of Cost to Charges method (or RCC) is used to determine the cost of ancillary services. A RCC is developed from these costs, and that RCC is applied to total Medicaid gross ancillary services charges to determine the cost of services provided to Medicaid patients. Row (e) Costs associated with Community Health Improvement Services were determined by adding indirect or overhead costs to the direct costs of the activity. Indirect costs were calculated as a percentage of direct costs. Direct costs for staff expenses were calculated using average hospital facility hourly rates, and were adjusted to account for fringe benefits, using a blended rate based on the ratio of total employee benefit expenses to total salary and wages. Row (f) The Bad Debt Expense that appears on Form 990, Part IX, Line 25 column (A), but not included for purposes of calculating the percentage in this column is equal to the amount reported on Form 990, Part X. The costs related to health professions education were determined by utilizing the step down method of cost finding. Row (h) Costs associated with research activities were determined by adding indirect, or overhead, costs to the direct costs of the activity. Indirect costs were calculated as a percentage of costs. Row (i) The cost of in-kind contributions to community groups is comprised of the direct costs of personnel whose compensated time was donated to various charities and community groups. The salaries and wages were adjusted to include benefits using a rate based on the ratio of total employee benefit expenses to total salary and wages. Indirect costs were calculated as a percentage of direct costs. Column (a) The number of activities or programs was determined by counting unique community benefit activities or programs conducted throughout the year. Each activity or program may include multiple occurrences. In Part I line 7a-k, column (a) represents the total number of unique community benefit activities and programs; not the number of occurrences for each activity and program. Column (b) Persons served were determined by the unique number of community members that encountered a specific community benefit activity or program. Persons were reported multiple times when engaged in services in different categories of activity or program. Column (f) for Rows (a)-(k) The percentage of Net Community Benefit Expense divided by Total Expense for the hospital (to calculate the percent of total expense). Note: For the entire North Shore-LIJ Health System, Part I, Line 7 (Row K, Column F) is approximately 12.08 as a percentage of expenses. Part II: All community building activities improve access to health services and address federal, state, or local public health priorities, as well as leverage public health department activities, and in doing so, they provide relief of government burden. These activities broadly serve low-income, underserved patients, and include: collaboration with various community coalitions, system-wide recycling initiative, organizational response to worldly disasters, and bioterrorism efforts. The System's bioterrorism & disaster preparedness includes Center for Emergency Medical Services, which is a state and federal planning resource on weapons of mass destruction, and a designated a Bioterrorism Resource Center. The System has conducted staff training for more than 100 hospitals and area first responders and invested heavily in the infrastructure needed for large-scale emergencies. During catastrophes, (i.e. Super storm Sandy), North Shore-LIJ provides a safe haven for thousands of patients, outside nursing home residents, and community members seeking shelter. North Shore-LIJ ambulances assists with the transport of patients throughout the metropolitan area and stand ready to contribute food, medicine and blankets to numerous individuals who may lose power in their homes, and assist both affiliated and non-affiliated hospital patients. Investment in a field hospital has furthered the public health infrastructure needed for mass casualties that could result from a terrorist attack, natural attack, or large-scale emergency. Part III, Line 2: For patients who were determined by the System to have the ability to pay but did not, the uncollected amounts are recorded as bad debt expense. The amount of gross charges written off is reduced by any charity care or other discounts provided to the patient, as well as any payments received. Bad debt expense reported on this line is reported net of governmental or private offsetting funds. Part III, Line 3: N/A Part III, Line 4: For patients who were determined by the System to have the ability to pay but did not, the uncollected amounts are recorded as bad debt expense. Part III, Line 8: Medicare costs are determined utilizing a combination of the step down method of cost findings and a cost per unit of service. Cost per unit of service is used to calculate the routine cost of services provided to Medicare patients. The Ratio of Cost to Charges method (or RCC) is used to determine the cost of ancillary services. An RCC is developed from these costs, and that RCC is applied to total Medicare gross ancillary services charges to determine the cost of services provided to Medicare patients. Part III, Line 9b: The organization's collection policy is standard to all accounts regardless of insurance status (e.g. insured, underinsured, and uninsured). The hospital's collection policy states that they will not send patient accounts to collection if a decision on a financial assistance application is pending, or if a patient is determined to be eligible for Medicaid at the time services were rendered and for which services Medicaid payment is available. Question 2: NEEDS ASSESSMENT: The Community Health Needs Assessment (CHNA) is performed on an ongoing basis. North Shore-LIJ conducts and participates in population, demographic, and health status evaluations of our respective hospitals' service areas based on county regions and the communities we serve. There is a special effort to include individuals with health disparities and organizations who serve these communities in the CHNA process. The CHNA includes the analysis of primary and secondary data. Multi-year analyses, trends and projections are developed, which identify areas of need for the continuum of health care services. Primary data is obtained through a combination of qualitative analysis of community-based organization (CBO), informant interviews and surveys, individual community member surveys, and participation in collaborative partner meetings. These meetings include representatives from the Departments of Health, CBOs, academic institutions, government agencies, and hospitals. Ongoing input concerning our communities' needs is also obtained through: our Board of Trustees/Directors who are all area residents and leaders in their respective communities; facility based advisory boards and councils, and; the feedback received by our facility administrators and clinicians that serve on local community agency boards. Secondary data analysis includes: internal hospital data, including Prevention Quality Indicators (PQI); Department of Health Community Health Assessments; local regional NYS Prevention Agenda data sources; and Statewide Planning and Research System (SPARCS) data. The Committee on Community Health, a committee of the Board of Trustees, provides recommendations that concern North Shore-LIJ's community health priorities and interventions based on the CHNA. Committee discussions focus on New York State (NYS) Prevention Agenda Priority Areas, including strategies and intervention outcomes related to chronic disease prevention, women and children's health, healthy safe environments, health access, mental health and substance abuse, HIV/AIDS/STDs and community immunizations.

201543169349305539,840166760,"SCHEDULE H, PART II","In 2014, Children's Hospital Colorado provided $574,780 in community building activities that promoted the health of the broader community. We continue to build on our long and strong record of collaboration with community groups, businesses academic institutions, and governmental and non-governmental organizations with the goal of improving health outcomes and reducing health disparities for children and their families. Emphasis is placed on addressing both the social determinants of health and the health care delivery system. Selected community building activities are highlighted below. Community Support and Workforce Development-Community-Campus Partnership The Community-Campus Partnership (CCP) founded in 2013 fosters, promotes and supports mutually beneficial collaborations between Anschutz Medical Campus and the surrounding Aurora community to improve the health and economic well-being of the community. Anschutz Medical Campus includes Children's Hospital of Colorado, University of Colorado Hospital, University Physicians, Inc. and the University of Colorado's health science academic programs and research centers. Nearly 16,000 people are employed on the Anschutz Campus of which fewer than three percent are residents from area neighborhoods. North Aurora residents in neighborhoods immediately surrounding the campus -particularly those living in ZIP codes 80010 and 80011 - are largely low-income and a large percentage of residents in these neighborhoods have not graduated from high school. According to the most recent Census data, almost 30 percent of 80010 residents over age 25 lack a high school diploma or a GED. In 2014, the campus Community partnership developed a formal ""hire local"" program for the medical campus. The goal of ""hire local"" is to increase pipeline opportunities such as the healthcare training course at Community College of Aurora that funnel more local residents into entry-level jobs on the medical campus. Children's Hospital has identified two positions (sterile processing and patient services) that will serve as pipeline jobs for the ""hire local"" initiative. In addition, representatives for Children's serve on the CCP Authority and Implementation Committees. Leadership Development and Training for Community Members The Family Leadership Training Institute (FLTI) is a first-of-its-kind family civics program. The goals of FLTI are to effect positive family leadership development by: 1) helping families become leaders in their communities through civic engagement; 2) expanding and facilitating the capacity of families to be change agents on a neighborhood, regional and state level; 3) developing supportive communities of families within regions of the state; 4) facilitating family involvement in state and local policy decision-making processes; 5) increasing parent-child interaction through family involvement. Children's Hospital Colorado along with the Colorado Department of Public Health and Environment, Colorado State University Extension, Colorado Department of Human Services, and Colorado Health Foundation are primary partners of this state-wide initiative. Program graduates spend more than 120 hours to develop skills needed to become effective leaders in their communities. Once recruited and accepted in to the program, participants attend a 20-week curriculum that integrates personal and child development, leadership training, civic literacy and civic participation skills. In 2014, 15 community members graduated from the CHCO sponsored Institute. Coalition Building Children's Hospital Colorado's main hospital is located on the Anschutz Medical Campus in Aurora, Colorado. The community consists of many low-income neighborhoods and communities with significant unmet healthcare needs. Through Aurora Health Access (AHA), Children's Hospital Colorado has supported a multi-pronged approach to creating a culture of health in Aurora - an approach that aims to reduce the number of uninsured, promote access to care, improve care coordination, and encourage healthy behaviors. In particular, Children's Hospital Colorado leads the Pediatric Access to Care subcommittee and helps to focus the coalition's efforts on improving access to primary care and medical homes for children. Community Health Improvement (Advocacy) As part of its ongoing mission, Children's Hospital Colorado strives to strengthen our community and state by serving as advocates for children's health and well-being. We work to advance the mission of the hospital through comprehensive and strategic advocacy and legislative efforts on the local, state and national level. This includes researching and engaging in legislative and policy issues, directing advocacy campaigns, conducting public awareness/education, and fostering organizational relationships with community partners, advocacy groups/coalitions, elected officials, their staff, and policy makers. In January 2014, the sale of marijuana in Colorado was legalized. With the increasing availability of marijuana, Children's was concerned that Colorado hospitals would see a rise in unintentional exposures in children. Accidental exposures of marijuana products to children in Colorado have increased in the past three years, based on the rate of emergency department visits and admissions at Children's Colorado. Most of the accidental ingestion incidents in Colorado requiring hospital admission involve young children, especially toddlers. Many of these children are getting into edible products with high concentrations of THC. Symptoms vary anywhere from mild sleepiness, to poor respiratory effort, to coma requiring insertion of a breathing tube. To address this concern, Children's played a major role in crafting and supporting a marijuana safe-packaging bill. Passed by the House and Senate and signed into law by the governor, House Bill 1122 contains a number of provisions intended to limit youth access to marijuana, including a series of changes that simplify and strengthen marijuana regulations. These include closing a loophole that allowed some marijuana edible products to be sold in non-child-resistant packaging, and aligning child-safe packaging laws governing medical and retail marijuana products. Why it's good for kids: All marijuana products will now be sold in child-resistant, opaque, and re-sealable packaging, and the laws regulating packaging for both medical and retail marijuana are clearer to understand and enforce. Community Health Improvement (Literacy) A critical component to living a healthy life is the ability for people to access information they need about their health. This cannot be done effectively without basic literacy skills. Understanding that Children's Hospital Colorado is invested in creating programs that address the entire picture of health, we committed significant resources to improve low income, high risk population literacy rates. Children's Hospital Colorado has teamed up with Reach Out and Read with the goal of enrolling 100% of low income children in this evidence based literacy program run through primary care offices during well child visits. Because 90% of brain development occurs between birth and age 5 we wanted to utilize a program that offers an effective intervention during a critical window for learning. We recognize that If children miss the opportunity to acquire foundational language skills, they are set up for immediate struggles that impact their overall health and well-being. We are using our relationships with community physicians and our advocacy expertise and resources to support our objective. Workforce Development Medical Career Collaborative program (MC2)- Founded in 1998, MC2 engages high school students in experiences that give them a jump start on careers in health, medicine and the biosciences. The program recruits students from underrepresented backgrounds and those from socio-economically disadvantaged groups. The two-year program familiarize students with different aspects of health care through internships, field trips, workshops, student seminars, service learning opportunities, mentoring by hospital staff, post-secondary coaching and when appropriate, career guidance and job placement assistance at Children's Hospital. The Medical Career Collaborative is a strategic program as part of HR's workforce development efforts. As the program invests in these students it is essentially increasing the diversity and cultural awareness of the healthcare workforce as it builds the next generation of professionals here at Children's Colorado and in the community. In 2014 there were 50 enrolled students."

201543169349305539,840166760,"SCHEDULE H, PART VI, LINE 3","Children's Hospital Colorado has a process for informing and educating families about how they may be billed for patient care and their eligibility for financial assistance. Children's Hospital Colorado's full time patient financial counselors are dedicated to working with families to provide guidance regarding available financial assistance which ensures that its patient population receives the critical care it needs. Additionally, Children's Hospital Colorado provides patient assistance to help identify community-based resources, facilitate services and provide appropriate referral assistance to help with continuity of care. Inpatient Process: This process applies to patients who are being admitted for observation, surgery or other inpatient services. If the patient is pre-scheduled, Children's Hospital Colorado Patient Access works to contact the family prior to admission to arrange for a financial screening appointment. Regardless of whether an appointment is set prior to admission, the Patient Financial Counseling team works with the family to determine their self-pay status (either non-commercial or government insurance) and subsequently works with them to screen for financial assistance options. Outpatient Process: When a patient schedules a non-emergent or urgent outpatient clinic visit, they will identify themselves as self-pay if they do not have either commercial or government insurance. At this point, they are given two options: (1) pay A $200 deposit at the time of appointment and be billed any remaining balance or (2) schedule time with Patient Financial Counseling for assistance. If the patient was seen in the Emergency Department or Urgent Care without the pre-screen, they still have the opportunity to apply for financial assistance with the Patient Financial Counseling office. All self-pay families are automatically given a 35 percent discount. Children's Hospital Colorado has a formal policy regarding eligibility criteria for charity care. The decision to provide charity care will be, in all cases, based on a review of the income, assets and liabilities of the family at the time of admission to the Hospital or clinic. The levels of charity care and financial assistance provided by Children's Hospital Colorado will be determined based on Federal Poverty Guidelines which may be adjusted up to 200 percent and revised from time to time. Families with adjusted gross income between 200 percent and 400 percent of Federal Poverty Guidelines may also be considered for charity care with a cap for out-of-pocket responsibility. Determination of eligibility will be effective for six months and apply to all patients regardless of immigration status. Children's Colorado works to provide necessary hospital-related services consistent with its mission, its status as a nonprofit hospital and its stewardship responsibility to its donors."

In addition to being the only pediatric Level 1 trauma center in the region, Children's Colorado treats virtually all conditions, minor and serious, that affect children at its main campus, its 15 network of care locations and 400 clinics. In 2014, Children's Colorado saw 217,767 unique patients; provided 158,159 emergency and urgent care visits; and provided 526,887 outpatient visits. 96.4% of these patients came from Colorado, representing all 64 counties; of these, 76.1% came from Metro Denver and 17.4% from other Front Range counties.

Children's Hospital Colorado works to deliver on this mission not only in the Denver metro area and the state of Colorado, but also throughout the Rocky Mountain region. There are extensive efforts led by Children's Hospital Colorado that positively impact the health and safety of children in the community - to describe all of them in detail is not realistic in a limited space, thus below are some of the highlights. Medical Faculty Profile Children's Hospital Colorado has an open medical staff, meaning community practitioners can hold privileges at the hospital. It has approximately 2,330 medical staff and 230 residents and fellows including advanced practice nurses, more than half of whom are community-based. Though there are thousands of referring providers along the front range of the Rocky Mountains and the prairies, Children's Hospital Colorado's community staff members are its front-line partners in advancing a continuum of care for young patients. Its community clinical staff members provide training opportunities in primary care for medical students and residents helping to broaden the medical education of tomorrow's pediatric doctors. Children's Hospital Colorado is affiliated with family medicine residency programs in Colorado and Wyoming. This provides for a pediatric rotation at the hospital which provides a significant benefit to the region that has a large rural population and a shortage of rural physicians. Children's Hospital Colorado also ensures that the primary care perspective is addressed in discussions about how to best provide the broadest spectrum of care to the region's children. Additionally, both hospital and community medical staff serve on various boards and committees, such as the Colorado Chapter of the AAP, MDA National Clinical Advisory Committee, Colorado Children's Immunization Coalition, the State Trauma Board, various health advisory boards and numerous school health programs. Many participate in international medical missions to improve the health of children worldwide. Children's Health Advocacy Institute (CHAI) The mission of CHAI is to improve the health and safety of children by engaging public and private partners in creating a thriving community for children. CHAI serves as a centralized resource for the hospital to identify community child health needs and develop and implement evidence based programs and strategies in partnership with the community that seek to address these needs. Highlighted Activities Obesity: TO address the obesity health issue identified in the 2012 CHNA, a plan was established to integrate healthy weight screening and counseling into the primary care setting. This included the development of a training program, resources and the establishment of a healthy weight action plan within the electronic health record. In 2014, this effort was implemented in the Child Health Clinic (primary care) at Children's Hospital Colorado. Concurrently, Children's Colorado staff is working with the Colorado Pediatric Collaborative to support implementation in primary care practices throughout the community. K-12 Health Education: Launched in 2012, the 5th Gear Kids program is a collaborative effort between the University of Colorado Anschutz Health and Wellness Center, Children's Hospital Colorado, Aurora Public Schools and the Cherry Creek School District. 5th Gear Kids was designed to provide greater access to physical activity and healthy eating opportunities, and to increase the desirability among 5th graders to participate in healthy lifestyles. In 2014, 7,000 students in the Aurora Public Schools and Cherry Creek School Districts participated in the program. The data collected and analyzed is used to positively impact childhood obesity trends. With the design and implementation phase of the program complete, we're now working with partners to develop a scalable model to release the program across Colorado and the nation. Injury Prevention: The ""Each One Teach One"" CPS Outreach Program is a collaborative effort between Street-Smart, Inc., a Denver-based NPO, and the Injury Prevention Program at Children's Hospital Colorado. The goals of this program are to (1) increase the number of Denver County children ages birth-8 who are properly restrained in a car or booster seat, with special emphasis on increasing usage rates among African-American families living in the underserved neighborhoods of Northeast Denver, Park Hill, and Montebello; (2) increase the community's knowledge of the proper use of child restraints by offering CPS education and outreach opportunities to residents of these three communities; and (3) reduce the barrier of cost of child restraints to parents and caregivers by providing them to families in need. The goals were accomplished by partnering with Denver Health to staff CPS inspection stations at the Eastside and Montebello Family Health Centers, partnering with Mile High Montessori Head Start Centers to conduct CPS education and distribution events in neighborhoods at greatest statistical risk for MVC injuries sustained by children, conducting quarterly booster seat usage surveys in targeted neighborhoods, and evaluating progress toward increasing parent and caregiver knowledge, attitude, and skills through implementation of a CPS inspection station survey. In 2014, results included staffing over 100 hours at inspection stations, providing an additional 25 hours of CPS education and inspections at Head Start centers, distribution of over 400 child restraints to low-income families qualifying for federal entitlement programs, an observed increase of 4% in the number of booster seat-sized children traveling in booster seats during the course of program efforts, and an assessment of CPS awareness of over 100 parents and caregivers. Violence Prevention Regarding child abuse prevention, the hospital continued to convene stakeholders to lead a comprehensive statewide prevention effort and monitor outcomes through a formal research study, public health campaign evaluation, and monitoring of abusive head trauma cases. Additionally, the hospital provided education sessions and train- the -trainer instruction for thousands of community providers, partners, and interested individuals. Finally, the hospital furthered its role as a Center of Excellence for child abuse prevention by opening the multi-disciplinary Non Accidental Brain Injury Care Clinic in 2013. So far the clinic has cared for more than 50 newly diagnosed young children. In the past, children like these did not have comprehensive treatment for their unique medical, social, emotional, and academic needs. Children's Colorado is currently one of only a few hospitals in the U.S. to offer a multidisciplinary follow-up clinic for these young victims. Access to Care To address the multiple dimensions of increasing Access to Care, a priority identified in the 2012 CHNA, Children's Hospital Colorado continues to work in collaboration with several organizations to accomplish this end. Children's Hospital Colorado, Colorado Community Managed Care Network, and University of Colorado Hospital founded Colorado Access, a non-profit health plan that provides access to behavioral and physical health services for Coloradoans. Colorado Access is a community oriented organization driven by the needs of its members. Through regular provider and consumer advisory, engagement, and partnerships, Colorado Access works to strengthen the communities they serve through access to quality care. Over the past 20 year, Children's Hospital Colorado has provided consistent leadership to the organization. The Colorado Children's Healthcare Access Program (CCHAP) is a nonprofit organization that has grown from awareness that private practice healthcare providers throughout Colorado want to do their share in taking care of underserved children, but numerous barriers prevent them from doing so. Although the barriers to private practices serving these children were numerous, CCHAP, in coordination with private pediatric practices and family practices, have shown that these barriers can be overcome. Since 2006, CCHAP has recruited, coached and supported over 250 pediatric and family practices, which includes over 800 providers, to provide a Medical Home for over 200,000 children on Medicaid and CHP+. A Medical Home is a family-centered, cost-effective, and coordinated approach to care that ensures a child receives preventive physical, mental, and oral health services. CCHAP serves as the implementation arm of the Access-to-Care mission of the Children's Hospital Advocacy Institute (CHAI) by providing assistance to all medical homes that serve children both in the"

Charity care is provided to those patients where the household income (defined as income for the patient and any related guarantor as listed on the most recent Federal Tax Return) is at 200% or below federal poverty guidelines as published annually by the Community Service Administration in the Federal Register and where there are not substantial cash convertible assets or disposable income. Charity is predicated on the patient seeking Medicaid eligibility and fully cooperating with hospital staff (provide bank statements, proof of income, etc). Medicaid eligibility may be reevaluated each month or in connection with new services provided during the approved charity period (6 months.) If a patient qualifies for Charity care assistance, 100% of the billable charges are eliminated."

In the majority of cases, the determination of the patients ability to pay is not made until well after the services have been provided."

This community encompasses Brazoria, Chambers, Fort Bend, Galveston, Harris, Liberty, Montgomery, and Waller Counties. The Houston Methodist Hospital community spans 8,928.2 square miles and according to the U.S. Census contains a 2014 estimated population of 6,441,882 people. Harris County accounts for an estimated 4.4 million Houston Methodist Hospital community residents or approximately 68.1% of the designated service area. Harris County is the largest county in Texas.Three major age groups make up the Houston Methodist Hospital community. They are the youth, adolescent, and young adult population; the adult population; and the senior population. Houston Methodist defines the youth, adolescent, and young adult population as any person between the ages of 0-24 years. The youth, adolescent, and young adult population accounts for the second highest percentage of the HMH community (37%). Houston Methodist defines the adult population as any person between the ages of 25-64 years. The adult population accounts for the highest percentage of the Houston Methodist Hospital community (53%). Houston Methodist defines the senior population as any person over the age of 65 years. The senior population currently accounts for 10% of the Houston Methodist Hospital community.The Houston Methodist community as a whole has experienced an expansion in average household income. Chambers County has undergone the most growth in average household income (44%) and projections estimate it to lead all other counties in the Houston Methodist community in average household income growth to 2018 (16%). Harris County, comparatively, experienced the least growth in average household income from 2000-2013 (20%).The most apparent trend for the Houston Methodist Hospital community over the past twenty years has been increasing community diversification. Harris County, the largest county in the Houston Methodist Hospital service area, has a racial population that reflects 19.5% as Black/African, 31.9% as White/Non-Hispanic, 41.6% as Hispanic/Latino and 8% total identifying as other (Asian, Indian, etc.). These numbers enhance the idea that Houston is considered a minority-majority city. Another trend in the community is an expanding economic gap. The Kinder Institute (2014) surveyed Houstonians' attitude towards this increasing discrepancy. 71% of respondents in the survey were in favor of raising minimum wage. Furthermore, 18% of Houstonians surveyed reported having difficulty paying for groceries to feed their families. 62% of respondents agreed that the government should take action to reduce the economic gap, which is an increase from a 45% agreement in 2010. The existing gap between the rich and poor is a significant predictor of access to education. The thought that higher education is necessary for success varies among different ethnicities. For instance, 81% of Latinos, 78% of African Americans, and only 63% of non-Hispanic whites who were surveyed believed in the necessity of a secondary education."

201523179349304847,741180155,Identifying Community Health Issues,"Houston Methodist Hospital along with the other Houston Methodist hospitals identified community health priorities through a large scale needs assessment in 2013. The original assessment was created using several methods including, but not limited to, review of the Texas Institute for Health Policy Research community data, Texas Department of Public Health selected health data, community health status reports for Harris, Liberty, Fort Bend and Montgomery counties and community advisory groups committee reports for nonprofit clinics and agencies. In 2014, Houston Methodist updated the needs assessment to reflect any new changes. The updated assessment confirmed the originally identified priorities had not changed. The health priorities that Houston Methodist Hospital and the other Houston Methodist hospitals are addressing are as follows: -Access to Care Improvement:-Education to Decrease Health Risk Behaviors-Prevention of Chronic Disease and Conditions:Houston Methodist is addressing the identified needs by hospital through the utilization of resources unique to each hospital.

THE EXTERNAL ASSESSMENT WAS DEVELOPED FROM THE COMPILATION OF UTILIZATION, MARKET SHARE DEMOGRAPHIC AND FINANCIAL DATA AND PHYSICIAN WORKFORCE INFORMATION SPECIFIC TO OLEAN GENERAL HOSPITAL'S SERVICE AREA.STEPS 4, 5 AND 6 IDENTIFIED GOALS, STRATEGIES, AND OBJECTIVES THAT WILL SERVE AS OLEAN GENERAL HOSPITAL'S PRIORITIES THROUGH 2013. GOALS RESPOND TO THE QUESTION ""WHAT ARE THE KEY PRIORITIES?"" A SERIES OF STRATEGIES WERE DEVELOPED WHICH RESPOND TO THE QUESTION ""HOW DO WE ACHIEVE OUR PRIORITIES?"" FINALLY, A NUMBER OF SPECIFIC OBJECTIVES WERE DEVELOPED WHICH RESPOND TO THE QUESTION ""WHAT WILL BE ACCOMPLISHED ANNUALLY?"" OBJECTIVES WERE GENERATED BY SENIOR MANAGEMENT AND FORM THE BASIS FOR NEAR TERM ADMINISTRATIVE WORKPLANS.ESSENTIAL TO THE SUCCESS OF ANY STRATEGIC PLAN IS THE HOSPITAL'S ABILITY TO BOTH IMPLEMENT RECOMMENDATIONS MADE WITHIN THE PLAN AND TO RECOGNIZE THE DOCUMENT AS A DYNAMIC AND FLEXIBLE TOOL TO BE USED AS A GUIDE FOR THE FUTURE. SPECIFIC GOALS AND STRATEGIES MAY OR MAY NOT BE OBTAINED AND, UPON EVALUATION AND THE AVAILABILITY OF NEW INFORMATION AND DEVELOPMENTS, MAY NEED TO BE MODIFIED. A SUCCESSFUL STRATEGIC PLAN RECOGNIZES THIS POTENTIAL FOR CHANGE AND IS FLEXIBLE ENOUGH TO ACCOMMODATE NEW OR DIFFERENT OPPORTUNITIES AND CHALLENGES.CRITICAL HEALTH CARE ISSUESTHE RECENTLY ENACTED HEALTHCARE REFORM LEGISLATION UNDERSCORES MANY OF THE SIGNIFICANT ISSUES CURRENTLY FACING HOSPITALS. FOLLOWING IS LISTING OF CRITICAL ISSUES THAT WILL IMPACT HOSPITALS OVER THE NEXT SEVERAL YEARS. 1. QUALITY: HEALTH CARE QUALITY AND SAFETY ARE NOW STRATEGICALLY IMPORTANT, NOT JUST PROFESSIONALLY IMPORTANT. THE ADVENT OF WIDESPREAD PUBLIC REPORTING OF HOSPITAL QUALITY RESULTS ASSURES THAT A HOSPITAL'S QUALITY PERFORMANCE IS NO LONGER ONLY VISIBLE TO THE DIRECTOR OF QUALITY, QA COMMITTEE MEMBERS AND VARIOUS REGULATORS. THE NET EFFECT OF THIS TRANSPARENCY TREND OVER THE NEXT 5 YEARS WILL BE THAT THE DEFINITION OF A ""GOOD HOSPITAL"" WILL SHIFT SIGNIFICANTLY. NO LONGER WILL IT BE ENOUGH TO HAVE ATTRACTIVE FACILITIES, GOOD TECHNOLOGIES AND SKILLED DOCTORS AND NURSES. HOSPITALS WILL NEED TO MARSHAL THOSE RESOURCES INTO A QUALITY AND SAFETY SYSTEM CAPABLE OF RELIABLY PRODUCING MEASURED QUALITY RESULTS. PROVIDER PAYMENTS WILL INCREASINGLY BE A FUNCTION OF QUALITY OUTCOMES AND QUALITY BONUSES WILL BE DRAWN FROM ANNUAL PAYMENT UPDATES. INFORMATION SYSTEMS CAPABLE OF PROVIDING VALID AND RELIABLE QUALITY AND OUTCOME INDICATORS WILL BE A NECESSITY AS WILL THE USE OF EVIDENCE BASED GUIDELINES BY CLINICAL PROVIDERS. CONSUMERS WILL SEEK AND USE PERFORMANCE INFORMATION, INCLUDING PATIENT SATISFACTION INFORMATION, TO GUIDE THEIR CHOICE OF PROVIDERS.2. INFORMATION TECHNOLOGY: HEALTH INFORMATION TECHNOLOGY INCLUDES COMPUTER BASED TOOLS DEVELOPED SPECIFICALLY FOR HEALTH CARE DELIVERY. THESE TOOLS CAN PROVIDE CLINICIANS UP-TO-DATE INFORMATION ON THEIR PATIENTS, ACCESS TO THE LATEST MEDICAL KNOWLEDGE AND BEST PRACTICES THROUGH DECISION SUPPORT SYSTEMS. IT IS UNDERSTOOD THAT INVESTMENTS IN NEW CLINICAL AND INFORMATION TECHNOLOGY CAN SIGNIFICANTLY ENHANCE PATIENT SAFETY AND CLINICAL OUTCOMES. COMPUTERIZED PHYSICIAN ORDER ENTRY (CPOE), BAR CODING AND ITS POTENTIAL TO REDUCE MEDICATION ERRORS, AND ELECTRONIC MEDICAL RECORDS (EMRS) AND THEIR POSITIVE IMPACT ON MEDICAL ERRORS ARE ALL EXAMPLES OF HEALTH CARE'S USE OF IT SOLUTIONS TO IMPROVE QUALITY. THE FEDERAL GOVERNMENT HAS HIGHLIGHTED THE ROLE OF HEALTH INFORMATION TECHNOLOGY AS A MEANS TO IMPROVE HEALTH CARE QUALITY, SAFETY AND NOW IS PROVIDING STIMULUS AND INCENTIVE PAYMENTS TO PROVIDERS TO FACILITATE AND HASTEN THEIR ADOPTION INTO THE CARE DELIVERY PROCESS. EMR'S WILL BECOME A PREREQUISITE OF ANY DELIVERY SYSTEM THAT INTENDS TO PROVIDE COORDINATED COST EFFECTIVE CARE.3. PHYSICIANS: PHYSICIANS HAVE EMERGED AS CRITICAL OPERATIONAL AND STRATEGIC PARTNERS TO HOSPITALS. THOSE THAT ARE SUCCESSFUL IN ENGAGING AND COLLABORATING WITH THEIR MEDICAL STAFFS WILL BE BEST ABLE TO DEMONSTRATE HIGH QUALITY CARE AND COMPLIANCE WITH HEALTH REFORM'S VALUE BASED PURCHASING AND OTHER QUALITY MANDATES.ADDITIONALLY, GIVEN THE INCREASE IN DEMAND FOR HEALTHCARE SERVICES THAT WILL BE OCCASIONED BY REFORM, THE ABILITY TO SUCCESSFULLY RECRUIT PHYSICIANS WILL BE CRITICAL. AT A TIME WHEN HEALTHCARE REFORM INITIATIVES EMPHASIZE THE ROLE OF PRIMARY CARE, THERE IS A SPECIAL NEED TO INTENSIFY EFFORTS TO RECRUIT PRIMARY CARE PROVIDERS. BECAUSE THE VAST MAJORITY OF NEW PHYSICIANS PREFER EMPLOYMENT AS THEIR PRACTICE PREFERENC,, THE ABILITY OF HOSPITALS TO BE ABLE TO OFFER PHYSICIANS A CONTEMPORARY AND COMPETITIVE ""EMPLOYMENT PLATFORM"" IS ESSENTIAL.4. FINANCE AND CAPITAL: FINANCIAL PERFORMANCE AND ACCESS TO CAPITAL WILL CONTINUE TO BE AMONG THE MOST CRITICAL ISSUES CONFRONTING HOSPITALS. EVEN WITH HEALTHCARE REFORM, HEALTHCARE COSTS WILL CONTINUE TO OUTPACE INFLATION. INCREASING WAGE AND SALARY COSTS, AND RISING HEALTH CARE COSTS IN GENERAL WILL CONTINUE TO IMPACT OPERATING PERFORMANCE AND PRESS HOSPITALS TO CONTINUE A RELENTLESS FOCUS ON COST MANAGEMENT. ADDITIONALLY, REVENUE STRATEGIES WILL NEED TO BE DEVELOPED TO GENERATE PROFITABLE GROWTH IN PATIENT VOLUME, AS WILL THE NEED TO ENSURE OPTIMAL MANAGEMENT OF ALL REVENUE CYCLE ACTIVITIES. HOSPITALS ARE FACING SIGNIFICANT PAYMENT REDUCTIONS IN TERMS OF DECREASES IN MEDICARE UPDATES, DISPROPORTIONATE SHARE, SNF AND HOMECARE PAYMENTS. AS HOSPITALS CONTINUE TO POST LOW OR NO PROFIT MARGINS, INVESTMENT INCOME WILL BE MORE IMPORTANT THAN EVER. HOWEVER, GIVEN THE FACT THAT INVESTMENT INCOME IS A HIGHLY UNCERTAIN COMPONENT OF A HOSPITAL'S OVERALL FINANCIAL HEALTH, HOSPITALS WILL BE DRIVEN TO PURSUE MORE PHILANTHROPY. HOSPITAL CAPITAL SPENDING WILL BE DRIVEN BY GROWING DEMANDS FOR ADVANCED TECHNOLOGY NEEDED TO ENSURE PATIENT QUALITY AND SAFETY, THE NEED TO REPLACE AND UPDATE AGING FACILITIES, AND THE DESIRE AND NEED TO IMPROVE TECHNOLOGY BASED SERVICES.5. RISK MANAGEMENT AND COMPLIANCE: HEALTHCARE'S TECHNOLOGY HAS NEVER BEEN MORE COMPLICATED, PATIENTS' DEMANDS HIGHER, AND THE BUSINESS CHALLENGES GREATER. ACCORDINGLY, COMPREHENSIVE RISK MANAGEMENT PROGRAM ARE ESSENTIAL IN ASSURING CARE DELIVERY SYSTEMS THAT ARE HIGHLY EFFECTIVE IN TERMS OF ASSURING APPROPRIATE LEVELS OF PATIENT SAFETY AND QUALITY.THE DEPARTMENT OF JUSTICE ESTIMATES THAT THE FEDERAL GOVERNMENT LOSES BILLIONS OF DOLLARS ANNUALLY IN HEALTH CARE FRAUD. CONSEQUENTLY, THE GOVERNMENT'S HEALTHCARE FRAUD ENFORCEMENT ACTIVITIES WITH RESPECT TO ALL HEALTHCARE PROVIDERS CONTINUE TO GROW AND EXPAND. WELL ESTABLISHED CORPORATE COMPLIANCE PROGRAMS ARE ESSENTIAL IN TERMS OF ALLOWING HOSPITALS TO IDENTIFY POTENTIAL AREAS OF LIABILITY AND TO CORRECT PROBLEMS.6. NURSING: NURSES AND NURSING CARE ARE CENTRAL TO THE DELIVERY OF SAFE AND EFFECTIVE PATIENT CARE. ACCORDINGLY, ENSURING AN ADEQUATE NURSING WORKFORCE AND CREATING A WORK ENVIRONMENT THAT SUPPORTS NURSING PRACTICE AND INTERDISCIPLINARY COLLABORATION ARE IMPORTANT PRIORITIES FOR HOSPITALS TODAY."

Patients are notified of the financial assistance policy at the time of registration via posted notifications and on every account statement that is sent to them. This information is available in a number of languages. Patients may apply for financial assistance at any time during the revenue cycle. Per the Provision for Financial Assistance Policy, the collection process is as follows: - Pre-Litigation Review. Prior to an account being authorized for the filing of suit for non-payment of a patient bill, a final review of the account will be conducted and approved by the Financial Counseling Representative (or designee) to make sure that no application of financial assistance was ever received and that there exists objective evidence that the patient does have sufficient financial means to pay all or part of his/her bill. Prior to a collections suit being filed, the Self-pay Collections Director must review and approve. - Residential Liens. No hospital will place a lien on the primary residence of a patient who has been determined to be eligible for Financial Assistance/Charity Care, for payment of the patient's undiscounted balance due. Further, in no case will any hospital execute a lien by forcing the sale or foreclosure of the primary residence of any patient to pay for any outstanding medical bill. - No Use of Body Attachments. No hospital will use body attachment to require any person, whether receiving Financial Assistance/Charity Care discounts or not, to appear in court. - Collection Agency Referrals. Each hospital Finance accounting will ensure that all collection agencies used to collect patient bills promptly refer any patient who indicates financial need, or otherwise appears to qualify for Financial Assistance/Charity Care discounts, to a financial counselor to determine if the patient is eligible for such a charitable discount. For more information about the Presence Health Financial Assistance Program, see www.presencehealth.org/patients-and-visitors/financial-assistance."
201503209349313530,362167800,"PART VI, 2: NEEDS ASSESMENT","In addition to conducting CHNAs every three (3) years, Presence Saint Francis Hospital joins forces with local community organizations to assess the health needs of the community on an ongoing basis. We participate in a variety of coalitions, commissions, committees, boards, partnerships and panels. Our community outreach workers and liaisons spend ample time in the community PSFH serves, and bring back first-hand knowledge of community needs. We also solicit guidance and invite input from a group of external participants to review our community benefit plan, neighborhood relations, and data supplements to advise us on the priority needs and directions with regard to community needs. External group participants include representatives from the Public Health Department, local aldermen and representatives, leaders from community based organizations, foundations, churches, colleges, coalitions and associations. These participants are experts in a wide range of areas including: public health, minority populations, health care disparities, mental health, and health and social services. Soliciting feedback from this group helps us to ensure we are aware of the most pressing community health needs. Presence Health ministries also complete medical staff development plans. These plans are conducted by external consultants, who provide an independent assessment of the need for physicians by specialty within the hospital's primary service area as defined by Stark regulations. We also review and analyze our own internal patient data (Inpatient and Emergency Department utilization) on an annual basis to uncover any new community health trends. We review purchased and publicly available data and analyses on the market, demographics, and health service utilization."
201503209349313530,362167800,"PART VI, 3: PATIENT EDUCATION OF ELIGIBILITY FOR ASSISTANCE","Presence Health hospital ministries proactively communicate the availability of our financial assistance/charity care programs by using multiple types of appropriate media and in multiple appropriate languages. The mechanisms used by Presence Health hospitals to communicate the availability of Financial Assistance/Charity Care include, but are not limited to the following: 1. Signage. Signs are posted prominently throughout high traffic areas of our ministries, as well as within our inpatient and outpatient registration/patient admitting areas and emergency departments. Signs state that patients may be eligible for Financial Assistance/Charity Care discounts, and describe how to obtain more information, including identification of appropriate hospital representatives by title. Signs are in multiple languages. 2. Provision of Financial Assistance Materials to Uninsured Patients. Presence Health hospitals provide a summary of its Financial Assistance Programs and a Financial Assistance application to all persons receiving hospital care that it identifies as uninsured patients at the time of in-person registration, admission, or such later time that the patient is first identified as an uninsured patient. For patients presenting in the Emergency Department, all Presence Health hospitals provide such Financial Assistance materials at such time and in such manner as is consistent with their obligations under EMTALA to access for and stabilize any patient with an emergency medical condition before making inquiry of the patient's ability to pay. 3. Brochures. Brochures, information sheets and similar forms of written communication regarding the hospital's Financial Assistance/Charity Care policy are maintained in appropriate areas of the hospital (e.g. Emergency Department, organized registration areas, the Business Office). These communications state in multiple languages that the hospital offers Financial Assistance/Charity Care discounts and describes how to obtain more information. 4. Website. Comprehensive information about our financial assistance programs - including eligibility criteria, application details, and contact information - is also available on our consumer Web site (http://presencehealth.org/patients-and-visitors/financial-assistance). 5. Billing Notices. Each Presence Health hospital includes a note on or with the hospital bill and/or statement regarding the hospital's Financial Assistance/Charity Care program and how the patient may apply for consideration under this program. 6. Financial Counselors. Each Presence Health hospital has one or more financial counselors whose contact information is listed or provided with other information concerning the Financial Assistance/Charity Care discount program. These counselors are available to discuss eligibility and other questions concerning the program, and provide assistance with applications. They are also available to meet with patients during their stay if they have questions about their ability to pay for services and our financial assistance programs. 7. Notification of Determination. When a Presence Health hospital makes a determination that a patient's bill is discounted or adjusted based on a determination of financial need, the hospital notifies the patient of such eligibility determination and that there is no further collection action taken on the discounted portion of the patient's bill."
201503209349313530,362167800,"PART VI, 4: COMMUNITY INFORMATION","Presence Health provides services at 150 sites, including twelve acute care hospitals with a total of 2,997 staffed beds and over 90 primary and specialty care clinic. These ministries offer a broad range of services from highly specialized tertiary services to an extended network of primary and ambulatory care. Presence Health has identified a separate service area for each of its acute care hospitals utilizing a consistent methodology and reflecting a combination of geographic location and market share criteria. The total service area of each ministry represents approximately 80% to 90% of the total inpatient discharges from that facility. The primary service area (the ""Primary Service Area"") of each facility represents approximately 65 to 75% of such discharges and the secondary service area (the ""Secondary Service Area"") of each facility represents approximately 15 to 25% of such discharges. The Primary Service Areas and Secondary Service Areas have been determined by utilizing a patient origin analysis to identify those zip codes that represent inpatient discharges. These zip codes are then mapped to identify geographic coverage of the Primary Service Areas and Secondary Service Areas. Many of the Presence Health hospital ministries facilities are located in population growth areas. Based upon population estimates and projections obtained from Claritas, Inc., the population of the our hospitals' combined service area is expected to grow at a rate of 1.9% annually between 2012 and 2017, compared with a growth rate of 1.3% and 1.6% per year in the Chicago MSA and in Illinois, respectively. Of Presence's total service area population, 10.7% is over the age of 65, compared to 11.1% and 12.3% in the Chicago MSA and in Illinois, respectively. The Presence Saint Francis Hospital CHNA service area includes Evanston (60201, 60202, and 60203), Rogers Park (60626), and West Ridge (60645). The total population of zip codes 60201, 60202, 60203, 60626 and 60645 in 2010 was 201,419, making up the service area of PSFH. Demographics While the U.S. and Illinois population increased 10% and 3% respectively, the city of Chicago lost 7% of its population from 2000 to 2010. Similarly, Rogers Park lost 13% of its population during this time period. The population in Evanston and West Ridge remained relatively unchanged. Evanston (74,486) and West Ridge (71,942) have about the same size population, while Rogers Park has about 20,000 fewer residents than the other two communities. About a quarter of the population in all these communities is under 20 years of age, percentages that are quite similar to Chicago, Cook County, Illinois and the U.S. Between 8% (in zip code 60626-Rogers Park) and 12% (in Evanston) of the population are over 65. The largest racial group in Evanston is White (over 60%) with about 20% of the population identifying as Black and about 8% Hispanic/Latino. In West Ridge, the Asian and Hispanic/Latino population combined is slightly larger (44%) than the White population (40%.) In Rogers Park both the Black and Hispanic/Latino populations each comprise about 25% of the total while the White proportion is near 40%. One in five of the residents in West Ridge are limited English speakers, compared to about 15% in Rogers Park and just over 5% in Evanston. While Spanish is the most common language spoken in all areas, West Ridge stands out for the diversity of languages spoken. Socioeconomic While the median income for West Ridge, at $47,323, is similar to Chicago as a whole, the median income for Rogers Park is considerably lower, at $39,482. The median income for Evanston is almost $20,000 more than for Chicago, at $68,107. As might be expected, only 10% of Evanston residents and 10% or less of Evanston children live below the poverty line. Fifteen percent of the residents and almost 25% of children in West Ridge live in poverty. In Rogers Park, 23% of residents and 37% of the children are living in poverty. Nearly half of Rogers Park residents are living below 200% of the FPL. Seventy percent or more of students receive free or reduced lunch in all schools in Rogers Park. Most schools in Evanston have 50% or less of students receiving free or reduced lunch, though there are higher rates in south Evanston. Only 6% of residents in Evanston lack a high school degree, compared with 18%-20% in Rogers Park and West Ridge. Almost two-thirds of Evanston residents over 25 have a college degree, compared to only one-third of Chicago residents. For the period 2006-2010, West Ridge had the highest unemployment rate at 7.9% followed by Rogers Park at 7.5% and Evanston at 6.8%. Access to Care The percentage of people uninsured in Chicago (19.8%) is higher than the national and state averages; the uninsured rate in Evanston (8.3%) is more than 10 percentage points lower than Chicago. About 30% of residents in the West Ridge and Rogers Park zip codes are enrolled in Medicaid. While the rates of self-pay among ER outpatients at PSFH were similar to the state (18% and 15% respectively), 45% of outpatients at PSFH were on Medicaid, compared to only 34% statewide. There were 3,839 requests for interpreters at PSFH in FY2011. Over half of the requests were for Spanish, which was the most common language spoken in these communities, followed by Russian. There were requests for a wide variety of language interpretation, with 60 different languages requested over the year. There are no primary care shortages in Evanston. However, Rogers Park has a shortage for all residents and West Ridge has a shortage for low-income residents. There is no shortage of mental health services in Evanston. However, like most of North Chicago, West Ridge and Rogers Park both have mental health shortages for low-income residents.

Healthy behavior goals are selected by participants and a diabetes educator at the beginning of the program and then to be re-evaluated midway through the program and upon program completion or as needed. All participants that can demonstrate optimal glycemic levels or improved glycemic levels are invited to attend a recognition celebration that rewards them for achieving improved health status.

The name Presence Health embodies the act of being present in every moment we share with those we serve and is the cornerstone of a patient, resident and family-centered care environment. ""Presence"" Health embodies the way we choose to be present in our communities, as well as with one another and those we serve. Presence Health is sponsored by five congregations of Catholic religious women: the Franciscan Sisters of the Sacred Heart, the Servants of the Holy Heart of Mary, the Sisters of the Holy Family of Nazareth, Sisters of Mercy of the Americas and the Sisters of the Resurrection. As was the case from our very beginnings, Presence Health is called to be much more than just a provider of health services. Presence Health has instilled within all of its ministries that are committed to responding to the needs of those we are privileged to serve; delivering high quality care that is accessible to all. It is this culture of caring and giving that drives our diligent efforts to ensure we return the optimal value of our charitable assets to our local communities. As a not-for-profit health system, Presence Health invests a significant portion of its operating capital into the community through programs to serve vulnerable populations, such as the poor and uninsured, manage chronic conditions, and promote health education and promotion outreach and initiatives. In fiscal year 2014, this included $180 million in community benefit activities. Presence Health takes a systems approach to its community benefit efforts, and therefore ensures its member hospitals and other entities and affiliates are helping to promote and address the health needs of the communities they serve.

201503209349314260,141338428,Part VI - Needs Assessment,"On November 5, 2013, the Board of Trustees of Ellis Hospital adopted by Resolution a Community Health Needs Assessment and associated Implementation Strategy, the latter in the form of a grid. The document is being made widely available on the Ellis Medicine website http://www.ellismedicine.org/pages/community-report.aspx and as a paper copy for public inspection at the administrative office of Ellis Hospital (1101 Nott Street, Schenectady, New York 12308) as of November 15, 2013.Development of this assessment and plan has been a unique undertaking for the Schenectady healthcare and human services community. The document, a consolidated, multi-year, multi-agency, community-wide plan for action to improve the health of people in Schenectady, New York is the result of the combined efforts of 62 organizations. The Schenectady Coalition for a Healthy Community, informed by multiple credible data sources including a door-to-door survey of community residents, developed this assessment and plan to serve the people of the City and County of Schenectady.Three of the top priorities identified in Schenectady are consistent with the three Prevention Agenda priorities of the other Capital Region counties; Albany and Rensselaer. This consistency will enable consideration of a Region-wide approach to implementation strategies.Central to this assessment and plan, the UMatter Schenectady survey consisted of more than 280 questions and was administered to over 2,000 residents of the City of Schenectady between February and May 2013 by Community Health Workers and volunteer college students. In addition to the survey results, this plan was informed by secondary data from such sources as the U.S. Census and the New York State Department of Health, and from specialized data sources including a recent federally-funded study of diabetes in Schenectadys West Indian population.All told, between November 2012 and October 2013 the Coalition held 28 meetings of healthcare experts, representatives of community interests, and community residents; utilizing government-recommended group-voting techniques to compile a list of 20 significant community health needs, and to prioritize five of these as most requiring community-wide corrective action over the next three years."
201503209349314260,141338428,Part VI - Patient Education of Eligibility for Assistance,"Ellis Medicine provides financial assistance information about programs available to assist patients in paying for their bills, including discount programs and charity care, on its external website (www.ellismedicine.org) (specifically at http://www.ellismedicine.org/financial-assistance/faqs.aspx), in readily available and publicly distributed brochures, and through flyers and posters visible throughout the organization. Applications for financial assistance are available online at the Ellis website. Additionally, Ellis employs Financial Advocates who assist patients in determining the availability of and their eligibility for free or low-cost care, and then assist them with completing the necessary paperwork. Since 2009, Ellis Medicine has included affirmative financial assistance outreach as part of the innovative Medical Home through which it aims to increase access to care and provide healthcare navigation services to patients (especially the underserved and uninsured / underinsured), including education about and assistance with charity care and financial assistance services. Prior to creation of the health insurance enrollment programs by the Patient Protection and Affordable Care Act of 2010 (PPACA), Ellis offered Medicaid enrollment through employees deputized by the Schenectady County Department of Social Services, through Facilitated Enrollers employed by the not-for-profit Health Capital District Initiative (HCDI), and through Fidelis, one of New Yorks not-for-profit Medicaid Managed Care Organizations. Starting in 2013, Ellis arranged for on-site services of Health Insurance Navigators engaged by all four not-for-profit organizations designated pursuant to the PPACA. Navigators saw uninsured residents at both the Nott Street and Ellis Health Center Campuses. Ellis employees also completed training as Certified Application Counselors (CACs) and are qualified to help people enroll both in Medicaid as well as in Exchange insurance products.Additionally, Ellis publicizes its Financial Call Center & Information Line (sharing with our 3,300 employees; our local, state and federal lawmakers offices in case they receive constituent inquiries related to hospital costs and/or financial services at Ellis; and the general public), highlighting a number to call (518-243-1695) through which patients can receive information about how much their care will cost at Ellis Medicine as a way to be transparent and helpful in providing this information, as more and more patients are paying higher deductibles and are concerned about the cost to them out-of-pocket. This is particularly significant in Ellis Primary Service Area, as the largest local employer has converted to a high-deductible health insurance plan for most of its employees.Ellis has also participated in health fairs and employer information functions to advise small businesses and their employees of Ellis Financial Call Center & Information Line. Ellis Call Center has trained specialists who can help enroll qualifying patients in Financial Assistance programs, estimate a patients out-of-pocket expenses based on their medical plan, provide pricing for procedures and tests at Ellis Medicine and assist patients in completing Medicaid applications when applicable. Ellis Information Line helps with physician referrals, scheduling outpatient testing and providing general information about programs and services at Ellis Medicine."
201503209349314260,141338428,Part VI - Community Information,"In accordance with industry standards, Ellis Hospitals community is defined as the hospitals Primary and Secondary Service Areas, accounting for 80% of the hospitals discharge volume. These include all or portions of Schenectady, Saratoga, Albany, Fulton, and Montgomery counties and are comprised of 22 zip codes. Since the State-mandated consolidation of Schenectadys hospitals, Ellis has become the sole provider of acute hospital care in Schenectady County, and it is the largest hospital within its Service Areas.The Primary Service Area is focused on the City of Schenectady, an older industrial city with a population of about 60,000, a substantial decline from the 1940 high of over 90,000. According to the City of Schenectadys 2010-2014 Consolidated Plan, 67% of households in the city are considered low or moderate income, while the poverty rate in the Hamilton Hill neighborhood, adjacent to Ellis Hospital, is over 28%. Nearly all (95%) of the Citys housing stock was built before 1978, and Schenectady neighborhoods have been identified as having among the highest concentration of elevated blood levels for lead in New York State.An impact of the level of poverty in the City of Schenectady has been the extent to which Ellis patients are either covered by government health programs or are uninsured. During 2013, Medicare patients accounted for 40.8% of inpatient discharges, 30.1% of outpatient visits, and 35.5% of net patient revenues before bad debts. Medicaid covered 21.0% of inpatient discharges, 27.4% of outpatient visits, and 16.3% of net patient revenues before bad debts. Uninsured patients accounted for 3.8% of inpatient discharges and 5.6% of outpatient visits, and 1.7% of net patient revenues before bad debts. Overall, uninsured or government insured patients made up 65.6% of inpatient discharges and 63.1% of outpatient visits, while generating 53.5% of net patient revenues before bad debts.There is one Medically Underserved Population (MUP) within Ellis Primary Service Area. The homebound population of Schenectady County is designated MUP 06211. In response, physicians on the staff of the Ellis Family Health Center make house calls, and residents in the hospitals Family Medicine Residency may include house calls in their training. During 2013, two Health Professions Shortage Areas (HPSA) were re-designated in the City of Schenectady: the entire City is now identified as an HPSA for Dental and Mental Health services. The Primary Care HPSAs remain limited to a small number of Census Tracts in the Hamilton Hill/Mont Pleasant neighborhoods.The Secondary Service Area is a much wider geographic area, including rural and farming communities, as well as affluent suburbs. Overall, the combined Service Areas represent a study in contrasts. A nearly equal number of people have incomes below $25,000 as above $100,000. Health status variations are similarly dramatic. For example, according to the New York State Department of Health the rates of asthma-related hospital admissions per 10,000 people vary from 458 in the 12307 ZIP code to 49 in the 12309 ZIP code, a distance of about five miles.Census data for the combined Primary and Secondary Service Areas for 2013 estimate a total population of 377,974. This is projected to increase to 380,182 by 2018. The 2013 median income was $62,648 while the mean income was $73,485, demonstrating the impact of outliers. The gender distribution is 49% male and 51% female. Twenty-one percent of the population has a bachelors degree or higher. There will, however, likely be increased need for healthcare services as the community ages. The greatest increase in population from 2013 to 2018 is expected to be in the 65 and over age range (2.08%), while the greatest decrease is expected in the 35-54 age range (2.43%)."
201503209349314260,141338428,Part VI - Community Building Activities,"Ellis Medicine (the trade name for Ellis Hospital) successfully restructured healthcare services following the New York State-mandated hospital consolidation in Schenectady in 2007-2008, and has since been working to improve the efficiency and effectiveness of services to its community by aligning its innovative approaches to community health with the services provided by other local community-based public and not-for-profit organizations. Ellis is now the sole acute care hospital in Schenectady County, and is one of the largest primary care providers, having assumed responsibility for the services of two former hospitals which closed during the States rightsizing process. In this important role, Ellis has engaged the community and developed coalitions with community partners in order to ensure access to a full range of healthcare services, with special attention paid to disadvantaged members of our community. Ellis has undertaken and is planning a number of significant capital projects to consolidate care, enhance access to care, and improve the overall quality, efficiency, and cost-effectiveness of our local healthcare system. One of Ellis Medicines key community building activities is Care Central, a community-focused, multi-partner, care management program derived from Ellis original Medical Home initiative, which is a central location for primary care and outpatient services on a single campus aimed at improving access to healthcare, especially among the uninsured and underinsured. The Ellis Medical Home offers primary care (adult and pediatric), dental care, outpatient child/adolescent mental health services, and diabetes education,along with a number of outpatient services such as medical imaging, laboratory, a sleep disorders center, wound care, and day surgery. The Medical Home features specially trained Health Services Navigators, one an Ellis employee and the other contracted from Schenectady County Public Health Services, and a Community Services Navigator, a counselor employed by the local community action agency, who help patients connect to the healthcare and social services programs they need, including Medicaid facilitated enrollment services, and a free Community Shuttle which provides transportation from a number of community sites including homeless shelters and soup kitchens to the healthcare campus. The Medical Home is an effective partnership among Ellis Medicine and numerous community groups, including the Schenectady Community Action Program, the Salvation Army, the City Mission, YWCA, YMCA, Schenectady City School District, and Schenectady County Public Health Services, among other social service and community agencies.The success of the Medical Home in building community coalitions helped lead to a successful application by a community partnership for designation by the New York State Department of Health as one of the first three upstate Medicaid Health Homes. The Health Home program, which was established by the Patient Protection and Affordable Care Act (PPACA) of 2010 and conforming State law, is intended to provide a comprehensive array of healthcare and community support services to Medicaid patients with designated high-cost conditions. New York State has chosen to initially focus on patients with multiple chronic conditions, behavioral health issues, and/or HIV/AIDS. A coalition of over 40 healthcare and community agencies led by Ellis, the Visiting Nurse Service of Schenectady and Saratoga Counties, Inc., and Hometown Health (the Schenectady FQHC) now provides comprehensive care management services to high risk Medicaid patients in Schenectady County.A third component of Care Central is a Medicare Community-based Care Transitions Program (CCTP) which serves patients discharged from ten different hospitals in a ten-county region. Ellis is the largest participating hospital.Another example of Ellis coalition building activities is its participation in the Schenectady County Public Health Services federally funded Strategic Alliance for Health (SAH), which brings together a host of healthcare and community organizations to address chronic disease and to promote disease prevention and wellness. An Ellis representative participates in regular meetings of the SAH board. Ellis also works closely with the Schenectady County Public Health Services and the Healthy Capital District Initiative (HCDI) to assess community needs and to develop both the federally-required Community Health Needs Assessment and the State-required Community Service Plan (CSP) to identify health priorities (see Part V).Additionally, Ellis partners with a number of community partners, such as the American Cancer Society and the YWCA, to provide health screenings to uninsured and underinsured populations in our service area. Ellis provides office space and other in-kind support for the State-sponsored Schenectady County Cancer Services Program. In collaboration with community partners, Ellis offers outpatient smoking cessation courses and sponsors peer-driven mental health and cancer patient support groups. And, Ellis cooperates with community groups to facilitate access to healthy foods for people through the community. In past years, acting in collaboration with the Schenectady County Planning Department and the Cooperative Extension, Ellis hosted a weekly Farmers Market in the parking lot of the Ellis Health Center during the summer months. Starting in 2013, physicians at the Family Health Center began prescribing fresh vegetables to at-risk patients as part of a foundation-funded grant program. The prescription constitutes a voucher for no-charge locally-grown vegetables which are distributed at a farm stand located at the Ellis Health Center.Medical residents from the Ellis Family Medicine Residency donate their time and expertise to staff two free community-based medical clinics. A weekly clinic at the Schenectady City Mission serves uninsured, homeless individuals in the City of Schenectady. And a rural seasonal clinic provides care to uninsured migrant workers in collaboration with the Columbia County Department of Health.Ellis staffs a Green Team that works to promote recycling and other eco-friendly practices throughout the organization. Ellis staff members also sit on numerous community boards and healthcare coalitions to target improvements in such areas as diabetes, long term care, cancer, hospital readmission rates, and healthy living."
201503209349314260,141338428,Part VI - Explanation Of How Organization Furthers Its Exempt Purpose,"Ellis Medicine furthers its exempt purpose by promoting the health of the community through:A volunteer Board of Trustees that is comprised of community members, medical staff members and hospital administrators who serve three year terms, up to a three term maximum. Currently, the Ellis Board is comprised of 23 trustees 18 non-physician citizens of the community, four physicians, and one senior hospital administrator (the hospitals President and CEO). Ellis does not have a parent corporation.An open medical staff consisting of approximately 595 affiliated physicians and other providers. Medical privileges at Ellis Hospital are available to all qualified physicians in the area. Approximately 230 physicians and other providers are employed by Ellis, including 30 residents participating in the Family Medicine Residency and three in the General Dental Residency. Ellis medical staff is led by a Medical-Dental Executive Committee (MDEC). The MDEC plays an integral part in the hospitals corporate structure and daily operations. The MDEC and the department chairs, who oversee specific clinical services, work collaboratively with the hospitals volunteer Board of Trustees, administrators, and staff to ensure the highest quality of care is delivered to patients and that the community's healthcare needs are met with excellence. Physicians also serve as members of the hospitals Board of Trustees, and they are directly involved in the hospitals annual budget process: they rank and prioritize all capital items in the hospitals capital budget and they sign off on volume projections for the hospitals annual operating budget.Operation of two, full service, fully staffed emergency rooms on two separate Schenectady campuses, both of which are open 24 hours-a-day, seven days-a-week, 365 days-a-year, along with 24/7 emergent care services now available for the first time in Southern Saratoga County. Ellis emergency rooms care for all those in need of emergency care regardless of their ability to pay. Similarly, Ellis Hospitals admission policy is not restrictive. Ellis does not deny admission to any patient based on his/her ability to pay. The work of The Foundation for Ellis Medicine, a 501 (c) (3) tax-exempt charitable organization whose sole purpose is to encourage philanthropic support for Ellis Hospital. The Ellis Hospital Foundation was established in 1982 and is governed by a separate board of trustees. Funds raised through the Foundations activities are used to assist the hospital in acquiring state-of-the-art medical equipment and support a wide range of health care programs and services. Reinvesting its surplus funds to expand/replace/modernize its facilities and medical equipment; support programs/activities aimed at improving quality of care and patient safety; train and educate its medical and nursing staffs; and to improve the overall delivery of and accessibility to health care services in the community.Ellis Medicine demonstrates leadership as a charitable institution by organizing and participating in communitywide efforts for the needy; reaching out to the underserved to provide needed primary and preventative healthcare services and health education, especially through its Medical Home; attracting and using funds to serve the needy; participating in Medicaid and other federal, state, and local healthcare reimbursement programs for the needy such as Child Health Plus; and formally planning for and providing charity care and maintaining a policy of administering care to all persons in need.Ellis Medicine is accountable to the community by having a volunteer governing board comprised of members of the Schenectady community; inviting and responding to community input and involvement in planning and review of hospital activities; voluntarily disclosing information to the public on hospital services, financial status, community benefit activities and charity care; and advocating for healthcare cost containment and promoting the efficient use of healthcare resources within the community."

One approach to assessing needs involves surveying community members about health needs related to national and state health goals. Alle-Kiski Medical Center also acts on expressed community needs by responding to direct community requests for health screenings, outreach events and other health-related activities and by maintaining longstanding programs that are well attended and positively evaluated by community participants. In addition, Alle-Kiski Medical Center gathers community input through participation in area rotaries, chambers of commerce, through partnerships with community organizations and other community engagement activities. Another means is through reviewing and taking appropriate actions on feedback gathered from the following sources: routine market assessments; patient and family satisfaction surveys; Press Ganey surveys; patient, patient family and staffs' suggestions for improving patient safety; medical staff input and physician surveys. AKMC conducted a Community Health Needs Assessment (CHNA) during the year ended June 30, 2013 in accordance with IRC Section 501(r) and the guidance documented in the Internal Revenue Bulletin 2011-30, Notice 2011-52 and the proposed regulations issued April 5, 2013. The CHNA process began in August 2012 and concluded in May 2013. The Board of Directors that govern AKMC approved an implementation strategy designed to address the community health needs identified in the CHNA on September 23, 2013. The CHNA process included input from persons representing the broad interests of the community including individuals with special knowledge of or expertise in public health, organizations with information relevant to the health needs of the community and representatives of medically underserved populations. To achieve this end, the Hospital included representatives of the following organizations in the conduct of the CHNA: West Penn Allegheny Health System; Highmark, Inc.; Allegheny-Kiski Health Foundation; Family Services of Western Pennsylvania; Allegheny Valley Association of Churches; Citizens General Hospital Foundation; Tri-City Life Center, Inc.; Citizens Family Health Clinic; and Community Health Clinic, Inc. The results of the CHNA identified multiple health needs in the communities we serve. The Hospital addressed the following health needs: diabetes, colorectal cancer and breast cancer. The CHNA identified the following health needs the Hospital chose not to address: high blood pressure/hypertension, cardiovascular disease and obesity. We did not specifically address these because either (1) the health need was considered to be a co-morbidity to a condition we chose to focus on, such as blood pressure/hypertension and obesity could be positively impacted as part of an effective diabetes management program or (2) a strong program already exists within the hospital, as is the case with cardiovascular disease. Alle-Kiski Medical Center is in the process of executing the above mentioned implementation strategy. The Hospital has made the CHNA widely available to the public.

THE CSP DEFINES THE MISSION OF THE CONTINUUM OF CARE, ITS POPULATION AND THE PROGRAMS THAT ADDRESS THE HEALTH CARE NEEDS OF ITS COMMUNITIES. THIS CSP ADDRESSES THE PUBLIC HEALTH PRIORITIES THAT WERE IDENTIFIED BY SUFFOLK COUNTY COMMISSIONER, DR. JAMES TOMARKEN. THE TWO HEALTH PRIORITIES THAT WERE CHOSEN FOR THE PURPOSES OF THIS CSP ARE OBESITY AND CHRONIC DISEASE MANAGEMENT. THE MAIN FOCUS OF THE CSP IS TO PROMOTE ACCESS TO QUALITY HEALTH CARE AND ELIMINATE ANY HEALTH DISPARITIES WITHIN THE COMMUNITY. A FULL PLAN IS SUBMITTED TO THE NEW YORK STATE DEPARTMENT OF HEALTH EVERY THREE YEARS.MISSIONSINCE 1951, PECONIC BAY MEDICAL CENTER (PBMC) AND NOW THE PBMC HEALTH CONTINUUM OF CARE HAVE PROVIDED EXCELLENT AND COMPASSIONATE HEALTH CARE TO THE COMMUNITIES ON LONG ISLAND'S EAST END.PBMC'S REPUTATION IN THE COMMUNITY IS BASED ON THE QUALITY OF ITS HEALTH CARE SERVICES AND ITS EXPERIENCED CLINICAL STAFF.

THIS MISSION IS EMBODIED IN OUR VISION: ""TO BE THE HEALTHCARE PROVIDER OF CHOICE FOR OUR COMMUNITIES.""SERVICE AREA PBMC HEALTH SERVES ALL OF SUFFOLK COUNTY, INCLUDING THE NORTH AND SOUTH FORKS TO ORIENT POINT AND MONTAUK. PBMC HEALTH PRIMARY AND SECONDARY SERVICE AREAS CONSIST OF FOUR TOWNS, LOCATED ON THE EASTERN END OF LONG ISLAND. DEMOGRAPHICS WERE DETERMINED USING THE 2011 AMERICAN COMMUNITY SURVEY (ACS), WHICH IS CONDUCTED BY THE UNITED STATES CENSUS BUREAU. THE TOWN OF RIVERHEAD IS PBMC HEALTH'S PRIMARY SERVICE AREA AND CONSISTS OF 33,401 INDIVIDUALS. THE TOWN OF BROOKHAVEN, LOCATED IN CENTRAL SUFFOLK COUNTY, HAS A POPULATION OF 485,854 INDIVIDUALS AND ALSO HAS AREAS CONSISTING OF PBMC HEALTH'S PRIMARY SERVICE AREA. THE TOWN OF SOUTHAMPTON, LOCATED ON THE SOUTH FORK OF SUFFOLK COUNTY, HAS A POPULATION OF 56,826 INDIVIDUALS. THE FOURTH SERVICE AREA IS THE TOWN OF SOUTHOLD, LOCATED ON THE NORTH FORK OF SUFFOLK COUNTY, WHICH CONSISTS OF 21,963 INDIVIDUALS. ACCORDING TO THE U.S CENSUS DATA, THE POPULATION IN THE TOWN OF RIVERHEAD GREW BY 21 PERCENT IN THE LAST DECADE, WHICH ACCOUNTS FOR THE LARGEST PERCENTAGE INCREASE THAN ANY OTHER TOWN IN SUFFOLK COUNTY. THE BIGGEST INCREASE IN POPULATION WITHIN THE TOWN OF RIVERHEAD WAS IN THE HISPANIC POPULATION. THE HISPANIC POPULATION GREW BY 77 PERCENT IN THE LAST DECADE AND ACCOUNTS FOR 14 PERCENT OF THE TOWN'S POPULATION. THE BIGGEST INCREASE IN ACTUAL POPULATION ALSO OCCURRED WITHIN ONE OF PBMC HEALTH'S SERVICE AREAS, THE TOWN OF BROOKHAVEN. THESE FIGURES ARE VERY IMPORTANT IN ORDER TO MAINTAIN AND IMPROVE A HEALTH CARE SYSTEM THAT SATISFIES THE NEEDS ALL THOSE IN THE COMMUNITY. PBMC HEALTH HAS TAKEN INTO ACCOUNT THESE FIGURES WHEN PLANNING STRATEGIES TO REDUCE HEALTH PROBLEMS AMONG OUR TARGET POPULATION. OUR PRIMARY SERVICE AREA CONTINUES TO HAVE A SIGNIFICANTLY HIGHER PERCENTAGE OF ELDERLY THAN THE AVERAGE OF SUFFOLK COUNTY, NASSAU COUNTY AND NEW YORK STATE. SIMILARLY TO THE LAST CSP, APPROXIMATELY ONE IN FIVE RESIDENTS OF PBMC HEALTH'S SERVICE AREA ARE OVER THE AGE OF FIFTY-FIVE (55). THIS STATISTICS REMAINS OF SIGNIFICANT IMPORTANCE BECAUSE THE ELDERLY TEND TO HAVE A HIGHER NEED FOR HEALTH CARE SERVICES THAN THE YOUNGER POPULATION. WHEN COMPARED TO THE REST OF NEW YORK STATE, THE TOWN OF RIVERHEAD AND SURROUNDING SERVICE AREAS DIFFER IN THE PERCENTAGE OF INDIVIDUALS WORKING IN SPECIFIC OCCUPATIONS. EASTERN LONG ISLAND HAS A HIGHER PERCENTAGE OF WORKERS IN NATURAL RESOURCES, CONSTRUCTION, AND MAINTENANCE; AGRICULTURE, FORESTRY, FISHING AND HUNTING, AND MINING; CONSTRUCTION; RETAIL TRADE; ARTS; ENTERTAINING, RECREATIONS, AND ACCOMMODATION; AND PUBLIC ADMINISTRATION. THIS DATA REMAINS OF IMPORTANCE BECAUSE OCCUPATIONS TEND TO HAVE AN EFFECT ON AN INDIVIDUAL'S PHYSICAL AND MENTAL HEALTH. IN ADDITION, SOME JOBS, SUCH ARE AGRICULTURE AND ARTS, ARE LESS LIKELY TO OFFER HEALTH INSURANCE BENEFITS THAN OTHER JOBS. THE TOWN OF RIVERHEAD HAS A HIGHER PERCENTAGE OF INDIVIDUALS WITHOUT HEALTH INSURANCE WHO WERE FOREIGN BORN (48.6%) THAN THE NEW YORK STATE AVERAGE (23.8%). PBMC IS AWARE THAT CULTURAL FACTORS MAY PLAY A ROLE IN THE LACK OF FOREIGN BORN CITIZENS AND IMMIGRANTS WITHOUT HEALTH INSURANCE. WHEN NOT ADDRESSED, LACK OF HEALTH INSURANCE CAN ULTIMATELY HAVE A BURDEN ON PBMC AND THE COUNTY. PBMC IS CONTINUALLY WORKING TO INCREASE ACCESS TO HEALTHCARE FOR INDIVIDUALS THAT DO NOT REAP THE SAME BENEFITS AS OTHERS WITHIN THE COMMUNITY. HERE AT PBMC WE EMPHASIZE THE IMPORTANCE OF CULTURAL COMPETENCE IN AN EFFORT TO CREATE AFFORDABLE AND ACCESSIBLE HEALTH CARE TO ALL INDIVIDUALS WITHIN THE COMMUNITY.ASSESSMENT OF PUBLIC HEALTH PRIORITIESTHE PREVENTION AGENDA 2013-2017 IS THE BLUEPRINT FOR IMPROVING THE HEALTH OF THE COMMUNITIES THAT WE SERVE. OF THE FIVE PRIORITY AREAS THAT THE NEW YORK STATE DEPARTMENT OF HEALTH HAS CHOSEN, PBMC HEALTH HAS SELECTED TWO PRIORITY AREAS OF NEED TO FOCUS ON. PBMC HEALTH WAS AN ACTIVE PARTICIPANT IN THE COLLABORATIVE PLANNING PROCESS WITH THE SUFFOLK COUNTY DEPARTMENT OF HEALTH AND COMMUNITY PARTNERS TO ASSESS COMMUNITY HEALTH NEEDS, IDENTIFY HEALTH PRIORITIES AND DEVELOP PUBLIC HEALTH PROGRAMS TO MEET THE IDENTIFIED NEEDS.

MOREOVER, NASSAU AND SUFFOLK COUNTIES SUFFER FROM SOME OF THE HIGHEST MORTALITY RATES FROM HEART DISEASE IN NEW YORK STATE.REDUCING INCIDENCE OF UNINTENTIONAL INJURIES WAS SELECTED AS A PRIORITY GIVEN THE FACT THAT SUFFOLK COUNTY HAS A RELATIVELY HIGH MORTALITY RATE FOR UNINTENTIONAL INJURIES WHEN COMPARED TO NEW YORK STATE AND NATIONALLY.

IN ADDITION, IT PROVIDES EDUCATIONAL OPPORTUNITIES TO THE COMMUNITY THROUGH HEALTH FAIRS, AND PUBLIC EVENTS, AS WELL AS PUBLIC SCHOOLS, HEALTH CLINICS, SENIOR CENTERS, AND COMMUNITY HOSPITAL FORUMS. WE REACH OUT TO UNDERSERVED AND ETHNICALLY DIVERSE POPULATIONS AND SEEK TO SERVE AND COLLABORATE WITH THE ABOVE MENTIONED ORGANIZATIONS TO ENGAGE COMMUNITIES AROUND MAJOR HEALTH ISSUES. IN 2014, THE HOSPITAL SPONSORED VARIOUS COMMUNITY EDUCATION, SUPPORT AND OUTREACH PROGRAMS INCLUDING THE OSTEOARTHRITIS WELLNESS INITIATIVE, OSTEOPOROSIS WELLNESS INITIATIVE, LEON ROOT, MD PEDIATRIC OUTREACH PROGRAM, HSS ASIAN COMMUNITY BONE HEALTH INITIATIVE, GREENBERG ACADEMY FOR SUCCESSFUL AGING, SNEAKER (SUPER NUTRITION FOR ALL KIDS TO EAT RIGHT), LUPUSLINE, LANTERN (LUPUS ASIAN NETWORK) THE SLE WORKSHOP, EARLY RHEUMATOID ARTHRITIS (RA) AND LIVING WITH RA SUPPORT AND EDUCATION GROUPS, VOICES 60+ SENIOR ADVOCACY PROGRAM, THE MYOSITIS SUPPORT AND EDUCATION GROUP, CHARLA DE LUPUS/LUPUS CHAT, VOICES MEDICAID MANAGED CARE EDUCATION PROGRAM AND THE NURSING OUTREACH EDUCATION INITIATIVE. A COMMITTEE OF THE BOARD FOCUSING ON THE HOSPITAL'S COMMUNITY BENEFIT ACTIVITIES AND COMMUNITY SERVICES continues to provide oversight on HSS community education, outreach and support programs. IN ADDITION, THE HOSPITAL continues to implement community programming based on the results of the 2013 HSS CHNA. THE HSS Public & Patient Education Department STAFF DELIVERED AN ORAL PRESENTATION on the impact of their exercise programs ON THE COMMUNITY AT THE ANNUAL AMERICAN PUBLIC HEALTH ASSOCIATION'S NATIONAL CONFERENCE. The Social Work Programs' Department was invited to give a podium presentation at the Annual Scientific Meeting of the American College of Rheumatology on the development and implementation of a program evaluation with patient identified outcomes for its Early RA program. This was part of the dissemination of the activities and impact of HSS' Community Service Plan. THE HOSPITAL ALSO PARTICIPATED IN AND CO-SPONSORED NUMEROUS COMMUNITY-BASED EVENTS, INCLUDING THOSE WITH THE ARTHRITIS FOUNDATION NORTH EAST REGION AND THE NEW YORK CHAPTER, THE SLE LUPUS FOUNDATION, THE ALLIANCE FOR LUPUS RESEARCH'S NYC LUPUS WALK, Planned Parenthood of NYC, the Asian Health and Social Service Council, and the East Side Council on Aging.

THE HOSPITAL HAD OVER 30,000 CONTACTS WITH PATIENTS/PROGRAM PARTICIPANTS THROUGH NEARLY 700 PROGRAMS AND DISTRIBUTED HEALTH EDUCATION MATERIALS TO NEARLY 345,000 INDIVIDUALS (WHICH INCLUDES OVER 300,000 WEB PAGE VIEWS). THE HOSPITAL IS ALSO PART OF A NATIONAL CLINICAL RESEARCH TRANSLATIONAL CONSORTIUM WHOSE GOAL IS TO ASSESS AND IMPLEMENT THE NEEDS OF UNDERSERVED POPULATIONS IN ORDER TO DEVELOP HEALTH PROGRAMS TO DIVERSE CULTURAL COMMUNITIES IN THE NEW YORK CITY FIVE BOROUGHS. WE ARE ALSO MEMBERS OF NIAMS' NATIONAL MULTICULTURAL OUTREACH INITIATIVE TO REDUCE HEALTH DISPARITIES, THROUGH RELEVANT PUBLIC HEALTH EDUCATIONAL INITIATIVES. In 2014, THE HOSPITAL CREATED A NEW POSITION: ASSISTANT DIRECTOR FOR COMMUNITY ENGAGEMENT, DIVERSITY AND RESEARCH, TO FURTHER ENHANCE RESOURCES AND ITS COMMITMENT TO ADDRESSING HEALTH DISPARITIES AND HEALTH EQUITY, WHILE ENGAGING THE COMMUNITY AND GROUNDING INTERVENTIONS IN EVIDENCE BASED RESEARCH AND PRACTICE.

THE AMOUNT REFLECTED ON SCHEDULE H, PART III, LINE 2 WAS ARRIVED AT BY APPLYING THE ORGANIZATION'S COST TO CHARGE RATIO TO ITS TOTAL BAD DEBT EXPENSE. The organization prepares and issues audited financial statements. The attached text was obtained from the footnotes to the audited financial statements of the organization. Uncompensated care CAPE REGIONAL MEDICAL CENTER provides charity care to patients who meet certain financial criteria established by the State of New Jersey. The direct and indirect cost of services and supplies furnished to patients eligible for such charity care, using a ratio of cost to gross charges, approximated $3,564,000 and $6,590,000 for the years ended December 31, 2014 and 2013, respectively. Gross charges forgone related to charity care services amounted to approximately $18,314,000 and $30,938,000 for the years ended December 31, 2014 and 2013, respectively. The Medical Center's patient acceptance policy is based on its mission statement and its charitable purposes. Accordingly, the Medical Center accepts all patients regardless of their ability to pay. This policy results in the assumption of higher-than-normal patient accounts receivable credit risks. To the extent the Medical Center realizes additional losses resulting from such higher credit risk for patients that are not identified or do not meet the previously described charity definition, such additional losses are included in the provision for bad debts. Additionally, the Medical Center sponsors certain other charitable programs, which provide substantial benefit to the broader community. Such programs include services to needy and elderly populations that require special support, as well as health promotion and education for the general community welfare. The Health Care Reform Act of 1992, Chapter 160, established the Health Care Subsidy Fund to provide a mechanism and funding source to compensate hospitals for charity care. The Medical Center received approximately $1,399,000 and $1,362,000 for charity care, which is included in net patient service revenue for the years ended December 31, 2014 and 2013, respectively. The Health Care Subsidy Fund amounts are subject to change from year to year based on available state budget amounts and allocation methodologies."
201523119349300002,210662542,"SCHEDULE H, PART III, LINE 8","MEDICARE COSTS WERE DERIVED FROM THE 2014 MEDICARE COST REPORT. MEDICARE UNDERPAYMENTS AND BAD DEBT ARE COMMUNITY BENEFIT AND ASSOCIATED COSTS ARE INCLUDABLE ON THE FORM 990, SCHEDULE H, PART I. THE ORGANIZATION BELIEVES THAT MEDICARE UNDERPAYMENTS (SHORTFALL) AND BAD DEBT ARE COMMUNITY BENEFIT AND ASSOCIATED COSTS ARE INCLUDABLE ON THE FORM 990, SCHEDULE H, PART I. AS OUTLINED MORE FULLY BELOW, THE ORGANIZATION BELIEVES THAT THESE SERVICES AND RELATED COSTS PROMOTE THE HEALTH OF THE COMMUNITY AS A WHOLE AND ARE RENDERED IN CONJUNCTION WITH THE ORGANIZATION'S CHARITABLE TAX-EXEMPT PURPOSES AND MISSION IN PROVIDING MEDICALLY NECESSARY HEALTHCARE SERVICES TO ALL INDIVIDUALS IN A NON-DISCRIMINATORY MANNER WITHOUT REGARD TO RACE, COLOR, CREED, SEX, NATIONAL ORIGIN, RELIGION OR ABILITY TO PAY AND CONSISTENT WITH THE COMMUNITY BENEFIT STANDARD PROMULGATED BY THE INTERNAL REVENUE SERVICE (""IRS""). THE COMMUNITY BENEFIT STANDARD IS THE CURRENT STANDARD FOR A HOSPITAL FOR RECOGNITION AS A TAX-EXEMPT AND CHARITABLE ORGANIZATION UNDER INTERNAL REVENUE CODE (""IRC"") 501(C)(3). THE ORGANIZATION IS RECOGNIZED AS A TAX-EXEMPT ENTITY AND CHARITABLE ORGANIZATION UNDER 501(C)(3) OF THE IRC. ALTHOUGH THERE IS NO DEFINITION IN THE TAX CODE FOR THE TERM ""CHARITABLE"" A REGULATION PROMULGATED BY THE DEPARTMENT OF THE TREASURY PROVIDES SOME GUIDANCE AND STATES THAT ""THE TERM CHARITABLE IS USED IN 501(C)(3) IN ITS GENERALLY ACCEPTED LEGAL SENSE,"" AND PROVIDES EXAMPLES OF CHARITABLE PURPOSES, INCLUDING THE RELIEF OF THE POOR OR UNPRIVILEGED; THE PROMOTION OF SOCIAL WELFARE; AND THE ADVANCEMENT OF EDUCATION, RELIGION, AND SCIENCE. NOTE IT DOES NOT EXPLICITLY ADDRESS THE ACTIVITIES OF HOSPITALS. IN THE ABSENCE OF EXPLICIT STATUTORY OR REGULATORY REQUIREMENTS APPLYING THE TERM ""CHARITABLE"" TO HOSPITALS, IT HAS BEEN LEFT TO THE IRS TO DETERMINE THE CRITERIA HOSPITALS MUST MEET TO QUALIFY AS IRC 501(C)(3) CHARITABLE ORGANIZATIONS. THE ORIGINAL STANDARD WAS KNOWN AS THE CHARITY CARE STANDARD. THIS STANDARD WAS REPLACED BY THE IRS WITH THE COMMUNITY BENEFIT STANDARD WHICH IS THE CURRENT STANDARD. CHARITY CARE STANDARD IN 1956, THE IRS ISSUED REVENUE RULING 56-185, WHICH ADDRESSED THE REQUIREMENTS HOSPITALS NEEDED TO MEET IN ORDER TO QUALIFY FOR IRC 501(C)(3) STATUS. ONE OF THESE REQUIREMENTS IS KNOWN AS THE ""CHARITY CARE STANDARD."" UNDER THE STANDARD, A HOSPITAL HAD TO PROVIDE, TO THE EXTENT OF ITS FINANCIAL ABILITY, FREE OR REDUCED-COST CARE TO PATIENTS UNABLE TO PAY FOR IT. A HOSPITAL THAT EXPECTED FULL PAYMENT DID NOT, ACCORDING TO THE RULING, PROVIDE CHARITY CARE BASED ON THE FACT THAT SOME PATIENTS ULTIMATELY FAILED TO PAY. THE RULING EMPHASIZED THAT A LOW LEVEL OF CHARITY CARE DID NOT NECESSARILY MEAN THAT A HOSPITAL HAD FAILED TO MEET THE REQUIREMENT SINCE THAT LEVEL COULD REFLECT ITS FINANCIAL ABILITY TO PROVIDE SUCH CARE. THE RULING ALSO NOTED THAT PUBLICLY SUPPORTED COMMUNITY HOSPITALS WOULD NORMALLY QUALIFY AS CHARITABLE ORGANIZATIONS BECAUSE THEY SERVE THE ENTIRE COMMUNITY, AND A LOW LEVEL OF CHARITY CARE WOULD NOT AFFECT A HOSPITAL'S EXEMPT STATUS IF IT WAS DUE TO THE SURROUNDING COMMUNITY'S LACK OF CHARITABLE DEMANDS. COMMUNITY BENEFIT STANDARD IN 1969, THE IRS ISSUED REVENUE RULING 69-545, WHICH ""REMOVED"" FROM REVENUE RULING 56-185 ""THE REQUIREMENTS RELATING TO CARING FOR PATIENTS WITHOUT CHARGE OR AT RATES BELOW COST."" UNDER THE STANDARD DEVELOPED IN REVENUE RULING 69-545, WHICH IS KNOWN AS THE ""COMMUNITY BENEFIT STANDARD,"" HOSPITALS ARE JUDGED ON WHETHER THEY PROMOTE THE HEALTH OF A BROAD CLASS OF INDIVIDUALS IN THE COMMUNITY. THE RULING INVOLVED A HOSPITAL THAT ONLY ADMITTED INDIVIDUALS WHO COULD PAY FOR THE SERVICES (BY THEMSELVES, PRIVATE INSURANCE, OR PUBLIC PROGRAMS SUCH AS MEDICARE), BUT OPERATED A FULL-TIME EMERGENCY ROOM THAT WAS OPEN TO EVERYONE. THE IRS RULED THAT THE HOSPITAL QUALIFIED AS A CHARITABLE ORGANIZATION BECAUSE IT PROMOTED THE HEALTH OF PEOPLE IN ITS COMMUNITY. THE IRS REASONED THAT BECAUSE THE PROMOTION OF HEALTH WAS A CHARITABLE PURPOSE ACCORDING TO THE GENERAL LAW OF CHARITY, IT FELL WITHIN THE ""GENERALLY ACCEPTED LEGAL SENSE"" OF THE TERM ""CHARITABLE,"" AS REQUIRED BY TREAS. REG. 1.501(C)(3)-1(D)(2). THE IRS RULING STATED THAT THE PROMOTION OF HEALTH, LIKE THE RELIEF OF POVERTY AND THE ADVANCEMENT OF EDUCATION AND RELIGION, IS ONE OF THE PURPOSES IN THE GENERAL LAW OF CHARITY THAT IS DEEMED BENEFICIAL TO THE COMMUNITY AS A WHOLE EVEN THOUGH THE CLASS OF BENEFICIARIES ELIGIBLE TO RECEIVE A DIRECT BENEFIT FROM ITS ACTIVITIES DOES NOT INCLUDE ALL MEMBERS OF THE COMMUNITY, SUCH AS INDIGENT MEMBERS OF THE COMMUNITY, PROVIDED THAT THE CLASS IS NOT SO SMALL THAT ITS RELIEF IS NOT OF BENEFIT TO THE COMMUNITY. THE IRS CONCLUDED THAT THE HOSPITAL WAS ""PROMOTING THE HEALTH OF A CLASS OF PERSONS THAT IS BROAD ENOUGH TO BENEFIT THE COMMUNITY"" BECAUSE ITS EMERGENCY DEPARTMENT WAS OPEN TO ALL AND IT PROVIDED CARE TO EVERYONE WHO COULD PAY, WHETHER DIRECTLY OR THROUGH THIRD-PARTY REIMBURSEMENT. OTHER CHARACTERISTICS OF THE HOSPITAL THAT THE IRS HIGHLIGHTED INCLUDED THE FOLLOWING: IT WAS CONTROLLED BY A BOARD OF TRUSTEES THAT CONSISTED OF INDEPENDENT CIVIC LEADERS; HOSPITAL MEDICAL STAFF PRIVILEGES WERE AVAILABLE TO ALL QUALIFIED PHYSICIANS; AND SURPLUS FUNDS ARE USED TO IMPROVE THE QUALITY OF PATIENT CARE, EXPAND AND RENOVATE HOSPITAL FACILITIES AND ADVANCE MEDICAL CARE, TRAINING, EDUCATION, RESEARCH, PROGRAMS AND ACTIVITIES. MEDICARE UNDERPAYMENTS AND BAD DEBT ARE COMMUNITY BENEFIT AND ASSOCIATED COSTS ARE INCLUDABLE ON THE FORM 990, SCHEDULE H, PART I. THE AMERICAN HOSPITAL ASSOCIATION (""AHA"") BELIEVES THAT MEDICARE UNDERPAYMENTS (SHORTFALL) AND BAD DEBT ARE COMMUNITY BENEFIT AND THUS INCLUDABLE ON THE FORM 990, SCHEDULE H, PART I. THIS ORGANIZATION AGREES WITH THE AHA POSITION. AS OUTLINED IN THE AHA LETTER TO THE IRS DATED AUGUST 21, 2007 WITH RESPECT TO THE FIRST PUBLISHED DRAFT OF THE NEW FORM 990 AND SCHEDULE H, THE AHA FELT THAT THE IRS SHOULD INCORPORATE THE FULL VALUE OF THE COMMUNITY BENEFIT THAT HOSPITALS PROVIDE BY COUNTING MEDICARE UNDERPAYMENTS (SHORTFALL) AS QUANTIFIABLE COMMUNITY BENEFIT FOR THE FOLLOWING REASONS: - PROVIDING CARE FOR THE ELDERLY AND SERVING MEDICARE PATIENTS IS AN ESSENTIAL PART OF THE COMMUNITY BENEFIT STANDARD. - MEDICARE, LIKE MEDICAID, DOES NOT PAY THE FULL COST OF CARE. RECENTLY, MEDICARE REIMBURSES HOSPITALS ONLY 88 CENTS FOR EVERY DOLLAR THEY SPEND TO TAKE CARE OF MEDICARE PATIENTS. THE MEDICARE PAYMENT ADVISORY COMMISSION (""MEDPAC"") IN ITS MARCH 2015 REPORT TO CONGRESS NOTED THAT AVERAGE MEDICARE MARGINS CONTINUE TO BE NEGATIVE, AND UNDER CURRENT LAW THEY ARE EXPECTED TO DECLINE IN 2015. - MANY MEDICARE BENEFICIARIES, LIKE THEIR MEDICAID COUNTERPARTS, ARE POOR. MORE THAN 46 PERCENT OF MEDICARE SPENDING IS FOR BENEFICIARIES WHOSE INCOME IS BELOW 200 PERCENT OF THE FEDERAL POVERTY LEVEL. MANY OF THOSE MEDICARE BENEFICIARIES ARE ALSO ELIGIBLE FOR MEDICAID -- SO CALLED ""DUAL ELIGIBLES."" THERE IS EVERY COMPELLING PUBLIC POLICY REASON TO TREAT MEDICARE AND MEDICAID UNDERPAYMENTS SIMILARLY FOR PURPOSES OF A HOSPITAL'S COMMUNITY BENEFIT AND INCLUDE THESE COSTS ON FORM 990, SCHEDULE H, PART I. MEDICARE UNDERPAYMENT MUST BE SHOULDERED BY THE HOSPITAL IN ORDER TO CONTINUE TREATING THE COMMUNITY'S ELDERLY AND POOR. THESE UNDERPAYMENTS REPRESENT A REAL COST OF SERVING THE COMMUNITY AND SHOULD COUNT AS A QUANTIFIABLE COMMUNITY BENEFIT. BOTH THE AHA AND THIS ORGANIZATION ALSO BELIEVE THAT PATIENT BAD DEBT IS A COMMUNITY BENEFIT AND THUS INCLUDABLE ON THE FORM 990, SCHEDULE H, PART I. LIKE MEDICARE UNDERPAYMENT (SHORTFALLS), THERE ALSO ARE COMPELLING REASONS THAT PATIENT BAD DEBT SHOULD BE COUNTED AS QUANTIFIABLE COMMUNITY BENEFIT AS FOLLOWS: - A SIGNIFICANT MAJORITY OF BAD DEBT IS ATTRIBUTABLE TO LOW-INCOME PATIENTS, WHO, FOR MANY REASONS, DECLINE TO COMPLETE THE FORMS REQUIRED TO ESTABLISH ELIGIBILITY FOR HOSPITALS' CHARITY CARE OR FINANCIAL ASSISTANCE PROGRAMS. A 2006 CONGRESSIONAL BUDGET OFFICE (""CBO"") REPORT, NONPROFIT HOSPITALS AND THE PROVISION OF COMMUNITY BENEFITS, CITED TWO STUDIES INDICATING THAT ""THE GREAT MAJORITY OF BAD DEBT WAS ATTRIBUTABLE TO PATIENTS WITH INCOMES BELOW 200% OF THE FEDERAL POVERTY LINE."" - THE REPORT ALSO NOTED THAT A SUBSTANTIAL PORTION OF BAD DEBT IS PENDING CHARITY CARE. UNLIKE BAD DEBT IN OTHER INDUSTRIES, HOSPITAL BAD DEBT IS COMPLICATED BY THE FACT THAT HOSPITALS FOLLOW THEIR MISSION TO THE COMMUNITY AND TREAT EVERY PATIENT THAT COMES THROUGH THEIR EMERGENCY DEPARTMENT, REGARDLESS OF ABILITY TO PAY. PATIENTS WHO HAVE OUTSTANDING BILLS ARE NOT TURNED AWAY, UNLIKE OTHER INDUSTRIES. BAD DEBT IS FURTHER COMPLICATED BY THE AUDITING INDUSTRY'S STANDARDS ON REPORTING CHARITY CARE. MANY PATIENTS CANNOT OR DO NOT PROVIDE THE NECESSARY, EXTENSIVE DOCUMENTATION REQUIRED TO BE DEEMED CHARITY CARE BY AUDITORS. AS A RESULT, ROUGHLY 40% OF BAD DEBT IS PENDING CHARITY CARE. - THE CBO CONCLUDED THAT ITS FINDINGS ""SUPPORT THE VALIDITY OF THE USE OF UNCOMPENSATED CARE [BAD DEBT AND CHARITY CA"

The organization's allowance for doubtful accounts (bad debt expense) methodology and charity care policies are consistently applied. Below please find detailed information: Receivables for Patient Care ---------------------------- Patient accounts receivable for which the Hospital receives payment under cost reimbursement, prospective payment formulae or negotiated rates, which cover the majority of patient services, are stated at the estimated net amounts receivable from payors, which are generally less than the established billing rates of the Hospital. Patient accounts receivable are reported net of provisions based on management's assessment of historical and expected collections, business economic conditions, trends in healthcare coverage, and other collection indicators. For receivables associated with services provided to patients who have third-party coverage (which includes patients with deductible and co-payment balances due for which third-party coverage exists for part of the bill), the Hospital analyzes contractually due amounts and provides an allowance for doubtful accounts, if necessary. The difference between the billed rates and the amounts actually collected after all reasonable collection efforts have been exhausted is charged off against net patient service revenue. The Hospital has not changed its financial assistance policy in 2014 or 2013. Charity Care ------------ IMC's patient acceptance policy is based on its mission statement and its charitable purposes. Accordingly, IMC accepts all patients regardless of their ability to pay. A patient is classified by IMC as a charity patient by reference to certain financial criteria established by the State of New Jersey and IMC's policy. IMC's charity care policy includes additional financial criteria which were established with the intent of expanding the availability of financial assistance. Because IMC does not believe that accounts which qualify for charity care are likely to be collected, they are not reported as net patient service revenue. The unreimbursed cost for services and supplies furnished to patients eligible for such charity care are determined through the use of cost to charge ratios in effect for IMC, and are as follows: 2014 2013 In accordance with the State of New Jersey's criteria: $ 10,156,000 $ 16,930,000 IMC's additional criteria $ 4,395,000 $ 19,035,000 ------------ ------------ Total $ 14,551,000 $ 35,965,000 ============ ============ IMC also sponsors certain other charitable programs, which provide substantial benefit to the broader community. Such programs include services to needy and elderly populations that require special support, as well as health promotion and education for the general community welfare. In addition, all other uncollectible amounts resulting from the patients' inability to pay, are recorded as a reduction to net patient service revenue, consistent with IMC's charity care policy."
201533209349313018,210634484,"SCHEDULE H, PART III, SECTION B; QUESTION 8","Medicare costs were derived from the 2014 Medicare cost Report. Medicare underpayments and bad debt are community benefit and associated costs are includable on the form 990, Schedule H, Part I. The organization feels that Medicare underpayments (shortfall), bad debt and associated costs are community benefit and are includable on the form 990, Schedule H, Part I. As outlined more fully below, the organization believes that these services and related costs promote the health of the community as a whole and are rendered in conjunction with the organization's charitable tax-exempt purposes and mission in providing medically necessary healthcare services to all individuals in a non-discriminatory manner without regard to race, color, creed, sex, national origin, religion or ability to pay and consistent with the Community Benefit Standard promulgated by the IRS. The Community Benefit Standard is the current standard for a hospital for recognition as a tax-exempt and charitable organization under internal revenue code (""IRC"") 501(c)(3). The organization is recognized as a tax-exempt entity and charitable organization under 501(c)(3) of the IRC. Although there is no definition in the tax code for the term ""charitable"" a regulation promulgated by the Department of the Treasury provides some guidance and states that ""the term charitable is used in Section 501(c)(3) in its generally accepted legal sense,"" and provides examples of charitable purposes, including the relief of the poor or unprivileged; the promotion of social welfare; and the advancement of education, religion, and science. Note it does not explicitly address the activities of hospitals. In the absence of explicit statutory or regulatory requirements applying the term ""charitable"" to hospitals, it has been left to the IRS to determine the criteria hospitals must meet to qualify as IRC 501(c)(3) charitable organizations. The original standard was known as the Charity Care Standard. This standard was replaced by the IRS with the Community Benefit Standard which is the current standard. Charity Care Standard In 1956, the IRS issued Revenue Ruling 56-185, which addressed the requirements hospitals needed to meet in order to qualify for IRC 501(c)(3) status. One of these requirements is known as the ""Charity Care Standard."" Under the standard, a hospital must provide, to the extent of its financial ability, free or reduced-cost care to patients who cannot pay for such services. A hospital that expected full payment did not, according to the ruling, provide charity care based on the fact that some patients ultimately failed to pay. The ruling emphasized that a low level of charity care did not necessarily mean that a hospital had failed to meet the requirement since that level could reflect its financial ability to provide such care. The ruling also noted that publicly supported community hospitals would normally qualify as charitable organizations because they serve the entire community and a low level of charity care would not affect a hospital's exempt status if it was due to the surrounding community's lack of charitable demands. Community Benefit Standard In 1969, the IRS issued revenue ruling 69-545, which ""removed"" from revenue ruling 56-185 ""the requirements relating to caring for patients without charge or at rates below cost."" Under the standard developed in revenue ruling 69-545, which is known as the ""community benefit standard,"" hospitals are judged on whether they promote the health of a broad class of individuals in the community. The ruling involved a hospital that only admitted individuals who could pay for the services (by themselves, private insurance, or public programs such as Medicare), but operated a full-time emergency room that was open to everyone. The IRS ruled that the hospital qualified as a charitable organization because it promoted the health of people in its community. The IRS reasoned that because the promotion of health was a charitable purpose according to the general law of charity, it fell within the ""generally accepted legal sense"" of the term ""charitable,"" as required by The Department of Treasury Reg. 1.501(c)(3)-1(d)(2). The IRS ruling stated that the promotion of health, like the relief of poverty and the advancement of education and religion, is one of the purposes in the general law of charity that is deemed beneficial to the community as a whole even though the class of beneficiaries eligible to receive a direct benefit from its activities does not include all members of the community, such as indigent members of the community, provided that the class is not so small that its relief is not of benefit to the community. The IRS concluded that the hospital was ""promoting the health of a class of persons that is broad enough to benefit the community"" because its emergency room was open to all and it provided care to everyone who could pay, whether directly or through third-party reimbursement. Other characteristics of the hospital that the IRS highlighted included the following: its surplus funds were used to improve patient care, expand hospital facilities, and advance medical training, education and research; it was controlled by a board of trustees that consisted of independent civic leaders; and hospital medical staff privileges were available to all qualified physicians. Medicare underpayments and bad debt are community benefit and associated costs are includable on the form 990, Schedule H, Part I. The American Hospital Association (""AHA"") feels that Medicare underpayments (shortfall) and bad debt are community benefit and thus includable on the form 990, Schedule H, Part I. This organization agrees with the AHA's position. As outlined in the AHA's letter to the IRS dated August 21, 2007 with respect to the first published draft of the new Form 990 and Schedule H, the AHA felt that the IRS should incorporate the full value of the community benefit that hospitals provide by counting Medicare underpayments (shortfall) as quantifiable community benefit for the following reasons: - Providing care for the elderly and serving Medicare patients is an essential part of the community benefit standard - Medicare, like Medicaid, does not pay the full cost of care. From the latest data provided by the American Hospital Association, as of 2012, Medicare reimburses hospitals only 86 cents for every dollar they spend to take care of Medicare patients. The Medicare Payment Advisory Commission (""MEDPAC""), in its March 2013 report to congress, states that beneficiaries will grow notably faster in the next 10 years than in the past decade as the baby-boom generation ages into the program. In addition, the population aging into the Medicare program will present a new set of challenges since rising obesity levels put this population at a greater risk than previous generations for chronic disease. - Many Medicare beneficiaries, like their Medicaid counterparts, are poor. More than 42 percent of Medicare spending is for beneficiaries whose income is below 200 percent of the federal poverty level. Many of those Medicare beneficiaries are also eligible for Medicaid -- so called ""dual eligible."" There is every compelling public policy reason to treat Medicare and Medicaid underpayments similarly for purposes of a hospital's community benefit and include these costs on form 990, Schedule H, Part I. Medicare underpayment must be shouldered by the hospital in order to continue treating the community's elderly and poor. These underpayments represent a real cost of serving the community and should count as a quantifiable community benefit. Both the AHA and this organization also feel that patient bad debt is a community benefit and thus includable on the form 990, Schedule H, Part I. Like Medicare underpayment (shortfalls), there also are compelling reasons that patient bad debt should be counted as quantifiable community benefit as follows: - A significant majority of bad debt is attributable to low-income patients, who, for many reasons, decline to complete the forms required to establish eligibility for hospitals' charity care or financial assistance programs. A 2006 congressional budget office (""CBO"") report, nonprofit hospitals and the provision of community benefits, cited two studies indicating that ""the great majority of bad debt was attributable to patients with incomes below 200% of the federal poverty line."" - The report also noted that a substantial portion of bad debt is pending charity care. Unlike bad debt in other industries, hospital bad debt is complicated by the fact that hospitals follow their mission to the community and treat every patient that comes through their emergency department, regardless of ability to pay. Patients who have outstanding bills are not turned away, unlike other industries. Bad debt is further complicated by the auditing industry's standards on reporting charity care. Many patients cannot or do not provide the necessar"

IMC conducts an extensive service area physician needs study (by primary and specialty) every three to five years. Specific specialty needs are conducted for identified gaps in service. These reviews inform medical staff development at the medical center to assure responsiveness to identified community needs. IMC collaborates with community partners to plan and conduct health needs assessments to assess and address health needs of the community it serves. The wide-based collaborative partnership retains an outside consulting firm to assess community data and perception. Community data is collected from county health profiles, health statistics, demographics, socioeconomic data, phone surveys, paper surveys and focus groups. From those assessments, community health improvement plans are published identifying the specific health priorities.

(""IMC"") is the only not-for-profit healthcare system located in the southwestern region of New Jersey along the Delaware Bay. It is situated in a rural and urbanized area comprised of small cities, suburbs, vast wetlands and agricultural areas. IMC is a healthcare safety net provider of general acute and ambulatory healthcare services in a regional service area that encompasses primarily Cumberland and Salem Counties and portions of Gloucester and Atlantic Counties, covering a patient base of 376,000. Cumberland County has a population of 157,745 and Salem County has a population of 66,342 according to us census 2010 estimates. The population is a multifaceted community of diverse ethnic groups and industry, predominately Caucasian with specific communities home to higher populations of Hispanic and African American residents. According to 2010 us census, Cumberland County demographics are 65% Caucasian, 20% African American, 19% Hispanic; Salem county is 85% Caucasian, 15% African American, 4% Hispanic. Cumberland County's rapidly growing Hispanic population provides much of the county's farm labor; in particular, Bridgeton experienced a 560% increase in Mexican population from 1990 to 2000. The region's economy consists of a strong agricultural base with targeted industry sectors that include healthcare, construction, hospitality/tourism, food processing, glass making, manufacturing, a nuclear generating complex, one federal penitentiary and three state correctional facilities which, combined, house over 8,000 inmates. Of 21 counties in NJ, Cumberland County has the largest percentage of residents living below the federal poverty level, the highest unemployment rate, the highest teen pregnancy rate, and the lowest percentage of population with a college degree. Major areas in Cumberland County and all of Salem County are designated medically underserved areas and health professional shortage areas. Both Salem and Cumberland County have the two highest obesity rates in the state. IMC is recognized as a center of excellence in cancer services, cardiology center of care and bariatric surgery center of excellence. Vineland and Elmer Medical Centers are state-designated primary stroke centers. IMC Behavioral Health Services is the major provider of inpatient and outpatient services for the entire southern New Jersey region spanning nine counties. Patients receiving behavioral health services are primarily insured under Medicaid and Medicare."
201533209349313018,210634484,"SCHEDULE H, PART VI; QUESTION 5","Community building activities undertaken by this organization improve the medical and socio-economic well-being of the communities in our care. This is accomplished through numerous activities which are not a part of Part I Charity Care and other community benefits, and are not included elsewhere on Schedule H. These activities include programs that address the root causes of health problems such as education, poverty, unemployment, access to care, health advocacy and economic development. Economic Development - To help address poverty and unemployment and to take an active role in the regional economy and business outlook, the hospital offers the expertise and resources of its healthcare employees as active board members and participants in community organizations such as the Bridgeton, Millville, Vineland and Salem Chambers of Commerce, Bridgeton, Elmer and Vineland Rotaries and Cumberland and Salem County Economic Forums. Community Support - IMC's efforts to enhance community support networks include both community-based and facility-based initiatives. IMPACT (Innovative Model for Preschool and Community Teaming), a collaboration between IMC and the Vineland Board of Education, provides health and social services, preschool programs and literacy programs, targeting the needs of the low income residents in Cumberland County. Impact Teen Parenting Program provides parenting classes, childcare services, prenatal care and life skills education to teen parents and second pregnancy prevention. IMPACT School Based Youth Services Program (SBYSP), offers health services, tutoring, counseling, recreation and life skills training. The IMPACT Family Outreach Program, through three Family Worker Coordinators, provide training, supervision and support to roughly 40 Family Workers in the Abbott Preschools in Vineland, Millville and Bridgeton. Family Workers serve as the liaison between the child care center, the home and community agencies. The IMPACT Child Care Program provides childcare for infants and toddlers. Inspira's Family Success Centers are a program offered by IMPACT in Commercial Township and Vineland. They are designed to enrich the lives of children by strengthening families and neighborhoods, providing integrated, locally-based services, reducing isolation and promote connections among family and community and providing services in a warm and welcoming environment. IMC plans for disaster readiness above and beyond licensure requirements, including a decontamination room, a dedicated decon team and coordination of mass casualty drills involving different disaster scenarios in the community in collaboration with all first responders to address the major security concern related to the significant prison inmate population of 8,000 during disasterS. Environmental Improvements - The organization's Going Green Recycling initiative at all facilities system-wide improves the environment and helps the community by reducing waste, increasing recycling, conserving materials and purchasing recycled products. Inspira participates in the State of NJ Safe Syringe Disposal program, a community sharps disposal program that provides community residents with a method to safely dispose of home generated sharps. IMC maintains a campus-wide smoking ban at all IMC buildings, grounds and parking lots to improve the air quality, health and well-being of everyone in the surrounding communities. Coalition Building - IMC actively partners in community coalitions aimed at addressing health and safety issues. To address Cumberland County's teen pregnancy rate, which is 3 times the NJ state average, the Teen Pregnancy Prevention Initiative was formed through a collaborative partnership with IMC, CompleteCare Health Network (CCHN) and the county freeholders. SAFE (Sexual Accountability For Everyone), is the educational component of CCHN's plan to bring nurse practitioners into county middle and high schools and expand school-based services to include comprehensive health and gynecological services, peer & adult self-esteem programs, encourage responsible sexual behavior and provide tier-based counseling to target at-risk students. To address the particularly high childhood obesity rate, STEPS for kids was initiated as a collaboration between IMC, The Cumberland Cape Atlantic YMCA and the Robert Wood Johnson Foundation targeting children 8 to 12 with a BMI level at or above the 85th percentile who are at risk for obesity. The 12-week interactive program for children and their parents focuses on balanced meal plans and simple exercise techniques that help families achieve healthier lifestyles. To improve health risks associated with heart disease in our growing population of African American and Latino residents, IMC was one of 10 hospitals in NJ chosen by the Robert Wood Johnson Foundation to participate in a two-year, statewide initiative to improve the quality of cardiac care, share and apply best practices for treating patients with heart failure and communicate strategies and lessons learned to policymakers and healthcare providers. IMC initiated an Extended Care Facilities Forum to build a positive relationship between the hospital, neighboring nursing care facilities and the community to assist each other in offering a seamless continuum of care in light of healthcare reform changes. IMC partnered with the Salem Health and Wellness Foundation to provide digital mammography to the uninsured and health underserved residents of Salem County, who would not otherwise utilize this preventive screening tool until their breast cancer was at a later stage. Community Health Improvement Advocacy - Various levels of IMC staff serve on government advisory committees and boards for national, state and local organizations to advocate for healthcare reform, bring about changes in regulatory requirements, advocate for improved access to healthcare and promote health status for both the broader community and vulnerable populations. IMC is represented at organizations such as the Advocates for Children of NJ, American Hospital Association, Cumberland Inter-Agency Council, Human Services Advisory Council, National Association for Home Care & Hospice, NJ Association of Mental Health Agencies, NJ Division of Mental Health Services, NJ Hospital Association, Salem Inter-Agency Council, Southern NJ Perinatal Cooperative and Voluntary Hospitals of America. Workforce Development - IMC is committed to recruiting experienced physicians and health professionals into our community, which is identified as a medically underserved area (MUA), to ensure that residents have access to the specialized care they need. Responding to a shortage of obstetricians, IMC recruited additional ob/gyns into a medically underserved area.

RESEARCH HAS CONTINUALLY SHOWN THAT WHEN THE FACTORS INFLUENCING HEALTH ARE EXPLORED, HEALTH CARE ACTUALLY PLAYS THE SMALLEST ROLE PROPORTIONATELY. A REPORT IN THE JOURNAL OF AMERICAN MEDICAL ASSOCIATION AND THE CENTER FOR DISEASE CONTROL (MCGINNIS, 1996) SUGGESTS THAT THE FACTORS IMPACTING HEALTH ARE AS FOLLOWS: LIFESTYLE AND BEHAVIORS, 50%, ENVIRONMENT (HUMAN AND NATURAL), 20%, GENETICS AND HUMAN BIOLOGY, 20%, AND HEALTH CARE, 10%. COMMUNITY BUILDING ACTIVITIES HELP TO ADDRESS THE OTHER INDICATORS OUTSIDE OF THE ROLE TRADITIONALLY PLAYED BY HEALTH-CARE ORGANIZATIONS. THESE ACTIVITIES ARE ALMOST EXCLUSIVELY DONE IN SOME FORM OF PARTNERSHIP IN WHICH THE COMMUNITY OR OTHER ORGANIZATIONS ARE BETTER SUITED TO ADDRESS. HEALTH-CARE ORGANIZATIONS GENERALLY PROVIDE TIMELY AND SPECIFIC RESOURCES TO HELP THESE ISSUES. HEALTH-CARE ORGANIZATIONS CAN BE A RICH AND VALUABLE COMMUNITY RESOURCE IN WAYS NOT TYPICALLY CONSIDERED. OFTEN THE MOST EFFECTIVE WAY TO HELP IMPACT AND IMPROVE THE COMMUNITY HEALTH STATUS IS TO SUPPORT OTHER AGENCIES AND ORGANIZATIONS IN A VARIETY OF WAYS OUTSIDE OF HEALTH SERVICES. THIS IS OFTEN DONE THROUGH CASH OR IN-KIND SERVICES TO SUPPORT OTHER NON-PROFITS, DONATIONS OF DURABLE MEDICAL EQUIPMENT AND SUPPLIES TO CERTAIN AGENCIES, OR THROUGH LEADERSHIP AND EDUCATIONAL EXPERTISE. THE HOSPITAL CONTRIBUTES FINANCIALLY TO A WIDE VARIETY OF COMMUNITY ORGANIZATIONS THAT ADDRESS THE BROADER NEEDS OF THE COMMUNITY. THESE DONATIONS ALLOW OTHER NON-PROFIT ORGANIZATIONS TO FULFILL THEIR MISSIONS TO IMPROVE THE WELL BEING OF THE COMMUNITY AND CONTRIBUTE TO ITS OVERALL HEALTH STATUS IN WAYS THAT MAY DIFFER FROM THE DIRECT SERVICES OF THE HOSPITAL ORGANIZATION AND MAXIMIZE THE RESOURCES THEY HAVE TO WORK WITH. THE HOSPITAL EMPLOYEES ARE ACTIVE IN EDUCATING PARTNERS ON A WIDE VARIETY OF HEALTH SUBJECTS THAT ADVANCE THEIR WORK. FURTHER, THE HOSPITAL EMPLOYEES ARE MEMBERS OF MANY NON-PROFIT BOARDS TO PROVIDE LEADERSHIP OR COLLABORATE TO ADDRESS COMPLEX HEALTH ISSUES.THESE TYPES OF ACTIVITIES SPEAK TO THE BREADTH AND CAPACITY THAT THE HOSPITAL HAS IN IMPACTING THE HEALTH STATUS OF THE COMMUNITY IN A COMPREHENSIVE AND INTENTIONAL APPROACH."

THE MEDICARE SHORTFALL REFLECTED ON SCHEDULE H, PART III, SECTION B WAS DETERMINED USING INFORMATION FROM THE ORGANIZATION'S MEDICARE COST REPORT. HOWEVER THE MEDICARE COST REPORT DISALLOWS CERTAIN ITEMS THAT WE BELIEVE ARE LEGITIMATE EXPENSES INCURRED IN THE PROCESS OF CARING FOR OUR MEDICARE PATIENTS. EXAMPLES OF THESE ITEMS INCLUDE PROVIDER BASED PHYSICIAN EXPENSE, SELF INSURANCE EXPENSE, HOME OFFICE EXPENSE AND THE SHORTFALL FROM FEE SCHEDULE PAYMENTS. THE ORGANIZATION'S COST ACCOUNTING SYSTEM CALCULATES A MEDICARE SHORTFALL OF $8,452,539. IN ADDITION TO THESE ITEMS THE MEDICARE COST REPORT AND THE COST ACCOUNTING SYSTEM DO NOT INCLUDE MEDICARE PHYSICIAN FEE SCHEDULE EXPENSE OF $6,731,416 AND REVENUE OF $7,329,542. AFTER TAKING THESE ITEMS INTO ACCOUNT WE CALCULATE AN ACTUAL MEDICARE SHORTFALL OF $7,854,413.THE HOSPITAL BELIEVES THE ENTIRE AMOUNT OF THE MEDICARE SHORTFALL SHOULD BE TREATED AS COMMUNITY BENEFIT, MORE SPECIFICALLY, AS CHARITY CARE. THE ELDERLY CONSTITUTE A CLEARLY-RECOGNIZED CHARITABLE CLASS, AND MANY MEDICARE BENEFICIARIES, LIKE THEIR MEDICAID COUNTERPARTS, ARE POOR AND THUS WOULD HAVE QUALIFIED FOR THE HOSPITAL'S CHARITY CARE PROGRAM, MEDICAID OR OTHER NEEDS-BASED GOVERNMENT PROGRAMS ABSENT THE MEDICARE PROGRAM. BY ACCEPTING PAYMENT BELOW COST TO TREAT THESE INDIVIDUALS, THE BURDENS OF GOVERNMENT ARE RELIEVED WITH RESPECT TO THESE INDIVIDUALS.

201533179349302008,226019101,"PART III, LINE 8","Medicare costs were derived from the 2012 Medicare cost report. The organization's position is that Medicare underpayments and bad debt are community benefits and associated costs should be includable on Form 990, Schedule H, Part I as outlined more fully below. The organization believes that these services and related costs promote health of the community as a whole and are rendered in conjunction with the organization's charitable tax-exempt purpose and mission in providing medically necessary healthcare services to all individuals in a non-discriminatory manner without regard to race, color, creed, sex, national origin, religion or ability to pay and consistent with the Community Benefit Standard promulgated by the IRS. The Community Benefit Standard is the current standard for a hospital for recognition as a tax-exempt and charitable organization under the Internal Revenue Code (IRC) 501(c)(3). The organization is recognized as a tax-exempt and charitable organization under the Internal Revenue Code (IRC) 501(c)(3). Although there is no definition in the tax code for the term ""charitable"", a regulation promulgated by the Department of the Treasury provides some guidance and states that the term charitable is used in section 501(c)(3) in its generally accepted legal sense, and provides examples of charitable purposes, including the relief of the poor or underprivileged, the promotion of social welfare, and the advancement of education and science. Note, it does not explicitly address the activities of hospitals in the absence of explicit statutory or regulatory requirements applying the term ""charitable"" to hospitals, it has been left to the IRS to determine the criteria hospitals must meet to qualify as an IRC 501(c)(3) charitable organization. The original standard was known as the Charity Care Standard. This standard was replaced by the IRS with the Community Benefit Standard which is the current Charity Care Standard. In 1956, the IRS issued revenue ruling 56-185, which addressed the requirements hospitals needed to meet in order to qualify for IRC 501(c)(3) status. One of these requirements is known as the Charity Care Standard. Under the standard, a hospital had to provide, to the extent of its financial ability, free or reduced-cost care to patients unable to pay for it. A hospital that expected full payment did not, according to the ruling, provide charity care. The ruling emphasized that a low level of charity care did not necessarily mean that a hospital had failed to meet the requirement since that level could reflect its financial ability to provide such care. The ruling also noted that a publically supported community hospital would normally qualify as a charitable organization because it serves the entire community, and a low level of charity care would not affect a hospitals exempt status if it was due to the surrounding community lack of charitable demands. In 1969, the IRS issued revenue ruling 69-545 which removed from ruling 56-185 the requirements relating to caring for patients without charge or at rates below costs. Under the standard developed in ruling 69-545, which is know as the ""Community Benefit Standard"", hospitals are judged on whether they promote health of a broad class of individuals in the community. The ruling involved a hospital that only admitted individuals who could pay for the services (by themselves, private insurance, or public programs such as Medicare), but operated a full-time Emergency Room that was open to everyone. The IRS ruled that the hospital qualified as a charitable organization because it promoted the health of people in its community. The IRS reasoned that because the promotion of health was a charitable purpose according to the general law of charity, it fell within the ""generally accepted legal sense"" of the term ""charitable"", as required by Treasury Regulation 1.501 (c)(3)-1(d)(2). The IRS ruling stated that the promotion of health, like the relief of poverty and the advancement of education and religion, is one of the purposes in the general law of charity that is deemed beneficial to the community as a whole, even though the class of beneficiaries eligible to receive a direct benefit from its activities does not include all members of the community, such as indigent members of the community, provided that the class is not so small that its relief is not of benefit to the community. The IRS concluded that the hospital was promoting the health of a class of persons that is broad enough to benefit the community because its Emergency Room was open to all and it provided care to everyone who could pay, whether directly or through third-party reimbursement. Other characteristics of the hospital that the IRS highlighted included the following: o Its surplus funds were used to improve patient care, expand hospital facilities, and advance medical training, education and research. o It was controlled by a Board of Trustees that consisted of independent civic leaders. o Hospital medical staff privileges were available to all qualified physicians. The organization believes that Medicare underpayments and bad debt are community benefits and associated costs should be includable on Form 990, Schedule H, Part I. The American Hospital Association's (AHA) position is that Medicare underpayments and bad debt are community benefits and associated costs should be includable on Form 990, Schedule H, Part I. This organization agrees with the AHA position as outlined in the AHA letter to the IRS dated August 21, 2007. With respect to the first published draft of the new Form 990 and Schedule H, the AHA felt that the IRS should incorporate the full value of the community benefit that hospitals provide by counting Medicare underpayments as quantifiable community benefit for the following reasons; o Providing care for the elderly and serving Medicare patients is an essential part of the Community Benefit Standard. o Medicare, like Medicaid, does not pay the full cost of care. Medicare reimburses the hospital only 89 cents for every dollar they spend to take care of Medicare patients. o Many Medicare beneficiaries, like their Medicaid counterparts, are poor. More than 46 percent of Medicare spending is for beneficiaries whose income is below 200 percent Federal poverty level. Many of those Medicare beneficiaries are also eligible for Medicaid, so called dual eligibles. There is every compelling public policy reason to treat Medicare and Medicaid underpayments similarly for the purposes of a hospital's community benefit and include the costs on Form 990, Schedule H, Part I. Medicare underpayment must be shouldered by the hospital in order to continue treating the community's elderly and poor. These underpayments represent a real cost of serving the community and should count as a quantifiable community benefit. Both the AHA and this organization also feel that patient bad debt is a community benefit and thus includable on Form 990, Schedule H, Part I. Like Medicare underpayment, there also are compelling reasons that patient bad debt should be counted as a quantifiable community benefit. A significant majority of bad debt is attributable to low-income patients, who, for many reasons, decline to complete the forms required to establish eligibility for the hospital's Charity Care or Financial Assistance programs. A 2006 Congressional Budget Office Report, Nonprofit Hospitals and the Provision of Community Benefits, cited two studies indicating that ""the great majority of bad debt was attributable to patients with incomes below 200 percent of the Federal Poverty Line"". The report also noted that a substantial portion of bad debt is pending Charity Care. Unlike bad debt in other industries, hospital bad debt is complicated by the fact that hospitals follow their mission to the community and treat every patient that comes through their Emergency department, regardless of their ability to pay. Patients who have outstanding bills are not turned away, unlike other industries. Bad debt is further complicated by auditing industry standards on reporting Charity Care, many patients cannot or do not provide the necessary extensive documentation required to be deemed Charity Care by the auditors. As a result, roughly 40% of bad debt is pending Charity Care."

The funding for the programs first year was supported in part by a grant. The programs purpose is to improve patient's health by focusing on community development, health literacy education and coordination of existing health and social service programs to address the needs of the sickest members of the community. PHC staff feature Advance Practice Nurses with a community nursing background and outreach workers to guide patients to appropriate community-base healthcare and social service resources available. Some of the resources available include Federally Qualified Health Centers and other primary care providers, pharmacies, housing and transportation resources and religious and civic organizations. Health literacy education is provided along with individualized and group visits to improve patients' understanding of their particular chronic condition and how to manage the condition. PHC works with community based resources noted above to coordinate care and develop individualized care plans for each patient. PHC seeks to identify barriers to care that impede each patient's wellness, and develop a care plan that will remove those barriers. Examples of these barriers include: cost, transportation, language and cultural barriers, lack of awareness of available resources, lack of knowledge of their chronic condition and how to manage the condition and lack of trust in the traditional healthcare system.

THE MEDICARE ALLOWABLE COSTS WERE OBTAINED FROM THE MEDICARE COST REPORTS AND THEN REDUCED BY ANY AMOUNTS ALREADY CAPTURED IN COMMUNITY BENEFIT EXPENSE IN PART I ABOVE.THE HOSPITAL BELIEVES THE ENTIRE AMOUNT OF THE MEDICARE SHORTFALL SHOULD BE TREATED AS COMMUNITY BENEFIT, MORE SPECIFICALLY, AS CHARITY CARE. THE ELDERLY CONSTITUTE A CLEARLY-RECOGNIZED CHARITABLE CLASS, AND MANY MEDICARE BENEFICIARIES, LIKE THEIR MEDICAID COUNTERPARTS, ARE POOR AND THUS WOULD HAVE QUALIFIED FOR THE HOSPITAL'S CHARITY CARE PROGRAM, MEDICAID OR OTHER NEEDS-BASED GOVERNMENT PROGRAMS ABSENT THE MEDICARE PROGRAM. BY ACCEPTING PAYMENT BELOW COST TO TREAT THESE INDIVIDUALS, THE BURDENS OF GOVERNMENT ARE RELIEVED WITH RESPECT TO THESE INDIVIDUALS. ADDITIONALLY, THERE IS A SIGNIFICANT POSSIBILITY THAT CONTINUED REDUCTION IN REIMBURSEMENT MAY ACTUALLY CREATE DIFFICULTIES IN ACCESS FOR THESE INDIVIDUALS. FINALLY, THE AMOUNT SPENT TO COVER THE MEDICARE SHORTFALL IS MONEY NOT AVAILABLE TO COVER CHARITY CARE AND OTHER COMMUNITY BENEFIT NEEDS.METHODIST IS PAID BELOW LEVELS THAT FULLY COMPENSATE IT FOR THE UNDERLYING COSTS OF CARE TO MEDICARE BENEFICIARIES. METHODIST TREATS ITS MEDICARE SHORTFALL AS A COMMUNITY BENEFIT DUE TO THE LARGE POPULATION OF SENIORS THE HOSPITAL SERVES.

AS COMPARED TO THE DEMOGRAPHIC CHARACTERISTICS OF THE PEKIN/PEORIA MSA (METROPOLITAN STATISTICAL AREA), METHODIST SERVES A LARGER MINORITY AND SENIOR POPULATION. THE DEMOGRAPHICS OF METHODIST'S PATIENT POPULATION ARE A FUNCTION OF SEVERAL VARIABLES SUCH AS THE INCIDENCE AND PREVALENCE OF DISEASE AMONG AGE COHORTS, AND RACES, GEOGRAPHIC PROXIMITY TO MINORITY POPULATIONS AND OUTREACH EFFORTS TO IMPROVE ACCESS TO MEDICAL SERVICES.

IN ADDITION, OTHER PROGRAMS ARE CARRIED OUT WITH THE EXPRESS PURPOSE OF IMPROVING COMMUNITY HEALTH, ACCESS TO HEALTH SERVICES AND GENERAL HEALTH KNOWLEDGE. THESE SERVICES DO NOT GENERATE PATIENT BILLS, HOWEVER, CERTAIN PROGRAMS OR SERVICES MAY HAVE NOMINAL FEES. THESE SERVICES AND PROGRAMS INCLUDE SENIOR BREAKFAST CLUBS WHICH INCLUDE EDUCATIONAL SPEAKERS FOCUSING ON HEALTH AND WELLNESS AND INCLUDE BLOOD PRESSURE SCREENINGS; CANCER SUPPORT GROUPS FOR VARIOUS TYPES OF CANCER INCLUDING, PROSTATE, BREAST AND SKIN CANCERS. THESE GROUPS FOCUS ON EDUCATING THE NEWLY DIAGNOSED AND PROVIDING INFORMATION ON BETTER LIVING FOR SURVIVORS. SKIN CANCER SCREENING ARE ALSO PROVIDED; VARIOUS PROGRAMS REGARDING JOINT PAIN AND REPLACEMENT INCLUDING TREATMENT OPTIONS AND INFORMATION ON PAIN RELIEF; VARIOUS WOMEN AND BABY, BREASTFEEDING, MULTIPLES AND CHILDBIRTH CLASSES; VARIOUS EDUCATIONAL PROGRAMS AND SUPPORT GROUPS TO RAISE AWARENESS OF HEART DISEASE RISK FACTORS AND TREATMENT OPTIONS AND EDUCATION FOR LIVING WITH THE DISEASE; THERE ARE VARIOUS PROGRAMS REGARDING HEALTH EATING AND THE RISKS OF BEING OVERWEIGHT FOR BOTH ADULTS AND ADOLESCENTS.

CERTAIN OF THESE PROGRAMS ARE GEARED TO THE LOW INCOME AND DIVERSE STUDENT POPULATIONS. PART I, LINE 7G ADVOCATE HEALTH & HOSPITALS CORPORATION PROVIDES SUBSIDIZED HEALTH SERVICES TO THE COMMUNITY. THESE SERVICES ARE PROVIDED DESPITE CREATING A FINANCIAL LOSS FOR AHHC. THESE SERVICES ARE PROVIDED BECAUSE THEY MEET AN IDENTIFIED COMMUNITY NEED. IF AHHC DID NOT PROVIDE THE CLINICAL SERVICE, IT IS REASONABLE TO CONCLUDE THAT THESE SERVICES WOULD NOT BE AVAILABLE TO THE COMMUNITY. THE SERVICES INCLUDED ARE BOTH INPATIENT AND OUTPATIENT PROGRAMS FOR, MENTAL, BEHAVIORAL AND CHEMICAL DEPENDENCY HEALTH SERVICES, REHABILITATION SERVICES, CARDIAC SURGERY, ORTHOPEDIC AND HOSPICE SERVICES. PART I, LINE 7H AHHC CONDUCTS NUMEROUS RESEARCH ACTIVITIES FOR THE ADVANCEMENT OF MEDICAL AND HEALTH CARE SERVICES. HOWEVER, THE UNREIMBURSED COST OF SUCH RESEARCH ACTIVITIES IS NOT READILY DETERMINABLE AND NO AMOUNT IS BEING REPORTED FOR PURPOSES OF THE 2014 FORM 990, SCHEDULE H. PART I, LINE 7, COLUMN (F) $212,681,858 OF BAD DEBT EXPENSE WAS INCLUDED ON FORM 990, PART IX, LINE 25, COLUMN (A), BUT WAS REMOVED FROM THE DENOMINATOR FOR PURPOSES OF SCHEDULE H, PART I, LINE 7, COLUMN (F). PART II N/A PART III, LINES 2, 3, AND 4 THE FOOTNOTES TO ADVOCATE HEALTH CARE NETWORK AND SUBSIDIARIES' AUDITED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS DO NOT SPECIFICALLY ADDRESS BAD DEBT EXPENSE; RATHER, THE FOOTNOTE DESCRIBES ADVOCATE'S PATIENT ACCOUNTS RECEIVABLE POLICY AND THE PERCENTAGE OF ACCOUNTS RECEIVABLE THAT THE ALLOWANCE FOR DOUBTFUL ACCOUNTS COVERS (SEE PAGE 11 OF THE AUDITED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS). FOR 2014, FOR AHHC, THE ALLOWANCE FOR DOUBTFUL ACCOUNTS COVERED 24.7% OF NET PATIENT ACCOUNTS RECEIVABLE. PATIENT ACCOUNTS RECEIVABLE ARE STATED AT NET REALIZABLE VALUE. AHHC EVALUATES THE COLLECTABILITY OF ITS ACCOUNTS RECEIVABLE BASED ON THE LENGTH OF TIME THE RECEIVABLE IS OUTSTANDING, PAYER CLASS, HISTORICAL COLLECTION EXPERIENCE, AND TRENDS IN HEALTH CARE INSURANCE PROGRAMS. ACCOUNTS RECEIVABLE ARE CHARGED TO THE ALLOWANCE FOR UNCOLLECTIBLE ACCOUNTS WHEN THEY ARE DEEMED UNCOLLECTIBLE. THE COSTING METHODOLOGY USED IN DETERMINING THE AMOUNTS REPORTED ON LINES 2 AND 3 IS BASED ON THE RATIO OF PATIENT CARE COST TO CHARGES. THE UNREIMBURSED COST OF BAD DEBT WAS CALCULATED BY APPLYING THE ORGANIZATION'S COST TO CHARGE RATIO FROM THE MEDICARE COST REPORTS (CMS 2252-96 WORKSHEET C, PART 1, PPS INPATIENT RATIOS) TO THE ORGANIZATION'S BAD DEBT PROVISION PER GENERALLY ACCEPTED ACCOUNTING PRINCIPLES, LESS ANY PATIENT OR THIRD PARTY PAYOR PAYMENTS RECEIVED. ADVOCATE MAKES EVERY EFFORT TO IDENTIFY THOSE PATIENTS WHO ARE ELIGIBLE FOR FINANCIAL ASSISTANCE BY STRICTLY ADHERING TO ITS FINANCIAL ASSISTANCE POLICY. WE BELIEVE THAT ADVOCATE HAS A POPULATION OF PATIENTS WHO ARE UNINSURED OR UNDERINSURED BUT WHO DO NOT COMPLETE THE FINANCIAL ASSISTANCE APPLICATION OR ARE NOT IDENTIFIED THROUGH OTHER MEANS AS PERMITTED IN THE POLICY. THE ESTIMATED AMOUNT OF BAD DEBT EXPENSE (AT COST) WHICH COULD BE REASONABLY ATTRIBUTABLE TO PATIENTS WHO WOULD LIKELY QUALIFY FOR FINANCIAL ASSISTANCE UNDER THE ORGANIZATION'S FINANCIAL ASSISTANCE POLICY, IF SUFFICIENT INFORMATION HAD BEEN AVAILABLE TO MAKE A DETERMINATION OF THEIR ELIGIBILITY, WAS BASED UPON SELF PAY PATIENT ACCOUNTS WHICH HAD AMOUNTS WRITTEN OFF TO BAD DEBTS. OUR METHOD WAS TO BEGIN WITH THE SELF-PAY PORTION OF BAD DEBT EXPENSE PROVISION. THE SELF-PAY PORTION EXCLUDES THOSE PATIENTS WHO HAD CHARITY APPLICATIONS PENDING AT THE TIME OF SERVICE. THIS COST WAS THEN REDUCED BY CHARGES IDENTIFIED AS TRUE BAD DEBT EXPENSE, INCLUDING COPAYS FOR PATIENTS WHO QUALIFIED FOR LESS THAN 100% FINANCIAL ASSISTANCE. THE COST TO CHARGE RATIO WAS THEN APPLIED TO THE REMAINING CHARGES, TO DETERMINE THE VALUE (AT COST) OF PATIENT ACCOUNTS THAT DID NOT COMPLETE FINANCIAL COUNSELING AND WERE ASSIGNED TO BAD DEBT. WE BELIEVE THIS PROCESS IS A REASONABLE BASIS FOR OUR ESTIMATE. AS WE ARE ONLY CONSIDERING SELF-PAY ACCOUNTS WRITTEN OFF TO BAD DEBT FOR THIS ESTIMATE, THIS ESTIMATE DOES NOT INCLUDE THE IMMEDIATE 20% DISCOUNT TO CHARGES WHICH IS APPLIED TO ALL SELF-PAY PATIENTS. IT ALSO DOES NOT INCLUDE ACCOUNT BALANCES OR CO-PAYS OF NON-SELF PAY ACCOUNTS WHICH ARE WRITTEN OFF TO BAD DEBT WHEN THE PATIENT HAS NO OTHER FINANCIAL RESOURCES TO PAY THESE AMOUNTS AND THE PATIENT DOES NOT APPLY FOR FINANCIAL ASSISTANCE. BAD DEBT AMOUNTS HAVE BEEN EXCLUDED FROM OTHER COMMUNITY BENEFIT AMOUNTS REPORTED THROUGHOUT SCHEDULE H. PART III, LINE 8 THE SHORTFALL OF $144,141,808 ON PART III, LINE 7 IS THE UNREIMBURSED COST OF PROVIDING SERVICES FOR MEDICARE PATIENTS AND SHOULD BE TREATED AS COMMUNITY BENEFIT BECAUSE PROVIDING THESE SERVICES WITHOUT REIMBURSEMENT LESSENS THE BURDENS OF GOVERNMENT OR OTHER CHARITIES THAT WOULD OTHERWISE BE NEEDED TO SERVE THE COMMUNITY. FOR ADVOCATE HEALTH AND HOSPITAL CORPORATION'S HOSPITAL OPERATIONS, THE UNREIMBURSED COST OF MEDICARE WAS CALCULATED BY APPLYING THE ORGANIZATION'S COST TO CHARGE RATIO FROM THE MEDICARE COST REPORTS (CMS 2252-96 WORKSHEET C, PART 1, PPS INPATIENT RATIOS) AND FOR NON-HOSPITAL OPERATIONS THE COST TO CHARGE RATIO CALCULATED ON WORKSHEET 2 RATIO OF PATIENT CARE COST TO CHARGES TO THE ORGANIZATION'S MEDICARE, LESS ANY PATIENT OR THIRD PARTY PAYOR PAYMENTS AND/OR CONTRIBUTIONS RECEIVED THAT WERE DESIGNATED FOR THE PAYMENT OF MEDICARE PATIENT BILLS."

THE MISSION AND SPIRITUAL CARE TEAM AT THE HOSPITAL WORKS CLOSELY WITH SEVERAL COMMUNITY CONGREGATIONS TO SURVEY AND RESPOND TO SPECIFIC NEEDS IDENTIFIED THROUGH THIS PROCESS. SOME CONGREGATIONS HAVE ASKED FOR SPECIFIC EDUCATION ON END OF LIFE ISSUES, OTHERS ON DIABETES MANAGEMENT, ETC. THE HOSPITAL WORKS WITH THESE CONGREGATIONS AND OTHER COMMUNITY GROUPS TO BRIDGE SERVICES TO CONGREGANTS. THE HOSPITAL ALSO ACTS AS A CATALYST BY PROVIDING LEADERSHIP AND RESOURCES TO COMMUNITY COALITIONS TO HELP ADDRESS ISSUES THAT MAY SURFACE, SUCH AS SUICIDE AND SUBSTANCE ABUSE CONCERNS.

THE HANLON METHOD WAS UTILIZED TO ESTABLISH PRIORITIES BASED ON THE SIZE AND SERIOUSNESS OF THE HEALTH PROBLEM AS WELL AS THE EFFECTIVENESS OF THE AVAILABLE INTERVENTIONS. ON APRIL 19, 2012, THE CHAC APPROVED THE CHP. BROMENN MEDICAL CENTER'S COMMUNITY HEALTH LEADER ALSO PARTICIPATED IN OSF SAINT JOSEPH MEDICAL CENTER'S COLLABORATIVE CHNA TEAM IN FEBRUARY 2013. ADVOCATE TRINITY HOSPITAL IN ADDITION TO THE NEEDS ASSESSMENTS PREVIOUSLY REPORTED, IN 2014 THE HOSPITAL IMPLEMENTED THE CENTER FOR FAITH AND HEALTH TRANSFORMATION'S CONGREGATIONAL HEALTH SURVEY, WHICH ASSESSES THE COMMUNITY HEALTH NEEDS OF CONGREGATIONS AND SPECIFIC POPULATIONS SURROUNDING THEM. THE FOCUS GROUP SURVEYED INCLUDED FIVE FAITH ORGANIZATIONS THAT WERE MEMBERS OF THE PARTNERS FOR FAITH AND HEALTH NETWORK, A COLLABORATIVE WITHIN THE TRINITY HOSPITAL SERVICE AREA. THE SURVEYS RESULTED IN THE IDENTIFICATION OF SEVERAL HEALTH NEEDS INCLUDING THE TOP THREE HEALTH CONCERNS OF HYPERTENSION, OBESITY AND DIABETES.

LARGER COMMUNITIES INCLUDE ARLINGTON HEIGHTS (75,101), DES PLAINES (58,364), MOUNT PROSPECT (54,167), PALATINE (68,557) AND SKOKIE (64,784) AS WELL AS A PORTION OF THE CITY OF CHICAGO AND A VERY SMALL PORTION OF LAKE COUNTY. MOST HOUSEHOLDS IN THE PSA (68.6%) ARE FAMILY HOUSEHOLDS. MARRIED COUPLED FAMILIES ARE 53.9% OF HOUSEHOLDS WHILE 10.4% HAVE FEMALE HOUSEHOLDERS. THREE IN TEN HOUSEHOLDS (32.3%) INCLUDE CHILDREN. ABOUT ONE-FOURTH OF HOMES (26.5%) INCLUDE A PERSON WHO IS 65 OR OLDER, WHILE ONE OF NINE SENIOR CITIZENS (11.7%) LIVES ALONE. HOMEOWNERS CONSTITUTE 71.2% OF HOUSEHOLDS, WHILE 26.5% RENT. THE AVERAGE HOUSEHOLD SIZE IS 2.63 WHICH IS CONSISTENT WITH THE NATION'S AVERAGE HOUSEHOLD SIZE OF 2.58, AND THE STATE OF ILLINOIS AVERAGE AT 2.59. AGE AND GENDER ON THE WHOLE, THE POPULATION OF LUTHERAN GENERAL HOSPITAL'S PSA IS RELATIVELY OLDER. THE MEDIAN AGE IS 41.0 (U.S. 37.2) WITH A SENIOR 65+ POPULATION OF 165,714 (15.7%) AND A 62+ POPULATION OF 200,756 (19.1%) OR NEARLY ONE IN FIVE PERSONS. OF THE PSA POPULATION OF MORE THAN ONE MILLION, 511,641 (48.6%) ARE MALE AND 541,214 (51.4%) ARE FEMALE FOR A GENDER RATIO OF 94.5 MALES PER 100 FEMALES. THE ""BABY BOOMER"" GENERATION HAS EXPERIENCED THE LARGEST GROWTH FROM 2000-2010. MAINE TOWNSHIP HAS AN EVEN OLDER POPULATION THAN THE OVERALL PRIMARY SERVICE AREA; WITH PARK RIDGE HAVING AN EVEN OLDER POPULATION THAN MAINE TOWNSHIP. MAINE TOWNSHIP HAS A MEDIAN AGE OF 42.4 YEARS, WITH 17.5% OF ITS POPULATION 65+ AND A GENDER RATIO OF 92.1 MEN PER 100 WOMEN. PARK RIDGE HAS A MEDIAN AGE OF 44.8 WITH 18.4% OF ITS POPULATION AGE 65 OR OLDER. RACE AND ETHNICITY WHILE LUTHERAN GENERAL'S PRIMARY SERVICE AREA IS PREDOMINANTLY WHITE, NON-HISPANIC (66.0%), THE POPULACE ALSO INCLUDES 18.1% HISPANIC, 11.2% ASIAN AND 3.1% AFRICAN AMERICAN. THE HISPANIC POPULATION IS MOSTLY OF MEXICAN ORIGIN, WHILE THE LARGEST ASIAN GROUP IS SOUTH ASIAN. OVERALL, 37.5% OF THE RESIDENTS IN THE AREA ARE FOREIGN BORN. HALF OF THE FOREIGN BORN POPULATION HAS BECOME CITIZENS. NEARLY 15.6% REPORT SPEAKING SPANISH AT HOME WITH NEARLY HALF OF THOSE WHO DO SPEAK ENGLISH REPORTING THEY DO NOT SPEAK ENGLISH VERY WELL. HOWEVER, THERE IS A HIGHER MINORITY RATIO AMONG YOUTH THAN AMONG OLDER POPULATIONS. FOR EXAMPLE, IN MAINE TOWNSHIP, ONLY 58.1% OF CHILDREN 8 OR UNDER ARE WHITE, NON-HISPANIC COMPARED TO 87.1 % OF SENIOR CITIZENS (68.4% FOR THE TOTAL POPULATION). BECAUSE MINORITY GROUPS ARE YOUNG, WITH HIGHER BIRTH RATES, THEY WILL LIKELY BECOME A PROPORTIONATELY LARGER POPULATION IN THE FUTURE. ACCORDING TO THE US CENSUS BUREAU (2000 AND 2010), THE NUMBER OF SOUTH ASIANS IN THE UNITED STATES INCREASED 70%, FROM 1,678,765 TO 2,843,391 FROM 2000 TO 2010. SOUTH ASIANS ARE DEFINED BY THOSE WHO DERIVE THEIR ETHNIC ORIGINS FROM THE INDIAN SUBCONTINENT. NUMBERS FOR THE SAME ETHNIC POPULATION GROUP IN ILLINOIS INCREASED 50%, FROM 124,723 TO 188,328, IN THE SAME 2000 TO 2010 TIME PERIOD. THE GREATER CHICAGO AREA CURRENTLY SERVES AS ONE OF THE MAJOR CULTURAL CENTERS OF THE UNITED STATES' SOUTH ASIAN COMMUNITY. MORE THAN 50% OF THIS COMMUNITY IS BETWEEN THE AGES OF 25 AND 55 YEARS OLD. LUTHERAN GENERAL HOSPITAL'S TOTAL PRIMARY SERVICE AREA HAS MORE THAN 53,363 SOUTH ASIANS. WITHIN A 40 MINUTE DRIVE OF LUTHERAN GENERAL HOSPITAL, THERE ARE 26 SOUTH ASIAN PLACES OF WORSHIP, INCLUDING TEMPLES, MOSQUES AND CHURCHES. ACCORDING TO THE THOMSON REUTERS MARKET EXPERT (2011), THE U.S. CENSUS BUREAU (2000 AND 2010) AND THE AMERICAN COMMUNITY SURVEY (2007-2011), THE KOREAN-AMERICAN COMMUNITY INCREASED IN COOK COUNTY BY APPROXIMATELY 23% TO OVER 30,000 KOREAN AMERICANS FROM 2000 TO 2010.

ACCORDING TO THE THOMSON REUTERS MARKET EXPERT (2011), THE U.S. CENSUS BUREAU (2000 AND 2010) AND THE AMERICAN COMMUNITY SURVEY (2007-2011), THERE WERE 152,730 POLISH AMERICANS IN LUTHERAN GENERAL'S PRIMARY SERVICE WITH THAT NUMBER PROJECTED TO RISE. THE MAJORITY OF POLISH PATIENTS COME FROM THE FOLLOWING ZIP CODES IN DESCENDING ORDER: 60016 (DES PLAINES); 60714 (NILES); 60634 (CHICAGO); 60656 (CHICAGO); 60056 (MT.

IN ADDITION TO LUTHERAN GENERAL HOSPITAL, THERE IS ALSO OUR LADY OF THE RESURRECTION MEDICAL CENTER, RESURRECTION MEDICAL CENTER, ALEXIAN BROTHERS MEDICAL CENTER, NORTHWEST COMMUNITY HOSPITAL, NORTHSHORE GLENBROOK HOSPITAL, HOLY FAMILY MEDICAL CENTER AND NORTHSHORE SKOKIE HOSPITAL. THERE ARE 582 PRIMARY CARE PHYSICIANS WITHIN THE MARKET AND 1,612 SPECIALISTS. THE SPECIALISTS INCLUDE 230 OBSTETRICS & GYNECOLOGY PHYSICIANS, 106 CARDIOLOGISTS, 69 OTOLARYNGOLOGISTS, 64 GASTROENTEROLOGISTS, AND 147 ORTHOPEDIC PHYSICIANS. THE PEDIATRIC PRIMARY SERVICE AREA IS SLIGHTLY LARGER AND INCLUDES 698 PEDIATRICIANS AND 281 PEDIATRIC SPECIALISTS. THERE IS ALSO THE ACCESS COMMUNITY HEALTH NETWORK GENESIS CLINIC FOR HEALTH AND EMPOWERMENT IN DES PLAINES, ILLINOIS, WHICH IS A FEDERALLY QUALIFIED HEALTH CENTER (FQHC) THAT PROVIDES HEALTH CARE PRIMARILY FOR LOW INCOME AND UNINSURED PATIENTS, MAINLY FOR THE HISPANIC COMMUNITY. ADVOCATE GOOD SAMARITAN HOSPITAL FOR PLANNING PURPOSES, THE COMMUNITY HEALTH COUNCIL DEFINES THE COMMUNITY AS THE PRIMARY SERVICE AREA FOR THE HOSPITAL. GOOD SAMARITAN HOSPITAL'S PRIMARY SERVICE AREA (PSA) CONSISTS OF 16 COMMUNITIES IN WESTERN SUBURBAN DUPAGE COUNTY OF METROPOLITAN CHICAGO. THE HOSPITAL SERVES AN ADDITIONAL 12 COMMUNITIES IN ITS SECONDARY SERVICE AREA (SSA). THE TOTAL SERVICE AREA (TSA) REFERS TO GOOD SAMARITAN HOSPITAL'S COMBINED PRIMARY AND SECONDARY SERVICE AREA. A REVIEW OF THE DEMOGRAPHIC DATA (2010) FOR THE HOSPITAL'S PSA SHOWED THE POPULATION TO BE PRIMARILY WHITE, NON-HISPANIC. THE HISPANIC POPULATION COMPRISED 9% OF THE PSA COMPARED TO 15.8% NATIONALLY. THE ASIAN AND PACIFIC ISLANDER POPULATION PERCENTAGE IS TWICE THAT OF THE NATIONAL AVERAGE OR 9.3% VERSUS 4.5%. COMBINED, THESE TWO GROUPS MAKE UP ALMOST 20% OF GOOD SAMARITAN'S PSA. BLACK NON-HISPANICS ACCOUNT FOR 6.3% OF THE POPULATION IN THE PSA COMPARED TO 12.1% NATIONALLY. NEARLY TWICE AS MANY ADULTS IN THE GOOD SAMARITAN HOSPITAL PSA HAVE A BACHELOR'S DEGREE OR HIGHER WHEN COMPARED TO THE NATIONAL AVERAGE. THERE ARE ALSO 1.5 TIMES THE NUMBER OF HOUSEHOLDS WITH INCOME OF $75K OR ABOVE IN THE GOOD SAMARITAN HOSPITAL PSA COMPARED TO THE NATIONAL AVERAGE. WHILE OVERALL POPULATION GROWTH IN THE PSA IS PRIMARILY FLAT AT 1.6%, IT IS EXPECTED THAT THE POPULATION OF ADULTS GREATER THAN 65 YEARS OF AGE WILL INCREASE BY 20% FROM 2010-2015. THE TOTAL POPULATION IN 2010 WAS 682,821. WITHIN GOOD SAMARITAN HOSPITAL'S PSA, THE 65 AND OLDER AGE GROUP IS PROJECTED TO GROW FROM 83,607 IN 2010 TO 100,460 IN 2015. FEMALES OF CHILD BEARING AGE (15-44) ARE PROJECTED TO DECLINE BY 2.8% FROM 129,640 IN 2010 TO 126,001 IN 2015. THE AVERAGE HOUSEHOLD INCOME IN THE PSA IS $104,232 COMPARED TO THE NATIONAL HOUSEHOLD INCOME OF $71,071. A WIDER VIEW OF DUPAGE COUNTY SHOWS THAT ALTHOUGH THE TOTAL POPULATION OF DUPAGE COUNTY HAS SEEN ONLY MODEST GROWTH SINCE 1990 COMPARED TO PREVIOUS DECADES (18% GROWTH), THE NUMBER OF PEOPLE IN POVERTY HAS GROWN BY 131%, AND THE NUMBER OF WORKING POOR (THOSE WITH INCOME BELOW 200% OF FEDERAL POVERTY LEVEL) HAS GROWN BY 102%. BY COMPARISON, CHICAGO'S POVERTY POPULATION DECREASED BY 2.7% DURING THIS SAME TIME PERIOD, AND ITS WORKING POOR NUMBERS INCREASED BY ONLY 1.9%. THIS SHIFT IN THE POVERTY POPULATION TOWARD THE SUBURBS IS CONSISTENT WITH OTHER SUBURBS IN THE REGION AND ACROSS THE COUNTRY AND IMPACTS GOOD SAMARITAN HOSPITAL'S PSA. HOSPITALS AND HEALTH RESOURCES THERE ARE FIVE HOSPITALS LOCATED WITHIN GOOD SAMARITAN HOSPITAL'S PSA: ADVOCATE GOOD SAMARITAN HOSPITAL IN DOWNERS GROVE, EDWARD HOSPITAL IN NAPERVILLE, ADVENTIST HINSDALE HOSPITAL IN HINSDALE, ADVENTIST BOLINGBROOK HOSPITAL IN BOLINGBROOK, AND ELMHURST MEMORIAL HOSPITAL IN ELMHURST.

THE DUPAGE COUNTY PUBLIC HEALTH DEPARTMENT, AS WELL AS THE ACCESS COMMUNITY HEALTH NETWORK FEDERALLY QUALIFIED HEALTH CENTER (FQHC) CLINICS, PROVIDE HEALTH CARE PRIMARILY FOR LOW INCOME AND UNINSURED PATIENTS. IN ADDITION, ACCESS DUPAGE, A COLLABORATIVE EFFORT BY HUNDREDS OF INDIVIDUALS AND ORGANIZATIONS IN DUPAGE COUNTY, ALSO PROVIDES A MOSAIC APPROACH TO PROVIDING ACCESS TO MEDICAL SERVICES FOR THE COUNTY'S LOW-INCOME AND MEDICALLY UNINSURED RESIDENTS. IT REPRESENTS A UNIQUE PARTNERSHIP OF COUNTY HOSPITALS (INCLUDING GOOD SAMARITAN), PHYSICIANS, LOCAL GOVERNMENT, HUMAN SERVICES AGENCIES, AND COMMUNITY GROUPS WORKING TOGETHER TO ADDRESS THIS FORMIDABLE ISSUE. ADVOCATE GOOD SHEPHERD HOSPITAL PRIMARY SERVICE AREA ADVOCATE GOOD SHEPHERD HOSPITAL'S PRIMARY SERVICE AREA (PSA) INCLUDES THE FOLLOWING COMMUNITIES: BARRINGTON (60010), LAKE ZURICH (60047), CARY (60013), FOX RIVER GROVE (60021), CRYSTAL LAKE (60014), ISLAND LAKE (60042), WAUCONDA (60084), MCHENRY (60050, 50051), PALATINE (60067), ALGONQUIN (60102), AND LAKE IN THE HILLS (60156). THE POPULATION GROWTH RATE IN THE HOSPITAL'S PSA HAS BEEN SLOWING IN THE PAST FEW YEARS AS EVIDENT WHEN COMPARING THE POPULATION TOTAL OF 361,762 IN 2010 TO THE POPULATION TOTAL OF 362,733 IN 2009.

HOWEVER, HISPANICS COMPRISE 10% OF CRYSTAL LAKE'S POPULATION, 11% OF THE 60050 MCHENRY ZIP CODE, 13% OF ISLAND LAKE'S POPULATION AND 18% OF WAUCONDA'S POPULATION. WHILE INCREASES IN MINORITY POPULATIONS WILL ACCOUNT FOR ABOUT 33% OF THE TOTAL POPULATION GROWTH, THE OVERALL RACIAL MIX OF THE MARKET WILL REMAIN LARGELY UNCHANGED. SECONDARY SERVICE AREA GOOD SHEPHERD'S SECONDARY SERVICE AREA (SSA), CONSISTS OF THE FOLLOWING COMMUNITIES: CRYSTAL LAKE (60012), MUNDELEIN (60060), ROUND LAKE (60073), WOODSTOCK (60098), AND CARPENTERSVILLE (60110).

SOURCE: HTTP://WWW.COOKCOUNTYPUBLICHEALTH.ORG/FILES/PDF/DATA-AND-REPORTS/COMMUNITY -PROFILES-06-08/SOUTH-DISTRICT-0608R.PDF PUBLIC HEALTH LITERATURE HAS IDENTIFIED A LINK BETWEEN POVERTY AND DISEASE, AS COMMUNITIES CONSIDERED UNDERPRIVILEGED EXHIBIT HIGHER MORTALITY AND MORBIDITY RATES THAN WEALTHIER COUNTERPARTS. FOR EXAMPLE, THE BURDEN OF ASTHMA IS NOT BORNE EQUALLY THROUGHOUT THE U.S. NEARLY 5,000 PEOPLE DIE FROM ASTHMA EACH YEAR NATIONALLY AND THE RISK OF DEATH AMONG AFRICAN AMERICANS IS THREE TIMES GREATER THAN AMONG CAUCASIANS IN AMERICA, WHICH HAS BEEN ATTRIBUTED TO HIGHER RATES OF POVERTY. ADDITIONALLY, AS A SOCIAL DETERMINANT OF HEALTH, POVERTY HAS BEEN LINKED WITH LOWER ACCESS TO CARE, BEING UNINSURED AND A DECREASE IN LIKELIHOOD TO RECEIVE MEDICAL TREATMENT UNTIL DISEASE IS EXACERBATED. AREAS WITH INCREASED POVERTY OFTEN LACK POLICIES, SYSTEMS AND ENVIRONMENTS THAT PROMOTE HEALTHY LIVING AND MAKE CHOOSING HEALTHY LIFESTYLES DIFFICULT. WHILE RESIDENTS OF SOME COMMUNITIES WITHIN SOUTH SUBURBAN HOSPITAL'S PSA ARE AMONG THE POOREST IN THE NATION, OTHERS ARE AMONG SOME OF THE MOST AFFLUENT WITHIN COOK COUNTY, THE STATE OF ILLINOIS AND, IN SOME INSTANCES, THE U.S. FOR EXAMPLE, HARVEY HAS AN AVERAGE HOUSEHOLD INCOME OF $43,356, COMPARED TO FLOSSMOOR'S AVERAGE HOUSEHOLD INCOME OF $114,131. ADDITIONALLY, ALMOST 40 PERCENT OF HARVEY'S RESIDENTS MAKE LESS THAN $25,000 A YEAR, COMPARED TO THE 40 PERCENT OF FLOSSMOOR'S RESIDENTS THAT MAKE $100,000 OR MORE. WHEN COMPARING EDUCATIONAL ATTAINMENT, 10 PERCENT OF HARVEY'S RESIDENTS HAVE A BACHELOR'S DEGREE OR HIGHER, AND FLOSSMOOR'S PERCENTAGE IS SLIGHTLY MORE THAN 50 PERCENT. APPROXIMATELY 41 PERCENT OF THE PRIMARY SERVICE AREA POPULATION HAS A HIGH SCHOOL DEGREE OR BELOW (INCLUDING NEARLY 12 PERCENT THAT DO NOT HAVE A HIGH SCHOOL DEGREE). THE AVERAGE HOUSEHOLD INCOME IS $68,343, WHICH IS SLIGHTLY BELOW THAT OF THE U.S., AND 34 PERCENT OF THE POPULATION IS UNINSURED/UNDERINSURED.

ADVOCATE TRINITY HOSPITAL DESCRIPTION OF COMMUNITY THE COMMUNITY HEALTH COUNCIL (CHC) SETS THE DIRECTION FOR THE COMMUNITY HEALTH INITIATIVES WITHIN TRINITY HOSPITAL'S TOTAL SERVICE AREA. FOR PLANNING PURPOSES, THE COUNCIL DEFINES THE COMMUNITY AS THE HOSPITAL'S PRIMARY AND SECONDARY SERVICE AREAS CONSISTENT WITH THE FOLLOWING ZIP CODES: 60617, 60619, 60620, 60628, 60643, AND 60649 (PRIMARY), 60409, 60621, 60633, 60636, 60637, AND 60827 (SECONDARY). THE COMMUNITY CONSISTS OF A TOTAL POPULATION OF 586,271, SPANNING 12 ZIP CODES, INCLUDING 20 COMMUNITY AREAS AS DEFINED BY THE CITY OF CHICAGO DEPARTMENT OF PLANNING. TRINITY HOSPITAL'S COMMUNITY LIES WITHIN COOK COUNTY AND THE CHICAGO CITY LIMITS WITH THE EXCEPTION OF CALUMET CITY, ILLINOIS, ZIP CODE 60827, WHICH LIES JUST SOUTH OF THE CHICAGO CITY LIMIT. DEMOGRAPHICS AGE ACCORDING TO THE 2012 U.S. CENSUS, THE MEDIAN AGE IN TRINITY HOSPITAL'S PRIMARY SERVICE AREA IS 35 WITH THE LARGEST POPULATION BETWEEN THE AGES OF 18-44. THIS AGE GROUP, HOWEVER, IS EXPECTED TO DECLINE AND THE 65+ POPULATION IS EXPECTED TO INCREASE. THE COMMUNITIES WITH THE LARGEST POPULATION ARE CHATHAM, AVALON PARK, CALUMET HEIGHTS, ROSELAND, AND GREAT GRAND CROSSING. TRINITY HOSPITAL'S SECONDARY SERVICE AREA MIRRORS THE PRIMARY SERVICE AREA WITH A MEDIAN AGE OF 32.4. A DECLINE IS PROJECTED IN ALL AGE GROUPS WITH THE EXCEPTION OF THE 65+ AGE GROUP, WHICH IS EXPECTED TO INCREASE. THE COMMUNITIES WITHIN THE SECONDARY SERVICE AREA WITH THE LARGEST AGING POPULATIONS ARE WEST ENGLEWOOD, WASHINGTON HEIGHTS, MORGAN PARK, CALUMET CITY AND HEGEWISCH. EXPECTED GROWTH OF THE SENIOR POPULATION IN THESE COMMUNITIES MAY PRESENT OPPORTUNITIES FOR TRINITY TO ENGAGE IN SENIOR HEALTH PROMOTION AND PROGRAMS. RACE AND ETHNICITY THE POPULATION IN TRINITY HOSPITAL'S TOTAL SERVICE AREA IS 81 PERCENT AFRICAN AMERICAN, 10 PERCENT HISPANIC, 8 PERCENT WHITE AND 2 PERCENT ASIAN. ALTHOUGH THE OVERALL POPULATION HAS DECLINED BETWEEN 2000 AND 2012, THE HISPANIC POPULATION HAS INCREASED WITHIN THE PRIMARY SERVICE AREA. ACCORDING TO DATA REVIEWED BY COMMUNITY, THE HISPANIC POPULATION IS PRIMARILY LOCATED IN FOUR SPECIFIC COMMUNITIES INCLUDING EASTSIDE, SOUTH CHICAGO, SOUTH DEERING AND HEGEWISCH. POVERTY THE AVERAGE POVERTY RATE IN TRINITY HOSPITAL'S PRIMARY SERVICE AREA IS 20.4 PERCENT WHICH IS HIGHER THAN THE ILLINOIS STATE (13.1 PERCENT) AND NATIONAL POVERTY LEVELS (14.3 PERCENT). THE AVERAGE POVERTY LEVEL RATE IN TRINITY HOSPITAL'S SECONDARY SERVICE AREA IS 28.6 PERCENT - MORE THAN TWICE THE STATE AND NATIONAL POVERTY LEVEL RATES. IN TRINITY HOSPITAL'S TOTAL SERVICE AREA, POVERTY RATE TRENDS INCREASE AS THE AGE OF THE POPULATION DECREASES. RESEARCH HAS DEMONSTRATED THAT POVERTY AND DISEASE ARE LINKED. POORER COMMUNITIES EXHIBIT HIGHER MORTALITY AND MORBIDITY RATES, AND INCREASED HEALTH NEEDS THAN LESS POVERTY STRICKEN COMMUNITIES. THIS PRESENTS TRINITY HOSPITAL WITH MULTIPLE OPPORTUNITIES TO ENGAGE IN HEALTH PROMOTION ACTIVITIES THAT ADDRESS COMMUNITY HEALTH DISPARITIES PERTINENT TO IMPROVING THE POPULATION'S HEALTH STATUS. HEALTH RESOURCES TRINITY HOSPITAL'S TOTAL SERVICE AREA IS SERVED BY A VARIETY OF HEALTH RESOURCES. THESE RESOURCES, HOWEVER, ARE LIMITED AND DO NOT MEET THE TOTAL POPULATION'S DEMAND FOR HEALTH SERVICES. A LARGE NUMBER OF PEOPLE IN THE COMMUNITY SEEK HEALTH SERVICES OUTSIDE OF TRINITY HOSPITAL'S TOTAL SERVICE AREA. THIS IS DUE TO THE LACK OF PRIMARY CARE ACCESS POINTS AND THE LACK OF TERTIARY CARE, WHICH PROVIDES HIGHLY SPECIALIZED MEDICAL/ADVANCED LEVEL CARE, INCLUDING TRAUMA CARE AND COMPLEX SURGICAL PROCEDURES OR TREATMENTS. HEALTH RESOURCES IN THE AREA INCLUDE A VARIETY OF SAFETY NET PROVIDERS, SUCH AS 7 COMMUNITY HOSPITALS, 2 FREE COMMUNITY CLINICS, 8 FEDERALLY QUALIFIED HEALTH CENTERS, 1 SCHOOL-BASED HEALTH CENTER, 1 COUNTY-BASED HEALTH CENTER, 2 CITY-BASED HEALTH CENTERS, AS WELL AS PRIVATE PRIMARY CARE FACILITIES.

TO THAT END, THEY CONTINUE TO UNDERTAKE AND SUPPORT INITIATIVES THAT ENHANCE ACCESS TO HEALTH AND WELLNESS SERVICES WITHIN THE DIVERSE COMMUNITIES THAT ADVOCATE SERVES. SYSTEM LEADERSHIP IS BOTH DESIGNED TO DIRECT AND SUPPORT THE HOSPITALS IN THEIR EFFORTS TO ADDRESS IDENTIFIED COMMUNITY NEEDS. IN 2010, A MULTI-DISCIPLINARY TEAM OF INDIVIDUALS AT THE SYSTEM LEVEL HAVING OVERSIGHT RESPONSIBILITY FOR COMMUNITY BENEFITS REPORTING AND THE CHNA PROCESS WAS CONVENED TO LEAD THE HOSPITALS THROUGH THE CHNA PROCESS TO MEET STATE AND FEDERAL REGULATORY REQUIREMENTS. THIS TEAM, CALLED THE COMMUNITY HEALTH STEERING COMMITTEE, MET FREQUENTLY TO ASSURE THAT: THE HOSPITAL COMMUNITY HEALTH LEADERS ARE EDUCATED REGARDING HOW TO CONDUCT A CHNA; SITE COMMUNITY HEALTH COUNCILS ARE DEVELOPED AND MAINTAINED; THOSE CONDUCTING THE CHNA PROCESS PULL DATA FROM RELIABLE SOURCES; SOUND ASSUMPTIONS ARE MADE BASED ON THAT DATA; INTERNAL ADVOCATE AND COMMUNITY RESOURCES ARE MAPPED TO DETERMINE STRENGTHS AND WEAKNESSES; ACHIEVABLE NEEDS ARE SELECTED AS PRIORITIES; AND PLANNED INITIATIVES ARE GROUNDED IN EVIDENCE-BASED PROGRAMS THAT WILL YIELD RELIABLE OUTCOMES TO DETERMINE IMPACT. TO FOCUS THESE EFFORTS THROUGHOUT ADVOCATE HEALTH CARE, THE COMMUNITY BENEFITS PLAN WAS WRITTEN. THE PLAN'S BROAD GOALS AND OBJECTIVES WERE DESIGNED TO STRUCTURE SYSTEM-WIDE COMMUNITY BENEFITS ACTIVITIES WITHIN A STRATEGIC FRAMEWORK. INCLUDED IN THE COMMUNITY BENEFITS PLAN ARE NOT ONLY PLANNED GOALS AND OBJECTIVES FOCUSED ON ADDRESSING NEEDS AS IDENTIFIED THROUGH THE HOSPITAL COMMUNITY HEALTH NEEDS ASSESSMENT PROCESS, BUT ALSO OTHER SYSTEM-WIDE EFFORTS TO ADDRESS THE BROADER ISSUES OF DISPARITY AND ACCESS SUCH AS PROVIDING CHARITY CARE TO THE UNDER AND UNINSURED. ADVOCATE'S COMMUNITY BENEFITS PLAN WAS DEVELOPED TO ESTABLISH STRATEGIES FOR IMPROVING ACCESS TO CARE AND POSITIVELY AFFECTING THE HEALTH OF THE COMMUNITIES THAT ADVOCATE SERVES. THE PLAN SETS THE COURSE FOR STRENGTHENING EXISTING PARTNERSHIPS AND BUILDING NEW ONES WITH INDIVIDUALS AND ORGANIZATIONS WITHIN ADVOCATE'S SERVICE AREAS IN ORDER TO LEVERAGE AND MAXIMIZE THE IMPACT OF ITS PROGRAMS. ADVOCATE'S COMMUNITY BENEFITS PLAN GOALS ARE AS FOLLOWS: GOAL 1: OPTIMIZE ADVOCATE'S ABILITY TO LEVERAGE ITS COMMUNITY HEALTH RESOURCES AND CONTINUE PROGRAMS THAT BENEFIT THE COMMUNITY BY PROSPECTIVELY ALIGNING SYSTEM AND SITE PLANS AND ACTIVITIES. IN ORDER TO ASSURE ALIGNMENT BETWEEN SITE AND SYSTEM GOALS, QUALITY AND CONSISTENCY AMONGST THE HOSPITALS' CHNAS AND TO LEVERAGE THE HOSPITALS' STAFF TIME AND CHNA EFFORTS, THE SYSTEM LEVEL COMMUNITY HEALTH STEERING COMMITTEE PROVIDED A STANDARDIZED CHNA PROCESS, TOOLS, EDUCATION AND STRUCTURE. SPECIFIC EXAMPLES OF THE SUPPORT PROVIDED BY THE STEERING COMMITTEE TO ENABLE THE HOSPITALS TO REALIZE THEIR COMMUNITY HEALTH GOALS AND OBJECTIVES ARE AS FOLLOWS: * A STANDARDIZED CHNA PROCESS THAT INCLUDED DEVELOPMENT OF A COMMUNITY HEALTH COUNCIL AT EACH HOSPITAL WITH BOTH HOSPITAL AND COMMUNITY REPRESENTATION. THE COUNCILS WERE CHARGED WITH MANAGING THEIR SITE'S ASSESSMENT, EXAMINING DATA, SITE AND COMMUNITY RESOURCES, SELECTING KEY PRIORITIES TO ADDRESS AND DEVELOPING A COMMUNITY HEALTH PLAN. * PURCHASE OF AND INSTRUCTION ON HOW TO USE SURVEY RESULTS AND THE ASSESSMENT TOOL DEVELOPED BY PROFESSIONAL RESEARCH CONSULTANTS. * LED A SERIES OF WORKSHOPS OVER THREE YEARS WITH INTERNAL AND EXTERNAL SPEAKERS PROFICIENT IN CHNAS, IDENTIFYING RELIABLE DATA SOURCES, PRIORITY SETTING, AND SELECTING EVIDENCE-BASED INTERVENTIONS. * SET THE COMMUNITY HEALTH LEADERSHIP COUNCIL'S AGENDAS, A COUNCIL COMPRISED OF COMMUNITY HEALTH STAKEHOLDERS FROM ACROSS ADVOCATE, TO FOCUS ON CHNA OBJECTIVES. * MANAGED HOSPITAL PROGRESS AGAINST SYSTEM ANNUAL TIMELINES TO ACHIEVE THE THREE-YEAR VISION, REQUIRING ANNUAL CHNA PROGRESS REPORTS AND THEIR REVIEW AND ENDORSEMENT BY THE HOSPITAL GOVERNING COUNCILS EACH YEAR. * PROVIDED ONGOING CONSULTATION ON AN AS NEED BASIS THROUGHOUT THE PROCESS. * ENGAGED AND FUNDED AN OUTSIDE CHNA CONSULTANT TO MEET ONE-ON-ONE WITH THE SITE COMMUNITY HEALTH LEADERS AND REVIEW CHNA PROGRESS AND PROVIDE GUIDANCE IN AREAS OF DIFFICULTY OR UNCERTAINTY. * PROVIDED AN OVERVIEW OF THE CHNA RESULTS AND PLANNED INTERVENTIONS TO THE MISSION & SPIRITUAL COMMITTEE OF THE ADVOCATE HEALTH CARE BOARD OF DIRECTORS TO SECURE THE COMMITTEE'S ENDORSEMENT. * A STANDARDIZED FORMAT FOR HOSPITALS TO USE IN DRAFTING THEIR CHNAS AND IMPLEMENTATION PLANS, WHICH SYSTEM LEADERS THEN REVIEWED AND EDITED FOR CONSISTENCY, ACCURACY AND QUALITY OF CONTENT. * WORKED WITH SYSTEM LEVEL MEDIA CENTER AND WEB TEAM TO DEVELOP PLACEMENT AND POSTING OF CHNA REPORTS & IMPLEMENTATION PLANS TO MEET PPACA/IRS REGULATORY REPORTING REQUIREMENTS. * IN PREPARATION FOR THE NEXT CHNA CYCLE, ADVOCATE PURCHASED THE HEALTHY COMMUNITIES INSTITUTE'S CHNA TOOL IN LATE 2013 AND PAID THE ANNUAL FEE FOR ONGOING SUPPORT FOR TRAINING AND THE ADDITION OF 2013 AND 2014 UPDATES AT THE SYSTEM LEVEL. FOR 2015, THE TOOL IS EXPECTED TO ALSO SUPPORT THE WORK OF THE COUNTY CHNA COLLABORATIVES. WITH SUPPORT FROM THE SYSTEM LEVEL, ALL ADVOCATE'S HOSPITALS ARE PARTICIPATING IN THESE COLLABORATIVE ASSESSMENTS WITH OTHER ADVOCATE AND NON-ADVOCATE HOSPITALS AND THEIR COUNTY AND LOCAL PUBLIC HEALTH DEPARTMENTS. THESE COLLABORATIVES REMOVE DUPLICATION OF STAFF TIME AND EFFORT WHILE FORGING AND STRENGTHENING RELATIONSHIPS AMONG PARTICIPATING ORGANIZATIONS, LEVERAGING THEIR ABILITY TO POSITIVELY IMPACT KEY NEEDS AS IDENTIFIED THROUGH THE ASSESSMENT PROCESS. THROUGH ADVOCATE'S HOSPITAL-BASED SERVICES, AS WELL AS ITS PARTICIPATION IN PROVIDING PROGRAMS AND SERVICES IN THE COMMUNITY, ADVOCATE PROMOTES A SHARED APPROACH TO COMMUNITY BENEFITS. IN ADDITION TO HOSPITAL/COMMUNITY SPECIFIC PROGRAMS, THERE ARE ALSO PROGRAMS ADDRESSING NEEDS OF BROAD GEOGRAPHIC PORTIONS OF ADVOCATE'S SERVICE AREA WHICH ARE MANAGED AND FUNDED AT THE SYSTEM LEVEL. THESE PROGRAMS INCLUDE THE FOLLOWING: ADVOCATE'S HEALTHY STEPS PROGRAM SPECIALISTS TOUCHED THE LIVES OF 6,248 YOUNG CHILDREN IN 2014 THROUGH CHILDHOOD PROGRAMS WITHIN PEDIATRIC/FAMILY PRACTICE RESIDENCIES AT ADVOCATE ILLINOIS MASONIC MEDICAL CENTER, AND THE ADVOCATE CHILDREN'S HOSPITAL OAK LAWN AND PARK RIDGE CAMPUSES.

AS A NON-PROFIT HEALTH CARE SYSTEM, ADVOCATE PROVIDES CHARITY AND FINANCIAL ASSISTANCE TO PATIENTS IN NEED. WHILE EACH HOSPITAL HAS A CHARITY CARE COUNCIL TO REVIEW APPLICATIONS AND DETERMINE ELIGIBILITY, SYSTEM FINANCE LEADERS ARE RESPONSIBLE FOR ONGOING POLICY REVIEW AND REFINEMENTS TO ASSURE ADVOCATE CONTINUES TO PROVIDE FINANCIAL ASSISTANCE TO INDIVIDUALS WHO NEED HELP WHEN THEY NEED IT. IN ADDITION, ADVOCATE'S SYSTEM LEADERS ENCOURAGE AND SUPPORT ITS HOSPITALS' INITIATIVES TO PARTNER WITH FEDERALLY QUALIFIED HEALTH CENTERS (FQHC), PUBLIC HEALTH DEPARTMENTS AND COMMUNITY CLINICS IN ORDER TO ASSIST THE UNINSURED IN FINDING INSURANCE COVERAGE AND MEDICAL SERVICES. FOR EXAMPLE, ADVOCATE SOUTH SUBURBAN HOSPITAL HAS A PARTNERSHIP WITH AUNT MARTHA'S YOUTH SERVICE CENTER, AN FQHC, TO IMPROVE ACCESS TO PRIMARY CARE SERVICES FOR UNINSURED AND UNDERINSURED INDIVIDUALS IN ITS SERVICE AREA. ADVOCATE BROMENN MEDICAL CENTER MAINTAINS A COMMUNITY HEALTH CLINIC IN COLLABORATION WITH OSF ST. JOSEPH'S HOSPITAL, WHEREBY ADVOCATE BROMENN MEDICAL CENTER IS RESPONSIBLE FOR A PORTION OF THE HOSPITAL CARE FOR THE CLINIC'S PATIENTS THROUGHOUT THE YEAR. BROMENN IS ALSO THE SOLE PROVIDER OF THE CLINIC'S INFORMATION TECHNOLOGY (IT) SUPPORT AND THE SPACE OCCUPIED BY THE CLINIC. WORKING WITH OTHER AREA HOSPITALS, ADVOCATE GOOD SAMARITAN HOSPITAL PROVIDES SUPPORT THROUGH THE DUPAGE HEALTH COALITION TO SUSTAIN THE ACCESS DUPAGE COMMUNITY PROGRAM - A COMMUNITY COLLABORATION DESIGNED TO PROVIDE LOW-COST PRIMARY MEDICAL CARE SERVICES TO THE LOW-INCOME, MEDICALLY UNINSURED RESIDENTS OF DUPAGE COUNTY. GOAL 3: POSITIVELY AFFECT THE HEALTH STATUS AND QUALITY OF LIFE OF INDIVIDUALS AND POPULATIONS IN COMMUNITIES SERVED BY ADVOCATE THROUGH PROGRAMS AND PRACTICES THAT REFLECT ADVOCATE'S WHOLISTIC PHILOSOPHY. ADVOCATE HAS SEVERAL PROGRAMS AND PRACTICES MANAGED AND FUNDED AT THE SYSTEM LEVEL THAT REFLECT ADVOCATE'S WHOLISTIC PHILOSOPHY. THE OFFICE OF MISSION AND SPIRITUAL CARE, FOR EXAMPLE, HAS PROGRAMS THAT POSITIVELY AFFECT THE HEALTH STATUS AND QUALITY OF LIFE OF INDIVIDUALS, AND THAT ADDRESS DISPARITIES IN ACCESS TO HEALTH AND WELLNESS SERVICES IN THE COMMUNITY. THE CENTER FOR FAITH COMMUNITY HEALTH TRANSFORMATION, FOR EXAMPLE, FORMED FROM THE WORK OF ADVOCATE'S CONGREGATIONAL HEALTH PARTNERSHIPS (CHP) AND THE NEIGHBORHOODS INITIATIVE OF THE UNIVERSITY OF ILLINOIS AT CHICAGO, WAS SELECTED AS A CONTRACTOR FOR THE PARTNERSHIPS TO IMPROVE COMMUNITY HEALTH (PICH) INITIATIVE UNDER THE COOK COUNTY DEPARTMENT OF PUBLIC HEALTH. PICH IS A CDC FUNDED EFFORT TO INCREASE OPPORTUNITIES FOR HEALTHY EATING, PHYSICAL ACTIVITY AND SMOKE-FREE ENVIRONMENTS IN VULNERABLE POPULATIONS IN SUBURBAN COOK COUNTY THROUGH POLICY, SYSTEMS AND ENVIRONMENTAL CHANGE STRATEGIES. THE CENTER IS WORKING WITH FAITH-BASED NETWORKS IN THREE HIGH-RISK PRIORITY COMMUNITY AREAS TO PROVIDE LEADERSHIP IN CREATING A CULTURE OF HEALTH FOR CONGREGATIONAL MEMBERS AND FOR THE COMMUNITIES THEY SERVE. OF PARTICULAR INTEREST IS A PARTNERSHIP WITH THE FOREST PRESERVE OF COOK COUNTY (FPCC) TO CONNECT FAITH COMMUNITIES WITH FPCC RESOURCES THAT WILL ALLOW THEIR MEMBERS, ESPECIALLY CHILDREN AND YOUTH, TO BE PHYSICALLY ACTIVE IN NATURE. ADVOCATE PARISH NURSE MINISTRY - AS PART OF ADVOCATE'S MISSION AND SPIRITUAL CARE DEPARTMENT, PARISH NURSE MINISTY REALIZES THE VISION OF WHOLISTIC HEALING AND WELLNESS BY PARTNERING WITH DIVERSE FAITH COMMUNITIES IN AN EFFORT TO EMBRACE THE INTEGRATION OF FAITH AND HEALTH. THE PURPOSE OF ADVOCATE PARISH NURSE MINISTRY IS TO NURTURE THE HUMAN SPIRIT THROUGH HEALTH EDUCATION, SPIRITUAL SUPPORT, AND TO LINK THE NEEDS OF THE WHOLE PERSON TO RESOURCES WITHIN THE CONGREGATION, COMMUNITY, AND THE HEALTH CARE SYSTEM. AS PART OF ADVOCATE HEALTH CARE'S CONTINUUM OF CARE, THE PARISH NURSE MINISTRY IS WORKING IN OVER 30 DIVERSE CONGREGATIONS. THESE FAITH COMMUNITIES ARE WIDELY SCATTERED THROUGHOUT THE CHICAGOLAND AREA FROM ROSELAND AND CHICAGO UPTOWN NEIGHBORHOODS TO THE SUBURBAN SETTINGS OF ARLINGTON HEIGHTS AND NAPERVILLE. ADVOCATE PARISH NURSE MINISTRY CONTINUES TO SEEK HEALTH MINISTRY PARTNERSHIPS. BOTH PARTNERS, THE HEALTH CARE INSTITUTION AND THE CONGREGATION MUST ESPOUSE THE BELIEF THAT PHYSICAL, EMOTIONAL, INTELLECTUAL, AND SOCIAL WELL-BEING ARE VERY MUCH DEPENDENT ON A HEALTHY SPIRITUAL CORE OF BEING. ADVOCATE CONGREGATIONAL HEALTH PARTNERSHIPS (CHP) - CHP BUILDS ON THE LEGACY OF THOSE WHO HAVE GONE BEFORE BY WORKING WITH FAITH COMMUNITIES TO PROMOTE HEALTH AND WHOLENESS FOR THEIR MEMBERS AND COMMUNITIES. THE PROGRAMS AND SERVICES THAT CHP OFFERS INCLUDE: * BASIC AND ADVANCED TRAINING IN HEALTH MINISTRY DEVELOPMENT * CONSULTATION AROUND THE DEVELOPMENT OF CONGREGATIONAL HEALTH PROGRAMS * PRACTICAL TOOLS AND MATERIALS * BULLETIN INSERTS * RESOURCE LIBRARY * NEWSLETTER * CONGREGATIONAL HEALTH ASSESSMENT PROGRAM * MANUAL * PROGRAM COMPONENTS * THE CENTER FOR FAITH AND COMMUNITY HEALTH TRANSFORMATION (THE CENTER) IS THE JOINT WORK OF ADVOCATE'S CHP AND THE NEIGHBORHOODS INITIATIVE OF THE UNIVERSITY OF ILLINOIS AT CHICAGO. THE CENTER FORMED IN 2009 OUT OF A GROWING CONCERN IN CHICAGO'S FAITH AND HEALTH MOVEMENT ABOUT THE WAYS IN WHICH SOCIAL CONDITIONS-POVERTY, RACISM, UNEMPLOYMENT, LACK OF ACCESS TO CARE-IMPACT PEOPLE'S HEALTH. THE CENTER WAS CREATED TO MOBILIZE FAITH COMMUNITIES TO CHANGE THE SOCIAL CONDITIONS THAT AFFECT PEOPLE'S HEALTH. THE CENTER ALSO HOSTS A WEBSITE THAT SERVES AS A GATHERING PLACE FOR THE FAITH AND HEALTH MOVEMENT TO SHARE INFORMATION, POST EVENTS, SHARE INTERESTING PROJECTS, RESOURCES AND IDEAS, AND KEEP IN TOUCH WITH WHAT OTHERS ARE DOING. GO TO WWW.CHICAGOFAITHANDHEALTH.ORG FOR MORE INFORMATION. ADVOCATE ALSO PROVIDES A SYSTEM-WIDE TELEPHONE REFERRAL AND RESOURCE INFORMATION CENTER TO ASSIST PATIENTS AND COMMUNITY MEMBERS IN FINDING HEALTHCARE PROVIDERS AND OTHER HEALTH AND WELLNESS RESOURCES. THE CENTER'S STAFF SERVES AS A COMMUNITY RESOURCE, PROVIDING INDIVIDUALS FROM THE COMMUNITY WITH REFERRALS TO GOVERNMENT-FUNDED AND COMMUNITY-BASED NON-ADVOCATE PROGRAMS AND SERVICES, AS WELL AS ADVOCATE HEALTH CARE PHYSICIANS AND SERVICES. IN 2014, THE CENTER HANDLED 19,656 CALLS FROM THE COMMUNITY THAT WERE REDIRECTED TO NON-ADVOCATE COMMUNITY RESOURCES TO ASSIST THEM IN GETTING THE HELP THEY NEED."
201533179349304323,362169147,GOAL 4: LEVERAGE RESOURCES AND MAXIMIZE COMMUNITY OUTREACH EFFORTS BY,"BUILDING AND STRENGTHENING COMMUNITY PARTNERSHIPS. ADVOCATE'S SYSTEM LEVEL LEADERS MAINTAIN AND CONTINUE TO ACTIVELY EXPAND SYSTEM PARTNERSHIPS AND RELATIONSHIPS WITH A WIDE VARIETY OF ORGANIZATIONS, INCLUDING RELIGIOUS ORGANIZATIONS, NEIGHBORHOOD GROUPS AND OUTREACH AND RESOURCE PROGRAMS. THESE RELATIONSHIPS SERVE TO LEVERAGE BOTH ADVOCATE'S AND ITS COMMUNITIES' RESOURCES TO MAXIMIZE COMMUNITY OUTREACH EFFORTS. ADVOCATE BUILDS ON RELATIONSHIPS THAT ASSOCIATES AND AFFILIATED PHYSICIANS HAVE WITH COMMUNITY HEALTH PARTNERS, AND TO EMPOWER THE DEVELOPMENT OF SUCH PARTNERSHIPS. AN EXAMPLE OF THIS IS ADVOCATE MEDICAL GROUP'S (ADVOCATE-EMPLOYED PHYSICIANS) ANNUAL COLLABORATION WITH SPECIAL OLYMPICS OF ILLINOIS. THIS EVENT, MEDFEST, PROVIDES PEOPLE WITH INTELLECTUAL DISABILITIES OPPORTUNITIES TO PARTICIPATE IN SPORTS TRAINING AND COMPETITIONS, CREATING AVENUES FOR INCLUSION AND ACCEPTANCE FOR THIS SPECIAL NEEDS UNDERSERVED POPULATION. IN ADDITION TO PROVIDING EASY ACCESS TO PHYSICALS FOR ATHLETES, THE FREE CLINICAL SERVICES RESULT IN ENHANCED PHYSICAL FITNESS AND COMFORT WITH THE MEDICAL COMMUNITY. AMG PROVIDED 1,651 FREE ATHLETIC PHYSICALS TO SPECIAL OLYMPIANS FOR THE 17TH YEAR IN 2014, THUS ALLOWING THESE SPECIAL ATHLETES OPPORTUNITIES TO PARTICIPATE IN COMPETITIONS THROUGHOUT THE YEAR. SYSTEM LEVEL MANAGEMENT ALSO OVERSEES ASSOCIATE AND PHYSICIAN FUNDRAISING AND VOLUNTEER ACTIVITIES RELATED TO COMMUNITY ORGANIZATIONS AND PARTNERSHIPS. LAST YEAR ADVOCATE PROMOTED AND SUPPORTED ASSOCIATE, PHYSICIAN AND HOSPITAL PARTICIPATION IN WALKS, RUNS AND BICYCLE RACES FOR THE AMERICAN HEART ASSOCIATION, AMERICAN CANCER SOCIETY, AMERICAN DIABETES ASSOCIATION, ALZHEIMER'S ASSOCIATION AND MARCH OF DIMES. IN 2014, $536,283 IN CHARITABLE CONTRIBUTIONS WAS RAISED TO SUPPORT THESE PARTNER ORGANIZATIONS. ADVOCATE ASSOCIATES' SUPPORT IS ALSO DEMONSTRATED THROUGH THEIR OWN, PERSONAL AND GENEROUS CONTRIBUTIONS DURING THE ASSOCIATE GIVING CAMPAIGN WHICH RESULTED IN OVER $2.3 MILLION BEING RAISED TO SUPPORT MULTIPLE LOCAL COMMUNITY ORGANIZATIONS, PROGRAMS AND INITIATIVES, INCLUDING SOME OF ADVOCATE'S OWN SYSTEM-WIDE AND HOSPITAL-BASED COMMUNITY HEALTH PROGRAMS. SYSTEM MANAGEMENT OF FUNDRAISING ACTIVITIES REDUCES DUPLICATION OF EFFORT AND ASSURES THAT FUNDRAISING IS CONDUCTED WITH ORGANIZATIONS THAT ALIGN WITH ADVOCATE'S MISSION AND ARE EFFECTIVE IN ADDRESSING ADVOCATE'S SERVICE AREA'S COMMUNITY HEALTH NEEDS. THE ADVOCATE CHARITABLE FOUNDATION (ACF) WORKS TO FIND INNOVATIVE WAYS TO FUND NOT ONLY CLINICAL ADVANCEMENTS BUT COMMUNITY PROGRAMS THAT ADDRESS IDENTIFIED COMMUNITY NEEDS. ONE EXAMPLE OF THIS IS ACF'S ADMINISTRATION OF THE ADVOCATE BETHANY COMMUNITY HEALTH FUND. IN 2006, ADVOCATE HEALTH CARE ESTABLISHED THE BETHANY FUND AS PART OF ADVOCATE'S ONGOING COMMITMENT TO SUPPORT LOCAL NONPROFIT ORGANIZATIONS AS THEY BUILD, PROMOTE AND SUSTAIN HEALTHY COMMUNITIES ON CHICAGO'S WEST SIDE. THE ADVOCATE BETHANY COMMUNITY HEALTH FUND BOARD, WHICH IS COMPRISED OF EIGHT COMMUNITY MEMBERS FROM THE TARGETED COMMUNITY AREAS AND SEVEN REPRESENTATIVES FROM ADVOCATE HEALTH CARE, AWARDED MORE THAN $715,000 IN GRANTS AND CAPACITY-BUILDING SERVICES TO 32 ORGANIZATIONS ACROSS ITS FUND COMMUNITIES IN 2014. SINCE THE BOARD'S INSTALLATION IN 2007, THE BETHANY COMMUNITY HEALTH FUND HAS AWARDED NEARLY $6 MILLION IN PROGRAM DOLLARS AND SERVICES TO ORGANIZATIONS THAT PROMOTE HEALTH AND WELLNESS WITH A FOCUS ON ADDRESSING HEALTH DISPARITIES FOR RESIDENTS OF CHICAGO'S WEST SIDE. ADVOCATE HEALTH CARE HAS ALSO BEEN A KEY PARTNER IN THE NATIONAL COLLABORATIVE, THE HEALTH SYSTEMS LEARNING GROUP (HSLG), NOW KNOWN AS THE STAKEHOLDER HEALTH GROUP. THIS GROUP IS A SELF-ORGANIZED COLLABORATIVE OF 43 ORGANIZATIONS (INCLUDING 36 NON-PROFIT HEALTH SYSTEMS) THAT HAVE ENGAGED IN A SERIES OF MEETINGS ACROSS THE COUNTRY OVER THE PAST FOUR YEARS. INSPIRED BY THE PASSAGE OF THE PATIENT PROTECTION AND AFFORDABLE CARE ACT, AND MOTIVATED BY THE RECOGNITION OF THE NEED TO TRANSFORM OUR ORGANIZATIONS AND OUR COMMUNITIES, THE GROUP MADE A COMMITMENT TO ACCELERATE THIS TRANSFORMATIONAL PROCESS THROUGH ONGOING SHARING OF INNOVATIVE PRACTICES THAT IMPROVE POPULATION HEALTH AND THE DEVELOPMENT OF COORDINATED STRATEGIES THAT TAKE INNOVATION TO SCALE. THE HEALTH SYSTEMS LEARNING GROUP ASPIRES TO IDENTIFY AND ACTIVATE A MENU OF PROVEN COMMUNITY HEALTH PRACTICES AND PARTNERSHIPS THAT WORK FROM THE TOP OF THE MISSION STATEMENT TO THE BOTTOM LINE. THE CREATION OF THIS LEARNING COLLABORATIVE WAS SPARKED BY A SERIES OF STAKEHOLDER MEETINGS AT THE WHITE HOUSE OFFICE AND DEPARTMENT OF HEALTH & HUMAN SERVICES CENTER FOR FAITH-BASED & NEIGHBORHOOD PARTNERSHIPS. THE HSLG PARTNERS HAVE CONTRIBUTED SUBSTANTIAL FINANCIAL AND IN-KIND RESOURCES TO SUPPORT THE 2 YEAR DEVELOPMENTAL PHASE. IN ADDITION, A GENEROUS GRANT WAS PROVIDED BY THE ROBERT WOOD JOHNSON FOUNDATION TO SUPPORT THE DISSEMINATION OF FINDINGS AND LESSONS LEARNED DURING THIS PERIOD. THE FIRST PHASE OF DEVELOPMENT FOR THE HSLG CULMINATED WITH A CONVENING ON APRIL 4, 2013, CO-HOSTED WITH THE WHITE HOUSE AND HHS CENTER FOR FAITH-BASED AND NEIGHBORHOOD PARTNERSHIPS, ALONG WITH THE CHIEF EXECUTIVE OFFICERS FROM MANY OF THE HEALTH SYSTEM PARTNERS. THE PURPOSE WAS TO REVIEW FINDINGS FROM THE PAST 18 MONTHS OF INQUIRY AND DIALOGUE AND TO CONSIDER A CALL TO ACTION ON A SPECIFIC SET OF RECOMMENDATIONS. SEE THE FOLLOWING LINK FOR THE MONOGRAPH PRESENTED AT THE MEETING. HTTP://WWW.METHODISTHEALTH.ORG/DOTASSET/9E6F77D8-DF4B-4545-B2F3-BC77B106F9 69.PDF ADVOCATE CONTINUED TO PARTICIPATE IN STAKEHOLDER HEALTH MEETINGS AND LEADERSHIP IN 2014. THIS INCLUDED A MONETARY CONTRIBUTION TO SUPPORT THE SHARED ADMINISTRATIVE AND WEBSITE COSTS OF THE COLLABORATIVE. IN THE FALL OF 2015, ADVOCATE WILL HOST THE GROUP IN CHICAGO FOR A THREE-DAY MEETING. GOAL 5: PROMOTE INTEGRATION OF AND ACCOUNTABILITY FOR SYSTEM AND SITE PLANS AND ACTIVITIES BY ENHANCING COORDINATION AND DEVELOPING GOVERNANCE RELATIONSHIPS. A CORE GROUP OF ADVOCATE SYSTEM-LEVEL LEADERS ACHIEVED INTEGRATION, ACCOUNTABILITY AND NEW GOVERNANCE RELATIONSHIPS THROUGH IMPLEMENTATION OF THE FOLLOWING: * STRENGTHENING THE ROLE/VISIBILITY OF THE COMMUNITY HEALTH LEADERSHIP COUNCIL - A KEY FOCUS FOR THE SYSTEM CORE TEAM WAS TO STRENGTHEN THE ABILITY OF THE COMMUNITY HEALTH LEADERSHIP COUNCIL (CHLC) TO SERVE AS A RESOURCE AND PROVIDE GUIDANCE IN DEVELOPING AND IMPLEMENTING SYSTEM AND SITE COMMUNITY HEALTH PLANS. THE FOLLOWING ACTIONS WERE TAKEN TO REALIZE THIS OBJECTIVE * THE CHLC ROLE WAS DEFINED, A CHARTER APPROVED AND THE ROLE WAS COMMUNICATED AS APPROPRIATE WITHIN ADVOCATE AND IN THE COMMUNITY. MEETINGS WERE SCHEDULED MONTHLY TO ASSURE CLOSE COMMUNICATION AND ADHERENCE TO THE AMBITIOUS TIMELINE. * AS DESCRIBED EARLIER, THE COMMUNITY HEALTH STEERING COMMITTEE WAS CONVENED TO PLAN THE CHLC'S ACTIVITIES, I.E., SET AGENDAS, PROVIDE WORKSHOPS, TIMELINES AND DEADLINES TO ASSURE THE HOSPITALS AND THE SYSTEM MET THEIR GOALS AND WOULD BE FULLY COMPLIANT WITH THE PPACA. * REPORTING COMMUNITY HEALTH/COMMUNITY BENEFITS PLANNING, PROGRESS, AND ACHIEVEMENTS TO THE MISSION AND SPIRITUAL CARE COMMITTEE OF THE ADVOCATE BOARD OF DIRECTORS IN TANDEM WITH REPORTING COMMUNITY BENEFITS EXPENDITURES TO THE FINANCE COMMITTEE OF THE BOARD. WHEN CONSIDERING WHICH GOVERNANCE BODY WOULD BE ACCOUNTABLE FOR REVIEWING AND ENDORSING THE HOSPITAL CHNA REPORTS AND IMPLEMENTATION PLANS, THE HOSPITAL GOVERNING COUNCILS WERE SELECTED GIVEN THEY ARE THE SENIOR GOVERNING BODY AT EACH HOSPITAL. ONE OR MORE MEMBERS OF THE HOSPITAL GOVERNING COUNCILS WERE ALSO RECRUITED TO PARTICIPATE ON THEIR SITE'S COMMUNITY HEALTH COUNCIL, SERVING AS BOTH A COMMUNITY REPRESENTATIVE HAVING INPUT INTO THE DECISIONS OF THE COMMUNITY HEALTH COUNCIL AND AS A GOVERNING COUNCIL MEMBER THAT COULD PROVIDE REPORTS ON COMMUNITY HEALTH PLAN PROGRESS BACK TO THE GOVERNING COUNCIL. THIS PROCESS WORKED WELL AND ADVOCATE POSTED ITS HOSPITALS' FIRST CHNA REPORT ON ITS WEBSITE IN DECEMBER 2013, AND THE POSTING OF THE HOSPITALS' IMPLEMENTATION PLANS OCCURRED BEFORE MAY 15, 2014, IN COMPLIANCE WITH THE PATIENT PROTECTION AND AFFORDABLE CARE ACT'S REQUIREMENTS AS OUTLINED IN THE PROPOSED RULE FOR TAX-EXEMPT HOSPITALS. ADDITIONALLY, IN ORDER TO PROVIDE A COMMUNITY BENEFITS COST REPORT TO THE FINANCE COMMITTEE OF THE ADVOCATE BOARD OF DIRECTORS AND IN COMPLIANCE WITH ILLINOIS' COMMUNITY BENEFITS ACT, ADVOCATE ANNUALLY TRACKS THE COSTS OF ITS COMMUNITY HEALTH EFFORTS USING AN ADVOCATE INTRANET-BASED COMMUNITY BENEFITS WORKSHEET REPORTING APPLICATION. THE SOFTWARE APPLICATION, WHICH WAS DEVELOPED AND IS MANAGED AT THE SYSTEM LEVEL, NOT ONLY TRACKS THE COSTS OF COMMUNITY-FOCUSED PROGRAMS AND SERVICES, BUT ALSO CAPTURES THE LIVES TOUCHED AND SERVICES ADMINISTERED IN THE CATEGORIES SPECIFIED IN ILLINOIS' COMMUNITY BENEFITS ACT. COMMUNITY BENEFITS EDUCATION AND SOFTWARE TRAINING CLASSES AND REFRESHER COURSES ARE PROVIDED BY THE SYSTEM AT ADVOCATE'S HOSPITALS AND OTHER KEY SITES AS NEEDED. THE TRACKING OF COMMUNITY BENEFIT"

THE HEALTHY SUNDAYS PROGRAM, WHICH PROVIDES FREE HEALTH SCREENINGS AND EDUCATION TO THE UNDERSERVED FOLLOWING WORSHIP SERVICES, SERVES AS A PRIMARY SOURCE OF PUBLIC PARTICIPATION, AS COMMUNITY NEEDS SURVEYS (AVAILABLE IN ENGLISH AND SPANISH) ARE OFTEN DISTRIBUTED AT THESE SCREENING SITES. THUS, EVERY POINT OF CONTACT DOUBLES AS AN OPPORTUNITY TO REQUEST FEEDBACK ON HOW THE HOSPITAL CAN BETTER MEET THE NEEDS OF THE COMMUNITY. THESE EVENTS ARE PROMOTED VIA CALENDAR LISTINGS IN PARISH BULLETINS AND FLYERS POSTED IN PLACES OF BUSINESS AND WORSHIP IN THE COMMUNITY SURROUNDING THE OUTREACH SITE AND ON CHS'S WEBSITE. IN WORKING WITH THE AMERICAN DIABETES ASSOCIATION, AMERICAN ASSOCIATION OF DIABETES EDUCATORS, HOSPITAL MEDICAL STAFF AND OTHER CHS HOSPITALS, MERCY HOPES TO REDUCE INPATIENT HOSPITALIZATIONS BY PROMOTING DIABETES AWARENESS AND EDUCATION THROUGH COMMUNITY LECTURES, SUPPORT GROUPS AND SELF-MANAGEMENT CLASSES. COMMUNITY HEALTH NEEDS ARE DISCUSSED AND ASSESSED ON A CONTINUAL BASIS BY THE PLANNING COMMITTEE, BOARD OF TRUSTEES, MERCY SENIOR LEADERSHIP AND VARIOUS COMMITTEES WITHIN THE HOSPITAL SUCH AS THE MISSION AND MINISTRY/COMMUNITY OUTREACH COMMITTEE AND THE CANCER COMMITTEE, BOTH OF WHICH HAVE MULTIDISCIPLINARY REPRESENTATION OF HOSPITAL STAFF.

The unpaid patient accounts are then sent to collection agencies and any collected amount is deemed as bad debt recovery. The source of this data is the hospital's detailed financial trial balance.

SCHEDULE H, PART III, SECTION A, LINE 3 METHOLODOGY & RATIONALE USED TO DETERMINE BAD DEBT ATTRIBUTABLE TO PATIENT'S ELIGIBLE UNDER ORGANIZATION'S FAP: The bad debt attributable to patients eligible under the hospital's financial assistance program is determined using a weekly bad debt conversion report for a period of twelve months.

ASU 2011-07 requires the reclassification of the provision for uncollectible accounts associated with patient service revenue from an operating expense to a deduction from patient service revenue (net of contractual allowances and discounts)."" ""Wellstar recognizes patient service revenue associated with services provided to patients with third-party payor coverage on the basis of contractual rates for the services rendered. For uninsured patients that do not qualify for community financial aid, Wellstar recognizes revenue on the basis of its discounted rates for services provided. On the basis of historical experience, a significant portion of Wellstar's uninsured patients are unable or unwilling to pay for the services provided. Thus, Wellstar records a significant provision for uncollectible accounts related to uninsured patients in the period the services are provided."" Subsequent to the end of the reporting period a propensity to pay review of patient accounts often results in prior year bad debt accounts which are deemed eligible for the organization's financial assistance policy. Those bad debt accounts are reclassified as charity and thus our rationale for including in community benefit."

MAPP, developed by the National Association of County and City Health Officials (""NACCHO"") in collaboration with the CDC, provides a structured guidance on creating and implementing a community-wide strategic planning process focused on improving the health and safety of our population. Through MAPP, a broad collection of community partners and residents come together to identify and prioritize health and safety issues and to identify resources for addressing them. The process results in an actionable community health improvement plan (CHIP) for measurable improvements in the community's health and quality of life as well as a scorecard for implementation and evaluation. The resulting community plan does not focus on one agency or community health challenge; rather, MAPP provides a long-term strategy that addresses the multiple factors that affect health in the community. Community involvement throughout the creation and the implementation of a health improvement plan results in creative solutions to community health problems with an improved focus on priorities, reduced duplication of services, increased collaboration on projects and activities, and increased capacity to garner additional resources.

201601339349301805,231352222,Part VI - Needs Assessment,"WellSpan Health and its entities, including WellSpan Surgery & Rehabilitation Hospital) have a long history of understanding and responding to the needs of the community and populations it serves. This commitment was strengthened in 1994 when, in partnership with the Healthy York County Coalition, the county health coalition, WellSpan conducted its first Community Health Needs Assessment (CHNA). Four subsequent assessments have been conducted (2000, 2005, 2008 and 2012), and the next one is planned for 2015. A CHNA is one method for collecting diverse information on a community and involves surveying a large quantity of residents on health, lifestyle behaviors, finances, access to health services, and other related topics. The WellSpan CHNA process, including survey development, data collection and analysis, and result dissemination, is led by both county-level health coalitions. These entities receive financial support from WellSpan Health and its entities, as well as other community stakeholders. Although not new to WellSpan and the communities it serves, the Patient Protection and Affordable Care Act of 2010 (PPACA) required that all non-profit, tax exempt hospitals in the United States conduct a Community Health Needs Assessment every three years, determine health priorities, and prepare a multi-year strategic plan to address selected priorities. WellSpans nearly two decade history of conducting CHNAs has ably prepared it to respond to these new requirements. As in prior years, the Executive Directors of Healthy Adams County and the Healthy York County Coalition co-led the 2012 CHNA. Conducting a community-wide CHNA requires input from diverse stakeholders in the community and commitment to the overall process. The following community organizations partnered to provide guidance and support to the 2012 CHNA: Adams-Hanover Counseling Services, Family First Health, Gettysburg College, Hanover Hospital, Memorial Hospital, United Way Adams County, United Way of York County, WellSpan Health, York City Health Bureau, York College of Pennsylvania,and York County Community Foundation Additional support was provided through a contract with the Floyd Institute for Public Policy at Franklin and Marshall College. Dr. Berwood Yost, Institute Director and Project Consultant for the 2012 CHNA, has an extensive background conducting and analyzing community and corporate surveys, and was well-positioned to lead the 2012 Adams and York County CHNA. This collaboration of community stakeholders: determined the battery of survey questions to be asked; discussed data collection methodology, including sample size and method of obtaining data reviewed the raw data and supporting charts and graphs, and; identified the priority setting process to be utilized in community forums. Since the 2012 CHNA planning committee represented a wide range of community organizations services, it was important that the CHNA capture the interests of all partners without burdening the community with too many questions. Committee members initially listed topics of interest and reviewed related questions primarily derived from the Behavioral Risk Factor Surveillance System (BRFSS). These questions were previously validated and utilized by the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) in national and state-wide survey instruments. Selected questions were then organized into four key areas access, health behaviors, health conditions, and prevention behaviors as determined by the CHNA planning committee. A total of 1004 York County adults were interviewed between September 26 and November 9, 2011, and served as a representative sample of the adult, non-institutionalized population in Adams County. Supplemental data was compiled to expand upon the data collected from interviewees and enabled the development of a comprehensive CHNA. Example of additional data collected included: demographic information from the U.S. Census Bureau; trending data related to lifestyle and health derived from the Pennsylvania Department of Health (DOH); vital statistics related to birth and death rates, also from the Pennsylvania Department of Health, and; healthcare quality and cost data from the Pennsylvania Health Care Cost Containment Council (PHC4). Data analyzed by the Floyd Institute for Public Policy included breakdowns by age, gender, geographic area, race/ethnicity, and income level. Additional cross-tabulations were conducted to demonstrate the complexities of some of the most striking CHNA results, such as the influence of disparities on particular variables. Results were shared with the CHNA planning committee in PowerPoint presentation and written reporting formats. Subsequent reports were modified slightly before dissemination at community forums in June 2012 and their availability on the website of both health coalitions.WellSpan Health is fortunate in that many community members are interested in the current and future health of York County. In order to facilitate community support on key health issues, the 2012 CHNA planning committee reviewed the CHNA results and developed an initial list of community health priorities, based on: * Who is affected? (The prevalence and reach of the health issue or concern); * How will we react? (The ability of the community to respond to the priority); * How many people can we help? (The number of potential community members influenced by the priority); * What happens if we dont respond? (The consequences of not responding to the priority), and; * What disparities exist and how can we ensure that the disparities will be addressed?A similar approach was used by WellSpan Health and its Community Benefit Council when identifying community health priorities for the integrated healthcare system. Council members reviewed the CHNA results and ranked key indicators in each of the four focus areas access, health behaviors, health conditions, and prevention behaviors according to the same questions listed above. In addition, Council members were made aware of the health priorities selected by the community at-large in order to identify opportunities to support community-wide efforts to address key issues."
201601339349301805,231352222,Part VI - Patient Education of Eligibility for Assistance,"For more than a decade, our organization has been working to improve access to care - based on the community health assessment's prioritization of medical, dental and oral health access as high. A key element of our strategy in addressing this need is to reach beyond simply informing patients about our patient assistance policies to proactively identifying patients without access and connecting them to available public and community programs. WellSpan sponsors case managers within Healthy York Network (HYN) to support patient enrollment in public programs (i.e., Medicaid), health insurance marketplace options or in its own HYN discounted care program, which is based on the charity care guidelines of health care providers. In this time of healthcare reform, Healthy York Network has focused on communicating changes clearly to members and has provided support in directing members to the health insurance marketplace and other resources. Patient education is also provided by identifying special resources for at risk populations, including members of racial and ethnic minority communities, and supporting lay Community Health Workers to guide people toward enrollment options. Finally, through a multi-year initiative to ensure awareness among all people who qualify for charity care and financial assistance, our website has been updated, our enrollment processes and late bill communications have been simplified, the provision and availability of financial support resources at high visibility care sites has improved, and our partnership with our local Federally Qualified Health Center (FQHC) for early identification and qualification of patients has been strengthened."
201601339349301805,231352222,Part VI - Community Information,"To the casual observer, our service area could be described as one community. The combined population of York and Adams counties is over 545,000 people. This population is expected to increase by 4% or 21,000 people over the next five years. The York/Adams population is growing older. While the 18-44 age group comprises the largest segment of the population, this group will experience nominal growth through 2017. Most growth will occur in the 45-64 (4% or 6,300 people) and the 65+ (18% or 14,000 people) age groups. This shift is occurring as the baby boom generation ages, as people live longer due to healthy lifestyles and medical advances, and as retirees move from the Baltimore/Washington metro area to Southern York and Adams counties to find a safer, lower cost lifestyle. Although the overall population growth projected for the York/Adams area over the next five years is moderate, the changing demographic profile of the population will result in elevated incidence rates for both acute and chronic disorders that present themselves ever increasingly as the population ages. York County is situated in south-central Pennsylvania, and is bordered by Adams and Cumberland counties to the west and north respectively, and the Susquehanna River and Lancaster County to the east. Northeast of the river lies Dauphin County and the southern border is the Mason-Dixon line which forms the border with Maryland and its northernmost counties of Carroll, Baltimore and Harford. York County is approximately 911 square miles or 583,040 acres and is comprised of 72 municipalities; 35 townships, 36 boroughs and one (1) city.Generally and historically, employment rates are better than state and national averages but the composition of the workforce contains more manufacturing, production and tourism related business. An assessment of general health status is gathered as part of Community Health Assessments. The percent of adults in York County rating their health as fair or poor was 14.0%. Our in-depth knowledge of the community, gathered through community health assessments and focused studies during the past 15 years, however, show that our service area is not made up of one community but of many, with social and health factors that are significantly impacting its health. The number of uninsured has remained stable at approximately 6.5% but continues to be a major barrier to access to oral health, medical care and pharmaceuticals, and the incidence of chronic disease in on the rise."
201601339349301805,231352222,Part VI - Explanation Of How Organization Furthers Its Exempt Purpose,"Historically, WellSpan Health and its entities have taken planned steps to build community capacity that addresses complex health issues, as identified by the Community Health Needs Assessment (CHNA). Through financial and management support of a county health coalition, the Healthy York County Coalition (HYCC), more than 200 York County community members have been engaged in community health improvement initiatives. HYCC consists of three committees Access and Empowerment; Community Engagement, and; Prevention and Wellness, each of which continue to attract new community members, leaders, and professionals. These committees foster partnerships and collaboration between entities to ensure that efforts to address and impact identified community health needs are coordinated and successful. In response to results from the 2012 CHNA, WellSpan Surgery & Rehabilitation Hospital and the Healthy York County Coalition partnered with community organizations across York and neighboring Adams County to address the increasing prevalence of depression in the region. Feeling Blue, an online depression awareness campaign (www.feeling-blue.com), was launched in November 2014 and continues to demonstrate increased online traffic (viewer hits). The campaign is designed to encourage individuals who are feeling blue or suffering from mild depression to engage in non-medical means of managing their symptoms (i.e., healthy eating, increased physical activity, social support). WellSpan Health and its entities, through the Healthy York County Coalition, also developed a comprehensive approach to educating York County residents about end-of-life planning and care, or Horizon Planning as it is termed locally. Through end-of-life documentary screenings, community dialogues, and educational resource distribution, both organizations seek to create a comfortable environment to share information and create a community conversation about this important issue. Hundreds of York County residents have participated in community-focused events and have obtained valuable information to assist them with personal end-of-life decision-making.As a charitable, community-based healthcare organization, our commitment to improving the lives and well-being of the people and communities we serve is evident in our mission statement: Working as one to improve health through exceptional care for all, lifelong wellness, and healthier communities. Employees live out this mission statement every day by engaging in community benefit activities that address community needs, especially the four health priorities identified in the 2012 CHNA adult overweight/obesity; access to care; depression, and; tobacco use. One example of this commitment may be found in the development and implementation of the 10Lb. Throwdown, a 10-week community challenge that encourages participants to lose or maintain a healthy weight through healthier eating and increased physical activity. The initiative was created to address the growing issue of adult overweight/obesity, and utilizes a core website (www.10poundthrowdown.com) on which may be found an online weight tracker, physical activity program (Make the Most of the Coast), and tips that promote a healthier lifestyle. More than 1900 community members across three southcentral Pennsylvania counties Adams, Lancaster, and Lebanon participated in the 2015 iteration of the 10Lb. Throwdown Lastly, WellSpan Health continues to address tobacco use by providing community-based cessation and prevention services throughout York and Adams counties, as one component of a grant from the American Lung Association (ALA). Community members are also vital to furthering our exempt purpose by actively volunteering their time and donating financial resources to health-related initiatives. During the fiscal year, approximately 2,000 individuals volunteered more than 170,000 hours of service across WellSpan Health. The value of those volunteer hours totals in excess of $3.9 million. In addition, the York Health Foundation, raised nearly $4.078 million to support initiatives such as: behavioral health support at select primary care offices; implementation of countywide tobacco prevention and cessation services; training for additional SAFE (Sexual Assault Forensic Exam) nurses to care for victims of abuse, and; funding to assist with rent, food, transportation and utility needs of cancer patients."

201611339349306046,470757164,"Schedule H, Part I, Line 3c Eligibility criteria for free or discounted care","When Catholic Health Initiatives (the ultimate parent organization to Alegent Creighton Health system) established its financial assistance policy it was determined that establishing a household income scale based on the HUD very low income guidelines more accurately reflects the socioeconomic dispersions among urban and rural communities in 18 states served by CHI hospitals and health care facilities. In comparing HUD guidelines to the Federal Poverty Guidelines (FPG), we find that on average HUD guidelines compute to approximately 200% to 250% (and sometimes 300%) of FPG. Alegent Creighton Health system bases its financial assistance eligibility on HUD's 130% of Very Low Income Guidelines based on geography, and affords the uninsured and underinsured the ability to obtain financial assistance write-offs, based on a sliding scale, ranging from 25%-100% of charges. An individual's income under the HUD guidelines is a significant factor in determining eligibility for financial assistance. However, in determining whether to extend discounted or free care to a patient, the patient's assets may also be taken into consideration. For example, a patient suffering a catastrophic illness may have a reasonable level of income, but a low level of liquid assets such that the payment of medical bills would be seriously detrimental to the patient's basic financial (and ultimately physical) well-being and survival. Such a patient may be extended discounted or free care based upon the facts and circumstances."

This initiative has had a primary focus of impact in Douglas County, but the funding to underwrite has come from the fiscal performance of all Alegent Creighton Health hospitals. The community coalition known as Live Well Omaha Kids (LWOK) is staffed and funded by Alegent Creighton Health. An Executive Committee consisting of community leaders and policy makers have directed an ecological approach to improve programs, policies and the built environment to promote physical activity and healthy eating and build capacity for healthy choices at the individual and organizational level. More than 200 volunteers and 90 organizations have participated in the planning and implementation of LWOK initiatives. A portion of this investment in LWOK is allocated to the hospitals on a net service revenue basis. * Community and economic development including support of local Chambers of Commerce * Strategic planning and consulting services for community * Sponsorship of community not for profits and fundraising events * Support of international health ministries in Tanzania and Dominican Republic * Support of the federally qualified healthcare centers * Parish nursing program; supporting 40 congregations * Community health fairs, support groups and community education * School based healthcare services * Leadership in and funding of health coalitions including- * Live Well Omaha-a coalition founded by ACH and the county health department that serves as convener of business, healthcare and community leaders to review health trends and catalyze community action to address health issues. Alegent Creighton Health serves on the Board of Directors, is a member at the highest level and leases staff to Live Well Omaha. * Live Well Pottawattamie County -an emerging coalition to address obesity in Pottawattamie County. ACH provides strategic planning, grant writing and staff support. * Omaha by Design- a coalition that support healthy and sustainable community development and land use * Violence prevention-a partnership with Catholic Health Initiatives, Women's Center for Advancement, University of Nebraska-Omaha and Creighton University to implement a campus based violence prevention Plan known as ""Green Dot."" Alegent Creighton Health also supports eCPR training to provide community capacity and skills to address the trauma associated with violence. * Metro Area Continuum of Care for the Homeless- Board service and financial support to this coalition addressing homelessness in the service area. * Hope Medical Coalition-Board service and annual operating subsidy. Alegent Creighton Health's hospitals and physicians provide specialty care to patients unable to afford medical services. * Participation in and funding of maternal health, breastfeeding, substance abuse, cancer, diabetes and other community health coalitions * Mental health coalitions including National Alliance on Mental Illness, Nebraska, Nebraska Association of Behavioral Health Care Organizations, and the Juvenile Justice Provider Forum Behavioral Health Committee. Since its opening in 1968, ACH Plainview has been providing care to patients from Pierce, northeastern Antelope and southeastern Knox counties with exceptional care and quality outcomes. ACH Plainview is a 16-bed critical access facility with inpatient and outpatient services including: emergency, laboratory, radiology, home health, specialty clinics, physical therapy, cardiac rehab, pulmonary rehab, surgery, occupational therapy and coumadin clinics. Plainview has a history of providing community education and conducting health screens and sports physicals for the community. Plainview Hospital became a not-for-profit hospital in March 2012 when it was acquired by Alegent Creighton Health and has been working to quantify and integrate its community outreach into the system's community benefit programs."

201611339349306046,470757164,"Schedule H, Part III, Line 3 Bad Debt Expense Methodology",Alegent Creighton Health System does not believe that any portion of bad debt expense could reasonably be attributed to patients who qualify for financial assistance since amounts due from those individuals' accounts will be reclassified from bad debt expense to charity care within 30 days following the date that the patient is determined to qualify for charity care.
201611339349306046,470757164,"Schedule H, Part III, Line 4 Bad debt expense - financial statement footnote","Alegent Creighton Health system does not issue separate company audited financial statements. However, the organization is included in the consolidated financial statements of Catholic Health Initiatives. The consolidated footnote reads as follows: ""The provision for bad debts is based upon management's assessment of historical and expected net collections, taking into consideration historical business and economic conditions, trends in health care coverage, and other collection indicators. Management routinely assesses the adequacy of the allowance for uncollectible accounts based upon historical write-off experience by payor category. The results of these reviews are used to modify, as necessary, the provision for bad debts and to establish appropriate allowances for uncollectible net patient accounts receivable. After satisfaction of amounts due from insurance, CHI follows established guidelines for placing certain balances with collection agencies, subject to the terms of certain restrictions on collection efforts as determined by each facility. The provision for bad debts is presented on the consolidated statements of operations as a deduction from patient services revenues (net of contractual allowances and discounts) since CHI accepts and treats substantially all patients without regard to the ability to pay."""

Each Alegent Creighton Health hospital participates in the CHNA process for the county in which the facility is located at least every 3 years in partnership with the local health departments. The assessment varies in each community but includes review of primary data (such as surveys, key informant interviews, focus groups) and secondary data (such as County Health Rankings, BRFRSS, YRBS, census data etc) Leadership from Alegent Creighton Health participate in multiple internal and external venues to garner community input, prioritize community health needs and develop community health improvement plans. The CHNA report for each community is made available to the public by posting the report on the Alegent Creighton Health external website and by making it available in community venues. The CHNAs are integrated into the governance and planning for Alegent Creighton Health on two levels: * Reporting to the Board of Directors * Reporting into the annual strategic planning and budgeting processes of Alegent Creighton Health. * Implementation plans approved by Board of Directors. Particular to the county in which Lakeside, Creighton University Medical Center, and Midlands Hospitals reside, Alegent Creighton Health partners with the local health department, Live Well Omaha, and competing health systems to retain Professional Research Consultants to conduct a CHNA for the Omaha/Council Bluffs metropolitan service area. The CHNA covers four counties served by the Alegent Creighton Health Omaha and Council Bluffs hospitals. The CHNA reports data at the county level and for Douglas County, by four quadrants within the county. Alegent Creighton Health leaders serve on the CHNA Steering Committee and participate in key informant interviews conducted at hospital locations; they also participate in the implementation plans. The CHNA is shared in multiple venues with the public, including at the Live Well Omaha Summit. Alegent Creighton Health is one of the founders of Live Well Omaha. In addition, Alegent Creighton Health has joined with local health systems and health departments to fund the web based Community Health Dashboard. (http://www.douglascohealth.org/). The CHNA process for the hospital included both quantitative and qualitative sources. Quantitative data input includes primary research (the PRC Community Healthy Survey) and secondary research (vital statistics and other existing health-related data). These quantitative components allow for trending and comparison to benchmark data against the state and national levels. Qualitative data input includes primary research gathered through a series of key informant interviews. The survey instrument used for the CHNA is based largely on the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention Behavioral Risk Factor Surveillance System, with the final survey questions developed by the Sponsors and PRC, similar to previous CHNAs used in the region allowing for data trending. A telephone interview methodology that incorporates both landlines and cell phone interviews was employed for the CHNA. The CHNA consisted of stratified random sample of 2,000 individuals age 18 and older in the service area, including 1,000 interviews in Douglas County; 400 in Sarpy County; 200 in Cass County and 400 in Pottawattamie County. In addition, to better represent racial/ethnic groups, two oversamples were applied in Douglas County (100 additional interviews with Black/African American residents and 100 additional interviews with Hispanic residents). In all, 2,200 interviews were completed throughout the service area. As part of the CHNA, there were five focus groups and 88 key informant interviews which included physicians, other health professionals, media, agencies serving vulnerable populations and individual community members. Particular to Pierce County, NE, the county in which Plainview Hospital is located, hospital leadership and other community leaders from Antelope, Boyd, Brown, Cherry, Holt, Keya Paha, Knox, Pierce and Rock Counties, NE participate in a CHNA led by the North Central District Health Department. North Central District Health Department retains Ionia Research to administer both online and mailed surveys to randomly selected households through the district. The CHNA includes data from the Public Health Action Network, Behavior Risk Factor Surveillance System, Youth Risk Behavior Survey, Bureau of Census, Healthy communities' databases (Population Heath Institute, University of Wisconsin, Robert Wood Johnson Foundation) and Healthy People 2020. The CHNA has been shared in multiple venues and hospital leadership has participated in the community health improvement plan developed collaboratively with the community. On October 12, 2012, North Central Health Department hosted a community meeting in O'Neil, NE to present the CHNA and engage community leadership in analysis, validation and community strategic planning around prioritized health issues. Using the evidence based Mobilizing for Action through Planning and Partnership (MAPP) process. Participants at the October meeting identified the following criteria to guide decisions about prioritizing strategic focus areas: * Issues that are doable/achievable * Issues that address a critical need * Resources available (or could be accessed) - both human and financial * Those that could provide a community focus (those upon which we can make a collective impact) Suggested issues were clustered according to similar area of focus. Five strategic focus areas as follows emerged as a result of the exercise that built consensus. Focus groups were also held with key community stakeholders, including a meeting in December at Foster, NE in Pierce County in which Plainview Hospital leadership attended. A Community Health Improvement Plan (CHIP) process to develop goals, objectives and actions steps around the priority community health issues was hosted by NCDHD on February 8 and 22, 2013. ACH Plainview leadership participated in the CHIP which contributed to ACH Plainview's Implementation Plan. Suggested issues were clustered according to similar area of focus. The following five strategic focus areas emerged as a result of the exercise that built consensus around the question- Based on the data presented, and our collective understanding of our communities' needs, what are our priority strategic focus areas? 1. Obesity and related health concerns 2. Behavioral and mental health 3. Access to care 4. Cancer prevention 5. Safety"
201611339349306046,470757164,"Schedule H, Part VI, Line 3 Patient education of eligibility for assistance","There are several financial assistance access points throughout a patient's care cycle. Bills contain financial assistance verbiage; signs are posted in clinics and hospital, and there is information on financial assistance posted at registration points throughout clinics and hospitals. Information on The Alegent Creighton Health System's financial assistance policies are located several places on the system's website- http://www.chihealth.com. All efforts are made to establish whether patients are eligible for financial assistance prior to service if possible, otherwise as soon as possible following service. Alegent Creighton Health representatives help patients seek reimbursement from local, state and federal programs at no charge to the patient. After these efforts and resources have been exhausted, patients are assisted in the application process for financial assistance consistent with Alegent Creighton Health's Financial Assistance Policy. The application process requires that the patient complete a personal financial application and provide verification documents. Verification includes employment verification and obtaining documentation of the applicant's financial condition such as federal tax return, pay stub, net worth and/or liquid assets and reasonable household or business expenses. Financial assistance may still be granted in certain circumstances involving a catastrophic occurrence resulting in medical bills grossly exceeding the patient's ability to pay, and in these situations, the patient's responsibility will be limited to 20% of the family's gross annual income."

Catholic Health Initiatives (CHI) is a national faith-based nonprofit health care organization with headquarters in Englewood, Colorado. CHI's exempt purpose is to serve as an integral part of its national system of hospitals and other charitable entities, which are described as market-based organizations, or MBOs. An MBO is a direct provider of care or services within a defined market area that may be an integrated health system and/or a stand-alone hospital or other facility or service provider. CHI serves as the parent corporation of its MBOs which are comprised of 101 hospitals, including four academic medical centers, and 30 critical access facilities; community health service organizations; accredited nursing colleges; home health agencies; and other facilities that span the inpatient and outpatient continuum of care. Together, these facilities provided $981 million in charity care and community benefit in the 2015 fiscal year, including services for the poor, free clinics, education and research. CHI provides strategic planning and management services as well as centralized ""shared services"" for the MBOs. The provision of centralized management and shared services - including areas such as accounting, human resources, payroll and supply chain -- provides economies of scale and purchasing power to the MBOs. The cost savings achieved through CHI's centralization enable MBOs to dedicate additional resources to high-quality health care and community outreach services to the most vulnerable members of our society. Alegent Creighton Health Lakeside, Midlands, Plainview, and Creighton University Medical Center operate with its wholly owned affiliates and community partners, along with its fundraising arm, the Alegent Creighton Health Foundation, to serve the health care needs of the Greater Omaha, Nebraska communities."

201611329349304086,520491660,COMMUNITY INFORMATION,"PART VI, LINE 4 GEOGRAPHIC: MEDSTAR HARBOR HOSPITAL'S CBSA INCLUDES ALL RESIDENTS OF ZIP CODE 21225, THE HOSPITAL'S HOME ZIP CODE. THE CBSA SPANS SOUTHERN BALTIMORE CITY AND NORTHERN ANNE ARUNDEL COUNTY, AND INCLUDES FOUR NEIGHBORHOODS: BROOKLYN, BROOKLYN PARK, CHERRY HILL AND PUMPHREY. IN PARTICULAR, THE HOSPITAL WILL FOCUS ON THE CHERRY HILL COMMUNITY. THIS AREA WAS SELECTED DUE TO ITS VERY HIGH POVERTY RATE AND ITS CLOSE PROXIMITY TO THE HOSPITAL, AS WELL AS THE OPPORTUNITY TO BUILD ON PRE-EXISTING PROGRAMS, SERVICES, AND PARTNERSHIPS. DEMOGRAPHIC: CHERRY HILL IS HISTORICALLY A BLACK/AFRICAN AMERICAN NEIGHBORHOOD, WITH ROOTS GOING BACK TO THE 17TH CENTURY. AFTER WORLD WAR II, MORE THAN 600 HOUSING UNITS WERE BUILT THERE BY THE UNITED STATES WAR HOUSING ADMINISTRATION, SPECIFICALLY FOR AFRICAN AMERICAN WAR WORKERS. SHORTLY AFTER THE WAR, THESE UNITS WERE MADE INTO LOW-INCOME HOUSING. ADDITIONAL LOW-INCOME HOUSING UNITS HAVE BEEN ADDED THROUGHOUT THE YEARS, MAKING CHERRY HILL ONE OF THE LARGEST HOUSING PROJECTS EAST OF CHICAGO. THE AMERICAN COMMUNITY SURVEY ESTIMATES THE POPULATION OF ZIP CODE 21225 AT 35,401. THE POPULATION IN CHERRY HILL IS 9,285, AND 95% OF CHERRY HILL RESIDENTS ARE BLACK/AFRICAN AMERICAN, AS COMPARED WITH 63.3% OF BALTIMORE AS A WHOLE. APPROXIMATELY 52% OF CHERRY HILL HOUSEHOLDS WITH CHILDREN WERE HEADED BY A SINGLE PARENT, HIGHER THAN THE CITYWIDE PERCENTAGE OF 26%. TWENTY-SEVEN PERCENT OF CHERRY HILL RESIDENTS AGES 25 YEARS AND OLDER DO NOT HAVE A HIGH SCHOOL EDUCATION, WHILE LESS THAN 6% OF ADULTS 25 AND OLDER HAVE A BACHELOR'S DEGREE OR HIGHER. THE MEDIAN HOUSEHOLD INCOME FOR CHERRY HILL IN IS $18,118, WHICH IS LESS THAN HALF OF THE MEDIAN HOUSEHOLD INCOME FOR THE ENTIRE CBSA ($37,149) , AND APPROXIMATELY 44.5% OF CHERRY HILL FAMILIES LIVE IN POVERTY. IN TERMS OF HEALTH CARE, THE CHERRY HILL COMMUNITY HOUSES MHH, AS WELL AS A LOCAL BRANCH OF THE FAMILY HEALTH CENTERS OF BALTIMORE, WHICH IS A FEDERALLY QUALIFIED HEALTH CENTER (FQHC) PROVIDING HEALTH CARE SERVICES ON A SLIDING FEE SCALE. IN ADDITION, BALTIMORE CITY HEALTH DEPARTMENT PROGRAMS OPERATE CITY-WIDE, AND VARIOUS MOBILE SERVICES-SUCH AS A NEEDLE EXCHANGE PROGRAM, VIOLENCE PREVENTION, MATERNAL AND INFANT NURSING, LEAD POISONING AND ABATEMENT PROGRAMS AND OTHERS-IN THE CHERRY HILL AREA. ACCORDING TO THE CHERRY HILL HEALTH PROFILE, THE LIFE EXPECTANCY AT BIRTH OF A CHERRY HILL RESIDENT IS 67.8, AS COMPARED TO 71.8 IN BALTIMORE CITY AS A WHOLE AND 78.5 IN THE UNITED STATES. HEART DISEASE ACCOUNTS FOR 25% OF ALL DEATHS, AND CANCER ACCOUNTS FOR 17%. STROKE, HIV/AIDS AND HOMICIDE ARE LESS COMMON BUT, WHEN COMBINED, CAUSE 20%OF DEATHS IN THIS AREA. HIGH RATES OF TYPE 2 DIABETES AND HEART DISEASE, INCLUDING STROKE, ALSO OCCUR IN THIS COMMUNITY. FOR A VARIETY OF REASONS, INCLUDING THE HIGH POVERTY RATE AND LOW RATE OF HEALTH CARE INSURANCE COVERAGE, MANY CHERRY HILL RESIDENTS OFTEN USE THE MEDSTAR HARBOR HOSPITAL EMERGENCY DEPARTMENT FOR PRIMARY CARE SERVICES. A STEADY DECREASE IS ANTICIPATED IN THIS AREA OVER THE NEXT FEW FISCAL YEARS AS PATIENTS BECOME INSURED THROUGH THE AFFORDABLE CARE ACT. DESPITE THE CONVENIENT NEIGHBORHOOD LOCATION OF A FQHC, MANY RESIDENTS DO NOT UTILIZE A PRIMARY CARE PHYSICIAN. TYPICALLY, A CHRONIC CONDITION, SUCH AS DIABETES OR HEART DISEASE, PRESENTS SEVERE ENOUGH SYMPTOMS TO WARRANT A TRIP TO THE EMERGENCY DEPARTMENT. IN MANY CASES, SEVERAL CO-MORBIDITIES ARE FOUND TO BE PRESENT AT THIS TIME. WITHOUT PRIMARY CARE FOLLOW-UP, HOWEVER, THESE CONDITIONS USUALLY CANNOT BE ADDRESSED FULLY IN THE TIME ALLOTTED FOR THE EMERGENT ISSUE. IN OTHER CASES, PATIENTS MAY HAVE SYMPTOMS OF A MUCH LESS SERIOUS ILLNESS-A SIMPLE COLD, FOR EXAMPLE-BUT, SINCE THEY DO NOT HAVE A PRIMARY HEALTH CARE PROVIDER, THEY ALSO VISIT THE EMERGENCY DEPARTMENT FOR THESE AILMENTS. AS A RESULT, MANY OF THEIR MOST BASIC HEALTH NEEDS OFTEN ARE NOT MET."

WE PROVIDE EXCELLENT AND COMPASSIONATE CARE AND RESPONSIVE SERVICE. AS WE SEEK TO UNDERSTAND AND FULLY MEET OUR PATIENTS' CURRENT AND FUTURE NEEDS AND EXPECTATIONS, WE RECOGNIZE OUR RESPONSIBILITY TO PRUDENTLY USE THE SCARCE RESOURCES ENTRUSTED TO US. LAWS, REGULATIONS, CATASTROPHIC ILLNESSES AND THE RISING COSTS OF NEW TECHNOLOGY HAVE CREATED A CATEGORY OF PATIENTS WHO ARE EITHER UNINSURED OR UNDERINSURED. THIS CHARITY CARE PROGRAM HAS BEEN DEVELOPED TO HELP THE HOSPITAL MEET THE NEEDS OF THESE PATIENTS AND, CONCURRENTLY, MAINTAIN THE FINANCIAL VIABILITY OF THE HOSPITAL FOR FUTURE GENERATIONS. THIS CHARITY CARE POLICY EXPLAINS HOW THE HOSPITAL ASSISTS PATIENTS WHO CANNOT PAY FOR PART OR ALL OF THE ESSENTIAL MEDICAL CARE THEY RECEIVE. PRINCIPLES: STRONG MEMORIAL HOSPITAL PROACTIVELY CONVEYS INFORMATION ABOUT THIS CHARITY CARE POLICY TO PATIENTS AND THEIR FAMILIES. - WE BELIEVE THAT FEAR OF A HOSPITAL BILL SHOULD NEVER GET IN THE WAY OF ESSENTIAL HEALTH SERVICES. THE PROVISION OF URGENT OR EMERGENT HEALTHCARE IS NEVER DELAYED PENDING A FINANCIAL ASSISTANCE DETERMINATION. SIGNS ANNOUNCING THE CHARITY CARE PROGRAM ARE POSTED IN THE HOSPITAL (E.G. EMERGENCY DEPARTMENT, ADMITTING OFFICE) TO PROACTIVELY CONVEY THIS MESSAGE TO PROSPECTIVE PATIENTS AND THE PUBLIC IN GENERAL. - WE MAINTAIN FINANCIAL AID POLICIES THAT ARE CONSISTENT WITH THE MISSION, VALUES AND CAPACITY OF THE HOSPITAL AND THAT TAKE INTO ACCOUNT EACH INDIVIDUAL'S ABILITY TO CONTRIBUTE TO THE COST OF HIS OR HER CARE. - WE COMMUNICATE THE AVAILABILITY OF FINANCIAL AID IN A MANNER THAT IS CLEAR, UNDERSTANDABLE, SENSITIVE TO THE PATIENT'S DIGNITY, AND IN MULTIPLE LANGUAGES. A NOTICE IS AVAILABLE AT REGISTRATION SITES THAT INFORMS PATIENTS OF THIS PROGRAM AND PROVIDES THE PHONE NUMBER TO CALL TO OBTAIN MORE INFORMATION AND TO APPLY FOR THIS PROGRAM. DESIGNATED STAFF ARE PROVIDED DETAILED TRAINING SO THAT THEY CAN PROVIDE INFORMATION AND ANSWER QUESTIONS ABOUT THE CHARITY CARE PROGRAM. INFORMATION IS GENERALLY AVAILABLE IN BOTH ENGLISH AND SPANISH. WHEN REQUESTED, IT WILL ALSO BE MADE AVAILABLE IN OTHER LANGUAGES. - INFORMATION REGARDING OUR CHARITY CARE PROGRAM IS ALSO AVAILABLE ON THE URMC WEBSITE. - WE IMPLEMENT FINANCIAL AID PROCEDURES THAT ARE CONSUMER-FRIENDLY, RESPECTFUL, AND CONFIDENTIAL, AS WELL AS DEBT COLLECTION POLICIES THAT REFLECT THE MISSION AND VALUES OF THIS HOSPITAL. - WE WORK WITH GOVERNMENT, PAYERS, BUSINESS, CONSUMER GROUPS AND OTHERS TO ADDRESS THE UNDERLYING PROBLEM THAT TOO MANY NEW YORKERS LACK HEALTH INSURANCE. GENERAL GUIDELINES: AS PART OF FINANCIAL PLANNING ASSISTANCE, WE PROVIDE PATIENTS, AND/OR THEIR LEGAL REPRESENTATIVE, WITH INFORMATION ABOUT THE CRITERIA THAT MUST BE MET IN ORDER TO OBTAIN MEDICAID, MEDICARE, OR OTHER HEALTH INSURANCES. PATIENTS ARE ASSISTED IN MAKING APPLICATIONS FOR ANY OF THESE INSURANCES OR DISCOUNTED FEE PLANS. PATIENTS ARE EXPECTED TO PARTICIPATE FULLY IN ALL EFFORTS TO OBTAIN ANY INSURANCE FOR WHICH THEY MAY QUALIFY. UNDER CERTAIN CIRCUMSTANCES, AS DETERMINED BY THE FINANCIAL CASE MANAGERS OR OTHER HOSPITAL SENIOR ADMINISTRATORS. APPLICATIONS FOR MEDICAID, MEDICARE OR OTHER INSURANCE PROGRAMS MAY BE WAIVED WHEN DEEMED UNNECESSARY. IF AVAILABLE INSURANCE BENEFITS ARE NOT SUFFICIENT TO COVER THE COST OF THEIR CARE, PATIENTS MAY THEN APPLY FOR ASSISTANCE FROM THE CHARITY CARE PROGRAM. CHARITY CARE APPLICATIONS MUST BE COMPLETED AND RETURNED TO THE HOSPITAL WITH THE REQUESTED INCOME DOCUMENTATION. PATIENTS WILL NOT RECEIVE CHARITY CARE ASSISTANCE IF THEY (A) DO NOT COMPLETE THE APPLICATION PROCESS FOR MEDICAID OR OTHER INSURANCE FOR WHICH THEY MAY QUALIFY, (B) ELECT NOT TO MAKE APPLICATION FOR CHARITY CARE, OR (C) HAVE ADEQUATE RESOURCES OR INCOME TO PAY PRIVATELY FOR THEIR CARE. IN THESE SITUATIONS, THEY WILL REMAIN FINANCIALLY RESPONSIBLE FOR FULL PAYMENT OF THEIR HOSPITAL BILLS. CHARITY CARE ASSISTANCE IS AVAILABLE FOR PATIENTS WHO RESIDE IN NEW YORK STATE AND RECEIVE EMERGENCY HOSPITAL SERVICES, INCLUDING EMERGENCY TRANSFERS, AND TO PATIENTS WHO RESIDE IN STRONG MEMORIAL HOSPITAL'S PRIMARY SERVICE AREA IN NEW YORK STATE WHO RECEIVE SERVICES IN DESIGNATED STRONG MEMORIAL HOSPITAL PROGRAMS, INCLUDING MOST INPATIENT AND OUTPATIENT SERVICES. IN ADDITION, THE HOSPITAL MAY, IN ITS DISCRETION, GRANT CHARITY CARE TO INDIVIDUALS WHO RESIDE OUTSIDE OF NEW YORK STATE. CHARITY CARE ASSISTANCE DOES NOT COVER MEDICALLY UNNECESSARY CARE, COSMETIC ALTERATION, TELEPHONE, TELEVISION AND PRIVATE ROOM CHARGES. IT DOES NOT COVER SERVICES GENERATED BY AN INSURED PATIENT WHO CHOOSES TO RECEIVE CARE AT AN OUT-OF-NETWORK HOSPITAL, OR WHO FAILS TO COMPLY WITH INSURANCE POLICY REQUIREMENTS (E.G. UNAUTHORIZED SERVICES) NOR DOES IT APPLY TO NON-RESIDENT ALIENS (UNLESS APPROVED IN ADVANCE OF CARE BEING PROVIDED), TO DRUGS NOT ADMINISTERED IN THE HOSPITAL, TO TRANSPORTATION FURNISHED BY THIRD PARTY VENDORS, OR TO CARE, SERVICES, DRUGS OR SUPPLIES FOR THE PURPOSE OF GENDER CHANGE PROCEDURE. SPECIFIC QUESTIONS ABOUT SERVICES THAT ARE NOT COVERED SHOULD BE DIRECTED TO THE PATIENT ACCOUNTS MANAGER OR THEIR DELEGATE. FINANCIAL GUIDELINES: FINANCIAL AID IS INTENDED TO ASSIST THOSE INDIVIDUALS WHO CANNOT AFFORD TO PAY IN PART OR IN FULL FOR THEIR CARE. IT SHOULD TAKE INTO ACCOUNT EACH INDIVIDUAL'S ABILITY TO CONTRIBUTE TO THE COST OF HIS OR HER CARE. HOSPITAL FINANCIAL AID SHOULD NOT BE VIEWED AS A SUBSTITUTE FOR EMPLOYER-SPONSORED OR INDIVIDUALLY PURCHASED INSURANCE. PATIENTS WITHOUT INSURANCE AND WITH INCOME THAT WOULD QUALIFY THEM FOR THE CHARITY CARE PROGRAM BUT ALSO HAVE SUBSTANTIAL RESOURCES (OTHER THAN TAX-DEFERRED OR COMPARABLE RETIREMENT SAVINGS OR COLLEGE SAVINGS ACCOUNTS) MAY BE EXPECTED TO PAY PART OF THEIR BILLS(S). CHARITY CARE ASSISTANCE IS GENERALLY AVAILABLE TO INDIVIDUALS WHOSE INCOME IS LESS THAN OR EQUAL TO 400% OF THE FEDERAL POVERTY LEVEL. HOWEVER, PATIENTS WHO HAVE EXHAUSTED THEIR INSURANCE BENEFITS, EXCEEDED FINANCIAL ELIGIBILITY CRITERIA, FACE EXTRAORDINARY MEDICAL COSTS, OR WHO HAVE OTHER UNIQUE CIRCUMSTANCES MAY BE CONSIDERED FOR CHARITY CARE APPROVAL IN THE HOSPITAL'S SOLE DISCRETION. WHILE APPLICATION FOR MEDICAID OR OTHER INSURANCE IS USUALLY REQUIRED, THE HOSPITAL MAY, AT ITS SOLE DISCRETION, IN APPROPRIATE CASES, ALSO CONSIDER PATIENTS FOR CHARITY CARE WHEN THEY MEET THE FINANCIAL CRITERIA OF THIS PROGRAM, BUT HAVE NOT SATISFACTORILY COMPLETED ALL THE REQUIREMENTS OF THE CHARITY CARE APPLICATION PROCESS. THIS MAY INCLUDE PATIENTS WHO HAVE BEEN SANCTIONED BY MEDICAID, HAVE FILED BANKRUPTCY OR APPEAR TO BE ELIGIBLE FOR CHARITY CARE ASSISTANCE BASED ON AVAILABLE INFORMATION. ELIGIBILITY DETERMINATIONS IN COMPLEX CASE CIRCUMSTANCES WILL BE MADE AFTER CONSIDERATION BY THE CHARITY CARE REVIEW TEAM THAT INCLUDES THE CHARITY CARE OFFICER, FINANCIAL CASE MANAGER AND/OR THEIR MANAGERS, OR MAY BE MADE BY SENIOR HOSPITAL ADMINISTRATORS. THE AMOUNT OF THE DISCOUNT AFFORDED TO QUALIFIED CHARITY CARE PATIENTS WILL BE DETERMINED THROUGH ASSESSMENT OF THE RESPONSIBLE PARTY'S ANNUAL HOUSEHOLD INCOME AND THE NUMBER OF PEOPLE IN THE HOME, AS A PERCENTAGE OF THE FEDERAL POVERTY GUIDELINE AMOUNTS FOR SAME SIZE HOUSEHOLDS. THE FINANCIAL GUIDELINES WILL BE UPDATED ANNUALLY IN CONJUNCTION WITH THE FEDERAL POVERTY UPDATES PUBLISHED BY CMS. PATIENTS MAY RECEIVE FULL OR PARTIAL DISCOUNT FROM THE COST OF CARE, DEPENDING ON THE PERCENTAGE OF THE GUIDELINES MATCHED BY THE PATIENT'S HOUSEHOLD INCOME. ANY BILL AMOUNT REMAINING AFTER APPLICATION OF A PARTIAL CHARITY CARE DISCOUNT IS THE RESPONSIBILITY OF THE PATIENT. THE AMOUNT AN APPROVED CHARITY CARE PATIENT WILL GENERALLY BE EXPECTED TO PAY FOR SERVICES COVERED BY THE POLICY WILL BE LIMITED TO THE LOWER OF THE AMOUNT THAT THE HOSPITAL WOULD HAVE RECEIVED FOR THE SAME SERVICE UNDER MEDICARE PARTS A AND B, (INCLUDING COINSURANCE, CO-PAYMENTS AND DEDUCTIBLES) OR THE USUAL AND CUSTOMARY CHARGES. THE PATIENT WILL BE ASSISTED BY THE HOSPITAL IN MAKING ARRANGEMENTS TO SATISFY ANY BALANCE REMAINING ON THE ACCOUNT(S) AFTER THE APPLICATION OF THE APPROPRIATE CHARITY CARE DISCOUNT BY USE OF A PAYMENT PLAN. THE MONTHLY PAYMENTS UNDER SUCH PLANS SHALL NOT EXCEED TEN PERCENT (10%) OF THE ELIGIBLE PATIENT'S GROSS MONTHLY INCOME.

COMMUNITY HEALTH IMPROVEMENT ADVOCACY THE UNIVERSITY OF ROCHESTER (UR) WELL STREET MEDICINE PROGRAM WAS LAUNCHED IN 2011 IN RESPONSE TO A MEDICAL STUDENT'S PROPOSAL, WHICH DREW ON HER EXPERIENCE WORKING IN STREET MEDICINE IN ANOTHER COMMUNITY. THE MISSION OF UR WELL STREET MEDICINE IS TO ENSURE ACCESS TO QUALITY MEDICAL CARE FOR ROCHESTER'S UNSHELTERED HOMELESS POPULATION, OPERATING UNDER THE PRINCIPLE THAT HEALTH CARE IS A BASIC HUMAN RIGHT. IT SEEKS TO BRIDGE GAPS BETWEEN THE HOMELESS AND MEDICAL COMMUNITIES THROUGH DIRECT STREET OUTREACH AND ENGAGEMENT WITH HOMELESS PEOPLE WHERE THEY LIVE, WHILE BUILDING RELATIONSHIPS OF TRUST AND RESPECT. OUTREACH TEAMS (EACH COMPOSED OF AN OUTREACH GUIDE, A PHYSICIAN, MEDICAL STUDENTS FROM THE SCHOOL OF MEDICINE AND DENTISTRY, AND SOCIAL WORKERS) MAKE WEEKLY VISITS TO HOMELESS SHELTERS, CAMPSITES, CITY PARKS, AND OTHER PLACES WHERE HOMELESS PEOPLE RESIDE. THESE TEAMS PROVIDE MEDICAL CARE THAT IS PATIENT-CENTERED AND HOLISTIC, INCLUDING HEALTH EDUCATION, HOUSING ASSISTANCE, SUBSTANCE ABUSE REHABILITATION, MENTAL HEALTH SERVICES, AND CASE MANAGEMENT TO MEET SPECIFIC NEEDS.

THE BOARD INCLUDES NON-UR MEDICAL CENTER-EMPLOYED PRIVATE COMMUNITY PHYSICIANS, MEMBERS OF THE BUSINESS COMMUNITY, LOCAL PHILANTHROPISTS WITH AN INTEREST IN ADVOCATING FOR HEALTH CARE, AND OTHER LOCAL REPRESENTATIVES.

ADMINISTRATIVELY, UR MEDICAL CENTER LEADERSHIP HAS INITIATED A COMPREHENSIVE AND AMBITIOUS STRATEGIC PLANNING PROCESS ACROSS THE INSTITUTION. THE GOALS OF THE PLAN INCLUDE EXPANDING COMMUNITY HEALTH PROGRAMS AND RESEARCH THAT IMPROVE THE OVERALL HEALTH OF THE GREATER ROCHESTER COMMUNITY. THE BOARD OF DIRECTORS ENDORSE AND CHAMPION THE VISION OF THE PLAN. THE COMMUNITY ADVISORY COUNCIL (CAC) WAS CREATED IN 2006 TO REPRESENT THE VOICE OF THE COMMUNITY AND TO GUIDE AND SUPPORT THE FOUR MISSIONS OF THE URMC. THE THIRTY-SEVEN MEMBER CAC REPRESENTS EIGHTEEN COMMUNITY-BASED ORGANIZATIONS, INCLUDING HEALTH AND SOCIAL SERVICE AGENCIES, THE FAITH COMMUNITY, LOCAL GOVERNMENT, THE CITY SCHOOL DISTRICT AND MEDIA. A PRIMARY FUNCTION OF THE CAC IS TO STRENGTHEN URMC-COMMUNITY PARTNERSHIPS WITH A MUTUAL GOAL TO REDUCE INEQUALITIES AND IMPROVE ACCESS TO HEALTH CARE AND SERVICES. TO HIGHLIGHT THE IMPORTANCE OF THE COMMUNITY HEALTH MISSION, THE ANNUAL ""DR. DAVID SATCHER COMMUNITY HEALTH IMPROVEMENT AWARDS"" PROGRAM WAS ESTABLISHED IN 2010 TO RECOGNIZE URMC FACULTY/STAFF AND THEIR COMMUNITY PARTNERS FOR EXEMPLARY COMMUNITY-ENGAGED WORK WHICH CONTRIBUTES TO REDUCING HEALTH INEQUALITIES AND IMPROVES THE COMMUNITY'S HEALTH THROUGH RESEARCH, EDUCATION, AND SERVICE.

THE ADULT TREATMENT AREA WAS CONSTRUCTED WITH 25 SEMI-PRIVATE PATIENT CUBICLES, AND UNLIKE OTHER EMERGENCY FACILITIES IN THE REGION, IT ALSO INCLUDES A DEDICATED CHILDREN'S EMERGENCY DEPARTMENT WITH A PRIVATE WAITING ROOM. SURPLUS FUNDS ARE ALSO DEDICATED TO SUPPORT RESEARCH. FINAL RENOVATIONS WERE MADE TO OUR CLINICAL AND TRANSLATIONAL RESEARCH INSTITUTE (CTSI) THAT SERVES AS THE HUB OF RESOURCES, EXPERTISE AND NETWORKS NECESSARY TO ACCELERATE THE CLINICAL APPLICATION OF BIOMEDICAL AND BEHAVIORAL RESEARCH SO THAT INTERVENTIONS CAN REACH INDIVIDUALS IN THE COMMUNITY MORE QUICKLY. THE CTSI'S COMMUNITY ENGAGEMENT FUNCTION, WHICH IS ADMINISTERED BY THE UR MEDICAL CENTER'S CENTER FOR COMMUNITY HEALTH, SUPPORTS THE CTSI COMMUNITY ENGAGEMENT MISSION BY FACILITATING COMMUNICATION AND PARTNERSHIPS AMONG RESEARCHERS, HEALTH CARE PROVIDERS, AND COMMUNITY MEMBERS AND ORGANIZATIONS.

The Rockefeller University Hospital has provided an array of clinical research and patient care services since its founding in 1910. The Rockefeller University Hospital community served/service area is determined based on research being conducted. Principal Investigators identify an area of interest and submit a protocol for review and approval by our institutional review board. If and when the protocol is approved, our recruitment office works with the investigator to develop and submit advertisements in local newspapers, magazines and online. Identification of lucrative places to advertise is determined by current trends in readership among local newspapers, magazines and visits to particular websites such as Craigslist and Facebook. Research participants are culled from all over New York City as well as through collaborations with neighboring hospitals, Universities, and clinics. As a result, our enrolled research participant demographics follow those of New York City overall.

We recognize we are most successful when we work together with a wide array of public and private organizations that share our commitment to improving lives. By doing so, we maximize our efforts and reduce the duplication of services. HSHS hospitals also understand we need to listen closely to the residents of the communities we serve to ensure the health care needs of all are being met. To that end, 13 of our hospitals completed Community Health Needs Assessments (CHNAs) in FY2015 and in FY2012. HSHS St. Clare Memorial Hospital in Oconto Falls, Wisconsin, who affiliated with HSHS in September 2015, completed their CHNA in FY2014. The information gathered from these assessments is being used to develop new, and enhance existing, programs and services that best address the needs of the community. Several priority needs were identified in the FY2015 CHNAs including mental health; chronic disease prevention and management; alcohol, tobacco and other drug abuse; nutrition/wellness; access to care; oral health; and domestic abuse. HSHS hospitals are addressing these and other needs by proactively offering educational opportunities, preventative screenings, and new or enhanced clinical services. In many cases, the hospitals collaborate with other hospital facilities, local departments of public health and community organizations to address identified needs. In western Wisconsin, HSHS Sacred Heart Hospital in Eau Claire and HSHS St. Joseph's Hospital in Chippewa Falls are taking the lead on programming to educate the public about mental health issues and treatment, the stigma associated with mental health, and the recognition of mental health issues. To combat the rising rate of suicides in the area, both hospitals are providing community education sessions on QPR (Question, Persuade and Refer), an evidence-based suicide prevention program. In addition, the hospitals hosted sessions to train community members to become Certified QPR Trainers. In southern Illinois, HSHS St Elizabeth's Hospital in Belleville also identified suicide as a priority community health need. In response, the hospital in cooperation with the local county mental board offered QPR to educate the community about how to identify and talk to someone who may be considering suicide. In addition, St Elizabeth's mental health counselors provided free evaluations to assess for services or referred individuals to other local agencies for assistance. They also provided telephone assistance to individuals with mental health questions. In FY2015, the counselors screened more than 300 clients and fielded more than 1,000 calls. HSHS St. Vincent Hospital in Green Bay developed the Sexual Assault Nurse Examiner (SANE) program comprised of 11 nurses and a medical director to provide care for anyone who has been sexually assaulted. Begun in 1992, St. Vincent's SANE program is the regional site for such care, one where all the hospitals in Green Bay and the surrounding communities send sexual assault victims. St. Vincent's SANE nurses have been properly trained to conduct the medical examination, collect evidence, treat injury and provide courtroom testimony. In FY2015, SANE served more than 185 individuals at a vulnerable and devastating time of their lives. HSHS St. Mary's Hospital in Streator, Illinois teamed up with the Streator YMCA to offer a 12-week weight loss program - Healthy You - to motivate more than 284 participants. The program included aerobics classes, cooking classes, and a maintenance program to encourage participants to weigh in monthly. Surveys were collected at registration to quantify progress for repeat participants - 14 percent returned with a further weight loss and 9 percent within 5 pounds of their 2014 weight. In FY2015, Healthy You participants collectively lost 2,982 pounds. In FY2015, HSHS St. Mary's Hospital in Decatur, Illinois partnered with Macon County Care Coordination (MCCC) comprised of the Macon County Health Board, Community Health Improvement Center, Decatur Memorial Hospital, Heritage Behavioral Health Center, and Macon County Health Department to provide a team approach to health care and behavioral health services for Medicaid recipients with chronic health conditions. In FY2015, a nurse practitioner was hired to lead the program and recruit physicians. Three teams consisting of a Registered Nurse, Care Navigator and Care Coordinator were hired to provide services. St. Mary's is in the final stages of the development of an interface with the Electronic Medical Record, and is working on fully integrating MCCC services into their Emergency Department and exploring possibilities of integrating MCCC within the HSHS Medical Group to provide care coordination for Medicaid recipients with chronic health conditions. According to the National Assessment of Adult Literacy, only 12 percent of adults have ""proficient"" health literacy, i.e. nine out of 10 adults lack the skills needed to manage their health. Health literacy was identified in the CHNA completed by HSHS St. Nicholas Hospital in Sheboygan and the Department of Public Health in FY2012. In FY2014, the Healthy Sheboygan County 2020 Health Literacy Committee hosted five focus groups (Hispanic, Hmong, low-income, senior citizens and young adults) and an Executive Briefing for health care leaders to share the results of the community survey and focus groups. In FY2015, with the support of St. Nicholas Hospital, a health literacy community awareness campaign was launched - Okay2Ask - to encourage people to build strong relationships with their health care providers and pharmacists."

In FY2015, HSHS hospitals and affiliated physician groups contributed more than $19 million toward research and education. Highlights of this commitment include subsidizing medical school residency programs, offering ongoing medical education to physicians and clinicians, and providing job shadowing programs for high school students. In southern Illinois, HSHS St. Joseph's Hospital in Breese, hosted members of the Health Occupations Students of America onsite to learn about job opportunities in health care from health care professionals. St. Joseph's also provided clinical experience for Kaskaskia College students enrolled in nursing, physical therapy and radiology programs. Pharmacy students have also completed their clinical training at St. Joseph's Hospital. In FY2015, 73 students were served by the program. In FY2015, HSHS St. Mary's Hospital Medical Center and HSHS St. Vincent Hospital in Green Bay invested more than $450,000 to provide onsite training and education of nurses and allied health professionals. In addition, the hospitals have been collaborating with the Medical College of Wisconsin to establish a community medical education program in Green Bay and to provide financial support to offset operating costs in FY2015. Also in eastern Wisconsin, HSHS St. Clare Memorial Hospital in Oconto Falls provided training for local paramedics and emergency response personnel through the hospital's EMS liaison program. In response to its FY2012 CHNA, HSHS St. John's Hospital in Springfield, Illinois convened a team of health care providers in FY2015 to identify the practice gaps around metabolic syndrome in children and adults and to research best practices and evidence-based protocols to reduce the progression of metabolic syndrome. The team developed and implemented a three-part multidisciplinary discussion on preventing childhood obesity entitled ""Childhood Obesity in Central Illinois: Weighing in on the Problem,"" which was offered during grand rounds. In addition, the team hosted a Continuing Medical Education program for the community entitled ""Restoring Healthy Families and Communities in an Obesongenic Environment: A Tool Kit for Health Care Professionals."" Mission-driven and strategically implemented Community Benefit is an integral part of Hospital Sisters Health System's Mission. Our commitment to Community Benefit arises from our Catholic identity, Mission and Core Values shared by 14,000 colleagues across Illinois and Wisconsin. Through our work to improve access to health care services, enhance community health, advance medical knowledge, and relieve or reduce the burden of government, we believe we have made a positive difference in the quality of lives of tens of thousands of people in Illinois and Wisconsin in FY2015. As a Catholic health care ministry, HSHS is concerned with the dignity of all persons, the common good, and the stewardship of resources. We advocate for health care for all and work to improve social conditions that lead to improved health and well-being. We engage partners in our communities to improve health and quality of life and to reduce duplication. Working side by side with many faith communities, HSHS remains dedicated to our common purpose of compassionate care for all people."

Specifically, Charity Care is calculated by determining the total amount from patient billing that is written off to charity care charge codes plus an allowance accrual adjustment. This amount matches the number that is reported on our fiscal year ending 2015 audited financial statements. The total charity care dollar amount is then reduced to cost by applying the Hospital's cost to charge ratio as calculated on IRS schedule H - worksheet 2."

St. John's Children's Hospital's Executive Director is actively involved with the Blackburn College Board in order to serve as the medical liaison to the Medical Science and Laboratory Science programs. This invaluable resource guides the school in their curriculum development and helps connect students with meaningful life experiences. St. John's Children's Hospital provides annual monetary and in-kind support to the Ronald McDonald House of Central Illinois. Additionally, St. John's Hospital provides the land and maintenance for the house facility. This provision allows families to remain close to their children during stressful times when separation may otherwise further the complications of illness and injury. St. John's Hospital has provided a significant amount of monies to the building of the Kidzeum children's Museum. Additionally, a St. John's Hospital executive team member sits on the Kidzeum board. This museum will create experiences of learning and discovery through play for children of all abilities. These fun learning experiences and the encouragement of exploration in young children has been proven to encourage lifelong learning and academic success. St. John's Hospital People Services Director sits on the United Way Board. Additionally, St. John's provides a 'Loaned Executive' each year during United Way's community campaign. These in-kind resources allow United Way to increase their ability to mobilize resources to meet community need. St. John's leadership in these community building activities lends credibility to the mission of the supporting organizations and provides additional resources to enhance their success. These community building activities promote the overall health and quality of life for the individuals they serve."
201641339349305994,370661238,"Schedule H, Part III, Line 2 Bad debt expense - methodology used to estimate amount","Self-pay patients are screened for verification of no insurance coverage. Once verification of no coverage has been completed, the guarantors will be screened for charity or uninsured discounts based on income levels. Those guarantors that do not qualify for charity through the screening process will be asked to provide proof of income in the form of a recent pay stub and/or recent tax return to determine the level of uninsured discounting. If no proof of income is provided or a guarantor's income is greater than 201% of the federal poverty level, the appropriate discount according to the established criteria will be applied. The amount of money not collected from those self-pay patients who are not eligible for charity care is reported as bad debt. Allowances for Doubtful Accounts have been recorded based on an historical matrix, using collectability percentages by payor and aging category in accordance with HSHS Executive Policy #F-23, Valuation of Net Accounts Receivable. Percentages are based on historical experience at the hospital and adjusted for known limitations. St. John's Hospital reports bad debt in accordance with Generally Accepted Accounting Principles (GAAP)."
201641339349305994,370661238,"Schedule H, Part III, Line 3 Bad Debt Expense Methodology","The hospital strongly believes that its charity care, and the related community benefit obtained from such care, is understated because of those patients who potentially qualify for charity care but do not wish to apply for it. In addition, some care is not classified as charity because of missing documentation on patient resources. Thus, the hospital's bad debt includes a portion that could be classified as charity care if application for such care was sought and/or completed. Currently, the hospital is implementing processes, procedures and systems to more effectively determine charity care that will reduce a patient's documentation requirements and ease the patient's emotional burden in applying for charity care. This will provide a more accurate reporting of charity care services provided by the hospital."

201641339349305994,370661238,"Schedule H, Part III, Line 8 Community benefit & methodology for determining medicare costs","The hospital continually strives to provide excellent patient care in the most cost effective fashion. Nonetheless, the Medicare program, in many cases, does not provide payment that covers the full cost of the care provided. Since it is the mission of the hospital to respond to community need, hospital management continually advocates for improved Medicare payment so that the cost of quality care to those patients who are not able to afford it is not compromised and is fairly subsidized by all payers. While this shortfall in Medicare payments is not classified as community benefit by the IRS, we nonetheless believe it is an important contribution made by the hospital to the health and well-being of the community. If the Medicare program did not exist, many Medicare patients would be eligible for charity care or other means-tested government programs. Further, by absorbing this payment shortfall and providing care below cost to these individuals, St. John's Hospital is relieving the burden of the government. Accordingly, this shortfall restricts St. John's ability to make funds available to provide for charity care and other community benefits. The hospital Medicare shortfall at cost for fiscal year 2015 was $39,854,628."
201641339349305994,370661238,"Schedule H, Part III, Line 9b Collection practices for patients eligible for financial assistance","Every effort is made prior to, during and after provision of medical services to determine whether a patient is eligible for charity/community care and to assist the patient in completing the application and provide adequate documentation. If the patient qualified for charity/community care for the full balance of their account, the entire amount is written off to charity/community care and hence no debt collection is pursued. If the patient qualified for charity/community care for a portion of their account balance, that portion is written off to charity/community care, with the patient being responsible for the remainder of the balance. Additionally, reasonable effort will be made to obtain third-party or government payer reimbursement on behalf of the patient. If those efforts are not fruitful, an offer will be extended to the patient to make installment payments on their balance. Only at such point that the patient defaults on installment payments or refuses to cooperate with the hospital's efforts to be reimbursed will the account be sent to collections."

In previous years, the hospital assessed community need through an annual review of existing data sets and existing needs assessments. Following is a sample of data sets reviewed: - Sangamon County Residents Death Certificates - IDPH / IPLAN Data Sets - IDPH Behavioral Risk Factor Surveillance System Data - U.S. Census Data - 2006 United Way of Central Illinois Community Needs Assessment - Healthy People 2010 - Greater Springfield Chamber of Commerce Economic Development Report Needs were prioritized based on assets and gaps in the community around each need. Provisions in the Affordable Care Act require charitable hospitals to conduct a CHNA and adopt implementation strategies to meet the needs identified. To comply with these requirements, St. John's Hospital led a collaborative approach to conduct its CHNA in FY2015 (July 1, 2014 through June 30, 2015), a process we undertake every three years. An accompanying implementation plan was developed and approved by St. John's Hospital's Board of Directors in October 2015."

The brochures are also supplied in waiting and ancillary areas for easy access by the patient. The brochures include contact numbers for the Business Office. Available on SJS website is information about how to read and understand the billing information on payment assistance, billing procedures and explanation of Medicare forms. Signage indicating that Financial Assistance is available is located at hospital patient access points. St. John's Hospital's website provides an explanation of Medicare forms at https://www.st-johns.org/stjohns/Billing-and-Financial-Assistance.aspx. The organization has a representative onsite to assist patients who may be eligible for Medicaid assistance through the Illinois Department of Public Assistance. They work with patients to determine if they may be eligible, and if so, assist in pulling together the necessary application for submission. Patients are also provided a Fair Billing Act notification at the point of registration regarding separate physician billing they can expect to receive, plus information about the patient's financial responsibility if their insurance plan is out of network. One-on-one conversations to educate patients about financial assistance often stem from patients receiving a statement or a pre-collection letter. At that point, the customer service representative or cashier, or other qualified staff, will inform/educate the caller about financial assistance options. The first pre-collection letter reminds the patient their account is in delinquent status. It also informs them they may be eligible for financial assistance through the organization's charity care program. The letter provides direct contact information to begin the application process for charity care and lists the Internet address where the policy can be obtained. A system called Search America is now being utilized after failed attempts made by the hospital and our law firm to work out payment arrangements. That system accesses credit and other information and allows us to see the probability of a patient being able to pay their bill. After assessing that information, the hospital makes a determination whether to grant charity care or continue collection efforts."

Additionally, St. John's provides tertiary care to residents of Bond, Brown, Clay, Coles, De Witt, Effingham, Fayette, Greene, Marion, Mason, Moultrie, Piatt, Pike, Schuyler and Shelby counties. Aside from the city of Springfield, the economy of St. John's service area is primarily rural and is supported by small businesses, industries, mining and agriculture. Springfield, on the other hand, is an urban area supported by large businesses, such as the Illinois State Government and other industries. Based on 2014 population estimates derived from the 2010 census, Sangamon County's population of 200,580 people is comprised of 83.04 percent Caucasians, 12.9 percent African Americans, 0.21 percent American Indians/Alaska Natives, 1.79 percent Asians, 0.02 percent Native Hawaiians/Other Pacific Islanders, 0.57 percent people stating another race and 2.3 percent people stating two or more races. Thirty percent of Sangamon County's residents have a high school diploma, 8.54 percent hold an associate's degree, 19.64 percent have a bachelor's degree, 7.78 percent hold a master's degree, and 3.56 percent have a professional school degree or doctorate degree.

The hospital was founded more than 140 years ago to bring a healing presence and improve the health of our community, especially for those persons who are sick, poor, and disadvantaged. Because of the hospital's purpose and tradition, it is organized to promote the health of Springfield and surrounding areas. The hospital is governed by a Board of Directors, at least a majority of whom reside in the hospital's primary service area and who are neither employees nor independent contractors of the hospital (nor family members thereof). The Board ensures that St. John's Hospital is responding to community need. In FY2015, for example, the Board reviewed the Community Health Needs Assessment and approved an Implementation Plan for addressing selected health focus areas. Also consistent with its exempt purpose, St. John's Hospital has an open medical staff with privileges available to all qualified physicians in the area. The hospital also operates an emergency department that is open 24 hours to all persons regardless of their ability to pay. As a not-for-profit hospital, St. John's Hospital reinvests surplus funds to support the mission of the organization and health of the community rather than distributing surplus funds as profits to shareholders or individuals. Funds not committed to ongoing operations are generally used to upgrade facilities, provide medical education and conduct medical research, secure new technologies, improve patient care, and support initiatives designed to promote health and ensure access for all. For example, St. John's Hospital has reinvested surplus funds in the following areas over the last two fiscal years: * Opened four newly remodeled floors in Patient Tower to create all private rooms and specific nursing units * Opened new 150,000 square foot Surgery Center. * MAKOplasty robotic arm surgery * 3D mammography * STAT Stroke Telemedicine Network * Obstetrical air transport team * CinemaVision, MRI video to immerse patients in the video of their choice * HSHS Regional Trauma Center St. John's Hospital also devotes significant resources to access for patients who cannot afford care, along with other community benefits. In fiscal year 2015, St. John's Hospital provided more than $16,004,411 million in Community Benefit services, including charity care at cost, unpaid costs of Medicaid and other public programs, and a range of diverse programs designed to enhance access and improve community health. Additionally, in fiscal year 2015, St. John's Hospital provided $5.3 million (at cost) in uncompensated care to patients who did not qualify for charity care or public assistance and more than $39 million (at cost) in excess of Medicare payment for health care services. St. John's Hospital provides a range of Community Benefit activities and programs that furthers our mission and long-standing commitment to our community. In many cases, these Community Benefit initiatives would not exist without the leadership role played by St. John's Hospital and they often relieve a burden that would otherwise be carried by government. The majority of the Community Benefit programs and activities provided in FY2015 are in response to the hospital's FY2012 Community Health Needs Assessment (CHNA). The FY2012 CHNA surfaced the following health focus areas to be addressed by the hospital in collaboration with other hospitals and community organizations: Metabolic Syndrome 1. Kohl's Gotta Dance The significance of dance reflects an intrinsic cultural orientation toward physical expression and creativity. For many groups, dance plays an important role as a means of emotional expression, interaction, support, respect and cohesion. Studies show dance has improved health outcomes in various populations. For example, dance has been shown to reduce stress, increase bone mineral density, increase physical activity in sedentary populations and decrease weight. Dancing to increase health is effective. Dancing regularly will lower your heart rate, lower or maintain healthy blood pressure and improve or maintain healthy cholesterol levels. Dancing can also improve circulation, lung performance, flexibility and help grow healthy, strong bones. Dancing teaches children to respect themselves and others by being a part of a team, learning to work together to achieve success and problem-solve within their groups to perfect difficult moves and steps. Above all, dancing leaves one feeling physically and mentally better. Outreach objective - Educate, empower and enable our community to combat diabetes, obesity and other health issues through a healthy diet and lifestyle Program objective - Use the art of dance to increase a child's daily physical activity time (goal - 60 min./day), teach children lifestyles for a successful future (problem-solving, decision-making, verbal and non-verbal communication, accountability, responsibility, team-work, etc.) and introduce children to the arts. Learning objective - Participants will learn and practice skills to increase their ability to make healthy personal and social decisions. Direct outcomes * Increase daily and weekly physical activity. * Develop lifestyle skills: communication, problem-solving, teamwork, accountability, team work, self-respect, decision-making, etc. Indirect outcomes * Healthier body composition measurements. * Healthier social interactions. * Decreased risky behaviors. Progress: Provide dance classes for students in fourth through ninth grades for 10 months. Students participate in one of the following: Hip Hop, Modern or Irish Dance. Students perform at a large theatre arts venue (Hoogland Center for the Arts or Sangamon Auditorium) at the end of the program. Students participate in a one-hour, weekly class and must attend 85 percent of classes in order to participate in the final performance. There are 120 students enrolled in seven classes. Classes are held in five locations around town. Each location was selected for its proximity to underserved neighborhoods. FY2015 Plans for Growth: Through a partnership with Hope Institute, a school and living facility for mentally handicapped children (through 21 years old), classes expanded to include three classes for children living with mental and physical disabilities. School assembly: In school year 2015-2016, St. John's Hospital will offer a music and dance-based health program for students in K-6 with a focus on nutrition education and exercise. Student mentor program: Kohl's Gotta Dance students who have exceeded the eligible age for participation will be qualified to apply to become a Gotta Dance student mentor. Students selected will have had good program attendance, shown leadership qualities, been respectful of classmates and instructor and will be willing to work alongside Gotta Dance instructors as teacher and mentor to younger students."
201641339349305994,370661238,"Schedule H, Part VI, Line 6 Affiliated health care system","HSHS St. John's Hospital is an affiliate of Hospital Sisters Health System (HSHS), a health care ministry that includes 14 hospitals, numerous community-based health centers and clinics, and hundreds of physician partners across Illinois and Wisconsin. The mission of HSHS is ""to reveal and embody Christ's healing love for all people through our high quality Franciscan health care ministry."" We live our mission by providing holistic healing to all who seek our care, as well as through Community Benefit. Working collaboratively with others in the communities we serve, our Community Benefit initiatives are strategically and successfully expanding access to care, improving the health status of residents, and increasing medical education and knowledge. In FY2015, our hospitals responded to needs identified in each of their most recent Community Health Needs Assessments (CHNAs) completed in FY2012. The information gathered from these assessments was used to develop or enhance Community Benefit programs and services to best address community health needs. Among the many priority needs identified in our CHNAs were chronic disease prevention and management, obesity, adequate food and nutrition, mental health, and access to health care services. HSHS hospitals are proactively addressing these and other needs through patient, provider and community education, preventative screenings, self-management classes, and new or enhanced clinical services. System-wide, HSHS collectively provided $195.3 million in Community Benefit (9.9% of total hospital expenses) in FY2015. This amount included $25.2 million provided for Financial Assistance (i.e. Charity Care) and $132.3 million for unreimbursed care provided as part of the Medicaid program. In addition, HSHS hospitals committed significant resources to care for Medicare patients. The cost of providing services to primarily elderly beneficiaries of the Medicare program - in excess of governmental and managed care contract payments - was $183.7 million. HSHS hospitals also recorded $61.5 million in uncollectible accounts. While HSHS does not count the latter two amounts as Community Benefit, they nonetheless reflect our commitment to all persons in need of care. In addition to the dollars invested in our Community Benefit programs, HSHS continues to reinvest any surplus revenue from operations and investments into new medical technology, facility infrastructure and health care services in our communities. By doing so, we ensure our ability to meet the ongoing demand for high quality, efficient and easily accessible health care. As the U.S. health care delivery model continues to evolve, HSHS remains focused on implementing our Care Integration strategy. Care Integration coordinates the delivery of care across the continuum to meet the needs of each patient. During FY2015, HSHS made significant progress with this strategy as we implemented additional interoperable health information technologies and strengthened our alignment with physicians. Improve access to health services As a Franciscan health care ministry, HSHS is deeply committed to serving those who are most in need with a special focus on the poor and vulnerable. We not only provide care to every patient who walks through our doors, but also reach out beyond the walls of our hospitals and clinics to care for those in our communities. Our efforts to ensure residents in the communities we serve receive the right care, at the right time, and in the right setting often involve partnering with others to achieve this goal. Across our two-state System, there are numerous examples of HSHS collaborating with other organizations to enhance access to care for those in need. In FY2015, HSHS and our 14 hospitals invested Community Benefit resources to educate the uninsured about new enrollment opportunities in affordable health care coverage and to facilitate the process. Studies have shown that people without insurance coverage are more likely than their insured counterparts to postpone care and to develop more severe and expensive conditions. It is for this reason that the Catholic Church, Catholic health care and HSHS have long promoted ""coverage and access for all."" HSHS and our 14 hospitals in partnership with local health departments, social service agencies and other health care providers played a vital role in educating eligible people in their local communities, by referring people to Certified Application Counselors and/or in enrolling them in the health insurance exchanges, or in securing coverage through Medicaid expansion. Of the eight states with the highest concentration of uninsured, Illinois was among 25 states that adopted Medicaid expansion under the Affordable Care Act. HSHS St. Mary's Hospital Medical Center in Green Bay supports the NEW Community Clinic, a 38-year-old free health center for the uninsured and underinsured, and also provides free and discounted laboratory and radiology services to the clinic. More than 70 percent of patients indicate the care they received at the clinic prevented a trip to the emergency department. This year St. Mary's Hospital, along with sister hospital HSHS St. Vincent Hospital in Green Bay, provided more than $100,000 to support acute care clinic operations at their Northeast Wisconsin Technical College location, as well as funds to support operating costs associated with the oral surgeon's services at the dental clinic. HSHS St. Francis Hospital in Litchfield, Illinois partnered with Lewis & Clark Community College and local dental providers to bring the College's mobile dental health unit to the Litchfield area; the unit provides free or low cost dental exams and screenings, x-rays and hygiene services. The percentage of total emergency department visits related to dental issues has decreased from 2.2 percent in 2011 to 1.27 percent in 2014 as a result of these collaborative efforts to provide the right care in the right setting. In southeast Illinois, area residents can get help filling a prescription through the long-term collaboration between HSHS St. Anthony's Memorial Hospital in Effingham and Catholic Charities. In FY2015, St. Anthony's helped underwrite the cost of prescription medications for 312 residents. St. Anthony's and Catholic Charities believe that no one should be without prescription medications because of the inability to pay. In southwest Illinois, HSHS St. Joseph's Hospital in Highland enhanced their offerings to their senior population based on their CHNA. ""Senior Renewal"" is an outpatient counseling program for senior adults who may be facing emotional and physical problems unique to the aging process such as feelings of loneliness, isolation and anxiety. Clients receive a comprehensive level of treatment without inpatient hospitalization through counseling strategies and education. In addition, St. Joseph's Hospital in collaboration with the Illinois Department of Insurance participates in the Senior Health Insurance Program (SHIP), a free health insurance counseling service for Medicare beneficiaries and their caregivers. In addition to programs designed to increase access to care, HSHS makes sure that those who need financial assistance receive it. HSHS's Financial Assistance (Charity Care) policy was modified effective January 1, 2014 to offer a 25 percent self-pay discount to all patients who register without insurance. HSHS Financial Assistance programs have a sliding scale, in some instances providing up to a 55 percent reduction off billed charges if an uninsured patient's family income level is determined to be above 500 percent but equal to our less than 600 percent of the current Federal Poverty Guidelines. All charges are waived for patients below 200 percent of the Federal Poverty Levels. Counselors are available in our hospitals to explain our financial assistance policy to patients, provide them with assistance in filling out a simple application form, or help them enroll in publicly funded health care programs."

201631339349300108,520591667,Community Health Care Needs Assessment,"Schedule H, Part VI, Line 2 Maryland General Hospital completed a comprehensive community health needs assessment (CHNA) in Fiscal Year 2015. This was the second CHNA completed with the first one done and reported in Fiscal Year 2012. The Association for Community Health Improvements (ACHI) 6-step Community Health Assessment Process was utilized as an organizing methodology. The Maryland General Hospital Community Health Improvement Team (CHI Team) served as the lead team to conduct the CHNA with input from other University of Maryland Medical System Baltimore City-based hospitals, community leaders, the academic community, the public, health experts, and the Baltimore City Health Department. In addition to using the ACHI 6-step process to lead the assessment process, the Maryland General hospital CHI Team used an additional 5-component assessment and engagement strategy to lead the data collection methodology. Maryland General Hospital, part of the University of Maryland Medical System (UMMS), is a non-profit, 190-bed urban community teaching hospital located in midtown Baltimore with a network of services providing care to approximately 100,000 patients each year. Maryland General Hospital's admissions are primarily from within the Baltimore City and the greater metropolitan region. However, for purposes of community benefits programming and this report, the Community Benefit Service Area (CBSA) of UMMC is within Baltimore City. The zip codes within Baltimore City prominently represent the top 66% of all Baltimore City admissions in FY14. These targeted zip codes are: 21201, 21215, 21216, 21217, 21218, 21223, and 21229 The populations in these zip codes are some of the most vulnerable, underserved residents in Baltimore City. There are significant health disparities in these zip codes when compared to other zip codes in Baltimore City and Maryland. Using the above frameworks, data was collected from multiple sources, groups, and individuals and integrated into a comprehensive document which was utilized at a retreat on March 11, 2014 of the Maryland General Hospital Community Health Improvement (CHI) Team. During that strategic planning retreat, priorities were identified using the collected data and an adapted version of the Catholic Health Associations (CHA) priority setting criteria. The identified priorities were also validated by a panel of UM Clinical Advisors and UMB Campus experts. Maryland General Hospital collaborated with the University of Maryland Medical Center and used primary and secondary sources of data as well as quantitative and qualitative data and consulted with numerous individuals and organizations during the CHNA, including other University of Maryland Medical System (UMMS) Baltimore City-based hospitals (University of Maryland Medical Center, James Lawrence Kernan Hospital, and Mt Washington Pediatric Hospital), community leaders, community partners, the University of Maryland Baltimore (UMB) academic community, the general public, local health experts, and the Baltimore City Health Department. A) Community Perspective The communitys perspective was obtained through one survey offered to the public using several methods throughout Baltimore City. A 6-item survey queried Baltimore City residents to identify their top health concerns and their top barriers in accessing health care. Methods 6-item survey distributed in FY2015 using the following methods: - Survey insert in Maryland Health Matters (health newsletter) distributed to over 40,000 residents within the CBSA - Online survey posted to www.umm.edu website for community to complete - Waiting rooms (Ambulatory clinics and EDs) at both campuses - Health fairs and events in neighborhoods within UMMCs CBSA Results Top 5 Health Concerns: - Diabetes/Sugar -Smoking/Drug/Alcohol Use - High Blood Pressure/Stroke - Cancer - Heart Disease Analysis by CBSA targeted zip codes revealed the same top health concerns and top health barriers with little deviation from the overall Baltimore City data. The sample size was 1,212 Baltimore City residents from the identified CBSA. B) Health Experts Methods- - Reviewed & included National Prevention Strategy Priorities, Maryland State Health Improvement Plan (SHIP) indicators, and Healthy Baltimore 2015 plan from the Baltimore City Health Department - Reviewed Marylands State Health Improvement Plan (SHIP) and attended state-wide health summit in October 2014. - Progress to date on SHIP measures were presented as well as state-wide health priorities for upcoming multi-year cycle. - Conducted campus-wide stakeholder retreat in March 2015, including University of Maryland Schools of Medicine, Nursing, Social Work and UMB Community Affairs office - Interviewed Director of Chronic Disease Prevention at Baltimore City Health Department Results - National Prevention Strategy 7 Priority Areas - SHIP: 39 Objectives in 5 Vision Areas for the State, includes targets for Baltimore City - While progress has been made since 2012 - with 16 out of 41 measures meeting the identified targets at the state level, Measures within Baltimore City have not met identified targets; Even wider minority disparities within the City - Healthy Baltimore 2015: Ten Priority Areas Baltimore City Health Department and Mayors Top Health Priorities: #1 Cardiovascular Disease (CVD) Decrease premature mortality (as defined as death prior to 75 years) #2 Asthma - Particularly pediatric asthma #3 Heroin Use While a priority, no major initiatives to date #4 Diabetes As related to CVD as a comorbidity -Health Expert UMB Campus Panel Focus Group Top Action Items included: -Improve communication and synergy across Campus schools and UMMC -Include University of Maryland Medical Center on UMB Community Action Council -Look for ways to partner and support each other C) Community Leaders Methods - Hosted a focus group in collaboration with the other Baltimore-based UMMS hospitals for community-based organization partners to share their perspectives on health needs (October 30, 2014) Results -Consensus reached that social determinants of health (and upstream factors) are key elements that determine health outcomes -Top needs and barriers were identified as well potential suggestions for improvement and collaboration -Top Needs: -Health Literacy - Employment/Poverty - Mental/Behavioral Health -Cardiovascular Health (obesity, hypertension, stroke, & diabetes) - Maternal/Child Health focusing on promoting a healthy start for all children Top Barriers: -Focusing on the outcome and not the root of the problems (i.e. SDoH) -Lack of inter-agency collaboration/working in silos Suggestions for Improvement: -Leverage existing resources -Increase collaboration -Focus on Social Determinants of Health -Enhance behavioral health resources D) Social Determinants of Health (SDoH) Defined by the World Health Organization as the conditions in which people are born, grow, live, work and age. Methods -Reviewed data from Baltimore Neighborhood Indicator Alliance (Demographic data and SDoH data) -Reviewed data from identified 2011 Baltimore City Health Departments Baltimore City Neighborhood Profiles, -Reviewed Baltimore City Food Desert Map Results -Baltimore City Summary of CBSA targeted zip codes Top SDoHs: -Low Education Attainment (52.6% w/ less than HS degree) -High Poverty Rate (15.7%)/High Unemployment Rate (11%) -Violence -Poor Food Environment -Housing Instability E) Health Statistics/Indicators Methods Review annually and for this triennial survey the following: Local data sources: -Baltimore City Health Status Report -Baltimore Health Disparities Report Card -Baltimore Neighborhood Health Profiles -DHMH SHIP Biennial Progress Report 2012-2014 National trends and data: -Healthy People 2020 -County Health Rankings -Centers for Disease Control reports/updates Fat as in Fat: Executive Summary (RWJF) Results - Baltimore City Health Outcomes Summary for CBSA-targeted zip codes -Top 3 Causes of Death in Baltimore City in rank order: -Heart Disease -Cancer - Stroke -Cause of Pediatric Deaths -High rate of Infant Mortality Selecting Priorities Analysis of all quantitative and qualitative data described in the above section identified these top five areas of need within Baltimore City. These top priorities represent the intersection of documented unmet community health needs and the organizations key strengths and mission. These priorities were identified and approved by the Maryland General Hospital CHI Team and validated with the health experts from the UMB Campus Panel: 1. HIV Prevention 2. Substance Abuse Prevention (Smoking) 3. Diabetes Prevention Health Literacy (shared UMMS priority) In addition to the identified strategic priorities from the CHNA, Maryland General Hospital employs the following prioritization framework which is stated in the Maryland General Hospital Community Outreach Plan. Because the Medical Center, serves the region and state, priorities may need to be adjusted"

201631339349300108,520591667,Description of Community Served,"Schedule H, Part VI, Line 4 For purposes of community benefits programming to the State, the community benefit service area for Maryland General Hospital is defined as within Baltimore City. There are seven zip codes which specifically defines the target population: 21201, 21215, 21216, 21217, 21218, 21223, and 21229. Zip codes in this community are part of the federally designated West Baltimore Medicaid Health Professional Shortage Area (HPSA). This designation indicates that there is less than one primary care provider practicing in the area for every 3,000 Medicaid eligible community members. The populations in these zip codes are some of the most vulnerable, underserved residents in Baltimore City with significant health disparities when compared to other zip codes in Baltimore City and Maryland. Residents within the targeted zip codes face significant health disparities. Life expectancy in the target population is 62.9 years vs 71.8 years for Baltimore City overall and 82 years for Roland Park, an upscale Baltimore City neighborhood. Life expectancy is affected by chronic disease prevalence and uncontrolled risk factors, like hypertension. According to Marylands Statewide Health Improvement Plan (SHIP), ER visits due to hypertension are 658.9/100,000 population in Baltimore City as compared with 252.2/100,000 for Maryland, placing Baltimore City with the highest prevalence in the State. This 20-year disparity in life expectancy and quality of life is also profoundly affected by multiple social determinants of health (SDoH). While there are numerous social determinants which affect this population, the main SDOHs include the prevalence of food deserts, unemployment and poverty, transportation issues, and violence. Physical environment determinants include the prevalence of inadequate/unsafe housing, vacant homes, and high tobacco and alcohol store density. The following table illustrates demographics and some of the significant social determinants of health affecting the target population. For a more detailed analysis of these and other determinants of health in this population, please review Maryland General Hospitals FY2015 Community Health Needs Assessment at: http://ummidtown.org/~/media/systemhospitals/midtown/pdfs/aboutus/midtown- chna-executive-report-fy2015.pdf?la=en Target Population Description Target Population Total 260,969 (Male=120,058, Female=140,911) Median Age 34.6 years Race White/Caucasian 45,918 Black/African American 199,656 Amer Indian/Alaska Native 996 Asian 6,063 Native Hawaiian/Other Pacific 101 Other 1,797 Two or More Races 6,438 Ethnicity Hispanic 5,490 Non-Hispanic 255,479 Median Household Income $42,266 Percentage of households w/ incomes below the federal poverty guidelines 22.7% Percentage of uninsured people 14% Percentage of Medicaid recipients 30.9% Percentage of HS graduates 66% Unemployment Rate 21.9% - 28.6% No Vehicle Available 15.3% Severe Housing Problems 24% Healthy Food Availability Index 7.8-12.4 (Scale = 0-25) Tobacco Store Density 27.8- 51.4 stores/10,000 people"

EFFORTS ARE MADE TO COLLECT PATIENT LIABILITIES IN CERTAIN AREAS SUCH AS OPSU AND ADMISSIONS. INSURANCE COPAYS ARE ATTEMPTED TO BE COLLECTED IN THE EMERGENCY DEPARTMENT IN ACCORDANCE WITH EMTALA REGULATIONS. WHEN THERE IS A BALANCE DUE (SELF-PAY OR BALANCE AFTER INSURANCE) AND NO COLLECTION WAS MADE IN ADVANCE OF OR AT THE TIME OF SERVICE, A STATEMENT WILL BE SENT TO PATIENTS PROVIDING A PHONE NUMBER FOR THEM TO CALL AND DISCUSS PAYMENT OPTIONS. IF THE PATIENT DOES NOT CALL OR MAKE PAYMENT, A HOSPITAL REPRESENTATIVE WILL CALL HIM/HER TO DISCUSS THE AMOUNT DUE AND TO DETERMINE IF THEY ARE ELIGIBLE FOR ANY PROGRAMS OR INSURANCES OR TO MAKE PAYMENT ARRANGEMENTS THAT CAN HELP THE PATIENT.

RETROACTIVE ADJUSTMENTS ARE CONSIDERED IN THE RECOGNITION OF REVENUE ON AN ESTIMATED BASIS IN THE PERIOD THE RELATED SERVICES ARE RENDERED AND ADJUSTED IN FUTURE PERIODS AS FINAL SETTLEMENTS ARE DETERMINED. MEDICARE COST REPORTS FOR ALL YEARS THROUGH 2010 AND 2012 HAVE BEEN AUDITED AND FINAL SETTLED AS OF JUNE 30, 2015. THE 2011, 2013 AND 2014 MEDICARE COST REPORTS HAVE BEEN FILED AND ARE AWAITING FINAL SETTLEMENT AS OF JUNE 30, 2015. THE HOSPITAL DID NOT HAVE ANY AMOUNTS INCLUDED IN NET PATIENT SERVICE REVENUE FOR FISCAL YEAR 2015, RELATED TO THIRD-PARTY PAYORS FINAL SETTLEMENTS. INCLUDED IN THE HOSPITAL'S NET PATIENT SERVICE REVENUES ARE PAYMENTS MADE ON BEHALF OF THE MEDICARE AND MEDICAID PROGRAMS. THESE PAYMENTS REPRESENT 29% AND 5% OF NET PATIENT SERVICE REVENUE, RESPECTIVELY, FOR THE FISCAL YEAR ENDED JUNE 30, 2015. LAWS AND REGULATIONS GOVERNING THE MEDICARE AND MEDICAID PROGRAM PAYMENTS ARE COMPLEX AND SUBJECT TO INTERPRETATION. THE HOSPITAL BELIEVES THAT IT IS IN COMPLIANCE WITH ALL APPLICABLE LAWS AND REGULATIONS AS THEY RELATE TO THESE PROGRAMS. SUCH LAWS AND REGULATIONS CAN BE SUBJECT TO REVIEW AND INTERPRETATION BY THE MEDICARE AND MEDICAID PROGRAMS. CHARITY CARE THE HOSPITAL AND LHC, UNDER THEIR FINANCIAL ASSISTANCE POLICIES, PROVIDE A SIGNIFICANT AMOUNT OF SERVICES WITHOUT CHARGE OR AT AMOUNTS LESS THAN ESTABLISHED RATES TO PATIENTS WHO ARE UNABLE TO COMPENSATE EITHER ENTITY FOR THEIR TREATMENTS EITHER THROUGH THIRD PARTY COVERAGE OR THEIR OWN RESOURCES. BECAUSE THESE AMOUNTS ARE NOT EXPECTED TO BE PAID, THEY ARE NOT REPORTED AS REVENUE. THE COST OF THIS CARE IS BASED ON A CALCULATION WHICH APPLIES A RATIO OF COSTS TO CHARGES TO THE GROSS UNCOMPENSATED CHARGES ASSOCIATED WITH PROVIDING CARE TO THESE PATIENTS. THE RATIO OF COSTS TO CHARGES IS CALCULATED BASED ON THE TOTAL EXPENSES (LESS COMMUNITY BENEFIT EXPENSE) DIVIDED BY GROSS PATIENT SERVICE REVENUE. THE ESTIMATED COSTS OF CARING FOR THESE PATIENTS FOR THE YEAR ENDING JUNE 30, 2015 WAS $12,686,000. IN ADDITION, THE HOSPITAL AND LHC PROVIDE SERVICES AND SUPPLIES AT AMOUNTS BELOW COST TO PERSONS COVERED BY GOVERNMENT PROGRAMS, INCLUDING MEDICARE AND MEDICAID. THE HOSPITAL ALSO SPONSORS CERTAIN OTHER SUBSIDIZED PROGRAMS AND CHARITY SERVICES THAT PROVIDE SUBSTANTIAL BENEFIT TO THE BROADER COMMUNITY. SUCH SERVICES AND PROGRAMS INCLUDE COMMUNITY SERVICE PROGRAMS DESIGNED FOR SPECIFIC HEALTHCARE CONCERNS, INCLUDING HEALTH EDUCATION, SUPPORT GROUPS AND HEALTH SCREENINGS."
201641349349302609,231352152,"SCHEDULE H, PART III, SECTION B; LINE 8","FINANCIAL INFORMATION LISTED ON SCHEDULE H PART III LINES 5, 6 & 7 WERE DERIVED FROM THE HOSPITAL'S COST ACCOUNTING SYSTEM AND NOT THE 2014 FILED MEDICARE COST REPORT. USING THE COST REPORT WOULD RESULT IN AN INCREASE TO THE AMOUNT ON LINE 5 OF $8,892,812 AND A DECREASE TO LINE 6 OF $18,836,714. MEDICARE UNDERPAYMENTS AND BAD DEBT ARE COMMUNITY BENEFIT AND ASSOCIATED COSTS ARE INCLUDABLE ON THE FORM 990, SCHEDULE H, PART I. THE ORGANIZATION BELIEVES THAT MEDICARE UNDERPAYMENTS (SHORTFALL) AND BAD DEBT ARE COMMUNITY BENEFIT AND ASSOCIATED COSTS ARE INCLUDABLE ON THE FORM 990, SCHEDULE H, PART I. AS OUTLINED MORE FULLY BELOW THE ORGANIZATION BELIEVES THAT THESE SERVICES AND RELATED COSTS PROMOTE THE HEALTH OF THE COMMUNITY AS A WHOLE AND ARE RENDERED IN CONJUNCTION WITH THE ORGANIZATION'S CHARITABLE TAX-EXEMPT PURPOSES AND MISSION IN PROVIDING MEDICALLY NECESSARY HEALTHCARE SERVICES TO ALL INDIVIDUALS IN A NON-DISCRIMINATORY MANNER WITHOUT REGARD TO RACE, COLOR, NATIONAL ORIGIN, GENDER, GENDER IDENTITY OR EXPRESSION, SEXUAL ORIENTATION, RELIGION, AGE, STATUS AS AN INDIVIDUAL WITH A HANDICAP/DISABILITY OR ABILITY TO PAY AND CONSISTENT WITH THE COMMUNITY BENEFIT STANDARD PROMULGATED BY THE IRS. THE COMMUNITY BENEFIT STANDARD IS THE CURRENT STANDARD FOR A HOSPITAL FOR RECOGNITION AS A TAX-EXEMPT AND CHARITABLE ORGANIZATION UNDER INTERNAL REVENUE CODE (""IRC"") 501(C)(3). THE ORGANIZATION IS RECOGNIZED AS A TAX-EXEMPT ENTITY AND CHARITABLE ORGANIZATION UNDER 501(C)(3) OF THE IRC. ALTHOUGH THERE IS NO DEFINITION IN THE TAX CODE FOR THE TERM ""CHARITABLE"" A REGULATION PROMULGATED BY THE DEPARTMENT OF THE TREASURY PROVIDES SOME GUIDANCE AND STATES THAT ""THE TERM CHARITABLE IS USED IN SECTION 501(C)(3) IN ITS GENERALLY ACCEPTED LEGAL SENSE,"" AND PROVIDES EXAMPLES OF CHARITABLE PURPOSES, INCLUDING THE RELIEF OF THE POOR OR UNPRIVILEGED; THE PROMOTION OF SOCIAL WELFARE; AND THE ADVANCEMENT OF EDUCATION, RELIGION, AND SCIENCE. NOTE IT DOES NOT EXPLICITLY ADDRESS THE ACTIVITIES OF HOSPITALS. IN THE ABSENCE OF EXPLICIT STATUTORY OR REGULATORY REQUIREMENTS APPLYING THE TERM ""CHARITABLE"" TO HOSPITALS, IT HAS BEEN LEFT TO THE IRS TO DETERMINE THE CRITERIA HOSPITALS MUST MEET TO QUALIFY AS IRC 501(C)(3) CHARITABLE ORGANIZATIONS. THE ORIGINAL STANDARD WAS KNOWN AS THE CHARITY CARE STANDARD. THIS STANDARD WAS REPLACED BY THE IRS WITH THE COMMUNITY BENEFIT STANDARD WHICH IS THE CURRENT STANDARD. CHARITY CARE STANDARD IN 1956, THE IRS ISSUED REVENUE RULING 56-185, WHICH ADDRESSED THE REQUIREMENTS HOSPITALS NEEDED TO MEET IN ORDER TO QUALIFY FOR IRC 501(C)(3) STATUS. ONE OF THESE REQUIREMENTS IS KNOWN AS THE ""CHARITY CARE STANDARD."" UNDER THE STANDARD, A HOSPITAL HAD TO PROVIDE, TO THE EXTENT OF ITS FINANCIAL ABILITY, FREE OR REDUCED-COST CARE TO PATIENTS UNABLE TO PAY FOR IT. A HOSPITAL THAT EXPECTED FULL PAYMENT DID NOT, ACCORDING TO THE RULING, PROVIDE CHARITY CARE BASED ON THE FACT THAT SOME PATIENTS ULTIMATELY FAILED TO PAY. THE RULING EMPHASIZED THAT A LOW LEVEL OF CHARITY CARE DID NOT NECESSARILY MEAN THAT A HOSPITAL HAD FAILED TO MEET THE REQUIREMENT SINCE THAT LEVEL COULD REFLECT ITS FINANCIAL ABILITY TO PROVIDE SUCH CARE. THE RULING ALSO NOTED THAT PUBLICLY SUPPORTED COMMUNITY HOSPITALS WOULD NORMALLY QUALIFY AS CHARITABLE ORGANIZATIONS BECAUSE THEY SERVE THE ENTIRE COMMUNITY AND A LOW LEVEL OF CHARITY CARE WOULD NOT AFFECT A HOSPITAL'S EXEMPT STATUS IF IT WAS DUE TO THE SURROUNDING COMMUNITY'S LACK OF CHARITABLE DEMANDS. COMMUNITY BENEFIT STANDARD IN 1969, THE IRS ISSUED REVENUE RULING 69-545, WHICH ""REMOVE(D)"" FROM REVENUE RULING 56-185 ""THE REQUIREMENTS RELATING TO CARING FOR PATIENTS WITHOUT CHARGE OR AT RATES BELOW COST."" UNDER THE STANDARD DEVELOPED IN REVENUE RULING 69-545, WHICH IS KNOWN AS THE ""COMMUNITY BENEFIT STANDARD,"" HOSPITALS ARE JUDGED ON WHETHER THEY PROMOTE THE HEALTH OF A BROAD CLASS OF INDIVIDUALS IN THE COMMUNITY. THE RULING INVOLVED A HOSPITAL THAT ONLY ADMITTED INDIVIDUALS WHO COULD PAY FOR THE SERVICES (BY THEMSELVES, PRIVATE INSURANCE, OR PUBLIC PROGRAMS SUCH AS MEDICARE), BUT OPERATED A FULL-TIME EMERGENCY ROOM THAT WAS OPEN TO EVERYONE. THE IRS RULED THAT THE HOSPITAL QUALIFIED AS A CHARITABLE ORGANIZATION BECAUSE IT PROMOTED THE HEALTH OF PEOPLE IN ITS COMMUNITY. THE IRS REASONED THAT BECAUSE THE PROMOTION OF HEALTH WAS A CHARITABLE PURPOSE ACCORDING TO THE GENERAL LAW OF CHARITY, IT FELL WITHIN THE ""GENERALLY ACCEPTED LEGAL SENSE"" OF THE TERM ""CHARITABLE,"" AS REQUIRED BY TREAS. REG. 1.501(C)(3)-1(D)(2). THE IRS RULING STATED THAT THE PROMOTION OF HEALTH, LIKE THE RELIEF OF POVERTY AND THE ADVANCEMENT OF EDUCATION AND RELIGION, IS ONE OF THE PURPOSES IN THE GENERAL LAW OF CHARITY THAT IS DEEMED BENEFICIAL TO THE COMMUNITY AS A WHOLE EVEN THOUGH THE CLASS OF BENEFICIARIES ELIGIBLE TO RECEIVE A DIRECT BENEFIT FROM ITS ACTIVITIES DOES NOT INCLUDE ALL MEMBERS OF THE COMMUNITY, SUCH AS INDIGENT MEMBERS OF THE COMMUNITY, PROVIDED THAT THE CLASS IS NOT SO SMALL THAT ITS RELIEF IS NOT OF BENEFIT TO THE COMMUNITY. THE IRS CONCLUDED THAT THE HOSPITAL WAS ""PROMOTING THE HEALTH OF A CLASS OF PERSONS THAT IS BROAD ENOUGH TO BENEFIT THE COMMUNITY"" BECAUSE ITS EMERGENCY ROOM WAS OPEN TO ALL AND IT PROVIDED CARE TO EVERYONE WHO COULD PAY, WHETHER DIRECTLY OR THROUGH THIRD-PARTY REIMBURSEMENT. OTHER CHARACTERISTICS OF THE HOSPITAL THAT THE IRS HIGHLIGHTED INCLUDED THE FOLLOWING: ITS SURPLUS FUNDS WERE USED TO IMPROVE PATIENT CARE, EXPAND HOSPITAL FACILITIES, AND ADVANCE MEDICAL TRAINING, EDUCATION, AND RESEARCH; IT WAS CONTROLLED BY A BOARD OF TRUSTEES THAT CONSISTED OF INDEPENDENT CIVIC LEADERS; AND HOSPITAL MEDICAL STAFF PRIVILEGES WERE AVAILABLE TO ALL QUALIFIED PHYSICIANS. THE AMERICAN HOSPITAL ASSOCIATION (""AHA"") BELIEVES THAT MEDICARE UNDERPAYMENTS (SHORTFALL) AND BAD DEBT ARE COMMUNITY BENEFIT AND THUS INCLUDABLE ON THE FORM 990, SCHEDULE H, PART I. THIS ORGANIZATION AGREES WITH THE AHA POSITION. AS OUTLINED IN THE AHA LETTER TO THE IRS DATED AUGUST 21, 2007 WITH RESPECT TO THE FIRST PUBLISHED DRAFT OF THE NEW FORM 990 AND SCHEDULE H, THE AHA FELT THAT THE IRS SHOULD INCORPORATE THE FULL VALUE OF THE COMMUNITY BENEFIT THAT HOSPITALS PROVIDE BY COUNTING MEDICARE UNDERPAYMENTS (SHORTFALL) AS QUANTIFIABLE COMMUNITY BENEFIT FOR THE FOLLOWING REASONS: - PROVIDING CARE FOR THE ELDERLY AND SERVING MEDICARE PATIENTS IS AN ESSENTIAL PART OF THE COMMUNITY BENEFIT STANDARD. - MEDICARE, LIKE MEDICAID, DOES NOT PAY THE FULL COST OF CARE. RECENTLY, MEDICARE REIMBURSES HOSPITALS ONLY 92 CENTS FOR EVERY DOLLAR THEY SPEND TO TAKE CARE OF MEDICARE PATIENTS. THE MEDICARE PAYMENT ADVISORY COMMISSION (""MEDPAC"") IN ITS MARCH 2007 REPORT TO CONGRESS CAUTIONED THAT UNDERPAYMENT WILL GET EVEN WORSE, WITH MARGINS REACHING A 10-YEAR LOW AT NEGATIVE 5.4 PERCENT. - MANY MEDICARE BENEFICIARIES, LIKE THEIR MEDICAID COUNTERPARTS, ARE POOR. MORE THAN 46 PERCENT OF MEDICARE SPENDING IS FOR BENEFICIARIES WHOSE INCOME IS BELOW 200 PERCENT OF THE FEDERAL POVERTY LEVEL. MANY OF THOSE MEDICARE BENEFICIARIES ARE ALSO ELIGIBLE FOR MEDICAID -- SO CALLED ""DUAL ELIGIBLES."" THERE IS EVERY COMPELLING PUBLIC POLICY REASON TO TREAT MEDICARE AND MEDICAID UNDERPAYMENTS SIMILARLY FOR PURPOSES OF A HOSPITAL'S COMMUNITY BENEFIT AND INCLUDE THESE COSTS ON FORM 990, SCHEDULE H, PART I. MEDICARE UNDERPAYMENT MUST BE SHOULDERED BY THE HOSPITAL IN ORDER TO CONTINUE TREATING THE COMMUNITY'S ELDERLY AND POOR. THESE UNDERPAYMENTS REPRESENT A REAL COST OF SERVING THE COMMUNITY AND SHOULD COUNT AS A QUANTIFIABLE COMMUNITY BENEFIT. BOTH THE AHA AND THIS ORGANIZATION ALSO FEEL THAT PATIENT BAD DEBT IS A COMMUNITY BENEFIT AND THUS INCLUDABLE ON THE FORM 990, SCHEDULE H, PART I. LIKE MEDICARE UNDERPAYMENT (SHORTFALLS), THERE ALSO ARE COMPELLING REASONS THAT PATIENT BAD DEBT SHOULD BE COUNTED AS QUANTIFIABLE COMMUNITY BENEFIT AS FOLLOWS: - A SIGNIFICANT MAJORITY OF BAD DEBT IS ATTRIBUTABLE TO LOW-INCOME PATIENTS, WHO, FOR MANY REASONS, DECLINE TO COMPLETE THE FORMS REQUIRED TO ESTABLISH ELIGIBILITY FOR HOSPITALS' CHARITY CARE OR FINANCIAL ASSISTANCE PROGRAMS. A 2006 CONGRESSIONAL BUDGET OFFICE (""CBO"") REPORT, NONPROFIT HOSPITALS AND THE PROVISION OF COMMUNITY BENEFITS, CITED TWO STUDIES INDICATING THAT ""THE GREAT MAJORITY OF BAD DEBT WAS ATTRIBUTABLE TO PATIENTS WITH INCOMES BELOW 200% OF THE FEDERAL POVERTY LINE."" - THE REPORT ALSO NOTED THAT A SUBSTANTIAL PORTION OF BAD DEBT IS PENDING CHARITY CARE. UNLIKE BAD DEBT IN OTHER INDUSTRIES, HOSPITAL BAD DEBT IS COMPLICATED BY THE FACT THAT HOSPITALS FOLLOW THEIR MISSION TO THE COMMUNITY AND TREAT EVERY PATIENT THAT COMES THROUGH THEIR EMERGENCY DEPARTMENT, REGARDLESS OF ABILITY TO PAY. PATIENTS WHO HAVE OUTSTANDING BILLS ARE NOT TURNED AWAY, UNLIKE OTHER INDUSTRIES. BAD DEBT IS FURTHER COMPLICATED BY THE AUDITING INDUSTRY'S STANDARDS ON REPORTING CHARITY CARE. MANY PATIENTS CANNOT OR DO NOT PROVIDE THE NECESSARY, EXTENSIVE DOCUMENTATION REQUIRED TO BE DEEMED CHARITY CARE BY AUDITORS. AS A RESULT, ROUGHLY 40% OF BAD DEBT IS PENDING CHARITY CARE. -"
201641349349302609,231352152,"SCHEDULE H, PART III, SECTION C; QUESTION 9B","FOR THE ABINGTON HEALTH COMMUNITY, EVERY ATTEMPT WILL BE MADE TO IDENTIFY PATIENTS HAVING AN INABILITY TO PAY IN ORDER TO ASSESS THE PATIENT FOR FINANCIAL ASSISTANCE FROM EITHER OUTSIDE RESOURCES (E.G., MA, CHIP, ETC.) OR VIA THE HOSPITAL POLICY FOR FINANCIAL ASSISTANCE. PATIENTS WILL RECEIVE ONE (1) HOSPITAL GENERATED STATEMENT INDICATING THEIR RESPONSIBILITIES AND PAYMENT DUE DATES. THE STATEMENTS INCLUDE INFORMATION REGARDING THE AVAILABILITY OF FINANCIAL ASSISTANCE. IF, IN THE COURSE OF COMMUNICATION WITH THE PATIENT, THERE IS AN INDICATION THAT THE PATIENT CAN NOT PAY THE BALANCE, THE PATIENT IS GIVEN THE OPPORTUNITY TO SET UP A PAYMENT PLAN, AND WHERE APPROPRIATE, INFORMATION RELATED TO AVAILABLE FINANCIAL ASSISTANCE. ANYWHERE ALONG THE CONTINUUM OF COLLECTIONS, WHETHER IT BE VIA INTERNAL STAFF OR EXTENDED OUTSOURCED AGENCIES, PATIENTS ARE OFFERED THE OPPORTUNITY TO APPLY FOR FINANCIAL ASSISTANCE. FOR THE UNINSURED: AT THE TIME OF REGISTRATION, ABINGTON HEALTH FINANCIAL COUNSELING STAFF WILL DETERMINE THAT THE PATIENT IS UNINSURED. WHENEVER POSSIBLE, AN ASSESSMENT WILL BE DONE REGARDING ELIGIBILITY FOR MEDICAL ASSISTANCE AND/OR FINANCIAL ASSISTANCE. PATIENTS WITH THE DESIGNATION OF UNINSURED CAN AND SHOULD BE ENCOURAGED TO APPLY FOR THE FINANCIAL ASSISTANCE PROGRAM ANYTIME A HARDSHIP IN PAYING THE DISCOUNT AMOUNT IS IDENTIFIED. IF ASSISTANCE IS APPROVED, THE PERCENTAGE DISCOUNT WILL BE APPLIED TO THE MEDICARE FEE-FOR-SERVICE RATES IN PLACE AT THE TIME OF SERVICE. ACCOUNTS CONSIDERED TO BE CHARITY CARE ARE NOT INCLUDED IN THE BAD DEBT EXPENSE, BUT RATHER, ACCOUNTED FOR AS AN ALLOWANCE. IT IS THE POLICY OF THE ABINGTON HEALTH SYSTEM BUSINESS OFFICE, AND ALL ITS HOSPITAL AFFILIATES, TO TREAT ALL PATIENTS EQUALLY REGARDLESS OF INSURANCE AND THEIR ABILITY TO PAY. FOR ACCOUNTS DETERMINED TO BE ""SELF-PAY"" AND/OR ACCOUNTS WITH BALANCES AFTER PRIMARY INSURANCE PAYMENTS, THE COLLECTION POLICY REQUIRES: SENDING ONE STATEMENT, THEN REFERRAL TO AN OUTSIDE EXTENDED BUSINESS OFFICE AGENCY WHO PERFORMS FOLLOW UP VIA STATEMENTS AND TELEPHONE CONTACT FOR 90 DAYS.

PATIENTS NOT ELIGIBLE FOR CHARITY CARE AND/OR FINANCIAL ASSISTANCE WILL BE FINANCIALLY COUNSELED FOR ALL OTHER OPTIONS. QUALIFIED PATIENTS WILL BE REFERRED TO ALL APPROPRIATE AGENCIES OR PROGRAMS TO MEET OTHER FINANCIAL NEEDS. AT THE TIME OF THE PATIENT VISIT AND PART OF THE REGISTRATION PROCESS AT THE FACILITY, THE FOLLOWING OPTIONS ARE MADE AVAILABLE TO PATIENTS: - FINANCIAL COUNSELING FOR POSSIBLE ELIGIBILITY FOR MEDICAL ASSISTANCE INCLUDING MEDICAID AND SSI; - FINANCIAL COUNSELING FOR POSSIBLE ELIGIBILITY FOR THE HOSPITAL'S FINANCIAL ASSISTANCE PROGRAM; AND, - FINANCIAL ARRANGEMENTS INCLUDING: 1. CASH/CREDIT CARD (AMERICAN EXPRESS, DISCOVER, VISA, MASTERCARD), 2. FLEXIBLE PAYMENT PLANS. IN ADDITION TO THE ABOVE OPTIONS, THE FACILITY HAS ESTABLISHED A SELF-PAY ASSISTANCE PROGRAM FOR OUR UNINSURED PATIENTS THAT DO NOT QUALIFY FOR MEDICAID OR THE HOSPITAL'S FINANCIAL ASSISTANCE PROGRAM."
201641349349302609,231352152,"SCHEDULE H, PART VI; QUESTION 2","THE COLLABORATIVE PROCESS FOR ABINGTON HEALTH INCLUDING ABINGTON MEMORIAL HOSPITAL AND LANSDALE HOSPITAL CORPORATION BEGAN IN FEBRUARY 2011, WHEN THE DELAWARE VALLEY HEALTHCARE COUNCIL (""DVHC"") OF HAP (HOSPITAL ASSOCIATION OF PENNSYLVANIA) ESTABLISHED A COMMUNITY HEALTH NEEDS ASSESSMENT WORKGROUP TO ASSIST HOSPITALS IN UNDERSTANDING THE AFFORDABLE CARE ACT (""ACA"") REQUIREMENTS AND THE INTERNAL REVENUE SERVICE GUIDANCE AROUND COMMUNITY HEALTH NEEDS ASSESSMENTS. DVHC AND THE HOSPITAL WORKGROUPS IDENTIFIED BEST RESOURCES, TOOLS, AND SERVICES FOR CONDUCTING NEEDS ASSESSMENTS. THE 24-MEMBER WORKGROUP INCLUDED REPRESENTATIVES FROM 13 HOSPITALS AND HEALTH SYSTEMS REPRESENTING 35 OR (70 PERCENT) OF THE 48 DVHC-MEMBER NOT-FOR-PROFIT HOSPITAL FACILITIES IN BUCKS, CHESTER, DELAWARE, MONTGOMERY AND PHILADELPHIA COUNTIES. THE GROUP HELD A SERIES OF MEETINGS TO REVIEW ACA REQUIREMENTS WITH POLICY EXPERTS FROM THE AMERICAN HOSPITAL ASSOCIATION AND CONSIDERED THE TYPES OF RESOURCES THAT MIGHT BE NEEDED TO CONDUCT NEEDS ASSESSMENTS. UNDER THE WORKGROUP'S GUIDANCE, DVHC DEVELOPED A SCOPE OF WORK TO DEFINE THE RESEARCH SERVICES AND OTHER RESOURCES WHICH HOSPITALS MIGHT NEED TO ASSIST IN CONDUCTING COMMUNITY HEALTH NEEDS ASSESSMENTS. BASED ON THE SCOPE OF WORK, DVHC ISSUED A REQUEST FOR PROPOSAL TO IDENTIFY HIGHLY QUALIFIED RESEARCH PARTNERS WHO COULD SUPPORT HOSPITALS IN CONDUCTING NEEDS ASSESSMENTS. AFTER A RIGOROUS EVALUATION PROCESS THAT INCLUDED INTENSIVE INPUT FROM WORKGROUP MEMBERS, PUBLIC HEALTH MANAGEMENT CORPORATION (""PHMC"") WAS SELECTED AS THE MOST APPROPRIATE RESEARCH PARTNER. PHMC'S SELECTION WAS DUE IN PART TO THEIR COMMUNITY HEALTH DATA BASE'S IN-DEPTH, ZIP-CODE-LEVEL HEALTH INFORMATION FOR THE FIVE-COUNTY REGION. IN ADDITION, MANY HOSPITALS ARE FAMILIAR WITH THIS RESOURCE AND ARE OR HAVE BEEN DATABASE SUBSCRIBERS. WITH DIRECTION AND GUIDANCE FROM THE WORKGROUP, DVHC AND PHMC THEN COLLABORATED TO DEVELOP THE OVERALL APPROACH TO CONDUCTING NEEDS ASSESSMENTS FOR HOSPITALS WISHING TO PARTICIPATE IN THE PROGRAM. TWENTY-EIGHT DVHC MEMBER FACILITIES PARTICIPATED IN THE PROGRAM. ALL OF THIS COLLABORATION HAD ONE GOAL IN MIND: TO COMPLY WITH ALL IRS REGULATIONS AND REQUIREMENTS IN MEETING COMMUNITY BENEFIT AND CONDUCTING A QUALITY COMMUNITY HEALTH NEEDS ASSESSMENT PROCESS. AS A NON-PROFIT 501(C)(3) ORGANIZATION, ABINGTON HEALTH HAS A STRONG MISSION OF COMMUNITY SERVICE AND OUTREACH. IN THE SPRING OF 2013 (FY13) THE TWO HOSPITALS, ABINGTON MEMORIAL HOSPITAL AND LANSDALE HOSPITAL CORPORATION, COMPLETED COMPREHENSIVE COMMUNITY HEALTH NEEDS ASSESSMENTS TO GAUGE THE OVERALL HEALTH OF THE COMMUNITIES WE SERVE AND TO HELP SET THE AGENDA FOR PROGRAMS AND SERVICES IN THE YEARS TO COME. THE COMMUNITY HEALTH NEEDS ASSESSMENT PROVIDES A DEFINITION OF THE COMMUNITY, THE DEMOGRAPHIC AND SOCIOECONOMIC CHARACTERISTICS OF THE RESIDENTS, AND THE EXISTING HEALTHCARE RESOURCES. IMMEDIATELY FOLLOWING WERE THE NEEDS ASSESSMENTS PROCESS AND METHODS; FINDINGS; IDENTIFICATION OF UNMET NEEDS AND ASSET MAPPING. QUANTITATIVE INFORMATION FROM THE U.S. CENSUS, PENNSYLVANIA DEPARTMENT OF HEALTH VITAL STATISTICS AND PHMC'S SOUTHEASTERN PA HOUSEHOLD HEALTH SURVEY WAS ANALYZED FOR THE HOSPITAL'S SERVICE AREA USING THE STATISTICAL PROGRAM FOR SOCIAL SCIENCES (""SPSS""). THE UNMET HEALTHCARE NEEDS FOR THIS SERVICE AREA WERE IDENTIFIED AND PRIORITIZED BY COMPARING THE HEALTH STATUS, ACCESS TO CARE, HEALTH BEHAVIORS, AND UTILIZATION OF SERVICES FOR RESIDENTS OF THE SERVICE AREA TO RESULTS FOR THE COUNTY AND STATE AND THE HEALTHY PEOPLE 2020 GOALS FOR THE NATION. IN ADDITION, FOR HOUSEHOLD HEALTH SURVEY MEASURES, TESTS OF SIGNIFICANCE WERE CONDUCTED TO IDENTIFY AND PRIORITIZE. THIS ORGANIZATION CONDUCTS A REVIEW OF KEY FACTOR INFORMATION ANNUALLY WHICH INCLUDES: A REVIEW OF HEALTHCARE UTILIZATION OF ITS SERVICE AREA POPULATION BY SERVICES (UROLOGY, CARDIOLOGY, OBSTETRICS, ETC.) FOR DETERMINING INCREASED OR DECREASED HEALTH NEEDS; HEALTHCARE SERVICE ESTIMATES AND FORECASTS (BOTH INPATIENT AND OUTPATIENT); ASSESSMENTS OF LOCAL DEMOGRAPHIC AND SOCIOECONOMIC INFORMATION; AND, A REVIEW OF HEALTH STATUS/NEEDS ASSESSMENTS AND STUDIES CONDUCTED BY EXTERNAL PARTIES INCLUDING PUBLIC HEALTH MANAGEMENT CORPORATION (""PHMC"") HOUSEHOLD HEALTH SURVEY DATA; HEALTHY PEOPLE 2020; PA DEPARTMENT OF HEALTH, BUREAU OF HEALTH STATISTICS AND RESEARCH; BEHAVIORAL RISKS OF PA ADULTS; MINORITY HEALTH DISPARITIES IN PENNSYLVANIA; DEATH RATES IN PA, MONTGOMERY COUNTY AND SOUTHEASTERN PENNSYLVANIA; COUNTY HEALTH RANKINGS; NATIONAL ORGANIZATION WEBSITES, I.E., AMERICAN DIABETES ASSOCIATION, AMERICAN HEART ASSOCIATION AND AMERICAN STROKE ASSOCIATION. THIS ORGANIZATION CONDUCTS AN EXTENSIVE SERVICE AREA POPULATION PHYSICIAN NEED STUDY (BY PRIMARY AND SPECIALTY) EVERY THREE TO FIVE YEARS. SPECIFIC SPECIALTY NEEDS ARE CONDUCTED FOR IDENTIFIED GAPS IN SERVICE. THESE REVIEWS INFORM MEDICAL STAFF DEVELOPMENT AT THE MEDICAL CENTER TO ASSURE RESPONSIVENESS TO IDENTIFIED COMMUNITY NEEDS. IN ADDITION, THIS ORGANIZATION WORKS WITH LOCAL PROVIDERS TO PLAN AND DISCUSS HEALTH NEEDS OF THE POPULATION.

SATISFYING THE ""COMMUNITY BENEFIT STANDARD,"" AS ARTICULATED BY THE INTERNAL REVENUE SERVICE (IRS) IN REVENUE RULING 69-545, IS CURRENTLY REQUIRED FOR A HOSPITAL TO BE RECOGNIZED AS A CHARITABLE ORGANIZATION UNDER INTERNAL REVENUE CODE (IRC) 501(C)(3). THIS RULING REMOVED THE PREVIOUS REQUIREMENT OF REVENUE RULING 56-185, KNOWN AS THE ""CHARITY CARE STANDARD,"" THAT IN ORDER TO BE A CHARITABLE ORGANIZATION, A HOSPITAL HAD TO PROVIDE, TO THE EXTENT OF ITS FINANCIAL ABILITY, FREE OR REDUCED-COST CARE TO PATIENTS UNABLE TO PAY FOR THEIR CARE. THIS EARLIER RULING EMPHASIZED THAT A LOW LEVEL OF CHARITY CARE DID NOT MEAN THAT A HOSPITAL WAS NOT CHARITABLE SINCE THAT LEVEL COULD REFLECT THE HOSPITAL'S FINANCIAL ABILITY TO PROVIDE SUCH CARE. REVENUE RULING 56-185 ALSO NOTED THAT PUBLICLY SUPPORTED COMMUNITY HOSPITALS WOULD NORMALLY QUALIFY AS CHARITABLE BECAUSE THEY SERVE THE ENTIRE COMMUNITY AND A LOW LEVEL OF CHARITY CARE WOULD NOT IMPACT A HOSPITAL'S CHARITABLE STATUS IF IT WAS DUE TO THE SURROUNDING COMMUNITY'S LACK OF CHARITABLE DEMANDS. REVENUE RULING 69-545 INVOLVED A HOSPITAL THAT ONLY ADMITTED THOSE WHO COULD PAY FOR THE SERVICES EITHER BY THEMSELVES, THROUGH PRIVATE INSURANCE OR PUBLIC PROGRAMS SUCH AS MEDICARE. IN ADDITION, THE HOSPITAL OPERATED A FULL-TIME EMERGENCY ROOM THAT WAS OPEN TO EVERYONE. THE IRS RULED THAT THE HOSPITAL WAS CHARITABLE BECAUSE IT PROMOTED THE HEALTH OF PEOPLE IN ITS COMMUNITY. THE IRS REASONED THAT BECAUSE THE PROMOTION OF HEALTH WAS CHARITABLE PURPOSE ACCORDING TO THE GENERAL LAW OF CHARITY, IT FELL WITHIN THE ""GENERALLY ACCEPTED LEGAL SENSE"" OF THE TERM CHARITABLE, AS REQUIRED BY TREASURY REGULATION SECTION 1.501(C)(3)-1(D)(2). THE IRS RULED THAT THE PROMOTION OF HEALTH, LIKE RELIEF OF POVERTY AND THE ADVANCEMENT OF EDUCATION AND RELIGION, IS ONE OF THE PURPOSES OF THE GENERAL LAW OF CHARITY THAT IS DEEMED BENEFICIAL TO THE COMMUNITY AS A WHOLE EVEN THOUGH THE CLASS OF BENEFICIARIES ELIGIBLE TO RECEIVE A DIRECT BENEFIT FROM ITS ACTIVITIES DOES NOT INCLUDE ALL MEMBERS OF THE COMMUNITY, SUCH AS INDIGENT MEMBERS OF THE COMMUNITY, PROVIDED THAT THE CLASS IS NOT SO SMALL THAT ITS RELIEF IS NOT OF BENEFIT TO THE COMMUNITY. THE IRS CONCLUDED THAT THE HOSPITAL WAS ""PROMOTING THE HEALTH OF A CLASS OF PERSONS THAT IS BROAD ENOUGH TO BENEFIT THE COMMUNITY"" BECAUSE ITS EMERGENCY ROOM WAS OPEN TO ALL AND IT PROVIDED CARE TO THOSE WHO COULD PAY, WHETHER DIRECTLY OR THROUGH THIRD-PARTY REIMBURSEMENT. OTHER FACTORS THAT DEMONSTRATED COMMUNITY BENEFIT INCLUDED: SURPLUS FUNDS WERE USED TO IMPROVE PATIENT CARE, EXPAND FACILITIES AND ADVANCE MEDICAL TRAINING, EDUCATION AND RESEARCH; AND IT WAS CONTROLLED BY A BOARD OF DIRECTORS THAT CONSISTED OF INDEPENDENT CIVIC LEADERS. THE AMERICAN HOSPITAL ASSOCIATION (""AHA"") HOLDS THE POSITION THAT MEDICARE UNDERPAYMENTS (SHORTFALLS) AND BAD DEBT SHOULD BE REPORTED AS COMMUNITY BENEFIT ON FORM 990, SCHEDULE H, PART I, LINE 7. IN A LETTER TO THE IRS DATED AUGUST 21, 2007 RESPONDING TO A DRAFT OF THE NEW FORM 990 AND SCHEDULE H, THE AHA ARGUES THAT MEDICARE UNDERPAYMENTS (SHORTFALLS) IS COMMUNITY BENEFIT FOR THE FOLLOWING REASONS: -PROVIDING CARE FOR THE ELDERLY AND SERVING MEDICARE PATIENTS REMAINS AN ESSENTIAL PART OF THE COMMUNITY BENEFIT STANDARD. -MEDICARE, LIKE MEDICAID, DOES NOT PAY THE FULL COST OF CARE. RECENTLY, MEDICARE REIMBURSES ONLY 92 CENTS FOR EVERY DOLLAR HOSPITALS SPEND TO CARE FOR MEDICARE PATIENTS. THE MEDICARE PAYMENT ADVISORY COMMISSION IN ITS MARCH 2007 REPORT CAUTIONED THAT UNDERPAYMENT WILL GET EVEN WORSE. -MANY MEDICARE PATIENTS, LIKE THEIR MEDICAID COUNTERPARTS, ARE POOR. MORE THAN 46% OF MEDICARE SPENDING IS FOR BENEFICIARIES WHOSE INCOME IS BELOW 200% OF THE FEDERAL POVERTY LEVEL. MANY ARE ALSO ELIGIBLE FOR MEDICAID, SO CALLED -DUAL ELIGIBLES"". PENNSYLVANIA REQUIRES NON-PROFIT HOSPITALS LIKE GLH TO PROVIDE A MINIMUM LEVEL OF COMMUNITY BENEFIT TO RETAIN EXEMPTION FROM STATE AND LOCAL TAXES. ACCORDING TO STATE GUIDANCE AND CASE LAW, THE UNREIMBURSED COST OF MEDICARE AND BAD DEBT IS CONSIDERED TO BE COMMUNITY BENEFIT FOR STATE TAX EXEMPTION PURPOSES. GLH CONSIDERS THE TOTAL MEDICARE UNDERPAYMENTS (SHORTFALL) OF 6,695,517 SHOULD BE REPORTED AS COMMUNITY BENEFIT ON THE FORM 990, SCHEDULE H, PART I, LINE 7. ALONG WITH PROVIDING CARE TO MEDICAID PATIENTS AND PROVIDING FREE OR DISCOUNTED CARE TO OTHER LOW INCOME PATIENTS, THE IRS COMMUNITY BENEFIT STANDARD INCLUDES THE PROVISION OF CARE TO THE ELDERLY AND MEDICARE PATIENTS. FOR MANY OF THE MEDICAL SERVICES PROVIDED BY THE HOSPITAL, MEDICARE DOES NOT PROVIDE SUFFICIENT REIMBURSEMENT TO COVER THE COST OF PROVIDING CARE TO THESE PATIENTS, FORCING GLH TO USE OTHER FUNDS TO COVER THE SHORTFALL. MEDICARE SHORTFALLS MUST BE ABSORBED BY GLH IN ORDER TO CONTINUE TREATING THE ELDERLY IN OUR COMMUNITY. GLH PROVIDES CARE REGARDLESS OF THE MEDICARE SHORTFALL AND IS THEREBY PROVIDING ACCESS TO MEDICAL SERVICES FOR THE ELDERLY AND RELIEVING THE FEDERAL GOVERNMENT OF THE BURDEN OF PAYING THE FULL COST FOR PROVIDING CARE TO MEDICARE PATIENTS. ABSENT THE MEDICARE PROGRAM, IT IS LIKELY THAT MEDICARE PATIENTS WOULD BE ELIGIBLE FOR CHARITY CARE OR OTHER NEEDS BASED GOVERNMENT PROGRAMS. THE AMOUNT EXPENDED TO COVER THE SHORTFALL IS MONEY NOT AVAILABLE FOR FINANCIAL ASSISTANCE AND OTHER COMMUNITY BENEFIT NEEDS. BOTH GLH AND THE AHA BELIEVE THAT PATIENT BAD DEBT (PART III, LINE 3) BE REPORTED AS A COMMUNITY BENEFIT ON FORM 990, SCHEDULE H, PART I, LINE 7. LIKE MEDICARE UNDERPAYMENTS (SHORTFALLS), BAD DEBT SHOULD BE REPORTED AS COMMUNITY BENEFIT BECAUSE: -A SIGNIFICANT PORTION OF BAD DEBT IS ATTRIBUTABLE TO LOW-INCOME PATIENTS, WHO FOR MANY REASONS DECLINE TO COMPLETE THE FORMS REQUIRED TO ESTABLISH ELIGIBILITY UNDER GLH'S CHARITY CARE OR FINANCIAL ASSISTANCE POLICY (FAP). A 2006 CONGRESSIONAL BUDGET OFFICE (""CBO""), ""NONPROFIT HOSPITALS AND THE PROVISION OF COMMUNITY BENEFIT"", CITED TWO STUDIES INDICATING THAT ""THE GREAT MAJORITY OF BAD DEBT WAS ATTRIBUTABLE TO PATIENTS WITH INCOMES BELOW 200% OF THE FEDERAL POVERTY LINE."" -THE CBO REPORT ALSO NOTED THAT A SUBSTANTIAL PORTION OF THE BAD DEBT IS PENDING CHARITY CARE. UNLIKE BAD DEBT IN OTHER INDUSTRIES, HOSPITAL BAD DEBT IS COMPLICATED BY THE FACT THAT HOSPITALS FOLLOW THEIR CHARITABLE MISSION TO THE COMMUNITY AND TREAT EVERY PATIENT THAT COMES THROUGH THE EMERGENCY DEPARTMENT, REGARDLESS OF ABILITY TO PAY. PATIENTS WHO HAVE OUTSTANDING BILLS ARE NOT TURNED AWAY, UNLIKE OTHER INDUSTRIES. BAD DEBT IS FURTHER COMPLICATED BY THE AUDITING INDUSTRY'S STANDARDS ON REPORTING CHARITY CARE. MANY PATIENTS CANNOT OR DO NOT PROVIDE THE NECESSARY DOCUMENTATION REQUIRED TO BE DEEMED CHARITY CARE BY AUDITORS. AS A RESULT, ACCORDING THE CBO REPORT, ROUGHLY 40% OF BAD DEBT IS PENDING CHARITY CARE. (IN FY 2015, APPROXIMATELY 40% OF GLH'S BAD DEBT WAS SUBSEQUENTLY RECLASSIFIED TO CHARITY CARE.) THE CBO CONCLUDED THAT ITS FINDINGS ""SUPPORT THE VALIDITY OF THE USE OF UNCOMPENSATED CARE (BAD DEBT AND CHARITY CARE) AS A MEASURE OF COMMUNITY BENEFITS"" ASSUMING THE FINDINGS ARE GENERALIZED NATIONALLY. THE EXPERIENCE OF HOSPITALS NATIONWIDE REINFORCE THAT THEY ARE GENERALIZABLE. AS OUTLINED BY THE AHS, DESPITE THE HOSPITAL'S BEST EFFORTS AND DUE DILIGENCE, PATIENT BAD DEBT IS A PART OF THE CHARITABLE MISSION AND CHARITABLE PURPOSES. BAD DEBT REPRESENTS PART OF THE BURDEN HOSPITALS' SHOULDER IN SERVING ALL PATIENTS REGARDLESS OF RACE, COLOR, CREED, SEX, NATIONAL ORIGIN, RELIGION OR ABILITY TO PAY. IN ADDITION, THE HOSPITAL INVESTS SIGNIFICANT RESOURCES IN SYSTEMS AND STAFF TRAINING TO ASSIST PATIENTS THAT ARE IN NEED OF FINANCIAL ASSISTANCE."

THE COMMITTEE IS COMPOSED OF FORMER AND CURRENT PATIENTS, AS WELL AS COMMUNITY MEMBERS. MEMBERS GIVE INSIGHT INTO WHAT THE COMMUNITY IS SAYING ABOUT THE HOSPITAL AND SUGGESTIONS FOR CHANGES TO MAKE THE HOSPITAL EXPERIENCE MORE PATIENT- FOCUSED. THE MARKETING ADVISORY COMMITTEE'S PURPOSE IS TO PROVIDE GUIDANCE FOR THE HOSPITAL'S MARKETING AND OUTREACH EFFORTS. MEDICAL STAFF SURVEYS: THE PRIMARY OBJECTIVE OF THE MEDICAL STAFF ASSESSMENT PROCESS WAS TO CREATE A MEDICAL STAFF DEVELOPMENT PLAN FOR GLH THAT PROJECTS THE NEEDS FOR PHYSICIANS OVER THE NEXT SEVERAL YEARS, BY SPECIALTY, IN THE HOSPITAL'S PRIMARY AND SECONDARY SERVICE AREAS. IN ADDITION, THE SURVEY WAS USED TO CREATE A PHYSICIAN RECRUITMENT STRATEGY FOR THE HOSPITAL AND MEMBERS OF THE MEDICAL STAFF.

SINCE 1989, THE PENNSYLVANIA DEPARTMENT OF HEALTH HAS RELEASED ANNUAL REPORTS USING BRFSS DATA ON VARIOUS HEALTH RISK BEHAVIORS, SUCH AS SMOKING, DRINKING, SEAT BELT USAGE AND HEALTH STATUS. HOW IS ALL OF THE ABOVE INFORMATION PULLED TOGETHER AND UTILIZED? VARIOUS HOSPITAL STAFF MEMBERS ASSIST WITH THE DATA COLLECTION. PRIMARY AND SECONDARY DATA IS ORGANIZED INTO COMPUTER FILES TO MAKE THE INFORMATION EASIER TO USE AND ANALYZE. ONCE THE HOSPITAL HAS THE PRIMARY AND SECONDARY DATA COLLECTED AND IN HAND, THE SENIOR TEAM SPENDS TIME ANALYZING THE DATA TO DISCERN PATTERNS AND THEMES. ASSESSMENT DATA FINDINGS ARE SHARED WITH A VARIETY OF GROUPS INTERNALLY AND EXTERNALLY (MANAGEMENT STAFF, MEDICAL- DENTAL STAFF, BOARD OF TRUSTEES, COMMUNITY ORGANIZATIONS). SINCE SUFFICIENT RESOURCES ARE NOT AVAILABLE TO ADDRESS ALL THE HEALTH CONCERNS IDENTIFIED IN THE ASSESSMENTS, CHOICES MUST BE MADE ABOUT WHICH ISSUES ARE DESIGNATED AS PRIORITIES FOR ACTION IN THE SHORT TO INTERMEDIATE TERM (ONE TO THREE YEARS). IN GENERAL, THE HOSPITAL ADDRESSES THREE TO FOUR PRIORITIES. THE HOSPITAL COLLABORATES WITH OTHER COMMUNITY STAKEHOLDERS TO GAIN A GREATER COMMITMENT TO ACTION. A CONSENSUS IS REACHED WITH INPUT FROM HOSPITAL STAFF, MEDICAL STAFF, THE BOARD OF TRUSTEES, AND COMMUNITY MEMBERS. CRITERIA THAT ARE USED TO IDENTIFY THE MOST SIGNIFICANT HEALTH ISSUES INCLUDE: THE MAGNITUDE OF THE PROBLEM THE SEVERITY OF THE PROBLEM A HIGH NEED AMONG VULNERABLE POPULATIONS CRITERIA THAT ARE USED TO EVALUATE WHICH HEALTH ISSUES THE HOSPITAL SHOULD PRIORITIZE INCLUDE: THE HOSPITAL'S CAPACITY TO ACT ON THE ISSUE, INCLUDING ECONOMIC,SOCIAL, AND CULTURAL CONSIDERATIONS. THE FEASIBILITY OF HAVING A MEASURABLE IMPACT ON THE ISSUE COMMUNITY RESOURCES ALREADY FOCUSED ON THE ISSUE WHETHER THE ISSUE IS A ROOT CAUSE OF OTHER PROBLEMS (THEREBY POSSIBLY AFFECTING MULTIPLE ISSUES) WHEN THE ISSUES HAVE BEEN PRIORITIZED, THE SENIOR TEAM AND BOARD OF TRUSTEES DISCUSS THE PRIORITIZED LIST AND ASK FOR ADDITIONAL INPUT AND VALIDATION.

THIS RURAL AREA CONTAINS SOME 145,000 PEOPLE SPREAD OVER MORE THAN 2,500 SQUARE MILES OF RUGGED TERRAIN LOCATED IN THE HEART OF THE APPALACHIAN MOUNTAINS IN CENTRAL PENNSYLVANIA. THE AVERAGE POPULATION DENSITY IS APPROXIMATELY 60 PERSONS PER SQUARE MILE. THE JUNIATA RIVER RUNS ALONG THE VERDANT VALLEYS AND SLICES THROUGH NARROW MOUNTAIN PASSES TO CONNECT OUR RESIDENTS TOGETHER, WHICH IS WHY OUR AREA IS CALLED THE JUNIATA VALLEY. TRANSPORTATION BARRIERS PLAY A MAJOR ROLE IN ACCESS TO HEALTH CARE IN OUR REGION. THESE NATURAL BARRIERS INCLUDE NARROW ROADS THAT EITHER MEANDER ALONG STREAMS AND CREEKS OR CROSSOVER THE MOUNTAIN RANGES THAT TRAVERSE OUR APPALACHIAN RIDGE REGION. THESE BARRIERS ARE EVEN MORE DAUNTING GIVEN HAZARDOUS WINTER DRIVING CONDITIONS CAUSED BY SNOW OR ICE COVERED ROADS. LOW-INCOME AND SENIOR CITIZENS ALSO FACE TRANSPORTATION ISSUES, AS THERE IS NO PUBLIC TRANSPORTATION IN OUR SERVICE AREA. SENIOR CITIZENS AND MEDICAID-ELIGIBLE PERSONS CAN USE THE ""CARS"" VAN SYSTEM FOR TRANSPORTATION TO REGULARLY SCHEDULED APPOINTMENTS WITH A WEEKS' NOTICE BUT NOT FOR URGENT OR EMERGENCY CARE. LOW INCOME CITIZENS HAVE NO ACCESS TO ANY PUBLIC TRANSPORTATION AT ALL IN OUR COMMUNITY. IF A TRIP TO A SPECIALIST IS REQUIRED THE MAJOR SUPPORT HOSPITALS ARE OVER ONE AND HALF HOURS DRIVE. THE POPULATION OF OUR TOTAL SERVICE AREA IS JUST ABOUT 145,000 PERSONS BASED ON 2010 US CENSUS DATA. MIFFLIN COUNTY HAS A RELATIVELY FLAT GROWTH RATE WITH A POPULATION CHANGE OF 0.4% FROM 2000 TO 2010. JUNIATA COUNTY, ON THE OTHER HAND, HAS SEEN SIGNIFICANT GROWTH WITH A 10.6% INCREASE IN POPULATION FROM 2000 TO 2010. IT IS BELIEVED THAT THIS GROWTH IS MOSTLY COMING FROM PEOPLE WHO WORK IN THE NEARBY HARRISBURG AREA WHO ARE LOOKING FOR A LOWER COST OF LIVING. WITH THE RECENT COMPLETION OF A NEW FOUR-LANE HIGHWAY NORTH OF HARRISBURG, THE COMMUTE TO HARRISBURG HAS BECOME MORE CONVENIENT RESULTING IN AN INCREASE IN JUNIATA COUNTY'S POPULATION AS PEOPLE MOVE FURTHER AWAY FROM THE URBAN AREAS TO LIVE IN THE COUNTRY. HIGHER GROWTH IN FULTON COUNTY IS EXPLAINED BY MIGRATION FROM MARYLAND AS PEOPLE TRY TO MOVE AWAY FROM HIGHER HOUSING COSTS IN MARYLAND. HUNTINGDON COUNTY'S GROWTH IS MOSTLY OCCURRING IN THE NORTHERN PORTION OF THE COUNTY THAT IS CLOSE ENOUGH TO STATE COLLEGE TO ALLOW RESIDENTS TO COMMUTE TO PENN STATE UNIVERSITY. THESE GROWTH RATES ARE STILL VERY LOW WHEN COMPARED TO A NATIONAL GROWTH RATE OF OVER 13%. OTHER IMPORTANT DEMOGRAPHIC STATISTICS ARE OUTLINED BELOW.

THE PENNSYLVANIA AVERAGE FOR THIS STATISTIC IS 15.4%. BOTH MIFFLIN AND JUNIATA COUNTIES HAVE HIGHER PERCENTAGES OF PERSONS LESS THAN 18 YEARS OF AGE, 23.1% AND 24.0% RESPECTIVELY, THAN THE PA AVERAGE OF 22.0%. BOTH OF THESE GROUPS REQUIRE MORE HEALTH CARE RESOURCES THAN OTHER AGE GROUPS IN OUR COMMUNITY. MIFFLIN COUNTY HAS 16.6% OF THE POPULATION WITH INCOME BELOW THE POVERTY LINE AND 28.1% OF CHILDREN UNDER 18 LIVING IN POVERTY. JUNIATA COUNTY HAS 11.1% OF THE POPULATION WITH INCOME BELOW THE POVERTY LINE, WHILE HUNTINGDON AND SNYDER COUNTIES ARE 13% AND 14% RESPECTIVELY.

THIS MISSION STATEMENT HAS BEEN SUMMARIZED INTO FOUR WORDS - ""HEAL. TEACH. DISCOVER. SERVE."" HISTORY. GEISINGER HAD ITS BEGINNINGS IN THE SMALL COMMUNITY OF DANVILLE, WHICH IS LOCATED IN CENTRAL PENNSYLVANIA ON THE NORTHERN BRANCH OF THE SUSQUEHANNA RIVER. THERE, IN 1915, ABIGAIL A. GEISINGER FOUNDED THE GEORGE F. GEISINGER MEMORIAL HOSPITAL IN MEMORY OF HER HUSBAND. FROM THE BEGINNING, THE NEW HOSPITAL WAS DESIGNED AS A COMPREHENSIVE HEALTHCARE INSTITUTION THAT WOULD OFFER SPECIALIZED MEDICAL CARE TO PEOPLE IN THE RURAL AREAS OF CENTRAL AND NORTHEASTERN PENNSYLVANIA. UNLIKE MOST HEALTHCARE SYSTEMS, WHICH EVOLVED WITH A HOSPITAL FOCUS, GEISINGER'S HISTORY AND TRADITION IS THAT OF A PHYSICIAN-LED AND PHYSICIAN-DRIVEN HEALTHCARE ORGANIZATION. THIS TRADITION BEGAN WHEN MRS. GEISINGER BROUGHT DR. HAROLD FOSS, A MAYO CLINIC TRAINED PHYSICIAN, TO BE HER HOSPITAL'S FIRST CHIEF OF STAFF. TODAY, GEISINGER IS REGARDED AS A NATIONAL MODEL OF HEALTHCARE DELIVERY CENTERED ON A SOPHISTICATED MULTISPECIALTY GROUP PRACTICE. SINCE THE 1970S, GEISINGER'S STRATEGY OF INTEGRATING PHYSICIANS AND HOSPITALS EXPANDED TO INCLUDE THE MANAGEMENT OF HEALTH AND THE FINANCING OF HEALTHCARE SERVICES THROUGH ITS WHOLLY CONTROLLED HEALTH MAINTENANCE ORGANIZATION, GEISINGER HEALTH PLAN.

PART VI, LINE 4: THE MEDICAL CENTER IS LOCATED IN SUSSEX COUNTY, THE SOUTHERN-MOST OF THREE DELAWARE COUNTIES, WHICH CONSISTS OF 938 SQUARE MILES, OR 48% OF DELAWARE'S ENTIRE LAND AREA. BECAUSE OF ITS CLIMATE AND LOW PROPERTY TAXES, SUSSEX COUNTY HAS BECOME AN ATTRACTIVE RETIREMENT COMMUNITY. ALL OF THE COUNTY'S GROWTH OVER THE NEXT DECADE IS PROJECTED TO COME FROM PERSONS MOVING INTO THE COUNTY. TRADITIONALLY, SUSSEX COUNTY HAS BEEN REGARDED AS A RURAL AGRICULTURAL AREA. IN MANY RESPECTS, IT REMAINS AN AGRICULTURAL AREA WITH 167 PERSONS PER SQUARE MILE COMPARED WITH THE STATEWIDE AVERAGE OF 401 PERSONS. HOWEVER, THE EASTERN EDGE OF SUSSEX COUNTY THAT FRONTS ON THE DELAWARE BAY AND ATLANTIC OCEAN HAS BECOME A MAJOR TOURIST RESORT AND, MOST RECENTLY, A FAVORED RETIREMENT AREA, RETAIL, AND HOSPITALITY CENTER. EASTERN AND SOUTHEASTERN SUSSEX COUNTY, WHICH IS BEEBE MEDICAL CENTER'S PRIMARY SERVICE AREA, IS PARTICULARLY ATTRACTIVE DUE TO ITS PROXIMITY TO THE ATLANTIC OCEAN AND DELAWARE BAY. AS A RESULT, THE MEDICAL CENTER GENERALLY EXPERIENCES A SIGNIFICANT INCREASE IN PATIENT VISITS DURING THE SUMMER PERIODS. THE RETIREMENT AGE GROUP IS THE FASTEST GROWING SEGMENT OF THE POPULATION IN THE MEDICAL CENTER'S SERVICE AREA DUE TO THE MANY RETIREMENT COMMUNITIES THAT HAVE DEVELOPED IN THE SUSSEX COUNTY AREA. WITH THE 2000 CENSUS, THE MEDICARE AGE GROUP COMPRISED 22% OF THE POPULATION IN THE MEDICAL CENTER'S PRIMARY SERVICE AREA, COMPARED WITH 18.5% FOR ALL OF SUSSEX COUNTY. THE 10-YEAR (1990-2000) NATIONAL GROWTH RATE OF PERSONS AGE 65 AND OLDER WAS AT 12%, WHILE IN DELAWARE, THE RATE WAS 26%. HOWEVER, IN SUSSEX COUNTY, THE 10-YEAR GROWTH RATE OF PERSONS AGE 65 AND OLDER IS 53%, OR FOUR TIMES THE NATIONAL AVERAGE AND TWICE THE STATEWIDE AVERAGE. THE POPULATION OF SUSSEX COUNTY INCREASED 37.8% BETWEEN 2000 AND 2010, GROWING TO 215,000 PEOPLE IN 2010 RESIDING YEAR-ROUND IN THE HOSPITAL'S SERVICE AREA. THE MOST RECENT POPULATION GROWTH PROJECTION FOR PERSONS OLDER THAN 65 YEARS FOR THE MEDICAL CENTER'S PRIMARY SERVICE AREA IS EXPECTED TO BE 24.3%.

Each semester, three classes of students spend 7.5 hours a week working with staff in a variety of roles and departments. Established in 1970, USCs Med-COR Program, which stands for Medical Counseling Organizing and Recruiting, works with high school students of color to help prepare them for careers in the health professions. Students are provided structured academic enrichment in the areas of mathematics, science, and English as well as academic counseling, SAT assistance, and summer internships at local hospitals. The program serves students from four local schools: Francisco Bravo Medical Magnet High School, King-Drew Medical Magnet High School, Orthopaedic Hospital Medical Magnet High School and Van Nuys High School. Each year, the hospitals also host a Minority Outreach Enrichment day, whereby approximately a dozen directors of non-clinical fields at the hospitals shared their career paths and daily job duties with 35 students, offering mentorship and internships. Additionally, hospital leaders participated in a number of health care career awareness events to increase interest among minority and low-income youth."

However, events after discharge may change the ability of the patient to pay. Designation as Charity Care will only be considered after all payment sources have been exhausted. Hospital charges for patient accounts identified as Charity Care at the time of admission or service are not recognized by the facility as net revenues or net receivables. If patient accounts are identified as Charity Care subsequent to the facility recognizing the charges as revenue, an adjustment is required to classify appropriately the revenue and any bad debt expense previously recorded. PART III, LINE 4: NET PATIENT SERVICE REVENUE IS REPORTED AT ESTIMATED NET REALIZABLE AMOUNTS FROM PATIENTS, THIRD PARTY PAYORS, GOVERNMENT PROGRAMS AND OTHERS IN THE PERIOD IN WHICH SERVICES ARE PROVIDED. THE MAJORITY OF THE HOSPITALS' SERVICES ARE RENDERED TO PATIENTS WITH COMMERCIAL OR MANAGED CARE INSURANCE, OR UNDER THE FEDERAL MEDICARE AND CALIFORNIA STATE MEDICAL PROGRAMS. REIMBURSEMENT FROM THESE VARIOUS PAYORS IS BASED ON A COMBINATION OF PROSPECTIVELY DETERMINED RATES, DISCOUNTS FROM CHARGES AND HISTORICAL COSTS. Amounts received under the Medicare program are subject to retroactive settlements based on review and final determination by program intermediaries or their agents. Provisions for contractual adjustments and retroactive settlements related to thOse payOrs are accrued on an estimated basis in the period the related services are rendered and adjusted in future periods as additional information becomes known or as final settlements are determined. The allowanceS for doubtful accounts ARE based upon management's assessment of historical and expected net collections considering historical business and economic conditions. Periodically throughout the year management assesses the adequacy of the allowance for doubtful accounts based upon historical write-off experience. The results of this review are then used to make any modifications to the allowance for doubtful accounts."

Accordingly, the Hospital must subsidize the cost of care provided to Medicare Beneficiaries with other revenues. THE COSTING METHODOLOGY USED TO CALCULATE MEDICARE ALLOWABLE COSTS OF CARE REPORTED ON PART III, LINE 6 WAS USING A COST-TO-CHARGE RATIO."

201631369349300843,420680448,"Schedule H, Part VI LINES 2, 4 & 5: COMMUNITY BENEFIT NARRATIVE AND NEEDS ASSESSMENT","Working with nearly thirty community-based organizations, Mercy Medical Center - Des Moines joined in an in-depth evaluation of the health of our community. Designed to identify needs and develop improvement strategies, the process engaged thousands of residents and vested leaders in this valuable discussion. Many services provided by Mercy continue to surface are areas of greatest need. Access to a medical home, need for coordinated specialty care and financial assistance for the uninsured and underserved were identified by the participants. These barriers, combined with needed access to healthy food, safe housing and public transportation, have guided the community-based activities for Mercy. Mercy Medical Center - Des Moines is a regional hospital, with a primary service area of three counties and a secondary reach to the surrounding six counties. The population served includes both urban and rural communities, with a growing number of people residing in the 3-county primary service area (Polk, Dallas and Warren.) These residents have a median household income of $61,721, with roughly 8 percent of persons living below the poverty level. Of those who live below the poverty level, 52 percent are single-parent homes with children under 5 years of age. With an increasing immigrant and refugee population relocating to Iowa, approximately 10 percent of our 3-county area speak a language other than English at home. The largest non-native population has Hispanic origin. Another demographic factor impacting Iowa's demand for health care service is our elderly, with 14.9 percent of our residents being over 65 years of age. The uninsured population of our 3-county service area is approximately eight percent. Medicare and Medicaid cover 22 percent of our population. Mercy is one of two large health care systems in our community. In addition, Polk and Dallas Counties each have a county hospital. Mercy Medical Center - Des Moines is an 802-bed acute care, not-for-profit Catholic hospital situated on three campuses. Founded by the Sisters of Mercy in 1893, Mercy is Des Moines' longest continually operating hospital and one of the largest employers in the state, with more than 6,600 employees and a medical staff of more than 950 physicians and allied health professionals. As the first Catholic hospital to serve the community, Mercy embraced the mission of the founding religious congregation, which has since joined with other religious congregations to form Catholic Health Initiatives. The faith-based system operates in 19 states and includes 101 hospitals; long-term care, assisted- and residential-living facilities; two community health services organizations; and home health agencies. Mercy is one of the Midwest's largest referral centers, offering a variety of specialty services that are unique to Iowa and the region. In addition, a 24-hour emergency room is open to all individuals regardless of ability to pay. While a participant in Medicare and Medicaid, Mercy also deploys a robust financial assistance program for the uninsured and underserved, meeting the needs of all seeking care. Dedicated to serving our entire community, Mercy is enriched by a board of directors comprised of civic-minded leaders. Working in conjunction with this esteemed team, Mercy's leadership evaluates and dedicates resources to the promotion of a healthy community and an improvement in the lives of those we serve. One example of Mercy's commitment to unmet needs exists in the House of Mercy. Initially developed to provide safe and supportive housing for vulnerable women and their children, the House of Mercy is now one of Iowa's largest providers of transitional housing and clinical services for parenting women with addiction. The House of Mercy is dedicated to assisting pregnant, parenting/non-parenting, and adolescent/adult women in developing personal responsibility and independence through counseling, education, and medical care in collaboration with other caring individuals."
201631369349300843,420680448,"Schedule H, Part I, Line 3c Eligibility criteria for free or discounted care","When Catholic Health Initiatives (the ultimate parent organization to CHI-Iowa Corp established its financial assistance policy it was determined that establishing a household income scale based on the HUD very low income guidelines more accurately reflects the socioeconomic dispersions among the 69 urban and rural communities in 19 states served by CHI hospitals and health care facilities. In comparing HUD guidelines to the Federal Poverty Guidelines (""FPG""), we find that on average HUD guidelines compute to approximately 200% to 250% (and sometimes 300%) of FPG. CHI-Iowa Corp bases its financial assistance eligibility on HUD's 130% of Very Low Income Guidelines based on geography, and affords the uninsured and underinsured the ability to obtain financial assistance write-offs, based on a sliding scale, ranging from 25%-100% of charges. An individual's income under the HUD guidelines is a significant factor in determining eligibility for financial assistance. However, in determining whether to extend discounted or free care to a patient, the patient's assets may also be taken into consideration. For example, a patient suffering a catastrophic illness may have a reasonable level of income, but a low level of liquid assets such that the payment of medical bills would be seriously detrimental to the patient's basic financial (and ultimately physical) well-being and survival. Such a patient may be extended discounted or free care based upon the facts and circumstances."

The cost-to-charge ratio covers all patient segments. The cost-to-charge ratio for the year ended 6/30/2015 was computed using the following formula: Operating expense (before restructuring, impairment and other losses) divided by gross patient revenue. Based on that formula, $593,986,417/ $2,563,282,154 results in a 23.17% cost-to-charge ratio."

201631369349300843,420680448,"Schedule H, Part III, Line 4 Bad debt expense - financial statement footnote","Catholic Health Initiatives - Iowa Corp does not issue separate company audited financial statements. However, the organization is included in the consolidated financial statements of Catholic Health Initiatives (CHI). The consolidated footnote reads as follows: ""The provision for bad debts is based upon management's assessment of historical and expected net collections, taking into consideration historical business and economic conditions, trends in health care coverage, and other collection indicators. Management routinely assesses the adequacy of the allowance for uncollectible accounts based upon historical write-off experience by payor category. The results of these reviews are used to modify, as necessary, the provision for bad debts and to establish appropriate allowances for uncollectible net patient accounts receivable. After satisfaction of amounts due from insurance, CHI follows established guidelines for placing certain balances with collection agencies, subject to the terms of certain restrictions on collection efforts as determined by each facility. The provision for bad debts is presented on the consolidated statements of operations as a deduction from patient services revenues (net of contractual allowances and discounts) since CHI accepts and treats substantially all patients without regard to the ability to pay."""
201631369349300843,420680448,"Schedule H, Part III, Line 8 Community benefit & methodology for determining medicare costs","Using essentially the same Medicare cost report principles as to the allocation of general services costs and ""apportionment"" methods, the ""CHI Workbook"" calculates a payers' gross allowable costs by service (so as to facilitate a corresponding comparison between gross allowable costs and ultimate payments received). The term ""gross allowable costs"" means costs before any deductibles or co-insurance are subtracted. CHI Iowa Corp's ultimate reimbursement will be reduced by any applicable copayment/ deductible. Where Medicare is the secondary insurer, amounts due from the insured's primary payer were not subtracted from Medicare allowable costs because the amounts are typically immaterial. Although not presented on the Medicare cost report, in order to facilitate a more accurate understanding of the ""true"" cost of services (for ""shortfall"" purposes) the CHI Workbook allows a health care facility not to offset costs that Medicare considers to be non-allowable, but for which the facility can legitimately argue are related to the care of the facility's patients. In addition, although not reportable on the Medicare cost report, the CHI workbook includes the cost of services that are paid via a set fee-schedule rather than being reimbursed based on costs (e.g. outpatient clinical laboratory). Finally, the CHI Workbook allows a facility to include other health care services performed by a separate facility (such as a physician practice) that are maintained on separate books and records (as opposed to the main facility's books and records which has its costs of service included within a cost report). True costs of Medicare computed using this methodology: Total Medicare Revenue: $187,000,000 Total Medicare costs: $193,300,000 Surplus or Shortfall $(6,300,000) CHI Iowa Corp believes that excluding Medicare losses from community benefit makes the overall community benefit report more credible for these reasons: Unlike subsidized areas such as burn units or behavioral-health services, Medicare is not a differentiating feature of tax-exempt health care organizations. In fact, for-profit hospitals focus on attracting patients with Medicare coverage, especially in the case of well-paid services that include cardiac and orthopedics. Significant effort and resources are devoted to ensuring that hospitals are reimbursed appropriately by the Medicare program. The Medicare Payment Advisory Commission (MedPAC), an independent Congressional agency, carefully studies Medicare payment and the access to care that Medicare beneficiaries receive. The commission recommends payment adjustments to Congress accordingly. Though Medicare losses are not included by Catholic hospitals as community benefit, the Catholic Health Association guidelines allow hospitals to count as community benefit some programs that specifically serve the Medicare population. For instance, if hospitals operate programs for patients with Medicare benefits that respond to identified community needs, generate losses for the hospital, and meet other criteria, these programs can be included in the CHA framework in Category C as ""subsidized health services."" Medicare losses are different from Medicaid losses, which are counted in the CHA community benefit framework, because Medicaid reimbursements generally do not receive the level of attention paid to Medicare reimbursement. Medicaid payment is largely driven by what states can afford to pay, and is typically substantially less than what Medicare pays"
201631369349300843,420680448,"Schedule H, Part III, Line 9b Collection practices for patients eligible for financial assistance","Catholic Health Initiatives - Iowa Corp's debt collection policy provides that Catholic Health Initiatives - Iowa Corp will perform a reasonable review of each inpatient account prior to turning an account for to a third-party collection agent and prior to instituting any legal action for non-payment, to assure that the patient and patient guarantor are not eligible for any assistance program (e.g. Medicaid) and do not qualify for coverage through Catholic Health Initiatives - Iowa Corp community assistance policy. After having been turned over to a third-party collection agent, any patient account that is subsequently determined to meet the Catholic Health Initiatives - Iowa Corp community assistance policy is required to be returned immediately by the third-party collection agent to Catholic Health Initiatives - Iowa Corp for appropriate follow-up. Catholic Health Initiatives - Iowa Corp requires its third-party collection agents to include a message on all statements indicating that if a patient or patient guarantor meets certain stipulated income requirements, the patient or patient guarantor may be eligible for financial assistance. All of Catholic Health Initiatives' (CHI) hospitals' contracts with third party collection agencies include the following standards: * Neither CHI hospitals nor their collection agencies will request bench or arrest warrants as a result of non-payment; * Neither CHI hospitals nor their collection agencies will seek liens that would require the sale or foreclosure of a primary residence; and * No Catholic Health Initiatives' collection agency may seek court action without hospital approval. Finally, collection agencies are trained on the Catholic Health Initiatives Mission, Core Values and Standard of Conduct to make sure all patients are treated with dignity and respect."

Upon registration (and once all EMTALA requirements are met), patients who are identified as uninsured (and not covered by Medicare or Medicaid) are provided with a packet of information that addresses the financial assistance policy and procedures including an application for assistance.

An MBO is a direct provider of care or services within a defined market area that may be an integrated health system and/or a stand-alone hospital or other facility or service provider. CHI serves as the parent corporation of its MBOs which are comprised of 101 hospitals, including four academic medical centers, and 30 critical access facilities; community health service organizations; accredited nursing colleges; home health agencies; and other facilities that span the inpatient and outpatient continuum of care. Together, these facilities provided $981 million in charity care and community benefit in the 2015 fiscal year, including services for the poor, free clinics, education and research. CHI provides strategic planning and management services as well as centralized ""shared services"" for the MBOs. The provision of centralized management and shared services - including areas such as accounting, human resources, payroll and supply chain -- provides economies of scale and purchasing power to the MBOs. The cost savings achieved through CHI's centralization enable MBOs to dedicate additional resources to high-quality health care and community outreach services to the most vulnerable members of our society.

LAWS, REGULATIONS, CATASTROPHIC ILLNESSES AND THE RISING COSTS OF NEW TECHNOLOGY HAVE CREATED A CATEGORY OF PATIENTS WHO ARE EITHER UNINSURED OR UNDERINSURED. THIS CHARITY CARE PROGRAM HAS BEEN DEVELOPED TO HELP THE HOSPITAL MEET THE NEEDS OF THESE PATIENTS AND, CONCURRENTLY, MAINTAIN THE FINANCIAL VIABILITY OF THE HOSPITAL FOR FUTURE GENERATIONS. THIS CHARITY CARE POLICY EXPLAINS HOW THE HOSPITAL ASSISTS PATIENTS WHO CANNOT PAY FOR PART OR ALL OF THE ESSENTIAL MEDICAL CARE THEY RECEIVE. PRINCIPLES: STRONG MEMORIAL HOSPITAL PROACTIVELY CONVEYS INFORMATION ABOUT THIS CHARITY CARE POLICY TO PATIENTS AND THEIR FAMILIES. - WE BELIEVE THAT FEAR OF A HOSPITAL BILL SHOULD NEVER GET IN THE WAY OF ESSENTIAL HEALTH SERVICES. THE PROVISION OF URGENT OR EMERGENT HEALTHCARE IS NEVER DELAYED PENDING A FINANCIAL ASSISTANCE DETERMINATION. SIGNS ANNOUNCING THE CHARITY CARE PROGRAM ARE POSTED IN THE HOSPITAL (E.G. EMERGENCY DEPARTMENT, ADMITTING OFFICE) TO PROACTIVELY CONVEY THIS MESSAGE TO PROSPECTIVE PATIENTS AND THE PUBLIC IN GENERAL. - WE MAINTAIN FINANCIAL AID POLICIES THAT ARE CONSISTENT WITH THE MISSION, VALUES AND CAPACITY OF THE HOSPITAL AND THAT TAKE INTO ACCOUNT EACH INDIVIDUAL'S ABILITY TO CONTRIBUTE TO THE COST OF HIS OR HER CARE. - WE COMMUNICATE THE AVAILABILITY OF FINANCIAL AID IN A MANNER THAT IS CLEAR, UNDERSTANDABLE, SENSITIVE TO THE PATIENT'S DIGNITY, AND IN MULTIPLE LANGUAGES. A NOTICE IS AVAILABLE AT REGISTRATION SITES THAT INFORMS PATIENTS OF THIS PROGRAM AND PROVIDES THE PHONE NUMBER TO CALL TO OBTAIN MORE INFORMATION AND TO APPLY FOR THIS PROGRAM. DESIGNATED STAFF ARE PROVIDED DETAILED TRAINING SO THAT THEY CAN PROVIDE INFORMATION AND ANSWER QUESTIONS ABOUT THE CHARITY CARE PROGRAM.

PATIENTS ARE ASSISTED IN MAKING APPLICATIONS FOR ANY OF THESE INSURANCES OR DISCOUNTED FEE PLANS. PATIENTS ARE EXPECTED TO PARTICIPATE FULLY IN ALL EFFORTS TO OBTAIN ANY INSURANCE FOR WHICH THEY MAY QUALIFY. UNDER CERTAIN CIRCUMSTANCES, AS DETERMINED BY THE FINANCIAL CASE MANAGERS OR OTHER HOSPITAL SENIOR ADMINISTRATORS. APPLICATIONS FOR MEDICAID, MEDICARE OR OTHER INSURANCE PROGRAMS MAY BE WAIVED WHEN DEEMED UNNECESSARY. IF AVAILABLE INSURANCE BENEFITS ARE NOT SUFFICIENT TO COVER THE COST OF THEIR CARE, PATIENTS MAY THEN APPLY FOR ASSISTANCE FROM THE CHARITY CARE PROGRAM. CHARITY CARE APPLICATIONS MUST BE COMPLETED AND RETURNED TO THE HOSPITAL WITH THE REQUESTED INCOME DOCUMENTATION. PATIENTS WILL NOT RECEIVE CHARITY CARE ASSISTANCE IF THEY (A) DO NOT COMPLETE THE APPLICATION PROCESS FOR MEDICAID OR OTHER INSURANCE FOR WHICH THEY MAY QUALIFY, (B) ELECT NOT TO MAKE APPLICATION FOR CHARITY CARE, OR (C) HAVE ADEQUATE RESOURCES OR INCOME TO PAY PRIVATELY FOR THEIR CARE. IN THESE SITUATIONS, THEY WILL REMAIN FINANCIALLY RESPONSIBLE FOR FULL PAYMENT OF THEIR HOSPITAL BILLS.

FINANCIAL GUIDELINES: FINANCIAL AID IS INTENDED TO ASSIST THOSE INDIVIDUALS WHO CANNOT AFFORD TO PAY IN PART OR IN FULL FOR THEIR CARE. IT SHOULD TAKE INTO ACCOUNT EACH INDIVIDUAL'S ABILITY TO CONTRIBUTE TO THE COST OF HIS OR HER CARE. HOSPITAL FINANCIAL AID SHOULD NOT BE VIEWED AS A SUBSTITUTE FOR EMPLOYER-SPONSORED OR INDIVIDUALLY PURCHASED INSURANCE. PATIENTS WITHOUT INSURANCE AND WITH INCOME THAT WOULD QUALIFY THEM FOR THE CHARITY CARE PROGRAM BUT ALSO HAVE SUBSTANTIAL RESOURCES (OTHER THAN TAX-DEFERRED OR COMPARABLE RETIREMENT SAVINGS OR COLLEGE SAVINGS ACCOUNTS) MAY BE EXPECTED TO PAY PART OF THEIR BILLS(S).

THE FINANCIAL GUIDELINES WILL BE UPDATED ANNUALLY IN CONJUNCTION WITH THE FEDERAL POVERTY UPDATES PUBLISHED BY CMS. PATIENTS MAY RECEIVE FULL OR PARTIAL DISCOUNT FROM THE COST OF CARE, DEPENDING ON THE PERCENTAGE OF THE GUIDELINES MATCHED BY THE PATIENT'S HOUSEHOLD INCOME. ANY BILL AMOUNT REMAINING AFTER APPLICATION OF A PARTIAL CHARITY CARE DISCOUNT IS THE RESPONSIBILITY OF THE PATIENT. THE AMOUNT AN APPROVED CHARITY CARE PATIENT WILL GENERALLY BE EXPECTED TO PAY FOR SERVICES COVERED BY THE POLICY WILL BE LIMITED TO THE LOWER OF THE AMOUNT THAT THE HOSPITAL WOULD HAVE RECEIVED FOR THE SAME SERVICE UNDER MEDICARE PARTS A AND B, (INCLUDING COINSURANCE, CO-PAYMENTS AND DEDUCTIBLES) OR THE USUAL AND CUSTOMARY CHARGES.

THE THIRTY-SEVEN MEMBER CAC REPRESENTS EIGHTEEN COMMUNITY-BASED ORGANIZATIONS, INCLUDING HEALTH AND SOCIAL SERVICE AGENCIES, THE FAITH COMMUNITY, LOCAL GOVERNMENT, THE CITY SCHOOL DISTRICT AND MEDIA. A PRIMARY FUNCTION OF THE CAC IS TO STRENGTHEN URMC-COMMUNITY PARTNERSHIPS WITH A MUTUAL GOAL TO REDUCE INEQUALITIES AND IMPROVE ACCESS TO HEALTH CARE AND SERVICES. TO HIGHLIGHT THE IMPORTANCE OF THE COMMUNITY HEALTH MISSION, THE ANNUAL ""DR. DAVID SATCHER COMMUNITY HEALTH IMPROVEMENT AWARDS"" PROGRAM WAS ESTABLISHED IN 2010 TO RECOGNIZE URMC FACULTY/STAFF AND THEIR COMMUNITY PARTNERS FOR EXEMPLARY COMMUNITY ENGAGED WORK WHICH CONTRIBUTES TO REDUCING HEALTH INEQUALITIES AND IMPROVES THE COMMUNITY'S HEALTH THROUGH RESEARCH, EDUCATION, AND SERVICE.

Rush utilizes data received from a third party vendor that is filed with the major credit bureaus to determine whether the patient's income meets the income threshold. Charges for services rendered to patients meeting this threshold are written off in full prior to a bill being sent to the patient. A patient may also be eligible for presumptive charity care if the patient is eligible for Medicaid for other dates of service or services deemed non-covered by Medicaid; the patient is enrolled in, or eligible for, an assistance program for low income individuals; or the patient is homeless, deceased with no estate, or mentally incapacitated with no one to act on the patient's behalf. All uninsured patients not meeting the requirements of presumptive charity care are automatically granted an uninsured patient discount ranging from 68% to 33%, based on income level. The uninsured patient discount is an Illinois state mandated discount based on Rush's cost to charge ratio which is updated annually. Patients may complete an application to determine eligibility under Rush's Charity Care and Limited Income Programs, one of the programs included in the Financial Assistance Policy. Both programs are income-based and utilize an asset test to determine eligibility. Patients meeting the asset test whose income is 201-300% of FPG qualify for 100% discount to their hospital bill; patients meeting the asset test whose income is 301-400% FPG qualify for a 75% discount to their hospital bill.

Services for veterans deployed in Iraq and Afghanistan include: an adult mental health clinic that specializes in post-traumatic stress disorder; child and family services such as support groups, counseling and guidance for parenting; traumatic brain injury clinic; and a military sexual trauma clinic. This past year the Road Home program provided services to over 500 veterans.Rush has a 30-year history of providing health care at School-Based Health Centers (SBHC). Rush currently has three SBHCs located within Chicago Public Schools that include, Orr Academy, R.T. Crane Medical Preparatory High School and Simpson Academy for Young Women. Crane and Orr have students in grades nine to 12 and Simpson Academy is for girls in grades six to 12 that are pregnant, parenting or both. All three schools, have student bodies from underserved populations, and are located in neighborhoods with high poverty levels.The Rush SBHCs act as health safety nets for these vulnerable students. Wide-ranging clinic services are provided by advanced practice nurses, registered nurses, collaborating physicians and large numbers of Rush's inter-professional students. The services include physicals, immunizations, treatment of injuries, primary care, intermittent care, mental health services, prenatal care, pregnancy prevention programs, heath education programs and health care for the children of the students. Outcomes of this health care and education collaboration include improved immunization rates, decreased incidence of infectious disease, decreased emergency room usage, detecting and treating illness, healthy baby deliveries, increased access to mental health services, success in pregnancy prevention programs, and students establishing healthy living patterns aimed at chronic disease prevention and improved graduation rates. In FY2015, these health centers provided close to 3,500 healthcare encounters.RUMC provided health education community-based programs at no cost to approximately 32,000 individuals this past year. All of Rush's health education programs address one of more of the needs identified in Rush's CHNA. Examples of these programs include:The RCSIP Wellness Center at Facing Forward is part of RUMC's Building Healthy Urban Communities project. Facing Forward provides permanent housing to homeless women and children in Chicago. Many of the women at Facing Forward have chronic physical and mental health conditions; 100% of the population is recovering from substance abuse issues.The Wellness Center sessions provides routine health screenings, weight checks, health-life coach sessions, health education groups, healthy cooking demonstrations and an exercise group. In addition, a walking group and knitting group have been formed as adjunct programs for the Center. Rush volunteer students receive specialized training to act as health/life coaches and to run the program alongside Rush faculty. Outcomes show 93 percent of the Wellness Center participants have adapted healthier eating habits, 93 percent have either started or increased exercising, 53 percent lost weight with a mean weight loss of 8 pounds, 57 percent of the participants that smoke have reduced the amount they smoke and 36 percent are actively working on smoking cessation. Knitting group participants report that this activity has helped them with stress management and smoking reduction. Outcomes for Rush volunteer students include, 100 percent report they have a better understanding of healthcare challenges for the underserved; 100 percent report a greater awareness of their personal role in supporting healthcare in the community; 100 percent report a better understanding of how interdisciplinary teams work toward common goals; 98 percent report improved communication skills with individuals of diverse backgrounds; and 100 percent report an enhanced ability to perform community healthcare skills.Rush's Professional Nursing Staff's (PNS) organization provides Mini Health Fairs for patients receiving care at Thresholds, an organization that provides services to individuals with chronic mental illness. The Mini Health Fairs provide health education and screenings. This is important since those with chronic mental illness have a lifespan that is 25 years less than the general population related to chronic medical diseases. In FY2015, 90 patients received services through the Health Fairs.5 + 1= 20, a RCSIP program, aims to educate high school students at Chicago Public Schools on the five diseases prevalent in the surrounding underserved community (asthma, hypertension, HIV, diabetes, and cancer). 5 + 1 =20 is based on the idea that knowledge of these 5 common conditions plus 1 informed high school student (or person) can extend one's life by 20 years (individuals without health insurance have a life expectancy of 20 years less than the general US population). Twice a month, Rush student volunteers teach a health topic related to the five diseases to high school students. The content of the interactive health lectures ranges from disease prevention to practical skills such checking blood pressure. The high school students have opportunities to spread their knowledge through 5+1=20 health fairs at their schools. Health fair activities include BMI calculations, blood pressure screenings, vision screenings, glucose level checks, referrals, and health education. Health fair participants include families and friends of the students as well as other members of their communities. This past year, 5 + 1 = 20 provided health education and screenings to over 300 community members.The RUMC Wellness Program with the Chicago Department of Family and Support Services primarily serves minority older adults and has been in existence since 1985. Advanced practice nurses, dietitians, pharmacists, and social workers provided by RUMC provide health education and healthcare for older adults at five Chicago senior centers. During FY2015, RUMC healthcare professionals provided 16,010 free service encounters for low-income older adults which included health consultations, screenings such as blood pressure, bone density, cholesterol, diabetes, and PSA levels and health talks on topics such as weight loss and fall prevention. The majority of the Rush health professionals' time, as well as all travel expenses and travel time, supplies and educational materials were donated to this program by Rush.The Anne Byron Waud Center at RUMC offers an array of programs and services open to the public that promote healthy aging. Patients, their families and the community have the opportunity to receive free consultations from licensed social workers on health and aging issues, attend social and support groups, participate in free computer training, and use the health library. The Center provides a place to turn in times of need."

For the purposes of this plan, the federally required Community Health Needs Assessment and future planning initiatives, RUMC's defined service area consists of communities surrounding the hospital identified through a patient origin zip code analysis. The RUMC service area is comprised of seven zip codes which include the Chicago community areas of Near West Side, Lower West Side, West Town, East Garfield Park, West Garfield Park, North Lawndale, and South Lawndale. This is an area of high poverty levels, high crime rates and great health disparities. These geographical areas encompass the location of the medical center as well as the locations of sites for a significant number of community outreach efforts, such as health access programs, wellness centers and healthcare pipeline and workforce development programs.Chicago, like any large urban city, surveys the health services it provides to its citizens. The Chicago Department of Public Health (CDPH) established a strategic planning process aimed to focus the energies of the department, set organizational priorities and guide the allocation of public health resources.Many of RUMC's community benefits activities align with CDPH's strategic priorities such as health promotion and prevention of chronic disease, promoting access to services, and ensuring Chicago is prepared to quickly and effectively respond to public health emergencies and epidemics. To further our efforts to identify and address the existing health needs within our community, RUMC developed its first Community Health Needs Assessment (CHNA) and corresponding Community Health Implementation Plan (CHIP) as required by the Internal Revenue Service in compliance with the Affordable Care Act. The CHNA and implementation plan were completed during fiscal year 2013 and board approved by June 2013. A copy of the CHNA is available online. The CHIP is closely monitored on an ongoing basis through outcome indicators and continuous data collection."
201621379349302182,362174823,"Part VI, Line 3:","In keeping with RUMC's mission to provide comprehensive, coordinated health care services to our patients, RUMC offers several financial assistance programs to help patients with their hospital bill.RUMC uses a patient eligibility service to proactively enroll patients, who present for service without insurance coverage, for coverage under various state and federal programs. The maintenance of this service for our patients has a significant impact on decreasing the amount of financial assistance provided because patients who otherwise have qualified for financial assistance are obtaining insurance coverage for their care. In addition to achieving appropriate, available coverage for our patients' medical services, this eligibility service also obtains eligibility for SSI or SSA benefits for applicable patients. Guiding the patient through this often time-consuming and arduous process is extremely beneficial to the patient, as once SSI/SSA eligibility is approved, the patient will begin receiving a monthly assistance check which provided a benefit well beyond their health care at RUMC.To assist the patient in deciding which is the right program for them, RUMC offers the services of Financial Counselors and Billing Customer Service Representatives. These individuals will assist patients with completing financial application forms, obtaining an estimated cost of anticipated hospital services, providing an explanation and copy of their hospital bill, and obtaining notary services. RUMC makes all financial assistance information and policies available on its website.In order to widely publicize the document, Rush makes the financial assistance information available in a number of formats. Rush provides a plain language summary in the Emergency Department as well as the main Registration areas. The plain language summary explains the different types of charity care. In addition, all uninusured patients are provided a financial assistance application when being discharged from the Emergency Department. At our registration sites, it is our policy to have all uninsured patients informed of our financial assistance policy, and we recommend that they speak with a financial counselor. In addition, the policy, application, and plain language summary are available on-line for patients and guarantors to view."
201621379349302182,362174823,"Part VI, Line 4:","RUMC provides patient care services to a much broader audience than is defined in its CHNA. RUMC purposely chose to define its community for the CHNA as the geographic area around RUMC since this is an area of great need. Rush's patient population is varied in regard to ethnicity, economic status and insured status. Rush's defined community for its CHNA is primarily African American, with populations living at or below poverty level, with lower high school graduation rates than Illinois benchmarks and with higher rates of chronic disease than the U. S. general population."
201621379349302182,362174823,"Part VI, Line 5:","RUMC has provided high quality services to underserved populations for many years through ongoing successful community-based programs and partnerships. Examples include opening the Rush Adolescent Family (AFC) center 41 years ago to provide reproductive health care, prenatal care and pregnancy prevention services to underserved adolescents. Over 25 years ago, Rush opened two school health centers at Chicago Public Schools (CPS) to provide safety-net care to vulnerable adolescents living in high poverty communities. These health centers continue to thrive and Rush has added a third school health center at a school for pregnant and/or parenting girls in sixth through twelfth grade. The Science and Math Excellence (SAME) network was started 25 years ago to narrow the gap in math and science test scores between schools on the South and West sides of Chicago and schools in more affluent neighborhoods. Another example of Rush's commitment is the development of Rush Community Service Initiative Program (RCSIP) 23 years ago. This all volunteer program was developed to meet the health needs of Chicago's West side residents.RUMC is a founding member of the Medical Home Network. The Medical Home Network (MHN) is a Section 501(c)3 organization founded by the Comer Science and Education Foundation to address problems accessing health care in populations with Medicaid living on Chicago's South and Southwest sides. MHN partners collaborate to transform the current care delivery system to improve patient care coordination and access to health care services, while reducing cost and fragmentation. The MHN consists of safety net hospitals, one tertiary care hospital (Rush) and several Federally Qualified Health Centers. RUMC takes a leadership role in the MHN through RUMC's CEO serving as co-chairman, providing the Better Care Teams education program to MHN clinicians and more recently by providing complex care coordination for the most at-risk MHN patients.RUMC and the Cook County Health and Hospitals System collaborated to create the Ruth M. Rothstein CORE Center in 1998. The CORE Center is the nation's first public-private outpatient facility dedicated to the care of people with HIV/AIDS. Today, it is the largest, most comprehensive provider of HIV/AIDS treatment in the Midwest. Faculty members from Rush and Stroger Hospital work side-by-side delivering care to this population. The Center also serves patients with tuberculosis, hepatitis and other infectious diseases. Clinical research projects at the center seek new answers in screening, treating and halting the spread of infectious diseases.RUMC is also a founding and active member of the Illinois Medical District Hospital Emergency Preparedness Coalition (IMD HEPC). The mission of this coalition is to create and maintain a community wide emergency management interoperability within one of the nation's largest urban healthcare, educational, research and technology districts resulting in minimal loss of life and reduced collateral damage to surrounding structures and the environment during a disaster.This past year, RUMC provided over 18,000 clinic visits to the most at-risk underserved populations through numerous community based programs and partnerships at no charge to the patients. Examples of some of these services are detailed below.Rush Community Service Initiative Program (RCSIP) Clinics are run by RUMC physicians and Rush student volunteers. The clinics offer physical exams, health education, free basic medications, procedures such as wound care and use referrals to help patients establish primary and/or specialty care relationships that are affordable or available through charity care. Examples of these clinics include: (1). The RCSIP Clinic at Franciscan House is located within the Franciscan House homeless shelter for adult men and women. Approximately 100 patients are seen weekly; over 2,000 healthcare encounters were provided during FY 2015. (2). The RCSIP Clinic at Freedom Center serves adult males that are in rehabilitation for substance abuse issues. The clinic is housed within the Salvation Army's Harbor Light Center and provided healthcare to approximately 200 men during FY 2015. (3). The RCSIP Clinic at Chicago City Church serves homeless and other at-risk adults. Over 100 patients were seen at this clinic during FY 2015.The Department of Pediatrics has several long-standing programs for underserved children. Examples of these programs include, since its inception in 1997, Rush's Kids-SHIP initiative has provided healthcare services to homeless children and adolescents through a medical outreach team. The team also provides any necessary follow-up care at the Pediatric Primary Care Center at Rush. The Chicago Coalition for the Homeless estimates that approximately 26,000 youth experience homelessness in Illinois over the course of a year. The majority of these children and adolescents have no primary care physician and no medical home. Many of these children do not receive routine childhood immunizations and, because of the irregularity of their medical care, have no record of their medical history. Due to their desperate need for comprehensive healthcare tailored to their physical, emotional and logistical needs, these underserved pediatric populations are the focus of Rush's Kids-Shelter Health Improvement Project (Kids-SHIP). The Kids-SHIP medical outreach team is made up of an attending pediatrician from Rush, pediatric residents from Rush Medical College and Stroger Hospital, and medical students from Rush who travel to nine homeless shelters on the West and South Sides of Chicago to provide on-site medical services to children and adolescents. In FY2015, the Kids-SHIP physicians completed approximately 540 patient visits. By initiating contact with homeless children and providing onsite medical care, this program has reduced barriers to care and improved the overall health status of this homeless population. Additionally, Kids-SHIP has encouraged the use of available healthcare resources, including provision of a medical home at Rush, among homeless families.Rush provides Pediatric Subspecialty physician services at or below cost to Stroger Hospital in order to provide advanced, high-quality, subspecialty medical care to the patients there through the Rush-Stroger Affiliation Agreement-Pediatrics Program. The Pediatric subspecialty medical services include: Pediatric Allergy/Immunology; Pediatric Critical Care; Pediatric Endocrinology; Pediatric Gastroenterology; Pediatric Infectious Disease; Pediatric Neurology; Pediatric Nephrology; and Pediatric Pulmonary Medicine. The Rush Section of Pediatric Critical Care provides the majority of physician coverage for the Stroger Pediatric ICU. The Department of Pediatrics at Rush volunteers with the Chicago Department of Public Health (CDPH) to provide care for complex tuberculosis patients at West Town Neighborhood Health Centers for half days every other week. The Pediatric Infectious Disease Faculty Outreach program provides access to specialized medical expertise for immigrant, minority, and underserved populations with tuberculosis. For almost two decades, the Department of Pediatrics has provided medical supervision for children with HIV at Children's Place, a Chicago residence and day care center for children infected with or affected by HIV. Pediatric Infectious Disease subspecialists from Rush provide HIV evaluations and care for children with HIV who are adopted from foreign countries through dedicated adoption agencies such as Adoption-Link. During FY2015, approximately 500 individuals received services through this outreach program.In addition to RCSIP and the Pediatric Department, other community based programs are sponsored by Rush for at-risk individuals. Examples of these include:The RUMC AFC provides reproductive healthcare, prenatal care, gynecological care, pregnancy prevention programs, STD testing and treatment, and community health education to underserved Chicago area youth. All of the AF''s services are provided regardless of income or ability to pay for care. Although the AFC draws patients from over 107 Chicago area zip codes, the majority of patients served reside in Chicago Westside communities of high poverty. As part of the AFC's community education program, staff regularly travels off-site to Chicago area high schools and middle schools to provide community education on pregnancy prevention, reproductive anatomy, contraception, sexually transmitted infection prevention and reproductive health. AFC also offers free prenatal education classes to pregnant teens and their partners. The year, the AFC provided clinic services to 800 youth and several thousand community education encounters."

201621379349302182,362174823,"Part VI, Line 4","The Waud Center and the services it provides have also been the inspiration and driving force behind the development of older adult programming throughout the Medical Center. One such program is Rush Generations, a free membership program that promotes health and well-being for older adults and those who care for them. Through monthly educational seminars on a wide range of topics related to health and aging, Rush Generations has reached out to over 7,000 members and growing. Educational programs and wellness classes offered include:A Matter of Balance is an evidence-based program that emphasizes practical strategies to reduce the fear of falling, manage falls and increase physical activity levels. (1). Connected Living is designed to impart basic computer skills for older adults. (2). Diabetes Self-Management Program is a free, interactive, six-week workshop that helps those with type 2 diabetes to improve skills to manage their health. Participants learn about the importance of healthy eating, physical activity, stress management and medications among other self-management strategies. Workshops take place at Rush and in community settings. (3). The Rush Generations program plans a robust, year-round calendar of classes, workshops and health screenings that enhance physical and emotional wellbeing of adults and older adults. Each month, Rush Generations offers a lecture on a different health topic including Stroke Awareness, Understanding Medicare, Prostate Health and more. (4). The Health Promotion Disease Prevention team present to local senior groups as well as groups of health and social service professionals and students about their work and expertise in the areas of health, aging and social work. Several members of the team are Master Trainers for three evidence-based health promotion programs, and in this role, train facilitators of these workshops. The team also provides training to the Senior Companions program through the Chicago Department of Family and Support Services, Senior Services Division. (5). The RUMC Mothers' Milk Club was developed to address the social, emotional, demographic and physiologic barriers to mothers' providing their milk for their infants in the Neonatal Intensive Care Unit. These mothers are disproportionately low-income and African American, the two demographic groups that are least likely to initiate and maintain lactation in the United States. The Club provides these women with the necessary guidance and resources that they need to provide milk for their infants, including: state-of-the-art hospital-grade electric breast pumps, taxi service to attend weekly educational luncheon meetings, educational materials, and post-infant discharge home visits to help breastfeeding get off to a good start. These services are provided on a complimentary or sliding-scale basis to all families who qualify for Women Infants & Children (WIC) benefits.Rush invests in developing and supporting healthcare pipeline and workforce development programs during FY2015. These programs consist of the RCISP pipeline program for the R. T. Crane (RTC) Medical Preparatory High School, Malcolm X City College (MXC) partnership, tuition forgiveness programs, the RCSIP Mini Medical School for CPS students living in the Lawndale neighborhood, the Building Health Urban Communities project, and the SAME network. Descriptions of these programs follow.RTC Medical Preparatory High School is part of the Chicago Public Schools (CPS) Career and Technical Education (CTE) Program. The CPS CTE Program was established by the Cook County President's and the City of Chicago Mayor's offices to increase the number of Chicago's youth recruited into Chicago's healthcare workforce. Rush is a part of the CPS CTE program and partners with RTC Medical Preparatory High School. RUMC faculty and staff provide mentorship and activities to facilitate the Crane students' efforts to successfully pursue their interest in health careers. CPS CTE activities are focused on awareness, exploration, and application of the health sciences. In addition to mentorship and educational services to all students at Crane (student capacity of 1,330), over 30 freshman students had paid internships in the nursing department at RUMC this past year.Malcolm X City College (MXC) and RUMC have a rich, multi-year history of interactions and cooperative activities. These include hosting health occupation students' clinical rotations in nursing, surgical technology, radiologic technology, EMT/paramedic, and respiratory care at RUMC and providing anatomy labs for MXC health occupations students. RUMC also provides guest lecturers and recently began offering a monthly inter-professional lunch and learn series for MXC students and faculty on issues and trends related to health care.Recently, the City Colleges of Chicago identified MXC as the leading city college for health careers and Rush as a lead partner for its health career programs. MXC wants to ensure that its graduates have the knowledge, skills and professional attributes they will need to function in the healthcare system, both now and in the future. To help achieve that goal, Rush participates in MXC advisory committees and provides transfer programs for graduates of the MXC radiologic technology and respiratory care programs to allow students the opportunity to obtain a bachelor's degree in their fields.To further develop upper division college transfer opportunities for MXC graduates, Rush is working with representatives of MXC to develop an innovative new Bachelor of Science in health sciences. A program development steering committee consisting of representatives from MXC and the four Rush colleges (College of Medicine, College of Nursing, College of Health Sciences and Graduate College) has recommended the development of the following Bachelor of Science degree options or tracks: (1). Undergraduate preparation for graduate level health science programs in allied health, medicine, nursing and the biomedical sciences. (2). Leadership program for students holding the associate degree in a health occupation. (3). Health-wellness focus for students interested in a career related to corporate health, community health or medical home care coordination.Rush subsidizes the education and training many students that will comprise the next generation of doctors, nurses, allied health care professionals and healthcare research scientist whose tuition and grants do not fully cover the associated costs through select tuition forgiveness programs. Rush is committed to providing programs to educate and train the healthcare workforce of the future. It is widely recognized that workforce demands in healthcare will rapidly escalate as the U.S. population ages. During FY2015, RUMC provided tuition forgiveness for several students coming to Rush from Malcolm X City College and to other students pursuing health science research degrees. It is an essential part of RUMC's corporate mission that education programs continue to receive this operational support in order to supply highly trained physicians, nurses, allied health professionals and research scientist to the healthcare community.The Mini Medical School is a five-week summer day camp for 40 grade school students (4th-6th) from Chicago Public Schools in the Lawndale neighborhood. The program exposes young students to the health sciences. The summer camp is held at Rush University and is complete with an orientation, anatomy and physiology lectures, activities on five major body systems, dissections, homework, and a completion celebration. Rush student and physician volunteers plan the curriculum, implement activities, and assist the youth during the camp.The Building Health Urban Communities project fosters public-private partnership between Rush Malcolm X City College (MXC), and the Medical Home Network (MHN). The goals of this project are to improve education, employment and health outcomes of the underserved Westside and Southside communities of Chicago served by Rush. This is being achieved through creating new models of care that focus on interprofessional teams and proactive care coordination, developing and training a workforce from the community that supports these new models of care, and rigorously measuring and evaluating each project component for sustainability and replication."
201621379349302182,362174823,"Part VI, Line 4","One of the major focuses of this project is developing and training a workforce to deliver high value population-based health care. Embedding training opportunities within existing models of care will improve quality, efficiency, and reduce costs. There are five components of workforce development that include the Rush Community Investments Initiative, and Curriculum Development for Allied Health Professionals, Scholarships and Internships for Rush Bachelor of Science in Health Sciences, Continuing Education Training for existing healthcare providers, and Health Disparities Research and Evaluation Fellowships. These components target different types and levels of healthcare workforce thus creating a pipeline of educational programs. The program components are listed below.Health Disparities Fellowships: The Health Disparities Fellowship program is designed to develop a cadre of well-trained health care researchers with a passion for creating sustainable ways for providing access to high-quality care for individuals in underserved communities, with a particular focus on improving health in the communities served by Rush. These mentored fellowships involve development and evaluation of new ways to educate and deploy community-based providers, and evaluation of the new models of care in which they will be working. Fellowships span over a five-year period, and currently five fellows and one health disparity scholar are working on projects in various specialties including Allied Health Sciences, Preventive Medicine, Nursing, and Curriculum Development, with a timeframe ranging from two-three years. Fellows with a Master's degree are encouraged to enroll in the PhD program and take advantage of the educational benefits offered by Rush.Curriculum Development for Allied Health Professionals: Fellows are working on developing new curriculum streams for educating and training allied health professionals to meet the current and future workforce needs. The initial focus is on developing a curriculum for community health workers which is competency and assessment based. The goal is to allow students graduating from these programs to enroll and transfer credits to a bachelors program, thus creating career ladders for these students. The community health worker basic certificate program has already been launched at MXC as a result of this work.Scholarships and Internships for Rush Bachelor of Science in Health Sciences: In an attempt to create career ladders for individuals from low-income underserved communities, a ""pipeline program"" is funded through this project. Individuals from the Malcolm X City College can enroll and transfer credits to the Rush Bachelor of Science in Health Sciences program. These students will be offered scholarships and part-time paid internships for two years. Internships will allow them to gain both academic and clinical hands-on experience before graduation.Rush Community Investments Initiative: A one-year student led pilot program for community benefits has been initiated by developing a Rush Wellness Center at Facing Forward. Facing Forward is a housing first facility located on the west side of Chicago that provides permanent housing for homeless individuals with a history of substance abuse. This pilot is designed to decrease cardiovascular risk and improve respiratory health for the residents and enhance students' ability to provide need based care to underserved populations, work in teams, develop long-term patient relationships, and care for diverse populations. This will serve as a model for future student-led wellness initiatives that can have a long term impact on participants.Continuing Education Training: Better Care Teams training is based on an in-depth needs assessment on the needs of existing care coordinators, outreach workers, and clinicians within the Medical Home Network clinics, to prepare them for future healthcare needs. The primary focus of this training is high value team-based care. Motivational Interview training has been launched with other training topic areas to follow in the next year.The Science and Math Excellence (SAME) Network was developed in 1990 and is a large-scale community service enterprise operated through the Department of Community Affairs at Rush to improve the science, math, and reading test scores in Chicago schools on the West and Southwest sides of the city. The Network provides students in these neighborhoods with the same opportunities to learn math and science as are available to their peers in more affluent areas. RUMC spearheaded the SAME Network's first effort long perform others recognized the importance of STEM (science, technology, engineering, and math) programs to improve education by raising funds from Chicago's business community to build state-of-the-art science laboratories in local schools that lacked these facilities. Since then, the SAME Network has grown to become a collaboration between Rush and 34 elementary schools, 11 high schools and many local businesses. Rush's dedication to promoting a healthy community has fostered a strong commitment to supporting the growth and development of our local neighborhoods. Rush conducts a variety of programs through the SAME Network that include the programs below.College Internship Program: The College Internship Program supports SAME students as they matriculate through college. Eligible students receive scholarship assistance and academic support. The students are given an opportunity to work at Rush University Medical Center in an area closely related to their career choice. The students return from colleges and universities across the United States during the holiday season and summer break to learn, work and interact with patients, peers, and management. College students receive mentoring through preceptor relationships with professionals at Rush University Medical Center. During FY2015, 21 college students benefited from this program.College Preparatory Enrichment Program (CPEP): SAME Network collaborated on an enrichment program with Chicago Public Schools and Benedictine University in Lisle, Illinois. The CPEP offers students an opportunity to participate in year-round after-school and summer learning activities. The intent of the CPEP is to provide students with the experiences they need to pique their interest in science and math, pursue college entrance and, potentially, a science-related career. Students who participate in the CPEP have the opportunity to become involved with the SAME Network's High School Internship Program when they graduate from elementary school. The program is geared toward students entering fifth grade that also attend a SAME Network school. The students are recommended by their school principals and teachers because they show academic promise in the areas of science and math. During the summer, students are exposed to one or two week campus living at Benedictine University, which provides them with the experience of living away from home. Coupled with campus life, the students receive instruction in math, science, and technology. Field trips to educational institutions in the western suburbs and fun outings are a part of the experience. Students work independently, collaboratively, and cooperatively on inquiry-based science tasks emphasizing high-order thinking skills while integrating math and technology. Families participate in a variety of activities throughout the year. In FY2015, 438 students participated in this program."
201621379349302182,362174823,"Part VI, Line 4","High School Internship Program: In conjunction with Chicago Public Schools through the SAME Network, the program provides a variety of internship experiences to high school students. The objectives of SAME's internship program are to encourage students to pursue education and careers in math, science, and technology fields, provide students with hands-on experience, classes and mentoring; and develop good work habits, ethics and job readiness skills. A mentoring relationship was developed between the internship students and Rush's Health Systems Management faculty and staff. After graduating from high school, students are eligible to transition into the College Internship Program. Throughout high school, the students work at Rush University Medical Center in various departments.Preschool Program: In 1998, SAME Network developed this program to introduce preschool children to science, math, and literacy skills. The program currently operates in 28 public and private schools. The goal of the SAME Preschool Program is to provide a stimulating environment for guiding children in the development of science, math, and literacy skills by providing science labs and materials appropriate for young children. Children begin to understand fundamental science concepts and develop inquiry skills by using their natural curiosity to motivate exploration of their surroundings. The ultimate objective of the science program is to have the preschool children achieve science literacy, which is necessary for them to succeed in a world filled with science. SAME Network offers workshops to parents of children participating in SAME Network sponsored preschool program. SAME believes early parental involvement is crucial for children to be successful in school.As an academic medical center, RUMC subsidizes health and medical research to improve patient care, now and for future generations, by covering expenses not funded by private or government grants. Many of the research studies directly address health need findings in RUMC's CHNA. Last year pilot funding was provided to numerous beginning career Rush researchers to stimulate new research at Rush and to develop the new researchers. Two of the research pilots funded are community based and 17 of the pilots directly address one of the eight problem areas identified in Rush's CHNA findings. Experienced Rush research scientist are currently conducting 83 community based research studies, a majority of these studies address the CHNA findings. Examples of some of these studies are described below.The Rush Institute for Healthy Aging, RIHA and the Rush Alzheimer's Disease Center, RADC, were created in the early 1990s to investigate common chronic health problems of older people especially cognitive decline and Alzheimer's disease. The RIHA conducts only research activities with no clinical activities, and is typically interested in health problems as they occur in the general population rather than in a clinical setting such as a hospital or nursing home. The RADC provides patient care and support services, conducts randomized clinical trials, and sponsors multicultural outreach programs to engage the Chicago community in research. Rush research includes multiple, longitudinal community-based cohorts, large, distinct groups of people, in the City of Chicago and nationwide. The RIHA and RADC projects includeThe Religious Orders Study, started in 1993, has enrolled nearly 1,200 older priests, nuns and brothers from more than 40 sites around the country, about a third of who reside in Cook and the collar counties. Recruitment and retention includes numerous educational programs on healthy aging and the prevention of common chronic neurologic conditions of aging and the importance of participating in research. These presentations are provided for participants and non-participants and their friends and family members. Detailed clinical evaluations are performed annually on participants. A total of 12,114 evaluations have been performed at no charge. Routine blood tests have been drawn on 2,353 participants without charge. Test results have been provided to the participants. All study participants are organ donors and a complete neuropathologic evaluation has been performed without charge on 603 participants and a report provided to family members.The Memory and Aging Project, started in 1997, is a cohort study that has enrolled more than 1,700 older residents of retirement communities and individuals in their homes from Cook and the collar counties. Recruitment and retention includes numerous educational programs on healthy aging and the prevention of common chronic neurologic conditions of aging and the importance of participating in research. These presentations are provided for participants and non-participants and their friends and family members. Detailed clinical evaluations are performed annually on those who have enrolled. A total of 10,103 evaluations have been performed on participants at no charge. Routine blood tests have been drawn on 8,620 participants without charge. Test results have been provided to the participants. All study participants are organ donors and a complete neuropathologic evaluation has been performed without charge on 523 participants and a report provided to family members. Participants have recently been offered brain MRI scans at no charge and 799 scans have been performed.The Minority Aging Research Study began in 2004 and includes 615 older community-dwelling African Americans in the Chicago area. Detailed clinical evaluations are performed annually. A total of 2,869 evaluations and blood tests have been performed on residents in Cook and the collar counties at no charge with all results provided to the participants.The Rush Department of Preventive Medicine has a long history of community research, teaching, training, and service dating back to the 1970s. Since 1990, the Department has received well over $50 million in National Institute for Health funding to conduct community-based translational research. The Rush Center for Urban Health Equity is a NIH-sponsored $10 million center grant. This Center is devoted to reducing cardiopulmonary disparities in underserved Chicago residents through research, training, education, and service. The Department of Preventive Medicine faculty and staff also generously donate their time and skills, both within and outside the Medical Center, to give back to our communities. Their efforts include numerous presentations and seminars where they collaborate with neighborhood clinics, churches, schools and other organizations to provide health education in a wide array of topics from diabetes care to asthma in children. Additionally, the department assists the Humboldt Park community through generous subsidies to its Diabetes Empowerment Center, and supports national programs like the American Heart Association annual Heart Walk. Rush continues to strengthen its commitment to the communities we serve through efforts of the Department of Preventive Medicine like Block-by-Block, an NIH-sponsored study conducted using community based participatory research and has provided services to over 13,000 individuals. Examples of studies conducted by the Department of Preventive Medicine that directly address Rush's CHNA findings include.The BRIGHTEN Heart trial is testing the hypothesis that an enhanced primary care delivery system intervention can reduce the risk of development of cardiovascular disease in low income elderly blacks and Hispanics. The overall purpose of the study is to reduce racial disparities in cardiovascular morbidity and mortality in black and Hispanic elderly by effectively controlling behavioral and psychosocial risk factors.The CHART study tests the value of a culturally-sensitive, multilevel, chronic care intervention for low-income patients hospitalized with heart failure.The Community United to Challenge Asthma (CURA) is a research study that compares a community health worker (CHW) self-management intervention to standard asthma education in high-risk Puerto Rican children in elementary and high school. During home visits, the family will be educated using a standard asthma core curriculum which is tailored to individual needs, strengths, and beliefs. The first aim is to assess the ability of the CHW intervention to reduce home asthma triggers and increase medication adherence in Puerto Rican children and adolescents with asthma. The second aim is to determine if any changes in triggers and adherence associated with this intervention are sustained 8 months after the completion of the active intervention."
201621379349302182,362174823,"Part VI, Line 4","Rush works with many community partners to provide healthcare and other resources to the community. Some of these partnerships entail the provision of resources to assist other organizations meet their strategic goals of addressing community health needs. Examples of some of these partnerships are detailed below. Charitable Contributions are a series of donations from the Executive Leadership of Rush University Medical Center, this past year RUMC gave funding to over 40 organizations.RUMC provides a full range of medical services to the community including an emergency department that is never closed and is open to everyone regardless of their ability to pay as well as numerous services that operate at a loss. While the emergency department is a key driver of providing care to the uninsured in a hospital setting, RUMC continues to emphasize primary and preventive care for uninsured individuals and families.This approach relies on the services provided within physician clinics at RUMC as well as the community service projects operated by patient care staff. In this way, RUMC hopes to have an impact on the health of patients before they get to the point of visiting the emergency department.To ensure that RUMC is delivering on its patient care mission to the diverse communities of Chicago, RUMC incurred $1.2 million in costs to maintain a staff of Spanish language interpreters and to supply other-language and sign language interpreter services. These financial commitments are critical to facilitating accessibility of patient care to the diverse communities of the Chicago area.As a not-for-profit organization, RUMC reinvests any excess revenue after paying expenses back into our institution in order to provide care for patients. A significant part of this reinvestment includes the following support services that benefit patients: free care for patients who qualify under our financial assistance program; care for patients whose government insurance does not pay all of our costs; and critical medical services that operate at a financial loss but are necessary for the community's overall health. As an academic medical center, RUMC subsidizes health and medical research to improve patient care, now and for future generations by covering expenses not funded by private or government grants. We also subsidize the education and training of the next generation of doctors, nurses and other allied health care professionals whose tuition and grants do not fully cover the associated costs. Additionally, we fund a variety of vital outreach programs that address the specific health needs of our community and beyond.RUMC is committed to providing programs to educate and train the health care workforce of the future. It is widely recognized that workforce demands in health care will rapidly escalate as the U.S. population ages. To help meet this need, RUMC trains future physicians, nurses and allied health professionals. During FY2015, RUMC provided $51 million in unreimbursed costs to maintain these education programs. It is an essential part of RUMC's corporate mission that education programs continue to receive this operational support in order to supply highly trained physicians, nurses, and allied health professionals to RUMC and to the larger health care community."

This committee is responsible for determining the health needs of the community TCH serves and implement proven programs and strategies that target those identified needs. They do this by analyzing a number of data sources including public health data, hospitalization data, health risk factor surveys, socioeconomic needs assessments, environmental standards and existing programs that had been developed for residents in their service area. The essential components examined in this process include the data indicators compiled on TCH's online community health dashboard of over 100 economical, environmental and health categories; the A.I.M. (Ask. Inform. Make a difference.) community health needs assessment; the Hamilton County public health department's community health assessment for Hamilton County; the Greater Cincinnati Community Health Status Survey and the United Way of Greater Cincinnati's Bold Goals. This community benefit data includes both qualitative and quantitative data; demographics including race, age, ethnicity and gender; socioeconomic data including income, education and health insurance rates; primary care and chronic disease needs of uninsured persons; and data on health disparities in health outcomes among minority groups. Key findings are reviewed to further identify gaps in existing community outreach and hospital based services. PATIENT EDUCATION OF ELIGIBILITY AND ASSISTANCE TCH posts its charity care policy and financial assistance contact information in admissions areas, emergency department, and other areas of the organization's facilities in which eligible patients are likely to be present. TCH provides a copy of the policy, or summary thereof, and financial assistance contact information to patients as part of the intake process and with discharge materials. Additionally, a copy of the policy or a summary along with the financial assistance contact information is included in the patient bills. TCH discusses with the patient the availability of various government benefits, such as Medicaid or state programs, where applicable. Additionally, TCH assists patients in obtaining medical benefits through federal, state, and hospital programs. TCH representatives will provide the following services at no cost to the patient: - explore eligibility, - file application on patient's behalf, - schedule and attend appointments, - provide transportation when necessary, - provide medical documentation to social security administration for disability claims. Throughout the registration and discharge process, patients and their counselors look at what options are available. TCH understands that not everyone can pay for healthcare services. TCH representatives are available to offer options and assistance for those who are uninsured or underinsured. COMMUNITY INFORMATION TCH's primary service area, comprised of 80.0% of the inpatient admissions, encompasses ten (10) counties in the Greater Cincinnati area including, Hamilton, Brown, Adams, Clermont, Butler and Warren counties in Ohio and Campbell, Kenton and Brown County in Kentucky. TCH's secondary service area, comprised of an additional 20.0% of the inpatient admissions, encompasses an additional four (4) counties including Adams, Clinton and Highland counties in Ohio; Pendleton and Grant counties in Kentucky. TCH's service area largely serves Hamilton County, which has a population of approximately 815,400 with 14.2% of the population over the age of 65. Hamilton County population includes 13.6% of the population living at less than 100.0% of the federal poverty line. Approximately 68.9% of the Hamilton County population is Caucasian and 25.1% is African American; 2.1% of the population is Asian, and the remaining 4.0% is of other ethnicity. Within Hamilton County, 52.9% of the households have an average income level of less than $50,000; 27.8% of the average household income levels are $50,000 and $100,000; and 19.3% of the average household income levels are greater than $100,000. PROMOTION OF COMMUNITY HEALTH TCH operates an emergency room open to all persons regardless of ability to pay. In addition to providing emergency services, a systematic approach is used to determine community health needs with input from organizations such as the Center for Closing the Health Gap, the TCH Family Advisory Council, and the Gathering of Community Health Statistics by the KSI Clinical Services Portfolio Team and by the marketing department. Information gathered through these sources has led to the deployment of the palliative care program, a center for health and aging to address the special needs of geriatric patients and a newly remodeled behavioral health unit at a time when other healthcare providers in the community were discontinuing that service. TCH also supports the community in numerous fund drives such as United Way, American Heart Association, diabetes walk, cancer walk and fine arts fund. At the beginning of each school year and at Christmas, TCH staff also donates school supplies and gifts to the students at Taft Elementary School located in Mt. Auburn. In addition, the staff provides mentoring opportunities to undergraduate and graduate student interns interested in healthcare careers and also to explorer scouts.

201641349349300939,231352213,"SCHEDULE H, PART III, LINE 8","Medicare costs were derived from the Medicare cost report filed by the organization. Medicare underpayments and bad debt are community benefit and associated costs are includable on the Form 990, Schedule H, Part I. The organization feels that Medicare underpayments (shortfall) and bad debt are community benefit and associated costs are includable on the Form 990, Schedule H, Part I. As outlined more fully below the organization believes that these services and related costs promote the health of the community as a whole and are rendered in conjunction with the organization's charitable tax-exempt purposes and mission in providing medically necessary healthcare services to all individual's in a non-discriminatory manner without regard to race, color, creed, sex, national origin, religion or ability to pay and consistent with the community benefit standard promulgated by the IRS. The community benefit standard is the current standard for a hospital for recognition as a tax-exempt and charitable organization under Internal Revenue Code (""IRC"") 501(c)(3). The organization is recognized as a tax-exempt entity and charitable organization under 501(c)(3) of the IRC. Although there is no definition in the tax code for the term ""charitable"", a regulation promulgated by the department of the treasury provides some guidance and states that ""[t]he term charitable is used in 501(c)(3) in its generally accepted legal sense,"" and provides examples of charitable purposes, including the relief of the poor or unprivileged; the promotion of social welfare; and the advancement of education, religion, and science. Note: it does not explicitly address the activities of hospitals. In the absence of explicit statutory or regulatory requirements applying the term ""charitable"" to hospitals, it has been left to the IRS to determine the criteria hospitals must meet to qualify as IRC 501(c)(3) charitable organizations. The original standard was known as the charity care standard. This standard was replaced by the IRS with the community benefit standard which is the current standard. Charity care standard In 1956, the IRS issued Revenue Ruling 56-185, which addressed the requirements hospitals needed to meet in order to qualify for IRC 501(c)(3) status. One of these requirements is known as the ""charity care standard."" under the standard, a hospital had to provide, to the extent of its financial ability, free or reduced-cost care to patients unable to pay for it. A hospital that expected full payment did not, according to the ruling, provide charity care based on the fact that some patients ultimately failed to pay. The ruling emphasized that a low level of charity care did not necessarily mean that a hospital had failed to meet the requirement since that level could reflect its financial ability to provide such care. The ruling also noted that publicly supported community hospitals would normally qualify as charitable organizations because they serve the entire community, and a low level of charity care would not affect a hospital's exempt status if it was due to the surrounding community's lack of charitable demands. Community benefit standard In 1969, the IRS issued Revenue Ruling 69-545, which ""remove[d]"" from Revenue Ruling 56-185 ""the requirements relating to caring for patients without charge or at rates below cost."" under the standard developed in Revenue Ruling 69-545, which is known as the ""community benefit standard,"" hospitals are judged on whether they promote the health of a broad class of individuals in the community. The ruling involved a hospital that only admitted individuals who could pay for the services (by themselves, private insurance, or public programs such as Medicare), but operated a full-time emergency room that was open to everyone. The IRS ruled that the hospital qualified as a charitable organization because it promoted the health of people in its community. The IRS reasoned that because the promotion of health was a charitable purpose according to the general law of charity, it fell within the ""generally accepted legal sense"" of the term ""charitable,"" as required by Treas. Reg. 1.501(c)(3)-1(d)(2). The IRS ruling stated that the promotion of health, like the relief of poverty and the advancement of education and religion, is one of the purposes in the general law of charity that is deemed beneficial to the community as a whole even though the class of beneficiaries eligible to receive a direct benefit from its activities does not include all members of the community, such as indigent members of the community, provided that the class is not so small that its relief is not of benefit to the community. The IRS concluded that the hospital was ""promoting the health of a class of persons that is broad enough to benefit the community"" because its emergency room was open to all and it provided care to everyone who could pay, whether directly or through third-party reimbursement. Other characteristics of the hospital that the IRS highlighted included the following: its surplus funds were used to improve patient care, expand hospital facilities, and advance medical training, education, and research; it was controlled by a board of trustees that consisted of independent civic leaders; and hospital medical staff privileges were available to all qualified physicians. Medicare underpayments and bad debt are community benefit and associated costs are includable on the Form 990, Schedule H, Part I. The American Hospital Association (""AHA"") feels that Medicare underpayments (shortfall) and bad debt are community benefit and thus includable on the Form 990, Schedule H, Part I. This organization agrees with the AHA position. As outlined in the aha letter to the IRS dated August 21, 2007 with respect to the first published draft of the new Form 990 and Schedule H, the AHA felt that the IRS should incorporate the full value of the community benefit that hospitals provide by counting Medicare underpayments (shortfall) and bad debt as quantifiable community benefit for the following reasons: - providing care for the elderly and serving medicare patients is an essential part of the community benefit standard. - medicare, like medicaid, does not pay the full cost of care. Recently, medicare reimburses hospitals only 92 cents for every dollar they spend to take care of medicare patients. The medicare payment advisory commission (""medpac"") in its march 2007 report to congress cautioned that underpayment will get even worse, with margins reaching a 10-year low at negative 5.4 percent. - many medicare beneficiaries, like their medicaid counterparts, are poor. More than 46 percent of medicare spending is for beneficiaries whose income is below 200 percent of the federal poverty level. Many of those medicare beneficiaries are also eligible for medicaid -- so called ""dual eligibles."" There is every compelling public policy reason to treat medicare and medicaid underpayments similarly for purposes of a hospital's community benefit and include these costs on form 990, schedule h, part i. Medicare underpayment must be shouldered by the hospital in order to continue treating the community's elderly and poor. These underpayments represent a real cost of serving the community and should count as a quantifiable community benefit. Both the AHA and this organization also feel that patient bad debt is a community benefit and thus includable on the Form 990, Schedule H, Part I. There are compelling reasons that patient bad debt should be counted as quantifiable community benefit as follows: - a significant majority of bad debt is attributable to low-income patients, who, for many reasons, decline to complete the forms required to establish eligibility for hospitals' charity care or financial assistance programs. A 2006 congressional budget office (""cbo"") report, nonprofit hospitals and the provision of community benefits, cited two studies indicating that ""the great majority of bad debt was attributable to patients with incomes below 200% of the federal poverty line."" - the report also noted that a substantial portion of bad debt is pending charity care. Unlike bad debt in other industries, hospital bad debt is complicated by the fact that hospitals follow their mission to the community and treat every patient that comes through their emergency department, regardless of ability to pay. Patients who have outstanding bills are not turned away, unlike other industries. Bad debt is further complicated by the auditing industry's standards on reporting charity care. Many patients cannot or do not provide the necessary, extensive documentation required to be deemed charity care by auditors. As a result, roughly 10% of bad debt is pending charity care. - the cbo concluded that its findings ""support the validity of the use of uncompensated care [bad debt and charity care] as a measure of community benefits"" assuming the findings are generalizable nationwide; the experience of"
201641349349300939,231352213,"SCHEDULE H, PART III, LINE 9B","Accounts considered to be charity care are not included in the bad debt expense, but rather, are accounted for as an allowance against the organization's patient service revenue. St. Luke's financial assistance program St. Luke's is a non-profit organization dedicated to the care and treatment of the sick and the prevention of illness. The first consideration in the admission and placement or treatment of a patient is the medical needs of the patient. Patients shall be provided and encouraged to obtain medically necessary care regardless of ability to pay or eligibility for financial assistance. However, all patients will be required to pay for the care which they receive if they are financially able to do so. Advance payment will not be required for any medically necessary service. Some individuals fail to obtain necessary care due to financial concerns. In order to encourage such patients to obtain appropriate care, St. Luke's shall operate a Financial Assistance program for the uninsured indigent population and a discount program for all other uninsured patients. All patients presenting for medically necessary services with no insurance will have the opportunity to qualify for St. Luke's Financial Assistance Program. Services excluded from the program include but are not limited to: cosmetic, bariatric, IVF, IUDs, tubal ligations and sleep study. St. Luke's reserves the right to exclude services if upon review it is determined that they are not medically necessary. In addition, patients scheduled for elective procedures or studies will be assessed for medical need and timing for the procedure along with ability to pay for a portion of the procedure. Eligibility for the PA Fair Care program will be reviewed and application required if eligible. Medical Assistance application may be required and completed prior to service for elective cases. Patients who meet a hardship exemption for the Affordable Care Act (ACA) may apply for Financial Assistance upon signing an attestation form of hardship eligibility. Patients receiving inpatient or high dollar outpatient services will be evaluated for Medical Assistance eligibility and ACA in order to qualify for the St. Luke's Hospital Financial Assistance Program. Individuals will not be eligible for financial assistance if Medical Assistance or ACA coverage is denied due to lack of cooperation (i.e. timeliness or failure to produce required documentation). Any patient payments made for services that subsequently receive Medical Assistance approval will be refunded to the patient. Financial Assistance Individuals with family income at or below 300% of the current federal poverty guidelines may be eligible for a 100% financial assistance allowance on the cost of their medically necessary services, after a minimum copay amount for certain outpatient services as follows: Clinic visits, including the hospital family practice centers, rural health centers, women's and children's clinics = $10. Other programs within the clinics may establish a flat rate minimum amount due for elective procedures that are at or below the Medical Assistance fee schedule for patients not eligible for Medical Assistance but are under the 300% federal poverty guidelines. Urgent care center visits = $15 Emergency room visits= $25 Uninsured patients with income exceeding 300% of federal poverty guidelines will automatically receive an 80% discount on hospital charges. No proof of income is required for this discount and this is not considered Financial Assistance. Patients with routine co-pays and deductibles from managed care and commercial insurances are not eligible for financial assistance or a discount unless a financial hardship can be proven. Patients having limited benefit coverage through insurance and who demonstrate a financial hardship may be eligible for the Financial Assistance program. Patients who have received financial assistance in the past but who are having services that are elective or high dollar procedures, visits will be required to comply with the process of Medical Assistance eligibility or eligibility for programs such as ACA. Case by case decisions will be made regarding financial liability in each instance. Determining Eligibility for Financial Assistance Designated business service department employees will utilize independent third party income estimation software information as the determinant of eligibility. The income estimation software application utilized by St. Luke's is based upon a statistically validated methodology to provide income and family size determination. This information is then automatically cross-walked to St. Luke's financial assistance eligibility matrix ranging from 0% to 300% of the current federal poverty guidelines to determine the level of financial assistance to be applied. When insufficient information is returned via the software application, the manual process below will be utilized to determine eligibility. In determining family income and family size, a family unit will be defined as immediate family members/significant other/domestic partner living in the household. All income of occupants will be considered in determining total household income. In determining income the following will be considered: - Wages - Pension - Annuities - Social Security - Interest, Dividend, and other Investment Income such as Capital Gains - Unemployment Compensation - Workers Comp - Disability Benefits - Child Support - Alimony - Public Assistance - Net Rental Income (Income Less Expenses) as calculated for Federal Tax purposes Assets may be considered in determining eligibility and the level of discount approved for financial assistance. Designated business service department employees may also discuss financial assistance with patients who upon receiving a billing statement express an inability to pay for services rendered. Financial assistance applications may be supplied to these patients along with the information regarding required documentation or the income estimation software may be used to determine eligibility status. Medical Indigence Assessment If the patient does not qualify for any of the financial assistance categories identified above, but the medical expenses exceed an ability to pay, the patient will be encouraged to write a hardship letter to be submitted to the Associate Vice President of Finance for consideration of a hardship write-off of all or part of the outstanding medical liability. In the case of foreign visitors, the hospital will attempt to identify the person who sponsored the visitor's entry into the United States. If the sponsor is legally responsible for the visitor's medical bills, the hospital will apply its normal collection efforts in attempting to collect from the sponsor. Application for financial assistance will be based on the sponsor's income. St. Luke's Hospital reserves the right to deny an application for financial assistance based upon lack of reasonably required documentation or the submission of fraudulent documentation. If information is not provided, an application may be denied unless the information was not provided for reasons beyond the applicant's control. In these cases the patient will not be eligible for the financial assistance program. Notification to Patient All patients receiving inpatient or high dollar OP services will receive a notice of determination from the business office with the amount of financial assistance granted and any remaining financial liability. Patients may provide documentation if they feel the automatic estimation of income and assets is incorrect or incomplete. The business office will assess and revise the determination as appropriate for future encounters based on the software information provided. All patient statements will have the phone number to call for patients having difficulty meeting financial obligations. St. Luke's credit and collection policy The Credit and Collection policy is established and is to be administered in accordance with the mission and values of the hospital as well as federal and state law. The policy is designed to promote appropriate access to medical care for all patients regardless of their ability to pay while maintaining the Network's fiscal responsibility to maximize reimbursement and minimize bad debt. All medically necessary hospital services are provided without consideration of ability to pay and are not delayed pending application and/or approval of Medical Assistance or St. Luke's Financial Assistance Program. Advance payment is not required for any medically necessary service. This Credit and Collection policy is intended to take into account each individual's ability to contribute to the cost of his or her care. Patients will be assisted in obtaining health insurance coverage from privately and publicly funded sources whenever possible. All Patient Business Service department representatives will be educated on all aspects of the Credit and"

Analysis of information from the following sources is part of the department's ongoing health needs assessment process: vital statistics, Pennsylvania Department of Health data, hospital discharge data, the Robert Wood Johnson County health profiles and other county data available from various other state agencies. In addition, the department collects ongoing statistics from its comprehensive community outreach initiatives and from financial support for the Bethlehem partnership for a healthy community.

Currently more than 165 participating/funding agencies, representing local business, government, educational and community organizations are actively involved in partnership programs which serve the greater Lehigh Valley. Through community ownership and shared responsibility, the partnership strives to enhance the physical, mental, emotional and spiritual wellness of individuals and communities, thereby improving the quality of life for all. The department's healthcare needs assessment process is enhanced by data obtained through the Bethlehem partnership's various school-based programs, such as numbers of children failing dental and vision examinations and number of children not receiving medical examinations. The department also utilizes guidelines for adolescent preventive services (gaps) in the Bethlehem partnership's various mobile van service programs to collect data on risk factors for students and to monitor community health problems. For example, data has been tracked on risk factors such as smoking, obesity, seatbelt use and drug and alcohol use. Gaps is also used on an ongoing basis to build and modify programs. Most recently, the network has contracted with the Lehigh Valley Research Consortium to conduct a formal health needs assessment for the greater Lehigh Valley and Upper Bucks County area, served by St. Luke's Hospital (Allentown/Bethlehem), St. Luke's Quakertown Hospital and the Visiting Nurse Association of St. Luke's.

Given this mission and within the guidelines of prudent business management, it is further the policy of Temple University Health System (TUHS) that an orderly and controlled system for the write-off of all types of Bad Debt and Charity Care balances is in effect to insure maximum collections. All patients have the option to apply for the hospital's Charity Care Program. The guiding principles behind this policy are to treat all patients equally, with dignity and respect, to serve the emergency healthcare needs of everyone in the community, to assist patients who cannot pay and to balance appropriate financial assistance for patients with fiscal responsibility. Patients and their families have a responsibility to assist TUHS the hospital in qualifying them for financial assistance.

These activities include the following programs:Community Support: (1) Temple University Hospital Emergency Preparedness and Research Program. The purpose of this program is to ensure that our staff and hospital facilities are prepared to continue to provide safe, quality patient care even under the most austere conditions. We ensure that our staff and facilities are prepared for disasters and other emergencies by working on many levels, both within the hospital and in the communities we serve. The TUH Emergency Preparedness and Research Program is also a critical link in the federal, state and local disaster response plans. Our Emergency Preparedness Department is involved in three local committees, including the North Philadelphia Emergency Healthcare Support Zone, the Regional Hospital Subcommittee; and the Emergency Support Function-8 Work Group. These committees are focused on creation of drills, policy development, and continuing education.(2) Cradle to Grave Anti-Violence. This program helps reduce the financial, emotional, and societal costs of gun violence in the City of Philadelphia. Temple's Cradle to Grave program works with at-risk youth to help break the cycle of gun violence, reaching more than 1,400 people this year. Since the program began in 2006, Cradle to Grave has connected with more than 10,000 middle and high school students, as well as at-risk youth from area alternative schools and the Juvenile Justice Center of Philadelphia.(3) Blood Drives. Temple University Hospital works closely with the American Red Cross to support its mission of providing a safe and reliable blood supply that helps ensure quality outcomes and save lives. This year, Temple helped collect about 277 pints of blood from employees and physicians.(4) Philadelphia MOM program: Temple University Hospital assists the Philadelphia Department of Health in providing early interventions for healthy newborns. After identification at Temple University Hospital, city social workers make home visitations through the child's 6th birthday to ensure that they have access to healthcare and educational resources. (5) Temple University Hospital conducts numerous employees engagement activities throughout the year, including collections for new coats and clothing, holiday gifts, food, and school supplies to benefit low income families living in our communities. We are particularly proud of the support that we provide to local public schools, where many families have limited resources to purchase warm weather clothing and school supplies for their young children. (6) Temple University Hospital also assists in providing free space and supports for the City of Philadelphia District Attorney Office Youth Aid Panel, as well as the Philadelphia Election Commission's efforts to provide safe, accessible polling places for community members.(7) Temple Center for Population Health: Serves as an interface with federal, state and local agencies and with community based organizations to collaborate on initiatives to improve the health of our low-income, diverse, medically complex population.Workforce Development: Investment in Community's Healthcare Workforce. The purpose of this program is to build local workforce and improve skills sets needed to deliver quality healthcare. This involves comprehensive training and education to help workers living in our community adapt and improve skills to enable them to participate in a changing healthcare workplace. About half the students are union members and half from the general community, including laid-off workers and Welfare recipients.Community Health Worker Program: Work in partnership with TU Center for Social Policy, District Council 1199c Training and Upgrade Fund and Philadelphia Workforce Development Corporation to develop job skills for unemployed individuals living in our community while achieving the national goals of improving healthcare quality, improving the health of our communities, and reducing the cost of quality care."

In 2015, the cost of providing services to the Medicare population was $7,007,272 higher than revenue. Medicare allowable cost was based on cost apportionment derived from the Medicare Cost Report. The Medicare shortfall carried by TUH provides a community benefit because it benefits a charitable class, the elderly."

If a patient does not qualify for charity care or qualifies for only a charity care discount, the normal billing process of four (4) statements over a span of at least 120 days will occur. If no patient response is received, a write-off request form will be completed by the collection specialist and submitted for proper signature authority for agency referral. Once approved, the account will be transferred to the Bad Debt Financial Class logged. The account will be forwarded to the collection agency for additional collection effort. Collection vendors are required to include in their collection notifications notice that Temple provides free and/or reduced price care to persons who qualify, that Temple provides assistance in applying for and obtaining government funded insurance, and that patients can contact Temple's Financial Services Department for assistance."

These partnerships enable TUH to coordinate care delivery in both the inpatient and outpatient settings.In Women's Health TUH collaborates with three FQHCs, Esperanza Community Health Center, Maria Del los Santos Health Center, and Greater Philadelphia Health Action to provide Obstetrical Care. Through this partnership community physicians are integrated with the Temple faculty and community practices to provide a full range of obstetrical services for their patients. In addition, TUH participates with the City of Philadelphia MOM Program. This early intervention program consists of frequent phone calls and home visits to encourage mothers to have their babies immunized on schedule and to participate in needed developmental and educational services. The program seeks to fill the gap between children's need for services and mothers' ability to assure their children's participation in those services.Temple University Hospital also works closely with our community partners to provide for adult health services. The physicians of Esperanza Community Health Center maintain staff privileges and provide continuity of care for their patients at TUH. The group participates in the Temple University Internal Medicine Residency Programs. Maria Delos Santos Health Center and Greater Philadelphia Health Action provide outpatient services and refer patients to TUH for inpatient care.The Hospital also maintains a close relationship with City of Philadelphia Health Department and its District Health Centers.

The provision for doubtful accounts and the allowance for doubtful accounts relate primarily to amounts due directly from patients. An estimated allowance for doubtful accounts is recorded for all uninsured accounts, regardless of the aging of those accounts. Accounts are written off when all reasonable internal and external collections efforts have been performed. Our collection policies include a review of all accounts against certain standard collection criteria, upon completion of our internal collection efforts. Accounts determined to possess positive collectability attributes are forwarded to a secondary external collections agency and the other accounts are written off. The accounts that are not collected by the secondary external collection agency are written off when they are returned to us by the collection agency (usually within 12 months). Write-offs are based upon specific identification and the write-off process requires a write-off adjustment entry to the patient accounting system. We do not pursue collection of amounts related to patients that meet our guidelines to qualify as charity care.

201621339349300107,520610538,Community Building Activities,"Part II Through a variety of community building activities, UM Shore Regional Health promotes health and wellness in the community it serves. These activities include: active engagement and collaboration with local Health Departments, Chambers of Commerce, and organizations that work to improve the quality of life for the residents of the Mid-Shore (Talbot, Caroline, Dorchester, Queen Annes, and Kent Counties) Because local action is essential to public health progress, UM Shore Regional Health is a key stakeholder in the Mid-Shore Health Improvement Coalition, a partnership of public sector agencies, health care providers and community-based partners. The coalition was formed in December 2011 in response to a Statewide Health Improvement Process (SHIP). In addition to providing the coalition with leadership, a variety of clinical and non-clinical UM SRH associates serve on various coalition workgroups. The work of the coalition began by reviewing and prioritizing objectives identified by the Maryland Department of Health and Mental Hygienes (DHMH) State Health Improvement Process (SHIP). SHIP, launched in September 2011, focuses on improving the health of Maryland residents in six vision areas: Healthy Babies, Healthy Social Environments, Safe Physical Environments, Infectious Disease, Chronic Disease and Health Care Access. Under SHIPs umbrella, the coalition develops and implements strategies that will improve local public health. The coalition decided to focus on three health priorities: (1) adolescent obesity, (2) adolescent tobacco use, and (3) diabetes related emergency department visits. The coalition formulated an action plan that articulates specific goals and strategies for the three health priorities. Through coalition workgroups and committees, representatives from the Mid-Shore collaborate to assess local health needs and services; share data and other resources; explore evidence-based health practices; and acquire support to enhance and initiate health programs that impact targeted populations and communities. The coalition plans to effectively leverage and utilize new and existing resources to measurably improve the health status of the residents of the Mid-Shore. In addition to being an integral part of the Mid-Shore Health Improvement Coalition, UM SRH continues to maintain open communication with the Health Departments of Talbot, Caroline, Dorchester, Queen Annes, and Kent Counties, Mid-Shore Mental Health System, Choptank Community Health System, local government and schools. UM SRHs community outreach programs can be found in County schools, senior centers, community centers and churches throughout the Mid-Shore. UM SRHs director of community outreach participates in committees and advisory councils, promoting continuous dialogue between the medical center and community stakeholders. This provides opportunities for new ideas and programs to be exchanged, allowing UM SRH to maximize community outreach efforts. UM SRH seeks insight from community members attending educational programs through its outreach events. Program participants are asked to complete a brief survey evaluation, providing feedback and comments about the program they attended, as well as providing suggestions for future program topics."

AT THAT TIME, THE HSCRC APPROVED RATES APPLIED ONLY TO COMMERCIAL INSURERS. IN 1977, THE HSCRC NEGOTIATED A WAIVER FROM MEDICARE HOSPITAL PAYMENT RULES FOR MARYLAND HOSPITALS TO BRING THE FEDERAL MEDICARE PAYMENTS UNDER HSCRC CONTROL. MEDICARE REIMBURSES MARYLAND HOSPITALS ACCORDING TO RATES ESTABLISHED BYTHE HSCRC AS LONG AS THE STATE CONTINUES TO MEET A TWO-PART TEST. THIS TWO-PART WAIVER TEST ALLOWS MEDICARE TO PARTICIPATE IN THE MARYLAND SYSTEM AS LONG AS TWO CONDITIONS ARE MET. - ALL OTHER PAYERS PARTICIPATING IN THE SYSTEM PAY HSCRC SET RATES, AND - THE RATE OF GROWTH IN MEDICARE PAYMENTS TO MARYLAND HOSPITALS FROM 1981 TO THE PRESENT IS NOT GREATER THAN THE RATE OF GROWTH IN MEDICARE PAYMENTS TO HOSPITALS NATIONALLY OVER THE SAME TIME FRAME. BAD DEBT EXPENSE FOOTNOTE ON AUDITED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS Schedule H, Part III, Line 4 For receivables associated with services provided to patients who have third-party coverage, the Corporation analyzes contractually due amounts and provides an allowance for bad debts, allowance for contractual adjustments, provision for bad debts, and contractual adjustments on accounts for which third-party payor has not yet paid or for payors who are known to be having financial difficulties that make the realization of the amounts due unlikely. For receivables associated with self-pay patients or balances remaining after third-party coverage has already paid, the Corporation records a significant provision for bad debts in the period of service on the basis of its historical collections, which indicates that many patients ultimately do not pay the portion of their bill for which they are financially responsible. The difference between the discounted rates and the amounts collected after all reasonable collection efforts have been exhausted is charged off against the allowance for Bad Debts. allowance for Bad Debts."

201621339349300107,520610538,Eligibility Education,"Schedule H, Part VI, Line 3 It is the policy of UM Shore Regional Health to work with our patients to identify available resources to pay for their care. All patients presenting as self pay and requesting charity relief from their bill will be screened at all points of entry, for possible coverage through state programs and a probable determination for coverage for either Medical Assistance or Financial Assistance (charity care) from the hospital is immediately given to the patient. The process is resource intensive and time consuming for patients and the hospital; however, if patients qualify for one of these programs, then they will have health benefits that they will carry with them beyond their current hospital bills, and allow them to access preventive care services as well. UM Shore Regional Health works with a business partner who will work with our patients to assist them with the state assistance programs, which is free to our patients. If a patient does not qualify for Medicaid or another program, UM Shore Regional Health offers our financial assistance program. UM Shore Regional Health posts notices of our policy in conspicuous places throughout the hospitals- including the emergency department, has information within our hospital billing brochure, educates all new employees thoroughly on the process during orientation, and does a yearly re- education to all existing staff. All staff have copies of the financial assistance application, both in English and Spanish, to supply to patients who we deem, after screening, to have a need for assistance. UM Shore Regional Health has a dedicated Financial Assistance Liaison to work with our patients to assist them with this process and expedite the decision process. Shore Health notifies patients of availability of financial assistance funds prior to service during our calls to patients, through signage at all of our registration locations, through our patient billing brochure and through our discussions with patients during registration. In addition, the information sheet is mailed to patients with all statements and/or handed to them if needed. Notices are sent regarding our Hill Burton program (services at reduced cost) yearly as well. - Shore Health prepares its FAP in a culturally sensitive manner, at a reading comprehension level appropriate to the CBSA's population, and in Spanish. - Shore Health posts its FAP and financial assistance contact information in admissions areas, emergency rooms, and other areas of facilities in which eligible patients are likely to present; - Shore Health provides a copy of the FAP and financial assistance contact information to patients or their families as part of the intake process; - Shore Health provides a copy of the FAP and financial assistance contact information to patients with discharge materials. - A copy of Shore Health's FAP along with financial assistance contact information, is provided in patient bills; and/or - Shore Health discusses with patients or their families the availability of various government benefits, such as Medicaid or state programs, and assists patients with qualification for such programs, where applicable. - An abbreviated statement referencing Shore Health's financial assistance policy, including a phone number to call for more information, is run annually in the local newspaper (Star Democrat)."
201621339349300107,520610538,Description of Community Served,"Schedule H, Part VI, Line 4 Situated on Maryland's Eastern Shore, Shore Regional Healths three hospitals, University of Maryland Medical Center at Easton (UMC at Easton), University of Maryland Medical Center at Dorchester (UMC at Dorchester), University of Maryland Medical Center at Chestertown (UMC at Chestertown) are not for profit hospitals offering a complete range of inpatient and outpatient services to over 175,000 people throughout the Mid-Shore of Maryland. Shore Regional Healths service area is defined as the Maryland counties of Caroline, Dorchester, Talbot, Queen Annes and Kent. UMC at Easton is situated at the center of the mid-shore area and thus serves a large rural geographical area (all 5 counties of the mid-shore). UMC at Dorchester is located approximately 18 miles from Easton and primarily serves Dorchester County and portions of Caroline County. UMC at Chestertown located in Chestertown, in Kent County merged with Shore Regional Health in July 2013. UMC at Chestertown serves the residents of Kent County, portions of Queen Annes and Caroline Counties and the surrounding areas. The five counties of the Mid-Shore comprise 20% of the landmass of the State of Maryland and 2% of the population. The entire region has over 4,400 employers with nearly 45,000 workers. Only 50 of those employers employ 100 or more workers. Almost 85% of employers in this rural region are manufacturing firms, which require workers with high-level technology skills as well as low-skilled workers. ( 9.62% adults have less than a 9th grade education and another 9.62% have an education at the 9th -12th grade level but do not have a high school diploma). The service industry is growing rapidly as the local population shifts to include more senior adults who retire to this beautiful area of the State. Although the seafood industry continues to be important to the region it is fast becoming an endangered species The level of economic distress in the region is immediately evident when compared with the state figure especially for Caroline, Dorchester, and Kent Counties. It should be noted that Talbot County appears to have a significantly higher median income than Caroline and Dorchester, however, a large percentage of the population has incomes in line with those of Caroline and Dorchester. The figures for Talbot are somewhat skewed due to large incomes of a few individual families and high net worth individuals. According to the Maryland Department of Labor, Licensing and Regulation and the Bureau of Labor Statistics as of June 2015, the State unemployment rate was 7.2%. The unemployment rate for Caroline Countys was 5.7%, Dorchester Countys was 9.7%. Talbot Countys was 5.2%, Kent Countys was 5.6%, Queen Annes was 4.9%. Source: http://dllr.maryland.gov/lmi/laus/; http://www.dllr.state.md.us/lmi/emppay/ Shore Regional Healths service area has a higher percentage of population aged 65 and older as compared to Maryland overall. Talbot County has a 23.7 % rate for this age group and Kent County has 21.8% of its residents age 65 years or older. These rates are 65% higher than Marylands percentage and higher than other rural areas in the state by almost a quarter. Today, more than two-thirds of all health care costs are for treating chronic illnesses. Among health care costs for older Americans, 95% are for chronic diseases. The cost of providing health care for one person aged 65 or older is three to five times higher than the cost for someone younger than 65.

JAMA. 1996;276(18):1473-1479 While progress is being made, the Mid-Shore economy still faces a myriad of challenges that include limited access to affordable high speed broadband services, a shortage of affordable housing, an inadequate supply of skilled workers, low per capita income, and more layoffs in the manufacturing sector.(Source: Mid Shore Comprehensive Economic Development Strategy CEDS) In terms of healthcare, large disparities exist between Blacks and Whites as reported by the Office of Minority Health and Health Disparities, DHMH. For emergency department (ED) visit rates for diabetes, asthma and hypertension, the Black rates are typically 3- to 5 fold higher than White rates. Adults at healthy weight metrics is lower (worse) for Blacks in all three counties where Black data could be reported. Heart disease mortality Black rates are variously higher or lower compared to White rates in individual counties. In Caroline, the Black rate is lower than the White rates not because the Black rate is particularly low, but because the White rate is unusually high. For cancer mortality, Black rates exceed White rates in Dorchester, Kent, Queen Annes and Talbot. In Caroline, Black rates are lower, again because of a rather high White rate. The Black rates and White rates are below the State Health Improvement Process (SHIP) goals. (Source: http://www.dhmh.maryland.gov/ship). County Health Rankings for the Mid-Shore counties also reveal the large disparities between counties for health outcomes in the service area. Overall, Queen Annes County ranks 6th; Talbot County ranks 7th; Dorchester ranks 19th; Caroline ranks 23rd, Kent ranks 18th (out of 24 counties including Baltimore City) in health outcomes that indicate the overall health of the county (Source:http://www.countyhealthrankings.org/maryland/ 2015).

201621339349300107,520610538,Promoting the Health of the Community,"Part VI, Line 5 The analysis of local data indicated that diabetes, heart disease, cancer, behavioral health and access to care were all health improvement priorities for the Mid-Shore. After careful review of County health data, the Mid-Shore SHIP Coalition prioritized the potential health improvement areas and decided to focus the Coalition's efforts on three areas: (1) adolescent obesity, (2) adolescent tobacco use, and (3) diabetes related emergency department visits. The Coalition is committed to examining what evidence-based initiatives can improve the county's health in these three areas related to racial, ethnic and other demographic and geographic-related health disparities. Maryland's State Health Improvement Process (SHIP) provides a framework for continual progress toward a healthier Maryland. Maryland's State Heath Improvement Process (SHIP) began with national, state and local data being reviewed and analyzed by the Maryland Department of Health and Mental Hygiene (DHMH) Office of Population Health as well as by the 5 Departments of Health (Talbot, Caroline, Dorchester, Queen Anne's, Kent). It has three main components: accountability, local action and public engagement. SHIP includes 39 measures that provide a framework to improve the health of Maryland residents. Twenty-eight of the measures have been identified as critical racial/ethnic health disparities. Each measure has a data source and a target, and where possible, can be assessed at the county level. UM SRH's priorities are aligned with the Maryland State Health Improvement Process vision areas and those objectives outlined by the local health improvement coalition. UM SRH's Priorities: 1. Chronic Diseases (Obesity, Heart Disease, Diabetes and Cancer) 2. Wellness and Access 3. Reducing ED visits due to chronic disease 4. Access to Care Several additional topic areas were identified by the CHNA Steering Committee including: safe housing, transportation, and substance abuse. The unmet needs not addressed by UM SRH will continue to be addressed by key governmental agencies and existing community- based organizations. While UM SRH will focus the majority of our efforts on the identified priorities outlined in the CHNA Action Plan, we will review the complete set of needs identified in the CHNA for future collaboration and work. These areas, while still important to the health of the community, will be met through other health care organizations with our assistance as available. Initiative 1 Identified Need: Chronic Disease Management Hospital Initiative: Shore Wellness Partners (SWP) provides community case management, at no charge, to community members who meet the eligibility criteria Primary Objective of Initiative/Metrics that will be Used to Evaluate the Results: Shore Well Partners is a unique program that provides a continuum of care, focusing on preventive care to improve the ability of patients and families to work together to reduce emergency department visits and readmissions. The program is designed for at-risk families and individuals who do not have sufficient resources and are not eligible for other in-home services. Wellness Partners helps patients with disease management and life skills so that they can continue to live in their own homes. The service is provided by Shore Health System at no charge for those who qualify. Objectives: - Managing physical health problems - Connection with other community services - Dietary education - Home safety evaluations - Safe medicine use - Education on specific illness and treatments - Emotional support - Monitoring client progress through home visits or phone calls Total Number of People Within the Target Population: The number of clients serviced depends on the complexity and needs of the client. FY15, 400 people identified as approved for referral. Total Number of People Reached by the Initiative Within the Target Population: 1. New clients = 115 2. Number of patient visits = 3,954 Single of Multi-Year Initiative Time Period: Multi-year initiative beginning in 2011. Key Partners and/or Hospitals in Initiative Development and/or Implementation: Members of the Shore Wellness Partners team include advanced practice nurses and medical social workers. These specialists work with patients, caregivers, and primary care providers (sometimes care is provided in the patient's home). Shore Wellness Partners is a partner in the HEZ for Dorchester and Caroline Counties. Detailed information for the HEZ model, Competent Care Connections can be found at: http://dhmh.org Evaluation Dates: July 1, 2014 through June 30 FY15. Evaluation of Outcomes: (1) # of referrals to service ;( 2) # of patients on service with Shore Wellness Partners; (3) Comparison of ALL CAUSE readmissions for FY15 Key Collaborators in Delivery of the Initiative: Members of the Shore Wellness Partners team include advanced practice nurses and medical social workers. These specialists work with patients, caregivers, and primary care providers (sometimes care is provided in the patient's home). Shore Wellness Partners is a partner in the HEZ for Dorchester and Caroline Counties. Detailed information for the HEZ model, Competent Care Connections can be found at: http://dhmh.maryland.gov/healthenterprisezones/SitePages/Home. Outcomes (process and impact measures included): There was a 48% reduction in hospital admissions for clients on service with SWP for 0-6 months, which represented 84% of the SWP clients in FY 2015. This admission reduction is similar to the Glendening-Napoli, Dowling, Pulvion, Baillargeon and Raimer (2012) study that found a 53% decrease in hospital admissions. Evaluation of Outcomes: Based on FY 2015 history, readmissions to the hospital, SWP had a 4.6% 30 day readmission rate for clients served. Continuation of Initiative: Yes, Expansion of SWP to Chestertown, Kent County. Total Cost of Initiative: $ 582,158 (includes staff salary and supplies Does not include indirect overhead) Direct offsetting revenue from Restricted Grants HEZ Grant: $35,000 Initiative 2 Identified Need: Cardiovascular, The Antithrombosis Clinic is designed to provide dedicated health care monitoring for those patient receiving chronic warfarin therapy. Warfarin therapy is reported widely in the medical literature as having significant morbidities associated with long-term therapy. Vigilant monitoring is necessary to avoid these complications. This clinic provides close monitoring of these patients with dedicated, knowledgeable staff. Through close monitoring, education, and continuous follow-up, the risks associated with long term anticoagulation are greatly reduced. Hospital Initiative: Provide anticoagulated patients (no charge) with close monitoring, educational resources and dedicated expertise to prevent adverse outcomes, reduction of hospital encounters related to over anticoagulation or under anticoagulation.

201611349349305221,430653493,"Part VI, Line 2:","Separate Community Health Needs Assessments were conducted for Mercy Hospital St. Louis and Mercy Hospital Washington. MERCY HOSPITAL ST. LOUISWho Was Involved in the Assessment At the center of involvement in the needs assessment were the people of the community. In April of 2010 and again in October of 2011, Mercy held roundtable events to dialogue directly with local community members about their needs, ideas, and concerns related to health care. Common themes included the need for a greater emphasis on wellness and prevention, education, and access. Barriers identified included economic/financial resources by some, access to physicians and services, and general apathy for good health. A focus on partnerships, education, and technology were cited as ways to improve health and wellness in the community. Mercy also heard that a focus on children in the community is essential, promoting healthy habits at an early age. Follow-up roundtables are held annually.To continue the dialogue begun at the community roundtable events, online community advisory panels were formed. These individuals are routinely surveyed to assess need, evaluate program/service ideas and provide feedback. Members are continuously added to the advisory panel. New MyMercy users are invited to join the group and a public invitation/form is located on the Mercy.net website.Mercy's Planning & Research Department provided internal and external demographic, utilization, chronic condition, and health status data. The consulting group Sg2 was also engaged by Mercy as a partner to analyze current utilization and future demand for health care services. Professional Research Consultants (PRC) assists Mercy in measuring patient satisfaction through personal phone calls and email surveys.The St. Louis County Department of Health (SLCDH) serves as the primary community partner for Mercy Hospital St. Louis in both the CHNA and community health improvement plan (CHIP) processes. SLCDH is utilizing the Mobilizing Action through Planning and Partnerships (MAPP) model, bringing hospitals and agencies across St. Louis County together in a collaborative process. MHSL also works closely with the St. Louis Regional Health Commission who serves as a vital facilitator in bringing together key partners to address community need.Community health co-workers in the Mission department of MHSL coordinate the CHNA process as part of their community health and benefit responsibility. A Community Health Council is accountable for ensuring community benefit meets mission, compliance, and IRS guidelines. The council is led by the hospital president. Members include co-workers from finance, care management, philanthropy, Mercy Clinic - Mercy's integrated physician group, mission, and other key areas. The chief medical officer as well as a MHSL board member are also actively engaged members of the council. How the Assessment Was ConductedThe needs assessment process involved the following five steps to attain the full scope of the community's needs.1. Examine existing community health needs assessmentsThe needs assessment examination process included the collection and analysis of quantitative data available in community/public health resources. Mercy staff, supported by Saint Louis University Master of Public Health students, reviewed the following data:- St. Louis County - 2011 Community Health Needs AssessmentIn December 2010, the St. Louis County Department of Health contracted with the University of New England's Center for Community and Public Health (CCPH) to conduct a countywide CHNA that included an extensive report with data broken down by sub-county regions. The assessment was released at the county's first Public Health Summit in December 2011. - Progress Toward Building a Healthier St. Louis - 2011 Access to Care ReportSt. Louis Regional Health CommissionEach year Mercy's JFK Health Center is cited throughout the report as a major provider of care for the uninsured and underinsured in our region.- Decade Review of Health Status for St. Louis City and County 2000-2010St. Louis Regional Health CommissionThis report focuses on change over the past decade in fourteen leading health indicators and disparity metrics in St. Louis City and County.- County Health RankingsThis is a new resource that was unveiled in March 2010. It is county-level data that will be updated annually by the University of Wisconsin-Population Health Institute and the Robert Wood Johnson Foundation. www.countyhealthrankings.org- Community Data Profiles & Missouri Information for Community Assessment (MICA) Missouri Department of Health & Senior Services-Bureau of Health Informatics This resource provides some of the best community health assessment planning tools available including community data profiles on 115 Missouri counties, thirty health indicators, and the capability to create customized tables.http://health.mo.gov/data/CommunityDataProfiles/index.html- 2012 Children's Mental Health & Substance Abuse Services Needs Assessment for St. Louis CountySt. Louis Children's Service FundThis resource identifies the characteristics of met and unmet mental health needs, service gaps, utilization and capacity, and the barriers to utilization of mental health and substance abuse services.- Data provided by Mercy's Planning & Research DepartmentData from Mercy's internal records was used to assess the needs of the community. Community health assessment and planning is an ongoing process at Mercy. As community/public health data is released, plans and programming are adjusted.2. Obtain qualitative information from community membersIn an effort to dialogue directly with the community and include qualitative data, input from community residents, individuals served by Mercy and also those with expertise in public health were included through:- Community roundtable events- Online surveys- SLCDH focus groups - SLCDH provider interviews- SLCDH household telephone surveys3. Analyze and summarize the data to prioritize needsHealth Needs IdentifiedThe St. Louis County Department of Health's 2011 Community Health Needs Assessment Report was a key deliverable in the initial phase of the MAPP process. The report not only provides data for the entire county, but further subdivides the county into four study regions: Mid, North, South and West. While continuing to participate in the MAPP process, Mercy's Community Health and Benefit staff reviewed this report, along with other available data, and identified community health needs critical for Mercy Hospital St. Louis to address that align with Mercy's mission and community master plan. Public health data for lifestyle issues such as obesity, tobacco use, and substance abuse paralleled with internal hospital data. Age-adjusted cancer incidence rates in St. Louis County for colon, breast, and prostate cancers, although declining over a ten year period, remain higher than rates reported for the state of Missouri. Cardiac-related disease, diabetes, and asthma, along with those seeking treatment for behavioral health needs, remain critical issues when assessing the health of St. Louis County. Lack of prevention strategies and poor behavioral choices continue to contribute to decreased quality of life, avoidable hospital admissions, and higher health care costs.St. Louis County also has several underlying socio-demographic characteristics that impact the health of its population and cannot be ignored. The county has what is described as an ""aging population."" Older populations utilize more health services creating increased access demands on the health system. Another significant finding is variation at the sub-county level in income, employment status, and health outcomes. North County, for example, reports significantly lower income levels, higher unemployment, increased risk factors, and overall poorer health outcomes. Disparities such as these must be taken into account when addressing community need and creating health improvement plans.See Part VI, Question 2 Continuation"

In active pursuit of this mission, MHEC provided services to 48,547 inpatients, 124,356 emergency room visits, 1,131,813 outpatient visits, 90,491 home health visits and 210,831 clinic visits.MHEC is a Catholic health care corporation that, pursuant to the organizational core belief that health care services are a vital and integral part of the Church's healing mission, engages in a ministry which provides general acute care, ambulatory, long-term and home care health services to individuals and families in its service communities. Consistent with the organization's commitment to social accountability and the provision of community benefit, MHEC offers other services and programs which further health promotion, maintenance and care. MHEC's services include two clinics which were established specifically for individuals who are uninsured or underinsured and do not have a means to pay for healthcare services. These clinics provide a significant focus on prenatal care. Many clinic patients were also treated, on a charitable basis, as inpatients. In response to the increased needs of the underinsured in the St. Louis area, these clinics have continually expanded, offering new services to more patients. The institution continues to focus on the provision of primary health services and education to the community, regardless of their means to pay for these services. The organization also has a continuing commitment to health research and to health education at all levels.Although reimbursement for services rendered is critical to the continued ability to provide healthcare services to all patients, MHEC recognizes that not all individuals possess the ability to purchase essential medical services and, further, that part of our mission is to provide healthcare services and healthcare education to the communities in which our facilities are located. In keeping with MHEC's commitment to serve all members of the communities it serves, MHEC provides (i) free care and/or subsidized care; (ii) care to persons covered by governmental programs at below cost; (iii) health activities and programs to support the community; (iv) health education programs; and, (v) a variety of broad community support activities. Open Medical StaffMedical staff privileges are extended to all qualified physicians in the community for almost all departments. Both hospitals have exclusive contracts with physician groups for radiology and pathology services. MHSL also has neonatology and CV surgery and MHW has cardiology and obstetrics. This means that over 90% of the physicians on staff are in categories that are open to qualified physicians in the community.Use of Surplus FundsSurplus funds and unrestricted assets held by Mercy Health East Communities are reinvested in patient care, medical education and research initiatives which support the organization's mission to deliver compassionate care and exceptional health care services to the communities it serves. Examples include the following: - A new innovative therapy center in St. Charles County equipped to serve children of all ages and abilities. Services offered include physical therapy, occupational therapy, speech pathology services, Autism-related programs, social communication groups and an exterior therapeutic playground- A Low Risk Birthing Center on site at Mercy Hospital St. Louis- Continued funding of the Mercy Health East Communities Research Institute which is dedicated to improving patient outcomes by supporting new and potentially life-changing health research including over 100 active clinical trials at Mercy Hospital St. Louis.- Continued funding of graduate medical education program (provides residency training in family medicine, internal medicine, OB/Gyn, dental medicine, orthopedics and critical care) and schools of radiology, respiratory and clinical laboratory science. Additional Community Health Initiative/InformationMany of the programs mentioned below are part of our current Community Health Impact Plan (CHIP). These are indicated by asterisks.A few examples include the Adopt-a-Family programs at Mercy Hospital St. Louis and Mercy Hospital Washington. Co-workers provided personal and household gifts to over 430 individuals and families in need over the holidays and MHSL Nutrition Services department cooked numerous turkeys for a church that fed nearly 300 people at Thanksgiving. Numerous collection drives by co-workers are held throughout the year and the items such as food, clothing, personal care items, bus passes, gas cards, school supplies and other critical items are donated to non-profit agencies to distribute to their clients. PHYSICIANSMercy Health System has a large number of clinics, physician offices and other healthcare facilities located in the East Community that are not associated with a hospital EIN. These clinics and facilities provide financial assistance, participate in health professions education (i.e. student shadowing) and provide in-kind contributions to their communities. The total community benefit that cannot be reported for these activities in FY15 is $15,577,660.MERCY NEIGHBORHOOD MINISTRY (MNM)Mercy Neighborhood Ministry is a department that supports the service areas of Mercy Hospital St. Louis, Mercy Hospital Washington and the surrounding counties. It focuses on connecting the economically underserved with appropriate health and social services as well as overall community health and access through promotion and education of current programs. MNM partners with over 100 community health and social service agencies, clinics, churches and schools. Nearly half of its annual expenses are offset through Mercy Foundation. JFK & McAULEY HEALTH CENTERSThese health centers offer comprehensive health care to a diverse population of over 10,000 patients who are economically disadvantaged, uninsured or underinsured. With more than 60,000 patient visits each year, services include medical, obstetrical, gynecological and pediatric care and access to specialty care, behavioral health including counseling and treatment, discounted pharmacy services, and vision and dental care. The charity care and unreimbursed cost of Medicaid community benefit figures for these entities are included in the overall Charity Care for MHEC and not listed separately. The work of these Mercy providers who serve those who are struggling in our community are not described in any area of this report.ACCESS TO CARECOMMUNITY REFERRAL COORDINATOR*Mercy continues to partner with the St. Louis Integrated Health network (IHN) in providing a contracted Community Referral Coordinator (CRC) in the MHSL emergency room to connect discharged patients with needed follow-up medical care. The CRC primarily focuses on Medicaid and uninsured patients:- In ensuring they have access to a primary care home and health resources regardless of their ability to pay- Reduce non-emergent use of emergency departments and low acuity readmissions- Enhance continuity of care- Strengthen communications/processes among hospital, safety net and other primary care providers, and community social services agencies/programs.The position is funded by the IHN and is a collaborative program between Mercy, the IHN and other area hospitals and clinics to improve access, quality and transitions of care. Each year the Mercy CRC helps more than 1,000 patients and refers more than 500 to primary care providers with a show-rate of 60%.CERTIFIED APPLICATION COUNSELORS*Since the beginning of Open Enrollment through the Affordable Care Act in August 2013, Mercy has helped those in need of affordable health insurance to enroll in plans and/or educate them about their options. This coverage assistance program has been entirely funded through Missouri Foundation for Health grants and was available in the service areas of MHSL, MHW and beyond. Enrollments to-date total nearly 600 and the CACs have attended hundreds of events resulting in educational opportunities in understanding the terminology and usage of health insurance.DENTAL CARE*In an effort to address the lack of dental care in their area, Mercy Hospital Washington opened a dental clinic in their McAuley Health Center in 2013 and expanded in 2015. Adult and pediatric patients are now receiving consistent, quality dental services as part of their overall treatment plan. To-date, this program has been funded by a variety of grants.See Part VI, Question 5 continuation"

There are also many other hospitals, universities, schools, churches and religious groups, and health and social service agencies, including a strong department of health. Additionally, the St. Louis Regional Health Commission is involved with the business community through the Business Health Coalition. County government, Civic Progress, and a variety of other community groups and forums serve as catalysts for community development and improvement.Summaries: Assessments and PrioritiesTo set priorities, criteria focused on identifying disproportionate unmet need, primary prevention strategies, advancements toward a continuum of care and a program that is collaborative and involves the community. The following priority needs were identified: Access to Care Mental Health & Substance Abuse Health Literacy/Lifestyle Issues Tobacco Use/Chronic Disease Injuries - Intentional & Unintentional4. Review community benefit activities in placeUsing Lyon Software's CBISA tool, a review will be conducted of current community benefit activities and what Mercy is presently doing to meet identified priorities. In addition, the community benefit activity of others in the community will be reviewed. 5. Create an action planMercy Hospital St. Louis will continue to partner with the St. Louis County Department of Health and area hospitals/agencies to develop a Community Health Improvement Plan. Hospital representatives will participate on appropriate action teams that are being formed during the summer of 2013 as a result of the SLCDH's MAPP process. MHSL's Community Health Council will oversee, guide, and support Mercy's involvement in this collaborative approach. The implementation plan was posted November 2013.MERCY HOSPITAL WASHINGTONWho Was Involved in the Assessment At the center of involvement in the needs assessment were the people of the community. In 2010 and again in 2011, Mercy held roundtable events to dialogue directly with local community members about their needs, ideas, and concerns relating to health care. Common themes included community members wanting to see greater access to health care services through traditional and non-traditional delivery systems as well as more focus on prevention and wellness. Also mentioned were the importances of families living in poverty in the region, the sluggish economy, physician shortages/access to care, and lack of focus on prevention/wellness/healthy lifestyles among many. Follow-up roundtables are held annually.To continue the dialogue begun at the community roundtable events, online community advisory panels were formed. These individuals are routinely surveyed to assess need, evaluate program/service ideas, and provide feedback. Members are continuously added to the advisory panel. New MyMercy users are invited to join the group and a public invitation/form is located on the Mercy.net website.Mercy's Planning & Research Department provided internal and external demographic, utilization, chronic condition, and heath status data. The consulting group Sg2 was also engaged by Mercy as a partner to analyze current utilization and future demand for health care services. Professional Research Consultants (PRC) assists Mercy in measuring patient satisfaction through personal phone calls and email surveys.The Franklin County Area United Way serves as the primary community partner for MHW in both the CHNA and community health improvement plan processes.The vice president of mission at MHW and community health co-workers at Mercy Hospital St. Louis coordinate the CHNA as part of their community health and benefit responsibility. A Community Health Council is accountable for ensuring community benefit meets mission, compliance, and IRS guidelines. The council is led by the hospital president. Members include co-workers from finance, care management, philanthropy, Mercy Clinic - Mercy's integrated physician group, mission, and other key areas. A MHW board member also serves on the council. How the Assessment Was ConductedThe needs assessment process involved the following five steps to attain the full scope of the community's needs.1. Examine existing community health needs assessmentsThe needs assessment examination process included the collection and analysis of quantitative data available in community/public health resources. Mercy staff, supported by Saint Louis University Master of Public Health students, reviewed the following data:- 2012 Franklin County Community AssessmentConducted by the United Way of Greater St. Louis- Community Data Profiles & Missouri Information for Community Assessment (MICA) Missouri Department of Health & Senior Services-Bureau of Health Informatics This resource provides some of the best community health assessment planning tools available including community data profiles on 115 Missouri counties, thirty health indicators, and the capability to create customized tables.http://health.mo.gov/data/CommunityDataProfiles/index.html- County Health RankingsThis is a new resource that was unveiled in March 2010. It is county level data that will be updated annually by the University of Wisconsin-Population Health Institute and the Robert Wood Johnson Foundation.www.countyhealthrankings.org- Data provided by Mercy's Planning & Research DepartmentData from Mercy's internal records was used to assess the needs of the community. Community health assessment and planning is an ongoing process at Mercy. As community/public health data is released, plans and programming are adjusted. 2. Obtain qualitative information from community membersIn an effort to dialogue directly with the community and include qualitative data, input from community residents, individuals served by Mercy, and also those with expertise in public health were included through:- Community roundtable events- Online surveys- Written survey tool- Interviews3. Analyze and summarize the data to prioritize needsHealth Needs IdentifiedThe 2012 Franklin County Community Assessment identified fourteen health and human service issues and ranked them in order of importance. Mercy's Community Health and Benefit staff reviewed this information, along with other data collected, and identified community health needs critical for Mercy Hospital Washington to address that align with Mercy's mission and community master plan. Public health data for lifestyle issues such as obesity rates, tobacco use, drug/alcohol use, and accident/domestic violence rates paralleled with internal hospital utilization data. Cardiac-related and other chronic diseases such as diabetes and asthma, along with those seeking treatment for behavioral health needs, remain critical issues when assessing the health of Franklin County. Also noted in MHW's top ED visit volume by ICD9 codes is the high prevalence in ""unspecified disorder of the teeth"". This diagnosis represented 678 cases, 2% of the total ED volume. Community Assets IdentifiedAlthough Mercy is the only hospital in Franklin County, there are a number of organizations, such as the Franklin County Area United Way, Service Provider Group, and the Children's Services Fund that meet monthly to share resources and work together on community needs/issues. The schools, churches, and businesses in the area are also actively engaged in community improvement projects.Summaries: Assessments and PrioritiesTo set priorities, criteria focused on identifying disproportionate unmet need, primary prevention strategies, advancements toward a continuum of care, and programs that are collaborative and involve the community. The following priority needs for Mercy Hospital Washington were identified: Access to Care* Mental Health & Substance Abuse Health Literacy/Lifestyle Issues Tobacco Use/Chronic Disease** Injuries - Intentional & Unintentional*With high volumes of potentially avoidable ED visits related to urinary tract infections, headache, otitis media, and unspecified dental issues, urgent care/fast track, and dental access options will be explored. ** With a smoking prevalence rate of 28% for Franklin County (national benchmark is 13%), tobacco use as it relates to chronic disease will likely be a focus when developing MHW's health improvement plan.See Part VI, Question 2 continuation"

The University of Miami Hospital and Anne Bates Leach Eye Hospital are reimbursed under the Medicare Prospective Payment System (PPS). For inpatient services, the reimbursement methodology is the Inpatient Prospective Payment System (IPPS), which uses the Diagnostic Related Groups (DRGS) methodology to reimburse the hospital. The DRG amounts are updated by the Medicare program annually by an updating factor. However, the amount of the updating factor is always significantly less than the actual healthcare inflation factor because the Medicare program includes a ""budget neutrality"" factor for the overall Medicare program. Thus, the hospital does not receive full reimbursement of its cost for inpatient services. For outpatient services, the reimbursement methodology is the Outpatient Prospective Payment System (OPPS), which uses ambulatory payment classifications (APCS) to reimburse the hospital. The APC amounts are updated by the Medicare program annually by an updating factor. However, the amount of the updating factor is always significantly less than the actual healthcare inflation factor because the Medicare program includes a ""budget neutrality"" factor for the overall Medicare program. Thus, the hospital does not receive full reimbursement for its cost for outpatient services. The University of Miami Hospital and Clinics is a cancer specialty hospital and, as such, is cost based reimbursed for both inpatient and outpatient services. For inpatient services, the limit is the TEFRA target limit. The hospital, on occasion, exceeds the target rate and does not receive full cost reimbursement. The TEFRA target amount is updated by the Medicare program annually by the TEFRA updating factor. However, the amount of the TEFRA updating factor is always significantly less than the actual healthcare inflation factor because the Medicare program includes a ""budget neutrality"" factor for the overall Medicare program. For outpatient services, the limit is the payment to cost ratio (PCR). The PCR was established using a base year, which was 1996, at a rate of 85.5% of cost. The PCR for all exempt cancer centers was 89% through 12/31/14, and then 90% from 1/1/15 to 5/31/15; therefore, the hospital currently does not receive payment for a range of 9% to 10% of its outpatient cost."

Events included an open house for the community to participate in the free diabetes support group, which included a nutrition class, medication management, along with community awareness of Diabetes World Day. Our dietician conducted a class at a local senior center on diabetes with 45 in attendance. A cooking class was held at a local food pantry to educate the members on how to cook healthy with food provided by the pantry; six individuals attended the class. During Diabetic Alert Day the hospital partnered with the YMCA and conducted diabetes risk assessments and glucose tests for more than 100 patrons at three different sites in the community. The community was eager to learn how to improve their health. With diabetes being a priority need, HSHS St Elizabeth's routinely provided education about diabetes at health fairs and started an outpatient diabetic education program for the community. The diabetes support group continues to meet twice a week which includes an education and exercise component to each free class. Classes average approximately 10-15 for each class. Other Community Benefit Activities and Programs Breast Health Awareness: October is Breast Health Awareness month. Annually, HSHS St. Elizabeth's Hospital works to enhance community awareness and connect with civic and community leaders in an effort to educate and raise awareness of the importance of breast health. In FY2015, the cities of Belleville and O'Fallon announced a proclamation of Breast Health Awareness month. The hospital partnered with the local newspaper and area businesses to promote a ""Pink Passion Spa Night"" and a Community Health Fair. The events, which took place at St. Elizabeth's Hospital and the O'Fallon Medical Office Building invited guests to learn about breast and women's health in a warm and comforting environment. Pink Passion Spa Night event included bra fittings, wig and skin care information, prosthetic information, chair massages, women's physical therapy, nutrition information, breast health information and on-site bone density screenings and mammogram appointment scheduling. A radiologist and a surgeon were present to answer questions. In addition, a member of the Illinois Breast and Cervical Cancer program was present to share information about their programs for qualified individuals. Approximately 100 women participated in the events. The Community Health Fair included Breast Health Information, Mammography scheduling, Bone Density screenings, Cardiac and stroke information, Blood Pressure and BMI screenings, Diabetes Information with a Diabetes Risk Assessment, and an on demand Glucose Screening. Heart Health Awareness: Annually St. Elizabeth's conducts a variety of events to educate and inform the public about ways to live a healthy and happy life. This year was especially important as we engaged our community partners and hosted an event in the community. Members of St. Elizabeth's and the YMCA of Southwest Illinois organized an event where people naturally gather. St. Elizabeth's welcomed the opportunity to work with the YMCA. We advertised using social media, a press release, and newspaper advertisements while the YCMA used in-house media in anticipation of the ""Healthy Heart, Healthy You"" event. St. Elizabeth's colleagues greeted 60 guests at the door and invited them to participate in the different activities. The primary activity was the American Heart Association Risk Assessment. The risk assessment is a tool used to measure one's risk for developing cardiovascular disease. Forty persons had their blood pressure, blood glucose and cholesterol screenings performed. One young woman with an exceedingly high blood pressure warranted follow-up with her physician. She was extremely grateful for the screening. The nurses performed height and weight measurement to calculate the individual's Body Mass Index (BMI). Then using all the data, a cardiac nurse reviewed the guest's risk assessment and provided an individualized improvement plan for each participant to help them live a healthier life. Dr. Paban Saha, an interventional cardiologist, met with fifteen (15) individuals and conducted an educational talk on the high-level procedures performed ""close to home."" He was accompanied by his first cardiac ablation patient at St. Elizabeth's. Dr. Saha also discussed cardiac disease and related risk factors. Cardiac education extended to three assisted living facilities and Sam's Club. More than 150 persons learned about cardiac risk factors, early signs of heart attacks, and the importance of calling emergency services versus driving oneself to the hospital. The seniors were surprised to learn how quickly emergency cardiac care begins when one calls an ambulance! The February topic at Programs and Services for Older Persons focused on food choices related to cardiac disease. Using an engaging format, a Registered Dietitian quizzed 50 seniors on food selection and offered them cardiac friendly options. Pregnancy Loss Support Group: The Share Program: Pregnancy loss affects families of all races, all socioeconomic groups, and all ages. It is important to for those who experience pregnancy or infant loss to be supported and surrounded by those who understand the devastating emotional, physical, and long lasting effects pregnancy loss creates. Unfortunately, in the community served by St. Elizabeth's Hospital, support for grieving families has been limited. Share is a pregnancy and infant loss program dedicated to supporting mothers and families experiencing this heartbreaking tragedy. Two colleagues on the Obstetrics unit embraced the challenge of establishing a Share Chapter at St. Elizabeth's to help support those facing loss during a period of life that is usually exciting and celebrated-the birth of a child. Establishing a Share chapter requires extensive training and ongoing dedication to the program. HSHS St Elizabeth's serves as the chapter leader for this organization in our community. Mothers have been contacting the nurses expressing interest in attending our initial meetings. One mother continues to grieve the loss of her infant who died more than 50 years ago. She was eager to attend our Share group to help her work through her ongoing grief. She is one of many women seeking assistance to cope with this painful experience."

We recognize we are most successful when we work together with a wide array of public and private organizations that share our commitment to improving lives. By doing so, we maximize our efforts and reduce the duplication of services. HSHS hospitals also understand we need to listen closely to the residents of the communities we serve to ensure the health care needs of all are being met. To that end, 13 of our hospitals completed Community Health Needs Assessments (CHNAs) in FY2015 and in FY2012. HSHS St. Clare Memorial Hospital in Oconto Falls, Wisconsin, who affiliated with HSHS in September 2015, completed their CHNA in FY2014. The information gathered from these assessments is being used to develop new, and enhance existing, programs and services that best address the needs of the community. Several priority needs were identified in the FY2015 CHNAs including mental health; chronic disease prevention and management; alcohol, tobacco and other drug abuse; nutrition/wellness; access to care; oral health; and domestic abuse. HSHS hospitals are addressing these and other needs by proactively offering educational opportunities, preventative screenings, and new or enhanced clinical services. In many cases, the hospitals collaborate with other hospital facilities, local departments of public health and community organizations to address identified needs. In western Wisconsin, HSHS Sacred Heart Hospital in Eau Claire and HSHS St. Joseph's Hospital in Chippewa Falls are taking the lead on programming to educate the public about mental health issues and treatment, the stigma associated with mental health, and the recognition of mental health issues. To combat the rising rate of suicides in the area, both hospitals are providing community education sessions on QPR (Question, Persuade and Refer), an evidence-based suicide prevention program. In addition, the hospitals hosted sessions to train community members to become Certified QPR Trainers. In southern Illinois, HSHS St Elizabeth's Hospital in Belleville also identified suicide as a priority community health need. In response, the hospital in cooperation with the local county mental board offered QPR to educate the community about how to identify and talk to someone who may be considering suicide. In addition, St Elizabeth's mental health counselors provided free evaluations to assess for services or referred individuals to other local agencies for assistance. They also provided telephone assistance to individuals with mental health questions. In FY2015, the counselors screened more than 300 clients and fielded more than 1,000 calls. HSHS St. Vincent Hospital in Green Bay developed the Sexual Assault Nurse Examiner (SANE) program comprised of 11 nurses and a medical director to provide care for anyone who has been sexually assaulted. Begun in 1992, St. Vincent's SANE program is the regional site for such care, one where all the hospitals in Green Bay and the surrounding communities send sexual assault victims. St. Vincent's SANE nurses have been properly trained to conduct the medical examination, collect evidence, treat injury and provide courtroom testimony. In FY2015, SANE served more than 185 individuals at a vulnerable and devastating time of their lives. HSHS St. Mary's Hospital in Streator, Illinois teamed up with the Streator YMCA to offer a 12-week weight loss program - Healthy You - to motivate more than 284 participants. The program included aerobics classes, cooking classes, and a maintenance program to encourage participants to weigh in monthly. Surveys were collected at registration to quantify progress for repeat participants - 14 percent returned with a further weight loss and 9 percent within 5 pounds of their 2014 weight. In FY2015, Healthy You participants collectively lost 2,982 pounds. In FY2015, HSHS St. Mary's Hospital in Decatur, Illinois partnered with Macon County Care Coordination (MCCC) comprised of the Macon County Health Board, Community Health Improvement Center, Decatur Memorial Hospital, Heritage Behavioral Health Center, and Macon County Health Department to provide a team approach to health care and behavioral health services for Medicaid recipients with chronic health conditions. In FY2015, a nurse practitioner was hired to lead the program and recruit physicians. Three teams consisting of a Registered Nurse, Care Navigator and Care Coordinator were hired to provide services. St. Mary's is in the final stages of the development of an interface with the Electronic Medical Record, and is working on fully integrating MCCC services into their Emergency Department and exploring possibilities of integrating MCCC within the HSHS Medical Group to provide care coordination for Medicaid recipients with chronic health conditions. According to the National Assessment of Adult Literacy, only 12 percent of adults have ""proficient"" health literacy, i.e. nine out of 10 adults lack the skills needed to manage their health. Health literacy was identified in the CHNA completed by HSHS St. Nicholas Hospital in Sheboygan and the Department of Public Health in FY2012. In FY2014, the Healthy Sheboygan County 2020 Health Literacy Committee hosted five focus groups (Hispanic, Hmong, low-income, senior citizens and young adults) and an Executive Briefing for health care leaders to share the results of the community survey and focus groups. In FY2015, with the support of St. Nicholas Hospital, a health literacy community awareness campaign was launched - Okay2Ask - to encourage people to build strong relationships with their health care providers and pharmacists."

In FY2015, HSHS hospitals and affiliated physician groups contributed more than $19 million toward research and education. Highlights of this commitment include subsidizing medical school residency programs, offering ongoing medical education to physicians and clinicians, and providing job shadowing programs for high school students. In southern Illinois, HSHS St. Joseph's Hospital in Breese, hosted members of the Health Occupations Students of America onsite to learn about job opportunities in health care from health care professionals. St. Joseph's also provided clinical experience for Kaskaskia College students enrolled in nursing, physical therapy and radiology programs. Pharmacy students have also completed their clinical training at St. Joseph's Hospital. In FY2015, 73 students were served by the program. In FY2015, HSHS St. Mary's Hospital Medical Center and HSHS St. Vincent Hospital in Green Bay invested more than $450,000 to provide onsite training and education of nurses and allied health professionals. In addition, the hospitals have been collaborating with the Medical College of Wisconsin to establish a community medical education program in Green Bay and to provide financial support to offset operating costs in FY2015. Also in eastern Wisconsin, HSHS St. Clare Memorial Hospital in Oconto Falls provided training for local paramedics and emergency response personnel through the hospital's EMS liaison program. In response to its FY2012 CHNA, HSHS St. John's Hospital in Springfield, Illinois convened a team of health care providers in FY2015 to identify the practice gaps around metabolic syndrome in children and adults and to research best practices and evidence-based protocols to reduce the progression of metabolic syndrome. The team developed and implemented a three-part multidisciplinary discussion on preventing childhood obesity entitled ""Childhood Obesity in Central Illinois: Weighing in on the Problem,"" which was offered during grand rounds. In addition, the team hosted a Continuing Medical Education program for the community entitled ""Restoring Healthy Families and Communities in an Obesongenic Environment: A Tool Kit for Health Care Professionals."" Mission-driven and strategically implemented Community Benefit is an integral part of Hospital Sisters Health System's Mission. Our commitment to Community Benefit arises from our Catholic identity, Mission and Core Values shared by 14,000 colleagues across Illinois and Wisconsin. Through our work to improve access to health care services, enhance community health, advance medical knowledge, and relieve or reduce the burden of government, we believe we have made a positive difference in the quality of lives of tens of thousands of people in Illinois and Wisconsin in FY2015. As a Catholic health care ministry, HSHS is concerned with the dignity of all persons, the common good, and the stewardship of resources. We advocate for health care for all and work to improve social conditions that lead to improved health and well-being. We engage partners in our communities to improve health and quality of life and to reduce duplication. Working side by side with many faith communities, HSHS remains dedicated to our common purpose of compassionate care for all people."

Up to three students receive two hours of supervised job training daily during the school year. Each student progresses through a three phase program. The hospital absorbs an increasing percentage of the cost as participants progress through the program. Bridges enhances this high risk population's ability to be productive members of our community. Food, clothing, and school supply drives; Elizabeth's Garden; and electronics recycling are conducted in collaboration with many local social agencies such as St Vincent DePaul, Catholic Urban Programs, BEACON ministries and local food pantries to meet the needs of the underserved and reduce the burden of government In FY2015, colleagues donated 70 baskets and an additional 500 pounds of food, more than 1,028 pounds of clothing, 200 pounds of school supplies and 260 pounds of fresh food to a variety of community social service agencies. Disaster Preparedness: HSHS St. Elizabeth's Hospital purchased a new Losberger MDS-three line mass casualty/decontamination shower shelter by Traube Tent. The shelter will be used for decontamination events and mass casualty events in our region. As a region leader in emergency preparedness, St. Elizabeth's provided crucial emergency equipment for our Region 4 EMS area. Having this advanced resource allows our community to be confident knowing that St. Elizabeth's will be ready to deploy and serve our community needs in any decontamination or mass casualty event that arises. HSHS St. Elizabeth's emergency response region includes a rural farming region, as well as a well-developed industrial region, where many hazardous risk events could potentially occur. In order to help prepare for such events, HSHS St. Elizabeth's Hospital conducts a Hazard Vulnerability Analysis each year to determine which potential hazards and risks could occur in our region; hazmat risk events remain in the top five of potential emergencies each year. During the EBOLA outbreak HSHS St. Elizabeth's took the lead for Region 4. With 8 counties and 19 hospitals in the region the hospital leadership stepped forward to address the EBOLA crisis and self-identified as an Assessing Hospital for the region. An Assessing Hospital receives and cares for patients that are suspect for EBOLA for up to 72 hours. This requires the purchase of personal protective equipment (PPE) for caregivers, extensive training, and development of policies and procedures for this highly contagious disease. It also requires inspection by the CDC. Currently 75 colleagues are trained and prepared for any infectious disease that may present. BASIC (Belleville Achieves Strength in Character) Initiative is a partnership of schools, the City of Belleville, and the business community to strengthen character in our youth and in the community. BASIC encourages youth and adults to be productive citizens in our community. Colleagues and the community start and end a ""character walk"" in the fall at the hospital. More than 20 hospital leaders participated in the annual event. St. Clair County Health Department Health Care Commission: HSHS St. Elizabeth's Hospital initiated practices that later became part of the health department when they formed in 1985. A member of St Elizabeth's participates in the Health Care Commission. The Health Care Commission, founded in 1991, is a 20 plus organization that serves as a public health system to establish priority health issues, mobilize resources to meet identified needs, and promote the health and well-being of the all-county residents. St Elizabeth's colleagues provided valuable feedback for the St Clair County Public Health Department's first ever accreditation process with the Illinois Department of Public Health. This year HSHS St Elizabeth's presented at the Health Policy Summit and demonstrated our collaboration with the community in the development of our CHNA. HSHS St Elizabeth's donated computers and laptops to local school districts; some schools were in low income areas of the community. Access to these computers can increase a child's educational experience thus addressing one of the social determinates of poverty. In FY2015 HSH St Elizabeth's donated $10,447 in computers based on fair market value. Franciscan Inspired Life Long Learning Program: HSHS St. Elizabeth's is committed to helping the poor and vulnerable by assisting individuals who seek to improve themselves through academic learning. Key members of hospital leadership met with the East Saint Louis vocational director, the director of the East St. Louis Community Center that houses both Kaskaskia College and Southwestern Illinois Community College, and the Kaskaskia College Dean of Nursing to discuss opportunities to partner for the goal of improving the lives of those living in impoverished areas. Through various programs St. Elizabeth's continues to commit to serve the poor and underserved in our community. This year, the Sister Agnes Franciscan Inspired Life Long Learning (FILL) program donated two hospital beds to the East St. Louis Vocational Technical Center. In order for the nursing assistants to complete their academic requirements they must complete clinical competencies. Unfortunately, they recently lost their clinical site, so St. Elizabeth's is in the process of securing a clinical affiliation agreement with them so the students can complete their clinical competencies at our hospital. All applicants can self-identify as a ""Franciscan Inspired Life Long Learning Program applicant"" for jobs posted on our website. Current colleagues participated in an onsite college fair to support their education goals. St. Elizabeth's joined East Side Aligned. Evan Krauss describes East Side Aligned as ""Collective Impact for children and youth within the Greater East St Louis that is led by the United Way."" We currently are part of two alignments teams; career pathways and healthcare. As a member of the health care strategy team, we are able to align our Community Health Needs assessment and partner with other agencies that have similar goals. For example, Eastside Health District has a grant sponsored by the CDC (Center of Disease Control) and WIC (Women, Infants, and Children) with a focus on policy change and increasing healthy foods in the area. We also participated in two health fairs during the ""40 days of Nonviolence sponsored by City of East St Louis and the Jackie Joyner Kersey Foundation. We provided education about diabetes and cardiac disease, performed blood pressure and glucose screens to a population at high risk for diabetes and heart disease. Also, we were the sole employer representative on the career pathways team at East St. Louis High School to attend the 60/25 Advance Illinois Conference in Aurora, Illinois in January. This initiative is focused on the goal of 60 percent of all working adults in the State of Illinois will hold a high-quality college credential by 2025. Several workshops were held throughout the conference focused on collective impact, various educational topics and employers' roles in advancing education in our communities throughout the State. Pregnancy Care Center: St Elizabeth's provides space and colleagues make donations to support the local pregnancy care center. At the pregnancy care center women receive confidential pregnancy testing and help for any and all circumstances."

Once verification of no coverage has been completed, the guarantors will be screened for charity or uninsured discounts based on income levels. Those guarantors that do not qualify for charity through the screening process will be asked to provide proof of income in the form of a recent pay stub and/or recent tax return to determine the level of uninsured discounting. If no proof of income is provided or a guarantor's income is greater than 201% of the federal poverty level, the appropriate discount according to the established criteria will be applied. The amount of money not collected from those self-pay patients who are not eligible for charity care is reported as bad debt. Allowances for Doubtful Accounts have been recorded based on an historical matrix, using collectability percentages by payor and aging category in accordance with HSHS Executive Policy #F-23, Valuation of Net Accounts Receivable. Percentages are based on historical experience at the hospital and adjusted for known limitations."

In addition, some care is not classified as charity because of missing documentation on patient resources. Thus, the hospital's bad debt includes a portion that could be classified as charity care if application for such care was sought and/or completed. Currently, the hospital is implementing processes, procedures and systems to more effectively determine charity care that will reduce a patient's documentation requirements and ease the patient's emotional burden in applying for charity care. This will provide a more accurate reporting of charity care services provided by the hospital."

Nonetheless, the Medicare program, in many cases, does not provide payment that covers the full cost of the care provided. Since it is the mission of the hospital to respond to community need, hospital management continually advocates for improved Medicare payment so that the cost of quality care to those patients who are not able to afford it is not compromised and is fairly subsidized by all payers. While this shortfall in Medicare payments is not classified as community benefit by the IRS, we nonetheless believe it is an important contribution made by the hospital to the health and well-being of the community. If the Medicare program did not exist, many Medicare patients would be eligible for charity care or other means-tested government programs. Further, by absorbing this payment shortfall and providing care below cost to these individuals, HSHS St Elizabeth's is relieving the burdens of the government. Accordingly, this shortfall restricts HSHS St Elizabeth's ability to make funds available to provide for charity care and other community benefits. The hospital Medicare shortfall at cost for fiscal year 2015 was $5,684,603."
201631339349306173,370663567,"Schedule H, Part III, Line 9b Collection practices for patients eligible for financial assistance","The hospital makes reasonable efforts to determine a patient's eligibility for the Financial Assistance Program before utilizing any extraordinary collection actions. Upon admission, a patient receives information about the Financial Assistance Program and how to fill out an application, along with a phone number to contact for further help. Inpatients that are uninsured and not eligible for Medicaid are given a Financial Assistance Application. Each patient will then receive a minimum of three bills with information on how to apply for Financial Assistance. Accounts of patients who have not responded to any of these inquiries will be recommended for bad debt. However, before submitting accounts to a collection agency, the guarantor is screened (using an external program) for charity qualification. If the guarantor qualifies for a full adjustment, the account is settled. We do offer a sliding scale discount for charity. If they qualify for less than 100%, the discount will be posted and the account transferred to the collection agency. The collection agency will do further screening based on their credit score and propensity to pay. Based on this screening, the collection agency may return the account with a recommendation of charity."

Engagement sessions were held and participants were invited based on their expertise and in their awareness of health care needs in the community. In previous years, the hospital assessed community need by working closely with the Health Department. Social accountability has always been a part of the hospital's mission. St. Elizabeth's assessed our top ten diagnoses and evaluated how we can impact care for these patient populations. Due to St. Elizabeth's close relationship with the St. Clair County Health Department, information and data were shared and addressed collectively. Provisions in the Affordable Care Act require charitable hospitals to conduct a CHNA and adopt implementation strategies to meet the needs identified.

At the time of registration, a brochure is provided to self-pay patients upon registration regarding the Financial Assistance Program available to them at HSHS St Elizabeth's. The brochures are also supplied in waiting and ancillary areas for easy access by the patient. The hospital has onsite advocates to assist patients with enrollment in several federal, state and local government programs. These advocates visit patients while in the hospital or contact them by phone once discharged. The advocates will also make home visits as needed in order to assist patient with enrollment as well as gathering necessary documents for application. We also offer an online business office portal that provides information on how to read and understand HSHS St Elizabeth's billing information. HSHS St Elizabeth's website provides an explanation of Medicare forms at www.steliz.org. Each statement that a patient receives contains information about our financial assistance program and a phone number for assistance with applying. Any patient visiting the onsite financial counselor as well as contacting us via phone is given information about payment options including our financial assistance options. Even after an account is sent to a collection agency and/or anytime in the process they believe a patient may be eligible for Financial Assistance, the account is returned to the hospital for evaluation. HSHS St. Elizabeth's makes their financial assistance application and standard response letters available in Spanish and English. Patients are also provided a Fair Billing Act notification at the point of registration regarding separate physician billing they can expect to receive, plus information about the patient's financial responsibility if their insurance plan is out of network. A system called Payment Navigator is now being utilized after failed attempts made by the hospital, but before sending to a collection agency. That system accesses credit and other information and allows us to see the probability of a patient being able to pay their bill. After assessing that information, the hospital makes a determination whether to grant charity care or continue collection efforts.

The hospital was founded more than 138 years ago to bring a healing presence and improve the health of our community, especially for those persons who are sick, poor, and disadvantaged. Because of the hospital's purpose and tradition, it is organized to promote the health of St Clair county and surrounding areas. The hospital is governed by a Board of Directors, at least a majority of whom reside in the hospital's primary service area and who are neither employees nor independent contractors of the hospital (nor family members thereof). The Board ensures that HSHS St Elizabeth's is responding to community need. In FY2015, for example, the Board reviewed the Community Health Needs Assessment and approved an Implementation Plan for addressing selected health focus areas. In addition the hospital's Advisory/Community Benefit Committee was instrumental in assisting with and identifying priority health needs in the community. The volunteer auxiliary group strongly advocates on behalf of the hospital within the community. Also consistent with its exempt purpose, HSHS St Elizabeth's has an open medical staff with privileges available to all qualified physicians in the area. In addition, the hospital operates an emergency department that is open 24 hours to all persons regardless of their ability to pay. As a not-for-profit hospital, HSHS St Elizabeth's reinvests surplus funds to support the mission of the organization and health of the community rather than distributing surplus funds as profits to shareholders or individuals. Funds not committed to ongoing operations are generally used to upgrade facilities, secure new technologies, improve patient care, and support initiatives designed to promote health and ensure access for all along with providing medical education and research. For example, St. Elizabeth's has a long history strategically planning for the future of healthcare in southern Illinois. On April 21, 2015, HSHS St. Elizabeth's Hospital received unanimous approval from the Illinois Health Facilities and Services Review Board (HFSRB) to begin construction on a new $300 million medical campus along Interstate 64 and Green Mount Road in St. Clair County. The Certificate of Need allows St. Elizabeth's to replace its current hospital, which was built in the 1950s, with a modern hospital that will be built on a 114-acre campus with an adjoining ambulatory care center. The new campus will enhance St. Elizabeth's ability to develop an integrated care delivery model that will serve residents from across Southwestern Illinois. The new St. Elizabeth's is designed for the future of health care delivery. The facility will include 144 private patient rooms, an emergency department, state-of-the art operating rooms, modern birthing suites, an advanced intensive care unit, and inpatient rehabilitation. The adjacent ambulatory care center will offer various outpatient services such as lab, imaging and therapy, and include medical office space for more than 100 physicians. The location of St. Elizabeth's replacement hospital will be centrally located for the patients of the southwestern Illinois region that it serves. It will also be closer to Scott Air Force Base and many of the community hospitals that refer patients to St. Elizabeth's. Through the addition of a Prairie Heart Institute's Electrophysiology (EP) Lab, HSHS St. Elizabeth's is the first hospital in the southwestern Illinois region to perform treatment of the entire spectrum of arrhythmias (an irregular heart beat) and cardiac implantable devices which greatly benefit patients with A-Fibrillation (A-Fib). The featured lab is outfitted with a low radiation dose BiPlane angio suite, a 50"" multi input display and a myriad of other moveable advanced technology systems. For patients who failed other forms of therapy for A-Fib, an ablation in our new EP lab can significantly improve quality of life. St. Elizabeth's. St. Elizabeth's has been named a Top 50 Cardiovascular hospital in the country by Truven Health Analytics for three consecutive years. The patient tracing system purchased for surgical services provides real time status updates for patients. Their loved ones can monitor their progress as they transition through the surgical services department. Family members and patients are extremely pleased knowing exactly where their loved one is in real time. HSHS St Elizabeth's also devotes significant resources to access for patients who cannot afford care, along with other community benefits. In fiscal year 2015, HSHS St Elizabeth's provided more than $16 million in Community Benefit services, including charity care at cost, unpaid costs of Medicaid and other public programs, and a range of diverse programs designed to enhance access and improve community health. Additionally, in fiscal year 2015, HSHS St Elizabeth's provided $13.5 million (at cost) in uncompensated care to patients who did not qualify for charity care or public assistance and more than $5.6 million (at cost) in excess of Medicare payment for health care services. HSHS St Elizabeth's provides a range of Community Benefit activities and programs that furthers our mission and long-standing commitment to our community. In many cases, these Community Benefit initiatives would not exist without the leadership role played by HSHS St Elizabeth's and they often relieve a burden that would otherwise be carried by government. The majority of the Community Benefit programs and activities provided in FY2015 are in response to the hospital's FY2012 Community Health Needs Assessment (CHNA). The FY2012 CHNA surfaced the following health focus areas to be addressed by the hospital in collaboration with other hospitals and community organizations: Access to healthcare, especially for those who are uninsured or underinsured: St Elizabeth's provided space and equipment for clients to enroll in the marketplace and in Medicaid. To increase the enrollment capacity, St Elizabeth's continued the partnership with Eastside Health District and added and funded personnel from Cardon Outreach to increase our enrollment ability. Eastside had reduced federal funding; however, they recognized the value of our partnership and provided an In Person Counselor (IPC) at St Elizabeth's once a week. During open enrollment the hospital sponsored two weekend enrollment events and expanded hours from 8 hours to 18 hours/day throughout the weekend. Clients appreciated these extended hours and Eastside experienced an increase in enrollment during these times. In addition Cardon's contract started in October 2014 and they began screening inpatients and outpatients, specifically the Emergency Department patients for Medicaid eligibility. During open enrollment Cardon added a community advocate who was present on campus to assist community members. Cardon continued to assess patients post-enrollment. St. Elizabeth's two prong approach: assessing inpatients and Emergency Department patients and also providing a resource for the community yielded very favorable results. These deliberate efforts to increase our community's access to healthcare were very successful. Our Medicaid enrollment increased 89%, from 135 enrollments to 1280 and marketplace enrollments increased by 77%; 10 enrollments to 45. Any patient screened who did not meet criteria was also screened for St Elizabeth's Financial Assistance Program."
201631339349306173,370663567,"Schedule H, Part VI, Line 6 Affiliated health care system","HSHS St. Elizabeth's Hospital is an affiliate of Hospital Sisters Health System (HSHS), a health care ministry that includes 14 hospitals, numerous community-based health centers and clinics, and hundreds of physician partners across Illinois and Wisconsin. The mission of HSHS is ""to reveal and embody Christ's healing love for all people through our high quality Franciscan health care ministry."" We live our mission by providing holistic healing to all who seek our care, as well as through Community Benefit. Working collaboratively with others in the communities we serve, our Community Benefit initiatives are strategically and successfully expanding access to care, improving the health status of residents, and increasing medical education and knowledge. In FY2015, our hospitals responded to needs identified in each of their most recent Community Health Needs Assessments (CHNAs) completed in FY2012. The information gathered from these assessments was used to develop or enhance Community Benefit programs and services to best address community health needs. Among the many priority needs identified in our CHNAs were chronic disease prevention and management, obesity, adequate food and nutrition, mental health, and access to health care services. HSHS hospitals are proactively addressing these and other needs through patient, provider and community education, preventative screenings, self-management classes, and new or enhanced clinical services. System-wide, HSHS collectively provided $195.3 million in Community Benefit (9.9% of total hospital expenses) in FY2015. This amount included $25.2 million provided for Financial Assistance (i.e. Charity Care) and $132.3 million for unreimbursed care provided as part of the Medicaid program. In addition, HSHS hospitals committed significant resources to care for Medicare patients. The cost of providing services to primarily elderly beneficiaries of the Medicare program - in excess of governmental and managed care contract payments - was $183.7 million. HSHS hospitals also recorded $61.5 million in uncollectible accounts. While HSHS does not count the latter two amounts as Community Benefit, they nonetheless reflect our commitment to all persons in need of care. In addition to the dollars invested in our Community Benefit programs, HSHS continues to reinvest any surplus revenue from operations and investments into new medical technology, facility infrastructure and health care services in our communities. By doing so, we ensure our ability to meet the ongoing demand for high quality, efficient and easily accessible health care. As the U.S. health care delivery model continues to evolve, HSHS remains focused on implementing our Care Integration strategy. Care Integration coordinates the delivery of care across the continuum to meet the needs of each patient. During FY2015, HSHS made significant progress with this strategy as we implemented additional interoperable health information technologies and strengthened our alignment with physicians. Improve access to health services As a Franciscan health care ministry, HSHS is deeply committed to serving those who are most in need with a special focus on the poor and vulnerable. We not only provide care to every patient who walks through our doors, but also reach out beyond the walls of our hospitals and clinics to care for those in our communities. Our efforts to ensure residents in the communities we serve receive the right care, at the right time, and in the right setting often involve partnering with others to achieve this goal. Across our two-state System, there are numerous examples of HSHS collaborating with other organizations to enhance access to care for those in need. In FY2015, HSHS and our 14 hospitals invested Community Benefit resources to educate the uninsured about new enrollment opportunities in affordable health care coverage and to facilitate the process. Studies have shown that people without insurance coverage are more likely than their insured counterparts to postpone care and to develop more severe and expensive conditions. It is for this reason that the Catholic Church, Catholic health care and HSHS have long promoted ""coverage and access for all."" HSHS and our 14 hospitals in partnership with local health departments, social service agencies and other health care providers played a vital role in educating eligible people in their local communities, by referring people to Certified Application Counselors and/or in enrolling them in the health insurance exchanges, or in securing coverage through Medicaid expansion. Of the eight states with the highest concentration of uninsured, Illinois was among 25 states that adopted Medicaid expansion under the Affordable Care Act. HSHS St. Mary's Hospital Medical Center in Green Bay supports the NEW Community Clinic, a 38-year-old free health center for the uninsured and underinsured, and also provides free and discounted laboratory and radiology services to the clinic. More than 70 percent of patients indicate the care they received at the clinic prevented a trip to the emergency department. This year St. Mary's Hospital, along with sister hospital HSHS St. Vincent Hospital in Green Bay, provided more than $100,000 to support acute care clinic operations at their Northeast Wisconsin Technical College location, as well as funds to support operating costs associated with the oral surgeon's services at the dental clinic. HSHS St. Francis Hospital in Litchfield, Illinois partnered with Lewis & Clark Community College and local dental providers to bring the College's mobile dental health unit to the Litchfield area; the unit provides free or low cost dental exams and screenings, x-rays and hygiene services. The percentage of total emergency department visits related to dental issues has decreased from 2.2 percent in 2011 to 1.27 percent in 2014 as a result of these collaborative efforts to provide the right care in the right setting. In southeast Illinois, area residents can get help filling a prescription through the long-term collaboration between HSHS St. Anthony's Memorial Hospital in Effingham and Catholic Charities. In FY2015, St. Anthony's helped underwrite the cost of prescription medications for 312 residents. St. Anthony's and Catholic Charities believe that no one should be without prescription medications because of the inability to pay. In southwest Illinois, HSHS St. Joseph's Hospital in Highland enhanced their offerings to their senior population based on their CHNA. ""Senior Renewal"" is an outpatient counseling program for senior adults who may be facing emotional and physical problems unique to the aging process such as feelings of loneliness, isolation and anxiety. Clients receive a comprehensive level of treatment without inpatient hospitalization through counseling strategies and education. In addition, St. Joseph's Hospital in collaboration with the Illinois Department of Insurance participates in the Senior Health Insurance Program (SHIP), a free health insurance counseling service for Medicare beneficiaries and their caregivers. In addition to programs designed to increase access to care, HSHS makes sure that those who need financial assistance receive it. HSHS's Financial Assistance (Charity Care) policy was modified effective January 1, 2014 to offer a 25 percent self-pay discount to all patients who register without insurance. HSHS Financial Assistance programs have a sliding scale, in some instances providing up to a 55 percent reduction off billed charges if an uninsured patient's family income level is determined to be above 500 percent but equal to our less than 600 percent of the current Federal Poverty Guidelines. All charges are waived for patients below 200 percent of the Federal Poverty Levels. Counselors are available in our hospitals to explain our financial assistance policy to patients, provide them with assistance in filling out a simple application form, or help them enroll in publicly funded health care programs."

SATISFYING THE ""COMMUNITY BENEFIT STANDARD,"" AS ARTICULATED BY THE INTERNAL REVENUE SERVICE (IRS) IN REVENUE RULING 69-545, IS CURRENTLY REQUIRED FOR A HOSPITAL TO BE RECOGNIZED AS A CHARITABLE ORGANIZATION UNDER INTERNAL REVENUE CODE (IRC) 501(C)(3). THIS RULING REMOVED THE PREVIOUS REQUIREMENT OF REVENUE RULING 56-185, KNOWN AS THE ""CHARITY CARE STANDARD,"" THAT IN ORDER TO BE A CHARITABLE ORGANIZATION, A HOSPITAL HAD TO PROVIDE, TO THE EXTENT OF ITS FINANCIAL ABILITY, FREE OR REDUCED-COST CARE TO PATIENTS UNABLE TO PAY FOR THEIR CARE. THIS EARLIER RULING EMPHASIZED THAT A LOW LEVEL OF CHARITY CARE DID NOT MEAN THAT A HOSPITAL WAS NOT CHARITABLE SINCE THAT LEVEL COULD REFLECT THE HOSPITAL'S FINANCIAL ABILITY TO PROVIDE SUCH CARE. REVENUE RULING 56-185 ALSO NOTED THAT PUBLICLY SUPPORTED COMMUNITY HOSPITALS WOULD NORMALLY QUALIFY AS CHARITABLE BECAUSE THEY SERVE THE ENTIRE COMMUNITY AND A LOW LEVEL OF CHARITY CARE WOULD NOT IMPACT A HOSPITAL'S CHARITABLE STATUS IF IT WAS DUE TO THE SURROUNDING COMMUNITY'S LACK OF CHARITABLE DEMANDS. REVENUE RULING 69-545 INVOLVED A HOSPITAL THAT ONLY ADMITTED THOSE WHO COULD PAY FOR THE SERVICES EITHER BY THEMSELVES, THROUGH PRIVATE INSURANCE OR PUBLIC PROGRAMS SUCH AS MEDICARE. IN ADDITION, THE HOSPITAL OPERATED A FULL-TIME EMERGENCY ROOM THAT WAS OPEN TO EVERYONE. THE IRS RULED THAT THE HOSPITAL WAS CHARITABLE BECAUSE IT PROMOTED THE HEALTH OF PEOPLE IN ITS COMMUNITY. THE IRS REASONED THAT BECAUSE THE PROMOTION OF HEALTH WAS CHARITABLE PURPOSE ACCORDING TO THE GENERAL LAW OF CHARITY, IT FELL WITHIN THE ""GENERALLY ACCEPTED LEGAL SENSE"" OF THE TERM CHARITABLE, AS REQUIRED BY TREASURY REGULATION SECTION 1.501(C)(3)-1(D)(2). THE IRS RULED THAT THE PROMOTION OF HEALTH, LIKE RELIEF OF POVERTY AND THE ADVANCEMENT OF EDUCATION AND RELIGION, IS ONE OF THE PURPOSES OF THE GENERAL LAW OF CHARITY THAT IS DEEMED BENEFICIAL TO THE COMMUNITY AS A WHOLE EVEN THOUGH THE CLASS OF BENEFICIARIES ELIGIBLE TO RECEIVE A DIRECT BENEFIT FROM ITS ACTIVITIES DOES NOT INCLUDE ALL MEMBERS OF THE COMMUNITY, SUCH AS INDIGENT MEMBERS OF THE COMMUNITY, PROVIDED THAT THE CLASS IS NOT SO SMALL THAT ITS RELIEF IS NOT OF BENEFIT TO THE COMMUNITY. THE IRS CONCLUDED THAT THE HOSPITAL WAS ""PROMOTING THE HEALTH OF A CLASS OF PERSONS THAT IS BROAD ENOUGH TO BENEFIT THE COMMUNITY"" BECAUSE ITS EMERGENCY ROOM WAS OPEN TO ALL AND IT PROVIDED CARE TO THOSE WHO COULD PAY, WHETHER DIRECTLY OR THROUGH THIRD-PARTY REIMBURSEMENT. OTHER FACTORS THAT DEMONSTRATED COMMUNITY BENEFIT INCLUDED: SURPLUS FUNDS WERE USED TO IMPROVE PATIENT CARE, EXPAND FACILITIES AND ADVANCE MEDICAL TRAINING, EDUCATION AND RESEARCH; AND IT WAS CONTROLLED BY A BOARD OF DIRECTORS THAT CONSISTED OF INDEPENDENT CIVIC LEADERS. THE AMERICAN HOSPITAL ASSOCIATION (""AHA"") HOLDS THE POSITION THAT MEDICARE UNDERPAYMENTS (SHORTFALLS) AND BAD DEBT SHOULD BE REPORTED AS COMMUNITY BENEFIT ON FORM 990, SCHEDULE H, PART I, LINE 7. IN A LETTER TO THE IRS DATED AUGUST 21, 2007 RESPONDING TO A DRAFT OF THE NEW FORM 990 AND SCHEDULE H, THE AHA ARGUES THAT MEDICARE UNDERPAYMENTS (SHORTFALLS) IS COMMUNITY BENEFIT FOR THE FOLLOWING REASONS: -PROVIDING CARE FOR THE ELDERLY AND SERVING MEDICARE PATIENTS REMAINS AN ESSENTIAL PART OF THE COMMUNITY BENEFIT STANDARD. -MEDICARE, LIKE MEDICAID, DOES NOT PAY THE FULL COST OF CARE. RECENTLY, MEDICARE REIMBURSES ONLY 92 CENTS FOR EVERY DOLLAR HOSPITALS SPEND TO CARE FOR MEDICARE PATIENTS. THE MEDICARE PAYMENT ADVISORY COMMISSION IN ITS MARCH 2007 REPORT CAUTIONED THAT UNDERPAYMENT WILL GET EVEN WORSE. -MANY MEDICARE PATIENTS, LIKE THEIR MEDICAID COUNTERPARTS, ARE POOR. MORE THAN 46% OF MEDICARE SPENDING IS FOR BENEFICIARIES WHOSE INCOME IS BELOW 200% OF THE FEDERAL POVERTY LEVEL. MANY ARE ALSO ELIGIBLE FOR MEDICAID, SO CALLED -DUAL ELIGIBLES"". PENNSYLVANIA REQUIRES NON-PROFIT HOSPITALS LIKE GCMC TO PROVIDE A MINIMUM LEVEL OF COMMUNITY BENEFIT TO RETAIN EXEMPTION FROM STATE AND LOCAL TAXES. ACCORDING TO STATE GUIDANCE AND CASE LAW, THE UNREIMBURSED COST OF MEDICARE AND BAD DEBT IS CONSIDERED TO BE COMMUNITY BENEFIT FOR STATE TAX EXEMPTION PURPOSES. GCMC CONSIDERS THE TOTAL MEDICARE UNDERPAYMENTS (SHORTFALL) OF 10,584,035 SHOULD BE REPORTED AS COMMUNITY BENEFIT ON THE FORM 990, SCHEDULE H, PART I, LINE 7. ALONG WITH PROVIDING CARE TO MEDICAID PATIENTS AND PROVIDING FREE OR DISCOUNTED CARE TO OTHER LOW INCOME PATIENTS, THE IRS COMMUNITY BENEFIT STANDARD INCLUDES THE PROVISION OF CARE TO THE ELDERLY AND MEDICARE PATIENTS. FOR MANY OF THE MEDICAL SERVICES PROVIDED BY THE HOSPITAL, MEDICARE DOES NOT PROVIDE SUFFICIENT REIMBURSEMENT TO COVER THE COST OF PROVIDING CARE TO THESE PATIENTS, FORCING GCMC TO USE OTHER FUNDS TO COVER THE SHORTFALL. MEDICARE SHORTFALLS MUST BE ABSORBED BY GCMC IN ORDER TO CONTINUE TREATING THE ELDERLY IN OUR COMMUNITY. GCMC PROVIDES CARE REGARDLESS OF THE MEDICARE SHORTFALL AND IS THEREBY PROVIDING ACCESS TO MEDICAL SERVICES FOR THE ELDERLY AND RELIEVING THE FEDERAL GOVERNMENT OF THE BURDEN OF PAYING THE FULL COST FOR PROVIDING CARE TO MEDICARE PATIENTS. ABSENT THE MEDICARE PROGRAM, IT IS LIKELY THAT MEDICARE PATIENTS WOULD BE ELIGIBLE FOR CHARITY CARE OR OTHER NEEDS BASED GOVERNMENT PROGRAMS. THE AMOUNT EXPENDED TO COVER THE SHORTFALL IS MONEY NOT AVAILABLE FOR FINANCIAL ASSISTANCE AND OTHER COMMUNITY BENEFIT NEEDS. BOTH GCMC AND THE AHA BELIEVE THAT PATIENT BAD DEBT BE REPORTED AS A COMMUNITY BENEFIT ON FORM 990, SCHEDULE H, PART I, LINE 7. LIKE MEDICARE UNDERPAYMENTS (SHORTFALLS), BAD DEBT (PART III, LINE 3) SHOULD BE REPORTED AS COMMUNITY BENEFIT BECAUSE: -A SIGNIFICANT PORTION OF BAD DEBT IS ATTRIBUTABLE TO LOW-INCOME PATIENTS, WHO FOR MANY REASONS DECLINE TO COMPLETE THE FORMS REQUIRED TO ESTABLISH ELIGIBILITY UNDER GCMC'S CHARITY CARE OR FINANCIAL ASSISTANCE POLICY (FAP). A 2006 CONGRESSIONAL BUDGET OFFICE (""CBO""), ""NONPROFIT HOSPITALS AND THE PROVISION OF COMMUNITY BENEFIT"", CITED TWO STUDIES INDICATING THAT ""THE GREAT MAJORITY OF BAD DEBT WAS ATTRIBUTABLE TO PATIENTS WITH INCOMES BELOW 200% OF THE FEDERAL POVERTY LINE."" -THE CBO REPORT ALSO NOTED THAT A SUBSTANTIAL PORTION OF THE BAD DEBT IS PENDING CHARITY CARE. UNLIKE BAD DEBT IN OTHER INDUSTRIES, HOSPITAL BAD DEBT IS COMPLICATED BY THE FACT THAT HOSPITALS FOLLOW THEIR CHARITABLE MISSION TO THE COMMUNITY AND TREAT EVERY PATIENT THAT COMES THROUGH THE EMERGENCY DEPARTMENT, REGARDLESS OF ABILITY TO PAY. PATIENT WHO HAVE OUTSTANDING BILLS ARE NOT TURNED AWAY, UNLIKE OTHER INDUSTRIES. BAD DEBT IS FURTHER COMPLICATED BY THE AUDITING INDUSTRY'S STANDARDS ON REPORTING CHARITY CARE. MANY PATIENTS CANNOT OR DO NOT PROVIDE THE NECESSARY DOCUMENTATION REQUIRED TO BE DEEMED CHARITY CARE BY AUDITORS. AS A RESULT, ACCORDING THE CBO REPORT, ROUGHLY 40% OF BAD DEBT IS PENDING CHARITY CARE. (IN FY 2015, APPROXIMATELY 52.5% OF GCMC'S BAD DEBT WAS SUBSEQUENTLY RECLASSIFIED TO CHARITY CARE.) THE CBO CONCLUDED THAT ITS FINDINGS ""SUPPORT THE VALIDITY OF THE USE OF UNCOMPENSATED CARE (BAD DEBT AND CHARITY CARE) AS A MEASURE OF COMMUNITY BENEFITS"" ASSUMING THE FINDINGS ARE GENERALIZED NATIONALLY. THE EXPERIENCE OF HOSPITALS NATIONWIDE REINFORCE THAT THEY ARE GENERALIZABLE. AS OUTLINED BY THE AHS, DESPITE THE HOSPITAL'S BEST EFFORTS AND DUE DILIGENCE, PATIENT BAD DEBT IS A PART OF THE CHARITABLE MISSION AND CHARITABLE PURPOSES. BAD DEBT REPRESENTS PART OF THE BURDEN HOSPITALS' SHOULDER IN SERVING ALL PATIENTS REGARDLESS OF RACE, COLOR, CREED, SEX, NATIONAL ORIGIN, RELIGION OR ABILITY TO PAY. IN ADDITION, THE HOSPITAL INVESTS SIGNIFICANT RESOURCES IN SYSTEMS AND STAFF TRAINING TO ASSIST PATIENTS THAT ARE IN NEED OF FINANCIAL ASSISTANCE."

MISSION. GEISINGER'S MISSION IS TO ENHANCE THE QUALITY OF LIFE THROUGH AN INTEGRATED HEALTH SERVICE ORGANIZATION BASED ON A BALANCED PROGRAM OF PATIENT CARE, EDUCATION, RESEARCH, AND COMMUNITY SERVICE. THIS MISSION STATEMENT HAS BEEN SUMMARIZED INTO FOUR WORDS - ""HEAL. TEACH. DISCOVER. SERVE."" HISTORY. GEISINGER HAD ITS BEGINNINGS IN THE SMALL COMMUNITY OF DANVILLE, WHICH IS LOCATED IN CENTRAL PENNSYLVANIA ON THE NORTHERN BRANCH OF THE SUSQUEHANNA RIVER. THERE, IN 1915, ABIGAIL A. GEISINGER FOUNDED THE GEORGE F. GEISINGER MEMORIAL HOSPITAL IN MEMORY OF HER HUSBAND. FROM THE BEGINNING, THE NEW HOSPITAL WAS DESIGNED AS A COMPREHENSIVE HEALTHCARE INSTITUTION THAT WOULD OFFER SPECIALIZED MEDICAL CARE TO PEOPLE IN THE RURAL AREAS OF CENTRAL AND NORTHEASTERN PENNSYLVANIA. UNLIKE MOST HEALTHCARE SYSTEMS, WHICH EVOLVED WITH A HOSPITAL FOCUS, GEISINGER'S HISTORY AND TRADITION IS THAT OF A PHYSICIAN-LED AND PHYSICIAN-DRIVEN HEALTHCARE ORGANIZATION. THIS TRADITION BEGAN WHEN MRS. GEISINGER BROUGHT DR. HAROLD FOSS, A MAYO CLINIC TRAINED PHYSICIAN, TO BE HER HOSPITAL'S FIRST CHIEF OF STAFF. TODAY, GEISINGER IS REGARDED AS A NATIONAL MODEL OF HEALTHCARE DELIVERY CENTERED ON A SOPHISTICATED MULTISPECIALTY GROUP PRACTICE. SINCE THE 1970S, GEISINGER'S STRATEGY OF INTEGRATING PHYSICIANS AND HOSPITALS EXPANDED TO INCLUDE THE MANAGEMENT OF HEALTH AND THE FINANCING OF HEALTHCARE SERVICES THROUGH ITS WHOLLY CONTROLLED HEALTH MAINTENANCE ORGANIZATION, GEISINGER HEALTH PLAN. TWO INDEMNITY HEALTH INSURERS, GEISINGER INDEMNITY INSURANCE COMPANY AND GEISINGER QUALITY OPTIONS, INC., KNOWN COLLECTIVELY WITH GEISINGER HEALTH PLAN AS ""GEISINGER HEALTH PLANS- OR ""GHPS"", HAVE BEEN ADDED IN RECENT YEARS.

Discounts and payments in patients' accounts are deducted before the cost of bad debt expense is determined. The method employed is in line with those described in Schedule H, Worksheet 2, ""Ratio of Patient Costs to Charges"". The organization's bad debt expense consists solely of self-pay patients accounts deemed uncollectable. It is UPMC Altoona's contention that the cost of bad debt should be stated in Part I Line 7 of Schedule H as they represent the costs for provision of services to patients for which the entity has exhausted all recourse for reimbursement. The services provided to patients who present themselves are provided regardless of a patient's ability to pay as in line with the organization's charitable mission and service to our community. These expenses are incurred regardless of the efficiency of the provision of the related medical care and are deemed to have been medically necessary for the patient. UPMC Altoona reclassifies bad debt accounts as charity care by utilizing a predictive model PARO (Payment Assistance Rank Order). PARO was built as a socio-economic score that identifies those patients that are most likely to be the highest need of financial assistance. This is accomplished by analyzing consumer data and activity, court records, government records, property files, Census data and IRS data. PARO provides a systematic approach to Financial Assistance: "" Predictive model that encompasses healthcare economics and credit policies; "" Uniform assessment measure for every patient regardless of financial standing; "" Accounts for patients that are unresponsive, illiterate, or otherwise challenged to apply; "" Eliminate barrier to application and meets increased pressure to provide additional financial resources to Consumers; "" Identify and support those Community needs efforts to provide assistance to those Consumers in need. There are two data points returned to UPMC Altoona in order to make the decision whether the patient would qualify for charity care. The first is the estimated income level based on the Federal Poverty Level guidelines. The second is the PARO score which utilizes an algorithm based approach and returns a score based on personal attributes of the patient. Data elements were combined to create two primary indicators of need, the PARO score and the Federal Poverty Level. PARO analyzed our historical charity care approvals to determine our PARO threshold and the FPL threshold for the historical approvals. The approved charity care accounts were compared against accounts that were in active accounts receivable. This was done to determine if the distributions were similar or if any pattern existed based on the approved accounts and the unknown accounts. If the patient's estimated income and PARO score are within the scores identified by the calibration of UPMC's existing charity care patients, the account is reclassified from bad debt to charity care. Every patient is able to apply for charity care; however, the automated strategy focuses on patients that do not complete the applications process. The US Department of Education estimates that 1 in 5 consumers are functionally illiterate. This, coupled with the low levels of participation in traditional banking methods, makes the application process virtually impossible for some consumers. See UPMC's Consolidated Audited Financial Statements page 6."

An assessment of the communities' healthcare needs are part of the initial and follow-up survey processes and involve a household survey, focus groups, and survey of local businesses, service providers, healthcare providers with special expertise and knowledge in helping to assess needs within our community. The most recent community needs assessment was conducted in FY 2012-13 and identified the following categories of community needs: Economics (unemployment/underemployment, poverty, lack of jobs); Education (children being adequately educated, unsafe school environment, bullying/harassment, use/availability of drugs); Environmental (water or air pollution, noise or other pollution); Health (alcohol and/or drug abuse, smoking and tobacco, adults with mental illness or emotional issues, children with mental health or emotional issues, lack of affordable medical care, HIV/AIDS, diabetes, obesity); Housing (shortage of affordable housing, substandard housing, overcrowded housing); Leisure Activities (shortage of recreational facilities, lack of cultural activities); Safety (crime, gangs); Social (teen pregnancy, racial or ethnic intimidation, family violence, gambling, lack of affordable daycare for children) and Transportation (inadequate public transportation, poor road and/or traffic conditions). From this total list of identified community needs, the Health Blair County Coalition Steering Committee, of which UPMC Altoona is a member, identified four areas of need to be addressed by the Coalition, although other identified needs are also being addressed by others in the community, 1.

THE ORGANIZATION IS RECOGNIZED AS A TAX-EXEMPT ENTITY AND CHARITABLE ORGANIZATION UNDER 501(C)(3) OF THE IRC. ALTHOUGH THERE IS NO DEFINITION IN THE TAX CODE FOR THE TERM ""CHARITABLE"" A REGULATION PROMULGATED BY THE DEPARTMENT OF THE TREASURY PROVIDES SOME GUIDANCE AND STATES THAT ""[T]HE TERM CHARITABLE IS USED IN SECTION 501(C)(3) IN ITS GENERALLY ACCEPTED LEGAL SENSE,"" AND PROVIDES EXAMPLES OF CHARITABLE PURPOSES, INCLUDING THE RELIEF OF THE POOR OR UNPRIVILEGED; THE PROMOTION OF SOCIAL WELFARE; AND THE ADVANCEMENT OF EDUCATION, RELIGION, AND SCIENCE. NOTE IT DOES NOT EXPLICITLY ADDRESS THE ACTIVITIES OF HOSPITALS.

THE ORIGINAL STANDARD WAS KNOWN AS THE CHARITY CARE STANDARD. THIS STANDARD WAS REPLACED BY THE IRS WITH THE COMMUNITY BENEFIT STANDARD WHICH IS THE CURRENT STANDARD. CHARITY CARE STANDARD IN 1956, THE IRS ISSUED REVENUE RULING 56-185, WHICH ADDRESSED THE REQUIREMENTS HOSPITALS NEEDED TO MEET IN ORDER TO QUALIFY FOR IRC 501(C)(3) STATUS. ONE OF THESE REQUIREMENTS IS KNOWN AS THE ""CHARITY CARE STANDARD."" UNDER THE STANDARD, A HOSPITAL HAD TO PROVIDE, TO THE EXTENT OF ITS FINANCIAL ABILITY, FREE OR REDUCED-COST CARE TO PATIENTS UNABLE TO PAY FOR IT. A HOSPITAL THAT EXPECTED FULL PAYMENT DID NOT, ACCORDING TO THE RULING, PROVIDE CHARITY CARE BASED ON THE FACT THAT SOME PATIENTS ULTIMATELY FAILED TO PAY. THE RULING EMPHASIZED THAT A LOW LEVEL OF CHARITY CARE DID NOT NECESSARILY MEAN THAT A HOSPITAL HAD FAILED TO MEET THE REQUIREMENT SINCE THAT LEVEL COULD REFLECT ITS FINANCIAL ABILITY TO PROVIDE SUCH CARE. THE RULING ALSO NOTED THAT PUBLICLY SUPPORTED COMMUNITY HOSPITALS WOULD NORMALLY QUALIFY AS CHARITABLE ORGANIZATIONS BECAUSE THEY SERVE THE ENTIRE COMMUNITY, AND A LOW LEVEL OF CHARITY CARE WOULD NOT AFFECT A HOSPITAL'S EXEMPT STATUS IF IT WAS DUE TO THE SURROUNDING COMMUNITY'S LACK OF CHARITABLE DEMANDS.

UNDER THE STANDARD DEVELOPED IN REVENUE RULING 69-545, WHICH IS KNOWN AS THE ""COMMUNITY BENEFIT STANDARD,"" HOSPITALS ARE JUDGED ON WHETHER THEY PROMOTE THE HEALTH OF A BROAD CLASS OF INDIVIDUALS IN THE COMMUNITY. THE RULING INVOLVED A HOSPITAL THAT ONLY ADMITTED INDIVIDUALS WHO COULD PAY FOR THE SERVICES (BY THEMSELVES, PRIVATE INSURANCE, OR PUBLIC PROGRAMS SUCH AS MEDICARE), BUT OPERATED A FULL-TIME EMERGENCY ROOM THAT WAS OPEN TO EVERYONE. THE IRS RULED THAT THE HOSPITAL QUALIFIED AS A CHARITABLE ORGANIZATION BECAUSE IT PROMOTED THE HEALTH OF PEOPLE IN ITS COMMUNITY. THE IRS REASONED THAT BECAUSE THE PROMOTION OF HEALTH WAS A CHARITABLE PURPOSE ACCORDING TO THE GENERAL LAW OF CHARITY, IT FELL WITHIN THE ""GENERALLY ACCEPTED LEGAL SENSE"" OF THE TERM ""CHARITABLE,"" AS REQUIRED BY TREAS. REG. 1.501(C)(3)-1(D)(2). THE IRS RULING STATED THAT THE PROMOTION OF HEALTH, LIKE THE RELIEF OF POVERTY AND THE ADVANCEMENT OF EDUCATION AND RELIGION, IS ONE OF THE PURPOSES IN THE GENERAL LAW OF CHARITY THAT IS DEEMED BENEFICIAL TO THE COMMUNITY AS A WHOLE EVEN THOUGH THE CLASS OF BENEFICIARIES ELIGIBLE TO RECEIVE A DIRECT BENEFIT FROM ITS ACTIVITIES DOES NOT INCLUDE ALL MEMBERS OF THE COMMUNITY, SUCH AS INDIGENT MEMBERS OF THE COMMUNITY, PROVIDED THAT THE CLASS IS NOT SO SMALL THAT ITS RELIEF IS NOT OF BENEFIT TO THE COMMUNITY. THE IRS CONCLUDED THAT THE HOSPITAL WAS ""PROMOTING THE HEALTH OF A CLASS OF PERSONS THAT IS BROAD ENOUGH TO BENEFIT THE COMMUNITY"" BECAUSE ITS EMERGENCY ROOM WAS OPEN TO ALL AND IT PROVIDED CARE TO EVERYONE WHO COULD PAY, WHETHER DIRECTLY OR THROUGH THIRD-PARTY REIMBURSEMENT. OTHER CHARACTERISTICS OF THE HOSPITAL THAT THE IRS HIGHLIGHTED INCLUDED THE FOLLOWING: ITS SURPLUS FUNDS WERE USED TO IMPROVE PATIENT CARE, EXPAND HOSPITAL FACILITIES, AND ADVANCE MEDICAL TRAINING, EDUCATION, AND RESEARCH; IT WAS CONTROLLED BY A BOARD OF TRUSTEES THAT CONSISTED OF INDEPENDENT CIVIC LEADERS; AND HOSPITAL MEDICAL STAFF PRIVILEGES WERE AVAILABLE TO ALL QUALIFIED PHYSICIANS. THE AMERICAN HOSPITAL ASSOCIATION (""AHA"") BELIEVES THAT MEDICARE UNDERPAYMENTS (SHORTFALL) AND BAD DEBT ARE COMMUNITY BENEFIT AND THUS INCLUDABLE ON THE FORM 990, SCHEDULE H, PART I. THIS ORGANIZATION AGREES WITH THE AHA POSITION. AS OUTLINED IN THE AHA LETTER TO THE IRS DATED AUGUST 21, 2007 WITH RESPECT TO THE FIRST PUBLISHED DRAFT OF THE NEW FORM 990 AND SCHEDULE H, THE AHA FELT THAT THE IRS SHOULD INCORPORATE THE FULL VALUE OF THE COMMUNITY BENEFIT THAT HOSPITALS PROVIDE BY COUNTING MEDICARE UNDERPAYMENTS (SHORTFALL) AS QUANTIFIABLE COMMUNITY BENEFIT FOR THE FOLLOWING REASONS: - PROVIDING CARE FOR THE ELDERLY AND SERVING MEDICARE PATIENTS IS AN ESSENTIAL PART OF THE COMMUNITY BENEFIT STANDARD. - MEDICARE, LIKE MEDICAID, DOES NOT PAY THE FULL COST OF CARE. RECENTLY, MEDICARE REIMBURSES HOSPITALS ONLY 92 CENTS FOR EVERY DOLLAR THEY SPEND TO TAKE CARE OF MEDICARE PATIENTS. THE MEDICARE PAYMENT ADVISORY COMMISSION (""MEDPAC"") IN ITS MARCH 2007 REPORT TO CONGRESS CAUTIONED THAT UNDERPAYMENT WILL GET EVEN WORSE, WITH MARGINS REACHING A 10-YEAR LOW AT NEGATIVE 5.4 PERCENT. - MANY MEDICARE BENEFICIARIES, LIKE THEIR MEDICAID COUNTERPARTS, ARE POOR. MORE THAN 46 PERCENT OF MEDICARE SPENDING IS FOR BENEFICIARIES WHOSE INCOME IS BELOW 200 PERCENT OF THE FEDERAL POVERTY LEVEL. MANY OF THOSE MEDICARE BENEFICIARIES ARE ALSO ELIGIBLE FOR MEDICAID -- SO CALLED ""DUAL ELIGIBLES."" THERE IS EVERY COMPELLING PUBLIC POLICY REASON TO TREAT MEDICARE AND MEDICAID UNDERPAYMENTS SIMILARLY FOR PURPOSES OF A HOSPITAL'S COMMUNITY BENEFIT AND INCLUDE THESE COSTS ON FORM 990, SCHEDULE H, PART I. MEDICARE UNDERPAYMENT MUST BE SHOULDERED BY THE HOSPITAL IN ORDER TO CONTINUE TREATING THE COMMUNITY'S ELDERLY AND POOR. THESE UNDERPAYMENTS REPRESENT A REAL COST OF SERVING THE COMMUNITY AND SHOULD COUNT AS A QUANTIFIABLE COMMUNITY BENEFIT. BOTH THE AHA AND THIS ORGANIZATION ALSO FEEL THAT PATIENT BAD DEBT IS A COMMUNITY BENEFIT AND THUS INCLUDABLE ON THE FORM 990, SCHEDULE H, PART I. LIKE MEDICARE UNDERPAYMENT (SHORTFALLS), THERE ALSO ARE COMPELLING REASONS THAT PATIENT BAD DEBT SHOULD BE COUNTED AS QUANTIFIABLE COMMUNITY BENEFIT AS FOLLOWS: - A SIGNIFICANT MAJORITY OF BAD DEBT IS ATTRIBUTABLE TO LOW-INCOME PATIENTS, WHO, FOR MANY REASONS, DECLINE TO COMPLETE THE FORMS REQUIRED TO ESTABLISH ELIGIBILITY FOR HOSPITALS' CHARITY CARE OR FINANCIAL ASSISTANCE PROGRAMS. A 2006 CONGRESSIONAL BUDGET OFFICE (""CBO"") REPORT, NONPROFIT HOSPITALS AND THE PROVISION OF COMMUNITY BENEFITS, CITED TWO STUDIES INDICATING THAT ""THE GREAT MAJORITY OF BAD DEBT WAS ATTRIBUTABLE TO PATIENTS WITH INCOMES BELOW 200% OF THE FEDERAL POVERTY LINE."" - THE REPORT ALSO NOTED THAT A SUBSTANTIAL PORTION OF BAD DEBT IS PENDING CHARITY CARE. UNLIKE BAD DEBT IN OTHER INDUSTRIES, HOSPITAL BAD DEBT IS COMPLICATED BY THE FACT THAT HOSPITALS FOLLOW THEIR MISSION TO THE COMMUNITY AND TREAT EVERY PATIENT THAT COMES THROUGH THEIR EMERGENCY DEPARTMENT, REGARDLESS OF ABILITY TO PAY. PATIENTS WHO HAVE OUTSTANDING BILLS ARE NOT TURNED AWAY, UNLIKE OTHER INDUSTRIES. BAD DEBT IS FURTHER COMPLICATED BY THE AUDITING INDUSTRY'S STANDARDS ON REPORTING CHARITY CARE. MANY PATIENTS CANNOT OR DO NOT PROVIDE THE NECESSARY, EXTENSIVE DOCUMENTATION REQUIRED TO BE DEEMED CHARITY CARE BY AUDITORS. AS A RESULT, ROUGHLY 40% OF BAD DEBT IS PENDING CHARITY CARE. - THE CBO CONCLUDED THAT ITS FINDINGS ""SUPPORT THE VALIDITY OF THE USE OF UNCOMPENSATED CARE [BAD DEBT AND CHARITY CARE] AS A MEASURE OF COMMUNITY BENEFITS"" ASSUMING THE FINDINGS ARE GENERALIZABLE NATIONWIDE; THE EXPERIENCE OF HOSPITALS AROUND THE NATION REINFORCES THAT THEY ARE GENERALIZABLE.

MERCY HOSPITAL SPRINGFIELD'S EFFORTS TO ENHANCE THE OPERATIONAL STRUCTURES OF THE COMMUNITY INCLUDE COLLABORATIONS WITH MANY COMMUNITY ORGANIZATIONS; FOR EXAMPLE: BURRELL BEHAVIORAL HEALTH, COMMUNITY PARTNERSHIP OF THE OZARKS, MISSOURI STATE UNIVERSITY, OZARKS COUNSELING CENTER, SPRINGFIELD PUBLIC SCHOOLS, SPRINGFIELD-GREENE COUNTY HEALTH DEPARTMENT, AND THE HEALTH COMMISSION. COMMUNITY BUILDING ACTIVITIES PROMOTE THE HEALTH OF THE COMMUNITIES THEY SERVE THROUGH COMMUNITY-BASED PARTNERSHIPS, MEETINGS AND EVENTS, AND SERVICE ON COMMUNITY BOARDS. ONE EXAMPLE OF MERCY HOSPITAL SPRINGFIELD'S PARTICIPATION IN COALITION BUILDING AND COMMUNITY HEALTH PROMOTION IS THE MENTAL HEALTH FIRST AID PROGRAM DIRECTED BY COMMUNITY PARTNERSHIP OF THE OZARKS. THE PROGRAM WAS DEVELOPED GIVEN THE HIGH INCIDENCE OF BEHAVIORAL HEALTH AND SUICIDE-RELATED ISSUES FOR YOUTH THROUGHOUT SOUTHWEST MISSOURI AND ALLOWS CLINICAL AND NON-CLINICAL STAFF TO PARTICIPATE IN SCREENINGS, EDUCATION AND OTHER COMMUNITY EVENTS TO ENSURE LOCAL YOUTH HAVE SUFFICIENT BEHAVIORAL HEALTH SERVICES AND SUPPORT. AS RESEARCH INDICATES, THIS IMPACTS YOUTH'S EDUCATION AND ECONOMIC VIABILITY; THUS, MANY COMMUNITY PARTNERS ARE HIGHLY ENGAGED IN THIS INITIATIVE.

IN RESPONSE TO THIS, MERCY HOSPITAL SPRINGFIELD AND MISSOURI STATE UNIVERSITY INITIATED THE DEVELOPMENT OF A NEW FREE CLINIC, MSU CARE, WHICH OPENED IN OCTOBER 2015, SERVING THE SAME POPULATION WITH MORE THAN THREE TIMES THE CAPACITY.

201630899349300703,362167847,"Schedule H, Part III, Line 2 Bad debt expense - methodology used to estimate amount","All charges for any service provided by Rockford Memorial Hospital are the very same for every individual, regardless of whether it is for emergency or standard care and regardless of the patient's ability to pay. Each patient is then assessed for eligibility for financial assistance based on predefined criteria of financial status and income level. If the patient qualifies for financial assistance, the expected reimbursement is based on charity care policy guidelines. If the patient has no insurance and doesn't qualify for financial assistance, the expected reimbursement is 75% of billed charges. The organization maintains a bad debt reserve on the Balance Sheet. Any bad debt write-offs of patient accounts will go against the bad debt reserve. At each month end based on the accounts receivable by financial class and aging bucket, the reserve amount is re-evaluated. The amount needed to maintain the appropriate reserve level is the bad debt expense. Any payments received on patient accounts previously written off to bad debt will offset the bad debt expense."
201630899349300703,362167847,"Schedule H, Part III, Line 4 Bad debt expense - financial statement footnote","Page 14. ""Patient Service Revenue,"" The System recognizes patient service revenue associated with services provided to patients who have third-party payor coverage primarily on the basis of contractual rates for the services rendered. For uninsured patients that do not qualify for charity care, the System recognizes revenue on the basis of discounted rates established under the System's uninsured patient policy. The provision for contractual allowances (that is, the differences between established rates and expected third-party payor payments) and the discounts (that is, the difference between established rates and the amount billable) are recognized on the accrual basis. These amounts are deducted from gross patient service revenue to determine patient service revenue (net of contractual allowances and discounts). Based on the historical experience of the System, a significant portion of uninsured patients will be unwilling or unable to pay for services provided. Thus, the System records a provision for patient bad debts related to uninsured patients in the period the services are provided. The provision for patient bad debts is based on historical loss experience and is deducted from patient service revenue (net of contractual allowances and discounts) to determine net patient service revenue less provision for bad debts. The System also accrues retroactive adjustments under reimbursement agreements with third-party payors on an estimated basis in the period the related services are provided. Estimates are adjusted in future periods as final settlements are determined."

Our mission is to provide health care to everyone who comes to our door, regardless of their ability to pay. We will submit a claim to all 3rd party payors on behalf of the patient. We help patients apply for all possible insurance or assistance such as crime victims, an automobile accident, workers' compensation, Medicaid, COBRA, local assistance and/or hospital financial assistance. If they do not qualify for any of these, we can extend payment options such as monthly payments, credit card payments or financial assistance. This is offered to patients who are experiencing legitimate financial hardships and are unable to pay for all or part of the patient's medical care. Forgiveness may apply to an amount after applying all payments such as any insurance company, health plan or personal payments, any negotiated discounts or any uninsured discounts. If a patient eligible for charity care or partial financial assistance still has a portion of the outstanding balance due, other arrangements are made. RMH accepts a variety of payments and alternative payment plans. Monthly statements are sent as payment reminders for contracted arrangements. In case of default, additional letters and calls are made to bring it to a current status. An account is turned over to a collection agency only after non-payment or no contact in 120 days although RMH will suspend collection efforts once a completed application has been received and is pending approval or denial."

Formed in 1995 as a not-for-profit community membership collaborative, Rockford Health Council is comprised of various community leaders and is committed to promoting health and improving access for the residents of northern Illinois. The 2014 Healthy Community Study included a comprehensive community analysis that reviewed demographic, socioeconomic, general health behavior, and disease incidence and mortality information for the residents of Winnebago and Boone Counties and provided comparisons to state and national data. A household survey which focused on demographic, general health conditions, behavioral health, maternal, prenatal, and early childhood health, and chronic disease and obesity was also distributed to residents throughout the community. In addition, a key informant questionnaire was conducted with various individuals throughout the community to identify health and human service needs. The completed study is available on the Rockford Health System and Rockford Health Council respective websites. In addition to the 2014 Healthy Community Study, Rockford Health System completed a community needs assessment in order to plan for and anticipate future clinical program needs and related physician requirements specific to our local and regional community. This study analyzed physicians by specialty within the community including review of suggested physician manpower requirements as determined by population forecasts, physician age, and physician accessibility of the local area and forms the basis for physician recruitment and succession planning. Out-migration analysis was also completed. Understanding why residents of the local community leave the area for various inpatient services is used to plan for future clinical programs and services that may not be readily available in our local community. The study looks at pediatric versus adult patients, actual patient diagnosis and hospital services received. All of these tools were used to develop the Rockford Health System Community Benefit Implementation Plan which was approved by the Board of Directors in 2014. An oversight committee meets routinely to ensure plan implementation of the various strategies and tactics with a progress report provided to the Board on an annual basis."

201630899349300703,362167847,"Schedule H, Part VI, Line 4 Community information","Rockford Memorial Hospital is located in Rockford, IL (Winnebago County) with a defined primary service area that includes Winnebago, Boone, and Ogle Counties. 2013 US Census Bureau estimates project the population for the entire area at slightly more than 400,500 individuals with a little more than 73% living in Winnebago County (approximately 293,000). Located in northern Illinois, the primary service area is characterized as largely rural and populated with very small communities with the exception of the neighboring cities of Rockford, Loves Park, and Machesney Park which comprise more than 197,000 individuals. The next largest community is Belvidere, located in Boone County where the entire county has a population of approximately 54,000 people. In calendar year 2014, approximately 84% of hospital inpatients were from the Primary Service Area. As a community that relies heavily on manufacturing companies and small businesses, the area was particularly hard hit in recent years. Currently, the largest employers include Chrysler (Boone County), the Rockford Public Schools, and the three Rockford health care providers. The most recent median household income figures (U.S. Census Bureau) in Winnebago County were $47,000 compared to the state's median household income of $54,000. These disparities are also reflected in unemployment, education and poverty rates. Unemployment rates have improved with most recent figures for Rockford at 7.2%. Only 21% of Winnebago County residents attain a bachelor's degree or higher while in the state 31% do. More than 17% of the residents in Winnebago County live below the poverty line and children in the community have been particularly hit with more than 27% considered at or below poverty levels. The hospital also serves the secondary service area which includes DeKalb, McHenry, Whiteside, Lee, LaSalle, Stephenson and Rock counties for select tertiary services."
201630899349300703,362167847,"Schedule H, Part VI, Line 5 Promotion of community health","Led by a community board of directors, Rockford Memorial Hospital (RMH) and its affiliates are very involved in promoting a healthier community. As one of Rockford's largest employers, the organization takes a leading role in financially supporting not only health-related initiatives, but also community-building activities across the region. This includes providing financial support and talent for economic development and business related activities, as well as quality of life and educational initiatives. Employees participate on community boards and are actively involved in promoting the region and its assets. Based on the results of the Rockford Health Council 2013 Healthy Community Study, the 2014 - 2017 Community Benefit Implementation Plan identified several key areas to focus efforts. For example, as the predominate provider of pediatric services, Rockford Memorial maintains its commitment to the children of our community. This is evident in our support of the Ronald McDonald Care Mobile which provides free dental and medical care to uninsured and underinsured children in five northern Illinois counties. The 40-foot, 26,000 pound mobile unit houses two patient exam rooms, a central waiting room, and a sterilization area and has provided care to more than 6,500 children since the inception of the program in 2003. This totals more than $1.85 million in free care over the life of the program. The Care Mobile is completely funded by philanthropy from the Rockford Memorial Development foundation, Rockford Memorial Hospital Auxiliary, and the Ronald McDonald House Charities of Madison. The Bridge Clinic is yet another venue for un- and under-insured adults to receive free medical treatment for chronic medical issues. Since its opening in 2008, hundreds of people from our community have received care. Many physicians and other health care providers give freely of their time to provide these services to less fortunate individuals in our community to better manage their chronic conditions. Since 2012, Rockford Memorial continues to partner with A Silver Lining Foundation to provide free breast health services to un- and under-insured women in the community. Approximately 500 women have received free screening mammograms and other breast related services and procedures since the program's inception. These are only some of the many contributions that Rockford Memorial makes to promote and improve the health of the community. Rockford Memorial remains committed to educating the public about various health care issues and initiatives and improving the lives of our citizens. RMH does not restrict admission of providers and provides an open medical staff."

CONSISTENT WITH ITS TAX-EXEMPT STATUS AND COMMUNITY SERVICE RESPONSIBILITIES, THE CORPORATION PROVIDES FINANCIAL ASSISTANCE IN THE FORM OF FREE OR DISCOUNTED CARE TO PATIENTS WHO MEET CERTAIN CRITERIA UNDER THE CORPORATION'S CHARITY CARE POLICY. IN ASSESSING A PATIENT'S INABILITY TO PAY, THE CORPORATION UTILIZES FEDERAL POVERTY INCOME GUIDELINES AND FOLLOWS PROCEDURES SET FORTH IN ITS CREDIT AND COLLECTION POLICY, WHICH HAS BEEN APPROVED BY THE COMMONWEALTH OF MASSACHUSETTS DIVISION OF HEALTHCARE FINANCE AND POLICY. BECAUSE THE CORPORATION DOES NOT PURSUE COLLECTION OF AMOUNTS DETERMINED TO QUALIFY AS CHARITY CARE, THESE AMOUNTS ARE NOT REPORTED AS PATIENT SERVICE REVENUE. DURING THE YEARS ENDED SEPTEMBER 30, 2015 AND 2014,THE CORPORATION ESTIMATED THAT THE COST ASSOCIATED WITH THE CHARITY CARE PROVIDED WAS APPROXIMATELY 332,000 AND 1,584,000, RESPECTIVELY. SUCH COSTS HAVE BEEN ESTIMATED BASED ON RATIO OF EXPENSES ( EXCLUDING BAD DEBT ) TO ESTABLISHED PATIENT SERVICE CHARGES. BAD DEBTS - THE PROVISION FOR BAD DEBTS IN THE ACCOMPANYING CONSOLIDATED STATEMENTS OF OPERATIONS REFLECTS THE CHARGES AT ESTABLISHED RATES FOR SERVICES PROVIDED TO THOSE INDIVIDUALS WHO DO NOT QUALIFY FOR CHARITY CARE UNDER THE GUIDELINES DESCRIBED ABOVE, AND WHO ARE OTHERWISE UNABLE OR UNWILLING TO PAY THE CORPORATION.THE PROVISION FOR BAD DEBTS OF 8,261,000 AND 8,814,000 IN 2015 AND 2014, RESPECTIVELY, REPRESENTS THE CHARGES FOR SERVICES PROVIDED THAT ARE DEEMED TO BE UNCOLLECTIBLE. THE ESTIMATED COST OF PROVIDING THESE SERVICES DEEMED UNCCLLECTIBLE WAS APPROXIMATELY 3,489,000 FOR 2015 AND 3,733,000 FOR 2014. HEALTH SAFETY NET (HSN) - THE COMMONWEALTH OF MASSACHUSETTS (THE ""COMMONWEALTH"") ADMINISTERS A HEALTH SAFETY NET (THE HSN) TO ACT AS THE ""PAYOR OF LAST RESORT"" FOR COVERED HEALTH CARE SERVICES PROVIDED BY ACUTE HOSPITALS AND COMMUNITY HEALTH CENTERS IN THE COMMONWEALTH. ALL HOSPITALS HAVE BEEN ASSESSED A UNIFORM ALLOWANCE BASED ON ESTIMATES OF THEIR SHARE OF TOTAL HEALTH SAFETY NET FUNDING AND HAVE BEEN REIMBURSED FOR A PORTION OF THE COST OF ACTUAL UNCOMPENSATED CARE WHICH THEY PROVIDE, SUBJECT TO CERTAIN LIMITATIONS. REIMBURSABLE UNCOMPENSATED CARE INCLUDES NET CHARITY CARE AND BAD DEBTS RESULTING FROM EMERGENCY SERVICES. HOSPITALS' RECOVERIES FROM THE HSN ARE BASED ON REGULATED PAYMENT RATES. THE CORPORATION HAS RECORDED ITS ACTIVITY WITH THE HSN AS A COMPONENT OF NET PATIENT SERVICE REVENUE IN THE ACCOMPANYING CONSOLIDATED STATEMENTS OF OPERATIONS. MANAGEMENT BELIEVES THAT THE ACCOMPANYING CONSOLIDATED BALANCE SHEETS REFLECT REASONABLE ESTIMATES OF THE CORPORATION'S NET OBLIGATION TO THE HSN AS OF SEPTEMBER 30,2015 AND 2014.

THIS EFFORT IS ACHIEVED BY: -RE-INVESTING SURPLUS FUNDS BACK INTO COMMUNITIES THROUGH PROGRAMS AND SERVICES. -MAKING SURE THAT CARE IS AVAILABLE TO EVERYONE - REGARDLESS OF THE ABILITY TO PAY. -USING COMPASSION AS A CORNERSTONE IN IMPROVING THE HEALTH OF OUR COMMUNITIES. -ATTENDING TO THE NEEDS OF PATIENTS AND THEIR FAMILY MEMBERS BY ADDRESSING THE NEEDS OF THE WHOLE PERSON NOT JUST AS A DISEASE OR A DIAGNOSIS. -PROVIDING A RANGE OF SPECIAL BENEFITS TO THE COMMUNITY, SUCH AS PROGRAMS TO MANAGE CARE FOR PERSONS WITH CHRONIC DISEASES, HEALTH EDUCATION AND DISEASE PREVENTION INITIATIVES, OUTREACH FOR THE ELDERLY, AND CARE FOR PERSONS WHO ARE POOR OR UNINSURED. IN COMPLIANCE WITH IRS GUIDELINES, A YEAR-LONG PROCESS TO DEVELOP A FORMAL COMMUNITY HEALTH NEEDS ASSESSMENT (CHNA) WAS COMPLETED BY HALLMARK HEALTH IN AUGUST 2013, IN COLLABORATION WITH THE INSTITUTE FOR COMMUNITY HEALTH (ICH), A NON-PROFIT ORGANIZATION RECOGNIZED FOR COMMUNITY-BASED PARTICIPATORY RESEARCH, ASSESSMENT, AND DISSEMINATION. THIS PROCESS INCLUDED A REVIEW OF REPUTABLE PUBLIC HEALTH, SOCIO-ECONOMIC, AND FOUNDATION DATA; INPUT FROM THE HALLMARK HEALTH COMMUNITY BENEFITS ADVISORY COUNCIL, COMMUNITY OUTREACH TEAMS, PATIENT/FAMILY ADVISORY COUNCIL, LOCAL COMMUNITY COALITIONS, AND THE COMMUNITY HEALTH NETWORK AREAS MEMBERSHIP. STAKEHOLDER INTERVIEWS AND COMMUNITY SURVEYS WERE ALSO COMPLETED. REFLECTING IRS REQUIREMENTS, AND TO FOSTER TRANSPARENCY, THE ENTIRE CHNA AS WELL AS AN EXECUTIVE SUMMARY OF ITS FINDINGS ARE POSTED ON THE HALLMARK HEALTH SYSTEM WEBSITE AND IN PRINTED VERSIONS AT EACH HOSPITAL CAMPUS AND OTHER KEY SERVICE DELIVERY LOCATIONS IN THE CATCHMENT AREA.THE HEALTH SYSTEM'S NEXT CHNA IS CURRENTLY IN DEVELOPMENT, AND WILL BE COMPLETED BY AUGUST 2016 AS PER IRS FINAL REGULATIONS. ONGOING MONITORING OF THE CHNA AND ITS IDENTIFIED HEALTH PRIORITIES IS THE RESPONSIBILITY OF THE COMMUNITY BENEFITS ADVISORY COUNCIL. AS OF THE END OF FY 2015/TY 2014, THE HALLMARK HEALTH COUNCIL IS COMPRISED OF A MEMBER OF THE HOSPITAL'S BOARD OF TRUSTEES; THE SYSTEM VICE PRESIDENT FOR HOME CARE & COMMUNITY PROGRAMS WHO CHAIRS THE COUNCIL ,EXECUTIVE VICE PRESIDENT AND CHIEF LEGAL OFFICER;THE ASSOCIATE CHIEF NURSING OFFICER FOR AMBULATORY SERVICES;CHIEF MARKETING OFFICER; FISCAL CONTROLLER; MANAGER, CASE MANAGEMENT, AN LICSW; MANAGER, CENTRAL SCHEDULING, INSURANCE COORDINATION AND INTERPRETER SERVICES; TWO HALLMARK HEALTH-AFFILIATED PHYSICIANS; FOUR COMMUNITY REPRESENTATIVES; THE DIRECTOR, COMMUNITY SERVICES; AND THE MANAGER,COMMUNITY BENEFITS. THE COUNCIL ACTS AS OVERSEERS FOR THE CHNA, AND DEFINES THE PROCESS FOR RECOGNIZING CURRENT AND EMERGING HEALTH NEEDS IN THE COMMUNITY, AS WELL AS DEVELOPING A MULTI-YEAR COMMUNITY BENEFITS IMPLEMENTATION PLAN TO RESPOND TO THESE NEEDS.AT THE START OF FY 2015/TY 2014, THE COUNCIL REVIEWED THE FY 2014-16 IMPLEMENTATION PLAN AND MADE AMENDMENTS AS REQUIRED TO REFLECT NEW PROGRAMS OR SHIFTS IN EXISTING PROGRAMS AS APPROVED BY THE BOARD OF TRUSTEES.THE COUNCIL MEETS SIX TIMES PER YEAR TO PROVIDE INPUT TO THE ONGOING EXECUTION OF THE PLAN, DISCUSS ONGOING COMMUNITY HEALTH ISSUES, MONITOR THE STATE AND FEDERAL REPORTING PROCESSES FOR COMMUNITY BENEFITS, AND OFFER INPUT TO THE GOVERNING BOARD REGARDING EMERGING AND NEWLY IDENTIFIED COMMUNITY HEALTH NEEDS.THE COUNCIL ADDED AS NEW MEMBERS THE EXECUTIVE DIRECTOR OF A LOCAL HUNGER RELIEF AND FOOD PANTRY PROGRAM, AND A REPRESENTATIVE FROM THE MA DEPARTMENT OF PUBLIC HEALTH, IN FY 2015/TY 2014. RECRUITMENT OF COMMUNITY REPRESENTATIVES, REFLECTING THE VULNERABLE POPULATIONS IN THE COMMUNITY AND REPRESENTING DIVERSE CONSTITUENCIES AND VIEWPOINTS, TAKES PLACES ON AN ONGOING BASIS. HALLMARK HEALTH ALSO ACTIVELY PARTICIPATED WITH THE COMMUNITY THROUGH ITS COMMUNITY OUTREACH TEAMS, SOLICITING INPUT FROM KEY COMMUNITY LEADERS, INCLUDING SUPERINTENDENTS OF SCHOOLS, STATE REPRESENTATIVES, BUSINESS LEADERS, FIRE AND POLICE PERSONNEL AND LOCAL HEALTH DEPARTMENTS. ADDITIONAL APPROACHES INCLUDE WORK AS MEMBERS OF COMMUNITY COALITIONS AND WITH THE COMMUNITY HEALTH NETWORK AREAS (CHNA 15 AND 16) DESIGNATED BY THE MA DEPARTMENT OF PUBLIC HEALTH. THESE HAVE PROVEN EFFECTIVE IN GAINING VITAL PERSPECTIVE AROUND THE HEALTH NEEDS OF LOCAL RESIDENTS, AND IN TAILORING OUTREACH MESSAGES AND PROGRAMMING BASED ON WHAT CONSTITUENCIES AND COMMUNITIES VALUE MOST. (COMMUNITY TEAMS FUNCTIONS ARE FURTHER EXPLAINED IN THE DESCRIPTION OF COMMUNITY BUILDING ACTIVITIES IN PART II.) ANOTHER WAY THAT HALLMARK HEALTH ASSESSES NEEDS WITHIN THE COMMUNITY IS THROUGH THE PATIENT/FAMILY ADVISORY COUNCIL (PFAC). THIS COUNCIL WAS FORMED TO OBTAIN FEEDBACK AND IDEAS FROM COMMUNITY MEMBERS ON HOW THE HOSPITALS CAN BE MORE RECEPTIVE TO THE UNIQUE NEEDS OF COMMUNITY RESIDENTS, ESPECIALLY THOSE OF DIVERSE BACKGROUNDS, AND TO PROMOTE THE HIGHEST QUALITY OF PATIENT-CENTERED SERVICES BY FOSTERING A STRONG PARTNERSHIP THROUGH OUTREACH ACTIVITIES WITH COMMUNITY RESIDENTS. THE COUNCIL OFTEN ASSISTS HALLMARK HEALTH STAFF BY PROVIDING INPUT INTO THE PLANNING OF FUTURE COMMUNITY ACTIVITIES AND INITIATIVES. IN FY 2015/TY 2014, PFAC MEMBERS' INPUT WAS SOLICITED ON FURNITURE THAT HALLMARK HEALTH PURCHASED TO UPDATE AND IMPROVE PATIENT ROOMS, A COMPLETE REVISION OF THE HOSPITAL'S PATIENT WELCOME PACKETS, A UNIFORM, SYSTEM-WIDE PROTOCOL FOR PATIENT SIGN-IN PROCEDURES IN OUTPATIENT OFFICES, AND THE CREATION OF A MORE ""USER- FRIENDLY"" PATIENT DISCHARGE REPORT. PFAC MEMBERS RAISED QUESTIONS AROUND PATIENT CALL BUTTONS, SERVED ON A PILOT SUB-GROUP TO TEST THE HOSPITAL'S NEW ELECTRONIC PATIENT PORTAL, PROVIDED FEEDBACK ON THE HOSPITAL'S INTERPRETER SERVICES PROGRAM, AND REVIEWED AND COMMENTED ON PROPOSED RENOVATIONS TO THE EMERGENCY DEPARTMENT AT LAWRENCE MEMORIAL HOSPITAL. AS PART OF ITS EFFORTS TO IMPROVE HEALTH STATUS IN THE CATCHMENT AREA, HALLMARK HEALTH SYSTEM ALSO PARTICIPATES IN A VARIETY OF BROAD-BASED COMMUNITY COALITIONS AND INITIATIVES THAT WORK TOWARDS ADDRESSING THE SPECIFIC AND GENERAL HEALTH NEEDS IN THESE CITIES AND TOWNS. A SAMPLE OF THESE MEMBERSHIPS INCLUDE: MYSTIC VALLEY ELDER SERVICES PROVIDER TASK FORCE; LOCAL COUNCILS ON AGING; THE HEALTHY FAMILIES COMMUNITY COALITION; THE JOINT COMMITTEE FOR CHILDREN'S HEALTH CARE IN EVERETT (JCCHCE); MEDFORD HEALTH MATTERS; TRI-CITY HUNGER NETWORK; CHINESE CULTURE CONNECTION; SUBSTANCE ABUSE PREVENTION COALITIONS IN MELROSE, MEDFORD, WAKEFIELD, READING AND STONEHAM; THE MALDEN'S PROMISE COALITION; DPH MASS IN MOTION PROGRAMS IN MELROSE-WAKEFIELD, MALDEN, AND EVERETT; AND THE MELROSE, STONEHAM, AND WAKEFIELD ALLIANCES AGAINST VIOLENCE. ONE CENTRAL FOCUS OF HALLMARK HEALTH'S COMMUNITY BENEFITS WORK IS TO CONTINUE TO FOSTER RELATIONSHIPS WITH A WIDER ARRAY OF COMMUNITY GROUPS AND LOCAL LEADERS, INCLUDING FAITH-BASED AND GRASSROOTS ORGANIZATIONS. SUCH RELATIONSHIPS PROVIDE INSIGHT INTO HOW THESE GROUPS VIEW HALLMARK HEALTH SYSTEM'S ROLE IN THEIR COMMUNITY, HOW OUR SYSTEM CAN IMPROVE THE WAYS WE SERVE DIVERSE RESIDENTS, AND HOW THE SYSTEM SHOULD STRENGTHEN COLLABORATION TO BEST MEET DIVERGENT HEALTH NEEDS."

HALLMARK HEALTH'S OVERALL SERVICE AREA IS PRIMARILY WITHIN MIDDLESEX COUNTY, WITH SOME SLIGHT OVERLAP INTO ESSEX AND SUFFOLK COUNTIES. THE HHS COMMUNITY BENEFIT CATCHMENT AREA (AS DEFINED THROUGH THE COMMUNITY HEALTH NEEDS ASSESSMENT PROCESS) INCLUDES THE SIX CORE COMMUNITIES OF MALDEN, MEDFORD, MELROSE, READING, STONEHAM, AND WAKEFIELD, AND THREE SECONDARY COMMUNITIES OF EVERETT, NORTH READING, AND SAUGUS (HEREAFTER REFERRED TO AS ""HHS CB""). THESE COMMUNITIES WERE SELECTED AND APPROVED BY LEADERSHIP BASED ON AN ASSESSMENT OF COMMUNITIES FROM WHICH HHS DRAWS ITS PATIENT POPULATION, COMMUNITIES WHERE HHS HAS AN EXISTING PHYSICAL OR PROGRAM PRESENCE, AS WELL AS LONG STANDING RELATIONSHIPS WITH COMMUNITY STAKEHOLDERS OR ORGANIZATIONS. ADDITIONAL COMMUNITIES ARE SERVED BY THE HOSPITAL'S COMMUNITY-BASED PROGRAMS THAT ARE PROXIMATE TO THE CATCHMENT AREA. FOR EXAMPLE, THE NORTH SUBURBAN WOMEN, INFANTS AND CHILDREN (WIC) PROGRAM SERVES THE TOWNS OF BURLINGTON, WILMINGTON, WINCHESTER, AND WOBURN IN ADDITION TO EIGHT OTHER CATCHMENT AREA CITIES AND TOWNS, AND THE NORTH SUBURBAN CHILD AND FAMILY RESOURCE NETWORK SERVES LYNNFIELD AND WINCHESTER, IN ADDITION TO FIVE OTHER CATCHMENT AREA COMMUNITIES. FOR PURPOSES OF MONITORING LANGUAGE NEEDS AND THE HOSPITAL'S INTERPRETER SERVICES PROGRAM, THE MA DEPARTMENT OF PUBLIC HEALTH DEFINES A 12-COMMUNITY ASSESSMENT AREA FOR REVIEW, CONSISTING OF THE NINE CATCHMENT AREA CITIES AND TOWNS, PLUS THE ADDITIONAL COMMUNITIES OF REVERE, LYNNFIELD, AND WINTHROP, REFLECTING THEIR RELATIVE UTILIZATION OF EMERGENCY DEPARTMENT AND INPATIENT SERVICES OF THEIR POPULATIONS. THE FOLLOWING STATISTICAL AND DEMOGRAPHIC PROFILE OF THE CATCHMENT AREA IS EXCERPTED FROM THE COMPREHENSIVE HHS FY 2013 COMMUNITY HEALTH NEEDS ASSESSMENT: POPULATION SIZE & DENSITY THE HHS CB NINE-COMMUNITY CATCHMENT AREA COVERS 71.7 SQUARE MILES, WITH A TOTAL POPULATION OF 294,024. SIZE AND POPULATION DENSITY VARY BY COMMUNITY, WITH MALDEN AND MEDFORD HAVING THE LARGEST POPULATIONS AT 58,180 AND 55,451 RESPECTIVELY, AND NORTH READING THE SMALLEST, AT 14,536. MALDEN IS THE MOST DENSELY POPULATED COMMUNITY AT 11,408 PEOPLE PER SQUARE MILE, AND NORTH READING THE LEAST DENSELY POPULATED AT 1,077 PEOPLE PER SQUARE MILE. RACE/ETHNICITY & FOREIGN-BORN RESIDENTS COMPARED TO THE STATE OF MASSACHUSETTS, EVERETT, MALDEN AND MEDFORD HAVE LARGER POPULATIONS OF NON-WHITE RESIDENTS. THE REMAINING SIX COMMUNITIES ALL HAVE MOSTLY WHITE POPULATIONS. EVERETT, MALDEN AND MEDFORD ALSO HAVE LARGER POPULATIONS OF FOREIGN-BORN RESIDENTS (35%, 39% AND 21% RESPECTIVELY, COMPARED TO 15% STATEWIDE). IN EVERETT, THE LARGEST PERCENTAGE OF FOREIGN-BORN RESIDENTS IS FROM LATIN AMERICA (75%); IN MALDEN 50% ARE FROM ASIA AND 36% FROM LATIN AMERICA; AND IN MEDFORD 37% ARE FROM LATIN AMERICA, 28% FROM ASIA AND 26% FROM EUROPE. NORTH READING, READING, SAUGUS, STONEHAM AND WAKEFIELD HAVE SMALLER POPULATIONS OF FOREIGN-BORN RESIDENTS COMPARED TO THE STATE AS A WHOLE, RANGING FROM 5% TO 11%, FROM ASIA, EUROPE AND LATIN AMERICA. THE PERCENTAGE OF FOREIGN-BORN RESIDENTS IN MELROSE IS CLOSER TO THE STATE AT 13%, WITH HIGHER PERCENTAGES OF AFRICAN AND ASIAN FOREIGN-BORN RESIDENTS. OVERALL, 20.8% OF THE CATCHMENT AREA POPULATION IS FOREIGN BORN, OF WHICH 42.5% WERE BORN IN CENTRAL AND SOUTH AMERICA, 28.3% IN ASIA, 18.8% IN EUROPE, AND 7.9% IN AFRICA. IN TERMS OF ETHNIC ORIGIN, 7% OF THE CATCHMENT AREA POPULATION IDENTIFIES AS ASIAN, PREDOMINANTLY CHINESE (47.3%), VIETNAMESE (16.8%), INDIAN (16.1%), AND FILIPINO (4.3%). 6.4% OF THE TOTAL POPULATION IDENTIFIES AS HISPANIC/LATINO, INCLUDING A MIX OF CARIBBEAN, CENTRAL AND SOUTH AMERICAN BACKGROUNDS. OF THE POPULATION THAT IDENTIFIED AS LATINO, THE LARGEST GROUPS REPRESENTED INCLUDE SALVADORAN (21.2%), PUERTO RICAN (16.9%), MEXICAN (10.4%), GUATEMALAN (9.1%), DOMINICAN (7.9%), AND COLOMBIAN (7.2%). LANGUAGE BASED ON CENSUS DATA, THE MOST COMMON LANGUAGES SPOKEN IN THE CATCHMENT AREA, BESIDES ENGLISH, INCLUDE SPANISH, PORTUGUESE, CHINESE (MANDARIN AND CANTONESE DIALECTS), ARABIC, AND VIETNAMESE. IN MANY CASES, A MAJORITY OF THE SPEAKERS OF MANY OF THE MOST COMMON LANGUAGES ALSO REPORT THEIR SPOKEN ENGLISH PROFICIENCY AS ""LESS THAN VERY WELL"", INCLUDING PORTUGUESE (53.56%), CHINESE (67.26%), VIETNAMESE (58.59%), AND ARABIC (60.10%). OTHER LESS PREVALENT BUT BECOMING INCREASINGLY MORE COMMON LANGUAGES WITHIN THE CATCHMENT AREA INCLUDE HAITIAN CREOLE, FRENCH, ITALIAN, URDU, KHMER- CAMBODIAN, RUSSIAN, SERBO-CROATIAN, AND VARIOUS AFRICAN DIALECTS. HALLMARK HEALTH INTERPRETER SERVICES REPORTED AN INCREASE OF 1.7% FROM THE PREVIOUS YEAR OF COMPLETED INTERPRETER REQUESTS, WITH 3,500 REQUESTS COMPLETED IN FY 2015/TY 2014. HALLMARK HEALTH CONTRACTS WITH A SERVICE PROVIDER FOR A VARIETY OF LANGUAGE INTERPRETERS AND ALSO WITH THE MASSACHUSETTS COMMISSION FOR THE DEAF AND HARD OF HEARING FOR AMERICAN SIGN LANGUAGE INTERPRETERS (ASL). THE PROGRAM ALSO EMPLOYS PER DIEM STAFF INTERPRETERS TO SUPPLEMENT THE INTERPRETER SERVICES CONTRACT. IN ADDITION, LANGUAGE LINE TELEPHONE INTERPRETER SERVICES ARE AVAILABLE FOR RARELY ENCOUNTERED LANGUAGES OR WHEN TIMELY IN-PERSON INTERPRETER SERVICES CANNOT BE ACCESSED, SUCH AS DURING EMERGENCIES. AGE & BIRTH RATES COMPARED TO MASSACHUSETTS, MEDFORD, MELROSE, SAUGUS, STONEHAM AND WAKEFIELD ALL HAVE LARGER ELDERLY POPULATIONS. EVERETT, NORTH READING AND READING HAVE LARGER POPULATIONS OF CHILDREN, AND THE AGE DISTRIBUTION IN MALDEN IS COMPARABLE TO THE STATE. LOOKING AT THE HHS CB SIX-COMMUNITY CORE CATCHMENT AREA AS A WHOLE, THE BIRTH RATE IS HIGHER THAN IN THE STATE FOR WOMEN AGES 30 TO 44 (74.3 BIRTHS PER 1,000 WOMEN VS. 58.4 BIRTHS PER 1,000 WOMEN STATEWIDE; SEE APPENDIX E). EVERETT, MALDEN, NORTH READING, READING, SAUGUS, AND STONEHAM ALL HAVE HIGHER BIRTH RATES THAN IN THE STATE FOR WOMEN AGES 20 TO 29, AND MALDEN, MEDFORD, MELROSE, READING, STONEHAM, AND WAKEFIELD HAVE HIGHER BIRTH RATES FOR WOMEN AGES 30 TO 44. INCOME, POVERTY & CRIME MEDIAN HOUSEHOLD INCOME LEVELS IN THE HHS CB CATCHMENT AREA RANGE FROM 49,737 IN EVERETT TO 99,130 IN READING, COMPARED TO A STATE MEDIAN INCOME LEVEL OF 64,509. COMPARED TO THE STATE, EVERETT AND MALDEN HAVE HIGHER POVERTY RATES FOR CHILDREN, FAMILIES, AND THE ELDERLY. MEDFORD AND STONEHAM HAVE HIGHER ELDERLY POVERTY RATES. NORTH READING, READING, STONEHAM AND WAKEFIELD - THE COMMUNITIES WITH THE HIGHEST MEDIAN INCOME LEVELS - HAVE LOWER OVERALL POVERTY RATES COMPARED TO THE STATE. CRIME RATES FOR VIOLENT AND PROPERTY CRIMES ARE HIGHER IN EVERETT AND MALDEN THAN IN THE STATE, AND MUCH LOWER THAN IN THE STATE FOR MELROSE, NORTH READING, READING, STONEHAM AND WAKEFIELD. SAUGUS HAS ALMOST TWICE THE STATE RATE OF PROPERTY CRIMES, BUT A LOWER VIOLENT CRIME RATE. EDUCATIONAL ATTAINMENT & UNEMPLOYMENT EDUCATIONAL ATTAINMENT VARIES BY COMMUNITY IN THE HHS CB CATCHMENT AREA. COMPARED TO THE STATE, EVERETT, MALDEN AND SAUGUS HAVE HIGHER PERCENTAGES OF RESIDENTS WITH ONLY A HIGH SCHOOL DEGREE OR LESS. RESIDENTS OF MEDFORD AND STONEHAM HAVE COMPARABLE LEVELS OF EDUCATIONAL ATTAINMENT, AND MELROSE, NORTH READING, READING, AND WAKEFIELD RESIDENTS HAVE HIGHER LEVELS OF EDUCATIONAL ATTAINMENT. SINCE THE COMPLETION OF THE CHNA, UNEMPLOYMENT RATES WITHIN THE CATCHMENT AREA HAVE FALLEN, CONSISTENT WITH TRENDS ACROSS THE COMMONWEALTH. ESTIMATED UNEMPLOYMENT DATA FOR THE END OF FY 2014 SHOWS RATES OF UNEMPLOYMENT IN EACH COMMUNITY AT OR BELOW THE STATEWIDE SEASONALLY ADJUSTED UNEMPLOYMENT RATE OF 5.6%, WITH THE EXCEPTION OF EVERETT AT 6.0% AND SAUGUS AT 5.7% RESPECTIVELY. PUBLIC SCHOOL ENROLLMENT: DEMOGRAPHICS & SPECIAL POPULATIONS THE DEMOGRAPHICS OF THE PUBLIC SCHOOL POPULATIONS IN THE NINE HHS CB TOWNS GENERALLY MIRROR THE DEMOGRAPHICS OF THE TOWNS AS A WHOLE, WITH MELROSE, NORTH READING, READING, STONEHAM, SAUGUS AND WAKEFIELD ALL HAVING LESS THAN 20% NON-WHITE STUDENTS (COMPARED TO 33% NON-WHITE PUBLIC SCHOOL STUDENTS IN THE STATE OF MASSACHUSETTS). EVERETT, MALDEN AND MEDFORD ALL HAVE LARGER NON-WHITE STUDENT POPULATIONS THAN IN THE STATE, WITH EVERETT AND MALDEN HAVING PARTICULARLY HIGH PERCENTAGES OF NON-WHITE PUBLIC SCHOOL STUDENTS (60% AND 67% RESPECTIVELY).

NorthShore also has approximately sixteen full time financial counselors and thirty eight Customer Service agents representing our hospitals, clinics, and physician offices. These counselors and representatives are responsible for helping patients understand their bills and coordinating financial assistance and insurance eligibility when appropriate. Any uninsured patient admitted to our hospitals will have their case reviewed by a financial counselor. NorthShore has also earned Certified Application Counselor Organization (CACO) status with the Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services (CMS). Our counselors are certified and capable of helping patients navigate Medicaid and Insurance Exchange options. Any patient having difficulty paying their portion of the bill or wanting to know if they are eligible for financial assistance will have their case reviewed by calling our centralized Customer Service billing department. Our Customer Service department responds to approximately 1,400 calls per day from patients with questions about their bill or that are unable to pay. In addition to the formal application process for Financial Assistance, NorthShore may also grant Financial Assistance on a presumptive basis. Presumptive Financial Assistance approvals are based upon individual life circumstances such as enrollment in low income government programs with income eligibility below 200 percent of federal poverty level income guidelines or verification of financial indigence through an outside vendor."

MidState coordinates a Community Vision group that interacts with the community to address needs and facilitate responses to identified needs. Through Community Vision, MidState has collaborated with the United Way of Meriden and Wallingford to address food collection and distribution for the needy while also conducting semi-annual food collections within the hospital for distribution to those in need. More specifically, MidState is involved in a Family Zone in Meriden that is modeled after the Harlem Children Zone in New York and provides extended services to families who reside in a targeted segment of the community. MidState representatives also serve on a housing coalition that addresses the need for housing and shelter in its primary service area. Since basic needs, such as food and housing, are tied to health status, MidState's participation in these initiatives alongside the United Way has been important and beneficial to the community the hospital serves. MidState staff is also involved in workforce development activities through a regional board that is focused on training, education, and employment opportunities. This enhances the training of the workforce and also can lead to career opportunities at MidState Medical Center. Furthermore, MidState is proud of the school business partnerships it has in the community, further addressing workforce development efforts among the area's youth and understanding that employment is another factor tied to health status.Since the mid-1990s, MidState has had a close-knit relationship with nearby John Barry Elementary School which has provided opportunities for staff to adopt classrooms and enrich the academic experience of students through read-a-loud days and other classroom activities, as well as promote tailored education to students on important health topics including the signs and symptoms of stroke. By educating students on disease risk factors at an early age, it is the hope that their knowledge base will increase, they will share information with their families and perhaps recognize a health problem in a loved one. Over 20 years ago MidState and its community partners, under the Healthy Meriden initiative, established the Multidisciplinary Geriatric Service Provider Team to bring together all the geriatric service providers in the area to address health issues that the elderly face and how the organizations around the table can better address those issues through collaboration, more coordinated service, and networking. The team still continues to meet monthly and participation is strong. MidState assists with organizing these meetings and serves as a meeting location for the group. Through this specialized team, work is being done to improve the healthcare services available to our aging population.For FY15, the Medical Center expended $4,161 on community building activities as reported on Part II of schedule H and in the narratives above."

The patient would be required to provide documentation of income to determine if he/she is to be considered medically indigent. All patients are eligible to be considered for medically indigent status with the exception of patients with income below 200% of the federal poverty level as these patients are considered for some level of uncompensated care under the financially indigent category."

Some of these are as follows:Kids in MotionKids In Motion is a fun and innovative exercise and nutrition program designed to improve the health of Tri-State area children. It began as a new program in early 2013 as a joint initiative with the Huntington YMCA and other community health partners and even includes a competing hospital, with everyone working together to fight childhood obesity. It is the only program of its kind in West Virginia. At the heart of the program is Kid Fit, a 10-week program to get kids ages 5-14 moving and having fun, while also learning about fitness and nutrition. Weight, body mass index, body fat percentage and blood pressure are tracked throughout the program to measure progress and to customize the program to fit each child. During Kid Fit, children utilize exer-gaming equipment, which combines video games and exercise. Parents are also encouraged to participate and entire families are losing weight and getting healthier because of the program.St. Mary's has committed tremendous financial resources to providing equipment and staff and St. Mary's provided the key leadership role in planning and development of the program. Several local families are already providing testimony about how Kids in Motion has helped them.Total Woman ProgramSt. Mary's Women's Health Program has 5000 members and thousands more are reached with wellness activities and programs held every month of the year. The Total Woman provides free health information and screenings and a chance for members to ask questions of health providers. The coordinator of the program helps women schedule their appointments to fit busy schedules. Fitness EventsThe Annual St. Mary's Tri-State Triathlon was held in August and includes three separate races - a triathlon, triathlon relay and duathlon.

In the duathlon, the swim course is replaced by a 2.9-mile loop run in the opposite direction of the previous loop. Races use computer-chip timing. The event averages 200+ participants each year but it has a wider reaching impact of promoting fitness in the community with news coverage of stories about first time participants and their ability to complete a triathlon. Many family and friends also gather at the event as spectators and some are inspired to compete in the next year's event. www.healthtristate.orgThe St. Mary's Kids Try-A-Triathlon for ages 6-14 was also held in August. Races consist of either a 50- or 100-yard swim, a two- or four-mile bike course, and a one- or two-mile run, depending on the age group. There is a kids camp leading up to this event that helps train young people to participate in the triathlon.

A Steering Committee comprised of health care providers, community-based providers, and local government agencies meets no less than twice a year to oversee a community health improvement plan (CHIP) that was developed utilizing data from a report card and previous community conversations. Four priority health indicators (PHI) are being addressed through a work group structure that includes a designated leader who convenes the group to further develop and refine their action plans. Community stakeholders participated in an April 2014 community forum facilitated by the Center for Health Schools & Communities @ Education Connection. Overall, data obtained from the conversations provided high quality information to frame the beginning of a community health improvement change process in the region. 1. Prevention and Education of Most Prevalent Chronic Diseases/Health Conditions: Obesity, Type 2 diabetes, and hypertension were identified as the most prevalent health conditions in the community. The PHI team goals are to increase healthy eating options, enhance access to physical activities, and promote a universal healthy lifestyle. In July 2014, the PHI team received the YMCA Diabetes Prevention Program Grant which was used to fund their diabetes prevention program. The program began in October 2014, and through December 2015 10 classes had been conducted (average class size of 5.4 participants, average age of 59 years, and 75% of the referrals were from physician offices). Participants exceeded the targeted weight loss goal of 7% (achieved 10.4%) which was supported by consistent program participation, physical activity and food tracker completion. The team also participated in National Walk Day, which garnered over 150 people from the Housatonic Valley Region and formation of 3 community walking groups. The Coalition for Healthy Kids is piloting a ""Walking School Bus"" program with a local school to encourage physical activity. A wellness campaign building on the ""5, 2, 1, 0 Let's Go"" messaging was implemented and the ""Know Your Numbers"" campaign tracked 338 individuals with blood pressure monitoring. 2. Improving Access/Utilization to Substance Abuse and Mental Health Services: Mental health issues and substance abuse continue to be prevalent issues in the community. This PHI team is collaborating with 12 Local Prevention Councils, the CT Prevention Framework, and other entities to increase outreach efforts. Their goals are to identify gaps in services and access, provide education, and increase awareness regarding services and programs. There is awareness to vulnerable target groups in need of enhanced services and supports, such as the homeless population and youth. The team worked to improve education and information dissemination, and supported integration of a ""question-persuade-refer"" model for suicide prevention. Areas of focus targeted prescription drug use, support for community ""drop boxes"" , opiate use, underage drinking, and behavioral health initiates in primary care practices. 3. Improve Assessment and Service Planning to Senior Health: Senior citizens, particularly homebound elderly and immigrants, are in need of assessment and service planning to address their health, housing, and social support needs. The main goal is to increase awareness, services, and education for senior health. This team is supporting and collaborating with the Aging in Place initiatives funded by the Peter and Carmen Lucia Buck Foundation, which includes the ""Safe at Home"" program that delivers home safety items to seniors. Efforts continue to move the Danbury community as a ""livable"" community and to share learnings with adjacent communities. 4. Improve Awareness and Utilization of Existing Health and Social Programs/Services: This team focused on enhancing awareness and utilization of existing programs and services in the community, including support of Infoline 2-1-1 and 5 Health Access CT Assistor sites by target populations. It also established a partnership with FamilyWize to provide promotional materials for distribution to health providers and key community sites. The individual CHIP Steering Committee members, including WCHN, support the importance of shared commitment and responsibility in development and execution of its recommended action plans for health improvement.

The portion of bad debt that reasonably could be attributable to patients who may qualify for financial assistance under the hospital's charity care program (reported in Part III line 3) was calculated by applying the percentage of bad debts by zip code (for which the average household income for each zip code is less than 200% of the federal poverty level) to the total cost of bad debt reported in Part III line 2. Since this portion of bad debt is attributable to patients residing in an area where the average income is less than 200% of the Federal poverty level, it is highly likely these patients would have qualified for the organization's charity care program had they applied. For this reason, we believe the amount, totalling $1,389,399, should be treated as community benefit expense in Part I. As noted above, the organization adopted Accounting Standards Update 2011-07 effective October 1, 2012, which changed the way entities report and disclose certain financial information including the provision for bad debts. See footnote #2 (Significant Accounting Policies) on page 13 of the audited financial statements under the caption ""Allowance for Uncollectible Accounts"" for a description of the organization's reporting of its provision for bad debts.If a patient is determined eligible for financial assistance, the appropriate adjustment is made to the patient account based on their income level.

The Hospital is a 716-bed facility with 57 bassinets and is the only Level 1 trauma center in western Massachusetts, treating the most critical and urgent cases in the region. The hospital is also home to the second-busiest emergency department in Massachusetts. The primary community served by the hospital is defined based on the geographic origins of the hospital's discharges. The hospital's primary community is comprised of 51 ZIP codes in 21 cities and towns: Agawam, Blandford, Brimfield, Chester, Chicopee, East Longmeadow, Granville, Hampden, Holland, Holyoke, Longmeadow, Ludlow, Monson, Palmer, Russell, Southwick, Springfield, Wales, West Springfield, Westfield, and Wilbraham. The 51 ZIP codes collectively and essentially are equivalent to Hampden County. Hampden County has a total population of 464,416.In 2012, the community served by the hospital was comprised of 76% White residents, 9.1% African American residents, 21.8 % Latino residents and 2.1% Asian residents. The Latino community of Hampden County is concentrated in the cities of Holyoke and Springfield, while the African-American community is concentrated in Springfield. In all, 81% of all Latino residents of Hampden County live in either Springfield or Holyoke. Non-White populations are expected to grow faster than White populations in the community. The Asian, American Indian, Black, and Other are expected to have the fastest growth. The growing diversity of the community is important to recognize, given the presence of health disparities. Located in Hampden County along the Connecticut River, Springfield is 27 miles north of Hartford CT, while Boston and New York City are 80 and 134 miles away, respectively. The Springfield Metropolitan Statistical Area (MSA) is the fourth-largest metropolitan area in New England and the county's contiguous urban nuclei is comprised of the central city of Springfield, with a population of 152,998, and the cities of Chicopee (55,453), and Holyoke (40,073). Much of BMC's service area has Medically Underserved Area or Population (MUA/P) designation from the Health Resources and Services Administration (HRSA) while the major towns have Health Professional Shortage Area (HPSA) designation. Within Hampden County, Springfield and the surrounding community, especially Holyoke, have many community risk factors that contribute to poor health, including substance abuse, child abuse and neglect, poverty and unemployment, crime and domestic violence, decreased informal social support networks, and overburdened public schools.For FY 2015 BMC's ethnic mix of inpatient & outpatient patients included 48.08% White; 36.21% Hispanic; 11.45% Black; 1.29% Asian, 0.09% Native American, 2.88% Other. BMC's payer mix of patients included 42.82% Medicare; 28.70% Medicaid; 24.78% Managed Care; 1.23% Non-Managed Care; 2.47% Other. In FY 2015 BMC had 40,569 inpatient discharges and 75,211 emergency service visits. Payer mix for ED visits included 42.45% Medicaid; 1.84% Free Care; 10.78% Healthnet; 0.27% Commonwealth Care; 44.66% Other.BMC is committed to reducing health disparities in Springfield. Our commitment is demonstrated by our investment of significant resources in our three community health centers and pediatric clinic located in Springfield's low-income neighborhoods that have both HPSA and MUA/MUP designation. BMC health centers are primary care first-contact sites for thousands of underserved, low-income people. These community training sites for our Residency Program provide continuity of care for over 130,000 patients annually, most of who reside in an MUA/MUP. BMC provides primary care to a medically-underserved population in Springfield comprised of primarily Latinos and African-Americans. Springfield's black and Latino families fare poorly in comparison to their peers across the state on a myriad of sensitive indicators (e.g., infant deaths per 1,000 live births, low birth weight, births to adolescent mothers, adequacy of prenatal care). Springfield has one of the highest concentrations of MassHealth eligible populations. This low income population has a special health risk and a specific location in the Mason Square and North End neighborhoods with child poverty rates well above 30% and as high as 70% in some small areas."

The cost report segregates the total facility actual expenses into costs for support departments, clinical departments (routine and ancillary) and nonreimburseable departments. The cost report uses appropriate statistical bases to ""step down"" support costs to allowable clinical and nonreimburseable departments. The charges for clinical departments are matched to the total cost for these departments for a cost-to-charge ratio.

For routine departments, a per diem total cost is computed and applied to Medicare program days for the Medicare routine program cost.The organization feels the total shortfall of Medicare reimbursement compared to computed Medicare allowable costs should be treated as community benefit. The hospital improves access to patient care by providing services regardless of a patient's ability to pay or the hospital's ability to receive full cost reimbursement for services. The hospital also relieves the government of a financial burden when it provides care to publically insured patients where reimbursement is less than cost of providing the service."

Becky Clay Christenson, of The Clay Christensen Group, facilitated conversation to prioritize and vet findings from the initial data collection. Jason W. Smith, PhD, consulted on the CHNA and implementation strategy process, documenting method, analyzing data, and synthesizing components into a public document. The CHNA was conducted during Fiscal Year 2013 (September 1, 2012 to August 31, 2013.) in order to prepare documents by the end of the fiscal year. It was determined that existing secondary data, augmented by a key informant survey, would be used to identify and prioritize health indicators. An executive summary and report was then presented to system leadership from Mission and Business Development. Findings were then presented to the Memorial Regional/Richmond Community Operations Team for further review and comment. Finally, a presentation was made to the Bon Secours Richmond Health System Board for final approval prior to being made available to the public.Secondary DataThe core of the secondary data analysis was conducted by CHS in order to develop a Community Health Indicator Profile. The analysis intentionally did not include every possible indicator, but instead focused on key metrics that provide a broad insight into community health. Availability of data sources was also considered in selection of content. In many cases, results can be considered in comparison to Virginia averages. Foundational source of data include: Alteryx, Inc.; Virginia Department of Health; hospital discharge data from Virginia Health Information, Inc.; Health Resources and Administration data. In other cases, data was only readily available at the state or national levels and synthetic estimates were created by CHS in order to further develop the community profile. CHS developed statistical models to produce estimates where local data was not available. This analysis was based on the CDC's Behavioral Risk Factor Surveillance Survey; the Virginia Foundation for Youth's Market Decisions' 2010 Obesity Survey; a report produced for Virginia Healthcare Foundation by Urban Institute; and local demographic characteristics obtained by Alteryx, Inc.

In addition, patient statements request that patients apply for financial assistance, if needed, once any patient financial obligation is determined.Bon Secours is committed to ensuring access to health care services for all. As a health care provider, Bon Secours treats all patients, whether insured, underinsured or uninsured, with dignity, respect and compassion throughout admission, delivery of services, discharge and billing and collection processes. Bon Secours addresses the needs of the uninsured by providing free or reduced fees on hospital services, community outreach efforts to assist with enrollment in Medicaid and other medical coverage programs, including free community-based preventive and primary care services. Bon Secours proactively screens to identify individuals and their families who may qualify for federal, state or local health insurance programs or the Bon Secours Patient Financial Assistance Program (""FAP"") and assist the potential eligible patients through the qualification process. Potentially eligible patients that do not qualify for a federal or state health insurance program are referred to the Financial Assistance Coordinator located in Patient Financial Services for assistance in completing the documentation required to establish FAP eligibility. Patients are responsible for providing the information necessary to complete the documentation. The FAP aids uninsured and underinsured patients who do not qualify for government-sponsored health insurance and who communicate their inability to pay for their medical care. The FAP provides 100% financial assistance to uninsured patients with annual family incomes at or below 200% of the Federal Poverty Guidelines (""FPG""), A sliding scale assistance policy is afforded patients that exceed the income guidelines for 100% assistance. Sliding scale assistance is provided to patients and progressively declines in proportion to the patient's higher income level. Additionally, all uninsured (i.e. self pay) patients are given a reduction to the amount of the full charges for medically necessary services through a community service adjustment (""CSA""). The CSA is market adjusted and based on the payment discount received by other health care payers doing business in the community. For these patients, the FAP also sets a maximum annual family payment liability to ensure that no family suffers a catastrophic financial burden to receive necessary health care services. Based on research conducted by the Tax Foundation, a non partisan tax research group based in Washington DC, the maximum annual family liability is based on a sliding scale determined by the family income and size. In addition, a variety of other potential payment options are available. Bon Secours is dedicated to meeting the needs of non-English speaking patients by having on-site Spanish translators, and other language translation services. In addition, Bon Secours employs a telephone language service which assists in meeting any language needs that arise.

Residents have the highest admission rates for depressive disorders, as well as high rates for several sexually transmitted infections. In addition to new Mainers, people experiencing poverty, homelessness, and mental illness are among Cumberland Countys most vulnerable residents. Residents are served by 241 primary care providers and six hospitals, varying from community hospitals such as Mercy to a large tertiary trauma center. Greater Portlands residents are also served by the presence of a Federally-Qualified Health Center (FQHC) with designation to serve the materially poor and homeless populations."
201642049349300319,010211534,Part VI - Community Building Activities,"Mercy Hospital's community building activities include participating in community events with the Greater Portland Immigrant and Refugee Health Collaborative, Public Health Departments, non-profits, and Portlands Health Equity Department to deliver health education sessions for the general public and vulnerable populations several times throughout the year. In 2015, Mercy provided Marketplace enrollment, Diabetes, and primary care materials at outreach events with the Health Equity Department. Mercys New England Foot and Ankle provides foot care, diabetic screening, and new shoes and socks for 200 homeless persons at the Oxford Street Shelter in Portland in December. Mercy Hospital provides Colonoscopy education to show support for colon health and as a conclusion to National Colorectal Cancer Awareness Month. Visitors are able to stroll through an inflatable, larger-than-life colon replica, taught lifesaving information about colon health, and offered four educational sessions followed by stories from survivors as follows: The Truth About Colon Cancer Dr. Karin Cole, Early Detection Saves Lives Dr. Chris Kleeman; Cutting Edge Treatment Dr. Roger Inhorn and Nutrition and Exercise Saves Lives Joan Lavery McLaughlin and Jennifer Daggett. Mercys Medical Neighborhood is a health collaborative that seeks to provide access to quality healthcare for all uninsured patients in the Greater Portland community through the expansion of our flexible care delivery system. The intent of this model is to promote healthy relationships and rational utilization of services and to reduce the overall cost associated with care of uninsured and underinsured patients. Mercys Emergency Department Care Managers play a critical role in developing a rapport with uninsured patients in the acute setting and engaging the necessary neighborhood resources such as peers, street outreach, or CHOWs to begin the desired transition to a medical home. Experts from area non-profits such as Amistads Peer Support Program, Milestones Homeless Outreach & Mobile Engagement (HOME) Team, outreach workers from the City of Portland, Preble Street, and the Oxford Street Shelter; and Community Health Outreach Workers (CHOWs) from Portlands Health Equity Department respond to the unique needs of the vulnerable patients in Mercys Medical Neighborhood. In 2015, Mercy Hospital advanced 444 individuals for Medicaid Disability, eliminated duplicative or unnecessary care through utilization review, and reduced ED utilization. McAuley Residence, a department of Mercy Hospital, is a comprehensive two-year program for women in early recovery with or without children. In the newly-renovated space that is owned by Community Housing of Maine (CHOM), McAuley Residence expanded from six apartments to fifteen apartments with beautiful common space for the residents to gather such as a community kitchen and large playroom for the children. The program serves women who have experienced addiction, homelessness, trauma, and domestic violence. Mercy Hospital provides the staffing (LMSW, LADC, and Peer Support Worker) at McAuley Residence and provides resources to operate the program annually. Women and their children also have access to the resources of the Mercy Addiction Services, Mercy Primary Care and Specialty Care; and New England Eating Disorders Program as needed. McAuley Residence partners with several area mental health providers, hosts Alcoholics and Narcotics Anonymous meetings, and welcomes community volunteers as both sponsors and mentors. DHHS Child Services and The Opportunity Alliance provide parenting coaches for families; and local colleges, universities, and Portland Adult Education services provide educational opportunities and counseling services. Key Bank provides individualized financial mentoring for the women to foster self-sufficiency and independence. Community Housing of Maine (CHOM, our housing partner) is a non-profit charitable organization that as its core mission provides advocacy, supportive housing, community inclusion, and stability for homeless and special needs populations across the state. CHOM also provides workforce housing for people who can't afford to live near their work. Fairchild Semiconductor provides education funding for women in college and Catherine Morrill provides reduced child care services for the children at McAuley Residence. In 2015, the program provided housing for nineteen women and their twenty one children; and delivered daily programming with intensive individualized coaching around parenting, sobriety, education, financial literacy, mental health, and nutrition. Eighty-two percent of the women, who entered in 2015 remained sober and seven of the fifteen women enrolled in higher education with the intent of completing their respective degree program. Garys House, a department of Mercy Hospital, is a safe, comfortable, and affordable home-away-from-home for families and individuals with loved ones receiving medical treatment in any greater Portland area hospital. Nine individual apartments and beautiful dining area and kitchen facilities provide respite for families. A donation of $15 per night is accepted for those able to pay for lodging. Several local organizations such as the United Way and UNUM volunteer regularly at Garys House. Mercy Hospital also donates $25,000 to the City of Portlands Health Equity Department each year in support of the Community Health Outreach Workers, whose role is to provide health education, outreach, and patient navigation for vulnerable populations."

A majority of Mercy Hospital's governing body is comprised of persons who reside in Mercy's primary service area as evidence of our commitment to promote community."
201642049349300319,010211534,Part VI - Affilated Health Care System Roles and Promotion,"The 2014 Community Health Needs Assessment was conducted by Eastern Maine Healthcare Systems (EMHS) in collaboration with several member/affiliated hospitals and the many public health and community organizations across eight Maine counties. The Community Health Needs Assessment informs initiatives to promote community health across the system as well as within each member hospital local service area. Each member hospital adopts a local implementation strategy and community health improvement plan, tailored to meet local needs.In 2015,substance abuse remains a priority need in Cumberland County. In response, Mercy Hospital integrated addiction services into their primary care center and provided partial hospitalization and intensive outpatient program at the State Street facility. McAuley Residence, a comprehensive program for women with substance use disorder and their children has remarkable outcomes with 82% of the participants remaining clean and sober. Mercy's Medical Neighborhood primary goal is to ensure that the underinsured and uninsured have access to primary care and options for health insurance coverage. All financial counselors at Mercy are Certified Application Counselors and meet with patients at area nonprofits or shelters to complete necessary applications. Outreach efforts in 2015 included area churches and health fairs with the City of Portland to provide chronic disease education, primary care, and enrollment information."

Patients qualifying for financial assistance are recognized as charity care accounts when sufficient information is received to determine their eligibility. Prior to this point, an allowance for doubtful accounts is calculated on uninsured accounts. This allowance is reversed if the account is determined to qualify for financial assistance."

THE HOSPITAL USES FINANCIAL AND OTHER INFORMATION OF SUCH PATIENTS OTHERWISE AVAILABLE TO THE HOSPITAL TO IDENTIFY THOSE patients THAT would qualify for charity care if they completed the paperwork. THE HOSPITAL ANALYZES ITS PAST HISTORY AND IDENTIFIES THE PERCENTAGE OF THE BAD DEBT EXPENSE THAT IS EVENTUALLY REVERSED DUE TO PATIENTS QUALIFYING FOR FINANCIAL ASSISTANCE. THE HOSPITAL APPLIES THAT PERCENTAGE TO THE BAD DEBT EXPENSE TO ESTIMATE THE AMOUNT OF THE HOSPITAL'S BAD DEBT EXPENSE THAT WILL BE FOUND TO BE ATTRIBUTABLE TO PATIENTS ELIGIBLE FOR FINANCIAL ASSISTANCE. The bad debt expense associated with SUCH PATIENTS' ACCOUNTS ARE treated as community benefit.

This ratio is computed using Blessing Hospital's as-filed Medicare cost report. These costs and charges are adjusted to account for items not reimbursed through the cost report such as provider-based physician services. IRS Revenue Ruling 69-545, which established the community benefit standard for nonprofit hospital's states that if a hospital serves patients with government health benefits, including Medicare, then this is an indication that the hospital operates to promote the health of the community. This implies that treating medicare patients is a community benefit."

IN SOME CASES, PCPS WERE ABLE TO REDUCE THE PERCENTAGE OF MISSING TESTS IN THEIR PATIENT PANEL BY >40%. SIGNATURE HEALTHCARE PLANS TO ADVANCE THIS APPROACH TO POPULATION MANAGEMENT AS WE ADDRESS THE HIGH PREVALENCE OF MULTIPLE CHRONIC CONDITIONS. HEART FAILURE DISEASE MANAGEMENT PROGRAMTHE PROGRAM FOCUSES ON HIGH RISK PATIENTS WITH A PRIMARY ADMISSION OF ACUTE DECOMPENSATED HEART FAILURE. WE'VE FOUND SUCCESS THROUGH THE USE OF TEACH BACK IN EDUCATION OF OUR PATIENTS, IMPLEMENTATION OF A HOSPITAL WIDE CASE MANAGEMENT RISK ASSESSMENT TOOL, AND FURTHER EXPANSION OF OUR MULTIDISCIPLINARY ROUNDS INCLUDING REPRESENTATION FROM THE PHARMACY. HOMEWARD BOUND HOMEWARD BOUND, INITIATED IN 2012, MOBILIZED STUDENTS FROM THE BROCKTON HOSPITAL SCHOOL OF NURSING-(SUPERVISED BY NURSING INSTRUCTORS), INTO THE HOMES OF PATIENTS WITH CONGESTIVE HEART FAILURE FOR STATUS CHECKS ON PATIENTS' ADHERENCE TO TREATMENT PLANS PROVIDED UPON HOSPITAL DISCHARGE. TRAVELING IN PAIRS, THE STUDENTS SERVE AS ""HEALTH COACHES"" BY ASSESSING PRE-ESTABLISHED PARAMETERS INCLUDING WEIGHT AND BLOOD PRESSURE AND TRANSMITTING DATA TO THE HOSPITAL'S HOMEWARD BOUND OFFICE FOR EVALUATION BY THE PROGRAM'S NURSING STAFF. AS PART OF THE STUDENTS' CLINICAL ROTATION, HOMEWARD BOUND PROVIDES INVALUABLE KNOWLEDGE AND THE OPPORTUNITY TO SHARPEN VOCATIONAL SKILLS BY WORKING CLOSELY WITH PATIENTS IN THEIR HOMES FOLLOWING HOSPITALIZATIONS FROM CHF. AS A RESULT OF HOMEWARD BOUND'S SUCCESS IN PROVIDING BETTER PATIENT CARE AND REDUCING READMISSIONS AND VISITS TO THE EMERGENCY DEPARTMENT, THE PROGRAM RECENTLY EXPANDED TO ENCOMPASS THE DIAGNOSIS OF CHRONIC OBSTRUCTIVE PULMONARY DISEASE. NEW PARTNERSHIPS WERE ADDED WITH TWO LOCAL NURSING PROGRAMS: MASSASOIT COMMUNITY COLLEGE AND CURRY COLLEGE.THIS REPLICABLE MODEL HAS SHOWN MARKED REDUCTIONS IN EMERGENCY ROOM VISITS, HOSPITAL ADMISSIONS AND VISITS TO CARDIOLOGISTS AND PRIMARY CARE PROVIDERS. THE CHF PROGRAM DEMONSTRATED A DECREASE IN HOSPITAL READMISSION RATES FROM 27% TO 18% FROM THE PROGRAM'S INCEPTION IN 2012 TO THE ELEVEN MONTH PERIOD OF APRIL 2015-FEBRUARY 2016. ALTHOUGH THE ADDITION OF COPD TO THIS PROGRAM IS STILL FAIRLY NEW, WE ARE SEEING THE SAME DECREASE TRAJECTORY AS WITH CHF. READMISSION RATES FOR COPD AVERAGED 14% OVER THE SAME ELEVEN MONTHS, A REDUCTION FROM THE ORIGINAL RATE OF 21%. HEALTHCARE PERFORMANCE IMPROVEMENTIN 2014 SIGNATURE HEALTHCARE INITIATED A PARTNERSHIP WITH HEALTHCARE PERFORMANCE IMPROVEMENT (HPI) TO CONDUCT A SAFETY ASSESSMENT AND DEVELOP AN INTERVENTION PLAN TO REDUCE SERIOUS ADVERSE EVENTS IN THE HOSPITAL BY 50-80% IN TWO YEARS. SIGNATURE HEALTHCARE IDENTIFIED 20 EMPLOYEES FROM ACROSS ALL AREAS OF THE ORGANIZATION TO BECOME SAFETY INSTRUCTORS. THESE INDIVIDUALS RECEIVED CULTURE OF SAFETY INSTRUCTOR TRAINING ALONG WITH A RESOURCE MANUAL. THESE TRAINERS TRAINED 2,761 EMPLOYEES DURING 123 CLASSES FROM SEPTEMBER - OCTOBER 2015. SIGNATURE HEALTHCARE INSTITUTED MANDATORY CULTURE OF SAFETY TRAINING TO ALL NEW EMPLOYEES. WE LAUNCHED AN INTEGRATED EMPLOYEE MARKETING CAMPAIGN TO KEEP PATIENT SAFETY TOP OF MIND FOR EMPLOYEES. IN ADDITION TO THE TRAINING, TOOLS AND PROMOTIONAL MATERIALS WERE PROVIDED. THROUGHOUT THE ORGANIZATION, SAFETY KICKOFF EVENTS WERE HELD TO SHARE AND REINFORCE SAFETY MESSAGES WITH OUR EMPLOYEES. THE EMPLOYEES VIEWED THE CULTURE OF SAFETY VIDEOS AS WELL AS A SPECIAL VIDEO MESSAGE FROM THE CEO. AS REINFORCEMENT FOR THE NEW CULTURE, EMPLOYEES WERE PROVIDED WITH ""CULTURE OF SAFETY"" LANYARDS, RETRACTABLE BADGE HOLDERS, BUTTONS, PENS AND NOTEPADS. THE SAFETY TOOLS AND TONES ARE REINFORCED MONTHLY THROUGHOUT THE ORGANIZATION BY USING POSTERS, STANDEES, ""I CHOOSE SAFETY"" WALL CLINGS, PHONE AND PRINTER STICKERS, CAFETERIA TABLE TENTS AND NAPKINS. THIS YEAR, OVER 35 EMPLOYEES HAVE BEEN CHOSEN ACROSS THE ORGANIZATION AS SAFETY COACHES. THESE COACHES ARE CHARTERED WITH IDENTIFYING, ADVISING, AND PROMOTING SPECIFIC SAFETY TOOLS AND TONES TO HELP KEEP OUR PATIENTS AND EMPLOYEES FREE FROM HARM. PRE-DIABETES PILOTAT THE BEGINNING OF FY 14, THE SIGNATURE HEALTHCARE BRIDGEWATER OFFICE CREATED A PROGRAM AIMED AT REDUCING THE PERCENTAGE OF PATIENTS WITH RISK FACTORS FOR PRE-DIABETES. THE FIRST CHALLENGE WAS HOW TO IDENTIFY THE TARGET POPULATION. A PRE-VISIT PREPARATION WORKSHEET FOR MEDICAL ASSISTANTS TO COMPLETE PRIOR TO PATIENT APPOINTMENTS WAS DEVELOPED. THE MEDICAL ASSISTANTS RECORDED THE PATIENT'S LAST HEMOGLOBIN A1C RESULT AND SCREENING NEED BASED ON AGE (45 OR OLDER) OR BMI (25 OR GREATER). THE PATIENTS WERE THEN FLAGGED WHEN THEY WERE IN NEED OF SCREENING AT POINT OF SERVICE. THE OFFICE DEVELOPED STANDARD REPORTS FOR USE WITHIN THE PRACTICE TO MONITOR THE 'AT RISK' POPULATION'S SCREENING DEFECT RATE OVER TIME. A FOUR COMPONENT SCREENING PROCESS WAS DEVELOPED. FIRST, IMPLEMENTATION OF POINT OF CARE HBA1C TESTING, WHERE RESULTS WERE DETERMINED WITHIN 3 MINUTES AFTER SPECIMEN COLLECTION. SECOND, CLINICAL STAFF PERFORMED TESTING BASED ON STANDING ORDERS WITH RESULTS AVAILABLE BEFORE PROVIDERS ENTERED THE EXAM ROOM. THIS STANDARD PROCESS ALLOWED THE PRIMARY CARE PHYSICIAN TO PROVIDE REAL TIME INTERVENTION AT THE TIME OF THE APPOINTMENT. THIRD, THE OFFICE TOOK STEPS TO ASSIST THE PATIENT IN MANAGING LIFESTYLE CHANGES. PATIENT EDUCATION MATERIALS WERE DEVELOPED WITH INFORMATION ABOUT HEALTHY EATING AND PHYSICAL ACTIVITY. SIGNATURE HEALTHCARE PARTNERED WITH THE OLD COLONY YMCA DIABETES PREVENTION PROGRAM (DPP) TO PROVIDE LIFESTYLE COACHING AFTER HOURS. FOURTH, RESOURCES WERE LEVERAGED WITHIN THE PRACTICE, SUCH AS NUTRITION COUNSELING AND ENDOCRINOLOGY CONSULTS TO MEET A PATIENT'S NEEDS. IN THE FIRST YEAR OF THIS PROJECT, 2,755 PATIENTS WERE SCREENED WITHIN THE 6,100 PATIENT PRIMARY CARE PRACTICE, REDUCING THE SCREENING DEFECT RATE FROM 85% TO 29%. OF THIS, 988 PATIENTS (36.3%) WERE DIAGNOSED WITH PRE-DIABETES AND 49 PATIENTS DIAGNOSED WITH TYPE 2 DIABETES. OF THE PATIENTS DIAGNOSED WITH PRE-DIABETES, OVER 64% LOST WEIGHT OVER THE COURSE OF THE YEAR, WITH 31% LOSING AT LEAST 5% OF THEIR BODY WEIGHT. AS ANTICIPATED, THE PRE-DIABETIC PATIENT'S WEIGHT LOSS GENERATED A CORRESPONDING IMPROVEMENT IN HEMOGLOBIN A1C LEVELS WITH 72% OF PRE-DIABETIC PATIENTS HBA1C DECREASING OVER BASELINE, AND 25% OF PRE-DIABETIC PATIENTS ACHIEVING NORMAL HBA1C VALUES. ONE HUNDRED PERCENT OF PATIENTS WHO PARTICIPATED IN THE YMCA DPP PROGRAM IN FY 15 ACHIEVED AT LEAST 5% WEIGHT LOSS AND REDUCED THEIR A1C'S TO BELOW THE PRE-DIABETIC RANGE. A SECOND SESSION OF THE YMCA DIABETES PREVENTION PROGRAM BEGAN WITHIN SIGNATURE MEDICAL GROUP IN JANUARY 2016. SIGNATURE HEALTHCARE/WALGREENS PHARMACY PROGRAMSIGNATURE HEALTHCARE PHARMACY AND WALGREENS PARTNERED IN 2012 TO PROVIDE DISCHARGE MEDICATIONS TO PATIENTS AT THE BEDSIDE. A WALGREENS EMPLOYEE VISITS THE PATIENT, FILLS THE MEDICATIONS AND RETURNS THEM TO THE PATIENT BEFORE DISCHARGE. APPROXIMATELY 100 PATIENTS PER MONTH PARTICIPATE IN THIS PROGRAM. MOST IMPORTANTLY FOR OUR PATIENTS, THIS PROGRAM MEANS MORE PERSONAL ATTENTION AND HELP UNDERSTANDING HOW AND WHEN TO TAKE NEW DRUGS, AS WELL AS WHICH DRUGS MIGHT CONFLICT WITH DRUGS THEY'RE ALREADY TAKING AT HOME. PATIENT COMPLIANCE WITH MEDICATION REGIMENS IS KEY TO IMPROVING AND MAINTAINING GOOD HEALTH - AVOIDING HOSPITAL READMISSIONS."

NEBH WORKS WITH ALL SEGMENTS OF THE POPULATION BUT IN RECOGNITION OF ITS STRONG TIES TO ITS SURROUNDING COMMUNITY AND ITS SPECIFIC CLINICAL EXPERTISE, NEBH FOCUSES ITS COMMUNITY BENEFIT EFFORTS ON IMPROVING THE HEALTH AND WELL-BEING OF THE LOW INCOME, UNDERSERVED POPULATIONS LIVING IN MISSION HILL AND ROXBURY AND ON MUSCULOSKELETAL HEALTH. NEBH CURRENTLY OPERATES NUMEROUS EDUCATIONAL, OUTREACH, AND COMMUNITY-STRENGTHENING INITIATIVES, COLLABORATES WITH MANY OF THE COMMUNITY'S LEADING SERVICE ORGANIZATIONS. THE HOSPITAL CONTRIBUTES OVER $2.5 MILLION ANNUALLY TO SUPPORT ITS COMMUNITY BENEFIT COMMITMENTS AND THE MASSACHUSETTS UNCOMPENSATED CARE POOL. NEBH IS EAGER TO EXPLORE WAYS THAT IT CAN FURTHER ENGAGE AND ENRICH ITS CONNECTIONS TO THE COMMUNITY.THIS REPORT AND ASSOCIATED COMMUNITY HEALTH IMPROVEMENT PLAN IS THE CULMINATION OF FOUR MONTHS OF WORK. THIS PROJECT WAS BORNE LARGELY OUT OF NEBH'S DESIRE TO BETTER UNDERSTAND AND ADDRESS THE HEALTH-RELATED NEEDS OF THOSE LIVING IN ITS SURROUNDING COMMUNITY. HOWEVER, THE PROJECT ALSO FULFILLS LONG-STANDING REQUIREMENTS OF THE MASSACHUSETTS ATTORNEY GENERAL'S OFFICE AND A NEW FEDERAL INTERNAL REVENUE SERVICE (IRS) REQUIREMENTS, WHICH MANDATE THAT ALL NONPROFIT HOSPITALS CONDUCT A PERIODIC COMMUNITY HEALTH NEEDS ASSESSMENT (CHNA) AND STRATEGIC PLANNING PROCESS. THE COMMONWEALTH REQUIRES NONPROFIT HOSPITALS AND MANAGED CARE ORGANIZATIONS TO UPDATE THEIR CHNAS EVERY YEAR AND THE IRS REQUIRES THAT A CHNA BE CONDUCTED EVERY THREE YEARS. MORE SPECIFICALLY, THE COMMONWEALTH AND IRS REGULATIONS REQUIRE THAT NEBH ASSESS COMMUNITY HEALTH NEED, ENGAGE THE COMMUNITY, IDENTIFY PRIORITY HEALTH ISSUES, AND CREATE A COMMUNITY HEALTH STRATEGY THAT DESCRIBES HOW THE HOSPITAL, IN COLLABORATION WITH THE COMMUNITY AND LOCAL HEALTH DEPARTMENT, WILL ADDRESS THE NEEDS AND THE PRIORITIES IDENTIFIED BY THE ASSESSMENT.IN LIGHT OF THESE REQUIREMENTS, NEBH HIRED JOHN SNOW, INC. (JSI), A NATIONALLY RECOGNIZED PUBLIC HEALTH CONSULTING FIRM, TO CONDUCT A COMPREHENSIVE COMMUNITY HEALTH NEEDS ASSESSMENT FOCUSING ON MISSION HILL AND ROXBURY, ITS PRIMARY SERVICE AREA WITH RESPECT TO ITS COMMUNITY BENEFIT INITIATIVES. THE OVERALL GOAL OF THE ASSESSMENT WAS TO COMPILE INFORMATION FROM A RANGE OF QUANTITATIVE AND QUALITATIVE SOURCES TO CLARIFY THE HEALTH CARE NEEDS AND PRIORITIES OF COMMUNITY RESIDENTS AND ASSESS THE OVERALL STRENGTHS AND WEAKNESSES OF THE AREA'S HEALTH AND SOCIAL SERVICE SYSTEMS. ULTIMATELY, THE PURPOSE OF THE ASSESSMENT WAS TO FACILITATE THE DEVELOPMENT OF A STRATEGIC PLAN THAT WOULD GUIDE HOW NEBH WOULD WORK WITH STAKEHOLDERS IN MISSION AND HILL AND ROXBURY TO STRENGTHEN THE COMMUNITY AND IMPROVE HEALTH STATUS MOVING FORWARD. THE CHNA WAS CONDUCTED IN THREE PHASES:- PHASE I: THE JSI PROJECT TEAM CONDUCTED A PRELIMINARY NEEDS ASSESSMENT THAT RELIED HEAVILY ON QUANTITATIVE HEALTH-RELATED DATA DRAWN FROM THE MASSACHUSETTS COMMUNITY HEALTH INFORMATION PROFILE (MASSCHIP) SYSTEM AS WELL AS OTHER NATIONAL, STATE, AND LOCAL SOURCES. THESE DATA ALLOWED THE JSI PROJECT TEAM TO UNDERSTAND THE UNDERLYING CHARACTERISTICS OF AREA RESIDENTS AND IDENTIFY THE SPECIFIC SEGMENTS OF THE COMMUNITY MOST AT-RISK. - PHASE II: JSI CONDUCTED A SERIES OF INTERVIEWS WITH KEY STAKEHOLDERS AND TWO FOCUS GROUPS WITH COMMUNITY MEMBERS. THE FOCUS GROUPS HELPED THE JSI PROJECT TEAM TO ENGAGE THE COMMUNITY AND BETTER UNDERSTAND THEIR HEALTH STATUS, HEALTH-SEEKING BEHAVIORS, SERVICE GAPS, HEALTH-RELATED CHALLENGES, AND PRIORITIES. - PHASE III: CHRISTINE DWYER, DIRECTOR OF PUBLIC AFFAIRS AND COMMUNITY RELATIONS, AND BETH GREENSPAN, VICE PRESIDENT, CHIEF STRATEGY OFFICER, WORKED WITH JSI TO INTEGRATE THE CHNA'S FINDINGS, INCLUDING FEEDBACK FROM NEBH STAFF AND THE COMMUNITY, AND DEVELOPED NEBH'S COMMUNITY HEALTH IMPROVEMENT PLAN. IN PHASE III, JSI ALSO DEVELOPED A FINAL CHNA REPORT, OBTAINED APPROVAL FOR ITS COMMUNITY HEALTH IMPROVEMENT PLAN FROM NEBH'S BOARD OF TRUSTEES, AND DISSEMINATED THE RESULTS OF THE PROJECT TO INTERNAL AND EXTERNAL STAKEHOLDERS.THE CHNA UTILIZED A PARTICIPATORY, COLLABORATIVE APPROACH TO LOOK AT HEALTH IN ITS BROADEST CONTEXT. AS NOTED ABOVE, THE ASSESSMENT PROCESS INCLUDED SYNTHESIZING EXISTING DATA ON SOCIAL, ECONOMIC, AND HEALTH INDICATORS IN THE REGION AS WELL AS INFORMATION FROM COMMUNITY DIALOGUES CONDUCTED WITH COMMUNITY RESIDENTS, AND INTERVIEWS WITH COMMUNITY STAKEHOLDERS. (SCHEDULE H, PART V, SECTION B, QUESTION 5). NEBH CONDUCTED THIS CHNA PROCESS INDEPENDENTLY AS REPORTED IN SCHEDULE H, PART V, SECTION B, QUESTIONS 6A AND 6B.COMMUNITY HEALTH NEEDS ASSESSMENT - KEY FINDINGSTHE FOLLOWING ARE KEY FINDINGS RELATED TO COMMUNITY CHARACTERISTICS AND THE DETERMINANTS OF HEALTH FOR NEBH'S COMMUNITY BENEFIT SERVICE AREA. SINCE MISSION HILL IS THE DOMINANT GEOGRAPHY IN NEBH'S COMMUNITY BENEFIT SERVICE AREA, THE FOCUS OF THIS SUMMARY IS ON MISSION HILL AS COMPARED TO ROXBURY AND BOSTON OVERALL- AGE: MISSION HILL'S POPULATION HAS LARGER PROPORTIONS OF OLDER ADULTS (65+) AND SMALLER PROPORTIONS OF CHILDREN (<18) THAN THE POPULATIONS IN ROXBURY AND BOSTON OVERALL. WITH RESPECT TO AGE, THE MOST STRIKING FINDING IS THE EXTREMELY LARGE PROPORTION OF YOUNG ADULTS (COLLEGE STUDENTS) THAT RESIDE IN MISSION HILL COMPARED TO ROXBURY AND BOSTON OVERALL, WHICH SKEWS THE AGE DISTRIBUTION. MORE THAN 40% (40.2%) OF MISSION HILL'S POPULATION IS BETWEEN 18 AND 24 YEARS OLD, COMPARED TO 16.4 FOR ROXBURY AND 19.0% FOR BOSTON OVERALL."
201622259349303862,042103612,"SCHEDULE H, PART VI, LINES 1 & 2, PART V, SECTION B, LINES 1-9:","NEEDS ASSESSMENT CONTINUED- RACE/ETHNICITY, FOREIGN BORN STATUS, AND LANGUAGE: THE PROPORTION OF RACIAL/ETHNIC MINORITY POPULATIONS IN MISSION HILL IS HIGH RELATIVE TO THE COMMONWEALTH OF MASSACHUSETTS OVERALL BUT MIRRORS THE PROPORTIONS IN BOTH ROXBURY AND BOSTON OVERALL. HOWEVER, THE SPECIFIC CHARACTERISTICS OF THE RACIAL/ETHNIC MINORITY POPULATION IN MISSION HILL ARE VERY DIFFERENT. IN MISSION HILL THERE ARE MUCH LARGER PERCENTAGES OF ASIAN RESIDENTS AND SMALLER PROPORTIONS OF AFRICAN AMERICAN AND HISPANIC RESIDENTS COMPARED TO ROXBURY. ACROSS MISSION HILL, ROXBURY, AND BOSTON OVERALL, MORE THAN ONE-THIRD OF THE POPULATIONS ARE FOREIGN BORN AND MORE THAN ONE-THIRD OF THE POPULATIONS SPEAK A LANGUAGE OTHER THAN ENGLISH AT HOME. THERE ARE CLEAR AND WELL-RECOGNIZED HEALTH DISPARITIES AMONG RACIAL/ETHNIC MINORITY AND FOREIGN POPULATIONS COMPARED TO THE MAJORITY NON-HISPANIC WHITE POPULATION. IN ADDITION, THERE ARE SIGNIFICANT HEALTH LITERACY ISSUES AMONG RACIAL/ETHNIC MINORITIES, PARTICULARLY WITH FOREIGN-BORN POPULATIONS AND FOR THOSE WITH LIMITED ABILITY TO SPEAK ENGLISH. - INCOME/POVERTY: LARGE PROPORTIONS OF THE POPULATIONS IN MISSION HILL AND ROXBURY LIVE IN POVERTY (< 100% OF THE FEDERAL POVERTY LEVEL - FPL) OR LOW-INCOME HOUSEHOLDS (< 200% FPL) AND STRUGGLE TO PAY FOR FOOD AND OTHER BASIC HOUSEHOLD ITEMS. IN MISSION HILL 39% OF THE HOUSEHOLDS ARE LIVING IN POVERTY, COMPARED TO 35% IN ROXBURY, AND 21% IN BOSTON OVERALL. THE SIGNIFICANT AND NEGATIVE IMPACTS OF POVERTY WERE ALSO DISCUSSED IN NEARLY ALL OF INTERVIEWS AND IN EACH FOCUS GROUP. THE MISSION HILL FIGURES ARE SOMEWHAT SKEWED BY THE LARGE NUMBERS OF COLLEGE STUDENTS THAT LIVE IN THE AREA AND DO NOT HAVE A REGULAR INCOME. IF THESE YOUNG ADULTS LIVING IN NON-FAMILY HOUSEHOLDS ARE TAKEN OUT OF THE ANALYSIS, MISSION HILL FAIRS SLIGHTLY BETTER THAN ROXBURY. HOWEVER, POVERTY AND ITS IMPACTS ARE STILL MAJOR ISSUE FOR MISSION HILL'S FAMILIES AND OTHER MORE PERMANENT RESIDENTS. - EDUCATION: COMPARED TO BOSTON, RESIDENTS OF MISSION HILL ARE LESS LIKELY TO HAVE A HIGH SCHOOL DIPLOMA. COMPARED TO ROXBURY, HOWEVER, MISSION HILL RESIDENTS ARE MORE LIKELY TO HAVE A HIGH SCHOOL DIPLOMA. ONCE AGAIN, THIS DATA IS SKEWED BY THE HIGH NUMBER OF TRANSIENT YOUNG ADULT RESIDENTS WHO ATTEND BOSTON'S MANY UNIVERSITIES AND COLLEGES AND LIVE IN MISSION HILL.- LACK OF EMPLOYMENT, THE ECONOMIC DOWNTURN, AND ITS IMPACTS: WHILE MISSION HILL RESIDENTS APPEAR BETTER OFF THAN RESIDENTS OF ROXBURY ON THIS ISSUE, A LARGE PROPORTION OF THE MISSION HILL POPULATION ARE EITHER UNEMPLOYED OR DO NOT CONSIDER THEMSELVES PART OF THE WORKFORCE. THE UNEMPLOYMENT RATE IN MISSION HILL FOR PEOPLE OVER THE AGE OF 16 YEARS OLD IS JUST 8.1%, COMPARED TO 16.5% IN ROXBURY AND 10.2% IN BOSTON OVERALL. HOWEVER, IN ORDER TO GET A CLEAR PICTURE OF THIS ISSUE ONE MUST ALSO CONSIDER THE NUMBER AND PROPORTION OF THE POPULATION WHO DO NOT CONSIDER THEMSELVES PART OF THE WORKFORCE. IN MISSION HILL NEARLY 40% (5,873) OF THE 16-YEAR-OLD-AND-OVER POPULATION DOES NOT CONSIDER ITSELF TO BE PART OF LABOR FORCE, WHICH MEANS THAT 41% (5,873) OF THE TOTAL POPULATION IS NOT EMPLOYED. VIEWED IN THIS MANNER, MISSION HILL IS STILL BETTER OFF THAN ROXBURY BUT NOT NEARLY TO THE EXTENT THAT UNEMPLOYMENT FIGURES ALONE SUGGEST. IN ROXBURY, 51% (17,837) OF THE POPULATION IS NOT EMPLOYED AND IN BOSTON OVERALL THE FIGURE, NOT SURPRISINGLY, IS MUCH LOWER AT 38% (199,006). UNEMPLOYMENT AND THE IMPACT THAT THE ECONOMIC DOWNTURN HAS HAD ON THE MISSION HILL COMMUNITY OVER THE PAST 3-5 YEARS WAS ONE OF THE DOMINANT, IF NOT THE MOST DOMINANT, THEMES IN THE INTERVIEWS AND FOCUS GROUPS. LACK OF EMPLOYMENT OPPORTUNITIES FOR MISSION HILL'S YOUTH AND ADULTS HAS GREATLY IMPACTED THEIR ABILITY TO PROVIDE FOOD AND OTHER BASIC HOUSEHOLD ITEMS, TO SAY NOTHING OF OTHER COMFORTS THAT MANY TAKE FOR GRANTED. THESE ISSUES HAVE ALSO IMPACTED PEOPLE'S EMOTIONAL HEALTH AND LED TO ISOLATION, PARTICULARLY FOR OLDER ADULTS ON LIMITED FIXED INCOMES. CERTAINLY, POVERTY, UNEMPLOYMENT, ISOLATION, AND EMOTIONAL WELL-BEING ARE IMPORTANT DETERMINANTS OF HEALTH AND WELLNESS. - FOOD INSECURITY: ANOTHER DOMINANT THEME FROM THE INTERVIEWS AND FOCUS GROUPS WAS THE LACK OF ACCESS TO AFFORDABLE, HEALTHY FOODS. INTERVIEWEES AND FOCUS GROUP PARTICIPANTS DISCUSSED THE FACT THAT THERE ARE FEW PLACES FOR RESIDENTS OF MISSION HILL AND ROXBURY TO BUY REASONABLY PRICED FRESH VEGETABLES AND OTHER NUTRITIONAL FOODS. PARTICIPANTS ALSO SPOKE OF THE HIGH PRICES AND LACK OF FRESH VEGETABLES AT THE LARGE, LOCAL GROCERY STORES IN THE AREA AND THE LONG DISTANCES THAT THEY HAD TO TRAVEL TO ACCESS MORE AFFORDABLE HEALTHY FOOD OPTIONS.- TRANSPORTATION: GIVEN THE STEEP AND HILLY LANDSCAPE OF MISSION HILL, TRANSPORTATION WAS SEEN AS A MAJOR BARRIER AND DETERMINANT OF HEALTH AND WELL-BEING. LACK OF TRANSPORTATION WAS A LEADING THEME FROM THE ASSESSMENT INTERVIEWEES AND FOCUS GROUP PARTICIPANTS, ESPECIALLY FOR OLDER ADULT AND LOW-INCOME RESIDENTS LACKING A PERSONAL VEHICLE. INTERVIEWEES AND FOCUS GROUP PARTICIPANTS DISCUSSED CHALLENGES RELATED TO NAVIGATING THE HILLY TERRAIN ON MISSION HILL, THE ISOLATION THAT THOSE WITHOUT A PERSONAL CAR EXPERIENCED, THE NECESSITY FOR MANY TO TRAVEL OUTSIDE THE MISSION HILL AREA TO FIND AFFORDABLE FOOD AND OTHER BASIC ITEMS, AND THE IMPORTANCE OF THE MISSION LINK PUBLIC TRANSPORTATION SERVICE. - ACCESS TO RECREATIONAL FACILITIES: DESPITE THE DENSITY OF THE MISSION HILL COMMUNITY, ACCESS TO RECREATIONAL FACILITIES AND OPEN SPACES IS ONE OF MISSION HILL'S ASSETS. THERE ARE A NUMBER OF PARKS, RECREATIONAL AREAS, AND INDOOR COMMUNITY CENTERS. AS WILL BE DISCUSSED LATER IN THE REPORT, A HIGH PROPORTION OF THE POPULATION IS OVERWEIGHT AND DOES NOT GET REGULAR PHYSICAL EXERCISE, BUT NOT NECESSARILY BECAUSE RECREATIONAL FACILITIES OR OPEN SPACES ARE IN SHORT SUPPLY. - VIOLENCE: RATES OF HOMICIDE AND NON-FATAL GUNSHOT WOUNDS SEEN IN THE CITY'S HOSPITAL EMERGENCY DEPARTMENTS ARE CONSIDERABLY HIGHER IN ROXBURY (INCLUDING MISSION HILL) THAN IN BOSTON OVERALL. WHILE THERE WAS A CLEAR CONSENSUS AMONG INTERVIEWEES AND FOCUS GROUP PARTICIPANTS THAT THIS ISSUE HAD IMPROVED DRAMATICALLY OVER THE PAST 2 DECADES AND THAT MISSION HILL WAS CONSIDERABLY SAFER THAN ROXBURY OVERALL, THIS GROUP AGREED THAT VIOLENCE STILL HAD A MAJOR IMPACT ON THE COMMUNITY. VIOLENCE NEGATIVELY AFFECTS THE HEALTH OF THOSE DIRECTLY INVOLVED BUT ALSO HAS MAJOR NEGATIVE EMOTIONAL EFFECTS ON THOSE WHO ARE INDIRECTLY INVOLVED AND THE COMMUNITY MORE BROADLY. THESE IMPACTS INCLUDE MENTAL HEALTH ISSUES, ISOLATION, AND LACK OF COMMUNITY COHESION. NEARLY EVERYONE WHO WAS INTERVIEWED OR INVOLVED IN FOCUS GROUPS DISCUSSED THE IMPACTS OF VIOLENCE AND ITS ASSOCIATED TRAUMA, PARTICULARLY ON THE AREA'S YOUTH AND THEIR FAMILIES. NEARLY EVERYONE WE TALKED WITH SAID THAT THEY KNEW SOMEONE WHO HAD BEEN IMPACTED DIRECTLY BY VIOLENCE AND UNDERSTOOD FIRST-HAND THE TOLL IT TOOK ON THE COMMUNITY. - COMMUNITY HEALTH NEEDS ASSESSMENT - COMMUNITY HEALTH PRIORITIESTHE CHNA'S APPROACH PROVIDED AMPLE OPPORTUNITY TO VET THE QUANTITATIVE AND QUALITATIVE DATA COMPILED DURING THE ASSESSMENT. IN ADDITION, INTERVIEW AND FOCUS GROUP PARTICIPANTS WERE ASKED WHAT THEY PERCEIVED TO BE THE LEADING COMMUNITY HEALTH PRIORITIES. ULTIMATELY, THERE WAS LITTLE DEBATE THAT THE MOST SIGNIFICANT HEALTH-RELATED ISSUE FACING THE COMMUNITIES SURROUNDING NEBH WAS THE BROADER 1) SOCIAL AND ECONOMIC DETERMINANTS (E.G., POVERTY, UNEMPLOYMENT, FOOD INSECURITY, VIOLENCE, TRANSPORTATION), WHICH PREVENT MANY RESIDENTS, PARTICULARLY LOW INCOME, RACIAL/ETHNIC MINORITY, AND OLDER ADULT RESIDENTS FROM MAINTAINING A HEALTHY LIFESTYLE AND/OR ACCESSING THE REGULAR PREVENTIVE AND ACUTE HEALTH SERVICES THEY NEED. IN ADDITION TO THIS UNDERLYING PRIORITY, 2) ISSUES RELATED OBESITY, LACK OF PHYSICAL EXERCISE, AND POOR NUTRITION AS WELL AS THE CHRONIC DISEASES THAT ARE OFTEN ASSOCIATED WITH THESE FACTORS WERE SEEN AS ANOTHER PRIORITY. FINALLY, ISSUES RELATED TO 3) ELDER HEALTH (E.G., GENERAL HEALTH AND WELLNESS, FALLS PREVENTION, ISOLATION/DEPRESSION, OSTEOPOROSIS, CHRONIC DISEASE) WERE ALSO A PRIORITY. THIS IS PARTICULARLY TRUE IF ONE PRIORITIZES THE MORE PERMANENT RESIDENTS OF THE COMMUNITY, WHO ARE DISPROPORTIONATELY OLDER THAN THE COMMUNITY OVERALL."

THE HOSPITAL OFFERS THIS CARE FOR ALL PATIENTS THAT COME TO OUR FACILITY 24 HOURS A DAY, SEVEN DAYS A WEEK, AND 365 DAYS A YEAR. THE HOSPITAL ASSISTS PATIENTS IN OBTAINING FINANCIAL ASSISTANCE FROM PUBLIC PROGRAMS AND OTHER SOURCES WHENEVER APPROPRIATE. TO REMAIN VIABLE AS IT FULFILLS ITS MISSION, THE HOSPITAL MUST MEET ITS FIDUCIARY RESPONSIBILITY TO APPROPRIATELY BILL AND COLLECT FOR MEDICAL SERVICES PROVIDED TO PATIENTS. IT IS IMPORTANT TO NOTE THAT WHILE THE FEDERAL AND STATE GOVERNMENT USES DIFFERENT NAMES FOR THE POLICIES THAT HOSPITAL MUST FOLLOW TO SHOW HOW THEY ARE PROVIDING FINANCIAL ASSISTANCE TO PATIENTS; THE OVERALL REQUIREMENTS ARE THE SAME. AS A RESULT, NEBH'S POLICY IS DESIGNED TO COMPLY WITH BOTH THE STATE HEALTH SAFETY NET REGULATIONS ON ""CREDIT AND COLLECTION POLICIES AND THE FEDERAL HEALTHCARE REFORM LAW'S ""FINANCIAL ASSISTANCE POLICY"" REQUIREMENTS. TO THAT END, NEBH HAS REVIEWED THE FINAL REGULATIONS UNDER INTERNAL REVENUE CODE SECTION 501(R) ISSUED BY THE TREASURY ON DECEMBER 29, 2015 AND IS, OR WILL BE, IN COMPLIANCE WITH THOSE REGULATIONS ON OR BEFORE OCTOBER 1, 2016 AS REQUIRED.

GENERAL PRINCIPLESFINANCIAL ASSISTANCE IS INTENDED TO ASSIST LOW-INCOME PATIENTS WHO DO NOT OTHERWISE HAVE THE ABILITY TO PAY FOR THEIR HEALTH CARE SERVICES. SUCH ASSISTANCE TAKES INTO ACCOUNT EACH INDIVIDUAL'S ABILITY TO CONTRIBUTE TO THE COST OF HIS OR HER CARE. FOR THOSE PATIENTS THAT ARE UNINSURED OR UNDERINSURED, THE HOSPITAL WILL WORK WITH THEM TO ASSIST WITH APPLYING FOR AVAILABLE FINANCIAL ASSISTANCE PROGRAMS THAT MAY COVER ALL OR SOME OF THEIR UNPAID HOSPITAL BILLS. THE HOSPITAL PROVIDES THIS ASSISTANCE FOR BOTH RESIDENTS AND NON-RESIDENTS OF MASSACHUSETTS; HOWEVER, THERE MAY NOT BE COVERAGE IN A STATE PUBLIC ASSISTANCE PROGRAM FOR A MASSACHUSETTS HOSPITAL'S SERVICES THROUGH AN OUT-OF STATE RESIDENT. IN ORDER FOR THE HOSPITAL TO ASSIST UNINSURED AND UNDERINSURED PATIENTS FIND THE MOST APPROPRIATE COVERAGE OPTIONS AS WELL AS DETERMINE IF THE PATIENT IS FINANCIALLY ELIGIBLE FOR ANY DISCOUNTS IN PAYMENTS, PATIENTS MUST ACTIVELY WORK WITH HOSPITALS TO VERIFY THE PATIENT'S DOCUMENTED FAMILY INCOME, OTHER INSURANCE COVERAGE, AND ANY OTHER INFORMATION THAT COULD BE USED IN DETERMINING ELIGIBILITY. 2. ENROLLMENT IN A PUBLIC ASSISTANCE PROGRAMHOSPITALS HAVE NO ROLE IN SPECIFICALLY DETERMINING THE ELIGIBILITY FOR ENROLLMENT WITHIN A PUBLIC ASSISTANCE PROGRAM. IN MASSACHUSETTS, INDIVIDUALS APPLY FOR COVERAGE IN MASSHEALTH, THE PREMIUM ASSISTANCE PAYMENT PROGRAM OFFERED THROUGH THE HEALTH CONNECTOR (INCLUDING CONNECTORCARE), HEALTH SAFETY NET, THE CHILDREN'S MEDICAL SECURITY PROGRAM, OR MEDICAL HARDSHIP MUST DO SO THROUGH A SINGLE UNIFORM APPLICATION THAT IS SUBMITTED THROUGH THE STATE'S NEW ENROLLMENT SYSTEM CALLED THE HEALTH INSURANCE EXCHANGE (HIX). THROUGH THIS PROCESS, THE INDIVIDUAL CAN SUBMIT AN APPLICATION THROUGH AN ONLINE WEBSITE (WHICH IS CENTRALLY LOCATED ON THE STATE'S HEALTH CONNECTOR WEBSITE), A PAPER APPLICATION, OR OVER THE PHONE WITH A CUSTOMER SERVICE REPRESENTATIVE LOCATED AT EITHER MASSHEALTH OR THE CONNECTOR. INDIVIDUALS MAY ALSO ASK FOR ASSISTANCE FROM THE HOSPITAL'S FINANCIAL COUNSELORS (CAC -""CERTIFIED APPLICATION COUNSELOR"") WITH SUBMITTING THE APPLICATION EITHER ON THE WEBSITE OR THROUGH A PAPER APPLICATION. IN ORDER TO APPLY FOR COVERAGE, THE FOLLOWING PROCESS OCCURS:1. AN INDIVIDUAL IS REQUESTED TO DEVELOP AN ONLINE ACCOUNT FOR USE BY THE STATE TO CONDUCT AN IDENTITY VERIFICATION OF THE INDIVIDUAL. ONCE THIS IS COMPLETED, THE INDIVIDUAL IS THEN ABLE TO SUBMIT A COMPLETED APPLICATION THROUGH THE HCENTIVE SYSTEM ON THE CONNECTOR WEBSITE. IF THE INDIVIDUAL DOES NOT WANT TO GO THROUGH THE ONLINE IDENTITY VERIFICATION SYSTEM, THEY CAN SUBMIT A PAPER APPLICATION. OTHER VERIFICATION MAY STILL BE NEEDED, INCLUDING PROOF OF INCOME, RESIDENCY, AND CITIZENSHIP. 2. ONCE THE APPLICATION IS RECEIVED, THE STATE WILL VERIFY THE ELIGIBILITY BY COMPARING THE INDIVIDUALS FINANCIAL AND OTHER DEMOGRAPHIC INFORMATION TO A FEDERAL DATA SITE AS WELL AS CONDUCTING AN INCOME REVIEW USING A MODIFIED ADJUSTED GROSS INCOME REVIEW. IF NECESSARY, THE INDIVIDUAL WILL ALSO SUBMIT ADDITIONAL VERIFICATION AS REQUESTED BY THE SYSTEM. ONCE THIS OCCURS, THE INDIVIDUAL IS DEEMED:A. ELIGIBLE FOR MASSHEALTH COVERAGE, UPON WHICH THE INDIVIDUAL IS NOTIFIED BY MAIL FROM MASSHEALTH, WHICH INCLUDES ELIGIBILITY INFORMATION INCLUDING START DATE AND OTHER PERTINENT INFORMATION; ORB. IF THE INDIVIDUAL IS ELIGIBLE FOR A QUALIFIED HEALTH PLAN THROUGH THE HEALTH CONNECTOR PROGRAM, THEY ARE NOTIFIED OF THEIR ELIGIBILITY AND DIRECTED TO TAKE ADDITIONAL STEPS. THIS INCLUDES: (1) CHOOSING A PLAN, (2) PAYING THEIR MONTHLY PREMIUM, (3) ENROLLING AND RECEIVING THEIR PROOF OF COVERAGE.MORE INFORMATION REGARDING THE MASSHEALTH AND CONNECTOR PROGRAM BENEFITS AND APPLICATION PROCESS CAN BE FOUND AT WWW.MASS.GOV/MASSHEALTH AND WWW.MAHEALTHCONNECTOR.ORG.3.

IN ADDITION, THE HOSPITAL WILL USE THIS INFORMATION TO DISCUSS ELIGIBILITY FOR CERTAIN HEALTH INSURANCE PROGRAMS. IF THE PATIENT OR GUARANTOR IS UNABLE TO PROVIDE THE NECESSARY INFORMATION, THE HOSPITAL MAY (AT THE PATIENT'S REQUEST) MAKE REASONABLE EFFORTS TO OBTAIN ANY ADDITIONAL INFORMATION FROM OTHER SOURCES. THIS WILL OCCUR WHEN THE PATIENT IS SCHEDULING THEIR SERVICES, DURING PRE-REGISTRATION, WHILE THE PATIENT IS ADMITTED IN THE HOSPITAL, UPON DISCHARGE, OR FOR A REASONABLE TIME FOLLOWING DISCHARGE FROM THE HOSPITAL.

A COPY OF THE FEDERAL POVERTY GUIDELINES THAT ARE USED BY THE STATE IS ATTACHED TO THE NEBH POLICY.HOSPITALS HAVE NO ROLE IN THE DETERMINATION OF PROGRAM ELIGIBILITY MADE BY THE STATE, BUT AT THE PATIENT'S REQUEST MAY TAKE A DIRECT ROLE IN APPEALING OR SEEKING INFORMATION RELATED TO THE COVERAGE DECISIONS.

These obligations are primarily from local residents, most of whom are insured under third-party payor agreements. The System bills third-party payors on the patients' behalf, or if a patient is uninsured, the patient is billed directly. Once claims are settled with the primary payor, any secondary insurance is billed, and patients are billed for copay and deductible amounts that are the patients' responsibility. Payments on accounts receivable are applied to the specific claim identified on the remittance advice or statements. The System does not have a policy to charge interest on past due accounts. Patient accounts receivable are recorded in the accompanying consolidated balance sheets net of contractual adjustments and an allowance for uncollectible accounts, which reflects management's best estimate of the amounts that will not be collected. Management provides for contractual adjustments under terms of third-party reimbursement agreements through a reduction of gross revenue and a credit to patient accounts receivable. In evaluating the collectibility of patient accounts receivable, the System analyzes historical loss experience on revenue from self-pay patients. Using the loss experience rate, the System estimates the appropriate allowance for uncollectible accounts and provision for bad debts. The difference between the standard rates (or the discounted rates if negotiated) and the amounts actually collected after all reasonable collection efforts have been exhausted is charged against the allowance for uncollectible accounts."

201632289349305238,362170866,"Schedule H, Part III, Line 9b Collection practices for patients eligible for financial assistance","Ingalls Memorial Hospital has a fiduciary duty to seek reimbursement for services it has provided from individuals who are able to pay, from third party insurers who cover the cost of care, and from other programs of assistance for which the patient is eligible. To determine whether a patient is able to pay for the services provided as well as to assist the patient in finding alternative coverage options if they are uninsured or underinsured, the hospital follows the following criteria related to billing and collecting from patients. Collecting Information on Patient Health Coverage and Financial Resources Patient Obligations: Prior to the delivery of any health care services (except for cases that are an emergency or urgent care service level), the patient is expected to provide timely and accurate information on their insurance status, demographic information, changes to their family income or insurance status, and information on any deductibles or co-payments that are owed based on their existing insurance or financial program's payment obligations. The detailed information will include: a. Full name, address, telephone number, date of birth, social security number (if available), current health insurance coverage options, citizenship and residency information, and the patient's applicable financial resources that may be used to pay their bill; b. Full name of the patient's guarantor, their address, telephone number, date of birth, social security number (if available), current health insurance coverage options, and their applicable financial resources that may be used to pay for the patient's bill; and c. Other resources that may be used to pay their bill, including other insurance programs, motor vehicle or homeowners insurance policies if the treatment was due to an accident, worker's compensation programs, and student insurance policies, among others. It is ultimately the patient's obligation to keep track of and timely pay their unpaid hospital bill, including any existing co-payments, co-insurance, and deductibles. The patient is further required to inform either their current health insurer (if they have one) or the agency that determined the patient's eligibility status in a public health insurance program of any changes in family income or insurance status. The hospital may also assist the patient with updating their eligibility in a public program when there are any changes in Family Income or insurance status, but only if the hospitals made aware by the patient of facts that may indicate a change in the patient's eligibility status. Patients are required to notify the state public program (Office of Medicaid), information related to any lawsuit or insurance claim that will cover the cost of the services provided by the hospital. Hospital Obligations: Ingalls Memorial Hospital will make all reasonable and diligent efforts to collect the patient insurance status and other information to verify coverage for the health care services to be provided by Ingalls Memorial Hospital. These efforts may occur when the Patient is scheduling their services, during pre-registration, while the patient is admitted in the hospital, upon discharge, or during the collection process which may occur for a reasonable time following discharge from the hospital. This information will be obtained prior to the delivery of any non-emergent and non-urgent health care services (i.e., elective procedures and scheduled procedures). Ingalls Memorial Hospital will delay any attempt to obtain this information during the delivery of any EMTALA level emergency level or urgent care services, if the process to obtain this information will delay or interfere with either the medical screening examination or the services undertaken to stabilize an emergency medical condition. The hospital's reasonable and diligent efforts will include, but is not limited to, requesting information about the patient's insurance status, checking any available public or private insurance databases, and following the billings rules of a known third party payer. If the patient or guarantor/guardian is unable to provide the information needed, and the patient consents, the hospital will make reasonable efforts to contact relatives, friends, guarantor/guardian, and the third party for additional information. Ingalls Memorial Hospital will also make reasonable and diligent efforts to investigate whether a third party resource may be responsible for the services provided by The hospital, including but not limited to: (1) a motor vehicle or homeowner's liability policy, (2) general accident or personal injury protection policies, (3) worker's compensation programs, (4) student insurance policies, among others. In accordance with applicable state regulations or the insurance contract, for any claim where Ingalls Memorial Hospital's reasonable and diligent efforts resulted in a payment from a private insurer or public program, Ingalls Memorial Hospital will report the recovery and off set it against the claim paid by the private insurer or public program. The hospital further maintains all information in accordance with applicable federal and state privacy, security and ID theft laws."

201631949349300638,540793767,"Part II, Community Building Activities:",A healthy community liaison (HCL) was employed by St. Mary's Hospital during FY 2013. The purpose of the HCL is to improve community health in targeted neighborhoods by engaging stakeholders and residents to identify and prioritize community needs.
201631949349300638,540793767,"Part III, Line 2:","Bad debt expense on the general ledger includes: 1) actual write offs of discounted gross charges where it is determined an uninsured patient can pay and does not pay; and 2) the estimated write offs for uninsured patient accounts with outstanding balances after discount. Estimates are based on historical collection rates.When an uninsured patient is billed for patient care services, the charges are automatically discounted and the patient is requested to only pay the amount after discount. The discount is recorded as an adjustment to gross revenue and is not recorded in bad debt expense. If the balance after discount is not paid or not paid in full, the unpaid amount will be written off to bad debt expense. When a patient remits a payment on an account that has already been written off to bad debt expense, the payment is recorded as a recovery of bad debt, which reduces bad debt expense."
201631949349300638,540793767,"Part III, Line 3:","The organization does not report an estimate for the portion of bad debt expense that may have been likely to qualify for financial assistance under the hospital's charity care policy. The organization takes the position that ample opportunity and assistance is provided to the patient to qualify under the financial assistance policy. If sufficient information is not provided, the organization must assume the patient does not qualify."

201631949349300638,540793767,"Part III, Line 8:","Medicare allowable costs reflected in Part III come directly from the facility's Medicare cost report. The cost report segregates the total facility actual expenses into costs for support departments, clinical departments (routine and ancillary) and nonreimburseable departments. The cost report uses appropriate statistical bases to ""step down"" support costs to allowable clinical and nonreimburseable departments. The charges for clinical departments are matched to the total cost for these departments for a cost-to-charge ratio. Medicare-specific allowable costs for in- and outpatient ancillary departments are computed by applying the department-specific cost-to-charge ratio to the Medicare program charges by department. For routine departments, a per diem total cost is computed and applied to Medicare program days for the Medicare routine program cost.The organization feels the total shortfall of Medicare reimbursement compared to computed Medicare allowable costs should be treated as community benefit. The hospital improves access to patient care by providing services regardless of a patient's ability to pay or the hospital's ability to receive full cost reimbursement for services. The hospital also relieves the government of a financial burden when it provides care to publically insured patients where reimbursement is less than cost of providing the service.In addition to the costs reported above, the organization incurred additional costs relating to medicare support that are not includable in the Medicare Cost Report in the amount of: $301,076."
201631949349300638,540793767,"Part III, Line 9b:","The hospital has a written policy that describes collection practices applying to patients that qualify for charity care or financial assistance. If full assistance is approved, no collection efforts are pursued on that patient's account(s). If partial assistance is provided, the patient is responsible for the adjusted account balance and collection efforts will follow the established practices for all patients where a self-pay balance exists. Collection efforts are not pursued on any pending FAP account.Specific criteria exist for how much financial assistance, partial or total, will be provided to the patient based on the assessed need. Criteria is based on Federal Poverty Guidelines and is reviewed and updated annually. Once a patient has been deemed eligible for the Patient Financial Assistance Program (FAP), the patient is notified by letter within 60 days after receipt of the application and supporting documentation. The patient retains eligibility for a period of twelve months from the date of the application. This eligibility is signaled to hospital admissions, billing and collection staff by the assignment of a specific financial class with accompanying eligibility dates. At the end of those twelve months, the patient is responsible for reapplying for FAP eligibility."
201631949349300638,540793767,"Part VI, Line 2:","BSR contracted with Community Health Solutions (CHS), a local Healthcare Consultant who was recommended by the Virginia Hospital and Healthcare Association (VHHA) to assist with data collection and analysis. Becky Clay Christenson, of The Clay Christensen Group, facilitated conversation to prioritize and vet findings from the initial data collection. Jason W. Smith, PhD, consulted on the CHNA and implementation strategy process, documenting method, analyzing data, and synthesizing components into a public document. The CHNA was conducted during Fiscal Year 2013 (September 1, 2012 to August 31, 2013.) in order to prepare documents by the end of the fiscal year. It was determined that existing secondary data, augmented by a key informant survey, would be used to identify and prioritize health indicators. An executive summary and report was then presented to system leadership from Mission and Business Development. Findings were then presented to the St. Mary's Hospital Senior Operations Team for further review and comment. Finally, a presentation was made to the Bon Secours Richmond Health System Board for final approval prior to being made available to the public.Secondary DataThe core of the secondary data analysis was conducted by CHS in order to develop a Community Health Indicator Profile. The analysis intentionally did not include every possible indicator, but instead focused on key metrics that provide a broad insight into community health. Availability of data sources was also considered in selection of content. In many cases, results can be considered in comparison to Virginia averages. Foundational source of data include: Alteryx, Inc.; Virginia Department of Health; hospital discharge data from Virginia Health Information, Inc.; Health Resources and Administration data. In other cases, data was only readily available at the state or national levels and synthetic estimates were created by CHS in order to further develop the community profile. CHS developed statistical models to produce estimates where local data was not available. This analysis was based on the CDC's Behavioral Risk Factor Surveillance Survey; the Virginia Foundation for Youth's Market Decisions' 2010 Obesity Survey; a report produced for Virginia Healthcare Foundation by Urban Institute; and local demographic characteristics obtained by Alteryx, Inc. Because the data is extrapolated, meaningful comparisons to state and national averages cannot be made. Community Input Input from community members was included in assessing health care needs as described in Part V, Line 5 below."

In addition, patient statements request that patients apply for financial assistance, if needed, once any patient financial obligation is determined.Bon Secours is committed to ensuring access to health care services for all. As a health care provider, Bon Secours treats all patients, whether insured, underinsured or uninsured, with dignity, respect and compassion throughout admission, delivery of services, discharge and billing and collection processes. Bon Secours addresses the needs of the uninsured by providing free or reduced fees on hospital services, community outreach efforts to assist with enrollment in Medicaid and other medical coverage programs, including free community-based preventive and primary care services. Bon Secours proactively screens to identify individuals and their families who may qualify for federal, state or local health insurance programs or the Bon Secours Patient Financial Assistance Program (""FAP"") and assist the potential eligible patients through the qualification process. Potentially eligible patients that do not qualify for a federal or state health insurance program are referred to the Financial Assistance Coordinator located in Patient Financial Services for assistance in completing the documentation required to establish FAP eligibility. Patients are responsible for providing the information necessary to complete the documentation. The FAP aids uninsured and underinsured patients who do not qualify for government-sponsored health insurance and who communicate their inability to pay for their medical care. The FAP provides 100% financial assistance to uninsured patients with annual family incomes at or below 200% of the Federal Poverty Guidelines (""FPG""), A sliding scale assistance policy is afforded patients that exceed the income guidelines for 100% assistance. Sliding scale assistance is provided to patients and progressively declines in proportion to the patient's higher income level. Additionally, all uninsured (i.e. self pay) patients are given a reduction to the amount of the full charges for medically necessary services through a community service adjustment (""CSA""). The CSA is market adjusted and based on the payment discount received by other health care payers doing business in the community. For these patients, the FAP also sets a maximum annual family payment liability to ensure that no family suffers a catastrophic financial burden to receive necessary health care services. Based on research conducted by the Tax Foundation, a non partisan tax research group based in Washington DC, the maximum annual family liability is based on a sliding scale determined by the family income and size. In addition, a variety of other potential payment options are available. Bon Secours is dedicated to meeting the needs of non-English speaking patients by having on-site Spanish translators, and other language translation services. In addition, Bon Secours employs a telephone language service which assists in meeting any language needs that arise. The translation services are offered to non-English speaking patients from admission to discharge, including the financial process."
