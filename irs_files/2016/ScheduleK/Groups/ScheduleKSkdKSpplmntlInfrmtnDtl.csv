During the tax year approximately 5% of the recreation center revenues were derived from an unrelated trade or business. This unrelated trade or business use, measured as a percentage of the bonds would be approximate 1/10th of 1% of bond proceeds during the tax year.

In addition, because the bonds were simply reissued, no gross proceeds of the issue have been invested. Part IV, Line 4b, Column A: Bear Stearns Financial Products Inc. assigned to J.P. Morgan on June 1, 2008. Part IV, Line 4c, Column A: The term of the hedge is approximately 13.2 years; from 7/29/2003 to 10/1/2016.

The 2006 Revenue bond also included $7,155,000 in new debt. This portion of the proceeds was used to assist in the construction of the new science, math and engineering center. They were refunded by the Series 2009 Revenue bonds in 2009. The proceeds of the Series of 2009 Revenue bonds were used for two purposes. $14,555,000 was used to refund the 2006 Variable Rate bonds. The remaining $2,048,255 of these funds has been used to fund energy projects on campus. There is an additional credit of $61,520 available under these bonds for campus energy projects. Part II - Line 5 Issuance Costs For the 2006 Revenue Bond, the College paid $350,293 in credit enhancement fees. These amounts have been added to the $423,974 of issuance costs reported on Line 5. Part II - Line 8 - Year of Substantial Completion For the 2009 Series A Revenue Bond, the College anticipates the financed project to be completed in 2013. For the 2009 Series B Revenue Bond, the College used these proceeds to refinance previously issued bonds, and thus, the year of completion is 2009."

THE UNIVERSITY USES GENEROUS DONOR GIFTS, UNIVERSITY RESERVES AND TAXABLE DEBT, IN ADDITION TO PROCEEDS FROM TAX EXEMPT BORROWING, TO FUND THE CONSTRUCTION OF ACADEMIC BUILDINGS, RESEARCH SUPPORT FACILITIES, RESIDENCES AND OTHER CAMPUS HOUSING, ROADS AND INFRASTRUCTURE. THESE FACILITIES HAVE, IN TURN, ENABLED THE UNIVERSITY TO ATTRACT OUTSTANDING FACULTY AND STUDENTS AND TO MORE EFFECTIVELY PERFORM INTERDISCIPLINARY RESEARCH DESIGNED TO ADDRESS FUNDAMENTAL WORLD PROBLEMS. THE NEW FACILITIES PROVIDE THE STANFORD COMMUNITY WITH THE MOST ADVANCED TECHNOLOGY AND ENVIRONMENT FOR TEACHING, LEARNING AND RESEARCH. THE FUNDING ALSO HAS PLAYED A KEY ROLE IN ENABLING STANFORD TO MEET SEISMIC AND OTHER FEDERAL AND STATE BUILDING REQUIREMENTS. THE FOLLOWING ARE EXAMPLES OF BUILDINGS FUNDED IN PART THROUGH TAX-EXEMPT DEBT: i. THE YANG YAMAZAKI ENVIRONMENTAL AND ENERGY BUILDING IS THE HUB OF STANFORD'S ENVIRONMENTAL SUSTAINABILITY TEACHING AND RESEARCH. IT IS A MODEL FOR SUSTAINABILITY BUILDING STANDARDS, USING 56 PERCENT LESS ENERGY AND 90 PERCENT LESS POTABLE WATER THAN A TRADITIONALLY CONSTRUCTED BUILDING OF ITS SIZE. IT HAS BEEN RECOGNIZED WITH LEED PLATINUM CERTIFICATION. ii. THE LI KA SHING CENTER FOR LEARNING AND KNOWLEDGE BRINGS TOGETHER CUTTING-EDGE MEDICINE, MODERN EDUCATION AND ADVANCED TECHNOLOGY TO TRAIN THE PHYSICIANS OF TOMORROW. MEDICAL STUDENTS PRACTICE LIFE-SAVING SKILLS IN REALISTIC SIMULATIONS AND LEARN TO APPLY RESEARCH TO BEDSIDE TREATMENTS. THE CENTER IS A GATHERING PLACE FOR MEDICAL EXPERTS TO SHARE RESEARCH AND HEALTH CARE INSIGHTS AND TO BRING THEIR COMBINED EXPERTISE TO BEAR ON THE WORLD'S GREATEST HEALTH CHALLENGES. iii. THE JAMES AND ANNA MARIE SPILKER ENGINEERING AND APPLIED SCIENCES BUILDING FOSTERS COLLABORATIVE DEVELOPMENT IN THE BURGEONING FIELD OF NANOTECHNOLOGY. SCIENTISTS AT THE CENTER ARE STUDYING HOW TO CREATE MATERIALS AND DEVICES NO BIGGER THAN ONE-BILLIONTH OF A METER, WITH DIRECT AND ECONOMICALLY VIABLE APPLICATIONS TO MEDICINE, ENERGY AND COMMUNICATIONS. iv. THE HUANG ENGINEERING CENTER HOUSES THE SCHOOL OF ENGINEERING, WHOSE TIES TO THE HIGH-TECHNOLOGY INDUSTRY CONTINUE TO FUEL THE GROWTH AND ECONOMY OF SILICON VALLEY AND NORTHERN CALIFORNIA. THE SCHOOL OF ENGINEERING IS WORLD RENOWNED FOR PUSHING THE FRONTIERS OF MODERN SCIENCE AND ENGINEERING, ESPECIALLY IN THE FIELDS OF COMPUTER SCIENCE, BIOENGINEERING AND ENVIRONMENTAL SUSTAINABILITY. v. THE LORRY I. LOKEY STEM CELL RESEARCH BUILDING OPENED IN 2010 AND IS THE LARGEST DEDICATED STEM CELL RESEARCH BUILDING IN THE COUNTRY. THE BUILDING HOUSES THE STANFORD STEM CELL BIOLOGY AND REGENERATIVE MEDICINE INSTITUTE, WHICH INTEGRATES RESEARCHERS FROM CANCER, NEUROSCIENCE, CARDIOVASCULAR MEDICINE, TRANSPLANTATION, IMMUNOLOGY, BIOENGINEERING AND DEVELOPMENTAL BIOLOGY. ALL ARE FOCUSED ON MAKING DISCOVERIES IN STEM CELL RESEARCH AND QUICKLY TRANSLATING THEM INTO PRECLINICAL APPLICATIONS, INNOVATIVE THERAPIES AND TREATMENTS. vi. THE MUNGER GRADUATE RESIDENCE IS A FIVE-BUILDING HOUSING COMPLEX FOR 600 STANFORD LAW AND OTHER GRADUATE STUDENTS. IT IS A SIGNIFICANT INVESTMENT BY STANFORD IN MITIGATING TRAFFIC AND OTHER ENVIRONMENTAL CONCERNS AS IT GREATLY REDUCES THE NUMBER OF PEOPLE DRIVING TO CAMPUS DAILY. vii. THE WILLIAM H. NEUKOM BUILDING, WHICH HOUSES THE CLINICS OF THE STANFORD LAW SCHOOL, OPENED IN 2011 AND WAS BUILT TO SATISFY THE EQUIVALENT OF A LEED GOLD CERTIFICATION FOR SUSTAINABILITY. THE BUILDING USES 30 PERCENT LESS ENERGY THAN REQUIRED BY CODE. THE BUILDING HOUSES THE MILLS LEGAL CLINIC, WHICH INCLUDES 12 CLINICS THAT TEACH THROUGH EXPERIENTIAL EDUCATION.

201602249349302325,042790311,RetDoc1053100001,Bond Issues Supplemental Information,"A - MHEFA Series G Bonds Part I - Per the Official Statement, the purpose of the bond proceeds is: (i) to advance refund $61,930,000 principal amount of the Authority's Revenue Bonds, Baystate Medical Center (the Institution) Issue, Series E (the ""Series E Bonds""), which were issued July 11, 1996 to finance or refinance the following property owned by the Institution: (a)construction of a new 104,500 gross square foot Ambulatory Care Center at 3300 Main Street, Springfield, Massachusetts; (b) construction of a new 100,000 gross square foot building to house the Ambulatory Surgery Center, Medical Library and education/conference space on the Institution's North campus located at 759 Chestnut Street, Springfield, Massachusetts; (c) renovation of various existing spaces within the Institution's North campus; (d) acquisition of equipment for the new facilities; (ii) to finance routine capital construction, renovations, and equipping of various facilities of the Institution; and (iii) to pay certain costs of issuance of the Series G Bonds. B- MHEFA Series H Bonds Part I - Per the Official Statement, the purpose of the bond proceeds is: (i) the construction, improvement, equipping, and other related capital expenditures of a parking garage walkway, and other related work at an existing building at 280 Chestnut Street owned and used by the Institution (the ""Garage""), and (ii) the acquisition and installation of capital equipment and renovations to existing facilities of the Institution and other routine capital expenditures in connection with the Institution's hospital operations. MA HEFA Series H bonds are private placement bonds and therefore, there is no CUSIP number associated with these bonds. C- MHEFA Series M-2, Pool 2 Part I - Per the Loan Document the purpose of the bond is to refinance Baystate Medical Center's Mass HEFA Pool J-2 Loan, which was issued February 2, 1999 to finance the acquisition and equipping of the property located at 280 Chestnut Street, Springfield, Massachusetts (the ""Property""), and the renovation of the Property and existing facilities of the Institution and the acquisition of capital equipment for the Institution's existing facilities. The HEFA indebtedness listed is a pool loan therefore the issue price, Parts I, II, III, IV (Lines 5-7) are being answered with respect to the Baystate Medical Center loan alone rather than with respect to proceeds loaned to other conduit borrowers. The actual date of issue of the MHEFA Series M2 Bonds was 5/30/2002, and the CUSIP number shown on Form 8038 was 57585KA57.
