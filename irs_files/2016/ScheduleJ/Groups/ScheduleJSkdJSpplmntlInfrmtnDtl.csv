The Compensation Committee reviews and approves all forms of compensation and benefits provided to each executive with the assistance of a national independent compensation consulting firm. The consulting firm assists the Compensation Committee with its decision-making process to ensure executive compensation levels are reasonable and appropriate relative to those of other similar organizations. Base salaries in Column B(i) are determined based on competitive market practices for comparable positions with similar size organizations and scope of responsibilities. Bonus and incentive compensation in Column B(ii) is based on the achievement of performance goals. The executives' compensation program has a significant pay-at-risk component to ensure the alignment of pay and organizational performance. Goals are set in advance in areas such as quality of care, patient satisfaction, community services and financial performance. Compensation is at risk if the goals established by the Compensation Committee are not met. Other reportable compensation in column B(III) includes distributions from the supplemental executive retirement plan. In a manner designed to qualify for the ""rebuttable presumption of reasonableness"" the Compensation Committee of the Board of Trustees expressly reviewed and approved these retirement benefit arrangements for senior executives in a manner that qualified under the intermediate sanctions rules of the Federal tax law, and in recognition of (a) the executives' years of service to the organization and (b) the significant contributions to enhancing the ability of the organization to achieve its charitable mission in a manner consistent with financial solvency. Accordingly, this benefit should be viewed as applying to years of service for the organization. Steven Safyer, MD - Pooled Supplemental Executive Retirement Plan distribution of $2,021,844 based on approximately 32 years of service at Montefiore. Joel Perlman - Pooled Supplemental Executive Retirement Plan distribution of $534,534 based on more than 25 years of service at Montefiore.

THE FORMULA HAS TWO PARTS: (1) 4% TO 7% OF BASE SALARY (COMMENSURATE WITH MANAGEMENT LEVEL), PLUS (2) A CONTRIBUTION STARTING AT 5% (BASED UPON TENURE) FOR EARNINGS BEYOND THE PENSION PAY CAP. THE LATTER OF WHICH IS DESIGNED TO HELP RESTORE LOST PENSION BENEFITS FORFEITED UNDER THE QUALIFIED PLAN FOR EARNINGS OVER THE PENSION PAY CAP LIMIT. CONTRIBUTIONS ARE ALSO MADE FOR A SMALL GROUP OF SENIOR LEVEL EXECUTIVES WHOSE ESTIMATED RETIREMENT BENEFIT (SOCIAL SECURITY PLUS QUALIFIED PLAN BENEFITS PLUS 457F) FALLS BELOW 50% - 65% OF FINAL 4-YEAR AVERAGE BASE SALARY WHEN RETIRING AT AGE 65. TARGET BENEFIT LEVELS VARY BY YEARS OF SERVICE. UNLIKE SUTTER HEALTH'S QUALIFIED PLAN WHERE EMPLOYEE BENEFITS ARE GUARANTEED (I.E., A DEFINED BENEFIT), SUTTER'S NON-QUALIFIED PLAN BENEFITS ARE NOT GUARANTEED BY SUTTER HEALTH.

TO ENSURE THAT EXTRAORDINARY EFFORTS BY INDIVIDUALS CAN BE RECOGNIZED AND THAT ACTIONS OF LEADERSHIP ARE CONSISTENT WITH SUPPORTING SUTTER HEALTH'S OVERALL MISSION, VISION, AND VALUES, SUTTER'S LONG TERM INCENTIVE PLAN APPROACH ALSO INCORPORATES A COMBINATION OF CEO AND SUTTER HEALTH COMPENSATION COMMITTEE DISCRETION. IN SOME CASES, THE SUTTER HEALTH COMPENSATION COMMITTEE HAS DELEGATED AUTHORITY TO THE PRESIDENT & CEO TO MODIFY INDIVIDUAL AWARDS WITHIN LIMITS THAT HAVE BEEN PRE-APPROVED BY THE SUTTER HEALTH COMPENSATION COMMITTEE.

The process/policy for setting presidential compensation at Mercyhurst University is the following. At Mercyhurst University, the Committee on Compensation of the Board of Trustees is responsible for the compensation-setting function of the President. The committee consists of no fewer than three trustees appointed by the chair of the board, who will also name a chair and vice chair. These trustees must be independent, without a conflict of interest as it relates to this area, and may not have been employed by Mercyhurst University in the last five years. No member may be an executive of Mercyhurst University. In May, the Committee on Compensation evaluates the President's performance for the fiscal year-end May. The committee reviews the president's performance in light of the university's goals and objectives. In addition the committee reviews the President's compensation to ensure that his compensation complies with rules governing tax-exempt universities described in the Internal Revenue Code, complies with compensation rules and regulations promulgated by any other regulatory agency or legislative authority and aligns appropriately with compensation levels at comparable universities. They use this review as the basis for recommendations on the president's compensation. The committee negotiates the terms of the (new or renewed) president's contract and increases in compensation level, elements of the compensation package, and structure. The recommendation is then presented for approval of the full board. At this time the committee also requests the President to provide a list of goals and objectives for the institution and for the office of the president for the forthcoming year. This document provides the baseline used in evaluating the performance of the president 10 to 12 months later. This request is followed up in both October and February by a request of the Committee on Compensation to the President to prepare a report that assesses progress on each of the annual and standing objectives presented in the May report."

The CORD Committee maintains a roster of disqualified persons, as defined by the IRS, for whose compensation the procedure is used. The roster is reviewed periodically but at least annually. The procedure was last discussed with the full board in March 2011. The procedure requires three elements as follows: 1) The terms of transactions are approved by the organization's governing body, or a committee thereof, whose members have no conflict of interest with respect to the arrangement. The Board of Trustees delegated authority to the CORD Committee to act on behalf of the Board in these matters at its meeting on March 25, 1999. Compensation arrangements are reviewed and approved by the CORD Committee before the effective date. Members of the CORD Committee recuse themselves from any vote in which there is a potential or actual conflict of interest. 2) The governing body or committee obtains and relies upon appropriate, comparable data before making its determination. Rice participates in the annual survey by Towers Watson of select universities' executive compensation, and additional appropriate peer surveys. These reports reflect executive compensation in universities of a stature similar to that of Rice, and with which Rice competes for faculty and staff. The CORD Committee may also seek and rely on other relevant information, including compensation paid by other taxable and tax-exempt organizations for functionally comparable positions, geographic market forces, and actual written offers from similar institutions competing for services. The CORD Committee relies on this data and documents any determinations that reasonable compensation is an amount more than the range of comparable data. 3) The governing body or committee adequately documents the basis for making determinations concurrently with making decisions. Minutes documenting the deliberations of the CORD Committee are prepared contemporaneously for review and approval at its next meeting."

The university did not utilize chartered flights for air travel. Extensive travel is required of the position of president and he is encouraged by the Board of Trustees to travel business or first class on flights of two hours or more. This provision is made for several reasons: 1) business or first-class travel allows for the most flexibility to accommodate a travel schedule that must frequently be altered, often at the last minute to accommodate donors' schedules, add critical meetings, or to take advantage of other strategic opportunities for the university; 2) circumstances sometimes call for the president to return to campus without notice, or to remain on campus when a trip was planned, and first or business-class travel best accommodates these changing conditions; and 3) the Board of Trustees wishes the president to be at his or her best performance representing and seeking funding for the university during often grueling travel itineraries for meetings frequently critical to the institution's well-being. This accommodation was not treated as taxable compensation.

Compensation and benefits provided to this individual are determined pursuant to policies, procedures, and processes of AHSSHC that are designed to ensure compliance with the intermediate sanctions laws as set forth in IRC Section 4958. AHSSHC has taken steps to ensure that processes are in place to satisfy the rebuttable presumption of reasonableness standard as set forth in Treasury Regulation 53.4958-6 with respect to its active executive-level positions. The AHSSHC Board Compensation Committee (the Committee) serves as the governing body for all executive compensation matters. The Committee is composed of certain members of the Board of Directors (the Board) of AHSSHC. Voting members of the Committee include only individuals who serve on the Board as independent representatives of the community, who hold no employment positions with AHSSHC and who do not have relationships with any of the individuals whose compensation is under their review that impacts their best independent judgment as fiduciaries of AHSSHC. The Committee's role is to review and approve all components of the executive compensation plan of AHSSHC. As an independent governing body with respect to executive compensation, it should be noted that the Committee will often confer in executive sessions on matters of compensation policy and policy changes. In such executive sessions, no members of management of AHSSHC are present. The Committee is advised by an independent third party compensation advisor. This advisor prepares all the benchmark studies for the Committee. Compensation levels are benchmarked with a national peer group of other not-for-profit healthcare systems and hospitals of similar size and complexity to AHS and each of its affiliated entities. The following principles guide the establishment of individual executive compensation: - The salary of the President/CEO of AHS will not exceed the 40th percentile of comparable salaries paid by similarly situated organizations; and - Other executive salaries shall be established using market medians. The compensation philosophy, policies, and practices of AHSSHC are consistent with the organization's faith-based mission and conform to applicable laws, regulations, and business practices. As a faith-based organization sponsored by the Seventh-day Adventist Church (the Church), AHSSHC's philosophy and principles with respect to its executive compensation practices reflect the conservative approach of the Church's mission of service and were developed in counsel with the Church's leadership."

In recognition of the contribution that each executive makes to the success of AHS, AHS provides to eligible executives participation in the AHS Executive FLEX Benefit Program (the Plan). The purpose of the Plan is to offer eligible executives an opportunity to elect from among a variety of supplemental benefits, including deferred compensation benefits taxable under Internal Revenue Code (IRC) Section 457(f), to individually tailor a benefits program appropriate to each executive's needs. The Plan provides eligible participants a pre-determined benefits allowance credit that is equal to a percentage of the executive's base pay from which is deducted the cost of mandatory and elective employee benefits. The pre-determined benefits allowance credit percentage is approved by the AHSSHC Board Compensation Committee, an independent committee of the Board of Directors of AHSSHC. Any funds that remain after the cost of mandatory and elective benefits are subtracted from the annual pre-determined benefits allowance are contributed, at the employee's option, to either an IRC 457(f) deferred compensation account or to an IRC 457(b) eligible deferred compensation plan. Upon attainment of age 65, all previous 457(f) deferred amounts are paid immediately to the participant and any future employer contributions are made quarterly from the Plan directly to the participant. The Plan documents define an employee who is eligible to participate in the Plan to generally include the Chief Executive Officers of AHS entities and Vice Presidents of all AHS entities whose base salary is at least $224,000. The Plan provides for a class year vesting schedule (2 years for each class year) with respect to amounts accumulated in the executive's 457(f) deferred compensation account. Distributions could also be made from the executive's 457(f) deferred compensation account upon attainment of age 65 or upon an involuntary separation. The account is forfeited by the executive upon a voluntary separation. In addition to the Plan, AHS has instituted a defined benefit, non-tax-qualified deferred compensation plan for certain executives who have provided lengthy service to AHS and/or to other Seventh-Day Adventist Church hospitals or health care institutions. Participation in the plan is offered to AHS executives on a prorata schedule beginning with 20 years of service as an employee of AHS and/or another hospital or health care institution controlled by the Seventh-Day Adventist Church and who satisfy certain other qualifying criteria. This supplemental executive retirement plan (SERP) was designed to provide eligible executives with the economic equivalent of an annual income beginning at normal retirement age equal to 60% of the average of the participant's three, five or seven highest years of base salary from AHS active employment inclusive of income from all other Seventh-Day Adventist Church healthcare employer-financed retirement income sources and investment income earned on those contributions through social security normal retirement age as defined in the plan. The number of years included in highest average compensation is determined by the individual's year of entry to the SERP and by the individual's year of entry to the AHS Executive FLEX Benefit Program.

Hughes $30,002 Brenda Howie $21,584 Terms & Conditions: Baptist Health Systems, Inc. established the Baptist Health Systems, Inc. Supplemental Executive Retirement Plan, a nonqualified, unfunded deferred compensation plan effective July 1, 2010, for the benefit of certain management or highly-compensated employees of Baptist Health Systems, Inc. Participants are chosen by the Chairman's Council of the Board (the Council) of Baptist Health Systems, Inc. The purpose of the plan is to enhance the ability of Baptist Health Systems, Inc. to attract and retain qualified management personnel with a market-competitive supplemental retirement benefit for a select group of management or highly compensated employees on a tax-deferred basis. Baptist Health Systems, Inc. will contribute to each participant's plan an annual amount equal to a percentage of the participant's base salary commencing in 2010 and continuing each year thereafter until the year in which the participant separates from employment. An applicable percentage of either 17.5% or 15% of base salary will be contributed to each participant's plan (or such other percentage as the Council determines). The vested accrued balance or employer contribution (plus earnings or losses) will be paid for any event requiring such payment other than death, as soon as administratively feasible but no later than the last day of the calendar year in which the event occurs. If the event that results in the payment of the benefit is death, the balance will be paid as soon as the Board obtains satisfactory proof of death, but no later than the 15th day of the third month following the end of the calendar year in which the Participant dies. Certain participants who remain in continuous employment have a non-forfeitable right to receive the employer contribution made in a plan year as of the first day of the plan year that is five years from the first day of the Plan year in which such contribution was made. However, if such participant has attained a specified age, the participant shall have a non-forfeitable right to receive any future employer contributions along with earnings or losses that have not vested and an immediate non-forfeitable right to receive any future employer contributions as of the date such contributions are made. New participants other than those specifically identified in the Plan have a non-forfeitable right to receive their accrued balance based on a vesting schedule as described in the Plan document. Otherwise, a participant shall have a non-forfeitable right to receive his accrued balance upon his separation from service on account of death, disability, or upon involuntary separation from service without cause if such separation occurs prior to the completion of the five year period described above, prior to attaining the age specified above, or prior to the applicable vesting schedule described above."

Travel for Companions: With the exception of the President, reimbursement or payment of the travel expenses of an eligible employee's family member must normally be pre-approved by the President or appropriate Executive Vice President or Senior Vice President. The travel expenses of an eligible employee's family member may be paid for or reimbursed by Emory University and are not included in the employee's taxable income, provided the employee can establish that the presence of his or her family member serves a ""bona fide business purpose"" as defined in the Treasury Regulations. A family member's presence is considered to serve a bona fide business purpose if the individual has a significant role in the proceedings or makes an important contribution to the success of the event. If attendance of an eligible employee's family member is desirable but does not serve a bona fide business purpose to Emory, any such payment or reimbursement for such family member's travel expenses will be a taxable payment. Tax indemnification and gross up payments: Effective June 2, 2009, Emory University does not make tax indemnification or gross-up payments to executive staff members unless agreed to prior to such date. Pursuant to an initial employment agreement, Susan Cruse received a tuition benefit, which included a tax gross-up payment of $34,614. Housing allowance or residence for personal use: Emory University provides an on-campus residence for the President. The President must live in this residence as a requirement of his job and utilize the residence for University business purposes. Emory University provides a housing allowance to its VP Finance/CFO. This allowance is included in taxable income on Form W-2.
