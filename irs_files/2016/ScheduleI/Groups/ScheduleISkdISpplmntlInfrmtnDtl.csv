Research Grants - The Office of the Vice Provost for Research (OVPR) publishes guidelines for each of the internal grant programs that provide the general conditions of the award, as well as guidance on the expenses that may be charged to the award. Each grant is set up as a separate project in the University's financial system based on the award amount and budget categories approved by the OVPR and administered through the Office of Sponsored Programs. The financial system provides real time access to a Budget Summary Report for the project that provides a comparison of budgeted expenditures to cumulative actual expenditures by expenditure category. This report can be accessed by the Project Manager and others with administrative and financial oversight responsibilities. Expenditure transactions under internal grant programs are subject to internal controls for approval and processing similar to other University expenditure transactions. The system does not allow expenditures to be processed in excess of or outside of the approved budget categories. Student Awards - These awards are provided to students for winning educational competitions. The purpose of the competitions is to further the education of students. Grants and Other Assistance to Governments and Organizations in the United States: The University enters into a contract with the grant recipient that describes the recipient's responsibilities for the use of the grant funds. Under the terms of the contract, recipients are required to submit quarterly and final written progress reports to the principal investigator (""PI"") or project director for the grant, and funds are paid to the recipient on a cost reimbursable basis. When the grant recipient submits an invoice for reimbursement, the PI reviews the invoice to ensure the expenditures are consistent with the established budget and with the work completed to date, prior to approving the amount for payment. Grant recipients subject to the U.S. Office of Management and Budget Circular A-133 Audits of States, Local Governments, and Non-Profit Organizations are also required to provide certification of their compliance with the financial audit requirements of those guidelines prior to receiving funds. Thereafter, the University requires an annual certification of continuing compliance and a copy of their most recent audit report. If any of the above processes indicate an area of concern, site visits may be conducted by the University to review the programmatic and/or financial records. Charitable organizations that receive contributions from the University are carefully selected and must be approved through the Vice President for Constituent Engagement & Chief of Staff. The contribution must support the University's interest and be consistent with the University's core values."

The grant is entered in the summary database listing reporting and reimbursement requirements. Expenditures and Monitoring St. Thomas University follows Circular A-21, EGAR, the Florida State, Dade County and any other institution's policy with whom STU has a sponsored relationship. All sponsored project expenses need to be approved by the Principal Investigator, the supervising Dean, the Provost (when applicable), the Accounts Payable Representative, and the Grants Accountant or Accounting Manager. The Grants Accountant is the last review before payment, therefore she verifies the expense is supported by the budget narrative, all the signatures have been gathered, and debarment has been printed for each vendor. Debarment verification is checked at https://www.sam.gov. Budget reallocations usually require written approval from the funding agency unless the reallocation of funds within existing categories is small, do not change the scope of the project and follow the federal guidelines, for example, the 10% EDGAR rule. Expenditures on a sponsored agreement can occur only within the specified performance period. If there are unspent funds beyond the performance period and goals of the sponsored project have not been fully accomplished, carryover of unspent fund can occur upon receipt of a No-Cost Extension approval. The PI/PD reconciles with the Grant Accountant the unspent funds before filing the no-cost extension. Project Directors and Budget Officers have real-time access to the general ledger accounts created by the Accounting Department via web-advisor. Web-advisor reports contain detailed information on budgets and expenses by account number. It is the responsibility of the PI/PD to monitor the accuracy of all the expenses posted to their accounts. When the PI/PD keeps sub-ledger records, the Grant Accountant reconciles such records with the general ledger periodically. The PI/PD keeps track of matching requirements or in-kind donations separately. PI/PD provides these figures to the Grants Accountant for review and reporting purposes. Time and Effort reporting is required for all employees working on funded projects. The form is completed at the end of every semester. The form can be found at http://www.stu.edu/Portals/0/personnel.pdf. Sub-awards St. Thomas University sub-awards funds to other organizations when specified in the approved budget narratives. An agreement is signed between St. Thomas University and the sub grantee stating the terms of the contract. St. Thomas University expects the sub grantee to follow the same regulations governing the sponsoring agency and comply with any request for information from St Thomas University's accounting office. The Grants Accountant verifies reimbursement requests submitted by the sub-grantee against the approved budget, checks the supporting documentation and prepares a check request. The check request is reviewed by the Accounting Manager and submitted for approval to the Principal Investigator, the immediate Dean, and the Provost (when applicable) and subsequently to the Accounts Payable office for processing. A Single Audit Report in Accordance with OMB Circular A-133 is requested from each sub grantee at the end of each fiscal year. When St. Thomas University is the sub-grantee in sponsored agreements, it follows the specifications of the contract signed with the fiscal agent. St. Thomas University also follows the same federal and institutional policies as if the award was a direct award to our institution. Reimbursement St. Thomas University requests reimbursement of sponsored agreement expenses on a monthly or quarterly basis. The Grants Accountant / Accounting Manager follow the reimbursement guidelines of the cognizant agency. Audit St. Thomas University undergoes an external audit annually. As part of the audit, the external auditor prepares the Single Audit Report in Accordance with OMB Circular A-133 and Section 10.650, Rules of the Auditor General of the State of Florida. The Accounting Office prepares the Schedule of Federal Expenditures, which is the basis for the Single Audit Report. Grant award notices are received by the Office of Financial Affairs from various State and Federal Agencies. Each Notice of Award (NOA) identifies the CFDA or CSDA number(s) from which the grant is funded. These catalog numbers are entered on to the Schedule of Federal Expenditures. From the University's fund accounting system, a report of total expenditures by location is run for the fiscal period being audited. The totals are verified to the financial statements by the Grants Accountant and become part of the Schedule of Expenditures for Federal Awards (SEFA) supporting documentation. St. Thomas University is on an expense reimbursement basis for most of the grants. Therefore, as of June 30, a receivable is reported for most of the grants. The only exceptions are grants run by the Human Rights Institute. This institute administers the Refugee and Entrant Assistance grant passed through the Department of Children and Families (DCF). This grant reimburses St. Thomas University based on ""fee for service."" The Grants Accountant verifies reimbursement received with DCF. Since the grant has more than one CFDA number for each contract, the percentage of reimbursement received by CFDA as provided by DCF is applied to expenses per general ledger. All other non ARRA grants are funded with only one CFDA or CSDA, and we assume that 100% of expenditures are derived from the single Catalog number.

The Director of Financial Aid is responsible for establishing Institutional policy development surrounding the delivery of financial assistance Policy development adheres to federal and state laws and regulations as well as to the mission of the University. When appropriate, Financial Aid policy is reported to and approved by the Executive Vice President & Vice President for Business. The primary purpose of a collegiate financial aid program should be to provide financial assistance to accepted students who, without such aid, would be unable to attend that university. Each university has an obligation to assist in realizing the national goal of equality of educational opportunity The University, therefore, should work with schools, community groups, and other educational institutions in support of this goal. Parents are expected to contribute according to their means, taking into account their income, assets, number of dependents, and other relevant information Students themselves are expected to contribute from their own assets and earnings, including appropriate borrowing against future earnings Need-based financial aid should be offered only after determination that the resources of the family are insufficient to meet the student's educational expenses. The amount of need-based aid offered should not exceed the amount needed to meet the difference between the student's total educational expenses and the family's resources. The amount and type of self-help expected from students should be related to the circumstances of the individual In the assignment of funds to those students designated to receive financial aid, the largest amounts of total grant assistance should go to students with the least ability to pay The university should review its financial assistance awards annually and adjust them, if necessary, to reflect changes in the financial needs of students and the expenses of attending the institution. The university has an obligation to inform students and parents of the financial aid renewal policies for enrolled students at the time of the initial offer of financial assistance. Because the amount of financial assistance awarded reflects the economic circumstances of students and their families as well as available funding, the university should refrain from any public announcement of the amount of aid offered and encourage students, their secondary schools, and others to respect the confidentiality of this information. Selection of students to receive financial aid will be made without regard to age, sex, race, color, religion, national origin, disability or marital status. Priority consideration for aid is given to students whose files are complete by March 1 of each year. The institution will package each student according to the matrix (percentage) need assigned the student. This determination is made by the award year the student will enter Once the matrix year is determined the student is awarded a percentage of his or her (FAFSA) need with federal, state and institutional aid The student is then awarded work study followed with Perkins loan, Stafford (subsidized or unsubsidized) loan and the PLUS loan, as applicable Aid is ""frozen"" from one year to the next In extreme instances as defined by the Financial Aid Office, the amount of grant money may be adjusted accordingly to reflect a students' new need Honors scholarships are awarded based on the high school GPA, rank and either the SAT or ACT scores Students will continue to receive the scholarship as long as the student is in good academic standing Award letters are mailed or emailed to the student whenever there is a change to the financial aid award and the change affects federal or state awards."

This includes, but is not always limited to: LSAT score and undergraduate grade point average. Some scholarships are also awarded based on merit and diversity. There is no separate application beyond the admissions application required for most of the scholarships. Merit Based Scholarships:California Western School of Law (the School) offers two forms of merit based scholarships that are awarded to students at the completion of their first year of law school. The Academic Merit Scholarship is typically awarded to students with GPAs from 3.33 to 4.33. It is awarded based solely on the student's GPA. The Dean's Diversity Scholarship is typically awarded to students with GPAs from 2.80 to 4.33. It is awarded through a competitive application process. The number of scholarships offered each year varies, based on the number of eligible students and the availability of funds.LL.M./M.C.L. Scholarships:These scholarships are awarded to the School's most academically outstanding LL.M./M.C.L. applicants based upon academic credentials, relevant work experience, impressive academic and professional recommendations, and strong command of English (as evidenced by quality writing on the applicant's personal statement and by the applicant's ""Test"" of English as a Foreign Language score).Students enrolled in the School's Spanish on-line LL.M. program may apply for a scholarship if they can demonstrate long term commitment to trial advocacy, education, and justice system reforms. In addition, students in this program may also receive a small scholarship if they graduated from a school in Mexico that has a cooperation agreement (a ""convenio"") with the School."

Merit-based funding is awarded based upon donor preferences and restrictions or institutional academic criteria. Need-based aid is awarded based upon institutional methodology, a standard need analysis formula generally practiced by other private, non-profit peer institutions. Student financial aid is awarded to students for educational purposes. Award amounts are controlled by educational costs established by the institution and student progress is evaluated at key points in the student lifecycle if the award has contingencies that require such. Disbursement controls are in place that require direct costs be paid prior to providing refunds for non-direct educational expenses. Emory University is responsible for ensuring that it communicates the relevant and necessary information contained in subcontracted award documents to the subrecipients. The Office of Grants and Contracts Accounting maintains a copy of the Subcontract Agreement, which stipulates the terms of the award and is signed by representatives of both Emory University and the subrecipient organization. This agreement indicates that the subrecipient understands and is aware of the award requirements. In addition, if there are any further changes to the Agreement, an amendment to the agreement is generated and signed by the representative of Emory University and the subrecipient."
