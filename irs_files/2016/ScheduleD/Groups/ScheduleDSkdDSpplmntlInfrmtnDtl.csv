Under ASC 740, Spectrum is required to report information regarding its exposure to various tax positions taken by Spectrum and requires a two-step process that separates recognition from measurement. The first step is determining whether a tax position has met the recognition threshold; the second step is measuring a tax position that meets the recognition threshold. Management believes that Spectrum has adequately evaluated its current tax positions and has concluded that as of June 30, 2015 Spectrum does not have any uncertain tax positions for which a reserve or an accrual for a tax liability would be necessary.Spectrum has received notification from the Internal Revenue Service and the State of California that it qualifies for tax-exempt status under Section 501(c)(3) of the Internal Revenue Code and Section 23701d of the California Revenue and Taxation Code. The exemptions are subject to periodic review by the federal and state taxing authorities and management is confident that Spectrum continues to satisfy all federal and state statutes in order to qualify for continued tax exemption status. Spectrum could potentially receive unrelated business income in the future (such as program advertising or sub-lease rental income) requiring Spectrum to file separate tax returns under federal and state statutes. If such conditions exist, Spectrum will calculate and accrue the applicable taxes."

U.S. generally accepted accounting principles require that the asset and liability method of accounting for income taxes be utilized by these organizations. Under the asset and liability method, deferred income taxes are recognized for the tax consequences of temporary differences by applying enacted statutory tax rates applicable to future years to differences between the financial statement carrying amounts and the tax basis of existing assets and liabilities. The effect on deferred taxes of a change in tax rates is recognized in income in the period of enactment. At December 31, 2014 and 2013, the System has a deferred income tax asset which has been fully offset by a related valuation allowance. A valuation allowance is provided when it is more likely than not that some portion, or all of the deferred tax asset will not be realized.

Its endowment includes both donor-restricted endowment funds and funds designated by the Board of Trustees to function as endowments. As required by U.S. generally accepted accounting principles (GAAP), net assets associated with endowment funds, including funds designated by the Board of Trustees to function as endowments, are classified and reported based on the existence or absence of donor-imposed restrictions. The College has adopted investment and spending policies for endowment assets that attempt to provide a predictable stream of funding to programs supported by its endowment while seeking to maintain the purchasing power of the endowment assets. Endowment assets include those assets of donor-restricted funds that the College must hold in perpetuity or for a donor-specified period(s) as well as board-designated funds. Under this policy, as approved by the Board of Trustees, the endowment assets are invested in a manner that is intended to produce results that exceed the price and yield results of appropriate market indices while assuming a moderate level of investment risk. The College's investment objectives are to provide a total return sufficient to support the College's operating budget while preserving the assets against inflation. To meet these objectives the Board seeks a total return of at least 5% greater than the rate of inflation as measured by the Consumer Price Index (U.S. CPI-U) over a long-term horizon. Total return is defined as dividends or interest income, plus or minus realized and unrealized capital appreciation or depreciation at fair market value, net of fees. The maximum amount of endowment income utilization is determined by a spending formula approved by the Board of Trustees. The amount available for spending is set at 5% of the previous three-year average market value for the years ended June 30, 2015 and 2014, respectively. The amounts available to be distributed, net of unspent endowment income, under the spending policy were $515,726 and $458,223 for the years ended June 30, 2015 and 2014, respectively. These amounts are included in change in net assets from operations. Investment income greater or less than the amounts available to be distributed under the spending policy is reported as nonoperating income."

When these returns are filed, it is highly certain that some positions taken would be sustained upon examination by the taxing authorities, while others are subject to uncertainty about the merits of the tax position taken or the amount of the position that would ultimately be sustained. Examples of tax positions common to universities include such matters as the following: the tax exempt status of each entity and various positions relative to potential sources of unrelated business taxable income (UBIT). The benefit of tax position is recognized in the financial statements in the period during which, based on all available evidence, management believes that it is more likely than not that the position will be sustained upon examination, including the resolution of appeals or litigation processes, if any. Tax positions are not offset or aggregated with other positions. Tax positions that meet the ""more likely than not"" recognition threshold are measured as the largest amount of tax benefit that is more than 50% likely to be realized on settlement with the applicable taxing authority. The portion of the benefits associated with tax positions taken that exceeds the amount measured as described above is reflected as a liability for uncertain tax benefits in the accompanying statements of financial position along with any associated interest and penalties that would be payable to the taxing authorities upon examination. As of May 31, 2015 and 2014, there were no uncertain tax benefits identified and recorded as a liability.

The effect on deferred taxes of a change in tax rates is recognized in income in the period of enactment. At December 31, 2014 and 2013, the System has a deferred income tax asset which has been fully offset by a related valuation allowance. A valuation allowance is provided when it is more likely than not that some portion, or all of the deferred tax asset will not be realized.

THE COLLEGE'S SPENDING AND INVESTMENT POLICIES WORK TOGETHER TO ACHIEVE THIS OBJECTIVE. THE INVESTMENT POLICY ESTABLISHES AN ACHIEVABLE RETURN OBJECTIVE THROUGH DIVERSIFICATION OF ASSET CLASSES. THE CURRENT LONG-TERM RETURN OBJECTIVE IS TO ACHIEVE A TOTAL RETURN (INCOME PLUS CAPITAL CHANGE, NET OF ALL INVESTMENT EXPENSES) EQUAL TO OR EXCEEDING ANY APPROVED DISTRIBUTION RATE, PLUS THE INFLATION RATE AS MEASURED BY THE CONSUMER PRICE INDEX. ACTUAL RETURNS IN ANY GIVEN YEAR MAY VARY FROM THIS AMOUNT. TO SATISFY ITS LONG-TERM RATE-OF-RETURN OBJECTIVES, THE COLLEGE RELIES ON A TOTAL RETURN STRATEGY IN WHICH INVESTMENT RETURNS ARE ACHIEVED THROUGH BOTH CAPITAL APPRECIATION (REALIZED AND UNREALIZED) AND CURRENT YIELD (INTEREST AND DIVIDENDS). THE COLLEGE TARGETS A DIVERSIFIED ASSET ALLOCATION THAT PLACES AN EMPHASIS ON U.S. EQUITY-BASED INVESTMENTS AND U.S. INTERMEDIATE-TERM DEBT SECURITIES TO ACHIEVE ITS LONG-TERM RETURN OBJECTIVES WITHIN PRUDENT RISK PARAMETERS. THE SPENDING POLICY CALCULATES THE AMOUNT OF MONEY ANNUALLY DISTRIBUTED FROM THE COLLEGE'S VARIOUS ENDOWED FUNDS, FOR SCHOLARSHIPS, PROGRAMS AND ADMINISTRATION. THE COLLEGE UTILIZES A TOTAL RETURN SPENDING RATE POLICY WHICH LIMITS THE AMOUNT OF INVESTMENT RETURN USED TO SUPPORT CURRENT OPERATIONS. THE LIMIT IS DETERMINED BY THE COLLEGE'S CURRENT BUDGETED AMOUNT TO BE SPENT FOR THE YEAR. UNDER THE TOTAL SPENDING POLICY, THE COLLEGE UTILIZED 976,000 AND 467,000 IN 2015 AND 2014, RESPECTIVELY.

As such, the College is not subject to federal or state income tax, except for certain income derived from unrelated business activities as defined by the Internal Revenue Code. Any such taxes resulting from unrelated business activities are insignificant to the operations of the college. U.S. GAAP prescribes recognition thresholds and measurement attributes for the financial statement recognition and measurement of a tax position taken or expected to be taken in a tax return. Tax benefits will be recognized only if the tax position is more-likely-than-not to be sustained in a tax examination, with a tax examination being presumed to occur. The amount recognized will be the largest amount of tax benefit that is greater than 50% likely of being realized on examination. For tax positions not meeting the more-likely-than-not test, no tax benefit will be recorded. Management has concluded that they are unaware of any tax benefits or liabilities to be recognized at August 31, 2015, 2014, and 2013. The college is no longer subject to examination by U.S. federal taxing authorities for years before 2011 and for all state income taxes through 2011.

The University applies a 4.5% spending rate to a three-year moving average of endowment investment funds. The Board of Regents sets the spending rate. The purpose of using a moving average is to smooth out any wide fluctuations in the market value. Endowment earnings in excess of the spending rate are added back to the principal of the endowment investments. In years when yield exceeds the amount appropriated under the spending policy the excess is returned to principal as appreciation. When annual yield is insufficient to support spending appropriations, the balance is provided from accumulated appreciation.

In addition to the main study and research collections, the Hillsdale College Mossey Library contains a number of rare and special holdings, including the Ludwig von Mises Library and the Richardson Heritage Room early and rare editions. Ludwig von Mises, the early twentieth century Austrian economist and author of such seminar works as ""The Theory of Money and Credit"" and ""Human Action,"" chose Hillsdale College to be the recipient of his personal library, because of the school's commitment to teach the principles of freedom. This important collection of books, pamphlets, and papers related to free-market economics is housed in the Ludwig von Mises Room in the Mossey Library and is available to Hillsdale faculty and students for research. THE RICHARDSON HERITAGE ROOM contains a collection of rare- and first-edition books that relate to our country's founding and early American history. A bibliography of the collection is available at www.hillsdale.edu. LIBERTY WALK - the mission of Hillsdale College, which has guided the school since its 1844 founding, is to preserve the blessings of civil and religious liberty through ""the diffusion of learning."" The Liberty Walk project is a marvelous example of teaching and learning through objects of art. This collection of over-life-size statues provides visible testimony to the lives of historic defenders of freedom. It calls the citizen observer to vigilance in defending and upholding the principles of freedom. It stands as a constant reminder of the previous nature of freedom and the strength and sacrifice required to preserve it. To date, the collection includes seven statues: The Alpha Kappa Phi Civil War Soldiers' Monument, 1895; George Washington, 2003; Winston Churchill, 2004; Margaret Thatcher, 2008; Thomas Jefferson, 2009; Abraham Lincoln, 2009; and Ronald Reagan, 2011.

The University files a Form 990 annually. When these returns are filed , it is highly certain that some positions taken would be sustained upon examination by the taxing authorities, while others are subject to uncertainty about the merits of the tax position taken or the amount of the position that would ultimately be sustained. Examples of tax positions common to universities include such matters as the following: the tax exempt status of each entity and various positions relative to potential sources of unrelated business income tax (UBIT). UBIT is reported on Form 990-T, as appropriate. The benefit of a tax position is recognized in the financial statements in the period during which, based on all available evidence, management believes that it is more likely than not that the position will be sustained upon examination, including the resolution of appeals or litigation processes, if any. Tax positions are not offset or aggregated with other positions. Tax positions that meet the ""more likely than not"" recognition threshold are measured as the largest amount of tax benefit that is more than 50% likely to be realized on settlement with the applicable taxing authority. The portion of the benefits associated with tax positions taken that exceeds the amount measured as described above would be reflected as a liability for uncertain tax benefits in the accompanying statements of financial position along with any associated interest and penalties that would be payable to the taxing authorities upon examination. As of June 30, 2015 and 2014, there were no uncertain tax positions identified. The University does not expect the total amount of unrecognized tax benefits to significantly change in the next 12 months. Forms 990 and 990-T filed by the University are subject to the examination by the IRS up to three years from the extended due date of each return. Management believes the Forms 990 and 990-T have been filed appropriately. Forms 990 and 990-T filed by the University are no longer subject to examination for the fiscal years ended June 30, 2011 or prior. The University would recognize interest and penalties related to unrecognized tax positions in interest and income tax expense, respectively.

The permanent endowment is not reduced by losses on the investments, except to the extent required by the donor, or by appropriations from the endowment fund. The accumulated portion of a donor-restricted fund that is not permanently restricted is classified as temporarily restricted net assets until appropriated for expenditure by the College in a manner consistent with the standard of prudence prescribed by Ohio's enacted version of UPMIFA.

Under this guidance, the College may recognize the tax benefit from an uncertain tax position only if it is more likely than not that the tax position will be sustained on examination by taxing authorities, based on the technical merits of the position. Examples of tax positions include the tax-exempt status of the College, the continued tax-exempt status of bonds issued by the College, and various positions related to the potential sources of unrelated business taxable income (UBIT). The tax benefits recognized in the financial statements from such a position are measured based on the largest benefit that has a greater than 50 percent likelihood of being realized upon ultimate settlement.

The University is not classified as a private foundation. The University files a Form 990 (Return of Organization Exempt from Income Tax) annually. When these returns are filed, it is highly certain that some positions taken would be sustained upon examination by the taxing authorities, while others are subject to uncertainty about the merits of the tax position taken or the amount of the position that would ultimately be sustained. Examples of tax positions common to universities include such matters as the following: the tax exempt status of each entity and various positions relative to potential sources of unrelated business income tax (""UBIT""). UBIT is reported on Form 990-T, as appropriate. The benefit of a tax position is recognized in the financial statements in the period during which, based on all available evidence, management believes that it is more likely than not that the position will be sustained upon examination, including the resolution of appeals or litigation processes, if any. Tax positions are not offset or aggregated with other positions. Tax positions that meet the ""more likely than not"" recognition threshold are measured as the largest amount of tax benefit that is more than 50% likely to be realized on settlement with the applicable taxing authority. The portion of the benefits associated with tax positions taken that exceeds the amount measured as described above would be reflected as a liability for uncertain tax benefits in the accompanying statements of financial position along with any associated interest and penalties that would be payable to the taxing authorities upon examination. As of May 31, 2015 and 2014, there were no uncertain tax positions identified. The University does not expect the total amount of unrecognized tax benefits to significantly change in the next 12 months. Forms 990 and 990-T filed by the University are subject to examination by the Internal Revenue Service (IRS) up to three years from the extended due date of each return. Management believes the Forms 990 and 990-T have been filed appropriately. Forms 990 and 990-T filed by the University are no longer subject to examination for the fiscal years ended May 31, 2011 and prior. The University would recognize interest and penalties related to unrecognized tax positions in interest and income tax expense, respectively. The University did not recognize or accrue any interest or penalties as of May 31, 2015 and 2014, and for the years then ended."

The assessment of the tax position is based solely on the technical merits of the position, without regard to the likelihood that the tax position may be challenged. The College is exempt from federal income taxation by virtue of being an organization described in Section 501(c)(3) of the Internal Revenue Code.

When these returns are filed, it is highly certain that some positions taken would be sustained upon examination by the taxing authorities, while others are subject to uncertainty about the merits of the tax position taken or the amount of the position that would ultimately be sustained. Examples of tax positions common to colleges include such matters as the following: the tax exempt status of each entity and various positions relative to potential sources of unrelated business income tax (UBIT). UBIT is reported on Form 990-T, as appropriate. The benefit of a tax position is recognized in the financial statements in the period during which, based on all available evidence, management believes that it is more likely than not that the position will be sustained upon examination, including the resolution of appeals or litigation processes, if any. Tax positions are not offset or aggregated with other positions. Tax positions that meet the ""more likely than not"" recognition threshold are measured as the largest amount of tax benefit that is more than 50% likely to be realized on settlement with the applicable taxing authority. The portion of the benefits associated with tax positions taken that exceeds the amount measured as described above would be reflected as a liability for uncertain tax benefits in the accompanying statements of financial position along with any associated interest and penalties that would be payable to the taxing authorities upon examination. As of June 30, 2015 and 2014, there were no uncertain tax positions identified. The College does not expect the total amount of unrecognized tax benefits to significantly change in the next 12 months. Forms 990 and 990-T filed by the College are subject to examination by the Internal Revenue Service (IRS) up to three years from the extended due date of each return. Management believes the Forms 990 and 990-T have been filed appropriately.

SACKLER MUSEUM) AND FOUR RESEARCH CENTERS (STRAUS CENTER FOR CONSERVATION AND TECHNICAL STUDIES, CENTER FOR THE TECHNICAL STUDY OF MODERN ART, HARVARD ART MUSEUM ARCHIVES, ARCHAEOLOGICAL EXPLORATION OF SARDIS, TURKEY). THE MUSEUMS' COLLECTION CONSISTS OF MORE THAN 250,000 OBJECTS IN ALL MEDIA, RANGING IN DATE FROM ANTIQUITY TO THE PRESENT WITH WORLDWIDE ORIGINS. THE COLLECTION IS AN IMPORTANT RESOURCE FOR THE HARVARD UNIVERSITY COMMUNITY, AS WELL AS TO A BROADER AUDIENCE OF STUDENTS, SCHOLARS, AND THE GENERAL PUBLIC. IT IS USED TO ADVANCE THE KNOWLEDGE AND APPRECIATION OF ART AND ART MUSEUMS THROUGH PROGRAMS INVOLVING RESEARCH, TEACHING, PROFESSIONAL TRAINING, AND PUBLIC EDUCATION. ARNOLD ARBORETUM: THE ARNOLD ARBORETUM OF HARVARD UNIVERSITY IS THE OLDEST PUBLIC ARBORETUM IN NORTH AMERICA AND ONE OF THE WORLD'S LEADING CENTERS FOR THE STUDY OF PLANTS. ADMINISTERED BY THE OFFICE OF THE PROVOST OF HARVARD UNIVERSITY AND A LINK IN BOSTON'S EMERALD NECKLACE OF PARKS, THE ARNOLD ARBORETUM IS A UNIQUE BLEND OF RESPECTED RESEARCH INSTITUTION AND BELOVED PUBLIC LANDSCAPE. WE PROVIDE AND SUPPORT WORLD-CLASS RESEARCH, HORTICULTURE, AND EDUCATION PROGRAMS THAT FOSTER THE UNDERSTANDING, APPRECIATION, AND PRESERVATION OF TREES. COLLECTION OF HISTORICAL SCIENTIFIC INSTRUMENTS: HARVARD UNIVERSITY HAS BEEN ACQUIRING SCIENTIFIC INSTRUMENTS ON A CONTINUOUS BASIS FOR TEACHING AND RESEARCH SINCE 1672. THE COLLECTION OF HISTORICAL SCIENTIFIC INSTRUMENTS, WHICH WAS ESTABLISHED IN 1948 TO PRESERVE THIS APPARATUS AS A RESOURCE FOR TEACHING AND RESEARCH IN THE HISTORY OF SCIENCE AND TECHNOLOGY, HAS BECOME ONE OF THE THREE LARGEST UNIVERSITY COLLECTIONS OF ITS KIND IN THE WORLD. IT CONTAINS OVER 20,000 OBJECTS DATING FROM ABOUT 1400 TO THE PRESENT. A BROAD RANGE OF SCIENTIFIC DISCIPLINES ARE REPRESENTED, INCLUDING ASTRONOMY, NAVIGATION, HOROLOGY, SURVEYING, GEOLOGY, CALCULATING, PHYSICS, BIOLOGY, MEDICINE, PSYCHOLOGY, ELECTRICITY, AND COMMUNICATION. SIGNIFICANT INSTRUMENTS, MADE OBSOLETE BY NEW TECHNOLOGIES, CONTINUE TO BE INCORPORATED. MANY OF THE DOCUMENTS DETAILING THE PURCHASE AND USE OF THE INSTRUMENTS HAVE BEEN PRESERVED, AND ARE AVAILABLE FOR RESEARCH IN THE COLLECTION'S ADJUNCT LIBRARY. MUSEUM OF COMPARATIVE ZOOLOGY (WITHIN THE MUSEUM OF NATURAL HISTORY): THE MUSEUM OF COMPARATIVE ZOOLOGY (THE MCZ) WAS FOUNDED IN 1859 ON THE CONCEPT THAT COLLECTIONS ARE AN INTEGRAL AND FUNDAMENTAL COMPONENT OF ZOOLOGICAL RESEARCH AND TEACHING. THIS 150-YEAR-OLD COMMITMENT REMAINS A STRONG AND PROUD TRADITION FOR THE MCZ. THE PRESENT-DAY MCZ CONTAINS OVER 21 MILLION SPECIMENS IN TEN RESEARCH COLLECTIONS WHICH COMPRISE ONE OF THE WORLD'S RICHEST AND MOST VARIED RESOURCES FOR STUDYING THE DIVERSITY OF LIFE. THE MUSEUM SERVES AS THE PRIMARY REPOSITORY FOR ZOOLOGICAL SPECIMENS COLLECTED BY PAST AND PRESENT HARVARD FACULTY-CURATORS, STAFF AND ASSOCIATES CONDUCTING RESEARCH AROUND THE WORLD. AS A PREMIER UNIVERSITY MUSEUM AND RESEARCH INSTITUTION, THE SPECIMENS AND THEIR RELATED DATA ARE AVAILABLE TO RESEARCHERS OF THE SCIENTIFIC AND MUSEUM COMMUNITY. USE OF THE COLLECTIONS IN STUDENT RESEARCH IS ALSO ENCOURAGED. FISHER MUSEUM HARVARD FOREST: THE FISHER MUSEUM'S MAIN EXHIBIT DISPLAYS TWENTY-THREE INTERNATIONALLY ACCLAIMED MODELS (DIORAMAS) PORTRAYING THE HISTORY, CONSERVATION AND MANAGEMENT OF CENTRAL NEW ENGLAND FORESTS. OTHER EXHIBITS AT THE MUSEUM REPRESENT THE RANGE OF HARVARD FOREST'S RESEARCH. HARVARD UNIVERSITY HERBARIA (WITHIN MUSEUM OF NATURAL HISTORY): THE HARVARD UNIVERSITY HERBARIA ARE AMONG SOME SEVERAL THOUSAND COLLECTIONS OF PRESSED, DRIED PLANT SPECIMENS WORLDWIDE THAT ARE USED BY RESEARCHERS TO FURTHER OUR UNDERSTANDING OF THE PLANT WORLD. SOME OF THE EARLIEST HERBARIA WERE FOUNDED IN EUROPE IN THE EARLY 1600'S, DURING THE DAYS OF EXPLORATION, WHEN KNOWLEDGE OF THE EARTH'S FLORA WAS GROWING AT SUCH A RAPID PACE THAT BOTANICAL GARDENS COULD NO LONGER MAINTAIN LIVING EXAMPLES OF EVERY KNOWN SPECIES. WHILE HERBARIUM COLLECTIONS OF ALL SIZES EXIST TODAY, THERE ARE FEWER THAN 75 HERBARIA WORLDWIDE WITH MORE THAN ONE MILLION SPECIMENS. HERBARIUM COLLECTIONS HAVE BEEN BUILT BY THE EFFORTS OF NUMEROUS BOTANISTS AND PLANT COLLECTORS WHO SEARCHED FROM REMOTE AND ISOLATED JUNGLES TO INNER CITY WASTE LOTS AND RAILROAD TRACKS TO DOCUMENT THE DIVERSITY AND DISTRIBUTION OF THE EARTH'S FLORA. REPRESENTATIVES OF MOST KNOWN SPECIES OF PLANTS CAN BE FOUND IN HERBARIA TODAY, CAREFULLY MOUNTED ON SHEETS OF ARCHIVAL QUALITY PAPER, LABELED WITH IMPORTANT INFORMATION ABOUT THEM, AND STORED ON SHELVES IN CABINETS. IN ESSENCE, A HERBARIUM IS ANALOGOUS TO A LIBRARY OF CAREFULLY PRESERVED PLANTS WHERE THE SPECIMENS THEMSELVES AND THE LABELS ASSOCIATED WITH THEM PROVIDE A WEALTH OF INFORMATION ONCE THEY HAVE BEEN ""READ"" AND STUDIED BY SCIENTISTS. THE SPECIMENS ARE THE KEY TO UNDERSTANDING PLANT RELATIONSHIPS, GEOGRAPHIC DISTRIBUTIONS, ECONOMIC USEFULNESS, EVEN THEIR MOLECULAR MAKEUP. AS WE LOSE NATURAL HABITATS THE WORLD OVER, HERBARIA INCREASINGLY SERVE AS A RECORD OF THE RECENT HISTORY OF PLANT LIFE, AND AS A REPOSITORY OF PRECIOUS GENETIC INFORMATION. HERBARIA HOLD THE TOOLS FOR OUR UNDERSTANDING OF THE PLANT WORLD. MINERALOGICAL AND GEOLOGICAL MUSEUM (WITHIN MUSEUM OF NATURAL HISTORY): THE HARVARD MINERAL COLLECTION RANKS AMONG THE WORLD'S FINEST DUE TO ITS VERY BROAD REPRESENTATION, WEALTH OF RARE SPECIES; LARGE NUMBER OF SPECIMENS DESCRIBED IN THE SCIENTIFIC LITERATURE; AND THE QUALITY OF ITS DISPLAY SPECIMENS. A RICH SYSTEMATIC MINERAL COLLECTION AND DISPLAYS OF GEMSTONES ARE THE PRINCIPAL EXHIBITS IN THE MINERAL GALLERY. THE MUSEUM IS COMMITTED TO THE DEVELOPMENT AND PRESERVATION OF WORLD-CLASS COLLECTIONS OF MINERALS, GEMS, ROCKS, ORES, AND METEORITES FOR RESEARCH, EDUCATION, AND PUBLIC DISPLAY. ITS EARLIEST COLLECTIONS DATE BACK TO THE LATE 18TH CENTURY. THE MUSEUM CATERS TO THE HARVARD STUDENTS AND FACULTY AS WELL AS THE GEOLOGICAL COMMUNITY AT LARGE BY SERVING AS A UNIQUELY RICH RESOURCE OF MATERIALS AND INFORMATION. PEABODY MUSEUM OF ARCHAEOLOGY AND ETHNOLOGY: THE PEABODY MUSEUM OF ARCHAEOLOGY AND ETHNOLOGY IS STEWARD TO ONE OF THE OLDEST AND LARGEST COLLECTIONS OF CULTURAL OBJECTS IN THE WESTERN HEMISPHERE. SINCE THE LATE NINETEENTH CENTURY, THE MUSEUM HAS PLAYED AN ACTIVE PART IN THE HISTORY OF AMERICAN ANTHROPOLOGY AND IN THE EVOLVING RELATIONSHIP BETWEEN MUSEUMS AND NATIVE PEOPLES. THE PEABODY STRIVES TO MAKE COLLECTIONS WIDELY ACCESSIBLE AND ENGAGE ISSUES OF CONCERN TO DIVERSE AUDIENCES. TODAY, THE PEABODY HOUSES MORE THAN SIX MILLION INDIVIDUAL OBJECTS, 500,000 PHOTOGRAPHIC IMAGES, AND SUBSTANTIAL ARCHIVAL RECORDS. STRONGEST IN THE CULTURES OF NORTH, CENTRAL, AND SOUTH AMERICA, AND THE PACIFIC ISLANDS, THE PEABODY IS ALSO CARETAKER TO IMPORTANT COLLECTIONS FROM AFRICA, EUROPE, AND ASIA. COLLECTION TYPES INCLUDE ARCHAEOLOGY; ETHNOGRAPHY; OSTEOLOGY; AND PAINTING, DRAWING, AND PRINTS. SEMITIC MUSEUM: THE SEMITIC MUSEUM IS HOME TO THE UNIVERSITY'S COLLECTIONS OF NEAR EASTERN ARCHAEOLOGICAL ARTIFACTS. THESE ARTIFACTS COMPRISE OVER 40,000 ITEMS, INCLUDING POTTERY, CYLINDER SEALS, SCULPTURE, COINS AND CUNEIFORM TABLETS. MANY ARE FROM MUSEUM-SPONSORED EXCAVATIONS IN ISRAEL, JORDAN, IRAQ, EGYPT, CYPRUS, AND TUNISIA. THE MUSEUM IS DEDICATED TO THE USE OF THESE COLLECTIONS FOR THE TEACHING, RESEARCH, AND PUBLICATION OF NEAR EASTERN ARCHAEOLOGY, HISTORY, AND CULTURE. WARREN ANATOMICAL MUSEUM: THE WARREN ANATOMICAL MUSEUM'S PRESENT COLLECTION CONTAINS APPROXIMATELY 15,000 ARTIFACTS AND CASES INCLUDING: ANATOMICAL AND PATHOLOGICAL PREPARATIONS; VARIOUS WAX, PAPER MACHE, AND DRY PREPARATION ANATOMICAL MODELS; PHOTOGRAPHS, PRINTS, PAINTINGS, AND DRAWINGS; MEDICAL INSTRUMENTS AND MACHINES; AND OTHER MEDICAL MEMORABILIA. ALONG WITH THE WELL-KNOWN SKULL OF PHINEAS GAGE, THE MUSEUM HOLDS MANY OTHER RARE AND INTERESTING ITEMS. AMONG THESE ARE THE PHRENOLOGICAL COLLECTION OF JOHANN GASPAR SPURZHEIM, THE BOSTON SOCIETY FOR MEDICAL IMPROVEMENT COLLECTION, AND A W. T. G. MORTON-TYPE ETHER INHALER. THE MUSEUM PROMOTES THE COLLECTION FOR THE PURPOSES OF MEDICAL EDUCATION IN ALL FORMS WHENEVER POSSIBLE, BY EXPANDING ITS SCOPE TO PROVIDE PUBLIC PROGRAMMING AND EDUCATIONAL RESOURCES TO THE LARGER COMMUNITY. CARPENTER CENTER FOR THE VISUAL ARTS: CARPENTER CENTER FOR THE VISUAL ARTS IS DEDICATED TO THE SYNTHESIS OF ART, DESIGN, AND EDUCATION THROUGH THE EXHIBITION OF EXISTING WORKS AND PRODUCTION OF NEW COMMISSIONS. IT STRIVES TO BRING PEOPLE, IDEAS, AND OBJECTS TOGETHER IN GENERATIVE WAYS THAT PROVIDE UNPARALLELED EXPERIENCES WITH CONTEMPORARY ART, ULTIMATELY ENRICHING THE CREATIVE AND INTELLECTUAL LIVES OF THEIR AUDIENCES."

As such, the College is generally not subject to federal or state income taxes except for certain income derived from unrelated business activities as defined by the IRC. Any such taxes resulting from unrelated business activities are insignificant to the operations of the College. U.S. GAAP prescribes recognition thresholds and measurement attributes for the financial statement recognition and measurement of a tax position taken or expected to be taken in a tax return. Tax benefits will be recognized only if the tax position is more-likely-than-not to be sustained in a tax examination, with a tax examination being presumed to occur. The amount recognized will be the largest amount of tax benefit that is greater than 50% likely of being realized on examination. For tax positions not meeting the more-likely-than-not test, no tax benefit will be recorded. Management has concluded that they are unaware of any tax benefits or liabilities to be recognized at May 31, 2015 and 2014. The College is no longer subject to examination by U.S. federal taxing authorities for years before 2012 and for all state income taxes through 2012. The College does not expect the total amount of unrecognized tax benefits to significantly change in the next 12 months. The College would recognize interest and penalties related to unrecognized tax benefits in interest and income tax expense, respectively.

U.S. generally accepted accounting principles require University management to evaluate tax positions taken by the University and recognize a tax liability (or asset) if the University has taken an uncertain position that more likely than not would not be sustained upon examination by the IRS. Management has analyzed tax positions taken by the University and has concluded that as of May 31, 2015 and 2014, there are no uncertain positions taken or expected to be taken that would require recognition of a liability (or asset) or disclosure in the consolidated financial statements.

All items are stored in a way that assures their safekeeping and preservation for future generations. - We have loaned items from the museum's permanent collection to both public and private museums on several occasions. - The collection is composed primarily of original works on paper. While the collection includes drawings and paintings on paper, by far the largest number of works on paper are prints (lithographs, etchings, intaglio, and screen prints) and photographs. There are a few pieces of ceramics, sculpture, and jewelry in the collection, and at least one painting on canvas. Due to limited storage space and cost of acquiring ""one-of-a-kind"" objects, in 1972 it was the decision of the members of the fine arts faculty to commence the building of a permanent collection of original works of art that would be composed primarily of works on paper."

ITS WORKS-ON-PAPER COLLECTIONS ARE HOUSED IN THE CUNNINGHAM CENTER FOR THE STUDY OF PRINTS, DRAWINGS, AND PHOTOGRAPHS, A STATE-OF-THE-ART STUDY AND STORAGE FACILITY WITHIN THE MUSEUM. SMITH COLLEGE BEGAN COLLECTING ORIGINAL WORKS OF ART IN 1879, ONLY FOUR YEARS AFTER IT ENROLLED ITS FIRST CLASS. INITIALLY, PRESIDENT L. CLARK SEELYE BOUGHT WORKS OF CONTEMPORARY AMERICAN ART, OFTEN DIRECTLY FROM THE ARTISTS THEMSELVES, BELIEVING THAT STUDENTS SHOULD BE FAMILIAR WITH THE ART OF THEIR OWN TIME. AMERICAN ART HAS REMAINED ONE OF THE COLLECTIONS' CORE STRENGTHS. BY THE EARLY TWENTIETH CENTURY, ALFRED VANCE CHURCHILL, THE MUSEUM'S FIRST DIRECTOR, HAD EXPANDED THE COLLECTING SPHERE TO INCLUDE EUROPEAN ART. AT THE REQUEST OF THE COLLEGE'S TRUSTEES, CHURCHILL FORMALIZED THE MUSEUM'S COLLECTING GUIDELINES IN 1920. THESE INVOLVED A ""CONCENTRATION PLAN"" THAT FOCUSED ON THE MODERN ERA, WHICH HE DEFINED AS BEGINNING WITH THE FRENCH REVOLUTION. HIS PLAN EMPHASIZED THE IMPORTANCE OF COLLECTING WORKS OF HIGH QUALITY, WHILE RECOGNIZING THE INSTRUCTIONAL VALUE OF PREPARATORY STUDIES AND UNFINISHED WORKS THAT SHOW AN ARTIST'S WORKING METHOD. GUIDED BY THIS PLAN, THE MUSEUM ASSEMBLED IMPORTANT HOLDINGS OF FRENCH ART OF THE NINETEENTH CENTURY, INCLUDING SUPERB WORKS BY EDGAR DEGAS, JEAN-BAPTISTE-CAMILLE COROT, GUSTAVE COURBET, PAUL CEZANNE, CLAUDE MONET AND OTHERS. THE PLAN WAS REVISITED IN THE EARLY 1990S, AND ACQUIRING WORKS BY WOMEN ARTISTS AND ARTISTS OF COLOR BECAME A COLLECTING PRIORITY. IN THE LAST DECADE, THE COLLECTING PLAN HAS SIGNIFICANTLY EXPANDED TO INCLUDE AFRICAN, ISLAMIC, AND, PARTICULARLY, ASIAN ART TO SUPPORT THE COLLEGE'S GLOBAL CURRICULUM. THE NEWEST ACQUISITIONS TO THE MUSEUM'S COLLECTION INCLUDE WORKS BY JAUNE QUICK-TO-SEE SMITH, ANA MENDIETA, MISHIMA KIMIYO, TADDEO DI BARTOLO, ROBERT MOTHERWELL AND BETYE SAAR.

Deferred tax assets and liabilities are recognized for the future tax consequences attributable to differences between the consolidated financial statement carrying amounts of existing assets and liabilities and their respective tax basis and operating loss and tax credit carryforwards. Deferred tax assets and liabilities are measured using the enacted tax rates expected to apply to taxable income in the years in which those temporary differences are expected to be recovered or settled. The effect on deferred tax assets and liabilities of a change in tax rates is recognized in income in the period that includes the enactment date. In assessing the realizability of deferred tax assets, management considers whether it is more likely than not that some portion or all of the deferred tax assets will not be realized. The ultimate realization of deferred tax assets is dependent upon the generation of future taxable income during the periods in which those temporary differences become deductible. Management considers projected future taxable income and tax planning strategies in making this assessment. Based upon the level of historical taxable losses and projections for future taxable losses over the periods for which the deferred tax assets are deductible, management believes it is more likely than not that Kiara, Inc. will not realize the majority of the benefits of these deductible differences. The deferred tax assets attributable to the net operating loss carryforwards not realized as of June 30, 2015 and 2014 have been fully reserved in the accompanying consolidated financial statements due to the uncertainty of realization. HSHS recognizes the tax benefit from an uncertain tax position only if it is more likely than not that the tax position will be sustained on examination by the taxing authorities, based on the technical merits of the position. As of June 30, 2015 and 2014, HSHS does not have any liabilities for unrecognized tax benefits."

AS A RESULT OF THIS INTERPRETATION, THE COLLEGE CLASSIFIES AS PERMANENTLY RESTRICTED NET ASSETS (A) THE ORIGINAL VALUE OF GIFTS DONATED TO THE PERMANENT ENDOWMENT, (B) THE ORIGINAL VALUE OF SUBSEQUENT GIFTS TO THE PERMANENT ENDOWMENT, AND (C) ACCUMULATIONS TO THE PERMANENT ENDOWMENT MADE IN ACCORDANCE WITH THE DIRECTION OF THE APPLICABLE DONOR GIFT INSTRUMENT AT THE TIME THE ACCUMULATION IS ADDED TO THE FUND.

However, the University is taxed on other unrelated income, if any. The University is subject to federal income tax on rental income. The University follows FASB guidance on accounting for uncertainty in income taxes, which addresses the determination of whether tax benefits claimed or expected to be claimed on a tax return should be recorded in the financial statements. Under this guidance, the University may recognize the tax benefit from an uncertain tax position only if it is more likely than not that the tax position will be sustained on examination by taxing authorities, based on the technical merits of the position. Examples of tax positions include the tax-exempt status of the University, the continued tax-exempt status of bonds issued by the University, and various positions related to the potential sources of unrelated business taxable income (UBIT). The tax benefits recognized in the financial statements from such a position are measured based on the largest benefit that has a greater than 50 percent likelihood of being realized upon ultimate settlement. The guidance on accounting for uncertainty in income taxes also addresses de-recognition, classification, interest and penalties on income taxes, and accounting in interim periods. At June 30, 2015 and 2014, there were no unrecognized tax benefits indentified or recorded as liabilites. The University files Forms 990 and 990-T in the U.S. federal jurisdiction and the required states.

The amount recognized will be the largest amount of tax benefit that is greater than 50% likely of being realized on examination.

The Law School has received a favorable determination letter from the Internal Revenue Service indicating that they qualify for tax-exempt status. The Law School is also exempt from California income taxes under the related State provisions. Management believes that the Law School will continue to be exempt from taxes. As of July 1, 2010, the Law School adopted accounting guidance related to uncertain tax positions. In accordance with this guidance, management is required to determine whether a tax position of the Law School is more likely than not to be sustained upon examination by the applicable taxing authority, including resolution of any related appeals or litigation processes, based on the technical merits of the position. The tax benefit to be recognized is measured as the largest amount of benefit that is greater than fifty percent likely of being realized upon ultimate settlement. Derecognition of a tax benefit previously recognized could result in the Law School recording a tax liability that would reduce net assets. The Law School has reviewed all significant tax positions for material tax jurisdictions including the U.S. federal and California state tax jurisdictions for which the statute of limitations remained open which is generally three years for federal and state taxes and four years for California. The open tax years are 2011 through 2015 for federal and 2010 through 2015 for California tax years and determined there were no material unrecognized tax benefits. However, the statue can be extended if there was a failure to file a necessary tax return. In addition, there have been no material changes in unrecognized benefits since July 1, 2014, nor are any anticipated in the 12 months following June 30, 2015. However, management's conclusions regarding this policy may be subject to review and adjustment at a later date based on factors including, but not limited to, on-going analyses of and changes to tax laws, regulations and interpretations thereof. There have been no related tax penalties or interest, which would be classified as operating or interest expense in the statement of operations."

The John Carter Brown Library collection of 50,000 rare books (printed before ca. 1825), manuscripts, and 16,000 reference books and secondary sources (printed after ca. 1825) is distinguished in many subject areas. Most well-known, perhaps, are the Library's extensive holdings in the literature of European exploration and travel in the Western Hemisphere, from the first Latin edition of the Columbus letter of 1493, through nearly all of the contemporary narratives of Spanish, Portuguese, French, Dutch, and English discovery, exploration, and settlement. The holdings of the library are available to scholars engaged in productive research for whom access to the collection is essential for the advancement of their work. The Brown University Library, in support of the University's educational and research mission, is the local repository for and the principal gateway to current information and the scholarly record. The Brown University Library is comprised of the John D. Rockefeller, Jr. Library; the Sciences Library; the Orwig Music Library; the John Hay Library; and the Annmary Brown Memorial. The John D. Rockefeller, Jr. Library is the primary teaching and research library for the humanities, social sciences, and fine arts. The Sciences Library holds materials that support study and research in the fields of Medicine, Psychology, Neural Science, Environmental Science, Biology, Chemistry, Geology, Physics, Engineering, Computer Science, and Pure and Applied Mathematics, and provides a wide range of services to the staff, students and faculty. The Orwig Music Library houses the general music collection on campus: music books, scores, periodicals, sound recordings, video recordings, and microforms. The collection supports the curriculum of the Music Department and provides material for general use by the Brown community. The John Hay Library houses diverse collections spanning many subjects and time periods, with particularly strong collections in American literature and history, popular culture, military history and iconography, history of science and the art and history of the book. THE ANNMARY BROWN MEMORIAL HOUSES EXHIBITS OF EUROPEAN AND AMERICAN PAINTINGS FROM THE 17TH THROUGH THE 20TH CENTURIES, THE CYRIL AND HARRIET MAZANSKY BRITISH SWORD COLLECTION, AS WELL AS PERSONAL MEMENTOS OF ITS FOUNDER, GENERAL RUSH C.

ASC Topic 740 addresses the determination of how tax benefits resulting from tax positions taken or expected to be taken on a tax return should be recorded in the financial statements. Under ASC Topic 740, the tax benefit from an uncertain tax position is recognized if it is more likely than not that the tax position will be sustained on examination by the taxing authorities, based on the technical merits of the position. The tax benefits recognized in the consolidated financial statements from such a position are measured based on the largest benefit that has a greater than 50% likelihood of being realized upon ultimate settlement.

The Universitys Board adopted a spending policy of 4.75% with a view toward balancing the need for expendable funds for University programs against the need to preserve the endowment against inflation. In order to achieve the objective of maintaining purchasing power, the endowments annual rate of return must equal the annual distribution, plus inflation, plus management, custodial and administrative fees. This distribution to the University is based on a 12 quarter moving average of the market value. This spending method protects the Universitys distribution from increased volatility in the markets. Distributions are provided to students for scholarships, various colleges, and programs in accordance with donor designations. The distributions are reflected in the net assets of the endowment fund. However, there is not a transfer of actual cash from the endowment fund. Without requiring a liquidation of cash, this treatment allows the investments of the endowment to grow."

A tax position is recognized as a benefit only if it is ""more likely than not"" that the tax position would be sustained in a tax examination, with a tax examination being presumed to occur. The amount recognized is the largest amount of tax benefit that is greater than 50% likely of being realized on examination. For tax positions not meeting the ""more likely than not"" test, no tax benefit is recorded. The College recognizes interest and penalties related to unrecognized tax benefits in interest and income tax expense, respectively. The College has no amounts accrued for interest or penalties as of May 31, 2015. The College does not expect the total amount of unrecognized tax benefits to significantly change in the next 12 months. The College has applied this criterion to all tax positions for which the statute of limitations remains open. The tax years open to examination by tax authorities under the statute of limitations include fiscal 2012 through 2014. The College has determined that its tax provision satisfies the more likely than not criterion, and that no provision for income taxes is required at May 31, 2015."

The endowment fund is administered by Presence Health. The University has adopted the investment and spending policies of Presence Health for its endowment Fund. The objective of these policies is to provide the University with a predictable funding stream for its programs while protecting the power of the Endowment Fund. Presence Health's investment policy represents the current consensus of the EndOwment Fund's investment philosophy and shall be reviewed from time to time to ensure that it continues to reflect the appropriate expectations, goals, and objectives for the Endowment Fund. Presence Health has intepreted Uniform Prudent Management of Institutional Funds Act (UPMIFA), as adopted and enacted by the Illinois legislature on June 30, 2009, as requiring the preservation of the fair value of the original gift as of the gift date of the donor-restricted endowment funds absent explicit donor stipulations to the contrary. As a result of this interpretation, the University classifies as permanently restricted net assets: (a) the original value of gifts donated to the permanent endowment, (b) the original value of subsequent gifts to the permanent endowment, and (c) accumulations to the permanent endowment made in accordance with the direction of the applicable donor gift instrument at the time the accumulation is added to the fund. The remaining portion of the donor-restricted endowment fund that is not classified as permanently restricted net assets is classified as temporarily restricted net assets until those amounts are appropriated for expenditure by the University in a manner consistent with the standard of prudence prescribed by the state of Illinois in its enacted version of UPMIFA. In accordance with UPMIFA, Presence Health considers the following factors in making a determination to appropriate or accumulate donor-restricted endowment funds: (1) the duration and preservation of the endowment fund, (2) the purposes of the University and the donor-restricted endowment fund, (3) general economic conditions, (4) the possible effect of inflation and deflation, (5) the expected total return from income and the appreciation of investments, (6) other resources of the University, and (7) the investment policies of Presence Health. Presence Health may appropriate for expenditure or accumulate so much of the Endowment Fund as the University determines is prudent for the uses, benefits, purposes, and duration for which the Endowment Fund is established."

The University has a favorable determination letter from the Internal Revenue Service as part of a group ruling, stating they are exempt from federal income taxes under Section 501(a) of the Internal Revenue Code of 1986 (IRC), as organized under Section 501(c)(3), except for income taxes pertaining to unrelated business income. The Financial Accounting Standards Board issued guidance that requires tax effects from uncertain tax positions to be recognized in the financial statements only if the position is more likely than not to be sustained if the position were to be challenged by a taxing authority. Management has determined there are no material uncertain positions that require recognition in the financial statements. Additionally, no provision for income taxes is reflected in these financial statements, and there is no interest or penalties recognized in the statements of activities or statements of financial position. The tax years ending 2012, 2013 and 2014 are still open for audit for both federal and state purposes."

THE FIRST STEP IS RECOGNITION: THE UNIVERSITY DETERMINES WHETHER IT IS MORE LIKELY THAN NOT THAT A TAX POSITION WILL BE SUSTAINED UPON EXAMINATION, INCLUDING RESOLUTION OF ANY RELATED APPEALS OR LITIGATION PROCESSES, BASED ON THE TECHNICAL MERITS OF THE POSITION. IN EVALUATING WHETHER A TAX POSITION HAS MET THE MORE-LIKELY-THAN-NOT RECOGNITION THRESHOLD, THE UNIVERSITY PRESUMES THAT THE POSITION WILL BE EXAMINED BY THE APPROPRIATE TAXING AUTHORITY THAT HAS FULL KNOWLEDGE OF ALL RELEVANT INFORMATION.

Examples of tax positions include the tax-exempt status of the Institute and various positions related to the potential sources of unrelated business taxable income.

AS REQUIRED BY ACCOUNTING PRINCIPLES GENERALLY ACCEPTED IN THE UNITED STATES OF AMERICA (""GAAP""), NET ASSETS ASSOCIATED WITH ENDOWMENT FUNDS, INCLUDING BOARD-DESIGNATED ENDOWMENT FUNDS, ARE CLASSIFIED AND REPORTED BASED ON THE EXISTENCE OR ABSENCE OF DONOR-IMPOSED RESTRICTIONS. THE UNIVERSITY'S GOVERNING BODY HAS INTERPRETED THE STATE OF MISSOURI PRUDENT MANAGEMENT OF INSTITUTIONAL FUNDS ACT (SPMIFA), ADOPTED IN AUGUST 2009, AS REQUIRING PRESERVATION OF THE FAIR VALUE OF THE ORIGINAL GIFT AS OF THE GIFT DATE OF THE DONOR-RESTRICTED ENDOWMENT FUNDS ABSENT EXPLICIT DONOR STIPULATIONS TO THE CONTRARY. AS A RESULT OF THIS INTERPRETATION, THE UNIVERSITY CLASSIFIES AS PERMANENTLY RESTRICTED NET ASSETS (A) THE ORIGINAL VALUE OF GIFTS DONATED TO THE PERMANENT ENDOWMENT, (B) THE ORIGINAL VALUE OF SUBSEQUENT GIFTS TO THE PERMANENT ENDOWMENT AND (C) ACCUMULATIONS TO THE PERMANENT ENDOWMENT MADE IN ACCORDANCE WITH THE DIRECTION OF THE APPLICABLE DONOR GIFT INSTRUMENT AT THE TIME THE ACCUMULATION IS ADDED TO THE FUND. THE REMAINING PORTION OF DONOR-RESTRICTED ENDOWMENT FUNDS IS CLASSIFIED AS TEMPORARILY RESTRICTED NET ASSETS UNTIL THOSE AMOUNTS ARE APPROPRIATED FOR EXPENDITURE BY THE UNIVERSITY IN A MANNER CONSISTENT WITH THE STANDARD OF PRUDENCE PRESCRIBED BY SPMIFA. IN ACCORDANCE WITH SPMIFA, THE UNIVERSITY CONSIDERS THE FOLLOWING FACTORS IN MAKING A DETERMINATION TO APPROPRIATE OR ACCUMULATE DONOR-RESTRICTED ENDOWMENT FUNDS: 1. DURATION AND PRESERVATION OF THE FUND 2. PURPOSES OF THE UNIVERSITY AND THE FUND 3. GENERAL ECONOMIC CONDITIONS 4. POSSIBLE EFFECT OF INFLATION AND DEFLATION 5. EXPECTED TOTAL RETURN FROM INVESTMENT INCOME AND APPRECIATION OR DEPRECIATION OF INVESTMENTS 6. OTHER RESOURCES OF THE UNIVERSITY 7.

EACH INDIVIDUAL POOLED ENDOWMENT FUND SUBSCRIBES TO OR DISPOSES OF UNITS ON THE BASIS OF THE PER-UNIT MARKET VALUE AT THE BEGINNING OF THE CALENDAR MONTH WITHIN WHICH THE TRANSACTION TAKES PLACE. UNDER THE UNIVERSITY'S ENDOWMENT SPENDING POLICY, FOR OPERATIONAL PURPOSES THE BOARD OF TRUSTEES ANNUALLY DIRECTS THAT A PERCENTAGE OF A THREE-YEAR ROLLING AVERAGE MARKET VALUE OF INVESTMENTS HELD FOR ENDOWMENT PURPOSES BE ALLOCATED AS A DISTRIBUTION OF ENDOWMENT INCOME FOR CURRENT OPERATIONS. FOR 2015, SUCH PERCENTAGE WAS 7%. THE UNIVERSITY HAS ADOPTED INVESTMENT AND SPENDING POLICIES FOR ENDOWMENT ASSETS THAT ATTEMPT TO PROVIDE A PREDICTABLE STREAM OF FUNDING TO PROGRAMS AND OTHER ITEMS SUPPORTED BY ITS ENDOWMENT WHILE SEEKING TO MAINTAIN THE PURCHASING POWER OF THE ENDOWMENT. ENDOWMENT ASSETS INCLUDE THOSE ASSETS OF DONOR-RESTRICTED ENDOWMENT FUNDS THE UNIVERSITY MUST HOLD IN PERPETUITY OR FOR DONOR-SPECIFIED PERIODS, AS WELL AS THOSE OF BOARD-DESIGNATED ENDOWMENT FUNDS. UNDER THE UNIVERSITY'S POLICIES, ENDOWMENT ASSETS ARE INVESTED IN A MANNER THAT IS INTENDED TO MAINTAIN PURCHASING POWER, WHILE REDUCING, TO THE GREATEST EXTENT POSSIBLE, THE POSSIBILITY OF LOSS. THE ENDOWMENT FUND'S RETURN IS MEASURED ON A TIME WEIGHTED TOTAL RETURN BASIS OVER A ONE, THREE AND FIVE YEAR PERIOD OF TIME AGAINST APPROPRIATE BENCHMARKS AND A MANAGER UNIVERSE OF FUNDS HAVING A SIMILAR INVESTMENT STYLE.

ENDOWMENT PAYOUT IS A RELIABLE SOURCE OF CONTINUING SUPPORT AND IS CRUCIAL TO THE FUNDING OF THE MANY LONG TERM COMMITMENTS THAT THE UNIVERSITY MUST MAKE. THE ENDOWMENT MAKES STANFORD LESS DEPENDENT ON OTHER MORE VARIABLE SOURCES OF INCOME. THE ENDOWMENT PAYOUT COVERS APPROXIMATELY 23% OF STANFORD'S TOTAL EXPENSES. STANFORD IS CURRENTLY DIRECTING CONSIDERABLE RESEARCH AND EDUCATION EFFORTS TOWARD ADDRESSING THE CHALLENGES CRUCIAL TO THE WORLD. IN PARTICULAR, IT IS SEEKING SOLUTIONS TO SOME OF THE MOST CHALLENGING PROBLEMS IN HUMAN HEALTH, INTERNATIONAL PEACE AND SECURITY AND THE ENVIRONMENT AND SUSTAINABILITY. STANFORD CONTINUES TO BE ONE OF FEW PRIVATE INSTITUTIONS THAT SEEKS TO ENROLL AND ADMIT THE VERY BEST APPLICANTS, REGARDLESS OF THEIR FAMILIES' INCOME AND PROVIDE SUFFICIENT FINANCIAL AID FOR ALL ADMITTED STUDENTS WHO HAVE UNIVERSITY-COMPUTED NEED, AND WHO MEET STATED FINANCIAL AND ELIGIBLE REQUIREMENTS, TO ATTEND THE UNIVERSITY. ENDOWMENT SUPPORT CONTRIBUTES GREATLY TO THE SUCCESS OF THESE EFFORTS. IN PART AS A RESULT OF ENDOWMENT SUPPORT OF STUDENT AID, STANFORD IS ABLE TO WAIVE THE TOTAL COST OF TUITION FOR MANY OF ITS DESERVING STUDENTS. STANFORD EXPECTS NO PARENTAL CONTRIBUTION TOWARD TUITION FROM PARENTS WITH ANNUAL INCOMES BELOW $125,000 AND TYPICAL ASSETS. THERE IS ZERO PARENTAL CONTRIBUTION TOWARD TUITION, ROOM OR BOARD FOR PARENTS WITH ANNUAL INCOMES BELOW $65,000 AND TYPICAL ASSETS. THE UNIVERSITY IS ALSO MINDFUL OF STUDENT DEBT, AND IT DOES NOT EXPECT STUDENTS TO BORROW TO MEET THEIR NEED. AS A RESULT, STANFORD STUDENTS GENERALLY INCUR LESS DEBT THAN THEIR PEERS AT OTHER UNIVERSITIES. FOR STUDENTS WHO CHOOSE TO BORROW, THE MEDIAN INDEBTEDNESS WAS $16,417 IN FY 15. THAT SAME YEAR, 78 PERCENT OF STANFORD UNDERGRADUATES RECEIVING DEGREES GRADUATED WITH NO DEBT - UP FROM 55 PERCENT IN FY 05 - EVIDENCE OF STANFORD'S GENEROUS AID PROGRAM. THIS FINANCIAL AID PROGRAM IS A DEMONSTRATION OF STANFORD'S COMMITMENT TO ACCESS FOR OUTSTANDING STUDENTS FROM ALL BACKGROUNDS - INCLUDING NOT ONLY THOSE FROM THE LOWEST SOCIOECONOMIC STATUS, BUT ALSO MIDDLE- AND UPPER-MIDDLE-CLASS FAMILIES WHO NEED OUR ASSISTANCE AS WELL. FOR THE YEAR ENDED AUGUST 31, 2015, ENDOWMENT PAYOUT SUPPORT INCLUDED THE FOLLOWING BROAD FUNCTIONS OF THE UNIVERSITY: INSTRUCTION AND RESEARCH $297,066,007 STUDENT FINANCIAL AID $237,370,999 LIBRARIES $19,155,993"

As the organization does not conduct a separate audit of its financial statements, below is the related statement from the Bon Secours Health System, Inc. consolidated audited financial statements: The System and most of its subsidiaries (including certain joint venture entities) are exempt from federal income taxes under Section 501(c)(3) of the Internal Revenue Code of 1986, as amended. The system accounts for uncertain tax positions in accordance with ASC Topic 740. The System's taxable subsidiaries have approximately $84,748 and $61,513 of net operating loss carryforwards as of August 31, 2015 and 2014, respectively, which expire in varying periods through 2035 and are available to offset future taxable income. The System's deferred tax assets are fully reserved at August 31, 2015 and 2014 as the System considers it more likely than not that these amounts will not be recognized. Any changes to the valuation allowance on the deferred tax asset are reflected in the year of the change."
