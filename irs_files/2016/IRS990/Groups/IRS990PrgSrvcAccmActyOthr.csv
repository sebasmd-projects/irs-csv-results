THIS MISSION IS STRONGLY SUPPORTED AND ENHANCED BY THE DEDICATED STAFF PURSUING SCIENTIFIC ACTIVITIES. SINCE 1915, HENRY FORD HOSPITAL PHYSICIANS AND SCIENTISTS HAVE FOCUSED THEIR EFFORTS ON A WIDE VARIETY OF TOPICS CRITICAL TO UNDERSTANDING THE MECHANISMS OF DISEASE AND DEVELOPING NEW, VIABLE TREATMENT OPTIONS. OVER THE PAST YEAR AND A HALF, HENRY FORD HEALTH SYSTEM (HFHS) HAS ENJOYED GREAT SUCCESS IN SECURING EXTERNAL RESEARCH GRANTS AND CONTRACTS. EXTERNAL GRANT FUNDING HAS BEEN RECEIVED FROM THE NATIONAL INSTITUTES OF HEALTH (NIH), OTHER FEDERAL AGENCIES, PHARMACEUTICAL COMPANIES AND INDUSTRY, STATE AND LOCAL AGENCIES, AND FOUNDATIONS, SUCH AS THE AMERICAN HEART ASSOCIATION. IN 2013, $27.4 MILLION WAS AWARDED BY NIH AND OTHER FEDERAL AGENCIES AND $29 MILLION BY INDUSTRY. ""DESPITE THE FACT THAT THE NIH BUDGET HAS NOT KEPT UP WITH INFLATION SINCE 2002, AND THE FACT THAT THE RECENT RECESSION RESULTED IN SUBSTANTIVE FUNDING CUTS, OUR SCIENTISTS AND PHYSICIANS HAVE WORKED DILIGENTLY TO CONTINUE TO SUBMIT GRANTS FOR ALL AVAILABLE FUNDING OPPORTUNITIES,"" SAYS MARGOT LAPOINTE, PH.D., VICE PRESIDENT FOR RESEARCH, HENRY FORD HEALTH SYSTEM. ""WE ARE HOPEFUL THAT OUR RESEARCH ENTERPRISE IS NOW ON A GROWTH TRAJECTORY AFTER SEVERAL YEARS OF STAGNATION."" ALTHOUGH HFHS IS NOT PART OF A UNIVERSITY OR MEDICAL SCHOOL, THERE HAS BEEN SUPPORT FOR THE SYSTEM'S RESEARCH THROUGHOUT ITS HISTORY. THIS DRIVE TO UNDERSTAND DISEASE MECHANISM AND DISCOVER NEW THERAPIES IS MANIFESTED BY THE CONTINUUM OF BIOMEDICAL RESEARCH PERFORMED AT HENRY FORD. THE SYSTEM HAS 80 FULL-TIME RESEARCH BIO-SCIENTIFIC STAFF DOING BASIC SCIENCE STUDIES IN CARDIOVASCULAR AND RENAL DISEASES SUCH AS HYPERTENSION AND HEART FAILURE, STROKE/BRAIN INJURY/BRAIN TUMORS, POPULATION HEALTH AND HEALTHCARE RESEARCH, CANCER THERAPEUTICS, BONE AND JOINT DISEASES, IMMUNOLOGY AND IMAGING, AMONG OTHERS. IN ADDITION, DOZENS OF PHYSICIANS AND THEIR CLINICAL SUPPORT STAFF ARE ENGAGED IN PATIENT-ORIENTED STUDIES. AT THIS TIME, HFHS HAS MORE THAN 1,800 OPEN STUDIES APPROVED BY ITS INSTITUTIONAL REVIEW BOARD, WITH A SMALL NUMBER OF THESE STUDIES ALSO APPROVED IN CONJUNCTION WITH WAYNE STATE UNIVERSITY AND MICHIGAN STATE UNIVERSITY. THE BASIC SCIENCE BIOMEDICAL RESEARCH PROGRAMS RECEIVING THE MOST EXTERNAL FUNDING DURING THIS TIME PERIOD OF GROWTH WERE PUBLIC HEALTH SCIENCES, NEUROLOGY RESEARCH (STROKE, TRAUMATIC BRAIN INJURY, ETC.), HYPERTENSION RESEARCH AND CARDIOVASCULAR RESEARCH (IN PARTICULAR, HEART FAILURE). IN CLINICAL RESEARCH, THE MAJORITY OF FUNDING HAS GONE TO THE DEPARTMENT OF INTERNAL MEDICINE WHERE THE DIVISIONS OF INFECTIOUS DISEASES, GASTROENTEROLOGY, HEMATOLOGY/ONCOLOGY AND CARDIOLOGY ARE LEADING THE WAY. THE INFRASTRUCTURE AT HFHS ALLOWS US TO HAVE A RESEARCH PROGRAM FAR LARGER THAN OTHER NON-UNIVERSITY-BASED HEALTH CARE SYSTEMS IN THE STATE OF MICHIGAN, WHERE OUR NIH FUNDING IS TEN TIMES HIGHER THAN HFHS'S CLOSEST COMPETITOR. IN 2013, HFHS WAS FOURTH IN MICHIGAN, TRAILING ITS THREE LARGEST UNIVERSITIES, AND RANKED 192ND OUT OF ALL 2,495 INSTITUTIONS RECEIVING NIH GRANTS."

201602109349301030,410682405,"Community Care and Community Benefit: In meeting Hazelden Betty Ford's commitment to our mission and the underlying charitable purpose of Hazelden Betty Ford, we invest our time, financial resources and energy helping people and communities understand and address addiction as a treatable disease, and we spread the word that recovery is possible. ""Be of service"" is an integral core value that we demonstrate in a variety of ways. Perhaps the most obvious way we meet our commitment to community is by providing treatment services to individuals and families who seek and qualify for care but are unable to pay the full cost. Our patient aid policy provides that Hazelden Betty Ford will annually establish a target amount of patient aid. Our patient aid awards totaled nearly $9,700,000 in charges forgone in 2015. In addition, the Foundation provides a variety of other benefits for the public good including:Hazelden Betty Ford Graduate School of Addiction Studies: -The Hazelden Betty Ford Graduate School of Addiction Studies prepares future leaders in addiction counseling through the Master of Arts in Addiction Counseling and Master of Arts in Addiction Studies degrees and certificate program. The school emphasizes public engagement as a means of serving its constituent communities. In 2015, students provided more than 4,280 hours of clinical services at agencies reaching underserved and economically disadvantaged populations. The school offers a full scholarship each year to students who work at Chisago County Health and Human Services and we provide continuing education to these Chisago County professionals at no cost. Fifty-eight students graduated with master's degrees from the school in 2015. Overall, more than 92 percent of graduates who seek careers in the addiction treatment field find employment in their home communities or at regional or national treatment agencies. Faculty and graduate school leaders participate in public service events throughout the United States and make research, educational, and scholarly contributions to the field of addiction treatment.Butler Center for Research: The Butler Center for Research (BCR) is dedicated to improving recovery from addiction by conducting clinical and institutional research, collaborating with other research centers, and communicating scientific findings. It is the Center's vision that sustained recovery for all who seek help will be achieved through advancements in knowledge and integration of research into practice. Among the department's many activities in 2015: -As part of Hazelden Betty Ford's commitment to evidence-based practice, over 40 data analysis projects were conducted to inform clinical care and academic programming, identify treatment needs, drive data-based decision-making, set targets for 2016 strategic plan goals, and contribute to the field's knowledge of addiction treatment. In addition, BCR staff was instrumental in setting up a new process of feedback informed treatment, which will be launched across Hazelden Betty Ford sites later this year.-The Huss Research Chair on Older Adults is a collaborative initiative that allows BCR researchers to partner with leading national experts on projects related to older adults with addiction. The most recent Huss Research study examined the effects of naltrexone, an anti-craving agent for alcohol, on treatment outcomes among alcohol dependent adult residential patients. The study also examined whether patient response to naltrexone depends on a particular gene related to an opioid receptor in the brain. Statistical analyses of the data were conducted in 2015 and several manuscripts are currently under review at peer-reviewed journals. -Recruitment and baseline testing continued for the COR-12(TM) research pilot study, with over 140 participants recruited to date. This study will provide the first outcomes data for residential patients enrolled in COR-12(TM) and will allow comparisons between COR-12(TM) and non-COR-12(TM) patients with opioid dependence.-Research Updates were disseminated to professionals, educators, researchers, students, and other stakeholders. Six new Research Updates were created, including one summarizing drinking, drug use, and social norms among adolescents and high school students, co-authored with our Freedom from Chemical Dependency staff. These two-page summaries of scientific findings from the field of addiction treatment are provided at no cost as a community benefit to policymakers, treatment professionals, and the public at large. Research Updates are also available on the BCR's webpage at HazeldenBettyFord.org.-Several manuscripts were submitted to peer-reviewed addiction journals in 2015. These papers focused on several different topics, including the role of spirituality in substance use outcomes and post-treatment functioning, as well as a paper describing the feasibility and implementation of a pay-for-performance program within addiction treatment.-The Butler Center for Research's Dan Anderson Research Award is conferred on an annual basis to recognize a published article that has a significant impact on the field of addiction treatment research. In early winter of 2015, Gail D'Onofrio, MD, professor, Department of Emergency Medicine, Yale School of Medicine, and David Fiellin, MD, professor, Department of Internal Medicine, Yale School of Medicine, earned the award for their study entitled: ""Emergency Department-Initiated Buprenorphine/Naloxone Treatment for Opioid Dependence: A Randomized Clinical Trial,"" published in 2015 in the Journal of the American Medical Association. This study examined the impact of buprenorphine treatment on engagement and retention in addiction treatment among opioid-dependent patients admitted to the emergency room.Medical & Professionals in Residence: The Professionals in Residence (PIR) program and the Summer Institute for Medical Students (SIMS) give medical students, residents, and health care and legal professionals an in-depth experience with the dynamics of the disease of addiction. Intensive one-week programs blend classes presented by Hazelden Betty Ford physicians and expert clinicians with time spent interacting with patients or family members and staff on treatment units or family programs. Participants learn about the latest research and evidence-based methods from our multidisciplinary faculty. -A two-week rotation on addiction for family medicine residents is available in Minnesota and California. A one-year accredited Addiction Medicine Fellowship is available at the Betty Ford Center in Rancho Mirage, California and a Course on Addiction and Recovery Education (CARE) is available worldwide. The Minnesota and California sites offer customized programming for larger groups.-In 2015, the Minnesota and California programs welcomed a total of 523 participants.Institute for Recovery Advocacy: Please reference Schedule C for the description of activities for the Institute for Recovery Advocacy.Community Education: For the first time, Hazelden Betty Ford began live streaming of the speakers at the Betty Ford Center's ""Alcohol and Other Drugs Awareness Hour,"" a great series of free public lectures held since 1976 on select Saturdays throughout the year. Live streaming effectively turns these local events into national public education opportunities, boosting the potential audience far beyond the live venue capacity of 500. Our Speakers Bureau also helped place the organization's wide array of spokespeople at many related events. In all, 105 different employees presented to more than 54,800 attendees at 285 events in 24 states.The Children's Program The Children's Program provides prevention and education services to children and families with addiction. Programs are located in California, Texas and Colorado. No child has ever been turned away because of lack of financial ability to pay (over 90% attend on scholarships). In 2015, 1,504 children and family members participated in the program. Staff of the Children's Program also participated in the Red Ribbon Campaign at numerous schools in the California, Texas, and Colorado areas. Early prevention education and recovery awareness events were held in communities and schools, along with training sessions for school administrators, principals, counselors, and teachers to provide information, resources, and tools regrarding the family disease of addiction.The Beamer Awards: The Beamer Awards, held for the fourth year in a row, generated $700,000 with an estimated net profit of over $400,000. The event's sole purpose is to raise funds for the Children's Program. All proceeds from the event help to underwrite the Children's Program in California, Texas and Colorado."
