The effort to confront the growing prescription pain pill and heroin epidemic was the main focus of the Hazelden Betty Ford Institute for Recovery Advocacy in 2015. By informing audiences and key stakeholders about important issues like this, the Institute's goal is to improve the formulation of policy at its earliest stage. The Institute also supports each Hazelden Betty Ford Foundation facility, its employees and other interested stakeholders by responding to requests and providing them with information on relevant federal, state and local legislation. The Institute was involved in several public forums on the dangers of prescription painkiller misuse. It hosted some of these events and collaborated on others, providing speakers and information as part of its focus on influencing public perception and awareness through education about addiction, treatment and recovery. The Institute organized and hosted two policy symposiums on Capitol Hill-""Preventing Opioid Deaths Among Young People"" in June and ""Preparing Prescribers to Confront the Opioid Crisis"" in October-both with the support of key Congressional caucuses. Combined, the two events drew more than 400 people. Speakers included nine Members of Congress, a key state official from Kentucky, the White House Director of National Drug Control Policy, recovery and medical experts, and public figures. The events, which included the release of a new national survey on youth opioid use, generated significant press coverage and social media activity, and promoted our policy initiatives. Another marquee event took place in August at Northrop Auditorium on the University of Minnesota campus in Minneapolis. There, the Institute helped convene a statewide opioid summit dubbed ""Pain.Pill.Problem.,"" which drew more than 1,000 attendees, generated excellent press coverage and featured high-profile speakers like the governor, the U.S. Attorney for Minnesota and three Members of Congress. In addition, the Institute hosted, sponsored or provided speakers for 20 other events focused on opioids, other policy areas and/or stigma, including school and community forums as well as national and state conventions. In other policy activity, the Institute helped the wider organization's leading doctors provide written and oral testimony to two key Congressional panels, arranged meetings with the White House Office of National Drug Control Policy, and engaged in ongoing dialogue with a number of Members of Congress and their staffs. The Institute also helped lead a grassroots advocacy effort in support of new opioid prescription guidelines proposed by the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention. The Institute continued to play a leading role in the Parity Implementation Coalition (PIC), which advocates for robust implementation of the federal ""parity"" law that expands access to addiction treatment through private health care insurance. Not all of the Institute's efforts were focused on national public policy. In Minnesota, the organization played a role with state lawmakers in making the case for the efficacy and cost-effectiveness of substance abuse treatment in these tight budgetary times. In addition, the Institute hosted and participated in a recovery advocacy seminar in St. Paul. The Hazelden Betty Ford Institute for Recovery Advocacy regularly receives requests for information on addiction, treatment and recovery issues from federal, state and local legislatures and governments. Membership in associations related to the addiction field and the preservation of the services the organization provides allows it to join forces with others sharing similar concerns and interests. The Institute tapped its resources to influence policy and public attitudes by engaging the news media and collaborating with grassroots community-based organizations across the country on local, state and federal policy issues. The Hazelden Betty Ford Institute for Recovery Advocacy advances these Guiding Principles: Addiction to alcohol and other drugs is a chronic illness and a public health problem affecting all Americans; addiction is a treatable illness with measurable outcomes of success, and the Hazelden Betty Ford's treatment modality offers people the best opportunity to find lifelong recovery; standardized treatment outcomes are integral to ensuring that people receive proper care. These outcome standards must also help to define the treatment field's role in the continuum of health care services at the state and federal level; all people with addiction disease deserve to find recovery through a level of treatment and related services that is appropriate to meet their individual needs; the stigma of addiction is a major barrier to recovery; access to care will improve by ending discrimination against people with this illness."
