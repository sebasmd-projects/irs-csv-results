STANFORD IS COMMITTED TO A ""NEED-BLIND"" ADMISSION POLICY FOR U.S. CITIZENS AND PERMANENT RESIDENTS; IT ADMITS QUALIFIED STUDENTS WITHOUT REGARD TO THEIR ABILITY TO PAY, AND PROVIDES A COMPREHENSIVE FINANCIAL AID PROGRAM FOR ALL ADMITTED STUDENTS WHO HAVE UNIVERSITY-COMPUTED NEED, AND WHO MEET STATED FINANCIAL AID ELIGIBILITY REQUIREMENTS. FOR THE FISCAL YEAR, ENDED AUGUST 31, 2015, 85% OF UNDERGRADUATE AND 85% OF GRADUATE STUDENTS RECEIVED SOME FORM OF FINANCIAL AID, WITH A TOTAL OF $368,969,747 OF FINANCIAL AID DISBURSED TO ALL STANFORD STUDENTS. APPROXIMATELY 66% OF THIS AID TOOK THE FORM OF TRANSFERS FROM INTERNAL UNIVERSITY FUNDS TO OFFSET TUITION AND OTHER UNIVERSITY CHARGES THAT WOULD OTHERWISE HAVE BEEN RECEIVED BY THE UNIVERSITY. THE BALANCE OF $135,841,085 REPRESENTS DISBURSEMENTS, PRIMARILY TO GRADUATE STUDENTS, FOR STIPENDS, FELLOWSHIPS AND OTHER STUDENT AID, IN SUPPORT OF ACADEMIC EFFORT. FOR THE VAST MAJORITY OF ENROLLED STUDENTS, THESE AMOUNTS ARE PAID BY DIRECT DEPOSIT TO STUDENT BANK ACCOUNTS IN THE UNITED STATES. AT THE TIME OF CONSTRUCTIVE RECEIPT OF THESE FUNDS IN THE U.S., IT IS POSSIBLE THAT STUDENTS (PARTICULARLY DOCTORAL STUDENTS) MIGHT BE TRAVELING, OR ""LIVING"", OUTSIDE OF THE U.S. DURING THE COURSE OF THEIR ACADEMIC WORK, OR EVEN FOR PERSONAL PURPOSES. STANFORD REQUIRES THAT STUDENTS WHO ARE RECEIVING FINANCIAL AID MAINTAIN THEIR REGISTRATION STATUS, AND BE ENROLLED FOR ACADEMIC CREDIT IN UNIVERSITY-APPROVED PROGRAMS. THE UNIVERSITY DOES NOT BROADLY CONSIDER FINANCIAL AID DISBURSEMENTS IN THE UNITED STATES TO ENROLLED STUDENTS AS ""GRANTS TO FOREIGN INDIVIDUALS"" AND THEREFORE, DOES NOT TRACK PAYMENTS IN THAT MANNER. ACCORDINGLY, ONLY THOSE GRANTS PAID OUTSIDE OF THE UNITED STATES, OR GRANTS FOR USE OUTSIDE THE UNITED STATES FOR PROGRAMS WHICH HAVE A READILY IDENTIFIABLE FOREIGN COMPONENT THAT IS SEPARATELY TRACKED ARE REPORTED ON SCHEDULE F. THE FOLLOWING CATEGORIES OF AID ARE PAID DIRECTLY TO STUDENTS OR SCHOLARS OUTSIDE OF THE UNITED STATES, OR FOR INTENDED USE OUTSIDE THE U.S., AND ARE REPORTED ON SCHEDULE F, PART III. 1. RESEARCH GRANTS: THE UNIVERSITY FUNDS INDEPENDENT RESEARCH GRANT PROGRAMS AVAILABLE ON A COMPETITIVE BASIS TO UNDERGRADUATES. AS WITH MOST FINANCIAL AID, THESE GRANTS ARE DISBURSED IN THE UNITED STATES TO ENROLLED STUDENTS. OPPORTUNITIES TO FORMALLY PRESENT RESULTING ACADEMIC RESEARCH FINDINGS ARE PROVIDED, WHICH CONTRIBUTES TO THE ASSURANCE THAT MONIES ARE USED FOR THE INTENDED PURPOSE. ONLY THOSE AWARDS WHERE THE INTENDED USE OF THE RESEARCH GRANT IS OUTSIDE OF THE U.S., ARE REPORTED IN PART III. 2. SERVICE LEARNING FELLOWSHIPS AND TRAVEL GRANTS: STANFORD'S HAAS CENTER FOR PUBLIC SERVICE AND THE SCHOOL OF ENGINEERING'S GLOBAL ENGINEERING PROGRAM MANAGE PROGRAMS TO ENGAGE STANFORD STUDENTS IN SERVICE LEARNING OPPORTUNITIES. THESE PLACEMENTS ARE CLOSELY MONITORED BY PROGRAM OFFICERS PRIOR TO AND AFTER THEY OCCUR, TO ASSURE MAXIMUM BENEFIT OF THE LEARNING EXPERIENCE. FELLOWSHIPS PLACEMENTS OUTSIDE OF THE U.S. FOR WHICH STUDENTS RECEIVED SUPPORT ARE REPORTED IN PART III. 3. SCHOLARSHIPS: STANFORD MANAGES A CONSORTIUM LANGUAGE PROGRAM LOCATED IN THE EAST ASIA/PACIFIC REGION ON BEHALF OF SEVERAL U.S. UNIVERSITIES. SCHOLARSHIPS TO ATTEND THIS PROGRAM ARE AWARDED BY THE CONSORTIUM, AND ARE DISBURSED FROM STANFORD DIRECTLY TO THE IN-COUNTRY CONSORTIUM PROGRAM OFFICE. THESE AMOUNTS ARE REPORTED IN PART III. 4. OVERSEAS STUDIES PROGRAM-INTERNSHIP STIPENDS: AS PART OF ITS UNDERGRADUATE OVERSEAS STUDY PROGRAM, THE UNIVERSITY IS ABLE TO PLACE ELIGIBLE STANFORD STUDENTS IN LOCAL INTERNSHIPS FOR 3-6 MONTHS. STUDENTS ARE PAID A STIPEND TO COVER THEIR HOUSING, FOOD AND LIVING EXPENSES. UNIVERSITY PROGRAM MANAGERS IN THESE COUNTRIES WORK WITH RECIPIENT ORGANIZATIONS TO MONITOR STUDENT PERFORMANCE AND PROVIDE FEEDBACK. THESE AMOUNTS ARE REPORTED IN PART III AS GRANTS TO INDIVIDUALS, LIVING OUTSIDE OF THE U.S. THE IN-COUNTRY EXPENDITURES RELATING TO EACH OF THE OVERSEAS STUDIES CENTERS ARE REPORTED IN PART I, LINE 3 AS A PROGRAM ACTIVITY. A VERY SMALL PROPORTION OF THOSE EXPENSES ARE REPRESENTED BY CASH PAYMENTS TO STUDENTS FOR PER DIEM MEAL ALLOWANCES. THESE HAVE BEEN INCLUDED AS PROGRAM ACTIVITY EXPENSES, NOT AS GRANTS TO INDIVIDUALS. 5. RESEARCH FELLOWSHIPS: STUDENTS AND FACULTY RECEIVE INTERNAL AND EXTERNAL FUNDS FOR INDEPENDENT RESEARCH. PROJECTS DESCRIBED AS SUCH IN THE FINANCIAL SYSTEM WITH FOREIGN ACTIVITY ARE REPORTED IN PART III. 6. OVERSEAS SEMINAR FEE WAIVERS: AS PART OF THE OVERSEAS STUDY PROGRAM, THE UNIVERSITY OFFERS SEMINARS ABROAD WHICH PROVIDE UNDERGRADUATE STUDENTS THE OPPORTUNITY TO EARN CREDITS WHILE STUDYING ABROAD FOR 3-4 WEEKS. ELIGIBLE STUDENTS MAY QUALIFY FOR FEE WAIVERS. INDIVIDUAL RECIPIENTS ARE REPORTED IN PART III. SUB-AWARDS: SUB-AWARDS ARE PAYMENTS TO THIRD PARTY RECIPIENTS FOR PERFORMING A PORTION OF A STANFORD RESEARCH PROGRAM, MOST OFTEN A SPONSORED-RESEARCH PROJECT. MANY SUB-AWARDS ARE AGREEMENTS FOR CONTRACTUALLY DEFINED DELIVERABLES, USUALLY REQUIRING HIGHLY SPECIFIC EXPERTISE. AS SUCH THEY COULD BE DESCRIBED AS RESEARCH CONTRACTS. HOWEVER, CERTAIN SUB-AWARDS MIGHT ALSO BE CATEGORIZED AS GRANTS, DEPENDING ON THE NATURE OF THE ORIGINATING PRIME FUNDING SOURCE, SINCE THE TERMS AND CONDITIONS OF THE ORIGINATING FUNDING SOURCE GENERALLY FLOW THROUGH TO THE SUB-AWARD. ACCORDINGLY, GRANT-FUNDED SUB-AWARDS ARE REPORTED IN PART II. CONTRACT-FUNDED SUB-AWARDS CONTRACT-FUNDED SUB-AWARDS TO FOREIGN RECIPIENTS ARE REPORTED IN PART I, LINE 3 AS RESEARCH PROGRAM ACTIVITIES. THE PROCEDURES FOR MONITORING BOTH TYPES OF SUB-AWARDS ARE ESSENTIALLY IDENTICAL. AN INITIAL RISK ASSESSMENT OF THE RECIPIENT IS CONDUCTED PRIOR TO THE GRANTING OF THE SUB-AWARD. THIS, TOGETHER WITH AN AUDIT/FINANCIALS REVIEW, PROVIDES INSIGHT ON WHETHER IT IS APPROPRIATE AND REASONABLE TO ENTER INTO THE SUB-AWARD, OR WHETHER ADDITIONAL TERMS MUST BE ADDED TO THE SUB-AWARD AGREEMENT FOR GREATER ASSURANCE OF ITS SAFE-HANDLING. IN ACCORDANCE WITH U.S. OFFICE OF MANAGEMENT AND BUDGET (OMB) CIRCULAR REQUIREMENTS, THE SUB-RECIPIENT IS REQUIRED TO ANNUALLY COMPLETE A QUESTIONNAIRE DESIGNED TO ASSESS CERTAIN ASPECTS OF THE ENTITY'S INTERNAL CONTROLS AND FINANCIAL STATUS. THIS INFORMATION IS COLLECTED AND REVIEWED BY SPONSORED RESEARCH SPECIALISTS. INVOICES SUBMITTED BY THE SUB-RECIPIENT TO THE UNIVERSITY ARE REVIEWED TO ENSURE THAT CHARGED EXPENSES MEET BOTH INTERNAL ACCOUNTING POLICIES, AS WELL AS STANDARDS ESTABLISHED BY U.S. OMB CIRCULAR REQUIREMENTS AWARDS ARE MONITORED ON AN ONGOING BASIS BY MEETING, REPORT OR COMMUNICATION, BY BOTH THE AWARD PRINCIPAL INVESTIGATOR AND THE UNIVERSITY'S SUB-RECIPIENT MONITORING OFFICER TO ENSURE THAT PROGRESS IS BEING MADE AS AGREED."

ITS STUDENTS, FACULTY AND ALUMNI COMMUNITIES ARE SIMILARLY INTERNATIONAL IN CHARACTER, AND SEEK TO COLLABORATE IN AN INTERDEPENDENT WORLD TO UNDERSTAND AND SOLVE GLOBAL CHALLENGES. IN ACCORDANCE WITH THE FORM 990 INSTRUCTIONS, THE UNIVERSITY HAS REPORTED ON SCHEDULE F EXPENDITURES RELATING TO FOREIGN ACTIVITIES WHICH ARE SEPARATELY TRACKED IN THE ACCOUNTING SYSTEM. STANFORD CONTINUES TO INVEST IN ENHANCEMENTS TO ITS FINANCIAL INFORMATION SYSTEMS TO ASSURE THE MOST ACCURATE REPORTING AND CATEGORIZATION OF THESE EXPENDITURES. GRANTMAKING: GRANTS REPORTED ON SCHEDULE F ARE SEPARATELY TRACKED IN THE ACCOUNTING SYSTEM, CATEGORIZED FOR FINANCIAL STATEMENT PURPOSES BY ACTIVITY AND EXPENDITURE TYPE. IT IS CURRENTLY NOT POSSIBLE TO EXHAUSTIVELY REPORT ALL GRANTS WHERE THE INTENDED PURPOSE IS FOR USE OUTSIDE THE U.S. BECAUSE THE PURPOSE OF THE INDIVIDUAL AWARDS IS NOT TRACKED IN THE ACCOUNTING SYSTEM. IN THE CASE WHERE ESTIMATES WERE USED, THE NUMBER OF RECIPIENTS REPORTED IN PART III WAS BASED ON ONE RECIPIENT PER UNIQUE PAYEE, PROJECT, AND REGION TRANSACTION. PROGRAM SERVICES: PROGRAM SERVICES INCLUDE ACTIVITIES RELATING TO THE CORE INSTITUTIONAL MISSION OF TEACHING, RESEARCH AND PATIENT CARE. FOR FINANCIAL STATEMENT PURPOSES, EXPENDITURES ARE REPORTED IN ACCORDANCE WITH GENERALLY ACCEPTED ACCOUNTING PRINCIPLES. THE STATEMENT OF ACTIVITIES REPORTS BY COST OBJECT (SALARIES & BENEFITS, DEPRECIATION AND OTHER OPERATING EXPENSES), WITH ADDITIONAL DISCLOSURE AS TO FUNCTIONAL BASIS OF EXPENDITURES. STUDY ABROAD: STUDY ABROAD INCLUDES OPERATING AND RENOVATION EXPENSES DIRECTLY INCURRED IN REGION. CONSISTENT WITH FINANCIAL STATEMENT TREATMENT, WHERE SALARIES ARE INCURRED, A COST ALLOCATION FOR FRINGE BENEFITS IS ALSO REPORTED. EDUCATION-EXECUTIVE AND PROFESSIONAL DEVELOPMENT: STANFORD'S GRADUATE SCHOOLS OFFER EXECUTIVE EDUCATION PROGRAMS TO FACILITATE LIFE-LONG PROFESSIONAL LEARNING, AND DISSEMINATION OF CURRENT RESEARCH FINDINGS. EDUCATION-TRAVEL STUDY PROGRAM: EDUCATION-TRAVEL STUDY PROGRAM INCLUDES EXPENSES DIRECTLY INCURRED IN REGIONS FOR ALUMNI ASSOCIATION-SPONSORED TRAVEL STUDY TRIPS AND GRADUATE SCHOOL OF BUSINESS GLOBAL STUDY TRIPS. RESEARCH: RESEARCH INCLUDES DIRECT COSTS INCURRED FOR FACULTY RESEARCH PROJECTS IN A SPECIFIC REGION, INCLUDING PAYMENTS FOR PROFESSIONAL SERVICES ENGAGED TO FURTHER THE RESEARCH PURPOSE. RESEARCH SUB-AWARDS: RESEARCH SUB-AWARDS REPRESENT PAYMENT TO FOREIGN SUB-RECIPIENTS FOR CONTRACT-FUNDED SUB-AWARDS THAT RETAIN THEIR PRIME-SPONSOR TERMS AND CONDITIONS AS CONTRACTS. INTERDISCIPLINARY CENTER: INTERDISCIPLINARY CENTER REPRESENTS EXPENSES INCURRED FOR THE OPERATION, SUPPORT, MAINTENANCE, AND MANAGEMENT OF A FACILITY IN THE EAST ASIA/PACIFIC REGION TO HOUSE STANFORD FACULTY, STAFF AND STUDENTS ENGAGED IN ACADEMIC ACTIVITIES IN THAT REGION. FOREIGN TRAVEL: FOREIGN TRAVEL IS CATEGORIZED SEPARATELY IN THE ACCOUNTING SYSTEM TO MEET COST PRINCIPLES OF OMB REQUIREMENTS. FUNDRAISING: FUNDRAISING INCLUDES EXPENSES DIRECTLY INCURRED IN THE REGION FOR FUNDRAISING ACTIVITIES. INVESTMENTS: IN THE INTERESTS OF PRUDENT STEWARDSHIP OF ITS ENDOWMENT FUNDS, THE UNIVERSITY SEEKS TO MAINTAIN A DIVERSIFIED INVESTMENT PORTFOLIO OF ACTIVELY MANAGED FINANCIAL AND REAL ESTATE ASSETS LOCATED THROUGHOUT THE WORLD. DIVERSIFICATION AIMS TO ENSURE THAT THE ENDOWMENT GENERATES RETURNS THAT BOTH MEETS CURRENT OPERATING INCOME NEEDS AND PROVIDES FOR SUPPORT OF FUTURE STUDENTS AND PROGRAMS. THE PORTFOLIO IS CONSTRUCTED ON A FOUNDATION OF MODERN PORTFOLIO THEORY AND STRATEGIC ALLOCATION, SEEKING TO OPTIMIZE LONG-TERM RETURNS, CREATE CONSISTENT ANNUAL PAYOUTS TO THE UNIVERSITY'S OPERATING BUDGET AND PRESERVE PURCHASING POWER FOR FUTURE GENERATIONS OF STANFORD FACULTY AND STUDENTS. THE STANFORD MANAGEMENT COMPANY, A DIVISION OF THE UNIVERSITY, ACTIVELY MANAGES THE ENDOWMENT, ACCESSING MANY OF THE BEST THIRD-PARTY MANAGERS WORLDWIDE TO DEPLOY ITS CAPITAL. THE GEOGRAPHIC ALLOCATION OF THE UNIVERSITY'S INVESTMENTS, AS SHOWN IN SCHEDULE F, IS A RESULT OF THESE FACTORS. THE UNIVERSITY REPORTS IN PART I ITS REGIONAL NET BOOK VALUE INVESTMENT AMOUNTS, CONSISTENT WITH THE IRS 2014 INSTRUCTIONS FOR SCHEDULE F.
