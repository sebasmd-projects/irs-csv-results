Baylor's Financial Aid Office reviews the students' cumulative grade point averages every year and awards/reviews academic scholarships and fellowships if the required grade point average level is satisfied. Scholarships for financial need are awarded annually based upon whether the need criterion/level is established or maintained per the completed Application for Federal Student Aid. The scholarship awards cannot exceed the cost of a student to attend the University. Travel Grants - Travel grants are awarded to students to offset travel expenses used for educational purposes such as attending a conference, presenting a paper, etc. The awarding of travel grants is based upon an application process and meeting a set of criteria that establish the benefits to the students' educational endeavors. Research Grants - The Office of the Vice Provost for Research (OVPR) publishes guidelines for each of the internal grant programs that provide the general conditions of the award, as well as guidance on the expenses that may be charged to the award. Each grant is set up as a separate project in the University's financial system based on the award amount and budget categories approved by the OVPR and administered through the Office of Sponsored Programs. The financial system provides real time access to a Budget Summary Report for the project that provides a comparison of budgeted expenditures to cumulative actual expenditures by expenditure category. This report can be accessed by the Project Manager and others with administrative and financial oversight responsibilities. Expenditure transactions under internal grant programs are subject to internal controls for approval and processing similar to other University expenditure transactions. The system does not allow expenditures to be processed in excess of or outside of the approved budget categories. Student Awards - These awards are provided to students for winning educational competitions. The purpose of the competitions is to further the education of students. Grants and Other Assistance to Governments and Organizations in the United States: The University enters into a contract with the grant recipient that describes the recipient's responsibilities for the use of the grant funds. Under the terms of the contract, recipients are required to submit quarterly and final written progress reports to the principal investigator (""PI"") or project director for the grant, and funds are paid to the recipient on a cost reimbursable basis. When the grant recipient submits an invoice for reimbursement, the PI reviews the invoice to ensure the expenditures are consistent with the established budget and with the work completed to date, prior to approving the amount for payment. Grant recipients subject to the U.S. Office of Management and Budget Circular A-133 Audits of States, Local Governments, and Non-Profit Organizations are also required to provide certification of their compliance with the financial audit requirements of those guidelines prior to receiving funds. Thereafter, the University requires an annual certification of continuing compliance and a copy of their most recent audit report. If any of the above processes indicate an area of concern, site visits may be conducted by the University to review the programmatic and/or financial records. Charitable organizations that receive contributions from the University are carefully selected and must be approved through the Vice President for Constituent Engagement & Chief of Staff.

Financial aid from the University and other sources is viewed only as supplementary to the efforts of the student and the student's family. Students requesting financial aid are expected to contribute toward their educational expenses through summer or university employment and/or loans in any reasonable combination. Financial aid is an important factor for many students, and 100 percent of eligible Manchester University students receive some combination of grants, scholarships, loans, and work. Student Financial Services will determine a student's eligibility for financial aid by using the results of the Free Application for Federal Student Aid (FAFSA); the estimated family contribution (EFC) and review of edit (c-codes), as well as the student's academic records and funds available. Manchester University utilizes an awarding matrix based on a combination of academic and financial need criteria referenced above. Student Financial Services administers financial aid from federal, state, and institutional resources utilizing the federal guidelines established by the U.S. Department of Education. The following steps must be taken by a student to receive a financial aid package from Manchester University: 1. Apply for admission and be admitted to Manchester University. Eligibility for academic scholarships from the University is determined through the admission process. 2. Submit a FAFSA. Eligibility for federal, state and institutional need based grants and loans is determined through this process. The student must designate the results be sent to Manchester University, and Indiana students must have a receipt date between Jan.1 and March 10 to be considered for state grant eligibility. 3. Submit any additional documentation requested by Student Financial Services. Enrollment Requirements. Students receiving financial aid must maintain full-time enrollment (a minimum of 12 semester hours) in each of the fall and spring semesters. There are circumstances in which part-time students demonstrating need may be awarded financial aid depending on the guidelines and availability of federal, state and institutional funding. Part-time students must enroll in a minimum of six hours to maintain eligibility for institutional funds and loans. Degree Requirements. Students must be working toward their first baccalaureate degree to be eligible for federal, state or institutional grants and scholarships.

The posting of additional scholarships triggers a re-evaluation of the student's eligibility for federally funded student loans, which may result in adjustments to the student's loan awarded.
