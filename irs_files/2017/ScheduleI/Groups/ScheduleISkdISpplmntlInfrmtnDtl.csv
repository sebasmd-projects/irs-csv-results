All grantees receive a written grant agreement which indicates whether lobbying is permissible and by accepting payment, the grantee agrees to the conditions of the award, which provide assurance that funds will not be used for any prohibited purpose. If a grant is restricted to a particular non-lobbying purpose, organizations further agree that (i) any portion of the grant not used for the stated purpose must be repaid, (ii) any change of purpose must be requested and approved in advance, in writing and (iii) not to use any portion of the grant to carry on propaganda or to attempt to influence specific legislation either by direct or grassroots lobbying.Based on a risk assessment, a progress report may be required for certain grants nine months after the grant award. The grantee is asked to submit a two page narrative describing the use of the funds and activities undertaken as a result of the grant (including lobbying activity, if permitted), along with a financial report."

201602149349300040,521231931,"part I, Line 2","HUD Section 4 Program ThY majority of pass through funding utilized by Enterprise is through the Section 4 program, a capacity building program administered by the Department of Housing & Urban Development. Each year since the early 1990s, Congress has appropriated funds to the Section 4 program. Eligible applicants for this funding have been limited to Habitat for Humanity, Local Initiatives Support Corporation, and Enterprise Community Partners. Of each annual award received a portion of the funds is restricted to use within rural areas of the country. Eligible activities under the Section 4 program are capacity building activities, provided directly to CDCs and CHDOs by Enterprise staff, consultants, trainings and grants; predevelopment activities via grants and loans; and other activities authorized by the secretary of HUD. After receipt of the award, Enterprise's senior management allocates funding to initiatives and markets through an allocation process. After funds are allocated, specific work plans and detailed budgets are developed and submitted to HUD for approval. Once work plans are approved, funds can be committed and drawn. Coding expenses and time to a specific work plan draws funds utilized internally. Pass through funding in a work plan is awarded to organizations through a RFP process, or in unique situations, through a sole source process. After the grantee selection process is complete, a grant request package is submitted to Grants and Contracts Management for processing. Some work plans include funding for predevelopment and working capital loans. These loans are administered by Enterprise Community Loan Fund. Privately Funded Grants Enterprise receives funds from various private funding sources. Some funders include Citi Foundation, Bank of America, Kresge Foundation, etc. Many of the private funders restrict the uses of their funds to specific programs, geography or uses. Enterprise program staff determines the most appropriate use of these funds within their specific program areas. Typical uses of private funding include staff time, pass through grants and consultants. Pass Through Grant Process Once an organization has been selected to receive a grant, a grant request is completed and submitted to Grants and Contracts Management. We utilize the ""cloud"" based Salesforce system whereby Enterprise field staff enter and upload all required information into a grant request. A grant request consists of work plan, budget, organizational due diligence documents such as financial audits, financial assessment, etc. Field staff initiate a workflow process in Salesforce to request and document approvals from program staff, funding managers, and Grants and Contracts Management staff. Grants and Contracts Management utilize Salesforce and complementary software to generate the grant agreement and documents are reviewed for compliance with funder program and budget requirements. The organization's status is also checked on ""Charity Checkagainst the federal government's System for Award Management. After compliance review is complete, a grant agreement is emailed via an Adobe-Flash supported link to Salesforce to the organization with instructions to print out two copies, sign both copies and return to Enterprise for counter signature. We accept either scanned copies of the signed originals or hard copies. Upon receipt, one original fully executed copy of the grant agreement is mailed back to the organization, and one original agreement is maintained at Enterprise's headquarters. To receive grant funds, the organization must complete and submit a disbursement request form which contains a narrative progress report and a line item budget to actual form which lists the expenses that were incurred during the requested timeframe or pursuant to the terms of the specific grant award. The disbursement request is reviewed and approved for payment by the program staff and then forwarded to Contracts Administration via a Salesforce workflow process, and reviewed for compliance and validation. Once Contracts verifies that all documentation is in order, project codes are correct and that there is available funding, the disbursement request is forwarded via hard copy to Accounting for payment."
