201623209349312427,263162145,"SCHEDULE H, PART V, SECTION B, LINE 5 - INPUT FROM COMMUNITY","IU Health Arnett's approach to gathering qualitative data for its CHNA consisted of a multi-component approach to identify and verify community health needs for the IU Health Arnett service area. This included the following two components: 1. Hosting a one-and-a-half to two-hour community conversation focus group with public health officials and community leaders to discuss the healthcare needs of the service area and what role IU Health Arnett could play in addressing the identified needs. 2. Surveying the community-at-large through the hospital's website and in paper surveys, with special attention paid to gathering input from low income, uninsured or minority groups. Local leaders with a stake in the community's health were invited to attend focus group sessions held at IU Health Arnett. Attendees from organizations, such as the Tippecanoe County Health Department, Mental Health America, Wabash Center, YMCA, United Way, and the Salvation Army among others participated in the focus group. To obtain a more complete picture of the factors that play into the health of people living in Tippecanoe County, input from local health leaders was gathered through two separate focus group sessions. The session lasted two hours and was held live at IU Health Arnett Hospital. IU Health Arnett facilitators mailed letters and made follow-up telephone calls inviting public health officials and community leaders to attend the focus group discussion, paying special attention to include organizations that represent the interest of low-income, minority and uninsured individuals. The goal of soliciting these leaders feedback was to gather insights into the quantitative data that may not be easily identified from the secondary statistical data alone. Upon arrival at the focus group, participants were asked to identify and prioritize five health needs for the IU Health Arnett community that they believed to be most important. These responses were collected and aggregated into a comprehensive list of identified needs to be further discussed later in the session and ranked for severity of need within the community. IU Health Arnett facilitators then provided participants with a presentation featuring the mission of IU Health, current outreach priorities and local health data which included demographics, insurance information, poverty rates, county health rankings, causes of death, physical activity, chronic conditions, preventive behaviors and a community needs index. Upon completion of the data presentation, IU Health facilitated a discussion on the comprehensive list of identified needs collected earlier in the session. The objective of this method was to inspire candid discussion. After the discussion, each participant again prioritized five health needs. The votes on the five prioritized health needs were tallied and final input from the group was encouraged during this process in order to validate the previously identified needs. Following additional discussion, participants were also asked to address what they thought the role of IU Health Arnett could be in meeting the local health needs."

This method prioritizes identified needs based upon the prevalence and severity of the need and the effectiveness of interventions available to address the needs. Based upon the Hanlon Method of prioritization, IU Health Arnett selected the following four needs to be addressed: - Access to Healthcare - Nutrition and Active Living - Behavioral Health - Chronic Disease Management Access to Healthcare IU Health Arnett's implementation strategy to address the identified need of access to healthcare includes the following: - Provide financial assistance and information on prescription assistance to those in need - Prescription Discount Cards - Low cost physicals for high school athletes - Car safety seat checks - Support groups (Cancer/Obesity/Breastfeeding/diabetes) - Work with city bus to obtain route to the hospital and new medical office building Nutrition and Active Living IU Health Arnett's implementation strategy to address the identified need of nutrition and active living includes the following: - Community Walking programs - Strong Schools Glen Acres, Murdock, Oakland & Miller - Nutrition Education at Farmer's Markets (4H fair or Farmer's Markets) - Health & Safety Fair - Medical Weight Loss Clinical Trial - Educational Programs at local senior residences - Meals on Wheels Behavioral Health IU Health Arnett's implementation strategy to address the identified need of behavioral health includes the following: - Identify patients who need intervention for drug/alcohol abuse - Educate community members to know the warning signs of those in mental crisis - Teen Texting Program - Tobacco Cessation/1-800-QUIT-NOW - Provide outpatient access to community members requiring behavioral health services - Work in collaboration with Sycamore Springs, River Bend Hospital to serve community members in need of inpatient behavioral health services Chronic Disease Management IU Health Arnett's implementation strategy to address the identified need of chronic disease management includes the following: - Community events that provide health education including, blood pressure and cholesterol screenings, Sleep Quiz, Support Groups and Diabetes education - Aging Brain Program - Provide support for patients/family members supporting those with dementia Also, based upon the Hanlon Method of prioritization, the following identified community health needs were not amongst the needs chosen to be addressed: - Prenatal Health - Injury Prevention - Pre K-12 Education After completing a gap analysis, IU Health Arnett determined that the severity and lack of resources available to address the four needs chosen to be addressed outweigh the severity of and resources available to address the three needs not chosen."

201623209349312427,263162145,"SCHEDULE H, PART V, SECTION B, LINE 13H - OTHER FAP FACTORS","IU Health Arnett takes into consideration several other factors in determining patient eligibility for financial assistance. These factors include the following: 1. Alternate Sources of Assistance When technically feasible, a patient will be required to exhaust all other state and federal assistance programs prior to receiving an award from IU Health Arnett's Financial Assistance Program. Patients who may be eligible for coverage under an applicable insurance policy, including, but not limited to, health, automobile, and homeowners, must exhaust all insurance benefits prior to receiving an award from IU Health Arnett's Financial Assistance Program. This includes patients covered under their own policy and those who may be entitled to benefits from a third-party policy. Patients may be asked to show proof that such a claim was properly submitted to their insurance provider at the request of IU Health Arnett. Eligible patients who receive medical care from an IU Health Arnett facility as a result of an injury proximately caused by a third party, and later receive a monetary settlement or award from said third party, may receive Financial Assistance for any outstanding balance not covered by the settlement or award to which IU Health Arnett is entitled. Said patients may be asked to complete a financial assistance application. 2. Presumptive Financial Assistance Eligibility Patients who are deemed to be presumptively eligible for Financial Assistance will receive a Financial Adjustment to their final statement balance based on the patients individual scoring criteria. Patients are considered to be presumptively eligible for Financial Assistance if the financial need has been determined by the following third parties: Eskenazi Health, formerly Wishard Memorial Hospital, Project Health, Indiana Childrens Special Health Care Services, Medicaid, Out-of-State Medicaid, Healthy Indiana Plan, or Volunteers in Medicine. Patients are also considered to be presumptively eligible if they are pending Medicaid approval or have a hospital bill with a maximum balance to be determined by the Financial Assistance Committee and who meet certain risk segmentation scoring criteria. 3. Additional Considerations Financial Assistance may be granted to a deceased patients account if said patient is found to have no estate. Additionally, IU Health Arnett will deny or revoke Financial Assistance for any patient or guarantor who falsifies any portion of a Financial Assistance application."

These measures include the following: 1. Signs are posted in appropriate acute care settings such as emergency departments and registration areas describing the available assistance and directing eligible patients to the Financial Assistance Application. 2. IU Health Arnett includes a plain language description of its FAP with all patient bills and statements of services. 3.

201623209349312427,263162145,"SCHEDULE H, PART V, SECTION B, LINE 22D - OTHER DETERMINATION OF CHARGES","IU Health Arnett limits the amounts charged for Emergency or other Medically Necessary Services provided to individuals eligible for assistance under its FAP to not more than amounts generally billed to individuals who have insurance coverage for such care. The basis for calculating the amount charged to all patients, including those who are eligible for Financial Assistance, is derived through the use of a chargemaster or physician fee schedule and are uniformly applied. All additional discounts required by insurance contract or IU Health Arnetts FAP are applied to the chargemaster or physician fee schedule calculated amount. IU Health Arnett does not use gross charges in the calculation of the amount to charge a Financial Assistance eligible patient."

A SERIES OF HEALTH FORUMS ARE HELD TO PRESENT THE DATA REPORT CARDS AND GET INPUT ON PRIORITY HEALTH GOALS. THESE FORUMS ARE SET UP BY REPORT CARD COMMITTEE MEMBERS. TO ENSURE DIVERSE INPUT, FORUMS ARE HELD THROUGHOUT THE COMMUNITY AND PARTICIPANTS INCLUDE REPRESENTATIVES FROM HEALTH CARE ORGANIZATIONS, COMMUNITY-BASED ORGANIZATIONS, RESIDENTS, PARENTS AND ADOLESCENTS. BASED ON THE INPUT RECEIVED DURING THESE FORUMS, PRIORITY HEALTH GOALS ARE SELECTED. THIS HIGH LEVEL COLLABORATION AMONG COMMUNITY MEMBERS, PUBLIC HEALTH PROVIDERS AND HOSPITAL SYSTEMS, ALONG WITH THE ROBUST HEALTH ACTION PROCESS OF COMMUNITY INPUT GATHERING, PROVIDES A TRULY COMMUNITY BASED HEALTH NEEDS ASSESSMENT AND IMPROVEMENT PLAN. ASSESSMENT OF THE COMMUNITY CONTINUES IN AN INFORMAL MANNER AS THE COMMUNITY HEALTH IMPROVEMENT WORKGROUP MET MONTHLY THROUGHOUT FY2016 TO DISCUSS ONGOING AND EMERGING NEEDS. --------------------"

201731329349305733,160743209,"PART V, SECTION B, LINE 11 - ADDRESSING THE NEEDS IDENTIFIED IN THE CHNA","FROM THE VARIOUS SETS OF DATA, FROM THE MULTIPLE COMMUNITY FORUMS, FROM THE CURRENT INITIATIVES ACTIVE AND NEW IN ROCHESTER, A LIST OF HEALTH NEEDS WAS ESTABLISHED. SOME OF THE PRIMARY NEEDS INCLUDE: - DECREASE CIGARETTE SMOKING AMONG ADULTS - DECREASE ADULT OBESITY - INCREASE HYPERTENSIVES WHO HAVE THEIR BLOOD PRESSURE IN CONTROL - DECREASE UNINTENDED PREGNANCY RATES - DECREASE STDS/STIS, ESPECIALLY CHLAMYDIA AND GONORRHEA RATES - IMPROVE MENTAL HEALTH AMONG ADULTS AND ADOLESCENTS THE COMMUNITY HEALTH IMPROVEMENT WORKGROUP CHOSE TO PRIORITIZE ""PREVENTING CHRONIC DISEASE"", WHICH CLEARLY INCLUDES THE TOP THREE BULLET POINTS. DUE TO LIMITED RESOURCES AND TO AVOID ""MISSION CREEP"" THE HOSPITAL SYSTEMS CHOSE NOT TO ADDRESS RISKY SEXUAL BEHAVIORS AND MENTAL HEALTH PROMOTION IN THE IMPROVEMENT PLAN. REGARDING ISSUES OF RISKY SEXUAL BEHAVIOR: ALTHOUGH THE MEASURES OF SUCCESS INDICATE THAT MONROE COUNTY IS 'WORSE THAN' THE STATE AND HAS NOT REACHED THE GOALS SET IN THE NY STATE PREVENTION AGENDA, HOSPITAL LEADERS FELT THAT ALTHOUGH THIS ISSUE CERTAINLY AFFECTS THE MEMBERS IN THE HOSPITALS TARGET AREAS, THIS IS NOT A TOP PRIORITY FOR USE OF THE HOSPITALS RESOURCES. HOSPITAL LEADERS FELT THEY WERE NOT THE BEST ENTITY TO ADDRESS THIS PROBLEM. IN ADDITION, THERE ARE COMMUNITY ORGANIZATIONS WHO HAVE THIS GOAL AS THEIR MISSION, AND SEVERAL INITIATIVES THAT HAVE JUST STARTED IN MONROE COUNTY THAT COULD BE QUITE IMPACTFUL. REGARDING ISSUES OF MENTAL HEALTH: ALTHOUGH MENTAL HEALTH IS ALWAYS A CONCERN AMONG THE COMMUNITY, THE COMMUNITY HEALTH IMPROVEMENT WORKGROUP FELT THAT THE DEGREE OF THE PROBLEM WAS NOT AS SEVERE AS SOME OTHER HEALTH ISSUES. ALTHOUGH MONROE COUNTY IS WORSE THAN THE STATE FOR PREVENTION AGENDA INDICATORS, THIS DIFFERENCE IS NOT SIGNIFICANT, SO MONROE COUNTY IS SOMEWHAT IN LINE WITH GOALS AND THE REST OF THE STATE. IN ADDITION, THE HOSPITALS FELT THAT THE LEVEL OF ACTIVITY BEING CONDUCTED BY MANY AGENCIES IN OUR COMMUNITY WAS STRONG. THE TEAM WAS ALSO NOT CONFIDENT IN THE LIKELIHOOD OF SUCCESS IF THE HOSPITALS CONCENTRATED ON ADDRESSING MENTAL HEALTH. THERE ARE OTHER ORGANIZATIONS MORE EQUIPPED, AND ALTHOUGH CERTAIN PARTS OF THE HOSPITALS ADDRESS MENTAL HEALTH TREATMENT, PREVENTING MENTAL HEALTH FROM THE HOSPITAL PERSPECTIVE WAS DIFFICULT TO ANTICIPATE. THE HOSPITAL IS ADDRESSING THE SIGNIFICANT NEEDS IDENTIFIED IN ITS CHNA THROUGH MANY INTERVENTIONS DESCRIBED IN THE IMPLEMENTATION STRATEGY. PROGRESS ON THE IMPLEMENTATION STRATEGY IS WIDELY AVAILABLE TO THE PUBLIC AND CAN BE FOUND ON THE SAME WEBSITE AS THE CHNA (HTTP://WWW.URMC.ROCHESTER.EDU/COMMUNITY-ENGAGEMENT/). IMPLEMENTATION EFFORTS CONTINUE AROUND REDUCING OBESITY IN ADULTS AND SINCE UNIVERSITY OF ROCHESTER IS THE LARGEST EMPLOYER IN THE COUNTY, OBESITY EFFORTS CENTER AROUND WORKSITE WELLNESS. IN FY2015, THE UNIVERSITY OF ROCHESTER HAS LAUNCHED A VARIETY OF NEW PROGRAMS THAT HAVE IMPACTED THEIR WELLNESS PROGRAM DRAMATICALLY. ADDITIONAL EFFORTS HAVE BEEN PLACED ON IMPROVING ENGAGEMENT OF EXISTING PROGRAMS; HOWEVER SEVERAL NEWLY ADDED PROGRAMS ARE BEING IMPLEMENTED. THESE INCLUDE: NEW LIFESTYLE MANAGEMENT PROGRAMS (PHYSICALLY ACTIVE YOU AND BASICS FOR BUILDING A HEALTHY LIFESTYLE), YMCA PARTNERSHIPS FOR EMPLOYEES AND, AS AN INSTITUTION, FITNESS CLASSES THAT INCORPORATE THE SURROUNDING ENVIRONMENT AND A FARMERS MARKET EXPANSION WITHIN THE MEDICAL CENTER. TO ADDRESS SMOKING CESSATION, UNIVERSITY OF ROCHESTER STRONG MEMORIAL AND HIGHLAND HOSPITALS ARE WORKING TO ADOPT AN OPT-TO-QUIT POLICY WHERE IDENTIFIED SMOKERS WILL BE AUTOMATICALLY REFERRED TO THE NY STATE QUIT LINE. EMR CHANGES ARE IN PROCESS AND THE POLICY HAS BEEN IMPLEMENTED AT STRONG AND WRITTEN AT HIGHLAND. IN ORDER TO FACILITATE IMPLEMENTATION, THE CENTER FOR COMMUNITY HEALTH APPLIED FOR AND WAS AWARDED A GRANT FROM THE NEW YORK STATE HEALTH FOUNDATION TO ADVANCE THE PREVENTION AGENDA. FUNDS WERE USED TO REMOVE BARRIERS AT EACH OF THE HOSPITALS AROUND IMPLEMENTATION. ADDITIONAL FUNDS FROM THIS GRANT WERE USED TO HOST A SMOKING CESSATION SYNERGY MEETING. THE GOAL OF THIS MEETING WAS TO BRING A VARIETY OF PROFESSIONALS TOGETHER TO JOIN IN A ROBUST AND ACTION-ORIENTED CONVERSATION ABOUT THE IMPORTANCE OF THE OPT-TO-QUIT PROGRAM AND THE LOGISTICAL STEPS OF EMR AND POLICY CHANGES NEEDED IN OUR HOSPITALS AND FQHCS TO MAKE THE ELECTRONIC TRANSFERAL OF PATIENT INFORMATION TO THE NYS QUITLINE A REALITY. THIS EVENT WAS WIDELY SUCCESSFUL IN BRIDGING THE GAP BETWEEN ORGANIZATIONS AND SYSTEMS AND HAS HELPED TO PUSH THE AGENDA OF THIS INITIATIVE FORWARD. WE HAD 35 ATTENDEES, MAJORITY OF WHICH WERE EMR SPECIALISTS AND PROGRAM COORDINATORS BUT THERE WAS ALSO PHYSICIANS, REGISTERED NURSES, COUNSELORS, EDUCATORS, NURSE PRACTITIONERS, ADMINISTRATORS, QUALITY IMPROVEMENT SPECIALISTS, PHYSICIANS ASSISTANTS, AND PUBLIC HEALTH PROFESSIONALS IN ATTENDANCE.

This included the following two components: 1. Hosting a one-and-a-half to two-hour community conversation focus group with public health officials and community leaders to discuss the healthcare needs of the service area and what role IU Health Arnett could play in addressing the identified needs. 2. Surveying the community-at-large through the hospital's website and in paper surveys, with special attention paid to gathering input from low income, uninsured or minority groups. Local leaders with a stake in the community's health were invited to attend focus group sessions held at IU Health Arnett. Attendees from organizations, such as the Tippecanoe County Health Department, Mental Health America, Wabash Center, YMCA, United Way, and the Salvation Army among others participated in the focus group. To obtain a more complete picture of the factors that play into the health of people living in Tippecanoe County, input from local health leaders was gathered through two separate focus group sessions. The session lasted two hours and was held live at IU Health Arnett Hospital. IU Health Arnett facilitators mailed letters and made follow-up telephone calls inviting public health officials and community leaders to attend the focus group discussion, paying special attention to include organizations that represent the interest of low-income, minority and uninsured individuals. The goal of soliciting these leaders feedback was to gather insights into the quantitative data that may not be easily identified from the secondary statistical data alone. Upon arrival at the focus group, participants were asked to identify and prioritize five health needs for the IU Health Arnett community that they believed to be most important. These responses were collected and aggregated into a comprehensive list of identified needs to be further discussed later in the session and ranked for severity of need within the community. IU Health Arnett facilitators then provided participants with a presentation featuring the mission of IU Health, current outreach priorities and local health data which included demographics, insurance information, poverty rates, county health rankings, causes of death, physical activity, chronic conditions, preventive behaviors and a community needs index. Upon completion of the data presentation, IU Health facilitated a discussion on the comprehensive list of identified needs collected earlier in the session. The objective of this method was to inspire candid discussion. After the discussion, each participant again prioritized five health needs. The votes on the five prioritized health needs were tallied and final input from the group was encouraged during this process in order to validate the previously identified needs. Following additional discussion, participants were also asked to address what they thought the role of IU Health Arnett could be in meeting the local health needs."

This method prioritizes identified needs based upon the prevalence and severity of the need and the effectiveness of interventions available to address the needs. Based upon the Hanlon Method of prioritization, IU Health Arnett selected the following four needs to be addressed: - Access to Healthcare - Nutrition and Active Living - Behavioral Health - Chronic Disease Management Access to Healthcare IU Health Arnett's implementation strategy to address the identified need of access to healthcare includes the following: - Provide financial assistance and information on prescription assistance to those in need - Prescription Discount Cards - Low cost physicals for high school athletes - Car safety seat checks - Support groups (Cancer/Obesity/Breastfeeding/diabetes) - Work with city bus to obtain route to the hospital and new medical office building Nutrition and Active Living IU Health Arnett's implementation strategy to address the identified need of nutrition and active living includes the following: - Community Walking programs - Strong Schools Glen Acres, Murdock, Oakland & Miller - Nutrition Education at Farmer's Markets (4H fair or Farmer's Markets) - Health & Safety Fair - Medical Weight Loss Clinical Trial - Educational Programs at local senior residences - Meals on Wheels Behavioral Health IU Health Arnett's implementation strategy to address the identified need of behavioral health includes the following: - Identify patients who need intervention for drug/alcohol abuse - Educate community members to know the warning signs of those in mental crisis - Teen Texting Program - Tobacco Cessation/1-800-QUIT-NOW - Provide outpatient access to community members requiring behavioral health services - Work in collaboration with Sycamore Springs, River Bend Hospital to serve community members in need of inpatient behavioral health services Chronic Disease Management IU Health Arnett's implementation strategy to address the identified need of chronic disease management includes the following: - Community events that provide health education including, blood pressure and cholesterol screenings, Sleep Quiz, Support Groups and Diabetes education - Aging Brain Program - Provide support for patients/family members supporting those with dementia Also, based upon the Hanlon Method of prioritization, the following identified community health needs were not amongst the needs chosen to be addressed: - Prenatal Health - Injury Prevention - Pre K-12 Education After completing a gap analysis, IU Health Arnett determined that the severity and lack of resources available to address the four needs chosen to be addressed outweigh the severity of and resources available to address the three needs not chosen."

201703199349301790,263162145,"SCHEDULE H, PART V, SECTION B, LINE 13H - OTHER FAP FACTORS","IU Health Arnett takes into consideration several other factors in determining patient eligibility for financial assistance. These factors include the following: 1. IU Healths Individual Solutions Department Prior to seeking Financial Assistance under the FAP, all patients or their guarantors must consult with a member of IU Healths Individual Solutions department to determine if healthcare coverage may be obtained from a government insurance/assistance product or from the Health Insurance Exchange Marketplace. 2. Alternate Sources of Assistance When technically feasible, a patient will exhaust all other state and federal assistance programs prior to receiving an award from IU Health Arnetts Financial Assistance Program. Patients who may be eligible for coverage under an applicable insurance policy, including, but not limited to, health, automobile, and homeowners, must exhaust all insurance benefits prior to receiving an award from IU Health Arnetts Financial Assistance Program. This includes patients covered under their own policy and those who may be entitled to benefits from a third-party policy. Patients may be asked to show proof that such a claim was properly submitted to the proper insurance provider at the request of IU Health Arnett. Eligible patients who receive medical care from IU Health Arnett as a result of an injury proximately caused by a third party, and later receive a monetary settlement or award from said third party, may receive Financial Assistance for any outstanding balance not covered by the settlement or award to which IU Health Arnett is entitled. In the event a Financial Assistance Award has already been granted in such circumstances, IU Health Arnett reserves the right to reverse the award in an amount equal to the amount IU Health Arnett would be entitled to receive had no Financial Assistance been awarded. 3. Alternate Methods of Eligibility Determination IU Health Arnett will conduct a quarterly review of all accounts placed with a collection agency partner for a period of no less than one hundred and twenty (120) days after the account is eligible for an Extraordinary Collection Action (""ECA""). Said accounts may be eligible for assistance under the FAP based on the patients individual scoring criteria. To ensure all patients potentially eligible for Financial Assistance under the FAP may receive Financial Assistance, IU Health Arnett will deem patients/guarantors to be presumptively eligible for Financial Assistance if they are found to be eligible for one of the following programs, received emergency or direct admit care, and satisfied his/her required co-pay/deductible: - Indiana Childrens Special Health Care Services - Medicaid - Healthy Indiana Plan - Patients who are awarded Hospital Presumptive Eligibility (HPE) - Enrolled in a state and/or federal program that verifies the patient's gross household income is less than or equal to 200% of the Federal Poverty Level 4. Additional Considerations Financial Assistance may be granted to a deceased patients account if said patient is found to have no estate. Additionally, IU Health Arnett will deny or revoke Financial Assistance for any patient or guarantor who falsifies any portion of a Financial Assistance application. 5. Non-Emergent Services Down Payment Uninsured Patients presenting for scheduled or other non-emergent services will not be charged more than the Amounts Generally Billed (""AGB"") AGB for their services. Patients will receive an estimated AGB cost of their care prior to IU Health Arnett rendering the services and will be asked to pay a down-payment percentage of the AGB adjusted cost prior to receiving services. In the event a patient is unable to fulfill the down-payment, their service may be rescheduled for a later date as medically prudent and in accordance will all applicable federal and state laws and/or regulations. 6. Emergency Services Non-Refundable Deposit This section will be implemented with a strict adherence to EMTALA and IU Health Policy ADM 1.32, Screening and Transfer of Emergency or Unstable Patients. Amount of Non-Refundable Deposit All Uninsured Patients presenting for services at IU Health Arnetts Emergency Department, via transfer from another hospital facility, or direct admission, will be responsible for a one-hundred dollar ($100.00) non-refundable deposit for services rendered. Patients/guarantors will be responsible for any copays and/or deductibles required by their plan prior to full Financial Assistance being applied. Uninsured Patients wishing to make an application for Financial Assistance greater than the AGB must fulfill their non-refundable deposit prior to IU Health Arnett processing said application. Uninsured Patients making payments toward their outstanding non-refundable deposit balance will have said payments applied to their oldest application on file, if applicable."
