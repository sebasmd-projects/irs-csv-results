201623209349312427,263162145,"Schedule H, Part I, Line 3c - Other Factors Used in Determining Elig.","IU Health Arnett uses several factors other than Federal Poverty Guidelines (""FPGs"") in determining eligibility for free or discounted care under its FAP. These factors include the following: 1. Indiana Residency Requirement IU Health Arnett only makes Financial Assistance available to residents of the State of Indiana. IU Health Arnett employs the same residency test as set forth in Indiana Code 6-3-1-12 to define as resident any individual who was domiciled in Indiana during the taxable year, or any individual who maintains a permanent place of residence in this state and spends more than one hundred eighty-three (183) days of the taxable year in Indiana. 2. Alternate Sources of Assistance When technically feasible, patients must exhaust all other state and federal assistance programs prior to receiving an award from IU Health Arnett's Financial Assistance Program. Patients who may be eligible for coverage under an applicable insurance policy, including, but not limited to, health, automobile, and homeowners, must exhaust all insurance benefits prior to receiving an award form IU Health Arnett's Financial Assistance Program. This includes patients covered under their own policy and those who may be entitled to benefits from a third-party policy. Patients may be asked to show proof that such a claim was properly submitted to their insurance provider at the request of IU Health Arnett. Eligible patients who receive medical care from an IU Health Arnett facility as a result of an injury proximately caused by a third party, and later receive a monetary settlement or award from said third party, may receive Financial Assistance for any outstanding balance not covered by the settlement or award to which IU Health Arnett is entitled. Said patients may be asked to complete a financial assistance application. 3. Presumptive Financial Assistance Eligibility Patients who are deemed to be presumptively eligible for Financial Assistance will receive a Financial Adjustment to their final statement balance based on the patients individual scoring criteria. Patients are considered to be presumptively eligible if the financial need has been determined by the following third parties: Eskenazi Health, formerly Wishard Memorial Hospital, Project Health, Indiana Childrens Special Health Care Services, Medicaid, Out-of-State Medicaid, Healthy Indiana Plan, or Volunteers in Medicine. Patients may also be considered presumptively eligible if they are pending Medicaid approval or have a hospital bill with a maximum balance to be determined by the Financial Assistance Committee and who meet certain risk segmentation scoring criteria. 4. Additional Considerations Financial Assistance may be granted to a deceased patients account if said patient is found to have no estate. IU Health Arnett will deny or revoke Financial Assistance for any patient or guarantor who falsifies any portion of a Financial Assistance Application. A patients income and/or ability to pay may be taken into consideration in the calculation of a financial assistance award. 5. Patient Assets IU Health Arnett will consider patient Assets in the calculation of a patients true financial burden. A patients primary residence and one (1) motor vehicle will be exempted from consideration in most cases. IU Health Arnett will apply the definitions set forth in Indiana Administrative Code 405 IAC 2-3-15 to define a patients primary residence and motor vehicle. A patients primary residence is defined as the patients principal place of residence. The patients primary residence will be excluded from a patients extraordinary asset calculation so long as the patients equity is less than five-hundred thousand dollars ($500,000) and the home is not occupied by the patients spouse or child under twenty-one (21) years of age. One (1) motor vehicle, regardless of its fair market value, may be excluded in limited circumstances defined in Indiana Administrative Code 405 IAC 2-3-15(d)(6). IU Health Arnett reserves the right to adjust a patients Federal Poverty Level (""FPL"") if the patient demonstrates a claim or clear title to any extraordinary Asset not excluded from consideration under the above guidance. IU Health Arnett will not seek the title to discovered Assets without the express authorization of the Financial Assistance Committee."

201623209349312427,263162145,"Schedule H, Part II - Promotion of Health in Communities Served","IU Health participates in a variety of community-building activities that address the social determinants of health in the communities it serves. IU Health and its related hospital entities across the State of Indiana (""IU Health Statewide System"") invest in economic development efforts across the state, collaborate with like-minded organizations through coalitions that address key issues, and advocate for improvements in the health status of vulnerable populations. This includes making contributions to community-building activities by providing investments and resources to local community initiatives that addressed economic development, community support and workforce development. Several examples include IU Healths support of the following organizations and initiatives that focus on some of the root causes of health issues, such as lack of education, employment and poverty: - Riggs Community Health Center - Starfish Initiative - Teach for America - United Way Additionally, through the IU Health Statewide Systems team member community benefit service program, ""Strength That Cares"", team members across the state make a difference in the lives of thousands of Hoosiers every year."

201623209349312427,263162145,"Schedule H, Part III, Line 4 - Bad Debt Expense","IU Health Arnett is a subsidiary in the consolidated financial statements of IU Health. IU Healths bad debt expense footnote is as follows: The provision for uncollectible accounts, for all payors, is recognized when services are provided based upon managements assessment of historical and expected net collections, taking into consideration business and economic conditions, changes and trends in health care coverage, and other collection indicators. Periodically, management assesses the adequacy of the allowance for uncollectible accounts based upon accounts receivable payor composition and aging, the significance of individual payors to outstanding accounts receivable balances, and historical write-off experience by payor category, as adjusted for collection indicators. The results of this review are then used to make any modifications to the provision for uncollectible accounts and the allowance for uncollectible accounts. In addition, the Indiana University Health System follows established guidelines for placing certain past due patient balances with collection agencies. Patient accounts that are uncollected, including those placed with collection agencies, are initially charged against the allowance for uncollectible accounts in accordance with collection policies of the Indiana University Health System and, in certain cases, are reclassified to charity care if deemed to otherwise meet financial assistance policies of the Indiana University Health System."
201623209349312427,263162145,"Schedule H, Part III, Line 8 - Medicare Shortfall","The amount reported on Schedule H, Part III, Line 6 is calculated, in accordance with the Form 990 instructions, using ""allowable costs"" from the IU Health Arnett Medicare Cost Report. ""Allowable costs"" for Medicare Cost Report purposes, however, are not reflective of all costs associated with IU Health Arnett's participation in Medicare programs. For example, the Medicare Cost Report excludes certain costs such as billed physician services, the costs of Medicare Parts C and D, fee schedule reimbursed services, and durable medical equipment services. Inclusion of all costs associated with IU Health Arnett's participation in Medicare programs would significantly increase the Medicare shortfall reported on Schedule H, Part III, Line 7. IU Health Arnett's Medicare shortfall is attributable to reimbursements that are less than the cost of providing patient care and services to Medicare beneficiaries and does not include any amounts that result from inefficiencies or poor management. IU Arnett accepts all Medicare patients knowing that there may be shortfalls; therefore it has taken the position that any shortfall should be counted as part of its community benefit. Additionally, it is implied in Internal Revenue Service Revenue Ruling 69-545 that treating Medicare patients is a community benefit. Revenue Ruling 69-545, which established the community benefit standard for nonprofit hospitals, states that if a hospital serves patients with governmental health benefits, including Medicare, then this is an indication that the hospital operates to promote the health of the community."

Assi","IU Health Arnetts FAP and Bad Debt Referral Policy describe the collection practices applicable to patients, including those who may qualify for financial assistance. 1. Financial Assistance Application Patients or their guarantors wishing to apply for Financial Assistance must submit a Financial Assistance Application within twenty-one (21) days of receiving their first billing statement from IU Health Arnett. Individuals other than the patient, such as the patients physician, family members, community or religious groups, social services or hospital personnel may request a Financial Assistance Application to be mailed to a patients primary mailing address free of charge. IU Health Arnett keeps all applications and supporting documentation confidential. 2. Eligibility Determination IU Health Arnett informs patients or guarantors of the results of their application by providing the patient or guarantor with a Financial Assistance Determination within ninety (90) days of receiving a completed Application and all requested documentation. If a patient or guarantor is granted less than full assistance and the patient or guarantor provides additional information for reconsideration, Revenue Cycle Services may amend a prior Financial Assistance Determination. If a patient or guarantor seeks to appeal the Financial Assistance Determination further, a written request may be submitted, along with the supporting documentation, to the Financial Assistance Committee for additional review/reconsideration. All decisions of the Financial Assistance Committee are final. A patients Financial Assistance Application and eligibility determination will remain in effect for three-hundred-sixty-five (365) days from the date of receipt of a completed application. 3. Extraordinary Collection Actions IU Health Arnett only implements its ""Bad Debt Referral Policyother Extraordinary Collection Action after it has made reasonable efforts to determine whether the patient account is eligible for assistance under its FAP. When it is necessary to engage in such action, IU Health Arnett, and its contracted third parties, will engage in fair, respectful and transparent collections activities. Patients or guarantors who have not applied for Financial Assistance and whose accounts have been engaged in Extraordinary Collection Actions may request Financial Assistance, complete an Application with requested documentation, and be considered for a reduction in their bill if it is within the two-hundred-forty (240) days of receiving their first billing statement. IU Health Arnett may also suspend collection activity on an account while an Application is being processed and considered. IU Health Arnett and its collection agencies will not provide assistance after an account has entered into legal proceedings without first obtaining written consent from its Financial Assistance Committee. The award of Financial Assistance may be subject to successful completion of a payment plan. In the event a patient or guarantor who is receiving Financial Assistance fails to complete the terms of their payment plan, IU Health Arnett reserves the right to submit the unadjusted account balance, less any amount previously paid by the patient, to an Extraordinary Collection Action."

IU Health Arnett assesses the health care needs of the communities it serves by utilizing the detailed community needs assessments undertaken by organizations such as the Tippecanoe County Health Department, the Wabash Center, Riggs Community Health Center and the United Way. After completion of the CHNA, IU Health Arnett reviewed the information gathered from community leader focus groups, community input surveys and statistical data. The needs identified were analyzed and ranked using the Hanlon method of prioritization to determine the prevalence and severity of community health needs and which ones were most critical.

To assist in meeting those needs, IU Health Arnett has adopted a Financial Assistance Policy that provides Financial Assistance to eligible patients receiving Emergency or Medically-Necessary Services. This policy was developed and is utilized to determine a patients financial ability to pay for services. IU Health Arnett goes to great lengths to publicize its financial assistance policy and ensure that patients know they will be treated regardless of their ability to pay. IU Health Arnett shares financial assistance information with patients throughout their entire episode of care and beyond including the admissions process, billing process, and online. 1. Admissions Process IU Health Arnett educates all patient facing team members on its Financial Assistance Policy and the process for referring patients to the program. During the admissions process, opportunities for financial assistance are discussed with patients who are identified as self-pay (uninsured) or if they request assistance information. The patient is also provided with an Admissions Packet that outlines information regarding IU Health Arnetts financial assistance program. Financial counselors are onsite to assist with financial concerns or questions during the patients stay. Patient Financial Services Customer Service representatives are also available after the patients stay to help patients apply for financial assistance, understand their bills, explain what they can expect during the billing process, accept payment (if needed), update their insurance or payor information, and update their address or other demographic information. 2. Billing Process IU Health Arnett includes a plain language summary of its Financial Assistance Policy with all patient bills and statements of services. The plain language summary includes contact information allowing patients the ability to request financial assistance. Additionally, a Financial Assistance Application is mailed to all IU Health Arnett patients with a patient balance due after insurance. IU Health Revenue Cycle Services representatives are available via telephone Monday through Friday, excluding major holidays, from 8 a.m. to 7 p.m. (Eastern Time) to address questions related to Financial Assistance.

IU Health is comprised of hospitals, physicians and allied services dedicated to providing preeminent care throughout Indiana and beyond. National Recognition - Six hospitals designated as Magnet by the American Nurses Credentialing Center recognizing excellence in nursing care. - Ten clinical programs ranked among the top 50 national programs in U.S. News & World Reports 2015-16 edition of Americas Best Hospitals. - Ten out of ten specialty programs at Riley Hospital for Children at IU Health ranked among the top 50 childrens hospitals in the nation. Education and Research As an academic health center, IU Health works in partnership with the IU School of Medicine to train physicians, blending breakthrough research and treatments with the highest quality of patient care. Research conducted by IU School of Medicine faculty gives IU Health physicians and patients access to the most leading-edge and comprehensive treatment options. Collaborative Strategic Research Initiative Conceived by IU Health and the IU School of Medicine in 2012, the Strategic Research Initiative aims to enhance the institutions joint capabilities in fundamental scientific investigation, translational research and clinical trials targeting innovative treatments for disease. The two organizations committed to invest $150 million over five years to this new research collaboration. Established in 2013, the Center for Innovation and Implementation Science is partially supported by the Strategic Research Initiative. The new center, launched by the IU School of Medicine and the Indiana Clinical and Translational Sciences Institute, focuses on increasing efficacy and reducing costs at IU Health. With oversight of four specialized research and discovery units managed by IU School of Medicine researchers, the center will address problems with the potential to reduce costs or generate new revenue estimated at $5 million per year or more. IU Health Statewide System IU Health is a part of the IU Health Statewide System which continues to broaden its reach and positive impact throughout the state of Indiana. IU Health is Indianas most comprehensive academic health center and consists of IU Health Methodist Hospital, IU Health University Hospital, Riley Hospital for Children at IU Health, and IU Health Saxony Hospital. Other hospitals in the IU Health Statewide System include the following: - IU Health Arnett Hospital - IU Health Ball Memorial Hospital - IU Health Bedford Hospital - IU Health Blackford Hospital - IU Health Bloomington Hospital - IU Health Goshen Hospital - IUHLP Liquidation, Inc. f/k/a IU Health La Porte Hospital - IU Health Morgan Hospital - IU Health North Hospital - IU Health Paoli Hospital - IU Health Starke Hospital - IU Health Tipton Hospital - IU Health West Hospital - IU Health White Memorial Hospital Although each hospital in the IU Health Statewide System prepares and submits its own community benefits plan relative to the local community, the IU Health Statewide System considers its community benefit plan as part of an overall vision for strengthening Indianas overall health. A comprehensive community outreach strategy and community benefit plan is in place that encompasses the academic medical center downtown Indianapolis, suburban Indianapolis and statewide entities around priority areas that focus on health improvement efforts statewide. IU Health is keenly aware of the positive impact it can have on the communities of need in the state of Indiana by focusing on the most pressing needs in a systematic and strategic way. Some ways we address our community health priorities as a system include: IU Health Day of Service The annual IU Health Day of Service is a high-impact, one-day event aimed at engaging IU Health team members in activities that address an identified community need. Tackling the issue of obesity in the communities IU Health serves, the seventh annual Day of Service in 2015 focused on leaving behind key physical assets to help meet a statewide need for more venues for physical activity and recreation. During the 2015 Day of Service: - More than 2,200 team members and 6,000 volunteer hours were dedicated by IU Health team members - Created 3 miles of walking trails - Revitalized 18 parks and trailheads - Mounted 7 swing sets - Distributed hundreds of bicycles and bicycle helmets to elementary schools Kindergarten Countdown As one of IU Healths signature programs and collaboration with United Way, Kindergarten Countdown helps hundreds of soon-to-be kindergartners improve their readiness for school. In addition to providing health screenings and vaccinations to students, the program offers assistance to parents in registering their kindergartners for school. Kindergarten Countdown summer camps are designed to provide at-risk youngsters the basic skills they need to succeed in their first year of school. From ""Get Ready to Read"" pre- and post-tests, campers in the IU Health camps achieved a 21 percent average increase in scores from the beginning of the four-week camp to the end. The program also creates positive impact by increasing awareness of kindergarten readiness, improving parent engagement and strengthening relationships between volunteers and team members at hospitals, schools and community organizations. IU Health recognizes that in some cases we dont have all the expertise or resources to address the needs of the community and other organizations are better suited to tackle some of the specific needs of the community. IU Health, therefore, provided financial support to like-minded non-profit organizations that are working to improve the health of the community in our identified priorities of need. Clinical Research Clinical trials are conducted at the following IU Health locations: - Methodist Cancer Center Research Group - IU Simon Cancer Center - Methodist Research Institute - Indiana Clinical and Translational Sciences Institute (Indiana CTSI) - IU Health Arnett Clinical Research - IU Health Arnett Cancer Care - IU Health Goshen Center for Cancer Care - IU Health Ball Memorial Cancer Center - IU Health Ball Memorial Hospital - IU Health Bloomington Hospital - Riley Hospital for Children at IU Health Methodist Research Institute (""MRI"") The Biorepository at MRI, under IRB approval, collects human biological materials (blood, bone, tissue, urine) vital for medical research to provide the best way to study a variety of diseases and their potential treatments. Basic science researchers at MRI publish the results of their innovative grant-supported research in prestigious peer-reviewed journals. Their work has been recognized both nationally and internationally as they participate in system-wide collaborative efforts within IU Health as well as with the IU School of Medicine. Community Health Initiatives With investments in high-quality and impactful initiatives to address community health needs statewide; IU Health is helping Indiana residents improve their health and their quality of life. In 2015, IU Health impacted many people statewide through presentations, health risk screenings, health education programs, and additional health educational opportunities made available to the community, especially to our community members in the greatest need of such services. Examples of the types of programming and investment we make in community outreach areas include: Access to Healthcare One of the first steps to improved health outcomes is having access to healthcare resources. To show its commitment to providing affordable healthcare access, IU Health treats all patients regardless of their ability to pay. IU Health is also working to raise awareness and works to identify individuals within our communities that have barriers to care and connect these individuals with better access and consistency of healthcare resources to meet their needs. Some ways that these IU Health hospitals address Access to Healthcare include: - Public Assistance Enrollment - Veggies and Vaccines - Indiana University Student Outreach Clinic - Indianapolis Public Schools Student Athlete Physicals - Fishers Fire Department QR Code Magnet Program for Immediate Access to Patient Medical Records - Partnership for a Healthy Hamilton County Obesity Prevention To improve the lifestyle of Indiana residents, IU Health has utilized innovative and best practice methods to attack obesity in our communities.

For inpatient services, the limit is the TEFRA target limit. The hospital, on occasion, exceeds the target rate and does not receive full cost reimbursement. The TEFRA target amount is updated by the Medicare program annually by the TEFRA updating factor. However, the amount of the TEFRA updating factor is always significantly less than the actual healthcare inflation factor because the Medicare program includes a ""budget neutrality"" factor for the overall Medicare program. For outpatient services, the limit is the payment to cost ratio (PCR). The PCR was established using a base year, which was 1996, at a rate of 85.5% of cost. The PCR for all exempt cancer centers was 90% through 12/31/15, and then 92% from 1/1/16 to 5/31/16; therefore, the hospital currently does not receive payment for a range of 8% to 10% of its outpatient cost."

The provision for doubtful accounts and the allowance for doubtful accounts relate primarily to amounts due directly from patients. An estimated allowance for doubtful accounts is recorded for all uninsured accounts, regardless of the aging of those accounts. Accounts are written off when all reasonable internal and external collections efforts have been performed. Our collection policies include a review of all accounts against certain standard collection criteria, upon completion of our internal collection efforts. Accounts determined to possess positive collectability attributes are forwarded to a secondary external collections agency and the other accounts are written off. The accounts that are not collected by the secondary external collection agency are written off when they are returned to us by the collection agency (usually within 12 months). Write-offs are based upon specific identification and the write-off process requires a write-off adjustment entry to the patient accounting system. We do not pursue collection of amounts related to patients that meet our guidelines to qualify as charity care. The methodology to determine the bad debt expense reported at cost on Part III, Line 2 is to take the ratio of patient care costs to gross patient charges and multiply this resulting ratio by the gross charges for bad debt accounts."

The notice outlines the level of uncompensated services to be provided and the services which are considered eligible under the uncompensated care policy. This notice will invite public comment from interested parties. This notice will be published prior to modification of the policy and termination of the policy. Communication of the Policy to Individuals Seeking Services at TUHC - TUHC will provide a descriptive notice of the uncompensated care policy to any individual inquiring about the provision of uncompensated services. The notice will include information relative to the uncompensated services provided, eligibility requirements, and the determination process. The notice will identify a location within the hospital at which additional information can be requested. The notice will be provided at all times that uncompensated services are available. Notices highlighting the provision of uncompensated care will be posted prominently in the admissions area, the business office, and the emergency room. These notices will be provided in English and Spanish. The hospital will make a reasonable effort to communicate the meaning of the notices to individuals who may or may not be able to read or understand them. In the event that uncompensated care services are not being provided due to exceeding uncompensated care thresholds, all notification and signage related to the provision of uncompensated care will be removed until such time as uncompensated care services are once again provided."

Originally founded as Smyrna Hospital by a group of physicians in 1974, Adventist Health System acquired the hospital in 1976, making it the first healthcare institution in the Atlanta area affiliated with the Seventh-day Adventist Church. In 1995, Adventist Health System entered into a joint venture with Emory Healthcare, thus creating the first hospital co-owned by two leading healthcare providers. The facility was renamed Emory-Adventist Hospital. In 2015, Emory University acquired Emory-Adventist Hospital and renamed it Emory University Hospital Smyrna. Since 1974, EUHS offered a number of important services to the community including inpatient medical/surgical services, intensive care services, outpatient surgery, diagnostic imaging, outpatient rehabilitative services (physical therapy/occupational therapy/speech therapy), and emergency services. The facility is anticipated to undergo significant renovation in the upcoming years to better meet the needs of its community."

201703199349301790,263162145,"Schedule H, Part I, Line 3c - Other Factors Used in Determining Elig.","IU Health Arnett uses several factors other than Federal Poverty Guidelines (""FPGs"") in determining eligibility for free care under its FAP. These factors include the following: 1. Indiana Residency Requirement Financial Assistance will only be made available to residents of the State of Indiana and those eligible for assistance under 42 U.S.C.A. 1396b(v). IU Health Arnett will employ the same residency test as set forth in Indiana Code 6-3-1-12 to define an Indiana resident. The term Resident includes any individual who was domiciled in Indiana during the taxable year, or any individual who maintains a permanent place of residence in Indiana and spends more than one hundred eight-three (183) days of the taxable year in Indiana. Patients residing in the state of Indiana while attending an institution of higher education may be eligible for assistance under the FAP if they meet the aforementioned residency test and are not claimed as a dependent on a parents or guardians federal income tax return. 2. IU Healths Individual Solutions Department Prior to seeking Financial Assistance under the FAP, all patients or their guarantors must consult with a member of IU Healths Individual Solutions department to determine if healthcare coverage may be obtained from a government insurance/assistance product or from the Health Insurance Exchange Marketplace. 3. Uninsured Patients All Uninsured Patients presenting for services at IU health Arnett eligible under the FAP will not be charged more than the AGB as described in the FAP. 4. Services Rendered by Individual Providers The FAP does not cover services rendered by individual providers. A full listing of providers and services not covered by the FAP is available at www.iuhealth.org/financialassistance and is updated on a quarterly basis. 5. Alternate Sources of Assistance When technically feasible, a patient will exhaust all other state and federal assistance programs prior to receiving an award from IU Health Arnetts Financial Assistance Program. Patients who may be eligible for coverage under an applicable insurance policy, including, but not limited to, health, automobile, and homeowners, must exhaust all insurance benefits prior to receiving an award from IU Health Arnetts Financial Assistance Program. This includes patients covered under their own policy and those who may be entitled to benefits from a third-party policy. Patients may be asked to show proof that such a claim was properly submitted to the proper insurance provider at the request of IU Health Arnett. Eligible patients who receive medical care from IU Health Arnett as a result of an injury proximately caused by a third party, and later receive a monetary settlement or award from said third party, may receive Financial Assistance for any outstanding balance not covered by the settlement or award to which IU Health Arnett is entitled. In the event a Financial Assistance Award has already been granted in such circumstances, IU Health Arnett reserves the right to reverse the award in an amount equal to the amount IU Health Arnett would be entitled to receive had no Financial Assistance been awarded. 6. Alternate Methods of Eligibility Determination IU Health Arnett will conduct a quarterly review of all accounts placed with a collection agency partner for a period of no less than one hundred and twenty (120) days after the account is eligible for an ECA. Said accounts may be eligible for assistance under the FAP based on the patients individual scoring criteria. To ensure all patients potentially eligible for Financial Assistance under the FAP may receive Financial Assistance, IU Health Arnett will deem patients/guarantors to be presumptively eligible for Financial Assistance if they are found to be eligible for one of the following programs, received emergency or direct admit care, and satisfied his/her required co-pay/deductible: - Indiana Childrens Special Health Care Services - Medicaid - Healthy Indiana Plan - Patients who are awarded Hospital Presumptive Eligibility (HPE) - Enrolled in a state and/or federal program that verifies the patient's gross household income is less than or equal to 200% of the Federal Poverty Level 7. Additional Considerations Financial Assistance may be granted to a deceased patients account if said patient is found to have no estate. Additionally, IU Health Arnett will deny or revoke Financial Assistance for any patient or guarantor who falsifies any portion of a Financial Assistance application. 8. Patient Assets IU Health Arnett may consider patient/guarantor Assets in the calculation of a patient's true financial burden. A patient's/guarantor's primary residence and one (1) motor vehicle will be exempted from consideration in most cases. A patient's primary residence is defined as the patient's principal place of residence and will be excluded from a patient's extraordinary asset calculation so long as the patient's equity is less than five-hundred thousand dollars ($500,000) and the home is occupied by the patient/guarantor, patient's/guarantor's spouse or child under twenty-one (21) years of age. One (1) motor vehicle may be excluded as long as the patient's equity in the vehicle is less than fifty-thousand dollars ($50,000). IU Health Arnett reserves the right to request a list of all property owned by the patient/guarantor and adjust a patient's award of Financial Assistance if the patient demonstrates a claim or clear title to any extraordinary Asset not excluded from consideration under the above guidance. 9. Non-Emergent Services Down Payment Uninsured Patients presenting for scheduled or other non-emergent services will not be charged more than the AGB for their services. Patients will receive an estimated AGB cost of their care prior to IU Health Arnett rendering the services and will be asked to pay a down-payment percentage of the AGB adjusted cost prior to receiving services. In the event a patient is unable to fulfill the down-payment, their service may be rescheduled for a later date as medically prudent and in accordance will all applicable federal and state laws and/or regulations. 10. Emergency Services Non-Refundable Deposit This section will be implemented with a strict adherence to EMTALA and IU Health Policy ADM 1.32, Screening and Transfer of Emergency or Unstable Patients. Amount of Non-Refundable Deposit All Uninsured Patients presenting for services at IU Health Arnetts Emergency Department, via transfer from another hospital facility, or direct admission, will be responsible for a one-hundred dollar ($100.00) non-refundable deposit for services rendered. Patients/guarantors will be responsible for any copays and/or deductibles required by their plan prior to full Financial Assistance being applied. Uninsured Patients wishing to make an application for Financial Assistance greater than the AGB must fulfill their non-refundable deposit prior to IU Health Arnett processing said application. Uninsured Patients making payments toward their outstanding non-refundable deposit balance will have said payments applied to their oldest application on file, if applicable."

This includes making contributions to community-building activities by providing investments and resources to local community initiatives that addressed economic development, community support and workforce development.

201703199349301790,263162145,"Schedule H, Part III, Line 4 - Bad Debt Expense","IU Health Arnett is a subsidiary in the consolidated financial statements of IU Health. IU Healths bad debt expense footnote is as follows: The Indiana University Health System does not require collateral or other security for the delivery of health care services from its patients, substantially all of whom are residents of the state of Indiana. However, assignment of benefit payments payable under patients health insurance programs and plans (e.g., Medicare, Medicaid, health maintenance organizations, and commercial insurance policies) is routinely obtained, consistent with industry practice. The provision for uncollectible accounts, for all payers, is recognized when services are provided based upon managements assessment of historical and expected net collections, taking into consideration business and economic conditions, changes and trends in health care coverage, and other collection indicators. Periodically, management assesses the adequacy of the allowance for uncollectible accounts based upon accounts receivable payer composition and aging, the significance of individual payers to outstanding accounts receivable balances, and historical write-off experience by payer category, as adjusted for collection indicators. The results of this review are then used to make any modifications to the provision for uncollectible accounts and the allowance for uncollectible accounts. In addition, the Indiana University Health System follows established guidelines for placing certain past-due patient balances with collection agencies. Patient accounts that are uncollected, including those placed with collection agencies, are initially charged against the allowance for uncollectible accounts in accordance with collection policies of the Indiana University Health System and, in certain cases, are reclassified to charity care if deemed to otherwise meet financial assistance policies of the Indiana University Health System."
201703199349301790,263162145,"Schedule H, Part III, Line 8 - Medicare Shortfall","The amount reported on Schedule H, Part III, Line 6 is calculated, in accordance with the Form 990 instructions, using ""allowable costs"" from the IU Health Arnett Medicare Cost Report. ""Allowable costs"" for Medicare Cost Report purposes, however, are not reflective of all costs associated with IU Health Arnett's participation in Medicare programs. For example, the Medicare Cost Report excludes certain costs such as billed physician services, the costs of Medicare Parts C and D, fee schedule reimbursed services, and durable medical equipment services. Inclusion of all costs associated with IU Health Arnett's participation in Medicare programs would significantly increase the Medicare shortfall reported on Schedule H, Part III, Line 7. IU Health Arnett's Medicare shortfall is attributable to reimbursements that are less than the cost of providing patient care and services to Medicare beneficiaries and does not include any amounts that result from inefficiencies or poor management. IU Arnett accepts all Medicare patients knowing that there may be shortfalls; therefore it has taken the position that any shortfall should be counted as part of its community benefit. Additionally, it is implied in Internal Revenue Service Revenue Ruling 69-545 that treating Medicare patients is a community benefit. Revenue Ruling 69-545, which established the community benefit standard for nonprofit hospitals, states that if a hospital serves patients with governmental health benefits, including Medicare, then this is an indication that the hospital operates to promote the health of the community."
201703199349301790,263162145,"Schedule H, Part III, Line 9b - Written Debt Collection Policy","IU Health Arnetts FAP and Written Debt Collection Policy describe the collection practices applicable to patients, including those who may qualify for financial assistance. 1. Financial Assistance Application Patients or their guarantors wishing to apply for Financial Assistance are encouraged to submit a Financial Assistance Application within ninety (90) days of their discharge. Patients or their guarantors may submit an application up to two-hundred and forty (240) days from the date of their first billing statement from IU Health, however, accounts may be subject to ECA as soon as one hundred and twenty (120) days after having received their first billing statement. Patients or their guarantors submitting an incomplete application will receive written notification of the applications deficiency upon discovery by IU health. The application will be pended for a period of forty-five (45) days from the date the notification is mailed. IU Health will suspend any ECA until the application is complete, or the patient fails to cure any deficiencies in their application in the allotted period. Patients with limited English proficiency may request to have a copy of the FAP, a FAP Application, and FAP Plain Language Summary in one of the below languages: - Arabic - Burmese - Burmese-Falam - Burmese-Hakha Chin - Mandarin/Chinese - Spanish The patient, and/or their representative, such as the patients physician, family members, legal counsel, community or religious groups, social services or hospital personnel may request a FAP Application to be mailed to a patients primary mailing address free of charge.

Eligibility Determination IU Health Arnett will inform patients or guarantors of the results of their application by providing the patient or guarantor with a Financial Assistance Determination within ninety (90) days of receiving a completed Application and all requested documentation. If a patient or guarantor is granted less than full charity assistance and the patient or guarantor provides additional information for reconsideration, IU Health Revenue Cycle Services may amend a prior Financial Assistance Determination. If a patient or guarantor seeks to appeal the Financial Assistance Determination further, a written request must be submitted, along with the supporting documentation, to the Financial Assistance Committee for additional review/reconsideration. All decisions of the Financial Assistance Committee are final. A patients Financial Assistance Application and eligibility determination are specific to each individual date(s) of service and related encounters. 3. Extraordinary Collection Actions IU Health Arnett may refer delinquent patient accounts to a third-party collection agency after utilizing reasonable efforts to determine a patients eligibility for assistance under the FAP. IU Health and its third-party collection agencies may initiate ECA against a patient or their guarantor in accordance with this Policy and 26 C.F.R. 1.501(r). Said ECA may include the following: - Selling a patients or their guarantors outstanding financial responsibility to a third party. - Reporting adverse information about the patient or their guarantor to consumer credit reporting agencies or credit bureaus. - Deferring or denying, or requiring a payment before providing, medically necessary care because of a patients or their guarantors nonpayment of one or more bills for previously provided care covered under the FAP. - Actions requiring a legal or judicial process, including but not limited to placing a lien on patients or their guarantors property, foreclosing on a patients or their guarantors real property attaching or seizing a patients or their guarantors bank account or other personal property, commencing a civil action against a patient or their guarantor, causing a patient or guarantors arrest, causing a patient and/or guarantor to be subject to a writ of body attachment, and garnishing a patient or guarantors wages. When it is necessary to engage in such action, IU Health Arnett and its third party collection agencies, will engage in fair, respectful and transparent collections activities. Patients or guarantors currently subject to an ECA who have not previously applied for Financial Assistance may apply for assistance up to two-hundred and forty (240) days of the date of their first billing statement from IU Health. IU Health and their third-party collection agencies will suspend any ECA engaged on a patient or their guarantor while an Application is being processed and considered. 4. Refunds Patients eligible for assistance under the FAP who remitted payment to IU Health Arnett in excess of their patient responsibility will be alerted to the overpayment as promptly after discovery as is reasonable given the nature of the overpayment. Patients with an outstanding account balance on a separate account not eligible for assistance under the FAP will have their refund applied to the outstanding balance. Patients without an outstanding account balance described above will be issued a refund check for their overpayment as soon as technically feasible."

Other hospitals in the IU Health Statewide System include the following: - IU Health Arnett Hospital - IU Health Ball Memorial Hospital - IU Health Bedford Hospital - IU Health Blackford Hospital - IU Health Bloomington Hospital - IU Health Goshen Hospital - IUHLP Liquidation, Inc. f/k/a IU Health La Porte Hospital - IU Health North Hospital - IU Health Paoli Hospital - IUHLP-SH, LLC f/k/a IU Health Starke Hospital - IU Health Tipton Hospital - IU Health West Hospital - IU Health White Memorial Hospital Although each hospital in the IU Health Statewide System prepares and submits its own community benefits plan relative to the local community, the IU Health Statewide System considers its community benefit plan as part of an overall vision for strengthening Indianas overall health. A comprehensive community outreach strategy and community benefit plan is in place that encompasses the academic medical center downtown Indianapolis, suburban Indianapolis and statewide entities around priority areas that focus on health improvement efforts statewide. IU Health is keenly aware of the positive impact it can have on the communities of need in the state of Indiana by focusing on the most pressing needs in a systematic and strategic way. Some ways we address our community health priorities as a system include: IU Health Day of Service The annual IU Health Day of Service is a high-impact event aimed at engaging IU Health team members in activities that address an identified community priority. Each year, more than 20,000 IU Health team member volunteer during the Day of Service. Community Health Initiatives With investments in high-quality and impactful initiatives to address community health needs statewide; IU Health is helping Indiana residents improve their health and their quality of life. In 2016, IU Health impacted many people statewide through presentations, health risk screenings, health education programs, and additional health educational opportunities made available to the community, especially to our community members in the greatest need of such services. Examples of the types of programming and investment we make in community outreach areas include: Access to Healthcare IU Health is committed to providing quality and complete healthcare for Hoosiers. Access to healthcare was a leading community health need identified in all communities served by IU Health across the state. IU Health is focusing on the needs of the underserved to create initiatives and support efforts that: - Educate community members to understand and navigate the healthcare system - Increase the availability of low-cost services and provide financial assistance. IU Health provides free or reduced-cost care and supports a number of clinics to provide free or reduced-cost care to individuals without access to insurance or the ability to pull the full cost of their healthcare. These clinics include: - IU Student Outreach Clinic - Hope Healthcare Services - Gennesaret Free Clinics - Trinity Free Clinic Healthy Weight & Nutrition Like most of the nation, Hoosiers see the alarming rise of obesity in their communities as a leading concern. Nationally, Indiana has the 15th highest adult obesity rate in the nation (The State of Obesity: Better Policies for a Healthier America, 2016). Obesity prevention was a critical community health need identified in IU Health communities across the state. IU Health is committed to launching innovative efforts aimed at preventing and reversing obesity in our communities to help community members get active, get health and get strong. IU Health is working to create initiatives and support efforts to: - Improve access to healthy foods - Create healthier school environments - Increase access to safe places for community members to be physically active IU Health initiatives aimed at preventing and reversing obesity in our communities include: - Strong Schools - Change the Play - My Healthy Habits App - Youth Diabetes Prevention Clinic Healthy Food Access Grant The Healthy Food Access Grant is an extension of the work started in 2011 with the Garden on the Go program to address obesity in the Indianapolis community. According to the USDA, between 25 and 30 million (9%) Americans are currently living in communities that do not provide adequate access to healthy food within a mile of their home. In Indianapolis, it is estimated that over 300,000 (36%) residents live in food deserts and have limited access to healthy and affordable food options. Indianapolis is reported as having the highest incidence of food deserts in the country (USDA, 2014). The lack of consumption and lack of access to healthy affordable food, particularly fresh produce, contributes to a poor diet and often can lead to higher rates of obesity and other diet-related diseases, such as diabetes and heart disease. Approximately 31% of Marion County residents are considered obese, up nearly 7% from 2010. When controlling for obesity, weight-related health problems, and health of environment, the Indianapolis area ranks among the worst metropolitan areas in the United States in terms of health. In sum, obesity is on the rise while increasingly more Indianapolis residents have less access to healthy and affordable food, which can contribute to lower consumption rates of fresh fruits and vegetables and higher rates of diet-related diseases.

201703199349301790,263162145,"Schedule H, Part VI - Other","Disclosure in Accordance with Revenue Procedure 2015-21: In accordance with Revenue Procedure 2015-21, IU Health Arnett discloses the following information with respect to Section 501(r) issues that were discovered during the 2016 tax year and how they have been corrected, to satisfy Section 501(r)(1) and 501(r)(2)(B) requirements. For all items: The cause was a good-faith effort by IU Health Arnett to implement the requirements of the Section 501(r) regulations. IU Health Arnett obtained information about the requirements and implemented them, though there were some gaps due to the detailed nature of the regulations. The issues were discovered in December 2016 when IU Health Arnett's System FAP, as applicable to IU Health Arnett, was reviewed by the IRS as part of a courtesy review in conjunction with an audit of a tax-exempt organization related to IU Health Arnett. The corrections were completed, in conjunction with the IRS courtesy review, in January 2017. The IRS confirmed in January 2017 that it believed IU Health Arnett's System FAP, effective January 2017, was in compliance with Section 501(r) and the Final Regulations. IU Health Arnett has not identified any persons directly affected by these issues because the discrepancies related primarily to the specificity of information contained in the FAP. All individuals would have been in the same position. Specific Issues and Corrections: 1. Requirement: Inclusion of a Provider List Pursuant to Treas. Reg. 1.501(r)-4(b)(1)(iii)(F), a hospital facility's FAP is required to include a list of providers, other than the hospital facility itself, who are delivering emergency or other medically necessary care in the hospital facility and to be specific about which providers are covered by the hospital facility's FAP (and which are not). Pursuant to 5 of Notice 2015-46, a hospital facility's provider list is required to be updated ""at least quarterly"" in order for a hospital organization to be considered as having taken reasonable steps to ensure that its list is accurate. Condition: V.B.4.a of IU Health Arnett's FAP, effective January 2016, stated that it ""does not cover services rendered by individual providersthat a ""full listing of providers and services not covered by this policy is available at www.iuhealth.org/financialassistance and is updated on a quarterly basis."" During 2016, the IU Health Arnett's Financial Assistance webpage contained a paragraph stating that a ""complete list of all IU Health Arnett providers not covered under IU Health Arnett's FAP is available via the Find A Doctor page or as a PDF file."" The ""Find A Doctor page"" allowed a search by first or last name of the provider. The result was a listing showing providers' pictures, specialties, and Hospitals & Affiliations. None of the information provided specifically identified whether a provider's services were or were not covered by IU Health Arnett's FAP. The PDF file, entitled ""Find A Doctor Printable Directory"", did not specifically identify whose services were covered by IU Health Arnett's FAP and whose were not. In addition, the listing was dated December 23, 2015 (almost one year old). These omissions led to the conclusion that IU Health Arnett's FAP, effective January 2016, was not compliant with Treas. Reg. 1.501(r)-4(b)(1)(iii)(F) or Notice 2015-46. Corrective Action: IU Health Arnett's Financial Assistance website at http://iuhealth.org/patients/my-iu-health/pay-a-bill/financial-assistance/ was updated in January 2017 to include the following information: ""IU Health Arnett's FAP does not cover individual physician charges. A listing of all providers who render services at an IU Health Arnett facility and whose individual professional charges are not covered by this FAP, along with a list of any services that are not covered by this FAP, are available ""herewas updated on December 31, 2016."" By clicking ""here"" on the website, an individual was able to view a PDF file listing all individual physicians providing medical services at IU Health Arnett with the specification that their services are not covered under IU Health Arnett's FAP. Furthermore, IU Health Arnett now updates the list no less frequently than quarterly. 2. Requirement: Description of Process and Time Frames Regarding FAP-eligibility and ECAs Pursuant to Treas. Reg. 1.501(r)-6(c), a hospital facility's FAP (or a separate written billing & collections policy) must describe the process and time frames that each hospital facility uses with respect to the reasonable efforts it will make to determine whether an individual is FAP eligible before engaging in any ECAs. Treas. Reg. 1.501(r)-6(c) defines two methods that will constitute reasonable efforts under paragraphs (c)(2) and (c)(3) as follows: - (c)(2): Presumptive FAP-eligibility determinations; and - (c)(3): Various, other efforts based on notification and processing of applications Condition: VI.D.1 of IU Health Arnett's FAP, effective January 2016, provided that IU Health Arnett may refer delinquent patient accounts to a third-party collection agency after utilizing ""reasonable efforts"" to determine a patient's eligibility for assistance under the FAP. VI.D.2 stated that IU Health Arnett and its third-party collection agencies may initiate ECAs against a patient in accordance with the FAP and 26 CFR 1.501(r). The problem with this wording is that IU Health Arnett did not describe the process and time frames that are involved with its ""reasonable efforts"". This omission led to the conclusion that IU Health Arnett's FAP, effective January 2016, was not compliant with IRC 501(r)(4). Corrective Action: IU Health Arnett added language to VI.D.1 and VI.D.2 of its FAP, effective January 2017, to fully describe the process and time frames that are involved with its reasonable efforts to determine a patient's eligibility for assistance under the FAP. 3. Requirement: Description of ECAs and Final Authority in Making Determinations Regarding FAP-eligibility and ECAs IRC 501(r)(4)(A)(iv) requires that a hospital facility's FAP address the actions that the organization may take in event of nonpayment. Treas. Rag 1.501(r)-(4)(b)(4)(C) requires that a hospital facility's FAP must describe the office, department, committee, or other body with the final authority or responsibility for determining that the hospital facility has made reasonable efforts to determine whether an individual is FAP-eligible and may engage in ECAs against the individual. Condition: IU Health Arnett's FAP, effective January 2016, did not contain the required wording described above. This omission led to the conclusion that IU Health Arnett FAP, effective January 2016, was not compliant with IRC 501(r)(4). Corrective Action: IU Health Arnett added language to VI.D.2 through VI.D.4 of its FAP, effective January 2017, to fully describe the actions it may take in the event of nonpayment. Furthermore, IU Health Arnett's Financial Assistance Committee is identified in IV of the FAP as the body responsible for the effectuation of the FAP including making final determinations if IU Health Arnett had made reasonable efforts to determine a patient's eligibility for assistance under the FAP. 4. Requirement: Inclusion of a Facilities List Treas. Reg. 1.501(r)-4(d)(3) states that a hospital organization may establish a FAP (and B&CP and EMCP) that is shared with multiple hospital facilities provided that any joint policy clearly identifies each facility to which it applies. Condition: In II, ""Scope,"" IU Health Arnett's FAP, effective January 2016, stated that it ""applies to all Uninsured Patients receiving care rendered at all non-profit IU Health Arnett hospital facilities, including those receiving emergent and/or medical necessary services."" This language did not clearly identify each hospital facility, by name, to which it applied. Lacking this required language resulted in the conclusion that IU Health Arnett's FAP, effective January 2016, was not compliant with IRC 501(r)(4). Corrective Action: IU Health Arnett added language to VI.B.3 of its FAP, effective January 2017, to clearly identify each hospital facility, by name, to which it applied."
