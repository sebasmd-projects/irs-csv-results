Saint Mary's College is committed to making it possible for qualified students to enroll at the college regardless of financial circumstances. As part of this commitment, Saint Mary's College offers various levels of academic scholarships, need-based scholarships and institutional grants. Academic scholarship recipients are selected at the time of admission, on the basis of their academic achievements in high school. Need-based scholarships are named for a specific donor or group, and are awarded as part of need-based institutional grant assistance, in accordance with the specific requirements of the scholarship donor. Institutional grants are awarded primarily on financial need as the College is committed to making a Saint Mary's education a possibility for students who demonstrate financial need; each student who applies for financial aid receives consideration for grant assistance. All students receiving scholarships are judged worthy by the institution's assessment on the basis of academic achievement, financial need or other similar standards. Criteria for all scholarships is published and made available to all students and their families. Grant funds/scholarships are credited directly to a student's account to ensure they are used appropriately and for their intended purpose."

Financial aid from the University and other sources is viewed only as supplementary to the efforts of the student and the student's family. Students requesting financial aid are expected to contribute toward their educational expenses through summer or university employment and/or loans in any reasonable combination. Financial aid is an important factor for many students, and 100 percent of eligible Manchester University students receive some combination of grants, scholarships, loans, and work. Student Financial Services will determine a student's eligibility for financial aid by using the results of the Free Application for Federal Student Aid (FAFSA); the estimated family contribution (EFC) and review of edit (c-codes), as well as the student's academic records and funds available. Manchester University utilizes an awarding matrix based on a combination of academic and financial need criteria referenced above. Student Financial Services administers financial aid from federal, state, and institutional resources utilizing the federal guidelines established by the U.S. Department of Education. The following steps must be taken by a student to receive a financial aid package from Manchester University: 1. Apply for admission and be admitted to Manchester University. Eligibility for academic scholarships from the University is determined through the admission process. 2. Submit a FAFSA. Eligibility for federal, state and institutional need based grants and loans is determined through this process. The student must designate the results be sent to Manchester University, and Indiana students must have a receipt date between Jan.1 and March 10 to be considered for state grant eligibility. 3. Submit any additional documentation requested by Student Financial Services. Enrollment Requirements. Students receiving financial aid must maintain full-time enrollment (a minimum of 12 semester hours) in each of the fall and spring semesters. There are circumstances in which part-time students demonstrating need may be awarded financial aid depending on the guidelines and availability of federal, state and institutional funding. Part-time students must enroll in a minimum of six hours to maintain eligibility for institutional funds and loans. Degree Requirements. Students must be working toward their first baccalaureate degree to be eligible for federal, state or institutional grants and scholarships. Students who have completed a baccalaureate degree are eligible for loans only."

ITS STUDENTS, FACULTY AND ALUMNI COMMUNITIES ARE SIMILARLY INTERNATIONAL IN CHARACTER, AND SEEK TO COLLABORATE IN AN INTERDEPENDENT WORLD TO UNDERSTAND AND SOLVE GLOBAL CHALLENGES. THE UNIVERSITY HAS REPORTED ON SCHEDULE F EXPENDITURES RELATING TO FOREIGN ACTIVITIES THAT ARE TRACKED IN THE ACCOUNTING SYSTEM, IN ACCORDANCE WITH U.S. GENERALLY ACCEPTED ACCOUNTING PRINCIPLES. 1.PROGRAM SERVICES: PROGRAM SERVICES INCLUDE ACTIVITIES RELATING TO THE CORE INSTITUTIONAL MISSION OF TEACHING, RESEARCH AND PATIENT CARE.

STANFORD ALSO OFFERS EDUCATIONAL PROGRAMS TO NON-MATRICULATED STUDENTS. -CONFERENCES AND SEMINARS: CONFERENCES AND SEMINARS INCLUDE EXPENSES INCURRED FOR LODGING, TRANSPORTATION AND MEALS FOR FACULTY AND STUDENTS TO ATTEND AND PRESENT RESEARCH FINDINGS. 2.INVESTMENTS: IN THE INTERESTS OF PRUDENT STEWARDSHIP OF ITS ENDOWMENT FUNDS, THE UNIVERSITY SEEKS TO MAINTAIN A DIVERSIFIED INVESTMENT PORTFOLIO OF ACTIVELY MANAGED FINANCIAL AND REAL ESTATE ASSETS LOCATED THROUGHOUT THE WORLD. DIVERSIFICATION AIMS TO ENSURE THAT THE ENDOWMENT GENERATES RETURNS THAT BOTH MEETS CURRENT OPERATING INCOME NEEDS AND PROVIDES FOR SUPPORT OF FUTURE STUDENTS AND PROGRAMS. THE PORTFOLIO IS CONSTRUCTED ON A FOUNDATION OF MODERN PORTFOLIO THEORY AND STRATEGIC ALLOCATION, SEEKING TO OPTIMIZE LONG-TERM RETURNS, CREATE CONSISTENT ANNUAL PAYOUTS TO THE UNIVERSITY'S OPERATING BUDGET AND PRESERVE PURCHASING POWER FOR FUTURE GENERATIONS OF STANFORD FACULTY AND STUDENTS. THE STANFORD MANAGEMENT COMPANY, A DIVISION OF THE UNIVERSITY, ACTIVELY MANAGES THE ENDOWMENT, ACCESSING MANY OF THE BEST THIRD-PARTY MANAGERS WORLDWIDE TO DEPLOY ITS CAPITAL. THE GEOGRAPHIC ALLOCATION OF THE UNIVERSITY'S INVESTMENTS, AS SHOWN IN SCHEDULE F, IS A RESULT OF THESE FACTORS. THE UNIVERSITY REPORTS IN PART I ITS REGIONAL NET BOOK VALUE OF INVESTMENT AMOUNTS, CONSISTENT WITH THE IRS 2016 INSTRUCTIONS FOR SCHEDULE F. ALSO REPORTED IN PART I ARE DIRECT COMPENSATION TO THIRD-PARTY MANAGERS. 3.GRANTMAKING: STANFORD UNIVERSITY IS NOT A ""GRANT MAKER"" PER SE IN THAT ITS FUNDAMENTAL MISSION, AND PURPOSE FOR TAX-EXEMPTION, RELATES TO TEACHING, RESEARCH AND PATIENT CARE ACTIVITIES. HOWEVER, IN THE COURSE OF THESE MISSION-BASED ACTIVITIES, THE UNIVERSITY DOES MAKE PAYMENTS THAT MEET THE CRITERIA FOR 'GRANTMAKING' AS DEFINED BY THE INSTRUCTIONS TO IRS 990 SCHEDULE F. ACCORDINGLY, THESE GRANTS ARE REPORTED ON SCHEDULE F, PART I, AND ALSO REPORTED ON PARTS II AND III AS REQUIRED BY THE INSTRUCTIONS. FOR MOST US INSTITUTIONS OF HIGHER EDUCATION, PROVISION OF FINANCIAL AID TO STUDENTS IS AN IMPORTANT ACTIVITY ENABLING QUALIFIED STUDENTS TO OBTAIN A COLLEGE EDUCATION AT THE UNDERGRADUATE, GRADUATE OR POSTDOCTORAL LEVEL. STANFORD IS COMMITTED TO A ""NEED-BLIND"" ADMISSION POLICY FOR US CITIZENS AND PERMANENT RESIDENTS; IT ADMITS QUALIFIED STUDENTS WITHOUT REGARD TO THEIR ABILITY TO PAY, AND PROVIDES A COMPREHENSIVE FINANCIAL AID PROGRAM FOR ALL ADMITTED STUDENTS WHO HAVE UNIVERSITY-COMPUTED NEED, AND WHO MEET STATED FINANCIAL AID ELIGIBILITY REQUIREMENTS. FOR THE FISCAL YEAR ENDED AUGUST 31, 2016 (FY 2016), 85% OF UNDERGRADUATE AND ABOUT 82% OF GRADUATE STUDENTS RECEIVED SOME FORM OF FINANCIAL AID, WITH A TOTAL OF $413,740,512 OF FINANCIAL AID DISBURSED TO ALL STANFORD STUDENTS. APPROXIMATELY 65% OF THIS AID TOOK THE FORM OF TRANSFERS FROM INTERNAL UNIVERSITY FUNDS TO OFFSET TUITION AND OTHER UNIVERSITY CHARGES THAT WOULD OTHERWISE HAVE BEEN RECEIVED BY THE UNIVERSITY. THE BALANCE OF $144,127,218 REPRESENTS DISBURSEMENTS, PRIMARILY TO GRADUATE STUDENTS, FOR STIPENDS, FELLOWSHIPS AND OTHER STUDENT AID IN SUPPORT OF ACADEMIC EFFORT. GRANTS TO ORGANIZATIONS ARE PRIMARILY IN THE FORM OF RESEARCH SUB-AWARDS. SUB-AWARDS ARE PAYMENTS TO THIRD PARTY RECIPIENTS FOR PERFORMING A PORTION OF A STANFORD RESEARCH PROGRAM, MOST OFTEN A SPONSORED-RESEARCH PROJECT. MANY SUB-AWARDS ARE AGREEMENTS FOR CONTRACTUALLY DEFINED DELIVERABLES, USUALLY REQUIRING HIGHLY SPECIFIC EXPERTISE. AS SUCH THEY COULD BE DESCRIBED AS RESEARCH CONTRACTS. HOWEVER, CERTAIN SUB-AWARDS MIGHT ALSO BE CATEGORIZED AS GRANTS, DEPENDING ON THE NATURE OF THE ORIGINATING PRIME FUNDING SOURCE, SINCE THE TERMS AND CONDITIONS OF THE ORIGINATING FUNDING SOURCE GENERALLY FLOW THROUGH TO THE SUB-AWARD. ACCORDINGLY, GRANT-FUNDED SUB-AWARDS ARE REPORTED IN PART II. CONTRACT-FUNDED SUB-AWARDS TO FOREIGN RECIPIENTS ARE REPORTED IN PART I, LINE 3 AS PROGRAM SERVICES - RESEARCH.
