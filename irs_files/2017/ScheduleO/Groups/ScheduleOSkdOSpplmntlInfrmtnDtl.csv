THE SAINT PAUL FOUNDATION'S POLICY FOR EVALUATING OFFICER COMPENSATION IS AS FOLLOWS: CEO COMPENSATION AND BENEFITS: THE SAINT PAUL FOUNDATION UTILIZES AN OUTSIDE THIRD PARTY CONSULTANT TO CONDUCT A CUSTOM SURVEY TO PROVIDE MARKET BENCHMARKING RELATIVE TO THE FOUNDATIONS' CEO POSITION. THE COMPENSATION SURVEY IS GENERALLY CONDUCTED EVERY TWO YEARS. THE OBJECTIVE OF THE SURVEY IS TO DETERMINE THE LEVEL OF COMPENSATION THAT WOULD BE CONSIDERED COMPETITIVE FOR THE FOUNDATION'S CEO COMPARED TO TOP EXECUTIVES OF OTHER NONPROFITS WITH PARTICULAR ATTENTION TO THOSE OF SIMILAR NATURE AND ASSET SIZE. THE COMPARATOR GROUP, CURRENTLY FOURTEEN LOCAL AND NATIONAL ORGANIZATIONS, IS REVIEWED BY THE BOARD CHAIR AND EXECUTIVE COMMITTEE. THE COMPARATOR GROUP REFLECTS ORGANIZATIONS WITH SIMILAR ASSET SIZE, COMPLEXITY OF WORK AND POTENTIAL RECRUITMENT MARKET. COMPETITIVE PAY IS DETERMINED BY CALCULATING A BASE MARKET INDEX. THE CALCULATION COMPARES THE FOUNDATION'S CEO BASE ANNUAL SALARY TO THE MEDIAN BASE ANNUAL SALARIES OF THE SURVEY PARTICIPANTS. A MARKET INDEX BETWEEN 95 AND 105 IS GENERALLY CONSIDERED TO BE MATCHING MARKET INDEX. BENEFIT SURVEY DATA IS GENERALLY COLLECTED EVERY THREE TO FIVE YEARS AND FOCUSES ON BENEFITS PROVIDED EXCLUSIVELY TO THE CEO AND TOP EXECUTIVES. STAFF COMPENSATION: A COMPREHENSIVE REVIEW OF STAFF COMPENSATION USING LOCAL INDUSTRY AND NATIONAL COMMUNITY FOUNDATION SURVEY DATA IS GENERALLY CONDUCTED EVERY TWO YEARS. THE OBJECTIVE OF THE COMPREHENSIVE REVIEW IS TO DETERMINE COMPARABLE MARKET PAY FOR INDIVIDUAL POSITIONS. FROM SURVEY RESULTS, THE MEAN (AVERAGE) SALARY IS DEFINED AS THE MARKET REFERENCE POINT (MRP). MINIMUM AND MAXIMUM PAY FOR EACH POSITION IS SET AT -/+ 20% OF MRP, AND PAY IS CONSIDERED COMPETITIVE WHEN IT IS WITHIN 10% OF A POSITION'S MRP. IF A POSITION IS UNIQUE TO THE FOUNDATIONS, THE MRP WILL BE BASED ON COMPARISON TO SIMILAR INTERNAL BENCHMARKED POSITIONS."

OTHER PROGRAM SERVICES 5: OTHER PROGRAM SERVICES 6: 3) Expanding Access to Immigrant Financial Access The national Appleseed network has a long history of advocacy on remittances, or money sent by immigrants to family and friends back home. Appleseed began an inquiry 10 years ago into disparities and fluctuations in remittance pricing - finding that intermediaries sometimes charged more than 10% of the remittance in processing fees - and the impact on immigrants. Scrutiny into these fees over the years both within the U.S. and globally helped prompt the U.S. Consumer Financial Protection Bureau (CFPB) to issue a federal rulemaking in late 2013 to minimize excesses, prevent gouging with remittance fees and provide consumers with better protections.The Ford Foundation engaged the Appleseed network in 2015 to undertake a multi-state survey project to evaluate implementation of the CFPBs rule. Given the immigrant financial issues documented in Connecticut Appleseeds 2009 survey, CT Appleseed has joined to collaborate with sister Appleseed centers in Nebraska, Texas, Kansas and Washington State.Connecticut Appleseed received additional financial support from a private foundation, which has supported the Centers work since 2008. The Center engaged in-state community partners serving immigrant populations in Stamford, Wallingford and New Haven.The Appleseed networks final report on the CFPBs 2013 remittance rule implementation, based on surveys and focus groups conducted by the five participating Appleseed Centers, was released in May, 2016. Pro bono services estimated at 96 hours, valued at $7,960. OTHER PROGRAM SERVICES 7: Pro-bono program services, excluded from Form 990 expenses. The same amount is subtracted below, $74,180.

WE FOCUS OUR EFFORTS ON THREE INCURABLE DISEASES AFFECTING MIND AND SIGHT: ALZHEIMER'S DISEASE, MACULAR DEGENERATION, AND GLAUCOMA. COLLECTIVELY, 1 IN 16 PEOPLE OVER THE AGE OF 40 IN THE U.S. ALONE HAS ONE OF THESE DISEASES. BRIGHTFOCUS HAS A PROVEN TRACK RECORD OF SUPPORTING THE MOST INNOVATIVE, EARLY-STAGE RESEARCH SEEKING BETTER UNDERSTANDING, TREATMENTS, OR, ULTIMATELY, A CURE FOR THESE DISEASES. SINCE 1973, BRIGHTFOCUS HAS AWARDED MORE THAN $150 MILLION IN RESEARCH GRANTS TO THOUSANDS OF SCIENTISTS AROUND THE WORLD. OUR RESEARCH FUNDING HAS LED TO MAJOR CONTRIBUTIONS TO THE UNDERSTANDING OF THESE DISEASES AND TO THE AWARDING OF TWO NOBEL PRIZES. BRIGHTFOCUS-SUPPORTED FINDINGS ARE CONSISTENTLY CITED BY OTHER SCIENTISTS AT TWICE THE FREQUENCY AS OTHER RESEARCH FINDINGS. OUR FUNDING ACTS AS A CATALYST IN EARLY-STAGE RESEARCH. THE BRIGHTFOCUS RESEARCH PROGRAMS ARE DESIGNED TO PROVIDE INITIAL FUNDING FOR HIGHLY INNOVATIVE EXPERIMENTAL IDEAS. DUE TO THE STRUCTURED GRANT REVIEW AND APPROVAL PROCESS, THE RESEARCH IMPACT OF BRIGHTFOCUS IS VERY HIGH. MOST RECIPIENTS OF BRIGHTFOCUS FUNDING GO ON TO RECEIVE FUTURE GRANTS FROM OTHER SOURCES THAT ARE 10 TIMES LARGER THAN THE ORIGINAL BRIGHTFOCUS AWARD. THIS ONE THOUSAND PERCENT RETURN ON BRIGHTFOCUS INVESTMENT SPEAKS TO OUR ABILITY TO IDENTIFY PROMISING RESEARCH IN ITS EARLIEST STAGES AND SPAWN FUTURE SCIENTIFIC DISCOVERIES. IT IS OUR FIRM BELIEF THAT HAVING THE COURAGE TO INVEST IN INNOVATIVE IDEAS WILL LEAD TO REVOLUTIONARY APPROACHES AND LIFE-SAVING BREAKTHROUGHS. INDISPUTABLY, THE WORLD-CLASS RESEARCH IDENTIFIED AND SUPPORTED BY BRIGHTFOCUS IS MORE THAN PROMISING: IT IS MAKING A REAL CONTRIBUTION TO REVOLUTIONARY SCIENCE IN THE FIGHT TO SAVE MIND AND SIGHT. ALONG WITH FUNDING CUTTING-EDGE RESEARCH TO FIND CURES TO SOME OF SOCIETY'S COSTLIEST DISEASES, BRIGHTFOCUS ALSO PROVIDES FREE EDUCATIONAL MATERIALS AND SUPPORT TO HUNDREDS OF THOUSANDS OF PATIENTS AND FAMILIES AFFECTED BY THESE DISEASES NATIONWIDE. WE BASE THESE EDUCATIONAL MATERIALS OFF OF THE LATEST RESEARCH FINDINGS. BRIGHTFOCUS INCREASES PUBLIC AWARENESS OF ALZHEIMER'S, MACULAR DEGENERATION, AND GLAUCOMA, AND COMMUNICATES WITH THOUGHT LEADERS AND ELECTED OFFICIALS ABOUT THE IMPORTANCE OF SCIENTIFIC RESEARCH IN THESE AREAS. BRIGHTFOCUS' AWARD-WINNING PUBLIC SERVICE ANNOUNCEMENTS (PSA) HAVE APPEARED ON TELEVISION, RADIO, AND IN PRINT THROUGHOUT THE NATION. BOTH MAKE A PLAN TODAY: GET YOUR EYES CHECKED AND NOW IS THE MOMENT TO STOP ALZHEIMER'S DISEASE POWERFULLY SEEK TO RAISE AWARENESS AND EARLY DETECTION. SIMILAR MESSAGES HAVE BEEN DELIVERED THROUGH DONATED PRINT PSA SPACE IN AIRPORTS AND TRAIN STATIONS, AS WELL AS AT PHARMACIES AND SUPERMARKETS. IN FISCAL YEAR 2016, THESE PSA MESSAGES GENERATED $13,318,687 IN DONATED MEDIA SERVICES AND GARNERED 1.3 BILLION IMPRESSIONS. STARTING IN FEBRUARY 2014, WE LAUNCHED BRIGHTFOCUS CHATS, A FREE, INTERACTIVE MONTHLY TELEPHONE FORUM THAT BRINGS TOGETHER PATIENTS AND CAREGIVERS TO LEARN FROM, AND ASK QUESTIONS OF, LEADING RESEARCHERS AND SPECIALISTS ON VISION DISEASES. THE CHATS ARE ARCHIVED ON OUR WEB SITE, WITH AUDIO AND PRINT TRANSCRIPTS AVAILABLE IN A NUMBER OF ACCESSIBLE FORMATS. WE CONTINUE TO INCREASE OUR PRINT PUBLICATIONS, MANY IN SPANISH, THAT PROVIDE HELPFUL INFORMATION TO PATIENTS AND CAREGIVERS, AND REGULARLY UNVEIL NEW VIDEO AND AUDIO RESOURCES IN CONJUNCTION WITH ALLIES IN THE MEDICAL AND SCIENTIFIC COMMUNITIES. WE HAVE EXPANDED OUR WRITTEN CONTENT OF KEY RESEARCH FINDINGS, PROMOTING AND SHARING THIS INFORMATION THROUGH OUR WEB SITE AND SOCIAL MEDIA PLATFORMS. CAPITALIZING ON EMERGING USE OF DATA VISUALIZATION, OUR BRIGHTFOCUS ""SNAPSHOT"" SERIES GRAPHICALLY COMMUNICATES INFORMATION ON ALZHEIMER'S, MACULAR DEGENERATION, AND GLAUCOMA. THROUGH OUR SOCIAL MEDIA AND WEB RESOURCES, WE CONDUCT CONTESTS AND PROMOTIONS TO INCREASE AWARENESS OF THESE DISEASES AND FURTHER SHARE BRIGHTFOCUS PUBLICATIONS AND EVENTS. A SPECIFIC EXAMPLE IS OUR HEALTHY RECIPE CONTEST, WHICH DRAWS ATTENTION TO THE IMPORTANCE OF PREVENTIVE LIFESTYLE CHOICES. MORE SPECIFICALLY, EACH OF THESE PROGRAM AREAS MAIL AWARENESS-RAISING MATERIALS TO HUNDREDS OF THOUSANDS OF HOUSEHOLDS, WITH MESSAGES FOCUSING ON: RISK FACTORS AND SYMPTOM RECOGNITION THROUGH PUBLIC AWARENESS AND STEPS THE PUBLIC SHOULD TAKE THAT MAY HELP REDUCE THEIR RISK. LIFESTYLE CHOICES THAT PROMOTE GOOD HEALTH, ENCOURAGING READERS TO TAKE ACTION TO REDUCE THE LIKELIHOOD OF THE ONSET OF THE DISEASE. RESEARCH RESULTS AND TREATMENTS AVAILABLE TO ADDRESS THE DISEASE. BRIGHTFOCUS REGULARLY INTERACTS WITH MEMBERS OF THE MEDIA, AS WELL AS ELECTED OFFICIALS AND FEDERAL AGENCY STAFF. TWICE IN THE PAST YEAR WE HAVE BEEN INVITED PRESENTERS AT U.S. CAPITOL BRIEFINGS FOR CONGRESSIONAL STAFF. THROUGH OUR OWN OUTREACH EFFORTS, AS WELL AS ACTIVE ROLES IN ADVOCACY COALITIONS, WE HELP ADVANCE THE CAUSE OF PIONEERING SCIENCE AND BETTER POSITION BRIGHTFOCUS AS A RESOURCE FOR THOSE STRUGGLING WITH, AND SEARCHING FOR CURES FOR, THESE TERRIBLE DISEASES."

INVESTIGATOR'S SUMMARY: THE RENIN-ANGIOTENSIN SYSTEM (RAS) IS A BIOCHEMICAL PATHWAY PRIMARILY INVOLVED IN BLOOD PRESSURE REGULATION, BUT WHICH BECOMES OVERACTIVE IN ALZHEIMER'S DISEASE (AD). PREVIOUS RESEARCH HAS SHOWN THAT SOME COMMONLY PRESCRIBED ANTI-HYPERTENSIVE DRUGS THAT ALSO WORK IN THE RAS SYSTEM CAN PROTECT AGAINST RATES OF ALZHEIMER'S IN PEOPLE, AND ALSO AGAINST CELL AND BRAIN TISSUE DAMAGE, AS WELL AS COGNITIVE DECLINE, IN ANIMAL MODELS OF AD. WE HAVE JUST FOUND THAT AN IMPORTANT REGULATORY ARM OF RAS IS ALSO DEFECTIVE IN AD AND THAT REDUCED ACTIVITY OF THIS PATHWAY IS ASSOCIATED WITH MORE EXTENSIVE PATHOLOGY IN HUMAN BRAIN TISSUE. OUR PROPOSED STUDY WILL INVESTIGATE WHETHER ACTIVATION AND ENHANCEMENT OF THIS REGULATORY PATHWAY, USING A DRUG ALREADY AVAILABLE FOR TESTING IN PEOPLE BUT PREVIOUSLY NOT CONSIDERED IN AD, CAN PROTECT AGAINST BOTH COGNITIVE DECLINE AND TISSUE DAMAGE NORMALLY SEEN IN AN ESTABLISHED MOUSE MODEL OF AD, POTENTIALLY RESULTING IN A NEW THERAPY THAT CAN MOVE RAPIDLY TO CLINICAL TRIAL TESTING FOR AD.

INVESTIGATOR'S SUMMARY: THE INFLAMMATORY RESPONSE IS NEEDED TO TAKE CARE OF ALL THE TISSUES THAT MAKE UP OUR BODY TO KEEP US IN WORKING ORDER. HOWEVER, INFLAMMATION IS A DOUBLE-EDGED SWORD, TOO MUCH CAN CAUSE DAMAGE TO THE SURROUNDING TISSUES, TOO LITTLE CAN BE INEFFECTIVE AT INDUCING HEALING. TO OVERCOME THIS PROBLEM, THE INFLAMMATORY RESPONSE HAS EVOLVED SO THAT ONCE A PRO-INFLAMMATORY RESPONSE IS GENERATED, IT PROMOTES THE EXPRESSION OF CHEMICALS THAT PROVIDE FEEDBACK AND SWITCH OFF INFLAMMATION BY INHIBITING THE VERY PRO-INFLAMMATORY SIGNALS THAT GENERATED THEM; IN THIS WAY, THE PROCESS OF INFLAMMATION PROGRAMS ITS OWN END. AMD HAS ELEMENTS THAT INDICATE THAT THE INFLAMMATORY RESPONSE IS UNCONTROLLED AND PERSISTENT LOW-LEVEL INFLAMMATION IS OBSERVED. OUR RESEARCH QUESTION ASKS WHETHER THIS ACTIVE PROCESS OF SWITCHING OFF THE INFLAMMATORY RESPONSE IS LOST IN PEOPLE WITH AMD.

INVESTIGATOR'S SUMMARY: UNDERSTANDING THE UNDERLYING MECHANISMS BY WHICH DEBRIS ACCUMULATES IN THE RETINA IN AGE-RELATED MACULAR DEGENERATION (AMD) IS CRITICAL FOR UNDERSTANDING DISEASE PATHWAYS AND ULTIMATELY DEVELOPING NOVEL TREATMENT TARGETS FOR EARLY AMD. AS PART OF THIS STUDY, WE WILL EVALUATE THE FUNCTION OF THESE CELLS IN A LABORATORY DISH AND COMPARE THE FUNCTION BETWEEN CELLS TAKEN FROM PEOPLE WITH AMD AND CELLS FROM PEOPLE WITHOUT AMD.

ALTHOUGH IMAGING METHODS, SUCH AS MAGNETIC RESONANCE IMAGING (MRI), HAVE SHOWN PROMISE AT MEASURING CHANGES IN BRAIN STRUCTURE ASSOCIATED WITH COGNITIVE IMPAIRMENT AND DEMENTIA, THESE APPROACHES ARE RELATIVELY INSENSITIVE TO THE EARLIEST DISEASE STAGES, WHEN TREATMENTS WILL LIKELY BE MOST EFFECTIVE. A NEW BRAIN IMAGING TECHNIQUE, RESTRICTION SPECTRUM IMAGING (RSI), HAS SHOWN PROMISE AT REVEALING SMALLER-SCALE FEATURES OF BRAIN STRUCTURE THAN STANDARD TECHNIQUES.

INVESTIGATOR'S SUMMARY: ALZHEIMER'S DISEASE (AD) IS A NEURODEGENERATIVE DISEASE AND THE MOST COMMON CAUSE OF DEMENTIA. WITH NO KNOWN CURES OR DISEASE-MODIFYING THERAPIES, THERE IS A PRESSING NEED TO FIND BIOMARKERS THAT CAN ACCURATELY ASSESS AND PREDICT DISEASE PROGRESSION IN ASYMPTOMATIC PATIENTS. HOWEVER, DESPITE RECENT EFFORTS AND SIGNIFICANT PROGRESS IN RESEARCH, FINDING SUCH A BIOMARKER REMAINS A MAJOR CHALLENGE. GIVEN THAT AD IS HYPOTHESIZED TO LEAD TO CHANGES IN NEURONAL FUNCTION LONG BEFORE DETECTABLE BEHAVIORAL IMPAIRMENTS AND/OR BRAIN STRUCTURE CHANGES, FUNCTIONAL MAGNETIC RESONANCE IMAGING (FMRI), WITH ITS ABILITY TO IMAGE BRAIN FUNCTION, HAS THE POTENTIAL TO BE A CRITICAL TOOL IN THE EARLY DETECTION OF AD AND A NON-INVASIVE TECHNIQUE THAT CAN BE USED IN THE EVALUATION OF TREATMENTS. HERE WE PROPOSE THAT A NOVEL INTRA-REGIONAL FMRI TECHNIQUE THAT WE RECENTLY DEVELOPED HAS THE POTENTIAL TO DETECT AND QUANTIFY SUBTLE NEURONAL DYSFUNCTION WITHIN BRAIN AREAS OF CLINICAL INTEREST (I.E., THE HIPPOCAMPUS) AT EARLY STAGES OF DISEASE. HOWEVER, THIS TECHNIQUE FOCUSES ON DETECTING CHANGES WITHIN REGIONS OF GRAY MATTER, WHICH MAINLY CONSIST OF NEURONAL CELL BODIES AND BRANCHING DENDRITES, THUS SOME ASPECTS OF EARLY AD PATHOLOGICAL CHANGES MIGHT BE DIFFICULT TO ASSESS WITH THIS NOVEL INTRA-REGIONAL FMRI TECHNIQUE, INCLUDING DISRUPTED FUNCTIONAL CONNECTIVITY BETWEEN BRAIN REGIONS AND IMPAIRED INTEGRITY WITHIN WHITE MATTER, WHICH MAINLY RELATES TO NERVE FIBERS. THEREFORE, INTEGRATING THIS NOVEL FMRI TECHNIQUE WITH OTHER MRI MODALITIES IS EXPECTED TO LEAD TO AN INCREASE IN SENSITIVITY AND ACCURACY IN ASSESSING AD PROGRESSION. TO TEST THIS HYPOTHESIS, WE PROPOSE TO CONDUCT A CROSS-SECTIONAL STUDY USING A COMBINATION OF THIS NOVEL FMRI TECHNIQUE WITH OTHER MRI TECHNIQUES, WITH AN ULTIMATE GOAL OF DEVELOPING AND VALIDATING A MULTIMODAL MRI BIOMARKER OF ASYMPTOMATIC AD THAT IS HIGHLY SENSITIVE TO EARLY AD PATHOLOGICAL CHANGES AND CAN ACCURATELY DETECT AND ASSESS AD PROGRESSION. FOR THIS PURPOSE, WE WILL ENROLL INDIVIDUALS WITH AMNESTIC MILD COGNITIVE IMPAIRMENT (AMCI), COGNITIVELY NORMAL (CN) INDIVIDUALS WITH GENETIC (APOE-4) AND FAMILY HISTORY RISK, AND CN INDIVIDUALS WITHOUT EITHER RISK FACTOR. THE RELATIONSHIP BETWEEN AD PROGRESSION AND MRI DATA OF EACH INDIVIDUAL MRI MODALITY WILL BE EXAMINED SEPARATELY (AIM 1). THEN WE WILL DEVELOP AND EVALUATE MULTIMODAL MRI BIOMARKERS OF AD USING POWERFUL MACHINE LEARNING ALGORITHMS ON MULTIMODAL MRI DATA TO ASSESS CURRENT DISEASE STATUS (AIM 2).

INVESTIGATOR'S SUMMARY: ALZHEIMER'S DISEASE (AD) SLOWLY PROGRESSES AS MORE AND MORE SYNAPSES IN THE BRAIN ARE DESTROYED. THIS FIRST CAUSES A GRADUAL DECLINE IN MEMORIES AND EVENTUALLY INEVITABLY LEADS TO DEMENTIA AND DEATH. EPHB RECEPTORS ARE IMPORTANT PROTEINS FOR SYNAPSE FUNCTION AND HEALTH, AS THEY HOLD HANDS WITH THE NMDA RECEPTOR PROTEIN TO HELP OUR BRAINS STORE MEMORIES. EPHB ALSO HAS THE UNFORTUNATE ABILITY TO HOLD HANDS WITH PLAQUE-FORMING AMYLOID-BETA (A-BETA) PEPTIDES MADE TO EVER INCREASING LEVELS IN ALZHEIMER'S DISEASE, AND THIS RISE IN A-BETA TARGETS EPHB FOR DEGRADATION, RESULTING IN A REDUCTION IN SYNAPSES AND MEMORIES.

INVESTIGATOR'S SUMMARY: A ROBUST FEATURE OF ALZHEIMER'S DISEASE (AD) BRAIN PATHOLOGY IS THE ACCUMULATION OF LYSOSOMES (DIGESTIVE ORGANELLES OF CELLS) IN SWOLLEN NEURONAL AXONS THAT SURROUND AMYLOID PLAQUES. HOW THESE LYSOSOMES COME TO ACCUMULATE AND WHAT THEIR ROLE IS IN AD HAS NOT BEEN ESTABLISHED. WHILE A MAJOR FUNCTION OF LYSOSOMES IS TO DEGRADE PROTEINS, OUR RECENT WORK INVESTIGATING THESE PLAQUE-ASSOCIATED LYSOSOMES DEMONSTRATED THAT THEY LACK THE ENZYMES REQUIRED FOR EFFICIENT PROTEIN DEGRADATION. THIS SUGGESTS A MODEL WHEREIN AMYLOID PLAQUES CAUSE A BLOCKADE IN THE TRANSPORT AND MATURATION OF LYSOSOMES IN SURROUNDING NEURONAL AXONS. THESE IMMATURE LYSOSOMES APPEAR TO CONTAIN THE MACHINERY REQUIRED TO MAKE MORE OF THE AMYLOID BETA PEPTIDE THAT IS THE MAJOR COMPONENT OF AMYLOID PLAQUES. THUS, THE INTERACTIONS BETWEEN AMYLOID PLAQUES AND NEURONAL AXONS ARE PREDICTED TO RESULT IN A VICIOUS CYCLE THAT CONTRIBUTES TO FURTHER DISEASE PATHOLOGY.

INVESTIGATOR'S SUMMARY: NORMAL PRESSURE INSIDE OF THE EYE IS MAINTAINED THROUGH A DYNAMIC BALANCE BETWEEN AQUEOUS HUMOR PRODUCTION AND DRAINAGE, AND HIGHER EYE PRESSURE IS COMMONLY ASSOCIATED WITH PRIMARY OPEN-ANGLE GLAUCOMA (POAG), A DISEASE THAT IS A LEADING CAUSE OF BLINDNESS WORLDWIDE. FOR AQUEOUS HUMOR TO DRAIN OUT OF THE EYE, IT NEEDS TO EXIT THROUGH A TUBE, SCHLEMM'S CANAL (SC), AND TWO UNIQUE STRUCTURES CAN BE FOUND IN THE CELLS THAT LINE THE WALL OF SC: GIANT VACUOLES, WHICH ARE PRESSURE-DEPENDENT OUTPOUCHINGS, AND PORES, WHICH ARE OPENINGS. PREVIOUS STUDIES HAVE SHOWN THAT A REDUCTION IN THE DENSITY OF BOTH GIANT VACUOLES AND PORES OCCURS IN THE EYES WITH POAG, INDICATING THAT THIS REDUCTION CAN POTENTIALLY CONTRIBUTE TO THE ELEVATED OUTFLOW RESISTANCE CHARACTERISTIC OF THIS DISEASE. WE PROPOSE TO STUDY TWO TYPES OF CELLULAR INTERACTIONS IN THE CELLS THAT LINE SC USING A NEWLY DEVELOPED, ADVANCED 3D ELECTRON MICROSCOPY TECHNOLOGY.

ABOVE A CERTAIN THRESHOLD, OR AFTER EXPOSURE TO LIGHT, LBS BECOME TOXIC AND MAY INDUCE CELL DEATH. MANY GROUPS HAVE PREVIOUSLY IDENTIFIED MECHANISMS BY WHICH LBS DAMAGE THE RPE. THESE STUDIES, HOWEVER, DID NOT PROVIDE US WITH A METHOD TO CLEAR LBS OR ALLEVIATE THEIR HARMFUL EFFECTS. WORKING WITH CULTURES OF RPE CELLS AND SYNTHETIC LBS, WE FOUND A NOVEL MECHANISM BY WHICH LBS KILL RPE CELLS. THIS MECHANISM SEEMS TO BE CENTRAL TO LB TOXICITY AND IS AMENABLE TO INHIBITION WITH DRUGS, AS WE HAVE ALREADY IDENTIFIED TWO CHEMICAL COMPOUNDS THAT FULLY PREVENT RPE CELL DEATH BY LBS. INTERESTINGLY, SOME OF THESE DRUGS ARE BEING TESTED FOR THE TREATMENT OF NEURODEGENERATION IN PARKINSON'S AND ALZHEIMER'S DISEASE. IN THE CURRENT PROJECT, WE PROPOSE TO CHARACTERIZE WELL THIS NEW DAMAGING MECHANISM, PROVE THAT IT CONTRIBUTES SIGNIFICANTLY TO LB-INDUCED RETINAL DEGENERATION IN THE EYE, AND TEST IF DRUGS THAT BLOCK THIS MECHANISM CAN PREVENT BLINDNESS IN AN ANIMAL MODEL OF AMD.

INVESTIGATOR'S SUMMARY: AGING IS AN IMPORTANT RISK FACTOR FOR AGE-RELATED MACULAR DEGENERATION (AMD). AGING IS ALSO ASSOCIATED WITH AN INCREASE IN TISSUE STIFFNESS. YET, WHETHER AND HOW PROGRESSIVE TISSUE STIFFENING CONTRIBUTES TO THE WORSENING OF THIS DEBILITATING AND DEGENERATIVE EYE DISEASE REMAINS UNKNOWN. THE AIM OF THIS PROPOSAL IS TO ADDRESS THIS GAP IN KNOWLEDGE BY USING AN INNOVATIVE AND INTERDISCIPLINARY APPROACH, SO THAT NEW AND POTENTIALLY SUPERIOR TREATMENTS CAN BE DEVELOPED TO TREAT THIS CONDITION IN THE FUTURE.

(H) PURPOSE OF GRANT: MACULAR DEGENERATION RESEARCH BY KIP CONNOR, PHD ENTITLED: (M2016183) LIPID REGULATORS OF CHOROIDAL NEOVASCULARIZATION. INVESTIGATOR'S SUMMARY: IN WET OR NEOVASCULAR AGE-RELATED MACULAR DEGENERATION (AMD), ABNORMAL BLOOD VESSELS GROW FROM BENEATH THE RETINA THAT ARE IMMATURE IN NATURE AND LEAK FLUID BELOW OR WITHIN THE RETINA, LEADING TO A RAPID LOSS IN EYESIGHT. EMERGING DATA IMPLICATE LIPIDS DERIVED FROM THE CYTOCHROME P450 PATHWAY ACT AS POTENT REGULATORS OF ANGIOGENESIS. THUS, IT IS OF GREAT CLINICAL INTEREST TO ELUCIDATE THE MECHANISMS BY WHICH THESE LIPID MEDIATORS FACILITATE DISEASE DEVELOPMENT AND/OR REGRESSION. OUR PROPOSAL HAS CLEAR POTENTIAL TO LEAD TO NEW THERAPEUTIC MOLECULES, TARGETS, AND STRATEGIES FOR SPECIFICALLY INHIBITING NEOVASCULAR AMD, A LEADING CAUSE OF BLINDNESS IN THE ELDERLY WHICH, IF LEFT UNTREATED, RAPIDLY LEADS TO SUBSTANTIAL VISION LOSS.

(H) PURPOSE OF GRANT: MACULAR DEGENERATION RESEARCH BY BIJU THOMAS, PHD ENTITLED: (M2016186) STUDIES ON FUNCTIONALITY OF IPS-RPE TRANSPLANTED IN IMMUNODEFICIENT RCS RATS. INVESTIGATOR'S SUMMARY: DYSFUNCTION AND DEATH OF RETINAL PIGMENT DPITHELIUM (RPE) HAS BEEN OBSERVED IN VARIOUS HUMAN RETINAL DEGENERATIVE DISEASES THAT LEAD TO BLINDNESS, SUCH AS AMD. WE PROPOSE TO TREAT SUCH DISEASES BY TRANSPLANTING A POLARIZED MONOLAYER OF RPE SHEETS DERIVED FROM HUMAN INDUCED PLURIPOTENT STEM CELLS (IPS). TO MINIMIZE THE IMMUNOLOGICAL REACTIONS, A NEWLY DEVELOPED RAT MODEL OF RETINAL DEGENERATION THAT DOES NOT REJECT HUMAN CELLS WILL BE USED FOR TESTING. IN DEPTH ANALYSIS OF THE FUNCTIONALITY OF TRANSPLANTED RPE WILL BE CONDUCTED TO ESTABLISH THAT IPS-RPE MONOLAYER TRANSPLANTATION IS A SUITABLE APPROACH TO TREAT VARIOUS DEGENERATIVE DISEASES AFFECTING THE EYE.

(H) PURPOSE OF GRANT: MACULAR DEGENERATION RESEARCH BY MALIA EDWARDS, PHD ENTITLED: (M2016198) RETINAL GLIAL CHANGES IN AMD. INVESTIGATOR'S SUMMARY: AGE-RELATED MACULAR DEGENERATION (AMD), THE LEADING CAUSE OF BLINDNESS IN PEOPLE OVER 60 YEARS OF AGE, IS A COMPLEX DISEASE THAT INVOLVES MANY CELLS. TWO CELLS THAT HAVE BEEN LARGELY IGNORED WITH REGARDS TO AMD ARE ASTROCYTES AND M LLER CELLS. SINCE THESE CELLS MAINTAIN A STABLE RETINAL ENVIRONMENT AND COMMUNICATE WITH MANY CELLS, DISRUPTION TO THEIR NORMAL BEHAVIOR COULD CONTRIBUTE TO THE AMD DISEASE PROCESS. THE PROPOSED RESEARCH WILL INVESTIGATE WHY ASTROCYTES EXIT THE RETINA IN AMD, POTENTIALLY IDENTIFYING NOVEL THERAPEUTIC TARGETS.

INVESTIGATOR'S SUMMARY: MALATTIA LEVENTINESE (ML) AND AGE-RELATED MACULAR DEGENERATION (AMD) ARE TWO EYE DISEASES THAT DISRUPT THE NORMAL PHYSIOLOGY OF THE RETINA, THE BACK PORTION OF THE EYE WHICH IS RESPONSIBLE FOR SENSING LIGHT. IF THESE DISEASES ARE LEFT UNCHECKED, THEY CAN INTERFERE WITH A PERSON'S VISION, AND IN SOME CASES, RESULT IN BLINDNESS. THE OVERALL GOAL OF THIS PROJECT IS TO REDUCE THE LEVELS OF A SINGLE PROTEIN WHICH IS INVOLVED IN THE PATHOGENESIS OF BOTH ML AND AMD. BY REDUCING THE LEVELS OF THIS PROTEIN, WE ANTICIPATE THAT WE WILL SIGNIFICANTLY SLOW OR HALT DISEASE PROGRESSION.

Conflict-of- interest disclosure statements are completed on an annual basis (every January) by all board members, staff, and volunteers. Any changes which occur during the year are reported through an updated statement. For board members, the disclosure statements are provided to the chair of the board, or in the case of the chair's disclosure statement is provided to the secretary of the board copies are also provided to the chief executive officer. In the case of staff or volunteers, the disclosure statements are provided to the chief executive officer or in the case of the ceo's disclosure statement is provided to the chair of the board. Whenever there is reason to believe that an actual or potential conflict of interest exists between finance fund and an interested party, the board of directors determines the appropriate organizational response. This includes invoking the procedures described in the conflict of interest policy. Where the actual or potential conflict involves an employee or volunteer of the organization other than the ceo, the ceo will review the matter and take appropriate action as necessary to protect the interests of the organization. The ceo reports to the chair of the board the results of any review and the action taken. The chair, in consultation with the executive committee, shall determine if any further board review or action is required. The secretary of the board of directors files copies of all disclosure statements with the official corporate records of the organization. Director statements are kept with board records, and staff and volunteer statements are kept in personnel files. All corporate policies including the conflict of interest policy are written and made available to all board, staff, and volunteers in an employee handbook or board handbook. All board, staff, and volunteers sign statements to affirm that they have read such polices and understand them. All corporate policies are reviewed on an annual basis by key staff. Recommendations for policy changes are brought before the board for review and approval. Policy changes are communicated to board, staff, and volunteers. The executive committee is charged with the responsibility to regularly and consistently monitor and enforce compliance with the conflict of interest policy by reviewing annual statement and taking such other actions as are necessary for effective oversight."

Reg.  53.4958-6(c)(1)(iii)); (ii) each of the Board and the Committee obtains and relies upon appropriate data as to comparability prior to making its determination regarding a compensation arrangement; and (iii) the basis for the compensation-related determination made by the Board or the Committee is adequately documented concurrently with the making of the determination. The Company's overall compensation policy is designed to promote the tax-exempt purposes of the Company by attracting, retaining and motivating highly-skilled senior management to deliver superior service in furtherance of the Company's exempt purpose: to lessen the burdens on government through the administration of an efficient and reliable electricity transmission system, wholesale electricity marketplace and comprehensive regional bulk power system planning process for the benefit of New England. For each fiscal year, the Committee develops recommendations regarding: (i) the base salary of each senior executive; (ii) the annual performance incentive plan (i.e. the short-term incentive compensation plan) goals and objectives for the plan year for the Company and each senior executive; (iii) the long-term incentive compensation plan goals and objectives for the plan year for the Company and each senior executive; and (iv) proposed changes, if any, to the Company's fringe benefit plans. At the end of each fiscal year, the Committee also makes recommendations regarding the performance of the Company and each senior executive against the plan year goals and objectives established under both the short-term incentive compensation plan and the long-term incentive compensation plan. All of the aforementioned Committee recommendations are based upon information and materials derived from a number of sources, including: evaluations of the Company's performance, requirements and short- and long-range strategic plans as prepared by the Board, Board committees and senior executives; evaluations of the performance of each senior executive's performance as prepared by the Board, the Committee and/or senior executives; salary and other compensation surveys conducted by independent human resources and compensation consulting firms; reports and findings prepared by an independent human resources and compensation consulting firm retained by the Company to evaluate the reasonableness of the compensation paid to senior executives; and written and anecdotal information collected by the Human Resources Department of the Company in connection with the recruitment and retention of senior executives for the Company (including reports provided by executive recruitment firms). The compensation-related recommendations made by the Committee are referred to the Board for its review, together with all evaluations, surveys, consultant reports and findings and other information compiled by the Committee. The Board reviews the recommendations and material provided by the Committee, and considers the recommendations in light of: the performance, financial condition, requirements, and exempt purpose goals and objectives of the Company; the performance, experience, and responsibilities of each senior executive; and the competitive market for executive talent. The recommendations also are weighed against a range of reasonable compensation established for each of the Company's executives by an independent human resources and compensation consulting firm (in 2015, Mercer), based upon independent survey sources and compensation information for functionally-comparable positions provided or made available by other regional transmission operators, independent systems operators, and other similarly situated taxable and tax-exempt organizations. Based on the foregoing, the Board makes a final decision regarding each of the elements of each senior executive's compensation, including: base salary; the current fiscal year's goals and objectives for each of the Company and the executive for each of the short-term incentive compensation plan and the long-term incentive compensation plan; changes (if any) to the Company's fringe benefit plans; the performance scores against the prior fiscal year's goals and objectives for each of the Company and the executive for each of the short-term incentive compensation plan and the long-term incentive compensation plan; and the final payments to be made in the current fiscal year under the Company's incentive compensation plans based upon those Company and individual performance scores.
