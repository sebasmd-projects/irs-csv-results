The Christian Apologetics department also offers special learning program and lectures for the public and churches, as well as a certificate program in the defense of the faith for lay people. Science and Religion: The Masters of Arts Degree in Science and Religion is designed to provide individuals with the essential background in theology, history, and philosophy necessary to integrate evangelical Christianity with modern science. The master's program relates to Christianity and the sciences are designed for Christian students who have basic training in a natural science. This program also offers advanced seminars that focus on current theological issues within specific scientific disciplines. COOK SCHOOL OF INTERCULTURAL STUDIES The primary objective of the Cook School of Intercultural Studies arises from the mandate given by the Lord Jesus Christ to make disciples of every nation based on an understanding of both human beings and culture. The CSICS strives to enable students to demonstrate knowledge and an understanding of human beings within their cultural setting. We further strive to enable students to demonstrate a knowledge and understanding of the theological, historical, sociological anthropological and linguistic issues associated with the cross-cultural communication of the gospel through a broad range of professions and vocations. It is the desire of the faculty that each student in the program will find in their particular career choice the means to effective cross-cultural personal ministry and evangelism. In the undergraduate departments students are exposed to the foundational concepts within anthropology, cross-cultural engagement, cultural diversity, cross-cultural communication, and theologizing within cultural contexts. Students work closely with their advisors to build a program according to their career objectives. They are encouraged to choose specific concentrations that provide the skills for their chosen careers, or in combination with other disciplines in the university to combine their cross-cultural skills with preparation in bicultural education, cross-cultural media communication, social work, cross-cultural counseling, international relations or international business administration. In the graduate departments students engage in a deeper level of critical analysis of theories and practices associated with global issues, the internationalization of the Christian faith, the study of cultures and culture change, and the formation of pedagogical concepts and practices appropriate to cross-cultural educational theory and practice. A unique feature of the graduate studies degrees is the use of blended delivery systems that allow students who are currently in working careers to pursue their degrees while still remaining in their careers. THE SCHOOL OF EDUCATION: The School of Education serves a diverse student body, consisting of more than 500 students: 300 undergraduate students (240 Liberal Studies majors and approximately 160 Single Subject majors) and 210 graduate students. Our full-time faculty is comprised of outstanding professionals with decades of combined experience in classroom and administrative settings. At the undergraduate level, the School of Education is home to the Liberal Studies major, which consistently ranks among the five most popular undergraduate majors at Biola. At the graduate level, the School of Education offers the Master of Arts in Teaching (M.A.T.) and Master of Arts in Education (M.A.Ed.) Programs and can be taken in person, online, or in combination and can be tailored to meet the individual interests of new and experienced teachers alike. In 2017, we will also launch two new online graduate programs: the M.S. in Special Education and the M.S. in Curriculum, Instruction, and Publication. Our state-accredited teacher preparation program offers teaching credentials (multiple subject; single subject; and education specialist, mild/moderate) at both the graduate and undergraduate levels. We also offer the Clear Credential at the graduate level and five levels of Early Childhood permits at the undergraduate and graduate level. All credential and permit programs are accredited by the California Commission on Teacher Credentialing. Crowell School of Business The Crowell School of Business prepares students academically with a foundational business education while nurturing their Christian commitment through solid biblical integration in courses and contact with faculty and staff. The mission of the Crowell School of Business is to equip students to develop a biblical worldview so as to see business as ministry: * To prepare students for excellence and leadership in their career. * To be strong in mind and character, and mature in faith so that they will make an impact for God in this time and place. * To develop a student's God-given talents and pursue excellence by maintaining high expectations and proficiency in their unique field of interest. Biola University, through its Crowell School of Business, is nationally accredited by the Association of Collegiate Business Schools and Programs to offer a Bachelor of Science in Business Administration degree with concentrations in the following: Business Analytics, International Business, Management, Marketing and Marketing-Management. In 2015, the Crowell School of Business introduced a Bachelor of Business Administration in accounting degree. Each program is structured to give the student broad understanding of the social and economic environment in which Christian business persons function, and provides a common body of knowledge for students who elect this major. Students study economics, finance, management, business law, accounting, and marketing as the core of the major based upon quantitative management skills. The five individual concentrations prepare students through additional specified courses to enter a career field in those areas, or to select a graduate school upon graduation. It is the purpose of the Crowell School of Business to prepare highly skilled, technically competent business persons who have broad preparation in the liberal arts as well, and who can make significant contributions in the workplace or in Christian organizations they may serve. The mission of the Biola MBA Program is to provide advanced business study, integrating biblically based teaching to train and equip business professionals and developing faith, character, and an entrepreneurial spirit to produce Christ-centered men and women to impact their workplace. Building from that heritage, the Biola MBA is a rigorous and broadly based advanced business study. Its hallmark is a passion for creativity, vision, innovative problem solving, and the highest of ethical standards. You will be taught by carefully selected faculty who know first-hand the rigors of 21st century commerce. They are ready to equip and prepare you to impact and transform today's marketplace. New Flex MBA Program The Flex MBA program allows students to customize their MBA experience. An MBA student may take a part-time or a full-time academic load. Applicants have the option to choose to attend full-time if starting in the fall, or may choose to enroll part-time in a fall or spring start. The Crowell School of Business MPAcc program is a 33-unit program (for accounting undergraduates) specifically designed to meet state-established academic requirements for becoming a certified public accountant (CPA). We also offer a part-time and full -time option. We provide leveling courses for students that do not have a business or accounting back-ground. Interterm Session To facilitate the completion of graduation and also to allow exposure to creative learning and to enrich students' academic programs, the University provides an Interterm program in January. A selected array of general education, Bible, electives and graduate courses is offered. Students may enrich their course of study and reduce the overall time to completion or decrease their regular course load by careful selection of Interterm courses. Certain courses or workshops may be offered during Interterm that is not listed in the catalog. Courses may be innovative or the content may be in response to specialized needs or current topics. Opportunities to participate in travel and other non-traditional courses are also offered by various departments through the office of Cross-Cultural Engagement, which organizes Biola Study Tours."
