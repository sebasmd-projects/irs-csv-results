201632229349300443,010270690,640924,0,0,"All other projects Healthy Waters: Maine's rivers, lakes, and streams are among our state's most precious and celebrated natural resources. For the third year in a row, NRCM's public education, outreach, and citizen engagement campaign (which we began in 2012) resulted in the Maine Legislature rejecting weak mining rules written by the Maine Department of Environmental Protection (DEP). The proposed rules did not protect Maine's waterways or communities from ""acid mine drainage""- a toxic soup of sulfuric acid and heavy metals that results from this type of mining, and can devastate water quality, kill aquatic creatures, and destroy landscapes. NRCM is a founding partner of the Penobscot River Restoration Trust (PRRT). In 2015, PRRT completed construction of a state-of-the-art fish bypass at the Howland Dam on the Piscatiquis River, a major tributary to the Penobscot. Water began flowing through the bypass on September 28, 2015. This final phase of the PRRT project followed the removal of the Veazie Dam (the lowermost barrier to fish passage on the river) in 2013 and the Great Works Dam in 2012. We celebrate PRRT's visionary approach to reconnect endangered Atlantic salmon, shortnose sturgeon, American shad, alewife and seven other native sea-run fish to 1,000 miles of vital spawning habitat in the watershed, without losing an important source of indigenous power generation. The PRRT initiative will result in large-scale ecological, cultural, recreational, and economic benefits throughout the Penobscot watershed. We will continue to measure these benefits in the years to come. Forests & Wildlife: The North Woods of Maine is nationally recognized as the largest undeveloped forest east of the Mississippi River. In 2015, NRCM continued our campaign (launched in 2012) to build community, business, and citizen demand for a proposed new national park and national recreation area along the East Branch of the Penobscot River in the heart of the North Woods. We met with hundreds of opinion leaders, sportsmen, business owners, and organizations; hosted outdoor recreation events on the land; added to our list of endorsements by securing support from the Bangor City Council and the Bangor Daily News, the region's leading newspaper; and gathered over 23,850 names on a petition in support of the park proposal. Currently, NRCM is urging President Obama to use his authority under the 1906 Antiquities Act to designate the area as a new National Monument. Simultaneously, NRCM worked in coalition with other conservation groups to secure the release of $11.5 million in voter-approved conservation bond funds for the Land for Maine's Future (LMF), the state program that conserves lands of exceptional natural or recreational value. We also worked to protect Maine's forests from attempts to increase logging on public lands to unsustainable levels and reduce funding for land conservation programs. Sustainable Maine: NRCM has a long history of educating the public about the hazardous chemicals found in items common to our homes, schools, and workplaces, and has helped Maine phase out toxic chemicals in consumer products and create landmark recycling programs for products that pose a risk to our environment and public health. Now, we offer education and hands-on training to communities seeking ways to reduce waste and toxics in the environment, increase participation in recycling and organic composting, and boost the production and use of clean and efficient energy. In 2015, NRCM built on the initial success of plastic bag and foam packaging ordinances we helped Portland, Maine adopt and implement. We worked with York, Falmouth, and South Portland to adopt ordinances to put a fee on single-use plastic bags, and helped citizens in Kennebunk, Brunswick, Topsham, and Freeport launch similar campaigns. We also created our Sustainable Maine Communities Toolkits, online resources featuring topics such as reusable bags, foam packaging, cigarette litter prevention, pay-as-you-throw trash policies, pesticide bans, community solar projects, and community gardens."
