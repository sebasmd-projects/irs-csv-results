CONTRIBUTIONS ARE DESIGNED TAKING INTO CONSIDERATION LOST RETIREMENT BENEFITS THAT WOULD OTHERWISE BE OBTAINED THROUGH THE QUALIFIED PENSION PLAN. SUTTERS PLANS ARE DESIGNED CONSISTENT WITH COMPETITIVE INDUSTRY PRACTICES. THE RETIREMENT PLAN FOR SUTTER HEALTH EMPLOYEES IS A COMBINATION OF SOCIAL SECURITY, 403(B) EMPLOYER MATCH CONTRIBUTIONS AND QUALIFIED PLAN BENEFITS. SUTTER HEALTH EXECUTIVES ARE GENERALLY INELIGIBLE FOR EMPLOYER MATCH CONTRIBUTIONS. ADDITIONALLY, QUALIFIED PLAN BENEFITS CAPS HAVE THE EFFECT OF SUBSTANTIALLY REDUCING RETIREMENT BENEFITS THAT ARE OTHERWISE PROVIDED TO ALL EMPLOYEES. THE EFFECT IS THAT EXECUTIVES OFTEN DO NOT RECEIVE THE SAME LEVEL OF RETIREMENT BENEFIT ON AN INCOME REPLACEMENT BASIS AS OTHER EMPLOYEES. TO ENSURE A COMPETITIVE RETIREMENT BENEFIT AND TO ADDRESS THE SHORTFALLS DESCRIBED ABOVE, SUTTER HEALTH MAKES AN ANNUAL CONTRIBUTION TO A NON-QUALIFIED 457(F) PLAN FOR ITS EXECUTIVES. THE FORMULA HAS TWO PARTS: (1) 4% TO 7% OF BASE SALARY (COMMENSURATE WITH MANAGEMENT LEVEL), PLUS (2) A CONTRIBUTION STARTING AT 5% (BASED UPON TENURE) FOR ELIGIBLE EARNINGS BEYOND THE IRS DEFINITION OF INCLUDIBLE COMPENSATION (""PENSION PAY CAP"").

TARGET BENEFIT LEVELS ARE DISCOUNTED FOR YEARS OF SERVICE LESS THAN 22.5 AT AGE 65. UNLIKE SUTTER HEALTHS QUALIFIED PLAN WHERE EMPLOYEE BENEFITS ARE GUARANTEED (I.E., A DEFINED BENEFIT), SUTTERS NON-QUALIFIED PLAN BENEFITS ARE NOT GUARANTEED BY SUTTER HEALTH.

A PORTION OF THE PLAN AWARD IS DISCRETIONARY IN THAT THE SUPERVISOR MAY ADD UP TO 5% TO THE AWARD PROVIDED THE TOTAL AWARD (FORMULA PORTION PLUS DISCRETIONARY) DOES NOT EXCEED THE MAXIMUM ESTABLISHED FOR ANY GIVEN EXECUTIVE. LONG TERM PERFORMANCE PLANS SUTTER HEALTH ALSO EMPLOYS LONG TERM PERFORMANCE PLANS WHICH ARE DESIGNED TO FOCUS ON LONGER TERM STRATEGIC OBJECTIVES OF THE ORGANIZATION. SUTTERS LONG TERM PERFORMANCE PLAN APPROACH IS A COMBINATION OF BOTH LONGER TERM MEASURES OF ORGANIZATION SUCCESS AND KEY ORGANIZATION STRATEGIES WHICH REQUIRE THE COMBINED EFFORT OF ALL LEADERSHIP TO ACHIEVE SUCCESS. SUTTER USES A COMMON FATE APPROACH IN THAT ALL PLAN PARTICIPANTS ARE MEASURED AGAINST THE SAME, ORGANIZATION-WIDE CRITERIA VS. INDIVIDUAL EFFORTS. THIS FOSTERS A COMMON PURPOSE ACROSS LEADERSHIP AND A SHARED SENSE OF ACCOUNTABILITY FOR THE OVERALL SUCCESS OF SUTTER HEALTH. TO ENSURE THAT EXTRAORDINARY EFFORTS BY INDIVIDUALS CAN BE RECOGNIZED AND THAT ACTIONS OF LEADERSHIP ARE CONSISTENT WITH SUPPORTING SUTTER HEALTHS OVERALL MISSION, VISION, AND VALUES, SUTTERS LONG TERM INCENTIVE PLAN APPROACH ALSO INCORPORATES A COMBINATION OF CEO AND SUTTER HEALTH COMPENSATION COMMITTEE DISCRETION. IN SOME CASES, THE SUTTER HEALTH COMPENSATION COMMITTEE HAS DELEGATED AUTHORITY TO THE PRESIDENT & CEO TO MODIFY INDIVIDUAL AWARDS WITHIN LIMITS THAT HAVE BEEN PRE-APPROVED BY THE SUTTER HEALTH COMPENSATION COMMITTEE. THIS INCLUDES BOTH THE REDUCTION AND INCREASE OF AWARD AMOUNTS. SUCH MODIFICATIONS GENERALLY DO NOT EXCEED +/- 20% AND ARE EMPLOYED JUDICIOUSLY.

If he were to voluntarily separate from employment or be involuntarily terminated with cause before the end of 2014, he would forfeit this benefit. If he were to die, become disabled or be involuntarily terminated without cause, he would receive this benefit in full. The specific amount was based on extensive analysis of the ""replacement ratio"" of all of the then-current sources of employer-provided retirement, with the intent to have this lump sum achieve a replacement rate that the Committee thought was appropriate for the length of service that he would have provided through 2014.

University policy requires additional documentation in the case of first or business class airfare to document the reason of the additional expense. Charter Travel - the University charters aircrafts for the purpose of transporting University athletic teams to various intercollegiate athletic event locations. In instances where a University employee and\or their family member travels on a University chartered flight, without a University business purpose, the University follows the rules under IRS Regulation Section 1.61-21(g) to determine the taxable value, which may be zero, of the chartered travel provided to the employee and/or their family member. Housing Allowance or residence for personal use - personal use of housing is generally based on the provisions of an employee's services agreement with the University. The value of the housing provided is not taxable to the individual to the extent it is a condition of their employment. The value of housing, which is provided, but not as a condition of employment, is taxable to the individual and reported in Schedule J, Part II as other reportable compensation in column (Col B(III)). Travel for Companions - The University occasionally pays for the travel of a staff member's spouse. These instances are generally limited to situations where either the spouse's travel is considered to have a University business purpose or as part of a staff member's services agreement with the University. The University further limits spousal business travel for instances where it believes their presence is in the best interests of the University and does not tax these amounts as additional compensation. The University does tax report, as additional compensation, spousal travel provided as part of a staff member's services agreement and where there is no University business purpose for the travel. Additionally, on rare occasion a staff member's spouse may accompany a DePaul athletic team on a chartered aircraft, if excess seating is available. Please see the above Charter Travel disclosure for additional details regarding such instances. Tax Indemnification and Gross-up payments - such payments are generally provided based on the provisions of an employee's services agreement with the University and are included in column B(III) of Part II.

Compensation and benefits provided to this individual are determined pursuant to policies, procedures, and processes of AHSSHC that are designed to ensure compliance with the intermediate sanctions laws as set forth in IRC Section 4958. AHSSHC has taken steps to ensure that processes are in place to satisfy the rebuttable presumption of reasonableness standard as set forth in Treasury Regulation 53.4958-6 with respect to its active executive-level positions. The AHSSHC Board Compensation Committee (the Committee) serves as the governing body for all executive compensation matters. The Committee is composed of certain members of the Board of Directors (the Board) of AHSSHC. Voting members of the Committee include only individuals who serve on the Board as independent representatives of the community, who hold no employment positions with AHSSHC and who do not have relationships with any of the individuals whose compensation is under their review that impacts their best independent judgment as fiduciaries of AHSSHC. The Committee's role is to review and approve all components of the executive compensation plan of AHSSHC. As an independent governing body with respect to executive compensation, it should be noted that the Committee will often confer in executive sessions on matters of compensation policy and policy changes. In such executive sessions, no members of management of AHSSHC are present. The Committee is advised by an independent third party compensation advisor. This advisor prepares all the benchmark studies for the Committee. Compensation levels are benchmarked with a national peer group of other not-for-profit healthcare systems and hospitals of similar size and complexity to AHS and each of its affiliated entities. The following principles guide the establishment of individual executive compensation: - The salary of the President/CEO of AHS will not exceed the 40th percentile of comparable salaries paid by similarly situated organizations; and - Other executive salaries shall be established using market medians. The compensation philosophy, policies, and practices of AHSSHC are consistent with the organization's faith-based mission and conform to applicable laws, regulations, and business practices. As a faith-based organization sponsored by the Seventh-day Adventist Church (the Church), AHSSHC's philosophy and principles with respect to its executive compensation practices reflect the conservative approach of the Church's mission of service and were developed in counsel with the Church's leadership."

In recognition of the contribution that each executive makes to the success of AHS, AHS provides to eligible executives participation in the AHS Executive FLEX Benefit Program (the Plan). The purpose of the Plan is to offer eligible executives an opportunity to elect from among a variety of supplemental benefits, including deferred compensation benefits taxable under Internal Revenue Code (IRC) Section 457(f), to individually tailor a benefits program appropriate to each executive's needs. The Plan provides eligible participants a pre-determined benefits allowance credit that is equal to a percentage of the executive's base pay from which is deducted the cost of mandatory and elective employee benefits. The pre-determined benefits allowance credit percentage is approved by the AHSSHC Board Compensation Committee, an independent committee of the Board of Directors of AHSSHC. Any funds that remain after the cost of mandatory and elective benefits are subtracted from the annual pre-determined benefits allowance are contributed, at the employee's option, to either an IRC 457(f) deferred compensation account or to an IRC 457(b) eligible deferred compensation plan. Upon attainment of age 65, all previous 457(f) deferred amounts are paid immediately to the participant and any future employer contributions are made quarterly from the Plan directly to the participant. The Plan documents define an employee who is eligible to participate in the Plan to generally include the Chief Executive Officers of AHS entities and Vice Presidents of all AHS entities whose base salary is at least $230,000. The Plan provides for a class year vesting schedule (2 years for each class year) with respect to amounts accumulated in the executive's 457(f) deferred compensation account. Distributions could also be made from the executive's 457(f) deferred compensation account upon attainment of age 65 or upon an involuntary separation. The account is forfeited by the executive upon a voluntary separation. In addition to the Plan, AHS has instituted a defined benefit, non-tax-qualified deferred compensation plan for certain executives who have provided lengthy service to AHS and/or to other Seventh-Day Adventist Church hospitals or health care institutions. Participation in the plan is offered to AHS executives on a prorata schedule beginning with 20 years of service as an employee of AHS and/or another hospital or health care institution controlled by the Seventh-Day Adventist Church and who satisfy certain other qualifying criteria. This supplemental executive retirement plan (SERP) was designed to provide eligible executives with the economic equivalent of an annual income beginning at normal retirement age equal to 60% of the average of the participant's three, five or seven highest years of base salary from AHS active employment inclusive of income from all other Seventh-Day Adventist Church healthcare employer-financed retirement income sources and investment income earned on those contributions through social security normal retirement age as defined in the plan. The number of years included in highest average compensation is determined by the individual's year of entry to the SERP and by the individual's year of entry to the AHS Executive FLEX Benefit Program.

The procedure is designed to comply with the requirements of Section 4958 of the Internal Revenue Code and Internal Revenue Service regulations. The CORD Committee maintains a roster of disqualified persons, as defined by the IRS, for whose compensation the procedure is used. The roster is reviewed periodically but at least annually. The procedure was last discussed with the full board in March 2011. The procedure requires three elements as follows: 1) The terms of transactions are approved by the organization's governing body, or a committee thereof, whose members have no conflict of interest with respect to the arrangement. The Board of Trustees delegated authority to the CORD Committee to act on behalf of the Board in these matters at its meeting on March 25, 1999. Compensation arrangements are reviewed and approved by the CORD Committee before the effective date. Members of the CORD Committee recuse themselves from any vote in which there is a potential or actual conflict of interest. 2) The governing body or committee obtains and relies upon appropriate, comparable data before making its determination. Rice participates in the annual survey by Willis Towers Watson of select universities' executive compensation, and additional appropriate peer surveys. These reports reflect executive compensation in universities of a stature similar to that of Rice, and with which Rice competes for faculty and staff. The CORD Committee may also seek and rely on other relevant information, including compensation paid by other taxable and tax-exempt organizations for functionally comparable positions, geographic market forces, and actual written offers from similar institutions competing for services. The CORD Committee relies on this data and documents any determinations that reasonable compensation is an amount more than the range of comparable data. 3) The governing body or committee adequately documents the basis for making determinations concurrently with making decisions. Minutes documenting the deliberations of the CORD Committee are prepared contemporaneously for review and approval at its next meeting."

The university did not utilize chartered flights for air travel. Extensive travel is required of the position of president and he is encouraged by the Board of Trustees to travel business or first class on flights of two hours or more. This provision is made for several reasons: 1) business or first-class travel allows for the most flexibility to accommodate a travel schedule that must frequently be altered, often at the last minute to accommodate donors' schedules, add critical meetings, or to take advantage of other strategic opportunities for the university; 2) circumstances sometimes call for the president to return to campus without notice, or to remain on campus when a trip was planned, and first or business-class travel best accommodates these changing conditions; and 3) the Board of Trustees wishes the president to be at his best performance representing and seeking funding for the university during often grueling travel itineraries for meetings frequently critical to the institution's well-being. This accommodation was not treated as taxable compensation. HOUSING ALLOWANCE OR RESIDENCE FOR PERSONAL USE: The president is required to live on campus in the university-owned president's residence where he regularly holds university events. Because the president accepts this requirement as a condition of employment, the residence is on university premises, and it is provided for the convenience of the university, under IRS rules it is not considered a taxable benefit to the president. As required by IRS Form 990, the value of the portion of the residence used by the president for personal living quarters has been estimated and is included in the amounts reported on Form 990, Schedule J, Part II, Column (D)."

201723139349303952,942992642,"SCHEDULE J, PART I, LINE 4B","NONQUALIFIED RETIREMENT PLAN: THE PURPOSE OF THE NONQUALIFIED RETIREMENT PLAN IS TO PROVIDE SUTTER HEALTH EXECUTIVES WITH A COMPETITIVE RETIREMENT BENEFIT CONSISTENT WITH SUTTER HEALTHS OVERALL COMPENSATION PHILOSOPHY FOR ALL EMPLOYEES. CONTRIBUTIONS ARE DESIGNED TAKING INTO CONSIDERATION LOST RETIREMENT BENEFITS THAT WOULD OTHERWISE BE OBTAINED THROUGH THE QUALIFIED PENSION PLAN AND SOCIAL SECURITY BENEFITS. SUTTERS PLANS ARE DESIGNED CONSISTENT WITH COMPETITIVE INDUSTRY PRACTICES. THE RETIREMENT PLAN FOR SUTTER HEALTH EMPLOYEES IS A COMBINATION OF SOCIAL SECURITY, 403(B) EMPLOYER MATCH CONTRIBUTIONS, AND QUALIFIED PENSION PLAN BENEFITS. SUTTER HEALTH EXECUTIVES ARE GENERALLY INELIGIBLE FOR EMPLOYER MATCH CONTRIBUTIONS. ADDITIONALLY, QUALIFIED PENSION PLAN AND SOCIAL SECURITY BENEFIT CAPS HAVE THE EFFECT OF SUBSTANTIALLY REDUCING RETIREMENT BENEFITS THAT ARE OTHERWISE PROVIDED TO ALL EMPLOYEES. THE EFFECT IS THAT EXECUTIVES OFTEN DO NOT RECEIVE THE SAME LEVEL OF RETIREMENT BENEFIT ON AN INCOME REPLACEMENT BASIS AS OTHER EMPLOYEES. TO ENSURE A COMPETITIVE RETIREMENT BENEFIT AND TO ADDRESS THE SHORTFALLS DESCRIBED ABOVE, SUTTER HEALTH MAKES AN ANNUAL CONTRIBUTION TO A NON-QUALIFIED 457(F) PLAN FOR ITS EXECUTIVES. THE FORMULA HAS TWO PARTS: (1) 4% TO 7% OF BASE SALARY (COMMENSURATE WITH MANAGEMENT LEVEL), PLUS (2) A CONTRIBUTION STARTING AT 5% (BASED UPON TENURE) FOR ELIGIBLE EARNINGS BEYOND THE IRS DEFINITION OF INCLUDIBLE COMPENSATION (""PENSION PAY CAP""). THE LATTER OF WHICH IS DESIGNED TO HELP RESTORE LOST PENSION BENEFITS FORFEITED UNDER THE QUALIFIED PENSION PLAN FOR EARNINGS OVER THE PENSION PAY CAP LIMIT. CONTRIBUTIONS ARE ALSO MADE FOR A SMALL GROUP OF SENIOR LEVEL EXECUTIVES WHOSE ESTIMATED RETIREMENT BENEFIT (SOCIAL SECURITY PLUS QUALIFIED PENSION PLAN BENEFITS PLUS 457F) FALLS BELOW 50% - 65% OF FINAL 4-YEAR AVERAGE BASE SALARY WHEN RETIRING AT AGE 65 WITH 22.5 YEARS OF SERVICE. TARGET BENEFIT LEVELS ARE DISCOUNTED FOR YEARS OF SERVICE LESS THAN 22.5 AT AGE 65. UNLIKE SUTTER HEALTHS QUALIFIED PENSION PLAN WHERE EMPLOYEE BENEFITS ARE GUARANTEED (I.E., A DEFINED BENEFIT), SUTTERS NON-QUALIFIED PLAN BENEFITS ARE NOT GUARANTEED BY SUTTER HEALTH. INVESTMENT RISK IS BORNE BY PARTICIPANTS AND BENEFITS ARE NOT PROTECTED SHOULD SUTTER HEALTH BECOME INSOLVENT."
201723139349303952,942992642,"SCHEDULE J, PART I, LINE 7","NON-FIXED PAYMENTS: SPOT AWARDS ARE INFREQUENTLY USED TO REWARD EMPLOYEES. THERE ARE NO SPECIFIC GUIDELINES FOR THE AMOUNT OF THE SPOT AWARD BUT THE AMOUNT TENDS TO NOT EXCEED 5% TO 10% OF GROSS ANNUAL SALARY. ANNUAL INCENTIVE PLAN (AIP) THE PURPOSE OF THE PLAN IS TO FOCUS EXECUTIVES ON SPECIFIC, SHORTER-TERM GOALS THAT ARE CRITICAL TO THE ACHIEVEMENT OF AFFILIATE, OPERATING UNIT AND SYSTEM-WIDE OBJECTIVES THAT DRIVE OVERALL ORGANIZATION PERFORMANCE. A PORTION OF THE PLAN AWARD IS DISCRETIONARY IN THAT THE SUPERVISOR MAY ADD UP TO 5% TO THE AWARD PROVIDED THE TOTAL AWARD (FORMULA PORTION PLUS DISCRETIONARY) DOES NOT EXCEED THE MAXIMUM ESTABLISHED FOR ANY GIVEN EXECUTIVE. LONG TERM PERFORMANCE PLANS SUTTER HEALTH ALSO EMPLOYS A LONG TERM PERFORMANCE PLAN WHICH IS DESIGNED TO FOCUS ON LONGER TERM STRATEGIC OBJECTIVES OF THE ORGANIZATION. SUTTERS LONG TERM PERFORMANCE PLAN APPROACH IS A COMBINATION OF BOTH LONGER TERM MEASURES OF ORGANIZATION SUCCESS AND KEY ORGANIZATION STRATEGIES WHICH REQUIRE THE COMBINED EFFORT OF ALL LEADERSHIP TO ACHIEVE SUCCESS. SUTTER USES A COMMON FATE APPROACH IN THAT ALL PLAN PARTICIPANTS ARE MEASURED AGAINST THE SAME, ORGANIZATION-WIDE CRITERIA VS. INDIVIDUAL EFFORTS. THIS FOSTERS A COMMON PURPOSE ACROSS LEADERSHIP AND A SHARED SENSE OF ACCOUNTABILITY FOR THE OVERALL SUCCESS OF SUTTER HEALTH. TO ENSURE THAT EXTRAORDINARY EFFORTS BY INDIVIDUALS CAN BE RECOGNIZED AND THAT ACTIONS OF LEADERSHIP ARE CONSISTENT WITH SUPPORTING SUTTER HEALTHS OVERALL MISSION, VISION, AND VALUES, SUTTERS LONG TERM PERFORMANCE PLAN APPROACH ALSO INCORPORATES A COMBINATION OF CEO AND SUTTER HEALTH COMPENSATION COMMITTEE DISCRETION. IN SOME CASES, THE SUTTER HEALTH COMPENSATION COMMITTEE HAS DELEGATED AUTHORITY TO THE PRESIDENT & CEO TO MODIFY INDIVIDUAL AWARDS WITHIN LIMITS THAT HAVE BEEN PRE-APPROVED BY THE SUTTER HEALTH COMPENSATION COMMITTEE. THIS INCLUDES BOTH THE REDUCTION AND INCREASE OF AWARD AMOUNTS. SUCH MODIFICATIONS GENERALLY DO NOT EXCEED +/- 20% AND ARE EMPLOYED JUDICIOUSLY. IN ALL CASES, THE COMPENSATION COMMITTEE OF THE BOARD DETERMINES ACHIEVEMENT OF ORGANIZATION GOALS AND MAKES FINAL AWARD DETERMINATION WHICH MAY RESULT IN A REDUCTION OF AWARD IF APPROPRIATE.
