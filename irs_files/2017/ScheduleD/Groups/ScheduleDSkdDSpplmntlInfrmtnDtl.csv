Its endowment includes both donor-restricted endowment funds and funds designated by the Board of Trustees to function as endowments. As required by U.S. generally accepted accounting principles (GAAP), net assets associated with endowment funds, including funds designated by the Board of Trustees to function as endowments, are classified and reported based on the existence or absence of donor-imposed restrictions. The College has adopted investment and spending policies for endowment assets that attempt to provide a predictable stream of funding to programs supported by its endowment while seeking to maintain the purchasing power of the endowment assets. Endowment assets include those assets of donor-restricted funds that the College must hold in perpetuity or for a donor-specified period(s) as well as board-designated funds. Under this policy, as approved by the Board of Trustees, the endowment assets are invested in a manner that is intended to produce results that exceed the price and yield results of appropriate market indices while assuming a moderate level of investment risk. The College's investment objectives are to provide a total return sufficient to support the College's operating budget while preserving the assets against inflation. To meet these objectives the Board seeks a total return of at least 5% greater than the rate of inflation as measured by the Consumer Price Index (U.S. CPI-U) over a long-term horizon. Total return is defined as dividends or interest income, plus or minus realized and unrealized capital appreciation or depreciation at fair market value, net of fees. The maximum amount of endowment income utilization is determined by a spending formula approved by the Board of Trustees. The amount available for spending is set at 5% of the previous three-year average market value for the years ended June 30, 2016 and 2015, respectively. The amounts available to be distributed, net of unspent endowment income, under the spending policy were $525,306 and $515,726 for the years ended June 30, 2016 and 2015, respectively. These amounts are included in change in net assets from operations. Investment income greater or less than the amounts available to be distributed under the spending policy is reported as nonoperating income."

Under this guidance, the College may recognize the tax benefit from an uncertain tax position only if it is more likely than not that the tax position will be sustained on examination by taxing authorities, based on the technical merits of the position.

This section provides that the tax effects from an uncertain tax position can be recognized in the financial statements only if the position is ""more-likely-than-not"" to be sustained if the position were to be challenged by a taxing authority. The assessment of the tax position is based solely on the technical merits of the position, without regard to the likelihood that the tax position may be challenged. The College is exempt from federal and New York income taxation by virtue of being an organization described in Section 501(c)(3) of the IRC and similar provisions of the New York State tax code. Nevertheless, the College may be subject to tax on income unrelated to its exempt purpose, unless that income is otherwise excluded by the Code. The tax years ended June 30, 2013, 2014, 2015 and 2016 are still open to audit for both federal and state purposes.

The University files a Form 990 annually. When these returns are filed , it is highly certain that some positions taken would be sustained upon examination by the taxing authorities, while others are subject to uncertainty about the merits of the tax position taken or the amount of the position that would ultimately be sustained. Examples of tax positions common to universities include such matters as the following: the tax exempt status of each entity and various positions relative to potential sources of unrelated business income tax (UBIT). UBIT is reported on Form 990-T, as appropriate. The benefit of a tax position is recognized in the financial statements in the period during which, based on all available evidence, management believes that it is more likely than not that the position will be sustained upon examination, including the resolution of appeals or litigation processes, if any. Tax positions are not offset or aggregated with other positions. Tax positions that meet the ""more likely than not"" recognition threshold are measured as the largest amount of tax benefit that is more than 50% likely to be realized on settlement with the applicable taxing authority. The portion of the benefits associated with tax positions taken that exceeds the amount measured as described above would be reflected as a liability for uncertain tax benefits in the accompanying statements of financial position along with any associated interest and penalties that would be payable to the taxing authorities upon examination. As of June 30, 2016 and 2015, there were no uncertain tax positions identified. The University does not expect the total amount of unrecognized tax benefits to significantly change in the next 12 months. Forms 990 and 990-T filed by the University are subject to the examination by the IRS up to three years from the extended due date of each return. Management believes the Forms 990 and 990-T have been filed appropriately. Forms 990 and 990-T filed by the University are no longer subject to examination for the fiscal years ended June 30, 2012 or prior. The University would recognize interest and penalties related to unrecognized tax positions in interest and income tax expense, respectively.

Under this guidance, the Institute may recognize the tax benefit from an uncertain tax position only if it is more likely than not that the tax position will be sustained on examination by taxing authorities, based on the technical merits of the position.

This section provides that the tax effects from an uncertain tax position can be recognized in the financial statements only if the position is ""more-likely-than-not"" to be sustained if the position were to be challenged by a taxing authority. The assessment of the tax position is based solely on the technical merits of the position, without regard to the likelihood that the tax position may be challenged. The College is exempt from federal income taxation by virtue of being an organization described in Section 501(c)(3) of the Internal Revenue Code. Nevertheless, the College may be subject to tax on income unrelated to its exempt purpose, unless that income is otherwise excluded by the Code.

The University's award-winning gardens, libraries and museums play a critical role in making both the University's collections and its broader work accessible to the widest possible audiences. Collectively they welcome more than three million people each year - from local residents and school children to national and international visitors - providing a huge programme of exhibitions, talks, tours and family-friendly activities. Collections can be discovered through new spaces like the popular Weston Library or digital resources like digital.bodleian.ox.ac.uk and www.oum.ox.ac.uk/collections. In 2015, an ambitious new Contemporary Science and Society programme was launched at the Oxford University Museum of Natural History, bringing cutting-edge, multi-disciplinary research into the natural environment to the public. 'Biosense', the first exhibition in the series, saw the museum partner with academics to share their current research with over 200,000 museum visitors. The Joint Museums Outreach Service also takes collections out into the community and supports those who would not usually visit the museums to do so with confidence.

THERE IS ALSO A LARGE COLLECTION OF FOSSILS AND ROCKS AND MINERALS IN THE STORAGE AREA THAT IS IN THE PROCESS OF BEING INVENTORIED. MANY LOCAL TEACHERS BRING THEIR CLASSES TO THE JURICA-SUCHY NATURE MUSEUM TO FOCUS ON PARTICULAR THEMES TO ENHANCE THEIR CURRICULUM. THE STUDENTS TAKE A BRIEF TOUR; VISIT THE LEARNING CIRCLE UNDER THE WHALE TO TOUCH DIFFERENT SPECIMENS AND THEN SET OFF TO WORK ON AN ACTIVITY SHEET SELECTED BY THE TEACHER. BECAUSE THE MUSEUM IS AN INTIMATE SPACE, FILLED WITH SPECIMENS, CHILDREN ARE ABLE TO MAKE OBSERVATIONS, EXPLORE DIFFERENCES AMONG THE SPECIMENS, AND THINK ABOUT THEM. THE MUSEUM HOSTS MANY HOME SCHOOL FAMILIES AND ALSO IS USED BY OUR BENEDICTINE STUDENTS FOR CLASS ASSIGNMENTS IN BIOLOGY, ART AND EDUCATION. THERE ARE OVER 5,000 VISITORS TO THE MUSEUM EACH YEAR. IN ADDITION, THE JURICA-SUCHY NATURE MUSEUM OFFERS A DISCOVERY BOX LOAN PROGRAM OF MORE THAN 40 BOXES FOR TEACHERS, HOME SCHOOL FAMILIES AND OTHER GROUPS. THE BOXES CONTAIN MUSEUM SPECIMENS, BACKGROUND INFORMATION, VISUAL AIDS, CURRICULAR GUIDES, AND SUGGESTED CLASSROOM ACTIVITIES. THIS PROGRAM REACHES AN ADDITIONAL 5,000 CHILDREN EACH YEAR. THESE PROGRAMS ARE OFFERED AT NO COST TO OUR PUBLIC AS A MEANS OF FURTHERING EDUCATION IN THE NATURAL SCIENCES IN OUR COMMUNITY.

THE UNIVERSITY IS ALSO HOST TO VARIOUS SUMMER SPORTS AND MUSIC CAMPS WHEREBY AN ADDITIONAL VIEWING AUDIENCE FROM THE COMMUNITY IS ABLE TO SEE AND APPRECIATE THE ART COLLECTION.

As such, the University is generally not subject to federal or state income taxes except for certain income derived from unrelated business activities as defined by the IRC. Any such taxes resulting from unrelated business activities are insignificant to the operations of the University. U.S. GAAP prescribes recognition thresholds and measurement attributes for the financial statement recognition and measurement of a tax position taken or expected to be taken in a tax return. Tax benefits will be recognized only if the tax position is more-likely-than-not sustained in a tax examination, with a tax examination being presumed to occur. The amount recognized will be the largest amount of tax benefit that is greater than 50% likely of being realized on examination. For tax positions not meeting the more-likely-than-not test, no tax benefit will be recorded. Management has concluded that they are unaware of any tax benefits or liabilities to be recognized at June 30, 2016 and 2015. The University is no longer subject to examination by U.S. federal taxing authorities for years before 2013 and for all state income taxes through 2013.

This guidance provides that the tax effects from an uncertain tax position can only be recognized in the financial statements if the position is ""more-likely-than-not"" to be sustained if the position were to be challenged by a taxing authority. the assessment of the tax position is based solely on the technical merits of the position, without regard to the likelihood that the tax position may be challenged. Dominican is exempt from federal income tax under IRC section 501(c)(3), though it is subject to tax on income unrelated to its exempt purpose, unless that income is otherise excluded by the code. Dominican has processes presently in place to ensure the maintenance of its tax-exempt status; to identify and report unrelated income; to determine its filing and tax obligations in jurisdictions for which it was nexus; and to identiy and evaluate other matters that may be considered tax positions.

The University is not classified as a private foundation. The University files a Form 990 (Return of Organization Exempt from Income Tax) annually. When these returns are filed, it is highly certain that some positions taken would be sustained upon examination by the taxing authorities, while others are subject to uncertainty about the merits of the tax position taken or the amount of the position that would ultimately be sustained. Examples of tax positions common to universities include such matters as the following: the tax exempt status of each entity and various positions relative to potential sources of unrelated business income tax (""UBIT""). UBIT is reported on Form 990-T, as appropriate. The benefit of a tax position is recognized in the financial statements in the period during which, based on all available evidence, management believes that it is more likely than not that the position will be sustained upon examination, including the resolution of appeals or litigation processes, if any. Tax positions are not offset or aggregated with other positions. Tax positions that meet the ""more likely than not"" recognition threshold are measured as the largest amount of tax benefit that is more than 50% likely to be realized on settlement with the applicable taxing authority. The portion of the benefits associated with tax positions taken that exceeds the amount measured as described above would be reflected as a liability for uncertain tax benefits in the accompanying statements of financial position along with any associated interest and penalties that would be payable to the taxing authorities upon examination. As of May 31, 2016 and 2015, there were no uncertain tax positions identified. The University does not expect the total amount of unrecognized tax benefits to significantly change in the next 12 months. Forms 990 and 990-T filed by the University are subject to examination by the Internal Revenue Service (IRS) up to three years from the extended due date of each return. Management believes the Forms 990 and 990-T have been filed appropriately. Forms 990 and 990-T filed by the University are no longer subject to examination for the fiscal years ended May 31, 2012 and prior. The University would recognize interest and penalties related to unrecognized tax positions in interest and income tax expense, respectively.

This support includes funds for scholarships and for specific academic programs. The University has adopted an endowment spending policy designed to provide a predictable flow of funds to operations. The policy is intended to balance current spending needs and preserve the endowment's future purchasing power. The University applies a 4.5% spending rate to a three-year moving average of endowment investment funds. The Board of Regents sets the spending rate. The purpose of using a moving average is to smooth out any wide fluctuations in the market value. Endowment earnings in excess of the spending rate are added back to the principal of the endowment investments. In years when yield exceeds the amount appropriated under the spending policy the excess is returned to principal as appreciation. When annual yield is insufficient to support spending appropriations, the balance is provided from accumulated appreciation. Special allocations are made for certain purposes in addition to the spending rate, as approved by the University's Board of Regents, annually."

The assessment of the tax position is based solely on the technical merits of the position, without regard to the likelihood that the tax position may be challenged. The University is exempt from Federal and New Jersey State Income taxation by virtue of being an organization described in Section 501(c)(3) of the IRC and similar provisions of the New jersey State tax code.

No provision has been made for income taxes in the accompanying financial statements as the College had no material unrelated business income in fiscal years 2016 and 2015. The College follows guidance issued by the FASB, ASU 2009-06, with respect to accounting for uncertainty in income taxes. A tax position is recognized as a benefit only if it is ""more likely than not"" that the tax position would be sustained in a tax examination, with a tax examination being presumed to occur. The amount recognized is the largest amount of tax benefit that is greater than 50% likely of being realized on examination. For tax positions not meeting the ""more likely than not"" test, no tax benefit is recorded. The College recognizes interest and penalties related to unrecognized tax benefits in interest and income tax expense, respectively. The College has no amounts accrued for interest or penalties as of May 31, 2016. The College does not expect the total amount of unrecognized tax benefits to significantly change in the next 12 months. The College has applied this criterion to all tax positions for which the statute of limitations remains open. The tax years open to examination by tax authorities under the statute of limitations include fiscal 2013 through 2015. The College has determined that its tax provision satisfies the more likely than not criterion, and that no provision for income taxes is required at May 31, 2016."

CLARK SEELYE BOUGHT WORKS OF CONTEMPORARY AMERICAN ART, OFTEN DIRECTLY FROM THE ARTISTS THEMSELVES, BELIEVING THAT STUDENTS SHOULD BE FAMILIAR WITH THE ART OF THEIR OWN TIME. AMERICAN ART HAS REMAINED ONE OF THE COLLECTIONS' CORE STRENGTHS. BY THE EARLY TWENTIETH CENTURY, ALFRED VANCE CHURCHILL, THE MUSEUM'S FIRST DIRECTOR, HAD EXPANDED THE COLLECTING SPHERE TO INCLUDE EUROPEAN ART. AT THE REQUEST OF THE COLLEGE'S TRUSTEES, CHURCHILL FORMALIZED THE MUSEUM'S COLLECTING GUIDELINES IN 1920. THESE INVOLVED A ""CONCENTRATION PLAN"" THAT FOCUSED ON THE MODERN ERA, WHICH HE DEFINED AS BEGINNING WITH THE FRENCH REVOLUTION. HIS PLAN EMPHASIZED THE IMPORTANCE OF COLLECTING WORKS OF HIGH QUALITY, WHILE RECOGNIZING THE INSTRUCTIONAL VALUE OF PREPARATORY STUDIES AND UNFINISHED WORKS THAT SHOW AN ARTIST'S WORKING METHOD. GUIDED BY THIS PLAN, THE MUSEUM ASSEMBLED IMPORTANT HOLDINGS OF FRENCH ART OF THE NINETEENTH CENTURY, INCLUDING SUPERB WORKS BY EDGAR DEGAS, JEAN-BAPTISTE-CAMILLE COROT, GUSTAVE COURBET, PAUL CEZANNE, CLAUDE MONET AND OTHERS. THE PLAN WAS REVISITED IN THE EARLY 1990S, AND ACQUIRING WORKS BY WOMEN ARTISTS AND ARTISTS OF COLOR BECAME A COLLECTING PRIORITY. IN THE LAST DECADE, THE COLLECTING PLAN HAS SIGNIFICANTLY EXPANDED TO INCLUDE AFRICAN, ISLAMIC, AND, PARTICULARLY, ASIAN ART TO SUPPORT THE COLLEGE'S GLOBAL CURRICULUM. THE NEWEST ACQUISITIONS TO THE MUSEUM'S COLLECTION INCLUDE WORKS BY JAUNE QUICK-TO-SEE SMITH, ANA MENDIETA, MISHIMA KIMIYO, TADDEO DI BARTOLO, ROBERT MOTHERWELL AND BETYE SAAR.

THE COLLEGE'S SPENDING AND INVESTMENT POLICIES WORK TOGETHER TO ACHIEVE THIS OBJECTIVE. THE INVESTMENT POLICY ESTABLISHES AN ACHIEVABLE RETURN OBJECTIVE THROUGH DIVERSIFICATION OF ASSET CLASSES. THE CURRENT LONG-TERM RETURN OBJECTIVE IS TO ACHIEVE A TOTAL RETURN (INCOME PLUS CAPITAL CHANGE, NET OF ALL INVESTMENT EXPENSES) EQUAL TO OR EXCEEDING ANY APPROVED DISTRIBUTION RATE, PLUS THE INFLATION RATE AS MEASURED BY THE CONSUMER PRICE INDEX. ACTUAL RETURNS IN ANY GIVEN YEAR MAY VARY FROM THIS AMOUNT. TO SATISFY ITS LONG-TERM RATE-OF-RETURN OBJECTIVES, THE COLLEGE RELIES ON A TOTAL RETURN STRATEGY IN WHICH INVESTMENT RETURNS ARE ACHIEVED THROUGH BOTH CAPITAL APPRECIATION (REALIZED AND UNREALIZED) AND CURRENT YIELD (INTEREST AND DIVIDENDS). THE COLLEGE TARGETS A DIVERSIFIED ASSET ALLOCATION THAT PLACES AN EMPHASIS ON U.S. EQUITY-BASED INVESTMENTS AND U.S. INTERMEDIATE-TERM DEBT SECURITIES TO ACHIEVE ITS LONG-TERM RETURN OBJECTIVES WITHIN PRUDENT RISK PARAMETERS. TTHE SPENDING POLICY CALCULATES THE AMOUNT OF MONEY ANNUALLY DISTRIBUTED FROM THE COLLEGE'S VARIOUS ENDOWED FUNDS, FOR SCHOLARSHIPS, PROGRAMS AND ADMINISTRATION. THE COLLEGE UTILIZES A TOTAL RETURN SPENDING RATE POLICY WHICH LIMITS THE AMOUNT OF INVESTMENT RETURN USED TO SUPPORT CURRENT OPERATIONS.

The Law School is also exempt from California income taxes under the related State provisions. Management believes that the Law School will continue to be exempt from taxes. As of July 1, 2010, the Law School adopted accounting guidance related to uncertain tax positions. In accordance with this guidance, Management is required to determine whether a tax position of the Law School is more likely than not to be sustained upon examination by the applicable taxing authority, including resolution of any related appeals or litigation processes, based on the technical merits of the position. The tax benefit to be recognized is measured as the largest amount of benefit that is greater than fifty percent likely of being realized upon ultimate settlement. Derecognition of a tax benefit previously recognized could result in the Law School recording a tax liability that would reduce net assets. The Law School has reviewed all significant tax positions for material tax jurisdictions including the U.S. federal and California state tax jurisdictions for which the statute of limitations remained open which is generally three years for federal and state taxes and four years for California. The open tax years are 2012 through 2016 for federal and 2011through 2016 for California tax years and determined there were no material unrecognized tax benefits. However, the statue can be extended if there was a failure to file a necessary tax return. In addition, there have been no material changes in unrecognized benefits since July 1, 2015, nor are any anticipated in the 12 months following June 30, 2016. However, management's conclusions regarding this policy may be subject to review and adjustment at a later date based on factors including, but not limited to, on-going analyses of and changes to tax laws, regulations and interpretations thereof.

THE MAJORITY OF THE ENDOWMENT FUNDS ARE DESIGNATED FOR STUDENT AWARDS, BUT THERE ARE A FEW IN PLACE WITH THE INTENT TO HELP SUPPORT A PARTICULAR PROGRAM. THE UNIVERSITY'S ENDOWMENT CONSISTS OF APPROXIMATELY 100 INDIVIDUAL FUNDS ESTABLISHED FOR A VARIETY OF PURPOSES. ITS ENDOWMENT INCLUDES BOTH DONOR-RESTRICTED ENDOWMENT FUNDS AND FUNDS DESIGNATED BY THE BOARD OF TRUSTEES TO FUNCTION AS ENDOWMENTS. AS REQUIRED BY ACCOUNTING PRINCIPLES GENERALLY ACCEPTED IN THE UNITED STATES OF AMERICA, NET ASSETS ASSOCIATED WITH ENDOWMENT FUNDS, INCLUDING FUNDS DESIGNATED BY THE BOARD OF TRUSTEES TO FUNCTION AS ENDOWMENTS, ARE CLASSIFIED AND REPORTED BASED ON THE EXISTENCE OR ABSENCE OF DONOR-IMPOSED RESTRICTIONS. THE BOARD OF TRUSTEES OF THE UNIVERSITY HAS INTERPRETED PENNSYLVANIA LAW AS REQUIRING THE PRESERVATION OF THE FAIR VALUE OF THE ORIGINAL GIFT AS OF THE GIFT DATE OF THE DONOR-RESTRICTED ENDOWMENT FUNDS ABSENT EXPLICIT DONOR STIPULATIONS TO THE CONTRARY. AS A RESULT OF THIS INTERPRETATION, THE UNIVERSITY CLASSIFIES AS PERMANENTLY RESTRICTED NET ASSETS (A) THE ORIGINAL VALUE OF GIFTS DONATED TO THE PERMANENT ENDOWMENT, (B) THE ORIGINAL VALUE OF SUBSEQUENT GIFTS TO THE PERMANENT ENDOWMENT, AND (C) ACCUMULATIONS TO THE PERMANENT ENDOWMENT MADE IN ACCORDANCE WITH THE DIRECTION OF THE APPLICABLE DONOR GIFT INSTRUMENT AT THE TIME THE ACCUMULATION IS ADDED TO THE FUND. THE REMAINING PORTION OF THE DONOR-RESTRICTED ENDOWMENT FUND THAT IS NOT CLASSIFIED IN PERMANENTLY RESTRICTED NET ASSETS IS CLASSIFIED AS EITHER TEMPORARILY RESTRICTED OR UNRESTRICTED NET ASSETS BASED ON THE EXISTENCE OF DONOR RESTRICTIONS OR BY LAW. THE UNIVERSITY CONSIDERS THE FOLLOWING FACTORS IN MAKING A DETERMINATION TO APPROPRIATE OR ACCUMULATE DONOR-RESTRICTED ENDOWMENT FUNDS: 1. THE DURATION AND PRESERVATION OF THE FUND 2. THE PURPOSES OF THE UNIVERSITY AND THE DONOR-RESTRICTED ENDOWMENT FUND 3. GENERAL ECONOMIC CONDITIONS 4. THE POSSIBLE EFFECT OF INFLATION AND DEFLATION 5. THE EXPECTED TOTAL RETURN FROM INCOME AND THE APPRECIATION OF INVESTMENTS 6. OTHER RESOURCES OF THE UNIVERSITY 7. THE INVESTMENT POLICIES OF THE UNIVERSITY THE UNIVERSITY HAS ADOPTED INVESTMENT AND SPENDING POLICIES FOR ENDOWMENT ASSETS THAT ATTEMPT TO PROVIDE A PREDICTABLE STREAM OF FUNDING TO PROGRAMS SUPPORTED BY ITS ENDOWMENT WHILE SEEKING TO MAINTAIN THE PURCHASING POWER OF THE ENDOWMENT ASSETS. ENDOWMENT ASSETS INCLUDE THOSE ASSETS OF DONOR-RESTRICTED FUNDS THAT THE UNIVERSITY MUST HOLD IN PERPETUITY OR FOR A DONOR-SPECIFIED PERIOD(S) AS WELL AS BOARD-DESIGNATED FUNDS. UNDER THIS POLICY, AS APPROVED BY THE BOARD OF TRUSTEES, THE ENDOWMENT ASSETS ARE INVESTED IN A MANNER THAT IS INTENDED TO PRODUCE RESULTS THAT EXCEED THE PRICE AND YIELD RESULTS OF THE S&P 500 INDEX WHILE ASSUMING A MODERATE LEVEL OF INVESTMENT RISK. THE UNIVERSITY EXPECTS ITS ENDOWMENT FUNDS, OVER TIME, TO PROVIDE AN AVERAGE RATE OF RETURN OF APPROXIMATELY 9 PERCENT ANNUALLY. ACTUAL RETURNS IN ANY GIVEN YEAR MAY VARY FROM THIS AMOUNT. TO SATISFY ITS LONG-TERM RATE-OF-RETURN OBJECTIVES, THE UNIVERSITY RELIES ON A TOTAL RETURN STRATEGY IN WHICH INVESTMENT RETURNS ARE ACHIEVED THROUGH BOTH CAPITAL APPRECIATION (REALIZED AND UNREALIZED) AND CURRENT YIELD (INTEREST AND DIVIDENDS). THE UNIVERSITY TARGETS A DIVERSIFIED ASSET ALLOCATION THAT PLACES A GREATER EMPHASIS ON EQUITY-BASED INVESTMENTS TO ACHIEVE ITS LONG-TERM RETURN OBJECTIVES WITHIN PRUDENT RISK CONSTRAINTS. THE UNIVERSITY HAS A POLICY OF APPROPRIATING FOR DISTRIBUTION EACH YEAR 3.5 TO 5 PERCENT OF ITS ENDOWMENT FUNDS' AVERAGE FAIR VALUE OVER THE PRIOR 12 QUARTERS THROUGH THE CALENDAR YEAR-END PROCEEDING THE FISCAL YEAR IN WHICH THE DISTRIBUTION IS PLANNED. IN ESTABLISHING THIS POLICY, THE UNIVERSITY CONSIDERED THE LONG-TERM EXPECTED RETURN ON ITS ENDOWMENT. ACCORDINGLY, OVER THE LONG TERM, THE UNIVERSITY EXPECTS THE CURRENT SPENDING POLICY TO ALLOW ITS ENDOWMENT TO GROW AT AN AVERAGE OF 4 PERCENT ANNUALLY.

The Universitys Board adopted a spending policy of 4.75% with a view toward balancing the need for expendable funds for University programs against the need to preserve the endowment against inflation. In order to achieve the objective of maintaining purchasing power, the endowments annual rate of return must equal the annual distribution, plus inflation, plus management, custodial and administrative fees. This distribution to the University is based on a 12 quarter moving average of the market value. This spending method protects the Universitys distribution from increased volatility in the markets. Distributions are provided to students for scholarships, various colleges, and programs in accordance with donor designations. The distributions are reflected in the net assets of the endowment fund. However, there is not a transfer of actual cash from the endowment fund. Without requiring a liquidation of cash, this treatment allows the investments of the endowment to grow."

Management of the University believes there are no uncertain tax positions. The tax years ended 2013, 2014, 2015, and 2016 are still open to audit for federal purposes."

The College is also recognized by the Franchise Tax Board as exempt from California state tax on related income under Section 23701d of the California Revenue and Taxation Code. The College has identified and evaluated significant tax positions in its significant tax jurisdictions which are the federal and California state tax jurisdictions. The College has also determined that the open tax years are generally three years for federal and four years for California tax purposes. Thus, the general open tax years are the years ended June 30, 2013 through June 30, 2016 for federal purposes and the years ended June 30, 2012 through June 30, 2016 for California purposes. For federal there is an unrelated business income net operating loss carryover of approximately $1,475,000 and $1,440,000 as of June 30, 2016 and 2015, respectively. For California there is an unrelated business income net operating loss carryover of approximately $1,475,000 and $1,440,000 as of June 30, 2016 and 2015, respectively. For federal, the tax effect of the net operating loss was approximately $501,000 and $490,000 as of June 30, 2016 and 2015, respectively. For California, the tax effect of the net operating loss was approximately $130,000 and $127,000 as of June 30, 2016 and 2015, respectively. A net operating loss can only be reflected as a benefit (deferred tax asset) on the statement on financial position when it is likely that the loss would be utilized against taxable income in another tax year. Since there is not presently a likelihood of taxable income in another tax year, the College has a valuation allowance against the deferred tax asset for federal and California for the full amount of approximately $631,000 and $617,000 as of June 30, 2016 and 2015, respectively. Therefore, there is no deferred tax asset on the statement on financial position and there have been no related tax penalties or interest, which would be classified as tax expense in the statement of activities.

Examples of tax positions include the tax-exempt status of the College, the continued tax-exempt status of bonds issued by the College, and various positions related to the potential sources of unrelated business taxable income (UBIT). The tax benefits recognized in the financial statements from such a position are measured based on the largest benefit that has a greater than 50 percent likelihood of being realized upon ultimate settlement. The guidance on accounting for uncertainty in income taxes also addresses de-recognition, classification, interest and penalties on income taxes, and accounting in interim periods. At June 30, 2016 and 2015, there were no unrecognized tax benefits identified or recorded as liabilities. With few exceptions, the College is no longer subject to examinations by tax authorities for fiscal years prior to 2013."

SACKLER MUSEUM) AND FOUR RESEARCH CENTERS (STRAUS CENTER FOR CONSERVATION AND TECHNICAL STUDIES, CENTER FOR THE TECHNICAL STUDY OF MODERN ART, HARVARD ART MUSEUM ARCHIVES, ARCHAEOLOGICAL EXPLORATION OF SARDIS, TURKEY). THE MUSEUMS' COLLECTION CONSISTS OF MORE THAN 250,000 OBJECTS IN ALL MEDIA, RANGING IN DATE FROM ANTIQUITY TO THE PRESENT WITH WORLDWIDE ORIGINS. THE COLLECTION IS AN IMPORTANT RESOURCE FOR THE HARVARD UNIVERSITY COMMUNITY, AS WELL AS TO A BROADER AUDIENCE OF STUDENTS, SCHOLARS, AND THE GENERAL PUBLIC. IT IS USED TO ADVANCE THE KNOWLEDGE AND APPRECIATION OF ART AND ART MUSEUMS THROUGH PROGRAMS INVOLVING RESEARCH, TEACHING, PROFESSIONAL TRAINING, AND PUBLIC EDUCATION. ARNOLD ARBORETUM: THE ARNOLD ARBORETUM OF HARVARD UNIVERSITY IS THE OLDEST PUBLIC ARBORETUM IN NORTH AMERICA AND ONE OF THE WORLD'S LEADING CENTERS FOR THE STUDY OF PLANTS. ADMINISTERED BY THE OFFICE OF THE PROVOST OF HARVARD UNIVERSITY AND A LINK IN BOSTON'S EMERALD NECKLACE OF PARKS, THE ARNOLD ARBORETUM IS A UNIQUE BLEND OF RESPECTED RESEARCH INSTITUTION AND BELOVED PUBLIC LANDSCAPE. WE PROVIDE AND SUPPORT WORLD-CLASS RESEARCH, HORTICULTURE, AND EDUCATION PROGRAMS THAT FOSTER THE UNDERSTANDING, APPRECIATION, AND PRESERVATION OF TREES. COLLECTION OF HISTORICAL SCIENTIFIC INSTRUMENTS: HARVARD UNIVERSITY HAS BEEN ACQUIRING SCIENTIFIC INSTRUMENTS ON A CONTINUOUS BASIS FOR TEACHING AND RESEARCH SINCE 1672. THE COLLECTION OF HISTORICAL SCIENTIFIC INSTRUMENTS, WHICH WAS ESTABLISHED IN 1948 TO PRESERVE THIS APPARATUS AS A RESOURCE FOR TEACHING AND RESEARCH IN THE HISTORY OF SCIENCE AND TECHNOLOGY, HAS BECOME ONE OF THE THREE LARGEST UNIVERSITY COLLECTIONS OF ITS KIND IN THE WORLD. IT CONTAINS OVER 20,000 OBJECTS DATING FROM ABOUT 1400 TO THE PRESENT. A BROAD RANGE OF SCIENTIFIC DISCIPLINES ARE REPRESENTED, INCLUDING ASTRONOMY, NAVIGATION, HOROLOGY, SURVEYING, GEOLOGY, CALCULATING, PHYSICS, BIOLOGY, MEDICINE, PSYCHOLOGY, ELECTRICITY, AND COMMUNICATION. SIGNIFICANT INSTRUMENTS, MADE OBSOLETE BY NEW TECHNOLOGIES, CONTINUE TO BE INCORPORATED. MANY OF THE DOCUMENTS DETAILING THE PURCHASE AND USE OF THE INSTRUMENTS HAVE BEEN PRESERVED, AND ARE AVAILABLE FOR RESEARCH IN THE COLLECTION'S ADJUNCT LIBRARY. MUSEUM OF COMPARATIVE ZOOLOGY (WITHIN THE MUSEUM OF NATURAL HISTORY): THE MUSEUM OF COMPARATIVE ZOOLOGY (THE MCZ) WAS FOUNDED IN 1859 ON THE CONCEPT THAT COLLECTIONS ARE AN INTEGRAL AND FUNDAMENTAL COMPONENT OF ZOOLOGICAL RESEARCH AND TEACHING. THIS 150-YEAR-OLD COMMITMENT REMAINS A STRONG AND PROUD TRADITION FOR THE MCZ. THE PRESENT-DAY MCZ CONTAINS OVER 21 MILLION SPECIMENS IN TEN RESEARCH COLLECTIONS WHICH COMPRISE ONE OF THE WORLD'S RICHEST AND MOST VARIED RESOURCES FOR STUDYING THE DIVERSITY OF LIFE. THE MUSEUM SERVES AS THE PRIMARY REPOSITORY FOR ZOOLOGICAL SPECIMENS COLLECTED BY PAST AND PRESENT HARVARD FACULTY-CURATORS, STAFF AND ASSOCIATES CONDUCTING RESEARCH AROUND THE WORLD. AS A PREMIER UNIVERSITY MUSEUM AND RESEARCH INSTITUTION, THE SPECIMENS AND THEIR RELATED DATA ARE AVAILABLE TO RESEARCHERS OF THE SCIENTIFIC AND MUSEUM COMMUNITY. USE OF THE COLLECTIONS IN STUDENT RESEARCH IS ALSO ENCOURAGED. FISHER MUSEUM HARVARD FOREST: THE FISHER MUSEUM'S MAIN EXHIBIT DISPLAYS TWENTY-THREE INTERNATIONALLY ACCLAIMED MODELS (DIORAMAS) PORTRAYING THE HISTORY, CONSERVATION AND MANAGEMENT OF CENTRAL NEW ENGLAND FORESTS. OTHER EXHIBITS AT THE MUSEUM REPRESENT THE RANGE OF HARVARD FOREST'S RESEARCH. HARVARD UNIVERSITY HERBARIA (WITHIN MUSEUM OF NATURAL HISTORY): THE HARVARD UNIVERSITY HERBARIA ARE AMONG SOME SEVERAL THOUSAND COLLECTIONS OF PRESSED, DRIED PLANT SPECIMENS WORLDWIDE THAT ARE USED BY RESEARCHERS TO FURTHER OUR UNDERSTANDING OF THE PLANT WORLD. SOME OF THE EARLIEST HERBARIA WERE FOUNDED IN EUROPE IN THE EARLY 1600'S, DURING THE DAYS OF EXPLORATION, WHEN KNOWLEDGE OF THE EARTH'S FLORA WAS GROWING AT SUCH A RAPID PACE THAT BOTANICAL GARDENS COULD NO LONGER MAINTAIN LIVING EXAMPLES OF EVERY KNOWN SPECIES. WHILE HERBARIUM COLLECTIONS OF ALL SIZES EXIST TODAY, THERE ARE FEWER THAN 75 HERBARIA WORLDWIDE WITH MORE THAN ONE MILLION SPECIMENS. HERBARIUM COLLECTIONS HAVE BEEN BUILT BY THE EFFORTS OF NUMEROUS BOTANISTS AND PLANT COLLECTORS WHO SEARCHED FROM REMOTE AND ISOLATED JUNGLES TO INNER CITY WASTE LOTS AND RAILROAD TRACKS TO DOCUMENT THE DIVERSITY AND DISTRIBUTION OF THE EARTH'S FLORA. REPRESENTATIVES OF MOST KNOWN SPECIES OF PLANTS CAN BE FOUND IN HERBARIA TODAY, CAREFULLY MOUNTED ON SHEETS OF ARCHIVAL QUALITY PAPER, LABELED WITH IMPORTANT INFORMATION ABOUT THEM, AND STORED ON SHELVES IN CABINETS. IN ESSENCE, A HERBARIUM IS ANALOGOUS TO A LIBRARY OF CAREFULLY PRESERVED PLANTS WHERE THE SPECIMENS THEMSELVES AND THE LABELS ASSOCIATED WITH THEM PROVIDE A WEALTH OF INFORMATION ONCE THEY HAVE BEEN ""READ"" AND STUDIED BY SCIENTISTS. THE SPECIMENS ARE THE KEY TO UNDERSTANDING PLANT RELATIONSHIPS, GEOGRAPHIC DISTRIBUTIONS, ECONOMIC USEFULNESS, EVEN THEIR MOLECULAR MAKEUP. AS WE LOSE NATURAL HABITATS THE WORLD OVER, HERBARIA INCREASINGLY SERVE AS A RECORD OF THE RECENT HISTORY OF PLANT LIFE, AND AS A REPOSITORY OF PRECIOUS GENETIC INFORMATION. HERBARIA HOLD THE TOOLS FOR OUR UNDERSTANDING OF THE PLANT WORLD. MINERALOGICAL AND GEOLOGICAL MUSEUM (WITHIN MUSEUM OF NATURAL HISTORY): THE HARVARD MINERAL COLLECTION RANKS AMONG THE WORLD'S FINEST DUE TO ITS VERY BROAD REPRESENTATION, WEALTH OF RARE SPECIES; LARGE NUMBER OF SPECIMENS DESCRIBED IN THE SCIENTIFIC LITERATURE; AND THE QUALITY OF ITS DISPLAY SPECIMENS. A RICH SYSTEMATIC MINERAL COLLECTION AND DISPLAYS OF GEMSTONES ARE THE PRINCIPAL EXHIBITS IN THE MINERAL GALLERY. THE MUSEUM IS COMMITTED TO THE DEVELOPMENT AND PRESERVATION OF WORLD-CLASS COLLECTIONS OF MINERALS, GEMS, ROCKS, ORES, AND METEORITES FOR RESEARCH, EDUCATION, AND PUBLIC DISPLAY. ITS EARLIEST COLLECTIONS DATE BACK TO THE LATE 18TH CENTURY. THE MUSEUM CATERS TO THE HARVARD STUDENTS AND FACULTY AS WELL AS THE GEOLOGICAL COMMUNITY AT LARGE BY SERVING AS A UNIQUELY RICH RESOURCE OF MATERIALS AND INFORMATION. PEABODY MUSEUM OF ARCHAEOLOGY AND ETHNOLOGY: THE PEABODY MUSEUM OF ARCHAEOLOGY AND ETHNOLOGY IS STEWARD TO ONE OF THE OLDEST AND LARGEST COLLECTIONS OF CULTURAL OBJECTS IN THE WESTERN HEMISPHERE. SINCE THE LATE NINETEENTH CENTURY, THE MUSEUM HAS PLAYED AN ACTIVE PART IN THE HISTORY OF AMERICAN ANTHROPOLOGY AND IN THE EVOLVING RELATIONSHIP BETWEEN MUSEUMS AND NATIVE PEOPLES. THE PEABODY STRIVES TO MAKE COLLECTIONS WIDELY ACCESSIBLE AND ENGAGE ISSUES OF CONCERN TO DIVERSE AUDIENCES. TODAY, THE PEABODY HOUSES MORE THAN SIX MILLION INDIVIDUAL OBJECTS, 500,000 PHOTOGRAPHIC IMAGES, AND SUBSTANTIAL ARCHIVAL RECORDS. STRONGEST IN THE CULTURES OF NORTH, CENTRAL, AND SOUTH AMERICA, AND THE PACIFIC ISLANDS, THE PEABODY IS ALSO CARETAKER TO IMPORTANT COLLECTIONS FROM AFRICA, EUROPE, AND ASIA. COLLECTION TYPES INCLUDE ARCHAEOLOGY; ETHNOGRAPHY; OSTEOLOGY; AND PAINTING, DRAWING, AND PRINTS. SEMITIC MUSEUM: THE SEMITIC MUSEUM IS HOME TO THE UNIVERSITY'S COLLECTIONS OF NEAR EASTERN ARCHAEOLOGICAL ARTIFACTS. THESE ARTIFACTS COMPRISE OVER 40,000 ITEMS, INCLUDING POTTERY, CYLINDER SEALS, SCULPTURE, COINS AND CUNEIFORM TABLETS. MANY ARE FROM MUSEUM-SPONSORED EXCAVATIONS IN ISRAEL, JORDAN, IRAQ, EGYPT, CYPRUS, AND TUNISIA. THE MUSEUM IS DEDICATED TO THE USE OF THESE COLLECTIONS FOR THE TEACHING, RESEARCH, AND PUBLICATION OF NEAR EASTERN ARCHAEOLOGY, HISTORY, AND CULTURE. WARREN ANATOMICAL MUSEUM: THE WARREN ANATOMICAL MUSEUM'S PRESENT COLLECTION CONTAINS APPROXIMATELY 15,000 ARTIFACTS AND CASES INCLUDING: ANATOMICAL AND PATHOLOGICAL PREPARATIONS; VARIOUS WAX, PAPER MACHE, AND DRY PREPARATION ANATOMICAL MODELS; PHOTOGRAPHS, PRINTS, PAINTINGS, AND DRAWINGS; MEDICAL INSTRUMENTS AND MACHINES; AND OTHER MEDICAL MEMORABILIA. ALONG WITH THE WELL-KNOWN SKULL OF PHINEAS GAGE, THE MUSEUM HOLDS MANY OTHER RARE AND INTERESTING ITEMS. AMONG THESE ARE THE PHRENOLOGICAL COLLECTION OF JOHANN GASPAR SPURZHEIM, THE BOSTON SOCIETY FOR MEDICAL IMPROVEMENT COLLECTION, AND A W. T. G. MORTON-TYPE ETHER INHALER. THE MUSEUM PROMOTES THE COLLECTION FOR THE PURPOSES OF MEDICAL EDUCATION IN ALL FORMS WHENEVER POSSIBLE, BY EXPANDING ITS SCOPE TO PROVIDE PUBLIC PROGRAMMING AND EDUCATIONAL RESOURCES TO THE LARGER COMMUNITY. CARPENTER CENTER FOR THE VISUAL ARTS: CARPENTER CENTER FOR THE VISUAL ARTS IS DEDICATED TO THE SYNTHESIS OF ART, DESIGN, AND EDUCATION THROUGH THE EXHIBITION OF EXISTING WORKS AND PRODUCTION OF NEW COMMISSIONS. IT STRIVES TO BRING PEOPLE, IDEAS, AND OBJECTS TOGETHER IN GENERATIVE WAYS THAT PROVIDE UNPARALLELED EXPERIENCES WITH CONTEMPORARY ART, ULTIMATELY ENRICHING THE CREATIVE AND INTELLECTUAL LIVES OF THEIR AUDIENCES."

ITS ENDOWMENT INCLUDES BOTH DONOR RESTRICTED ENDOWMENT FUNDS AND FUNDS DESIGNATED BY THE BOARD OF TRUSTEES TO FUNCTION AS ENDOWMENTS. AS REQUIRED BY GENERALLY ACCEPTED ACCOUNTING PRINCIPLES, NET ASSETS ASSOCIATED WITH ENDOWMENT FUNDS, INCLUDING FUNDS DESIGNATED BY THE BOARD TO FUNCTION AS ENDOWMENTS, ARE CLASSIFIED AND REPORTED BASED ON THE EXISTENCE OR ABSENCE OF DONOR-IMPOSED OR LEGAL RESTRICTIONS. THE BOARD OF TRUSTEES HAS INTERPRETED STATE LAW AS ALLOWING THE UTILIZATION OF APPRECIATION ON PERMANENTLY RESTRICTED ASSETS UNLESS EXPLICIT DONOR STIPULATIONS SPECIFY HOW NET APPRECIATION MUST BE USED. AS A RESULT OF THIS INTERPRETATION, THE COLLEGE CLASSIFIES AS PERMANENTLY RESTRICTED NET ASSETS (A) THE ORIGINAL VALUE OF GIFTS DONATED TO THE PERMANENT ENDOWMENT, (B) THE ORIGINAL VALUE OF SUBSEQUENT GIFTS TO THE PERMANENT ENDOWMENT, AND (C) ACCUMULATIONS TO THE PERMANENT ENDOWMENT MADE IN ACCORDANCE WITH THE DIRECTION OF THE APPLICABLE DONOR GIFT INSTRUMENT AT THE TIME THE ACCUMULATION IS ADDED TO THE FUND. THE REMAINING PORTION OF THE DONOR-RESTRICTED ENDOWMENT FUND THAT IS NOT CLASSIFIED IN PERMANENTLY RESTRICTED NET ASSETS IS CLASSIFIED AS TEMPORARILY RESTRICTED NET ASSETS UNTIL THOSE AMOUNTS ARE APPROPRIATED FOR EXPENDITURES BY THE COLLEGE IN A MANNER CONSISTENT WITH THE STANDARD OF PRUDENCE PRESCRIBED BY STATE LAW. IN ACCORDANCE WITH THE UNIFORM PRUDENT MANAGEMENT OF INSTITUTIONAL FUNDS ACT, THE COLLEGE MAY CONSIDER THE FOLLOWING FACTORS IN MAKING A DETERMINATION TO APPROPRIATE OR ACCUMULATE DONOR-RESTRICTED ENDOWMENT FUNDS: THE DURATION AND PRESERVATION OF THE FUND; THE PURPOSES OF THE ORGANIZATION AND THE DONOR-RESTRICTED ENDOWMENT FUND; GENERAL ECONOMIC CONDITIONS; THE POSSIBLE EFFECT OF INFLATION AND DEFLATION; THE EXPECTED TOTAL RETURN FROM INCOME AND THE APPRECIATION OF INVESTMENTS; OTHER RESOURCES OF THE ORGANIZATION; AND THE INVESTMENT POLICIES OF THE ORGANIZATION. THE COLLEGE HAS ADOPTED INVESTMENT AND SPENDING POLICIES FOR ITS BOARD-DESIGNATED AND OTHER ENDOWMENT ASSETS THAT ATTEMPT TO PROVIDE A PREDICTABLE STREAM OF FUNDING FOR ITS PROGRAMS WHILE SEEKING TO MAINTAIN THE PURCHASING POWER OF THE ENDOWMENT ASSETS. UNDER THIS POLICY, AS APPROVED BY THE BOARD, THE COLLEGE'S INVESTMENT COMMITTEE SHALL SEEK TO INVEST THE ENDOWMENT FUNDS IN SUCH A MANNER THAT THE INVESTMENTS WILL PROVIDE A SPENDABLE RETURN CONSISTENT WITH A LONG-TERM GOAL OF PRESERVING THE FUNDS IN REAL TERMS. ACTUAL RETURNS IN ANY GIVEN YEAR MAY VARY FROM THIS AMOUNT. TO SATISFY ITS LONG-TERM RATE-OF-RETURN OBJECTIVES, THE COLLEGE RELIES ON A TOTAL RETURN STRATEGY IN WHICH INVESTMENT RETURNS ARE ACHIEVED THROUGH BOTH CAPITAL APPRECIATION (REALIZED AND UNREALIZED) AND CURRENT YIELD (INTEREST AND DIVIDENDS). THE COLLEGE HAS INVESTED IN DEBT AND EQUITY SECURITIES THAT TARGET A DIVERISIFIED ASSET ALLOCATION THAT PLACES A GREATER EMPHASIS ON EQUITY-BASED INVESTMENTS TO ACHIEVE ITS LONG-TERM RETURN OBJECTIVES WITHIN PRUDENT RISK CONSTRAINTS. THE COLLEGE HAS A POLICY OF APPROPRIATING FOR DISTRIBUTION EACH YEAR 5% OF THE TWELVE-QUARTER AVERAGE FAIR MARKET VALUE OF THE ENDOWMENT CALCULATED AS OF JUNE 30 PRECEDING THE YEAR IN WHICH THE DISTRIBUTION IS PLANNED. IN ESTABLISHING THIS POLICY, THE COLLEGE CONSIDERED THE LONG-TERM EXPECTED RETURN ON ITS ENDOWMENT. THIS IS CONSISTENT WITH THE COLLEGE'S OBJECTIVE TO MAINTAIN THE PURCHASING POWER OF ITS ENDOWMENT. FROM TIME TO TIME, THE FAIR VALUE OF ASSETS ASSOCIATED WITH INDIVIDUAL DONOR-RESTRICTED ENDOWMENT FUNDS MAY FALL BELOW THE LEVEL THAT THE DONOR IMPOSED RESTRICTIONS REQUIRE THE COLLEGE TO RETAIN AS A FUND OF PERPETUAL DURATION.

SCHEDULE D, PART III, LINE 4 THE JOHN CARTER BROWN LIBRARY CONTAINS an internationally renowned, constantly growing collection of primary historical sources pertaining to the Americas, both North and South, before ca. 1825. The John Carter Brown Library collection of 50,000 rare books (printed before ca. 1825), manuscripts, and 16,000 reference books and secondary sources (printed after ca. 1825) is distinguished in many subject areas. Most well-known, perhaps, are the Library's extensive holdings in the literature of European exploration and travel in the Western Hemisphere, from the first Latin edition of the Columbus letter of 1493, through nearly all of the contemporary narratives of Spanish, Portuguese, French, Dutch, and English discovery, exploration, and settlement. The holdings of the library are available to scholars engaged in productive research for whom access to the collection is essential for the advancement of their work. The Brown University Library, in support of the University's educational and research mission, is the local repository for and the principal gateway to current information and the scholarly record. The Brown University Library is comprised of the John D. Rockefeller, Jr. Library; the Sciences Library; the Orwig Music Library; the John Hay Library; and the Annmary Brown Memorial. The John D. Rockefeller, Jr. Library is the primary teaching and research library for the humanities, social sciences, and fine arts. The Sciences Library holds materials that support study and research in the fields of Medicine, Psychology, Neural Science, Environmental Science, Biology, Chemistry, Geology, Physics, Engineering, Computer Science, and Pure and Applied Mathematics, and provides a wide range of services to the staff, students and faculty. The Orwig Music Library houses the general music collection on campus: music books, scores, periodicals, sound recordings, video recordings, and microforms. The collection supports the curriculum of the Music Department and provides material for general use by the Brown community. The John Hay Library houses diverse collections spanning many subjects and time periods, with particularly strong collections in American literature and history, popular culture, military history and iconography, history of science and the art and history of the book. THE ANNMARY BROWN MEMORIAL HOUSES EXHIBITS OF EUROPEAN AND AMERICAN PAINTINGS FROM THE 17TH THROUGH THE 20TH CENTURIES, THE CYRIL AND HARRIET MAZANSKY BRITISH SWORD COLLECTION, AS WELL AS PERSONAL MEMENTOS OF ITS FOUNDER, GENERAL RUSH C.

Original works of art exhibited on campus can inspire students, faculty and staff to a greater appreciation of beauty, the creative process and diversity of critical thought that bridges academic disciplines. The borrowing and display of original works of art must be implemented in a manner that ensures the effective educational and artistic use of the art collections in our keeping. Works must not become mere decoration, lost in the shuffle, forgotten or cast aside. It is of utmost concern that we care for the works of art and use them to some positive educational purpose. CGU policies with respect to the collection support ongoing integration of the art collections in the educational mission of CGU."

The collection was left to Hillsdale College to be used for educational purposes; it is a tool for teaching economics, history, finance, and classics. Portions of the collection are exhibited publicly at Hillsdale College events across the country, extending the educational benefit of the coins to a much wider audience that includes business owners, educators, community leaders, and other interested citizens. SPECIAL LIBRARY COLLECTIONS - a quality library is an essential element of every institution of learning. It exists for the benefit of both students and faculty, as well as for the community in which it resides. In addition to the main study and research collections, the Hillsdale College Mossey Library contains a number of rare and special holdings, including the Ludwig von Mises Library and the Richardson Heritage Room early and rare editions. Ludwig von Mises, the early twentieth century Austrian economist and author of such seminar works as ""The Theory of Money and Credit"" and ""Human Action,"" chose Hillsdale College to be the recipient of his personal library, because of the school's commitment to teach the principles of freedom. This important collection of books, pamphlets, and papers related to free-market economics is housed in the Ludwig von Mises Room in the Mossey Library and is available to Hillsdale faculty and students for research. THE RICHARDSON HERITAGE ROOM contains a collection of rare- and first-edition books that relate to our country's founding and early American history. A bibliography of the collection is available at www.hillsdale.edu. LIBERTY WALK - the mission of Hillsdale College, which has guided the school since its 1844 founding, is to preserve the blessings of civil and religious liberty through ""the diffusion of learning."" The Liberty Walk project is a marvelous example of teaching and learning through objects of art. This collection of over-life-size statues provides visible testimony to the lives of historic defenders of freedom. It calls the citizen observer to vigilance in defending and upholding the principles of freedom. It stands as a constant reminder of the previous nature of freedom and the strength and sacrifice required to preserve it. To date, the collection includes seven statues: The Alpha Kappa Phi Civil War Soldiers' Monument, 1895; George Washington, 2003; Winston Churchill, 2004; Margaret Thatcher, 2008; Thomas Jefferson, 2009; Abraham Lincoln, 2009; and Ronald Reagan, 2011. Future additions to the collection, as funding becomes available, will include Frederick Douglass, James Madison, and Ransom Dunn, who figured prominently in the early days of Hillsdale College history. All statues have been funded through private donations. PRE-COLUMBIAN ART COLLECTION - A collection of statues, pottery, jewelry, and carved or woven vessels, these artifacts date from as early as 500 B.C. to as late as 1532 A.D., and originate from various regions of Central and South America. Representing cultures such as the Mayans and Incas, they represent art in the Americas before the introduction of European cultural influence.

The tax benefit to be recognized is measured as the largest amount of benefit that is greater than fifty percent likely of being realized upon ultimate settlement. Derecognition of a tax benefit previously recognized could result in the University recording a tax liability that would reduce net assets. The University has reviewed all significant tax positions for material tax jurisdictions including US federal, and California and Oregon state tax jurisdictions for which the statute of limitations remained open, which is generally three years for federal and four years for state. The open tax years also include tax years to the extent of net operating loss carry forwards, which add the tax years June 30, 2001 through June 30, 2011 for federal tax purposes and the years ended June 30, 2004 through June 30, 2010, for state tax purposes. The University determined there were no material unrecognized tax benefits in the open tax years. However, the statute can be extended if there was a failure to file a necessary tax return. In addition, there have been no material changes in unrecognized benefits since July 1, 2015, nor are any anticipated in the 12 months following June 30, 2016. However, management's conclusions regarding this policy may be subject to review and adjustment at a later date based on factors including, but not limited to, ongoing analyses of and changes to tax laws, regulations and interpretations thereof.

However, the University is taxed on other unrelated income, if any. The University follows FASB guidance on accounting for uncertainty in income taxes, which addresses the determination of whether tax benefits claimed or expected to be claimed on a tax return should be recorded in the financial statements. Under this guidance, the University may recognize the tax benefit from an uncertain tax position only if it is more likely than not that the tax position will be sustained on examination by taxing authorities, based on the technical merits of the position. Examples of tax positions include the tax-exempt status of the University, the continued tax-exempt status of bonds issued by the University, and various positions related to the potential sources of unrelated business taxable income (UBIT). The tax benefits recognized in the financial statements from such a position are measured based on the largest benefit that has a greater than 50 percent likelihood of being realized upon ultimate settlement. The guidance on accounting for uncertainty in income taxes also addresses de-recognition, classification, interest and penalties on income taxes, and accounting in interim periods. At June 30, 2016 and 2015, there were no unrecognized tax benefits indentified or recorded as liabilites. The University files Forms 990 in the U.S. federal jurisdiction and the required states.

TODAY, STANFORD'S ENDOWMENT CONSISTS OF THOUSANDS OF INDIVIDUAL FUNDS, MANY OF WHICH ARE RESTRICTED TO PARTICULAR USES (E.G., SCHOLARSHIP FUNDS FOR UNDERGRADUATES, FELLOWSHIP FUNDS TO SUPPORT GRADUATE STUDENTS, RESEARCH FUNDS DIRECTED TO MANY DIFFERENT AREAS, PROGRAM SUPPORT FUNDS, FUNDS TO SUPPORT PROFESSORS, FUNDS TO SUPPORT LECTURES, FUNDS TO PROVIDE BUILDING AND GROUND MAINTENANCE, FUNDS TO SUPPORT THE UNIVERSITY'S MUSEUM, FUNDS TO SUPPORT THE ACQUISITION OF LIBRARY MATERIALS). THE FUNDS ARE INVESTED IN PERPETUITY FOR LONG TERM GROWTH AND THE PAYOUT FROM AN ENDOWMENT FUND IS USED FOR THE PURPOSE SET FORTH IN THE GIFT DOCUMENT. SOME ENDOWMENT FUNDS DO NOT HAVE PURPOSE RESTRICTIONS AND THE PAYOUT FROM THESE FUNDS IS USED TO SUPPORT THE GENERAL OPERATIONS AND INFRASTRUCTURE OF THE UNIVERSITY AS WELL AS MANY OTHER PARTS OF THE UNIVERSITY. ENDOWMENT PAYOUT IS A RELIABLE SOURCE OF CONTINUING SUPPORT AND IS CRUCIAL TO THE FUNDING OF THE MANY LONG TERM COMMITMENTS THAT THE UNIVERSITY MUST MAKE. THE ENDOWMENT MAKES STANFORD LESS DEPENDENT ON OTHER MORE VARIABLE SOURCES OF INCOME. THE ENDOWMENT PAYOUT COVERS APPROXIMATELY 23% OF STANFORD'S TOTAL EXPENSES. STANFORD IS CURRENTLY DIRECTING CONSIDERABLE RESEARCH AND EDUCATION EFFORTS TOWARD ADDRESSING THE CHALLENGES CRUCIAL TO THE WORLD. IN PARTICULAR, IT IS SEEKING SOLUTIONS TO SOME OF THE MOST CHALLENGING PROBLEMS IN HUMAN HEALTH, INTERNATIONAL PEACE AND SECURITY, AND THE ENVIRONMENT AND SUSTAINABILITY. ONE OF THE UNIVERSITYS HIGHEST PRIORITIES IS TO REMAIN AFFORDABLE AND ACCESSIBLE TO THE MOST TALENTED STUDENTS, REGARDLESS OF THEIR FINANCIAL CIRCUMSTANCES. THE UNIVERSITYS ADMISSION PROCESS FOR UNDERGRADUATE STUDENTS FROM THE UNITED STATES IS NEED-BLIND, WHICH MEANS THAT STUDENTS ARE ADMITTED IRRESPECTIVE OF THEIR ABILITY TO PAY; THE UNIVERSITY PROVIDES THE FINANCIAL AID NECESSARY TO MAKE STANFORD AFFORDABLE TO EVERY ADMITTED STUDENT. FOR INTERNATIONAL STUDENTS, THE UNIVERSITY IS NEED-AWARE: STANFORD ANALYZES THE NEED FOR AID AND AIMS TO MEET THE DETERMINED NEED. SINCE 2000, THE UNIVERSITY HAS CONTINUED TO ENHANCE ITS FINANCIAL AID PROGRAMS FOR BOTH ITS UNDERGRADUATE AND GRADUATE STUDENTS. CURRENTLY, FAMILIES WITH TYPICAL ASSETS FROM THE U.S. WITH INCOMES BELOW $125,000 PAY NO TUITION, AND THOSE WITH INCOMES BELOW $65,000 PAY NO TUITION, ROOM OR BOARD. IN FY16, APPROXIMATELY HALF OF UNDERGRADUATES WERE AWARDED NEED-BASED FINANCIAL AID FROM STANFORD. GRADUATE STUDENT FINANCIAL AID AND OTHER SUPPORT IS AWARDED BASED ON ACADEMIC MERIT AND THE AVAILABILITY OF AID. IN THE FACE OF DIMINISHING FEDERAL SUPPORT, STANFORD HAS ASSUMED MORE OF THE FINANCIAL WEIGHT OF SUPPORTING ITS GRADUATE STUDENTS. IN FY16, APPROXIMATELY 82% OF GRADUATE STUDENTS RECEIVED FINANCIAL SUPPORT. THE KNIGHT-HENNESSY SCHOLARS PROGRAM WILL BE AN ADDITIONAL SOURCE OF GRADUATE STUDENT SUPPORT WHEN ITS FIRST COHORT BEGINS THEIR STUDIES IN FALL 2018. THE PROGRAM PROVIDES FULL FUNDING FOR THREE YEARS TO ENABLE GRADUATE STUDENTS TO PURSUE ADVANCED DEGREES AND DEVELOP THE CAPACITY TO LEAD AND BRING ABOUT POSITIVE CHANGES IN THE WORLD. THE UNIVERSITY IS ALSO MINDFUL OF STUDENT DEBT, AND IT DOES NOT EXPECT STUDENTS TO BORROW TO MEET THEIR NEED. OVER 75 PERCENT OF STANFORD UNDERGRADUATES GRADUATE WITH NO DEBT. FOR THOSE WHO BORROW, MEDIAN DEBT IN 2015 WAS $16,417. FOR THE YEAR ENDED AUGUST 31, 2016, ENDOWMENT PAYOUT SUPPORT INCLUDED THE FOLLOWING BROAD FUNCTIONS OF THE UNIVERSITY: INSTRUCTION AND RESEARCH $316,069,993 STUDENT FINANCIAL AID $257,975,598 LIBRARIES $20,416,450"

UHC files a federal informational return each year. UHC files a federal and state income tax return due to unrelated business income. Calendar years 2013, 2014, and 2015 are open to examination under federal and state statute of limitations. e-Care is a wholly-owned disregarded entity of UHC.

For tax positions meeting the more-likely-than-not threshold, the amount recognized in the financial statements is the largest benefit that has a greater than 50% likelihood of being realized upon ultimate settlement with the relevant tax authority. The company has applied the uncertain tax position guidance to all tax positions for which the statute of limitations remained open. There are no material unrecognized tax benefits taken or expected to be taken in a tax return that have been recorded on the company's financial statements for the year ended December 31, 2016.
