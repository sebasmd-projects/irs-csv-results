In June 2006, a new accounting interpretation was issued regarding accounting for uncertainty in income taxes which prescribes how an entity should measure, recognize, present and disclose positions that it has taken or expects to take on its tax or informational returns. The effect of the implementation of this guidance was not material to the financial statements.UHCF regularly reviews and evaluates its tax positions taken in previously filed informational returns and as reflected in its financial statements, with regard to issues affecting its tax exempt status, unrelated business income, and related matters. It believes that in the event of an examination by taxing authorities, its positions would prevail based on the technical merits of such positions. Therefore, UHCF has concluded that no tax benefits or liabilities are required to be recognized.For the years ended December 31, 2015, UHCF did not have any unrelated business income. In addition, UHCF qualifies for the charitable contribution deduction under Section 170(b)(1)(A) and has been classified as an organization that is not a private foundation under Section 509(a)(3)."

For the years ended December 31, 2015 and 2014, MADD had net unrelated business income of approximately $208,000 and $288,000, respectively.

GAAP requires the evaluation of tax positions taken or expected to be taken in the course of preparing MADDs tax returns to determine whether the tax positions are more likely than not of being sustained by the applicable tax authority. Tax positions not deemed to meet the more-likely-than-not threshold would be recorded as a tax benefit or expense in the current year. A reconciliation is not provided herein, as the beginning and ending amounts of unrecognized benefits are zero, with no interim additions, reductions, or settlements. MADD is relying on its tax-exempt status and its adherence to all applicable laws and regulations to preserve that status. However, the conclusions regarding accounting for uncertainty in income taxes will be subject to review and may be adjusted at a later date based on factors including, but not limited to, ongoing analysis of tax laws, regulations, and interpretations thereof. MADD recognizes interest and penalties, if any, related to uncertain tax positions as income tax expense. MADDs informational returns filed are generally subject to examination for three years after the later of the due date or date of filing.
