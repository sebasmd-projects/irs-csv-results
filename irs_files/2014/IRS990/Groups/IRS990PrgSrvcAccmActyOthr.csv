THIS MISSION IS STRONGLY SUPPORTED AND ENHANCED BY THE DEDICATED STAFF PURSUING SCIENTIFIC ACTIVITIES. SINCE 1915, HENRY FORD HOSPITAL PHYSICIANS AND SCIENTISTS HAVE FOCUSED THEIR EFFORTS ON A WIDE VARIETY OF TOPICS CRITICAL TO UNDERSTANDING THE MECHANISMS OF DISEASE AND DEVELOPING NEW, VIABLE TREATMENT OPTIONS. OVER THE PAST YEAR AND A HALF, HENRY FORD HEALTH SYSTEM (HFHS) HAS ENJOYED GREAT SUCCESS IN SECURING EXTERNAL RESEARCH GRANTS AND CONTRACTS. EXTERNAL GRANT FUNDING HAS BEEN RECEIVED FROM THE NATIONAL INSTITUTES OF HEALTH (NIH), OTHER FEDERAL AGENCIES, PHARMACEUTICAL COMPANIES AND INDUSTRY, STATE AND LOCAL AGENCIES, AND FOUNDATIONS, SUCH AS THE AMERICAN HEART ASSOCIATION. IN 2013, $27.4 MILLION WAS AWARDED BY NIH AND OTHER FEDERAL AGENCIES AND $29 MILLION BY INDUSTRY. ""DESPITE THE FACT THAT THE NIH BUDGET HAS NOT KEPT UP WITH INFLATION SINCE 2002, AND THE FACT THAT THE RECENT RECESSION RESULTED IN SUBSTANTIVE FUNDING CUTS, OUR SCIENTISTS AND PHYSICIANS HAVE WORKED DILIGENTLY TO CONTINUE TO SUBMIT GRANTS FOR ALL AVAILABLE FUNDING OPPORTUNITIES,"" SAYS MARGOT LAPOINTE, PH.D., VICE PRESIDENT FOR RESEARCH, HENRY FORD HEALTH SYSTEM. ""WE ARE HOPEFUL THAT OUR RESEARCH ENTERPRISE IS NOW ON A GROWTH TRAJECTORY AFTER SEVERAL YEARS OF STAGNATION."" ALTHOUGH HFHS IS NOT PART OF A UNIVERSITY OR MEDICAL SCHOOL, THERE HAS BEEN SUPPORT FOR THE SYSTEM'S RESEARCH THROUGHOUT ITS HISTORY. THIS DRIVE TO UNDERSTAND DISEASE MECHANISM AND DISCOVER NEW THERAPIES IS MANIFESTED BY THE CONTINUUM OF BIOMEDICAL RESEARCH PERFORMED AT HENRY FORD. THE SYSTEM HAS 80 FULL-TIME RESEARCH BIO-SCIENTIFIC STAFF DOING BASIC SCIENCE STUDIES IN CARDIOVASCULAR AND RENAL DISEASES SUCH AS HYPERTENSION AND HEART FAILURE, STROKE/BRAIN INJURY/BRAIN TUMORS, POPULATION HEALTH AND HEALTHCARE RESEARCH, CANCER THERAPEUTICS, BONE AND JOINT DISEASES, IMMUNOLOGY AND IMAGING, AMONG OTHERS. IN ADDITION, DOZENS OF PHYSICIANS AND THEIR CLINICAL SUPPORT STAFF ARE ENGAGED IN PATIENT-ORIENTED STUDIES. AT THIS TIME, HFHS HAS MORE THAN 1,800 OPEN STUDIES APPROVED BY ITS INSTITUTIONAL REVIEW BOARD, WITH A SMALL NUMBER OF THESE STUDIES ALSO APPROVED IN CONJUNCTION WITH WAYNE STATE UNIVERSITY AND MICHIGAN STATE UNIVERSITY. THE BASIC SCIENCE BIOMEDICAL RESEARCH PROGRAMS RECEIVING THE MOST EXTERNAL FUNDING DURING THIS TIME PERIOD OF GROWTH WERE PUBLIC HEALTH SCIENCES, NEUROLOGY RESEARCH (STROKE, TRAUMATIC BRAIN INJURY, ETC.), HYPERTENSION RESEARCH AND CARDIOVASCULAR RESEARCH (IN PARTICULAR, HEART FAILURE). IN CLINICAL RESEARCH, THE MAJORITY OF FUNDING HAS GONE TO THE DEPARTMENT OF INTERNAL MEDICINE WHERE THE DIVISIONS OF INFECTIOUS DISEASES, GASTROENTEROLOGY, HEMATOLOGY/ONCOLOGY AND CARDIOLOGY ARE LEADING THE WAY. THE INFRASTRUCTURE AT HFHS ALLOWS US TO HAVE A RESEARCH PROGRAM FAR LARGER THAN OTHER NON-UNIVERSITY-BASED HEALTH CARE SYSTEMS IN THE STATE OF MICHIGAN, WHERE OUR NIH FUNDING IS TEN TIMES HIGHER THAN HFHS'S CLOSEST COMPETITOR. IN 2013, HFHS WAS FOURTH IN MICHIGAN, TRAILING ITS THREE LARGEST UNIVERSITIES, AND RANKED 192ND OUT OF ALL 2,495 INSTITUTIONS RECEIVING NIH GRANTS."
