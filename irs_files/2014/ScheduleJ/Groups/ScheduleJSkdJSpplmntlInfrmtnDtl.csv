CONTRIBUTIONS ARE DESIGNED TAKING INTO CONSIDERATION LOST RETIREMENT BENEFITS THAT WOULD OTHERWISE BE OBTAINED THROUGH THE QUALIFIED PENSION PLAN. SUTTER'S PLANS ARE DESIGNED CONSISTENT WITH COMPETITIVE INDUSTRY PRACTICES. THE RETIREMENT PLAN FOR SUTTER HEALTH EMPLOYEES IS A COMBINATION OF SOCIAL SECURITY, 403B EMPLOYER MATCH CONTRIBUTIONS AND QUALIFIED PLAN BENEFITS. SUTTER HEALTH EXECUTIVES ARE GENERALLY INELIGIBLE FOR EMPLOYER MATCH CONTRIBUTIONS. ADDITIONALLY, QUALIFIED PLAN BENEFITS CAPS HAVE THE EFFECT OF SUBSTANTIALLY REDUCING RETIREMENT BENEFITS THAT ARE OTHERWISE PROVIDED TO ALL EMPLOYEES. THE EFFECT IS THAT EXECUTIVES OFTEN DO NOT RECEIVE THE SAME LEVEL OF RETIREMENT BENEFIT ON AN INCOME REPLACEMENT BASIS AS OTHER EMPLOYEES. TO ENSURE A COMPETITIVE RETIREMENT BENEFIT AND TO ADDRESS THE SHORTFALLS DESCRIBED ABOVE, SUTTER HEALTH MAKES AN ANNUAL CONTRIBUTION TO A NON-QUALIFIED 457(F) PLAN FOR ITS EXECUTIVES.

THE PLAN CONTAINS A PROVISION THAT ALLOWS THE UNIVERSITY TO ADVANCE THE TAXES DUE IN THESE CIRCUMSTANCES. SUCH TAXES ADVANCED REDUCE THE REMAINING LIABILITY TO BE PAID TO THE PARTICIPANS.
