Compensation for 2013 of these upper level executives includes the payout of an annual incentive plan and a long-term incentive plan. This performance-oriented program conditions payments upon the achievement of multiple individual and group performance measures. Measures to monitor performance include: operational and financial strength, patient quality and safety, patient satisfaction, advancement of patient care, and people development and partnership. Incentive awards may only be granted if the organization achieves a financial surplus. Even if all relevant performance measurements are achieved, the NYP Board of Trustees retains full discretion to make or not make any incentive awards, or to reduce the amount of any incentive award. This initiative is critical to assuring that NYP has the requisite leadership to create and manage a highly motivated and engaged workforce, to drive superior performance throughout the organization and to achieve top tier medical center status. As a separate matter, due to restrictions imposed by the Internal Revenue Code, upper level executives are limited in the amount of benefits received under a tax-qualified retirement plan. Like many employers, NYP supplements these executives' pension benefits through a supplemental (""nonqualified"") retirement plan. The supplemental retirement plan (SERP) is subject to a multi-year vesting requirement (commencing after five years of participation in the SERP, in prorated amounts through age 65) which places an executive's supplemental retirement benefit at risk of forfeiture if the vesting requirements are not satisfied. Once vested, however, provisions of the Internal Revenue Code require that the vested executive include in current income the value of his or her vested supplemental retirement benefit. Notwithstanding the legal requirement to recognize the vested value of the supplemental retirement benefit as current income, the supplemental retirement benefit will not be distributed to the executive until the executive actually retires from NYP (although, as permitted by the Internal Revenue Code, the supplemental retirement plan will effect a distribution of an amount necessary to satisfy the executive's tax liability resulting from the income recognition upon vesting). As noted, this supplemental retirement benefit will not be distributed to the executive until the executive actually retires from NYP. There are constantly changing legal, tax, accounting, and public disclosure rules for a SERP (supplemental executive retirement plan) in not-for-profit organizations. The Executive Compensation Committee continuously monitors these changes and incorporates any changes into the overall SERP plan design. As in past years, the Executive Compensation Committee of NYP requires a third party complete a review of the organization's compensation program to ensure its effectiveness in terms of government regulations, market conditions and the need to continually elevate organizational performance. The report also serves to meet the regulatory obligations to ensure that all elements of the executive compensation programs are reasonable. The individuals listed in Part VII that are compensated by New York Presbyterian Hospital devote an average of sixty hours per week to perform their responsibilities for the New York Presbyterian Hospital and other related organizations in the aggregate."

CONTRIBUTIONS ARE DESIGNED TAKING INTO CONSIDERATION LOST RETIREMENT BENEFITS THAT WOULD OTHERWISE BE OBTAINED THROUGH THE QUALIFIED PENSION PLAN. SUTTER'S PLANS ARE DESIGNED CONSISTENT WITH COMPETITIVE INDUSTRY PRACTICES. THE RETIREMENT PLAN FOR SUTTER HEALTH EMPLOYEES IS A COMBINATION OF SOCIAL SECURITY, 403B EMPLOYER MATCH CONTRIBUTIONS AND QUALIFIED PLAN BENEFITS. SUTTER HEALTH EXECUTIVES ARE GENERALLY INELIGIBLE FOR EMPLOYER MATCH CONTRIBUTIONS. ADDITIONALLY, QUALIFIED PLAN BENEFITS CAPS HAVE THE EFFECT OF SUBSTANTIALLY REDUCING RETIREMENT BENEFITS THAT ARE OTHERWISE PROVIDED TO ALL EMPLOYEES. THE EFFECT IS THAT EXECUTIVES OFTEN DO NOT RECEIVE THE SAME LEVEL OF RETIREMENT BENEFIT ON AN INCOME REPLACEMENT BASIS AS OTHER EMPLOYEES. TO ENSURE A COMPETITIVE RETIREMENT BENEFIT AND TO ADDRESS THE SHORTFALLS DESCRIBED ABOVE, SUTTER HEALTH MAKES AN ANNUAL CONTRIBUTION TO A NON-QUALIFIED 457(F) PLAN FOR ITS EXECUTIVES.

LONG TERM PERFORMANCE PLANS SUTTER HEALTH ALSO EMPLOYS LONG TERM PERFORMANCE PLANS WHICH ARE DESIGNED TO FOCUS ON LONGER TERM STRATEGIC OBJECTIVES OF THE ORGANIZATION. SUTTER'S LONG TERM PERFORMANCE PLAN APPROACH IS A COMBINATION OF BOTH LONGER TERM MEASURES OF ORGANIZATION SUCCESS AND KEY ORGANIZATION STRATEGIES WHICH REQUIRE THE COMBINED EFFORT OF ALL LEADERSHIP TO ACHIEVE SUCCESS. SUTTER USES A COMMON FATE APPROACH IN THAT ALL PLAN PARTICIPANTS ARE MEASURED AGAINST THE SAME, ORGANIZATION-WIDE CRITERIA VS. INDIVIDUAL EFFORTS. THIS FOSTERS A COMMON PURPOSE ACROSS LEADERSHIP AND A SHARED SENSE OF ACCOUNTABILITY FOR THE OVERALL SUCCESS OF SUTTER HEALTH.

THE PLAN CALLS FOR AN ACCMULATION OF 3% PER YEAR OF SERVICE UP TO A MAXIMUM OF 75%. THAT PERCENTAGE IS THEN APPLIED TO THE AVERAGE OF THE MOST RECENT FIVE YEARS' SALARY FOR EACH PARTICIPANT, FACTORED THROUGH AN ACTUARIAL COMPUTATION BASED ON A STANDARD MORTALITY TABLE. THE PLAN IS A NONQUALIFIED DEFERRED COMPENSATION PLAN, COVERED BY IRC SECTION 457(F) FOR TAX EXEMPT ENTITIES. PARTICIPANTS BECOME VESTED IN THE PLAN UPON SEPARATION FROM SERVICE ON OR AFTER REACHING NORMAL RETIREMENT AGE (AGE 60), OR THROUGH OTHER EVENTS ASSOCIATED WITH DEATH OR DISABILITY. UNDER SECTION 457(F), THE COMPENSATION CAN ONLY BE DEFERRED AS LONG AS THE BENEFIT IS SUBJECT TO SUBSTANTIAL RISK OF FORFEITURE. THE UNIVERSITY HAS INTERPRETED THIS TO MEAN THAT THE PARTICIPANTS MUST BE TAXED ON THE BENEFIT ACCRUED ON THEIR 60TH BIRTHDAYS, AS WELL AS ANNUALLY FOR ANY ADDITIONAL ACCRUED BENEFIT, EVEN THOUGH THE BENEFITS WILL NOT BE DISTRIBUTED UNTIL AFTER THE PARTICIPANTS RETIRE. THE PLAN CONTAINS A PROVISION THAT ALLOWS THE UNIVERSITY TO ADVANCE THE TAXES DUE IN THESE CIRCUMSTANCES. SUCH TAXES ADVANCED REDUCE THE REMAINING LIABILITY TO BE PAID TO THE PARTICIPANS. ALTHOUGH THE PLAN ITSELF IS UNFUNDED, THE UNIVERSITY ALSO ESTABLISHED AN EXECUTIVE RETIREMENT TRUST IN 2003 TO ACCUMULATE FUNDS THROUGH LIFE INSURANCE POLICIES FOR ALL THREE PARTICIPANTS. THE ANNUAL CONTRIBUTION TO THE INSURANCE POLICIES IS DETERMINED BY ACTUARIAL COMPUTATION WHICH WILL ACCUMULATE TO A CASH VALUE APPROXIMATING THE PROJECTED RETIREMENT LIABILITY FOR EACH PARTICIPANT. THE BENEFICIARY OF THE LIFE INSURANCE POLICIES IS THE EXECUTVE RETIREMENT TRUST."
