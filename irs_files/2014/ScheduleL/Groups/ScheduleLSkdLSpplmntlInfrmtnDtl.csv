201443179349303609,210634462,"Schedule L, Part IV","With regard to conflicts of members of the board of trustees, the board policy on duality and conflict of interest requires trustees to disclose all relationships that may cause a conflict. The audit and ethics committee of the board of trustees reviews transactions that may involve a conflict of interest of an officer, director, trustee or key employee. These procedures are designed to provide for independent review of the transaction, determination of the availability of alternative transactions that do not pose a conflict of interest, and preservation of the organization's best interests in transactions where non-conflicting alternatives are not reasonably attainable. The audit and ethics committee makes a recommendation to the board of trustees with regard to such transactions, which then makes a determination whether the transaction is in the organization's best interest, whether the transaction is fair and reasonable and whether there is a legitimate business interest for such transaction. Any trustee with a conflict of interest with regard to such matter may not vote on such transaction."
