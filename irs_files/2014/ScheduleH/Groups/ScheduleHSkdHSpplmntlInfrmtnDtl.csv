201423179349301927,226019101,"PART III, LINE 8","Medicare costs were derived from the 2012 Medicare cost report. The organization's position is that Medicare underpayments and bad debt are community benefits and associated costs should be includable on Form 990, Schedule H, Part I as outlined more fully below. The organization believes that these services and related costs promote health of the community as a whole and are rendered in conjunction with the organization's charitable tax-exempt purpose and mission in providing medically necessary healthcare services to all individuals in a non-discriminatory manner without regard to race, color, creed, sex, national origin, religion or ability to pay and consistent with the Community Benefit Standard promulgated by the IRS. The Community Benefit Standard is the current standard for a hospital for recognition as a tax-exempt and charitable organization under the Internal Revenue Code (IRC) 501(c)(3). The organization is recognized as a tax-exempt and charitable organization under the Internal Revenue Code (IRC) 501(c)(3). Although there is no definition in the tax code for the term ""charitable"", a regulation promulgated by the Department of the Treasury provides some guidance and states that the term charitable is used in section 501(c)(3) in its generally accepted legal sense, and provides examples of charitable purposes, including the relief of the poor or unprivileged, the promotion of social welfare, and the advancement of education and science. Note, it does not explicitly address the activities of hospitals in the absence of explicit statutory or regulatory requirements applying the term ""charitable"" to hospitals, it has been left to the IRS to determine the criteria hospitals must meet to qualify as an IRC 501(c)(3) charitable organization. The original standard was known as the Charity Care Standard. This standard was replaced by the IRS with the Community Benefit Standard which is the current Charity Care Standard. In 1956, the IRS issued revenue ruling 56-185, which addressed the requirements hospitals needed to meet in order to qualify for IRC 501(c)(3) status. One of these requirements is known as the Charity Care Standard. Under the standard, a hospital had to provide, to the extent of its financial ability, free or reduced-cost care to patients unable to pay for it. A hospital that expected full payment did not, according to the ruling, provide charity care. The ruling emphasized that a low level of charity care did not necessarily mean that a hospital had failed to meet the requirement since that level could reflect its financial ability to provide such care. The ruling also noted that a publically supported community hospital would normally qualify as a charitable organization because it serves the entire community, and a low level of charity care would not affect a hospitals exempt status if it was due to the surrounding community lack of charitable demands. In 1969, the IRS issued revenue ruling 69-545 which removed from ruling 56-185 the requirements relating to caring for patients without charge or at rates below costs. Under the standard developed in ruling 69-545, which is know as the ""Community Benefit Standard"", hospitals are judged on whether they promote health of a broad class of individuals in the community. The ruling involved a hospital that only admitted individuals who could pay for the services (by themselves, private insurance, or public programs such as Medicare), but operated a full-time Emergency Room that was open to everyone. The IRS ruled that the hospital qualified as a charitable organization because it promoted the health of people in its community. The IRS reasoned that because the promotion of health was a charitable purpose according to the general law of charity, it fell within the ""generally accepted legal sense"" of the term ""charitable"", as required by Treasury Regulation 1.501 (c)(3)-1(d)(2). The IRS ruling stated that the promotion of health, like the relief of poverty and the advancement of education and religion, is one of the purposes in the general law of charity that is deemed beneficial to the community as a whole, even though the class of beneficiaries eligible to receive a direct benefit from its activities does not include all members of the community, such as indigent members of the community, provided that the class is not so small that its relief is not of benefit to the community. The IRS concluded that the hospital was promoting the health of a class of persons that is broad enough to benefit the community because its Emergency Room was open to all and it provided care to everyone who could pay, whether directly or through third-party reimbursement. Other characteristics of the hospital that the IRS highlighted included the following: o Its surplus funds were used to improve patient care, expand hospital facilities, and advance medical training, education and research. o It was controlled by a Board of Trustees that consisted of independent civic leaders. o Hospital medical staff privileges were available to all qualified physicians. The organization believes that Medicare underpayments and bad debt are community benefits and associated costs should be includable on Form 990, Schedule H, Part I. The American Hospital Association's (AHA) position is that Medicare underpayments and bad debt are community benefits and associated costs should be includable on Form 990, Schedule H, Part I. This organization agrees with the AHA position as outlined in the AHA letter to the IRS dated August 21, 2007. With respect to the first published draft of the new Form 990 and Schedule H, the AHA felt that the IRS should incorporate the full value of the community benefit that hospitals provide by counting Medicare underpayments as quantifiable community benefit for the following reasons; o Providing care for the elderly and serving Medicare patients is an essential part of the Community Benefit Standard. o Medicare, like Medicaid, does not pay the full cost of care. Medicare reimburses the hospital only 92 cents for every dollar they spend to take care of Medicare patients. o Many Medicare beneficiaries, like their Medicaid counterparts, are poor. More than 46 percent of Medicare spending is for beneficiaries whose income is below 200 percent Federal poverty level. Many of those Medicare beneficiaries are also eligible for Medicaid, so called dual eligibles. There is every compelling public policy reason to treat Medicare and Medicaid underpayments similarly for the purposes of a hospital's community benefit and include the costs on Form 990, Schedule H, Part I. Medicare underpayment must be shouldered by the hospital in order to continue treating the community's elderly and poor. These underpayments represent a real cost of serving the community and should count as a quantifiable community benefit. Both the AHA and this organization also feel that patient bad debt is a community benefit and thus includable on Form 990, Schedule H, Part I. Like Medicare underpayment, there also are compelling reasons that patient bad debt should be counted as a quantifiable community benefit. A significant majority of bad debt is attributable to low-income patients, who, for many reasons, decline to complete the forms required to establish eligibility for the hospital's Charity Care or Financial Assistance programs. A 2006 Congressional Budget Office Report, Nonprofit Hospitals and the Provision of Community Benefits, cited two studies indicating that ""the great majority of bad debt was attributable to patients with incomes below 200 percent of the Federal Poverty Line"". The report also noted that a substantial portion of bad debt is pending Charity Care. Unlike bad debt in other industries, hospital bad debt is complicated by the fact that hospitals follow their mission to the community and treat every patient that comes through their Emergency department, regardless of their ability to pay. Patients who have outstanding bills are not turned away, unlike other industries. Bad debt is further complicated by auditing industry standards on reporting Charity Care, many patients cannot or do not provide the necessary extensive documentation required to be deemed Charity Care by the auditors. As a result, roughly 40% of bad debt is pending Charity Care."

THESE ACTIVITIES ARE ALMOST EXCLUSIVELY DONE IN SOME FORM OF PARTNERSHIP IN WHICH THE COMMUNITY OR OTHER ORGANIZATIONS ARE BETTER SUITED TO ADDRESS. HEALTH-CARE ORGANIZATIONS GENERALLY PROVIDE TIMELY AND SPECIFIC RESOURCES TO HELP THESE ISSUES. HEALTH-CARE ORGANIZATIONS CAN BE A RICH AND VALUABLE COMMUNITY RESOURCE IN WAYS NOT TYPICALLY CONSIDERED.

THE RESULTS OF THESE REVIEWS ARE USED TO MODIFY, AS NECESSARY, THE PROVISION FOR BAD DEBTS AND TO ESTABLISH APPROPRIATE ALLOWANCES FOR UNCOLLECTIBLE PATIENT ACCOUNTS RECEIVABLE. AFTER SATISFACTION OF AMOUNTS DUE FROM INSURANCE, CHS FOLLOWS ESTABLISHED GUIDELINES FOR PLACING CERTAIN PATIENT BALANCES WITH COLLECTION AGENCIES, SUBJECT TO CERTAIN RESTRICTIONS ON COLLECTION EFFORTS AS DETERMINED BY EACH FACILITY. ACCOUNT BALANCES ARE CHARGED OFF AGAINST THE ALLOWANCE AFTER ALL MEANS OF COLLECTION HAVE BEEN EXHAUSTED AND THE POTENTIAL FOR RECOVERY IS CONSIDERED REMOTE.

MERCY INCURRED A LOSS OF APPROXIMATELY $7.2 MILLION TO DELIVER CARE TO MEDICARE PATIENTS. THIS REPRESENTS THE AMOUNT BY WHICH COSTS TO DELIVER CARE TO MEDICARE RECIPIENTS EXCEEDS THE LEVEL OF PAYMENT. MERCY BEARS THE BURDEN OF NOT ONLY PROVIDING THE BEST AND MOST ADVANCED MEDICAL CARE POSSIBLE TO THE COMMUNITY, BUT ALSO DOING SO WITH NO RECOURSE TO OBTAIN PAYMENT FOR THE COST OF PROVIDING CARE IN EXCESS OF THE MEDICARE PAYMENT. AS MEDICARE REVENUE DECLINES AND THE COST TO PROVIDE CUTTING EDGE CARE TO THE COMMUNITY INCREASES, THE HOSPITAL WILL CARRY THE BURDEN.

EDUCATIONAL MATERIALS WERE DISTRIBUTED AT VARIOUS EVENTS FOR MOST OF THE NATIONAL HEALTH AWARENESS DAYS - BREAST CANCER, PROSTATE CANCER, SKIN CANCER, DIABETES, AND HEART. AT MANY OF THESE EVENTS, FREE SCREENINGS WERE GIVEN TO THOSE WHO ATTENDED. A PATIENT NAVIGATION PROGRAM PROVIDES AN RN NAVIGATOR TO HELP THOSE PATIENTS DIAGNOSED WITH CANCER TO NAVIGATE THE SYSTEM AND GET THE HEALTH CARE THEY NEED AND DESERVE. FREE COMMUNITY LECTURES WERE CONDUCTED THROUGHOUT THE YEAR AT VARIOUS PLACES THROUGHOUT THE ISLAND - FAIRS, LIBRARIES, SENIOR CENTERS, CHURCHES, ETC. FREE SUPPORT GROUPS WERE AGAIN OFFERED IN 2013, OPEN TO EVERYONE. THEY WERE AVAILABLE FOR BREAST CANCER AND BREAST HEALTH, DIABETES, OSTOMY CARE, STROKE, SUBSTANCE AND ALCOHOL ABUSE AND BREAST FEEDING.

MERCY IS A SMOKE FREE CAMPUS (EXCEPT FOR THE PSYCHIATRIC INPATIENT UNIT WHICH HAS A CLEARLY DEFINED POLICY WHEN ITS PATIENTS MAY SMOKE). ALL PATIENTS ARE SCREENED UPON ADMISSION AND THOSE IDENTIFIED AS SMOKERS ARE ENTERED INTO A DATA BASE, SO NURSING STAFF CAN EDUCATE PATIENTS MOST IN NEED. MERCY INCLUDES SMOKING CESSATION DRUGS TO ITS FORMULARY. MERCY USES PHARMACY MEDICATION RECORDS TO TRACK THE NUMBER OF PATIENTS WITH PRESCRIPTIONS WRITTEN FOR A SMOKING CESSATION MEDICATION. MERCY EMPLOYEES OFFER SMOKING CESSATION INFORMATION, REFERRALS TO SMOKING CESSATION PROGRAMS AND NY-QUIT LINE CARDS AT ALL COMMUNITY OUTREACH EVENTS. MERCY OFFERS SMOKING CESSATION PROGRAMS TO EMPLOYEES THROUGH ITS EMPLOYEE ASSISTANCE PROGRAM AND TO PHYSICIANS THROUGH THE CENTER FOR TOBACCO CONTROL.

THROUGH ANALYZING THE AVAILABLE DATA SOURCES, GMHC'S PRIMARY SERVICE AREA IS FULTON AND DEKALB COUNTIES, WHICH CONTAIN 1.6 MILLION PEOPLE INCLUDING THE ENTIRE CITY OF ATLANTA, GEORGIA, (17 PERCENT OF THE STATE OF GEORGIA'S POPULATION). DEMOGRAPHICALLY, THE AFRICAN-AMERICAN POPULATION CONSTITUTES 53.9 PERCENT IN DEKALB COUNTY AND 43.7 PERCENT IN FULTON COUNTY, WHILE HISPANIC PATIENTS MAKE UP 9.5 PERCENT ON DEKALB COUNTY AND 7.8 PERCENT IN FULTON COUNTY. WHILE THE MEDIAN AGE OF BOTH COUNTIES IS A RELATIVELY YOUNG 34, FEMALES MAKE UP SLIGHTLY MORE THAN HALF OF THE TOTAL POPULATION. SOCIO-ECONOMICALLY, 17 PERCENT OF DEKALB COUNTY AND ALMOST 16 PERCENT OF FULTON COUNTY'S POPULATION LIVE BELOW THE FEDERAL POVERTY LINE(FPL), $23,550 FOR A FAMILY OF 4. NEARLY 37 PERCENT AND 32 PERCENT OF DEKALB AND FULTON COUNTY RESIDENTS, RESPECTIVELY, LIVE AT 200 PERCENT OF THE FEDERAL POVERTY LEVEL. GRADY'S TARGET SERVICE POPULATION INCLUDES THOSE RESIDENTS WHO LIVE AT OR BELOW 250 PERCENT OF FPL. THERE ARE MANY CENSUS TRACTS WITHIN BOTH COUNTIES WHERE AT LEAST 40 PERCENT OF THE POPULATIONHAS INCOME THAT EQUALS OR IS BELOW 250 PERCENT OF FPL. 5. PROMOTION OF COMMUNITY HEALTH: GMHC HAS NUMEROUS COLLABORATIONS WITH FULTON AND DEKALB COUNTIES TO DELIVER PRIMARY CARE. IN ADDITION, GMHC COLLABORATES WITH THE LOCAL FEDERALLY QUALIFIED HEALTH CENTERS AS WELL AS EMORY AND MOREHOUSE SCHOOLS OF MEDICINE. GMHC HAS A NOT-FOR-PROFIT COMMUNITY BOARD PROVIDING OVERSIGHT TO ONE OF THE LARGEST SAFETY NET HOSPITALS IN THE SOUTHEAST AND THE LARGEST TRAUMA CENTER IN GEORGIA. 6.

HNMC ALSO ASSISTS OTHER NON-PROFITS AND PROVIDES VARIOUS FORMS OF NON-MONETARY AID. IN ADDITION, EMPLOYEES ARE PERMITTED TO ASSIST VALID NON-PROFIT ORGANIZATIONS DURING PAID WORK TIME. AMONG THE ORGANIZATIONS SO AIDED ARE NURSING HOMES, BOY SCOUTS, HOUSES OF WORSHIP, COMMUNITY SERVICE GROUPS, BATTERED WOMEN'S SHELTERS, ROTARY CLUBS, POLICE GROUPS, ENVIRONMENTAL GROUPS, SCHOOLS, AND NURSING HOMES.

CAREER DAYS ARE HELD FOR LOCAL HIGH SCHOOLS, FOSTERING ENTRANCE OF INTERESTED AND APPLICABLE STUDENTS INTO THE HEALTH PROFESSIONS. ALTHOUGH HNMC'S PARKING FEES ARE MINIMAL, FREE PARKING IS EXTENDED TO PERSONS IN NEED. DURING 2013, HNMC WAS ONE OF NINE HOSPITALS IN NEW JERSEY DESIGNATED BY THE NEW JERSEY DEPARTMENT OF HEALTH (""NJDOH"") AS A REGIONAL MEDICAL COORDINATION CENTER (""MCC""). THE ONLY FACILITY IN BERGEN COUNTY TO BE SO DESIGNATED, HNMC'S ON-CAMPUS MCC WAS ABLE TO BE ACTIVATED IN THE EVENT OF PUBLIC HEALTH EMERGENCIES AND/OR A TERRORIST ATTACK CAUSING MASS CASUALTY INCIDENTS, INFECTIOUS OR COMMUNICABLE DISEASE, OR OTHER TYPES OF PUBLIC HEALTH DISRUPTION. THE MCC ALSO MONITORED, ON A DAILY BASIS, SITUATIONAL AWARENESS OF LOCAL ACTIVITY. TO DATE, THE MCC HAS BEEN ACTIVATED FOR SEVERAL STATE EMERGENCIES. THE STATE OF NEW JERSEY FUNDED A COORDINATOR FOR THE MCC, BUT ALL OTHER EMERGENCY PREPAREDNESS ACTIVITIES, WHICH ARE DESIGNED TO PROTECT THE PUBLIC AND TO RESPOND IN THE EVENT OF ANY PUBLIC HEALTH EMERGENCY, ARE CARRIED OUT BY HNMC WITHOUT FINANCIAL ASSISTANCE.

201443219349303214,221487322,"SCHEDULE H, PART III, SECTION B; LINE 8","MEDICARE COSTS WERE DERIVED FROM THE HOSPITAL'S COST ACCOUNTING SYSTEM. MEDICARE UNDERPAYMENTS AND BAD DEBT ARE CONSIDERED TO BE COMMUNITY BENEFIT AND ASSOCIATED COSTS ARE INCLUDABLE ON THE FORM 990, SCHEDULE H, PART I. THE ORGANIZATION FEELS THAT MEDICARE UNDERPAYMENTS (SHORTFALL) AND BAD DEBT ARE COMMUNITY BENEFIT AND ASSOCIATED COSTS ARE INCLUDABLE ON THE FORM 990, SCHEDULE H, PART I. AS OUTLINED MORE FULLY BELOW THE ORGANIZATION BELIEVES THAT THESE SERVICES AND RELATED COSTS PROMOTE THE HEALTH OF THE COMMUNITY AS A WHOLE AND ARE RENDERED IN CONJUNCTION WITH THE ORGANIZATION'S CHARITABLE TAX-EXEMPT PURPOSES AND MISSION IN PROVIDING MEDICALLY NECESSARY HEALTH CARE SERVICES TO ALL INDIVIDUALS IN A NON-DISCRIMINATORY MANNER WITHOUT REGARD TO RACE, COLOR, CREED, SEX, NATIONAL ORIGIN, RELIGION OR ABILITY TO PAY AND CONSISTENT WITH THE COMMUNITY BENEFIT STANDARD PROMULGATED BY THE IRS. THE COMMUNITY BENEFIT STANDARD IS THE CURRENT STANDARD FOR A HOSPITAL FOR RECOGNITION AS A TAX-EXEMPT AND CHARITABLE ORGANIZATION UNDER INTERNAL REVENUE CODE (""IRC"") 501(C)(3). THE MEDICAL CENTER IS RECOGNIZED AS A TAX-EXEMPT ENTITY AND CHARITABLE ORGANIZATION UNDER 501(C)(3) OF THE IRC. ALTHOUGH THERE IS NO DEFINITION IN THE TAX CODE FOR THE TERM ""CHARITABLE,"" A REGULATION PROMULGATED BY THE DEPARTMENT OF THE TREASURY PROVIDES SOME GUIDANCE AND STATES THAT ""[T]HE TERM CHARITABLE IS USED IN SECTION 501(C)(3) IN ITS GENERALLY ACCEPTED LEGAL SENSE,"" AND PROVIDES EXAMPLES OF CHARITABLE PURPOSES, INCLUDING: THE RELIEF OF THE POOR OR UNPRIVILEGED; THE PROMOTION OF SOCIAL WELFARE; AND THE ADVANCEMENT OF EDUCATION, RELIGION, AND SCIENCE. NOTE IT DOES NOT EXPLICITLY ADDRESS THE ACTIVITIES OF HOSPITALS. IN THE ABSENCE OF EXPLICIT STATUTORY OR REGULATORY REQUIREMENTS APPLYING THE TERM ""CHARITABLE"" TO HOSPITALS, IT HAS BEEN LEFT TO THE IRS TO DETERMINE THE CRITERIA HOSPITALS MUST MEET TO QUALIFY AS IRC 501(C)(3) CHARITABLE ORGANIZATIONS. THE ORIGINAL STANDARD WAS KNOWN AS THE CHARITY CARE STANDARD. THIS STANDARD WAS REPLACED BY THE IRS WITH THE COMMUNITY BENEFIT STANDARD WHICH IS THE CURRENT STANDARD. CHARITY CARE STANDARD IN 1956, THE IRS ISSUED REVENUE RULING 56-185, WHICH ADDRESSED THE REQUIREMENTS HOSPITALS NEEDED TO MEET IN ORDER TO QUALIFY FOR IRC 501(C)(3) STATUS. ONE OF THESE REQUIREMENTS IS KNOWN AS THE ""CHARITY CARE STANDARD."" UNDER THE STANDARD, A HOSPITAL HAD TO PROVIDE, TO THE EXTENT OF ITS FINANCIAL ABILITY, FREE OR REDUCED-COST CARE TO PATIENTS UNABLE TO PAY FOR IT. A HOSPITAL THAT EXPECTED FULL PAYMENT DID NOT, ACCORDING TO THE RULING, PROVIDE CHARITY CARE BASED ON THE FACT THAT SOME PATIENTS ULTIMATELY FAILED TO PAY. THE RULING EMPHASIZED THAT A LOW LEVEL OF CHARITY CARE DID NOT NECESSARILY MEAN THAT A HOSPITAL HAD FAILED TO MEET THE REQUIREMENT SINCE THAT LEVEL COULD REFLECT ITS FINANCIAL ABILITY TO PROVIDE SUCH CARE. THE RULING ALSO NOTED THAT PUBLICLY SUPPORTED COMMUNITY HOSPITALS WOULD NORMALLY QUALIFY AS CHARITABLE ORGANIZATIONS BECAUSE THEY SERVE THE ENTIRE COMMUNITY, AND A LOW LEVEL OF CHARITY CARE WOULD NOT AFFECT A HOSPITAL'S EXEMPT STATUS IF IT WAS DUE TO THE SURROUNDING COMMUNITY'S LACK OF CHARITABLE DEMANDS. COMMUNITY BENEFIT STANDARD IN 1969, THE IRS ISSUED REVENUE RULING 69-545, WHICH ""REMOVE[D]"" FROM REVENUE RULING 56-185 ""THE REQUIREMENTS RELATING TO CARING FOR PATIENTS WITHOUT CHARGE OR AT RATES BELOW COST."" UNDER THE STANDARD DEVELOPED IN REVENUE RULING 69-545, WHICH IS KNOWN AS THE ""COMMUNITY BENEFIT STANDARD,"" HOSPITALS ARE JUDGED ON WHETHER THEY PROMOTE THE HEALTH OF A BROAD CLASS OF INDIVIDUALS IN THE COMMUNITY. THE RULING INVOLVED A HOSPITAL THAT ONLY ADMITTED INDIVIDUALS WHO COULD PAY FOR THE SERVICES (BY THEMSELVES, PRIVATE INSURANCE, OR PUBLIC PROGRAMS SUCH AS MEDICARE), BUT OPERATED A FULL-TIME EMERGENCY ROOM THAT WAS OPEN TO EVERYONE. THE IRS RULED THAT THE HOSPITAL QUALIFIED AS A CHARITABLE ORGANIZATION BECAUSE IT PROMOTED THE HEALTH OF PEOPLE IN ITS COMMUNITY. THE IRS REASONED THAT BECAUSE THE PROMOTION OF HEALTH WAS A CHARITABLE PURPOSE ACCORDING TO THE GENERAL LAW OF CHARITY, IT FELL WITHIN THE ""GENERALLY ACCEPTED LEGAL SENSE"" OF THE TERM ""CHARITABLE,"" AS REQUIRED BY TREASURY REG. 1.501(C)(3)-1(D)(2). THE IRS RULING STATED THAT THE PROMOTION OF HEALTH, LIKE THE RELIEF OF POVERTY AND THE ADVANCEMENT OF EDUCATION AND RELIGION, IS ONE OF THE PURPOSES IN THE GENERAL LAW OF CHARITY THAT IS DEEMED BENEFICIAL TO THE COMMUNITY AS A WHOLE EVEN THOUGH THE CLASS OF BENEFICIARIES ELIGIBLE TO RECEIVE A DIRECT BENEFIT FROM ITS ACTIVITIES DOES NOT INCLUDE ALL MEMBERS OF THE COMMUNITY, SUCH AS INDIGENT MEMBERS OF THE COMMUNITY, PROVIDED THAT THE CLASS IS NOT SO SMALL THAT ITS RELIEF IS NOT OF BENEFIT TO THE COMMUNITY. THE IRS CONCLUDED THAT THE HOSPITAL WAS ""PROMOTING THE HEALTH OF A CLASS OF PERSONS THAT IS BROAD ENOUGH TO BENEFIT THE COMMUNITY"" BECAUSE ITS EMERGENCY ROOM WAS OPEN TO ALL AND IT PROVIDED CARE TO EVERYONE WHO COULD PAY, WHETHER DIRECTLY OR THROUGH THIRD-PARTY REIMBURSEMENT. OTHER CHARACTERISTICS OF THE HOSPITAL THAT THE IRS HIGHLIGHTED INCLUDED THE FOLLOWING: ITS SURPLUS FUNDS WERE USED TO IMPROVE PATIENT CARE, EXPAND HOSPITAL FACILITIES, AND ADVANCE MEDICAL TRAINING, EDUCATION, AND RESEARCH; IT WAS CONTROLLED BY A BOARD OF TRUSTEES THAT CONSISTED OF INDEPENDENT CIVIC LEADERS; AND HOSPITAL MEDICAL STAFF PRIVILEGES WERE AVAILABLE TO ALL QUALIFIED PHYSICIANS. MEDICARE UNDERPAYMENTS AND BAD DEBT ARE COMMUNITY BENEFIT AND ASSOCIATED COSTS ARE INCLUDABLE ON THE FORM 990, SCHEDULE H, PART I. THE AMERICAN HOSPITAL ASSOCIATION (""AHA"") HOLDS THE POSITION THAT MEDICARE UNDERPAYMENTS (OR, ""SHORTFALLS"") AND BAD DEBT ARE COMMUNITY BENEFIT AND THUS INCLUDABLE ON THE FORM 990, SCHEDULE H, PART I. THE MEDICAL CENTER AGREES WITH THE AHA'S POSITION. AS OUTLINED IN THE AHA LETTER TO THE IRS DATED AUGUST 21, 2007 WITH RESPECT TO THE FIRST PUBLISHED DRAFT OF THE NEW FORM 990 AND SCHEDULE H, THE AHA STATED THAT THE IRS SHOULD INCORPORATE THE FULL VALUE OF THE COMMUNITY BENEFIT PROVIDED BY HOSPITALS BY COUNTING MEDICARE UNDERPAYMENTS (SHORTFALL) AS QUANTIFIABLE COMMUNITY BENEFIT FOR THE FOLLOWING REASONS: - THE PROVISION OF CARE FOR THE ELDERLY AND SERVING MEDICARE PATIENTS IS AN ESSENTIAL PART OF THE COMMUNITY BENEFIT STANDARD. - MEDICARE, LIKE MEDICAID, DOES NOT FUND THE FULL COST OF CARE. MEDICARE'S REIMBURSEMENT TO HOSPITALS EQUATES TO ONLY 92 CENTS FOR EVERY DOLLAR SPENT BY THE HOSPITALS ON CARE OF MEDICARE PATIENTS. THE MEDICARE PAYMENT ADVISORY COMMISSION (""MEDPAC"") IN ITS MARCH 2007 REPORT TO CONGRESS CAUTIONED THAT UNDERPAYMENT WILL WORSEN. - MANY MEDICARE BENEFICIARIES, LIKE THEIR MEDICAID COUNTERPARTS, ARE POOR. MORE THAN 46 PERCENT OF MEDICARE SPENDING IS FOR BENEFICIARIES WHOSE INCOME IS BELOW 200 PERCENT OF THE FEDERAL POVERTY LEVEL. MANY OF THOSE MEDICARE BENEFICIARIES ARE ALSO ELIGIBLE FOR MEDICAID, THE SO CALLED ""DUAL ELIGIBLES."" THERE IS A VERY COMPELLING PUBLIC POLICY REASON TO TREAT MEDICARE AND MEDICAID UNDERPAYMENTS SIMILARLY FOR PURPOSES OF A HOSPITAL'S COMMUNITY BENEFIT AND INCLUDE THESE COSTS ON FORM 990, SCHEDULE H, PART I. MEDICARE UNDERPAYMENT MUST BE SHOULDERED BY THE HOSPITAL IN ORDER TO CONTINUE TREATING THE COMMUNITY'S ELDERLY AND POOR. THESE UNDERPAYMENTS REPRESENT A REAL COST OF SERVING THE COMMUNITY AND SHOULD COUNT AS A QUANTIFIABLE COMMUNITY BENEFIT. BOTH THE AHA AND THE MEDICAL CENTER ALSO REGARD PATIENT BAD DEBT AS A COMMUNITY BENEFIT AND THUS INCLUDABLE ON THE FORM 990, SCHEDULE H, PART I. SIMILAR TO MEDICARE UNDERPAYMENT (SHORTFALLS), THERE ALSO ARE COMPELLING REASONS THAT PATIENT BAD DEBT SHOULD BE COUNTED AS QUANTIFIABLE COMMUNITY BENEFIT AS NOTED BELOW: - A SIGNIFICANT MAJORITY OF BAD DEBT IS ATTRIBUTABLE TO LOW-INCOME PATIENTS, WHO, FOR MANY REASONS, DECLINE TO COMPLETE THE FORMS REQUIRED TO ESTABLISH ELIGIBILITY FOR HOSPITALS' CHARITY CARE OR FINANCIAL ASSISTANCE PROGRAMS. A 2006 CONGRESSIONAL BUDGET OFFICE (""CBO"") REPORT, NON-PROFIT HOSPITALS AND THE PROVISION OF COMMUNITY BENEFITS, CITED TWO STUDIES INDICATING THAT ""THE GREAT MAJORITY OF BAD DEBT WAS ATTRIBUTABLE TO PATIENTS WITH INCOMES BELOW 200% OF THE FEDERAL POVERTY LINE."" - THE REPORT ALSO NOTED THAT A SUBSTANTIAL PORTION OF BAD DEBT IS ACTUALLY PENDING CHARITY CARE. UNLIKE BAD DEBT IN OTHER INDUSTRIES, HOSPITAL BAD DEBT IS COMPLICATED BY THE FACT THAT HOSPITALS FOLLOW THEIR MISSION TO THE COMMUNITY AND TREAT EVERY PATIENT THAT COMES THROUGH THEIR EMERGENCY DEPARTMENTS, REGARDLESS OF ABILITY TO PAY. PATIENTS WHO HAVE OUTSTANDING BILLS ARE NOT TURNED AWAY, IN SHARP CONTRAST TO OTHER INDUSTRIES. BAD DEBT IS FURTHER COMPLICATED BY THE AUDITING INDUSTRY'S STANDARDS ON REPORTING CHARITY CARE. MANY PATIENTS CANNOT OR DO NOT PROVIDE THE NECESSARY, EXTENSIVE DOCUMENTATION REQUIRED TO BE DEEMED CHARITY CARE BY AUDITORS. AS A RESULT, ROUGHLY 40% OF BAD DEBT IS PENDING CHARITY CARE. - THE CBO CONCLUDED THAT ITS FINDINGS ""SUPPORT THE VALIDITY OF THE USE OF UNCOMPENSATED CARE (BAD DEBT AND CHARITY CARE) AS A MEASURE OF COMMUNITY BENEFITS,"" ASSUM"

IT IS THE POLICY OF HNMC AND SUBSIDIARIES' BUSINESS OFFICE TO TREAT ALL PATIENTS EQUALLY REGARDLESS OF INSURANCE AND THEIR ABILITY TO PAY. FOR ACCOUNTS DETERMINED TO BE ""SELF-PAY"" AND/OR ACCOUNTS WITH BALANCE AFTER PRIMARY INSURANCE PAYMENTS, THE COLLECTION POLICY REQUIRES THE SENDING OF THREE STATEMENTS, A MINIMUM OF ONE PRE-COLLECTION LETTER, AND TELEPHONE CONTACT FOR ANY ACCOUNT OVER $5,000, OR AT THE DISCRETION OF THE ACCOUNT REPRESENTATIVE AND/OR SUPERVISOR. THE MEDICAL CENTER ALSO HAS A CHARITY CARE ACCESS POLICY TO ASSURE PATIENTS ARE PROVIDED WITH CHARITY CARE ASSISTANCE AS DETERMINED BY STATE AND FEDERAL REGULATIONS. IT IS THE POLICY TO INFORM ALL PATIENTS DEEMED SELF-PAY OF THE APPROPRIATE ASSISTANCE PROGRAMS AVAILABLE. PATIENTS APPLYING FOR CHARITY CARE ASSISTANCE ARE FINANCIALLY SCREENED BY A RESOURCE ADVISOR TO DETERMINE ELIGIBILITY ACCORDING TO STATE AND FEDERAL GUIDELINES AND ARE INFORMED OF DOCUMENTATION REQUIRED TO COMPLETE A CHARITY CARE APPLICATION. PATIENTS NOT ELIGIBLE FOR CHARITY CARE RECEIVE FINANCIAL COUNSELING FOR ALL OTHER OPTIONS. QUALIFIED PATIENTS ARE REFERRED TO ALL APPROPRIATE AGENCIES OR PROGRAMS TO MEET OTHER FINANCIAL NEEDS. AT THE TIME OF THE PATIENT VISIT, AND AS PART OF THE REGISTRATION PROCESS AT THE MEDICAL CENTER, THE FOLLOWING OPTIONS ARE MADE AVAILABLE TO PATIENTS: - FINANCIAL COUNSELING FOR POSSIBLE ELIGIBILITY FOR MEDICAL ASSISTANCE, INCLUDING MEDICAID AND SSI; - FINANCIAL COUNSELING FOR POSSIBLE ELIGIBILITY FOR THE NEW JERSEY HOSPITAL CARE PAYMENT ASSISTANCE PROGRAM; AND - FINANCIAL ARRANGEMENTS INCLUDING: 1. CASH/CHECKS/CREDIT CARD (AMERICAN EXPRESS, DISCOVER, VISA, MASTERCARD), 2. FLEXIBLE PAYMENT PLANS. IN ADDITION TO THE ABOVE OPTIONS, THE MEDICAL CENTER HAS ESTABLISHED A SELF-PAY ASSISTANCE PROGRAM FOR ITS UNINSURED PATIENTS THAT DO NOT QUALIFY FOR EITHER MEDICAID OR THE NEW JERSEY HOSPITAL CARE PAYMENT ASSISTANCE PROGRAM. PATIENTS WHOSE INCOME FALLS BETWEEN 300% AND 500% OF THE FEDERAL POVERTY GUIDELINE ARE ELIGIBLE FOR RATES THAT ARE REFLECTIVE OF MEDICARE REIMBURSEMENT, AS REFERRED BY THE STATE OF NEW JERSEY.

HNMC ALSO COMMISSIONS EXTERNAL SPECIALISTS TO CONDUCT SURVEYS AND FOCUS GROUPS OF INDIVIDUALS, HOUSEHOLDS, PHYSICIANS, AND OTHERS. HNMC ALSO IS A MEMBER OF THE BERGEN COUNTY COMMUNITY HEALTH IMPROVEMENT PROGRAM (""CHIP""), WHOSE MISSION IS TO EVALUATE AND ADDRESS THE HEALTH NEEDS OF THE COUNTY.

THIS CHNA WAS COMPLETED IN 2013. THE MEDICAL CENTER ALSO CREATED A HNMC-SPECIFIC CHNA THAT ADDRESSES ITS SERVICE AREAS IN NORTHERN HUDSON COUNTY, INCORPORATES THE BERGEN COUNTY CHNA, AND PROVIDES AN IMPLEMENTATION PLAN FOR ALL AREAS.

THE MAJORITY OF PSA TOWNS HAVE AN AVERAGE POPULATION OF 27,500, AND ARE LOCATED IN THE SOUTHERN HALF OF BERGEN COUNTY. OVERALL, THE SERVICE AREA IS 44% HISPANIC, ALTHOUGH THE PROPORTIONS DIFFER MARKEDLY BETWEEN BERGEN AND HUDSON: 76% OF THE RESIDENTS OF BERGEN PSA TOWNS ARE NOT HISPANIC; WHILE THE FOUR HUDSON COUNTY TOWNS TOGETHER COUNT 76% OF THEIR RESIDENTS AS HISPANIC. THE RACIAL MIX OF THE PSA IS APPROXIMATELY 60% WHITE, 22% ASIAN, 10% BLACK, AND 8% OTHER, INCLUDING MULTI-RACIAL PERSONS. CERTAIN TOWNS IN THE REGION ARE HEAVILY KOREAN; KOREAN/ASIAN PRESENCE IS MUCH LESS PRONOUNCED IN THE FOUR HUDSON COUNTY TOWNS. THE BROAD AGE MAKE-UP OF THE PRIMARY SERVICE AREA INCLUDES 23% AGED UP TO 19; 50% AGED 20-54; AND 27% AGED 55 AND OLDER. THE LAST CATEGORY IS PROJECTED TO SEE THE MOST SIGNIFICANT GROWTH DURING THE NEXT FIFTEEN YEARS. WITH THE EXCEPTION OF TWO HUDSON COUNTY TOWNS, ALL SSA ZIP CODES ARE LOCATED THROUGHOUT BERGEN COUNTY. THE TOWNS IN THIS SERVICE AREA ARE MUCH SMALLER THAN THOSE OF THE PSA, AVERAGING ONLY 14,000 RESIDENTS EACH. IN STARK CONTRAST TO THE LARGELY HISPANIC HUDSON COUNTY PSA TOWNS, THE TWO HUDSON SSA TOWNS ARE ONLY 20% HISPANIC. THE OVERALL RACIAL MIX OF THE SERVICE AREA IS 76% WHITE, 13% ASIAN, 4% BLACK, AND 7% OTHER, INCLUDING MULTI-RACIAL PERSONS. THE OVERALL KOREAN PRESENCE IS SIGNIFICANT, BUT ONLY HALF THAT SEEN IN THE PRIMARY SERVICE AREA. THE AREA'S AGE MIX IS SIMILAR TO THE PSA, WITH 23% AGED UP TO 19; 51% AGED 20-54; AND 26% AGED 55 AND OLDER. THE MEDICAL CENTER'S SERVICE AREA IS PRIMARILY SUBURBAN, WITH MANY RESIDENTS WORKING OUTSIDE BERGEN COUNTY IN PLACES SUCH AS NEW YORK CITY. HOWEVER, THERE ARE LARGE EMPLOYERS IN THE SERVICE AREA, E.G., OTHER HOSPITALS, A LARGE SPORTS CHAIN, A LARGE COMMUNICATIONS FIRM, A LARGE PHARMACEUTICAL FIRM, AND A LARGE COMMERCIAL LABORATORY. RESIDENTS OF HNMC'S SERVICE AREA ARE ALSO SERVED BY ANOTHER COMMUNITY HOSPITAL AND A TERTIARY CARE FACILITY WITH TRAUMA SERVICES. HNMC'S PSA COVERS A MAJORITY OF THE TOWNS SERVICED BY THE OTHER COMMUNITY HOSPITAL, WHEREAS THE TERTIARY CARE FACILITY'S PRIMARY SERVICE AREA ALSO INCLUDES MANY TOWNS TO THE WEST THAT ARE NOT PART OF HNMC'S SERVICE AREA. GIVEN THE NUMBER OF SERVICE AREA RESIDENTS WHO WORK IN NEARBY NEW YORK CITY, IT IS NOT SURPRISING THAT A SMALL PORTION OF THESE RESIDENTS ALSO RECEIVE THEIR HEALTH CARE IN MANHATTAN. WHILE THE SERVICE AREA IS PREDOMINANTLY NON-HISPANIC CAUCASIAN, BOTH HISPANICS (OF ANY RACE) AND ASIAN POPULATIONS (PRINCIPALLY KOREAN) ARE THE FASTING GROWING GROUPS. IN RESPONSE, THE MEDICAL CENTER HAS PROGRAMS ADDRESSING THESE GROUPS' NEEDS, AND PHYSICIANS AND NURSES FLUENT IN THE APPLICABLE LANGUAGES. IN 2008, APPROXIMATELY 75 KOREAN PHYSICIANS JOINED THE MEDICAL STAFF, ADDING TO THE NEED FOR STAFF AND SERVICES TO MEET THIS GROWING SEGMENT OF THE COMMUNITY."

Houston Methodist Hospital provided $28.9 million in financial assistance for internal charity care based on the IRS definition of cost.An internal charity care program provides services to the indigent at Houston Methodist Hospital and through affiliated organizations. The majority of patients who qualified for charity care were educated about the program through signs posted throughout the hospital. Other patients were referred by their physicians, hospital staff, other patients and through funded community agencies. Surplus funds are also used each year to strengthen community service outreach to support low-income and uninsured patients to help them attain access to comprehensive health care. Services provided include primary health care, emergency and routine care, immunizations, dental care, psychological and case management services, well child examinations, sick visits, health education, health screenings, well woman exams and in-kind lab services and X-rays.

The review indicated that chronic diseases, including heart disease and stroke, are acute in our service area, exceeding the overall mortality rates in Texas and peer counties. Because stroke was identified as a primary killer and health care issue for people in our region, Houston Methodist in 2006 created the Stride4Stroke initiative to raise awareness about stroke and to raise funds for community stroke education. A 5K Run/Walk each spring allows members of the community to participate alongside hospital employees. Houston Methodist has initiated community education efforts by training and providing nurse-educators to the community for public events, particularly in minority communities and for outreach to women. Houston Methodist also works to assist smaller hospitals in the community in developing their own stroke programs and achievement of Primary Stroke Center status, while we offer a venue for comprehensive stroke care to those patients from community hospitals that are not equipped to offer more than basic stroke care.Another initiative has sought to increase early detection and community awareness of cancer.

A separate Charity Care Policy is in place and would be exhausted before a patient balance would be deemed self pay. Under the Charity Care policy, Charity Care/Financial Assistance is provided to a patient with a demonstrated inability to pay. A patient is eligible for Charity Care/Financial Assistance consideration based upon meeting certain income eligibility criteria as established by the Federal Poverty Income Guideline Sliding Scale, Per NYS PHL 2807-K, this considers patients whose household income is up to 300% of the most recent Federal Poverty Guidelines.All uninsured, low-income patients within St. James Mercy Hospital's primary service area who can demonstrate an inability to pay charges may apply for Charity Care/Financial Assistance for adjustments to their balances for all medically necessary healthcare services, provided that a member, in good standing, of St. James Mercy Hospital's medical staff determines the need for such medical care treatment."

C., Living Centers and the Homestead estimate the amount to be recognized in the consolidated financial statements for doubtful accounts by analyzing specific patient and resident accounts for collectability and also by applying historically established percentages for self-pay and various third-party payers to the aging categories in the accounts receivable aging for each facility.In 2013, the System decreased the reserve for doubtful accounts as a result of the change in its policy for recognizing financial aid for self-pay patients. Specifically, self-pay charges are now marked down at the time of billing versus a separate allowance calculation applied to gross accounts receivable.Other Explanation:Beginning in 2012 bad debts are recorded as a deduction from revenue rather than as an expense.Part III, Section A, 3Costing Methodology:HFMA P&P Board Statement 15, IX. Valuation and Disclosure of Bad Debts, 9.1 has been applied to the amount reported on line 2. The bad debt amount is recorded at the amount that the payer is expected to pay. The amount reported on line 3 is valued at patient care cost, i. e. the expected payment amount included in line 2 has been multiplied by the ratio of patient care cost to charges (40%). Based upon an analysis of income levels for accounts included in bad debts we estimated that 25% were eligible under the financial assistance program.Rationale for including a portion of bad debt amount as community benefit:It is not always possible to obtain sufficient information to make a determination of eligibility for financial assistance or reclassify bad debts as charity care. When income levels are learned we identify individuals unable to pay for services. Having provided services to those individuals we believe represents a community benefit."

We are developing initiatives, and designing our facilities with patient-centered, evidence-based, outcome driven goals in mind. Our team has been working to achieve the best quality care outcomes to keep patients healthy and to develop prevention-oriented programs aimed at creating and sustaining healthy communities. We base programming on areas of health and wellness that matter most in our communities. That is determined by conducting health needs assessments in our communities.Finger Lakes Health collaborates with public health departments in our service area, as well as other human services providers, to use the framework of the NYS Health Commissioner's ""Prevention Agenda"" as a basis for our community health planning. We worked together to conduct a Community Health Needs Assessment (CHNA) in 2009 and establish health priorities for 2010-2013. By drawing upon the state's prevention agenda, studying data collected through primary and secondary research, and partnering with local health departments in Ontario, Seneca and Yates counties, we identified health priorities and subsequent community outreach initiatives to align with those priorities.We again partnered with these agencies and providers to conduct another Community Health Needs Assessment in 2012-2013 and establish health priorities for 2013-2017. After the issues were ranked, we determined the two health prevention priorities that our Community Health Improvement Plans are based upon. Tools used to conduct the CHNA and get them to the largest group possible, included:- An online survey available to anyone in the community. Promoted via newspaper, email blast to employees, Constant Contact email blast to community members on your email list, in our Thrive community health magazine, circulated to 90,000 households in our service area.- Focus groups done in cooperation with our county partners targeting specific populations, including the African American Men's Society of Geneva, a Head Start parents' group, the Office for the Aging, and human service agencies, such as ARC and FLACRA.- Distribution of printed copies of the survey via waiting rooms in our facilities and to individuals without Internet access.- Survey of area healthcare providers and human services agencies via email distribution of survey and promotion at various health planning group meetings in the various counties.Once the survey process was completed, the results were tabulated by the S2AY Rural Health Network, which works with multiple counties in the Finger Lakes. Then, individuals who are part of each county - Ontario, Seneca and Yates, steering groups ranked the issues identified through data review, surveys to the public and through focus groups. The ranking was completed using the Hanlon Method.Priorities determined by the 2009 needs assessment for action in 2010-2013 were: - Access to quality health care- Chronic disease management, with emphasis on cardiovascular health- Physical activity and nutrition educationPriorities, by county, in Finger Lakes Health's service area identified for action in 2013-2017 are:Ontario County: Prevention of Hypertension/Stroke Prevention of Obesity, with a focus on childhood obesitySeneca County: Prevention of Chronic Disease Promotion of Mental Health Prevention of Substance Abuse Yates County: Obesity Prevention Hypertension PreventionDuring 2013, we addressed Access to quality health care by continuing to recruit physicians, including specialists who provide multiple access points to care across our communities.

The organization's allowance for doubtful accounts (bad debt expense) methodology and charity care policies are consistently applied. Below please find detailed information: Receivables for Patient Care ---------------------------- Patient accounts receivable for which the Hospital receives payment under cost reimbursement, prospective payment formulae or negotiated rates, which cover the majority of patient services, are stated at the estimated net amounts receivable from payors, which are generally less than the established billing rates of the Hospital. Patient accounts receivable are reported net of provisions based on management's assessment of historical and expected collections, business economic conditions, trends in healthcare coverage, and other collection indicators. For receivables associated with services provided to patients who have third-party coverage (which includes patients with deductible and co-payment balances due for which third-party coverage exists for part of the bill), the Hospital analyzes contractually due amounts and provides an allowance for doubtful accounts, if necessary. The difference between the billed rates and the amounts actually collected after all reasonable collection efforts have been exhausted is charged off against net patient service revenue. The Hospital has not changed its financial assistance policy in 2013 or 2012. Charity Care ------------ IMC's patient acceptance policy is based on its mission statement and its charitable purposes. Accordingly, IMC accepts all patients regardless of their ability to pay. A patient is classified by IMC as a charity patient by reference to certain financial criteria established by the State of New Jersey and IMC's policy. IMC's charity care policy includes additional financial criteria which were established with the intent of expanding the availability of financial assistance. Because IMC does not believe that accounts which qualify for charity care are likely to be collected, they are not reported as net patient service revenue. The unreimbursed cost for services and supplies furnished to patients eligible for such charity care are determined through the use of cost to charge ratios in effect for IMC, and are as follows: 2013 2012 In accordance with the: State of New Jersey's criteria $ 16,930,000 $ 13,402,000 IMC's additional criteria $ 19,035,000 $ 19,326,000 ------------ ------------ Total $ 35,965,000 $ 32,728,000 IMC also sponsors certain other charitable programs, which provide substantial benefit to the broader community. Such programs include services to needy and elderly populations that require special support, as well as health promotion and education for the general community welfare. In addition, all other uncollectible amounts resulting from the patients' inability to pay, are recorded."
201443219349302734,210634484,"SCHEDULE H, PART III, SECTION B; QUESTION 8","Medicare costs were derived from the 2013 Medicare cost Report. Medicare underpayments and bad debt are community benefit and associated costs are includable on the form 990, Schedule H, Part I. The organization feels that Medicare underpayments (shortfall), bad debt and associated costs are community benefit and are includable on the form 990, Schedule H, Part I. As outlined more fully below, the organization believes that these services and related costs promote the health of the community as a whole and are rendered in conjunction with the organization's charitable tax-exempt purposes and mission in providing medically necessary healthcare services to all individuals in a non-discriminatory manner without regard to race, color, creed, sex, national origin, religion or ability to pay and consistent with the Community Benefit Standard promulgated by the IRS. The Community Benefit Standard is the current standard for a hospital for recognition as a tax-exempt and charitable organization under internal revenue code (""IRC"") 501(c)(3). The organization is recognized as a tax-exempt entity and charitable organization under 501(c)(3) of the IRC. Although there is no definition in the tax code for the term ""charitable"" a regulation promulgated by the Department of the Treasury provides some guidance and states that ""the term charitable is used in Section 501(c)(3) in its generally accepted legal sense,"" and provides examples of charitable purposes, including the relief of the poor or unprivileged; the promotion of social welfare; and the advancement of education, religion, and science. Note it does not explicitly address the activities of hospitals. In the absence of explicit statutory or regulatory requirements applying the term ""charitable"" to hospitals, it has been left to the IRS to determine the criteria hospitals must meet to qualify as IRC 501(c)(3) charitable organizations. The original standard was known as the Charity Care Standard. This standard was replaced by the IRS with the Community Benefit Standard which is the current standard. Charity Care Standard In 1956, the IRS issued Revenue Ruling 56-185, which addressed the requirements hospitals needed to meet in order to qualify for IRC 501(c)(3) status. One of these requirements is known as the ""Charity Care Standard."" Under the standard, a hospital must provide, to the extent of its financial ability, free or reduced-cost care to patients who cannot pay for such services. A hospital that expected full payment did not, according to the ruling, provide charity care based on the fact that some patients ultimately failed to pay. The ruling emphasized that a low level of charity care did not necessarily mean that a hospital had failed to meet the requirement since that level could reflect its financial ability to provide such care. The ruling also noted that publicly supported community hospitals would normally qualify as charitable organizations because they serve the entire community and a low level of charity care would not affect a hospital's exempt status if it was due to the surrounding community's lack of charitable demands. Community Benefit Standard In 1969, the IRS issued revenue ruling 69-545, which ""removed"" from revenue ruling 56-185 ""the requirements relating to caring for patients without charge or at rates below cost."" Under the standard developed in revenue ruling 69-545, which is known as the ""community benefit standard,"" hospitals are judged on whether they promote the health of a broad class of individuals in the community. The ruling involved a hospital that only admitted individuals who could pay for the services (by themselves, private insurance, or public programs such as Medicare), but operated a full-time emergency room that was open to everyone. The IRS ruled that the hospital qualified as a charitable organization because it promoted the health of people in its community. The IRS reasoned that because the promotion of health was a charitable purpose according to the general law of charity, it fell within the ""generally accepted legal sense"" of the term ""charitable,"" as required by The Department of Treasury Reg. 1.501(c)(3)-1(d)(2). The IRS ruling stated that the promotion of health, like the relief of poverty and the advancement of education and religion, is one of the purposes in the general law of charity that is deemed beneficial to the community as a whole even though the class of beneficiaries eligible to receive a direct benefit from its activities does not include all members of the community, such as indigent members of the community, provided that the class is not so small that its relief is not of benefit to the community. The IRS concluded that the hospital was ""promoting the health of a class of persons that is broad enough to benefit the community"" because its emergency room was open to all and it provided care to everyone who could pay, whether directly or through third-party reimbursement. Other characteristics of the hospital that the IRS highlighted included the following: its surplus funds were used to improve patient care, expand hospital facilities, and advance medical training, education and research; it was controlled by a board of trustees that consisted of independent civic leaders; and hospital medical staff privileges were available to all qualified physicians. Medicare underpayments and bad debt are community benefit and associated costs are includable on the form 990, Schedule H, Part I. The American Hospital Association (""AHA"") feels that Medicare underpayments (shortfall) and bad debt are community benefit and thus includable on the form 990, Schedule H, Part I. This organization agrees with the AHA's position. As outlined in the AHA's letter to the IRS dated August 21, 2007 with respect to the first published draft of the new Form 990 and Schedule H, the AHA felt that the IRS should incorporate the full value of the community benefit that hospitals provide by counting Medicare underpayments (shortfall) as quantifiable community benefit for the following reasons: - Providing care for the elderly and serving Medicare patients is an essential part of the community benefit standard - Medicare, like Medicaid, does not pay the full cost of care. From the latest data provided by the American Hospital Association, as of 2012, Medicare reimburses hospitals only 86 cents for every dollar they spend to take care of Medicare patients. The Medicare Payment Advisory Commission (""MEDPAC""), in its March 2013 report to congress, states that beneficiaries will grow notably faster in the next 10 years than in the past decade as the baby-boom generation ages into the program. In addition, the population aging into the Medicare program will present a new set of challenges since rising obesity levels put this population at a greater risk than previous generations for chronic disease. - Many Medicare beneficiaries, like their Medicaid counterparts, are poor. More than 42 percent of Medicare spending is for beneficiaries whose income is below 200 percent of the federal poverty level. Many of those Medicare beneficiaries are also eligible for Medicaid -- so called ""dual eligible."" There is every compelling public policy reason to treat Medicare and Medicaid underpayments similarly for purposes of a hospital's community benefit and include these costs on form 990, Schedule H, Part I. Medicare underpayment must be shouldered by the hospital in order to continue treating the community's elderly and poor. These underpayments represent a real cost of serving the community and should count as a quantifiable community benefit. Both the AHA and this organization also feel that patient bad debt is a community benefit and thus includable on the form 990, Schedule H, Part I. Like Medicare underpayment (shortfalls), there also are compelling reasons that patient bad debt should be counted as quantifiable community benefit as follows: - A significant majority of bad debt is attributable to low-income patients, who, for many reasons, decline to complete the forms required to establish eligibility for hospitals' charity care or financial assistance programs. A 2006 congressional budget office (""CBO"") report, nonprofit hospitals and the provision of community benefits, cited two studies indicating that ""the great majority of bad debt was attributable to patients with incomes below 200% of the federal poverty line."" - The report also noted that a substantial portion of bad debt is pending charity care. Unlike bad debt in other industries, hospital bad debt is complicated by the fact that hospitals follow their mission to the community and treat every patient that comes through their emergency department, regardless of ability to pay. Patients who have outstanding bills are not turned away, unlike other industries. Bad debt is further complicated by the auditing industry's standards on reporting charity care.

IMC conducts an extensive service area physician needs study (by primary and specialty) every three to five years. Specific specialty needs are conducted for identified gaps in service. These reviews inform medical staff development at the medical center to assure responsiveness to identified community needs. IMC collaborates with community partners to plan and conduct health needs assessments to assess and address health needs of the community it serves. The wide-based collaborative partnership retains an outside consulting firm to assess community data and perception. Community data is collected from county health profiles, health statistics, demographics, socioeconomic data, phone surveys, paper surveys and focus groups. From those assessments, community health improvement plans are published identifying the specific health priorities. Through a planned and organized effort, the group works collectively to address the priorities by tapping the resources of the community and collaborating on initiatives. IMC actively contributes to this process and engages in the identified priorities that match its mission, expertise, resources and capacity. In addition to these organized needs assessment efforts, ongoing community meetings with local providers, local health departments, local politicians, organizations and community leaders are sponsored by the hospital to discuss the health needs of the population."

Interpretation services are available for patients needing information in languages other than English and Spanish."
201443219349302734,210634484,"SCHEDULE H, PART VI; QUESTION 4","INSPIRA MEDICAL CENTERS, INC. (""IMC"") is the only not-for-profit healthcare system located in the southwestern region of New Jersey along the Delaware Bay. It is situated in a rural and urbanized area comprised of small cities, suburbs, vast wetlands and agricultural areas. IMC is a healthcare safety net provider of general acute and ambulatory healthcare services in a regional service area that encompasses primarily Cumberland and Salem Counties and portions of Gloucester and Atlantic Counties, covering a patient base of 376,000. Cumberland County has a population of 157,745 and Salem County has a population of 66,342 according to us census 2010 estimates. The population is a multifaceted community of diverse ethnic groups and industry, predominately Caucasian with specific communities home to higher populations of Hispanic and African American residents. According to 2010 us census, Cumberland County demographics are 65% Caucasian, 20% African American, 19% Hispanic; Salem county is 85% Caucasian, 15% African American, 4% Hispanic. Cumberland County's rapidly growing Hispanic population provides much of the county's farm labor; in particular, Bridgeton experienced a 560% increase in Mexican population from 1990 to 2000. The region's economy consists of a strong agricultural base with targeted industry sectors that include healthcare, construction, hospitality/tourism, food processing, glass making, manufacturing, a nuclear generating complex, one federal penitentiary and three state correctional facilities which, combined, house over 8,000 inmates. Of 21 counties in NJ, Cumberland County has the largest percentage of residents living below the federal poverty level, the highest unemployment rate, the highest teen pregnancy rate, and the lowest percentage of population with a college degree. Major areas in Cumberland County and all of Salem County are designated medically underserved areas and health professional shortage areas. Both Salem and Cumberland County have the two highest obesity rates in the state. IMC is recognized as a center of excellence in cancer services, cardiology center of care and bariatric surgery center of excellence. Vineland and Elmer Medical Centers are state-designated primary stroke centers. IMC Behavioral Health Services is the major provider of inpatient and outpatient services for the entire southern New Jersey region spanning nine counties. Patients receiving behavioral health services are primarily insured under Medicaid and Medicare."
201443219349302734,210634484,"SCHEDULE H, PART VI; QUESTION 5","Community building activities undertaken by this organization improve the medical and socio-economic well-being of the communities in our care. This is accomplished through numerous activities which are not a part of Part I Charity Care and other community benefits, and are not included elsewhere on Schedule H. These activities include programs that address the root causes of health problems such as education, poverty, unemployment, access to care, health advocacy and economic development. Economic Development - To help address poverty and unemployment and to take an active role in the regional economy and business outlook, the hospital offers the expertise and resources of its healthcare employees as active board members and participants in community organizations such as the Bridgeton, Millville, Vineland and Salem Chambers of Commerce, Bridgeton, Elmer and Vineland Rotaries and Cumberland and Salem County Economic Forums. Community Support - IMC's efforts to enhance community support networks include both community-based and facility-based initiatives. IMPACT (Innovative Model for Preschool and Community Teaming), a collaboration between IMC and the Vineland Board of Education, provides health and social services, preschool programs and literacy programs, targeting the needs of the low income residents in Cumberland County. Impact Teen Parenting Program provides parenting classes, childcare services, prenatal care and life skills education to teen parents and second pregnancy prevention. IMPACT School Based Youth Services Program (SBYSP), offers health services, tutoring, counseling, recreation and life skills training. The IMPACT Family Outreach Program, through three Family Worker Coordinators, provide training, supervision and support to roughly 40 Family Workers in the Abbott Preschools in Vineland, Millville and Bridgeton. Family Workers serve as the liaison between the child care center, the home and community agencies. The IMPACT Child Care Program provides childcare for infants and toddlers. Inspira's Family Success Centers are a program offered by IMPACT in Commercial Township and Vineland. They are designed to enrich the lives of children by strengthening families and neighborhoods, providing integrated, locally-based services, reducing isolation and promote connections among family and community and providing services in a warm and welcoming environment. IMC plans for disaster readiness above and beyond licensure requirements, including a decontamination room, a dedicated decon team and coordination of mass casualty drills involving different disaster scenarios in the community in collaboration with all first responders to address the major security concern related to the significant prison inmate population of 8,000 during disasterS. Environmental Improvements - The organization's Going Green Recycling initiative at all facilities system-wide improves the environment and helps the community by reducing waste, increasing recycling, conserving materials and purchasing recycled products. Inspira participates in the State of NJ Safe Syringe Disposal program, a community sharps disposal program that provides community residents with a method to safely dispose of home generated sharps. IMC maintains a campus-wide smoking ban at all IMC buildings, grounds and parking lots to improve the air quality, health and well-being of everyone in the surrounding communities. Coalition Building - IMC actively partners in community coalitions aimed at addressing health and safety issues. To address Cumberland County's teen pregnancy rate, which is 3 times the NJ state average, the Teen Pregnancy Prevention Initiative was formed through a collaborative partnership with IMC, CompleteCare Health Network (CCHN) and the county freeholders. SAFE (Sexual Accountability For Everyone), is the educational component of CCHN's plan to bring nurse practitioners into county middle and high schools and expand school-based services to include comprehensive health and gynecological services, peer & adult self-esteem programs, encourage responsible sexual behavior and provide tier-based counseling to target at-risk students. To address the particularly high childhood obesity rate, STEPS for kids was initiated as a collaboration between IMC, The Cumberland Cape Atlantic YMCA and the Robert Wood Johnson Foundation targeting children 8 to 12 with a BMI level at or above the 85th percentile who are at risk for obesity. The 12-week interactive program for children and their parents focuses on balanced meal plans and simple exercise techniques that help families achieve healthier lifestyles. To improve health risks associated with heart disease in our growing population of African American and Latino residents, IMC was one of 10 hospitals in NJ chosen by the Robert Wood Johnson Foundation to participate in a two-year, statewide initiative to improve the quality of cardiac care, share and apply best practices for treating patients with heart failure and communicate strategies and lessons learned to policymakers and healthcare providers. IMC initiated an Extended Care Facilities Forum to build a positive relationship between the hospital, neighboring nursing care facilities and the community to assist each other in offering a seamless continuum of care in light of healthcare reform changes. IMC partnered with the Salem Health and Wellness Foundation to provide digital mammography to the uninsured and health underserved residents of Salem County, who would not otherwise utilize this preventive screening tool until their breast cancer was at a later stage. Community Health Improvement Advocacy - Various levels of IMC staff serve on government advisory committees and boards for national, state and local organizations to advocate for healthcare reform, bring about changes in regulatory requirements, advocate for improved access to healthcare and promote health status for both the broader community and vulnerable populations. IMC is represented at organizations such as the Advocates for Children of NJ, American Hospital Association, Cumberland Inter-Agency Council, Human Services Advisory Council, National Association for Home Care & Hospice, NJ Association of Mental Health Agencies, NJ Division of Mental Health Services, NJ Hospital Association, Salem Inter-Agency Council, Southern NJ Perinatal Cooperative and Voluntary Hospitals of America. Workforce Development - IMC is committed to recruiting experienced physicians and health professionals into our community, which is identified as a medically underserved area (MUA), to ensure that residents have access to the specialized care they need. Responding to a shortage of obstetricians, IMC recruited additional ob/gyns into a medically underserved area. New physician specialties added include urogynecology, oncologic urology, gynecologic oncology and oncologic breast surgery. To promote student exploration of healthcare careers in an area with a traditionally high jobless rate, IMC provides events promoting careers in healthcare and collaborates on healthcare career programs with Medical Explorers and Pinelands Learning Center. IMC developed an Employer Forum for employers throughout Cumberland County to address and discuss medical issues, employee health, safety and wellness of the workforce population."

Premium receivables are carried at original billed amount less an estimate for doubtful receivables based on a review of all outstanding amounts on a monthly basis. Premium receivables are considered past due to the extent that there is no related unearned premium. Additions to the allowance for doubtful accounts are made by means of the provision for doubtful accounts. Accounts written off as uncollectible are deducted from the allowance and subsequent recoveries are added. The Foundation has determined, based on an assessment at the consolidated entity level, that patient service revenue is primarily recorded prior to assessing the patient's ability to pay and as such, the entire provision for doubtful accounts related to patient revenue is recorded as a deduction from patient service revenue in the accompanying consolidated statements of operations. The amount of the provision for doubtful accounts, $21,049,000 and $26,821,000 for 2013 and 2012, respectively, is based upon management's assessment of the historical and expected net collections. METHODOLOGY FOR BAD DEBT RELATED TO CHARITY CARE According to Aultman Hospital's Financial Assistance Policy (FAP), all medically necessary self-pay patients are eligible for financial assistance.(1) Eligibility criteria is based on the Federal Poverty guidelines and are updated annually based on the updates published by the United States Department of Health and Human Services. The FAP discount is based on income and family size. Self-pay balances will receive a minimum of 30% discount and up to 100% as long as the necessary Financial Assistance Application is complete. Patients must cooperate with the facility to provide the information and documentation necessary to determine eligibility. To determine the amount of bad debt expense that potentially could have been attributable to patients eligible under the organizations charity care policy the organization looked at all bad debt balances that were self-pay. From this population the organization identified those self-pay balances that did not receive any form of FAP or HCAP discount. Because all self-pay patients receive at least a minimum of 30% regardless of income, the assumption was made that if the account had no discount the proper paper work was not turned in to determine eligibility criteria. From this remaining population the estimated discount at cost that would have been provided if documentation had been received was calculated by applying the actual FAP distribution of patients who received discounts in 2013 and then multiplying this amount by the cost to charge ratio calculated in worksheet 2. (1) To be considered for financial assistance, the patient must cooperate with the facility to provide the information and documentation necessary to apply for other existing financial resources that may be available to pay for his or her heath care, such as Medicaid.

Between 2011 and 2013, Aultman collaborated with area hospitals and health care facilities to conduct a community health survey. The goal was to gauge the health status and health habits of Stark County residents - and identify areas where Aultman can improve the health of our community. Fifteen questions were included on the poll of 1,067 Stark County households. The survey showed access to health insurance coverage and health care as the top priority; along with obesity and lack of healthy lifestyle choice; other areas of concern were prescription drug misuse, larger need for mental health services, and greater access to dental care."

Payments from these federally funded programs do not always cover the total cost of service. Through its resident teaching programs, Aultman delivers a significant level of quality outpatient and inpatient health care to insured, underinsured and uninsured individuals in our market. For members of the Amish community, Aultman offers transportation to and from doctors' appointments and Aultman Hospital. An Amish House is also located adjacent to the Aultman campus, giving visitors a place to stay when loved ones are hospitalized."

GROSS PATIENT SERVICE REVENUE IS RECORDED IN THE ACCOUNTING RECORDS USING THE ESTABLISHED RATES FOR THE TYPES OF SERVICE PROVIDED TO THE PATIENT. THE HOSPITAL RECOGNIZES AN ESTIMATED CONTRACTUAL ALLOWANCE TO REDUCE GROSS PATIENT CHARGES TO THE ESTIMATED NET REALIZABLE AMOUNT FOR SERVICE RENDERED BASED UPON PREVIOUSLY AGREED-TO RATES WITH A PAYOR. THE HOSPITAL UTILIZES THE PATIENT ACCOUNTING SYSTEM TO CALCULATE CONTRACTUAL ALLOWANCES ON A PAYOR-BY-PAYOR BASIS BASED ON THE RATES IN EFFECT FOR EACH PRIMARY THIRD-PARTY PAYOR.

ALLOWANCES FOR DOUBTFUL ACCOUNTS - ACCOUNTS RECEIVABLE ARE REDUCED BY AN ALLOWANCE FOR DOUBTFUL ACCOUNTS BASED ON THE HOSPITAL'S EVALUATION OF ITS MAJOR PAYOR SOURCES OF REVENUE, THE AGING OF ACCOUNTS, HISTORICAL LOSSES, CURRENT ECONOMIC CONDITIONS, AND OTHER FACTORS UNIQUE TO THE SERVICE AREA AND THE HEALTHCARE INDUSTRY. MANAGEMENT REGULARLY REVIEWS DATA ABOUT THE MAJOR PAYOR SOURCES OF REVENUE IN EVALUATING THE SUFFICIENCY OF THE ALLOWANCE FOR DOUBTFUL ACCOUNTS. FOR RECEIVABLES ASSOCIATED WITH SERVICES PROVIDED TO PATIENTS WHO HAVE THIRD-PARTY PAYOR COVERAGE, THE HOSPITAL ANALYZES CONTRACTUALLY DUE AMOUNTS AND PROVIDES AN ALLOWANCE FOR DOUBTFUL ACCOUNTS AND A PROVISION FOR BAD DEBTS, IF NECESSARY (FOR EXAMPLE, EXPECTED UNCOLLECTIBLE DEDUCTIBLES AND COPAYMENTS ON ACCOUNTS FOR WHICH THE THIRD-PARTY PAYOR HAS NOT YET PAID, OR FOR PAYORS WHO ARE KNOWN TO BE HAVING FINANCIAL DIFFICULTY THAT MAKE THE REALIZATION OF AMOUNTS DUE UNLIKELY). FOR RECEIVABLES ASSOCIATED WITH SELF-PAY PAYMENTS, WHICH INCLUDES BOTH PATIENTS WITHOUT INSURANCE AND PATIENTS WITH DEDUCTIBLE AND COPAYMENT BALANCES DUE FOR WHICH THIRD-PARTY COVERAGE EXISTS FOR PART OF THE BILL, THE HOSPITAL RECORDS A SIGNIFICANT PROVISION FOR BAD DEBTS IN THE PERIOD OF SERVICE ON THE BASIS OF ITS PAST EXPERIENCE, WHICH INDICATES THAT MANY PATIENTS ARE UNABLE OR UNWILLING TO PAY THE PORTION OF THEIR BILL FOR WHICH THEY ARE FINANCIALLY RESPONSIBLE. THE DIFFERENCE BETWEEN THE STANDARD RATES (OR THE DISCOUNTED RATES IF NEGOTIATED) AND THE AMOUNTS ACTUALLY COLLECTED AFTER ALL REASONABLE COLLECTION EFFORTS HAVE BEEN EXHAUSTED IS CHARGED OFF AGAINST THE ALLOWANCE FOR DOUBTFUL ACCOUNTS.

RESEARCH HAS CONTINUALLY SHOWN THAT WHEN THE FACTORS INFLUENCING HEALTH ARE EXPLORED, HEALTH CARE ACTUALLY PLAYS THE SMALLEST ROLE PROPORTIONATELY. A REPORT IN THE JOURNAL OF AMERICAN MEDICAL ASSOCIATION AND THE CENTER FOR DISEASE CONTROL (MCGINNIS, 1996) SUGGESTS THAT THE FACTORS IMPACTING HEALTH ARE AS FOLLOWS: LIFESTYLE AND BEHAVIORS, 50%, ENVIRONMENT (HUMAN AND NATURAL), 20%, GENETICS AND HUMAN BIOLOGY, 20%, AND HEALTH CARE, 10%. COMMUNITY BUILDING ACTIVITIES HELP TO ADDRESS THE OTHER INDICATORS OUTSIDE OF THE ROLE TRADITIONALLY PLAYED BY HEALTH-CARE ORGANIZATIONS. THESE ACTIVITIES ARE ALMOST EXCLUSIVELY DONE IN SOME FORM OF PARTNERSHIP IN WHICH THE COMMUNITY OR OTHER ORGANIZATIONS ARE BETTER SUITED TO ADDRESS. HEALTH-CARE ORGANIZATIONS GENERALLY PROVIDE TIMELY AND SPECIFIC RESOURCES TO HELP THESE ISSUES. HEALTH-CARE ORGANIZATIONS CAN BE A RICH AND VALUABLE COMMUNITY RESOURCE IN WAYS NOT TYPICALLY CONSIDERED. OFTEN THE MOST EFFECTIVE WAY TO HELP IMPACT AND IMPROVE THE COMMUNITY HEALTH STATUS IS TO SUPPORT OTHER AGENCIES AND ORGANIZATIONS IN A VARIETY OF WAYS OUTSIDE OF HEALTH SERVICES. THIS IS OFTEN DONE THROUGH CASH OR IN-KIND SERVICES TO SUPPORT OTHER NON-PROFITS, DONATIONS OF DURABLE MEDICAL EQUIPMENT AND SUPPLIES TO CERTAIN AGENCIES, OR THROUGH LEADERSHIP AND EDUCATIONAL EXPERTISE. THE HOSPITAL CONTRIBUTES FINANCIALLY TO A WIDE VARIETY OF COMMUNITY ORGANIZATIONS THAT ADDRESS THE BROADER NEEDS OF THE COMMUNITY. THESE DONATIONS ALLOW OTHER NON-PROFIT ORGANIZATIONS TO FULFILL THEIR MISSIONS TO IMPROVE THE WELL BEING OF THE COMMUNITY AND CONTRIBUTE TO ITS OVERALL HEALTH STATUS IN WAYS THAT MAY DIFFER FROM THE DIRECT SERVICES OF THE HOSPITAL ORGANIZATION AND MAXIMIZE THE RESOURCES THEY HAVE TO WORK WITH. THE HOSPITAL EMPLOYEES ARE ACTIVE IN EDUCATING PARTNERS ON A WIDE VARIETY OF HEALTH SUBJECTS THAT ADVANCE THEIR WORK. FURTHER, THE HOSPITAL EMPLOYEES ARE MEMBERS OF MANY NON-PROFIT BOARDS TO PROVIDE LEADERSHIP OR COLLABORATE TO ADDRESS COMPLEX HEALTH ISSUES.THESE TYPES OF ACTIVITIES SPEAK TO THE BREADTH AND CAPACITY THAT THE HOSPITAL HAS IN IMPACTING THE HEALTH STATUS OF THE COMMUNITY IN A COMPREHENSIVE AND INTENTIONAL APPROACH."

HOWEVER THE MEDICARE COST REPORT DISALLOWS CERTAIN ITEMS THAT WE BELIEVE ARE LEGITIMATE EXPENSES INCURRED IN THE PROCESS OF CARING FOR OUR MEDICARE PATIENTS. EXAMPLES OF THESE ITEMS INCLUDE PROVIDER BASED PHYSICIAN EXPENSE, SELF INSURANCE EXPENSE, HOME OFFICE EXPENSE AND THE SHORTFALL FROM FEE SCHEDULE PAYMENTS.

THE ELDERLY CONSTITUTE A CLEARLY-RECOGNIZED CHARITABLE CLASS, AND MANY MEDICARE BENEFICIARIES, LIKE THEIR MEDICAID COUNTERPARTS, ARE POOR AND THUS WOULD HAVE QUALIFIED FOR THE HOSPITAL'S CHARITY CARE PROGRAM, MEDICAID OR OTHER NEEDS-BASED GOVERNMENT PROGRAMS ABSENT THE MEDICARE PROGRAM. BY ACCEPTING PAYMENT BELOW COST TO TREAT THESE INDIVIDUALS, THE BURDENS OF GOVERNMENT ARE RELIEVED WITH RESPECT TO THESE INDIVIDUALS.

201433179349301333,160743905,"Schedule H, Part II","Arnot Health, in collaboration with partners from HP2and SHPT, developed broad based plans to address chronic disease as a public health priority, focusing on reducing obesity and tobacco use. Community Health Improvement Plans CHIP from both counties place emphasis on three key areas 1 health promotion activities to encourage healthy living and limit the onset of chronic diseases 2 early detection opportunities that include screening populations at risk and 3 successful management strategies for existing diseases and related complications. These strategies, recommended by the Health Impact Pyramid, are based on the interventions evidenced base potential to address health inequities, the ability to measure success and potential reach, potential for broad partner support and collaboration, and political feasibility. This method is based on findings from such organizations as the Institute of Medicine of the National Academies and their report, Accelerating Progress in Obesity Prevention, Solving the Weight of the Nation or the CDCs, Recommended Community Strategies and Measurements to Prevent Obesity in the United States. For each focus area under the selected Prevention Agenda, Prevent Chronic Disease priority, Chemung and Steuben County Partnerships identified objectives and goals that include improvement strategies and performance measures with measurable and time framed targets over the next five years. The proposed chronic disease prevention strategies are evidence based or promising practices. They include activities currently underway by partners and new strategies to be implemented. All proposed strategies in Chemung and Steuben Counties are supported by the HP2 and SHPT partnerships. Chronic disease prevention strategies will be implemented in multiple sectors, including at local schools, worksites, businesses, community organizations, and with providers, to make it easier for residents to make healthy choices. By planning and implementing strategies from many levels of the Health Impact Pyramid, and through our network of diverse partnerships, we can create an environment that is conducive to physical activity, good nutrition and tobacco cessation. The Chemung and Steuben County partnerships have included many suggested activities from the States Prevent Chronic Disease Plan that will encourage increased physical activity, better nutrition and tobacco cessation strategies that aim toward reducing and preventing the incidence of chronic disease in Chemung and Steuben Counties. Some of these interventions include environmental, policy and systems changes to create communities that support physical activity, improved nutrition and breastfeeding, and tobacco cessation. Chemung County will continue its work through the Creating Healthy Places to Live, Work and Play grant and improve parks and playgrounds, establish community gardens to improve access to fresh fruits and vegetables, and work with local restaurant partners to make eating out healthier. Steuben County will continue to work with the cross county Southern Tier Tobacco Awareness Community Partnership, STTAC to establish tobacco free policies and urge members of the Regional Economic Development Council to consider health in their projects. Both counties plan to pursue joint use agreements with local school districts. Promote breast feeding policies at worksites, and create resource guides that promote the counties many opportunities for physical activity and healthy foods, including local farmers markets, parks and hiking trails. Other strategies include the clinical and community solutions such as provider 51 referrals to Diabetes Prevention Programs, Chronic Disease Self Management Programs and Tobacco Cessation Education. One exciting aspect of the CHIP is the unlimited possibilities offered by technological advances. Arnot Health and other local providers are beginning to implement Electronic Health Records, EHR. When fully functional, the benefits of EHRs will include improved quality and convenience of patient care, accuracy of diagnoses, enhanced care coordination, increased patient participation in their care, improved health outcomes and increased practice efficiencies and cost savings. EHRs will give providers decision support tools and available resources to better prevent and manage chronic disease. Arnot Health is currently working towards consolidating existing technologies within the healthcare system, with the objective of getting everyone on the same system organization wide. Consolidating technology within the healthcare system will improve communication among care providers, and between patients with their providers, enhance patient care coordination, improve chronic disease management and health outcomes. Arnot Health is increasing its focus on population health management and working towards increasing the systems abilities and competencies related to population health management. Areas of focus include realigning our health care delivery system to be more patient and ambulatory centric; increasing patient engagement with primary care providers using PCMH as a model; improving care coordination; and improving the management of chronic disease. Successful consolidation of IT systems will, contribute towards the integration and interoperability of data, and data exchange among care providers. Create robust and functional analytics which can identify higher risk patients to better manage chronic disease and improve health outcomes. Equip providers with the competencies needed to manage health care in a more predictive and less reactive way. Reduce preventable utilization of higher cost health care services such as emergency room or inpatient settings. Chemung and Steuben Counties Community Health Improvement Plans propose training primary care providers to talk to their patients about their weight, physical activity, diet and tobacco use and offering professional training opportunities which include programs on prevention, screening, diagnosis and treatment of overweight, obesity and diabetes. Residents and medical students will benefit from this training through the healthcare systems graduate medical education program. Arnot Healths graduate medical education program is offered in partnership with Lake Erie College of Osteopathic Medicine, LECOM. Another CHIP strategy is to investigate the possibility of incorporating referrals to community resources to prevent or manage chronic disease through a link in EHR. Through the use of new technology, follow up calls can be made to check on patient compliance, and provide the opportunity to document and measure the effectiveness of healthcare interventions. 52 Arnot Healths service area includes two Medically Underserved Areas, MUA. Elmiras Census Tract 0007.00 in Chemung County and Troupsburg and Tuscarora Town Service Area in Steuben County. Poor access to care is associated with a higher incidence of chronic disease, poorly managed chronic disease and an increased incidence of preventable hospitalizations. In both counties, the ratio of residents to primary care providers exceeds the NYS average. Arnot Health, through its Arnot Medical Services provider practice group, continues to aggressively recruit providers for the counties most underserved areas, and expand its graduate medical program to help meet identified needs within the MUAs. As Arnot Health works in partnership with Chemung Countys HP2 and Steuben Counties SHPT to implement the CHIPs, we will continue to identify emerging best practices to reduce obesity and tobacco use. Data measures will be developed to assess the effectiveness of our plans in impacting the communitys health, and set mid-course corrections where needed. Promising cases for return on investment will be shared with policymakers. The specifics of Chemung and Steuben Counties Community Health Improvement Plans are outlined in the following CHIP charts. Strategies, goals, objectives, improvement strategies, performance measures with measurable time-framed targets over a three year period are included in the CHIP charts."

THE TRI-COUNTY AREA INCLUDES THE CONTIGUOUS COUNTIES OF WAYNE, OAKLAND AND MACOMB, WHICH ARE LOCATED IN SOUTHEASTERN MICHIGAN AND ACCOUNT FOR 39% OF THE MICHIGAN POPULATION. WAYNE, OAKLAND, AND MACOMB (IN THAT ORDER) ARE THE MOST POPULATED COUNTIES IN MICHIGAN. OF THE NEARLY 4 MILLION RESIDENTS, APPROXIMATELY 52% OF THE POPULATION IS FEMALE. WITH REGARD TO RACE/ETHNICITY, THE TRI-COUNTY AREA IS 65% WHITE, COMPARED TO A NATIONAL AVERAGE OF 62%. OF NOTE, THE TRI-COUNTY AREA IS 25% BLACK, WHICH IS OVER TWICE THE NATIONAL PERCENTAGE OF 12%. CONVERSELY, THE HISPANIC POPULATION (4.0%) IS LESS THAN ONE QUARTER OF THE NATIONAL PERCENTAGE OF 17%. THE NUMBER OF TRI-COUNTY RESIDENTS IS EXPECTED TO DECREASE BY 1% OVER THE NEXT SEVERAL YEARS,WHICH CONTRASTS WITH THE 3% INCREASE EXPECTED NATIONWIDE. IN ADDITION, FEMALES OF CHILD BEARING AGE (15-44), WHO MAKE UP 19% OF THE TRI-COUNTY'S POPULATION, ARE EXPECTED TO DECLINE BY 4% OVER THE NEXT SEVERAL YEARS. WHEN EXAMINING AGE DISTRIBUTION, THE TRI-COUNTY HAS A COMPARABLE POPULATION TO THAT OF THE COUNTRY AND 14% OF THE POPULATION IS ABOVE THE AGE OF 65. OF PARTICULAR INTEREST TO HEALTHCARE PROVIDERS IS THE AGING POPULATION OF THE TRI-COUNTY AREA WITH THE 55 YEARS OLD AND ABOVE POPULATION EXPECTED TO RISE BY 9% FROM 2013 TO 2018. WITH REGARDS TO EDUCATION, THE TRI-COUNTY HAS APPROXIMATELY 12% OF RESIDENTS WHO HAVE SOME HIGH SCHOOL EDUCATION OR LESS COMPARED TO THE NATIONAL AVERAGE OF 15%. FURTHER, 28% OF RESIDENTS HAVE A BACHELOR'S DEGREE OR GREATER, WHICH IS COMPARABLE TO THE NATIONAL AVERAGE.THE TRI-COUNTY AREA IS DIVERSE IN REGARDS TO POPULATION, RACIAL/ETHNIC COMPOSITION, ECONOMIC GROWTH AND DEVELOPMENT. THE AUTOMOTIVE INDUSTRY REMAINS THE LARGEST EMPLOYER IN THE REGION, BUT THE HEALTH CARE SECTOR IS ALSO REPRESENTED AMONG THE TOP EMPLOYERS IN THE REGION AS WELL (CRAIN'S DETROIT 2012 LISTINGS OF MAJOR EMPLOYERS). THE AVERAGE HOUSEHOLD INCOME WITHIN THE TRI-COUNTY AREA ($63,344) IS LESS THAN THE NATIONAL AVERAGE ($69,637). WITHIN THE TRI-COUNTY AREA, THE AVERAGE HOUSEHOLD INCOME IN OAKLAND COUNTY ($80,157) IS SIGNIFICANTLY HIGHER THAN WAYNE COUNTY ($53,355) AND MACOMB COUNTY ($58,589). AT THE ZIP CODE LEVEL, AVERAGE HOUSEHOLD INCOMES VARY SIGNIFICANTLY,RANGING FROM $25,145 TO $163,374. LOWER HOUSEHOLD INCOMES NEGATIVELY IMPACT PURCHASING POWER, HEALTH INSURANCE COVERAGE, AND COSTS OF BASIC NECESSITIES. AS A RESULT, THE TRI-COUNTY AREA'S SAFETY NETS, INCLUDING HEALTHCARE SYSTEMS, ARE BEING STRETCHED TO THE LIMIT (UNITED WAY RESEARCH INCOME DOWN ACROSS STATE: POVERTY INCREASING AND SPREADING THROUGHOUT THE TRICOUNTY 2006, HTTP://WWW.UWSEM.ORG).

FOR 2013, FOR ANSHN, THE ALLOWANCE FOR DOUBTFUL ACCOUNTS COVERED 24.1% OF NET PATIENT ACCOUNTS RECEIVABLE. PATIENT ACCOUNTS RECEIVABLE ARE STATED AT NET REALIZABLE VALUE. ANSHN EVALUATES THE COLLECTABILITY OF ITS ACCOUNTS RECEIVABLE BASED ON THE LENGTH OF TIME THE RECEIVABLE IS OUTSTANDING, PAYER CLASS, HISTORICAL COLLECTION EXPERIENCE, AND TRENDS IN HEALTH CARE INSURANCE PROGRAMS. ACCOUNTS RECEIVABLE ARE CHARGED TO THE ALLOWANCE FOR UNCOLLECTIBLE ACCOUNTS WHEN THEY ARE DEEMED UNCOLLECTIBLE. THE COSTING METHODOLOGY USED IN DETERMINING THE AMOUNTS REPORTED ON LINES 2 AND 3 IS BASED ON THE RATIO OF PATIENT CARE COST TO CHARGES. THE UNREIMBURSED COST OF BAD DEBT WAS CALCULATED BY APPLYING THE ORGANIZATION'S COST TO CHARGE RATIO FROM THE MEDICARE COST REPORTS (CMS 2252-96 WORKSHEET C, PART 1, PPS INPATIENT RATIOS) TO THE ORGANIZATION'S BAD DEBT PROVISION PER GENERALLY ACCEPTED ACCOUNTING PRINCIPLES, LESS ANY PATIENT OR THIRD PARTY PAYOR PAYMENTS RECEIVED. ADVOCATE MAKES EVERY EFFORT TO IDENTIFY THOSE PATIENTS WHO ARE ELIGIBLE FOR FINANCIAL ASSISTANCE BY STRICTLY ADHERING TO ITS FINANCIAL ASSISTANCE POLICY. WE BELIEVE THAT ADVOCATE HAS A POPULATION OF PATIENTS WHO ARE UNINSURED OR UNDERINSURED BUT WHO DO NOT COMPLETE THE FINANCIAL ASSISTANCE APPLICATION. THE ESTIMATED AMOUNT OF BAD DEBT EXPENSE (AT COST) WHICH COULD BE REASONABLY ATTRIBUTABLE TO PATIENTS WHO WOULD LIKELY QUALIFY FOR FINANCIAL ASSISTANCE UNDER THE ORGANIZATION'S FINANCIAL ASSISTANCE POLICY, IF SUFFICIENT INFORMATION HAD BEEN AVAILABLE TO MAKE A DETERMINATION OF THEIR ELIGIBILITY, WAS BASED UPON SELF PAY PATIENT ACCOUNTS WHICH HAD AMOUNTS WRITTEN OFF TO BAD DEBTS. OUR METHOD WAS TO BEGIN WITH THE SELF-PAY PORTION OF BAD DEBT EXPENSE PROVISION. THE SELF PAY PORTION EXCLUDES THOSE PATIENTS WHO HAD CHARITY APPLICATIONS PENDING AT THE TIME OF SERVICE. THIS COST WAS THEN REDUCED BY CHARGES IDENTIFIED AS TRUE BAD DEBT EXPENSE, INCLUDING COPAYS FOR PATIENTS WHO QUALIFIED FOR LESS THAN 100% FINANCIAL ASSISTANCE. THE COST TO CHARGE RATIO WAS THEN APPLIED TO THE REMAINING CHARGES, TO DETERMINE THE VALUE (AT COST) OF PATIENT ACCOUNTS THAT DID NOT COMPLETE FINANCIAL COUNSELING AND WERE ASSIGNED TO BAD DEBT. WE BELIEVE THIS PROCESS IS A REASONABLE BASIS FOR OUR ESTIMATE. AS WE ARE ONLY CONSIDERING SELF-PAY ACCOUNTS WRITTEN OFF TO BAD DEBT FOR THIS ESTIMATE, THIS ESTIMATE DOES NOT INCLUDE THE IMMEDIATE 25% DISCOUNT TO CHARGES WHICH IS APPLIED TO ALL SELF-PAY PATIENTS. IT ALSO DOES NOT INCLUDE ACCOUNT BALANCES OR CO-PAYS OF NON-SELF PAY ACCOUNTS WHICH ARE WRITTEN OFF TO BAD DEBT WHEN THE PATIENT HAS NO OTHER FINANCIAL RESOURCES TO PAY THESE AMOUNTS AND THE PATIENT DOES NOT APPLY FOR FINANCIAL ASSISTANCE.

MANY OF THESE PATIENTS HAVE SERIOUS PSYCHIATRIC CONDITIONS SUCH AS SCHIZOPHRENIA AND BIPOLAR DISORDERS THAT ARE DIFFICULT TO TREAT, ARE ASSOCIATED WITH HIGH RATES OF NONCOMPLIANCE PARTIALLY DUE TO THE SIDE EFFECTS OF MEDICATIONS, AND RESULT IN CONTINUING EPISODES OF SUICIDAL AND PSYCHOTIC BEHAVIORS AND ONGOING USE OF THE EMERGENCY DEPARTMENT FOR TREATMENT. THE GOAL OF THIS PROJECT IS TO REDUCE THE LOW RATE OF ENGAGEMENT BETWEEN THE EMERGENCY DEPARTMENT AND INPATIENT EXPERIENCES AND REFERRAL TO ONGOING OUTPATIENT SERVICES. IN 2013, A QUALITY IMPROVEMENT PROJECT SHOWED THAT IMMEDIATE, FOLLOW-UP APPOINTMENTS FROM THE INPATIENT PSYCHIATRIC UNIT WERE KEPT ON AVERAGE ONLY 40% OF THE TIME. THE IMPLEMENTATION OF A NEW PROGRAM-FIRST ACCESS-TO EXPAND OPEN ACCESS TO SAME DAY FOLLOW-UP OUTPATIENT APPOINTMENTS, INCREASED THE KEPT APPOINTMENT RATE TO 100%. WITH FIRST ACCESS, PATIENTS FROM THE INPATIENT SERVICE ARE WALKED OVER TO OUTPATIENT CARE BY A STAFF MEMBER TO ENSURE A WARM HANDOFF. PATIENTS RECEIVE AN INITIAL ASSESSMENT, EVALUATION, SERVICE PLAN AND FOLLOW UP APPOINTMENTS FOR INDIVIDUAL AND GROUP THERAPY, AND WHERE NEEDED, PSYCHIATRIC SERVICES. IN FACT, SOME PATIENTS PARTICIPATE IN SUBSTANCE ABUSE GROUP TREATMENT THAT SAME DAY. THE PROGRAM GOAL IS TO ENCOURAGE SUCCESS BY PROVIDING IMMEDIATE ACCESS, STRONG ENGAGEMENT, INCREASED CONSUMER SATISFACTION AND CLOSE FOLLOW UP FOR RELAPSE PREVENTION. THE PROPOSED NEXT PHASES FOR FIRST ACCESS WILL INCLUDE: - EXPANDING THE AVAILABILITY OF FIRST ACCESS APPOINTMENTS-CURRENTLY RESTRICTED TO 10 AM - 2 P.M.; - EXPANDING OUTREACH SERVICES TO THOSE EMERGENCY DEPARTMENT AND INPATIENTS WHO WERE REFERRED BUT DID NOT FOLLOW THROUGH WITH THEIR FIRST ACCESS OR SUBSEQUENT APPOINTMENTS; AND - INCORPORATING PSYCHIATRIC COVERAGE AND POTENTIALLY TELE-PSYCHIATRY INTO THE FIRST ACCESS MODEL. ENVIRONMENTAL IMPROVEMENTS 1. MENTORING AND EDUCATION ADVOCATE HEALTH CARE IS COMMITTED TO GREENING HEALTH CARE BECAUSE IT IS THE RIGHT THING TO DO. CARING FOR OUR EARTH IS STRONGLY CONNECTED TO OUR MISSION TO SERVE THE HEALTH NEEDS OF TODAY'S PATIENTS AND FAMILIES WITHOUT COMPROMISING THE NEEDS OF FUTURE GENERATIONS. BY CONSERVING RESOURCES, MINIMIZING EXPOSURE TO CHEMICALS AND CONSTRUCTING ECO-FRIENDLY BUILDINGS AND LANDSCAPES, ADVOCATE IS MAKING STRIDES TO REDUCE THE ENVIRONMENTAL IMPACT OF HEALTH CARE AND THE BURDEN OF HEALTH CARE COSTS. ADVOCATE HAS COMMITTED RESOURCES TO SHARING ITS BEST PRACTICES IN WASTE REDUCTION, AND ENERGY AND WATER MANAGEMENT. REDUCING WASTE AND CONSERVING ENERGY AND WATER USE HAS A DIRECT BENEFIT ON THE HEALTH OF LOCAL COMMUNITIES VIA CLEANER COMMUNITIES, HEALTHIER AIR QUALITY, REDUCED GREEN HOUSE GASES, AND PRESERVATION OF NATURAL RESOURCES. ADVOCATE SHARES BEST PRACTICES FOR WATER MANAGEMENT WITH OTHER NONPROFIT HOSPITALS LOCALLY AND NATIONALLY. IN 2013, ADVOCATE HEALTH CARE CONTINUED ITS LEADERSHIP ROLE AS ONE OF SEVERAL U.S. HEALTH SYSTEMS WHO FOUNDED AND SPONSOR A NATIONAL CAMPAIGN, THE HEALTHIER HOSPITALS INITIATIVE (HHI). HHI SERVES AS A GUIDE FOR HOSPITALS TO COMMIT TO IMPROVING THE HEALTH AND SAFETY OF PATIENTS, STAFF AND COMMUNITIES AND LOWERING COSTS THROUGH CONSERVATION PRACTICES BY USING FREE STEP-BY-STEP GUIDES AND HOSPITAL-TO-HOSPITAL MENTORING TO IMPLEMENT THE HHI CHALLENGES IN THE CATEGORIES OF LEADERSHIP, HEALTHIER FOODS, LESS WASTE, LEANER ENERGY, SAFER CHEMICALS AND SMARTER PURCHASING. AS OF DECEMBER 2013, NEARLY 1,000, OR 20% OF THE NATION'S HOSPITALS ENROLLED IN THE HHI. OVER THE COURSE OF THREE YEARS, EACH ENROLLED HOSPITAL COMMITS TO ONE OR MORE OF THE SIX CHALLENGES. DATA COLLECTION FROM EACH HOSPITAL WILL SERVE TO MEASURE THE AGGREGATE ECONOMIC, ENVIRONMENTAL, AND HUMAN HEALTH BENEFITS OF IMPLEMENTING OPERATIONAL CHANGES UNDER EACH HHI CHALLENGE CATEGORY.

ADVOCATE HEALTH CARE'S BOARD OF DIRECTORS, SENIOR LEADERSHIP AND ASSOCIATES (EMPLOYEES) ARE COMMITTED TO POSITIVELY AFFECTING THE HEALTH STATUS AND QUALITY OF LIFE OF INDIVIDUALS AND POPULATIONS IN COMMUNITIES SERVED BY ADVOCATE THROUGH PROGRAMS AND PRACTICES THAT REFLECT ADVOCATE'S WHOLISTIC PHILOSOPHY. TO THAT END, THEY CONTINUE TO UNDERTAKE AND SUPPORT INITIATIVES THAT ENHANCE ACCESS TO HEALTH AND WELLNESS SERVICES WITHIN THE DIVERSE COMMUNITIES THAT ADVOCATE SERVES. SYSTEM LEADERSHIP IS BOTH DESIGNED TO DIRECT AND SUPPORT THE HOSPITALS IN THEIR EFFORTS TO ADDRESS IDENTIFIED COMMUNITY NEEDS. IN 2010, A MULTI-DISCIPLINARY TEAM OF INDIVIDUALS AT THE SYSTEM LEVEL HAVING OVERSIGHT RESPONSIBILITY FOR COMMUNITY BENEFITS REPORTING AND THE CHNA PROCESS WAS CONVENED TO LEAD THE HOSPITALS THROUGH THE CHNA PROCESS TO MEET STATE AND FEDERAL REGULATORY REQUIREMENTS. THIS TEAM, CALLED THE COMMUNITY HEALTH STEERING COMMITTEE, MET FREQUENTLY TO ASSURE THAT: THE HOSPITAL COMMUNITY HEALTH LEADERS ARE EDUCATED REGARDING HOW TO CONDUCT A CHNA; SITE COMMUNITY HEALTH COUNCILS ARE DEVELOPED AND MAINTAINED; THOSE CONDUCTING THE CHNA PROCESS PULL DATA FROM RELIABLE SOURCES; SOUND ASSUMPTIONS ARE MADE BASED ON THAT DATA; INTERNAL ADVOCATE AND COMMUNITY RESOURCES ARE MAPPED TO DETERMINE STRENGTHS AND WEAKNESSES; ACHIEVABLE NEEDS ARE SELECTED AS PRIORITIES; AND PLANNED INITIATIVES ARE GROUNDED IN EVIDENCE-BASED PROGRAMS THAT WILL YIELD RELIABLE OUTCOMES TO DETERMINE IMPACT. TO FOCUS THESE EFFORTS THROUGHOUT ADVOCATE HEALTH CARE, THE COMMUNITY BENEFITS PLAN WAS WRITTEN. THE PLAN'S BROAD GOALS AND OBJECTIVES WERE DESIGNED TO STRUCTURE SYSTEM-WIDE COMMUNITY BENEFITS ACTIVITIES WITHIN A STRATEGIC FRAMEWORK. INCLUDED IN THE COMMUNITY BENEFITS PLAN ARE NOT ONLY PLANNED GOALS AND OBJECTIVES FOCUSED ON ADDRESSING NEEDS AS IDENTIFIED THROUGH THE HOSPITAL COMMUNITY HEALTH NEEDS ASSESSMENT PROCESS, BUT ALSO OTHER SYSTEM-WIDE COMMUNITY BENEFITS/COMMUNITY HEALTH PROGRAMS SUCH AS CHARITY CARE. ADVOCATE'S COMMUNITY BENEFITS PLAN WAS DEVELOPED TO ESTABLISH STRATEGIES FOR IMPROVING ACCESS TO CARE AND POSITIVELY AFFECTING THE HEALTH OF THE COMMUNITIES THAT ADVOCATE SERVES. THE PLAN SETS THE COURSE FOR STRENGTHENING EXISTING PARTNERSHIPS AND BUILDING NEW ONES WITH INDIVIDUALS AND ORGANIZATIONS WITHIN ADVOCATE'S SERVICE AREAS IN ORDER TO LEVERAGE AND MAXIMIZE THE IMPACT OF ITS PROGRAMS. ADVOCATE'S COMMUNITY BENEFITS PLAN GOALS ARE AS FOLLOWS. GOAL 1: OPTIMIZE ADVOCATE'S ABILITY TO LEVERAGE ITS COMMUNITY HEALTH RESOURCES AND CONTINUE PROGRAMS THAT BENEFIT THE COMMUNITY BY PROSPECTIVELY ALIGNING SYSTEM AND SITE PLANS AND ACTIVITIES. IN ORDER TO ASSURE ALIGNMENT BETWEEN SITE AND SYSTEM GOALS, QUALITY AND CONSISTENCY AMONGST THE HOSPITALS' CHNAS AND TO LEVERAGE THE HOSPITALS' STAFF TIME AND CHNA EFFORTS, THE SYSTEM LEVEL COMMUNITY HEALTH STEERING COMMITTEE PROVIDED A STANDARDIZED CHNA PROCESS, TOOLS, EDUCATION AND STRUCTURE. SPECIFIC EXAMPLES OF THE SUPPORT PROVIDED BY THE STEERING COMMITTEE TO ENABLE THE HOSPITALS TO REALIZE THEIR COMMUNITY HEALTH GOALS AND OBJECTIVES ARE AS FOLLOWS. - A STANDARDIZED CHNA PROCESS THAT INCLUDED DEVELOPMENT OF A COMMUNITY HEALTH COUNCIL AT EACH HOSPITAL WITH BOTH HOSPITAL AND COMMUNITY REPRESENTATION. THE COUNCILS WERE CHARGED WITH MANAGING THEIR SITE'S ASSESSMENT, EXAMINING DATA, SITE AND COMMUNITY RESOURCES, SELECTING KEY PRIORITIES TO ADDRESS AND DEVELOPING A COMMUNITY HEALTH PLAN. - PURCHASE OF AND INSTRUCTION ON HOW TO USE SURVEY RESULTS AND THE ASSESSMENT TOOL DEVELOPED BY PROFESSIONAL RESEARCH CONSULTANTS. - LED A SERIES OF WORKSHOPS OVER THREE YEARS WITH INTERNAL AND EXTERNAL SPEAKERS PROFICIENT IN CHNAS, IDENTIFYING RELIABLE DATA SOURCES, PRIORITY SETTING, AND SELECTING EVIDENCE-BASED INTERVENTIONS. - SET THE COMMUNITY HEALTH LEADERSHIP COUNCIL'S AGENDAS, A COUNCIL COMPRISED OF COMMUNITY HEALTH STAKEHOLDERS FROM ACROSS ADVOCATE, TO FOCUS ON CHNA OBJECTIVES. - MANAGED HOSPITAL PROGRESS AGAINST SYSTEM ANNUAL TIMELINES TO ACHIEVE THE THREE-YEAR VISION, REQUIRING ANNUAL CHNA PROGRESS REPORTS AND THEIR REVIEW AND ENDORSEMENT BY THE HOSPITAL GOVERNING COUNCILS EACH YEAR. - PROVIDED ONGOING CONSULTATION ON AN AS NEED BASIS THROUGHOUT THE PROCESS. - ENGAGED AND FUNDED AN OUTSIDE CHNA CONSULTANT TO MEET ONE-ON-ONE WITH THE SITE COMMUNITY HEALTH LEADERS AND REVIEW CHNA PROGRESS AND PROVIDE GUIDANCE IN AREAS OF DIFFICULTY OR UNCERTAINTY. - PROVIDED AN OVERVIEW OF THE CHNA RESULTS AND PLANNED INTERVENTIONS TO THE MISSION & SPIRITUAL COMMITTEE OF THE ADVOCATE HEALTH CARE BOARD OF DIRECTORS TO SECURE THE COMMITTEE'S ENDORSEMENT. - A STANDARDIZED FORMAT FOR HOSPITALS TO USE IN DRAFTING THEIR CHNAS AND IMPLEMENTATION PLANS, WHICH SYSTEM LEADERS THEN REVIEWED AND EDITED FOR CONSISTENCY, ACCURACY AND QUALITY OF CONTENT. - WORKED WITH SYSTEM LEVEL MEDIA CENTER AND WEB TEAM TO DEVELOP PLACEMENT AND POSTING OF CHNA REPORTS & IMPLEMENTATION PLANS TO MEET PPACA/IRS REGULATORY REPORTING REQUIREMENTS. - IN PREPARATION FOR THE NEXT CHNA CYCLE, PURCHASED THE HEALTHY COMMUNITIES INSTITUTE'S CHNA TOOL IN LATE 2013 TO SUPPORT THE SITES IN CONDUCTING THEIR NEXT CHNA WHILE AT THE SAME TIME MONITORING OUTCOMES OF PLANNED INTERVENTIONS IMPLEMENTED AS A RESULT OF ADVOCATE'S FIRST (2011-2013) CHNA. THROUGH ADVOCATE'S HOSPITAL-BASED SERVICES, AS WELL AS ITS PARTICIPATION IN PROVIDING PROGRAMS AND SERVICES IN THE COMMUNITY, ADVOCATE PROMOTES A SHARED APPROACH TO COMMUNITY BENEFITS. IN ADDITION TO HOSPITAL/COMMUNITY SPECIFIC PROGRAMS, THERE ARE ALSO PROGRAMS ADDRESSING NEEDS OF BROAD GEOGRAPHIC PORTIONS OF ADVOCATE'S SERVICE AREA WHICH ARE MANAGED AND FUNDED AT THE SYSTEM LEVEL. THESE PROGRAMS INCLUDE THE FOLLOWING. IN 2013, ADVOCATE HEALTHY STEPS SPECIALISTS TOUCHED THE LIVES OF 6,688 YOUNG CHILDREN THROUGH CHILDHOOD PROGRAMS WITHIN PEDIATRIC/FAMILY PRACTICE RESIDENCIES AT ADVOCATE ILLINOIS MASONIC MEDICAL CENTER, AND ADVOCATE CHILDREN'S HOSPITAL OAK LAWN AND PARK RIDGE CAMPUSES. THIS SYSTEM-WIDE PROGRAM USES A NATIONAL MODEL TO ENGAGE PARENTS AS PARTNERS WITH PHYSICIANS IN THEIR CHILDREN'S HEALTH. HEALTHY STEPS SPECIALISTS HELP BRIDGE THE TWO GROUPS BY PREPARING PARENTS TO TAKE AN ACTIVE ROLE IN, AND PHYSICIANS TO ASSESS AND MEET MORE EFFECTIVELY, A RANGE OF CHILD DEVELOPMENT NEEDS. IN 2013, 9,749 DEVELOPMENTAL SCREENINGS WERE PROVIDED AND 445 FAMILIES WERE REFERRED TO COMMUNITY SERVICES FOR FOLLOW UP. IN ADDITION, HEALTHY STEPS HAS COMPLETED AN INITIATIVE, IN COLLABORATION WITH THE ILLINOIS CHAPTER OF THE AMERICAN ACADEMY OF PEDIATRICS, TO TRAIN PRIMARY CARE PROVIDERS ACROSS THE STATE TO IMPROVE PREVENTIVE PRACTICES IN THEIR SITE AROUND TOPICS SUCH AS USE OF VALIDATED TOOLS FOR DEVELOPMENTAL AND FAMILY RISK FACTOR SCREENINGS (SUCH AS POSTPARTUM DEPRESSION, DOMESTIC VIOLENCE, TRAUMA, AND PSYCHOSOCIAL ISSUES) AND TEACH PRIMARY CARE PROVIDERS AND THEIR STAFF HOW TO REFER TO LOCAL COMMUNITY RESOURCES FOR FOLLOW-UP CARE. DURING 2013, ADVOCATE HEALTHY STEPS CONSULTANTS PROVIDED 179 PRESENTATIONS IN 57 PRIMARY CARE SITES, TO 740 PHYSICIANS AND THEIR STAFFS THROUGHOUT THE STATE OF ILLINOIS. THESE PROVIDERS CARE FOR APPROXIMATELY 154,835 CHILDREN BETWEEN BIRTH AND AGE THREE. CURRENTLY, HEALTHY STEPS IS FOCUSING ON DEVELOPMENTAL BEHAVIORAL MENTAL HEALTH TRAINING FOR PRIMARY CARE PROVIDERS. THE STAFF ALSO MEETS REGULARLY WITH APPROXIMATELY 20 COMMUNITY ORGANIZATIONS, AND WORK WITH PEDIATRIC AND FAMILY MEDICINE RESIDENCY PROGRAMS, PEDIATRIC NURSE PRACTITIONERS AND PHYSICIAN ASSISTANT PROGRAMS THROUGHOUT THE STATE. THE ADVOCATE CHILDHOOD TRAUMA TREATMENT PROGRAM (CTTP), A SYSTEM LEVEL, SYSTEM-WIDE INITIATIVE, OFFERS HOPE AND HEALING TO CHILDREN WHO HAVE EXPERIENCED MALTREATMENT, PSYCHOLOGICAL TRAUMA AND SEXUAL ABUSE. CLINICIANS WORK WITH A CHILD'S ENTIRE SUPPORT NETWORK - PARENTS, THE SCHOOL AND MORE - TO HELP FOSTER A SAFE ENVIRONMENT FOR THE CHILD. CTTP IS ONE OF JUST A HANDFUL OF PROGRAMS IN THE STATE THAT SPECIALIZES IN MENTAL HEALTH FOR CHILDREN. IN 2013, CTTP SERVED 171 CHILDREN AND ADOLESCENTS, AS WELL AS 420 ADULTS, CAREGIVERS, PARENTS AND OTHERS. IN ADDITION, THE PROGRAM HAS PARTNERED WITH ""DARKNESS TO LIGHT,"" A NATIONALLY RECOGNIZED CHILD SEXUAL ABUSE PREVENTION LEADER. AS A RESULT OF THIS PARTNERSHIP, THE CTTP HAS LAUNCHED A MAJOR ADULT EDUCATION PROGRAM CALLED ""STEWARDS OF CHILDREN/7 STEPS TO PROTECT A CHILD."" THIS PROGRAM HAS EDUCATED OVER 1,400 ADULTS AT SCHOOLS, CHURCHES, LAW ENFORCEMENT AGENCIES, CHILD WELFARE AGENCIES AND CIVIC ORGANIZATIONS, THEREBY BETTER PROTECTING 14,000 CHILDREN.

201413169349300106,570828733,"Part VI, Line 2:","Roper St. Francis Healthcare identified community health needs by undergoing an assessment process in 2013 that complies with IRS Section 501(r). The Needs Assessment is posted on our website: http://www.rsfh.com/About_Us/Mission_and_Community_Activities/Needs_Assessment.aspx and we invite the community to review and respond to this document so that our collaborative efforts can make living in our community more enjoyable and healthier.As allowed by IRS guidelines, Roper St. Francis Healthcare decided to produce a joint CHNA report in collaboration with its three Charleston area hospitals as those facilities define their communities to be the same. Each hospital files a Schedule H and has a customized implementation plan attached.The community needs assessment process consists of 5 steps: data assessment, community input, prioritization and implementation strategy, reporting, and monitoring. In the data assessment step, service areas were defined, external data research was completed and key findings were summarized. Interviews were conducted with persons with special knowledge of public health, hospital personnel, local organizations, and community outreach advocates. Our service area for this assessment is defined as the Tri-County area of Charleston, Berkeley, and Dorchester Counties. We used the following sources in the data assessment process: Nielson Claritas, 2012 County Health Rankings, Health Indicators Warehouse, The Advisory Board Company, Kids Count Data Center, Truven Health Analytics, and the USDA. Data from these sources was used to identify at-risk populations, underserved populations, health need areas, and professional shortage areas. See the answer to Schedule H, Part VI, question 4 for a description of the community served.Subsequent to the data assessment step, the Community Needs Assessment Team entered into dialogue with key hospital administrators, physicians, those with knowledge/expertise in public health, and those serving underserved and chronic disease populations. During the community input phase, the team conducted face-to-face interviews, phone interviews, and surveys in which respondents were able to comment and discuss general community health issues of their specific service area. Through these numerous interviews and surveys, a summary of community input was created. This summary would eventually be used to help focus in on priorities and ultimately, implementation strategies. Respondents who participated in this phase included experts in the field of public health, hospital administration members, community outreach groups, and other local organizations. Respondents included Dana Millet, Director of DHEC Lowcountry Region, Joseph Chambers, MD; Public Health expert and consultant, Thaddeus Bell, MD; with Closing the Gap in Healthcare. Other respondents were from focus groups in the Charleston Promise Neighborhood (North Charleston), East Cooper Community Outreach (Mt. Pleasant), Neighborhood House (Charleston), and Our Lady of Mercy Outreach Center (Johns Island). Collection and analysis of results from the CHNA data assessment, survey, interviews, and focus groups provided a strong foundation for identifying health needs and service gaps. In June 2013, Roper St. Francis Healthcare held multiple sessions with leading stakeholders to assess initial findings and establish priorities. These various constituents included representatives from the Medical University of South Carolinas strategic planning team, leadership of Trident United Way's Health Council and 2-1-1 program, experts from Joseph P. Riley Jr. Center for Livable Communities at the College of Charleston, and public health consultants. Twelve priority areas of need emerged for the Tri-County service area. As part of the prioritization process, Roper St. Francis Healthcare conducted an inventory of existing system-based outreach programs, community partnerships, and other collaborative resources that currently address each of the priority areas:1)Access to Services for Uninsured and Underinsured: Access Health Tri-county Network; RSF Financial Assistance Policy and Patient Financial Services staff to assist; partnerships with Free Clinics such as Barrier Island Free Medical Clinic, Our Lady of Mercy Outreach and Crisis Ministries; new RSF Mt.

This implementation plan (attached) will be rolled out over the next 3 years. Strategies are be clearly defined with a matrix of which areas each RSFH hospital will address. Some strategies may be addressed by more than one RSFH hospital or the system as a whole. The team will develop a monitoring method to provide status and results of these efforts to improve community health. RSFH is committed to conducting another health needs assessment in three years.The Community Health Needs Assessment for fiscal December 31, 2013 was approved by the Board of Directors at its meeting held on October 12, 2013."

201433169349302318,131740127,"PART III, LINE 4:","A SUMMARY OF THE PROCESS FOR ESTIMATING THE ULTIMATE COLLECTION OF RECEIVABLES INVOLVES SIGNIFICANT ASSUMPTIONS AND JUDGMENTS. THE HOSPITALS HAVE IMPLEMENTED A MONTHLY STANDARDIZED APPROACH TO ESTIMATE AND REVIEW THE COLLECTIBILITY OF RECEIVABLES BASED ON THE PAYER CLASSIFICATION AND THE PERIOD THE RECEIVABLES HAVE BEEN OUTSTANDING. PAST DUE BALANCES OVER 90 DAYS FROM THE DATE OF BILLING AND OVER A SPECIFIED AMOUNT ARE CONSIDERED DELINQUENT AND ARE REVIEWED INDIVIDUALLY FOR COLLECTABILITY. ACCOUNT BALANCES ARE WRITTEN OFF AGAINST THE ALLOWANCE WHEN MANAGEMENT FEELS IT IS PROBABLE THE RECEIVABLES WILL NOT BE RECOVERED. HISTORICAL COLLECTION AND PAYER REIMBURSEMENT EXPERIENCE IS AN INTEGRAL PART OF THE ESTIMATION PROCESS RELATED TO RESERVES FOR DOUBTFUL ACCOUNTS. IN ADDITION, THE HOSPITALS ASSESS THE CURRENT STATE OF ITS BILLING FUNCTIONS IN ORDER TO IDENTIFY ANY KNOWN COLLECTION OR REIMBURSEMENT ISSUES IN ORDER TO ASSESS THE IMPACT, IF ANY, ON RESERVE ESTIMATES, WHICH INVOLVES JUDGMENT. THE HOSPITALS BELIEVE THAT THE COLLECTABILITY OF ITS RECEIVABLES IS DIRECTLY LINKED TO THE QUALITY OF ITS BILLING PROCESSES, MOST NOTABLY THOSE RELATED TO OBTAINING THE CORRECT INFORMATION IN ORDER TO BILL EFFECTIVELY FOR THE SERVICES PROVIDED. REVISIONS IN RESERVE FOR DOUBTFUL ACCOUNTS ESTIMATES ARE RECORDED AS AN ADJUSTMENT TO PROVISION FOR BAD DEBTS. A SUMMARY OF THE PAYMENT ARRANGEMENTS WITH MAJOR THIRD-PARTY PAYERS FOLLOWS: 1) MEDICARE PAYMENTS. INPATIENT ACUTE CARE SERVICES AND OUTPATIENT SERVICES RENDERED TO MEDICARE PROGRAM BENEFICIARIES ARE PAID AT PROSPECTIVELY DETERMINED RATES. THESE RATES VARY ACCORDING TO A PATIENT CLASSIFICATION SYSTEM THAT IS BASED ON CLINICAL, DIAGNOSTIC, AND OTHER FACTORS. EFFECTIVE OCTOBER 1, 2007, THE CENTERS FOR MEDICARE AND MEDICAID SERVICES (CMS) REVISED THE MEDICARE PATIENT CLASSIFICATION SYSTEM. THE NEW MEDICARE SEVERITY ADJUSTED DIAGNOSIS RELATED GROUPS (MS-DRGS) REFLECT CHANGES IN TECHNOLOGY AND CURRENT METHODS OF CARE DELIVERY. CMS HAS EXPANDED THE NUMBER OF DRGS FROM 538 TO 989 AND REQUIRES IDENTIFICATION OF CONDITIONS THAT ARE PRESENT UPON ADMISSION. 2) NON-MEDICARE PAYMENTS. THE NEW YORK HEALTH CARE REFORM ACT OF 1996, AS UPDATED, GOVERNS PAYMENTS TO HOSPITALS IN NEW YORK STATE UNDER THIS SYSTEM, HOSPITALS AND ALL NON-MEDICARE PAYERS (EXCEPT MEDICAID, WORKERS' COMPENSATION AND NO-FAULT INSURANCE PROGRAMS) BY NEGOTIATING THE HOSPITAL'S PAYMENT RATES. IF NEGOTIATED RATES ARE NOT ESTABLISHED, PAYERS ARE BILLED AT HOSPITALS ESTABLISHED CHARGES. MEDICAID, WORKER'S COMPENSATION AND NO-FAULT PAYERS PAY HOSPITAL RATES PROMULGATED BY THE NEW YORK STATE DEPARTMENT OF HEALTH (""DOH"") ON A PROSPECTIVE BASIS. ADJUSTMENTS TO CURRENT AND PRIOR YEARS' RATES FOR THESE PAYERS WILL CONTINUE TO BE MADE IN THE FUTURE. EFFECTIVE JANUARY 1, 2008 THE DOH UPDATED THE DATA UTILIZED TO CALCULATE THE NYS DRG SERVICE INTENSITY WEIGHTS (""SIWS"") IN ORDER TO UTILIZE MORE CURRENT DATA IN DOH PROMULGATED RATES. SIMILAR TYPE OUTPATIENT REFORMS WERE IMPLEMENTED EFFECTIVE DECEMBER 1, 2008. THERE ARE ALSO VARIOUS OTHER PROPOSALS AT THE FEDERAL AND STATE LEVEL THAT COULD, AMONG OTHER THINGS, REDUCE PAYMENT RATES. THE ULTIMATE OUTCOME OF THESE PROPOSALS, REGULATORY CHANGES AND OTHER MARKET CONDITIONS CANNOT PRESENTLY BE DETERMINED. LAWS AND REGULATIONS GOVERNING THE MEDICARE AND MEDICAID PROGRAMS ARE EXTREMELY COMPLEX AND SUBJECT TO INTERPRETATION. AS A RESULT, THERE IS AT LEAST A REASONABLE POSSIBILITY THAT RECORDED ESTIMATES WILL CHANGE BY A MATERIAL AMOUNT IN THE NEAR TERM. THE HOSPITALS HAVE ESTABLISHED ESTIMATES, BASED ON INFORMATION PRESENTLY AVAILABLE, OF AMOUNT DUE TO OR FROM MEDICARE AND NON-MEDICARE PAYERS FOR ADJUSTMENTS TO CURRENT AND PRIOR YEARS' PAYMENT RATES, BASED ON INDUSTRY-WIDE AND HOSPITAL-SPECIFIC DATA. THE HOSPITALS' MEDICARE COST REPORTS HAVE BEEN AUDITED AND FINALIZED BY THE MEDICARE FISCAL INTERMEDIARY THROUGH DECEMBER 31, 2009. ON FEBRUARY 19, 2004, THE SECRETARY OF HEALTH AND HUMAN SERVICES CONFIRMED THAT HOSPITALS CAN PROVIDE DISCOUNTS FOR UNINSURED PATIENTS, WHICH ALLOWED THE HOSPITALS TO IMPLEMENT A DISCOUNT POLICY IN ACCORDANCE WITH STATE LAW. THE HOSPITALS' GOAL WAS TO CREATE A FINANCIAL AID PROGRAM THAT IS CONSISTENT WITH THE MISSION, VALUES AND CAPACITY OF THE HOSPITALS, WHILE CONSIDERING AN INDIVIDUAL'S ABILITY TO CONTRIBUTE TO HIS OR HER CARE. THE HOSPITALS HAVE A DISCOUNT POLICY AND PROVIDES DISCOUNTS TO UNINSURED PATIENTS. UNDER THIS POLICY, THE DISCOUNT OFFERED TO UNINSURED PATIENTS IS REFLECTED AS A REDUCTION TO THE NET PATIENT SERVICE REVENUE AT THE TIME THE UNINSURED BILLINGS ARE RECORDED. NET PATIENT SERVICE REVENUE IS REPORTED AT THE ESTIMATED NET REALIZABLE AMOUNTS FROM PATIENTS, THIRD-PARTY PAYORS AND OTHER SERVICES RENDERED AND INCLUDES ESTIMATED RETROACTIVE REVENUE ADJUSTMENTS DUE TO FUTURE AUDITS, REVIEWS AND INVESTIGATIONS. FEDERAL AND STATE REGULATIONS PROVIDE FOR CERTAIN RETROSPECTIVE ADJUSTMENTS TO CURRENT AND PRIOR YEARS' PAYMENT RATES BASED ON INDUSTRY-WIDE AND HOSPITAL-SPECIFIC DATA. THE HOSPITALS HAVE ESTIMATED THE POTENTIAL IMPACT OF SUCH RETROSPECTIVE ADJUSTMENTS BASED ON INFORMATION PRESENTLY AVAILABLE AND ADJUSTMENTS ARE RENDERED AND ARE ADJUSTED IN FUTURE PERIODS AS ADDITIONAL INFORMATION BECOMES AVAILABLE OR FINAL SETTLEMENTS ARE DETERMINED. AS A RESULT OF SUCH PRIOR YEAR ADJUSTMENT THE 2013 AND 2012 NET PATIENT SERVICE REVENUE INCREASED BY APPROXIMATELY $3,800,000 AND $2,300,000, RESPECTIVELY. AS DISCUSSED ABOVE, THE CURRENT MEDICAID AND MEDICARE PROGRAMS ARE BASED UPON COMPLEX LAWS AND REGULATIONS. NONCOMPLIANCE WITH SUCH LAWS AND REGULATIONS COULD RESULT IN FINES, PENALTIES, AND EXCLUSION FROM SUCH PROGRAMS. THE HOSPITAL IS NOT AWARE OF ANY ALLEGATIONS OF NONCOMPLIANCE THAT COULD HAVE A MATERIAL ADVERSE EFFECT ON THE FINANCIAL STATEMENTS AND BELIEVES THAT IT IS IN COMPLIANCE WITH ALL APPLICABLE LAWS AND REGULATIONS. FOR THE YEARS ENDED DECEMBER 31, 2013 AND 2012, NET INPATIENT REVENUE FOR INDIVIDUAL PAYORS CONSISTED OF THE FOLLOWING: MEDICARE 2013-37% 2012-37%, MEDICAID 2013- 35%, 2012-38%, SELF PAY 2013-2%, 2012-1%, COMMERCIAL, MANAGED CARE AND OTHER 2013-26%, 2012-24%.LINE 2 COSTING METHODOLOGY - THE RATIO OF PATIENT COST TO CHARGE APPLIED TO THE BAD DEBT EXPENSES WAS UTILIZED. THE HOSPITALS ARE LOCATED IN AN IMPOVERISHED AREA IN SOUTHWEST YONKERS, NEW YORK WHICH CONTAINS A LARGE NUMBER OF UNINSURED AND MEDICAID ELIGIBLE PATIENTS. MANY OF THESE PATIENTS ARE INDIGENT AND/OR ILLEGAL IMMIGRANTS WHO ARE UNWILLING TO COOPERATE WITH THE HOSPITALS IN APPLYING FOR GOVERNMENT INSURANCE. AS A RESULT, UNCOLLECTIBLE AMOUNTS ARE RECORDED AS BAD DEBT EVEN THOUGH THESE PATIENTS TYPICALLY DO NOT HAVE THE ABILITY TO PAY DUE TO THEIR SOCIOECONOMIC STATUS."

THE HOSPITAL ALSO SERVES THE SECONDARY SERVICE AREA WHICH INCLUDES DEKALB, MCHENRY, WHITESIDE, LEE, LASALLE, STEPHENSON AND ROCK COUNTIES FOR SELECT TERTIARY SERVICES. LOCATED IN NORTHERN ILLINOIS, THE PRIMARY SERVICE AREA IS CHARACTERIZED AS LARGELY RURAL AND POPULATED WITH VERY SMALL COMMUNITIES WITH THE EXCEPTION OF THE NEIGHBORING CITIES OF ROCKFORD, LOVES PARK, AND MACHESNEY PARK WHICH COMPRISE NEARLY 198,000 INDIVIDUALS. THE NEXT LARGEST COMMUNITY IS BELVIDERE, LOCATED IN BOONE COUNTY, WHERE THE ENTIRE COUNTY HAS A POPULATION OF APPROXIMATELY 54,000 INDIVIDUALS. IN CALENDAR YEAR 2012, APPROXIMATELY 85% OF HOSPITAL INPATIENTS WERE FROM THE PRIMARY SERVICE AREA. AS A COMMUNITY THAT RELIES HEAVILY ON MANUFACTURING COMPANIES AND SMALL BUSINESSES, THE AREA HAS BEEN PARTICULARLY HARD HIT IN RECENT ECONOMIC TIMES. CURRENTLY THE LARGEST EMPLOYERS INCLUDE CHRYSLER (BOONE COUNTY), THE ROCKFORD SCHOOL DISTRICT, AND THE THREE ROCKFORD HEALTH CARE PROVIDERS. THE MOST RECENT MEDIAN HOUSEHOLD INCOME FIGURES (U.S. CENSUS BUREAU) IN WINNEBAGO COUNTY WERE $47,600 COMPARED TO THE STATE'S MEDIAN HOUSEHOLD INCOME OF APPROXIMATELY $56,600. THESE DISPARITIES ARE ALSO REFLECTED IN UNEMPLOYMENT, EDUCATION AND POVERTY RATES. UNEMPLOYMENT RATES REMAIN HIGH AT 10.2% IN ROCKFORD IN APRIL 2014 COMPARED TO STATE FIGURES AT 7.5%. ONLY 21% OF WINNEBAGO COUNTY RESIDENTS ATTAIN A BACHELOR'S DEGREE OR HIGHER, WHILE IN THE STATE 31% DO. 17% OF RESIDENTS LIVING IN WINNEBAGO COUNTY ARE BELOW THE POVERTY LINE COMPARED TO OVERALL STATE LEVELS OF SLIGHTLY MORE THAN 13%. CHILDREN IN THE COMMUNITY HAVE BEEN PARTICULARLY HARD HIT WITH CLOSE TO 28% CONSIDERED AT OR BELOW POVERTY LEVELS. (WINNEBAGO COUNTY HEARTLAND ALLIANCE 2011) ALL OF THESE CONDITIONS HAVE RESULTED IN INCREASING PRESSURES ON THE COMMUNITY. ROCKFORD MEMORIAL HOSPITAL IS LOCATED IN THE OLDER, WESTERN PORTION OF THE COMMUNITY AND SERVES A SIGNIFICANT INDIGENT AND ELDERLY POPULATION. THIS IS EVIDENT WHEN LOOKING AT INCOME LEVELS FOR HOUSEHOLDS LOCATED IN ZIP CODES IN WESTERN ROCKFORD WHERE THE HOSPITAL RESIDES. FOR EXAMPLE, THE U.S. CENSUS BUREAU 2008-2012 AMERICAN COMMUNITY SURVEY 5-YEAR ESTIMATES FOR INDIVIDUAL ZIP CODES LISTS MEDIAN HOUSEHOLD INCOME FOR WEST SIDE ZIP CODES AS FOLLOWS: 61103 $35,960; 61102 $31,701; 61101 - $29,909. THE GEOGRAPHIC DISPARITIES ARE EVIDENT WHEN THESE NUMBERS ARE COMPARED TO HOUSEHOLDS LOCATED IN THE EASTERN PORTION OF ROCKFORD. IN COMPARISON, THE 3 LARGEST EAST-SIDE ZIP CODES HAVE THE FOLLOWING MEDIAN HOUSEHOLD INCOMES: 61107 $56,348; 61108 - $47,067; 61109 - $41,315. (NOTE THAT 61109 IS THE THIRD LARGEST EAST-SIDE ZIP, IN TOTAL POPULATION). AS THE ONLY AREA AND NORTHERN ILLINOIS HOSPITAL OFFERING LEVEL III NEONATAL INTENSIVE CARE AND COMPREHENSIVE PEDIATRIC AND PEDIATRIC INTENSIVE CARE SERVICES, ROCKFORD MEMORIAL HOSPITAL IS COMMITTED TO CHILDREN AND IS THE MAIN PROVIDER OF CHILDREN'S SERVICES IN THE AREA AND THE GREATER TERTIARY SERVICE AREA.

VIDEO INTERPRETATION - PATIENTS WHO SEEK MEDICAL CARE AT ROCKFORD HEALTH SYSTEM HAVE VERY DIVERSE NEEDS. FOR SOME, HAVING A DIRECT CONVERSATION WITH A DOCTOR CAN BE CHALLENGING. IT MAY BE BECAUSE THEY CANNOT HEAR OR SPEAK ANOTHER LANGUAGE. SINCE 2011, VIDEO INTERPRETATION IS AVAILABLE FOR THE DEAF AND HARD OF HEARING, AS WELL AS SPANISH-SPEAKING PATIENTS. LAPTOP COMPUTERS WITH VIDEO CAMERAS, IN ROCKFORD MEMORIAL HOSPITAL AND ACROSS ROCKFORD HEALTH PHYSICIAN OFFICES, QUICKLY LINK SKILLED INTERPRETERS WITH PATIENTS AND CAREGIVERS.

AUTOMATIC EXTERNAL DEFIBRILLATORS - FOR MORE THAN 10 YEARS, ROCKFORD HEALTH SYSTEM, IN PARTNERSHIP WITH THE ROCKFORD MEMORIAL DEVELOPMENT FOUNDATION, HAS BEEN HELPING COMMUNITY NON-PROFIT ORGANIZATIONS OBTAIN AUTOMATIC EXTERNAL DEFIBRILLATORS (AEDS). THESE PORTABLE, EASY-TO-USE DEVICES ADMINISTER IMMEDIATE, LIFE-SAVING TREATMENT THAT SHOCKS A HEART IN CARDIAC ARREST BACK TO A REGULAR HEARTBEAT. FROM THE INCEPTION OF THE PROGRAM IN 1999 THROUGH 2012, THE FOUNDATION HAS DONATED 126 AEDS TO COMMUNITY ORGANIZATIONS AND FACILITIES IN THE ROCKFORD AREA THROUGH ITS EXTERNAL GRANTS PROGRAM. THERE ARE MANY STORIES OF LIVES SAVED IN OUR COMMUNITY, THANKS TO THE DONATED AEDS.

THE PURPOSE OF THE BOARD IS TO REVIEW QUESTIONABLE DEATHS OF AREA SENIORS THAT MAY POTENTIALLY BE ATTRIBUTED TO ABUSE. INPUT FROM INDIVIDUALS WHO INTERVENE IN ELDER ABUSE CAN ACTUALLY CLOSE THE DOOR ON A QUESTIONABLE DEATH OR OPEN IT TO FURTHER INVESTIGATION. REVIEW BOARDS SUCH AS THIS HAVE HELPED WITH THE PROSECUTION OF THOSE WHO ABUSE SENIOR CITIZENS. NEIGHBORHOOD HOME OWNERSHIP PROGRAM - ROCKFORD HEALTH SYSTEM OWNS APPROXIMATELY 40 HOMES AND/OR APARTMENT BUILDINGS CLOSE TO THE WEST-SIDE CAMPUS. THESE HOMES AND APARTMENTS ARE RENTED AND SOLD TO EMPLOYEES IN AN EFFORT TO MAINTAIN THE LONG-TERM STABILITY OF THE NEIGHBORHOOD. WITH A PREDOMINATELY OLDER WEST-SIDE NEIGHBORHOOD IN AN AREA THAT HAS BEEN PLAGUED WITH SIGNIFICANT INCIDENCES OF CRIME, LONG-TERM STABILITY IS CRUCIAL TO THE AREA. IN ADDITION TO PROVIDING RENTAL OPPORTUNITIES FOR EMPLOYEES, RHS OFFERS A NEIGHBORHOOD HOME OWNERSHIP PROGRAM WHICH PROVIDES NO INTEREST LOANS TO COVER DOWN-PAYMENT AND CLOSING COSTS FOR EMPLOYEES PURCHASING HOMES IN THE IMMEDIATE AREA AROUND THE HOSPITAL'S N.

201413189349308121,364195126,Part II. COMMUNITY BUILDING ACTIVITIES:,"COMMUNITY BUILDING ACTIVITIES INCLUDE PROGRAMS THAT IMPROVE THE COMMUNITY'S HEALTH AND SAFETY BY ADDRESSING THE ROOT CAUSES OF HEALTH PROBLEMS, SUCH AS POVERTY, HOMELESSNESS AND ENVIRONMENTAL HAZARDS. PARTICIPATION IN COLLABORATIVE COMMUNITY EFFORTS TO PROMOTE PUBLIC HEALTH INITIATIVES IS ALSO INCLUDED, SUCH AS ENGAGEMENT IN COALITIONS AND ADVOCACY FOR HEALTH IMPROVEMENT. THESE ACTIVITIES STRENGTHEN THE COMMUNITY'S CAPACITY TO PROMOTE THE HEALTH AND WELL-BEING OF ITS RESIDENTS BY OFFERING THE EXPERTISE AND RESOURCES OF THE HEALTH CARE ORGANIZATION. PRESENCE HEALTH HOSPITAL MINISTRIES ENGAGE IN A VARIETY OF COMMUNITY-BUILDING ACTIVITIES WHICH ULTIMATELY IMPROVE THE HEALTH AND WELL-BEING OF THE COMMUNITIES WE ARE PRIVILEGED TO SERVE, EVEN THOUGH THEY ARE NOT SPECIFIC HEALTH ACTIVITIES. EXAMPLES OF COMMUNITY BUILDING ACTIVITIES INCLUDE: *THE WORK OF ALL OF OUR HOSPITALS IN SUPPORT OF DISASTER READINESS AND EMERGENCY PREPAREDNESS. THIS WORK GOES ABOVE AND BEYOND ANY LICENSURE REQUIREMENTS TO PROACTIVELY ENSURE THAT OUR COMMUNITIES ARE SAFE AND PREPARED IF A DISASTER SHOULD PRESENT ITSELF. *COMMUNITY SUPPORT: DONATIONS FROM OUR MINISTRIES TO ORGANIZATIONS ADDRESSING THE ROOT CAUSES OF HEALTH PROBLEMS. *COALITION BUILDING: PRESENCE SAINT JOSEPH MEDICAL CENTER LEADS A COMMUNITY COALITION, JOLIET PARTNERS FOR HEALTHY FAMILIES (JPHF), WITH THE GOAL OF MAKING WILL COUNTY A HEALTHIER PLACE TO LIVE.

201413189349308121,364195126,"Part III. BAD DEBT, MEDICARE, & COLLECTION PRACTICES:","PART III, SECTION A, LINE 2 THERE ARE NO ESTIMATES OF BAD DEBT INCLUDED. BAD DEBT IS AT TOTAL EXPENSE. PART III, SECTION A, LINE 3 THE PROVISION FOR FINANCIAL ASSISTANCE POLICY ALLOWS FOR ACCOUNTS IN BAD DEBT TO BE APPROVED FOR FINANCIAL ASSISTANCE IF THE PATIENT MEETS THE CRITERIA. THERE ARE POSSIBLE FINANCIAL ASSISTANCE ACCOUNTS IN BAD DEBT, ALTHOUGH THE EXACT PERCENTAGE IS UNKNOWN AS WE DO NOT HAVE THE APPROPRIATE TOOLS TO DETERMINE THIS PERCENTAGE ACCURATELY. PART III, SECTION A, LINE 4 PATIENTS' ACCOUNTS RECEIVABLE ARE REDUCED BY AN ALLOWANCE FOR UNCOLLECTIBLE ACCOUNTS. IN EVALUATING THE COLLECTIBILITY OF PATIENTS' ACCOUNTS RECEIVABLE, PRESENCE HEALTH ANALYZES ITS PAST HISTORY AND IDENTIFIES TRENDS FOR EACH OF ITS MAJOR PAYOR SOUCES OF REVENUE TO ESTIMATE THE APPROPRIATE ALLOWANCE FOR UNCOLLECTIBLE ACCOUNTS AND PROVISION FOR UNCOLLECTIBLE ACCOUNTS RECEIVABLE. MANAGEMENT REGULARLY REVIEWS DATA ABOUT THESE MAJOR PAYOR SOURCES OF REVENUE IN EVALUATING THE SUFFICIENCY OF THE ALLOWANCE FOR UNCOLLECTIBLE ACCOUNTS. FOR RECEIVABLES ASSOCIATED WITH SERVICES PROVIDED TO PATIENTS WHO HAVE THIRD-PARTY COVERAGE, PRESENCE HEALTH ANALYZES CONTRACTUALLY DUE AMOUNTS AND PROVIDES AN ALLOWANCE FOR UNCOLLECTIBLE ACCOUNTS AND A PROVISION FOR UNCOLLECTIBLE ACCOUNTS RECEIVABLE, IF NECESSARY. FOR RECEIVABLES ASSOCIATED WITH PATIENT RESPONSIBILITY (WHICH INCLUDES BOTH PATIENTS WITHOUT INSURANCE AND PATIENTS WITH DEDUCTIBLE AND COPAYMENT BALANCES DUE FOR WHICH THIRD-PARTY COVERAGE EXISTS FOR PART OF THE BILL), THE PATIENTS ARE SCREENED AGAINST PRESENCE HEALTH CHARITY CARE POLICY AND UNINSURED DISCOUNT POLICY. FOR ANY REMAINING PATIENT RESPONSIBILITY BALANCE, PRESENCE HEALTH RECORDS A PROVISION FOR UNCOLLECTIBLE ACCOUNTS RECEIVABLE IN THE PERIOD OF SERVICE ON THE BASIS OF ITS PAST EXPERIENCE, WHICH INDICATES THAT MANY PATIENTS ARE UNABLE OR UNWILLING TO PAY THE PORTION OF THEIR BILL FOR WHICH THEY ARE FINANCIALLY RESPONSIBLE. THE DIFFERENCE BETWEEN THE STANDARD RATE (OR DISCOUNTED RATES IF NEGOTIATED) AND THE AMOUNTS ACTUALLY COLLECTED AFTER ALL REASONABLE COLLECTION EFFORTS HAVE BEEN EXHAUSTED IS CHARGED OFF AGAINST THE ALLOWANCE FOR UNCOLLECTIBLE ACCOUNTS. PART III, SECTION B, LINE 8 PRESENCE HEALTH COMPUTES THE MEDICARE SHORTFALL BASED ON A RATIO OF COST TO CHARGES. PRESENCE HEALTH BELIEVES IT IS IMPORTANT FOR THE COMMUNITY AND THE IRS TO BE MADE AWARE OF GOVERNMENT SHORTFALLS, SPECIFICALLY MEDICARE. HOWEVER, WE ACKNOWLEDGE THAT MEDICARE SHORTFALLS MAY BE EXPERIENCED BY OTHER THAN NON-PROFIT HEALTHCARE ORGANIZATIONS. AS SUCH, PRESENCE HEALTH DOES NOT BELIEVE THAT MEDICARE SHORTFALL SHOULD BE CONSIDERED COMMUNITY BENEFIT. PART III, SECTION C, LINE 9B COLLECTION POLICIES ARE THE SAME FOR ALL PRESENCE HEALTH ENTITIES. PATIENTS ARE NOTIFIED OF THE FINANCIAL ASSISTANCE POLICY AT THE TIME OF REGISTRATION VIA POSTED NOTIFICATIONS AND ON EVERY ACCOUNT STATEMENT THAT IS SENT TO THEM. THIS INFORMATION IS AVAILABLE IN A NUMBER OF LANGUAGES. PATIENTS MAY APPLY FOR FINANCIAL ASSISTANCE AT ANY TIME DURING THE REVENUE CYCLE. PER THE PROVISION FOR FINANCIAL ASSISTANCE POLICY, THE COLLECTION PROCESS IS AS FOLLOWS: 1. PRE-LITIGATION REVIEW. PRIOR TO AN ACCOUNT BEING AUTHORIZED FOR THE FILING OF SUIT FOR NON-PAYMENT OF A PATIENT BILL, A FINAL REVIEW OF THE ACCOUNT WILL BE CONDUCTED AND APPROVED BY THE FINANCIAL COUNSELING REPRESENTATIVE (OR DESIGNEE) TO MAKE SURE THAT NO APPLICATION OF FINANCIAL ASSISTANCE WAS EVER RECEIVED AND THAT THERE EXISTS OBJECTIVE EVIDENCE THAT THE PATIENT DOES HAVE SUFFICIENT FINANCIAL MEANS TO PAY ALL OR PART OF HIS/HER BILL. PRIOR TO A COLLECTIONS SUIT BEING FILED, THE SELF-PAY COLLECTIONS DIRECTOR MUST REVIEW AND APPROVE. 2. RESIDENTIAL LIENS. NO HOSPITAL WILL PLACE A LIEN ON THE PRIMARY RESIDENCE OF A PATIENT WHO HAS BEEN DETERMINED TO BE ELIGIBLE FOR FINANCIAL ASSISTANCE/CHARITY CARE, FOR PAYMENT OF THE PATIENT'S UNDISCOUNTED BALANCE DUE. FURTHER, IN NO CASE WILL ANY HOSPITAL EXECUTE A LIEN BY FORCING THE SALE OR FORECLOSURE OF THE PRIMARY RESIDENCE OF ANY PATIENT TO PAY FOR ANY OUTSTANDING MEDICAL BILL. 3. NO USE OF BODY ATTACHMENTS. NO HOSPITAL WILL USE BODY ATTACHMENT TO REQUIRE ANY PERSON, WHETHER RECEIVING FINANCIAL ASSISTANCE/CHARITY CARE DISCOUNTS OR NOT, TO APPEAR IN COURT. 4. COLLECTION AGENCY REFERRALS. EACH HOSPITAL FINANCE ACCOUNTING WILL ENSURE THAT ALL COLLECTION AGENCIES USED TO COLLECT PATIENT BILLS PROMPTLY REFER ANY PATIENT WHO INDICATES FINANCIAL NEED, OR OTHERWISE APPEARS TO QUALIFY FOR FINANCIAL ASSISTANCE/CHARITY CARE DISCOUNTS, TO A FINANCIAL COUNSELOR TO DETERMINE IF THE PATIENT IS ELIGIBLE FOR SUCH A CHARITABLE DISCOUNT.

IN ADDITION TO ASSESSING THE HEALTH NEEDS, PRESENCE HOSPITAL MINISTRIES ALSO COMPLETE MEDICAL STAFF DEVELOPMENT PLANS. THE PLANS ARE CONDUCTED BY EXTERNAL CONSULTANTS, WHO PROVIDE AN INDEPENDENT ASSESSMENT OF THE NEED FOR PHYSICIANS BY SPECIALTY WITHIN THE HOSPITAL'S PRIMARY SERVICE AREA AS DEFINED BY STARK REGULATIONS. IDENTIFYING COMMUNITY NEEDS IS JUST ONE STEP IN THE CHNA PROCESS. THE MOST CRITICAL STEP IS PRIORITIZING AND ALIGNING EXPERTISE TO MAKE AN IMPACT ON THE IDENTIFIED NEEDS. TO FACILITATE THIS PROCESS, EACH HOSPITAL MINISTRY HAS A MISSION COMMITTEE OF THE BOARD THAT IS ULTIMATELY RESPONSIBLE FOR THE OVERSIGHT AND DIRECTION OF THE COMMUNITY BENEFIT INITIATIVES. ON AN ANNUAL BASIS THIS BOARD COMMITTEE, WHICH IS MADE UP OF COMMUNITY AND BOARD MEMBERS, RECOMMENDS APPROVAL TO THE HOSPITAL BOARD OF DIRECTORS THE HOSPITAL'S ANNUAL IMPLEMENTATION STRATEGY. THIS PLAN IDENTIFIES THE PRIORITIES AND ACTION THAT WILL TAKE PLACE OVER THE NEXT YEAR. PART VI, 3 PRESENCE HEALTH HOSPITAL MINISTRIES PROACTIVELY COMMUNICATE THE AVAILABILITY OF OUR FINANCIAL ASSISTANCE/CHARITY CARE PROGRAMS BY USING MULTIPLE TYPES OF APPROPRIATE MEDIA AND IN MULTIPLE APPROPRIATE LANGUAGES. THE MECHANISMS USED BY PRESENCE HEALTH HOSPITALS TO COMMUNICATE THE AVAILABILITY OF FINANCIAL ASSISTANCE/CHARITY CARE INCLUDE, BUT ARE NOT LIMITED TO THE FOLLOWING: 1. SIGNAGE. SIGNS ARE POSTED PROMINENTLY THROUGHOUT HIGH TRAFFIC AREAS OF OUR MINISTRIES, AS WELL AS WITHIN OUR INPATIENT AND OUTPATIENT REGISTRATION/PATIENT ADMITTING AREAS AND EMERGENCY DEPARTMENTS. SIGNS STATE THAT PATIENTS MAY BE ELIGIBLE FOR FINANCIAL ASSISTANCE/CHARITY CARE DISCOUNTS, AND DESCRIBE HOW TO OBTAIN MORE INFORMATION, INCLUDING IDENTIFICATION OF APPROPRIATE HOSPITAL REPRESENTATIVES BY TITLE. SIGNS ARE IN MULTIPLE LANGUAGES. 2. PROVISION OF FINANCIAL ASSISTANCE MATERIALS TO UNINSURED PATIENTS. PRESENCE HEALTH HOSPITALS PROVIDE A SUMMARY OF ITS FINANCIAL ASSISTANCE PROGRAMS AND A FINANCIAL ASSISTANCE APPLICATION TO ALL PERSONS RECEIVING HOSPITAL CARE THAT IT IDENTIFIES AS UNINSURED PATIENTS AT THE TIME OF IN-PERSON REGISTRATION, ADMISSION, OR SUCH LATER TIME THAT THE PATIENT IS FIRST IDENTIFIED AS AN UNINSURED PATIENT. FOR PATIENTS PRESENTING IN THE EMERGENCY DEPARTMENT, ALL PRESENCE HEALTH HOSPITALS PROVIDE SUCH FINANCIAL ASSISTANCE MATERIALS AT SUCH TIME AND IN SUCH MANNER AS IS CONSISTENT WITH THEIR OBLIGATIONS UNDER EMTALA TO ACCESS AND STABILIZE THE PATIENT BEFORE MAKING INQUIRY OF THE PATIENT'S ABILITY TO PAY. 3. BROCHURES. BROCHURES, INFORMATION SHEETS AND SIMILAR FORMS OF WRITTEN COMMUNICATION REGARDING THE HOSPITAL'S FINANCIAL ASSISTANCE/CHARITY CARE POLICY ARE MAINTAINED IN APPROPRIATE AREAS OF THE HOSPITAL (E.G. EMERGENCY DEPARTMENT, ORGANIZED REGISTRATION AREAS, THE BUSINESS OFFICE). THESE COMMUNICATIONS STATE IN MULTIPLE LANGUAGES THAT THE HOSPITAL OFFERS FINANCIAL ASSISTANCE/CHARITY CARE DISCOUNTS AND DESCRIBES HOW TO OBTAIN MORE INFORMATION. 4. WEBSITE. COMPREHENSIVE INFORMATION ABOUT OUR FINANCIAL ASSISTANCE PROGRAMS - INCLUDING ELIGIBILITY CRITERIA, APPLICATION DETAILS, AND CONTACT INFORMATION - IS ALSO AVAILABLE ON OUR CONSUMER WEB SITE (HTTP://PRESENCEHEALTH.ORG/PATIENTS-AND-VISITORS/FINANCIAL-ASSISTANCE). 5. BILLING NOTICES. EACH PRESENCE HEALTH HOSPITAL INCLUDES A NOTE ON OR WITH THE HOSPITAL BILL AND/OR STATEMENT REGARDING THE HOSPITAL'S FINANCIAL ASSISTANCE/CHARITY CARE PROGRAM AND HOW THE PATIENT MAY APPLY FOR CONSIDERATION UNDER THIS PROGRAM. 6. FINANCIAL COUNSELORS. EACH PRESENCE HEALTH HOSPITAL HAS ONE OR MORE FINANCIAL COUNSELORS WHOSE CONTACT INFORMATION IS LISTED OR PROVIDED WITH OTHER INFORMATION CONCERNING THE FINANCIAL ASSISTANCE/CHARITY CARE DISCOUNT PROGRAM. THESE COUNSELORS ARE AVAILABLE TO DISCUSS ELIGIBILITY AND OTHER QUESTIONS CONCERNING THE PROGRAM, AND PROVIDE ASSISTANCE WITH APPLICATIONS. THEY ARE ALSO AVAILABLE TO MEET WITH PATIENTS DURING THEIR STAY IF THEY HAVE QUESTIONS ABOUT THEIR ABILITY TO PAY FOR SERVICES AND OUR FINANCIAL ASSISTANCE PROGRAMS. 7. NOTIFICATION OF DETERMINATION. WHEN A PRESENCE HEALTH HOSPITAL MAKES A DETERMINATION THAT A PATIENT'S BILL IS DISCOUNTED OR ADJUSTED BASED ON A DETERMINATION OF FINANCIAL NEED, THE HOSPITAL NOTIFIES THE PATIENT OF SUCH ELIGIBILITY DETERMINATION AND THAT THERE IS NO FURTHER COLLECTION ACTION TAKEN ON THE DISCOUNTED PORTION OF THE PATIENT'S BILL."

THESE SERVICES ARE PROVIDED DESPITE CREATING A FINANCIAL LOSS FOR AHHC. THESE SERVICES ARE PROVIDED BECAUSE THEY MEET AN IDENTIFIED COMMUNITY NEED.

PART VI, LINE 1 - DESCRIPTION FOR PART II N/A PART VI, LINE 1 - DESCRIPTION FOR PART III, LINES 2 - 4 THE FOOTNOTES TO ADVOCATE HEALTH CARE NETWORK AND SUBSIDIARIES' AUDITED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS DO NOT SPECIFICALLY ADDRESS BAD DEBT EXPENSE; RATHER, THE FOOTNOTE DESCRIBES ADVOCATE'S PATIENT ACCOUNTS RECEIVABLE POLICY AND THE PERCENTAGE OF ACCOUNTS RECEIVABLE THAT THE ALLOWANCE FOR DOUBTFUL ACCOUNTS COVERS (SEE PAGE 10 OF THE AUDITED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS). FOR 2013, FOR AHHC, THE ALLOWANCE FOR DOUBTFUL ACCOUNTS COVERED 22.16% OF NET PATIENT ACCOUNTS RECEIVABLE. PATIENT ACCOUNTS RECEIVABLE ARE STATED AT NET REALIZABLE VALUE. AHHC EVALUATES THE COLLECTABILITY OF ITS ACCOUNTS RECEIVABLE BASED ON THE LENGTH OF TIME THE RECEIVABLE IS OUTSTANDING, PAYER CLASS, HISTORICAL COLLECTION EXPERIENCE, AND TRENDS IN HEALTH CARE INSURANCE PROGRAMS. ACCOUNTS RECEIVABLE ARE CHARGED TO THE ALLOWANCE FOR UNCOLLECTIBLE ACCOUNTS WHEN THEY ARE DEEMED UNCOLLECTIBLE. THE COSTING METHODOLOGY USED IN DETERMINING THE AMOUNTS REPORTED ON LINES 2 AND 3 IS BASED ON THE RATIO OF PATIENT CARE COST TO CHARGES. THE UNREIMBURSED COST OF BAD DEBT WAS CALCULATED BY APPLYING THE ORGANIZATION'S COST TO CHARGE RATIO FROM THE MEDICARE COST REPORTS (CMS 2252-96 WORKSHEET C, PART 1, PPS INPATIENT RATIOS) TO THE ORGANIZATION'S BAD DEBT PROVISION PER GENERALLY ACCEPTED ACCOUNTING PRINCIPLES, LESS ANY PATIENT OR THIRD PARTY PAYOR PAYMENTS RECEIVED. ADVOCATE MAKES EVERY EFFORT TO IDENTIFY THOSE PATIENTS WHO ARE ELIGIBLE FOR FINANCIAL ASSISTANCE BY STRICTLY ADHERING TO ITS FINANCIAL ASSISTANCE POLICY. WE BELIEVE THAT ADVOCATE HAS A POPULATION OF PATIENTS WHO ARE UNINSURED OR UNDERINSURED BUT WHO DO NOT COMPLETE THE FINANCIAL ASSISTANCE APPLICATION. THE ESTIMATED AMOUNT OF BAD DEBT EXPENSE (AT COST) WHICH COULD BE REASONABLY ATTRIBUTABLE TO PATIENTS WHO WOULD LIKELY QUALIFY FOR FINANCIAL ASSISTANCE UNDER THE ORGANIZATION'S FINANCIAL ASSISTANCE POLICY, IF SUFFICIENT INFORMATION HAD BEEN AVAILABLE TO MAKE A DETERMINATION OF THEIR ELIGIBILITY, WAS BASED UPON SELF PAY PATIENT ACCOUNTS WHICH HAD AMOUNTS WRITTEN OFF TO BAD DEBTS. OUR METHOD WAS TO BEGIN WITH THE SELF-PAY PORTION OF BAD DEBT EXPENSE PROVISION. THE SELF-PAY PORTION EXCLUDES THOSE PATIENTS WHO HAD CHARITY APPLICATIONS PENDING AT THE TIME OF SERVICE. THIS COST WAS THEN REDUCED BY CHARGES IDENTIFIED AS TRUE BAD DEBT EXPENSE, INCLUDING COPAYS FOR PATIENTS WHO QUALIFIED FOR LESS THAN 100% FINANCIAL ASSISTANCE. THE COST TO CHARGE RATIO WAS THEN APPLIED TO THE REMAINING CHARGES, TO DETERMINE THE VALUE (AT COST) OF PATIENT ACCOUNTS THAT DID NOT COMPLETE FINANCIAL COUNSELING AND WERE ASSIGNED TO BAD DEBT. WE BELIEVE THIS PROCESS IS A REASONABLE BASIS FOR OUR ESTIMATE. AS WE ARE ONLY CONSIDERING SELF-PAY ACCOUNTS WRITTEN OFF TO BAD DEBT FOR THIS ESTIMATE, THIS ESTIMATE DOES NOT INCLUDE THE IMMEDIATE 20% DISCOUNT TO CHARGES WHICH IS APPLIED TO ALL SELF-PAY PATIENTS. IT ALSO DOES NOT INCLUDE ACCOUNT BALANCES OR CO-PAYS OF NON-SELF PAY ACCOUNTS WHICH ARE WRITTEN OFF TO BAD DEBT WHEN THE PATIENT HAS NO OTHER FINANCIAL RESOURCES TO PAY THESE AMOUNTS AND THE PATIENT DOES NOT APPLY FOR FINANCIAL ASSISTANCE. BAD DEBT AMOUNTS HAVE BEEN EXCLUDED FROM OTHER COMMUNITY BENEFIT AMOUNTS REPORTED THROUGHOUT SCHEDULE H. PART VI, LINE 1 - DESCRIPTION FOR PART III, LINE 8 THE SHORTFALL OF $95,103,916 ON PART III, LINE 7 IS THE UNREIMBURSED COST OF PROVIDING SERVICES FOR MEDICARE PATIENTS AND SHOULD BE TREATED AS COMMUNITY BENEFIT BECAUSE PROVIDING THESE SERVICES WITHOUT REIMBURSEMENT LESSENS THE BURDENS OF GOVERNMENT OR OTHER CHARITIES THAT WOULD OTHERWISE BE NEEDED TO SERVE THE COMMUNITY. FOR ADVOCATE HEALTH AND HOSPITAL CORPORATION'S HOSPITAL OPERATIONS, THE UNREIMBURSED COST OF MEDICARE WAS CALCULATED BY APPLYING THE ORGANIZATION'S COST TO CHARGE RATIO FROM THE MEDICARE COST REPORTS (CMS 2252-96 WORKSHEET C, PART 1, PPS INPATIENT RATIOS) AND FOR NON-HOSPITAL OPERATIONS THE COST TO CHARGE RATIO CALCULATED ON WORKSHEET 2 RATIO OF PATIENT CARE COST TO CHARGES TO THE ORGANIZATION'S MEDICARE, LESS ANY PATIENT OR THIRD PARTY PAYOR PAYMENTS AND/OR CONTRIBUTIONS RECEIVED THAT WERE DESIGNATED FOR THE PAYMENT OF MEDICARE PATIENT BILLS. PART VI, LINE 1 - DESCRIPTION FOR PART III, LINE 9B ADVOCATE HEALTH AND HOSPITALS CORPORATION MAINTAINS BOTH WRITTEN FINANCIAL ASSISTANCE AND BAD DEBT/COLLECTION POLICIES. THE BAD DEBT/COLLECTION POLICY DOES NOT APPLY TO THOSE PATIENTS KNOWN TO QUALIFY FOR CHARITY CARE OR OTHER FINANCIAL ASSISTANCE, THEREFORE SUCH PATIENTS ARE NOT SUBJECT TO COLLECTION PRACTICES."

SIGNIFICANT STRESSORS IDENTIFIED BY THE SURVEY RESPONDENTS INCLUDED CONCERNS ABOUT UNEMPLOYMENT AND FINANCE. THE SURVEY ALSO INDICATED THAT APPROXIMATELY 10 PERCENT OF RESPONDENTS HAD THOUGHT ABOUT SUICIDE.

THE PROGRAM IS BASED ON FIVE CORE PRINCIPLES: (1) BE FIT; (2) BE STRONG; (3) BE CONFIDENT; (4) BE ENGAGED; AND (5) BE HEALTH SMART. IN THE FALL OF 2013, ADVOCATE LUTHERAN GENERAL HOSPITAL/ADVOCATE CHILDREN'S HOSPITAL REGISTERED 27 CHILDREN; 20 THAT ATTENDED AND 12 THAT COMPLETED THE 8-WEEK SESSION. IMPROVEMENT WAS NOTED IN WEIGHT, BMI, BODY FAT, FAT MASS AND HIP/WAIST RATIO, WITH AN INCREASE OF FAT FREE MASS.

WITH NEARLY 84,000 SOUTH ASIANS LIVING IN HOSPITAL'S SERVICE AREA, THE SACC PROVIDES CULTURALLY SENSITIVE CLINICAL CARE, WHILE PROVIDING EDUCATION AND SCREENINGS FOR CARDIOVASCULAR DISEASE IN THE COMMUNITY. A VARIETY OF FACTORS, INCLUDING HIGHER RATES OF METABOLIC SYNDROME AND ATHEROGENIC LIPID PROFILES, BIOMARKERS FOR THROMBOSIS AND INFLAMMATION, AND CULTURALLY UNIQUE LIFESTYLE CHOICES HAVE SHOWN THAT TRADITIONAL CARDIOVASCULAR RISK STRATIFICATION MODELS, SUCH AS THE FRAMINGHAM RISK FACTOR PROFILE SCORE, DO NOT EFFECTIVELY STRATIFY THE RISK FOR SOUTH ASIANS. THE SOUTH ASIAN CARDIOVASCULAR CENTER WAS ESTABLISHED TO DEVELOP A UNIQUE MULTI-PRONGED APPROACH TO REDUCE THESE RISK FACTORS. THIS APPROACH INCLUDES COMMUNITY EDUCATION AND ENGAGEMENT, CLINICAL SERVICES (WITH A CULTURALLY APPROPRIATE CLINICAL NURSE NAVIGATOR) AND A RESEARCH COMPONENT.

ADVOCATE HEALTH CARE'S BOARD OF DIRECTORS, SENIOR LEADERSHIP AND ASSOCIATES (EMPLOYEES) ARE COMMITTED TO POSITIVELY AFFECTING THE HEALTH STATUS AND QUALITY OF LIFE OF INDIVIDUALS AND POPULATIONS IN COMMUNITIES SERVED BY ADVOCATE THROUGH PROGRAMS AND PRACTICES THAT REFLECT ADVOCATE'S WHOLISTIC PHILOSOPHY. TO THAT END, THEY CONTINUE TO UNDERTAKE AND SUPPORT INITIATIVES THAT ENHANCE ACCESS TO HEALTH AND WELLNESS SERVICES WITHIN THE DIVERSE COMMUNITIES THAT ADVOCATE SERVES. SYSTEM LEADERSHIP IS BOTH DESIGNED TO DIRECT AND SUPPORT THE HOSPITALS IN THEIR EFFORTS TO ADDRESS IDENTIFIED COMMUNITY NEEDS. IN 2010, A MULTI-DISCIPLINARY TEAM OF INDIVIDUALS AT THE SYSTEM LEVEL HAVING OVERSIGHT RESPONSIBILITY FOR COMMUNITY BENEFITS REPORTING AND THE CHNA PROCESS WAS CONVENED TO LEAD THE HOSPITALS THROUGH THE CHNA PROCESS TO MEET STATE AND FEDERAL REGULATORY REQUIREMENTS. THIS TEAM, CALLED THE COMMUNITY HEALTH STEERING COMMITTEE, MET FREQUENTLY TO ASSURE THAT: THE HOSPITAL COMMUNITY HEALTH LEADERS ARE EDUCATED REGARDING HOW TO CONDUCT A CHNA; SITE COMMUNITY HEALTH COUNCILS ARE DEVELOPED AND MAINTAINED; THOSE CONDUCTING THE CHNA PROCESS PULL DATA FROM RELIABLE SOURCES; SOUND ASSUMPTIONS ARE MADE BASED ON THAT DATA; INTERNAL ADVOCATE AND COMMUNITY RESOURCES ARE MAPPED TO DETERMINE STRENGTHS AND WEAKNESSES; ACHIEVABLE NEEDS ARE SELECTED AS PRIORITIES; AND PLANNED INITIATIVES ARE GROUNDED IN EVIDENCE-BASED PROGRAMS THAT WILL YIELD RELIABLE OUTCOMES TO DETERMINE IMPACT. TO FOCUS THESE EFFORTS THROUGHOUT ADVOCATE HEALTH CARE, THE COMMUNITY BENEFITS PLAN WAS WRITTEN. THE PLAN'S BROAD GOALS AND OBJECTIVES WERE DESIGNED TO STRUCTURE SYSTEM-WIDE COMMUNITY BENEFITS ACTIVITIES WITHIN A STRATEGIC FRAMEWORK. INCLUDED IN THE COMMUNITY BENEFITS PLAN ARE NOT ONLY PLANNED GOALS AND OBJECTIVES FOCUSED ON ADDRESSING NEEDS AS IDENTIFIED THROUGH THE HOSPITAL COMMUNITY HEALTH NEEDS ASSESSMENT PROCESS, BUT ALSO OTHER SYSTEM-WIDE COMMUNITY BENEFITS/COMMUNITY HEALTH PROGRAMS SUCH AS CHARITY CARE. ADVOCATE'S COMMUNITY BENEFITS PLAN WAS DEVELOPED TO ESTABLISH STRATEGIES FOR IMPROVING ACCESS TO CARE AND POSITIVELY AFFECTING THE HEALTH OF THE COMMUNITIES THAT ADVOCATE SERVES. THE PLAN SETS THE COURSE FOR STRENGTHENING EXISTING PARTNERSHIPS AND BUILDING NEW ONES WITH INDIVIDUALS AND ORGANIZATIONS WITHIN ADVOCATE'S SERVICE AREAS IN ORDER TO LEVERAGE AND MAXIMIZE THE IMPACT OF ITS PROGRAMS. ADVOCATE'S COMMUNITY BENEFITS PLAN GOALS ARE AS FOLLOWS. GOAL 1: OPTIMIZE ADVOCATE'S ABILITY TO LEVERAGE ITS COMMUNITY HEALTH RESOURCES AND CONTINUE PROGRAMS THAT BENEFIT THE COMMUNITY BY PROSPECTIVELY ALIGNING SYSTEM AND SITE PLANS AND ACTIVITIES. IN ORDER TO ASSURE ALIGNMENT BETWEEN SITE AND SYSTEM GOALS, QUALITY AND CONSISTENCY AMONGST THE HOSPITALS' CHNAS AND TO LEVERAGE THE HOSPITALS' STAFF TIME AND CHNA EFFORTS, THE SYSTEM LEVEL COMMUNITY HEALTH STEERING COMMITTEE PROVIDED A STANDARDIZED CHNA PROCESS, TOOLS, EDUCATION AND STRUCTURE. SPECIFIC EXAMPLES OF THE SUPPORT PROVIDED BY THE STEERING COMMITTEE TO ENABLE THE HOSPITALS TO REALIZE THEIR COMMUNITY HEALTH GOALS AND OBJECTIVES ARE AS FOLLOWS. - A STANDARDIZED CHNA PROCESS THAT INCLUDED DEVELOPMENT OF A COMMUNITY HEALTH COUNCIL AT EACH HOSPITAL WITH BOTH HOSPITAL AND COMMUNITY REPRESENTATION. THE COUNCILS WERE CHARGED WITH MANAGING THEIR SITE'S ASSESSMENT, EXAMINING DATA, SITE AND COMMUNITY RESOURCES, SELECTING KEY PRIORITIES TO ADDRESS AND DEVELOPING A COMMUNITY HEALTH PLAN. - PURCHASE OF AND INSTRUCTION ON HOW TO USE SURVEY RESULTS AND THE ASSESSMENT TOOL DEVELOPED BY PROFESSIONAL RESEARCH CONSULTANTS. - LED A SERIES OF WORKSHOPS OVER THREE YEARS WITH INTERNAL AND EXTERNAL SPEAKERS PROFICIENT IN CHNAS, IDENTIFYING RELIABLE DATA SOURCES, PRIORITY SETTING, AND SELECTING EVIDENCE-BASED INTERVENTIONS. - SET THE COMMUNITY HEALTH LEADERSHIP COUNCIL'S AGENDAS, A COUNCIL COMPRISED OF COMMUNITY HEALTH STAKEHOLDERS FROM ACROSS ADVOCATE, TO FOCUS ON CHNA OBJECTIVES. - MANAGED HOSPITAL PROGRESS AGAINST SYSTEM ANNUAL TIMELINES TO ACHIEVE THE THREE-YEAR VISION, REQUIRING ANNUAL CHNA PROGRESS REPORTS AND THEIR REVIEW AND ENDORSEMENT BY THE HOSPITAL GOVERNING COUNCILS EACH YEAR. - PROVIDED ONGOING CONSULTATION ON AN AS NEED BASIS THROUGHOUT THE PROCESS. - ENGAGED AND FUNDED AN OUTSIDE CHNA CONSULTANT TO MEET ONE-ON-ONE WITH THE SITE COMMUNITY HEALTH LEADERS AND REVIEW CHNA PROGRESS AND PROVIDE GUIDANCE IN AREAS OF DIFFICULTY OR UNCERTAINTY. - PROVIDED AN OVERVIEW OF THE CHNA RESULTS AND PLANNED INTERVENTIONS TO THE MISSION & SPIRITUAL COMMITTEE OF THE ADVOCATE HEALTH CARE BOARD OF DIRECTORS TO SECURE THE COMMITTEE'S ENDORSEMENT. - A STANDARDIZED FORMAT FOR HOSPITALS TO USE IN DRAFTING THEIR CHNAS AND IMPLEMENTATION PLANS, WHICH SYSTEM LEADERS THEN REVIEWED AND EDITED FOR CONSISTENCY, ACCURACY AND QUALITY OF CONTENT. - WORKED WITH SYSTEM LEVEL MEDIA CENTER AND WEB TEAM TO DEVELOP PLACEMENT AND POSTING OF CHNA REPORTS & IMPLEMENTATION PLANS TO MEET PPACA/IRS REGULATORY REPORTING REQUIREMENTS. - IN PREPARATION FOR THE NEXT CHNA CYCLE, PURCHASED THE HEALTHY COMMUNITIES INSTITUTE'S CHNA TOOL IN LATE 2013 TO SUPPORT THE SITES IN CONDUCTING THEIR NEXT CHNA WHILE AT THE SAME TIME MONITORING OUTCOMES OF PLANNED INTERVENTIONS IMPLEMENTED AS A RESULT OF ADVOCATE'S FIRST (2011-2013) CHNA. THROUGH ADVOCATE'S HOSPITAL-BASED SERVICES, AS WELL AS ITS PARTICIPATION IN PROVIDING PROGRAMS AND SERVICES IN THE COMMUNITY, ADVOCATE PROMOTES A SHARED APPROACH TO COMMUNITY BENEFITS. IN ADDITION TO HOSPITAL/COMMUNITY SPECIFIC PROGRAMS, THERE ARE ALSO PROGRAMS ADDRESSING NEEDS OF BROAD GEOGRAPHIC PORTIONS OF ADVOCATE'S SERVICE AREA WHICH ARE MANAGED AND FUNDED AT THE SYSTEM LEVEL. THESE PROGRAMS INCLUDE THE FOLLOWING. IN 2013, ADVOCATE HEALTHY STEPS SPECIALISTS TOUCHED THE LIVES OF 6,688 YOUNG CHILDREN THROUGH CHILDHOOD PROGRAMS WITHIN PEDIATRIC/FAMILY PRACTICE RESIDENCIES AT ADVOCATE ILLINOIS MASONIC MEDICAL CENTER, AND ADVOCATE CHILDREN'S HOSPITAL OAK LAWN AND PARK RIDGE CAMPUSES. THIS SYSTEM-WIDE PROGRAM USES A NATIONAL MODEL TO ENGAGE PARENTS AS PARTNERS WITH PHYSICIANS IN THEIR CHILDREN'S HEALTH. HEALTHY STEPS SPECIALISTS HELP BRIDGE THE TWO GROUPS BY PREPARING PARENTS TO TAKE AN ACTIVE ROLE IN, AND PHYSICIANS TO ASSESS AND MEET MORE EFFECTIVELY, A RANGE OF CHILD DEVELOPMENT NEEDS. IN 2013, 9,749 DEVELOPMENTAL SCREENINGS WERE PROVIDED AND 445 FAMILIES WERE REFERRED TO COMMUNITY SERVICES FOR FOLLOW UP. IN ADDITION, HEALTHY STEPS HAS COMPLETED AN INITIATIVE, IN COLLABORATION WITH THE ILLINOIS CHAPTER OF THE AMERICAN ACADEMY OF PEDIATRICS, TO TRAIN PRIMARY CARE PROVIDERS ACROSS THE STATE TO IMPROVE PREVENTIVE PRACTICES IN THEIR SITE AROUND TOPICS SUCH AS USE OF VALIDATED TOOLS FOR DEVELOPMENTAL AND FAMILY RISK FACTOR SCREENINGS (SUCH AS POSTPARTUM DEPRESSION, DOMESTIC VIOLENCE, TRAUMA, AND PSYCHOSOCIAL ISSUES) AND TEACH PRIMARY CARE PROVIDERS AND THEIR STAFF HOW TO REFER TO LOCAL COMMUNITY RESOURCES FOR FOLLOW-UP CARE. DURING 2013, ADVOCATE HEALTHY STEPS CONSULTANTS PROVIDED 179 PRESENTATIONS IN 57 PRIMARY CARE SITES, TO 740 PHYSICIANS AND THEIR STAFFS THROUGHOUT THE STATE OF ILLINOIS. THESE PROVIDERS CARE FOR APPROXIMATELY 154,835 CHILDREN BETWEEN BIRTH AND AGE THREE. CURRENTLY, HEALTHY STEPS IS FOCUSING ON DEVELOPMENTAL BEHAVIORAL MENTAL HEALTH TRAINING FOR PRIMARY CARE PROVIDERS. THE STAFF ALSO MEETS REGULARLY WITH APPROXIMATELY 20 COMMUNITY ORGANIZATIONS, AND WORK WITH PEDIATRIC AND FAMILY MEDICINE RESIDENCY PROGRAMS, PEDIATRIC NURSE PRACTITIONERS AND PHYSICIAN ASSISTANT PROGRAMS THROUGHOUT THE STATE. THE ADVOCATE CHILDHOOD TRAUMA TREATMENT PROGRAM (CTTP), A SYSTEM LEVEL, SYSTEM-WIDE INITIATIVE, OFFERS HOPE AND HEALING TO CHILDREN WHO HAVE EXPERIENCED MALTREATMENT, PSYCHOLOGICAL TRAUMA AND SEXUAL ABUSE. CLINICIANS WORK WITH A CHILD'S ENTIRE SUPPORT NETWORK - PARENTS, THE SCHOOL AND MORE - TO HELP FOSTER A SAFE ENVIRONMENT FOR THE CHILD. CTTP IS ONE OF JUST A HANDFUL OF PROGRAMS IN THE STATE THAT SPECIALIZES IN MENTAL HEALTH FOR CHILDREN. IN 2013, CTTP SERVED 171 CHILDREN AND ADOLESCENTS, AS WELL AS 420 ADULTS, CAREGIVERS, PARENTS AND OTHERS. IN ADDITION, THE PROGRAM HAS PARTNERED WITH ""DARKNESS TO LIGHT,"" A NATIONALLY RECOGNIZED CHILD SEXUAL ABUSE PREVENTION LEADER. AS A RESULT OF THIS PARTNERSHIP, THE CTTP HAS LAUNCHED A MAJOR ADULT EDUCATION PROGRAM CALLED ""STEWARDS OF CHILDREN/7 STEPS TO PROTECT A CHILD."" THIS PROGRAM HAS EDUCATED OVER 1,400 ADULTS AT SCHOOLS, CHURCHES, LAW ENFORCEMENT AGENCIES, CHILD WELFARE AGENCIES AND CIVIC ORGANIZATIONS, THEREBY BETTER PROTECTING 14,000 CHILDREN. SINCE 1995, ADVOCATE HEALTH CARE'S OFFICE FOR MISSION AND SPIRITUAL CARE HAS PROVIDED CLINICAL CHAPLAINS AND ETHICISTS THROUGHOUT ADVOCATE WHO OFFER SUPPORT AND SERVICES TO INDIVIDUALS AND FAMILIES FACING MEDICAL CRISIS. ADVOCATE'S SPIRITUAL LEADERS ALSO OVERSEE A NATIONALLY ACCREDITED CLINICAL PASTORAL EDUCATION PROGRAM. TRAINING"

THE CENTER FORMED IN 2009 OUT OF A GROWING CONCERN IN CHICAGO'S FAITH AND HEALTH MOVEMENT ABOUT THE WAYS IN WHICH SOCIAL CONDITIONS-POVERTY, RACISM, UNEMPLOYMENT, LACK OF ACCESS TO CARE-IMPACT PEOPLE'S HEALTH. THE CENTER WAS CREATED TO MOBILIZE FAITH COMMUNITIES TO CHANGE THE SOCIAL CONDITIONS THAT AFFECT PEOPLE'S HEALTH. THE CENTER ALSO HOSTS A WEBSITE THAT SERVES AS A GATHERING PLACE FOR THE FAITH AND HEALTH MOVEMENT TO SHARE INFORMATION, POST EVENTS, SHARE INTERESTING PROJECTS, SHARE RESOURCES AND IDEAS, AND KEEP IN TOUCH WITH WHAT OTHERS ARE DOING. GO TO WWW.CHICAGOFAITHANDHEALTH.ORG FOR MORE INFORMATION. ADVOCATE ALSO PROVIDES A SYSTEM-WIDE TELEPHONE REFERRAL AND RESOURCE INFORMATION CENTER TO ASSIST PATIENTS AND COMMUNITY MEMBERS IN FINDING HEALTHCARE PROVIDERS AND OTHER HEALTH AND WELLNESS RESOURCES. THE CENTER'S STAFF SERVES AS A COMMUNITY RESOURCE, PROVIDING INDIVIDUALS FROM THE COMMUNITY WITH REFERRALS TO GOVERNMENT-FUNDED AND COMMUNITY-BASED NON-ADVOCATE PROGRAMS AND SERVICES, AS WELL AS ADVOCATE HEALTH CARE PHYSICIANS AND SERVICES. GOAL 4: LEVERAGE RESOURCES AND MAXIMIZE COMMUNITY OUTREACH EFFORTS BY BUILDING AND STRENGTHENING COMMUNITY PARTNERSHIPS. ADVOCATE'S SYSTEM LEVEL LEADERS MAINTAIN AND CONTINUE TO ACTIVELY EXPAND SYSTEM PARTNERSHIPS AND RELATIONSHIPS WITH A WIDE VARIETY OF ORGANIZATIONS, INCLUDING RELIGIOUS ORGANIZATIONS, NEIGHBORHOOD GROUPS AND OUTREACH AND RESOURCE PROGRAMS. THESE RELATIONSHIPS SERVE TO LEVERAGE BOTH ADVOCATE'S AND ITS COMMUNITIES' RESOURCES TO MAXIMIZE COMMUNITY OUTREACH EFFORTS. ADVOCATE BUILDS ON RELATIONSHIPS THAT ASSOCIATES AND AFFILIATED PHYSICIANS HAVE WITH COMMUNITY HEALTH PARTNERS, AND TO EMPOWER THE DEVELOPMENT OF SUCH PARTNERSHIPS. AN EXAMPLE OF THIS IS ADVOCATE MEDICAL GROUP'S (ADVOCATE-EMPLOYED PHYSICIANS) ANNUAL COLLABORATION WITH SPECIAL OLYMPICS OF ILLINOIS. THIS EVENT, MEDFEST, PROVIDES PEOPLE WITH INTELLECTUAL DISABILITIES OPPORTUNITIES TO PARTICIPATE IN SPORTS TRAINING AND COMPETITIONS, CREATING AVENUES FOR INCLUSION AND ACCEPTANCE FOR THIS SPECIAL NEEDS UNDERSERVED POPULATION. IN ADDITION TO PROVIDING EASY ACCESS TO PHYSICALS FOR ATHLETES, THE FREE CLINICAL SERVICES RESULT IN ENHANCED PHYSICAL FITNESS AND COMFORT WITH THE MEDICAL COMMUNITY. DURING ITS 13TH SPONSORSHIP YEAR, AMG PROVIDED 1,550 FREE ATHLETIC PHYSICALS TO SPECIAL OLYMPIANS, ALLOWING THEM OPPORTUNITIES TO PARTICIPATE IN COMPETITIONS THROUGHOUT THE YEAR. SYSTEM LEVEL MANAGEMENT ALSO OVERSEES ASSOCIATE AND PHYSICIAN FUNDRAISING AND VOLUNTEER ACTIVITIES RELATED TO COMMUNITY ORGANIZATIONS AND PARTNERSHIPS. LAST YEAR ADVOCATE PROMOTED AND SUPPORTED ASSOCIATE, PHYSICIAN AND HOSPITAL PARTICIPATION IN WALKS, RUNS AND BICYCLE RACES FOR THE AMERICAN HEART ASSOCIATION, AMERICAN CANCER SOCIETY, AMERICAN DIABETES ASSOCIATION, ALZHEIMER'S ASSOCIATION AND MARCH OF DIMES. IN 2013, $565,192 IN CHARITABLE CONTRIBUTIONS WAS RAISED TO SUPPORT THESE PARTNER ORGANIZATIONS. ADVOCATE ASSOCIATES' SUPPORT OF THESE FUNDRAISERS AND THEIR GENEROUS CONTRIBUTIONS DURING THE 2013 ASSOCIATE GIVING CAMPAIGN RESULTED IN OVER $3.5 MILLION BEING RAISED TO SUPPORT MULTIPLE LOCAL COMMUNITY ORGANIZATIONS, PROGRAMS AND INITIATIVES, INCLUDING SOME OF ADVOCATE'S OWN SYSTEM-WIDE AND HOSPITAL-BASED COMMUNITY HEALTH PROGRAMS. SYSTEM MANAGEMENT OF FUNDRAISING ACTIVITIES REDUCES DUPLICATION OF EFFORT AND ASSURES THAT FUNDRAISING IS CONDUCTED WITH ORGANIZATIONS THAT ALIGN WITH ADVOCATE'S MISSION AND ARE EFFECTIVE IN ADDRESSING ADVOCATE'S SERVICE AREA'S COMMUNITY HEALTH NEEDS. THE ADVOCATE CHARITABLE FOUNDATION (ACF) WORKS TO FIND INNOVATIVE WAYS TO FUND NOT ONLY CLINICAL ADVANCEMENTS BUT COMMUNITY PROGRAMS THAT ADDRESS IDENTIFIED COMMUNITY NEEDS. ONE EXAMPLE OF THIS IS ACF'S ADMINISTRATION OF THE ADVOCATE BETHANY COMMUNITY HEALTH FUND. IN 2006, ADVOCATE HEALTH CARE ESTABLISHED THE BETHANY FUND AS PART OF ADVOCATE'S ONGOING COMMITMENT TO SUPPORT LOCAL NONPROFIT ORGANIZATIONS AS THEY BUILD, PROMOTE AND SUSTAIN HEALTHY COMMUNITIES ON CHICAGO'S WEST SIDE. THE ADVOCATE BETHANY COMMUNITY HEALTH FUND BOARD, WHICH IS COMPRISED OF EIGHT COMMUNITY MEMBERS FROM THE TARGETED COMMUNITY AREAS AND SEVEN REPRESENTATIVES FROM ADVOCATE HEALTH CARE, AWARDED MORE THAN $789,000 IN GRANTS AND CAPACITY-BUILDING SERVICES TO 33 ORGANIZATIONS ACROSS ITS FUND COMMUNITIES IN 2013. SINCE THE BOARD'S INSTALLATION IN 2007, THE BETHANY COMMUNITY HEALTH FUND HAS AWARDED NEARLY $6 MILLION IN PROGRAM DOLLARS AND SERVICES TO ORGANIZATIONS THAT PROMOTE HEALTH AND WELLNESS WITH A FOCUS ON ADDRESSING HEALTH DISPARITIES FOR RESIDENTS OF CHICAGO'S WEST SIDE. ADVOCATE HEALTH CARE HAS ALSO BEEN A KEY PARTNER IN THE NATIONAL COLLABORATIVE, THE HEALTH SYSTEMS LEARNING GROUP (HSLG), NOW KNOWN AS THE STAKEHOLDER HEALTH GROUP. THIS GROUP IS A SELF-ORGANIZED COLLABORATIVE OF 43 ORGANIZATIONS (INCLUDING 36 NON-PROFIT HEALTH SYSTEMS) THAT HAVE ENGAGED IN A SERIES OF MEETINGS ACROSS THE COUNTRY OVER THE PAST 2 YEARS. INSPIRED BY THE PASSAGE OF THE PATIENT PROTECTION AND AFFORDABLE CARE ACT, AND MOTIVATED BY THE RECOGNITION OF THE NEED TO TRANSFORM OUR ORGANIZATIONS AND OUR COMMUNITIES, THE GROUP MADE A COMMITMENT TO ACCELERATE THIS TRANSFORMATIONAL PROCESS THROUGH ONGOING SHARING OF INNOVATIVE PRACTICES THAT IMPROVE POPULATION HEALTH AND THE DEVELOPMENT OF COORDINATED STRATEGIES THAT TAKE INNOVATION TO SCALE. THE HEALTH SYSTEMS LEARNING GROUP ASPIRES TO IDENTIFY AND ACTIVATE A MENU OF PROVEN COMMUNITY HEALTH PRACTICES AND PARTNERSHIPS THAT WORK FROM THE TOP OF THE MISSION STATEMENT TO THE BOTTOM LINE. THE CREATION OF THIS LEARNING COLLABORATIVE WAS SPARKED BY A SERIES OF STAKEHOLDER MEETINGS AT THE WHITE HOUSE OFFICE AND DEPARTMENT OF HEALTH & HUMAN SERVICES CENTER FOR FAITH-BASED & NEIGHBORHOOD PARTNERSHIPS. THE HSLG PARTNERS HAVE CONTRIBUTED SUBSTANTIAL FINANCIAL AND IN-KIND RESOURCES TO SUPPORT THE 2 YEAR DEVELOPMENTAL PHASE. IN ADDITION, A GENEROUS GRANT WAS PROVIDED BY THE ROBERT WOOD JOHNSON FOUNDATION TO SUPPORT THE DISSEMINATION OF FINDINGS AND LESSONS LEARNED DURING THIS PERIOD. THE FIRST PHASE OF DEVELOPMENT FOR THE HSLG CULMINATED WITH A CONVENING ON APRIL 4, 2013 CO-HOSTED WITH THE WHITE HOUSE AND HHS CENTER FOR FAITH-BASED AND NEIGHBORHOOD PARTNERSHIPS, ALONG WITH THE CHIEF EXECUTIVE OFFICERS FROM MANY OF THE HEALTH SYSTEM PARTNERS. THE PURPOSE WAS TO REVIEW FINDINGS FROM THE PAST 18 MONTHS OF INQUIRY AND DIALOGUE AND TO CONSIDER A CALL TO ACTION ON A SPECIFIC SET OF RECOMMENDATIONS. SEE THE FOLLOWING LINK FOR THE MONOGRAPH PRESENTED AT THE MEETING. HTTP://WWW.METHODISTHEALTH.ORG/DOTASSET/9E6F77D8-DF4B-4545-B2F3-BC77B106F9 69.PDF GOAL 5: PROMOTE INTEGRATION OF AND ACCOUNTABILITY FOR SYSTEM AND SITE PLANS AND ACTIVITIES BY ENHANCING COORDINATION AND DEVELOPING GOVERNANCE RELATIONSHIPS. A CORE GROUP OF ADVOCATE SYSTEM-LEVEL LEADERS ACHIEVED INTEGRATION, ACCOUNTABILITY AND NEW GOVERNANCE RELATIONSHIPS THROUGH IMPLEMENTATION OF THE FOLLOWING. - STRENGTHENING THE ROLE/VISIBILITY OF THE COMMUNITY HEALTH LEADERSHIP COUNCIL -- A KEY FOCUS FOR THE SYSTEM CORE TEAM WAS TO STRENGTHEN THE ABILITY OF THE COMMUNITY HEALTH LEADERSHIP COUNCIL (CHLC) TO SERVE AS A RESOURCE AND PROVIDE GUIDANCE IN DEVELOPING AND IMPLEMENTING SYSTEM AND SITE COMMUNITY HEALTH PLANS. THE FOLLOWING ACTIONS WERE TAKEN TO REALIZE THIS OBJECTIVE - THE CHLC ROLE WAS DEFINED, A CHARTER APPROVED AND THE ROLE WAS COMMUNICATED AS APPROPRIATE WITHIN ADVOCATE AND IN THE COMMUNITY. MEETINGS WERE SCHEDULED MONTHLY TO ASSURE CLOSE COMMUNICATION AND ADHERENCE TO THE AMBITIOUS TIMELINE. - AS DESCRIBED EARLIER, THE COMMUNITY HEALTH STEERING COMMITTEE WAS CONVENED TO PLAN THE CHLC'S ACTIVITIES, I.E., SET AGENDAS, PROVIDE WORKSHOPS, TIMELINES AND DEADLINES TO ASSURE THE HOSPITALS AND THE SYSTEM MET THEIR GOALS AND WOULD BE FULLY COMPLIANT WITH THE PPACA. - REPORTING COMMUNITY HEALTH/COMMUNITY BENEFITS PLANNING, PROGRESS, AND ACHIEVEMENTS TO THE MISSION AND SPIRITUAL CARE COMMITTEE OF THE ADVOCATE BOARD OF DIRECTORS IN TANDEM WITH REPORTING COMMUNITY BENEFITS EXPENDITURES TO THE FINANCE COMMITTEE OF THE BOARD. - WHEN CONSIDERING WHICH GOVERNANCE BODY WOULD BE ACCOUNTABLE FOR REVIEWING AND ENDORSING THE HOSPITAL CHNA REPORTS AND IMPLEMENTATION PLANS, THE HOSPITAL GOVERNING COUNCILS WERE SELECTED GIVEN THEY ARE THE SENIOR GOVERNING BODY AT EACH HOSPITAL. ONE OR MORE MEMBERS OF THE HOSPITAL GOVERNING COUNCILS WERE ALSO RECRUITED TO PARTICIPATE ON THEIR SITE'S COMMUNITY HEALTH COUNCIL, SERVING AS BOTH A COMMUNITY REPRESENTATIVE HAVING INPUT INTO THE DECISIONS OF THE COMMUNITY HEALTH COUNCIL AND AS A GOVERNING COUNCIL MEMBER THAT COULD PROVIDE REPORTS ON COMMUNITY HEALTH PLAN PROGRESS BACK TO THE GOVERNING COUNCIL. THIS PROCESS WORKED WELL AND ADVOCATE POSTED ITS HOS"

Charity care is provided to those patients where the household income (defined as income for the patient and any related guarantor as listed on the most recent Federal Tax Return) is at 200% or below federal poverty guidelines as published annually by the Community Service Administration in the Federal Register and where there are not substantial cash convertible assets or disposable income. Charity is predicated on the patient seeking Medicaid eligibility and fully cooperating with hospital staff (provide bank statements, proof of income, etc). Medicaid eligibility may be reevaluated each month or in connection with new services provided during the approved charity period (6 months.) If a patient qualifies for Charity care assistance, 100% of the billable charges are eliminated."

201423189349300632,550525724,"Part III, Line 2 - Methodology Used To Estimate Bad Debt Expense","Accounts receivable, patients are reported at net realizable value. Accounts arewritten off when they are determined to be noncollectable based upon management'sassessment of individual accounts. The allowance for doubtful collections isestimated based upon a periodic review of the accounts receivable aging, payerclassifications, and application of historical write-off percentages.The estimated cost of services provided that ultimately result in bad debt expense are estimated utilizing the cost-to-charge ratio as determined by the filed cost report for the corresponding tax year related to this Form 990.UHCs cost of providing services to those patients that ultimately result in bad debt expense should be considered a community benefit because we are relieving a government burden by providing care to these patients without consideration for that patients ability to pay for these services. In the majority of cases, the determination of the patients ability to pay is not made until well after the services have been provided."

In evaluating the collectability of accounts receivable, the Corporation analyzes its past history and identifies trends for each of its major payor sources of revenue to estimate the appropriate allowance for doubtful accounts and provision for bad debts. Management regularly reviews data about these major payor sources of revenue in evaluating the sufficiency of the allowance for doubtful accounts. For receivables associated with services provided to patients who have third-party coverage, the Corporation analyzes contractually due amounts and provides an allowance for doubtful accounts and a provision for bad debts, if necessary. For receivables associated with self-pay patients (which includes both patients without insurance and patients with deductible and co-payment balances due for which third-party coverage exists for part of the bill), the Corporation records a provision for bad debts in the period of service on the basis of its past experience, which indicates that many patients are unable or unwilling to pay the portion of their bill for which they are financially responsible.

UH extends medical staff privileges to all qualified physicians in our community for all of the UH Departments.UH works with the Greater Augusta Healthcare Network (GAHN) which is made up of area hospitals and the local Medical Colleges School of Nursing and area primary care clinics. This group addresses the primary and specialty care needs in the community. UH supports the Project Access Program (PJA) in Richmond and Columbia County. PJA is a program whereby the local Medical Society Physicians agree to treat a number of Indigent county residents without payment. UH provides all of the Inpatient hospitalization for the Indigent population that is approved for Project Access. Through both of these groups UH is responsive to support them in their needs.UH provides many screenings in the community. One such screening is the PSA screening that is performed at Lowes Home Building stores. Many have received the screening and received positive results which were caught at an early stage. UH's Mobile Mammography unit travels to area plants and is available for screenings at the job site during lunch. These are only a few screening of the Screenings that UH provides in the community but have tremendous impact when just one screening identifies problems that can be treated at an early stage 1 cancer verses at the later stages of cancer.

They are also available to meet with patients during their stay if they have questions about their ability to pay for services and our financial assistance programs. 7. Notification of Determination. When a Presence Health hospital makes a determination that a patient's bill is discounted or adjusted based on a determination of financial need, the hospital notifies the patient of such eligibility determination and that there is no further collection action taken on the discounted portion of the patient's bill."
201403219349306015,362167800,"PART VI, 4: COMMUNITY INFORMATION","Presence Health provides services at 150 sites, including twelve acute care hospitals with a total of 2,997 staffed beds and over 90 primary and specialty care clinicS. These ministries offer a broad range of services from highly specialized tertiary services to an extended network of primary and ambulatory care. Presence Health has identified a separate service area for each of its acute care hospitals utilizing a consistent methodology and reflecting a combination of geographic location and market share criteria. The total service area of each ministry represents approximately 80% to 90% of the total inpatient discharges from that facility. The primary service area (the ""Primary Service Area"") of each facility represents approximately 65% to 75% of such discharges and the secondary service area (the ""Secondary Service Area"") of each facility represents approximately 15% to 25% of such discharges. The Primary Service Areas and Secondary Service Areas have been determined by utilizing a patient origin analysis to identify those zip codes that represent inpatient discharges. These zip codes are then mapped to identify geographic coverage of the Primary Service Areas and Secondary Service Areas. Many of the Presence Health hospital ministries facilities are located in population growth areas. Based upon population estimates and projections obtained from Claritas, Inc., the population of our hospitals' combined service area is expected to grow at a rate of 1.9% annually between 2012 and 2017, compared with a growth rate of 1.3% and 1.6% per year in the Chicago MSA and in Illinois, respectively. Of Presence's total service area population, 10.7% is over the age of 65, compared to 11.1% and 12.3% in the Chicago MSA and in Illinois, respectively. The Presence Saint Francis Hospital CHNA service area includes Evanston (60201, 60202, and 60203), Rogers Park (60626), and West Ridge (60645). The total population of zip codes 60201, 60202, 60203, 60626 and 60645 in 2010 was 201,419, making up the service area of PSFH. Demographics While the U.S. and Illinois population increased 10% and 3% respectively, the city of Chicago lost 7% of its population from 2000 to 2010. Similarly, Rogers Park lost 13% of its population during this time period. The population in Evanston and West Ridge remained relatively unchanged. Evanston (74,486) and West Ridge (71,942) have about the same size population, while Rogers Park has about 20,000 fewer residents than the other two communities. About a quarter of the population in all these communities is under 20 years of age, percentages that are quite similar to Chicago, Cook County, Illinois and the U.S. Between 8% (in zip code 60626-Rogers Park) and 12% (in Evanston) of the population are over 65. The largest racial group in Evanston is White (over 60%) with about 20% of the population identifying as Black and about 8% Hispanic/Latino. In West Ridge, the Asian and Hispanic/Latino population combined is slightly larger (44%) than the White population (40%). In Rogers Park both the Black and Hispanic/Latino populations each comprise about 25% of the total while the White proportion is near 40%. One in five of the residents in West Ridge are limited English speakers, compared to about 15% in Rogers Park and just over 5% in Evanston. While Spanish is the most common language spoken in all areas, West Ridge stands out for the diversity of languages spoken. Socioeconomic While the median income for West Ridge, at $47,323, is similar to Chicago as a whole, the median income for Rogers Park is considerably lower, at $39,482. The median income for Evanston is almost $20,000 more than for Chicago, at $68,107. As might be expected, only 10% of Evanston residents and 10% or less of Evanston children live below the poverty line. Fifteen percent of the residents and almost 25% of children in West Ridge live in poverty. In Rogers Park, 23% of residents and 37% of the children are living in poverty. Nearly half of Rogers Park residents are living below 200% of the FPL. Seventy percent or more of students receive free or reduced lunch in all schools in Rogers Park. Most schools in Evanston have 50% or less of students receiving free or reduced lunch, though there are higher rates in south Evanston. Only 6% of residents in Evanston lack a high school degree, compared with 18%-20% in Rogers Park and West Ridge. Almost two-thirds of Evanston residents over 25 have a college degree, compared to only one-third of Chicago residents. For the period 2006-2010, West Ridge had the highest unemployment rate at 7.9% followed by Rogers Park at 7.5% and Evanston at 6.8%. Access to Care The percentage of people uninsured in Chicago (19.8%) is higher than the national and state averages; the uninsured rate in Evanston (8.3%) is more than 10 percentage points lower than Chicago. About 30% of residents in the West Ridge and Rogers Park zip codes are enrolled in Medicaid. While the rates of self-pay among ER outpatients at PSFH were similar to the state (18% and 15% respectively), 45% of outpatients at PSFH were on Medicaid, compared to only 34% statewide. There were 3,839 requests for interpreters at PSFH in FY2011. Over half of the requests were for Spanish, which was the most common language spoken in these communities, followed by Russian. There were requests for a wide variety of language interpretation, with 60 different languages requested over the year. There are no primary care shortages in Evanston. However, Rogers Park has a shortage for all residents and West Ridge has a shortage for low-income residents. There is no shortage of mental health services in Evanston. However, like most of North Chicago, West Ridge and Rogers Park both have mental health shortages for low-income residents.

201403219349306015,362167800,"PART VI, 6: AFFILIATED HEALTH CARE SYSTEM","The Provena Health and Resurrection Health Care systems came together on November 1, 2011 to form a new health system, Presence Health, creating a comprehensive family of not-for-profit health care services and the single largest Catholic health system in Illinois. The name Presence Health embodies the act of being present in every moment we share with those we serve and is the cornerstone of a patient, resident and family-centered care environment. ""Presence"" Health embodies the way we choose to be present in our communities, as well as with one another and those we serve. Presence Health is sponsored by five congregations of Catholic religious women: the Franciscan Sisters of the Sacred Heart, the Servants of the Holy Heart of Mary, the Sisters of the Holy Family of Nazareth, Sisters of Mercy of the Americas and the Sisters of the Resurrection. As was the case from our very beginnings, Presence Health is called to be much more than just a provider of health services. Presence Health has instilled within all of its ministries that are committed to responding to the needs of those we are privileged to serve; delivering high quality care that is accessible to all. It is this culture of caring and giving that drives our diligent efforts to ensure we return the optimal value of our charitable assets to our local communities. As a not-for-profit health system, Presence Health invests its net gains from operations into the community through programs to serve vulnerable populations, such as the poor and uninsured, manage chronic conditions, and promote health education and promotion outreach and initiatives. In fiscal year 2013, this included $199 million in community benefit activities. Presence Health takes a systems approach to its community benefit efforts, and therefore ensures its member hospitals and other entities and affiliates are helping to promote and address the health needs of the communities they serve.

The document is being made widely available on the Ellis Medicine website http://www.ellismedicine.org/pages/community-report.aspx and as a paper copy for public inspection at the administrative office of Ellis Hospital (1101 Nott Street, Schenectady, New York 12308) as of November 15, 2013.Development of this assessment and plan has been a unique undertaking for the Schenectady healthcare and human services community. The document, a consolidated, multi-year, multi-agency, community-wide plan for action to improve the health of people in Schenectady, New York is the result of the combined efforts of 62 organizations. The Schenectady Coalition for a Healthy Community, informed by multiple credible data sources including a door-to-door survey of community residents, developed this assessment and plan to serve the people of the City and County of Schenectady.Three of the top priorities identified in Schenectady are consistent with the three Prevention Agenda priorities of the other Capital Region counties; Albany and Rensselaer. This consistency will enable consideration of a Region-wide approach to implementation strategies.Central to this assessment and plan, the UMatter Schenectady survey consisted of more than 280 questions and was administered to over 2,000 residents of the City of Schenectady between February and May 2013 by Community Health Workers and volunteer college students. In addition to the survey results, this plan was informed by secondary data from such sources as the U.S. Census and the New York State Department of Health, and from specialized data sources including a recent federally-funded study of diabetes in Schenectadys West Indian population.All told, between November 2012 and October 2013 the Coalition held 28 meetings of healthcare experts, representatives of community interests, and community residents; utilizing government-recommended group-voting techniques to compile a list of 20 significant community health needs, and to prioritize five of these as most requiring community-wide corrective action over the next three years."
201423189349303312,141338428,Part VI - Patient Education of Eligibility for Assistance,"Ellis Medicine provides financial assistance information about programs available to assist patients in paying for their bills, including discount programs and charity care, on its external website (www.ellismedicine.org) (specifically at http://www.ellismedicine.org/financial-assistance/faqs.aspx), in readily available and publicly distributed brochures, and through flyers and posters visible throughout the organization. Applications for financial assistance are available online at the Ellis website. Additionally, Ellis employs Financial Advocates who assist patients in determining the availability of and their eligibility for free or low-cost care, and then assist them with completing the necessary paperwork. Since 2009, Ellis Medicine has included affirmative financial assistance outreach as part of the innovative Medical Home through which it aims to increase access to care and provide healthcare navigation services to patients (especially the underserved and uninsured / underinsured), including education about and assistance with charity care and financial assistance services. Prior to creation of the health insurance enrollment programs by the Patient Protection and Affordable Care Act of 2010 (PPACA), Ellis offered Medicaid enrollment through employees deputized by the Schenectady County Department of Social Services, through Facilitated Enrollers employed by the not-for-profit Health Capital District Initiative (HCDI), and through Fidelis, one of New Yorks not-for-profit Medicaid Managed Care Organizations. Starting in 2013, Ellis arranged for on-site services of Health Insurance Navigators engaged by all four not-for-profit organizations designated pursuant to the PPACA. Navigators saw uninsured residents at both the Nott Street and Ellis Health Center Campuses. Ellis employees also completed training as Certified Application Counselors (CACs) and are qualified to help people enroll both in Medicaid as well as in Exchange insurance products.Additionally, Ellis publicizes its Financial Call Center & Information Line (sharing with our 3,300 employees; our local, state and federal lawmakers offices in case they receive constituent inquiries related to hospital costs and/or financial services at Ellis; and the general public), highlighting a number to call (518-243-1695) through which patients can receive information about how much their care will cost at Ellis Medicine as a way to be transparent and helpful in providing this information, as more and more patients are paying higher deductibles and are concerned about the cost to them out-of-pocket. This is particularly significant in Ellis Primary Service Area, as the largest local employer has converted to a high-deductible health insurance plan for most of its employees.Ellis has also participated in health fairs and employer information functions to advise small businesses and their employees of Ellis Financial Call Center & Information Line. Ellis Call Center has trained specialists who can help enroll qualifying patients in Financial Assistance programs, estimate a patients out-of-pocket expenses based on their medical plan, provide pricing for procedures and tests at Ellis Medicine and assist patients in completing Medicaid applications when applicable. Ellis Information Line helps with physician referrals, scheduling outpatient testing and providing general information about programs and services at Ellis Medicine."
201423189349303312,141338428,Part VI - Community Information,"In accordance with industry standards, Ellis Hospitals community is defined as the hospitals Primary and Secondary Service Areas, accounting for 80% of the hospitals discharge volume. These include all or portions of Schenectady, Saratoga, Albany, Fulton, and Montgomery counties and are comprised of 22 zip codes. Since the State-mandated consolidation of Schenectadys hospitals, Ellis has become the sole provider of acute hospital care in Schenectady County, and it is the largest hospital within its Service Areas.The Primary Service Area is focused on the City of Schenectady, an older industrial city with a population of about 60,000, a substantial decline from the 1940 high of over 90,000. According to the City of Schenectadys 2010-2014 Consolidated Plan, 67% of households in the city are considered low or moderate income, while the poverty rate in the Hamilton Hill neighborhood, adjacent to Ellis Hospital, is over 28%. Nearly all (95%) of the Citys housing stock was built before 1978, and Schenectady neighborhoods have been identified as having among the highest concentration of elevated blood levels for lead in New York State.An impact of the level of poverty in the City of Schenectady has been the extent to which Ellis patients are either covered by government health programs or are uninsured. During 2013, Medicare patients accounted for 40.8% of inpatient discharges, 30.1% of outpatient visits, and 35.5% of net patient revenues before bad debts. Medicaid covered 21.0% of inpatient discharges, 27.4% of outpatient visits, and 16.3% of net patient revenues before bad debts. Uninsured patients accounted for 3.8% of inpatient discharges and 5.6% of outpatient visits, and 1.7% of net patient revenues before bad debts. Overall, uninsured or government insured patients made up 65.6% of inpatient discharges and 63.1% of outpatient visits, while generating 53.5% of net patient revenues before bad debts.There is one Medically Underserved Population (MUP) within Ellis Primary Service Area. The homebound population of Schenectady County is designated MUP 06211. In response, physicians on the staff of the Ellis Family Health Center make house calls, and residents in the hospitals Family Medicine Residency may include house calls in their training. During 2013, two Health Professions Shortage Areas (HPSA) were re-designated in the City of Schenectady: the entire City is now identified as an HPSA for Dental and Mental Health services. The Primary Care HPSAs remain limited to a small number of Census Tracts in the Hamilton Hill/Mont Pleasant neighborhoods.The Secondary Service Area is a much wider geographic area, including rural and farming communities, as well as affluent suburbs. Overall, the combined Service Areas represent a study in contrasts. A nearly equal number of people have incomes below $25,000 as above $100,000. Health status variations are similarly dramatic. For example, according to the New York State Department of Health the rates of asthma-related hospital admissions per 10,000 people vary from 458 in the 12307 ZIP code to 49 in the 12309 ZIP code, a distance of about five miles.Census data for the combined Primary and Secondary Service Areas for 2013 estimate a total population of 377,974. This is projected to increase to 380,182 by 2018. The 2013 median income was $62,648 while the mean income was $73,485, demonstrating the impact of outliers. The gender distribution is 49% male and 51% female. Twenty-one percent of the population has a bachelors degree or higher. There will, however, likely be increased need for healthcare services as the community ages. The greatest increase in population from 2013 to 2018 is expected to be in the 65 and over age range (2.08%), while the greatest decrease is expected in the 35-54 age range (2.43%)."
201423189349303312,141338428,Part VI - Community Building Activities,"Ellis Medicine (the trade name for Ellis Hospital) successfully restructured healthcare services following the New York State-mandated hospital consolidation in Schenectady in 2007-2008, and has since been working to improve the efficiency and effectiveness of services to its community by aligning its innovative approaches to community health with the services provided by other local community-based public and not-for-profit organizations. Ellis is now the sole acute care hospital in Schenectady County, and is one of the largest primary care providers, having assumed responsibility for the services of two former hospitals which closed during the States rightsizing process. In this important role, Ellis has engaged the community and developed coalitions with community partners in order to ensure access to a full range of healthcare services, with special attention paid to disadvantaged members of our community. Ellis has undertaken and is planning a number of significant capital projects to consolidate care, enhance access to care, and improve the overall quality, efficiency, and cost-effectiveness of our local healthcare system. One of Ellis Medicines key community building activities is Care Central, a community-focused, multi-partner, care management program derived from Ellis original Medical Home initiative, which is a central location for primary care and outpatient services on a single campus aimed at improving access to healthcare, especially among the uninsured and underinsured. The Ellis Medical Home offers primary care (adult and pediatric), dental care, outpatient child/adolescent mental health services, diabetes education, and emergency services along with a number of outpatient services such as medical imaging, laboratory, a sleep disorders center, wound care, and day surgery. The Medical Home features specially trained Health Services Navigators, one an Ellis employee and the other contracted from Schenectady County Public Health Services, and a Community Services Navigator, a counselor employed by the local community action agency, who help patients connect to the healthcare and social services programs they need, including Medicaid facilitated enrollment services, and a free Community Shuttle which provides transportation from a number of community sites including homeless shelters and soup kitchens to the healthcare campus. The Medical Home is an effective partnership among Ellis Medicine and numerous community groups, including the Schenectady Community Action Program, the Salvation Army, the City Mission, YWCA, YMCA, Schenectady City School District, and Schenectady County Public Health Services, among other social service and community agencies.The success of the Medical Home in building community coalitions helped lead to a successful application by a community partnership for designation by the New York State Department of Health as one of the first three upstate Medicaid Health Homes. The Health Home program, which was established by the Patient Protection and Affordable Care Act (PPACA) of 2010 and conforming State law, is intended to provide a comprehensive array of healthcare and community support services to Medicaid patients with designated high-cost conditions. New York State has chosen to initially focus on patients with multiple chronic conditions, behavioral health issues, and/or HIV/AIDS. A coalition of over 40 healthcare and community agencies led by Ellis, the Visiting Nurse Service of Schenectady and Saratoga Counties, Inc., and Hometown Health (the Schenectady FQHC) now provides comprehensive care management services to high risk Medicaid patients in Schenectady County.A third component of Care Central is a Medicare Community-based Care Transitions Program (CCTP) which serves patients discharged from ten different hospitals in a ten-county region. Ellis is the largest participating hospital.Another example of Ellis coalition building activities is its participation in the Schenectady County Public Health Services federally funded Strategic Alliance for Health (SAH), which brings together a host of healthcare and community organizations to address chronic disease and to promote disease prevention and wellness. An Ellis representative participates in regular meetings of the SAH board. Ellis also works closely with the Schenectady County Public Health Services and the Healthy Capital District Initiative (HCDI) to assess community needs and to develop both the federally-required Community Health Needs Assessment and the State-required Community Service Plan (CSP) to identify health priorities (see Part V).Additionally, Ellis partners with a number of community partners, such as the American Cancer Society and the YWCA, to provide health screenings to uninsured and underinsured populations in our service area. Ellis provides office space and other in-kind support for the State-sponsored Schenectady County Cancer Services Program. In collaboration with community partners, Ellis offers outpatient smoking cessation courses and sponsors peer-driven mental health and cancer patient support groups. And, Ellis cooperates with community groups to facilitate access to healthy foods for people through the community. In past years, acting in collaboration with the Schenectady County Planning Department and the Cooperative Extension, Ellis hosted a weekly Farmers Market in the parking lot of the Ellis Health Center during the summer months. Starting in 2013, physicians at the Family Health Center began prescribing fresh vegetables to at-risk patients as part of a foundation-funded grant program. The prescription constitutes a voucher for no-charge locally-grown vegetables which are distributed at a farm stand located at the Ellis Health Center.Medical residents from the Ellis Family Medicine Residency donate their time and expertise to staff two free community-based medical clinics. A weekly clinic at the Schenectady City Mission serves uninsured, homeless individuals in the City of Schenectady. And a rural seasonal clinic provides care to uninsured migrant workers in collaboration with the Columbia County Department of Health.Ellis staffs a Green Team that works to promote recycling and other eco-friendly practices throughout the organization. Ellis staff members also sit on numerous community boards and healthcare coalitions to target improvements in such areas as diabetes, long term care, cancer, hospital readmission rates, and healthy living."
201423189349303312,141338428,Part VI - Explanation Of How Organization Furthers Its Exempt Purpose,"Ellis Medicine furthers its exempt purpose by promoting the health of the community through:A volunteer Board of Trustees that is comprised of community members, medical staff members and hospital administrators who serve three year terms, up to a three term maximum. Currently, the Ellis Board is comprised of 23 trustees 18 non-physician citizens of the community, four physicians, and one senior hospital administrator (the hospitals President and CEO). Ellis does not have a parent corporation.An open medical staff consisting of approximately 595 affiliated physicians and other providers. Medical privileges at Ellis Hospital are available to all qualified physicians in the area. Approximately 230 physicians and other providers are employed by Ellis, including 30 residents participating in the Family Medicine Residency and three in the General Dental Residency. Ellis medical staff is led by a Medical-Dental Executive Committee (MDEC). The MDEC plays an integral part in the hospitals corporate structure and daily operations. The MDEC and the department chairs, who oversee specific clinical services, work collaboratively with the hospitals volunteer Board of Trustees, administrators, and staff to ensure the highest quality of care is delivered to patients and that the community's healthcare needs are met with excellence. Physicians also serve as members of the hospitals Board of Trustees, and they are directly involved in the hospitals annual budget process: they rank and prioritize all capital items in the hospitals capital budget and they sign off on volume projections for the hospitals annual operating budget.Operation of two, full service, fully staffed emergency rooms on two separate Schenectady campuses, both of which are open 24 hours-a-day, seven days-a-week, 365 days-a-year, along with 24/7 emergent care services now available for the first time in Southern Saratoga County. Ellis emergency rooms care for all those in need of emergency care regardless of their ability to pay. Similarly, Ellis Hospitals admission policy is not restrictive. Ellis does not deny admission to any patient based on his/her ability to pay. The work of The Foundation for Ellis Medicine, a 501 (c) (3) tax-exempt charitable organization whose sole purpose is to encourage philanthropic support for Ellis Hospital. The Ellis Hospital Foundation was established in 1982 and is governed by a separate board of trustees. Funds raised through the Foundations activities are used to assist the hospital in acquiring state-of-the-art medical equipment and support a wide range of health care programs and services. Reinvesting its surplus funds to expand/replace/modernize its facilities and medical equipment; support programs/activities aimed at improving quality of care and patient safety; train and educate its medical and nursing staffs; and to improve the overall delivery of and accessibility to health care services in the community.Ellis Medicine demonstrates leadership as a charitable institution by organizing and participating in communitywide efforts for the needy; reaching out to the underserved to provide needed primary and preventative healthcare services and health education, especially through its Medical Home; attracting and using funds to serve the needy; participating in Medicaid and other federal, state, and local healthcare reimbursement programs for the needy such as Child Health Plus; and formally planning for and providing charity care and maintaining a policy of administering care to all persons in need.Ellis Medicine is accountable to the community by having a volunteer governing board comprised of members of the Schenectady community; inviting and responding to community input and involvement in planning and review of hospital activities; voluntarily disclosing information to the public on hospital services, financial status, community benefit activities and charity care; and advocating for healthcare cost containment and promoting the efficient use of healthcare resources within the community."

THIS COLLABORATIVE GROUP MET FROM THE FALL OF 2008 THROUGH AUGUST OF 2009, AND SELECTED TOBACCO USE AND UNINTENTIONAL INJURY AS THE TWO HEALTH PRIORITIES IDENTIFIED IN THE NEW YORK STATE PREVENTION AGENDA TOWARD THE HEALTHIEST STATE.SMOKING CESSATION WAS SELECTED BECAUSE THE USE OF TOBACCO IS THE NUMBER ONE UNDERLYING RISK FACTOR FOR MULTIPLE DISEASES. MOREOVER, NASSAU AND SUFFOLK COUNTIES SUFFER FROM SOME OF THE HIGHEST MORTALITY RATES FROM HEART DISEASE IN NEW YORK STATE. UNINTENTIONAL INJURIES WAS SELECTED AS A PRIORITY GIVEN THE FACT THAT SUFFOLK COUNTY HAS A RELATIVELY HIGH MORTALITY RATE FOR UNINTENTIONAL INJURIES WHEN COMPARED TO NEW YORK STATE AND NATIONALLY. THE GROUP ALSO AGREED THAT GIVEN THE SHORTAGE OF RESOURCES AVAILABLE TO ADVANCE PUBLIC HEALTH AGENDAS, IT WAS IMPORTANT TO SELECT PRIORITIES THAT COULD BUILD ON PROGRAMS THAT ARE ALREADY IN PLACE.BOTH SMOKING CESSATION AND PROGRAMS TO REDUCE UNINTENTIONAL INJURIES ACCOMPLISH THIS GOAL. ONE OF THE PRIORITY INITIATIVES FOR THE SUFFOLK COUNTY OFFICE OF HEALTH EDUCATION IS TO DEVELOP AND IMPLEMENT EFFECTIVE ANTI-SMOKING PROGRAMS THAT WILL REDUCE THE RATE OF TOBACCO USE IN SCHOOL-AGED CHILDREN. IN ADDITION, MANY OF THE HOSPITALS IN SUFFOLK COUNTY, INCLUDING PECONIC BAY MEDICAL CENTER HAVE PROGRAMS AND SUPPORT GROUPS IN PLACE TO WORK WITH THEIR EMPLOYEES AND COMMUNITY BASED ORGANIZATIONS TO REDUCE SMOKING. COMMUNITY BASED PROGRAMS AUGMENT COUNTY AND HOSPITAL EFFORTS IN REDUCING TOBACCO USE. THE TOBACCO ACTION COALITION AND HEALTHY MOTHERS/HEALTHY BABY COALITION WILL BE SOUGHT OUT TO ENGAGE IN COLLABORATIVE EFFORTS AS WELL.THERE ARE ALSO A NUMBER OF EXISTING PROGRAMS IN SUFFOLK COUNTY THAT HAVE DEVELOPED STRATEGIES FOR REDUCING THE INCIDENCE OF UNINTENTIONAL INJURIES. THE COUNTY'S BUREAU OF PUBLIC HEALTH NURSING PROVIDES HOME HEALTH CARE SERVICES FOR PATIENTS SUFFERING THE SEQUELAE OF UNINTENTIONAL INJURIES. THE COUNTY ALSO PROVIDES EDUCATION AND SUPPORT TO MOTHERS AND CHILDREN AIMED AT PREVENTING INJURIES FROM BURNS. A PARTNERSHIP BETWEEN ST. JOSEPHS COLLEGE AND THE SUFFOLK COUNTY DEPARTMENT OF HEALTH SERVICES HAS HELP IDENTIFY THE APPROPRIATE TARGET POPULATION FOR EDUCATION AND INTERVENTIONS TO REDUCE THESE INJURIES. FINALLY, ARTICLE 6 FUNDS CAN BE USED BY THE SUFFOLK COUNTY HEALTH DEPARTMENT CONSISTENT WITH NEW YORK STATE'S HEALTH AGENDA TO REDUCE THESE INJURIES.THESE TWO PRIORITIES WILL BE A MAJOR OPERATIONAL COMMITMENT OF PECONIC BAY MEDICAL CENTER OVER THE NEXT THREE YEARS. THE MEDICAL CENTER WILL CONTINUE TO COLLABORATE WITH THE SUFFOLK COUNTY DEPARTMENT OF HEALTH AND COMMUNITY PARTNERS IN ENSURING THAT WE REACH THE GOALS SET FOR THESE TWO PRIORITY AREAS, MEASURE PROGRESS IN ACHIEVING THESE GOALS AND ELIMINATING RACIAL, ETHNIC AND SOCIOECONOMIC HEALTH DISPARITIES WHERE THEY EXIST.ONCE THE PLANNING GROUP ADOPTED THESE PRIORITIES, REPRESENTATIVES FROM THE SUFFOLK COUNTY DEPARTMENT OF HEALTH, SUFFOLK COUNTY HOSPITALS, INCLUDING PECONIC BAY MEDICAL CENTER AND COMMUNITY REPRESENTATIVES DIVIDED INTO TWO WORK GROUPS.

THE PATIENT'S INCOME WAS COMPARED TO HSS FINANCIAL ASSISTANCE'S ""SLIDING SCALE"" TO DETERMINE IF THE PATIENT WOULD HAVE BEEN QUALIFIED FOR A DISCOUNT HAD THEY APPLIED FOR FINANCIAL ASSISTANCE. FAMILY SIZE WAS ASSUMED USING THE PATIENT'S MARITAL STATUS AND AGE. 81% OF INPATIENTS ACCOUNTS AND 75% OF OUTPATIENT ACCOUNTS WOULD HAVE QUALIFIED FOR DISCOUNTS. THUS BASED ON THE METHODOLOGY IT IS REASONABLE TO ASSERT THAT THIS PORTION OF BAD DEBT BE CONSIDERED A COMMUNITY BENEFIT. THE UNCOMPENSATED CARE TEXT OF THE FOOTNOTE TO THE ORGANIZATION'S FINANCIAL STATEMENT STATES, ""AS A MATTER OF POLICY, THE HOSPITAL PROVIDES SIGNIFICANT AMOUNTS OF PARTIALLY OR TOTALLY UNCOMPENSATED PATIENT CARE. FOR ACCOUNTING PURPOSES, SUCH UNCOMPENSATED CARE IS TREATED EITHER AS CHARITY CARE UNDER THE HOSPITAL'S FINANCIAL ASSISTANCE POLICY OR AS BAD DEBT EXPENSE. THE HOSPITAL'S FINANCIAL ASSISTANCE POLICY ENSURES THE PROVISION OF QUALITY HEALTH CARE TO THE COMMUNITY SERVED WHILE CAREFULLY CONSIDERING AND TAKING INTO ACCOUNT THE ABILITY OF THE PATIENT TO PAY. THE HOSPITAL'S FINANCIAL ASSISTANCE PROGRAM'S ELIGIBILITY THRESHOLD IS 500% OF THE FEDERAL POVERTY GUIDELINES, WHICH IS IN EXCESS OF THE NEW YORK STATE MINIMUM REQUIREMENTS OF 300%. THE HOSPITAL HAS DEFINED CHARITY CARE FOR ACCOUNTING AND DISCLOSURE PURPOSES AS THE DIFFERENCE BETWEEN ITS CUSTOMARY CHARGES AND THE DISCOUNTED RATES GIVEN TO PATIENTS IN NEED OF FINANCIAL ASSISTANCE. AS THE COLLECTION OF AMOUNTS DETERMINED TO QUALIFY AS CHARITY IS NOT PURSUED, SUCH AMOUNTS ARE NOT REPORTED AS REVENUE. PATIENTS WHO DO NOT QUALIFY FOR DISCOUNTED FEES ARE BILLED AT THE HOSPITAL'S ESTABLISHED CHARGES. UNCOLLECTED BALANCES FOR THESE PATIENTS ARE CATEGORIZED AS BAD DEBTS. TOTAL UNCOMPENSATED CARE IN 2013 AND 2012 FOR ALL PATIENT SERVICES AGGREGATED APPROXIMATELY $11.5 MILLION AND $9.7 MILLION RESPECTIVELY. IN ADDITION, THE HOSPITAL OPERATES ITS CLINICS AT A LOSS, TO HELP MEET THE NEEDS OF LOW INCOME AND UNINSURED INDIVIDUALS, AND ALSO OPERATES NUMEROUS OUTREACH AND EDUCATION PROGRAMS WHICH BENEFIT THE COMMUNITIES IT SERVES."""

201403219349303590,221494442,"SCHEDULE H, PART III, SECTION B; QUESTION 8","MEDICARE COSTS WERE DERIVED FROM THE 2013 MEDICARE COST REPORT. MEDICARE UNDERPAYMENTS AND BAD DEBT ARE COMMUNITY BENEFIT AND ASSOCIATED COSTS ARE INCLUDABLE ON THE FORM 990, SCHEDULE H, PART I. THE ORGANIZATION FEELS THAT MEDICARE UNDERPAYMENTS (SHORTFALL) AND BAD DEBT ARE COMMUNITY BENEFIT AND ASSOCIATED COSTS ARE INCLUDABLE ON THE FORM 990, SCHEDULE H, PART I. AS OUTLINED MORE FULLY BELOW THE ORGANIZATION BELIEVES THAT THESE SERVICES AND RELATED COSTS PROMOTE THE HEALTH OF THE COMMUNITY AS A WHOLE AND ARE RENDERED IN CONJUNCTION WITH THE ORGANIZATION'S CHARITABLE TAX-EXEMPT PURPOSES AND MISSION IN PROVIDING MEDICALLY NECESSARY HEALTHCARE SERVICES TO ALL INDIVIDUAL'S IN A NON-DISCRIMINATORY MANNER WITHOUT REGARD TO RACE, COLOR, CREED, SEX, NATIONAL ORIGIN, RELIGION OR ABILITY TO PAY AND CONSISTENT WITH THE COMMUNITY BENEFIT STANDARD PROMULGATED BY THE IRS. THE COMMUNITY BENEFIT STANDARD IS THE CURRENT STANDARD FOR A HOSPITAL FOR RECOGNITION AS A TAX-EXEMPT AND CHARITABLE ORGANIZATION UNDER INTERNAL REVENUE CODE (""IRC"") 501(C)(3). THE ORGANIZATION IS RECOGNIZED AS A TAX-EXEMPT ENTITY AND CHARITABLE ORGANIZATION UNDER 501(C)(3) OF THE IRC. ALTHOUGH THERE IS NO DEFINITION IN THE TAX CODE FOR THE TERM ""CHARITABLE"" A REGULATION PROMULGATED BY THE DEPARTMENT OF THE TREASURY PROVIDES SOME GUIDANCE AND STATES THAT ""[T]HE TERM CHARITABLE IS USED IN SECTION 501(C)(3) IN ITS GENERALLY ACCEPTED LEGAL SENSE,"" AND PROVIDES EXAMPLES OF CHARITABLE PURPOSES, INCLUDING THE RELIEF OF THE POOR OR UNPRIVILEGED; THE PROMOTION OF SOCIAL WELFARE; AND THE ADVANCEMENT OF EDUCATION, RELIGION, AND SCIENCE. NOTE IT DOES NOT EXPLICITLY ADDRESS THE ACTIVITIES OF HOSPITALS. IN THE ABSENCE OF EXPLICIT STATUTORY OR REGULATORY REQUIREMENTS APPLYING THE TERM ""CHARITABLE"" TO HOSPITALS, IT HAS BEEN LEFT TO THE IRS TO DETERMINE THE CRITERIA HOSPITALS MUST MEET TO QUALIFY AS IRC 501(C)(3) CHARITABLE ORGANIZATIONS. THE ORIGINAL STANDARD WAS KNOWN AS THE CHARITY CARE STANDARD. THIS STANDARD WAS REPLACED BY THE IRS WITH THE COMMUNITY BENEFIT STANDARD WHICH IS THE CURRENT STANDARD. CHARITY CARE STANDARD IN 1956, THE IRS ISSUED REVENUE RULING 56-185, WHICH ADDRESSED THE REQUIREMENTS HOSPITALS NEEDED TO MEET IN ORDER TO QUALIFY FOR IRC 501(C)(3) STATUS. ONE OF THESE REQUIREMENTS IS KNOWN AS THE ""CHARITY CARE STANDARD."" UNDER THE STANDARD, A HOSPITAL HAD TO PROVIDE, TO THE EXTENT OF ITS FINANCIAL ABILITY, FREE OR REDUCED-COST CARE TO PATIENTS UNABLE TO PAY FOR IT. A HOSPITAL THAT EXPECTED FULL PAYMENT DID NOT, ACCORDING TO THE RULING, PROVIDE CHARITY CARE BASED ON THE FACT THAT SOME PATIENTS ULTIMATELY FAILED TO PAY. THE RULING EMPHASIZED THAT A LOW LEVEL OF CHARITY CARE DID NOT NECESSARILY MEAN THAT A HOSPITAL HAD FAILED TO MEET THE REQUIREMENT SINCE THAT LEVEL COULD REFLECT ITS FINANCIAL ABILITY TO PROVIDE SUCH CARE. THE RULING ALSO NOTED THAT PUBLICLY SUPPORTED COMMUNITY HOSPITALS WOULD NORMALLY QUALIFY AS CHARITABLE ORGANIZATIONS BECAUSE THEY SERVE THE ENTIRE COMMUNITY, AND A LOW LEVEL OF CHARITY CARE WOULD NOT AFFECT A HOSPITAL'S EXEMPT STATUS IF IT WAS DUE TO THE SURROUNDING COMMUNITY'S LACK OF CHARITABLE DEMANDS. COMMUNITY BENEFIT STANDARD IN 1969, THE IRS ISSUED REVENUE RULING 69-545, WHICH ""REMOVE[D]"" FROM REVENUE RULING 56-185 ""THE REQUIREMENTS RELATING TO CARING FOR PATIENTS WITHOUT CHARGE OR AT RATES BELOW COST."" UNDER THE STANDARD DEVELOPED IN REVENUE RULING 69-545, WHICH IS KNOWN AS THE ""COMMUNITY BENEFIT STANDARD,"" HOSPITALS ARE JUDGED ON WHETHER THEY PROMOTE THE HEALTH OF A BROAD CLASS OF INDIVIDUALS IN THE COMMUNITY. THE RULING INVOLVED A HOSPITAL THAT ONLY ADMITTED INDIVIDUALS WHO COULD PAY FOR THE SERVICES (BY THEMSELVES, PRIVATE INSURANCE, OR PUBLIC PROGRAMS SUCH AS MEDICARE), BUT OPERATED A FULL-TIME EMERGENCY ROOM THAT WAS OPEN TO EVERYONE. THE IRS RULED THAT THE HOSPITAL QUALIFIED AS A CHARITABLE ORGANIZATION BECAUSE IT PROMOTED THE HEALTH OF PEOPLE IN ITS COMMUNITY. THE IRS REASONED THAT BECAUSE THE PROMOTION OF HEALTH WAS A CHARITABLE PURPOSE ACCORDING TO THE GENERAL LAW OF CHARITY, IT FELL WITHIN THE ""GENERALLY ACCEPTED LEGAL SENSE"" OF THE TERM ""CHARITABLE,"" AS REQUIRED BY TREAS. REG. 1.501(C)(3)-1(D)(2). THE IRS RULING STATED THAT THE PROMOTION OF HEALTH, LIKE THE RELIEF OF POVERTY AND THE ADVANCEMENT OF EDUCATION AND RELIGION, IS ONE OF THE PURPOSES IN THE GENERAL LAW OF CHARITY THAT IS DEEMED BENEFICIAL TO THE COMMUNITY AS A WHOLE EVEN THOUGH THE CLASS OF BENEFICIARIES ELIGIBLE TO RECEIVE A DIRECT BENEFIT FROM ITS ACTIVITIES DOES NOT INCLUDE ALL MEMBERS OF THE COMMUNITY, SUCH AS INDIGENT MEMBERS OF THE COMMUNITY, PROVIDED THAT THE CLASS IS NOT SO SMALL THAT ITS RELIEF IS NOT OF BENEFIT TO THE COMMUNITY. THE IRS CONCLUDED THAT THE HOSPITAL WAS ""PROMOTING THE HEALTH OF A CLASS OF PERSONS THAT IS BROAD ENOUGH TO BENEFIT THE COMMUNITY"" BECAUSE ITS EMERGENCY ROOM WAS OPEN TO ALL AND IT PROVIDED CARE TO EVERYONE WHO COULD PAY, WHETHER DIRECTLY OR THROUGH THIRD-PARTY REIMBURSEMENT. OTHER CHARACTERISTICS OF THE HOSPITAL THAT THE IRS HIGHLIGHTED INCLUDED THE FOLLOWING: ITS SURPLUS FUNDS WERE USED TO IMPROVE PATIENT CARE, EXPAND HOSPITAL FACILITIES, AND ADVANCE MEDICAL TRAINING, EDUCATION, AND RESEARCH; IT WAS CONTROLLED BY A BOARD OF TRUSTEES THAT CONSISTED OF INDEPENDENT CIVIC LEADERS; AND HOSPITAL MEDICAL STAFF PRIVILEGES WERE AVAILABLE TO ALL QUALIFIED PHYSICIANS. MEDICARE UNDERPAYMENTS AND BAD DEBT ARE COMMUNITY BENEFIT AND ASSOCIATED COSTS ARE INCLUDABLE ON THE FORM 990, SCHEDULE H, PART I. THE AMERICAN HOSPITAL ASSOCIATION (""AHA"") FEELS THAT MEDICARE UNDERPAYMENTS (SHORTFALL) AND BAD DEBT ARE COMMUNITY BENEFIT AND THUS INCLUDABLE ON THE FORM 990, SCHEDULE H, PART I. THIS ORGANIZATION AGREES WITH THE AHA POSITION. AS OUTLINED IN THE AHA LETTER TO THE IRS DATED AUGUST 21, 2007 WITH RESPECT TO THE FIRST PUBLISHED DRAFT OF THE NEW FORM 990 AND SCHEDULE H, THE AHA FELT THAT THE IRS SHOULD INCORPORATE THE FULL VALUE OF THE COMMUNITY BENEFIT THAT HOSPITALS PROVIDE BY COUNTING MEDICARE UNDERPAYMENTS (SHORTFALL) AS QUANTIFIABLE COMMUNITY BENEFIT FOR THE FOLLOWING REASONS: - PROVIDING CARE FOR THE ELDERLY AND SERVING MEDICARE PATIENTS IS AN ESSENTIAL PART OF THE COMMUNITY BENEFIT STANDARD. - MEDICARE, LIKE MEDICAID, DOES NOT PAY THE FULL COST OF CARE. RECENTLY, MEDICARE REIMBURSES HOSPITALS ONLY 92 CENTS FOR EVERY DOLLAR THEY SPEND TO TAKE CARE OF MEDICARE PATIENTS. THE MEDICARE PAYMENT ADVISORY COMMISSION (""MEDPAC"") IN ITS MARCH 2007 REPORT TO CONGRESS CAUTIONED THAT UNDERPAYMENT WILL GET EVEN WORSE, WITH MARGINS REACHING A 10-YEAR LOW AT NEGATIVE 5.4 PERCENT. - MANY MEDICARE BENEFICIARIES, LIKE THEIR MEDICAID COUNTERPARTS, ARE POOR. MORE THAN 46 PERCENT OF MEDICARE SPENDING IS FOR BENEFICIARIES WHOSE INCOME IS BELOW 200 PERCENT OF THE FEDERAL POVERTY LEVEL. MANY OF THOSE MEDICARE BENEFICIARIES ARE ALSO ELIGIBLE FOR MEDICAID -- SO CALLED ""DUAL ELIGIBLES."" THERE IS EVERY COMPELLING PUBLIC POLICY REASON TO TREAT MEDICARE AND MEDICAID UNDERPAYMENTS SIMILARLY FOR PURPOSES OF A HOSPITAL'S COMMUNITY BENEFIT AND INCLUDE THESE COSTS ON FORM 990, SCHEDULE H, PART I. MEDICARE UNDERPAYMENT MUST BE SHOULDERED BY THE HOSPITAL IN ORDER TO CONTINUE TREATING THE COMMUNITY'S ELDERLY AND POOR. THESE UNDERPAYMENTS REPRESENT A REAL COST OF SERVING THE COMMUNITY AND SHOULD COUNT AS A QUANTIFIABLE COMMUNITY BENEFIT. BOTH THE AHA AND THIS ORGANIZATION ALSO FEEL THAT PATIENT BAD DEBT IS A COMMUNITY BENEFIT AND THUS INCLUDABLE ON THE FORM 990, SCHEDULE H, PART I. LIKE MEDICARE UNDERPAYMENT (SHORTFALLS), THERE ALSO ARE COMPELLING REASONS THAT PATIENT BAD DEBT SHOULD BE COUNTED AS QUANTIFIABLE COMMUNITY BENEFIT AS FOLLOWS: - A SIGNIFICANT MAJORITY OF BAD DEBT IS ATTRIBUTABLE TO LOW-INCOME PATIENTS, WHO, FOR MANY REASONS, DECLINE TO COMPLETE THE FORMS REQUIRED TO ESTABLISH ELIGIBILITY FOR HOSPITALS' CHARITY CARE OR FINANCIAL ASSISTANCE PROGRAMS. A 2006 CONGRESSIONAL BUDGET OFFICE (""CBO"") REPORT, NONPROFIT HOSPITALS AND THE PROVISION OF COMMUNITY BENEFITS, CITED TWO STUDIES INDICATING THAT ""THE GREAT MAJORITY OF BAD DEBT WAS ATTRIBUTABLE TO PATIENTS WITH INCOMES BELOW 200% OF THE FEDERAL POVERTY LINE."" - THE REPORT ALSO NOTED THAT A SUBSTANTIAL PORTION OF BAD DEBT IS PENDING CHARITY CARE. UNLIKE BAD DEBT IN OTHER INDUSTRIES, HOSPITAL BAD DEBT IS COMPLICATED BY THE FACT THAT HOSPITALS FOLLOW THEIR MISSION TO THE COMMUNITY AND TREAT EVERY PATIENT THAT COMES THROUGH THEIR EMERGENCY DEPARTMENT, REGARDLESS OF ABILITY TO PAY. PATIENTS WHO HAVE OUTSTANDING BILLS ARE NOT TURNED AWAY, UNLIKE OTHER INDUSTRIES. BAD DEBT IS FURTHER COMPLICATED BY THE AUDITING INDUSTRY'S STANDARDS ON REPORTING CHARITY CARE. MANY PATIENTS CANNOT OR DO NOT PROVIDE THE NECESSARY, EXTENSIVE DOCUMENTATION REQUIRED TO BE DEEMED CHARITY CARE BY AUDITORS. AS A RESULT, ROUGHLY 40% OF BAD DEBT IS PENDING CHARITY CARE. - THE CBO CONCLUDED THAT ITS FINDINGS ""SUPPORT THE VALIDITY OF THE USE OF UNCOMPENSATED CARE [BAD DEBT AND CHARITY CARE] AS A MEASURE OF COMMUNITY BENEFITS"" ASSUMING THE FINDINGS ARE GENERALIZABLE NATIONWIDE;"

Bad Debt was not reported in any row of Part I, Line 7. Row (b) The Ratio of Cost to Charges method (or RCC) is used to determine the cost of ancillary services. A RCC is developed from these costs, and that RCC is applied to total Medicaid gross ancillary services charges to determine the cost of services provided to Medicaid patients. Row (e) Costs associated with Community Health Improvement Services were determined by adding indirect or overhead costs to the direct costs of the activity. Indirect costs were calculated as a percentage of direct costs. Direct costs for staff expenses were calculated using average hospital facility hourly rates, and were adjusted to account for fringe benefits, using a blended rate based on the ratio of total employee benefit expenses to total salary and wages. Row (f) The Bad Debt Expense that appears on Form 990, Part IX, Line 25 column (A), but not included for purposes of calculating the percentage in this column is equal to the amount reported on Form 990, Part X. The costs related to health professions education were determined by utilizing the step down method of cost finding. Row (h) Costs associated with research activities were determined by adding indirect, or overhead, costs to the direct costs of the activity. Indirect costs were calculated as a percentage of costs. Row (i) The cost of in-kind contributions to community groups is comprised of the direct costs of personnel whose compensated time was donated to various charities and community groups. The salaries and wages were adjusted to include benefits using a rate based on the ratio of total employee benefit expenses to total salary and wages. Indirect costs were calculated as a percentage of direct costs. Column (a) The number of activities or programs was determined by counting unique community benefit activities or programs conducted throughout the year. Each activity or program may include multiple occurrences. In Part I line 7a-k, column (a) represents the total number of unique community benefit activities and programs; not the number of occurrences for each activity and program.

201433189349302273,112868878,"SCHEDULE H, PART II","All community building activities improve access to health services and address federal, state, or local public health priorities, as well as leverage public health department activities, and in doing so, they provide relief of government burden. These activities broadly serve low-income, underserved patients, and include: collaboration with various community coalitions, system-wide recycling initiative, organizational response to worldly disasters, and bioterrorism efforts. The System's bioterrorism & disaster preparedness includes Center for Emergency Medical Services, which is a state and federal planning resource on weapons of mass destruction, and a designated a Bioterrorism Resource Center. The System has conducted staff training for more than 100 hospitals and area first responders and invested heavily in the infrastructure needed for large-scale emergencies. During catastrophes, (i.e. Super storm Sandy), North Shore-LIJ provides a safe haven for thousands of patients, outside nursing home residents, and community members seeking shelter. North Shore-LIJ ambulances assists with the transport of patients throughout the metropolitan area and stand ready to contribute food, medicine and blankets to numerous individuals who may lose power in their homes, and assist both affiliated and non-affiliated hospital patients. Investment in a field hospital has furthered the public health infrastructure needed for mass casualties that could result from a terrorist attack, natural attack, or large-scale emergency."

201433189349302273,112868878,"SCHEDULE H, PART VI; QUESTION 2","The Community Health Needs Assessment (CHNA) is performed on an ongoing basis. North Shore-LIJ conducts and participates in population, demographic, and health status evaluations of our respective hospitals' service areas based on county regions and the communities we serve. There is a special effort to include individuals with health disparities and organizations who serve these communities in the CHNA process. The CHNA includes the analysis of primary and secondary data. Multi-year analyses, trends and projections are developed, which identify areas of need for the continuum of health care services. Primary data is obtained through a combination of qualitative analysis of community-based organization (CBO), informant interviews and surveys, individual community member surveys, and participation in collaborative partner meetings. These meetings include representatives from the Departments of Health, CBOs, academic institutions, government agencies, and hospitals. Ongoing input concerning our communities' needs is also obtained through: our Board of Trustees/Directors who are all area residents and leaders in their respective communities; facility based advisory boards and councils, and; the feedback received by our facility administrators and clinicians that serve on local community agency boards. Secondary data analysis includes: internal hospital data, including Prevention Quality Indicators (PQI); Department of Health Community Health Assessments; local regional NYS Prevention Agenda data sources; E-BRFSS; 2010 US Census data and Statewide Planning and Research System (SPARCS) data. The Committee on Community Health, a committee of the Board of Trustees, provides recommendations that concern North Shore-LIJ's community health priorities and interventions based on the CHNA. Committee discussions focus on New York State (NYS) Prevention Agenda Priority Areas, including strategies and intervention outcomes related to chronic disease prevention, women and children's health, healthy safe environments, health access, mental health and substance abuse, HIV/AIDS/STDs and community immunizations. Regional departments of health (I.E. Nassau County Department of Health, Suffolk County Department of Health Services, and NYC Department of Health and Mental Hygiene) perform additional community health assessments (CHA) with the input of hospital and community stakeholders. These regional partners use strategies such as community member surveys, CBO surveys, and public listening sessions to solicit information on community needs. Together with other healthcare organizations and CBOs, North Shore-LIJ participates in meetings organized by these regional departments of health academic organizations to discuss the shared responsibility of public health planning within the NYS Prevention Agenda. These meetings provide an opportunity for general discussion regarding the public health goals of the NYS Prevention Agenda and the selection of shared priorities for collaborative regional planning. The partnership among local health departments, hospitals and CBOs, enables region wide leveraging of resources, consensus on health priorities and collaboration on health promotion strategies."
201433189349302273,112868878,"SCHEDULE H, PART VI; QUESTION 3","North Shore-LIJ is a regional leader in the development of financial assistance programs for the uninsured. The System's financial assistance policy provides a uniformly-administered system of reduced fees for the uninsured residents of our service area. The current fee schedule includes patients with household incomes up to 500% of the FPL. While the fee schedule serves as a guide, all hardship cases are evaluated on a case-by-case basis, taking into account the individual's financial and personal circumstances. All medically necessary services are covered under the financial assistance program and the public is notified of the availability of the program through: multilingual signage and educational brochures; centralized program administration accessible via phone; staff outreach, and all bills include a notice about the financial assistance program. Soft credit scoring software is used to facilitate the application process, but is not used to deny an applicant. The Healthcare Access Center (HAC), staffed by bilingual employees, assists community residents' with referrals for enrollment into government-subsidized insurance programs such as Medicaid, Child Health Plus and Family Health Plus. In addition, the HAC staff refers patients to the Medicaid Prenatal Care Program and to the Senior Navigator Program within North Shore-LIJ for assistance with Medicaid for pregnant women and Medicare enrollment for seniors."
201433189349302273,112868878,"SCHEDULE H, PART VI; QUESTION 4","The North Shore-LIJ has a service area of more than approximately 7.2 million people covering Long Island (Nassau and Suffolk counties) and the Metropolitan area covering the boroughs of Manhattan, Queens, and Staten Island. The demographics of the community show a broad range of cultural and ethnic diversity, particularly in Queens, the most multi-ethnic county in the country. Overall the area has shown an increase in the number of uninsured and underinsured. The other counties in the service area continue to show trends of increasing diversity, as well. By 2018, our service area population 65 and older will grow by 14.5%, while residents under 65 will decline less than 1% (Thomson Reuters, Market Planner Plus). The service area has also shown high rates of obesity, diabetes, asthma and heart/cerebrovascular disease mortality."
201433189349302273,112868878,"SCHEDULE H, PART VI; QUESTION 5","North Shore-LIJ works to promote community health through education, community advocacy, partnerships, and programs that result in improved access to care and health outcomes. The activities and strategies for achieving this goal include: establishing collaborative partnerships with local CBOs, health-related organizations, business, and government to identify and address community health needs; advocating for policies that benefit the broader community at state and local levels; providing community health programs and services based on identified community health needs/priorities; delivering preventive care services and education; conducting community outreach and engagement activities and expanding community member representation and involvement on committees/boards for programming and educational events. North Shore-LIJ provides community residents with a broad array of community health programs, such as: access to healthcare services and caring for the medically underserved; screenings and immunizations; health forums and health fairs; community education and outreach programs; support groups and counseling and emergency medical services. A comprehensive list of programs can be found in the Community Service Plans located on the North Shore-LIJ public website. North Shore-LIJ recognizes that, to have an impact on community health status, it must collaborate, to the extent possible, with multiple partners who can address different components of program design, including: providing trust and ""reach"" into a community; access to capital and funding; policy guidance and best practices for program development. With thousands of community programs, our partners are many and varied; some of our partners include: government, national/professional associations, area businesses, other area health care providers, philanthropies, civic organizations and CBOs."

All North Shore-LIJ entities are considered to be under common control for antitrust and other legal purposes. Each hospital facility shares a common board and management in the North Shore-LIJ Health System and as such is referred to as being commonly managed. Also, in a joint venture, the Hofstra North Shore-LIJ School of Medicine at Hofstra University provides an allopathic medical school for the benefit of the community. In keeping with its mission to improve the health and caring for the communities it serves, regardless of the ability to pay, North Shore-LIJ established the Office of Community and Public Health (OCPH) to promote health and wellness. The OCPH plays a key role in leading many of the mission-critical initiatives of the System and operates in alignment with the National Prevention Strategy and NYS Prevention Agenda. The OCPH is guided by the Committee on Community Health, a committee composed of the Board of Trustees, which is charged with identifying the overall health needs of the community and making recommendations for the population the System serves. The objectives of the Committee include: promoting a dialogue about the obligations of a large health system in addressing critical health issues of the public; reviewing information which assesses the health status of the communities served; promoting activities which have been shown to positively impact health; proposing policy recommendations to guide current programs or develop new ones; identifying opportunities to meet health care needs through improved delivery of health care; and recommending community health interventions to be provided by the System. North Shore-LIJ has established comprehensive and coordinated clinical programs that span across the enterprise. These programs not only provide a full continuum of services and seamless delivery of care, but offer community health activities, outreach and education as well; they include: Behavioral Health, Cancer, Cardiovascular Services, Dental Medicine, Emergency Medicine, Family Medicine, Hospice Care, Imaging/Radiology, Laboratory Medicine and Pathology, Medicine, Neurology, Neurosurgery, Obstetrics/Gynecology, Ophthalmology, Orthopedic Surgery, Otolaryngology, Pediatrics, Physical Medicine & Rehabilitation, Population Health, Senior Services, Surgery, Urology, and Women's Health. In 2013 North Shore-LIJ CareConnect Insurance Company, Inc. (""CareConnect"") began enrolling individuals, families, and small and large businesses in a range of commercial insurance plans. As the first fully integrated provider-owned Article 42 insurance company in New York, CareConnect offers access to inpatient and emergency care, post-acute care, thousands of affiliated community physicians, nurses, and other caregivers. The System's hospitals, programs and services support one of the largest resident and fellowship training programs in the United States. It directly sponsors approximately 120 accredited graduate medical education (GME) programs and trains more than 1,500 medical residents and fellows annually. Our hospitals and facilities collectively serve as teaching sites for more than 1,200 rotations for medical students from five medical schools."

JOSEPH HEALTH CENTER - HMHP PROVIDES SUPPORT TO THE MORAL AND ETHICAL UPBRINGING OF HIGH-RISK YOUTH BY MENTORING THROUGH THE ADOPT-A-SCHOOL PROGRAM. CHILDREN WHO EXPERIENCE HIGH LEVELS OF SOCIO-ECONOMIC RISK ARE SUBSTANTIALLY MORE LIKELY THAN OTHER CHILDREN TO SUFFER NEGATIVE OUTCOMES, SUCH AS EMOTIONAL AND BEHAVIORAL PROBLEMS AND DIFFICULTIES IN SCHOOL. (THE URBAN INSTITUTE, SERIES B, #B18, 6/2000). ST. ELIZABETH HEALTH CENTER - HMHP DEVELOPED THE SAVE (SAFETY AND VIOLENCE EDUCATION) PROGRAM IN RESPONSE TO THE GROWING INCIDENCE OF INJURY AND DEATH DUE TO VIOLENCE IN THE REGION. THE GOAL OF THIS FREE PROGRAM IS TO HELP AT-RISK YOUTH LEARN THE CONSEQUENCES OF VIOLENCE AND TO TEACH THEM ALTERNATIVE WAYS TO HANDLE CONFLICT. THIS PROGRAM TARGETS YOUTH, AGES 12 AND OLDER, WHO ARE IDENTIFIED AS AT-RISK FOR COMMUNITY VIOLENCE THROUGH THE COURTS AND TRUANCY OFFICERS. IN 2013, 240 PEOPLE PARTICIPATED IN THE SAVE PROGRAM. A ROBUST ECONOMY POSITIVELY IMPACTS RESIDENTS BY INCREASING THE NUMBER OF RESIDENTS COVERED BY HEALTH INSURANCE AND IMPROVING THE CAPACITY OF THE COMMUNITY TO SUPPORT HEALTH SERVICES. HMHP SUPPORTS A ROBUST ECONOMY IN THE COMMUNITY BY SUPPORTING THE REGIONAL CHAMBER OF COMMERCE AND THE YOUNGSTOWN BUSINESS INCUBATOR. MANY HMHP LEADERS ARE ACTIVE MEMBERS OF BOARDS OF DIRECTORS OF NUMEROUS COMMUNITY ORGANIZATIONS.

HMHP PROVIDES INPATIENT AND OUTPATIENT SOCIAL SERVICES SUPPORT GROUPS FOR THOSE SUFFERING FROM DRUG AND ALCOHOL ADDICTION, DEPRESSION AND BIPOLAR DISORDERS, AS WELL AS FOR TOBACCO TREATMENT AND CESSATION. THESE SERVICES ARE IMPORTANT TO SUPPORT THE ABILITY OF RESIDENTS TO GAIN AND RETAIN EMPLOYMENT AND THEREFORE ACCESS TO HEALTH INSURANCE AND IMPROVED ACCESS TO HEALTH SERVICES. THIS PROGRAM IS KEY TO THE ST. JOSEPH HEALTH CENTER PULMONARY REHAB PROGRAM. LEVERAGING RESOURCES WITHIN THE COMMUNITY PROVIDES MORE EFFECTIVE SOLUTIONS AND REDUCES DUPLICATION OF SERVICES. HMHP WORKS COOPERATIVELY WITH THE AREA'S HEALTH DEPARTMENTS, HOSPITALS AND THE LOCAL UNITED WAY ORGANIZATIONS TO ADDRESS ACCESS TO HEALTH CARE AND UNMET HEALTH NEEDS. THESE ISSUES NEGATIVELY IMPACT THE HEALTH OF THE COMMUNITY BY DELAYING THE TREATMENT OF ILLNESS AND DISEASE AND THE INAPPROPRIATE USE OF EMERGENCY SERVICES. THE HMHP REGIONAL TOBACCO TREATMENT CENTER OFFERS PROVEN TREATMENT RESULTS WITH NO FINAL COST TO CLIENTS; TREATMENT INCLUDES MEDICATIONS AND COUNSELING. THE HMHP CENTER HAD 673 CLIENTS DURING 2013. BY GRADUATION DATE, 95% OF THOSE CLIENTS HAD QUIT SMOKING. OF THOSE PEOPLE, 72% WERE STILL NOT SMOKING AFTER THREE MONTHS. HMHP IS PART OF THE DIABETES PARTNERSHIP OF MAHONING VALLEY AS WELL AS A PARTNERSHIP WITH YMCA FOR A DIABETES PREVENTION PROGRAM.

RESEARCH HAS CONTINUALLY SHOWN THAT WHEN THE FACTORS INFLUENCING HEALTH ARE EXPLORED, HEALTH CARE ACTUALLY PLAYS THE SMALLEST ROLE PROPORTIONATELY. A REPORT IN THE JOURNAL OF AMERICAN MEDICAL ASSOCIATION AND THE CENTER FOR DISEASE CONTROL (MCGINNIS, 1996) SUGGESTS THAT THE FACTORS IMPACTING HEALTH ARE AS FOLLOWS: LIFESTYLE AND BEHAVIORS, 50%, ENVIRONMENT (HUMAN AND NATURAL), 20%, GENETICS AND HUMAN BIOLOGY, 20%, AND HEALTH CARE, 10%. COMMUNITY BUILDING ACTIVITIES HELP TO ADDRESS THE OTHER INDICATORS OUTSIDE OF THE ROLE TRADITIONALLY PLAYED BY HEALTH-CARE ORGANIZATIONS. THESE ACTIVITIES ARE ALMOST EXCLUSIVELY DONE IN SOME FORM OF PARTNERSHIP IN WHICH THE COMMUNITY OR OTHER ORGANIZATIONS ARE BETTER SUITED TO ADDRESS. HEALTH-CARE ORGANIZATIONS GENERALLY PROVIDE TIMELY AND SPECIFIC RESOURCES TO HELP THESE ISSUES. HEALTH-CARE ORGANIZATIONS CAN BE A RICH AND VALUABLE COMMUNITY RESOURCE IN WAYS NOT TYPICALLY CONSIDERED. OFTEN THE MOST EFFECTIVE WAY TO HELP IMPACT AND IMPROVE THE COMMUNITY HEALTH STATUS IS TO SUPPORT OTHER AGENCIES AND ORGANIZATIONS IN A VARIETY OF WAYS OUTSIDE OF HEALTH SERVICES. THIS IS OFTEN DONE THROUGH CASH OR IN-KIND SERVICES TO SUPPORT OTHER NON-PROFITS, DONATIONS OF DURABLE MEDICAL EQUIPMENT AND SUPPLIES TO CERTAIN AGENCIES, OR THROUGH LEADERSHIP AND EDUCATIONAL EXPERTISE. TRINITY MEDICAL CENTER CONTRIBUTES FINANCIALLY TO A WIDE VARIETY OF COMMUNITY ORGANIZATIONS THAT ADDRESS THE BROADER NEEDS OF THE COMMUNITY. THESE DONATIONS ALLOW OTHER NON-PROFIT ORGANIZATIONS TO FULFILL THEIR MISSIONS TO IMPROVE THE WELL BEING OF THE COMMUNITY AND CONTRIBUTE TO ITS OVERALL HEALTH STATUS IN WAYS THAT MAY DIFFER FROM THE DIRECT SERVICES OF THE HOSPITAL ORGANIZATION AND MAXIMIZE THE RESOURCES THEY HAVE TO WORK WITH. TRINITY MEDICAL CENTER EMPLOYEES ARE ACTIVE IN EDUCATING PARTNERS ON A WIDE VARIETY OF HEALTH SUBJECTS THAT ADVANCE THEIR WORK. FURTHER, TRINITY MEDICAL CENTER EMPLOYEES ARE MEMBERS OF MANY NON-PROFIT BOARDS TO PROVIDE LEADERSHIP OR COLLABORATE TO ADDRESS COMPLEX HEALTH ISSUES.

RESEARCH HAS CONTINUALLY SHOWN THAT WHEN THE FACTORS INFLUENCING HEALTH ARE EXPLORED, HEALTH CARE ACTUALLY PLAYS THE SMALLEST ROLE PROPORTIONATELY. A REPORT IN THE JOURNAL OF AMERICAN MEDICAL ASSOCIATION AND THE CENTER FOR DISEASE CONTROL (MCGINNIS, 1996) SUGGESTS THAT THE FACTORS IMPACTING HEALTH ARE AS FOLLOWS: LIFESTYLE AND BEHAVIORS, 50%, ENVIRONMENT (HUMAN AND NATURAL), 20%, GENETICS AND HUMAN BIOLOGY, 20%, AND HEALTH CARE, 10%. COMMUNITY BUILDING ACTIVITIES HELP TO ADDRESS THE OTHER INDICATORS OUTSIDE OF THE ROLE TRADITIONALLY PLAYED BY HEALTH-CARE ORGANIZATIONS. THESE ACTIVITIES ARE ALMOST EXCLUSIVELY DONE IN SOME FORM OF PARTNERSHIP IN WHICH THE COMMUNITY OR OTHER ORGANIZATIONS ARE BETTER SUITED TO ADDRESS. HEALTH-CARE ORGANIZATIONS GENERALLY PROVIDE TIMELY AND SPECIFIC RESOURCES TO HELP THESE ISSUES. HEALTH-CARE ORGANIZATIONS CAN BE A RICH AND VALUABLE COMMUNITY RESOURCE IN WAYS NOT TYPICALLY CONSIDERED. OFTEN THE MOST EFFECTIVE WAY TO HELP IMPACT AND IMPROVE THE COMMUNITY HEALTH STATUS IS TO SUPPORT OTHER AGENCIES AND ORGANIZATIONS IN A VARIETY OF WAYS OUTSIDE OF HEALTH SERVICES. THIS IS OFTEN DONE THROUGH CASH OR IN-KIND SERVICES TO SUPPORT OTHER NON-PROFITS, DONATIONS OF DURABLE MEDICAL EQUIPMENT AND SUPPLIES TO CERTAIN AGENCIES, OR THROUGH LEADERSHIP AND EDUCATIONAL EXPERTISE. THE HOSPITAL CONTRIBUTES FINANCIALLY TO A WIDE VARIETY OF COMMUNITY ORGANIZATIONS THAT ADDRESS THE BROADER NEEDS OF THE COMMUNITY. THESE DONATIONS ALLOW OTHER NON-PROFIT ORGANIZATIONS TO FULFILL THEIR MISSIONS TO IMPROVE THE WELL BEING OF THE COMMUNITY AND CONTRIBUTE TO ITS OVERALL HEALTH STATUS IN WAYS THAT MAY DIFFER FROM THE DIRECT SERVICES OF THE HOSPITAL ORGANIZATION AND MAXIMIZE THE RESOURCES THEY HAVE TO WORK WITH. THE HOSPITAL EMPLOYEES ARE ACTIVE IN EDUCATING PARTNERS ON A WIDE VARIETY OF HEALTH SUBJECTS THAT ADVANCE THEIR WORK. FURTHER, THE HOSPITAL EMPLOYEES ARE MEMBERS OF MANY NON-PROFIT BOARDS TO PROVIDE LEADERSHIP OR COLLABORATE TO ADDRESS COMPLEX HEALTH ISSUES.

A MULTI-STEP PLANNING PROCESS WAS INITIATED.STEP 1 INVOLVED THE REVIEW AND REVISION OF THE HOSPITAL'S MISSION AND VISION STATEMENTS. BOTH STATEMENTS WERE MODIFIED FROM WHAT HAD PREVIOUSLY EXISTED. A CONCISE, VALUE DRIVEN MISSION STATEMENT WAS DEVELOPED IN RESPONSE TO THE NEED FOR MISSION STATEMENTS TO DESCRIBE ""WHO WE ARE."" ADDITIONALLY, SEVERAL CORE VALUES WERE DELINEATED IN SUPPORT OF THE MISSION STATEMENT.

FINALLY, A NUMBER OF SPECIFIC OBJECTIVES WERE DEVELOPED WHICH RESPOND TO THE QUESTION ""WHAT WILL BE ACCOMPLISHED ANNUALLY?"" OBJECTIVES WERE GENERATED BY SENIOR MANAGEMENT AND FORM THE BASIS FOR NEAR TERM ADMINISTRATIVE WORKPLANS.ESSENTIAL TO THE SUCCESS OF ANY STRATEGIC PLAN IS THE HOSPITAL'S ABILITY TO BOTH IMPLEMENT RECOMMENDATIONS MADE WITHIN THE PLAN AND TO RECOGNIZE THE DOCUMENT AS A DYNAMIC AND FLEXIBLE TOOL TO BE USED AS A GUIDE FOR THE FUTURE. SPECIFIC GOALS AND STRATEGIES MAY OR MAY NOT BE OBTAINED AND, UPON EVALUATION AND THE AVAILABILITY OF NEW INFORMATION AND DEVELOPMENTS, MAY NEED TO BE MODIFIED. A SUCCESSFUL STRATEGIC PLAN RECOGNIZES THIS POTENTIAL FOR CHANGE AND IS FLEXIBLE ENOUGH TO ACCOMMODATE NEW OR DIFFERENT OPPORTUNITIES AND CHALLENGES.CRITICAL HEALTH CARE ISSUESTHE RECENTLY ENACTED HEALTHCARE REFORM LEGISLATION UNDERSCORES MANY OF THE SIGNIFICANT ISSUES CURRENTLY FACING HOSPITALS. FOLLOWING IS LISTING OF CRITICAL ISSUES THAT WILL IMPACT HOSPITALS OVER THE NEXT SEVERAL YEARS. 1. QUALITY: HEALTH CARE QUALITY AND SAFETY ARE NOW STRATEGICALLY IMPORTANT, NOT JUST PROFESSIONALLY IMPORTANT. THE ADVENT OF WIDESPREAD PUBLIC REPORTING OF HOSPITAL QUALITY RESULTS ASSURES THAT A HOSPITAL'S QUALITY PERFORMANCE IS NO LONGER ONLY VISIBLE TO THE DIRECTOR OF QUALITY, QA COMMITTEE MEMBERS AND VARIOUS REGULATORS. THE NET EFFECT OF THIS TRANSPARENCY TREND OVER THE NEXT 5 YEARS WILL BE THAT THE DEFINITION OF A ""GOOD HOSPITAL"" WILL SHIFT SIGNIFICANTLY. NO LONGER WILL IT BE ENOUGH TO HAVE ATTRACTIVE FACILITIES, GOOD TECHNOLOGIES AND SKILLED DOCTORS AND NURSES. HOSPITALS WILL NEED TO MARSHAL THOSE RESOURCES INTO A QUALITY AND SAFETY SYSTEM CAPABLE OF RELIABLY PRODUCING MEASURED QUALITY RESULTS. PROVIDER PAYMENTS WILL INCREASINGLY BE A FUNCTION OF QUALITY OUTCOMES AND QUALITY BONUSES WILL BE DRAWN FROM ANNUAL PAYMENT UPDATES. INFORMATION SYSTEMS CAPABLE OF PROVIDING VALID AND RELIABLE QUALITY AND OUTCOME INDICATORS WILL BE A NECESSITY AS WILL THE USE OF EVIDENCE BASED GUIDELINES BY CLINICAL PROVIDERS. CONSUMERS WILL SEEK AND USE PERFORMANCE INFORMATION, INCLUDING PATIENT SATISFACTION INFORMATION, TO GUIDE THEIR CHOICE OF PROVIDERS.2. INFORMATION TECHNOLOGY: HEALTH INFORMATION TECHNOLOGY INCLUDES COMPUTER BASED TOOLS DEVELOPED SPECIFICALLY FOR HEALTH CARE DELIVERY. THESE TOOLS CAN PROVIDE CLINICIANS UP-TO-DATE INFORMATION ON THEIR PATIENTS, ACCESS TO THE LATEST MEDICAL KNOWLEDGE AND BEST PRACTICES THROUGH DECISION SUPPORT SYSTEMS. IT IS UNDERSTOOD THAT INVESTMENTS IN NEW CLINICAL AND INFORMATION TECHNOLOGY CAN SIGNIFICANTLY ENHANCE PATIENT SAFETY AND CLINICAL OUTCOMES. COMPUTERIZED PHYSICIAN ORDER ENTRY (CPOE), BAR CODING AND ITS POTENTIAL TO REDUCE MEDICATION ERRORS, AND ELECTRONIC MEDICAL RECORDS (EMRS) AND THEIR POSITIVE IMPACT ON MEDICAL ERRORS ARE ALL EXAMPLES OF HEALTH CARE'S USE OF IT SOLUTIONS TO IMPROVE QUALITY. THE FEDERAL GOVERNMENT HAS HIGHLIGHTED THE ROLE OF HEALTH INFORMATION TECHNOLOGY AS A MEANS TO IMPROVE HEALTH CARE QUALITY, SAFETY AND NOW IS PROVIDING STIMULUS AND INCENTIVE PAYMENTS TO PROVIDERS TO FACILITATE AND HASTEN THEIR ADOPTION INTO THE CARE DELIVERY PROCESS. EMR'S WILL BECOME A PREREQUISITE OF ANY DELIVERY SYSTEM THAT INTENDS TO PROVIDE COORDINATED COST EFFECTIVE CARE.3. PHYSICIANS: PHYSICIANS HAVE EMERGED AS CRITICAL OPERATIONAL AND STRATEGIC PARTNERS TO HOSPITALS. THOSE THAT ARE SUCCESSFUL IN ENGAGING AND COLLABORATING WITH THEIR MEDICAL STAFFS WILL BE BEST ABLE TO DEMONSTRATE HIGH QUALITY CARE AND COMPLIANCE WITH HEALTH REFORM'S VALUE BASED PURCHASING AND OTHER QUALITY MANDATES.ADDITIONALLY, GIVEN THE INCREASE IN DEMAND FOR HEALTHCARE SERVICES THAT WILL BE OCCASIONED BY REFORM, THE ABILITY TO SUCCESSFULLY RECRUIT PHYSICIANS WILL BE CRITICAL. AT A TIME WHEN HEALTHCARE REFORM INITIATIVES EMPHASIZE THE ROLE OF PRIMARY CARE, THERE IS A SPECIAL NEED TO INTENSIFY EFFORTS TO RECRUIT PRIMARY CARE PROVIDERS. BECAUSE THE VAST MAJORITY OF NEW PHYSICIANS PREFER EMPLOYMENT AS THEIR PRACTICE PREFERENC,, THE ABILITY OF HOSPITALS TO BE ABLE TO OFFER PHYSICIANS A CONTEMPORARY AND COMPETITIVE ""EMPLOYMENT PLATFORM"" IS ESSENTIAL.4. FINANCE AND CAPITAL: FINANCIAL PERFORMANCE AND ACCESS TO CAPITAL WILL CONTINUE TO BE AMONG THE MOST CRITICAL ISSUES CONFRONTING HOSPITALS. EVEN WITH HEALTHCARE REFORM, HEALTHCARE COSTS WILL CONTINUE TO OUTPACE INFLATION. INCREASING WAGE AND SALARY COSTS, AND RISING HEALTH CARE COSTS IN GENERAL WILL CONTINUE TO IMPACT OPERATING PERFORMANCE AND PRESS HOSPITALS TO CONTINUE A RELENTLESS FOCUS ON COST MANAGEMENT. ADDITIONALLY, REVENUE STRATEGIES WILL NEED TO BE DEVELOPED TO GENERATE PROFITABLE GROWTH IN PATIENT VOLUME, AS WILL THE NEED TO ENSURE OPTIMAL MANAGEMENT OF ALL REVENUE CYCLE ACTIVITIES. HOSPITALS ARE FACING SIGNIFICANT PAYMENT REDUCTIONS IN TERMS OF DECREASES IN MEDICARE UPDATES, DISPROPORTIONATE SHARE, SNF AND HOMECARE PAYMENTS. AS HOSPITALS CONTINUE TO POST LOW OR NO PROFIT MARGINS, INVESTMENT INCOME WILL BE MORE IMPORTANT THAN EVER. HOWEVER, GIVEN THE FACT THAT INVESTMENT INCOME IS A HIGHLY UNCERTAIN COMPONENT OF A HOSPITAL'S OVERALL FINANCIAL HEALTH, HOSPITALS WILL BE DRIVEN TO PURSUE MORE PHILANTHROPY. HOSPITAL CAPITAL SPENDING WILL BE DRIVEN BY GROWING DEMANDS FOR ADVANCED TECHNOLOGY NEEDED TO ENSURE PATIENT QUALITY AND SAFETY, THE NEED TO REPLACE AND UPDATE AGING FACILITIES, AND THE DESIRE AND NEED TO IMPROVE TECHNOLOGY BASED SERVICES.5. RISK MANAGEMENT AND COMPLIANCE: HEALTHCARE'S TECHNOLOGY HAS NEVER BEEN MORE COMPLICATED, PATIENTS' DEMANDS HIGHER, AND THE BUSINESS CHALLENGES GREATER. ACCORDINGLY, COMPREHENSIVE RISK MANAGEMENT PROGRAM ARE ESSENTIAL IN ASSURING CARE DELIVERY SYSTEMS THAT ARE HIGHLY EFFECTIVE IN TERMS OF ASSURING APPROPRIATE LEVELS OF PATIENT SAFETY AND QUALITY.THE DEPARTMENT OF JUSTICE ESTIMATES THAT THE FEDERAL GOVERNMENT LOSES BILLIONS OF DOLLARS ANNUALLY IN HEALTH CARE FRAUD. CONSEQUENTLY, THE GOVERNMENT'S HEALTHCARE FRAUD ENFORCEMENT ACTIVITIES WITH RESPECT TO ALL HEALTHCARE PROVIDERS CONTINUE TO GROW AND EXPAND. WELL ESTABLISHED CORPORATE COMPLIANCE PROGRAMS ARE ESSENTIAL IN TERMS OF ALLOWING HOSPITALS TO IDENTIFY POTENTIAL AREAS OF LIABILITY AND TO CORRECT PROBLEMS.6. NURSING: NURSES AND NURSING CARE ARE CENTRAL TO THE DELIVERY OF SAFE AND EFFECTIVE PATIENT CARE. ACCORDINGLY, ENSURING AN ADEQUATE NURSING WORKFORCE AND CREATING A WORK ENVIRONMENT THAT SUPPORTS NURSING PRACTICE AND INTERDISCIPLINARY COLLABORATION ARE IMPORTANT PRIORITIES FOR HOSPITALS TODAY."

The organization prepares and issues audited financial statements. The attached text was obtained from the footnotes to the audited financial statements of the organization. Uncompensated care The Medical Center provides charity care to patients who meet certain financial criteria established by the State of New Jersey. The direct and indirect cost of services and supplies furnished to patients eligible for such charity care, using a ratio of cost to gross charges, approximated $6,590,000 and $6,179,000 for the years ended December 31, 2013 and 2012, respectively. Gross charges forgone related to charity care services amounted to approximately $30,938,000 and $25,534,000 for the years ended December 31, 2013 and 2012, respectively. The Medical Center's patient acceptance policy is based on its mission statement and its charitable purposes. Accordingly, the Medical Center accepts all patients regardless of their ability to pay. This policy results in the assumption of higher-than-normal patient accounts receivable credit risks. To the extent the Medical Center realizes additional losses resulting from such higher credit risk for patients that are not identified or do not meet the previously described charity definition, such additional losses are included in the provision for bad debts. Additionally, the Medical Center sponsors certain other charitable programs, which provide substantial benefit to the broader community. Such programs include services to needy and elderly populations that require special support, as well as health promotion and education for the general community welfare. The Health Care Reform Act of 1992, Chapter 160, established the Health Care Subsidy Fund to provide a mechanism and funding source to compensate hospitals for charity care. The Medical Center received approximately $1,362,000 and $1,346,000 for charity care, which is included in net patient service revenue for the years ended December 31, 2013 and 2012, respectively. The Health Care Subsidy Fund amounts are subject to change from year to year based on available state budget amounts and allocation methodologies."

THE ORGANIZATION BELIEVES THAT MEDICARE UNDERPAYMENTS (SHORTFALL) AND BAD DEBT ARE COMMUNITY BENEFIT AND ASSOCIATED COSTS ARE INCLUDABLE ON THE FORM 990, SCHEDULE H, PART I. AS OUTLINED MORE FULLY BELOW, THE ORGANIZATION BELIEVES THAT THESE SERVICES AND RELATED COSTS PROMOTE THE HEALTH OF THE COMMUNITY AS A WHOLE AND ARE RENDERED IN CONJUNCTION WITH THE ORGANIZATION'S CHARITABLE TAX-EXEMPT PURPOSES AND MISSION IN PROVIDING MEDICALLY NECESSARY HEALTHCARE SERVICES TO ALL INDIVIDUALS IN A NON-DISCRIMINATORY MANNER WITHOUT REGARD TO RACE, COLOR, CREED, SEX, NATIONAL ORIGIN, RELIGION OR ABILITY TO PAY AND CONSISTENT WITH THE COMMUNITY BENEFIT STANDARD PROMULGATED BY THE INTERNAL REVENUE SERVICE (""IRS""). THE COMMUNITY BENEFIT STANDARD IS THE CURRENT STANDARD FOR A HOSPITAL FOR RECOGNITION AS A TAX-EXEMPT AND CHARITABLE ORGANIZATION UNDER INTERNAL REVENUE CODE (""IRC"") 501(C)(3). THE ORGANIZATION IS RECOGNIZED AS A TAX-EXEMPT ENTITY AND CHARITABLE ORGANIZATION UNDER 501(C)(3) OF THE IRC. ALTHOUGH THERE IS NO DEFINITION IN THE TAX CODE FOR THE TERM ""CHARITABLE"" A REGULATION PROMULGATED BY THE DEPARTMENT OF THE TREASURY PROVIDES SOME GUIDANCE AND STATES THAT ""THE TERM CHARITABLE IS USED IN 501(C)(3) IN ITS GENERALLY ACCEPTED LEGAL SENSE,"" AND PROVIDES EXAMPLES OF CHARITABLE PURPOSES, INCLUDING THE RELIEF OF THE POOR OR UNPRIVILEGED; THE PROMOTION OF SOCIAL WELFARE; AND THE ADVANCEMENT OF EDUCATION, RELIGION, AND SCIENCE. NOTE IT DOES NOT EXPLICITLY ADDRESS THE ACTIVITIES OF HOSPITALS. IN THE ABSENCE OF EXPLICIT STATUTORY OR REGULATORY REQUIREMENTS APPLYING THE TERM ""CHARITABLE"" TO HOSPITALS, IT HAS BEEN LEFT TO THE IRS TO DETERMINE THE CRITERIA HOSPITALS MUST MEET TO QUALIFY AS IRC 501(C)(3) CHARITABLE ORGANIZATIONS. THE ORIGINAL STANDARD WAS KNOWN AS THE CHARITY CARE STANDARD. THIS STANDARD WAS REPLACED BY THE IRS WITH THE COMMUNITY BENEFIT STANDARD WHICH IS THE CURRENT STANDARD. CHARITY CARE STANDARD IN 1956, THE IRS ISSUED REVENUE RULING 56-185, WHICH ADDRESSED THE REQUIREMENTS HOSPITALS NEEDED TO MEET IN ORDER TO QUALIFY FOR IRC 501(C)(3) STATUS. ONE OF THESE REQUIREMENTS IS KNOWN AS THE ""CHARITY CARE STANDARD."" UNDER THE STANDARD, A HOSPITAL HAD TO PROVIDE, TO THE EXTENT OF ITS FINANCIAL ABILITY, FREE OR REDUCED-COST CARE TO PATIENTS UNABLE TO PAY FOR IT. A HOSPITAL THAT EXPECTED FULL PAYMENT DID NOT, ACCORDING TO THE RULING, PROVIDE CHARITY CARE BASED ON THE FACT THAT SOME PATIENTS ULTIMATELY FAILED TO PAY. THE RULING EMPHASIZED THAT A LOW LEVEL OF CHARITY CARE DID NOT NECESSARILY MEAN THAT A HOSPITAL HAD FAILED TO MEET THE REQUIREMENT SINCE THAT LEVEL COULD REFLECT ITS FINANCIAL ABILITY TO PROVIDE SUCH CARE. THE RULING ALSO NOTED THAT PUBLICLY SUPPORTED COMMUNITY HOSPITALS WOULD NORMALLY QUALIFY AS CHARITABLE ORGANIZATIONS BECAUSE THEY SERVE THE ENTIRE COMMUNITY, AND A LOW LEVEL OF CHARITY CARE WOULD NOT AFFECT A HOSPITAL'S EXEMPT STATUS IF IT WAS DUE TO THE SURROUNDING COMMUNITY'S LACK OF CHARITABLE DEMANDS. COMMUNITY BENEFIT STANDARD IN 1969, THE IRS ISSUED REVENUE RULING 69-545, WHICH ""REMOVED"" FROM REVENUE RULING 56-185 ""THE REQUIREMENTS RELATING TO CARING FOR PATIENTS WITHOUT CHARGE OR AT RATES BELOW COST."" UNDER THE STANDARD DEVELOPED IN REVENUE RULING 69-545, WHICH IS KNOWN AS THE ""COMMUNITY BENEFIT STANDARD,"" HOSPITALS ARE JUDGED ON WHETHER THEY PROMOTE THE HEALTH OF A BROAD CLASS OF INDIVIDUALS IN THE COMMUNITY. THE RULING INVOLVED A HOSPITAL THAT ONLY ADMITTED INDIVIDUALS WHO COULD PAY FOR THE SERVICES (BY THEMSELVES, PRIVATE INSURANCE, OR PUBLIC PROGRAMS SUCH AS MEDICARE), BUT OPERATED A FULL-TIME EMERGENCY ROOM THAT WAS OPEN TO EVERYONE. THE IRS RULED THAT THE HOSPITAL QUALIFIED AS A CHARITABLE ORGANIZATION BECAUSE IT PROMOTED THE HEALTH OF PEOPLE IN ITS COMMUNITY. THE IRS REASONED THAT BECAUSE THE PROMOTION OF HEALTH WAS A CHARITABLE PURPOSE ACCORDING TO THE GENERAL LAW OF CHARITY, IT FELL WITHIN THE ""GENERALLY ACCEPTED LEGAL SENSE"" OF THE TERM ""CHARITABLE,"" AS REQUIRED BY TREAS. REG. 1.501(C)(3)-1(D)(2). THE IRS RULING STATED THAT THE PROMOTION OF HEALTH, LIKE THE RELIEF OF POVERTY AND THE ADVANCEMENT OF EDUCATION AND RELIGION, IS ONE OF THE PURPOSES IN THE GENERAL LAW OF CHARITY THAT IS DEEMED BENEFICIAL TO THE COMMUNITY AS A WHOLE EVEN THOUGH THE CLASS OF BENEFICIARIES ELIGIBLE TO RECEIVE A DIRECT BENEFIT FROM ITS ACTIVITIES DOES NOT INCLUDE ALL MEMBERS OF THE COMMUNITY, SUCH AS INDIGENT MEMBERS OF THE COMMUNITY, PROVIDED THAT THE CLASS IS NOT SO SMALL THAT ITS RELIEF IS NOT OF BENEFIT TO THE COMMUNITY. THE IRS CONCLUDED THAT THE HOSPITAL WAS ""PROMOTING THE HEALTH OF A CLASS OF PERSONS THAT IS BROAD ENOUGH TO BENEFIT THE COMMUNITY"" BECAUSE ITS EMERGENCY DEPARTMENT WAS OPEN TO ALL AND IT PROVIDED CARE TO EVERYONE WHO COULD PAY, WHETHER DIRECTLY OR THROUGH THIRD-PARTY REIMBURSEMENT. OTHER CHARACTERISTICS OF THE HOSPITAL THAT THE IRS HIGHLIGHTED INCLUDED THE FOLLOWING: IT WAS CONTROLLED BY A BOARD OF TRUSTEES THAT CONSISTED OF INDEPENDENT CIVIC LEADERS; HOSPITAL MEDICAL STAFF PRIVILEGES WERE AVAILABLE TO ALL QUALIFIED PHYSICIANS; AND SURPLUS FUNDS ARE USED TO IMPROVE THE QUALITY OF PATIENT CARE, EXPAND AND RENOVATE HOSPITAL FACILITIES AND ADVANCE MEDICAL CARE, TRAINING, EDUCATION, RESEARCH, PROGRAMS AND ACTIVITIES. MEDICARE UNDERPAYMENTS AND BAD DEBT ARE COMMUNITY BENEFIT AND ASSOCIATED COSTS ARE INCLUDABLE ON THE FORM 990, SCHEDULE H, PART I. THE AMERICAN HOSPITAL ASSOCIATION (""AHA"") BELIEVES THAT MEDICARE UNDERPAYMENTS (SHORTFALL) AND BAD DEBT ARE COMMUNITY BENEFIT AND THUS INCLUDABLE ON THE FORM 990, SCHEDULE H, PART I. THIS ORGANIZATION AGREES WITH THE AHA POSITION. AS OUTLINED IN THE AHA LETTER TO THE IRS DATED AUGUST 21, 2007 WITH RESPECT TO THE FIRST PUBLISHED DRAFT OF THE NEW FORM 990 AND SCHEDULE H, THE AHA FELT THAT THE IRS SHOULD INCORPORATE THE FULL VALUE OF THE COMMUNITY BENEFIT THAT HOSPITALS PROVIDE BY COUNTING MEDICARE UNDERPAYMENTS (SHORTFALL) AS QUANTIFIABLE COMMUNITY BENEFIT FOR THE FOLLOWING REASONS: - PROVIDING CARE FOR THE ELDERLY AND SERVING MEDICARE PATIENTS IS AN ESSENTIAL PART OF THE COMMUNITY BENEFIT STANDARD. - MEDICARE, LIKE MEDICAID, DOES NOT PAY THE FULL COST OF CARE. RECENTLY, MEDICARE REIMBURSES HOSPITALS ONLY 86 CENTS FOR EVERY DOLLAR THEY SPEND TO TAKE CARE OF MEDICARE PATIENTS. THE MEDICARE PAYMENT ADVISORY COMMISSION (""MEDPAC"") IN ITS MARCH 2014 REPORT TO CONGRESS CAUTIONED THAT MARGINS WILL CONTINUE TO DECLINE. - MANY MEDICARE BENEFICIARIES, LIKE THEIR MEDICAID COUNTERPARTS, ARE POOR. MORE THAN 46 PERCENT OF MEDICARE SPENDING IS FOR BENEFICIARIES WHOSE INCOME IS BELOW 200 PERCENT OF THE FEDERAL POVERTY LEVEL. MANY OF THOSE MEDICARE BENEFICIARIES ARE ALSO ELIGIBLE FOR MEDICAID -- SO CALLED ""DUAL ELIGIBLES."" THERE IS EVERY COMPELLING PUBLIC POLICY REASON TO TREAT MEDICARE AND MEDICAID UNDERPAYMENTS SIMILARLY FOR PURPOSES OF A HOSPITAL'S COMMUNITY BENEFIT AND INCLUDE THESE COSTS ON FORM 990, SCHEDULE H, PART I. MEDICARE UNDERPAYMENT MUST BE SHOULDERED BY THE HOSPITAL IN ORDER TO CONTINUE TREATING THE COMMUNITY'S ELDERLY AND POOR. THESE UNDERPAYMENTS REPRESENT A REAL COST OF SERVING THE COMMUNITY AND SHOULD COUNT AS A QUANTIFIABLE COMMUNITY BENEFIT. BOTH THE AHA AND THIS ORGANIZATION ALSO BELIEVE THAT PATIENT BAD DEBT IS A COMMUNITY BENEFIT AND THUS INCLUDABLE ON THE FORM 990, SCHEDULE H, PART I. LIKE MEDICARE UNDERPAYMENT (SHORTFALLS), THERE ALSO ARE COMPELLING REASONS THAT PATIENT BAD DEBT SHOULD BE COUNTED AS QUANTIFIABLE COMMUNITY BENEFIT AS FOLLOWS: - A SIGNIFICANT MAJORITY OF BAD DEBT IS ATTRIBUTABLE TO LOW-INCOME PATIENTS, WHO, FOR MANY REASONS, DECLINE TO COMPLETE THE FORMS REQUIRED TO ESTABLISH ELIGIBILITY FOR HOSPITALS' CHARITY CARE OR FINANCIAL ASSISTANCE PROGRAMS. A 2006 CONGRESSIONAL BUDGET OFFICE (""CBO"") REPORT, NONPROFIT HOSPITALS AND THE PROVISION OF COMMUNITY BENEFITS, CITED TWO STUDIES INDICATING THAT ""THE GREAT MAJORITY OF BAD DEBT WAS ATTRIBUTABLE TO PATIENTS WITH INCOMES BELOW 200% OF THE FEDERAL POVERTY LINE."" - THE REPORT ALSO NOTED THAT A SUBSTANTIAL PORTION OF BAD DEBT IS PENDING CHARITY CARE. UNLIKE BAD DEBT IN OTHER INDUSTRIES, HOSPITAL BAD DEBT IS COMPLICATED BY THE FACT THAT HOSPITALS FOLLOW THEIR MISSION TO THE COMMUNITY AND TREAT EVERY PATIENT THAT COMES THROUGH THEIR EMERGENCY DEPARTMENT, REGARDLESS OF ABILITY TO PAY. PATIENTS WHO HAVE OUTSTANDING BILLS ARE NOT TURNED AWAY, UNLIKE OTHER INDUSTRIES. BAD DEBT IS FURTHER COMPLICATED BY THE AUDITING INDUSTRY'S STANDARDS ON REPORTING CHARITY CARE. MANY PATIENTS CANNOT OR DO NOT PROVIDE THE NECESSARY, EXTENSIVE DOCUMENTATION REQUIRED TO BE DEEMED CHARITY CARE BY AUDITORS. AS A RESULT, ROUGHLY 40% OF BAD DEBT IS PENDING CHARITY CARE. - THE CBO CONCLUDED THAT ITS FINDINGS ""SUPPORT THE VALIDITY OF THE USE OF UNCOMPENSATED CARE [BAD DEBT AND CHARITY CARE] AS A MEASURE OF COMMUNITY BENEFITS ASSUMING THE FINDINGS ARE GENERAL"

WE CONTINUE TO BUILD ON OUR LONG AND STRONG RECORD OF COLLABORATION WITH COMMUNITY GROUPS, BUSINESSES, ACADEMIC INSTITUTIONS, AND GOVERNMENTAL AND NON-GOVERNMENTAL ORGANIZATIONS WITH THE GOAL OF IMPROVING HEALTH OUTCOMES AND REDUCING HEALTH DISPARITIES FOR CHILDREN AND THEIR FAMILIES. EMPHASIS IS PLACED ON ADDRESSING BOTH THE SOCIAL DETERMINANTS OF HEALTH AND THE HEALTH CARE DELIVERY SYSTEM. SELECTED COMMUNITY BUILDING ACTIVITIES ARE HIGHLIGHTED BELOW. COMMUNITY SUPPORT - COMMUNITY-CAMPUS PARTNERSHIP THE COMMUNITY-CAMPUS PARTNERSHIP (C-CP) WAS CREATED IN 2013 TO FOSTER COLLABORATIONS AND HEALTHY COMMUNITIES AROUND THE ANSCHUTZ MEDICAL CAMPUS. THE NEW COMMUNITY-CAMPUS PARTNERSHIP WILL BE A MECHANISM FOR COORDINATING, COMMUNICATING, AND CONNECTING CAMPUS ENTITIES WITH COMMUNITIES. THE INITIATIVE WILL SUPPORT THE DEVELOPMENT OF COMMUNITY-CAMPUS PARTNERSHIPS FOR PREVENTION, HEALTH IMPROVEMENT AND ECONOMIC DEVELOPMENT AND WILL SEEK ADDITIONAL FUNDING TO MONITOR THE PHYSICAL AND MENTAL HEALTH STATUS IN THE NEIGHBORHOODS. THE CREATION OF COLLABORATIVE OPPORTUNITIES AND PARTNERSHIPS WILL ENHANCE THE EDUCATION, RESEARCH, AND SERVICES PROVIDED IN THE COMMUNITIES AND ON THE ANSCHUTZ MEDICAL CAMPUS WHICH IS SHARED BY CHILDREN'S HOSPITAL COLORADO AND UNIVERSITY OF COLORADO HOSPITAL. THE GOAL IS TO HELP NEIGHBORHOOD RESIDENTS LIVE HEALTHY LIFESTYLES AND EXPAND WORKFORCE DEVELOPMENT BY PREPARING THEM FOR JOBS ON THE MEDICAL AND RESEARCH CAMPUS. REPRESENTATIVES FROM CHILDREN'S HOSPITAL COLORADO SERVE ON THE CAMPUS COMMUNITY IMPLEMENTATION BOARD. COMMUNITY SUPPORT - MEDICAL LEGAL PARTNERSHIP MEDICAL-LEGAL PARTNERSHIP IS A HEALTH CARE DELIVERY MODEL THAT IMPROVES THE HEALTH AND WELL-BEING OF LOW-INCOME AND OTHER VULNERABLE POPULATIONS BY ADDRESSING UNMET LEGAL NEEDS AND REMOVING LEGAL BARRIERS THAT IMPEDE HEALTH. LEGAL PROFESSIONALS FROM THE LEGAL AID, LAW SCHOOL AND PRIVATE SECTOR PRO BONO COMMUNITIES ARE INTEGRATED INTO THE HEALTHCARE TEAM, WHERE THEY PARTNER WITH FRONT-LINE PHYSICIANS, NURSES, CASE MANAGERS AND OTHERS TO: (1) PROVIDE DIRECT LEGAL ASSISTANCE TO PATIENTS; (2) DEVELOP/ALIGN STRATEGIES TO IMPROVE HEALTH AND LEGAL INSTITUTIONS AND PRACTICES; AND (3) CHANGE POLICIES, ALL IN SERVICE OF ENSURING THAT VULNERABLE PEOPLE GET AND STAY HEALTHY. THE MEDICAL-LEGAL PARTNERSHIP MODEL IS UNIQUE BECAUSE IT BRIDGES PATIENT TO POPULATION LEVEL INTERVENTIONS AND ALSO ADDS A LEVEL OF INSTITUTIONAL SYSTEMS CHANGE. HEALTH AND LEGAL SERVICES ARE INTEGRATED, RATHER THAN OPERATING AS A REFERRAL MECHANISM, LEADING TO LONG-TERM, SUSTAINABLE, MORE EFFECTIVE SOLUTIONS TO HEALTH AND LEGAL PROBLEMS. ENVIRONMENTAL IMPROVEMENT RECOGNIZING THAT EFFECTIVE ADVOCACY FOR IMPROVED ACCESS TO HEALTH CARE INCLUDES WORK TO ENSURE THAT FAMILIES HAVE ACCESS TO AFFORDABLE TRANSPORTATION; CHILDREN'S HOSPITAL COLORADO SERVES AS A CHAMPION OF THE CAUSE OF EXPANDED LIGHT RAIL SERVICES TO THE ANSCHUTZ MEDICAL CAMPUS. CHILDREN'S HOSPITAL COLORADO PLAYED A LEADING ROLE IN COORDINATING ADVOCACY WORK WITH OTHER HEALTHCARE PLAYERS ON CAMPUS AND THE CITY OF AURORA TO ENSURE THAT OUR REGIONAL TRANSPORTATION DISTRICT (""RTD"") BEGIN WORK TO EXPAND THE LIGHT RAIL LINE DOWN THE HIGHWAY WITH THE CLOSEST PROXIMITY TO THE CAMPUS. FOLLOWING THIS SUCCESSFUL EFFORT, CHILDREN'S HOSPITAL COLORADO HAS STARTED WORK TO EXPAND THAT LINE EVEN FURTHER TO RUN THROUGH THE CAMPUS, FURTHER ENHANCING ACCESS TO CRITICAL MEDICAL SERVICES. LEADERSHIP DEVELOPMENT AND TRAINING FOR COMMUNITY MEMBERS THE FAMILY LEADERSHIP TRAINING INSTITUTE (FLTI) IS A FIRST-OF-ITS-KIND FAMILY CIVICS PROGRAM. THE GOALS OF FLTI ARE TO EFFECT POSITIVE FAMILY LEADERSHIP DEVELOPMENT BY: 1) HELPING FAMILIES BECOME LEADERS IN THEIR COMMUNITIES THROUGH CIVIC ENGAGEMENT; 2) EXPANDING AND FACILITATING THE CAPACITY OF FAMILIES TO BE CHANGE AGENTS ON A NEIGHBORHOOD, REGIONAL AND STATE LEVEL; 3) DEVELOPING SUPPORTIVE COMMUNITIES OF FAMILIES WITHIN REGIONS OF THE STATE; 4) FACILITATING FAMILY INVOLVEMENT IN STATE AND LOCAL POLICY DECISION-MAKING PROCESSES; 5) INCREASING PARENT-CHILD INTERACTION THROUGH FAMILY INVOLVEMENT. CHILDREN'S HOSPITAL COLORADO ALONG WITH THE COLORADO DEPARTMENT OF PUBLIC HEALTH AND ENVIRONMENT, COLORADO STATE UNIVERSITY EXTENSION, COLORADO DEPARTMENT OF HUMAN SERVICES, AND COLORADO HEALTH FOUNDATION ARE PRIMARY PARTNERS OF THIS STATE-WIDE INITIATIVE.PROGRAM GRADUATES SPEND MORE THAN 120 HOURS TO DEVELOP SKILLS NEEDED TO BECOME EFFECTIVE LEADERS IN THEIR COMMUNITIES. ONCE RECRUITED AND ACCEPTED IN TO THE PROGRAM, PARTICIPANTS ATTEND A 20-WEEK CURRICULUM THAT INTEGRATES PERSONAL AND CHILD DEVELOPMENT, LEADERSHIP TRAINING, CIVIC LITERACY AND CIVIC PARTICIPATION SKILLS. THE CURRICULUM INCLUDES FOUR COMPONENTS: AN INITIAL RETREAT, TWO 10-WEEK SESSIONS THAT FOCUS ON KNOWLEDGE ABOUT THE CHANGE PROCESS, SKILL BUILDING, AND TOOLS OF CIVIC ENGAGEMENT, AND A COMMUNITY PROJECT. COALITION BUILDING CHILDREN'S HOSPITAL COLORADO'S MAIN HOSPITAL IS LOCATED ON THE ANSCHUTZ MEDICAL CAMPUS IN AURORA, COLORADO. THE COMMUNITY CONSISTS OF MANY LOW-INCOME NEIGHBORHOODS AND COMMUNITIES WITH SIGNIFICANT UNMET HEALTHCARE NEEDS. THROUGH AURORA HEALTH ACCESS (AHA), CHILDREN'S HOSPITAL COLORADO HAS SUPPORTED A MULTI-PRONGED APPROACH TO CREATING A CULTURE OF HEALTH IN AURORA - AN APPROACH THAT AIMS TO REDUCE THE NUMBER OF UNINSURED, PROMOTE ACCESS TO CARE, IMPROVE CARE COORDINATION, AND ENCOURAGE HEALTHY BEHAVIORS. IN PARTICULAR, CHILDREN'S HOSPITAL COLORADO LEADS THE PEDIATRIC ACCESS TO CARE SUBCOMMITTEE AND HELPS TO FOCUS THE COALITION'S EFFORTS ON IMPROVING ACCESS TO PRIMARY CARE AND MEDICAL HOMES FOR CHILDREN. COMMUNITY HEALTH IMPROVEMENT (ADVOCACY) AS PART OF ITS ONGOING MISSION, CHILDREN'S HOSPITAL COLORADO IS COMMITTED TO ADVOCATING ON BEHALF OF CHILDREN BY WORKING TO INFLUENCE PUBLIC POLICY BOTH AT A HIGH LEVEL AND THROUGH GRASSROOTS SUPPORT. THE HOSPITAL PROACTIVELY INFLUENCES LOCAL, STATE AND FEDERAL HEALTHCARE POLICY THAT IMPACTS ISSUES IDENTIFIED IN THE COMMUNITY NEEDS ASSESSMENT SUCH AS CHILDHOOD OBESITY, BEHAVIORAL HEALTH, INJURY PREVENTION AND ACCESS TO CARE. CHILDREN'S HOSPITAL COLORADO HAS ALSO DEVELOPED A PROGRAM THAT TEACHES PATIENTS, FAMILIES AND COMMUNITY MEMBERS HOW TO ADVOCATE ON BEHALF OF THE INTERESTS IMPORTANT TO THEM, THEREBY ADDRESSING THE NEED FOR COMMUNITY EMPOWERMENT. CHILDREN'S HOSPITAL COLORADO HAS A GRASSROOTS ADVOCACY NETWORK COMPRISED OF NEARLY 4,000 ADVOCATES ACROSS THE STATE. THE GOAL IN LEADING THIS NETWORK IS TO MAKE IT SIMPLE FOR ALL COMMUNITY MEMBERS TO SPEAK UP ON BEHALF OF CHILD HEALTH ISSUES. COMMUNITY HEALTH IMPROVEMENT (LITERACY) A CRITICAL COMPONENT TO LIVING A HEALTHY LIFE IS THE ABILITY FOR PEOPLE TO ACCESS INFORMATION THEY NEED ABOUT THEIR HEALTH. THIS CANNOT BE DONE EFFECTIVELY WITHOUT BASIC LITERACY SKILLS. UNDERSTANDING THAT CHILDREN'S HOSPITAL COLORADO IS INVESTED IN CREATING PROGRAMS THAT ADDRESS THE ENTIRE PICTURE OF HEALTH; WE COMMITTED SIGNIFICANT RESOURCES TO IMPROVE LOW INCOME, HIGH RISK POPULATION LITERACY RATES. CHILDREN'S HOSPITAL COLORADO HAS TEAMED UP WITH REACH OUT AND READ WITH THE GOAL OF ENROLLING 100% OF LOW INCOME CHILDREN IN THIS EVIDENCE BASED LITERACY PROGRAM RUN THROUGH PRIMARY CARE OFFICES DURING WELL CHILD VISITS. BECAUSE 90% OF BRAIN DEVELOPMENT OCCURS BETWEEN BIRTH AND AGE 5 WE WANTED TO UTILIZE A PROGRAM THAT OFFERS AN EFFECTIVE INTERVENTION DURING A CRITICAL WINDOW FOR LEARNING. WE RECOGNIZE THAT IF CHILDREN MISS THE OPPORTUNITY TO ACQUIRE FOUNDATIONAL LANGUAGE SKILLS, THEY ARE SET UP FOR IMMEDIATE STRUGGLES THAT IMPACT THEIR OVERALL HEALTH AND WELL-BEING. WE ARE USING OUR RELATIONSHIPS WITH COMMUNITY PHYSICIANS AND OUR ADVOCACY EXPERTISE AND RESOURCES TO SUPPORT OUR OBJECTIVE. WORKFORCE DEVELOPMENT FOUNDED AT CHILDREN'S IN 1998, THE MEDICAL CAREER COLLABORATIVE PROGRAM (MC2), IS A HANDS ON LEARNING PROGRAM THAT SERVES LOW INCOME MINORITY YOUTH INTERESTED IN PURSUING A CAREER IN THE HEALTH CARE FIELD. MC2 SERVES AS AN EDUCATIONAL AND SUPPORTIVE OUTLET FOR HIGH ACHIEVING AND DRIVEN STUDENTS WHO OFTEN LACK NECESSARY SUPPORTS IN THEIR COMMUNITIES. THE PROGRAM'S MISSION OF HELPING HIGH SCHOOL STUDENTS FROM DIVERSE BACKGROUNDS EXPLORE THE WORLD OF HEALTHCARE AND DISCOVER THE OPPORTUNITIES AVAILABLE TO THEM IN THE MEDICAL INDUSTRY, IS A STRATEGIC PROGRAM AS PART OF HR'S WORKFORCE DEVELOPMENT EFFORTS. AS THE PROGRAM INVESTS IN THESE STUDENTS IT IS ESSENTIALLY INCREASING THE DIVERSITY AND CULTURAL AWARENESS OF THE HEALTHCARE WORKFORCE AS IT BUILDS THE NEXT GENERATION OF PROFESSIONALS HERE AT CHILDREN'S COLORADO AND IN THE COMMUNITY. IN 2013 THERE WERE 50 ACTIVE STUDENTS AND 20 ACTIVE GRADUATES. GRADUATES."

201423179349301927,226019101,"PART III, LINE 8","Medicare costs were derived from the 2012 Medicare cost report. The organization's position is that Medicare underpayments and bad debt are community benefits and associated costs should be includable on Form 990, Schedule H, Part I as outlined more fully below. The organization believes that these services and related costs promote health of the community as a whole and are rendered in conjunction with the organization's charitable tax-exempt purpose and mission in providing medically necessary healthcare services to all individuals in a non-discriminatory manner without regard to race, color, creed, sex, national origin, religion or ability to pay and consistent with the Community Benefit Standard promulgated by the IRS. The Community Benefit Standard is the current standard for a hospital for recognition as a tax-exempt and charitable organization under the Internal Revenue Code (IRC) 501(c)(3). The organization is recognized as a tax-exempt and charitable organization under the Internal Revenue Code (IRC) 501(c)(3). Although there is no definition in the tax code for the term ""charitable"", a regulation promulgated by the Department of the Treasury provides some guidance and states that the term charitable is used in section 501(c)(3) in its generally accepted legal sense, and provides examples of charitable purposes, including the relief of the poor or unprivileged, the promotion of social welfare, and the advancement of education and science. Note, it does not explicitly address the activities of hospitals in the absence of explicit statutory or regulatory requirements applying the term ""charitable"" to hospitals, it has been left to the IRS to determine the criteria hospitals must meet to qualify as an IRC 501(c)(3) charitable organization. The original standard was known as the Charity Care Standard. This standard was replaced by the IRS with the Community Benefit Standard which is the current Charity Care Standard. In 1956, the IRS issued revenue ruling 56-185, which addressed the requirements hospitals needed to meet in order to qualify for IRC 501(c)(3) status. One of these requirements is known as the Charity Care Standard. Under the standard, a hospital had to provide, to the extent of its financial ability, free or reduced-cost care to patients unable to pay for it. A hospital that expected full payment did not, according to the ruling, provide charity care. The ruling emphasized that a low level of charity care did not necessarily mean that a hospital had failed to meet the requirement since that level could reflect its financial ability to provide such care. The ruling also noted that a publically supported community hospital would normally qualify as a charitable organization because it serves the entire community, and a low level of charity care would not affect a hospitals exempt status if it was due to the surrounding community lack of charitable demands. In 1969, the IRS issued revenue ruling 69-545 which removed from ruling 56-185 the requirements relating to caring for patients without charge or at rates below costs. Under the standard developed in ruling 69-545, which is know as the ""Community Benefit Standard"", hospitals are judged on whether they promote health of a broad class of individuals in the community. The ruling involved a hospital that only admitted individuals who could pay for the services (by themselves, private insurance, or public programs such as Medicare), but operated a full-time Emergency Room that was open to everyone. The IRS ruled that the hospital qualified as a charitable organization because it promoted the health of people in its community. The IRS reasoned that because the promotion of health was a charitable purpose according to the general law of charity, it fell within the ""generally accepted legal sense"" of the term ""charitable"", as required by Treasury Regulation 1.501 (c)(3)-1(d)(2). The IRS ruling stated that the promotion of health, like the relief of poverty and the advancement of education and religion, is one of the purposes in the general law of charity that is deemed beneficial to the community as a whole, even though the class of beneficiaries eligible to receive a direct benefit from its activities does not include all members of the community, such as indigent members of the community, provided that the class is not so small that its relief is not of benefit to the community. The IRS concluded that the hospital was promoting the health of a class of persons that is broad enough to benefit the community because its Emergency Room was open to all and it provided care to everyone who could pay, whether directly or through third-party reimbursement. Other characteristics of the hospital that the IRS highlighted included the following: o Its surplus funds were used to improve patient care, expand hospital facilities, and advance medical training, education and research. o It was controlled by a Board of Trustees that consisted of independent civic leaders. o Hospital medical staff privileges were available to all qualified physicians. The organization believes that Medicare underpayments and bad debt are community benefits and associated costs should be includable on Form 990, Schedule H, Part I. The American Hospital Association's (AHA) position is that Medicare underpayments and bad debt are community benefits and associated costs should be includable on Form 990, Schedule H, Part I. This organization agrees with the AHA position as outlined in the AHA letter to the IRS dated August 21, 2007. With respect to the first published draft of the new Form 990 and Schedule H, the AHA felt that the IRS should incorporate the full value of the community benefit that hospitals provide by counting Medicare underpayments as quantifiable community benefit for the following reasons; o Providing care for the elderly and serving Medicare patients is an essential part of the Community Benefit Standard. o Medicare, like Medicaid, does not pay the full cost of care. Medicare reimburses the hospital only 92 cents for every dollar they spend to take care of Medicare patients. o Many Medicare beneficiaries, like their Medicaid counterparts, are poor. More than 46 percent of Medicare spending is for beneficiaries whose income is below 200 percent Federal poverty level. Many of those Medicare beneficiaries are also eligible for Medicaid, so called dual eligibles. There is every compelling public policy reason to treat Medicare and Medicaid underpayments similarly for the purposes of a hospital's community benefit and include the costs on Form 990, Schedule H, Part I. Medicare underpayment must be shouldered by the hospital in order to continue treating the community's elderly and poor. These underpayments represent a real cost of serving the community and should count as a quantifiable community benefit. Both the AHA and this organization also feel that patient bad debt is a community benefit and thus includable on Form 990, Schedule H, Part I. Like Medicare underpayment, there also are compelling reasons that patient bad debt should be counted as a quantifiable community benefit. A significant majority of bad debt is attributable to low-income patients, who, for many reasons, decline to complete the forms required to establish eligibility for the hospital's Charity Care or Financial Assistance programs. A 2006 Congressional Budget Office Report, Nonprofit Hospitals and the Provision of Community Benefits, cited two studies indicating that ""the great majority of bad debt was attributable to patients with incomes below 200 percent of the Federal Poverty Line"". The report also noted that a substantial portion of bad debt is pending Charity Care. Unlike bad debt in other industries, hospital bad debt is complicated by the fact that hospitals follow their mission to the community and treat every patient that comes through their Emergency department, regardless of their ability to pay. Patients who have outstanding bills are not turned away, unlike other industries. Bad debt is further complicated by auditing industry standards on reporting Charity Care, many patients cannot or do not provide the necessary extensive documentation required to be deemed Charity Care by the auditors. As a result, roughly 40% of bad debt is pending Charity Care."

HEALTH-CARE ORGANIZATIONS GENERALLY PROVIDE TIMELY AND SPECIFIC RESOURCES TO HELP THESE ISSUES.

MANAGEMENT PERIODICALLY ASSESSES THE ADEQUACY OF THIS ALLOWANCE BASED UPON HISTORICAL COLLECTION AND WRITE-OFF EXPERIENCE BY PAYOR CATEGORY. THE RESULTS OF THESE REVIEWS ARE USED TO MODIFY, AS NECESSARY, THE PROVISION FOR BAD DEBTS AND TO ESTABLISH APPROPRIATE ALLOWANCES FOR UNCOLLECTIBLE PATIENT ACCOUNTS RECEIVABLE. AFTER SATISFACTION OF AMOUNTS DUE FROM INSURANCE, CHS FOLLOWS ESTABLISHED GUIDELINES FOR PLACING CERTAIN PATIENT BALANCES WITH COLLECTION AGENCIES, SUBJECT TO CERTAIN RESTRICTIONS ON COLLECTION EFFORTS AS DETERMINED BY EACH FACILITY. ACCOUNT BALANCES ARE CHARGED OFF AGAINST THE ALLOWANCE AFTER ALL MEANS OF COLLECTION HAVE BEEN EXHAUSTED AND THE POTENTIAL FOR RECOVERY IS CONSIDERED REMOTE.

MERCY INCURRED A LOSS OF APPROXIMATELY $7.2 MILLION TO DELIVER CARE TO MEDICARE PATIENTS. THIS REPRESENTS THE AMOUNT BY WHICH COSTS TO DELIVER CARE TO MEDICARE RECIPIENTS EXCEEDS THE LEVEL OF PAYMENT. MERCY BEARS THE BURDEN OF NOT ONLY PROVIDING THE BEST AND MOST ADVANCED MEDICAL CARE POSSIBLE TO THE COMMUNITY, BUT ALSO DOING SO WITH NO RECOURSE TO OBTAIN PAYMENT FOR THE COST OF PROVIDING CARE IN EXCESS OF THE MEDICARE PAYMENT. AS MEDICARE REVENUE DECLINES AND THE COST TO PROVIDE CUTTING EDGE CARE TO THE COMMUNITY INCREASES, THE HOSPITAL WILL CARRY THE BURDEN.

THE HEALTHY SUNDAYS PROGRAM, WHICH PROVIDES FREE HEALTH SCREENINGS AND EDUCATION TO THE UNDERSERVED FOLLOWING WORSHIP SERVICES, SERVES AS A PRIMARY SOURCE OF PUBLIC PARTICIPATION, AS COMMUNITY NEEDS SURVEYS (AVAILABLE IN ENGLISH AND SPANISH) ARE OFTEN DISTRIBUTED AT THESE SCREENING SITES. THUS EVERY POINT OF CONTACT DOUBLES AS AN OPPORTUNITY TO REQUEST FEEDBACK ON HOW THE HOSPITAL CAN BETTER MEET THE NEEDS OF THE COMMUNITY. THESE EVENTS ARE PROMOTED VIA CALENDAR LISTINGS IN PARISH BULLETINS AND FLYERS POSTED IN PLACES OF BUSINESS AND WORSHIP IN THE COMMUNITY SURROUNDING THE OUTREACH SITE AND ON CHS'S WEBSITE. MERCY HAS CONTINUED TO WORK WITH THE TOWN OF HEMPSTEAD DEPARTMENT OF SENIOR ENRICHMENT AND THE NASSAU COUNTY DEPARTMENT OF SENIOR AFFAIRS ON THE FALLS INITIATIVE.

EDUCATIONAL MATERIALS WERE DISTRIBUTED AT VARIOUS EVENTS FOR MOST OF THE NATIONAL HEALTH AWARENESS DAYS - BREAST CANCER, PROSTATE CANCER, SKIN CANCER, DIABETES, AND HEART. AT MANY OF THESE EVENTS, FREE SCREENINGS WERE GIVEN TO THOSE WHO ATTENDED. A PATIENT NAVIGATION PROGRAM PROVIDES AN RN NAVIGATOR TO HELP THOSE PATIENTS DIAGNOSED WITH CANCER TO NAVIGATE THE SYSTEM AND GET THE HEALTH CARE THEY NEED AND DESERVE. FREE COMMUNITY LECTURES WERE CONDUCTED THROUGHOUT THE YEAR AT VARIOUS PLACES THROUGHOUT THE ISLAND - FAIRS, LIBRARIES, SENIOR CENTERS, CHURCHES, ETC. FREE SUPPORT GROUPS WERE AGAIN OFFERED IN 2013, OPEN TO EVERYONE. THEY WERE AVAILABLE FOR BREAST CANCER AND BREAST HEALTH, DIABETES, OSTOMY CARE, STROKE, SUBSTANCE AND ALCOHOL ABUSE AND BREAST FEEDING.

MERCY IS A SMOKE FREE CAMPUS (EXCEPT FOR THE PSYCHIATRIC INPATIENT UNIT WHICH HAS A CLEARLY DEFINED POLICY WHEN ITS PATIENTS MAY SMOKE). ALL PATIENTS ARE SCREENED UPON ADMISSION AND THOSE IDENTIFIED AS SMOKERS ARE ENTERED INTO A DATA BASE, SO NURSING STAFF CAN EDUCATE PATIENTS MOST IN NEED. MERCY INCLUDES SMOKING CESSATION DRUGS TO ITS FORMULARY. MERCY USES PHARMACY MEDICATION RECORDS TO TRACK THE NUMBER OF PATIENTS WITH PRESCRIPTIONS WRITTEN FOR A SMOKING CESSATION MEDICATION. MERCY EMPLOYEES OFFER SMOKING CESSATION INFORMATION, REFERRALS TO SMOKING CESSATION PROGRAMS AND NY-QUIT LINE CARDS AT ALL COMMUNITY OUTREACH EVENTS. MERCY OFFERS SMOKING CESSATION PROGRAMS TO EMPLOYEES THROUGH ITS EMPLOYEE ASSISTANCE PROGRAM AND TO PHYSICIANS THROUGH THE CENTER FOR TOBACCO CONTROL.

HNMC ALSO ASSISTS OTHER NON-PROFITS AND PROVIDES VARIOUS FORMS OF NON-MONETARY AID. IN ADDITION, EMPLOYEES ARE PERMITTED TO ASSIST VALID NON-PROFIT ORGANIZATIONS DURING PAID WORK TIME. AMONG THE ORGANIZATIONS SO AIDED ARE NURSING HOMES, BOY SCOUTS, HOUSES OF WORSHIP, COMMUNITY SERVICE GROUPS, BATTERED WOMEN'S SHELTERS, ROTARY CLUBS, POLICE GROUPS, ENVIRONMENTAL GROUPS, SCHOOLS, AND NURSING HOMES.

CAREER DAYS ARE HELD FOR LOCAL HIGH SCHOOLS, FOSTERING ENTRANCE OF INTERESTED AND APPLICABLE STUDENTS INTO THE HEALTH PROFESSIONS. ALTHOUGH HNMC'S PARKING FEES ARE MINIMAL, FREE PARKING IS EXTENDED TO PERSONS IN NEED. DURING 2013, HNMC WAS ONE OF NINE HOSPITALS IN NEW JERSEY DESIGNATED BY THE NEW JERSEY DEPARTMENT OF HEALTH (""NJDOH"") AS A REGIONAL MEDICAL COORDINATION CENTER (""MCC"").

THE MCC ALSO MONITORED, ON A DAILY BASIS, SITUATIONAL AWARENESS OF LOCAL ACTIVITY. TO DATE, THE MCC HAS BEEN ACTIVATED FOR SEVERAL STATE EMERGENCIES.

201443219349303214,221487322,"SCHEDULE H, PART III, SECTION B; LINE 8","MEDICARE COSTS WERE DERIVED FROM THE HOSPITAL'S COST ACCOUNTING SYSTEM. MEDICARE UNDERPAYMENTS AND BAD DEBT ARE CONSIDERED TO BE COMMUNITY BENEFIT AND ASSOCIATED COSTS ARE INCLUDABLE ON THE FORM 990, SCHEDULE H, PART I. THE ORGANIZATION FEELS THAT MEDICARE UNDERPAYMENTS (SHORTFALL) AND BAD DEBT ARE COMMUNITY BENEFIT AND ASSOCIATED COSTS ARE INCLUDABLE ON THE FORM 990, SCHEDULE H, PART I. AS OUTLINED MORE FULLY BELOW THE ORGANIZATION BELIEVES THAT THESE SERVICES AND RELATED COSTS PROMOTE THE HEALTH OF THE COMMUNITY AS A WHOLE AND ARE RENDERED IN CONJUNCTION WITH THE ORGANIZATION'S CHARITABLE TAX-EXEMPT PURPOSES AND MISSION IN PROVIDING MEDICALLY NECESSARY HEALTH CARE SERVICES TO ALL INDIVIDUALS IN A NON-DISCRIMINATORY MANNER WITHOUT REGARD TO RACE, COLOR, CREED, SEX, NATIONAL ORIGIN, RELIGION OR ABILITY TO PAY AND CONSISTENT WITH THE COMMUNITY BENEFIT STANDARD PROMULGATED BY THE IRS. THE COMMUNITY BENEFIT STANDARD IS THE CURRENT STANDARD FOR A HOSPITAL FOR RECOGNITION AS A TAX-EXEMPT AND CHARITABLE ORGANIZATION UNDER INTERNAL REVENUE CODE (""IRC"") 501(C)(3). THE MEDICAL CENTER IS RECOGNIZED AS A TAX-EXEMPT ENTITY AND CHARITABLE ORGANIZATION UNDER 501(C)(3) OF THE IRC. ALTHOUGH THERE IS NO DEFINITION IN THE TAX CODE FOR THE TERM ""CHARITABLE,"" A REGULATION PROMULGATED BY THE DEPARTMENT OF THE TREASURY PROVIDES SOME GUIDANCE AND STATES THAT ""[T]HE TERM CHARITABLE IS USED IN SECTION 501(C)(3) IN ITS GENERALLY ACCEPTED LEGAL SENSE,"" AND PROVIDES EXAMPLES OF CHARITABLE PURPOSES, INCLUDING: THE RELIEF OF THE POOR OR UNPRIVILEGED; THE PROMOTION OF SOCIAL WELFARE; AND THE ADVANCEMENT OF EDUCATION, RELIGION, AND SCIENCE. NOTE IT DOES NOT EXPLICITLY ADDRESS THE ACTIVITIES OF HOSPITALS. IN THE ABSENCE OF EXPLICIT STATUTORY OR REGULATORY REQUIREMENTS APPLYING THE TERM ""CHARITABLE"" TO HOSPITALS, IT HAS BEEN LEFT TO THE IRS TO DETERMINE THE CRITERIA HOSPITALS MUST MEET TO QUALIFY AS IRC 501(C)(3) CHARITABLE ORGANIZATIONS. THE ORIGINAL STANDARD WAS KNOWN AS THE CHARITY CARE STANDARD. THIS STANDARD WAS REPLACED BY THE IRS WITH THE COMMUNITY BENEFIT STANDARD WHICH IS THE CURRENT STANDARD. CHARITY CARE STANDARD IN 1956, THE IRS ISSUED REVENUE RULING 56-185, WHICH ADDRESSED THE REQUIREMENTS HOSPITALS NEEDED TO MEET IN ORDER TO QUALIFY FOR IRC 501(C)(3) STATUS. ONE OF THESE REQUIREMENTS IS KNOWN AS THE ""CHARITY CARE STANDARD."" UNDER THE STANDARD, A HOSPITAL HAD TO PROVIDE, TO THE EXTENT OF ITS FINANCIAL ABILITY, FREE OR REDUCED-COST CARE TO PATIENTS UNABLE TO PAY FOR IT. A HOSPITAL THAT EXPECTED FULL PAYMENT DID NOT, ACCORDING TO THE RULING, PROVIDE CHARITY CARE BASED ON THE FACT THAT SOME PATIENTS ULTIMATELY FAILED TO PAY. THE RULING EMPHASIZED THAT A LOW LEVEL OF CHARITY CARE DID NOT NECESSARILY MEAN THAT A HOSPITAL HAD FAILED TO MEET THE REQUIREMENT SINCE THAT LEVEL COULD REFLECT ITS FINANCIAL ABILITY TO PROVIDE SUCH CARE. THE RULING ALSO NOTED THAT PUBLICLY SUPPORTED COMMUNITY HOSPITALS WOULD NORMALLY QUALIFY AS CHARITABLE ORGANIZATIONS BECAUSE THEY SERVE THE ENTIRE COMMUNITY, AND A LOW LEVEL OF CHARITY CARE WOULD NOT AFFECT A HOSPITAL'S EXEMPT STATUS IF IT WAS DUE TO THE SURROUNDING COMMUNITY'S LACK OF CHARITABLE DEMANDS. COMMUNITY BENEFIT STANDARD IN 1969, THE IRS ISSUED REVENUE RULING 69-545, WHICH ""REMOVE[D]"" FROM REVENUE RULING 56-185 ""THE REQUIREMENTS RELATING TO CARING FOR PATIENTS WITHOUT CHARGE OR AT RATES BELOW COST."" UNDER THE STANDARD DEVELOPED IN REVENUE RULING 69-545, WHICH IS KNOWN AS THE ""COMMUNITY BENEFIT STANDARD,"" HOSPITALS ARE JUDGED ON WHETHER THEY PROMOTE THE HEALTH OF A BROAD CLASS OF INDIVIDUALS IN THE COMMUNITY. THE RULING INVOLVED A HOSPITAL THAT ONLY ADMITTED INDIVIDUALS WHO COULD PAY FOR THE SERVICES (BY THEMSELVES, PRIVATE INSURANCE, OR PUBLIC PROGRAMS SUCH AS MEDICARE), BUT OPERATED A FULL-TIME EMERGENCY ROOM THAT WAS OPEN TO EVERYONE. THE IRS RULED THAT THE HOSPITAL QUALIFIED AS A CHARITABLE ORGANIZATION BECAUSE IT PROMOTED THE HEALTH OF PEOPLE IN ITS COMMUNITY. THE IRS REASONED THAT BECAUSE THE PROMOTION OF HEALTH WAS A CHARITABLE PURPOSE ACCORDING TO THE GENERAL LAW OF CHARITY, IT FELL WITHIN THE ""GENERALLY ACCEPTED LEGAL SENSE"" OF THE TERM ""CHARITABLE,"" AS REQUIRED BY TREASURY REG. 1.501(C)(3)-1(D)(2). THE IRS RULING STATED THAT THE PROMOTION OF HEALTH, LIKE THE RELIEF OF POVERTY AND THE ADVANCEMENT OF EDUCATION AND RELIGION, IS ONE OF THE PURPOSES IN THE GENERAL LAW OF CHARITY THAT IS DEEMED BENEFICIAL TO THE COMMUNITY AS A WHOLE EVEN THOUGH THE CLASS OF BENEFICIARIES ELIGIBLE TO RECEIVE A DIRECT BENEFIT FROM ITS ACTIVITIES DOES NOT INCLUDE ALL MEMBERS OF THE COMMUNITY, SUCH AS INDIGENT MEMBERS OF THE COMMUNITY, PROVIDED THAT THE CLASS IS NOT SO SMALL THAT ITS RELIEF IS NOT OF BENEFIT TO THE COMMUNITY. THE IRS CONCLUDED THAT THE HOSPITAL WAS ""PROMOTING THE HEALTH OF A CLASS OF PERSONS THAT IS BROAD ENOUGH TO BENEFIT THE COMMUNITY"" BECAUSE ITS EMERGENCY ROOM WAS OPEN TO ALL AND IT PROVIDED CARE TO EVERYONE WHO COULD PAY, WHETHER DIRECTLY OR THROUGH THIRD-PARTY REIMBURSEMENT. OTHER CHARACTERISTICS OF THE HOSPITAL THAT THE IRS HIGHLIGHTED INCLUDED THE FOLLOWING: ITS SURPLUS FUNDS WERE USED TO IMPROVE PATIENT CARE, EXPAND HOSPITAL FACILITIES, AND ADVANCE MEDICAL TRAINING, EDUCATION, AND RESEARCH; IT WAS CONTROLLED BY A BOARD OF TRUSTEES THAT CONSISTED OF INDEPENDENT CIVIC LEADERS; AND HOSPITAL MEDICAL STAFF PRIVILEGES WERE AVAILABLE TO ALL QUALIFIED PHYSICIANS. MEDICARE UNDERPAYMENTS AND BAD DEBT ARE COMMUNITY BENEFIT AND ASSOCIATED COSTS ARE INCLUDABLE ON THE FORM 990, SCHEDULE H, PART I. THE AMERICAN HOSPITAL ASSOCIATION (""AHA"") HOLDS THE POSITION THAT MEDICARE UNDERPAYMENTS (OR, ""SHORTFALLS"") AND BAD DEBT ARE COMMUNITY BENEFIT AND THUS INCLUDABLE ON THE FORM 990, SCHEDULE H, PART I. THE MEDICAL CENTER AGREES WITH THE AHA'S POSITION. AS OUTLINED IN THE AHA LETTER TO THE IRS DATED AUGUST 21, 2007 WITH RESPECT TO THE FIRST PUBLISHED DRAFT OF THE NEW FORM 990 AND SCHEDULE H, THE AHA STATED THAT THE IRS SHOULD INCORPORATE THE FULL VALUE OF THE COMMUNITY BENEFIT PROVIDED BY HOSPITALS BY COUNTING MEDICARE UNDERPAYMENTS (SHORTFALL) AS QUANTIFIABLE COMMUNITY BENEFIT FOR THE FOLLOWING REASONS: - THE PROVISION OF CARE FOR THE ELDERLY AND SERVING MEDICARE PATIENTS IS AN ESSENTIAL PART OF THE COMMUNITY BENEFIT STANDARD. - MEDICARE, LIKE MEDICAID, DOES NOT FUND THE FULL COST OF CARE. MEDICARE'S REIMBURSEMENT TO HOSPITALS EQUATES TO ONLY 92 CENTS FOR EVERY DOLLAR SPENT BY THE HOSPITALS ON CARE OF MEDICARE PATIENTS. THE MEDICARE PAYMENT ADVISORY COMMISSION (""MEDPAC"") IN ITS MARCH 2007 REPORT TO CONGRESS CAUTIONED THAT UNDERPAYMENT WILL WORSEN. - MANY MEDICARE BENEFICIARIES, LIKE THEIR MEDICAID COUNTERPARTS, ARE POOR. MORE THAN 46 PERCENT OF MEDICARE SPENDING IS FOR BENEFICIARIES WHOSE INCOME IS BELOW 200 PERCENT OF THE FEDERAL POVERTY LEVEL. MANY OF THOSE MEDICARE BENEFICIARIES ARE ALSO ELIGIBLE FOR MEDICAID, THE SO CALLED ""DUAL ELIGIBLES."" THERE IS A VERY COMPELLING PUBLIC POLICY REASON TO TREAT MEDICARE AND MEDICAID UNDERPAYMENTS SIMILARLY FOR PURPOSES OF A HOSPITAL'S COMMUNITY BENEFIT AND INCLUDE THESE COSTS ON FORM 990, SCHEDULE H, PART I. MEDICARE UNDERPAYMENT MUST BE SHOULDERED BY THE HOSPITAL IN ORDER TO CONTINUE TREATING THE COMMUNITY'S ELDERLY AND POOR. THESE UNDERPAYMENTS REPRESENT A REAL COST OF SERVING THE COMMUNITY AND SHOULD COUNT AS A QUANTIFIABLE COMMUNITY BENEFIT. BOTH THE AHA AND THE MEDICAL CENTER ALSO REGARD PATIENT BAD DEBT AS A COMMUNITY BENEFIT AND THUS INCLUDABLE ON THE FORM 990, SCHEDULE H, PART I. SIMILAR TO MEDICARE UNDERPAYMENT (SHORTFALLS), THERE ALSO ARE COMPELLING REASONS THAT PATIENT BAD DEBT SHOULD BE COUNTED AS QUANTIFIABLE COMMUNITY BENEFIT AS NOTED BELOW: - A SIGNIFICANT MAJORITY OF BAD DEBT IS ATTRIBUTABLE TO LOW-INCOME PATIENTS, WHO, FOR MANY REASONS, DECLINE TO COMPLETE THE FORMS REQUIRED TO ESTABLISH ELIGIBILITY FOR HOSPITALS' CHARITY CARE OR FINANCIAL ASSISTANCE PROGRAMS. A 2006 CONGRESSIONAL BUDGET OFFICE (""CBO"") REPORT, NON-PROFIT HOSPITALS AND THE PROVISION OF COMMUNITY BENEFITS, CITED TWO STUDIES INDICATING THAT ""THE GREAT MAJORITY OF BAD DEBT WAS ATTRIBUTABLE TO PATIENTS WITH INCOMES BELOW 200% OF THE FEDERAL POVERTY LINE."" - THE REPORT ALSO NOTED THAT A SUBSTANTIAL PORTION OF BAD DEBT IS ACTUALLY PENDING CHARITY CARE. UNLIKE BAD DEBT IN OTHER INDUSTRIES, HOSPITAL BAD DEBT IS COMPLICATED BY THE FACT THAT HOSPITALS FOLLOW THEIR MISSION TO THE COMMUNITY AND TREAT EVERY PATIENT THAT COMES THROUGH THEIR EMERGENCY DEPARTMENTS, REGARDLESS OF ABILITY TO PAY. PATIENTS WHO HAVE OUTSTANDING BILLS ARE NOT TURNED AWAY, IN SHARP CONTRAST TO OTHER INDUSTRIES. BAD DEBT IS FURTHER COMPLICATED BY THE AUDITING INDUSTRY'S STANDARDS ON REPORTING CHARITY CARE. MANY PATIENTS CANNOT OR DO NOT PROVIDE THE NECESSARY, EXTENSIVE DOCUMENTATION REQUIRED TO BE DEEMED CHARITY CARE BY AUDITORS. AS A RESULT, ROUGHLY 40% OF BAD DEBT IS PENDING CHARITY CARE. - THE CBO CONCLUDED THAT ITS FINDINGS ""SUPPORT THE VALIDITY OF THE USE OF UNCOMPENSATED CARE (BAD DEBT AND CHARITY CARE) AS A MEASURE OF COMMUNITY BENEFITS,"" ASSUM"

IT IS THE POLICY OF HNMC AND SUBSIDIARIES' BUSINESS OFFICE TO TREAT ALL PATIENTS EQUALLY REGARDLESS OF INSURANCE AND THEIR ABILITY TO PAY. FOR ACCOUNTS DETERMINED TO BE ""SELF-PAY"" AND/OR ACCOUNTS WITH BALANCE AFTER PRIMARY INSURANCE PAYMENTS, THE COLLECTION POLICY REQUIRES THE SENDING OF THREE STATEMENTS, A MINIMUM OF ONE PRE-COLLECTION LETTER, AND TELEPHONE CONTACT FOR ANY ACCOUNT OVER $5,000, OR AT THE DISCRETION OF THE ACCOUNT REPRESENTATIVE AND/OR SUPERVISOR. THE MEDICAL CENTER ALSO HAS A CHARITY CARE ACCESS POLICY TO ASSURE PATIENTS ARE PROVIDED WITH CHARITY CARE ASSISTANCE AS DETERMINED BY STATE AND FEDERAL REGULATIONS. IT IS THE POLICY TO INFORM ALL PATIENTS DEEMED SELF-PAY OF THE APPROPRIATE ASSISTANCE PROGRAMS AVAILABLE. PATIENTS APPLYING FOR CHARITY CARE ASSISTANCE ARE FINANCIALLY SCREENED BY A RESOURCE ADVISOR TO DETERMINE ELIGIBILITY ACCORDING TO STATE AND FEDERAL GUIDELINES AND ARE INFORMED OF DOCUMENTATION REQUIRED TO COMPLETE A CHARITY CARE APPLICATION. PATIENTS NOT ELIGIBLE FOR CHARITY CARE RECEIVE FINANCIAL COUNSELING FOR ALL OTHER OPTIONS. QUALIFIED PATIENTS ARE REFERRED TO ALL APPROPRIATE AGENCIES OR PROGRAMS TO MEET OTHER FINANCIAL NEEDS.

HNMC ALSO COMMISSIONS EXTERNAL SPECIALISTS TO CONDUCT SURVEYS AND FOCUS GROUPS OF INDIVIDUALS, HOUSEHOLDS, PHYSICIANS, AND OTHERS. HNMC ALSO IS A MEMBER OF THE BERGEN COUNTY COMMUNITY HEALTH IMPROVEMENT PROGRAM (""CHIP""), WHOSE MISSION IS TO EVALUATE AND ADDRESS THE HEALTH NEEDS OF THE COUNTY.

THIS CHNA WAS COMPLETED IN 2013. THE MEDICAL CENTER ALSO CREATED A HNMC-SPECIFIC CHNA THAT ADDRESSES ITS SERVICE AREAS IN NORTHERN HUDSON COUNTY, INCORPORATES THE BERGEN COUNTY CHNA, AND PROVIDES AN IMPLEMENTATION PLAN FOR ALL AREAS.

HNMC'S SECONDARY SERVICE AREA (""SSA"") INCLUDES 17 MUNICIPALITIES IN BERGEN COUNTY AND 2 MUNICIPALITIES IN HUDSON COUNTY. TOGETHER, THE PSA AND SSA ACCOUNT FOR APPROXIMATELY 80 PERCENT OF THE MEDICAL CENTER'S ADMISSION VOLUME. AS THE SOLE CATHOLIC HOSPITAL IN AN AREA THAT IS ESTIMATED AT MORE THAN 50% ROMAN CATHOLIC, HNMC ALSO DRAWS FROM TOWNS WELL BEYOND BOTH THE PSA AND SSA. THE MAJORITY OF PSA TOWNS HAVE AN AVERAGE POPULATION OF 27,500, AND ARE LOCATED IN THE SOUTHERN HALF OF BERGEN COUNTY. OVERALL, THE SERVICE AREA IS 44% HISPANIC, ALTHOUGH THE PROPORTIONS DIFFER MARKEDLY BETWEEN BERGEN AND HUDSON: 76% OF THE RESIDENTS OF BERGEN PSA TOWNS ARE NOT HISPANIC; WHILE THE FOUR HUDSON COUNTY TOWNS TOGETHER COUNT 76% OF THEIR RESIDENTS AS HISPANIC. THE RACIAL MIX OF THE PSA IS APPROXIMATELY 60% WHITE, 22% ASIAN, 10% BLACK, AND 8% OTHER, INCLUDING MULTI-RACIAL PERSONS. CERTAIN TOWNS IN THE REGION ARE HEAVILY KOREAN; KOREAN/ASIAN PRESENCE IS MUCH LESS PRONOUNCED IN THE FOUR HUDSON COUNTY TOWNS. THE BROAD AGE MAKE-UP OF THE PRIMARY SERVICE AREA INCLUDES 23% AGED UP TO 19; 50% AGED 20-54; AND 27% AGED 55 AND OLDER. THE LAST CATEGORY IS PROJECTED TO SEE THE MOST SIGNIFICANT GROWTH DURING THE NEXT FIFTEEN YEARS. WITH THE EXCEPTION OF TWO HUDSON COUNTY TOWNS, ALL SSA ZIP CODES ARE LOCATED THROUGHOUT BERGEN COUNTY. THE TOWNS IN THIS SERVICE AREA ARE MUCH SMALLER THAN THOSE OF THE PSA, AVERAGING ONLY 14,000 RESIDENTS EACH. IN STARK CONTRAST TO THE LARGELY HISPANIC HUDSON COUNTY PSA TOWNS, THE TWO HUDSON SSA TOWNS ARE ONLY 20% HISPANIC. THE OVERALL RACIAL MIX OF THE SERVICE AREA IS 76% WHITE, 13% ASIAN, 4% BLACK, AND 7% OTHER, INCLUDING MULTI-RACIAL PERSONS. THE OVERALL KOREAN PRESENCE IS SIGNIFICANT, BUT ONLY HALF THAT SEEN IN THE PRIMARY SERVICE AREA. THE AREA'S AGE MIX IS SIMILAR TO THE PSA, WITH 23% AGED UP TO 19; 51% AGED 20-54; AND 26% AGED 55 AND OLDER. THE MEDICAL CENTER'S SERVICE AREA IS PRIMARILY SUBURBAN, WITH MANY RESIDENTS WORKING OUTSIDE BERGEN COUNTY IN PLACES SUCH AS NEW YORK CITY. HOWEVER, THERE ARE LARGE EMPLOYERS IN THE SERVICE AREA, E.G., OTHER HOSPITALS, A LARGE SPORTS CHAIN, A LARGE COMMUNICATIONS FIRM, A LARGE PHARMACEUTICAL FIRM, AND A LARGE COMMERCIAL LABORATORY. RESIDENTS OF HNMC'S SERVICE AREA ARE ALSO SERVED BY ANOTHER COMMUNITY HOSPITAL AND A TERTIARY CARE FACILITY WITH TRAUMA SERVICES. HNMC'S PSA COVERS A MAJORITY OF THE TOWNS SERVICED BY THE OTHER COMMUNITY HOSPITAL, WHEREAS THE TERTIARY CARE FACILITY'S PRIMARY SERVICE AREA ALSO INCLUDES MANY TOWNS TO THE WEST THAT ARE NOT PART OF HNMC'S SERVICE AREA. GIVEN THE NUMBER OF SERVICE AREA RESIDENTS WHO WORK IN NEARBY NEW YORK CITY, IT IS NOT SURPRISING THAT A SMALL PORTION OF THESE RESIDENTS ALSO RECEIVE THEIR HEALTH CARE IN MANHATTAN. WHILE THE SERVICE AREA IS PREDOMINANTLY NON-HISPANIC CAUCASIAN, BOTH HISPANICS (OF ANY RACE) AND ASIAN POPULATIONS (PRINCIPALLY KOREAN) ARE THE FASTING GROWING GROUPS. IN RESPONSE, THE MEDICAL CENTER HAS PROGRAMS ADDRESSING THESE GROUPS' NEEDS, AND PHYSICIANS AND NURSES FLUENT IN THE APPLICABLE LANGUAGES.

Patients qualified for our internal charity care were often identified through referrals by physicians, hospital staff, other patients and community agencies. Houston Methodist Hospital provided $28.9 million in financial assistance for internal charity care based on the IRS definition of cost.An internal charity care program provides services to the indigent at Houston Methodist Hospital and through affiliated organizations. The majority of patients who qualified for charity care were educated about the program through signs posted throughout the hospital. Other patients were referred by their physicians, hospital staff, other patients and through funded community agencies. Surplus funds are also used each year to strengthen community service outreach to support low-income and uninsured patients to help them attain access to comprehensive health care. Services provided include primary health care, emergency and routine care, immunizations, dental care, psychological and case management services, well child examinations, sick visits, health education, health screenings, well woman exams and in-kind lab services and X-rays. Houston Methodist Hospital's support allowed these organizations to enhance their services to low-income patients with diverse health needs. Methodist provided direct funding and/or in-kind services including lab tests, X-rays, immunizations, human resources consultation and other services. With Houston Methodist Hospital's support, agencies like Vecino Health Centers and Good Neighbor Healthcare Center were positioned to meet Federally Qualified Health Center designee qualifications, thereby allowing them to qualify for enhanced Medicare and Medicaid reimbursement. Programs at Houston Methodist Hospital helped improve awareness of stroke signs, risk factors and prevention through the Stride4Stroke community awareness campaign, which was in its seventh year in 2013. Programs addressed health disparities through our presence in minority communities and through outreach to women.

Houston Methodist supported the following grassroots agencies across the Greater Houston area, including those communities served by our community hospitals:-Access Health -Avondale House-Baylor College of Medicine-Bering Omega Community Services-Boys and Girls Country of Houston, Inc.-Breath of Life Children's Center, Inc.-Casa De Esperanza de los Ninos, Inc.-Chinese Community Center, Inc.-CHRISTUS Home Care-El Centro de Corazon/Eastwood Health Clinic-Eye Care for Kids Foundation-Good Neighbor Healthcare Center-Harris County Clinical Services, Inc.-Healthcare for the Homeless - Houston-HOPE Clinic-Houston Area Women's Center-Interfaith Community Clinic-Krist Samaritan Centers for Counseling and Education-Legacy Community Clinic-Matagorda Episcopal Hospital Outreach Program-Northwest Assistance Ministries-San Jose Clinic-Service Organization of Greater Houston-Shalom Mobile Health Ministry-Star of Hope-The Center, Inc.-The Center for Hearing and Speech-The Rose-The Women's Home-TOMAGWA Health Care Ministries-Vecino Health CentersThis support allowed these organizations to leverage dollars and enhance their services to low-income patients with diverse health needs. Houston Methodist provided direct funding and/or in-kind services including lab tests, X-rays, immunizations, human resources consultation and other services. With Methodist's support, agencies like Good Neighbor Healthcare Center were positioned to meet Federally Qualified Health Center designee qualifications, thereby allowing them to qualify for enhanced Medicare and Medicaid reimbursement.EducationHouston Methodist Hospital's primary academic partner is Weill Cornell Medical College in New York. The two institutions share best practices and collaborate on research, education and clinical care. More than 350 Methodist physicians have Weill Cornell faculty positions, and Houston Methodist Hospital sponsors more than 250 of its own medical residents in various specialties - ranging from neurosurgery to pathology to obstetrics/gynecology - and hosts several more from other medical institutions.In addition, Houston Methodist Hospital collaborates with many other academic and medical institutions to promote the health of the community, including New York-Presbyterian Hospital, Rice University, Baylor College of Medicine, University of Houston, Texas A&M University, Texas Children's Hospital, University of Texas Health Science Center, Texas Woman's University and Prairie View A&M, among others.Community InvolvementHouston Methodist Hospital actively develops awareness initiatives, sponsorships and programs that promote health and wellness, prevention and early detection. Houston Methodist Hospital staff and volunteers can be seen at health screenings, exercise and nutrition promotions, stress management clinics and other health promotion activities throughout the year. For example, Houston Methodist Hospital participated in the Houston Methodist's fourth annual Stride4Stroke 5K Walk/Run. The walk/run is part of the Houston Methodist's community stroke awareness campaign aimed at increasing stroke awareness and education in the community. More than 2,800 employees and community participants joined this effort to raise public awareness and funds for an event that clearly has an impact on the community.Houston Methodist Concussion Center provides comprehensive services and a dedicated team of concussion specialists to educate athletes, especially student-athletes, about the importance of concussion awareness. Through the center, student athletes have access to ImPACT (Immediate, Post Concussion Assessment and Cognitive Testing) testing, at their schools or at the Concussion Center. ImPACT is the first computerized concussion evaluation system. In addition to providing clinical care, the concussion center staff educates the community about signs and symptoms, dangers and proper medical management. The Center conducts outreach activities which benefit more than 1,000 Houston-area residents monthly.The Nantz National Alzheimer Center at Houston Methodist Hospital advances research and treatment of Alzheimer's disease, one of the biggest threats to the elderly population in our country. It is projected that as many as 16 million people will have Alzheimer's by 2050. The center, dedicated to finding a cure for Alzheimer's, addresses one of the biggest health crises affecting Americans today.Houston Methodist Hospital promotes the health of the community by fulfilling Houston Methodist's mission through exceptional, high-quality patient care, education and research, affiliations with academic and medical partners for improved community health care, charity care and community involvement.Houston Methodist Hospital also cooperates with local entities to identify community needs. Members of Houston Methodist Hospital's executive team are on the boards of local organizations like the Greater Houston Health Care Alliance that advocate for educational, environmental and health care issues that affect public policy and international companies that do business in Houston.Houston Methodist's employees have a longstanding tradition of supporting efforts to improve the health and well-being of our community. Our employees donate time, talent and money to many great community causes."

Identifying Community Health IssuesHouston Methodist Hospital identified its community health priorities for 2013 using several methods including, but not limited to, review of the Texas Institute for Health Policy Research community data, Texas Department of Public Health selected health data, community health status reports for Harris, Liberty, Fort Bend and Montgomery counties and community advisory groups committee reports for nonprofit clinics and agencies. The review indicated that chronic diseases, including heart disease and stroke, are acute in our service area, exceeding the overall mortality rates in Texas and peer counties. Because stroke was identified as a primary killer and health care issue for people in our region, Houston Methodist in 2006 created the Stride4Stroke initiative to raise awareness about stroke and to raise funds for community stroke education. A 5K Run/Walk each spring allows members of the community to participate alongside hospital employees. Houston Methodist has initiated community education efforts by training and providing nurse-educators to the community for public events, particularly in minority communities and for outreach to women. Houston Methodist also works to assist smaller hospitals in the community in developing their own stroke programs and achievement of Primary Stroke Center status, while we offer a venue for comprehensive stroke care to those patients from community hospitals that are not equipped to offer more than basic stroke care.Another initiative has sought to increase early detection and community awareness of cancer. Houston Methodist Hospital annually stages a Men's Health Expo for community awareness and education on men's health issues. Houston Methodist Hospital also sponsors and/or coordinates a number of events spotlighting women's health issues. Houston Methodist Hospital sponsored the Komen Race/Walk and Pink Ribbons campaign to promote breast cancer awareness as well as to communicate the importance of early detection of breast cancer. SummaryAs a system, Houston Methodist made significant contributions through its community benefits and charity care program which have been a resource for patients in the community.

C., Living Centers and the Homestead estimate the amount to be recognized in the consolidated financial statements for doubtful accounts by analyzing specific patient and resident accounts for collectability and also by applying historically established percentages for self-pay and various third-party payers to the aging categories in the accounts receivable aging for each facility.In 2013, the System decreased the reserve for doubtful accounts as a result of the change in its policy for recognizing financial aid for self-pay patients. Specifically, self-pay charges are now marked down at the time of billing versus a separate allowance calculation applied to gross accounts receivable.Other Explanation:Beginning in 2012 bad debts are recorded as a deduction from revenue rather than as an expense.Part III, Section A, 3Costing Methodology:HFMA P&P Board Statement 15, IX. Valuation and Disclosure of Bad Debts, 9.1 has been applied to the amount reported on line 2. The bad debt amount is recorded at the amount that the payer is expected to pay. The amount reported on line 3 is valued at patient care cost, i. e. the expected payment amount included in line 2 has been multiplied by the ratio of patient care cost to charges (40%). Based upon an analysis of income levels for accounts included in bad debts we estimated that 25% were eligible under the financial assistance program.Rationale for including a portion of bad debt amount as community benefit:It is not always possible to obtain sufficient information to make a determination of eligibility for financial assistance or reclassify bad debts as charity care.

We are developing initiatives, and designing our facilities with patient-centered, evidence-based, outcome driven goals in mind. Our team has been working to achieve the best quality care outcomes to keep patients healthy and to develop prevention-oriented programs aimed at creating and sustaining healthy communities. We base programming on areas of health and wellness that matter most in our communities. That is determined by conducting health needs assessments in our communities.Finger Lakes Health collaborates with public health departments in our service area, as well as other human services providers, to use the framework of the NYS Health Commissioner's ""Prevention Agenda"" as a basis for our community health planning. We worked together to conduct a Community Health Needs Assessment (CHNA) in 2009 and establish health priorities for 2010-2013. By drawing upon the state's prevention agenda, studying data collected through primary and secondary research, and partnering with local health departments in Ontario, Seneca and Yates counties, we identified health priorities and subsequent community outreach initiatives to align with those priorities.We again partnered with these agencies and providers to conduct another Community Health Needs Assessment in 2012-2013 and establish health priorities for 2013-2017. After the issues were ranked, we determined the two health prevention priorities that our Community Health Improvement Plans are based upon. Tools used to conduct the CHNA and get them to the largest group possible, included:- An online survey available to anyone in the community. Promoted via newspaper, email blast to employees, Constant Contact email blast to community members on your email list, in our Thrive community health magazine, circulated to 90,000 households in our service area.- Focus groups done in cooperation with our county partners targeting specific populations, including the African American Men's Society of Geneva, a Head Start parents' group, the Office for the Aging, and human service agencies, such as ARC and FLACRA.- Distribution of printed copies of the survey via waiting rooms in our facilities and to individuals without Internet access.- Survey of area healthcare providers and human services agencies via email distribution of survey and promotion at various health planning group meetings in the various counties.Once the survey process was completed, the results were tabulated by the S2AY Rural Health Network, which works with multiple counties in the Finger Lakes. Then, individuals who are part of each county - Ontario, Seneca and Yates, steering groups ranked the issues identified through data review, surveys to the public and through focus groups. The ranking was completed using the Hanlon Method.Priorities determined by the 2009 needs assessment for action in 2010-2013 were: - Access to quality health care- Chronic disease management, with emphasis on cardiovascular health- Physical activity and nutrition educationPriorities, by county, in Finger Lakes Health's service area identified for action in 2013-2017 are:Ontario County: Prevention of Hypertension/Stroke Prevention of Obesity, with a focus on childhood obesitySeneca County: Prevention of Chronic Disease Promotion of Mental Health Prevention of Substance Abuse Yates County: Obesity Prevention Hypertension PreventionDuring 2013, we addressed Access to quality health care by continuing to recruit physicians, including specialists who provide multiple access points to care across our communities.

The organization's allowance for doubtful accounts (bad debt expense) methodology and charity care policies are consistently applied. Below please find detailed information: Receivables for Patient Care ---------------------------- Patient accounts receivable for which the Hospital receives payment under cost reimbursement, prospective payment formulae or negotiated rates, which cover the majority of patient services, are stated at the estimated net amounts receivable from payors, which are generally less than the established billing rates of the Hospital. Patient accounts receivable are reported net of provisions based on management's assessment of historical and expected collections, business economic conditions, trends in healthcare coverage, and other collection indicators. For receivables associated with services provided to patients who have third-party coverage (which includes patients with deductible and co-payment balances due for which third-party coverage exists for part of the bill), the Hospital analyzes contractually due amounts and provides an allowance for doubtful accounts, if necessary. The difference between the billed rates and the amounts actually collected after all reasonable collection efforts have been exhausted is charged off against net patient service revenue. The Hospital has not changed its financial assistance policy in 2013 or 2012. Charity Care ------------ IMC's patient acceptance policy is based on its mission statement and its charitable purposes. Accordingly, IMC accepts all patients regardless of their ability to pay. A patient is classified by IMC as a charity patient by reference to certain financial criteria established by the State of New Jersey and IMC's policy. IMC's charity care policy includes additional financial criteria which were established with the intent of expanding the availability of financial assistance. Because IMC does not believe that accounts which qualify for charity care are likely to be collected, they are not reported as net patient service revenue. The unreimbursed cost for services and supplies furnished to patients eligible for such charity care are determined through the use of cost to charge ratios in effect for IMC, and are as follows: 2013 2012 In accordance with the: State of New Jersey's criteria $ 16,930,000 $ 13,402,000 IMC's additional criteria $ 19,035,000 $ 19,326,000 ------------ ------------ Total $ 35,965,000 $ 32,728,000 IMC also sponsors certain other charitable programs, which provide substantial benefit to the broader community. Such programs include services to needy and elderly populations that require special support, as well as health promotion and education for the general community welfare. In addition, all other uncollectible amounts resulting from the patients' inability to pay, are recorded."
201443219349302734,210634484,"SCHEDULE H, PART III, SECTION B; QUESTION 8","Medicare costs were derived from the 2013 Medicare cost Report. Medicare underpayments and bad debt are community benefit and associated costs are includable on the form 990, Schedule H, Part I. The organization feels that Medicare underpayments (shortfall), bad debt and associated costs are community benefit and are includable on the form 990, Schedule H, Part I. As outlined more fully below, the organization believes that these services and related costs promote the health of the community as a whole and are rendered in conjunction with the organization's charitable tax-exempt purposes and mission in providing medically necessary healthcare services to all individuals in a non-discriminatory manner without regard to race, color, creed, sex, national origin, religion or ability to pay and consistent with the Community Benefit Standard promulgated by the IRS. The Community Benefit Standard is the current standard for a hospital for recognition as a tax-exempt and charitable organization under internal revenue code (""IRC"") 501(c)(3). The organization is recognized as a tax-exempt entity and charitable organization under 501(c)(3) of the IRC. Although there is no definition in the tax code for the term ""charitable"" a regulation promulgated by the Department of the Treasury provides some guidance and states that ""the term charitable is used in Section 501(c)(3) in its generally accepted legal sense,"" and provides examples of charitable purposes, including the relief of the poor or unprivileged; the promotion of social welfare; and the advancement of education, religion, and science. Note it does not explicitly address the activities of hospitals. In the absence of explicit statutory or regulatory requirements applying the term ""charitable"" to hospitals, it has been left to the IRS to determine the criteria hospitals must meet to qualify as IRC 501(c)(3) charitable organizations. The original standard was known as the Charity Care Standard. This standard was replaced by the IRS with the Community Benefit Standard which is the current standard. Charity Care Standard In 1956, the IRS issued Revenue Ruling 56-185, which addressed the requirements hospitals needed to meet in order to qualify for IRC 501(c)(3) status. One of these requirements is known as the ""Charity Care Standard."" Under the standard, a hospital must provide, to the extent of its financial ability, free or reduced-cost care to patients who cannot pay for such services. A hospital that expected full payment did not, according to the ruling, provide charity care based on the fact that some patients ultimately failed to pay. The ruling emphasized that a low level of charity care did not necessarily mean that a hospital had failed to meet the requirement since that level could reflect its financial ability to provide such care. The ruling also noted that publicly supported community hospitals would normally qualify as charitable organizations because they serve the entire community and a low level of charity care would not affect a hospital's exempt status if it was due to the surrounding community's lack of charitable demands. Community Benefit Standard In 1969, the IRS issued revenue ruling 69-545, which ""removed"" from revenue ruling 56-185 ""the requirements relating to caring for patients without charge or at rates below cost."" Under the standard developed in revenue ruling 69-545, which is known as the ""community benefit standard,"" hospitals are judged on whether they promote the health of a broad class of individuals in the community. The ruling involved a hospital that only admitted individuals who could pay for the services (by themselves, private insurance, or public programs such as Medicare), but operated a full-time emergency room that was open to everyone. The IRS ruled that the hospital qualified as a charitable organization because it promoted the health of people in its community. The IRS reasoned that because the promotion of health was a charitable purpose according to the general law of charity, it fell within the ""generally accepted legal sense"" of the term ""charitable,"" as required by The Department of Treasury Reg. 1.501(c)(3)-1(d)(2). The IRS ruling stated that the promotion of health, like the relief of poverty and the advancement of education and religion, is one of the purposes in the general law of charity that is deemed beneficial to the community as a whole even though the class of beneficiaries eligible to receive a direct benefit from its activities does not include all members of the community, such as indigent members of the community, provided that the class is not so small that its relief is not of benefit to the community. The IRS concluded that the hospital was ""promoting the health of a class of persons that is broad enough to benefit the community"" because its emergency room was open to all and it provided care to everyone who could pay, whether directly or through third-party reimbursement. Other characteristics of the hospital that the IRS highlighted included the following: its surplus funds were used to improve patient care, expand hospital facilities, and advance medical training, education and research; it was controlled by a board of trustees that consisted of independent civic leaders; and hospital medical staff privileges were available to all qualified physicians. Medicare underpayments and bad debt are community benefit and associated costs are includable on the form 990, Schedule H, Part I. The American Hospital Association (""AHA"") feels that Medicare underpayments (shortfall) and bad debt are community benefit and thus includable on the form 990, Schedule H, Part I. This organization agrees with the AHA's position. As outlined in the AHA's letter to the IRS dated August 21, 2007 with respect to the first published draft of the new Form 990 and Schedule H, the AHA felt that the IRS should incorporate the full value of the community benefit that hospitals provide by counting Medicare underpayments (shortfall) as quantifiable community benefit for the following reasons: - Providing care for the elderly and serving Medicare patients is an essential part of the community benefit standard - Medicare, like Medicaid, does not pay the full cost of care. From the latest data provided by the American Hospital Association, as of 2012, Medicare reimburses hospitals only 86 cents for every dollar they spend to take care of Medicare patients. The Medicare Payment Advisory Commission (""MEDPAC""), in its March 2013 report to congress, states that beneficiaries will grow notably faster in the next 10 years than in the past decade as the baby-boom generation ages into the program. In addition, the population aging into the Medicare program will present a new set of challenges since rising obesity levels put this population at a greater risk than previous generations for chronic disease. - Many Medicare beneficiaries, like their Medicaid counterparts, are poor. More than 42 percent of Medicare spending is for beneficiaries whose income is below 200 percent of the federal poverty level. Many of those Medicare beneficiaries are also eligible for Medicaid -- so called ""dual eligible."" There is every compelling public policy reason to treat Medicare and Medicaid underpayments similarly for purposes of a hospital's community benefit and include these costs on form 990, Schedule H, Part I. Medicare underpayment must be shouldered by the hospital in order to continue treating the community's elderly and poor. These underpayments represent a real cost of serving the community and should count as a quantifiable community benefit. Both the AHA and this organization also feel that patient bad debt is a community benefit and thus includable on the form 990, Schedule H, Part I. Like Medicare underpayment (shortfalls), there also are compelling reasons that patient bad debt should be counted as quantifiable community benefit as follows: - A significant majority of bad debt is attributable to low-income patients, who, for many reasons, decline to complete the forms required to establish eligibility for hospitals' charity care or financial assistance programs. A 2006 congressional budget office (""CBO"") report, nonprofit hospitals and the provision of community benefits, cited two studies indicating that ""the great majority of bad debt was attributable to patients with incomes below 200% of the federal poverty line."" - The report also noted that a substantial portion of bad debt is pending charity care. Unlike bad debt in other industries, hospital bad debt is complicated by the fact that hospitals follow their mission to the community and treat every patient that comes through their emergency department, regardless of ability to pay. Patients who have outstanding bills are not turned away, unlike other industries. Bad debt is further complicated by the auditing industry's standards on reporting charity care. Many patients cannot or do not provide the necessar"

IMC conducts an extensive service area physician needs study (by primary and specialty) every three to five years. Specific specialty needs are conducted for identified gaps in service. These reviews inform medical staff development at the medical center to assure responsiveness to identified community needs. IMC collaborates with community partners to plan and conduct health needs assessments to assess and address health needs of the community it serves. The wide-based collaborative partnership retains an outside consulting firm to assess community data and perception. Community data is collected from county health profiles, health statistics, demographics, socioeconomic data, phone surveys, paper surveys and focus groups. From those assessments, community health improvement plans are published identifying the specific health priorities. Through a planned and organized effort, the group works collectively to address the priorities by tapping the resources of the community and collaborating on initiatives. IMC actively contributes to this process and engages in the identified priorities that match its mission, expertise, resources and capacity. In addition to these organized needs assessment efforts, ongoing community meetings with local providers, local health departments, local politicians, organizations and community leaders are sponsored by the hospital to discuss the health needs of the population."

201443219349302734,210634484,"SCHEDULE H, PART VI; QUESTION 4","INSPIRA MEDICAL CENTERS, INC. (""IMC"") is the only not-for-profit healthcare system located in the southwestern region of New Jersey along the Delaware Bay. It is situated in a rural and urbanized area comprised of small cities, suburbs, vast wetlands and agricultural areas. IMC is a healthcare safety net provider of general acute and ambulatory healthcare services in a regional service area that encompasses primarily Cumberland and Salem Counties and portions of Gloucester and Atlantic Counties, covering a patient base of 376,000. Cumberland County has a population of 157,745 and Salem County has a population of 66,342 according to us census 2010 estimates. The population is a multifaceted community of diverse ethnic groups and industry, predominately Caucasian with specific communities home to higher populations of Hispanic and African American residents. According to 2010 us census, Cumberland County demographics are 65% Caucasian, 20% African American, 19% Hispanic; Salem county is 85% Caucasian, 15% African American, 4% Hispanic. Cumberland County's rapidly growing Hispanic population provides much of the county's farm labor; in particular, Bridgeton experienced a 560% increase in Mexican population from 1990 to 2000. The region's economy consists of a strong agricultural base with targeted industry sectors that include healthcare, construction, hospitality/tourism, food processing, glass making, manufacturing, a nuclear generating complex, one federal penitentiary and three state correctional facilities which, combined, house over 8,000 inmates. Of 21 counties in NJ, Cumberland County has the largest percentage of residents living below the federal poverty level, the highest unemployment rate, the highest teen pregnancy rate, and the lowest percentage of population with a college degree. Major areas in Cumberland County and all of Salem County are designated medically underserved areas and health professional shortage areas. Both Salem and Cumberland County have the two highest obesity rates in the state. IMC is recognized as a center of excellence in cancer services, cardiology center of care and bariatric surgery center of excellence. Vineland and Elmer Medical Centers are state-designated primary stroke centers. IMC Behavioral Health Services is the major provider of inpatient and outpatient services for the entire southern New Jersey region spanning nine counties. Patients receiving behavioral health services are primarily insured under Medicaid and Medicare."
201443219349302734,210634484,"SCHEDULE H, PART VI; QUESTION 5","Community building activities undertaken by this organization improve the medical and socio-economic well-being of the communities in our care. This is accomplished through numerous activities which are not a part of Part I Charity Care and other community benefits, and are not included elsewhere on Schedule H. These activities include programs that address the root causes of health problems such as education, poverty, unemployment, access to care, health advocacy and economic development. Economic Development - To help address poverty and unemployment and to take an active role in the regional economy and business outlook, the hospital offers the expertise and resources of its healthcare employees as active board members and participants in community organizations such as the Bridgeton, Millville, Vineland and Salem Chambers of Commerce, Bridgeton, Elmer and Vineland Rotaries and Cumberland and Salem County Economic Forums. Community Support - IMC's efforts to enhance community support networks include both community-based and facility-based initiatives. IMPACT (Innovative Model for Preschool and Community Teaming), a collaboration between IMC and the Vineland Board of Education, provides health and social services, preschool programs and literacy programs, targeting the needs of the low income residents in Cumberland County. Impact Teen Parenting Program provides parenting classes, childcare services, prenatal care and life skills education to teen parents and second pregnancy prevention. IMPACT School Based Youth Services Program (SBYSP), offers health services, tutoring, counseling, recreation and life skills training. The IMPACT Family Outreach Program, through three Family Worker Coordinators, provide training, supervision and support to roughly 40 Family Workers in the Abbott Preschools in Vineland, Millville and Bridgeton. Family Workers serve as the liaison between the child care center, the home and community agencies. The IMPACT Child Care Program provides childcare for infants and toddlers. Inspira's Family Success Centers are a program offered by IMPACT in Commercial Township and Vineland. They are designed to enrich the lives of children by strengthening families and neighborhoods, providing integrated, locally-based services, reducing isolation and promote connections among family and community and providing services in a warm and welcoming environment. IMC plans for disaster readiness above and beyond licensure requirements, including a decontamination room, a dedicated decon team and coordination of mass casualty drills involving different disaster scenarios in the community in collaboration with all first responders to address the major security concern related to the significant prison inmate population of 8,000 during disasterS. Environmental Improvements - The organization's Going Green Recycling initiative at all facilities system-wide improves the environment and helps the community by reducing waste, increasing recycling, conserving materials and purchasing recycled products. Inspira participates in the State of NJ Safe Syringe Disposal program, a community sharps disposal program that provides community residents with a method to safely dispose of home generated sharps. IMC maintains a campus-wide smoking ban at all IMC buildings, grounds and parking lots to improve the air quality, health and well-being of everyone in the surrounding communities. Coalition Building - IMC actively partners in community coalitions aimed at addressing health and safety issues. To address Cumberland County's teen pregnancy rate, which is 3 times the NJ state average, the Teen Pregnancy Prevention Initiative was formed through a collaborative partnership with IMC, CompleteCare Health Network (CCHN) and the county freeholders. SAFE (Sexual Accountability For Everyone), is the educational component of CCHN's plan to bring nurse practitioners into county middle and high schools and expand school-based services to include comprehensive health and gynecological services, peer & adult self-esteem programs, encourage responsible sexual behavior and provide tier-based counseling to target at-risk students. To address the particularly high childhood obesity rate, STEPS for kids was initiated as a collaboration between IMC, The Cumberland Cape Atlantic YMCA and the Robert Wood Johnson Foundation targeting children 8 to 12 with a BMI level at or above the 85th percentile who are at risk for obesity. The 12-week interactive program for children and their parents focuses on balanced meal plans and simple exercise techniques that help families achieve healthier lifestyles. To improve health risks associated with heart disease in our growing population of African American and Latino residents, IMC was one of 10 hospitals in NJ chosen by the Robert Wood Johnson Foundation to participate in a two-year, statewide initiative to improve the quality of cardiac care, share and apply best practices for treating patients with heart failure and communicate strategies and lessons learned to policymakers and healthcare providers. IMC initiated an Extended Care Facilities Forum to build a positive relationship between the hospital, neighboring nursing care facilities and the community to assist each other in offering a seamless continuum of care in light of healthcare reform changes. IMC partnered with the Salem Health and Wellness Foundation to provide digital mammography to the uninsured and health underserved residents of Salem County, who would not otherwise utilize this preventive screening tool until their breast cancer was at a later stage. Community Health Improvement Advocacy - Various levels of IMC staff serve on government advisory committees and boards for national, state and local organizations to advocate for healthcare reform, bring about changes in regulatory requirements, advocate for improved access to healthcare and promote health status for both the broader community and vulnerable populations. IMC is represented at organizations such as the Advocates for Children of NJ, American Hospital Association, Cumberland Inter-Agency Council, Human Services Advisory Council, National Association for Home Care & Hospice, NJ Association of Mental Health Agencies, NJ Division of Mental Health Services, NJ Hospital Association, Salem Inter-Agency Council, Southern NJ Perinatal Cooperative and Voluntary Hospitals of America. Workforce Development - IMC is committed to recruiting experienced physicians and health professionals into our community, which is identified as a medically underserved area (MUA), to ensure that residents have access to the specialized care they need. Responding to a shortage of obstetricians, IMC recruited additional ob/gyns into a medically underserved area. New physician specialties added include urogynecology, oncologic urology, gynecologic oncology and oncologic breast surgery. To promote student exploration of healthcare careers in an area with a traditionally high jobless rate, IMC provides events promoting careers in healthcare and collaborates on healthcare career programs with Medical Explorers and Pinelands Learning Center. IMC developed an Employer Forum for employers throughout Cumberland County to address and discuss medical issues, employee health, safety and wellness of the workforce population."

Premium receivables are carried at original billed amount less an estimate for doubtful receivables based on a review of all outstanding amounts on a monthly basis. Premium receivables are considered past due to the extent that there is no related unearned premium. Additions to the allowance for doubtful accounts are made by means of the provision for doubtful accounts. Accounts written off as uncollectible are deducted from the allowance and subsequent recoveries are added. The Foundation has determined, based on an assessment at the consolidated entity level, that patient service revenue is primarily recorded prior to assessing the patient's ability to pay and as such, the entire provision for doubtful accounts related to patient revenue is recorded as a deduction from patient service revenue in the accompanying consolidated statements of operations. The amount of the provision for doubtful accounts, $21,049,000 and $26,821,000 for 2013 and 2012, respectively, is based upon management's assessment of the historical and expected net collections. METHODOLOGY FOR BAD DEBT RELATED TO CHARITY CARE According to Aultman Hospital's Financial Assistance Policy (FAP), all medically necessary self-pay patients are eligible for financial assistance.(1) Eligibility criteria is based on the Federal Poverty guidelines and are updated annually based on the updates published by the United States Department of Health and Human Services. The FAP discount is based on income and family size. Self-pay balances will receive a minimum of 30% discount and up to 100% as long as the necessary Financial Assistance Application is complete. Patients must cooperate with the facility to provide the information and documentation necessary to determine eligibility. To determine the amount of bad debt expense that potentially could have been attributable to patients eligible under the organizations charity care policy the organization looked at all bad debt balances that were self-pay. From this population the organization identified those self-pay balances that did not receive any form of FAP or HCAP discount. Because all self-pay patients receive at least a minimum of 30% regardless of income, the assumption was made that if the account had no discount the proper paper work was not turned in to determine eligibility criteria. From this remaining population the estimated discount at cost that would have been provided if documentation had been received was calculated by applying the actual FAP distribution of patients who received discounts in 2013 and then multiplying this amount by the cost to charge ratio calculated in worksheet 2. (1) To be considered for financial assistance, the patient must cooperate with the facility to provide the information and documentation necessary to apply for other existing financial resources that may be available to pay for his or her heath care, such as Medicaid.

Between 2011 and 2013, Aultman collaborated with area hospitals and health care facilities to conduct a community health survey. The goal was to gauge the health status and health habits of Stark County residents - and identify areas where Aultman can improve the health of our community. Fifteen questions were included on the poll of 1,067 Stark County households.

The cancer program and the American Cancer Society encouraged local women to learn about breast health at the Think Pink event, which included education on breast health and cancer prevention; a Q&A session with physicians and nurses; and information on breast exams and free mammograms at the Aultman Breast Care Center. The cancer team also held its inaugural Cancer Survivors' Day celebration to honor survivors and encourage newly diagnosed patients, an event that included a butterfly release and custom-made artwork. Safety First More than 400 Aultman Health Foundation volunteers shared the message of bicycle safety with about 4,700 local first-grade students. In addition to in-class safety education, each student received a bike safety activity book and a bike helmet. Harvest for Hunger Aultman Health Foundation team members collected a total of 13,153 pounds of food and gave $47,068.20 in support of the 2013 Harvest for Hunger campaign. The donations provided more than 199,000 meals for individuals struggling with hunger in our community. Careers in Health Care Summer Learning Program Aultman Medical Education hosted the sixth annual Careers in Health Care Program, designed for students 18 and older with interests in health care careers. In conjunction with the symposium, the Aultman Diversity and Inclusion Department held a Minority Medical Career Symposium and Career Fair for local high school students. Make a Difference Day Aultman Health Foundation team members converged on Don Scott Field Oct. 26 to distribute health information and bags of fresh apples to Canton Youth Football players, cheerleaders and families. The volunteers distributed 250 bags throughout the event. Walking to Raise Funds and Stay Healthy Aultman Health Foundation team members and their loved ones support annual fundraising walks for organizations including the American Cancer Society, American Heart Association, March of Dimes and Juvenile Diabetes Research Foundation. Aultman created a ""Just Walk"" video, which doubled as a 30-second public service announcement that played in Cinemark movie theaters, to encourage community members to walk for good health. Aultman Ambassador Program Aultman and local colleges/universities are partnering to make a measurable impact in the health of local communities. Aultman and Malone University teamed up with Louisville High School in 2013, with a goal to reduce overweight/obesity by 5 percent in a class of students in four years. The ambassador program expanded to a second school, Canton South High School, with collaboration from the Aultman College of Nursing and Health Sciences. The goal of the Aultman Ambassador program is to create an effective model for improved health that other communities can replicate. Community wellness councils drive the initiative with participation from partners, students, parents, teachers/administrators and community organizations. Senior Day at the Hall of Fame Dozens of Aultman departments participated in the 2013 Senior Day at the Pro Football Hall of Fame, offering free screenings and health education. Additional Community Benefit In addition to providing care for patients with no insurance, Aultman also serves thousands of patients covered by programs such as Medicaid. Payments from these federally funded programs do not always cover the total cost of service. Through its resident teaching programs, Aultman delivers a significant level of quality outpatient and inpatient health care to insured, underinsured and uninsured individuals in our market. For members of the Amish community, Aultman offers transportation to and from doctors' appointments and Aultman Hospital. An Amish House is also located adjacent to the Aultman campus, giving visitors a place to stay when loved ones are hospitalized."

PAYORS INCLUDE FEDERAL AND STATE AGENCIES, INCLUDING MEDICARE AND MEDICAID, MANAGED CARE HEALTH PLANS, COMMERCIAL INSURANCE COMPANIES, AND PATIENTS. THESE THIRD-PARTY PAYORS PROVIDE PAYMENTS TO THE HOSPITAL AT AMOUNTS DIFFERENT FROM ITS ESTABLISHED RATES BASED ON NEGOTIATED REIMBURSEMENT AGREEMENTS. PAYMENT ARRANGEMENTS INCLUDE PROSPECTIVELY DETERMINED RATES PER DISCHARGE, REIMBURSED COSTS, DISCOUNTED CHARGES, AND FEE SCHEDULE PAYMENTS. RETROACTIVE ADJUSTMENTS UNDER REIMBURSEMENT AGREEMENTS WITH THIRD-PARTY PAYORS ARE ACCRUED ON AN ESTIMATED BASIS IN THE PERIOD THE RELATED SERVICES ARE RENDERED AND ADJUSTED IN FUTURE PERIODS AS FINAL SETTLEMENTS ARE DETERMINED. ALLOWANCES FOR DOUBTFUL ACCOUNTS - ACCOUNTS RECEIVABLE ARE REDUCED BY AN ALLOWANCE FOR DOUBTFUL ACCOUNTS BASED ON THE HOSPITAL'S EVALUATION OF ITS MAJOR PAYOR SOURCES OF REVENUE, THE AGING OF ACCOUNTS, HISTORICAL LOSSES, CURRENT ECONOMIC CONDITIONS, AND OTHER FACTORS UNIQUE TO THE SERVICE AREA AND THE HEALTHCARE INDUSTRY. MANAGEMENT REGULARLY REVIEWS DATA ABOUT THE MAJOR PAYOR SOURCES OF REVENUE IN EVALUATING THE SUFFICIENCY OF THE ALLOWANCE FOR DOUBTFUL ACCOUNTS. FOR RECEIVABLES ASSOCIATED WITH SERVICES PROVIDED TO PATIENTS WHO HAVE THIRD-PARTY PAYOR COVERAGE, THE HOSPITAL ANALYZES CONTRACTUALLY DUE AMOUNTS AND PROVIDES AN ALLOWANCE FOR DOUBTFUL ACCOUNTS AND A PROVISION FOR BAD DEBTS, IF NECESSARY (FOR EXAMPLE, EXPECTED UNCOLLECTIBLE DEDUCTIBLES AND COPAYMENTS ON ACCOUNTS FOR WHICH THE THIRD-PARTY PAYOR HAS NOT YET PAID, OR FOR PAYORS WHO ARE KNOWN TO BE HAVING FINANCIAL DIFFICULTY THAT MAKE THE REALIZATION OF AMOUNTS DUE UNLIKELY). FOR RECEIVABLES ASSOCIATED WITH SELF-PAY PAYMENTS, WHICH INCLUDES BOTH PATIENTS WITHOUT INSURANCE AND PATIENTS WITH DEDUCTIBLE AND COPAYMENT BALANCES DUE FOR WHICH THIRD-PARTY COVERAGE EXISTS FOR PART OF THE BILL, THE HOSPITAL RECORDS A SIGNIFICANT PROVISION FOR BAD DEBTS IN THE PERIOD OF SERVICE ON THE BASIS OF ITS PAST EXPERIENCE, WHICH INDICATES THAT MANY PATIENTS ARE UNABLE OR UNWILLING TO PAY THE PORTION OF THEIR BILL FOR WHICH THEY ARE FINANCIALLY RESPONSIBLE. THE DIFFERENCE BETWEEN THE STANDARD RATES (OR THE DISCOUNTED RATES IF NEGOTIATED) AND THE AMOUNTS ACTUALLY COLLECTED AFTER ALL REASONABLE COLLECTION EFFORTS HAVE BEEN EXHAUSTED IS CHARGED OFF AGAINST THE ALLOWANCE FOR DOUBTFUL ACCOUNTS. THE HOSPITAL'S CURRENT ALLOWANCE FOR DOUBTFUL ACCOUNTS POLICY IS TO RESERVE 85 PERCENT OF SELF-PAY ACCOUNTS LESS THAN 150 DAYS, 100 PERCENT OF SELF-PAY ACCOUNTS 150 AND OLDER, AND 100 PERCENT OF ALL OTHER PAYOR ACCOUNTS 150 DAYS AND OLDER, NET OF CONTRACTUAL ALLOWANCES ALREADY TAKEN. THE ALLOWANCE FOR DOUBTFUL ACCOUNTS BALANCE WAS COMPRISED OF A $8,554,563 RESERVE FOR SELF-PAY BALANCES AND A $2,288,019 RESERVE FOR THIRD-PARTY PAYOR BALANCES."

RESEARCH HAS CONTINUALLY SHOWN THAT WHEN THE FACTORS INFLUENCING HEALTH ARE EXPLORED, HEALTH CARE ACTUALLY PLAYS THE SMALLEST ROLE PROPORTIONATELY. A REPORT IN THE JOURNAL OF AMERICAN MEDICAL ASSOCIATION AND THE CENTER FOR DISEASE CONTROL (MCGINNIS, 1996) SUGGESTS THAT THE FACTORS IMPACTING HEALTH ARE AS FOLLOWS: LIFESTYLE AND BEHAVIORS, 50%, ENVIRONMENT (HUMAN AND NATURAL), 20%, GENETICS AND HUMAN BIOLOGY, 20%, AND HEALTH CARE, 10%. COMMUNITY BUILDING ACTIVITIES HELP TO ADDRESS THE OTHER INDICATORS OUTSIDE OF THE ROLE TRADITIONALLY PLAYED BY HEALTH-CARE ORGANIZATIONS. THESE ACTIVITIES ARE ALMOST EXCLUSIVELY DONE IN SOME FORM OF PARTNERSHIP IN WHICH THE COMMUNITY OR OTHER ORGANIZATIONS ARE BETTER SUITED TO ADDRESS. HEALTH-CARE ORGANIZATIONS GENERALLY PROVIDE TIMELY AND SPECIFIC RESOURCES TO HELP THESE ISSUES. HEALTH-CARE ORGANIZATIONS CAN BE A RICH AND VALUABLE COMMUNITY RESOURCE IN WAYS NOT TYPICALLY CONSIDERED. OFTEN THE MOST EFFECTIVE WAY TO HELP IMPACT AND IMPROVE THE COMMUNITY HEALTH STATUS IS TO SUPPORT OTHER AGENCIES AND ORGANIZATIONS IN A VARIETY OF WAYS OUTSIDE OF HEALTH SERVICES. THIS IS OFTEN DONE THROUGH CASH OR IN-KIND SERVICES TO SUPPORT OTHER NON-PROFITS, DONATIONS OF DURABLE MEDICAL EQUIPMENT AND SUPPLIES TO CERTAIN AGENCIES, OR THROUGH LEADERSHIP AND EDUCATIONAL EXPERTISE. THE HOSPITAL CONTRIBUTES FINANCIALLY TO A WIDE VARIETY OF COMMUNITY ORGANIZATIONS THAT ADDRESS THE BROADER NEEDS OF THE COMMUNITY. THESE DONATIONS ALLOW OTHER NON-PROFIT ORGANIZATIONS TO FULFILL THEIR MISSIONS TO IMPROVE THE WELL BEING OF THE COMMUNITY AND CONTRIBUTE TO ITS OVERALL HEALTH STATUS IN WAYS THAT MAY DIFFER FROM THE DIRECT SERVICES OF THE HOSPITAL ORGANIZATION AND MAXIMIZE THE RESOURCES THEY HAVE TO WORK WITH. THE HOSPITAL EMPLOYEES ARE ACTIVE IN EDUCATING PARTNERS ON A WIDE VARIETY OF HEALTH SUBJECTS THAT ADVANCE THEIR WORK. FURTHER, THE HOSPITAL EMPLOYEES ARE MEMBERS OF MANY NON-PROFIT BOARDS TO PROVIDE LEADERSHIP OR COLLABORATE TO ADDRESS COMPLEX HEALTH ISSUES.THESE TYPES OF ACTIVITIES SPEAK TO THE BREADTH AND CAPACITY THAT THE HOSPITAL HAS IN IMPACTING THE HEALTH STATUS OF THE COMMUNITY IN A COMPREHENSIVE AND INTENTIONAL APPROACH."

THE MEDICARE SHORTFALL REFLECTED ON SCHEDULE H, PART III, SECTION B WAS DETERMINED USING INFORMATION FROM THE ORGANIZATION'S MEDICARE COST REPORT. HOWEVER THE MEDICARE COST REPORT DISALLOWS CERTAIN ITEMS THAT WE BELIEVE ARE LEGITIMATE EXPENSES INCURRED IN THE PROCESS OF CARING FOR OUR MEDICARE PATIENTS. EXAMPLES OF THESE ITEMS INCLUDE PROVIDER BASED PHYSICIAN EXPENSE, SELF INSURANCE EXPENSE, HOME OFFICE EXPENSE AND THE SHORTFALL FROM FEE SCHEDULE PAYMENTS. THE ORGANIZATIONS COST ACCOUNTING SYSTEM CALCULATES A MEDICARE SHORTFALL OF $13,791,862. IN ADDITION TO THESE ITEMS THE MEDICARE COST REPORT AND THE COST ACCOUNTING SYSTEM DO NOT INCLUDE MEDICARE PHYSICIAN FEE SCHEDULE EXPENSE OF $14,334,908 AND REVENUE OF $7,388,816. AFTER TAKING THESE ITEMS INTO ACCOUNT WE CALCULATE AN ACTUAL MEDICARE SHORTFALL OF $20,737,954.THE HOSPITAL BELIEVES THE ENTIRE AMOUNT OF THE MEDICARE SHORTFALL SHOULD BE TREATED AS COMMUNITY BENEFIT, MORE SPECIFICALLY, AS CHARITY CARE. THE ELDERLY CONSTITUTE A CLEARLY-RECOGNIZED CHARITABLE CLASS, AND MANY MEDICARE BENEFICIARIES, LIKE THEIR MEDICAID COUNTERPARTS, ARE POOR AND THUS WOULD HAVE QUALIFIED FOR THE HOSPITAL'S CHARITY CARE PROGRAM, MEDICAID OR OTHER NEEDS-BASED GOVERNMENT PROGRAMS ABSENT THE MEDICARE PROGRAM. BY ACCEPTING PAYMENT BELOW COST TO TREAT THESE INDIVIDUALS, THE BURDENS OF GOVERNMENT ARE RELIEVED WITH RESPECT TO THESE INDIVIDUALS.

201433179349301333,160743905,"Schedule H, Part II","Arnot Health, in collaboration with partners from HP2and SHPT, developed broad based plans to address chronic disease as a public health priority, focusing on reducing obesity and tobacco use. Community Health Improvement Plans CHIP from both counties place emphasis on three key areas 1 health promotion activities to encourage healthy living and limit the onset of chronic diseases 2 early detection opportunities that include screening populations at risk and 3 successful management strategies for existing diseases and related complications. These strategies, recommended by the Health Impact Pyramid, are based on the interventions evidenced base potential to address health inequities, the ability to measure success and potential reach, potential for broad partner support and collaboration, and political feasibility. This method is based on findings from such organizations as the Institute of Medicine of the National Academies and their report, Accelerating Progress in Obesity Prevention, Solving the Weight of the Nation or the CDCs, Recommended Community Strategies and Measurements to Prevent Obesity in the United States. For each focus area under the selected Prevention Agenda, Prevent Chronic Disease priority, Chemung and Steuben County Partnerships identified objectives and goals that include improvement strategies and performance measures with measurable and time framed targets over the next five years. The proposed chronic disease prevention strategies are evidence based or promising practices. They include activities currently underway by partners and new strategies to be implemented. All proposed strategies in Chemung and Steuben Counties are supported by the HP2 and SHPT partnerships. Chronic disease prevention strategies will be implemented in multiple sectors, including at local schools, worksites, businesses, community organizations, and with providers, to make it easier for residents to make healthy choices. By planning and implementing strategies from many levels of the Health Impact Pyramid, and through our network of diverse partnerships, we can create an environment that is conducive to physical activity, good nutrition and tobacco cessation. The Chemung and Steuben County partnerships have included many suggested activities from the States Prevent Chronic Disease Plan that will encourage increased physical activity, better nutrition and tobacco cessation strategies that aim toward reducing and preventing the incidence of chronic disease in Chemung and Steuben Counties. Some of these interventions include environmental, policy and systems changes to create communities that support physical activity, improved nutrition and breastfeeding, and tobacco cessation. Chemung County will continue its work through the Creating Healthy Places to Live, Work and Play grant and improve parks and playgrounds, establish community gardens to improve access to fresh fruits and vegetables, and work with local restaurant partners to make eating out healthier. Steuben County will continue to work with the cross county Southern Tier Tobacco Awareness Community Partnership, STTAC to establish tobacco free policies and urge members of the Regional Economic Development Council to consider health in their projects. Both counties plan to pursue joint use agreements with local school districts. Promote breast feeding policies at worksites, and create resource guides that promote the counties many opportunities for physical activity and healthy foods, including local farmers markets, parks and hiking trails. Other strategies include the clinical and community solutions such as provider 51 referrals to Diabetes Prevention Programs, Chronic Disease Self Management Programs and Tobacco Cessation Education. One exciting aspect of the CHIP is the unlimited possibilities offered by technological advances. Arnot Health and other local providers are beginning to implement Electronic Health Records, EHR. When fully functional, the benefits of EHRs will include improved quality and convenience of patient care, accuracy of diagnoses, enhanced care coordination, increased patient participation in their care, improved health outcomes and increased practice efficiencies and cost savings. EHRs will give providers decision support tools and available resources to better prevent and manage chronic disease. Arnot Health is currently working towards consolidating existing technologies within the healthcare system, with the objective of getting everyone on the same system organization wide. Consolidating technology within the healthcare system will improve communication among care providers, and between patients with their providers, enhance patient care coordination, improve chronic disease management and health outcomes. Arnot Health is increasing its focus on population health management and working towards increasing the systems abilities and competencies related to population health management. Areas of focus include realigning our health care delivery system to be more patient and ambulatory centric; increasing patient engagement with primary care providers using PCMH as a model; improving care coordination; and improving the management of chronic disease. Successful consolidation of IT systems will, contribute towards the integration and interoperability of data, and data exchange among care providers. Create robust and functional analytics which can identify higher risk patients to better manage chronic disease and improve health outcomes. Equip providers with the competencies needed to manage health care in a more predictive and less reactive way. Reduce preventable utilization of higher cost health care services such as emergency room or inpatient settings. Chemung and Steuben Counties Community Health Improvement Plans propose training primary care providers to talk to their patients about their weight, physical activity, diet and tobacco use and offering professional training opportunities which include programs on prevention, screening, diagnosis and treatment of overweight, obesity and diabetes. Residents and medical students will benefit from this training through the healthcare systems graduate medical education program. Arnot Healths graduate medical education program is offered in partnership with Lake Erie College of Osteopathic Medicine, LECOM. Another CHIP strategy is to investigate the possibility of incorporating referrals to community resources to prevent or manage chronic disease through a link in EHR. Through the use of new technology, follow up calls can be made to check on patient compliance, and provide the opportunity to document and measure the effectiveness of healthcare interventions. 52 Arnot Healths service area includes two Medically Underserved Areas, MUA. Elmiras Census Tract 0007.00 in Chemung County and Troupsburg and Tuscarora Town Service Area in Steuben County. Poor access to care is associated with a higher incidence of chronic disease, poorly managed chronic disease and an increased incidence of preventable hospitalizations. In both counties, the ratio of residents to primary care providers exceeds the NYS average. Arnot Health, through its Arnot Medical Services provider practice group, continues to aggressively recruit providers for the counties most underserved areas, and expand its graduate medical program to help meet identified needs within the MUAs. As Arnot Health works in partnership with Chemung Countys HP2 and Steuben Counties SHPT to implement the CHIPs, we will continue to identify emerging best practices to reduce obesity and tobacco use. Data measures will be developed to assess the effectiveness of our plans in impacting the communitys health, and set mid-course corrections where needed. Promising cases for return on investment will be shared with policymakers. The specifics of Chemung and Steuben Counties Community Health Improvement Plans are outlined in the following CHIP charts. Strategies, goals, objectives, improvement strategies, performance measures with measurable time-framed targets over a three year period are included in the CHIP charts."

THE TRI-COUNTY AREA INCLUDES THE CONTIGUOUS COUNTIES OF WAYNE, OAKLAND AND MACOMB, WHICH ARE LOCATED IN SOUTHEASTERN MICHIGAN AND ACCOUNT FOR 39% OF THE MICHIGAN POPULATION. WAYNE, OAKLAND, AND MACOMB (IN THAT ORDER) ARE THE MOST POPULATED COUNTIES IN MICHIGAN. OF THE NEARLY 4 MILLION RESIDENTS, APPROXIMATELY 52% OF THE POPULATION IS FEMALE. WITH REGARD TO RACE/ETHNICITY, THE TRI-COUNTY AREA IS 65% WHITE, COMPARED TO A NATIONAL AVERAGE OF 62%. OF NOTE, THE TRI-COUNTY AREA IS 25% BLACK, WHICH IS OVER TWICE THE NATIONAL PERCENTAGE OF 12%. CONVERSELY, THE HISPANIC POPULATION (4.0%) IS LESS THAN ONE QUARTER OF THE NATIONAL PERCENTAGE OF 17%. THE NUMBER OF TRI-COUNTY RESIDENTS IS EXPECTED TO DECREASE BY 1% OVER THE NEXT SEVERAL YEARS,WHICH CONTRASTS WITH THE 3% INCREASE EXPECTED NATIONWIDE. IN ADDITION, FEMALES OF CHILD BEARING AGE (15-44), WHO MAKE UP 19% OF THE TRI-COUNTY'S POPULATION, ARE EXPECTED TO DECLINE BY 4% OVER THE NEXT SEVERAL YEARS. WHEN EXAMINING AGE DISTRIBUTION, THE TRI-COUNTY HAS A COMPARABLE POPULATION TO THAT OF THE COUNTRY AND 14% OF THE POPULATION IS ABOVE THE AGE OF 65. OF PARTICULAR INTEREST TO HEALTHCARE PROVIDERS IS THE AGING POPULATION OF THE TRI-COUNTY AREA WITH THE 55 YEARS OLD AND ABOVE POPULATION EXPECTED TO RISE BY 9% FROM 2013 TO 2018. WITH REGARDS TO EDUCATION, THE TRI-COUNTY HAS APPROXIMATELY 12% OF RESIDENTS WHO HAVE SOME HIGH SCHOOL EDUCATION OR LESS COMPARED TO THE NATIONAL AVERAGE OF 15%. FURTHER, 28% OF RESIDENTS HAVE A BACHELOR'S DEGREE OR GREATER, WHICH IS COMPARABLE TO THE NATIONAL AVERAGE.THE TRI-COUNTY AREA IS DIVERSE IN REGARDS TO POPULATION, RACIAL/ETHNIC COMPOSITION, ECONOMIC GROWTH AND DEVELOPMENT. THE AUTOMOTIVE INDUSTRY REMAINS THE LARGEST EMPLOYER IN THE REGION, BUT THE HEALTH CARE SECTOR IS ALSO REPRESENTED AMONG THE TOP EMPLOYERS IN THE REGION AS WELL (CRAIN'S DETROIT 2012 LISTINGS OF MAJOR EMPLOYERS). THE AVERAGE HOUSEHOLD INCOME WITHIN THE TRI-COUNTY AREA ($63,344) IS LESS THAN THE NATIONAL AVERAGE ($69,637). WITHIN THE TRI-COUNTY AREA, THE AVERAGE HOUSEHOLD INCOME IN OAKLAND COUNTY ($80,157) IS SIGNIFICANTLY HIGHER THAN WAYNE COUNTY ($53,355) AND MACOMB COUNTY ($58,589). AT THE ZIP CODE LEVEL, AVERAGE HOUSEHOLD INCOMES VARY SIGNIFICANTLY,RANGING FROM $25,145 TO $163,374. LOWER HOUSEHOLD INCOMES NEGATIVELY IMPACT PURCHASING POWER, HEALTH INSURANCE COVERAGE, AND COSTS OF BASIC NECESSITIES. AS A RESULT, THE TRI-COUNTY AREA'S SAFETY NETS, INCLUDING HEALTHCARE SYSTEMS, ARE BEING STRETCHED TO THE LIMIT (UNITED WAY RESEARCH INCOME DOWN ACROSS STATE: POVERTY INCREASING AND SPREADING THROUGHOUT THE TRICOUNTY 2006, HTTP://WWW.UWSEM.ORG).

OF THE ZIP CODES THAT RANK IN THE TOP 20 ZIP CODES FOR BOTH LOWEST AVERAGE HOUSEHOLD INCOME AND HIGHEST PROPORTION OF THE POPULATION WITHOUT A HIGH SCHOOL DIPLOMA IN THE TRI-COUNTY AREA, THE AVERAGE HOUSEHOLD INCOME IS $41,724, WHICH IS SIGNIFICANTLY LESS THAN THE AVERAGE HOUSEHOLD INCOME OF $63,344 FOR THE OVERALL TRI-COUNTY AREA.

FOR 2013, FOR ANSHN, THE ALLOWANCE FOR DOUBTFUL ACCOUNTS COVERED 24.1% OF NET PATIENT ACCOUNTS RECEIVABLE. PATIENT ACCOUNTS RECEIVABLE ARE STATED AT NET REALIZABLE VALUE. ANSHN EVALUATES THE COLLECTABILITY OF ITS ACCOUNTS RECEIVABLE BASED ON THE LENGTH OF TIME THE RECEIVABLE IS OUTSTANDING, PAYER CLASS, HISTORICAL COLLECTION EXPERIENCE, AND TRENDS IN HEALTH CARE INSURANCE PROGRAMS. ACCOUNTS RECEIVABLE ARE CHARGED TO THE ALLOWANCE FOR UNCOLLECTIBLE ACCOUNTS WHEN THEY ARE DEEMED UNCOLLECTIBLE. THE COSTING METHODOLOGY USED IN DETERMINING THE AMOUNTS REPORTED ON LINES 2 AND 3 IS BASED ON THE RATIO OF PATIENT CARE COST TO CHARGES. THE UNREIMBURSED COST OF BAD DEBT WAS CALCULATED BY APPLYING THE ORGANIZATION'S COST TO CHARGE RATIO FROM THE MEDICARE COST REPORTS (CMS 2252-96 WORKSHEET C, PART 1, PPS INPATIENT RATIOS) TO THE ORGANIZATION'S BAD DEBT PROVISION PER GENERALLY ACCEPTED ACCOUNTING PRINCIPLES, LESS ANY PATIENT OR THIRD PARTY PAYOR PAYMENTS RECEIVED. ADVOCATE MAKES EVERY EFFORT TO IDENTIFY THOSE PATIENTS WHO ARE ELIGIBLE FOR FINANCIAL ASSISTANCE BY STRICTLY ADHERING TO ITS FINANCIAL ASSISTANCE POLICY. WE BELIEVE THAT ADVOCATE HAS A POPULATION OF PATIENTS WHO ARE UNINSURED OR UNDERINSURED BUT WHO DO NOT COMPLETE THE FINANCIAL ASSISTANCE APPLICATION. THE ESTIMATED AMOUNT OF BAD DEBT EXPENSE (AT COST) WHICH COULD BE REASONABLY ATTRIBUTABLE TO PATIENTS WHO WOULD LIKELY QUALIFY FOR FINANCIAL ASSISTANCE UNDER THE ORGANIZATION'S FINANCIAL ASSISTANCE POLICY, IF SUFFICIENT INFORMATION HAD BEEN AVAILABLE TO MAKE A DETERMINATION OF THEIR ELIGIBILITY, WAS BASED UPON SELF PAY PATIENT ACCOUNTS WHICH HAD AMOUNTS WRITTEN OFF TO BAD DEBTS. OUR METHOD WAS TO BEGIN WITH THE SELF-PAY PORTION OF BAD DEBT EXPENSE PROVISION. THE SELF PAY PORTION EXCLUDES THOSE PATIENTS WHO HAD CHARITY APPLICATIONS PENDING AT THE TIME OF SERVICE. THIS COST WAS THEN REDUCED BY CHARGES IDENTIFIED AS TRUE BAD DEBT EXPENSE, INCLUDING COPAYS FOR PATIENTS WHO QUALIFIED FOR LESS THAN 100% FINANCIAL ASSISTANCE. THE COST TO CHARGE RATIO WAS THEN APPLIED TO THE REMAINING CHARGES, TO DETERMINE THE VALUE (AT COST) OF PATIENT ACCOUNTS THAT DID NOT COMPLETE FINANCIAL COUNSELING AND WERE ASSIGNED TO BAD DEBT. WE BELIEVE THIS PROCESS IS A REASONABLE BASIS FOR OUR ESTIMATE. AS WE ARE ONLY CONSIDERING SELF-PAY ACCOUNTS WRITTEN OFF TO BAD DEBT FOR THIS ESTIMATE, THIS ESTIMATE DOES NOT INCLUDE THE IMMEDIATE 25% DISCOUNT TO CHARGES WHICH IS APPLIED TO ALL SELF-PAY PATIENTS. IT ALSO DOES NOT INCLUDE ACCOUNT BALANCES OR CO-PAYS OF NON-SELF PAY ACCOUNTS WHICH ARE WRITTEN OFF TO BAD DEBT WHEN THE PATIENT HAS NO OTHER FINANCIAL RESOURCES TO PAY THESE AMOUNTS AND THE PATIENT DOES NOT APPLY FOR FINANCIAL ASSISTANCE.

MANY OF THESE PATIENTS HAVE SERIOUS PSYCHIATRIC CONDITIONS SUCH AS SCHIZOPHRENIA AND BIPOLAR DISORDERS THAT ARE DIFFICULT TO TREAT, ARE ASSOCIATED WITH HIGH RATES OF NONCOMPLIANCE PARTIALLY DUE TO THE SIDE EFFECTS OF MEDICATIONS, AND RESULT IN CONTINUING EPISODES OF SUICIDAL AND PSYCHOTIC BEHAVIORS AND ONGOING USE OF THE EMERGENCY DEPARTMENT FOR TREATMENT. THE GOAL OF THIS PROJECT IS TO REDUCE THE LOW RATE OF ENGAGEMENT BETWEEN THE EMERGENCY DEPARTMENT AND INPATIENT EXPERIENCES AND REFERRAL TO ONGOING OUTPATIENT SERVICES. IN 2013, A QUALITY IMPROVEMENT PROJECT SHOWED THAT IMMEDIATE, FOLLOW-UP APPOINTMENTS FROM THE INPATIENT PSYCHIATRIC UNIT WERE KEPT ON AVERAGE ONLY 40% OF THE TIME. THE IMPLEMENTATION OF A NEW PROGRAM-FIRST ACCESS-TO EXPAND OPEN ACCESS TO SAME DAY FOLLOW-UP OUTPATIENT APPOINTMENTS, INCREASED THE KEPT APPOINTMENT RATE TO 100%. WITH FIRST ACCESS, PATIENTS FROM THE INPATIENT SERVICE ARE WALKED OVER TO OUTPATIENT CARE BY A STAFF MEMBER TO ENSURE A WARM HANDOFF. PATIENTS RECEIVE AN INITIAL ASSESSMENT, EVALUATION, SERVICE PLAN AND FOLLOW UP APPOINTMENTS FOR INDIVIDUAL AND GROUP THERAPY, AND WHERE NEEDED, PSYCHIATRIC SERVICES. IN FACT, SOME PATIENTS PARTICIPATE IN SUBSTANCE ABUSE GROUP TREATMENT THAT SAME DAY. THE PROGRAM GOAL IS TO ENCOURAGE SUCCESS BY PROVIDING IMMEDIATE ACCESS, STRONG ENGAGEMENT, INCREASED CONSUMER SATISFACTION AND CLOSE FOLLOW UP FOR RELAPSE PREVENTION. THE PROPOSED NEXT PHASES FOR FIRST ACCESS WILL INCLUDE: - EXPANDING THE AVAILABILITY OF FIRST ACCESS APPOINTMENTS-CURRENTLY RESTRICTED TO 10 AM - 2 P.M.; - EXPANDING OUTREACH SERVICES TO THOSE EMERGENCY DEPARTMENT AND INPATIENTS WHO WERE REFERRED BUT DID NOT FOLLOW THROUGH WITH THEIR FIRST ACCESS OR SUBSEQUENT APPOINTMENTS; AND - INCORPORATING PSYCHIATRIC COVERAGE AND POTENTIALLY TELE-PSYCHIATRY INTO THE FIRST ACCESS MODEL.

ADVOCATE HEALTH CARE'S BOARD OF DIRECTORS, SENIOR LEADERSHIP AND ASSOCIATES (EMPLOYEES) ARE COMMITTED TO POSITIVELY AFFECTING THE HEALTH STATUS AND QUALITY OF LIFE OF INDIVIDUALS AND POPULATIONS IN COMMUNITIES SERVED BY ADVOCATE THROUGH PROGRAMS AND PRACTICES THAT REFLECT ADVOCATE'S WHOLISTIC PHILOSOPHY. TO THAT END, THEY CONTINUE TO UNDERTAKE AND SUPPORT INITIATIVES THAT ENHANCE ACCESS TO HEALTH AND WELLNESS SERVICES WITHIN THE DIVERSE COMMUNITIES THAT ADVOCATE SERVES. SYSTEM LEADERSHIP IS BOTH DESIGNED TO DIRECT AND SUPPORT THE HOSPITALS IN THEIR EFFORTS TO ADDRESS IDENTIFIED COMMUNITY NEEDS. IN 2010, A MULTI-DISCIPLINARY TEAM OF INDIVIDUALS AT THE SYSTEM LEVEL HAVING OVERSIGHT RESPONSIBILITY FOR COMMUNITY BENEFITS REPORTING AND THE CHNA PROCESS WAS CONVENED TO LEAD THE HOSPITALS THROUGH THE CHNA PROCESS TO MEET STATE AND FEDERAL REGULATORY REQUIREMENTS. THIS TEAM, CALLED THE COMMUNITY HEALTH STEERING COMMITTEE, MET FREQUENTLY TO ASSURE THAT: THE HOSPITAL COMMUNITY HEALTH LEADERS ARE EDUCATED REGARDING HOW TO CONDUCT A CHNA; SITE COMMUNITY HEALTH COUNCILS ARE DEVELOPED AND MAINTAINED; THOSE CONDUCTING THE CHNA PROCESS PULL DATA FROM RELIABLE SOURCES; SOUND ASSUMPTIONS ARE MADE BASED ON THAT DATA; INTERNAL ADVOCATE AND COMMUNITY RESOURCES ARE MAPPED TO DETERMINE STRENGTHS AND WEAKNESSES; ACHIEVABLE NEEDS ARE SELECTED AS PRIORITIES; AND PLANNED INITIATIVES ARE GROUNDED IN EVIDENCE-BASED PROGRAMS THAT WILL YIELD RELIABLE OUTCOMES TO DETERMINE IMPACT. TO FOCUS THESE EFFORTS THROUGHOUT ADVOCATE HEALTH CARE, THE COMMUNITY BENEFITS PLAN WAS WRITTEN. THE PLAN'S BROAD GOALS AND OBJECTIVES WERE DESIGNED TO STRUCTURE SYSTEM-WIDE COMMUNITY BENEFITS ACTIVITIES WITHIN A STRATEGIC FRAMEWORK. INCLUDED IN THE COMMUNITY BENEFITS PLAN ARE NOT ONLY PLANNED GOALS AND OBJECTIVES FOCUSED ON ADDRESSING NEEDS AS IDENTIFIED THROUGH THE HOSPITAL COMMUNITY HEALTH NEEDS ASSESSMENT PROCESS, BUT ALSO OTHER SYSTEM-WIDE COMMUNITY BENEFITS/COMMUNITY HEALTH PROGRAMS SUCH AS CHARITY CARE. ADVOCATE'S COMMUNITY BENEFITS PLAN WAS DEVELOPED TO ESTABLISH STRATEGIES FOR IMPROVING ACCESS TO CARE AND POSITIVELY AFFECTING THE HEALTH OF THE COMMUNITIES THAT ADVOCATE SERVES. THE PLAN SETS THE COURSE FOR STRENGTHENING EXISTING PARTNERSHIPS AND BUILDING NEW ONES WITH INDIVIDUALS AND ORGANIZATIONS WITHIN ADVOCATE'S SERVICE AREAS IN ORDER TO LEVERAGE AND MAXIMIZE THE IMPACT OF ITS PROGRAMS. ADVOCATE'S COMMUNITY BENEFITS PLAN GOALS ARE AS FOLLOWS. GOAL 1: OPTIMIZE ADVOCATE'S ABILITY TO LEVERAGE ITS COMMUNITY HEALTH RESOURCES AND CONTINUE PROGRAMS THAT BENEFIT THE COMMUNITY BY PROSPECTIVELY ALIGNING SYSTEM AND SITE PLANS AND ACTIVITIES. IN ORDER TO ASSURE ALIGNMENT BETWEEN SITE AND SYSTEM GOALS, QUALITY AND CONSISTENCY AMONGST THE HOSPITALS' CHNAS AND TO LEVERAGE THE HOSPITALS' STAFF TIME AND CHNA EFFORTS, THE SYSTEM LEVEL COMMUNITY HEALTH STEERING COMMITTEE PROVIDED A STANDARDIZED CHNA PROCESS, TOOLS, EDUCATION AND STRUCTURE. SPECIFIC EXAMPLES OF THE SUPPORT PROVIDED BY THE STEERING COMMITTEE TO ENABLE THE HOSPITALS TO REALIZE THEIR COMMUNITY HEALTH GOALS AND OBJECTIVES ARE AS FOLLOWS. - A STANDARDIZED CHNA PROCESS THAT INCLUDED DEVELOPMENT OF A COMMUNITY HEALTH COUNCIL AT EACH HOSPITAL WITH BOTH HOSPITAL AND COMMUNITY REPRESENTATION. THE COUNCILS WERE CHARGED WITH MANAGING THEIR SITE'S ASSESSMENT, EXAMINING DATA, SITE AND COMMUNITY RESOURCES, SELECTING KEY PRIORITIES TO ADDRESS AND DEVELOPING A COMMUNITY HEALTH PLAN. - PURCHASE OF AND INSTRUCTION ON HOW TO USE SURVEY RESULTS AND THE ASSESSMENT TOOL DEVELOPED BY PROFESSIONAL RESEARCH CONSULTANTS. - LED A SERIES OF WORKSHOPS OVER THREE YEARS WITH INTERNAL AND EXTERNAL SPEAKERS PROFICIENT IN CHNAS, IDENTIFYING RELIABLE DATA SOURCES, PRIORITY SETTING, AND SELECTING EVIDENCE-BASED INTERVENTIONS. - SET THE COMMUNITY HEALTH LEADERSHIP COUNCIL'S AGENDAS, A COUNCIL COMPRISED OF COMMUNITY HEALTH STAKEHOLDERS FROM ACROSS ADVOCATE, TO FOCUS ON CHNA OBJECTIVES. - MANAGED HOSPITAL PROGRESS AGAINST SYSTEM ANNUAL TIMELINES TO ACHIEVE THE THREE-YEAR VISION, REQUIRING ANNUAL CHNA PROGRESS REPORTS AND THEIR REVIEW AND ENDORSEMENT BY THE HOSPITAL GOVERNING COUNCILS EACH YEAR. - PROVIDED ONGOING CONSULTATION ON AN AS NEED BASIS THROUGHOUT THE PROCESS. - ENGAGED AND FUNDED AN OUTSIDE CHNA CONSULTANT TO MEET ONE-ON-ONE WITH THE SITE COMMUNITY HEALTH LEADERS AND REVIEW CHNA PROGRESS AND PROVIDE GUIDANCE IN AREAS OF DIFFICULTY OR UNCERTAINTY. - PROVIDED AN OVERVIEW OF THE CHNA RESULTS AND PLANNED INTERVENTIONS TO THE MISSION & SPIRITUAL COMMITTEE OF THE ADVOCATE HEALTH CARE BOARD OF DIRECTORS TO SECURE THE COMMITTEE'S ENDORSEMENT. - A STANDARDIZED FORMAT FOR HOSPITALS TO USE IN DRAFTING THEIR CHNAS AND IMPLEMENTATION PLANS, WHICH SYSTEM LEADERS THEN REVIEWED AND EDITED FOR CONSISTENCY, ACCURACY AND QUALITY OF CONTENT. - WORKED WITH SYSTEM LEVEL MEDIA CENTER AND WEB TEAM TO DEVELOP PLACEMENT AND POSTING OF CHNA REPORTS & IMPLEMENTATION PLANS TO MEET PPACA/IRS REGULATORY REPORTING REQUIREMENTS. - IN PREPARATION FOR THE NEXT CHNA CYCLE, PURCHASED THE HEALTHY COMMUNITIES INSTITUTE'S CHNA TOOL IN LATE 2013 TO SUPPORT THE SITES IN CONDUCTING THEIR NEXT CHNA WHILE AT THE SAME TIME MONITORING OUTCOMES OF PLANNED INTERVENTIONS IMPLEMENTED AS A RESULT OF ADVOCATE'S FIRST (2011-2013) CHNA. THROUGH ADVOCATE'S HOSPITAL-BASED SERVICES, AS WELL AS ITS PARTICIPATION IN PROVIDING PROGRAMS AND SERVICES IN THE COMMUNITY, ADVOCATE PROMOTES A SHARED APPROACH TO COMMUNITY BENEFITS. IN ADDITION TO HOSPITAL/COMMUNITY SPECIFIC PROGRAMS, THERE ARE ALSO PROGRAMS ADDRESSING NEEDS OF BROAD GEOGRAPHIC PORTIONS OF ADVOCATE'S SERVICE AREA WHICH ARE MANAGED AND FUNDED AT THE SYSTEM LEVEL. THESE PROGRAMS INCLUDE THE FOLLOWING. IN 2013, ADVOCATE HEALTHY STEPS SPECIALISTS TOUCHED THE LIVES OF 6,688 YOUNG CHILDREN THROUGH CHILDHOOD PROGRAMS WITHIN PEDIATRIC/FAMILY PRACTICE RESIDENCIES AT ADVOCATE ILLINOIS MASONIC MEDICAL CENTER, AND ADVOCATE CHILDREN'S HOSPITAL OAK LAWN AND PARK RIDGE CAMPUSES. THIS SYSTEM-WIDE PROGRAM USES A NATIONAL MODEL TO ENGAGE PARENTS AS PARTNERS WITH PHYSICIANS IN THEIR CHILDREN'S HEALTH. HEALTHY STEPS SPECIALISTS HELP BRIDGE THE TWO GROUPS BY PREPARING PARENTS TO TAKE AN ACTIVE ROLE IN, AND PHYSICIANS TO ASSESS AND MEET MORE EFFECTIVELY, A RANGE OF CHILD DEVELOPMENT NEEDS. IN 2013, 9,749 DEVELOPMENTAL SCREENINGS WERE PROVIDED AND 445 FAMILIES WERE REFERRED TO COMMUNITY SERVICES FOR FOLLOW UP. IN ADDITION, HEALTHY STEPS HAS COMPLETED AN INITIATIVE, IN COLLABORATION WITH THE ILLINOIS CHAPTER OF THE AMERICAN ACADEMY OF PEDIATRICS, TO TRAIN PRIMARY CARE PROVIDERS ACROSS THE STATE TO IMPROVE PREVENTIVE PRACTICES IN THEIR SITE AROUND TOPICS SUCH AS USE OF VALIDATED TOOLS FOR DEVELOPMENTAL AND FAMILY RISK FACTOR SCREENINGS (SUCH AS POSTPARTUM DEPRESSION, DOMESTIC VIOLENCE, TRAUMA, AND PSYCHOSOCIAL ISSUES) AND TEACH PRIMARY CARE PROVIDERS AND THEIR STAFF HOW TO REFER TO LOCAL COMMUNITY RESOURCES FOR FOLLOW-UP CARE. DURING 2013, ADVOCATE HEALTHY STEPS CONSULTANTS PROVIDED 179 PRESENTATIONS IN 57 PRIMARY CARE SITES, TO 740 PHYSICIANS AND THEIR STAFFS THROUGHOUT THE STATE OF ILLINOIS. THESE PROVIDERS CARE FOR APPROXIMATELY 154,835 CHILDREN BETWEEN BIRTH AND AGE THREE. CURRENTLY, HEALTHY STEPS IS FOCUSING ON DEVELOPMENTAL BEHAVIORAL MENTAL HEALTH TRAINING FOR PRIMARY CARE PROVIDERS. THE STAFF ALSO MEETS REGULARLY WITH APPROXIMATELY 20 COMMUNITY ORGANIZATIONS, AND WORK WITH PEDIATRIC AND FAMILY MEDICINE RESIDENCY PROGRAMS, PEDIATRIC NURSE PRACTITIONERS AND PHYSICIAN ASSISTANT PROGRAMS THROUGHOUT THE STATE. THE ADVOCATE CHILDHOOD TRAUMA TREATMENT PROGRAM (CTTP), A SYSTEM LEVEL, SYSTEM-WIDE INITIATIVE, OFFERS HOPE AND HEALING TO CHILDREN WHO HAVE EXPERIENCED MALTREATMENT, PSYCHOLOGICAL TRAUMA AND SEXUAL ABUSE. CLINICIANS WORK WITH A CHILD'S ENTIRE SUPPORT NETWORK - PARENTS, THE SCHOOL AND MORE - TO HELP FOSTER A SAFE ENVIRONMENT FOR THE CHILD. CTTP IS ONE OF JUST A HANDFUL OF PROGRAMS IN THE STATE THAT SPECIALIZES IN MENTAL HEALTH FOR CHILDREN. IN 2013, CTTP SERVED 171 CHILDREN AND ADOLESCENTS, AS WELL AS 420 ADULTS, CAREGIVERS, PARENTS AND OTHERS. IN ADDITION, THE PROGRAM HAS PARTNERED WITH ""DARKNESS TO LIGHT,"" A NATIONALLY RECOGNIZED CHILD SEXUAL ABUSE PREVENTION LEADER. AS A RESULT OF THIS PARTNERSHIP, THE CTTP HAS LAUNCHED A MAJOR ADULT EDUCATION PROGRAM CALLED ""STEWARDS OF CHILDREN/7 STEPS TO PROTECT A CHILD."" THIS PROGRAM HAS EDUCATED OVER 1,400 ADULTS AT SCHOOLS, CHURCHES, LAW ENFORCEMENT AGENCIES, CHILD WELFARE AGENCIES AND CIVIC ORGANIZATIONS, THEREBY BETTER PROTECTING 14,000 CHILDREN.

The Needs Assessment is posted on our website: http://www.rsfh.com/About_Us/Mission_and_Community_Activities/Needs_Assessment.aspx and we invite the community to review and respond to this document so that our collaborative efforts can make living in our community more enjoyable and healthier.As allowed by IRS guidelines, Roper St. Francis Healthcare decided to produce a joint CHNA report in collaboration with its three Charleston area hospitals as those facilities define their communities to be the same. Each hospital files a Schedule H and has a customized implementation plan attached.The community needs assessment process consists of 5 steps: data assessment, community input, prioritization and implementation strategy, reporting, and monitoring. In the data assessment step, service areas were defined, external data research was completed and key findings were summarized. Interviews were conducted with persons with special knowledge of public health, hospital personnel, local organizations, and community outreach advocates. Our service area for this assessment is defined as the Tri-County area of Charleston, Berkeley, and Dorchester Counties. We used the following sources in the data assessment process: Nielson Claritas, 2012 County Health Rankings, Health Indicators Warehouse, The Advisory Board Company, Kids Count Data Center, Truven Health Analytics, and the USDA. Data from these sources was used to identify at-risk populations, underserved populations, health need areas, and professional shortage areas. See the answer to Schedule H, Part VI, question 4 for a description of the community served.Subsequent to the data assessment step, the Community Needs Assessment Team entered into dialogue with key hospital administrators, physicians, those with knowledge/expertise in public health, and those serving underserved and chronic disease populations. During the community input phase, the team conducted face-to-face interviews, phone interviews, and surveys in which respondents were able to comment and discuss general community health issues of their specific service area. Through these numerous interviews and surveys, a summary of community input was created. This summary would eventually be used to help focus in on priorities and ultimately, implementation strategies. Respondents who participated in this phase included experts in the field of public health, hospital administration members, community outreach groups, and other local organizations. Respondents included Dana Millet, Director of DHEC Lowcountry Region, Joseph Chambers, MD; Public Health expert and consultant, Thaddeus Bell, MD; with Closing the Gap in Healthcare. Other respondents were from focus groups in the Charleston Promise Neighborhood (North Charleston), East Cooper Community Outreach (Mt. Pleasant), Neighborhood House (Charleston), and Our Lady of Mercy Outreach Center (Johns Island). Collection and analysis of results from the CHNA data assessment, survey, interviews, and focus groups provided a strong foundation for identifying health needs and service gaps. In June 2013, Roper St. Francis Healthcare held multiple sessions with leading stakeholders to assess initial findings and establish priorities. These various constituents included representatives from the Medical University of South Carolinas strategic planning team, leadership of Trident United Way's Health Council and 2-1-1 program, experts from Joseph P. Riley Jr. Center for Livable Communities at the College of Charleston, and public health consultants. Twelve priority areas of need emerged for the Tri-County service area. As part of the prioritization process, Roper St. Francis Healthcare conducted an inventory of existing system-based outreach programs, community partnerships, and other collaborative resources that currently address each of the priority areas:1)Access to Services for Uninsured and Underinsured: Access Health Tri-county Network; RSF Financial Assistance Policy and Patient Financial Services staff to assist; partnerships with Free Clinics such as Barrier Island Free Medical Clinic, Our Lady of Mercy Outreach and Crisis Ministries; new RSF Mt.

This implementation plan (attached) will be rolled out over the next 3 years. Strategies are be clearly defined with a matrix of which areas each RSFH hospital will address. Some strategies may be addressed by more than one RSFH hospital or the system as a whole. The team will develop a monitoring method to provide status and results of these efforts to improve community health. RSFH is committed to conducting another health needs assessment in three years.The Community Health Needs Assessment for fiscal December 31, 2013 was approved by the Board of Directors at its meeting held on October 12, 2013."

Requests for financial assistance may be proposed by sources other than the patient, such as the patient's physician, family members, social service organizations, community or religious groups, or hospital personnel. Statements to patients from the Hospital outline our charity care policy and our charity care policy is posted on our website. If patients indicate they are not able to pay their bill, we will provide the patient with a charity care application.Patients can also meet with a member or our financial counseling department to learn about their financial assistance options. Brochures are printed in English and Spanish telling patients to contact the financial counseling department. The Hospital wants its patients' focus to be on health and recovery and not financial worry. There is absolutely no additional cost for our financial counseling assistance.Additionally, patients can meet with staff of the Medicaid program. The program staff will meet with patients individually to help them apply for publicly supported programs such as Medicaid, Medicare, and disability. Counselors meet with patients in the hospital as well as making home visits as appropriate. The staff can also help identify resources to help pay for medication.

THE HOSPITALS HAVE IMPLEMENTED A MONTHLY STANDARDIZED APPROACH TO ESTIMATE AND REVIEW THE COLLECTIBILITY OF RECEIVABLES BASED ON THE PAYER CLASSIFICATION AND THE PERIOD THE RECEIVABLES HAVE BEEN OUTSTANDING. PAST DUE BALANCES OVER 90 DAYS FROM THE DATE OF BILLING AND OVER A SPECIFIED AMOUNT ARE CONSIDERED DELINQUENT AND ARE REVIEWED INDIVIDUALLY FOR COLLECTABILITY. ACCOUNT BALANCES ARE WRITTEN OFF AGAINST THE ALLOWANCE WHEN MANAGEMENT FEELS IT IS PROBABLE THE RECEIVABLES WILL NOT BE RECOVERED. HISTORICAL COLLECTION AND PAYER REIMBURSEMENT EXPERIENCE IS AN INTEGRAL PART OF THE ESTIMATION PROCESS RELATED TO RESERVES FOR DOUBTFUL ACCOUNTS. IN ADDITION, THE HOSPITALS ASSESS THE CURRENT STATE OF ITS BILLING FUNCTIONS IN ORDER TO IDENTIFY ANY KNOWN COLLECTION OR REIMBURSEMENT ISSUES IN ORDER TO ASSESS THE IMPACT, IF ANY, ON RESERVE ESTIMATES, WHICH INVOLVES JUDGMENT. THE HOSPITALS BELIEVE THAT THE COLLECTABILITY OF ITS RECEIVABLES IS DIRECTLY LINKED TO THE QUALITY OF ITS BILLING PROCESSES, MOST NOTABLY THOSE RELATED TO OBTAINING THE CORRECT INFORMATION IN ORDER TO BILL EFFECTIVELY FOR THE SERVICES PROVIDED. REVISIONS IN RESERVE FOR DOUBTFUL ACCOUNTS ESTIMATES ARE RECORDED AS AN ADJUSTMENT TO PROVISION FOR BAD DEBTS. A SUMMARY OF THE PAYMENT ARRANGEMENTS WITH MAJOR THIRD-PARTY PAYERS FOLLOWS: 1) MEDICARE PAYMENTS. INPATIENT ACUTE CARE SERVICES AND OUTPATIENT SERVICES RENDERED TO MEDICARE PROGRAM BENEFICIARIES ARE PAID AT PROSPECTIVELY DETERMINED RATES. THESE RATES VARY ACCORDING TO A PATIENT CLASSIFICATION SYSTEM THAT IS BASED ON CLINICAL, DIAGNOSTIC, AND OTHER FACTORS. EFFECTIVE OCTOBER 1, 2007, THE CENTERS FOR MEDICARE AND MEDICAID SERVICES (CMS) REVISED THE MEDICARE PATIENT CLASSIFICATION SYSTEM. THE NEW MEDICARE SEVERITY ADJUSTED DIAGNOSIS RELATED GROUPS (MS-DRGS) REFLECT CHANGES IN TECHNOLOGY AND CURRENT METHODS OF CARE DELIVERY. CMS HAS EXPANDED THE NUMBER OF DRGS FROM 538 TO 989 AND REQUIRES IDENTIFICATION OF CONDITIONS THAT ARE PRESENT UPON ADMISSION. 2) NON-MEDICARE PAYMENTS. THE NEW YORK HEALTH CARE REFORM ACT OF 1996, AS UPDATED, GOVERNS PAYMENTS TO HOSPITALS IN NEW YORK STATE UNDER THIS SYSTEM, HOSPITALS AND ALL NON-MEDICARE PAYERS (EXCEPT MEDICAID, WORKERS' COMPENSATION AND NO-FAULT INSURANCE PROGRAMS) BY NEGOTIATING THE HOSPITAL'S PAYMENT RATES. IF NEGOTIATED RATES ARE NOT ESTABLISHED, PAYERS ARE BILLED AT HOSPITALS ESTABLISHED CHARGES. MEDICAID, WORKER'S COMPENSATION AND NO-FAULT PAYERS PAY HOSPITAL RATES PROMULGATED BY THE NEW YORK STATE DEPARTMENT OF HEALTH (""DOH"") ON A PROSPECTIVE BASIS. ADJUSTMENTS TO CURRENT AND PRIOR YEARS' RATES FOR THESE PAYERS WILL CONTINUE TO BE MADE IN THE FUTURE. EFFECTIVE JANUARY 1, 2008 THE DOH UPDATED THE DATA UTILIZED TO CALCULATE THE NYS DRG SERVICE INTENSITY WEIGHTS (""SIWS"") IN ORDER TO UTILIZE MORE CURRENT DATA IN DOH PROMULGATED RATES. SIMILAR TYPE OUTPATIENT REFORMS WERE IMPLEMENTED EFFECTIVE DECEMBER 1, 2008. THERE ARE ALSO VARIOUS OTHER PROPOSALS AT THE FEDERAL AND STATE LEVEL THAT COULD, AMONG OTHER THINGS, REDUCE PAYMENT RATES. THE ULTIMATE OUTCOME OF THESE PROPOSALS, REGULATORY CHANGES AND OTHER MARKET CONDITIONS CANNOT PRESENTLY BE DETERMINED. LAWS AND REGULATIONS GOVERNING THE MEDICARE AND MEDICAID PROGRAMS ARE EXTREMELY COMPLEX AND SUBJECT TO INTERPRETATION. AS A RESULT, THERE IS AT LEAST A REASONABLE POSSIBILITY THAT RECORDED ESTIMATES WILL CHANGE BY A MATERIAL AMOUNT IN THE NEAR TERM. THE HOSPITALS HAVE ESTABLISHED ESTIMATES, BASED ON INFORMATION PRESENTLY AVAILABLE, OF AMOUNT DUE TO OR FROM MEDICARE AND NON-MEDICARE PAYERS FOR ADJUSTMENTS TO CURRENT AND PRIOR YEARS' PAYMENT RATES, BASED ON INDUSTRY-WIDE AND HOSPITAL-SPECIFIC DATA. THE HOSPITALS' MEDICARE COST REPORTS HAVE BEEN AUDITED AND FINALIZED BY THE MEDICARE FISCAL INTERMEDIARY THROUGH DECEMBER 31, 2009. ON FEBRUARY 19, 2004, THE SECRETARY OF HEALTH AND HUMAN SERVICES CONFIRMED THAT HOSPITALS CAN PROVIDE DISCOUNTS FOR UNINSURED PATIENTS, WHICH ALLOWED THE HOSPITALS TO IMPLEMENT A DISCOUNT POLICY IN ACCORDANCE WITH STATE LAW. THE HOSPITALS' GOAL WAS TO CREATE A FINANCIAL AID PROGRAM THAT IS CONSISTENT WITH THE MISSION, VALUES AND CAPACITY OF THE HOSPITALS, WHILE CONSIDERING AN INDIVIDUAL'S ABILITY TO CONTRIBUTE TO HIS OR HER CARE. THE HOSPITALS HAVE A DISCOUNT POLICY AND PROVIDES DISCOUNTS TO UNINSURED PATIENTS. UNDER THIS POLICY, THE DISCOUNT OFFERED TO UNINSURED PATIENTS IS REFLECTED AS A REDUCTION TO THE NET PATIENT SERVICE REVENUE AT THE TIME THE UNINSURED BILLINGS ARE RECORDED. NET PATIENT SERVICE REVENUE IS REPORTED AT THE ESTIMATED NET REALIZABLE AMOUNTS FROM PATIENTS, THIRD-PARTY PAYORS AND OTHER SERVICES RENDERED AND INCLUDES ESTIMATED RETROACTIVE REVENUE ADJUSTMENTS DUE TO FUTURE AUDITS, REVIEWS AND INVESTIGATIONS. FEDERAL AND STATE REGULATIONS PROVIDE FOR CERTAIN RETROSPECTIVE ADJUSTMENTS TO CURRENT AND PRIOR YEARS' PAYMENT RATES BASED ON INDUSTRY-WIDE AND HOSPITAL-SPECIFIC DATA. THE HOSPITALS HAVE ESTIMATED THE POTENTIAL IMPACT OF SUCH RETROSPECTIVE ADJUSTMENTS BASED ON INFORMATION PRESENTLY AVAILABLE AND ADJUSTMENTS ARE RENDERED AND ARE ADJUSTED IN FUTURE PERIODS AS ADDITIONAL INFORMATION BECOMES AVAILABLE OR FINAL SETTLEMENTS ARE DETERMINED. AS A RESULT OF SUCH PRIOR YEAR ADJUSTMENT THE 2013 AND 2012 NET PATIENT SERVICE REVENUE INCREASED BY APPROXIMATELY $3,800,000 AND $2,300,000, RESPECTIVELY. AS DISCUSSED ABOVE, THE CURRENT MEDICAID AND MEDICARE PROGRAMS ARE BASED UPON COMPLEX LAWS AND REGULATIONS. NONCOMPLIANCE WITH SUCH LAWS AND REGULATIONS COULD RESULT IN FINES, PENALTIES, AND EXCLUSION FROM SUCH PROGRAMS. THE HOSPITAL IS NOT AWARE OF ANY ALLEGATIONS OF NONCOMPLIANCE THAT COULD HAVE A MATERIAL ADVERSE EFFECT ON THE FINANCIAL STATEMENTS AND BELIEVES THAT IT IS IN COMPLIANCE WITH ALL APPLICABLE LAWS AND REGULATIONS. FOR THE YEARS ENDED DECEMBER 31, 2013 AND 2012, NET INPATIENT REVENUE FOR INDIVIDUAL PAYORS CONSISTED OF THE FOLLOWING: MEDICARE 2013-37% 2012-37%, MEDICAID 2013- 35%, 2012-38%, SELF PAY 2013-2%, 2012-1%, COMMERCIAL, MANAGED CARE AND OTHER 2013-26%, 2012-24%.LINE 2 COSTING METHODOLOGY - THE RATIO OF PATIENT COST TO CHARGE APPLIED TO THE BAD DEBT EXPENSES WAS UTILIZED. THE HOSPITALS ARE LOCATED IN AN IMPOVERISHED AREA IN SOUTHWEST YONKERS, NEW YORK WHICH CONTAINS A LARGE NUMBER OF UNINSURED AND MEDICAID ELIGIBLE PATIENTS. MANY OF THESE PATIENTS ARE INDIGENT AND/OR ILLEGAL IMMIGRANTS WHO ARE UNWILLING TO COOPERATE WITH THE HOSPITALS IN APPLYING FOR GOVERNMENT INSURANCE. AS A RESULT, UNCOLLECTIBLE AMOUNTS ARE RECORDED AS BAD DEBT EVEN THOUGH THESE PATIENTS TYPICALLY DO NOT HAVE THE ABILITY TO PAY DUE TO THEIR SOCIOECONOMIC STATUS."

THE HOSPITAL ALSO SERVES THE SECONDARY SERVICE AREA WHICH INCLUDES DEKALB, MCHENRY, WHITESIDE, LEE, LASALLE, STEPHENSON AND ROCK COUNTIES FOR SELECT TERTIARY SERVICES. LOCATED IN NORTHERN ILLINOIS, THE PRIMARY SERVICE AREA IS CHARACTERIZED AS LARGELY RURAL AND POPULATED WITH VERY SMALL COMMUNITIES WITH THE EXCEPTION OF THE NEIGHBORING CITIES OF ROCKFORD, LOVES PARK, AND MACHESNEY PARK WHICH COMPRISE NEARLY 198,000 INDIVIDUALS. THE NEXT LARGEST COMMUNITY IS BELVIDERE, LOCATED IN BOONE COUNTY, WHERE THE ENTIRE COUNTY HAS A POPULATION OF APPROXIMATELY 54,000 INDIVIDUALS. IN CALENDAR YEAR 2012, APPROXIMATELY 85% OF HOSPITAL INPATIENTS WERE FROM THE PRIMARY SERVICE AREA. AS A COMMUNITY THAT RELIES HEAVILY ON MANUFACTURING COMPANIES AND SMALL BUSINESSES, THE AREA HAS BEEN PARTICULARLY HARD HIT IN RECENT ECONOMIC TIMES. CURRENTLY THE LARGEST EMPLOYERS INCLUDE CHRYSLER (BOONE COUNTY), THE ROCKFORD SCHOOL DISTRICT, AND THE THREE ROCKFORD HEALTH CARE PROVIDERS. THE MOST RECENT MEDIAN HOUSEHOLD INCOME FIGURES (U.S. CENSUS BUREAU) IN WINNEBAGO COUNTY WERE $47,600 COMPARED TO THE STATE'S MEDIAN HOUSEHOLD INCOME OF APPROXIMATELY $56,600. THESE DISPARITIES ARE ALSO REFLECTED IN UNEMPLOYMENT, EDUCATION AND POVERTY RATES. UNEMPLOYMENT RATES REMAIN HIGH AT 10.2% IN ROCKFORD IN APRIL 2014 COMPARED TO STATE FIGURES AT 7.5%. ONLY 21% OF WINNEBAGO COUNTY RESIDENTS ATTAIN A BACHELOR'S DEGREE OR HIGHER, WHILE IN THE STATE 31% DO. 17% OF RESIDENTS LIVING IN WINNEBAGO COUNTY ARE BELOW THE POVERTY LINE COMPARED TO OVERALL STATE LEVELS OF SLIGHTLY MORE THAN 13%. CHILDREN IN THE COMMUNITY HAVE BEEN PARTICULARLY HARD HIT WITH CLOSE TO 28% CONSIDERED AT OR BELOW POVERTY LEVELS. (WINNEBAGO COUNTY HEARTLAND ALLIANCE 2011) ALL OF THESE CONDITIONS HAVE RESULTED IN INCREASING PRESSURES ON THE COMMUNITY. ROCKFORD MEMORIAL HOSPITAL IS LOCATED IN THE OLDER, WESTERN PORTION OF THE COMMUNITY AND SERVES A SIGNIFICANT INDIGENT AND ELDERLY POPULATION. THIS IS EVIDENT WHEN LOOKING AT INCOME LEVELS FOR HOUSEHOLDS LOCATED IN ZIP CODES IN WESTERN ROCKFORD WHERE THE HOSPITAL RESIDES. FOR EXAMPLE, THE U.S. CENSUS BUREAU 2008-2012 AMERICAN COMMUNITY SURVEY 5-YEAR ESTIMATES FOR INDIVIDUAL ZIP CODES LISTS MEDIAN HOUSEHOLD INCOME FOR WEST SIDE ZIP CODES AS FOLLOWS: 61103 $35,960; 61102 $31,701; 61101 - $29,909. THE GEOGRAPHIC DISPARITIES ARE EVIDENT WHEN THESE NUMBERS ARE COMPARED TO HOUSEHOLDS LOCATED IN THE EASTERN PORTION OF ROCKFORD.

IT MAY BE BECAUSE THEY CANNOT HEAR OR SPEAK ANOTHER LANGUAGE. SINCE 2011, VIDEO INTERPRETATION IS AVAILABLE FOR THE DEAF AND HARD OF HEARING, AS WELL AS SPANISH-SPEAKING PATIENTS. LAPTOP COMPUTERS WITH VIDEO CAMERAS, IN ROCKFORD MEMORIAL HOSPITAL AND ACROSS ROCKFORD HEALTH PHYSICIAN OFFICES, QUICKLY LINK SKILLED INTERPRETERS WITH PATIENTS AND CAREGIVERS.

AUTOMATIC EXTERNAL DEFIBRILLATORS - FOR MORE THAN 10 YEARS, ROCKFORD HEALTH SYSTEM, IN PARTNERSHIP WITH THE ROCKFORD MEMORIAL DEVELOPMENT FOUNDATION, HAS BEEN HELPING COMMUNITY NON-PROFIT ORGANIZATIONS OBTAIN AUTOMATIC EXTERNAL DEFIBRILLATORS (AEDS). THESE PORTABLE, EASY-TO-USE DEVICES ADMINISTER IMMEDIATE, LIFE-SAVING TREATMENT THAT SHOCKS A HEART IN CARDIAC ARREST BACK TO A REGULAR HEARTBEAT. FROM THE INCEPTION OF THE PROGRAM IN 1999 THROUGH 2012, THE FOUNDATION HAS DONATED 126 AEDS TO COMMUNITY ORGANIZATIONS AND FACILITIES IN THE ROCKFORD AREA THROUGH ITS EXTERNAL GRANTS PROGRAM.

THE DOMESTIC VIOLENCE PROGRAM PROVIDES A 24-HOUR EMERGENCY SHELTER, CRISIS HOTLINE, AND A BROAD ARRAY OF COUNSELING, EDUCATION AND OTHER ASSISTANCE. SUPPORT FROM ROCKFORD HEALTH SYSTEM ALLOWS REMEDIES TO PROVIDE OVER-THE-COUNTER MEDICINES AND OTHER SUPPORT TO ADULTS AND CHILDREN FLEEING VIOLENCE. ROCKFORD HEALTH SYSTEM ALSO PROVIDES SUPPORT TO OTHER ORGANIZATIONS PROVIDING COMMUNITY RESOURCES FOR SUCH IMPORTANT ISSUES AS POVERTY, VIOLENCE, MENTAL HEALTH AND SUBSTANCE ABUSE INCLUDING: ROCKFORD SEXUAL ASSAULT COUNSELING, THE ROCKFORD RESCUE MISSION, THE SALVATION ARMY, THE ROSECRANCE FOUNDATION, AND NAMI NORTHERN ILLINOIS MENTAL HEALTH AWARENESS. SUPPORT FOR OTHER COMMUNITY RESOURCES - ROCKFORD HEALTH SYSTEM PARTNERS WITH A WIDE VARIETY OF COMMUNITY ORGANIZATIONS THAT PROVIDE DIRECT SUPPORT AND SERVICES TO AREA CITIZENS. AMONG THE COMMUNITY ORGANIZATIONS SUPPORTED BY ROCKFORD HEALTH SYSTEM IN 2013 ARE: THE ALZHEIMER'S ASSOCIATION, THE AMERICAN CANCER SOCIETY, THE EPILEPSY FOUNDATION, HEALING PATHWAYS CANCER RESOURCE CENTER, AND RAMP. DIVERSE NEEDS - ROCKFORD HEALTH SYSTEM COLLABORATES WITH ORGANIZATIONS ACROSS OUR COMMUNITY ENSURING THAT MANY DIVERSE POPULATIONS BENEFIT FROM OUR SUPPORT. IN 2013, ROCKFORD HEALTH SYSTEM PROVIDED SUPPORT FOR MINORITY NURSING SCHOLARSHIPS, THE ROCKFORD AREA MINORITY MANAGEMENT ORGANIZATION, THE BLACK HEALTHCARE INITIATIVE, AND LA VOZ LATINA. EMPLOYEE CRISIS FUND - PHILANTHROPY HAS ALWAYS BEEN A VITAL PART OF ROCKFORD HEALTH SYSTEM SINCE ITS VERY BEGINNINGS. THROUGH THE RHS FAMILY CAMPAIGN, WE EXTEND THAT SAME OPPORTUNITY AND SATISFACTION TO ALL OUR EMPLOYEES AND VOLUNTEERS. ONE OF THE COMPONENTS OF THE ANNUAL RHS FAMILY CAMPAIGN IS THE EMPLOYEE CRISIS FUND WHICH IS TOTALLY FUNDED BY EMPLOYEE AND VOLUNTEER DONATIONS AND SUPPORTS RHS EMPLOYEES DURING TIMES OF NEED. RHS PROVIDES A ONE-THIRD MATCH TO THE TOTAL GIFTS FROM EMPLOYEES. SINCE ITS INCEPTION IN 2007, THROUGH 2013, THE FUND HAS PROVIDED MORE THAN $364,000 IN ASSISTANCE TO FELLOW EMPLOYEES FACING DIFFICULTIES. SUPPORT OF MORE THAN $50,000 WAS PROVIDED IN 2013 ALONE. THE ASSISTANCE COMES IN MANY FORMS AND MAY INCLUDE PAID TIME OFF FOR EMPLOYEES WHO HAVE LOVED ONES WITH SIGNIFICANT MEDICAL CONDITIONS OR TO HELP PAY EXPENSES RELATED TO HOMES DAMAGED BY FIRE AND FLOOD. THESE ARE ONLY A COUPLE OF EXAMPLES OF HOW RHS AND OUR EMPLOYEES COME TOGETHER TO HELP THOSE IN NEED. HEALTHY WOMAN - CLOSE TO 600 WOMEN FROM THE ROCK RIVER VALLEY ATTENDED HEALTHY WOMAN 2013. THE ANNUAL EVENT, SPONSORED BY THE WOMEN'S CENTER AT ROCKFORD HEALTH SYSTEM FEATURES A KEYNOTE SPEAKER, FREE HEALTH SCREENINGS, AND A HEALTH AND WELLNESS EXPO THAT FEATURES INFORMATION ABOUT VARIOUS RHS PROGRAMS AND PREVENTATIVE MEASURES TO OPTIMIZE WOMEN'S HEALTH. ROCKFORD HEALTH SYSTEM CAREGIVERS ALSO PROVIDED A VARIETY OF COMMUNITY EDUCATION, HEALTH PROMOTION AND EDUCATION EVENTS THROUGHOUT THE COMMUNITY IN 2013. TOPICS INCLUDED STROKE AWARENESS AND PREVENTION, PERIMENOPAUSE, ENDOMETRIOSIS, DEPRESSION SCREENINGS AND ADVANCED ILLNESS MANAGEMENT AND PALLIATIVE CARE. (SEE CONTINUATION #1 BELOW)"

THE PURPOSE OF THE BOARD IS TO REVIEW QUESTIONABLE DEATHS OF AREA SENIORS THAT MAY POTENTIALLY BE ATTRIBUTED TO ABUSE. INPUT FROM INDIVIDUALS WHO INTERVENE IN ELDER ABUSE CAN ACTUALLY CLOSE THE DOOR ON A QUESTIONABLE DEATH OR OPEN IT TO FURTHER INVESTIGATION. REVIEW BOARDS SUCH AS THIS HAVE HELPED WITH THE PROSECUTION OF THOSE WHO ABUSE SENIOR CITIZENS. NEIGHBORHOOD HOME OWNERSHIP PROGRAM - ROCKFORD HEALTH SYSTEM OWNS APPROXIMATELY 40 HOMES AND/OR APARTMENT BUILDINGS CLOSE TO THE WEST-SIDE CAMPUS. THESE HOMES AND APARTMENTS ARE RENTED AND SOLD TO EMPLOYEES IN AN EFFORT TO MAINTAIN THE LONG-TERM STABILITY OF THE NEIGHBORHOOD. WITH A PREDOMINATELY OLDER WEST-SIDE NEIGHBORHOOD IN AN AREA THAT HAS BEEN PLAGUED WITH SIGNIFICANT INCIDENCES OF CRIME, LONG-TERM STABILITY IS CRUCIAL TO THE AREA. IN ADDITION TO PROVIDING RENTAL OPPORTUNITIES FOR EMPLOYEES, RHS OFFERS A NEIGHBORHOOD HOME OWNERSHIP PROGRAM WHICH PROVIDES NO INTEREST LOANS TO COVER DOWN-PAYMENT AND CLOSING COSTS FOR EMPLOYEES PURCHASING HOMES IN THE IMMEDIATE AREA AROUND THE HOSPITAL'S N. ROCKTON AVE. CAMPUS. ROCKFORD POLICE DEPARTMENT AND NEIGHBORHOOD WATCH INITIATIVES - ROCKFORD HEALTH SYSTEM IS PARTNERING WITH THE CITY OF ROCKFORD AND THE ROCKFORD POLICE DEPARTMENT TO FIGHT CRIME IN OUR WEST SIDE NEIGHBORHOOD, INCLUDING HOSTING NEIGHBORHOOD WATCH MEETINGS AT ROCKFORD MEMORIAL HOSPITAL. HUNDREDS OF RESIDENTS HAVE ATTENDED AND ARE ENCOURAGED TO ASSIST POLICE IN IDENTIFYING PROBLEMS AND IMPROVING THE NEIGHBORHOOD BY REPORTING CRIME OR SUSPICIOUS ACTIVITY. THE MEETINGS HAVE PROMPTED THE POLICE DEPARTMENT TO SET UP PATROLS AND HAVE AN ONGOING DIALOGUE WITH RESIDENTS."

FINANCIAL ASSISTANCE AND CERTAIN OTHER COMMUNITY BENEFITS AT COST:,"PART I LINC 3C THIS QUESTION IS NOT APPLICABLE BECAUSE PRESENCE HEALTH USES THE FEDERAL POVERTY GUIDELINES. PART I LINE 6A PRESENCE HEALTH PUBLISHED A COMMUNITY BENEFIT REPORT WITH 2013 DATA, WHICH DETAILS THE COMBINED CHARITABLE IMPACT OUR MINISTRIES HAVE WITHIN THE COMMUNITIES WE SERVE.

201413189349308121,364195126,Part II. COMMUNITY BUILDING ACTIVITIES:,"COMMUNITY BUILDING ACTIVITIES INCLUDE PROGRAMS THAT IMPROVE THE COMMUNITY'S HEALTH AND SAFETY BY ADDRESSING THE ROOT CAUSES OF HEALTH PROBLEMS, SUCH AS POVERTY, HOMELESSNESS AND ENVIRONMENTAL HAZARDS. PARTICIPATION IN COLLABORATIVE COMMUNITY EFFORTS TO PROMOTE PUBLIC HEALTH INITIATIVES IS ALSO INCLUDED, SUCH AS ENGAGEMENT IN COALITIONS AND ADVOCACY FOR HEALTH IMPROVEMENT. THESE ACTIVITIES STRENGTHEN THE COMMUNITY'S CAPACITY TO PROMOTE THE HEALTH AND WELL-BEING OF ITS RESIDENTS BY OFFERING THE EXPERTISE AND RESOURCES OF THE HEALTH CARE ORGANIZATION. PRESENCE HEALTH HOSPITAL MINISTRIES ENGAGE IN A VARIETY OF COMMUNITY-BUILDING ACTIVITIES WHICH ULTIMATELY IMPROVE THE HEALTH AND WELL-BEING OF THE COMMUNITIES WE ARE PRIVILEGED TO SERVE, EVEN THOUGH THEY ARE NOT SPECIFIC HEALTH ACTIVITIES. EXAMPLES OF COMMUNITY BUILDING ACTIVITIES INCLUDE: *THE WORK OF ALL OF OUR HOSPITALS IN SUPPORT OF DISASTER READINESS AND EMERGENCY PREPAREDNESS. THIS WORK GOES ABOVE AND BEYOND ANY LICENSURE REQUIREMENTS TO PROACTIVELY ENSURE THAT OUR COMMUNITIES ARE SAFE AND PREPARED IF A DISASTER SHOULD PRESENT ITSELF. *COMMUNITY SUPPORT: DONATIONS FROM OUR MINISTRIES TO ORGANIZATIONS ADDRESSING THE ROOT CAUSES OF HEALTH PROBLEMS. *COALITION BUILDING: PRESENCE SAINT JOSEPH MEDICAL CENTER LEADS A COMMUNITY COALITION, JOLIET PARTNERS FOR HEALTHY FAMILIES (JPHF), WITH THE GOAL OF MAKING WILL COUNTY A HEALTHIER PLACE TO LIVE. JPHF IS WORKING WITH LOCAL LEGISLATORS ON POLICY, SYSTEMS AND ENVIRONMENTAL CHANGES. *WORKFORCE DEVELOPMENT: PRESENCE ST. MARY'S HOSPITAL PARTNERS WITH THE KANKAKEE REGIONAL VOLUNTEER SERVICES COALITION. THIS COALITION ALLOWS LOCAL TEEN PARTICIPANTS THE OPPORTUNITY TO USE THEIR TIME AND TALENTS FOR THOSE IN NEED, WHILE PROVIDING THEMSELVES WITH EXCELLENT EXPOSURE TO MANY HEALTH-RELATED CAREERS, AS WELL AS BUSINESS COMMUNICATIONS AND EARLY CHILDHOOD TEACHING."
201413189349308121,364195126,"Part III. BAD DEBT, MEDICARE, & COLLECTION PRACTICES:","PART III, SECTION A, LINE 2 THERE ARE NO ESTIMATES OF BAD DEBT INCLUDED. BAD DEBT IS AT TOTAL EXPENSE. PART III, SECTION A, LINE 3 THE PROVISION FOR FINANCIAL ASSISTANCE POLICY ALLOWS FOR ACCOUNTS IN BAD DEBT TO BE APPROVED FOR FINANCIAL ASSISTANCE IF THE PATIENT MEETS THE CRITERIA. THERE ARE POSSIBLE FINANCIAL ASSISTANCE ACCOUNTS IN BAD DEBT, ALTHOUGH THE EXACT PERCENTAGE IS UNKNOWN AS WE DO NOT HAVE THE APPROPRIATE TOOLS TO DETERMINE THIS PERCENTAGE ACCURATELY. PART III, SECTION A, LINE 4 PATIENTS' ACCOUNTS RECEIVABLE ARE REDUCED BY AN ALLOWANCE FOR UNCOLLECTIBLE ACCOUNTS. IN EVALUATING THE COLLECTIBILITY OF PATIENTS' ACCOUNTS RECEIVABLE, PRESENCE HEALTH ANALYZES ITS PAST HISTORY AND IDENTIFIES TRENDS FOR EACH OF ITS MAJOR PAYOR SOUCES OF REVENUE TO ESTIMATE THE APPROPRIATE ALLOWANCE FOR UNCOLLECTIBLE ACCOUNTS AND PROVISION FOR UNCOLLECTIBLE ACCOUNTS RECEIVABLE. MANAGEMENT REGULARLY REVIEWS DATA ABOUT THESE MAJOR PAYOR SOURCES OF REVENUE IN EVALUATING THE SUFFICIENCY OF THE ALLOWANCE FOR UNCOLLECTIBLE ACCOUNTS. FOR RECEIVABLES ASSOCIATED WITH SERVICES PROVIDED TO PATIENTS WHO HAVE THIRD-PARTY COVERAGE, PRESENCE HEALTH ANALYZES CONTRACTUALLY DUE AMOUNTS AND PROVIDES AN ALLOWANCE FOR UNCOLLECTIBLE ACCOUNTS AND A PROVISION FOR UNCOLLECTIBLE ACCOUNTS RECEIVABLE, IF NECESSARY. FOR RECEIVABLES ASSOCIATED WITH PATIENT RESPONSIBILITY (WHICH INCLUDES BOTH PATIENTS WITHOUT INSURANCE AND PATIENTS WITH DEDUCTIBLE AND COPAYMENT BALANCES DUE FOR WHICH THIRD-PARTY COVERAGE EXISTS FOR PART OF THE BILL), THE PATIENTS ARE SCREENED AGAINST PRESENCE HEALTH CHARITY CARE POLICY AND UNINSURED DISCOUNT POLICY. FOR ANY REMAINING PATIENT RESPONSIBILITY BALANCE, PRESENCE HEALTH RECORDS A PROVISION FOR UNCOLLECTIBLE ACCOUNTS RECEIVABLE IN THE PERIOD OF SERVICE ON THE BASIS OF ITS PAST EXPERIENCE, WHICH INDICATES THAT MANY PATIENTS ARE UNABLE OR UNWILLING TO PAY THE PORTION OF THEIR BILL FOR WHICH THEY ARE FINANCIALLY RESPONSIBLE. THE DIFFERENCE BETWEEN THE STANDARD RATE (OR DISCOUNTED RATES IF NEGOTIATED) AND THE AMOUNTS ACTUALLY COLLECTED AFTER ALL REASONABLE COLLECTION EFFORTS HAVE BEEN EXHAUSTED IS CHARGED OFF AGAINST THE ALLOWANCE FOR UNCOLLECTIBLE ACCOUNTS. PART III, SECTION B, LINE 8 PRESENCE HEALTH COMPUTES THE MEDICARE SHORTFALL BASED ON A RATIO OF COST TO CHARGES. PRESENCE HEALTH BELIEVES IT IS IMPORTANT FOR THE COMMUNITY AND THE IRS TO BE MADE AWARE OF GOVERNMENT SHORTFALLS, SPECIFICALLY MEDICARE. HOWEVER, WE ACKNOWLEDGE THAT MEDICARE SHORTFALLS MAY BE EXPERIENCED BY OTHER THAN NON-PROFIT HEALTHCARE ORGANIZATIONS. AS SUCH, PRESENCE HEALTH DOES NOT BELIEVE THAT MEDICARE SHORTFALL SHOULD BE CONSIDERED COMMUNITY BENEFIT. PART III, SECTION C, LINE 9B COLLECTION POLICIES ARE THE SAME FOR ALL PRESENCE HEALTH ENTITIES. PATIENTS ARE NOTIFIED OF THE FINANCIAL ASSISTANCE POLICY AT THE TIME OF REGISTRATION VIA POSTED NOTIFICATIONS AND ON EVERY ACCOUNT STATEMENT THAT IS SENT TO THEM. THIS INFORMATION IS AVAILABLE IN A NUMBER OF LANGUAGES. PATIENTS MAY APPLY FOR FINANCIAL ASSISTANCE AT ANY TIME DURING THE REVENUE CYCLE. PER THE PROVISION FOR FINANCIAL ASSISTANCE POLICY, THE COLLECTION PROCESS IS AS FOLLOWS: 1. PRE-LITIGATION REVIEW. PRIOR TO AN ACCOUNT BEING AUTHORIZED FOR THE FILING OF SUIT FOR NON-PAYMENT OF A PATIENT BILL, A FINAL REVIEW OF THE ACCOUNT WILL BE CONDUCTED AND APPROVED BY THE FINANCIAL COUNSELING REPRESENTATIVE (OR DESIGNEE) TO MAKE SURE THAT NO APPLICATION OF FINANCIAL ASSISTANCE WAS EVER RECEIVED AND THAT THERE EXISTS OBJECTIVE EVIDENCE THAT THE PATIENT DOES HAVE SUFFICIENT FINANCIAL MEANS TO PAY ALL OR PART OF HIS/HER BILL. PRIOR TO A COLLECTIONS SUIT BEING FILED, THE SELF-PAY COLLECTIONS DIRECTOR MUST REVIEW AND APPROVE. 2. RESIDENTIAL LIENS. NO HOSPITAL WILL PLACE A LIEN ON THE PRIMARY RESIDENCE OF A PATIENT WHO HAS BEEN DETERMINED TO BE ELIGIBLE FOR FINANCIAL ASSISTANCE/CHARITY CARE, FOR PAYMENT OF THE PATIENT'S UNDISCOUNTED BALANCE DUE. FURTHER, IN NO CASE WILL ANY HOSPITAL EXECUTE A LIEN BY FORCING THE SALE OR FORECLOSURE OF THE PRIMARY RESIDENCE OF ANY PATIENT TO PAY FOR ANY OUTSTANDING MEDICAL BILL. 3. NO USE OF BODY ATTACHMENTS. NO HOSPITAL WILL USE BODY ATTACHMENT TO REQUIRE ANY PERSON, WHETHER RECEIVING FINANCIAL ASSISTANCE/CHARITY CARE DISCOUNTS OR NOT, TO APPEAR IN COURT. 4. COLLECTION AGENCY REFERRALS. EACH HOSPITAL FINANCE ACCOUNTING WILL ENSURE THAT ALL COLLECTION AGENCIES USED TO COLLECT PATIENT BILLS PROMPTLY REFER ANY PATIENT WHO INDICATES FINANCIAL NEED, OR OTHERWISE APPEARS TO QUALIFY FOR FINANCIAL ASSISTANCE/CHARITY CARE DISCOUNTS, TO A FINANCIAL COUNSELOR TO DETERMINE IF THE PATIENT IS ELIGIBLE FOR SUCH A CHARITABLE DISCOUNT.

201413189349308121,364195126,"PART VI, 2","PRESENCE HEALTH MINISTRIES JOIN FORCES WITH LOCAL COMMUNITY ORGANIZATIONS TO ASSESS THE HEALTH NEEDS OF THE COMMUNITY. COMMUNITY HEALTH NEEDS ASSESSMENTS (CHNAS) ARE COMPLETED FOR THE INDIVIDUAL COUNTIES WE SERVE WITH COMMUNITY PARTNERS EVERY 3 YEARS AS REQUIRED. TO SUPPLEMENT THE CHNA, PRESENCE HOSPITALS ALSO REVIEW AND ANALYZE INPATIENT AND EMERGENCY DEPARTMENT UTILIZATION ON AN ANNUAL BASIS TO UNCOVER ANY NEW COMMUNITY HEALTH TRENDS. IN ADDITION TO ASSESSING THE HEALTH NEEDS, PRESENCE HOSPITAL MINISTRIES ALSO COMPLETE MEDICAL STAFF DEVELOPMENT PLANS. THE PLANS ARE CONDUCTED BY EXTERNAL CONSULTANTS, WHO PROVIDE AN INDEPENDENT ASSESSMENT OF THE NEED FOR PHYSICIANS BY SPECIALTY WITHIN THE HOSPITAL'S PRIMARY SERVICE AREA AS DEFINED BY STARK REGULATIONS. IDENTIFYING COMMUNITY NEEDS IS JUST ONE STEP IN THE CHNA PROCESS. THE MOST CRITICAL STEP IS PRIORITIZING AND ALIGNING EXPERTISE TO MAKE AN IMPACT ON THE IDENTIFIED NEEDS. TO FACILITATE THIS PROCESS, EACH HOSPITAL MINISTRY HAS A MISSION COMMITTEE OF THE BOARD THAT IS ULTIMATELY RESPONSIBLE FOR THE OVERSIGHT AND DIRECTION OF THE COMMUNITY BENEFIT INITIATIVES. ON AN ANNUAL BASIS THIS BOARD COMMITTEE, WHICH IS MADE UP OF COMMUNITY AND BOARD MEMBERS, RECOMMENDS APPROVAL TO THE HOSPITAL BOARD OF DIRECTORS THE HOSPITAL'S ANNUAL IMPLEMENTATION STRATEGY. THIS PLAN IDENTIFIES THE PRIORITIES AND ACTION THAT WILL TAKE PLACE OVER THE NEXT YEAR. PART VI, 3 PRESENCE HEALTH HOSPITAL MINISTRIES PROACTIVELY COMMUNICATE THE AVAILABILITY OF OUR FINANCIAL ASSISTANCE/CHARITY CARE PROGRAMS BY USING MULTIPLE TYPES OF APPROPRIATE MEDIA AND IN MULTIPLE APPROPRIATE LANGUAGES. THE MECHANISMS USED BY PRESENCE HEALTH HOSPITALS TO COMMUNICATE THE AVAILABILITY OF FINANCIAL ASSISTANCE/CHARITY CARE INCLUDE, BUT ARE NOT LIMITED TO THE FOLLOWING: 1. SIGNAGE. SIGNS ARE POSTED PROMINENTLY THROUGHOUT HIGH TRAFFIC AREAS OF OUR MINISTRIES, AS WELL AS WITHIN OUR INPATIENT AND OUTPATIENT REGISTRATION/PATIENT ADMITTING AREAS AND EMERGENCY DEPARTMENTS. SIGNS STATE THAT PATIENTS MAY BE ELIGIBLE FOR FINANCIAL ASSISTANCE/CHARITY CARE DISCOUNTS, AND DESCRIBE HOW TO OBTAIN MORE INFORMATION, INCLUDING IDENTIFICATION OF APPROPRIATE HOSPITAL REPRESENTATIVES BY TITLE. SIGNS ARE IN MULTIPLE LANGUAGES. 2. PROVISION OF FINANCIAL ASSISTANCE MATERIALS TO UNINSURED PATIENTS. PRESENCE HEALTH HOSPITALS PROVIDE A SUMMARY OF ITS FINANCIAL ASSISTANCE PROGRAMS AND A FINANCIAL ASSISTANCE APPLICATION TO ALL PERSONS RECEIVING HOSPITAL CARE THAT IT IDENTIFIES AS UNINSURED PATIENTS AT THE TIME OF IN-PERSON REGISTRATION, ADMISSION, OR SUCH LATER TIME THAT THE PATIENT IS FIRST IDENTIFIED AS AN UNINSURED PATIENT. FOR PATIENTS PRESENTING IN THE EMERGENCY DEPARTMENT, ALL PRESENCE HEALTH HOSPITALS PROVIDE SUCH FINANCIAL ASSISTANCE MATERIALS AT SUCH TIME AND IN SUCH MANNER AS IS CONSISTENT WITH THEIR OBLIGATIONS UNDER EMTALA TO ACCESS AND STABILIZE THE PATIENT BEFORE MAKING INQUIRY OF THE PATIENT'S ABILITY TO PAY. 3. BROCHURES. BROCHURES, INFORMATION SHEETS AND SIMILAR FORMS OF WRITTEN COMMUNICATION REGARDING THE HOSPITAL'S FINANCIAL ASSISTANCE/CHARITY CARE POLICY ARE MAINTAINED IN APPROPRIATE AREAS OF THE HOSPITAL (E.G. EMERGENCY DEPARTMENT, ORGANIZED REGISTRATION AREAS, THE BUSINESS OFFICE). THESE COMMUNICATIONS STATE IN MULTIPLE LANGUAGES THAT THE HOSPITAL OFFERS FINANCIAL ASSISTANCE/CHARITY CARE DISCOUNTS AND DESCRIBES HOW TO OBTAIN MORE INFORMATION. 4. WEBSITE. COMPREHENSIVE INFORMATION ABOUT OUR FINANCIAL ASSISTANCE PROGRAMS - INCLUDING ELIGIBILITY CRITERIA, APPLICATION DETAILS, AND CONTACT INFORMATION - IS ALSO AVAILABLE ON OUR CONSUMER WEB SITE (HTTP://PRESENCEHEALTH.ORG/PATIENTS-AND-VISITORS/FINANCIAL-ASSISTANCE). 5. BILLING NOTICES. EACH PRESENCE HEALTH HOSPITAL INCLUDES A NOTE ON OR WITH THE HOSPITAL BILL AND/OR STATEMENT REGARDING THE HOSPITAL'S FINANCIAL ASSISTANCE/CHARITY CARE PROGRAM AND HOW THE PATIENT MAY APPLY FOR CONSIDERATION UNDER THIS PROGRAM. 6. FINANCIAL COUNSELORS. EACH PRESENCE HEALTH HOSPITAL HAS ONE OR MORE FINANCIAL COUNSELORS WHOSE CONTACT INFORMATION IS LISTED OR PROVIDED WITH OTHER INFORMATION CONCERNING THE FINANCIAL ASSISTANCE/CHARITY CARE DISCOUNT PROGRAM. THESE COUNSELORS ARE AVAILABLE TO DISCUSS ELIGIBILITY AND OTHER QUESTIONS CONCERNING THE PROGRAM, AND PROVIDE ASSISTANCE WITH APPLICATIONS. THEY ARE ALSO AVAILABLE TO MEET WITH PATIENTS DURING THEIR STAY IF THEY HAVE QUESTIONS ABOUT THEIR ABILITY TO PAY FOR SERVICES AND OUR FINANCIAL ASSISTANCE PROGRAMS. 7. NOTIFICATION OF DETERMINATION. WHEN A PRESENCE HEALTH HOSPITAL MAKES A DETERMINATION THAT A PATIENT'S BILL IS DISCOUNTED OR ADJUSTED BASED ON A DETERMINATION OF FINANCIAL NEED, THE HOSPITAL NOTIFIES THE PATIENT OF SUCH ELIGIBILITY DETERMINATION AND THAT THERE IS NO FURTHER COLLECTION ACTION TAKEN ON THE DISCOUNTED PORTION OF THE PATIENT'S BILL."

PART VI, LINE 1 - DESCRIPTION FOR PART II N/A PART VI, LINE 1 - DESCRIPTION FOR PART III, LINES 2 - 4 THE FOOTNOTES TO ADVOCATE HEALTH CARE NETWORK AND SUBSIDIARIES' AUDITED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS DO NOT SPECIFICALLY ADDRESS BAD DEBT EXPENSE; RATHER, THE FOOTNOTE DESCRIBES ADVOCATE'S PATIENT ACCOUNTS RECEIVABLE POLICY AND THE PERCENTAGE OF ACCOUNTS RECEIVABLE THAT THE ALLOWANCE FOR DOUBTFUL ACCOUNTS COVERS (SEE PAGE 10 OF THE AUDITED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS). FOR 2013, FOR AHHC, THE ALLOWANCE FOR DOUBTFUL ACCOUNTS COVERED 22.16% OF NET PATIENT ACCOUNTS RECEIVABLE. PATIENT ACCOUNTS RECEIVABLE ARE STATED AT NET REALIZABLE VALUE. AHHC EVALUATES THE COLLECTABILITY OF ITS ACCOUNTS RECEIVABLE BASED ON THE LENGTH OF TIME THE RECEIVABLE IS OUTSTANDING, PAYER CLASS, HISTORICAL COLLECTION EXPERIENCE, AND TRENDS IN HEALTH CARE INSURANCE PROGRAMS. ACCOUNTS RECEIVABLE ARE CHARGED TO THE ALLOWANCE FOR UNCOLLECTIBLE ACCOUNTS WHEN THEY ARE DEEMED UNCOLLECTIBLE. THE COSTING METHODOLOGY USED IN DETERMINING THE AMOUNTS REPORTED ON LINES 2 AND 3 IS BASED ON THE RATIO OF PATIENT CARE COST TO CHARGES. THE UNREIMBURSED COST OF BAD DEBT WAS CALCULATED BY APPLYING THE ORGANIZATION'S COST TO CHARGE RATIO FROM THE MEDICARE COST REPORTS (CMS 2252-96 WORKSHEET C, PART 1, PPS INPATIENT RATIOS) TO THE ORGANIZATION'S BAD DEBT PROVISION PER GENERALLY ACCEPTED ACCOUNTING PRINCIPLES, LESS ANY PATIENT OR THIRD PARTY PAYOR PAYMENTS RECEIVED. ADVOCATE MAKES EVERY EFFORT TO IDENTIFY THOSE PATIENTS WHO ARE ELIGIBLE FOR FINANCIAL ASSISTANCE BY STRICTLY ADHERING TO ITS FINANCIAL ASSISTANCE POLICY. WE BELIEVE THAT ADVOCATE HAS A POPULATION OF PATIENTS WHO ARE UNINSURED OR UNDERINSURED BUT WHO DO NOT COMPLETE THE FINANCIAL ASSISTANCE APPLICATION. THE ESTIMATED AMOUNT OF BAD DEBT EXPENSE (AT COST) WHICH COULD BE REASONABLY ATTRIBUTABLE TO PATIENTS WHO WOULD LIKELY QUALIFY FOR FINANCIAL ASSISTANCE UNDER THE ORGANIZATION'S FINANCIAL ASSISTANCE POLICY, IF SUFFICIENT INFORMATION HAD BEEN AVAILABLE TO MAKE A DETERMINATION OF THEIR ELIGIBILITY, WAS BASED UPON SELF PAY PATIENT ACCOUNTS WHICH HAD AMOUNTS WRITTEN OFF TO BAD DEBTS. OUR METHOD WAS TO BEGIN WITH THE SELF-PAY PORTION OF BAD DEBT EXPENSE PROVISION. THE SELF-PAY PORTION EXCLUDES THOSE PATIENTS WHO HAD CHARITY APPLICATIONS PENDING AT THE TIME OF SERVICE. THIS COST WAS THEN REDUCED BY CHARGES IDENTIFIED AS TRUE BAD DEBT EXPENSE, INCLUDING COPAYS FOR PATIENTS WHO QUALIFIED FOR LESS THAN 100% FINANCIAL ASSISTANCE. THE COST TO CHARGE RATIO WAS THEN APPLIED TO THE REMAINING CHARGES, TO DETERMINE THE VALUE (AT COST) OF PATIENT ACCOUNTS THAT DID NOT COMPLETE FINANCIAL COUNSELING AND WERE ASSIGNED TO BAD DEBT. WE BELIEVE THIS PROCESS IS A REASONABLE BASIS FOR OUR ESTIMATE. AS WE ARE ONLY CONSIDERING SELF-PAY ACCOUNTS WRITTEN OFF TO BAD DEBT FOR THIS ESTIMATE, THIS ESTIMATE DOES NOT INCLUDE THE IMMEDIATE 20% DISCOUNT TO CHARGES WHICH IS APPLIED TO ALL SELF-PAY PATIENTS. IT ALSO DOES NOT INCLUDE ACCOUNT BALANCES OR CO-PAYS OF NON-SELF PAY ACCOUNTS WHICH ARE WRITTEN OFF TO BAD DEBT WHEN THE PATIENT HAS NO OTHER FINANCIAL RESOURCES TO PAY THESE AMOUNTS AND THE PATIENT DOES NOT APPLY FOR FINANCIAL ASSISTANCE. BAD DEBT AMOUNTS HAVE BEEN EXCLUDED FROM OTHER COMMUNITY BENEFIT AMOUNTS REPORTED THROUGHOUT SCHEDULE H. PART VI, LINE 1 - DESCRIPTION FOR PART III, LINE 8 THE SHORTFALL OF $95,103,916 ON PART III, LINE 7 IS THE UNREIMBURSED COST OF PROVIDING SERVICES FOR MEDICARE PATIENTS AND SHOULD BE TREATED AS COMMUNITY BENEFIT BECAUSE PROVIDING THESE SERVICES WITHOUT REIMBURSEMENT LESSENS THE BURDENS OF GOVERNMENT OR OTHER CHARITIES THAT WOULD OTHERWISE BE NEEDED TO SERVE THE COMMUNITY. FOR ADVOCATE HEALTH AND HOSPITAL CORPORATION'S HOSPITAL OPERATIONS, THE UNREIMBURSED COST OF MEDICARE WAS CALCULATED BY APPLYING THE ORGANIZATION'S COST TO CHARGE RATIO FROM THE MEDICARE COST REPORTS (CMS 2252-96 WORKSHEET C, PART 1, PPS INPATIENT RATIOS) AND FOR NON-HOSPITAL OPERATIONS THE COST TO CHARGE RATIO CALCULATED ON WORKSHEET 2 RATIO OF PATIENT CARE COST TO CHARGES TO THE ORGANIZATION'S MEDICARE, LESS ANY PATIENT OR THIRD PARTY PAYOR PAYMENTS AND/OR CONTRIBUTIONS RECEIVED THAT WERE DESIGNATED FOR THE PAYMENT OF MEDICARE PATIENT BILLS. PART VI, LINE 1 - DESCRIPTION FOR PART III, LINE 9B ADVOCATE HEALTH AND HOSPITALS CORPORATION MAINTAINS BOTH WRITTEN FINANCIAL ASSISTANCE AND BAD DEBT/COLLECTION POLICIES. THE BAD DEBT/COLLECTION POLICY DOES NOT APPLY TO THOSE PATIENTS KNOWN TO QUALIFY FOR CHARITY CARE OR OTHER FINANCIAL ASSISTANCE, THEREFORE SUCH PATIENTS ARE NOT SUBJECT TO COLLECTION PRACTICES."

PRE/POST SURVEYS WERE TAKEN AS WELL AS CERTAIN BIOMETRICS, ALTHOUGH THERE WAS NOT ENOUGH POST PARTICIPANT PARTICIPATION IN 2013 TO MEASURE TO A STATISTICALLY RELEVANT PRE/POST METRICS. CHANGES TO THE CLASSES AND MEASUREMENTS ARE BEING IMPLEMENTED IN THE PROGRAM IN 2014. DEVELOPED AND OPENED THE SOUTH ASIAN CARDIOVASCULAR CENTER (SACC), A FIRST OF ITS KIND IN THE MIDWEST TO UNIQUELY ADDRESS THE ELEVATED RISK OF CARDIOVASCULAR DISEASE EXPERIENCED BY PEOPLE OF SOUTH ASIAN DESCENT. WITH NEARLY 84,000 SOUTH ASIANS LIVING IN HOSPITAL'S SERVICE AREA, THE SACC PROVIDES CULTURALLY SENSITIVE CLINICAL CARE, WHILE PROVIDING EDUCATION AND SCREENINGS FOR CARDIOVASCULAR DISEASE IN THE COMMUNITY. A VARIETY OF FACTORS, INCLUDING HIGHER RATES OF METABOLIC SYNDROME AND ATHEROGENIC LIPID PROFILES, BIOMARKERS FOR THROMBOSIS AND INFLAMMATION, AND CULTURALLY UNIQUE LIFESTYLE CHOICES HAVE SHOWN THAT TRADITIONAL CARDIOVASCULAR RISK STRATIFICATION MODELS, SUCH AS THE FRAMINGHAM RISK FACTOR PROFILE SCORE, DO NOT EFFECTIVELY STRATIFY THE RISK FOR SOUTH ASIANS. THE SOUTH ASIAN CARDIOVASCULAR CENTER WAS ESTABLISHED TO DEVELOP A UNIQUE MULTI-PRONGED APPROACH TO REDUCE THESE RISK FACTORS. THIS APPROACH INCLUDES COMMUNITY EDUCATION AND ENGAGEMENT, CLINICAL SERVICES (WITH A CULTURALLY APPROPRIATE CLINICAL NURSE NAVIGATOR) AND A RESEARCH COMPONENT. THE CENTER IS ALSO ACTIVELY RAISING AWARENESS OF THE PREVALENCE OF CARDIOVASCULAR DISEASE IN THE SOUTH ASIAN COMMUNITY THROUGH A PARTNERSHIP WITH THE AMERICAN HEART ASSOCIATION AND HELD A RED SARI EVENT, WHICH WAS WIDELY ATTENDED BY COMMUNITY, PUBLIC HEALTH AND SOUTH ASIAN LEADERS.

CARING FOR OUR EARTH IS STRONGLY CONNECTED TO OUR MISSION TO SERVE THE HEALTH NEEDS OF TODAY'S PATIENTS AND FAMILIES WITHOUT COMPROMISING THE NEEDS OF FUTURE GENERATIONS. BY CONSERVING RESOURCES, MINIMIZING EXPOSURE TO CHEMICALS AND CONSTRUCTING ECO-FRIENDLY BUILDINGS AND LANDSCAPES, ADVOCATE IS MAKING STRIDES TO REDUCE THE ENVIRONMENTAL IMPACT OF HEALTH CARE AND THE BURDEN OF HEALTH CARE COSTS. ADVOCATE HAS COMMITTED RESOURCES TO SHARING ITS BEST PRACTICES IN WASTE REDUCTION, AND ENERGY AND WATER MANAGEMENT. REDUCING WASTE AND CONSERVING ENERGY AND WATER USE HAS A DIRECT BENEFIT ON THE HEALTH OF LOCAL COMMUNITIES VIA CLEANER COMMUNITIES, HEALTHIER AIR QUALITY, REDUCED GREEN HOUSE GASES, AND PRESERVATION OF NATURAL RESOURCES. ADVOCATE SHARES BEST PRACTICES FOR WATER MANAGEMENT WITH OTHER NONPROFIT HOSPITALS LOCALLY AND NATIONALLY. IN 2013, ADVOCATE HEALTH CARE CONTINUED ITS LEADERSHIP ROLE AS ONE OF SEVERAL U.S. HEALTH SYSTEMS WHO FOUNDED AND SPONSOR A NATIONAL CAMPAIGN, THE HEALTHIER HOSPITALS INITIATIVE (HHI). HHI SERVES AS A GUIDE FOR HOSPITALS TO COMMIT TO IMPROVING THE HEALTH AND SAFETY OF PATIENTS, STAFF AND COMMUNITIES AND LOWERING COSTS THROUGH CONSERVATION PRACTICES BY USING FREE STEP-BY-STEP GUIDES AND HOSPITAL-TO-HOSPITAL MENTORING TO IMPLEMENT THE HHI CHALLENGES IN THE CATEGORIES OF LEADERSHIP, HEALTHIER FOODS, LESS WASTE, LEANER ENERGY, SAFER CHEMICALS AND SMARTER PURCHASING. AS OF DECEMBER 2013, NEARLY 1,000, OR 20% OF THE NATION'S HOSPITALS ENROLLED IN THE HHI. OVER THE COURSE OF THREE YEARS, EACH ENROLLED HOSPITAL COMMITS TO ONE OR MORE OF THE SIX CHALLENGES. DATA COLLECTION FROM EACH HOSPITAL WILL SERVE TO MEASURE THE AGGREGATE ECONOMIC, ENVIRONMENTAL, AND HUMAN HEALTH BENEFITS OF IMPLEMENTING OPERATIONAL CHANGES UNDER EACH HHI CHALLENGE CATEGORY.

ADVOCATE HEALTH CARE'S BOARD OF DIRECTORS, SENIOR LEADERSHIP AND ASSOCIATES (EMPLOYEES) ARE COMMITTED TO POSITIVELY AFFECTING THE HEALTH STATUS AND QUALITY OF LIFE OF INDIVIDUALS AND POPULATIONS IN COMMUNITIES SERVED BY ADVOCATE THROUGH PROGRAMS AND PRACTICES THAT REFLECT ADVOCATE'S WHOLISTIC PHILOSOPHY. TO THAT END, THEY CONTINUE TO UNDERTAKE AND SUPPORT INITIATIVES THAT ENHANCE ACCESS TO HEALTH AND WELLNESS SERVICES WITHIN THE DIVERSE COMMUNITIES THAT ADVOCATE SERVES. SYSTEM LEADERSHIP IS BOTH DESIGNED TO DIRECT AND SUPPORT THE HOSPITALS IN THEIR EFFORTS TO ADDRESS IDENTIFIED COMMUNITY NEEDS. IN 2010, A MULTI-DISCIPLINARY TEAM OF INDIVIDUALS AT THE SYSTEM LEVEL HAVING OVERSIGHT RESPONSIBILITY FOR COMMUNITY BENEFITS REPORTING AND THE CHNA PROCESS WAS CONVENED TO LEAD THE HOSPITALS THROUGH THE CHNA PROCESS TO MEET STATE AND FEDERAL REGULATORY REQUIREMENTS. THIS TEAM, CALLED THE COMMUNITY HEALTH STEERING COMMITTEE, MET FREQUENTLY TO ASSURE THAT: THE HOSPITAL COMMUNITY HEALTH LEADERS ARE EDUCATED REGARDING HOW TO CONDUCT A CHNA; SITE COMMUNITY HEALTH COUNCILS ARE DEVELOPED AND MAINTAINED; THOSE CONDUCTING THE CHNA PROCESS PULL DATA FROM RELIABLE SOURCES; SOUND ASSUMPTIONS ARE MADE BASED ON THAT DATA; INTERNAL ADVOCATE AND COMMUNITY RESOURCES ARE MAPPED TO DETERMINE STRENGTHS AND WEAKNESSES; ACHIEVABLE NEEDS ARE SELECTED AS PRIORITIES; AND PLANNED INITIATIVES ARE GROUNDED IN EVIDENCE-BASED PROGRAMS THAT WILL YIELD RELIABLE OUTCOMES TO DETERMINE IMPACT. TO FOCUS THESE EFFORTS THROUGHOUT ADVOCATE HEALTH CARE, THE COMMUNITY BENEFITS PLAN WAS WRITTEN. THE PLAN'S BROAD GOALS AND OBJECTIVES WERE DESIGNED TO STRUCTURE SYSTEM-WIDE COMMUNITY BENEFITS ACTIVITIES WITHIN A STRATEGIC FRAMEWORK. INCLUDED IN THE COMMUNITY BENEFITS PLAN ARE NOT ONLY PLANNED GOALS AND OBJECTIVES FOCUSED ON ADDRESSING NEEDS AS IDENTIFIED THROUGH THE HOSPITAL COMMUNITY HEALTH NEEDS ASSESSMENT PROCESS, BUT ALSO OTHER SYSTEM-WIDE COMMUNITY BENEFITS/COMMUNITY HEALTH PROGRAMS SUCH AS CHARITY CARE. ADVOCATE'S COMMUNITY BENEFITS PLAN WAS DEVELOPED TO ESTABLISH STRATEGIES FOR IMPROVING ACCESS TO CARE AND POSITIVELY AFFECTING THE HEALTH OF THE COMMUNITIES THAT ADVOCATE SERVES. THE PLAN SETS THE COURSE FOR STRENGTHENING EXISTING PARTNERSHIPS AND BUILDING NEW ONES WITH INDIVIDUALS AND ORGANIZATIONS WITHIN ADVOCATE'S SERVICE AREAS IN ORDER TO LEVERAGE AND MAXIMIZE THE IMPACT OF ITS PROGRAMS. ADVOCATE'S COMMUNITY BENEFITS PLAN GOALS ARE AS FOLLOWS. GOAL 1: OPTIMIZE ADVOCATE'S ABILITY TO LEVERAGE ITS COMMUNITY HEALTH RESOURCES AND CONTINUE PROGRAMS THAT BENEFIT THE COMMUNITY BY PROSPECTIVELY ALIGNING SYSTEM AND SITE PLANS AND ACTIVITIES. IN ORDER TO ASSURE ALIGNMENT BETWEEN SITE AND SYSTEM GOALS, QUALITY AND CONSISTENCY AMONGST THE HOSPITALS' CHNAS AND TO LEVERAGE THE HOSPITALS' STAFF TIME AND CHNA EFFORTS, THE SYSTEM LEVEL COMMUNITY HEALTH STEERING COMMITTEE PROVIDED A STANDARDIZED CHNA PROCESS, TOOLS, EDUCATION AND STRUCTURE. SPECIFIC EXAMPLES OF THE SUPPORT PROVIDED BY THE STEERING COMMITTEE TO ENABLE THE HOSPITALS TO REALIZE THEIR COMMUNITY HEALTH GOALS AND OBJECTIVES ARE AS FOLLOWS. - A STANDARDIZED CHNA PROCESS THAT INCLUDED DEVELOPMENT OF A COMMUNITY HEALTH COUNCIL AT EACH HOSPITAL WITH BOTH HOSPITAL AND COMMUNITY REPRESENTATION. THE COUNCILS WERE CHARGED WITH MANAGING THEIR SITE'S ASSESSMENT, EXAMINING DATA, SITE AND COMMUNITY RESOURCES, SELECTING KEY PRIORITIES TO ADDRESS AND DEVELOPING A COMMUNITY HEALTH PLAN. - PURCHASE OF AND INSTRUCTION ON HOW TO USE SURVEY RESULTS AND THE ASSESSMENT TOOL DEVELOPED BY PROFESSIONAL RESEARCH CONSULTANTS. - LED A SERIES OF WORKSHOPS OVER THREE YEARS WITH INTERNAL AND EXTERNAL SPEAKERS PROFICIENT IN CHNAS, IDENTIFYING RELIABLE DATA SOURCES, PRIORITY SETTING, AND SELECTING EVIDENCE-BASED INTERVENTIONS. - SET THE COMMUNITY HEALTH LEADERSHIP COUNCIL'S AGENDAS, A COUNCIL COMPRISED OF COMMUNITY HEALTH STAKEHOLDERS FROM ACROSS ADVOCATE, TO FOCUS ON CHNA OBJECTIVES. - MANAGED HOSPITAL PROGRESS AGAINST SYSTEM ANNUAL TIMELINES TO ACHIEVE THE THREE-YEAR VISION, REQUIRING ANNUAL CHNA PROGRESS REPORTS AND THEIR REVIEW AND ENDORSEMENT BY THE HOSPITAL GOVERNING COUNCILS EACH YEAR. - PROVIDED ONGOING CONSULTATION ON AN AS NEED BASIS THROUGHOUT THE PROCESS. - ENGAGED AND FUNDED AN OUTSIDE CHNA CONSULTANT TO MEET ONE-ON-ONE WITH THE SITE COMMUNITY HEALTH LEADERS AND REVIEW CHNA PROGRESS AND PROVIDE GUIDANCE IN AREAS OF DIFFICULTY OR UNCERTAINTY. - PROVIDED AN OVERVIEW OF THE CHNA RESULTS AND PLANNED INTERVENTIONS TO THE MISSION & SPIRITUAL COMMITTEE OF THE ADVOCATE HEALTH CARE BOARD OF DIRECTORS TO SECURE THE COMMITTEE'S ENDORSEMENT. - A STANDARDIZED FORMAT FOR HOSPITALS TO USE IN DRAFTING THEIR CHNAS AND IMPLEMENTATION PLANS, WHICH SYSTEM LEADERS THEN REVIEWED AND EDITED FOR CONSISTENCY, ACCURACY AND QUALITY OF CONTENT. - WORKED WITH SYSTEM LEVEL MEDIA CENTER AND WEB TEAM TO DEVELOP PLACEMENT AND POSTING OF CHNA REPORTS & IMPLEMENTATION PLANS TO MEET PPACA/IRS REGULATORY REPORTING REQUIREMENTS. - IN PREPARATION FOR THE NEXT CHNA CYCLE, PURCHASED THE HEALTHY COMMUNITIES INSTITUTE'S CHNA TOOL IN LATE 2013 TO SUPPORT THE SITES IN CONDUCTING THEIR NEXT CHNA WHILE AT THE SAME TIME MONITORING OUTCOMES OF PLANNED INTERVENTIONS IMPLEMENTED AS A RESULT OF ADVOCATE'S FIRST (2011-2013) CHNA. THROUGH ADVOCATE'S HOSPITAL-BASED SERVICES, AS WELL AS ITS PARTICIPATION IN PROVIDING PROGRAMS AND SERVICES IN THE COMMUNITY, ADVOCATE PROMOTES A SHARED APPROACH TO COMMUNITY BENEFITS. IN ADDITION TO HOSPITAL/COMMUNITY SPECIFIC PROGRAMS, THERE ARE ALSO PROGRAMS ADDRESSING NEEDS OF BROAD GEOGRAPHIC PORTIONS OF ADVOCATE'S SERVICE AREA WHICH ARE MANAGED AND FUNDED AT THE SYSTEM LEVEL. THESE PROGRAMS INCLUDE THE FOLLOWING. IN 2013, ADVOCATE HEALTHY STEPS SPECIALISTS TOUCHED THE LIVES OF 6,688 YOUNG CHILDREN THROUGH CHILDHOOD PROGRAMS WITHIN PEDIATRIC/FAMILY PRACTICE RESIDENCIES AT ADVOCATE ILLINOIS MASONIC MEDICAL CENTER, AND ADVOCATE CHILDREN'S HOSPITAL OAK LAWN AND PARK RIDGE CAMPUSES. THIS SYSTEM-WIDE PROGRAM USES A NATIONAL MODEL TO ENGAGE PARENTS AS PARTNERS WITH PHYSICIANS IN THEIR CHILDREN'S HEALTH. HEALTHY STEPS SPECIALISTS HELP BRIDGE THE TWO GROUPS BY PREPARING PARENTS TO TAKE AN ACTIVE ROLE IN, AND PHYSICIANS TO ASSESS AND MEET MORE EFFECTIVELY, A RANGE OF CHILD DEVELOPMENT NEEDS. IN 2013, 9,749 DEVELOPMENTAL SCREENINGS WERE PROVIDED AND 445 FAMILIES WERE REFERRED TO COMMUNITY SERVICES FOR FOLLOW UP. IN ADDITION, HEALTHY STEPS HAS COMPLETED AN INITIATIVE, IN COLLABORATION WITH THE ILLINOIS CHAPTER OF THE AMERICAN ACADEMY OF PEDIATRICS, TO TRAIN PRIMARY CARE PROVIDERS ACROSS THE STATE TO IMPROVE PREVENTIVE PRACTICES IN THEIR SITE AROUND TOPICS SUCH AS USE OF VALIDATED TOOLS FOR DEVELOPMENTAL AND FAMILY RISK FACTOR SCREENINGS (SUCH AS POSTPARTUM DEPRESSION, DOMESTIC VIOLENCE, TRAUMA, AND PSYCHOSOCIAL ISSUES) AND TEACH PRIMARY CARE PROVIDERS AND THEIR STAFF HOW TO REFER TO LOCAL COMMUNITY RESOURCES FOR FOLLOW-UP CARE. DURING 2013, ADVOCATE HEALTHY STEPS CONSULTANTS PROVIDED 179 PRESENTATIONS IN 57 PRIMARY CARE SITES, TO 740 PHYSICIANS AND THEIR STAFFS THROUGHOUT THE STATE OF ILLINOIS. THESE PROVIDERS CARE FOR APPROXIMATELY 154,835 CHILDREN BETWEEN BIRTH AND AGE THREE. CURRENTLY, HEALTHY STEPS IS FOCUSING ON DEVELOPMENTAL BEHAVIORAL MENTAL HEALTH TRAINING FOR PRIMARY CARE PROVIDERS. THE STAFF ALSO MEETS REGULARLY WITH APPROXIMATELY 20 COMMUNITY ORGANIZATIONS, AND WORK WITH PEDIATRIC AND FAMILY MEDICINE RESIDENCY PROGRAMS, PEDIATRIC NURSE PRACTITIONERS AND PHYSICIAN ASSISTANT PROGRAMS THROUGHOUT THE STATE. THE ADVOCATE CHILDHOOD TRAUMA TREATMENT PROGRAM (CTTP), A SYSTEM LEVEL, SYSTEM-WIDE INITIATIVE, OFFERS HOPE AND HEALING TO CHILDREN WHO HAVE EXPERIENCED MALTREATMENT, PSYCHOLOGICAL TRAUMA AND SEXUAL ABUSE. CLINICIANS WORK WITH A CHILD'S ENTIRE SUPPORT NETWORK - PARENTS, THE SCHOOL AND MORE - TO HELP FOSTER A SAFE ENVIRONMENT FOR THE CHILD. CTTP IS ONE OF JUST A HANDFUL OF PROGRAMS IN THE STATE THAT SPECIALIZES IN MENTAL HEALTH FOR CHILDREN. IN 2013, CTTP SERVED 171 CHILDREN AND ADOLESCENTS, AS WELL AS 420 ADULTS, CAREGIVERS, PARENTS AND OTHERS. IN ADDITION, THE PROGRAM HAS PARTNERED WITH ""DARKNESS TO LIGHT,"" A NATIONALLY RECOGNIZED CHILD SEXUAL ABUSE PREVENTION LEADER. AS A RESULT OF THIS PARTNERSHIP, THE CTTP HAS LAUNCHED A MAJOR ADULT EDUCATION PROGRAM CALLED ""STEWARDS OF CHILDREN/7 STEPS TO PROTECT A CHILD."" THIS PROGRAM HAS EDUCATED OVER 1,400 ADULTS AT SCHOOLS, CHURCHES, LAW ENFORCEMENT AGENCIES, CHILD WELFARE AGENCIES AND CIVIC ORGANIZATIONS, THEREBY BETTER PROTECTING 14,000 CHILDREN. SINCE 1995, ADVOCATE HEALTH CARE'S OFFICE FOR MISSION AND SPIRITUAL CARE HAS PROVIDED CLINICAL CHAPLAINS AND ETHICISTS THROUGHOUT ADVOCATE WHO OFFER SUPPORT AND SERVICES TO INDIVIDUALS AND FAMILIES FACING MEDICAL CRISIS. ADVOCATE'S SPIRITUAL LEADERS ALSO OVERSEE A NATIONALLY ACCREDITED CLINICAL PASTORAL EDUCATION PROGRAM. TRAINING"

THE CENTER FORMED IN 2009 OUT OF A GROWING CONCERN IN CHICAGO'S FAITH AND HEALTH MOVEMENT ABOUT THE WAYS IN WHICH SOCIAL CONDITIONS-POVERTY, RACISM, UNEMPLOYMENT, LACK OF ACCESS TO CARE-IMPACT PEOPLE'S HEALTH. THE CENTER WAS CREATED TO MOBILIZE FAITH COMMUNITIES TO CHANGE THE SOCIAL CONDITIONS THAT AFFECT PEOPLE'S HEALTH. THE CENTER ALSO HOSTS A WEBSITE THAT SERVES AS A GATHERING PLACE FOR THE FAITH AND HEALTH MOVEMENT TO SHARE INFORMATION, POST EVENTS, SHARE INTERESTING PROJECTS, SHARE RESOURCES AND IDEAS, AND KEEP IN TOUCH WITH WHAT OTHERS ARE DOING. GO TO WWW.CHICAGOFAITHANDHEALTH.ORG FOR MORE INFORMATION. ADVOCATE ALSO PROVIDES A SYSTEM-WIDE TELEPHONE REFERRAL AND RESOURCE INFORMATION CENTER TO ASSIST PATIENTS AND COMMUNITY MEMBERS IN FINDING HEALTHCARE PROVIDERS AND OTHER HEALTH AND WELLNESS RESOURCES. THE CENTER'S STAFF SERVES AS A COMMUNITY RESOURCE, PROVIDING INDIVIDUALS FROM THE COMMUNITY WITH REFERRALS TO GOVERNMENT-FUNDED AND COMMUNITY-BASED NON-ADVOCATE PROGRAMS AND SERVICES, AS WELL AS ADVOCATE HEALTH CARE PHYSICIANS AND SERVICES. GOAL 4: LEVERAGE RESOURCES AND MAXIMIZE COMMUNITY OUTREACH EFFORTS BY BUILDING AND STRENGTHENING COMMUNITY PARTNERSHIPS. ADVOCATE'S SYSTEM LEVEL LEADERS MAINTAIN AND CONTINUE TO ACTIVELY EXPAND SYSTEM PARTNERSHIPS AND RELATIONSHIPS WITH A WIDE VARIETY OF ORGANIZATIONS, INCLUDING RELIGIOUS ORGANIZATIONS, NEIGHBORHOOD GROUPS AND OUTREACH AND RESOURCE PROGRAMS. THESE RELATIONSHIPS SERVE TO LEVERAGE BOTH ADVOCATE'S AND ITS COMMUNITIES' RESOURCES TO MAXIMIZE COMMUNITY OUTREACH EFFORTS. ADVOCATE BUILDS ON RELATIONSHIPS THAT ASSOCIATES AND AFFILIATED PHYSICIANS HAVE WITH COMMUNITY HEALTH PARTNERS, AND TO EMPOWER THE DEVELOPMENT OF SUCH PARTNERSHIPS. AN EXAMPLE OF THIS IS ADVOCATE MEDICAL GROUP'S (ADVOCATE-EMPLOYED PHYSICIANS) ANNUAL COLLABORATION WITH SPECIAL OLYMPICS OF ILLINOIS. THIS EVENT, MEDFEST, PROVIDES PEOPLE WITH INTELLECTUAL DISABILITIES OPPORTUNITIES TO PARTICIPATE IN SPORTS TRAINING AND COMPETITIONS, CREATING AVENUES FOR INCLUSION AND ACCEPTANCE FOR THIS SPECIAL NEEDS UNDERSERVED POPULATION. IN ADDITION TO PROVIDING EASY ACCESS TO PHYSICALS FOR ATHLETES, THE FREE CLINICAL SERVICES RESULT IN ENHANCED PHYSICAL FITNESS AND COMFORT WITH THE MEDICAL COMMUNITY. DURING ITS 13TH SPONSORSHIP YEAR, AMG PROVIDED 1,550 FREE ATHLETIC PHYSICALS TO SPECIAL OLYMPIANS, ALLOWING THEM OPPORTUNITIES TO PARTICIPATE IN COMPETITIONS THROUGHOUT THE YEAR. SYSTEM LEVEL MANAGEMENT ALSO OVERSEES ASSOCIATE AND PHYSICIAN FUNDRAISING AND VOLUNTEER ACTIVITIES RELATED TO COMMUNITY ORGANIZATIONS AND PARTNERSHIPS. LAST YEAR ADVOCATE PROMOTED AND SUPPORTED ASSOCIATE, PHYSICIAN AND HOSPITAL PARTICIPATION IN WALKS, RUNS AND BICYCLE RACES FOR THE AMERICAN HEART ASSOCIATION, AMERICAN CANCER SOCIETY, AMERICAN DIABETES ASSOCIATION, ALZHEIMER'S ASSOCIATION AND MARCH OF DIMES. IN 2013, $565,192 IN CHARITABLE CONTRIBUTIONS WAS RAISED TO SUPPORT THESE PARTNER ORGANIZATIONS. ADVOCATE ASSOCIATES' SUPPORT OF THESE FUNDRAISERS AND THEIR GENEROUS CONTRIBUTIONS DURING THE 2013 ASSOCIATE GIVING CAMPAIGN RESULTED IN OVER $3.5 MILLION BEING RAISED TO SUPPORT MULTIPLE LOCAL COMMUNITY ORGANIZATIONS, PROGRAMS AND INITIATIVES, INCLUDING SOME OF ADVOCATE'S OWN SYSTEM-WIDE AND HOSPITAL-BASED COMMUNITY HEALTH PROGRAMS. SYSTEM MANAGEMENT OF FUNDRAISING ACTIVITIES REDUCES DUPLICATION OF EFFORT AND ASSURES THAT FUNDRAISING IS CONDUCTED WITH ORGANIZATIONS THAT ALIGN WITH ADVOCATE'S MISSION AND ARE EFFECTIVE IN ADDRESSING ADVOCATE'S SERVICE AREA'S COMMUNITY HEALTH NEEDS. THE ADVOCATE CHARITABLE FOUNDATION (ACF) WORKS TO FIND INNOVATIVE WAYS TO FUND NOT ONLY CLINICAL ADVANCEMENTS BUT COMMUNITY PROGRAMS THAT ADDRESS IDENTIFIED COMMUNITY NEEDS. ONE EXAMPLE OF THIS IS ACF'S ADMINISTRATION OF THE ADVOCATE BETHANY COMMUNITY HEALTH FUND. IN 2006, ADVOCATE HEALTH CARE ESTABLISHED THE BETHANY FUND AS PART OF ADVOCATE'S ONGOING COMMITMENT TO SUPPORT LOCAL NONPROFIT ORGANIZATIONS AS THEY BUILD, PROMOTE AND SUSTAIN HEALTHY COMMUNITIES ON CHICAGO'S WEST SIDE. THE ADVOCATE BETHANY COMMUNITY HEALTH FUND BOARD, WHICH IS COMPRISED OF EIGHT COMMUNITY MEMBERS FROM THE TARGETED COMMUNITY AREAS AND SEVEN REPRESENTATIVES FROM ADVOCATE HEALTH CARE, AWARDED MORE THAN $789,000 IN GRANTS AND CAPACITY-BUILDING SERVICES TO 33 ORGANIZATIONS ACROSS ITS FUND COMMUNITIES IN 2013. SINCE THE BOARD'S INSTALLATION IN 2007, THE BETHANY COMMUNITY HEALTH FUND HAS AWARDED NEARLY $6 MILLION IN PROGRAM DOLLARS AND SERVICES TO ORGANIZATIONS THAT PROMOTE HEALTH AND WELLNESS WITH A FOCUS ON ADDRESSING HEALTH DISPARITIES FOR RESIDENTS OF CHICAGO'S WEST SIDE. ADVOCATE HEALTH CARE HAS ALSO BEEN A KEY PARTNER IN THE NATIONAL COLLABORATIVE, THE HEALTH SYSTEMS LEARNING GROUP (HSLG), NOW KNOWN AS THE STAKEHOLDER HEALTH GROUP. THIS GROUP IS A SELF-ORGANIZED COLLABORATIVE OF 43 ORGANIZATIONS (INCLUDING 36 NON-PROFIT HEALTH SYSTEMS) THAT HAVE ENGAGED IN A SERIES OF MEETINGS ACROSS THE COUNTRY OVER THE PAST 2 YEARS. INSPIRED BY THE PASSAGE OF THE PATIENT PROTECTION AND AFFORDABLE CARE ACT, AND MOTIVATED BY THE RECOGNITION OF THE NEED TO TRANSFORM OUR ORGANIZATIONS AND OUR COMMUNITIES, THE GROUP MADE A COMMITMENT TO ACCELERATE THIS TRANSFORMATIONAL PROCESS THROUGH ONGOING SHARING OF INNOVATIVE PRACTICES THAT IMPROVE POPULATION HEALTH AND THE DEVELOPMENT OF COORDINATED STRATEGIES THAT TAKE INNOVATION TO SCALE. THE HEALTH SYSTEMS LEARNING GROUP ASPIRES TO IDENTIFY AND ACTIVATE A MENU OF PROVEN COMMUNITY HEALTH PRACTICES AND PARTNERSHIPS THAT WORK FROM THE TOP OF THE MISSION STATEMENT TO THE BOTTOM LINE. THE CREATION OF THIS LEARNING COLLABORATIVE WAS SPARKED BY A SERIES OF STAKEHOLDER MEETINGS AT THE WHITE HOUSE OFFICE AND DEPARTMENT OF HEALTH & HUMAN SERVICES CENTER FOR FAITH-BASED & NEIGHBORHOOD PARTNERSHIPS. THE HSLG PARTNERS HAVE CONTRIBUTED SUBSTANTIAL FINANCIAL AND IN-KIND RESOURCES TO SUPPORT THE 2 YEAR DEVELOPMENTAL PHASE. IN ADDITION, A GENEROUS GRANT WAS PROVIDED BY THE ROBERT WOOD JOHNSON FOUNDATION TO SUPPORT THE DISSEMINATION OF FINDINGS AND LESSONS LEARNED DURING THIS PERIOD. THE FIRST PHASE OF DEVELOPMENT FOR THE HSLG CULMINATED WITH A CONVENING ON APRIL 4, 2013 CO-HOSTED WITH THE WHITE HOUSE AND HHS CENTER FOR FAITH-BASED AND NEIGHBORHOOD PARTNERSHIPS, ALONG WITH THE CHIEF EXECUTIVE OFFICERS FROM MANY OF THE HEALTH SYSTEM PARTNERS. THE PURPOSE WAS TO REVIEW FINDINGS FROM THE PAST 18 MONTHS OF INQUIRY AND DIALOGUE AND TO CONSIDER A CALL TO ACTION ON A SPECIFIC SET OF RECOMMENDATIONS. SEE THE FOLLOWING LINK FOR THE MONOGRAPH PRESENTED AT THE MEETING. HTTP://WWW.METHODISTHEALTH.ORG/DOTASSET/9E6F77D8-DF4B-4545-B2F3-BC77B106F9 69.PDF GOAL 5: PROMOTE INTEGRATION OF AND ACCOUNTABILITY FOR SYSTEM AND SITE PLANS AND ACTIVITIES BY ENHANCING COORDINATION AND DEVELOPING GOVERNANCE RELATIONSHIPS. A CORE GROUP OF ADVOCATE SYSTEM-LEVEL LEADERS ACHIEVED INTEGRATION, ACCOUNTABILITY AND NEW GOVERNANCE RELATIONSHIPS THROUGH IMPLEMENTATION OF THE FOLLOWING. - STRENGTHENING THE ROLE/VISIBILITY OF THE COMMUNITY HEALTH LEADERSHIP COUNCIL -- A KEY FOCUS FOR THE SYSTEM CORE TEAM WAS TO STRENGTHEN THE ABILITY OF THE COMMUNITY HEALTH LEADERSHIP COUNCIL (CHLC) TO SERVE AS A RESOURCE AND PROVIDE GUIDANCE IN DEVELOPING AND IMPLEMENTING SYSTEM AND SITE COMMUNITY HEALTH PLANS. THE FOLLOWING ACTIONS WERE TAKEN TO REALIZE THIS OBJECTIVE - THE CHLC ROLE WAS DEFINED, A CHARTER APPROVED AND THE ROLE WAS COMMUNICATED AS APPROPRIATE WITHIN ADVOCATE AND IN THE COMMUNITY. MEETINGS WERE SCHEDULED MONTHLY TO ASSURE CLOSE COMMUNICATION AND ADHERENCE TO THE AMBITIOUS TIMELINE. - AS DESCRIBED EARLIER, THE COMMUNITY HEALTH STEERING COMMITTEE WAS CONVENED TO PLAN THE CHLC'S ACTIVITIES, I.E., SET AGENDAS, PROVIDE WORKSHOPS, TIMELINES AND DEADLINES TO ASSURE THE HOSPITALS AND THE SYSTEM MET THEIR GOALS AND WOULD BE FULLY COMPLIANT WITH THE PPACA. - REPORTING COMMUNITY HEALTH/COMMUNITY BENEFITS PLANNING, PROGRESS, AND ACHIEVEMENTS TO THE MISSION AND SPIRITUAL CARE COMMITTEE OF THE ADVOCATE BOARD OF DIRECTORS IN TANDEM WITH REPORTING COMMUNITY BENEFITS EXPENDITURES TO THE FINANCE COMMITTEE OF THE BOARD. - WHEN CONSIDERING WHICH GOVERNANCE BODY WOULD BE ACCOUNTABLE FOR REVIEWING AND ENDORSING THE HOSPITAL CHNA REPORTS AND IMPLEMENTATION PLANS, THE HOSPITAL GOVERNING COUNCILS WERE SELECTED GIVEN THEY ARE THE SENIOR GOVERNING BODY AT EACH HOSPITAL. ONE OR MORE MEMBERS OF THE HOSPITAL GOVERNING COUNCILS WERE ALSO RECRUITED TO PARTICIPATE ON THEIR SITE'S COMMUNITY HEALTH COUNCIL, SERVING AS BOTH A COMMUNITY REPRESENTATIVE HAVING INPUT INTO THE DECISIONS OF THE COMMUNITY HEALTH COUNCIL AND AS A GOVERNING COUNCIL MEMBER THAT COULD PROVIDE REPORTS ON COMMUNITY HEALTH PLAN PROGRESS BACK TO THE GOVERNING COUNCIL.

Charity care is provided to those patients where the household income (defined as income for the patient and any related guarantor as listed on the most recent Federal Tax Return) is at 200% or below federal poverty guidelines as published annually by the Community Service Administration in the Federal Register and where there are not substantial cash convertible assets or disposable income. Charity is predicated on the patient seeking Medicaid eligibility and fully cooperating with hospital staff (provide bank statements, proof of income, etc). Medicaid eligibility may be reevaluated each month or in connection with new services provided during the approved charity period (6 months.) If a patient qualifies for Charity care assistance, 100% of the billable charges are eliminated."

Accounts arewritten off when they are determined to be noncollectable based upon management'sassessment of individual accounts. The allowance for doubtful collections isestimated based upon a periodic review of the accounts receivable aging, payerclassifications, and application of historical write-off percentages.The estimated cost of services provided that ultimately result in bad debt expense are estimated utilizing the cost-to-charge ratio as determined by the filed cost report for the corresponding tax year related to this Form 990.UHCs cost of providing services to those patients that ultimately result in bad debt expense should be considered a community benefit because we are relieving a government burden by providing care to these patients without consideration for that patients ability to pay for these services. In the majority of cases, the determination of the patients ability to pay is not made until well after the services have been provided."

In evaluating the collectability of accounts receivable, the Corporation analyzes its past history and identifies trends for each of its major payor sources of revenue to estimate the appropriate allowance for doubtful accounts and provision for bad debts. Management regularly reviews data about these major payor sources of revenue in evaluating the sufficiency of the allowance for doubtful accounts. For receivables associated with services provided to patients who have third-party coverage, the Corporation analyzes contractually due amounts and provides an allowance for doubtful accounts and a provision for bad debts, if necessary. For receivables associated with self-pay patients (which includes both patients without insurance and patients with deductible and co-payment balances due for which third-party coverage exists for part of the bill), the Corporation records a provision for bad debts in the period of service on the basis of its past experience, which indicates that many patients are unable or unwilling to pay the portion of their bill for which they are financially responsible.

UH provides all of the Inpatient hospitalization for the Indigent population that is approved for Project Access. Through both of these groups UH is responsive to support them in their needs.UH provides many screenings in the community. One such screening is the PSA screening that is performed at Lowes Home Building stores. Many have received the screening and received positive results which were caught at an early stage. UH's Mobile Mammography unit travels to area plants and is available for screenings at the job site during lunch. These are only a few screening of the Screenings that UH provides in the community but have tremendous impact when just one screening identifies problems that can be treated at an early stage 1 cancer verses at the later stages of cancer.

Signs are posted prominently throughout high traffic areas of our ministries, as well as within our inpatient and outpatient registration/patient admitting areas and emergency departments. Signs state that patients may be eligible for Financial Assistance/Charity Care discounts, and describe how to obtain more information, including identification of appropriate hospital representatives by title. Signs are in multiple languages. 2. Provision of Financial Assistance Materials to Uninsured Patients. Presence Health hospitals provide a summary of its Financial Assistance Programs and a Financial Assistance application to all persons receiving hospital care that it identifies as uninsured patients at the time of in-person registration, admission, or such later time that the patient is first identified as an uninsured patient. For patients presenting in the Emergency Department, all Presence Health hospitals provide such Financial Assistance materials at such time and in such manner as is consistent with their obligations under EMTALA to access for and stabilize any patient with an emergency medical condition before making inquiry of the patient's ability to pay. 3. Brochures. Brochures, information sheets and similar forms of written communication regarding the hospital's Financial Assistance/Charity Care policy are maintained in appropriate areas of the hospital (e.g. Emergency Department, organized registration areas, the Business Office). These communications state in multiple languages that the hospital offers Financial Assistance/Charity Care discounts and describes how to obtain more information. 4. Website. Comprehensive information about our financial assistance programs - including eligibility criteria, application details, and contact information - is also available on our consumer Web site (http://presencehealth.org/patients-and-visitors/financial-assistance). 5. Billing Notices. Each Presence Health hospital includes a note on or with the hospital bill and/or statement regarding the hospital's Financial Assistance/Charity Care program and how the patient may apply for consideration under this program. 6. Financial Counselors. Each Presence Health hospital has one or more financial counselor whose contact information is listed or provided with other information concerning the Financial Assistance/Charity Care discount program. These counselors are available to discuss eligibility and other questions concerning the program, and provide assistance with applications. They are also available to meet with patients during their stay if they have questions about their ability to pay for services and our financial assistance programs. 7. Notification of Determination. When a Presence Health hospital makes a determination that a patient's bill is discounted or adjusted based on a determination of financial need, the hospital notifies the patient of such eligibility determination and that there is no further collection action taken on the discounted portion of the patient's bill."
201403219349306015,362167800,"PART VI, 4: COMMUNITY INFORMATION","Presence Health provides services at 150 sites, including twelve acute care hospitals with a total of 2,997 staffed beds and over 90 primary and specialty care clinicS. These ministries offer a broad range of services from highly specialized tertiary services to an extended network of primary and ambulatory care. Presence Health has identified a separate service area for each of its acute care hospitals utilizing a consistent methodology and reflecting a combination of geographic location and market share criteria. The total service area of each ministry represents approximately 80% to 90% of the total inpatient discharges from that facility. The primary service area (the ""Primary Service Area"") of each facility represents approximately 65% to 75% of such discharges and the secondary service area (the ""Secondary Service Area"") of each facility represents approximately 15% to 25% of such discharges. The Primary Service Areas and Secondary Service Areas have been determined by utilizing a patient origin analysis to identify those zip codes that represent inpatient discharges. These zip codes are then mapped to identify geographic coverage of the Primary Service Areas and Secondary Service Areas. Many of the Presence Health hospital ministries facilities are located in population growth areas. Based upon population estimates and projections obtained from Claritas, Inc., the population of our hospitals' combined service area is expected to grow at a rate of 1.9% annually between 2012 and 2017, compared with a growth rate of 1.3% and 1.6% per year in the Chicago MSA and in Illinois, respectively. Of Presence's total service area population, 10.7% is over the age of 65, compared to 11.1% and 12.3% in the Chicago MSA and in Illinois, respectively. The Presence Saint Francis Hospital CHNA service area includes Evanston (60201, 60202, and 60203), Rogers Park (60626), and West Ridge (60645). The total population of zip codes 60201, 60202, 60203, 60626 and 60645 in 2010 was 201,419, making up the service area of PSFH. Demographics While the U.S. and Illinois population increased 10% and 3% respectively, the city of Chicago lost 7% of its population from 2000 to 2010. Similarly, Rogers Park lost 13% of its population during this time period. The population in Evanston and West Ridge remained relatively unchanged. Evanston (74,486) and West Ridge (71,942) have about the same size population, while Rogers Park has about 20,000 fewer residents than the other two communities. About a quarter of the population in all these communities is under 20 years of age, percentages that are quite similar to Chicago, Cook County, Illinois and the U.S. Between 8% (in zip code 60626-Rogers Park) and 12% (in Evanston) of the population are over 65. The largest racial group in Evanston is White (over 60%) with about 20% of the population identifying as Black and about 8% Hispanic/Latino. In West Ridge, the Asian and Hispanic/Latino population combined is slightly larger (44%) than the White population (40%). In Rogers Park both the Black and Hispanic/Latino populations each comprise about 25% of the total while the White proportion is near 40%. One in five of the residents in West Ridge are limited English speakers, compared to about 15% in Rogers Park and just over 5% in Evanston. While Spanish is the most common language spoken in all areas, West Ridge stands out for the diversity of languages spoken. Socioeconomic While the median income for West Ridge, at $47,323, is similar to Chicago as a whole, the median income for Rogers Park is considerably lower, at $39,482. The median income for Evanston is almost $20,000 more than for Chicago, at $68,107. As might be expected, only 10% of Evanston residents and 10% or less of Evanston children live below the poverty line. Fifteen percent of the residents and almost 25% of children in West Ridge live in poverty. In Rogers Park, 23% of residents and 37% of the children are living in poverty. Nearly half of Rogers Park residents are living below 200% of the FPL. Seventy percent or more of students receive free or reduced lunch in all schools in Rogers Park. Most schools in Evanston have 50% or less of students receiving free or reduced lunch, though there are higher rates in south Evanston. Only 6% of residents in Evanston lack a high school degree, compared with 18%-20% in Rogers Park and West Ridge. Almost two-thirds of Evanston residents over 25 have a college degree, compared to only one-third of Chicago residents. For the period 2006-2010, West Ridge had the highest unemployment rate at 7.9% followed by Rogers Park at 7.5% and Evanston at 6.8%. Access to Care The percentage of people uninsured in Chicago (19.8%) is higher than the national and state averages; the uninsured rate in Evanston (8.3%) is more than 10 percentage points lower than Chicago. About 30% of residents in the West Ridge and Rogers Park zip codes are enrolled in Medicaid. While the rates of self-pay among ER outpatients at PSFH were similar to the state (18% and 15% respectively), 45% of outpatients at PSFH were on Medicaid, compared to only 34% statewide. There were 3,839 requests for interpreters at PSFH in FY2011. Over half of the requests were for Spanish, which was the most common language spoken in these communities, followed by Russian. There were requests for a wide variety of language interpretation, with 60 different languages requested over the year. There are no primary care shortages in Evanston. However, Rogers Park has a shortage for all residents and West Ridge has a shortage for low-income residents. There is no shortage of mental health services in Evanston. However, like most of North Chicago, West Ridge and Rogers Park both have mental health shortages for low-income residents. A full Community Health Profile of demographic and other health indicators can be found of Presence Saint Francis Hospital at www.presencehealth.org/community."

201403219349306015,362167800,"PART VI, 6: AFFILIATED HEALTH CARE SYSTEM","The Provena Health and Resurrection Health Care systems came together on November 1, 2011 to form a new health system, Presence Health, creating a comprehensive family of not-for-profit health care services and the single largest Catholic health system in Illinois. The name Presence Health embodies the act of being present in every moment we share with those we serve and is the cornerstone of a patient, resident and family-centered care environment. ""Presence"" Health embodies the way we choose to be present in our communities, as well as with one another and those we serve. Presence Health is sponsored by five congregations of Catholic religious women: the Franciscan Sisters of the Sacred Heart, the Servants of the Holy Heart of Mary, the Sisters of the Holy Family of Nazareth, Sisters of Mercy of the Americas and the Sisters of the Resurrection. As was the case from our very beginnings, Presence Health is called to be much more than just a provider of health services. Presence Health has instilled within all of its ministries that are committed to responding to the needs of those we are privileged to serve; delivering high quality care that is accessible to all. It is this culture of caring and giving that drives our diligent efforts to ensure we return the optimal value of our charitable assets to our local communities. As a not-for-profit health system, Presence Health invests its net gains from operations into the community through programs to serve vulnerable populations, such as the poor and uninsured, manage chronic conditions, and promote health education and promotion outreach and initiatives. In fiscal year 2013, this included $199 million in community benefit activities. Presence Health takes a systems approach to its community benefit efforts, and therefore ensures its member hospitals and other entities and affiliates are helping to promote and address the health needs of the communities they serve.

Consistent with the charitable health care mission of Ellis Hospital, Ellis provides care for all patients covered by Medicare who seek medical care. Such care is provided regardless of whether the reimbursement provided for such services meets or exceeds the cost incurred by Ellis to provide such services. As a result, Ellis views any shortfall reported in Line 7 as an additional community benefit provided by the organization."

All patients eligible for charity care must submit an application which is then reviewed by Ellis to verify charity care eligibility. Without a submitted application, charity care is not approved and patients are subject to routine collection efforts as outlined in Ellis' collection policies. However, once approved for charity care, patients balances are eliminated and no collection efforts take place."
201423189349303312,141338428,Part VI - Needs Assessment,"On November 5, 2013, the Board of Trustees of Ellis Hospital adopted by Resolution a Community Health Needs Assessment and associated Implementation Strategy, the latter in the form of a grid. The document is being made widely available on the Ellis Medicine website http://www.ellismedicine.org/pages/community-report.aspx and as a paper copy for public inspection at the administrative office of Ellis Hospital (1101 Nott Street, Schenectady, New York 12308) as of November 15, 2013.Development of this assessment and plan has been a unique undertaking for the Schenectady healthcare and human services community. The document, a consolidated, multi-year, multi-agency, community-wide plan for action to improve the health of people in Schenectady, New York is the result of the combined efforts of 62 organizations. The Schenectady Coalition for a Healthy Community, informed by multiple credible data sources including a door-to-door survey of community residents, developed this assessment and plan to serve the people of the City and County of Schenectady.Three of the top priorities identified in Schenectady are consistent with the three Prevention Agenda priorities of the other Capital Region counties; Albany and Rensselaer. This consistency will enable consideration of a Region-wide approach to implementation strategies.Central to this assessment and plan, the UMatter Schenectady survey consisted of more than 280 questions and was administered to over 2,000 residents of the City of Schenectady between February and May 2013 by Community Health Workers and volunteer college students. In addition to the survey results, this plan was informed by secondary data from such sources as the U.S. Census and the New York State Department of Health, and from specialized data sources including a recent federally-funded study of diabetes in Schenectadys West Indian population.All told, between November 2012 and October 2013 the Coalition held 28 meetings of healthcare experts, representatives of community interests, and community residents; utilizing government-recommended group-voting techniques to compile a list of 20 significant community health needs, and to prioritize five of these as most requiring community-wide corrective action over the next three years."
201423189349303312,141338428,Part VI - Patient Education of Eligibility for Assistance,"Ellis Medicine provides financial assistance information about programs available to assist patients in paying for their bills, including discount programs and charity care, on its external website (www.ellismedicine.org) (specifically at http://www.ellismedicine.org/financial-assistance/faqs.aspx), in readily available and publicly distributed brochures, and through flyers and posters visible throughout the organization. Applications for financial assistance are available online at the Ellis website. Additionally, Ellis employs Financial Advocates who assist patients in determining the availability of and their eligibility for free or low-cost care, and then assist them with completing the necessary paperwork. Since 2009, Ellis Medicine has included affirmative financial assistance outreach as part of the innovative Medical Home through which it aims to increase access to care and provide healthcare navigation services to patients (especially the underserved and uninsured / underinsured), including education about and assistance with charity care and financial assistance services. Prior to creation of the health insurance enrollment programs by the Patient Protection and Affordable Care Act of 2010 (PPACA), Ellis offered Medicaid enrollment through employees deputized by the Schenectady County Department of Social Services, through Facilitated Enrollers employed by the not-for-profit Health Capital District Initiative (HCDI), and through Fidelis, one of New Yorks not-for-profit Medicaid Managed Care Organizations. Starting in 2013, Ellis arranged for on-site services of Health Insurance Navigators engaged by all four not-for-profit organizations designated pursuant to the PPACA. Navigators saw uninsured residents at both the Nott Street and Ellis Health Center Campuses. Ellis employees also completed training as Certified Application Counselors (CACs) and are qualified to help people enroll both in Medicaid as well as in Exchange insurance products.Additionally, Ellis publicizes its Financial Call Center & Information Line (sharing with our 3,300 employees; our local, state and federal lawmakers offices in case they receive constituent inquiries related to hospital costs and/or financial services at Ellis; and the general public), highlighting a number to call (518-243-1695) through which patients can receive information about how much their care will cost at Ellis Medicine as a way to be transparent and helpful in providing this information, as more and more patients are paying higher deductibles and are concerned about the cost to them out-of-pocket. This is particularly significant in Ellis Primary Service Area, as the largest local employer has converted to a high-deductible health insurance plan for most of its employees.Ellis has also participated in health fairs and employer information functions to advise small businesses and their employees of Ellis Financial Call Center & Information Line. Ellis Call Center has trained specialists who can help enroll qualifying patients in Financial Assistance programs, estimate a patients out-of-pocket expenses based on their medical plan, provide pricing for procedures and tests at Ellis Medicine and assist patients in completing Medicaid applications when applicable. Ellis Information Line helps with physician referrals, scheduling outpatient testing and providing general information about programs and services at Ellis Medicine."
201423189349303312,141338428,Part VI - Community Information,"In accordance with industry standards, Ellis Hospitals community is defined as the hospitals Primary and Secondary Service Areas, accounting for 80% of the hospitals discharge volume. These include all or portions of Schenectady, Saratoga, Albany, Fulton, and Montgomery counties and are comprised of 22 zip codes. Since the State-mandated consolidation of Schenectadys hospitals, Ellis has become the sole provider of acute hospital care in Schenectady County, and it is the largest hospital within its Service Areas.The Primary Service Area is focused on the City of Schenectady, an older industrial city with a population of about 60,000, a substantial decline from the 1940 high of over 90,000. According to the City of Schenectadys 2010-2014 Consolidated Plan, 67% of households in the city are considered low or moderate income, while the poverty rate in the Hamilton Hill neighborhood, adjacent to Ellis Hospital, is over 28%. Nearly all (95%) of the Citys housing stock was built before 1978, and Schenectady neighborhoods have been identified as having among the highest concentration of elevated blood levels for lead in New York State.An impact of the level of poverty in the City of Schenectady has been the extent to which Ellis patients are either covered by government health programs or are uninsured. During 2013, Medicare patients accounted for 40.8% of inpatient discharges, 30.1% of outpatient visits, and 35.5% of net patient revenues before bad debts. Medicaid covered 21.0% of inpatient discharges, 27.4% of outpatient visits, and 16.3% of net patient revenues before bad debts. Uninsured patients accounted for 3.8% of inpatient discharges and 5.6% of outpatient visits, and 1.7% of net patient revenues before bad debts. Overall, uninsured or government insured patients made up 65.6% of inpatient discharges and 63.1% of outpatient visits, while generating 53.5% of net patient revenues before bad debts.There is one Medically Underserved Population (MUP) within Ellis Primary Service Area. The homebound population of Schenectady County is designated MUP 06211. In response, physicians on the staff of the Ellis Family Health Center make house calls, and residents in the hospitals Family Medicine Residency may include house calls in their training. During 2013, two Health Professions Shortage Areas (HPSA) were re-designated in the City of Schenectady: the entire City is now identified as an HPSA for Dental and Mental Health services. The Primary Care HPSAs remain limited to a small number of Census Tracts in the Hamilton Hill/Mont Pleasant neighborhoods.The Secondary Service Area is a much wider geographic area, including rural and farming communities, as well as affluent suburbs. Overall, the combined Service Areas represent a study in contrasts. A nearly equal number of people have incomes below $25,000 as above $100,000. Health status variations are similarly dramatic. For example, according to the New York State Department of Health the rates of asthma-related hospital admissions per 10,000 people vary from 458 in the 12307 ZIP code to 49 in the 12309 ZIP code, a distance of about five miles.Census data for the combined Primary and Secondary Service Areas for 2013 estimate a total population of 377,974. This is projected to increase to 380,182 by 2018. The 2013 median income was $62,648 while the mean income was $73,485, demonstrating the impact of outliers. The gender distribution is 49% male and 51% female. Twenty-one percent of the population has a bachelors degree or higher. There will, however, likely be increased need for healthcare services as the community ages. The greatest increase in population from 2013 to 2018 is expected to be in the 65 and over age range (2.08%), while the greatest decrease is expected in the 35-54 age range (2.43%)."
201423189349303312,141338428,Part VI - Community Building Activities,"Ellis Medicine (the trade name for Ellis Hospital) successfully restructured healthcare services following the New York State-mandated hospital consolidation in Schenectady in 2007-2008, and has since been working to improve the efficiency and effectiveness of services to its community by aligning its innovative approaches to community health with the services provided by other local community-based public and not-for-profit organizations. Ellis is now the sole acute care hospital in Schenectady County, and is one of the largest primary care providers, having assumed responsibility for the services of two former hospitals which closed during the States rightsizing process. In this important role, Ellis has engaged the community and developed coalitions with community partners in order to ensure access to a full range of healthcare services, with special attention paid to disadvantaged members of our community. Ellis has undertaken and is planning a number of significant capital projects to consolidate care, enhance access to care, and improve the overall quality, efficiency, and cost-effectiveness of our local healthcare system. One of Ellis Medicines key community building activities is Care Central, a community-focused, multi-partner, care management program derived from Ellis original Medical Home initiative, which is a central location for primary care and outpatient services on a single campus aimed at improving access to healthcare, especially among the uninsured and underinsured. The Ellis Medical Home offers primary care (adult and pediatric), dental care, outpatient child/adolescent mental health services, diabetes education, and emergency services along with a number of outpatient services such as medical imaging, laboratory, a sleep disorders center, wound care, and day surgery. The Medical Home features specially trained Health Services Navigators, one an Ellis employee and the other contracted from Schenectady County Public Health Services, and a Community Services Navigator, a counselor employed by the local community action agency, who help patients connect to the healthcare and social services programs they need, including Medicaid facilitated enrollment services, and a free Community Shuttle which provides transportation from a number of community sites including homeless shelters and soup kitchens to the healthcare campus. The Medical Home is an effective partnership among Ellis Medicine and numerous community groups, including the Schenectady Community Action Program, the Salvation Army, the City Mission, YWCA, YMCA, Schenectady City School District, and Schenectady County Public Health Services, among other social service and community agencies.The success of the Medical Home in building community coalitions helped lead to a successful application by a community partnership for designation by the New York State Department of Health as one of the first three upstate Medicaid Health Homes. The Health Home program, which was established by the Patient Protection and Affordable Care Act (PPACA) of 2010 and conforming State law, is intended to provide a comprehensive array of healthcare and community support services to Medicaid patients with designated high-cost conditions. New York State has chosen to initially focus on patients with multiple chronic conditions, behavioral health issues, and/or HIV/AIDS. A coalition of over 40 healthcare and community agencies led by Ellis, the Visiting Nurse Service of Schenectady and Saratoga Counties, Inc., and Hometown Health (the Schenectady FQHC) now provides comprehensive care management services to high risk Medicaid patients in Schenectady County.A third component of Care Central is a Medicare Community-based Care Transitions Program (CCTP) which serves patients discharged from ten different hospitals in a ten-county region. Ellis is the largest participating hospital.Another example of Ellis coalition building activities is its participation in the Schenectady County Public Health Services federally funded Strategic Alliance for Health (SAH), which brings together a host of healthcare and community organizations to address chronic disease and to promote disease prevention and wellness. An Ellis representative participates in regular meetings of the SAH board. Ellis also works closely with the Schenectady County Public Health Services and the Healthy Capital District Initiative (HCDI) to assess community needs and to develop both the federally-required Community Health Needs Assessment and the State-required Community Service Plan (CSP) to identify health priorities (see Part V).Additionally, Ellis partners with a number of community partners, such as the American Cancer Society and the YWCA, to provide health screenings to uninsured and underinsured populations in our service area. Ellis provides office space and other in-kind support for the State-sponsored Schenectady County Cancer Services Program. In collaboration with community partners, Ellis offers outpatient smoking cessation courses and sponsors peer-driven mental health and cancer patient support groups. And, Ellis cooperates with community groups to facilitate access to healthy foods for people through the community. In past years, acting in collaboration with the Schenectady County Planning Department and the Cooperative Extension, Ellis hosted a weekly Farmers Market in the parking lot of the Ellis Health Center during the summer months. Starting in 2013, physicians at the Family Health Center began prescribing fresh vegetables to at-risk patients as part of a foundation-funded grant program. The prescription constitutes a voucher for no-charge locally-grown vegetables which are distributed at a farm stand located at the Ellis Health Center.Medical residents from the Ellis Family Medicine Residency donate their time and expertise to staff two free community-based medical clinics. A weekly clinic at the Schenectady City Mission serves uninsured, homeless individuals in the City of Schenectady. And a rural seasonal clinic provides care to uninsured migrant workers in collaboration with the Columbia County Department of Health.Ellis staffs a Green Team that works to promote recycling and other eco-friendly practices throughout the organization. Ellis staff members also sit on numerous community boards and healthcare coalitions to target improvements in such areas as diabetes, long term care, cancer, hospital readmission rates, and healthy living."
201423189349303312,141338428,Part VI - Explanation Of How Organization Furthers Its Exempt Purpose,"Ellis Medicine furthers its exempt purpose by promoting the health of the community through:A volunteer Board of Trustees that is comprised of community members, medical staff members and hospital administrators who serve three year terms, up to a three term maximum. Currently, the Ellis Board is comprised of 23 trustees 18 non-physician citizens of the community, four physicians, and one senior hospital administrator (the hospitals President and CEO). Ellis does not have a parent corporation.An open medical staff consisting of approximately 595 affiliated physicians and other providers. Medical privileges at Ellis Hospital are available to all qualified physicians in the area. Approximately 230 physicians and other providers are employed by Ellis, including 30 residents participating in the Family Medicine Residency and three in the General Dental Residency. Ellis medical staff is led by a Medical-Dental Executive Committee (MDEC). The MDEC plays an integral part in the hospitals corporate structure and daily operations. The MDEC and the department chairs, who oversee specific clinical services, work collaboratively with the hospitals volunteer Board of Trustees, administrators, and staff to ensure the highest quality of care is delivered to patients and that the community's healthcare needs are met with excellence. Physicians also serve as members of the hospitals Board of Trustees, and they are directly involved in the hospitals annual budget process: they rank and prioritize all capital items in the hospitals capital budget and they sign off on volume projections for the hospitals annual operating budget.Operation of two, full service, fully staffed emergency rooms on two separate Schenectady campuses, both of which are open 24 hours-a-day, seven days-a-week, 365 days-a-year, along with 24/7 emergent care services now available for the first time in Southern Saratoga County. Ellis emergency rooms care for all those in need of emergency care regardless of their ability to pay. Similarly, Ellis Hospitals admission policy is not restrictive. Ellis does not deny admission to any patient based on his/her ability to pay. The work of The Foundation for Ellis Medicine, a 501 (c) (3) tax-exempt charitable organization whose sole purpose is to encourage philanthropic support for Ellis Hospital. The Ellis Hospital Foundation was established in 1982 and is governed by a separate board of trustees. Funds raised through the Foundations activities are used to assist the hospital in acquiring state-of-the-art medical equipment and support a wide range of health care programs and services. Reinvesting its surplus funds to expand/replace/modernize its facilities and medical equipment; support programs/activities aimed at improving quality of care and patient safety; train and educate its medical and nursing staffs; and to improve the overall delivery of and accessibility to health care services in the community.Ellis Medicine demonstrates leadership as a charitable institution by organizing and participating in communitywide efforts for the needy; reaching out to the underserved to provide needed primary and preventative healthcare services and health education, especially through its Medical Home; attracting and using funds to serve the needy; participating in Medicaid and other federal, state, and local healthcare reimbursement programs for the needy such as Child Health Plus; and formally planning for and providing charity care and maintaining a policy of administering care to all persons in need.Ellis Medicine is accountable to the community by having a volunteer governing board comprised of members of the Schenectady community; inviting and responding to community input and involvement in planning and review of hospital activities; voluntarily disclosing information to the public on hospital services, financial status, community benefit activities and charity care; and advocating for healthcare cost containment and promoting the efficient use of healthcare resources within the community."

THIS COLLABORATIVE GROUP MET FROM THE FALL OF 2008 THROUGH AUGUST OF 2009, AND SELECTED TOBACCO USE AND UNINTENTIONAL INJURY AS THE TWO HEALTH PRIORITIES IDENTIFIED IN THE NEW YORK STATE PREVENTION AGENDA TOWARD THE HEALTHIEST STATE.SMOKING CESSATION WAS SELECTED BECAUSE THE USE OF TOBACCO IS THE NUMBER ONE UNDERLYING RISK FACTOR FOR MULTIPLE DISEASES. MOREOVER, NASSAU AND SUFFOLK COUNTIES SUFFER FROM SOME OF THE HIGHEST MORTALITY RATES FROM HEART DISEASE IN NEW YORK STATE. UNINTENTIONAL INJURIES WAS SELECTED AS A PRIORITY GIVEN THE FACT THAT SUFFOLK COUNTY HAS A RELATIVELY HIGH MORTALITY RATE FOR UNINTENTIONAL INJURIES WHEN COMPARED TO NEW YORK STATE AND NATIONALLY. THE GROUP ALSO AGREED THAT GIVEN THE SHORTAGE OF RESOURCES AVAILABLE TO ADVANCE PUBLIC HEALTH AGENDAS, IT WAS IMPORTANT TO SELECT PRIORITIES THAT COULD BUILD ON PROGRAMS THAT ARE ALREADY IN PLACE.BOTH SMOKING CESSATION AND PROGRAMS TO REDUCE UNINTENTIONAL INJURIES ACCOMPLISH THIS GOAL. ONE OF THE PRIORITY INITIATIVES FOR THE SUFFOLK COUNTY OFFICE OF HEALTH EDUCATION IS TO DEVELOP AND IMPLEMENT EFFECTIVE ANTI-SMOKING PROGRAMS THAT WILL REDUCE THE RATE OF TOBACCO USE IN SCHOOL-AGED CHILDREN. IN ADDITION, MANY OF THE HOSPITALS IN SUFFOLK COUNTY, INCLUDING PECONIC BAY MEDICAL CENTER HAVE PROGRAMS AND SUPPORT GROUPS IN PLACE TO WORK WITH THEIR EMPLOYEES AND COMMUNITY BASED ORGANIZATIONS TO REDUCE SMOKING. COMMUNITY BASED PROGRAMS AUGMENT COUNTY AND HOSPITAL EFFORTS IN REDUCING TOBACCO USE. THE TOBACCO ACTION COALITION AND HEALTHY MOTHERS/HEALTHY BABY COALITION WILL BE SOUGHT OUT TO ENGAGE IN COLLABORATIVE EFFORTS AS WELL.THERE ARE ALSO A NUMBER OF EXISTING PROGRAMS IN SUFFOLK COUNTY THAT HAVE DEVELOPED STRATEGIES FOR REDUCING THE INCIDENCE OF UNINTENTIONAL INJURIES. THE COUNTY'S BUREAU OF PUBLIC HEALTH NURSING PROVIDES HOME HEALTH CARE SERVICES FOR PATIENTS SUFFERING THE SEQUELAE OF UNINTENTIONAL INJURIES. THE COUNTY ALSO PROVIDES EDUCATION AND SUPPORT TO MOTHERS AND CHILDREN AIMED AT PREVENTING INJURIES FROM BURNS. A PARTNERSHIP BETWEEN ST.

AS SUCH, THESE FEES WERE ADJUSTED ACCORDINGLY IN LINE 7 AS WELL AS THE TOTAL OPERATING EXPENSE. PART I, LINE 7 The Hospital used the following methodologies to calculate the amounts reported for each line on Schedule H, Line 7: (1)Line 7a ""financial assistance at cost"" - utilized gross charges written off reflected in the 2013 Medicare Cost Report and reduced to cost by applying the ratio of patient care cost-to-charges. The patient cost to charge ratio is calculated in worksheet 2 with information from the 2013 Medicare Cost Report and HSS's 2013 general ledger trial balance. This cost was offset by the New York State uncompensated care pool revenue. (2)Line 7b ""unreimbursed Medicaid"" - utilized charges from the decision support accounting system and reduced to cost by applying the ratio of patient care cost-to charges. (3)Line 7e ""community health improvement services"" - the Hospital applied actual expenses to derive the cost. (4)Line 7f ""health profession education"" - the medical education cost was obtained from the 2013 Medicare Cost Report for direct and indirect expense. The cost was offset by Medicare and Medicaid Revenue related to Direct GME as well as other direct offsetting revenue related to ""Health Profession Education"". (5)Line 7h ""research"" - the 2013 Medicare Cost Report was utilized."

THE METHODOLOGY UTILIZED TO ESTIMATE THE PORTION OF BAD DEBT AS COMMUNITY BENEFIT WAS BASED ON ONE MONTH'S SAMPLE OF INPATIENT AND OUTPATIENT ACCOUNTS THAT HAD BEEN PLACED INTO EXTERNAL COLLECTIONS. ADDITIONALLY, AN OUTSIDE PARTY'S ELIGIBILITY SYSTEM WAS UTILIZED TO ESTIMATE PATIENT'S INCOME. THE PATIENT'S INCOME WAS COMPARED TO HSS FINANCIAL ASSISTANCE'S ""SLIDING SCALE"" TO DETERMINE IF THE PATIENT WOULD HAVE BEEN QUALIFIED FOR A DISCOUNT HAD THEY APPLIED FOR FINANCIAL ASSISTANCE. FAMILY SIZE WAS ASSUMED USING THE PATIENT'S MARITAL STATUS AND AGE. 81% OF INPATIENTS ACCOUNTS AND 75% OF OUTPATIENT ACCOUNTS WOULD HAVE QUALIFIED FOR DISCOUNTS. THUS BASED ON THE METHODOLOGY IT IS REASONABLE TO ASSERT THAT THIS PORTION OF BAD DEBT BE CONSIDERED A COMMUNITY BENEFIT. THE UNCOMPENSATED CARE TEXT OF THE FOOTNOTE TO THE ORGANIZATION'S FINANCIAL STATEMENT STATES, ""AS A MATTER OF POLICY, THE HOSPITAL PROVIDES SIGNIFICANT AMOUNTS OF PARTIALLY OR TOTALLY UNCOMPENSATED PATIENT CARE. FOR ACCOUNTING PURPOSES, SUCH UNCOMPENSATED CARE IS TREATED EITHER AS CHARITY CARE UNDER THE HOSPITAL'S FINANCIAL ASSISTANCE POLICY OR AS BAD DEBT EXPENSE. THE HOSPITAL'S FINANCIAL ASSISTANCE POLICY ENSURES THE PROVISION OF QUALITY HEALTH CARE TO THE COMMUNITY SERVED WHILE CAREFULLY CONSIDERING AND TAKING INTO ACCOUNT THE ABILITY OF THE PATIENT TO PAY. THE HOSPITAL'S FINANCIAL ASSISTANCE PROGRAM'S ELIGIBILITY THRESHOLD IS 500% OF THE FEDERAL POVERTY GUIDELINES, WHICH IS IN EXCESS OF THE NEW YORK STATE MINIMUM REQUIREMENTS OF 300%. THE HOSPITAL HAS DEFINED CHARITY CARE FOR ACCOUNTING AND DISCLOSURE PURPOSES AS THE DIFFERENCE BETWEEN ITS CUSTOMARY CHARGES AND THE DISCOUNTED RATES GIVEN TO PATIENTS IN NEED OF FINANCIAL ASSISTANCE. AS THE COLLECTION OF AMOUNTS DETERMINED TO QUALIFY AS CHARITY IS NOT PURSUED, SUCH AMOUNTS ARE NOT REPORTED AS REVENUE. PATIENTS WHO DO NOT QUALIFY FOR DISCOUNTED FEES ARE BILLED AT THE HOSPITAL'S ESTABLISHED CHARGES. UNCOLLECTED BALANCES FOR THESE PATIENTS ARE CATEGORIZED AS BAD DEBTS.

201403219349303590,221494442,"SCHEDULE H, PART III, SECTION B; QUESTION 8","MEDICARE COSTS WERE DERIVED FROM THE 2013 MEDICARE COST REPORT. MEDICARE UNDERPAYMENTS AND BAD DEBT ARE COMMUNITY BENEFIT AND ASSOCIATED COSTS ARE INCLUDABLE ON THE FORM 990, SCHEDULE H, PART I. THE ORGANIZATION FEELS THAT MEDICARE UNDERPAYMENTS (SHORTFALL) AND BAD DEBT ARE COMMUNITY BENEFIT AND ASSOCIATED COSTS ARE INCLUDABLE ON THE FORM 990, SCHEDULE H, PART I. AS OUTLINED MORE FULLY BELOW THE ORGANIZATION BELIEVES THAT THESE SERVICES AND RELATED COSTS PROMOTE THE HEALTH OF THE COMMUNITY AS A WHOLE AND ARE RENDERED IN CONJUNCTION WITH THE ORGANIZATION'S CHARITABLE TAX-EXEMPT PURPOSES AND MISSION IN PROVIDING MEDICALLY NECESSARY HEALTHCARE SERVICES TO ALL INDIVIDUAL'S IN A NON-DISCRIMINATORY MANNER WITHOUT REGARD TO RACE, COLOR, CREED, SEX, NATIONAL ORIGIN, RELIGION OR ABILITY TO PAY AND CONSISTENT WITH THE COMMUNITY BENEFIT STANDARD PROMULGATED BY THE IRS. THE COMMUNITY BENEFIT STANDARD IS THE CURRENT STANDARD FOR A HOSPITAL FOR RECOGNITION AS A TAX-EXEMPT AND CHARITABLE ORGANIZATION UNDER INTERNAL REVENUE CODE (""IRC"") 501(C)(3). THE ORGANIZATION IS RECOGNIZED AS A TAX-EXEMPT ENTITY AND CHARITABLE ORGANIZATION UNDER 501(C)(3) OF THE IRC. ALTHOUGH THERE IS NO DEFINITION IN THE TAX CODE FOR THE TERM ""CHARITABLE"" A REGULATION PROMULGATED BY THE DEPARTMENT OF THE TREASURY PROVIDES SOME GUIDANCE AND STATES THAT ""[T]HE TERM CHARITABLE IS USED IN SECTION 501(C)(3) IN ITS GENERALLY ACCEPTED LEGAL SENSE,"" AND PROVIDES EXAMPLES OF CHARITABLE PURPOSES, INCLUDING THE RELIEF OF THE POOR OR UNPRIVILEGED; THE PROMOTION OF SOCIAL WELFARE; AND THE ADVANCEMENT OF EDUCATION, RELIGION, AND SCIENCE. NOTE IT DOES NOT EXPLICITLY ADDRESS THE ACTIVITIES OF HOSPITALS. IN THE ABSENCE OF EXPLICIT STATUTORY OR REGULATORY REQUIREMENTS APPLYING THE TERM ""CHARITABLE"" TO HOSPITALS, IT HAS BEEN LEFT TO THE IRS TO DETERMINE THE CRITERIA HOSPITALS MUST MEET TO QUALIFY AS IRC 501(C)(3) CHARITABLE ORGANIZATIONS. THE ORIGINAL STANDARD WAS KNOWN AS THE CHARITY CARE STANDARD. THIS STANDARD WAS REPLACED BY THE IRS WITH THE COMMUNITY BENEFIT STANDARD WHICH IS THE CURRENT STANDARD. CHARITY CARE STANDARD IN 1956, THE IRS ISSUED REVENUE RULING 56-185, WHICH ADDRESSED THE REQUIREMENTS HOSPITALS NEEDED TO MEET IN ORDER TO QUALIFY FOR IRC 501(C)(3) STATUS. ONE OF THESE REQUIREMENTS IS KNOWN AS THE ""CHARITY CARE STANDARD."" UNDER THE STANDARD, A HOSPITAL HAD TO PROVIDE, TO THE EXTENT OF ITS FINANCIAL ABILITY, FREE OR REDUCED-COST CARE TO PATIENTS UNABLE TO PAY FOR IT. A HOSPITAL THAT EXPECTED FULL PAYMENT DID NOT, ACCORDING TO THE RULING, PROVIDE CHARITY CARE BASED ON THE FACT THAT SOME PATIENTS ULTIMATELY FAILED TO PAY. THE RULING EMPHASIZED THAT A LOW LEVEL OF CHARITY CARE DID NOT NECESSARILY MEAN THAT A HOSPITAL HAD FAILED TO MEET THE REQUIREMENT SINCE THAT LEVEL COULD REFLECT ITS FINANCIAL ABILITY TO PROVIDE SUCH CARE. THE RULING ALSO NOTED THAT PUBLICLY SUPPORTED COMMUNITY HOSPITALS WOULD NORMALLY QUALIFY AS CHARITABLE ORGANIZATIONS BECAUSE THEY SERVE THE ENTIRE COMMUNITY, AND A LOW LEVEL OF CHARITY CARE WOULD NOT AFFECT A HOSPITAL'S EXEMPT STATUS IF IT WAS DUE TO THE SURROUNDING COMMUNITY'S LACK OF CHARITABLE DEMANDS. COMMUNITY BENEFIT STANDARD IN 1969, THE IRS ISSUED REVENUE RULING 69-545, WHICH ""REMOVE[D]"" FROM REVENUE RULING 56-185 ""THE REQUIREMENTS RELATING TO CARING FOR PATIENTS WITHOUT CHARGE OR AT RATES BELOW COST."" UNDER THE STANDARD DEVELOPED IN REVENUE RULING 69-545, WHICH IS KNOWN AS THE ""COMMUNITY BENEFIT STANDARD,"" HOSPITALS ARE JUDGED ON WHETHER THEY PROMOTE THE HEALTH OF A BROAD CLASS OF INDIVIDUALS IN THE COMMUNITY. THE RULING INVOLVED A HOSPITAL THAT ONLY ADMITTED INDIVIDUALS WHO COULD PAY FOR THE SERVICES (BY THEMSELVES, PRIVATE INSURANCE, OR PUBLIC PROGRAMS SUCH AS MEDICARE), BUT OPERATED A FULL-TIME EMERGENCY ROOM THAT WAS OPEN TO EVERYONE. THE IRS RULED THAT THE HOSPITAL QUALIFIED AS A CHARITABLE ORGANIZATION BECAUSE IT PROMOTED THE HEALTH OF PEOPLE IN ITS COMMUNITY. THE IRS REASONED THAT BECAUSE THE PROMOTION OF HEALTH WAS A CHARITABLE PURPOSE ACCORDING TO THE GENERAL LAW OF CHARITY, IT FELL WITHIN THE ""GENERALLY ACCEPTED LEGAL SENSE"" OF THE TERM ""CHARITABLE,"" AS REQUIRED BY TREAS. REG. 1.501(C)(3)-1(D)(2). THE IRS RULING STATED THAT THE PROMOTION OF HEALTH, LIKE THE RELIEF OF POVERTY AND THE ADVANCEMENT OF EDUCATION AND RELIGION, IS ONE OF THE PURPOSES IN THE GENERAL LAW OF CHARITY THAT IS DEEMED BENEFICIAL TO THE COMMUNITY AS A WHOLE EVEN THOUGH THE CLASS OF BENEFICIARIES ELIGIBLE TO RECEIVE A DIRECT BENEFIT FROM ITS ACTIVITIES DOES NOT INCLUDE ALL MEMBERS OF THE COMMUNITY, SUCH AS INDIGENT MEMBERS OF THE COMMUNITY, PROVIDED THAT THE CLASS IS NOT SO SMALL THAT ITS RELIEF IS NOT OF BENEFIT TO THE COMMUNITY. THE IRS CONCLUDED THAT THE HOSPITAL WAS ""PROMOTING THE HEALTH OF A CLASS OF PERSONS THAT IS BROAD ENOUGH TO BENEFIT THE COMMUNITY"" BECAUSE ITS EMERGENCY ROOM WAS OPEN TO ALL AND IT PROVIDED CARE TO EVERYONE WHO COULD PAY, WHETHER DIRECTLY OR THROUGH THIRD-PARTY REIMBURSEMENT. OTHER CHARACTERISTICS OF THE HOSPITAL THAT THE IRS HIGHLIGHTED INCLUDED THE FOLLOWING: ITS SURPLUS FUNDS WERE USED TO IMPROVE PATIENT CARE, EXPAND HOSPITAL FACILITIES, AND ADVANCE MEDICAL TRAINING, EDUCATION, AND RESEARCH; IT WAS CONTROLLED BY A BOARD OF TRUSTEES THAT CONSISTED OF INDEPENDENT CIVIC LEADERS; AND HOSPITAL MEDICAL STAFF PRIVILEGES WERE AVAILABLE TO ALL QUALIFIED PHYSICIANS. MEDICARE UNDERPAYMENTS AND BAD DEBT ARE COMMUNITY BENEFIT AND ASSOCIATED COSTS ARE INCLUDABLE ON THE FORM 990, SCHEDULE H, PART I. THE AMERICAN HOSPITAL ASSOCIATION (""AHA"") FEELS THAT MEDICARE UNDERPAYMENTS (SHORTFALL) AND BAD DEBT ARE COMMUNITY BENEFIT AND THUS INCLUDABLE ON THE FORM 990, SCHEDULE H, PART I. THIS ORGANIZATION AGREES WITH THE AHA POSITION. AS OUTLINED IN THE AHA LETTER TO THE IRS DATED AUGUST 21, 2007 WITH RESPECT TO THE FIRST PUBLISHED DRAFT OF THE NEW FORM 990 AND SCHEDULE H, THE AHA FELT THAT THE IRS SHOULD INCORPORATE THE FULL VALUE OF THE COMMUNITY BENEFIT THAT HOSPITALS PROVIDE BY COUNTING MEDICARE UNDERPAYMENTS (SHORTFALL) AS QUANTIFIABLE COMMUNITY BENEFIT FOR THE FOLLOWING REASONS: - PROVIDING CARE FOR THE ELDERLY AND SERVING MEDICARE PATIENTS IS AN ESSENTIAL PART OF THE COMMUNITY BENEFIT STANDARD. - MEDICARE, LIKE MEDICAID, DOES NOT PAY THE FULL COST OF CARE. RECENTLY, MEDICARE REIMBURSES HOSPITALS ONLY 92 CENTS FOR EVERY DOLLAR THEY SPEND TO TAKE CARE OF MEDICARE PATIENTS. THE MEDICARE PAYMENT ADVISORY COMMISSION (""MEDPAC"") IN ITS MARCH 2007 REPORT TO CONGRESS CAUTIONED THAT UNDERPAYMENT WILL GET EVEN WORSE, WITH MARGINS REACHING A 10-YEAR LOW AT NEGATIVE 5.4 PERCENT. - MANY MEDICARE BENEFICIARIES, LIKE THEIR MEDICAID COUNTERPARTS, ARE POOR. MORE THAN 46 PERCENT OF MEDICARE SPENDING IS FOR BENEFICIARIES WHOSE INCOME IS BELOW 200 PERCENT OF THE FEDERAL POVERTY LEVEL. MANY OF THOSE MEDICARE BENEFICIARIES ARE ALSO ELIGIBLE FOR MEDICAID -- SO CALLED ""DUAL ELIGIBLES."" THERE IS EVERY COMPELLING PUBLIC POLICY REASON TO TREAT MEDICARE AND MEDICAID UNDERPAYMENTS SIMILARLY FOR PURPOSES OF A HOSPITAL'S COMMUNITY BENEFIT AND INCLUDE THESE COSTS ON FORM 990, SCHEDULE H, PART I. MEDICARE UNDERPAYMENT MUST BE SHOULDERED BY THE HOSPITAL IN ORDER TO CONTINUE TREATING THE COMMUNITY'S ELDERLY AND POOR. THESE UNDERPAYMENTS REPRESENT A REAL COST OF SERVING THE COMMUNITY AND SHOULD COUNT AS A QUANTIFIABLE COMMUNITY BENEFIT. BOTH THE AHA AND THIS ORGANIZATION ALSO FEEL THAT PATIENT BAD DEBT IS A COMMUNITY BENEFIT AND THUS INCLUDABLE ON THE FORM 990, SCHEDULE H, PART I. LIKE MEDICARE UNDERPAYMENT (SHORTFALLS), THERE ALSO ARE COMPELLING REASONS THAT PATIENT BAD DEBT SHOULD BE COUNTED AS QUANTIFIABLE COMMUNITY BENEFIT AS FOLLOWS: - A SIGNIFICANT MAJORITY OF BAD DEBT IS ATTRIBUTABLE TO LOW-INCOME PATIENTS, WHO, FOR MANY REASONS, DECLINE TO COMPLETE THE FORMS REQUIRED TO ESTABLISH ELIGIBILITY FOR HOSPITALS' CHARITY CARE OR FINANCIAL ASSISTANCE PROGRAMS. A 2006 CONGRESSIONAL BUDGET OFFICE (""CBO"") REPORT, NONPROFIT HOSPITALS AND THE PROVISION OF COMMUNITY BENEFITS, CITED TWO STUDIES INDICATING THAT ""THE GREAT MAJORITY OF BAD DEBT WAS ATTRIBUTABLE TO PATIENTS WITH INCOMES BELOW 200% OF THE FEDERAL POVERTY LINE."" - THE REPORT ALSO NOTED THAT A SUBSTANTIAL PORTION OF BAD DEBT IS PENDING CHARITY CARE. UNLIKE BAD DEBT IN OTHER INDUSTRIES, HOSPITAL BAD DEBT IS COMPLICATED BY THE FACT THAT HOSPITALS FOLLOW THEIR MISSION TO THE COMMUNITY AND TREAT EVERY PATIENT THAT COMES THROUGH THEIR EMERGENCY DEPARTMENT, REGARDLESS OF ABILITY TO PAY. PATIENTS WHO HAVE OUTSTANDING BILLS ARE NOT TURNED AWAY, UNLIKE OTHER INDUSTRIES. BAD DEBT IS FURTHER COMPLICATED BY THE AUDITING INDUSTRY'S STANDARDS ON REPORTING CHARITY CARE. MANY PATIENTS CANNOT OR DO NOT PROVIDE THE NECESSARY, EXTENSIVE DOCUMENTATION REQUIRED TO BE DEEMED CHARITY CARE BY AUDITORS. AS A RESULT, ROUGHLY 40% OF BAD DEBT IS PENDING CHARITY CARE. - THE CBO CONCLUDED THAT ITS FINDINGS ""SUPPORT THE VALIDITY OF THE USE OF UNCOMPENSATED CARE [BAD DEBT AND CHARITY CARE] AS A MEASURE OF COMMUNITY BENEFITS"" ASSUMING THE FINDINGS ARE GENERALIZABLE NATIONWIDE;"

North Shore-LIJ conducts and participates in population, demographic, and health status evaluations of our respective hospitals' service areas based on county regions and the communities we serve. There is a special effort to include individuals with health disparities and organizations who serve these communities in the CHNA process. The CHNA includes the analysis of primary and secondary data. Multi-year analyses, trends and projections are developed, which identify areas of need for the continuum of health care services. Primary data is obtained through a combination of qualitative analysis of community-based organization (CBO), informant interviews and surveys, individual community member surveys, and participation in collaborative partner meetings. These meetings include representatives from the Departments of Health, CBOs, academic institutions, government agencies, and hospitals. Ongoing input concerning our communities' needs is also obtained through: our Board of Trustees/Directors who are all area residents and leaders in their respective communities; facility based advisory boards and councils, and; the feedback received by our facility administrators and clinicians that serve on local community agency boards. Secondary data analysis includes: internal hospital data, including Prevention Quality Indicators (PQI); Department of Health Community Health Assessments; local regional NYS Prevention Agenda data sources; E-BRFSS; 2010 US Census data and Statewide Planning and Research System (SPARCS) data. The Committee on Community Health, a committee of the Board of Trustees, provides recommendations that concern North Shore-LIJ's community health priorities and interventions based on the CHNA. Committee discussions focus on New York State (NYS) Prevention Agenda Priority Areas, including strategies and intervention outcomes related to chronic disease prevention, women and children's health, healthy safe environments, health access, mental health and substance abuse, HIV/AIDS/STDs and community immunizations. Regional departments of health (I.E. Nassau County Department of Health, Suffolk County Department of Health Services, and NYC Department of Health and Mental Hygiene) perform additional community health assessments (CHA) with the input of hospital and community stakeholders. These regional partners use strategies such as community member surveys, CBO surveys, and public listening sessions to solicit information on community needs. Together with other healthcare organizations and CBOs, North Shore-LIJ participates in meetings organized by these regional departments of health academic organizations to discuss the shared responsibility of public health planning within the NYS Prevention Agenda. These meetings provide an opportunity for general discussion regarding the public health goals of the NYS Prevention Agenda and the selection of shared priorities for collaborative regional planning. The partnership among local health departments, hospitals and CBOs, enables region wide leveraging of resources, consensus on health priorities and collaboration on health promotion strategies."

The System's financial assistance policy provides a uniformly-administered system of reduced fees for the uninsured residents of our service area. The current fee schedule includes patients with household incomes up to 500% of the FPL. While the fee schedule serves as a guide, all hardship cases are evaluated on a case-by-case basis, taking into account the individual's financial and personal circumstances. All medically necessary services are covered under the financial assistance program and the public is notified of the availability of the program through: multilingual signage and educational brochures; centralized program administration accessible via phone; staff outreach, and all bills include a notice about the financial assistance program. Soft credit scoring software is used to facilitate the application process, but is not used to deny an applicant. The Healthcare Access Center (HAC), staffed by bilingual employees, assists community residents' with referrals for enrollment into government-subsidized insurance programs such as Medicaid, Child Health Plus and Family Health Plus. In addition, the HAC staff refers patients to the Medicaid Prenatal Care Program and to the Senior Navigator Program within North Shore-LIJ for assistance with Medicaid for pregnant women and Medicare enrollment for seniors."

Overall the area has shown an increase in the number of uninsured and underinsured. The other counties in the service area continue to show trends of increasing diversity, as well. By 2018, our service area population 65 and older will grow by 14.5%, while residents under 65 will decline less than 1% (Thomson Reuters, Market Planner Plus).

In keeping with its mission to improve the health and caring for the communities it serves, regardless of the ability to pay, North Shore-LIJ established the Office of Community and Public Health (OCPH) to promote health and wellness. The OCPH plays a key role in leading many of the mission-critical initiatives of the System and operates in alignment with the National Prevention Strategy and NYS Prevention Agenda. The OCPH is guided by the Committee on Community Health, a committee composed of the Board of Trustees, which is charged with identifying the overall health needs of the community and making recommendations for the population the System serves. The objectives of the Committee include: promoting a dialogue about the obligations of a large health system in addressing critical health issues of the public; reviewing information which assesses the health status of the communities served; promoting activities which have been shown to positively impact health; proposing policy recommendations to guide current programs or develop new ones; identifying opportunities to meet health care needs through improved delivery of health care; and recommending community health interventions to be provided by the System. North Shore-LIJ has established comprehensive and coordinated clinical programs that span across the enterprise. These programs not only provide a full continuum of services and seamless delivery of care, but offer community health activities, outreach and education as well; they include: Behavioral Health, Cancer, Cardiovascular Services, Dental Medicine, Emergency Medicine, Family Medicine, Hospice Care, Imaging/Radiology, Laboratory Medicine and Pathology, Medicine, Neurology, Neurosurgery, Obstetrics/Gynecology, Ophthalmology, Orthopedic Surgery, Otolaryngology, Pediatrics, Physical Medicine & Rehabilitation, Population Health, Senior Services, Surgery, Urology, and Women's Health. In 2013 North Shore-LIJ CareConnect Insurance Company, Inc. (""CareConnect"") began enrolling individuals, families, and small and large businesses in a range of commercial insurance plans. As the first fully integrated provider-owned Article 42 insurance company in New York, CareConnect offers access to inpatient and emergency care, post-acute care, thousands of affiliated community physicians, nurses, and other caregivers. The System's hospitals, programs and services support one of the largest resident and fellowship training programs in the United States. It directly sponsors approximately 120 accredited graduate medical education (GME) programs and trains more than 1,500 medical residents and fellows annually. Our hospitals and facilities collectively serve as teaching sites for more than 1,200 rotations for medical students from five medical schools."

CHILDREN WHO EXPERIENCE HIGH LEVELS OF SOCIO-ECONOMIC RISK ARE SUBSTANTIALLY MORE LIKELY THAN OTHER CHILDREN TO SUFFER NEGATIVE OUTCOMES, SUCH AS EMOTIONAL AND BEHAVIORAL PROBLEMS AND DIFFICULTIES IN SCHOOL. (THE URBAN INSTITUTE, SERIES B, #B18, 6/2000). ST. ELIZABETH HEALTH CENTER - HMHP DEVELOPED THE SAVE (SAFETY AND VIOLENCE EDUCATION) PROGRAM IN RESPONSE TO THE GROWING INCIDENCE OF INJURY AND DEATH DUE TO VIOLENCE IN THE REGION. THE GOAL OF THIS FREE PROGRAM IS TO HELP AT-RISK YOUTH LEARN THE CONSEQUENCES OF VIOLENCE AND TO TEACH THEM ALTERNATIVE WAYS TO HANDLE CONFLICT. THIS PROGRAM TARGETS YOUTH, AGES 12 AND OLDER, WHO ARE IDENTIFIED AS AT-RISK FOR COMMUNITY VIOLENCE THROUGH THE COURTS AND TRUANCY OFFICERS. IN 2013, 240 PEOPLE PARTICIPATED IN THE SAVE PROGRAM. A ROBUST ECONOMY POSITIVELY IMPACTS RESIDENTS BY INCREASING THE NUMBER OF RESIDENTS COVERED BY HEALTH INSURANCE AND IMPROVING THE CAPACITY OF THE COMMUNITY TO SUPPORT HEALTH SERVICES. HMHP SUPPORTS A ROBUST ECONOMY IN THE COMMUNITY BY SUPPORTING THE REGIONAL CHAMBER OF COMMERCE AND THE YOUNGSTOWN BUSINESS INCUBATOR.

THESE SERVICES ARE IMPORTANT TO SUPPORT THE ABILITY OF RESIDENTS TO GAIN AND RETAIN EMPLOYMENT AND THEREFORE ACCESS TO HEALTH INSURANCE AND IMPROVED ACCESS TO HEALTH SERVICES. THIS PROGRAM IS KEY TO THE ST. JOSEPH HEALTH CENTER PULMONARY REHAB PROGRAM. LEVERAGING RESOURCES WITHIN THE COMMUNITY PROVIDES MORE EFFECTIVE SOLUTIONS AND REDUCES DUPLICATION OF SERVICES. HMHP WORKS COOPERATIVELY WITH THE AREA'S HEALTH DEPARTMENTS, HOSPITALS AND THE LOCAL UNITED WAY ORGANIZATIONS TO ADDRESS ACCESS TO HEALTH CARE AND UNMET HEALTH NEEDS.

THERE ARE NINE ACUTE CARE HOSPITALS AND ONE REHABILITATION HOSPITAL IN THE COMMUNITY; SIX ARE NOT-FOR-PROFIT HOSPITALS (OHIO DEPT. OF HEALTH). THE US DEPT. OF HEALTH & HUMAN SERVICES HAS DESIGNATED THE COMMUNITIES OF MAPLE RIDGE, SEBRING, BELOIT, YOUNGSTOWN AND WARREN AS A MEDICALLY UNDERSERVED AREA OR POPULATION. THE GEOGRAPHIC AREA SERVED BY HMHP INCLUDES THE FOLLOWING ETHNIC AND CULTURAL GROUPS: WHITE, BLACK/AFRICAN AMERICAN, ASIAN, HISPANIC, LATINO (2010 CENSUS). APPROXIMATELY 4.4 PERCENT OF THE SERVICE AREA POPULATION SPEAKS ENGLISH LESS THAN ""VERY WELL."" NEARLY 16 PERCENT OF RESIDENTS ARE IN HOUSEHOLDS BELOW THE FEDERAL POVERTY GUIDELINES (2010 CENSUS). ACCORDING TO THE OHIO DEPT. OF JOBS & FAMILY SERVICES, TWENTY-TWO PERCENT OF FAMILIES IN THE AREA ARE ON MEDICAID OR OTHER ASSISTANCE. CULTURAL COMPETENCE IN HEALTH CARE DESCRIBES THE ABILITY TO PROVIDE CARE TO PATIENTS WITH DIVERSE VALUES, BELIEFS AND BEHAVIORS, INCLUDING ADJUSTING THE DELIVERY OF CARE TO MEET A PATIENT'S SOCIAL, CULTURAL AND LINGUISTIC NEEDS. IN THE COMMUNITIES SERVED BY HMHP, HEART DISEASE, CANCER AND CHRONIC LOWER RESPIRATORY DISEASE (CLRD) ARE THE MAJOR HEALTH PROBLEMS AND/OR LEADING CAUSES OF DEATH (OHIO DEPT. OF HEALTH, 2010). EACH OF THESE DISEASES IS PREVENTABLE THROUGH PROPER CARE AND MAINTAINING CONTROL OF THE ILLNESS/DISEASE AS WELL AS LEADING HEALTHIER LIVES. THE SMOKING RATE IS TWENTY-TWO PERCENT OF THE ADULT POPULATION (2008 HEALTHY OHIO COMMUNITY PROFILE). HMHP WORKS CLOSELY WITH LOCAL COMMUNITY AGENCIES AND HEALTH DEPARTMENTS TO ADDRESS THESE PROBLEMS AND MINIMIZE THE EFFECTS ON THOSE WHO SUFFER. IN 2013, HMHP HAD 35,792 ADMISSIONS, 555,667 OUTPATIENT VISITS, AND 187,438 EMERGENCY ROOM VISITS."

RESEARCH HAS CONTINUALLY SHOWN THAT WHEN THE FACTORS INFLUENCING HEALTH ARE EXPLORED, HEALTH CARE ACTUALLY PLAYS THE SMALLEST ROLE PROPORTIONATELY. A REPORT IN THE JOURNAL OF AMERICAN MEDICAL ASSOCIATION AND THE CENTER FOR DISEASE CONTROL (MCGINNIS, 1996) SUGGESTS THAT THE FACTORS IMPACTING HEALTH ARE AS FOLLOWS: LIFESTYLE AND BEHAVIORS, 50%, ENVIRONMENT (HUMAN AND NATURAL), 20%, GENETICS AND HUMAN BIOLOGY, 20%, AND HEALTH CARE, 10%. COMMUNITY BUILDING ACTIVITIES HELP TO ADDRESS THE OTHER INDICATORS OUTSIDE OF THE ROLE TRADITIONALLY PLAYED BY HEALTH-CARE ORGANIZATIONS. THESE ACTIVITIES ARE ALMOST EXCLUSIVELY DONE IN SOME FORM OF PARTNERSHIP IN WHICH THE COMMUNITY OR OTHER ORGANIZATIONS ARE BETTER SUITED TO ADDRESS. HEALTH-CARE ORGANIZATIONS GENERALLY PROVIDE TIMELY AND SPECIFIC RESOURCES TO HELP THESE ISSUES. HEALTH-CARE ORGANIZATIONS CAN BE A RICH AND VALUABLE COMMUNITY RESOURCE IN WAYS NOT TYPICALLY CONSIDERED. OFTEN THE MOST EFFECTIVE WAY TO HELP IMPACT AND IMPROVE THE COMMUNITY HEALTH STATUS IS TO SUPPORT OTHER AGENCIES AND ORGANIZATIONS IN A VARIETY OF WAYS OUTSIDE OF HEALTH SERVICES. THIS IS OFTEN DONE THROUGH CASH OR IN-KIND SERVICES TO SUPPORT OTHER NON-PROFITS, DONATIONS OF DURABLE MEDICAL EQUIPMENT AND SUPPLIES TO CERTAIN AGENCIES, OR THROUGH LEADERSHIP AND EDUCATIONAL EXPERTISE. TRINITY MEDICAL CENTER CONTRIBUTES FINANCIALLY TO A WIDE VARIETY OF COMMUNITY ORGANIZATIONS THAT ADDRESS THE BROADER NEEDS OF THE COMMUNITY. THESE DONATIONS ALLOW OTHER NON-PROFIT ORGANIZATIONS TO FULFILL THEIR MISSIONS TO IMPROVE THE WELL BEING OF THE COMMUNITY AND CONTRIBUTE TO ITS OVERALL HEALTH STATUS IN WAYS THAT MAY DIFFER FROM THE DIRECT SERVICES OF THE HOSPITAL ORGANIZATION AND MAXIMIZE THE RESOURCES THEY HAVE TO WORK WITH. TRINITY MEDICAL CENTER EMPLOYEES ARE ACTIVE IN EDUCATING PARTNERS ON A WIDE VARIETY OF HEALTH SUBJECTS THAT ADVANCE THEIR WORK. FURTHER, TRINITY MEDICAL CENTER EMPLOYEES ARE MEMBERS OF MANY NON-PROFIT BOARDS TO PROVIDE LEADERSHIP OR COLLABORATE TO ADDRESS COMPLEX HEALTH ISSUES.

RESEARCH HAS CONTINUALLY SHOWN THAT WHEN THE FACTORS INFLUENCING HEALTH ARE EXPLORED, HEALTH CARE ACTUALLY PLAYS THE SMALLEST ROLE PROPORTIONATELY. A REPORT IN THE JOURNAL OF AMERICAN MEDICAL ASSOCIATION AND THE CENTER FOR DISEASE CONTROL (MCGINNIS, 1996) SUGGESTS THAT THE FACTORS IMPACTING HEALTH ARE AS FOLLOWS: LIFESTYLE AND BEHAVIORS, 50%, ENVIRONMENT (HUMAN AND NATURAL), 20%, GENETICS AND HUMAN BIOLOGY, 20%, AND HEALTH CARE, 10%. COMMUNITY BUILDING ACTIVITIES HELP TO ADDRESS THE OTHER INDICATORS OUTSIDE OF THE ROLE TRADITIONALLY PLAYED BY HEALTH-CARE ORGANIZATIONS. THESE ACTIVITIES ARE ALMOST EXCLUSIVELY DONE IN SOME FORM OF PARTNERSHIP IN WHICH THE COMMUNITY OR OTHER ORGANIZATIONS ARE BETTER SUITED TO ADDRESS. HEALTH-CARE ORGANIZATIONS GENERALLY PROVIDE TIMELY AND SPECIFIC RESOURCES TO HELP THESE ISSUES. HEALTH-CARE ORGANIZATIONS CAN BE A RICH AND VALUABLE COMMUNITY RESOURCE IN WAYS NOT TYPICALLY CONSIDERED. OFTEN THE MOST EFFECTIVE WAY TO HELP IMPACT AND IMPROVE THE COMMUNITY HEALTH STATUS IS TO SUPPORT OTHER AGENCIES AND ORGANIZATIONS IN A VARIETY OF WAYS OUTSIDE OF HEALTH SERVICES. THIS IS OFTEN DONE THROUGH CASH OR IN-KIND SERVICES TO SUPPORT OTHER NON-PROFITS, DONATIONS OF DURABLE MEDICAL EQUIPMENT AND SUPPLIES TO CERTAIN AGENCIES, OR THROUGH LEADERSHIP AND EDUCATIONAL EXPERTISE. THE HOSPITAL CONTRIBUTES FINANCIALLY TO A WIDE VARIETY OF COMMUNITY ORGANIZATIONS THAT ADDRESS THE BROADER NEEDS OF THE COMMUNITY. THESE DONATIONS ALLOW OTHER NON-PROFIT ORGANIZATIONS TO FULFILL THEIR MISSIONS TO IMPROVE THE WELL BEING OF THE COMMUNITY AND CONTRIBUTE TO ITS OVERALL HEALTH STATUS IN WAYS THAT MAY DIFFER FROM THE DIRECT SERVICES OF THE HOSPITAL ORGANIZATION AND MAXIMIZE THE RESOURCES THEY HAVE TO WORK WITH. THE HOSPITAL EMPLOYEES ARE ACTIVE IN EDUCATING PARTNERS ON A WIDE VARIETY OF HEALTH SUBJECTS THAT ADVANCE THEIR WORK. FURTHER, THE HOSPITAL EMPLOYEES ARE MEMBERS OF MANY NON-PROFIT BOARDS TO PROVIDE LEADERSHIP OR COLLABORATE TO ADDRESS COMPLEX HEALTH ISSUES.

A MULTI-STEP PLANNING PROCESS WAS INITIATED.STEP 1 INVOLVED THE REVIEW AND REVISION OF THE HOSPITAL'S MISSION AND VISION STATEMENTS. BOTH STATEMENTS WERE MODIFIED FROM WHAT HAD PREVIOUSLY EXISTED. A CONCISE, VALUE DRIVEN MISSION STATEMENT WAS DEVELOPED IN RESPONSE TO THE NEED FOR MISSION STATEMENTS TO DESCRIBE ""WHO WE ARE."" ADDITIONALLY, SEVERAL CORE VALUES WERE DELINEATED IN SUPPORT OF THE MISSION STATEMENT.

FINALLY, A NUMBER OF SPECIFIC OBJECTIVES WERE DEVELOPED WHICH RESPOND TO THE QUESTION ""WHAT WILL BE ACCOMPLISHED ANNUALLY?"" OBJECTIVES WERE GENERATED BY SENIOR MANAGEMENT AND FORM THE BASIS FOR NEAR TERM ADMINISTRATIVE WORKPLANS.ESSENTIAL TO THE SUCCESS OF ANY STRATEGIC PLAN IS THE HOSPITAL'S ABILITY TO BOTH IMPLEMENT RECOMMENDATIONS MADE WITHIN THE PLAN AND TO RECOGNIZE THE DOCUMENT AS A DYNAMIC AND FLEXIBLE TOOL TO BE USED AS A GUIDE FOR THE FUTURE. SPECIFIC GOALS AND STRATEGIES MAY OR MAY NOT BE OBTAINED AND, UPON EVALUATION AND THE AVAILABILITY OF NEW INFORMATION AND DEVELOPMENTS, MAY NEED TO BE MODIFIED. A SUCCESSFUL STRATEGIC PLAN RECOGNIZES THIS POTENTIAL FOR CHANGE AND IS FLEXIBLE ENOUGH TO ACCOMMODATE NEW OR DIFFERENT OPPORTUNITIES AND CHALLENGES.CRITICAL HEALTH CARE ISSUESTHE RECENTLY ENACTED HEALTHCARE REFORM LEGISLATION UNDERSCORES MANY OF THE SIGNIFICANT ISSUES CURRENTLY FACING HOSPITALS. FOLLOWING IS LISTING OF CRITICAL ISSUES THAT WILL IMPACT HOSPITALS OVER THE NEXT SEVERAL YEARS. 1. QUALITY: HEALTH CARE QUALITY AND SAFETY ARE NOW STRATEGICALLY IMPORTANT, NOT JUST PROFESSIONALLY IMPORTANT. THE ADVENT OF WIDESPREAD PUBLIC REPORTING OF HOSPITAL QUALITY RESULTS ASSURES THAT A HOSPITAL'S QUALITY PERFORMANCE IS NO LONGER ONLY VISIBLE TO THE DIRECTOR OF QUALITY, QA COMMITTEE MEMBERS AND VARIOUS REGULATORS. THE NET EFFECT OF THIS TRANSPARENCY TREND OVER THE NEXT 5 YEARS WILL BE THAT THE DEFINITION OF A ""GOOD HOSPITAL"" WILL SHIFT SIGNIFICANTLY. NO LONGER WILL IT BE ENOUGH TO HAVE ATTRACTIVE FACILITIES, GOOD TECHNOLOGIES AND SKILLED DOCTORS AND NURSES. HOSPITALS WILL NEED TO MARSHAL THOSE RESOURCES INTO A QUALITY AND SAFETY SYSTEM CAPABLE OF RELIABLY PRODUCING MEASURED QUALITY RESULTS. PROVIDER PAYMENTS WILL INCREASINGLY BE A FUNCTION OF QUALITY OUTCOMES AND QUALITY BONUSES WILL BE DRAWN FROM ANNUAL PAYMENT UPDATES. INFORMATION SYSTEMS CAPABLE OF PROVIDING VALID AND RELIABLE QUALITY AND OUTCOME INDICATORS WILL BE A NECESSITY AS WILL THE USE OF EVIDENCE BASED GUIDELINES BY CLINICAL PROVIDERS. CONSUMERS WILL SEEK AND USE PERFORMANCE INFORMATION, INCLUDING PATIENT SATISFACTION INFORMATION, TO GUIDE THEIR CHOICE OF PROVIDERS.2. INFORMATION TECHNOLOGY: HEALTH INFORMATION TECHNOLOGY INCLUDES COMPUTER BASED TOOLS DEVELOPED SPECIFICALLY FOR HEALTH CARE DELIVERY. THESE TOOLS CAN PROVIDE CLINICIANS UP-TO-DATE INFORMATION ON THEIR PATIENTS, ACCESS TO THE LATEST MEDICAL KNOWLEDGE AND BEST PRACTICES THROUGH DECISION SUPPORT SYSTEMS. IT IS UNDERSTOOD THAT INVESTMENTS IN NEW CLINICAL AND INFORMATION TECHNOLOGY CAN SIGNIFICANTLY ENHANCE PATIENT SAFETY AND CLINICAL OUTCOMES. COMPUTERIZED PHYSICIAN ORDER ENTRY (CPOE), BAR CODING AND ITS POTENTIAL TO REDUCE MEDICATION ERRORS, AND ELECTRONIC MEDICAL RECORDS (EMRS) AND THEIR POSITIVE IMPACT ON MEDICAL ERRORS ARE ALL EXAMPLES OF HEALTH CARE'S USE OF IT SOLUTIONS TO IMPROVE QUALITY. THE FEDERAL GOVERNMENT HAS HIGHLIGHTED THE ROLE OF HEALTH INFORMATION TECHNOLOGY AS A MEANS TO IMPROVE HEALTH CARE QUALITY, SAFETY AND NOW IS PROVIDING STIMULUS AND INCENTIVE PAYMENTS TO PROVIDERS TO FACILITATE AND HASTEN THEIR ADOPTION INTO THE CARE DELIVERY PROCESS. EMR'S WILL BECOME A PREREQUISITE OF ANY DELIVERY SYSTEM THAT INTENDS TO PROVIDE COORDINATED COST EFFECTIVE CARE.3. PHYSICIANS: PHYSICIANS HAVE EMERGED AS CRITICAL OPERATIONAL AND STRATEGIC PARTNERS TO HOSPITALS. THOSE THAT ARE SUCCESSFUL IN ENGAGING AND COLLABORATING WITH THEIR MEDICAL STAFFS WILL BE BEST ABLE TO DEMONSTRATE HIGH QUALITY CARE AND COMPLIANCE WITH HEALTH REFORM'S VALUE BASED PURCHASING AND OTHER QUALITY MANDATES.ADDITIONALLY, GIVEN THE INCREASE IN DEMAND FOR HEALTHCARE SERVICES THAT WILL BE OCCASIONED BY REFORM, THE ABILITY TO SUCCESSFULLY RECRUIT PHYSICIANS WILL BE CRITICAL. AT A TIME WHEN HEALTHCARE REFORM INITIATIVES EMPHASIZE THE ROLE OF PRIMARY CARE, THERE IS A SPECIAL NEED TO INTENSIFY EFFORTS TO RECRUIT PRIMARY CARE PROVIDERS. BECAUSE THE VAST MAJORITY OF NEW PHYSICIANS PREFER EMPLOYMENT AS THEIR PRACTICE PREFERENC,, THE ABILITY OF HOSPITALS TO BE ABLE TO OFFER PHYSICIANS A CONTEMPORARY AND COMPETITIVE ""EMPLOYMENT PLATFORM"" IS ESSENTIAL.4. FINANCE AND CAPITAL: FINANCIAL PERFORMANCE AND ACCESS TO CAPITAL WILL CONTINUE TO BE AMONG THE MOST CRITICAL ISSUES CONFRONTING HOSPITALS. EVEN WITH HEALTHCARE REFORM, HEALTHCARE COSTS WILL CONTINUE TO OUTPACE INFLATION. INCREASING WAGE AND SALARY COSTS, AND RISING HEALTH CARE COSTS IN GENERAL WILL CONTINUE TO IMPACT OPERATING PERFORMANCE AND PRESS HOSPITALS TO CONTINUE A RELENTLESS FOCUS ON COST MANAGEMENT. ADDITIONALLY, REVENUE STRATEGIES WILL NEED TO BE DEVELOPED TO GENERATE PROFITABLE GROWTH IN PATIENT VOLUME, AS WILL THE NEED TO ENSURE OPTIMAL MANAGEMENT OF ALL REVENUE CYCLE ACTIVITIES. HOSPITALS ARE FACING SIGNIFICANT PAYMENT REDUCTIONS IN TERMS OF DECREASES IN MEDICARE UPDATES, DISPROPORTIONATE SHARE, SNF AND HOMECARE PAYMENTS. AS HOSPITALS CONTINUE TO POST LOW OR NO PROFIT MARGINS, INVESTMENT INCOME WILL BE MORE IMPORTANT THAN EVER. HOWEVER, GIVEN THE FACT THAT INVESTMENT INCOME IS A HIGHLY UNCERTAIN COMPONENT OF A HOSPITAL'S OVERALL FINANCIAL HEALTH, HOSPITALS WILL BE DRIVEN TO PURSUE MORE PHILANTHROPY. HOSPITAL CAPITAL SPENDING WILL BE DRIVEN BY GROWING DEMANDS FOR ADVANCED TECHNOLOGY NEEDED TO ENSURE PATIENT QUALITY AND SAFETY, THE NEED TO REPLACE AND UPDATE AGING FACILITIES, AND THE DESIRE AND NEED TO IMPROVE TECHNOLOGY BASED SERVICES.5. RISK MANAGEMENT AND COMPLIANCE: HEALTHCARE'S TECHNOLOGY HAS NEVER BEEN MORE COMPLICATED, PATIENTS' DEMANDS HIGHER, AND THE BUSINESS CHALLENGES GREATER. ACCORDINGLY, COMPREHENSIVE RISK MANAGEMENT PROGRAM ARE ESSENTIAL IN ASSURING CARE DELIVERY SYSTEMS THAT ARE HIGHLY EFFECTIVE IN TERMS OF ASSURING APPROPRIATE LEVELS OF PATIENT SAFETY AND QUALITY.THE DEPARTMENT OF JUSTICE ESTIMATES THAT THE FEDERAL GOVERNMENT LOSES BILLIONS OF DOLLARS ANNUALLY IN HEALTH CARE FRAUD. CONSEQUENTLY, THE GOVERNMENT'S HEALTHCARE FRAUD ENFORCEMENT ACTIVITIES WITH RESPECT TO ALL HEALTHCARE PROVIDERS CONTINUE TO GROW AND EXPAND. WELL ESTABLISHED CORPORATE COMPLIANCE PROGRAMS ARE ESSENTIAL IN TERMS OF ALLOWING HOSPITALS TO IDENTIFY POTENTIAL AREAS OF LIABILITY AND TO CORRECT PROBLEMS.6. NURSING: NURSES AND NURSING CARE ARE CENTRAL TO THE DELIVERY OF SAFE AND EFFECTIVE PATIENT CARE. ACCORDINGLY, ENSURING AN ADEQUATE NURSING WORKFORCE AND CREATING A WORK ENVIRONMENT THAT SUPPORTS NURSING PRACTICE AND INTERDISCIPLINARY COLLABORATION ARE IMPORTANT PRIORITIES FOR HOSPITALS TODAY."

The organization prepares and issues audited financial statements. The attached text was obtained from the footnotes to the audited financial statements of the organization. Uncompensated care The Medical Center provides charity care to patients who meet certain financial criteria established by the State of New Jersey. The direct and indirect cost of services and supplies furnished to patients eligible for such charity care, using a ratio of cost to gross charges, approximated $6,590,000 and $6,179,000 for the years ended December 31, 2013 and 2012, respectively. Gross charges forgone related to charity care services amounted to approximately $30,938,000 and $25,534,000 for the years ended December 31, 2013 and 2012, respectively. The Medical Center's patient acceptance policy is based on its mission statement and its charitable purposes. Accordingly, the Medical Center accepts all patients regardless of their ability to pay. This policy results in the assumption of higher-than-normal patient accounts receivable credit risks. To the extent the Medical Center realizes additional losses resulting from such higher credit risk for patients that are not identified or do not meet the previously described charity definition, such additional losses are included in the provision for bad debts. Additionally, the Medical Center sponsors certain other charitable programs, which provide substantial benefit to the broader community. Such programs include services to needy and elderly populations that require special support, as well as health promotion and education for the general community welfare. The Health Care Reform Act of 1992, Chapter 160, established the Health Care Subsidy Fund to provide a mechanism and funding source to compensate hospitals for charity care. The Medical Center received approximately $1,362,000 and $1,346,000 for charity care, which is included in net patient service revenue for the years ended December 31, 2013 and 2012, respectively.

MEDICARE UNDERPAYMENTS AND BAD DEBT ARE COMMUNITY BENEFIT AND ASSOCIATED COSTS ARE INCLUDABLE ON THE FORM 990, SCHEDULE H, PART I. THE ORGANIZATION BELIEVES THAT MEDICARE UNDERPAYMENTS (SHORTFALL) AND BAD DEBT ARE COMMUNITY BENEFIT AND ASSOCIATED COSTS ARE INCLUDABLE ON THE FORM 990, SCHEDULE H, PART I. AS OUTLINED MORE FULLY BELOW, THE ORGANIZATION BELIEVES THAT THESE SERVICES AND RELATED COSTS PROMOTE THE HEALTH OF THE COMMUNITY AS A WHOLE AND ARE RENDERED IN CONJUNCTION WITH THE ORGANIZATION'S CHARITABLE TAX-EXEMPT PURPOSES AND MISSION IN PROVIDING MEDICALLY NECESSARY HEALTHCARE SERVICES TO ALL INDIVIDUALS IN A NON-DISCRIMINATORY MANNER WITHOUT REGARD TO RACE, COLOR, CREED, SEX, NATIONAL ORIGIN, RELIGION OR ABILITY TO PAY AND CONSISTENT WITH THE COMMUNITY BENEFIT STANDARD PROMULGATED BY THE INTERNAL REVENUE SERVICE (""IRS""). THE COMMUNITY BENEFIT STANDARD IS THE CURRENT STANDARD FOR A HOSPITAL FOR RECOGNITION AS A TAX-EXEMPT AND CHARITABLE ORGANIZATION UNDER INTERNAL REVENUE CODE (""IRC"") 501(C)(3). THE ORGANIZATION IS RECOGNIZED AS A TAX-EXEMPT ENTITY AND CHARITABLE ORGANIZATION UNDER 501(C)(3) OF THE IRC. ALTHOUGH THERE IS NO DEFINITION IN THE TAX CODE FOR THE TERM ""CHARITABLE"" A REGULATION PROMULGATED BY THE DEPARTMENT OF THE TREASURY PROVIDES SOME GUIDANCE AND STATES THAT ""THE TERM CHARITABLE IS USED IN 501(C)(3) IN ITS GENERALLY ACCEPTED LEGAL SENSE,"" AND PROVIDES EXAMPLES OF CHARITABLE PURPOSES, INCLUDING THE RELIEF OF THE POOR OR UNPRIVILEGED; THE PROMOTION OF SOCIAL WELFARE; AND THE ADVANCEMENT OF EDUCATION, RELIGION, AND SCIENCE. NOTE IT DOES NOT EXPLICITLY ADDRESS THE ACTIVITIES OF HOSPITALS. IN THE ABSENCE OF EXPLICIT STATUTORY OR REGULATORY REQUIREMENTS APPLYING THE TERM ""CHARITABLE"" TO HOSPITALS, IT HAS BEEN LEFT TO THE IRS TO DETERMINE THE CRITERIA HOSPITALS MUST MEET TO QUALIFY AS IRC 501(C)(3) CHARITABLE ORGANIZATIONS. THE ORIGINAL STANDARD WAS KNOWN AS THE CHARITY CARE STANDARD. THIS STANDARD WAS REPLACED BY THE IRS WITH THE COMMUNITY BENEFIT STANDARD WHICH IS THE CURRENT STANDARD. CHARITY CARE STANDARD IN 1956, THE IRS ISSUED REVENUE RULING 56-185, WHICH ADDRESSED THE REQUIREMENTS HOSPITALS NEEDED TO MEET IN ORDER TO QUALIFY FOR IRC 501(C)(3) STATUS. ONE OF THESE REQUIREMENTS IS KNOWN AS THE ""CHARITY CARE STANDARD."" UNDER THE STANDARD, A HOSPITAL HAD TO PROVIDE, TO THE EXTENT OF ITS FINANCIAL ABILITY, FREE OR REDUCED-COST CARE TO PATIENTS UNABLE TO PAY FOR IT. A HOSPITAL THAT EXPECTED FULL PAYMENT DID NOT, ACCORDING TO THE RULING, PROVIDE CHARITY CARE BASED ON THE FACT THAT SOME PATIENTS ULTIMATELY FAILED TO PAY. THE RULING EMPHASIZED THAT A LOW LEVEL OF CHARITY CARE DID NOT NECESSARILY MEAN THAT A HOSPITAL HAD FAILED TO MEET THE REQUIREMENT SINCE THAT LEVEL COULD REFLECT ITS FINANCIAL ABILITY TO PROVIDE SUCH CARE. THE RULING ALSO NOTED THAT PUBLICLY SUPPORTED COMMUNITY HOSPITALS WOULD NORMALLY QUALIFY AS CHARITABLE ORGANIZATIONS BECAUSE THEY SERVE THE ENTIRE COMMUNITY, AND A LOW LEVEL OF CHARITY CARE WOULD NOT AFFECT A HOSPITAL'S EXEMPT STATUS IF IT WAS DUE TO THE SURROUNDING COMMUNITY'S LACK OF CHARITABLE DEMANDS. COMMUNITY BENEFIT STANDARD IN 1969, THE IRS ISSUED REVENUE RULING 69-545, WHICH ""REMOVED"" FROM REVENUE RULING 56-185 ""THE REQUIREMENTS RELATING TO CARING FOR PATIENTS WITHOUT CHARGE OR AT RATES BELOW COST."" UNDER THE STANDARD DEVELOPED IN REVENUE RULING 69-545, WHICH IS KNOWN AS THE ""COMMUNITY BENEFIT STANDARD,"" HOSPITALS ARE JUDGED ON WHETHER THEY PROMOTE THE HEALTH OF A BROAD CLASS OF INDIVIDUALS IN THE COMMUNITY. THE RULING INVOLVED A HOSPITAL THAT ONLY ADMITTED INDIVIDUALS WHO COULD PAY FOR THE SERVICES (BY THEMSELVES, PRIVATE INSURANCE, OR PUBLIC PROGRAMS SUCH AS MEDICARE), BUT OPERATED A FULL-TIME EMERGENCY ROOM THAT WAS OPEN TO EVERYONE. THE IRS RULED THAT THE HOSPITAL QUALIFIED AS A CHARITABLE ORGANIZATION BECAUSE IT PROMOTED THE HEALTH OF PEOPLE IN ITS COMMUNITY. THE IRS REASONED THAT BECAUSE THE PROMOTION OF HEALTH WAS A CHARITABLE PURPOSE ACCORDING TO THE GENERAL LAW OF CHARITY, IT FELL WITHIN THE ""GENERALLY ACCEPTED LEGAL SENSE"" OF THE TERM ""CHARITABLE,"" AS REQUIRED BY TREAS. REG. 1.501(C)(3)-1(D)(2). THE IRS RULING STATED THAT THE PROMOTION OF HEALTH, LIKE THE RELIEF OF POVERTY AND THE ADVANCEMENT OF EDUCATION AND RELIGION, IS ONE OF THE PURPOSES IN THE GENERAL LAW OF CHARITY THAT IS DEEMED BENEFICIAL TO THE COMMUNITY AS A WHOLE EVEN THOUGH THE CLASS OF BENEFICIARIES ELIGIBLE TO RECEIVE A DIRECT BENEFIT FROM ITS ACTIVITIES DOES NOT INCLUDE ALL MEMBERS OF THE COMMUNITY, SUCH AS INDIGENT MEMBERS OF THE COMMUNITY, PROVIDED THAT THE CLASS IS NOT SO SMALL THAT ITS RELIEF IS NOT OF BENEFIT TO THE COMMUNITY. THE IRS CONCLUDED THAT THE HOSPITAL WAS ""PROMOTING THE HEALTH OF A CLASS OF PERSONS THAT IS BROAD ENOUGH TO BENEFIT THE COMMUNITY"" BECAUSE ITS EMERGENCY DEPARTMENT WAS OPEN TO ALL AND IT PROVIDED CARE TO EVERYONE WHO COULD PAY, WHETHER DIRECTLY OR THROUGH THIRD-PARTY REIMBURSEMENT. OTHER CHARACTERISTICS OF THE HOSPITAL THAT THE IRS HIGHLIGHTED INCLUDED THE FOLLOWING: IT WAS CONTROLLED BY A BOARD OF TRUSTEES THAT CONSISTED OF INDEPENDENT CIVIC LEADERS; HOSPITAL MEDICAL STAFF PRIVILEGES WERE AVAILABLE TO ALL QUALIFIED PHYSICIANS; AND SURPLUS FUNDS ARE USED TO IMPROVE THE QUALITY OF PATIENT CARE, EXPAND AND RENOVATE HOSPITAL FACILITIES AND ADVANCE MEDICAL CARE, TRAINING, EDUCATION, RESEARCH, PROGRAMS AND ACTIVITIES. MEDICARE UNDERPAYMENTS AND BAD DEBT ARE COMMUNITY BENEFIT AND ASSOCIATED COSTS ARE INCLUDABLE ON THE FORM 990, SCHEDULE H, PART I. THE AMERICAN HOSPITAL ASSOCIATION (""AHA"") BELIEVES THAT MEDICARE UNDERPAYMENTS (SHORTFALL) AND BAD DEBT ARE COMMUNITY BENEFIT AND THUS INCLUDABLE ON THE FORM 990, SCHEDULE H, PART I. THIS ORGANIZATION AGREES WITH THE AHA POSITION. AS OUTLINED IN THE AHA LETTER TO THE IRS DATED AUGUST 21, 2007 WITH RESPECT TO THE FIRST PUBLISHED DRAFT OF THE NEW FORM 990 AND SCHEDULE H, THE AHA FELT THAT THE IRS SHOULD INCORPORATE THE FULL VALUE OF THE COMMUNITY BENEFIT THAT HOSPITALS PROVIDE BY COUNTING MEDICARE UNDERPAYMENTS (SHORTFALL) AS QUANTIFIABLE COMMUNITY BENEFIT FOR THE FOLLOWING REASONS: - PROVIDING CARE FOR THE ELDERLY AND SERVING MEDICARE PATIENTS IS AN ESSENTIAL PART OF THE COMMUNITY BENEFIT STANDARD. - MEDICARE, LIKE MEDICAID, DOES NOT PAY THE FULL COST OF CARE. RECENTLY, MEDICARE REIMBURSES HOSPITALS ONLY 86 CENTS FOR EVERY DOLLAR THEY SPEND TO TAKE CARE OF MEDICARE PATIENTS. THE MEDICARE PAYMENT ADVISORY COMMISSION (""MEDPAC"") IN ITS MARCH 2014 REPORT TO CONGRESS CAUTIONED THAT MARGINS WILL CONTINUE TO DECLINE. - MANY MEDICARE BENEFICIARIES, LIKE THEIR MEDICAID COUNTERPARTS, ARE POOR. MORE THAN 46 PERCENT OF MEDICARE SPENDING IS FOR BENEFICIARIES WHOSE INCOME IS BELOW 200 PERCENT OF THE FEDERAL POVERTY LEVEL. MANY OF THOSE MEDICARE BENEFICIARIES ARE ALSO ELIGIBLE FOR MEDICAID -- SO CALLED ""DUAL ELIGIBLES."" THERE IS EVERY COMPELLING PUBLIC POLICY REASON TO TREAT MEDICARE AND MEDICAID UNDERPAYMENTS SIMILARLY FOR PURPOSES OF A HOSPITAL'S COMMUNITY BENEFIT AND INCLUDE THESE COSTS ON FORM 990, SCHEDULE H, PART I. MEDICARE UNDERPAYMENT MUST BE SHOULDERED BY THE HOSPITAL IN ORDER TO CONTINUE TREATING THE COMMUNITY'S ELDERLY AND POOR. THESE UNDERPAYMENTS REPRESENT A REAL COST OF SERVING THE COMMUNITY AND SHOULD COUNT AS A QUANTIFIABLE COMMUNITY BENEFIT. BOTH THE AHA AND THIS ORGANIZATION ALSO BELIEVE THAT PATIENT BAD DEBT IS A COMMUNITY BENEFIT AND THUS INCLUDABLE ON THE FORM 990, SCHEDULE H, PART I. LIKE MEDICARE UNDERPAYMENT (SHORTFALLS), THERE ALSO ARE COMPELLING REASONS THAT PATIENT BAD DEBT SHOULD BE COUNTED AS QUANTIFIABLE COMMUNITY BENEFIT AS FOLLOWS: - A SIGNIFICANT MAJORITY OF BAD DEBT IS ATTRIBUTABLE TO LOW-INCOME PATIENTS, WHO, FOR MANY REASONS, DECLINE TO COMPLETE THE FORMS REQUIRED TO ESTABLISH ELIGIBILITY FOR HOSPITALS' CHARITY CARE OR FINANCIAL ASSISTANCE PROGRAMS. A 2006 CONGRESSIONAL BUDGET OFFICE (""CBO"") REPORT, NONPROFIT HOSPITALS AND THE PROVISION OF COMMUNITY BENEFITS, CITED TWO STUDIES INDICATING THAT ""THE GREAT MAJORITY OF BAD DEBT WAS ATTRIBUTABLE TO PATIENTS WITH INCOMES BELOW 200% OF THE FEDERAL POVERTY LINE."" - THE REPORT ALSO NOTED THAT A SUBSTANTIAL PORTION OF BAD DEBT IS PENDING CHARITY CARE. UNLIKE BAD DEBT IN OTHER INDUSTRIES, HOSPITAL BAD DEBT IS COMPLICATED BY THE FACT THAT HOSPITALS FOLLOW THEIR MISSION TO THE COMMUNITY AND TREAT EVERY PATIENT THAT COMES THROUGH THEIR EMERGENCY DEPARTMENT, REGARDLESS OF ABILITY TO PAY. PATIENTS WHO HAVE OUTSTANDING BILLS ARE NOT TURNED AWAY, UNLIKE OTHER INDUSTRIES. BAD DEBT IS FURTHER COMPLICATED BY THE AUDITING INDUSTRY'S STANDARDS ON REPORTING CHARITY CARE. MANY PATIENTS CANNOT OR DO NOT PROVIDE THE NECESSARY, EXTENSIVE DOCUMENTATION REQUIRED TO BE DEEMED CHARITY CARE BY AUDITORS. AS A RESULT, ROUGHLY 40% OF BAD DEBT IS PENDING CHARITY CARE. - THE CBO CONCLUDED THAT ITS FINDINGS ""SUPPORT THE VALIDITY OF THE USE OF UNCOMPENSATED CARE [BAD DEBT AND CHARITY CARE] AS A MEASURE OF COMMUNITY BENEFITS ASSUMING THE FINDINGS ARE GENERAL"

WE CONTINUE TO BUILD ON OUR LONG AND STRONG RECORD OF COLLABORATION WITH COMMUNITY GROUPS, BUSINESSES, ACADEMIC INSTITUTIONS, AND GOVERNMENTAL AND NON-GOVERNMENTAL ORGANIZATIONS WITH THE GOAL OF IMPROVING HEALTH OUTCOMES AND REDUCING HEALTH DISPARITIES FOR CHILDREN AND THEIR FAMILIES. EMPHASIS IS PLACED ON ADDRESSING BOTH THE SOCIAL DETERMINANTS OF HEALTH AND THE HEALTH CARE DELIVERY SYSTEM. SELECTED COMMUNITY BUILDING ACTIVITIES ARE HIGHLIGHTED BELOW. COMMUNITY SUPPORT - COMMUNITY-CAMPUS PARTNERSHIP THE COMMUNITY-CAMPUS PARTNERSHIP (C-CP) WAS CREATED IN 2013 TO FOSTER COLLABORATIONS AND HEALTHY COMMUNITIES AROUND THE ANSCHUTZ MEDICAL CAMPUS. THE NEW COMMUNITY-CAMPUS PARTNERSHIP WILL BE A MECHANISM FOR COORDINATING, COMMUNICATING, AND CONNECTING CAMPUS ENTITIES WITH COMMUNITIES. THE INITIATIVE WILL SUPPORT THE DEVELOPMENT OF COMMUNITY-CAMPUS PARTNERSHIPS FOR PREVENTION, HEALTH IMPROVEMENT AND ECONOMIC DEVELOPMENT AND WILL SEEK ADDITIONAL FUNDING TO MONITOR THE PHYSICAL AND MENTAL HEALTH STATUS IN THE NEIGHBORHOODS. THE CREATION OF COLLABORATIVE OPPORTUNITIES AND PARTNERSHIPS WILL ENHANCE THE EDUCATION, RESEARCH, AND SERVICES PROVIDED IN THE COMMUNITIES AND ON THE ANSCHUTZ MEDICAL CAMPUS WHICH IS SHARED BY CHILDREN'S HOSPITAL COLORADO AND UNIVERSITY OF COLORADO HOSPITAL. THE GOAL IS TO HELP NEIGHBORHOOD RESIDENTS LIVE HEALTHY LIFESTYLES AND EXPAND WORKFORCE DEVELOPMENT BY PREPARING THEM FOR JOBS ON THE MEDICAL AND RESEARCH CAMPUS. REPRESENTATIVES FROM CHILDREN'S HOSPITAL COLORADO SERVE ON THE CAMPUS COMMUNITY IMPLEMENTATION BOARD. COMMUNITY SUPPORT - MEDICAL LEGAL PARTNERSHIP MEDICAL-LEGAL PARTNERSHIP IS A HEALTH CARE DELIVERY MODEL THAT IMPROVES THE HEALTH AND WELL-BEING OF LOW-INCOME AND OTHER VULNERABLE POPULATIONS BY ADDRESSING UNMET LEGAL NEEDS AND REMOVING LEGAL BARRIERS THAT IMPEDE HEALTH. LEGAL PROFESSIONALS FROM THE LEGAL AID, LAW SCHOOL AND PRIVATE SECTOR PRO BONO COMMUNITIES ARE INTEGRATED INTO THE HEALTHCARE TEAM, WHERE THEY PARTNER WITH FRONT-LINE PHYSICIANS, NURSES, CASE MANAGERS AND OTHERS TO: (1) PROVIDE DIRECT LEGAL ASSISTANCE TO PATIENTS; (2) DEVELOP/ALIGN STRATEGIES TO IMPROVE HEALTH AND LEGAL INSTITUTIONS AND PRACTICES; AND (3) CHANGE POLICIES, ALL IN SERVICE OF ENSURING THAT VULNERABLE PEOPLE GET AND STAY HEALTHY. THE MEDICAL-LEGAL PARTNERSHIP MODEL IS UNIQUE BECAUSE IT BRIDGES PATIENT TO POPULATION LEVEL INTERVENTIONS AND ALSO ADDS A LEVEL OF INSTITUTIONAL SYSTEMS CHANGE. HEALTH AND LEGAL SERVICES ARE INTEGRATED, RATHER THAN OPERATING AS A REFERRAL MECHANISM, LEADING TO LONG-TERM, SUSTAINABLE, MORE EFFECTIVE SOLUTIONS TO HEALTH AND LEGAL PROBLEMS. ENVIRONMENTAL IMPROVEMENT RECOGNIZING THAT EFFECTIVE ADVOCACY FOR IMPROVED ACCESS TO HEALTH CARE INCLUDES WORK TO ENSURE THAT FAMILIES HAVE ACCESS TO AFFORDABLE TRANSPORTATION; CHILDREN'S HOSPITAL COLORADO SERVES AS A CHAMPION OF THE CAUSE OF EXPANDED LIGHT RAIL SERVICES TO THE ANSCHUTZ MEDICAL CAMPUS. CHILDREN'S HOSPITAL COLORADO PLAYED A LEADING ROLE IN COORDINATING ADVOCACY WORK WITH OTHER HEALTHCARE PLAYERS ON CAMPUS AND THE CITY OF AURORA TO ENSURE THAT OUR REGIONAL TRANSPORTATION DISTRICT (""RTD"") BEGIN WORK TO EXPAND THE LIGHT RAIL LINE DOWN THE HIGHWAY WITH THE CLOSEST PROXIMITY TO THE CAMPUS. FOLLOWING THIS SUCCESSFUL EFFORT, CHILDREN'S HOSPITAL COLORADO HAS STARTED WORK TO EXPAND THAT LINE EVEN FURTHER TO RUN THROUGH THE CAMPUS, FURTHER ENHANCING ACCESS TO CRITICAL MEDICAL SERVICES. LEADERSHIP DEVELOPMENT AND TRAINING FOR COMMUNITY MEMBERS THE FAMILY LEADERSHIP TRAINING INSTITUTE (FLTI) IS A FIRST-OF-ITS-KIND FAMILY CIVICS PROGRAM. THE GOALS OF FLTI ARE TO EFFECT POSITIVE FAMILY LEADERSHIP DEVELOPMENT BY: 1) HELPING FAMILIES BECOME LEADERS IN THEIR COMMUNITIES THROUGH CIVIC ENGAGEMENT; 2) EXPANDING AND FACILITATING THE CAPACITY OF FAMILIES TO BE CHANGE AGENTS ON A NEIGHBORHOOD, REGIONAL AND STATE LEVEL; 3) DEVELOPING SUPPORTIVE COMMUNITIES OF FAMILIES WITHIN REGIONS OF THE STATE; 4) FACILITATING FAMILY INVOLVEMENT IN STATE AND LOCAL POLICY DECISION-MAKING PROCESSES; 5) INCREASING PARENT-CHILD INTERACTION THROUGH FAMILY INVOLVEMENT. CHILDREN'S HOSPITAL COLORADO ALONG WITH THE COLORADO DEPARTMENT OF PUBLIC HEALTH AND ENVIRONMENT, COLORADO STATE UNIVERSITY EXTENSION, COLORADO DEPARTMENT OF HUMAN SERVICES, AND COLORADO HEALTH FOUNDATION ARE PRIMARY PARTNERS OF THIS STATE-WIDE INITIATIVE.PROGRAM GRADUATES SPEND MORE THAN 120 HOURS TO DEVELOP SKILLS NEEDED TO BECOME EFFECTIVE LEADERS IN THEIR COMMUNITIES. ONCE RECRUITED AND ACCEPTED IN TO THE PROGRAM, PARTICIPANTS ATTEND A 20-WEEK CURRICULUM THAT INTEGRATES PERSONAL AND CHILD DEVELOPMENT, LEADERSHIP TRAINING, CIVIC LITERACY AND CIVIC PARTICIPATION SKILLS. THE CURRICULUM INCLUDES FOUR COMPONENTS: AN INITIAL RETREAT, TWO 10-WEEK SESSIONS THAT FOCUS ON KNOWLEDGE ABOUT THE CHANGE PROCESS, SKILL BUILDING, AND TOOLS OF CIVIC ENGAGEMENT, AND A COMMUNITY PROJECT. COALITION BUILDING CHILDREN'S HOSPITAL COLORADO'S MAIN HOSPITAL IS LOCATED ON THE ANSCHUTZ MEDICAL CAMPUS IN AURORA, COLORADO. THE COMMUNITY CONSISTS OF MANY LOW-INCOME NEIGHBORHOODS AND COMMUNITIES WITH SIGNIFICANT UNMET HEALTHCARE NEEDS. THROUGH AURORA HEALTH ACCESS (AHA), CHILDREN'S HOSPITAL COLORADO HAS SUPPORTED A MULTI-PRONGED APPROACH TO CREATING A CULTURE OF HEALTH IN AURORA - AN APPROACH THAT AIMS TO REDUCE THE NUMBER OF UNINSURED, PROMOTE ACCESS TO CARE, IMPROVE CARE COORDINATION, AND ENCOURAGE HEALTHY BEHAVIORS. IN PARTICULAR, CHILDREN'S HOSPITAL COLORADO LEADS THE PEDIATRIC ACCESS TO CARE SUBCOMMITTEE AND HELPS TO FOCUS THE COALITION'S EFFORTS ON IMPROVING ACCESS TO PRIMARY CARE AND MEDICAL HOMES FOR CHILDREN. COMMUNITY HEALTH IMPROVEMENT (ADVOCACY) AS PART OF ITS ONGOING MISSION, CHILDREN'S HOSPITAL COLORADO IS COMMITTED TO ADVOCATING ON BEHALF OF CHILDREN BY WORKING TO INFLUENCE PUBLIC POLICY BOTH AT A HIGH LEVEL AND THROUGH GRASSROOTS SUPPORT. THE HOSPITAL PROACTIVELY INFLUENCES LOCAL, STATE AND FEDERAL HEALTHCARE POLICY THAT IMPACTS ISSUES IDENTIFIED IN THE COMMUNITY NEEDS ASSESSMENT SUCH AS CHILDHOOD OBESITY, BEHAVIORAL HEALTH, INJURY PREVENTION AND ACCESS TO CARE. CHILDREN'S HOSPITAL COLORADO HAS ALSO DEVELOPED A PROGRAM THAT TEACHES PATIENTS, FAMILIES AND COMMUNITY MEMBERS HOW TO ADVOCATE ON BEHALF OF THE INTERESTS IMPORTANT TO THEM, THEREBY ADDRESSING THE NEED FOR COMMUNITY EMPOWERMENT. CHILDREN'S HOSPITAL COLORADO HAS A GRASSROOTS ADVOCACY NETWORK COMPRISED OF NEARLY 4,000 ADVOCATES ACROSS THE STATE. THE GOAL IN LEADING THIS NETWORK IS TO MAKE IT SIMPLE FOR ALL COMMUNITY MEMBERS TO SPEAK UP ON BEHALF OF CHILD HEALTH ISSUES. COMMUNITY HEALTH IMPROVEMENT (LITERACY) A CRITICAL COMPONENT TO LIVING A HEALTHY LIFE IS THE ABILITY FOR PEOPLE TO ACCESS INFORMATION THEY NEED ABOUT THEIR HEALTH. THIS CANNOT BE DONE EFFECTIVELY WITHOUT BASIC LITERACY SKILLS. UNDERSTANDING THAT CHILDREN'S HOSPITAL COLORADO IS INVESTED IN CREATING PROGRAMS THAT ADDRESS THE ENTIRE PICTURE OF HEALTH; WE COMMITTED SIGNIFICANT RESOURCES TO IMPROVE LOW INCOME, HIGH RISK POPULATION LITERACY RATES. CHILDREN'S HOSPITAL COLORADO HAS TEAMED UP WITH REACH OUT AND READ WITH THE GOAL OF ENROLLING 100% OF LOW INCOME CHILDREN IN THIS EVIDENCE BASED LITERACY PROGRAM RUN THROUGH PRIMARY CARE OFFICES DURING WELL CHILD VISITS. BECAUSE 90% OF BRAIN DEVELOPMENT OCCURS BETWEEN BIRTH AND AGE 5 WE WANTED TO UTILIZE A PROGRAM THAT OFFERS AN EFFECTIVE INTERVENTION DURING A CRITICAL WINDOW FOR LEARNING. WE RECOGNIZE THAT IF CHILDREN MISS THE OPPORTUNITY TO ACQUIRE FOUNDATIONAL LANGUAGE SKILLS, THEY ARE SET UP FOR IMMEDIATE STRUGGLES THAT IMPACT THEIR OVERALL HEALTH AND WELL-BEING. WE ARE USING OUR RELATIONSHIPS WITH COMMUNITY PHYSICIANS AND OUR ADVOCACY EXPERTISE AND RESOURCES TO SUPPORT OUR OBJECTIVE. WORKFORCE DEVELOPMENT FOUNDED AT CHILDREN'S IN 1998, THE MEDICAL CAREER COLLABORATIVE PROGRAM (MC2), IS A HANDS ON LEARNING PROGRAM THAT SERVES LOW INCOME MINORITY YOUTH INTERESTED IN PURSUING A CAREER IN THE HEALTH CARE FIELD. MC2 SERVES AS AN EDUCATIONAL AND SUPPORTIVE OUTLET FOR HIGH ACHIEVING AND DRIVEN STUDENTS WHO OFTEN LACK NECESSARY SUPPORTS IN THEIR COMMUNITIES. THE PROGRAM'S MISSION OF HELPING HIGH SCHOOL STUDENTS FROM DIVERSE BACKGROUNDS EXPLORE THE WORLD OF HEALTHCARE AND DISCOVER THE OPPORTUNITIES AVAILABLE TO THEM IN THE MEDICAL INDUSTRY, IS A STRATEGIC PROGRAM AS PART OF HR'S WORKFORCE DEVELOPMENT EFFORTS. AS THE PROGRAM INVESTS IN THESE STUDENTS IT IS ESSENTIALLY INCREASING THE DIVERSITY AND CULTURAL AWARENESS OF THE HEALTHCARE WORKFORCE AS IT BUILDS THE NEXT GENERATION OF PROFESSIONALS HERE AT CHILDREN'S COLORADO AND IN THE COMMUNITY. IN 2013 THERE WERE 50 ACTIVE STUDENTS AND 20 ACTIVE GRADUATES. GRADUATES."
