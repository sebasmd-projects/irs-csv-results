(""IU Health Arnett"") is included in the consolidated audit report prepared for Indiana University Health, Inc. (""IU Health""). The provision for uncollected patient accounts is based upon management's assessment of historical and expected net collections considering business and economic conditions, changes and trends in health care coverage, and other collection indicators. Periodically, management assesses the adequacy of the allowance for uncollectible accounts based upon accounts receivable payor composition and aging, and historical write-off experience by payor category, as adjusted for collection indicators. The results of the review are then used to make any modifications to the provision for uncollected patient accounts and the allowance for uncollectible accounts. In addition, the IU Health System follows established guidelines for placing certain past due patient balances with collection agencies. Patient accounts that are uncollected, including those placed with collection agencies, are initially charged against the allowance for uncollectible accounts in accordance with collection policies of the IU Health System and, in certain cases, are reclassified to charity care if deemed to otherwise meet charity care and financial assistance policies of the IU Health System. The bad debt expense reported on Line 2 is calculated under the cost to charge ratio methodology. IU Health Arnett provides health care services through various programs that are designed, among other matters, to enhance the health of the community and improve the health of low-income patients. In addition, IU Health Arnett provides services intended to benefit the poor and underserved, including those persons who cannot afford health insurance because of inadequate resources or are uninsured or underinsured."
201433219349304933,263162145,"Schedule H, Part III, Line 8 - Medicare Shortfall","The Medicare shortfall reported on Schedule H, Part III, Line 7 is calculated, in accordance with the Form 990 instructions, using ""allowable costs"" from Indiana University Health Arnett, Inc.'s (""IU Health Arnett"") Medicare Cost Report. ""Allowable costs"" for Medicare Cost Report purposes are not reflective of all costs associated with IU Health Arnett's participation in Medicare programs. For example, the Medicare Cost Report excludes certain costs such as billed physician services, the costs of Medicare Parts C and D, fee schedule reimbursed services, and durable medical equipment services. Inclusion of all costs associated with IU Health Arnett's participation in Medicare programs would significantly increase the Medicare shortfall reported on Schedule H, Part III, Line 7. IU Health Arnett's Medicare shortfall is attributable to reimbursements that are less than the cost of providing patient care and services to Medicare beneficiaries and does not include any amounts that result from inefficiencies or poor management. IU Health Arnett accepts all Medicare patients knowing that there may be shortfalls; therefore it has taken the position that the shortfall should be counted as part of its community benefit. Additionally, it is implied in Internal Revenue Service Revenue Ruling 69-545 that treating Medicare patients is a community benefit. Revenue Ruling 69-545, which established the community benefit standard for nonprofit hospitals, states that if a hospital serves patients with governmental health benefits, including Medicare, then this is an indication that the hospital operates to promote the health of the community."

IU Health Arnett has an expansive financial assistance program, which aligns with IU Health Arnett's policy and utilizes the federal poverty guidelines to determine eligibility, making access to quality care within a patient's reach. The IU Health Arnett Financial Assistance policy provides the following support to patients that qualify. - Free care for those earning up to 200 percent of federal poverty guidelines; - Discounted care on a sliding scale for families earning from 200 to 400 percent of federal poverty guidelines; and - Discounted care on a sliding scale for uninsured families earning from 400 to 650 percent of federal poverty guidelines, and - Financial assistance to patients whose health insurance coverage, if any, does not provide full coverage for all of their medical expenses and whose medical expenses would make them indigent if they were forced to pay full charges. Patients are guided through their course of care with particular sensitivity, reviewing changing circumstances and allowing for financial assistance at any point during the relationship and billing process with the patient. For those inpatients that may qualify for the Medicaid program and have not applied, IU Health Arnett financial counselors will assist patients with the Medicaid application.

Additionally, IU Health Arnett invests in the community to improve the quality of the health of the community members. Several community benefit highlights are described below. In order to provide educational information and promote health and safety to the local communities it serves, IU Health Arnett hosted its second annual Health & Safety Fair on May 18, 2013. Over 800 people attended the Health & Safety Fair, which focused on providing education to children and their families about their health and well-being. Dozens of community organizations provided educational booths including a smoke trailer to learn how to escape from a smoky house, blood pressure and cholesterol screenings, balance screenings, free bike helmets, hands-on CPR and AED training for families and free car seat safety checks. Community partners also provided information about services for cancer patients, calling 911 and a system that helps locate lost children with disabilities. 75 blood pressure and cholesterol screenings were administered and 41 new car seats were given away. As a part of Indiana University Health's mission to improve the health of the community, a free walking program was developed in 2013. IU Health Arnett with support from the YMCA and Lafayette Parks & Recreation Department collaborated to provide the community with health and fitness experts to motivate the group to ""get strong"" by providing a fun and safe way to increase physical activity. The goal was to dedicate 30 minutes of activity that could help achieve numerous health benefits such as improved blood pressure and cholesterol level. Once a month, each of the IU Health supported walking sites hosted a gathering with a special guest speaker who demonstrated more ways to help participants get strong. Each week individuals had the option of having their body mass index and blood pressure screened, as a way to track how the walking was impacting their health. Over the course of the four-month program, 49 people registered for the group with 20 percent of participants improving their distance walked. Four people improved their blood pressure from the beginning of the program to the end. Six people reduced their body mass index. The hospital also donated more than $500,000 to non-profit community organizations in 2013. Some of the groups included the Riggs Community Health Center, Lafayette Medical Education Foundation, the United Way of Greater Lafayette and the American Heart Association."
201433219349304933,263162145,"Schedule H, Part VI, Line 6 - Affiliated Health Care System","IU Health Arnett is a part of the IU Health statewide healthcare system which continues to broaden its reach and positive impact throughout the state of Indiana. IU Health is Indiana's most comprehensive academic medical center and consists of IU Health Methodist Hospital, IU Health University Hospital, Riley Hospital for Children at IU Health, IU Health West Hospital, IU Health North Hospital, IU Health Ball Memorial, IU Health Blackford Hospital, IU Health Bloomington Hospital, IU Health Paoli Hospital, IU Health Bedford Hospital, IU Health Tipton Hospital, IU Health La Porte Hospital, IU Health Starke Hospital, IU Health Morgan, IU Health White, and IU Health Goshen Hospital. Although each IU Health hospital prepares and submits its own community benefits plan relative to the local community, IU Health Arnett considers its community benefit plan as part of an overall vision for strengthening Indiana's overall health. A comprehensive community outreach strategy and community benefit plan is in place that encompasses the academic medical center downtown Indianapolis, suburban Indianapolis and statewide entities around priority areas that focus on health improvement efforts statewide. IU Health is keenly aware of the positive impact it can have on the communities of need in the state of Indiana by focusing on the most pressing needs in a systematic and strategic way. After taking a careful look into IU Health's communities we serve, and by utilizing the detailed community needs assessments undertaken by public health officials and community partners, IU Health identified the following community health needs for 2013. Obesity Prevention To improve the lifestyle of Indiana residents, IU Health has utilized best practice methods to attack obesity in our communities. IU Health is working to improve access to nutritious foods and physical activity in low-income neighborhoods, in addition to providing traditional health education and public advocacy efforts. With these initiatives, IU Health strives to prevent chronic diseases such as obesity and diabetes and increase the awareness of the importance of making healthy choices, since thirty-six percent of Hoosier adults are overweight and 29.5% are obese, costing the nations billions of dollars each year to treat these chronic health conditions. Get Strong Walking Group As part of IU Health Arnett's mission to reduce area obesity rates, the free Get Walking groups were launched in 2013. IU Health Arnett hosted two walking groups every Monday from July through October. The groups met at Armstrong Park and Riehle Plaza in Lafayette and West Lafayette. The walking groups were developed to educate community members on the benefits of walking, in an encouraging atmosphere. The program was supported by the Lafayette Parks & Recreation Department as well as The Lafayette YMCA who provided certified walking instructors. IU Health Arnett physicians and Wellness Coordinators volunteered their time to provide additional resources and health screenings to participants. Twenty-eight members participated throughout the course of the program, with six improving their BMI rates and four showing reduced blood pressure after completion of the program. Day of Service In conjunction with the 2013 IU Health Day of Service, IU Health Arnett collaborated locally with the Lafayette Parks & Recreation department. More than 40 IU Health Arnett employees volunteered their time to improve walking trails, landscape, place signage and general cleanup at both Armstrong and Trailhead Parks in Tippecanoe County. Helping to improve local parks is a simple way for IU Health Arnett to encourage the local community to get out and be active! Access to Affordable Healthcare One of the first steps to improved health outcomes is having access to healthcare resources. To show its commitment to providing affordable healthcare access, IU Health Arnett treats all patients regardless of their ability to pay. IU Health Arnett is also working to raise awareness and working to identify individuals within our communities that have barriers to care and connect these individuals with better access and consistency of healthcare resources to meet their needs. K-12 Education Education plays a crucial role in health outcomes. Level of education has an impact not only on personal health, but it has multigenerational implications as well. Children with a solid educational foundation and parents who are involved in their education are more likely to embrace healthy lifestyles and habits and succeed generally in life. Additionally, research from The National Center for Public Policy and Higher Education shows that greater educational attainment is associated with health-promoting behaviors, such as increased consumption of fruits and vegetables and other aspects of healthy eating; engaging in physical activity and refraining from smoking. Realizing that educational disparities appear early, IU Health is committed to enhancing childhood education to improve health and lifelong quality of life. Kindergarten Countdown Kindergarten Countdown is a free, four-week summer camp, sponsored by IU Health Arnett. The United Way of Greater Lafayette and IU Health Arnett piloted this program at Miller Elementary during the summer of 2011. Kindergarten Countdown is designed to prepare children with little to no preschool experience for their new roles as kindergarten students. The camp is taught by licensed, experienced teachers and takes place in a school setting. Students attend school for half a day to adjust to the routines and procedures of kindergarten to help them transition into school. IU Health Arnett supports Kindergarten Countdown as a community initiative to strengthen K-12 education. Since launching the program, IU Health Arnett has provided volunteers, school supplies and books to approximately 200 area children who participate in the program each year. Read to Succeed As part of its commitment to education and the community, IU Health Arnett continues to provide volunteers for the Read to Succeed program. This program is a partnership between three public school corporations, Greater Lafayette Commerce and the United Way of Greater Lafayette. The program's goal is to ensure that every third-grader leaves third grade reading at grade level or better. This age is the point when students shift from learning to read toward reading to learn. Without these skills, students get further behind each year, and they are dramatically more likely to drop out of school. This program was developed to help children in the community succeed. IU Health Arnett encourages employees to volunteer for this program weekly throughout the school year. Nearly 15 schools in the Lafayette area participated in 2013, and more than 4,000 local children benefited from the program."
