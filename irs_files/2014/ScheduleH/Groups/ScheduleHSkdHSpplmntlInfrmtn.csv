The purpose of the assessment was to gather information about local health needs and health behaviors. The Cooper Board of Trustees met on December 19, 2013 to review the findings of the CHNA and the recommended implementation strategy. The board voted to adopt the final summary report and the implementation strategy and provide the necessary resources and support to carry out the initiatives therein. Question 3: The Camden, Burlington, and Gloucester County Health Departments participated in the design and completion of Cooper's Community Health Needs Assessment, including meetings to identify and prioritize health needs. In addition, Cooper conducted a survey among our ""key informants"". Key informants were defined as community stakeholders with expert knowledge including public health and health care professionals, social service providers, non-profit leaders, business leaders, faith-based organizations, and other area authorities. An on-line survey tool gathered qualitative feedback from 113 key informants regarding preceptions of community needs and strengths across 3 key domains: - key health issues - health care access - challenges and solutions Question 4: The Tri-County (Burlington, Camden, and Gloucester Counties) Health Assessment Collaborative included the following partners: Cooper University Health Care, Kennedy Health System, Lourdes Health System, Inspira Medical Center-Woodbury, Virtua Health, and the Health Departments of Burlington, Camden and Gloucester Counties. Question 7: Rationale for community health needs not specifically addressed: Cooper recognizes that partnerships with community agencies have the broadest reach to improve community health issues. Cooper will not have a specific focus on the following need: Overweight/Obesity. Cooper will work to address overweight and obesity through the strategies within access to care and chronic disease management by offering supportive programs promoting nutrition and an increase in physical activity through the hospital and primary care physicians. The need is also better addressed by primary care physicians, community organizations and schools and Cooper will support and collaborate with these groups in efforts to address this need."

The principal investigator provided oversight to the surveying process including data collection and entry. This assessment marked the first use of online survey collection. The Coalition decided to use this technology to enable cross-tabulations of data at a level not previously available. This report was compiled and verified for accuracy by members of the Kanawha Coalition for Community Health Improvement. This survey sample size results in a statistically significant 95% confidence interval with an error of margin of plus or minus 6.08%. Not all respondents answered every question therefore the margin of error was adjusted and reported for each question, based on the number of respondents. An independent sampling firm randomly selected landline telephone numbers for Kanawha County households. The random landline sample consisted of 4,000 numbers which was screened for disconnects, resulting in a list of 2,378 numbers. Twenty volunteers were recruited and trained in how to administer the phone survey.After learning that that the number of American homes with only wireless telephones continues to grow and that more than one of every four American homes (26.6%) had only wireless telephones (January-June 2010 National Health Interview Survey), the Kanawha Coalition acquired a second random sample of 5,000 wireless telephone numbers for Kanawha County. The wireless sample received postcards in the mail directing them to the online survey or to call the Kanawha Coalition to arrange a convenient time to take the survey by telephone. The wireless sample also received text messages to their cellular phones encouraging them to visit the Coalition's website to take the online survey. As with any telephone survey, there are certain limitations. The result of the survey depends on the accuracy of the responses given by the persons interviewed. Self-reported behavior must be interpreted with caution. To assure proper sampling distribution, the demographics of the survey respondents were compared to county demographics based on 2010 U.S. Census data. This comparison reveals an over-representation of respondents who were older (over 55), Caucasian, and with higher educational attainment. There was an underrepresentation of African Americans and those with lower-education (high school or less). The Kanawha Coalition conducted focus groups among individuals from these underrepresented populations. Focus group findings are intentionally reported independently from those of the scientific random telephone survey to maintain fidelity.Focus Groups2011 Health Assessment Focus Groups were held in 2 Locations: FamilyCare and WV Health Right with a total of 12 participants. Demographics included eight female and four male; eight African American and four Caucasian; all were low income / uninsured and underinsured; 80% low educational attainment; and all were residents of both urban (Charleston) and outlying rural areas of Kanawha County. The participants provided information of the biggest health problem in Kanawha County; Barriers/Challenges/Contributors to the problems; and what they think needs to happen in Kanawha County to address these issues."

Glens Falls Hospital is also exploring partnerships to meet additional needs and to provide patients with increased access to health services. Glens Falls Hospital will not be directly addressing all the needs in regards to behavioral health and substance abuse. We are currently working to reassess the behavioral health service line to ensure long term sustainability and maximum capacity. We are addressing some of the needs thru the Medicaid Health Home initiative and the Integrated Behavioral Health in Primary Care initiative. Glens Falls Hospital is not explicitly addressing the priority area Promote Healthy Women, Infants, and Children, but is continuously working to support the needs of these patients. Through the creation of the Medical Staff Development Plan, GFH will ensure adequate resources for obstetrics and pediatrics through an emphasis on the utilization of mid-level providers and advanced practice nurses. With respect to the priority area of Promote a Healthy and Safe Environment, the majority of these focus areas are beyond the capacity and scope of expertise of GFH and the healthcare sector. Efforts to address these focus areas are better lead by policy makers and other community stakeholders through collaboration and support of the healthcare sector.

THE EXAMPLES OF THESE ARE AS FOLLOWS:- THERE DO NOT APPEAR TO BE LARGE GAPS IN THE TOPICS OR TYPES OF COMMUNITY OUTREACH PROGRAMS THAT KDH HAS CONDUCTED IN THE PAST. HOWEVER, THERE MAY BE GAPS DUE TO FUNDING LEVELS OR STAFFING LEVELS IN THE NUMBER OF PROGRAMS AND THE GEOGRAPHIC REACH OF THE PROGRAMS THAT HAVE BEEN OFFERED. UPDATE: IN 2011 IT BECAME NECESSARY TO ELIMINATE SOME OUTREACH PROGRAMS DUE TO FINANCIAL CONSIDERATIONS. UPDATE 2012: NO INCREASE IN OUTREACH OCCURRED IN 2012. UPDATE 2013: IN 2013 WE WERE ABLE TO BRING BACK SOME OF OUR OUTREACH PROGRAMS SUCH AS GIRLS ON THE RUN AND FIT KIDS IN AREA SCHOOLS. (PLEASE SEE COMMUNITY OUTREACH SUMMARY).- SOME INDIVIDUALS ALSO EXPRESSED THE IDEA THAT RESIDENTS IN THE COMMUNITY SERVED BY KDH MAY NOT BE AWARE OF THE EXISTING PROGRAMS AND SERVICES OFFERED AND MAY NOT BE AWARE OF THE LEVEL OF EXPERTISE OF THE STAFF. THESE ARE IDEAS THAT COULD BE ADDRESSED IN A STRATEGIC, WELL-PLANNED, LONG-TERM PUBLIC RELATIONS CAMPAIGN. UPDATE: FINANCIAL CONSTRAINTS HAVE ENCOURAGED US TO INCREASE AWARENESS OF PROGRAMS AND SERVICES THROUGH EXISTING RESOURCES SUCH AS THE QUARTERLY NEWSLETTER. UPDATE 2012: WE CONTINUE TO USE OUR QUARTERLY NEWSLETTER FOR AWARENESS. UPDATE 2013: WE CONTINUE TO USE MANY FORMS OF ADVERTISING TO PROMOTE COMMUNITY OUTREACH. QUARTERLY NEWSLETTERS CONTINUE, AS WELL AS MANY OTHER FORMS OF PROMOTION, SUCH AS SOCIAL MEDIA.- THE GAPS IN THE CURRENT MEDICAL SERVICE LINES AND THE MEDICAL SPECIALTIES DESIRED ARE WORTH EXPLORING.

UPDATE 2012: THE FOLLOWING ADDITIONS OCCURRED IN A VARIETY OF MEDICAL SPECIALTY SERVICES IN 2012: ADDITIONAL CARDIOLOGY SERVICES, ADDITIONAL INTERNAL MEDICINE SERVICES, ADDITIONAL ORTHOPEDIC SERVICES, AND ADDITIONAL FAMILY PRACTICE IN ONE OF OUR OUTLYING CLINICS IN KENTUCKY. UROLOGY SERVICES WERE ALSO ADDED, AS WELL AS FURTHER EXPANSION OF NEUROLOGY SERVICES. THESE CHANGES HAVE HELPED US MEET THE NEEDS OF THE AREAS WE SERVE. UPDATE 2013: IN 2013 WE WERE ABLE TO ADD THE FOLLOWING SERVICES: INPATIENT DIALYSIS, ED PSYCH ASSESSMENT, AND AN AFFILIATION WITH NORTON CANCER CENTER. OUR ORTHOPEDIC SURGEON BEGAN TO SEE PEOPLE IN RIPLEY COUNTY AT OUR CLINIC THERE. IN ADDITION IN 2013 KDH OPENED A NEW HOSPITAL WITH IMPROVED SERVICES AND IMPROVED PRIVACY FOR PATIENTS. WE ALSO ADDED ONE GENERAL SURGEON, AND ONE FAMILY PRACTITIONER.- SEVERAL OF THE TOP MAJOR COMMUNITY HEALTH CONCERNS INVOLVE ADDRESSING THE FREQUENTLY INTER-RELATED ISSUES OF OBESITY, LACK OF PHYSICAL ACTIVITY, AND SMOKING.

SJRH is an active participant in the Health Planning Team. Participating hospitals and health centers helped guide the CHNA process by providing community input into the design of its framework and implementation plan. The public input process encompassed the following primary collaborations: WCDOH's Healthy Hospital's collaborative, Health Planning Team, and Health Summit; Healthy Yonkers Initiative; SJRH Community Advisory Committee, and the maternity and HIV partnerships. WHILE SJRH COLLABORATED WITH THESE UNRELATED ORGANIZATIONS THROUGH THE CHNA PROCESS, IT DOCUMENTED ITS COMMUNITY HEALTH NEEDS ASSESSMENT IN A SEPARATE WRITTEN REPORT. SJRH has experienced significant public involvement and enthusiasm, as community relationships were fortified and new ones were established with numerous health-related associations. To ensure a broad assessment of our community health needs we engaged a variety of participants including, but not limited to, the community at large through local residents participating in SJRH Speakers Bureau health education programs. We shared health data and sought feedback through the following SJRH groups: Community Advisory Committee, Employee Wellness Committee, Pastoral Care Committee, Radiology Advisory Committee, Physician Alignment Committee, Board of Trustees and our employees. SJRH also gathered information from external sources by conducting public forums at the Cross County Shopping Center in Yonkers, New York and other health sessions held at select locations to address the community that represented the diverse population that we serve. The hospital receives input from the community and patients through periodic focus groups, patient satisfaction surveys, sent by a third party provider and on-line surveys. Patient experience feedback is also captured through traditional compliment and complaint letters received through administration. SJRH'S 2013 COMMUNITY HEALTH NEEDS ASSESSMENT WAS CONDUCTED TO INCLUDE ITS THREE RELATED HOSPITAL FACILITIES (SJR HOSPITAL ANDRUS PAVILION, SJR PARK CARE PAVILION, AND SJR DOBBS FERRY PAVILION), AND A JOINT REPORT WAS ISSUED.

To this end, all groups were consulted in its development phase. Thirteen members of the community, including Public and Patient Education Department and Department of Social Work Programs participants and members of the Carter Burden and Mott Street Senior Centers, provided feedback on survey construction and length in late January and early February 2013, mainly through one-on-one interviews. In addition, the Hospital was careful to elicit public input about survey translations to ensure that they were culturally relevant; health literacy considerations were also taken into account. Internal stakeholders and community partners provided valuable feedback about survey construction, the use of validated measures, cultural relevance, health literacy and survey gaps via extensive phone conversations, emails and in- person discussions. All feedback was aggregated and used to adjust survey questions, construction and cultural relevance. Below outlines the community partners involved in survey construction: - Arthritis Foundation - New York Chapter - Sharon Jaycox-Daitz, MS, Regional Vice President, Northeast Programs; Kate Anastasia, MPA, Regional Director of Programs - Charles B.

Relevant national, state and city health data and needs assessment results were also utilized to drive community programming. - Input from Internal Stakeholders: Internal meetings were held with various parties within the Hospital (HSS Departments of Public and Patient Education, Social Work Programs, Nursing, Nutrition, and Rehabilitation) to discuss identified health priorities and explore areas for implementing initiatives, using results from the CHNA and stakeholders' awareness of community needs to guide the discussion. The group discussed focusing on increasing access to high quality, culturally relevant chronic disease preventive care and management of musculoskeletal and rheumatologic conditions and reducing obesity in adults and children, which aligns with the New York State Department of Health's Community Service Plan priority areas. - Input from the General Public: A public forum was held in May 2013 to allow members of the community an opportunity to discuss how the Hospital could prioritize community health needs. The public expressed the need for programs that improve diet and physical activity and empower the community to prevent and manage their musculoskeletal and rheumatologic conditions. Furthermore, community members agreed that HSS should focus on developing strong programs and services aimed at reducing obesity and increasing access to high quality chronic disease preventive care and management in clinical and community settings. - Community Partner Feedback: Feedback from community partner organizations was critical to driving the selection of public health priorities for the Hospital. Using results of the CHNA as the basis for discussion, HSS and its partners exchanged valuable information regarding community needs, explored areas for future collaboration, and solidified a mutual commitment to advancing public health. Furthermore, community partner knowledge of their respective community helped to identify gaps in community programming - or more specifically, areas where HSS could use its areas of expertise to make a lasting public health impact. Overall, feedback from these meetings solidified the direction for programs that improve the community's diet and increase physical activity to combat obesity among children and adults, examine specific communities in need of chronic disease preventive care and management (including older adults, diverse communities and lower-income groups), and provide culturally-relevant education regarding musculoskeletal and rheumatologic issues. Additionally, the Hospital met with the Greater New York Hospital Association (GNYHA), a trade association, and regulatory agencies to inform the structure and process for selecting its public health priorities. The Hospital also attended executive briefings regarding plans and updates to the NYC DOHMH Take Care New York health policy on February 20th and July 19th, 2013, meetings which were facilitated by GNYHA, to ensure the Hospital's priority/focus areas are aligned with state and local health department goals."

201403219349306015,362167800,"PART V, SECTION B, LINE 3","A community health needs assessment (CHNA) is a collaborative community process of identifying and prioritizing a community's health needs, accomplished through the collection and analysis of data, including input from community stakeholders. In July 2012, a CHNA Steering Committee was formed to represent stakeholders within the PSFH community, as well as to provide oversight and input throughout the CHNA process. The committee's role is also to assist in the identification of data-driven community priorities and to engage stakeholders in community solutions through partnerships and collaboration. By taking on a community approach to both the assessment and implementation strategies, the goal is to ensure the data, processes, and outputs add value to all community partners, not just the hospital. Engagement of Public Health Expertise Presence Health formally engaged the Illinois Public Health Institute (IPHI) for assistance in planning and executing the CHNA process. IPHI served as an expert public health consultant throughout the CHNA timeline. Further, IPHI provided invaluable assistance in obtaining partnerships with the local and county Health Departments. Given the vast number of county hospitals served by the same Health Department in Cook County, resource allocation was difficult to obtain. As such, IPHI functioned as a liaison role between Presence Health and the Health Departments so as to obtain engagement through public data sharing and linkages with implementation plans. Conversations were facilitated between the Cook County Department of Public Health so as to continually inform all parties of CHNA process inputs and obtain both feedback and support. CHNA Steering Committee To provide community level oversight for the process, a diverse group of community stakeholders and Presence Saint Francis Hospital representatives from its service area (Evanston, Rogers Park, and West Ridge) were invited to participate on the CHNA Steering Committee. To ensure representative engagement, personal invitations were sent to organizations representing cultural, linguistic, racial, ethnic, and other minority groups. In addition, individuals with specialized qualifications in dealing with special populations or clinical groups were solicited for their participation. Finally, efforts were made to include individuals on the CHNA Steering Committee with public health expertise. Those who committed to the assessment and planning process became the 23 members of the CHNA Steering Committee, which continues to meet regularly to provide feedback and oversight, assess progress, and modify plans as needed. The agencies represented on the CHNA Steering Committee are listed below: -Oakton School PTA -Cook County Commissioner Larry Suffredin's Office -Presence Saint Francis Hospital -St. Hillary Catholic Church -Holmestead Communications -Former Evanston Police Chief -PEER Services, Inc. -Trilogy -Former Evanston Mayor -Consortium to Lower Obesity in Chicago Children (CLOCC) -McGaw YMCA -Rogers Park Business Alliance -CJE SeniorLife -Howard Area Community Center -ACCESS Community Health Network -Evanston Health Department -Saint Nicholas -Evanston/Skokie School District 65 Community Health Profile The Community Health Profile is a compilation of secondary data (data already published and available) about a particular community. The profile provides comparative information to assist in understanding the needs and priorities of a community. The Community Health Profile for PSFH analyzed over 50 indicators. Example indicators include: population trends, race, income, poverty levels, and percentage of uninsured, health professional shortages, leading causes of death, teen births, birth weights, tobacco use, physical activity, crime rates, and food insecurity. The Community Health Profile can be found online at www.presencehealth.org/community. Community Input Report The community input process was completed between August and October 2012. The process included creating and administering a community input survey in Spanish, Polish and Russian as well as English, facilitating three focus groups, and completing an asset and resources inventory. The community survey explored residents' perceptions of issues surrounding quality of life, health, and social factors and collected respondents' demographics including insurance coverage. Nine hundred twenty-one (921) community residents completed the survey. The Community Input Report can be found online at www.presencehealth.org/community. In conjunction with the CHNA Steering Committee and numerous community stakeholders, an inventory of community assets was then conducted so as to determine existing health resources that could be built upon or collaborated with to conduct the work of PSFH's ministry. The Community Asset Matrix can be found in Appendix 1 of the Community Input Report online at www.presencehealth.org/community."

This document, a consolidated, multi-year, multi-agency,community-wide plan for action to improve the health of people in Schenectady, New York is the result of the combined efforts of 62 organizations. The Schenectady Coalition for a Healthy Community,informed by multiple credible data sources including a door-to-door survey of community residents,developed this assessment and plan to serve the people of the City and County of Schenectady. Ellis worked with the Schenectady County Public Health Services, the Schenectady County Department of Social Services, the University at Albany School of Public Health, the public health program at Union Graduate College, and he Mayor of the City of Schenectady. UMatter Schenectady was a carefully designed, face-to-face city-wide survey of health concerns funded by The Schenectady Foundation and the Carlilian Foundation with direct assistance from SCPHS (which provided the services of its medical consultant to provide survey analysis and participate in writing of this document),Schenectady Community Action Program (SCAP) (which recruited and coordinated Community Health Workers), several local colleges an universities (which provided student volunteers and faculty assistance), and Ellis Medicine(which administered the survey-taking and provided the services of its epidemiologist). Other local organizations facilitated data collection, including the Schenectady Municipal Housing Authority (which allowed use of its facilities) and the Mayor of the City of Schenectady, whopersonally accompanied the door-to-door surveyors on several occasions. The survey was designed by team of epidemiologists from Ellis and the University at Albanys School of Public Health, working in consultation with a subcommittee of the Schenectady Coalition. Inspired byneighborhood-based health needs surveys conducted in Chicago for over a decade, the Schenectady project completed 2,229 surveys which, depending on branching from certain responses, covered as many as 283 questions. The sampling frames were designed to oversample the least affluent and most underserved neighborhoods and ZIP codes to assure that we heard the voices of those often missed in phone surveys. Responses were captured on iPads and directly loaded to a cloud-based database using the internet at the point of survey.

To this end, all groups were consulted in its development phase. Thirteen members of the community, including Public and Patient Education Department and Department of Social Work Programs participants and members of the Carter Burden and Mott Street Senior Centers, provided feedback on survey construction and length in late January and early February 2013, mainly through one-on-one interviews. In addition, the Hospital was careful to elicit public input about survey translations to ensure that they were culturally relevant; health literacy considerations were also taken into account. Internal stakeholders and community partners provided valuable feedback about survey construction, the use of validated measures, cultural relevance, health literacy and survey gaps via extensive phone conversations, emails and in- person discussions. All feedback was aggregated and used to adjust survey questions, construction and cultural relevance. Below outlines the community partners involved in survey construction: - Arthritis Foundation - New York Chapter - Sharon Jaycox-Daitz, MS, Regional Vice President, Northeast Programs; Kate Anastasia, MPA, Regional Director of Programs - Charles B.

Relevant national, state and city health data and needs assessment results were also utilized to drive community programming. - Input from Internal Stakeholders: Internal meetings were held with various parties within the Hospital (HSS Departments of Public and Patient Education, Social Work Programs, Nursing, Nutrition, and Rehabilitation) to discuss identified health priorities and explore areas for implementing initiatives, using results from the CHNA and stakeholders' awareness of community needs to guide the discussion. The group discussed focusing on increasing access to high quality, culturally relevant chronic disease preventive care and management of musculoskeletal and rheumatologic conditions and reducing obesity in adults and children, which aligns with the New York State Department of Health's Community Service Plan priority areas. - Input from the General Public: A public forum was held in May 2013 to allow members of the community an opportunity to discuss how the Hospital could prioritize community health needs. The public expressed the need for programs that improve diet and physical activity and empower the community to prevent and manage their musculoskeletal and rheumatologic conditions. Furthermore, community members agreed that HSS should focus on developing strong programs and services aimed at reducing obesity and increasing access to high quality chronic disease preventive care and management in clinical and community settings. - Community Partner Feedback: Feedback from community partner organizations was critical to driving the selection of public health priorities for the Hospital. Using results of the CHNA as the basis for discussion, HSS and its partners exchanged valuable information regarding community needs, explored areas for future collaboration, and solidified a mutual commitment to advancing public health. Furthermore, community partner knowledge of their respective community helped to identify gaps in community programming - or more specifically, areas where HSS could use its areas of expertise to make a lasting public health impact. Overall, feedback from these meetings solidified the direction for programs that improve the community's diet and increase physical activity to combat obesity among children and adults, examine specific communities in need of chronic disease preventive care and management (including older adults, diverse communities and lower-income groups), and provide culturally-relevant education regarding musculoskeletal and rheumatologic issues. Additionally, the Hospital met with the Greater New York Hospital Association (GNYHA), a trade association, and regulatory agencies to inform the structure and process for selecting its public health priorities. The Hospital also attended executive briefings regarding plans and updates to the NYC DOHMH Take Care New York health policy on February 20th and July 19th, 2013, meetings which were facilitated by GNYHA, to ensure the Hospital's priority/focus areas are aligned with state and local health department goals."

Within these four priority areas, many of the other health indicators i.e. diabetes, womens health, mens health and hypertension also fell within these priorities and will continue to be addressed internally or with our collaborative partners. Needs not addressed are related to safety and social indicators/issues, such as issues pertaining to guns and violence, helping residents pay rent and/or utilities, providing emergency shelter, clothing, legal services, and tax preparation.

There may be times, such as very late in the evening or very early morning, when all self pay patients are not seen face-to-face before they are discharged. However, there are phone attempts and letters mailed to these patients to explain financial assistance and attempt completion of the financial assistance application. The front of every patient billing statement references assistance for amounts not covered by insurance to those individuals whose income is below the established poverty level. There are telephone numbers for customer service, with service hours, and an email address provided on the front of every patient billing statement. On the back of every patient billing statement is the financial assistance application with the federal poverty guidelines.

IN 2013, REGIONS:- DEVELOPED ELECTRONIC MEDICAL RECORD EMERGENCY DEPARTMENT CARE PLANS: AN EMERGENCY DEPARTMENT-BASED CARE PLAN IS CREATED FOR IDENTIFIED PATIENTS WITH HIGH RATES OF UNNECESSARY EMERGENCY DEPARTMENT (ED) VISITS AND ADMISSIONS. ALL CARE PLANS ARE VIEWABLE TO ALL HOSPITAL CARE PROVIDERS, INCLUDING EMERGENCY DEPARTMENT PROVIDERS, HOSPITALISTS, AND PRIMARY CARE PHYSICIANS WITHIN THE SYSTEM.- PROVIDED CARE MANAGER OUTREACH TO PATIENTS: A CARE MANAGER IS AVAILABLE TO PROVIDE FACE-TO-FACE OR TELEPHONIC EDUCATION AND FOLLOW UP FOR PATIENTS USING THE EMERGENCY DEPARTMENT FOR NON-EMERGENT REASONS.- FUNDED A COMMUNITY PARAMEDIC DEVELOPMENT PROGRAM: THE COMMUNITY PARAMEDIC, UNDER THE ORDERS OF A PHYSICIAN, WILL MAKE ONE OR MORE HOME VISITS TO IDENTIFIED PATIENTS TO SUPPORT CLINICAL STABILIZATION, PATIENT EDUCATION, AND PREVENT UNNECESSARY HOSPITAL READMISSIONS AND EMERGENCY DEPARTMENT VISITS.- DEVELOPED AN ELECTRONIC MEDICAL RECORD ED VISIT DATA FEED TO PRIMARY CARE PROVIDERS: WITHIN 24 HOURS OF AN EMERGENCY DEPARTMENT VISIT, THE VISIT INFORMATION IS SENT ELECTRONICALLY TO THE APPLICABLE PRIMARY CARE PROVIDER. IT DEVELOPMENT WORK WAS REQUIRED IN ORDER TO DESIGN AND IMPLEMENT THIS ELECTRONIC FEED TO PRIMARY CARE CLINICS. WORK CLOSELY WITH COMMUNITY CLINICSREGIONS WORKED CLOSELY WITH COMMUNITY CLINIC PARTNERS IN THE SERVICE AREA ON CONTINUITY OF CARE AND LINKAGES TO REGIONS, AS PART OF THE EAST METRO SAFETY NET. HEALTHPARTNERS MEDICAL GROUP PHYSICIANS CONTINUE TO PROVIDE ON CALL SERVICES FOR THESE CLINICS WHEN THEIR PATIENTS ARE HOSPITALIZED AT REGIONS.REGIONS CONDUCTED A TELEMEDICINE SERVICES PILOT TO ASSIST SMALL HOSPITALS AND RURAL COMMUNITIES TO INCREASE ACCESS TO CLINICAL EXPERTISE IN SELECT SUBSPECIALTY AREAS. BASED ON COMMUNITY CLINIC FEEDBACK, REGIONS IDENTIFIED THE NEED TO PROVIDE MORE STREAMLINED AND TIMELY ACCESS TO A PATIENT'S RECORD ONCE A PATIENT RECEIVED CARE AT REGIONS AND SUBSEQUENTLY RETURNED TO THEIR HOME CLINICS (BASED ON PATIENT'S PERMISSION). REGIONS HAS COMMITTED AND IS IN THE PROCESS OF IMPLEMENTING A NEW PORTAL THAT WILL PROVIDE EASIER ACCESS TO THE PATIENT'S ELECTRONIC HEALTH RECORD. THIS PORTAL WILL PROVIDE SECURE ACCESS WITHOUT THE NEED OF AN ADDITIONAL SECURITY TOKEN VIA THE INTERNET. PATIENTS WHO IDENTIFY A PHYSICIAN OR CLINIC IN THE COMMUNITY WILL BE PUBLISHED TO THEIR LIST OF PATIENTS FOR EASE OF SELECTION. THIS PORTAL WILL BE UP AND AVAILABLE IN FEBRUARY 2014 FOR THE PILOT CLINICS. ADDITIONAL CLINICS WILL BE ROLLED OUT ONCE THE PILOT CLINICS ARE DEEMED SUCCESSFUL.CARE MANAGEMENTREGIONS ACTIVELY LEADS IN THE COMPANY-WIDE CARE MANAGEMENT TRANSFORMATION EFFORTS. THIS WORK INTENDS TO IMPROVE HEALTH OUTCOMES AND THE EXPERIENCE FOR PATIENTS WITH CHRONIC OR COMPLEX CONDITIONS BY INTEGRATING SERVICES AND SMOOTHING HANDOVERS AND TRANSITIONS. REGIONS CONVENED AN INTERDISCIPLINARY COMMITTEE THAT MEETS MONTHLY TO ADDRESS ED VISITS AND HOSPITAL ADMISSIONS. CARE PLANS ARE IMPLEMENTED ON PATIENTS CONSIDERED HIGH RISK INCLUDING THOSE WITH NARCOTIC ABUSING/SEEKING BEHAVIOR AND THOSE WITH HIGH RATES OF POTENTIALLY MEDICALLY UNNECESSARY ED VISITS. REGIONS DATA SHOWS THE IMPACT ON COMPLIANCE AND LIMITING ED VISITS AND HOSPITAL ADMISSIONS. IN 2013, REGIONS HAD 34 PATIENTS WITH A CARE PLAN IN PLACE. ED VISITS DECREASED BY 17.95% WITH THIS GROUP AND ADMISSIONS DECREASED BY 54.79%. ALSO IMBEDDED IN THE ED ARE CARE MANAGERS WHO PROVIDE EDUCATION AND SUPPORT TO PATIENTS, CONNECT THEM TO PRIMARY CARE AND TO COMMUNITY RESOURCES. IN ADDITION, GEOGRAPHIC STUDIES WERE COMPLETED AND WE ARE PARTNERING WITH COMMUNITY PARAMEDICS IN NEIGHBORHOODS WHERE WE SEE A HIGH UTILIZATION OF THE EMERGENCY DEPARTMENT.MANY EFFORTS ARE IN PLACE TO MANAGE RISK OF READMISSION. AN ALGORITHM WAS BUILT TO ASSIGN A SCORE TO PATIENTS REPRESENTING THEIR RISK FOR RISK FOR READMISSION. THIS SCORE, ALONG WITH OTHER CRITERIA, IS USED BY CARE MANAGEMENT STAFF AND PHYSICIANS TO PUT IN PLACE ACTIVITIES TO MANAGE THE RISK. HOSPITAL CARE MANAGEMENT WORKS CLOSELY WITH THE HEALTH PLAN DISEASE AND CASE MANAGEMENT STAFF TO ENSURE HIGH RISK PATIENTS ARE BEING FOLLOWED OUTSIDE THE HOSPITAL. HOSPITAL CARE MANAGEMENT ALSO WORKS CLOSELY WITH GERIATRICS, HOSPICE AND HOME CARE TO ESTABLISH SMOOTH TRANSITIONS AND EXCHANGE OF INFORMATION. REGULAR MEETINGS TAKE PLACE WITH TCU'S, LTAC'S, SNF'S AND OTHER FACILITIES TO ESTABLISH AND MAINTAIN PROCESSES THAT SUPPORT EFFICIENT AND EFFECTIVE TRANSITIONS TO AND FROM THE ACUTE CARE SETTING. .

Question 7: Rationale for community health needs not specifically addressed: Cooper recognizes that partnerships with community agencies have the broadest reach to improve community health issues. Cooper will not have a specific focus on the following need: Overweight/Obesity. Cooper will work to address overweight and obesity through the strategies within access to care and chronic disease management by offering supportive programs promoting nutrition and an increase in physical activity through the hospital and primary care physicians. The need is also better addressed by primary care physicians, community organizations and schools and Cooper will support and collaborate with these groups in efforts to address this need."

The principal investigator provided oversight to the surveying process including data collection and entry. This assessment marked the first use of online survey collection. The Coalition decided to use this technology to enable cross-tabulations of data at a level not previously available. This report was compiled and verified for accuracy by members of the Kanawha Coalition for Community Health Improvement. This survey sample size results in a statistically significant 95% confidence interval with an error of margin of plus or minus 6.08%. Not all respondents answered every question therefore the margin of error was adjusted and reported for each question, based on the number of respondents. An independent sampling firm randomly selected landline telephone numbers for Kanawha County households. The random landline sample consisted of 4,000 numbers which was screened for disconnects, resulting in a list of 2,378 numbers. Twenty volunteers were recruited and trained in how to administer the phone survey.After learning that that the number of American homes with only wireless telephones continues to grow and that more than one of every four American homes (26.6%) had only wireless telephones (January-June 2010 National Health Interview Survey), the Kanawha Coalition acquired a second random sample of 5,000 wireless telephone numbers for Kanawha County. The wireless sample received postcards in the mail directing them to the online survey or to call the Kanawha Coalition to arrange a convenient time to take the survey by telephone. The wireless sample also received text messages to their cellular phones encouraging them to visit the Coalition's website to take the online survey. As with any telephone survey, there are certain limitations. The result of the survey depends on the accuracy of the responses given by the persons interviewed. Self-reported behavior must be interpreted with caution. To assure proper sampling distribution, the demographics of the survey respondents were compared to county demographics based on 2010 U.S. Census data. This comparison reveals an over-representation of respondents who were older (over 55), Caucasian, and with higher educational attainment. There was an underrepresentation of African Americans and those with lower-education (high school or less). The Kanawha Coalition conducted focus groups among individuals from these underrepresented populations. Focus group findings are intentionally reported independently from those of the scientific random telephone survey to maintain fidelity.Focus Groups2011 Health Assessment Focus Groups were held in 2 Locations: FamilyCare and WV Health Right with a total of 12 participants. Demographics included eight female and four male; eight African American and four Caucasian; all were low income / uninsured and underinsured; 80% low educational attainment; and all were residents of both urban (Charleston) and outlying rural areas of Kanawha County. The participants provided information of the biggest health problem in Kanawha County; Barriers/Challenges/Contributors to the problems; and what they think needs to happen in Kanawha County to address these issues."

Glens Falls Hospital is also exploring partnerships to meet additional needs and to provide patients with increased access to health services. Glens Falls Hospital will not be directly addressing all the needs in regards to behavioral health and substance abuse. We are currently working to reassess the behavioral health service line to ensure long term sustainability and maximum capacity. We are addressing some of the needs thru the Medicaid Health Home initiative and the Integrated Behavioral Health in Primary Care initiative. Glens Falls Hospital is not explicitly addressing the priority area Promote Healthy Women, Infants, and Children, but is continuously working to support the needs of these patients. Through the creation of the Medical Staff Development Plan, GFH will ensure adequate resources for obstetrics and pediatrics through an emphasis on the utilization of mid-level providers and advanced practice nurses. With respect to the priority area of Promote a Healthy and Safe Environment, the majority of these focus areas are beyond the capacity and scope of expertise of GFH and the healthcare sector. Efforts to address these focus areas are better lead by policy makers and other community stakeholders through collaboration and support of the healthcare sector.

THE EXAMPLES OF THESE ARE AS FOLLOWS:- THERE DO NOT APPEAR TO BE LARGE GAPS IN THE TOPICS OR TYPES OF COMMUNITY OUTREACH PROGRAMS THAT KDH HAS CONDUCTED IN THE PAST. HOWEVER, THERE MAY BE GAPS DUE TO FUNDING LEVELS OR STAFFING LEVELS IN THE NUMBER OF PROGRAMS AND THE GEOGRAPHIC REACH OF THE PROGRAMS THAT HAVE BEEN OFFERED. UPDATE: IN 2011 IT BECAME NECESSARY TO ELIMINATE SOME OUTREACH PROGRAMS DUE TO FINANCIAL CONSIDERATIONS. UPDATE 2012: NO INCREASE IN OUTREACH OCCURRED IN 2012. UPDATE 2013: IN 2013 WE WERE ABLE TO BRING BACK SOME OF OUR OUTREACH PROGRAMS SUCH AS GIRLS ON THE RUN AND FIT KIDS IN AREA SCHOOLS. (PLEASE SEE COMMUNITY OUTREACH SUMMARY).- SOME INDIVIDUALS ALSO EXPRESSED THE IDEA THAT RESIDENTS IN THE COMMUNITY SERVED BY KDH MAY NOT BE AWARE OF THE EXISTING PROGRAMS AND SERVICES OFFERED AND MAY NOT BE AWARE OF THE LEVEL OF EXPERTISE OF THE STAFF. THESE ARE IDEAS THAT COULD BE ADDRESSED IN A STRATEGIC, WELL-PLANNED, LONG-TERM PUBLIC RELATIONS CAMPAIGN. UPDATE: FINANCIAL CONSTRAINTS HAVE ENCOURAGED US TO INCREASE AWARENESS OF PROGRAMS AND SERVICES THROUGH EXISTING RESOURCES SUCH AS THE QUARTERLY NEWSLETTER. UPDATE 2012: WE CONTINUE TO USE OUR QUARTERLY NEWSLETTER FOR AWARENESS. UPDATE 2013: WE CONTINUE TO USE MANY FORMS OF ADVERTISING TO PROMOTE COMMUNITY OUTREACH. QUARTERLY NEWSLETTERS CONTINUE, AS WELL AS MANY OTHER FORMS OF PROMOTION, SUCH AS SOCIAL MEDIA.- THE GAPS IN THE CURRENT MEDICAL SERVICE LINES AND THE MEDICAL SPECIALTIES DESIRED ARE WORTH EXPLORING. HOWEVER, THIS ANALYSIS FOCUSES ONLY ON EXPRESSED NEEDS AND DOES NOT CONTAIN PATIENT PROJECTION INFORMATION OR FINANCIAL ANALYSIS FOR A BUSINESS CASE ANALYSIS. UPDATE: THE FOLLOWING ADDITIONS OCCURRED IN A VARIETY OF MEDICAL SPECIALTY SERVICES IN 2011: ADDITION OF NEUROLOGY SERVICES IN MADISON, THE EXPANSION OF NEPHROLOGY SERVICES IN MADISON, THE EXTENSION OF OFFICE HOURS IN SOME PHYSICIAN PRACTICES, AND THE EXPANSION OF LABORATORY AND IMAGING SERVICES IN OUR CONVENIENT CARE CENTER. UPDATE 2012: THE FOLLOWING ADDITIONS OCCURRED IN A VARIETY OF MEDICAL SPECIALTY SERVICES IN 2012: ADDITIONAL CARDIOLOGY SERVICES, ADDITIONAL INTERNAL MEDICINE SERVICES, ADDITIONAL ORTHOPEDIC SERVICES, AND ADDITIONAL FAMILY PRACTICE IN ONE OF OUR OUTLYING CLINICS IN KENTUCKY. UROLOGY SERVICES WERE ALSO ADDED, AS WELL AS FURTHER EXPANSION OF NEUROLOGY SERVICES. THESE CHANGES HAVE HELPED US MEET THE NEEDS OF THE AREAS WE SERVE. UPDATE 2013: IN 2013 WE WERE ABLE TO ADD THE FOLLOWING SERVICES: INPATIENT DIALYSIS, ED PSYCH ASSESSMENT, AND AN AFFILIATION WITH NORTON CANCER CENTER. OUR ORTHOPEDIC SURGEON BEGAN TO SEE PEOPLE IN RIPLEY COUNTY AT OUR CLINIC THERE. IN ADDITION IN 2013 KDH OPENED A NEW HOSPITAL WITH IMPROVED SERVICES AND IMPROVED PRIVACY FOR PATIENTS. WE ALSO ADDED ONE GENERAL SURGEON, AND ONE FAMILY PRACTITIONER.- SEVERAL OF THE TOP MAJOR COMMUNITY HEALTH CONCERNS INVOLVE ADDRESSING THE FREQUENTLY INTER-RELATED ISSUES OF OBESITY, LACK OF PHYSICAL ACTIVITY, AND SMOKING. THESE HEALTH ISSUES LEAD TO CHRONIC DISEASE AND HAVE AN IMPACT ON PATIENTS SERVED BY KDH FACILITIES.

SJRH is an active participant in the Health Planning Team. Participating hospitals and health centers helped guide the CHNA process by providing community input into the design of its framework and implementation plan. The public input process encompassed the following primary collaborations: WCDOH's Healthy Hospital's collaborative, Health Planning Team, and Health Summit; Healthy Yonkers Initiative; SJRH Community Advisory Committee, and the maternity and HIV partnerships. WHILE SJRH COLLABORATED WITH THESE UNRELATED ORGANIZATIONS THROUGH THE CHNA PROCESS, IT DOCUMENTED ITS COMMUNITY HEALTH NEEDS ASSESSMENT IN A SEPARATE WRITTEN REPORT. SJRH has experienced significant public involvement and enthusiasm, as community relationships were fortified and new ones were established with numerous health-related associations. To ensure a broad assessment of our community health needs we engaged a variety of participants including, but not limited to, the community at large through local residents participating in SJRH Speakers Bureau health education programs. We shared health data and sought feedback through the following SJRH groups: Community Advisory Committee, Employee Wellness Committee, Pastoral Care Committee, Radiology Advisory Committee, Physician Alignment Committee, Board of Trustees and our employees. SJRH also gathered information from external sources by conducting public forums at the Cross County Shopping Center in Yonkers, New York and other health sessions held at select locations to address the community that represented the diverse population that we serve. The hospital receives input from the community and patients through periodic focus groups, patient satisfaction surveys, sent by a third party provider and on-line surveys. Patient experience feedback is also captured through traditional compliment and complaint letters received through administration. SJRH'S 2013 COMMUNITY HEALTH NEEDS ASSESSMENT WAS CONDUCTED TO INCLUDE ITS THREE RELATED HOSPITAL FACILITIES (SJR HOSPITAL ANDRUS PAVILION, SJR PARK CARE PAVILION, AND SJR DOBBS FERRY PAVILION), AND A JOINT REPORT WAS ISSUED.

To this end, all groups were consulted in its development phase. Thirteen members of the community, including Public and Patient Education Department and Department of Social Work Programs participants and members of the Carter Burden and Mott Street Senior Centers, provided feedback on survey construction and length in late January and early February 2013, mainly through one-on-one interviews. In addition, the Hospital was careful to elicit public input about survey translations to ensure that they were culturally relevant; health literacy considerations were also taken into account. Internal stakeholders and community partners provided valuable feedback about survey construction, the use of validated measures, cultural relevance, health literacy and survey gaps via extensive phone conversations, emails and in- person discussions. All feedback was aggregated and used to adjust survey questions, construction and cultural relevance. Below outlines the community partners involved in survey construction: - Arthritis Foundation - New York Chapter - Sharon Jaycox-Daitz, MS, Regional Vice President, Northeast Programs; Kate Anastasia, MPA, Regional Director of Programs - Charles B.

Relevant national, state and city health data and needs assessment results were also utilized to drive community programming. - Input from Internal Stakeholders: Internal meetings were held with various parties within the Hospital (HSS Departments of Public and Patient Education, Social Work Programs, Nursing, Nutrition, and Rehabilitation) to discuss identified health priorities and explore areas for implementing initiatives, using results from the CHNA and stakeholders' awareness of community needs to guide the discussion. The group discussed focusing on increasing access to high quality, culturally relevant chronic disease preventive care and management of musculoskeletal and rheumatologic conditions and reducing obesity in adults and children, which aligns with the New York State Department of Health's Community Service Plan priority areas. - Input from the General Public: A public forum was held in May 2013 to allow members of the community an opportunity to discuss how the Hospital could prioritize community health needs. The public expressed the need for programs that improve diet and physical activity and empower the community to prevent and manage their musculoskeletal and rheumatologic conditions. Furthermore, community members agreed that HSS should focus on developing strong programs and services aimed at reducing obesity and increasing access to high quality chronic disease preventive care and management in clinical and community settings. - Community Partner Feedback: Feedback from community partner organizations was critical to driving the selection of public health priorities for the Hospital. Using results of the CHNA as the basis for discussion, HSS and its partners exchanged valuable information regarding community needs, explored areas for future collaboration, and solidified a mutual commitment to advancing public health. Furthermore, community partner knowledge of their respective community helped to identify gaps in community programming - or more specifically, areas where HSS could use its areas of expertise to make a lasting public health impact. Overall, feedback from these meetings solidified the direction for programs that improve the community's diet and increase physical activity to combat obesity among children and adults, examine specific communities in need of chronic disease preventive care and management (including older adults, diverse communities and lower-income groups), and provide culturally-relevant education regarding musculoskeletal and rheumatologic issues. Additionally, the Hospital met with the Greater New York Hospital Association (GNYHA), a trade association, and regulatory agencies to inform the structure and process for selecting its public health priorities. The Hospital also attended executive briefings regarding plans and updates to the NYC DOHMH Take Care New York health policy on February 20th and July 19th, 2013, meetings which were facilitated by GNYHA, to ensure the Hospital's priority/focus areas are aligned with state and local health department goals."

201403219349306015,362167800,"PART V, SECTION B, LINE 3","A community health needs assessment (CHNA) is a collaborative community process of identifying and prioritizing a community's health needs, accomplished through the collection and analysis of data, including input from community stakeholders. In July 2012, a CHNA Steering Committee was formed to represent stakeholders within the PSFH community, as well as to provide oversight and input throughout the CHNA process. The committee's role is also to assist in the identification of data-driven community priorities and to engage stakeholders in community solutions through partnerships and collaboration. By taking on a community approach to both the assessment and implementation strategies, the goal is to ensure the data, processes, and outputs add value to all community partners, not just the hospital. Engagement of Public Health Expertise Presence Health formally engaged the Illinois Public Health Institute (IPHI) for assistance in planning and executing the CHNA process. IPHI served as an expert public health consultant throughout the CHNA timeline. Further, IPHI provided invaluable assistance in obtaining partnerships with the local and county Health Departments. Given the vast number of county hospitals served by the same Health Department in Cook County, resource allocation was difficult to obtain. As such, IPHI functioned as a liaison role between Presence Health and the Health Departments so as to obtain engagement through public data sharing and linkages with implementation plans. Conversations were facilitated between the Cook County Department of Public Health so as to continually inform all parties of CHNA process inputs and obtain both feedback and support. CHNA Steering Committee To provide community level oversight for the process, a diverse group of community stakeholders and Presence Saint Francis Hospital representatives from its service area (Evanston, Rogers Park, and West Ridge) were invited to participate on the CHNA Steering Committee. To ensure representative engagement, personal invitations were sent to organizations representing cultural, linguistic, racial, ethnic, and other minority groups. In addition, individuals with specialized qualifications in dealing with special populations or clinical groups were solicited for their participation. Finally, efforts were made to include individuals on the CHNA Steering Committee with public health expertise. Those who committed to the assessment and planning process became the 23 members of the CHNA Steering Committee, which continues to meet regularly to provide feedback and oversight, assess progress, and modify plans as needed. The agencies represented on the CHNA Steering Committee are listed below: -Oakton School PTA -Cook County Commissioner Larry Suffredin's Office -Presence Saint Francis Hospital -St. Hillary Catholic Church -Holmestead Communications -Former Evanston Police Chief -PEER Services, Inc. -Trilogy -Former Evanston Mayor -Consortium to Lower Obesity in Chicago Children (CLOCC) -McGaw YMCA -Rogers Park Business Alliance -CJE SeniorLife -Howard Area Community Center -ACCESS Community Health Network -Evanston Health Department -Saint Nicholas -Evanston/Skokie School District 65 Community Health Profile The Community Health Profile is a compilation of secondary data (data already published and available) about a particular community. The profile provides comparative information to assist in understanding the needs and priorities of a community. The Community Health Profile for PSFH analyzed over 50 indicators. Example indicators include: population trends, race, income, poverty levels, and percentage of uninsured, health professional shortages, leading causes of death, teen births, birth weights, tobacco use, physical activity, crime rates, and food insecurity. The Community Health Profile can be found online at www.presencehealth.org/community. Community Input Report The community input process was completed between August and October 2012. The process included creating and administering a community input survey in Spanish, Polish and Russian as well as English, facilitating three focus groups, and completing an asset and resources inventory. The community survey explored residents' perceptions of issues surrounding quality of life, health, and social factors and collected respondents' demographics including insurance coverage. Nine hundred twenty-one (921) community residents completed the survey. The Community Input Report can be found online at www.presencehealth.org/community. In conjunction with the CHNA Steering Committee and numerous community stakeholders, an inventory of community assets was then conducted so as to determine existing health resources that could be built upon or collaborated with to conduct the work of PSFH's ministry. The Community Asset Matrix can be found in Appendix 1 of the Community Input Report online at www.presencehealth.org/community."

This document, a consolidated, multi-year, multi-agency,community-wide plan for action to improve the health of people in Schenectady, New York is the result of the combined efforts of 62 organizations. The Schenectady Coalition for a Healthy Community,informed by multiple credible data sources including a door-to-door survey of community residents,developed this assessment and plan to serve the people of the City and County of Schenectady. Ellis worked with the Schenectady County Public Health Services, the Schenectady County Department of Social Services, the University at Albany School of Public Health, the public health program at Union Graduate College, and he Mayor of the City of Schenectady. UMatter Schenectady was a carefully designed, face-to-face city-wide survey of health concerns funded by The Schenectady Foundation and the Carlilian Foundation with direct assistance from SCPHS (which provided the services of its medical consultant to provide survey analysis and participate in writing of this document),Schenectady Community Action Program (SCAP) (which recruited and coordinated Community Health Workers), several local colleges an universities (which provided student volunteers and faculty assistance), and Ellis Medicine(which administered the survey-taking and provided the services of its epidemiologist). Other local organizations facilitated data collection, including the Schenectady Municipal Housing Authority (which allowed use of its facilities) and the Mayor of the City of Schenectady, whopersonally accompanied the door-to-door surveyors on several occasions. The survey was designed by team of epidemiologists from Ellis and the University at Albanys School of Public Health, working in consultation with a subcommittee of the Schenectady Coalition. Inspired byneighborhood-based health needs surveys conducted in Chicago for over a decade, the Schenectady project completed 2,229 surveys which, depending on branching from certain responses, covered as many as 283 questions. The sampling frames were designed to oversample the least affluent and most underserved neighborhoods and ZIP codes to assure that we heard the voices of those often missed in phone surveys. Responses were captured on iPads and directly loaded to a cloud-based database using the internet at the point of survey.

To this end, all groups were consulted in its development phase. Thirteen members of the community, including Public and Patient Education Department and Department of Social Work Programs participants and members of the Carter Burden and Mott Street Senior Centers, provided feedback on survey construction and length in late January and early February 2013, mainly through one-on-one interviews. In addition, the Hospital was careful to elicit public input about survey translations to ensure that they were culturally relevant; health literacy considerations were also taken into account. Internal stakeholders and community partners provided valuable feedback about survey construction, the use of validated measures, cultural relevance, health literacy and survey gaps via extensive phone conversations, emails and in- person discussions. All feedback was aggregated and used to adjust survey questions, construction and cultural relevance. Below outlines the community partners involved in survey construction: - Arthritis Foundation - New York Chapter - Sharon Jaycox-Daitz, MS, Regional Vice President, Northeast Programs; Kate Anastasia, MPA, Regional Director of Programs - Charles B.

Relevant national, state and city health data and needs assessment results were also utilized to drive community programming. - Input from Internal Stakeholders: Internal meetings were held with various parties within the Hospital (HSS Departments of Public and Patient Education, Social Work Programs, Nursing, Nutrition, and Rehabilitation) to discuss identified health priorities and explore areas for implementing initiatives, using results from the CHNA and stakeholders' awareness of community needs to guide the discussion. The group discussed focusing on increasing access to high quality, culturally relevant chronic disease preventive care and management of musculoskeletal and rheumatologic conditions and reducing obesity in adults and children, which aligns with the New York State Department of Health's Community Service Plan priority areas. - Input from the General Public: A public forum was held in May 2013 to allow members of the community an opportunity to discuss how the Hospital could prioritize community health needs. The public expressed the need for programs that improve diet and physical activity and empower the community to prevent and manage their musculoskeletal and rheumatologic conditions. Furthermore, community members agreed that HSS should focus on developing strong programs and services aimed at reducing obesity and increasing access to high quality chronic disease preventive care and management in clinical and community settings. - Community Partner Feedback: Feedback from community partner organizations was critical to driving the selection of public health priorities for the Hospital. Using results of the CHNA as the basis for discussion, HSS and its partners exchanged valuable information regarding community needs, explored areas for future collaboration, and solidified a mutual commitment to advancing public health. Furthermore, community partner knowledge of their respective community helped to identify gaps in community programming - or more specifically, areas where HSS could use its areas of expertise to make a lasting public health impact. Overall, feedback from these meetings solidified the direction for programs that improve the community's diet and increase physical activity to combat obesity among children and adults, examine specific communities in need of chronic disease preventive care and management (including older adults, diverse communities and lower-income groups), and provide culturally-relevant education regarding musculoskeletal and rheumatologic issues. Additionally, the Hospital met with the Greater New York Hospital Association (GNYHA), a trade association, and regulatory agencies to inform the structure and process for selecting its public health priorities. The Hospital also attended executive briefings regarding plans and updates to the NYC DOHMH Take Care New York health policy on February 20th and July 19th, 2013, meetings which were facilitated by GNYHA, to ensure the Hospital's priority/focus areas are aligned with state and local health department goals."

Within these four priority areas, many of the other health indicators i.e. diabetes, womens health, mens health and hypertension also fell within these priorities and will continue to be addressed internally or with our collaborative partners. Needs not addressed are related to safety and social indicators/issues, such as issues pertaining to guns and violence, helping residents pay rent and/or utilities, providing emergency shelter, clothing, legal services, and tax preparation.

There may be times, such as very late in the evening or very early morning, when all self pay patients are not seen face-to-face before they are discharged. However, there are phone attempts and letters mailed to these patients to explain financial assistance and attempt completion of the financial assistance application. The front of every patient billing statement references assistance for amounts not covered by insurance to those individuals whose income is below the established poverty level. There are telephone numbers for customer service, with service hours, and an email address provided on the front of every patient billing statement. On the back of every patient billing statement is the financial assistance application with the federal poverty guidelines.

IN 2013, REGIONS:- DEVELOPED ELECTRONIC MEDICAL RECORD EMERGENCY DEPARTMENT CARE PLANS: AN EMERGENCY DEPARTMENT-BASED CARE PLAN IS CREATED FOR IDENTIFIED PATIENTS WITH HIGH RATES OF UNNECESSARY EMERGENCY DEPARTMENT (ED) VISITS AND ADMISSIONS. ALL CARE PLANS ARE VIEWABLE TO ALL HOSPITAL CARE PROVIDERS, INCLUDING EMERGENCY DEPARTMENT PROVIDERS, HOSPITALISTS, AND PRIMARY CARE PHYSICIANS WITHIN THE SYSTEM.- PROVIDED CARE MANAGER OUTREACH TO PATIENTS: A CARE MANAGER IS AVAILABLE TO PROVIDE FACE-TO-FACE OR TELEPHONIC EDUCATION AND FOLLOW UP FOR PATIENTS USING THE EMERGENCY DEPARTMENT FOR NON-EMERGENT REASONS.- FUNDED A COMMUNITY PARAMEDIC DEVELOPMENT PROGRAM: THE COMMUNITY PARAMEDIC, UNDER THE ORDERS OF A PHYSICIAN, WILL MAKE ONE OR MORE HOME VISITS TO IDENTIFIED PATIENTS TO SUPPORT CLINICAL STABILIZATION, PATIENT EDUCATION, AND PREVENT UNNECESSARY HOSPITAL READMISSIONS AND EMERGENCY DEPARTMENT VISITS.- DEVELOPED AN ELECTRONIC MEDICAL RECORD ED VISIT DATA FEED TO PRIMARY CARE PROVIDERS: WITHIN 24 HOURS OF AN EMERGENCY DEPARTMENT VISIT, THE VISIT INFORMATION IS SENT ELECTRONICALLY TO THE APPLICABLE PRIMARY CARE PROVIDER. IT DEVELOPMENT WORK WAS REQUIRED IN ORDER TO DESIGN AND IMPLEMENT THIS ELECTRONIC FEED TO PRIMARY CARE CLINICS. WORK CLOSELY WITH COMMUNITY CLINICSREGIONS WORKED CLOSELY WITH COMMUNITY CLINIC PARTNERS IN THE SERVICE AREA ON CONTINUITY OF CARE AND LINKAGES TO REGIONS, AS PART OF THE EAST METRO SAFETY NET. HEALTHPARTNERS MEDICAL GROUP PHYSICIANS CONTINUE TO PROVIDE ON CALL SERVICES FOR THESE CLINICS WHEN THEIR PATIENTS ARE HOSPITALIZED AT REGIONS.REGIONS CONDUCTED A TELEMEDICINE SERVICES PILOT TO ASSIST SMALL HOSPITALS AND RURAL COMMUNITIES TO INCREASE ACCESS TO CLINICAL EXPERTISE IN SELECT SUBSPECIALTY AREAS. BASED ON COMMUNITY CLINIC FEEDBACK, REGIONS IDENTIFIED THE NEED TO PROVIDE MORE STREAMLINED AND TIMELY ACCESS TO A PATIENT'S RECORD ONCE A PATIENT RECEIVED CARE AT REGIONS AND SUBSEQUENTLY RETURNED TO THEIR HOME CLINICS (BASED ON PATIENT'S PERMISSION). REGIONS HAS COMMITTED AND IS IN THE PROCESS OF IMPLEMENTING A NEW PORTAL THAT WILL PROVIDE EASIER ACCESS TO THE PATIENT'S ELECTRONIC HEALTH RECORD. THIS PORTAL WILL PROVIDE SECURE ACCESS WITHOUT THE NEED OF AN ADDITIONAL SECURITY TOKEN VIA THE INTERNET. PATIENTS WHO IDENTIFY A PHYSICIAN OR CLINIC IN THE COMMUNITY WILL BE PUBLISHED TO THEIR LIST OF PATIENTS FOR EASE OF SELECTION. THIS PORTAL WILL BE UP AND AVAILABLE IN FEBRUARY 2014 FOR THE PILOT CLINICS. ADDITIONAL CLINICS WILL BE ROLLED OUT ONCE THE PILOT CLINICS ARE DEEMED SUCCESSFUL.CARE MANAGEMENTREGIONS ACTIVELY LEADS IN THE COMPANY-WIDE CARE MANAGEMENT TRANSFORMATION EFFORTS. THIS WORK INTENDS TO IMPROVE HEALTH OUTCOMES AND THE EXPERIENCE FOR PATIENTS WITH CHRONIC OR COMPLEX CONDITIONS BY INTEGRATING SERVICES AND SMOOTHING HANDOVERS AND TRANSITIONS. REGIONS CONVENED AN INTERDISCIPLINARY COMMITTEE THAT MEETS MONTHLY TO ADDRESS ED VISITS AND HOSPITAL ADMISSIONS. CARE PLANS ARE IMPLEMENTED ON PATIENTS CONSIDERED HIGH RISK INCLUDING THOSE WITH NARCOTIC ABUSING/SEEKING BEHAVIOR AND THOSE WITH HIGH RATES OF POTENTIALLY MEDICALLY UNNECESSARY ED VISITS. REGIONS DATA SHOWS THE IMPACT ON COMPLIANCE AND LIMITING ED VISITS AND HOSPITAL ADMISSIONS. IN 2013, REGIONS HAD 34 PATIENTS WITH A CARE PLAN IN PLACE. ED VISITS DECREASED BY 17.95% WITH THIS GROUP AND ADMISSIONS DECREASED BY 54.79%. ALSO IMBEDDED IN THE ED ARE CARE MANAGERS WHO PROVIDE EDUCATION AND SUPPORT TO PATIENTS, CONNECT THEM TO PRIMARY CARE AND TO COMMUNITY RESOURCES. IN ADDITION, GEOGRAPHIC STUDIES WERE COMPLETED AND WE ARE PARTNERING WITH COMMUNITY PARAMEDICS IN NEIGHBORHOODS WHERE WE SEE A HIGH UTILIZATION OF THE EMERGENCY DEPARTMENT.MANY EFFORTS ARE IN PLACE TO MANAGE RISK OF READMISSION. AN ALGORITHM WAS BUILT TO ASSIGN A SCORE TO PATIENTS REPRESENTING THEIR RISK FOR RISK FOR READMISSION. THIS SCORE, ALONG WITH OTHER CRITERIA, IS USED BY CARE MANAGEMENT STAFF AND PHYSICIANS TO PUT IN PLACE ACTIVITIES TO MANAGE THE RISK. HOSPITAL CARE MANAGEMENT WORKS CLOSELY WITH THE HEALTH PLAN DISEASE AND CASE MANAGEMENT STAFF TO ENSURE HIGH RISK PATIENTS ARE BEING FOLLOWED OUTSIDE THE HOSPITAL. HOSPITAL CARE MANAGEMENT ALSO WORKS CLOSELY WITH GERIATRICS, HOSPICE AND HOME CARE TO ESTABLISH SMOOTH TRANSITIONS AND EXCHANGE OF INFORMATION. REGULAR MEETINGS TAKE PLACE WITH TCU'S, LTAC'S, SNF'S AND OTHER FACILITIES TO ESTABLISH AND MAINTAIN PROCESSES THAT SUPPORT EFFICIENT AND EFFECTIVE TRANSITIONS TO AND FROM THE ACUTE CARE SETTING. .
