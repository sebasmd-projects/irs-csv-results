In conducting its most recent CHNA, IU Health Arnett took into account input from persons who represent the broad interests of the communities it serves by hosting several community conversation focus groups. These focus groups included public health officials and community leaders to discuss the healthcare needs of the service area and what role IU Health Arnett could play in addressing the identified needs. To obtain a more complete picture of the factors that play into the Tippecanoe County community's health, input from local health leaders was gathered through two separate focus group sessions. The first live group session lasted two hours and was held at IU Health Arnett Hospital and the second session was held via conference call. IU Health Arnett facilitators mailed letters and made follow-up telephone calls inviting public health officials and community leaders to attend the focus group discussion, paying special attention to including organizations that represent the interest of low-income, minority, and uninsured individuals.

Upon arrival to the focus group, participants were asked to list their believed five prioritized health needs for the IU Health Arnett community. These responses were collected and aggregated into a comprehensive list of identified needs to be further discussed later in the session and ranked for severity of need within the community. IU Health Arnett facilitators then provided participants with a presentation featuring the mission of IU Health, current outreach priorities, and local health data, including demographics, insurance information, poverty rates, county health rankings, causes of death, physical activity, chronic conditions, preventive behaviors, and community needs index. Upon completion of the data presentation, IU Health Arnett facilitated a discussion on the comprehensive list of identified needs from earlier in the session. The objective of this method was intended to inspire candid discussions prior to a second identification of five prioritized health needs by each participant. The votes on the five prioritized health needs were tallied and final input from the group was encouraged during this process in order to validate the previously identified needs. Following additional discussion, participants were also asked to address what they thought the role of IU Health Arnett could be in meeting the local health needs. IU Health Arnett also solicited responses from the general public regarding the health of the IU Health Arnett community through an online survey. The survey consisted of approximately 15 multiple choice and open-ended questions that assessed the community members' feedback regarding healthcare issues and barriers to access. A link was made available on the hospital's Web site via an electronic survey tool from April 2012 through June 2012. A paper version was distributed to local community centers, health clinics, community health fairs and events, as well as within some hospital patient waiting areas. Additionally, an estimated 25,000 surveys were e-mailed, direct-mailed, or sent via newsletter. In addition to disseminating directly to the general public of the community, the survey was also sent via e-mail to participants in the needs assessment focus groups to provide an opportunity for these community leaders to pass on to their local community members.
