The University is subject to federal and state income taxes on any net income from unrelated business activities. The University files a Form 990 (Return of Organization Exempt from Income Tax) annually. When these returns are filed, it is highly certain that some positions taken would be sustained upon examination by the taxing authorities, while others are subject to uncertainty about the merits of the tax position taken or the amount of the position that would ultimately be sustained. Examples of tax positions common to universities include such matters as the following: the tax exempt status of each entity and various positions relative to potential sources of unrelated business taxable income (UBIT). UBIT is reported on Form 990-T, as appropriate. The benefit of tax position is recognized in the financial statements in the period during which, based on all available evidence, management believes that it is more likely than not that the position will be sustained upon examination, including the resolution of appeals or litigation processes, if any. Tax positions are not offset or aggregated with other positions. Tax positions that meet the ""more likely than not"" recognition threshold are measured as the largest amount of tax benefit that is more than 50% likely to be realized on settlement with the applicable taxing authority. The portion of the benefits associated with tax positions taken that exceeds the amount measured as described above is reflected as a liability for uncertain tax benefits in the accompanying statements of financial position along with any associated interest and penalties that would be payable to the taxing authorities upon examination. As of May 31, 2014 and 2013, there were no uncertain tax benefits identified and recorded as a liability. Form 990-T filed by the University is subject to examination by the Internal Revenue Service (IRS) up to three years from the extended due date of the return.

No provision has been made for income taxes in the accompanying financial statements, as the Institute has had no significant unrelated business income.The Institute follows guidance issued by the Financial Accounting Standards Board (FASB) with respect to accounting for uncertainty in income taxes.

For income tax positions that the University considers to be uncertain, current and deferred tax liabilities would be recognized, or assets derecognized, when it is probable that an income tax liability has been incurred and the amount of the liability is reasonably estimable, or when it is probable that a tax benefit, such as a tax credit or loss carryforward, would be disallowed by a taxing authority. As of December 31, 2013 and 2012, there were no accruals for uncertain tax positions. If applicable, the University records interest and penalties as a component of income tax expense.

Whether any distributions are made from endowment funds is decided annually by the Board of Trustees in conjunction with the College's annual operating budget. Accordingly, over the long term, the College expects the current spending policy to allow its endowment to grow at a rate that exceeds the rate of inflation. This is consistent with the College's objective to maintain the purchasing power of the endowment assets held in perpetuity or for a specified term as well as to provide additional real growth through new gifts and investment return. The current investment policy has a spending policy of 4% per annum, based on a historical three-year moving average of donor restricted endowment fund market value on June 30. No distributions will be made which will result in the market value of the donor restricted endowment to fall below the original corpus.

Its endowment includes both donor-restricted endowment funds and funds designated by the Board of Trustees to function as endowments. As required by U.S. generally accepted accounting principles (GAAP), net assets associated with endowment funds, including funds designated by the Board of Trustees to function as endowments, are classified and reported based on the existence or absence of donor-imposed restrictions. The College has adopted investment and spending policies for endowment assets that attempt to provide a predictable stream of funding to programs supported by its endowment while seeking to maintain the purchasing power of the endowment assets. Endowment assets include those assets of donor-restricted funds that the College must hold in perpetuity or for a donor-specified period(s) as well as board-designated funds. Under this policy, as approved by the Board of Trustees, the endowment assets are invested in a manner that is intended to produce results that exceed the price and yield results of appropriate market indices while assuming a moderate level of investment risk. The College's investment objectives are to provide a total return sufficient to support the College's operating budget while preserving the assets against inflation. To meet these objectives the Board seeks a total return of at least 5% greater than the rate of inflation as measured by the Consumer Price Index (U.S. CPI-U) over a long-term horizon. Total return is defined as dividends or interest income, plus or minus realized and unrealized capital appreciation or depreciation at fair market value, net of fees. The maximum amount of endowment income utilization is determined by a spending formula approved by the Board of Trustees. The amount available for spending is set at 5% of the previous three-year average market value for the years ended June 30, 2014 and 2013, respectively. The amounts available to be distributed, net of unspent endowment income, under the spending policy were $458,223 and $409,939 for the years ended June 30, 2014 and 2013, respectively. These amounts are included in change in net assets from operations. Investment income greater or less than the amounts available to be distributed under the spending policy is reported as nonoperating income."
