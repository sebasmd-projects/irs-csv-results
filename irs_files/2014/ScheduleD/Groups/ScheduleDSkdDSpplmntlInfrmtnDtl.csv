The Lowcountry Surgery Center is a limited liability company. Under current laws, income or loss of limited liability companies is included in the income tax returns of the members. Accordingly, no provision for income taxes is made in the consolidated financial statements. Although [the consolidated group] is generally exempt from federal and state income taxes, it evaluates whether there are any uncertain tax positions that fail to meet the more-likely-than-not threshold for recognition in the consolidated financial statements. Uncertain tax positions may include the characterization of income, such as a characterization of income as passive, a decision to exclude reporting taxable income in a tax return, or a decision to classify a transaction, entity, or other position in a tax return as tax exempt. The tax return benefit from an uncertain tax position is recognized when it is more likely than not that the position will be sustained upon examination, including resolutions of any related appeals or litigation processes, based on the technical merits. The organization has no unrecognized tax positions as of December 31, 2013 and 2012, and does not expect that unrecognized tax benefits will materially increase within the next 12 months. Tax years 2010 through 2012 are subject to examination by the federal and state taxing authorities, respectively. There are no income tax examinations currently in process.

The endowment fund is administered by Presence Health. The University has adopted the investment and spending policies of Presence Health for its endowment Fund. The objective of these policies is to provide the University with a predictable funding stream for its programs while protecting the power of the Endowment Fund. Presence Health's investment policy represents the current consensus of the EndOwment Fund's investment philosophy and shall be reviewed from time to time to ensure that it continues to reflect the appropriate expectations, goals, and objectives for the Endowment Fund. Presence Health has intepreted Uniform Prudent Management of Institutional Funds Act (UPMIFA), as adopted and enacted by the Illinois legislature on June 30, 2009, as requiring the preservation of the fair value of the original gift as of the gift date of the donor-restricted endowment funds absent explicit donor stipulations to the contrary. As a result of this interpretation, the University classifies as permanently restricted net assets: (a) the original value of gifts donated to the permanent endowment, (b) the original value of subsequent gifts to the permanent endowment, and (c) accumulations to the permanent endowment made in accordance with the direction of the applicable donor gift instrument at the time the accumulation is added to the fund. The remaining portion of the donor-restricted endowment fund that is not classified as permanently restricted net assets is classified as temporarily restricted net assets until those amounts are appropriated for expenditure by the University in a manner consistent with the standard of prudence presribed by the state of Illinois in its enacted version of UPMIFA. In accordance with UPMIFA, Presence Health considers the following factors in making a determination to appropriate or accumulate donor-restricted endowment funds: (1) the duration and preservation of the endowment fund, (2) the purposes of the University and the donor-restricted endowment fund, (3) general economic conditions, (4) the possible effect of inflation and deflation, (5) the expected total return from income and the appreciation of investments, (6) other resources of the University, and (7) the investment policies of Presence Health. Presence Health may appropriate for expenditure or accumulate so much of the Endowment Fund as the University determines is prudent for the uses, benefits, purposes, and duration for which the Endowment Fund is established."

The University has a favorable determination letter from the Internal Revenue Service as part of a group ruling, stating they are exempt from federal income taxes under Section 501(a) of the Internal Revenue Code of 1986 (IRC), as organized under Section 501(c)(3), except for income taxes pertaining to unrelated business income. The Financial Accounting Standards Board issued guidance that requires tax effects from uncertain tax positions to be recognized in the financial statements only if the position is more likely than not to be sustained if the position were to be challenged by a taxing authority. Management has determined there are no material uncertain positions that require recognition in the financial statements. Additionally, no provision for income taxes is reflected in these financial statements, and there is no interest or penalties recognized in the statements of activities or statements of financial position. The tax years ending 2011, 2012 and 2013 are still open for audit for both federal and state purposes."

When these returns are filed, it is highly certain that some positions taken would be sustained upon examination by the taxing authorities, while others are subject to uncertainty about the merits of the tax position taken or the amount of the position that would ultimately be sustained. Examples of tax positions common to universities include such matters as the following: the tax exempt status of each entity and various positions relative to potential sources of unrelated business taxable income (UBIT). UBIT is reported on Form 990-T, as appropriate. The benefit of tax position is recognized in the financial statements in the period during which, based on all available evidence, management believes that it is more likely than not that the position will be sustained upon examination, including the resolution of appeals or litigation processes, if any. Tax positions are not offset or aggregated with other positions. Tax positions that meet the ""more likely than not"" recognition threshold are measured as the largest amount of tax benefit that is more than 50% likely to be realized on settlement with the applicable taxing authority. The portion of the benefits associated with tax positions taken that exceeds the amount measured as described above is reflected as a liability for uncertain tax benefits in the accompanying statements of financial position along with any associated interest and penalties that would be payable to the taxing authorities upon examination.

U.S. generally accepted accounting principles require that the asset and liability method of accounting for income taxes be utilized by these organizations. Under the asset and liability method, deferred income taxes are recognized for the tax consequences of temporary differences by applying enacted statutory tax rates applicable to future years to differences between the financial statement carrying amounts and the tax basis of existing assets and liabilities. The effect on deferred taxes of a change in tax rates is recognized in income in the period of enactment. At December 31, 2013 and 2012, the System has a deferred income tax asset which has been fully offset by a related valuation allowance. A valuation allowance is provided when it is more likely than not that some portion, or all of the deferred tax asset will not be realized. Significant components of the deferred tax asset relate to the allowance for doubtful accounts receivable and net operating loss carry forwards. Certain entities have net operating loss carry forwards aggregating approximately $167,000,000, which expire in varying amounts through 2033, and are available to offset future taxable income."

No provision has been made for income taxes in the accompanying financial statements, as the Institute has had no significant unrelated business income.The Institute follows guidance issued by the Financial Accounting Standards Board (FASB) with respect to accounting for uncertainty in income taxes.

The amount recognized is the largest amount of tax benefit that is greater than 50% likely of being realized on examination. For tax positions not meeting the more likely than not test, no tax benefit is recorded.The Institute recognizes interest and penalties related to unrecognized tax benefits in interest and income tax expense, respectively. The Institute has no amounts accrued for interest or penalties as of June 30, 2014 or 2013.Due to its tax-exempt status, the Institute is not subject to U.S. federal income tax or state income tax.

This is consistent with the College's objective to maintain the purchasing power of the endowment assets held in perpetuity or for a specified term as well as to provide additional real growth through new gifts and investment return. The current investment policy has a spending policy of 4% per annum, based on a historical three-year moving average of donor restricted endowment fund market value on June 30.

AS A RESULT OF THIS INTERPRETATION, THE COLLEGE CLASSIFIES AS PERMANETLY RESTRICTED NET ASSETS (A) THE ORIGINAL VALUE OF GIFTS DONATED TO THE PERMANENT ENDOWMENT, (B) THE ORIGINAL VALUE OF SUBSEQUENT GIFTS TO THE PERMANENT ENDOWMENT AND (C) ACCUMULATIONS TO THE PERMANENT ENDOWMENT MADE IN ACCORDANCE WITH THE DIRECTION OF THE APPLICABLE DONOR GIFT INSTRUMENT AT THE TIME THE ACCUMULATION IS ADDED TO THE FUND. THE REMAINNG PORTION OF THE DONOR-RESTRICTED ENDOWMENT FUND THAT IS NOT CLASSIFIED IN PERMANENTLY RESTRICTED NET ASSETS IS CLASSIFIED AS TEMPORARILY RESTRICTED NET ASSTS UNTIL THOSE AMOUNTS ARE APPROPRIATED FOR EXPENDITURE BY THE COLLEGE IN A MANNER CONSISTENT WITH THE STANDARD OF PRUDENCE PRESCRIBED BY STATE LAW. IN ACCORDANCE WITH THE UNIFORM PRUDENT MANAGEMENT OF INSTITUTIONAL FUNDS ACT, THE COLLEGE CAN CONSIDER THE FOLLOWING FACTORS IN MAKING A DETERMINATION TO APPROPRIATE OR ACCUMULATE DONOR-RESTRICTED ENDOWMENT FUNDS: THE DURATION AND PRESERVATION OF THE FUND THE PURPOSES OF THE COLLEGE AND THE DONOR-RESTRICTED ENDOWMENT FUND GENERAL ECONOMIC CONDITIONS THE POSSIBLE EFFECT OF INFLATION AND DEFLATION THE EXPECTED TOTAL RETURN FROM INCOME AND THE APPRECIATION OF INVESTMENTS OTHER RESOURCES OF THE COLLEGE THE INVESTMENT POLICIES OF THE COLLEGE THE COLLEGE HAS ADOPTED INVESTMENT AND SPENDING POLICIES FOR ITS ENDOWMENT ASSETS THAT ATTEMPT TO PROVIDE A PREDICTABLE STREAM OF FUNDING FOR ITS INSTITUTIONAL PURPOSES WHILE SEEKING TO MAINTAIN THE PURCHASING POWER OF THE ENDOWMENT ASSETS. UNDER THIS POLICY, AS APPROVED BY THE BOARD OF TRUSTEES, THE ENDOWMENT ASSETS ARE INVESTED IN A MANNER THAT IS INTENDED TO PRODUCE A FIXED STREAM OF INCOME WHILE ASSUMING A MODERATE LEVEL OF INVESTMENT RISK. ACTUAL RETURNS IN ANY GIVEN YEAR MAY VARY FROM THIS AMOUNT. THE COLLEGE HAS A POLICY OF APPROPRIATING FOR DISTRIBUTION EACH YEAR 75% OF THE INCOME GENERATED BY THE ENDOWMENT FUND'S INVESTMENTS. THE REMAINING 25% IS REINVESTED INTO THE ENDOWMENT. IN ESTABLISHING THIS POLICY, THE COLLEGE CONSIDERED THE LONG-TERM EXPECTED RETURN OF ITS ENDOWMENT. THIS IS CONSISTENT WITH THE COLLEGE'S OBJECTIVE TO MAINTAIN THE PURCHASING POWER OF ITS ENDOWMENT. FROM TIME TO TIME, THE FAIR VALUE OF ASSETS ASSOCIATED WITH INDIVIDUAL DONOR-RESTRICTED ENDOWMENT FUNDS MAY FALL BELOW THE LEVEL THAT THE DONOR IMPOSED RESTRICTIONS REQUIRE THE COLLEGE TO RETAIN AS A FUND OF PERPETUAL DURATION. IN ACCORDANCE WITH GENERALL ACCEPTED ACCOUNTING PRINCIPLES, DEFICIENCIES OF THIS NAURE ARE REPORTED IN UNRESTRICTED NET ASSETS. THERE WERE NO SUCH DEFICIENCIES AS OF APRIL 30, 2014 AND 2013."

Its endowment includes both donor-restricted endowment funds and funds designated by the Board of Trustees to function as endowments. As required by U.S. generally accepted accounting principles (GAAP), net assets associated with endowment funds, including funds designated by the Board of Trustees to function as endowments, are classified and reported based on the existence or absence of donor-imposed restrictions. The College has adopted investment and spending policies for endowment assets that attempt to provide a predictable stream of funding to programs supported by its endowment while seeking to maintain the purchasing power of the endowment assets. Endowment assets include those assets of donor-restricted funds that the College must hold in perpetuity or for a donor-specified period(s) as well as board-designated funds. Under this policy, as approved by the Board of Trustees, the endowment assets are invested in a manner that is intended to produce results that exceed the price and yield results of appropriate market indices while assuming a moderate level of investment risk. The College's investment objectives are to provide a total return sufficient to support the College's operating budget while preserving the assets against inflation. To meet these objectives the Board seeks a total return of at least 5% greater than the rate of inflation as measured by the Consumer Price Index (U.S. CPI-U) over a long-term horizon. Total return is defined as dividends or interest income, plus or minus realized and unrealized capital appreciation or depreciation at fair market value, net of fees. The maximum amount of endowment income utilization is determined by a spending formula approved by the Board of Trustees. The amount available for spending is set at 5% of the previous three-year average market value for the years ended June 30, 2014 and 2013, respectively. The amounts available to be distributed, net of unspent endowment income, under the spending policy were $458,223 and $409,939 for the years ended June 30, 2014 and 2013, respectively. These amounts are included in change in net assets from operations. Investment income greater or less than the amounts available to be distributed under the spending policy is reported as nonoperating income."

The first step is determining whether a tax position has met the recognition threshold; the second step is measuring a tax position that meets the recognition threshold. Management believes that Spectrum has adequately evaluated its current tax positions and has concluded that as of June 30, 2014 Spectrum does not have any uncertain tax positions for which a reserve or an accrual for a tax liability would be necessary.Spectrum has received notification from the Internal Revenue Service and the State of California that it qualifies for tax-exempt status under Section 501(c)(3) of the Internal Revenue Code and Section 23701d of the California Revenue and Taxation Code. The exemptions are subject to periodic review by the federal and state taxing authorities and management is confident that Spectrum continues to satisfy all federal and state statutes in order to qualify for continued tax exemption status. Spectrum could potentially receive unrelated business income in the future (such as program advertising or sub-lease rental income) requiring Spectrum to file separate tax returns under federal and state statutes.

U.S. generally accepted accounting principles require that the asset and liability method of accounting for income taxes be utilized by these organizations. Under the asset and liability method, deferred income taxes are recognized for the tax consequences of temporary differences by applying enacted statutory tax rates applicable to future years to differences between the financial statement carrying amounts and the tax basis of existing assets and liabilities. The effect on deferred taxes of a change in tax rates is recognized in income in the period of enactment. At December 31, 2013 and 2012, the System has a deferred income tax asset which has been fully offset by a related valuation allowance. A valuation allowance is provided when it is more likely than not that some portion, or all of the deferred tax asset will not be realized. Significant components of the deferred tax asset relate to the allowance for doubtful accounts receivable and net operating loss carry forwards. Certain entities have net operating loss carry forwards aggregating approximately $167,000,000, which expire in varying amounts through 2033, and are available to offset future taxable income."
