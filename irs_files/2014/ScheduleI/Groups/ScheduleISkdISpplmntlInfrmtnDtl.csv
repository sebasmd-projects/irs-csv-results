Corporate contributions and sponsorships are sometimes an appropriate vehicle for building partnerships with these non-profit organizations and maximizing our overall positive impact on the community.PROCEDURE1.All contribution/sponsorship requests should be submitted in writing to the Corporate Communications Department for consideration. Every effort should be made to process these requests and notify the requester within two weeks of receiving the written information required to evaluate the opportunity.2.In consultation with the CEO, the Director of Corporate Communications will prepare the annual budget for Corporate Contributions/Sponsorships and process/manage actual disbursements throughout the year.3.Requests will be evaluated based on the following criteria:a.Does the organization, event or publication promote the overall health and well-being of the communities we serve? Special consideration will be given to requests that directly impact health and wellness even though support may be available for organizations, events and/or publications that have a positive impact on the CSRA by:""assisting in attracting and retaining a viable work-force""assisting in attracting and retaining viable businesses and employers in the CSRA""promoting the continued growth and economic well-being of the community""enhancing the quality of life in the CSRAb.Does the proposed contribution/sponsorship primarily assist people locally rather than a national effort/initiative?c.Does the requesting organization have an approved tax-exempt status?d.Will the proposed contribution/sponsorship enhance the overall image/reputation of University Health Care System?e.Will the proposed contribution/sponsorship heighten awareness of a significant health issue or disease that has a negative impact on the citizens in the communities we serve?4.Under no circumstances will contributions be made to political campaigns.5.Because of the large number of public and private schools in the CSRA, University will limit financial support/contributions to the various Boards of Education rather than individual schools (elementary, middle and high schools).6.Because of the large number of churches in the CSRA, University will limit financial support/contributions to programs that include health-related services for underserved residents such as community clinics.7.Exception: Financial support and partnerships with area colleges and technical schools do not fall under this policy."
