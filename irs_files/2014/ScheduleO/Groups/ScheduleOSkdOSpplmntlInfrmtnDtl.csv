THE POLICY REQUIRES EACH TRUSTEE TO SUMBIT AN ANNUAL CONFLICT OF INTEREST DISCLOSURE STATEMENT AT LEAST ANNUALLY TO THE BOARD SECRETARY.

ALSO, AT THE BEGINNING OF EACH ANNUAL MEETING OF THE BOARD, THE BOARD MEMBERS ARE REMINDED BY THE BOARD'S CHAIRMAN, THE UNIVERSITY'S PRESIDENT AND THE UNIVERSITY'S GENERAL COUNSEL ABOUT CONFLICT REPORTING REQUIREMENTS; AND, THE BOARD MEMBERS ARE REQUIRED TO SUBMIT AN ANNUAL CONFLICT OF INTEREST DISCLOSURE STATEMENT PRIOR TO THE ADJOURNMENT OF THE MEETING. FOLLOWING THE MEETING, THE UNIVERSITY'S GENERAL COUNSEL CHECKS EACH ANNUAL CONFLICT OF INTEREST DISCLOSURE STATEMENT RECEIVED TO ENSURE THAT ALL TRUSTEES HAVE COMPLETED THE REQUIRED FORM.

201433219349304933,263162145,"Part VI, Section B, Line 15 - Process for Determining Compensation","The CEO/Top Management Official for Indiana University Health Arnett, Inc. (""IU Health Arnett"") is employed by Indiana University Health, Inc. (""IU Health""). IU Health has the following process for determining compensation: 1. The Board of Directors has established a Committee on Personnel and Compensation. The individuals on this Committee are made up of individuals who are on the Board and who do not have a conflict of interest with Indiana University Health, Inc. (""IU Health""). There are no physicians or employees on this Committee. This Committee develops and reviews annually the executive compensation philosophy, market analysis as to comparability and reasonableness. One of the purposes of this Committee is to review, approve and make recommendations regarding executive compensation and benefits to the IU Health Board. As deemed appropriate, this Committee also reviews the same detail with the Committee on Finance, Planning and Human Resources. The Committee on Finance, Planning and Human Resources is represented by certain members of the Board as well. 2. Each year the Committee on Personnel and Compensation engages an outside compensation consulting firm to conduct a compensation and benefits study for all senior vice presidents and above. The current compensation advisor is the Hay Group. Hay Group performs an independent compensation survey. The relevant comparability data includes: compensation and benefit levels paid by similarly situated organizations (both governmental and tax exempt) for functionally comparable positions as well as the availability of similar services in the geographic area. The Committee reviews the entire compensation package including: base compensation, short term and long term incentive plans, basic health and welfare benefits, qualified and nonqualified plans as well as any additional fringe benefits. Further, Hay Group will provide recommendations based upon the reasonable compensation information as it relates to salary increases, bonuses and benefits that are consistent with the compensation philosophy of the Committee. A separate analysis using the same methodology is done for the Chief Executive Officer. 3. The Committee reviews the salary survey and, if appropriate, makes recommendations on increases in salary and any changes in bonuses or benefits. The Committee's goal is to ensure that the total compensation and benefits package is reasonable based upon the independent data provided by Hay Group. The Committee votes on any changes in compensation or benefits. This review, discussion and vote are documented in the minutes for the meeting. There are no executives present during the final discussion and approval of compensation. 4. The Board reviews the report prepared by the Hay Group as well as the recommendations of the Committee on Personnel and Compensation as to changes in compensation approved by the Committee. As requested, the Finance, Planning and Human Resources Committee also provides its review of recommendations on changes in executive compensation and benefits. This review, discussion and vote are documented in the minutes. 5. The Board then reviews the recommendations provided by the Committee on Personnel and Compensation and votes on the changes as well. No additional compensation or benefits are paid to the executives until the changes have been approved by the Committee and the Board. The discussion and approval are documented in the minutes of the meeting. There are no executives present during the final discussion and approval of compensation. The General Counsel prepares a formal written opinion reviewing the compensation and benefits approval process, comparing that process to the Intermediate Sanctions Test of IRC Section 4958 and, if the facts warrant, provides comments regarding the compensation and benefits approval process as this relates to meeting the requirements for a rebuttable presumption of reasonableness as provided in the Intermediate Sanctions Test. 6. After the end of each year, the Committee and Board also reviews the achievements of the executive group as it relates to the long-term and short-term shared and individual goals developed by the executive and the Board. These achievements may also be reviewed with the Committee on Finance, Planning and Human Resources. The Board, at its discretion, may approve bonus payments based upon the achievement of the goals and the compensation survey. The discussion and vote of the Committee and Board is documented in the minutes for each such meeting. The bonuses are not paid until approval is made by the Board. 7. The Committee on Personnel and Compensation and Audit Committee also review the required Form 990 disclosures related to executive compensation and benefits as well as compensation practices and approval processes prior to the filing of the Form 990 return with the Internal Revenue Service. IU Health Arnett has a process in place to determine the compensation for the other officers and key employees. IU Health Arnett uses an independent compensation consultant who utilizes a variety of methods and procedures to obtain compensation ranges for comparable officer and employee positions. The independent compensation consultant provides IU Health Arnett with recommended compensation ranges for its officers and other employees, which are then used as a guide for setting reasonable compensation by management. Management decisions with regard to determining compensation are subject to the review and approval of the Executive Committee and Board of Directors."

OUR REASON TO EXIST AS AN INSTITUTION IS TO READY STUDENTS INTELLECTUALLY, PROFESSIONALLY, AND SOCIALLY TO LEAD PRODUCTIVE AND SATISFYING LIVES IN THE GLOBAL SOCIETY OF THE 21ST CENTURY. AS SUCH, OUR SUCCESS AS A COLLEGE IS MEASURED ACCORDING TO THE SUCCESS OF OUR GRADUATES. WE BELIEVE THAT A LIBERAL ARTS EDUCATION IS THE BEST PREPARATION FOR LIFE. WE BELIEVE THAT SUCH AN EDUCATION ALLOWS STUDENTS TO DISCOVER WHAT THEIR REAL TALENTS AND INTERESTS ARE, AND THAT IT DEVELOPS IN THEM THE SKILLS, ABILITIES, AND HABITS OF MIND THAT WILL MAKE POSSIBLE A SUCCESSFUL CAREER IN ANY FIELD OF ENDEAVOR, INCLUDING ONES THAT DO NOT YET EXIST. INDEED, WE BELIEVE THAT WHAT DEFINES A LIBERAL ARTS EDUCATION IS ITS FOCUS ON CULTIVATING IN STUDENTS CERTAIN FUNDAMENTAL ABILITIES: THE ABILITY TO THINK LOGICALLY AND ANALYTICALLY; THE ABILITY TO COMMUNICATE CLEARLY, BOTH IN WRITING AND SPEAKING; THE ABILITY TO USE EFFECTIVELY COMPUTER TECHNOLOGY; THE ABILITY TO WORK PRODUCTIVELY AS A MEMBER OF A GROUP SEEKING TO ACHIEVE A COMMON OBJECTIVE; THE ABILITY TO MAKE INFORMED JUDGMENTS, WHETHER IN THE REALM OF ETHICAL BEHAVIOR OF IN THAT OF AESTHETIC APPRECIATION; THE ABILITY TO FOSTER AND SUSTAIN AN ATTITUDE OF INTELLECTUAL CURIOSITY AND CREATIVITY; AND THE ABILITY TO RECOGNIZE AND HONOR TRUE EXCELLENCE WHEN FOUND IN ANY FORM OR CONTEXT. FURTHERMORE,WE BELIEVE THAT IT IS IMPORTANT FOR A LIBERAL ARTS EDUCATION TO CULTIVATE IN STUDENTS A DESIRE TO UNDERSTAND, A CAPACITY FOR TOLERANCE, AND AN ABILITY TO APPRECIATE THE ETHNIC AND CULTURAL DIVERSITY THAT MAKE UP HUMAN KIND. IT IS THE MISSION OF THE COLLEGE TO DEVELOP IN STUDENTS THESE ABILITIES AND ATTITUDES, AND IN SO DOING TO PROVIDE THEM AN EDUCATION THAT DIRECTS THEM TOWARD A MEANINGFUL AND SUCCESSFUL LIFE. COE'S ACADEMIC PROGRAM REFLECTS A COMMITMENT TO DEVELOPING THESE ABILITIES BY ITS INSISTENCE THAT STUDENTS ACQUIRE CERTAIN EDUCATIONAL EXPERIENCES. WE REQUIRE THAT STUDENTS COMPLETE BOTH OUR GENERAL EDUCATION REQUIREMENTS, WHICH ENSURE BREADTH OF LEARNING, AND OUR REQUIREMENTS FOR A MAJOR; WHICH GUARANTEE DEPTH OF KNOWLEDGE IN A PARTICULAR FIELD. IN ADDITION, AS PART OF EACH STUDENT'S EDUCATION, A SERIES OF INTENSIVE WRITING EXPERIENCES, SPREAD ACROSS THE FOUR YEARS OF STUDY, IS REQUIRED. BEYOND THESE REQUIREMENTS, STUDENTS ARE ENCOURAGED TO BEGIN PLANNING FOR THEIR LIVES AFTER COLLEGE EARLY ON IN THEIR UNDERGRADUATE CAREERS, AND, THROUGH CAREFUL ADVISING, THEY ARE GIVEN GUIDANCE AND DIRECTION IN THIS ENDEAVOR. INDEED, THE DEFINING FEATURE OF A COE EDUCATION IS THE REQUIREMENT THAT EVERY STUDENT PLAN AND PARTICIPATE IN ONE OF THE FOLLOWING: A SIGNIFICANT EXPERIENTIAL PROJECT, SUCH AS AN INTERNSHIP; A MAJOR SCHOLARLY UNDERTAKING; OR STUDY ABROAD. THESE EXPERIENCES WILL OFTEN, THOUGH NOT INVARIABLY, OCCUR DURING THE JUNIOR YEAR. THE HALLMARK OF A COE EDUCATION IS OUR ATTENTION TO EACH STUDENT AS AN INDIVIDUAL. IT IS ALSO IMPORTANT THAT THE COLLEGE ENVIRONMENT AT COE REFLECTS OUR COMMITMENT TO A DIVERSE STUDENT BODY AND OVERALL COLLEGE COMMUNITY. WE BELIEVE THAT THROUGH LISTENING CAREFULLY TO EACH STUDENT AS HIS OR HER INTERESTS AND UNIQUE TALENTS ARE FORMED, AND THROUGH TAILORING AN ACADEMIC PROGRAM TO SUIT EACH STUDENT'S FUTURE, WE HELP THAT STUDENT DEVELOP ABILITIES THAT PROVIDE THE BEST PREPARATION FOR LIFE."

Since 2009 Moody has annually reviewed the 990 salary information of comparable institutions to set benchmarks for this purpose. Information is accessed for the following positions: President, COO, CFO, Chief Educational Officer and Chief Development Officer. We typically look at 7-10 higher education institutions, some of which are competitors to Moody. We choose institutions of comparable mission and size (based upon total expenses). We look at 3-4 parachurch organizations (of generally comparable size) as well. This data is used as a salary administration benchmark. To increase its applicability, the data is adjusted for cost of living differences (based upon the location of the other institutions) in relation to the cost of living in the greater Chicago area.Following this analysis, which is provided for review by the Compensation Committee of the Board in the spring of each calendar year, the President's salary increase recommendations are based upon Institute salary guidelines for the fiscal year(which reflect trends in national average salary increases) and upon job performance. The Compensation Committee can either approve or disapprove the President's recommendations. Increases for officers and other key employees are scheduled for October of each year, so that the financial condition and performance of the institution at the close of the prior fiscal year can be taken into account.The President's salary increase is scheduled at the same time and is set by the Board (in the context of the data provided and the current fiscal year salary guidelines for the Institute)."

In addition, directors, officers, and key employees are required to immediately disclose any possible conflict of interest that arises mid-year in relation to a proposed transaction. The Conflict of Interest Policy requires that any individual with a conflict be recused from the decision making process, that independent directors or committee members determine that the proposed transaction is in the best interests of the University, and the transaction must be approved by a vote of the independent directors or committee members without the participation of any interested individual. The annual conflict disclosure statements are submitted to, and reviewed by, the Audit Committee, composed of independent outside directors. In addition, the executive staff is responsible for monitoring any possible conflict transactions that arise and managing them to ensure that all transactions represent arms' length, fair market value terms for the benefit of the University."

The compensation policy described below pertains to The Moody Bible Institute as the controlling entity.Several years prior, consultants were used to establish benchmarks for officer salary levels. Since 2009 Moody has annually reviewed the 990 salary information of comparable institutions to set benchmarks for this purpose. Information is accessed for the following positions: President, COO, CFO, Chief Educational Officer and Chief Development Officer. We typically look at 7-10 higher education institutions, some of which are competitors to Moody. We choose institutions of comparable mission and size (based upon total expenses). We look at 3-4 parachurch organizations (of generally comparable size) as well. This data is used as a salary administration benchmark. To increase its applicability, the data is adjusted for cost of living differences (based upon the location of the other institutions) in relation to the cost of living in the greater Chicago area.Following this analysis, which is provided for review by the Compensation Committee of the Board in the spring of each calendar year, the President's salary increase recommendations are based upon Institute salary guidelines for the fiscal year(which reflect trends in national average salary increases) and upon job performance. The Compensation Committee can either approve or disapprove the President's recommendations. Increases for officers and other key employees are scheduled for October of each year, so that the financial condition and performance of the institution at the close of the prior fiscal year can be taken into account.The President's salary increase is scheduled at the same time and is set by the Board (in the context of the data provided and the current fiscal year salary guidelines for the Institute)."

The Compensation Committees' operating procedures are designed to ensure that the compensation of all such officers and key employees is reasonable (i.e. the value of services is the amount that would ordinarily be paid for like services by like enterprises under like circumstances), and to follow the specific steps outlined in the IRC regulations for establishing the rebuttable presumption of reasonableness that a transaction is not an excess benefit transaction. The Compensation Committee consists exclusively of independent trustees without any conflict of interest (as defined in the applicable IRC regulations) with regard to the compensation arrangements being reviewed or approved. The absence of any conflict of interest with respect to items on that meeting's agenda is confirmed at the beginning of each meeting of the Compensation Committee. The Compensation Committee selects and engages an independent, qualified compensation consultant which performs such valuations on a regular basis to provide appropriate comparability data. Comparability data includes, but is not limited to, compensation levels paid by similarly situated organizations, both taxable and tax-exempt, for functionally comparable positions; the availability of similar services in Mount Sinai's geographic area; current compensation surveys compiled by independent firms; customized surveys in specific circumstances, and actual written offers from similar institutions competing for the services of the disqualified person. The sources of the comparability data used by the compensation consultant are provided to the Compensation Committee. The Compensation Committee receives and reviews the comparability data and any analysis provided by the consultant, as well as information provided by management or, in the case of the CEO, by the Chairman of the Board of Trustees, including information about the CEO's performance. For the CEO, the Committee then determines an appropriate level of total compensation in relation to the comparability data. For the other executives and key employees, the Committee also reviews the position description, the credentials of the incumbent or the candidate for the position, an incumbent's performance appraisal, and the CEO's (or Chairman of the Board's, with respect to the CEO) recommendation, in relation to the comparability data, and decides whether to approve the recommended compensation or to modify it. The Compensation Committee discusses and votes on the compensation arrangements for the CEO, CFO and other senior executive staff members in executive session. The Compensation Committee contemporaneously documents in written minutes the terms of the transaction that was approved and the date it was approved; the members of the Compensation Committee who were present during debate on the transaction that was approved and those who voted on it; the comparability data and information from management obtained and relied on, and how the comparability data was obtained; and the Compensation Committee's basis for the decisions, if the approved compensation is outside the range of comparability data. These minutes are prepared before the later of the next meeting of the Compensation Committee or 60 days after the final actions of the Compensation Committee are taken with respect to the compensation decisions made. The minutes are reviewed and approved by the Compensation Committee within a reasonable time thereafter."
