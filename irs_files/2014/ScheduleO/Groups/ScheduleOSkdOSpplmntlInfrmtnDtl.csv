201423179349301927,226019101,JFK MEDICAL CENTER HISTORY,"JFK BEGAN IN THE 1960'S IN RESPONSE TO THE INCREASING DEMAND FOR HEALTH CARE SERVICES CREATED BY RAPID POPULATION GROWTH IN EDISON TOWNSHIP AND ITS SURROUNDING COMMUNITIES. THE LATE EDISON MAYOR ANTHONY M. YELENCSICS, FOR WHOM THE ORIGINAL COMMUNITY HOSPITAL WAS NAMED, LED A GRASSROOTS EFFORT TO OPEN A HOSPITAL TO MEET THIS DEMAND. FOLLOWING A FUNDRAISING CAMPAIGN PIONEERED BY TRUSTEES, PHYSICIANS, AUXILIANS AND COMMUNITY RESIDENTS, THE ORIGINAL 205-BED HOSPITAL OPENED ITS DOORS AND ADMITTED ITS FIRST PATIENT IN 1967. THE 1970'S REPRESENTED A PERIOD OF SIGNIFICANT GROWTH FOR JFK. ONE OF THE MOST IMPORTANT HIGHLIGHTS IN ITS HISTORY WAS THE OPENING OF THE JFK JOHNSON REHABILITATION INSTITUTE (""JRI"") IN 1974 FOLLOWING A MERGER WITH MIDDLESEX REHABILITATION HOSPITAL. SINCE THAT TIME, JRI HAS FORGED A REPUTATION FOR EXCELLENCE IN PATIENT CARE AND HAS BECOME A NATIONAL LEADER IN PHYSICAL REHABILITATION MEDICINE. JRI WAS ONE OF THE FIRST REHABILITATION CENTERS IN THE NATION TO RECOGNIZE THAT INDIVIDUALS WITH ACQUIRED TRAUMATIC BRAIN INJURY REQUIRE A SPECIALIZED TREATMENT ENVIRONMENT. WITH ITS UNPRECEDENTED, COMPREHENSIVE APPROACH TO CARE, JRI'S CENTER FOR HEAD INJURIES IS REGARDED AS PIONEERING IN HEAD TRAUMA EVALUATION AND TREATMENT. IN ADDITION, JRI'S PEDIATRIC REHABILITATION DEPARTMENT PROVIDES CHILDREN WITH THE ADAPTIVE AND COPING SKILLS THEY NEED TO ACHIEVE SUCCESS IN EVERYDAY LIFE THROUGH PHYSICAL AND OCCUPATIONAL THERAPY. JRI ALSO OFFERS INPATIENT AND DAY REHABILITATION, OUTPATIENT THERAPIES, AND PROSTHETICS AND ORTHOTICS. JFK ALSO OPENED ITS RADIATION THERAPY CENTER AND ITS FAMILY PRACTICE CENTER DURING THIS DECADE. JFK REACHED A SIGNIFICANT MILESTONE IN 1992 WHEN IT OPENED THE NEW JERSEY NEUROSCIENCE INSTITUTE (""INSTITUTE""), WHICH IS A NATIONALLY RECOGNIZED COMPREHENSIVE CENTER FOR THE DIAGNOSIS, TREATMENT, AND STUDY OF NEUROLOGICAL DISEASE. THE INSTITUTE CONTINUES TO ATTRACT TOP NEUROSCIENCE EXPERTS FROM ACROSS THE UNITED STATES. IT ALSO WORKS TO PROMOTE INVESTIGATIVE EFFORTS IN BASIC AND CLINICAL RESEARCH. OTHER SIGNIFICANT ADDITIONS THAT OCCURRED OVER THE PAST THREE DECADES INCLUDED JFK'S CANCER CENTER, WHICH FEATURES STATE-OF-THE-ART CANCER DIAGNOSIS AND TREATMENT CAPABILITIES, HOSPICE CARE AND PARTICIPATION IN NATIONWIDE CANCER RESEARCH NETWORKS; JFK'S OUTPATIENT MEDIPLEX SURGERY CENTER WHICH PROVIDES SAME-DAY PROCEDURES, INCLUDING LASER, ENDOSCOPIC AND ARTHROSCOPIC SURGERY, JFK'S IMAGING CENTER AND BREAST CENTER.

Translation services for patients - Cooper provides translation services for patients whose first language is not English 6. Camden Coalition of Healthcare Providers - Cooper provides significant support to this organization which was created as an opportunity for providers to network and discuss the common issues they face in running medical practices in Camden and providing care in a poor, urban environment. Camden Citywide Care Management Project In September 2007, the Coalition began implementation of a Citywide Care Management Project to reach out to high utilizers of city emergency rooms and hospitals. A part-time nurse practitioner, community health worker, and a full-time social worker staff the project. Patients are enrolled to the project by referral from emergency department physicians, inpatient physicians, and social workers. The project provides ""transitional"" primary care with a goal of moving the patients into a primary care setting that can meet their needs. With over sixty patients enrolled in our project; we are visiting them in homeless shelters, abandoned homes, hospital rooms, ED gurneys, and street corners. Practice Capacity Building Project The Coalition's philosophy is that by increasing capacity within local primary care offices we can help them achieve higher patient satisfaction, improved economic viability, and better health outcomes. Monthly roundtable meetings and seminars have been held for local office managers and providers to encourage peer-to-peer linkages, increase skills and knowledge of modern medical office management techniques and educate in specific practice management topics. Participation in this group leads to on-site consultation for individual offices, focusing on process flows, operations management, analyzing cycle times, and information management. Expansion of Access to Mental Health Care Psychiatry services are extremely difficult to access in underserved communities. The Coalition is developing a system of joint primary care/psychiatry appointments to increase a primary care provider's capacity to provide mental health care. The psychiatrist will provide mentoring, coaching and consultation to the primary provider. Palliative Care Program The Palliative Care Program is designed to be integrated as part of a patient's care plan at any time, to manage symptoms related to treatment such as chemotherapy, or for symptoms that linger or appear after treatment is complete. Palliative care is the comprehensive treatment of the discomfort, symptoms and stress of serious illness. It does not replace a patient's primary treatment, but works together with treatment at any point in a patient's care. Palliative care also addresses psychological, social and spiritual concerns - all to achieve the best quality of life possible for each patient. At Cooper, the Palliative Care Program can help patients manage the common side effects of illness such as: pain, fatigue, nausea, constipation, diarrhea, depression and anxiety, difficulty breathing, loss of appetite and weight loss, weakness, sleep problems, confusion and end-of-life care. Research-clinical and community health The Cooper Research Institute, established in January 2003, coordinates clinical trials and supports researchers at Cooper. Through basic and clinical research, faculty at Cooper is bringing scientific discoveries to life and providing thousands of patients in South Jersey with access to cutting-edge treatments in fields such as cancer, cardiology, critical care, diabetes, and gene therapy. Cooper faculty members currently conduct approximately 340 NIH and industry-sponsored clinical trials each year. Many of these studies are only available in South Jersey at Cooper. By participating in a clinical trial, an individual may have the first chance to benefit from improved treatment methods and the opportunity to make an important contribution to medical science. Past research by Cooper faculty has led to new standards of care and novel therapies in fields such as cancer, cardiology, surgery, and orthopedics. For example, Cooper faculty members have conducted studies that led to: new cancer treatments such as Rituxan for lymphoma, Iressa for advanced non-small cell lung cancer, Tamoxifen to prevent breast cancer, and Cisplatin plus radiation therapy for cervical cancer. Among other medical advances credited to the Cooper Research Institute are: Cash in kind contributions to community groups Cooper sponsors various non-profit organizations to promote and build a healthy community."

THE FBI'S JEWELRY AND GEM PROGRAM HAS DESIGNATED GIA AS A PARTNER LISTED ON THE FBI WEBSITE IN COMBATING GEM THEFT. IN 2013, THE LABORATORY FLAGGED 914 STOLEN GEMSTONES IN ITS DATABASE, AND RECOVERED 33 GEMSTONES IN CASES IN WHICH STONES WERE RESUBMITTED TO THE LABORATORY AFTER HAVING BEEN STOLEN. GIA ALSO REGULARLY ASSISTS OTHER GOVERNMENT AGENCIES. IN 2013, GIA ISSUED 11 DIAMOND GRADING REPORTS FOR LAW ENFORCEMENT AGENCIES. FURTHERMORE, GIA PROVIDED SUPPORT AND INFORMATION TO THE DEPARTMENT OF HOMELAND SECURITY. THE LABORATORY FULFILLS ITS MISSION BY EXAMINING AND CLASSIFYING INDIVIDUAL GEM MATERIALS SUBMITTED TO THE GIA LABORATORY AND ITS INTERNATIONAL SUBSIDIARIES' LABORATORIES. DIAMONDS AND SYNTHETIC DIAMONDS ARE IDENTIFIED AND GRADED, WITH REPORTS ISSUED ON THEIR PRECISE IDENTIFYING FEATURES AND WITH QUALITY ASSESSMENTS ON THE 4CS: COLOR, CLARITY, CUT AND CARAT WEIGHT. COLORED GEMSTONES, SYNTHETIC COLORED STONES, PEARLS AND CULTURED PEARLS ARE IDENTIFIED, WITH REPORTS ISSUED UPON CLIENT REQUEST. THE DISTINGUISHING CHARACTERISTICS AND FEATURES OF A GIVEN GEM ARE UNIQUE TO THAT GEM IN MUCH THE SAME WAY A FINGERPRINT IS UNIQUE TO AN INDIVIDUAL PERSON. ONCE A GEM HAS BEEN SUBMITTED FOR EXAMINATION, ITS CHARACTERISTICS AND FEATURES ARE RECORDED FOR FUTURE REFERENCE IN CASE IT IS EVER RESUBMITTED, EITHER IN THE NORMAL COURSE OF EVENTS OR IN QUESTIONABLE CIRCUMSTANCES, SUCH AS WITH LOST OR STOLEN ITEMS. ADDITIONALLY, IF REQUESTED BY THE CLIENT, AN IDENTIFICATION CODE CAN BE LASER INSCRIBED UPON THE GEM. THE SUBSTANTIAL AND CONTINUOUS VOLUME OF GEM MATERIALS THAT ARE SUBMITTED FOR EXAMINATION, TOGETHER WITH THE LARGE COLLECTION OF COMPARISON GEMS ACQUIRED BY GIA, CONSTITUTE AN INVALUABLE DATABASE FOR THE RESEARCH AND PUBLIC SERVICE CONDUCTED BY THE INSTITUTE. TO MAKE THIS PUBLIC SERVICE POSSIBLE, GIA CHARGES RELATIVELY MODEST FEES THAT VARY BY THE TYPE AND SIZE OF THE GEM MATERIAL. IT SHOULD BE NOTED THAT GIA DOES NOT APPRAISE ANY GEM MATERIALS OR OTHERWISE ESTABLISH THEIR MARKET VALUE. COMMERCE IN GEMS HAS BECOME MORE GLOBAL OVER THE PAST DECADE, WITH THE RESULT THAT MANY GEM MATERIALS ARE SOLD BY FOREIGN GEM OWNERS OR DEALERS BUT ULTIMATELY FIND THEIR WAY TO THE U.S. MARKET, EITHER THROUGH WHOLESALE DISTRIBUTION OR FUTURE RESALE. MOST DIAMONDS PURCHASED IN THE U.S. HAVE BEEN MINED AND PROCESSED OUTSIDE OF THIS COUNTRY. SOME PROPORTION OF THOSE DIAMONDS HAVE HISTORICALLY NOT BEEN SUBMITTED TO GIA'S LABORATORY BECAUSE OF THE GEOGRAPHIC DISTANCE BETWEEN GIA'S LABORATORY FACILITIES IN CALIFORNIA AND NEW YORK AND THE FAR FLUNG LOCATIONS OF MINES AND DEALERS. TO ENHANCE ITS ABILITY TO PURSUE THE MISSION OF PROTECTING THE GEM PURCHASING PUBLIC, DETERRING THEFT, AND ASSISTING IN RECOVERY OF STOLEN PROPERTY AND PROSECUTION OF CRIMINALS, GIA OPERATES LABORATORIES THROUGH ITS BRANCHES AND WHOLLY-OWNED SUBSIDIARIES IN BOTSWANA, HONG KONG, INDIA, ISRAEL, JAPAN, SOUTH AFRICA, AND THAILAND; AND GIA OPERATES AN INTAKE OFFICE OFFERING LOGISTICAL SUPPORT THROUGH ITS WHOLLY-OWNED SUBSIDIARY IN UNITED ARAB EMIRATES."

Each employee is expected to report a potential conflict of interest when it arises.3. A. An employee will report a potential conflict by initiating a Potential Conflict of Interest Disclosure Form and delivering it to his/her vice president. All employee potential conflicts will be screened by two levels of senior management to identify conflict or duality of interest situations.

MISSION ======= WE ARE A COMMUNITY OF CAREGIVERS COMMITTED TO A MINISTRY OF HEALING, EMBRACING THE TRADITION OF CATHOLIC PRINCIPLES, THE PURSUIT OF PROFESSIONAL EXCELLENCE, AND CONSCIENTIOUS STEWARDSHIP. WE HELP OUR COMMUNITY ACHIEVE THE HIGHEST ATTAINABLE LEVEL OF HEALTH THROUGH EDUCATION, PREVENTION AND TREATMENT. HISTORY ======= THE MEDICAL CENTER WAS FOUNDED BY THE CONGREGATION OF THE SISTERS OF ST. JOSEPH OF PEACE (THE ""SISTERS"") IN 1925, AND IN 1958 WAS INCORPORATED AS AN INDEPENDENT NEW JERSEY NON-PROFIT CORPORATION, SPONSORED BY THE SISTERS. IT WAS THE DEDICATION OF TWO TEANECK SURGEONS AND THE LEADERSHIP OF A SISTER THAT MADE HNMC A REALITY IN 1925. RECOGNIZING THE NEED TO SERVE THE SICK AND INDIGENT OF THE COMMUNITY, DRS. FRANK MCCORMACK AND GEORGE PITKIN APPEALED TO MOTHER GENERAL AGATHA BROWN OF THE SISTERS FOR HELP IN FINDING A SUITABLE MEDICAL CENTER SITE AND PROVIDING ADMINISTRATIVE AND NURSING STAFF. THE SISTERS PURCHASED THE ESTATE OF THE LATE WILLIAM WALTER PHELPS AND ERECTED THE MEDICAL CENTER THERE, STAFFING IT WITH SISTERS. AT ITS OPENING IN 1925, HNMC BOASTED 115 BEDS. FIVE YEARS LATER, A 90-BED CLINIC BUILDING WAS BUILT TO MEET THE NEEDS OF AREA RESIDENTS WHO HAD BEEN IMPOVERISHED BY THE GREAT DEPRESSION. TEANECK WAS LITTLE MORE THAN A RURAL VILLAGE THEN; IN ALL OF BERGEN COUNTY THERE WERE SOME 250,000 INHABITANTS. WITH THE COMPLETION OF THE GEORGE WASHINGTON BRIDGE IN 1931, A SURGE OF DEVELOPMENT FOLLOWED WORLD WAR II, AND THE AREA SOON BECAME A THRIVING RESIDENTIAL AND BUSINESS COMMUNITY. HNMC THRIVED AS WELL. IN 1955 A SECOND ADDITION WAS COMPLETED: THE FOUR-STORY, 110-BED MARIAN BUILDING, WITH TWO MORE STORIES ADDED TO THE FACILITY WITHIN THE NEXT TEN YEARS. DURING THE 1960'S, THE WEST WING OF THE MARIAN BUILDING WAS ENLARGED BY THREE MORE UNITS. FACED AGAIN WITH THE THREAT OF OVERCROWDING IN THE 1980'S, THE MEDICAL CENTER COMPLEX WAS ONCE MORE ENLARGED WITH CONSTRUCTION OF THE BRESLIN/KENNEDY BUILDING. IN 1993 THE ""NEW ADDITION"" WAS CONSTRUCTED, PRINCIPALLY TO ACCOMMODATE THE INCREASING AMBULATORY AND SAME-DAY-STAY PATIENTS, AND A NEW PHYSICAL MEDICINE BUILDING WAS ADDED. A FOUR-LEVEL REGIONAL CANCER CENTER WAS COMPLETED IN THE LATE 1990'S. MORE RECENT ADDITIONS INCLUDE A NEW 41-BAY EMERGENCY DEPARTMENT, A HEALTH AND FITNESS CENTER, AND A RESIDENTIAL HOSPICE, VILLA MARIE CLAIRE. THE MEDICAL CENTER HAS GROWN IN SIZE, REPUTATION AND CAPABILITY WITH EACH ADDITION. AS HNMC CELEBRATES ALMOST 90 YEARS, IT CONTINUES TO TAKE STEPS TO BECOME A NATIONAL MODEL BY IMPLEMENTING NEW, ADVANCED TECHNOLOGIES AND MEDICAL/SURGICAL TECHNIQUES, AS WELL AS BEST PRACTICES IN PROCESSES SUCH AS MEDICATION ADMINISTRATION, HEALTHCARE INFORMATION SYSTEMS, DISASTER PREPAREDNESS, AND BUILDING CONSTRUCTION AND DESIGN. IMPROVEMENTS SUCH AS THESE ALLOW HNMC TO PROVIDE EVERY PATIENT WITH A SUPERIOR EXPERIENCE CHARACTERIZED BY SAFE, HIGH QUALITY CARE. LEADING-EDGE CARE ================= HNMC IS A COMPREHENSIVE, 361-BED ACUTE CARE FACILITY PROVIDING LEADING-EDGE MEDICAL PRACTICE AND TECHNOLOGY ADMINISTERED IN AN ENVIRONMENT ROOTED IN A TRADITION OF COMPASSION AND RESPECT FOR EVERY PATIENT.

ALTHOUGH THE ED GENERALLY IS ABLE TO COVER ITS COSTS, IT PROVIDES A SIGNIFICANT AMOUNT OF UNCOMPENSATED CARE AND IS A WELL-USED RESOURCE FOR MANY WITHOUT INSURANCE WHO RELY ON IT FOR CARE.

EMERGENCY PREPAREDNESS ====================== DURING 2013, HNMC WAS ONE OF NINE HOSPITALS IN NEW JERSEY DESIGNATED BY THE NEW JERSEY DEPARTMENT OF HEALTH (""NJDOH"") AS A REGIONAL MEDICAL COORDINATION CENTER (""MCC""). THE ONLY FACILITY IN BERGEN COUNTY TO BE SO DESIGNATED, HNMC'S ON-CAMPUS MCC'S PURPOSE IS ACTIVATION IN THE EVENT OF PUBLIC HEALTH EMERGENCIES AND/OR A TERRORIST ATTACK CAUSING MASS CASUALTY INCIDENTS, INFECTIOUS OR COMMUNICABLE DISEASE, OR OTHER TYPES OF PUBLIC HEALTH DISRUPTION. THE MCC ALSO MONITORS, ON A DAILY BASIS, SITUATIONAL AWARENESS OF LOCAL ACTIVITY. DURING 2013, THE MCC WAS ACTIVATED FOR SEVERAL STATE EMERGENCIES. THE STATE OF NEW JERSEY FUNDED A COORDINATOR FOR THE MCC, BUT ALL OTHER EMERGENCY PREPAREDNESS ACTIVITIES, WHICH ARE DESIGNED TO PROTECT THE PUBLIC AND TO RESPOND IN THE EVENT OF ANY PUBLIC HEALTH EMERGENCY, WERE CARRIED OUT BY HNMC WITHOUT FINANCIAL ASSISTANCE. GIVEN HNMC'S PROXIMITY TO NEW YORK CITY (I.E., FIVE MILES NORTH OF THE GEORGE WASHINGTON BRIDGE), EMERGENCY PREPAREDNESS IS NECESSARY TO ENSURE THE HEALTH AND WELL-BEING OF THE COMMUNITY, REGARDLESS OF THE MCC DESIGNATION. HNMC IS RECOGNIZED BY STATE AND FEDERAL SECTORS FOR ITS EXPERTISE IN EMERGENCY PREPAREDNESS AND RESPONSE. LOCALLY, HNMC'S MCC COORDINATOR ALSO SERVES AS THE EMS COORDINATOR OF THE BERGEN COUNTY OFFICE OF EMERGENCY MANAGEMENT AND IS A MEMBER OF THE BERGEN COUNTY TERRORISM TASK FORCE.

The Board Committee establishes that no member has any conflict of interest with regard to the executive compensation arrangements being approved.

The committee relies on the comparability data to reach consensus that its recommendations to the Board regarding executive compensation changes are reasonable and in line with this organization's overall total compensation philosophy for executive pay. The deliberation and decisions of the committee are contemporaneously substantiated. The compensation for positions held by Key Employees not included in the process above, is determined based on a thorough review of numerous compensation studies conducted by nationally recognized, independent firms that provide market data for total compensation for similar positions.

201443169349304594,111633486,SERVING COMMUNITIES WITH HEALTH DISPARITIES IMPROVING ACCESS TO CARE,"Winthrop's Women's Wellness OB/GYN Center in Hempstead offers a wide variety of obstetrical and gynecological services, as well as on-site risk assessment, psychosocial counseling, postpartum depression screening and referrals, domestic and sexual abuse screening, nutritional and gestational diabetes education, assessment of living conditions and cultural diversity. The site features a Medicaid Enrollment Specialist for uninsured patients; Charity Care Application and self-pay rates are available as well. They participate with NYS Medicaid and many Medicaid Managed Care HMO plans. The Center participates with the Baby Basics Program, which helps put everyone ""on the same page""-from physician and staff, to patient and families-and strengthens the delivery of prenatal care, education and support to vulnerable populations. During 2012, 917 ""new"" OB and GYN patients were seen; there were an additional 5,284 follow-up visits from established patients. From January through October, 2013, there were 719 new patients, with an additional 5,975 follow-up visits. The Center averages 700 visits per month with approximately 45 new OB patients a month. Financial services were provided to over 600 patients during this time period. The Hempstead Pediatric Practice draws patients primarily from the Hempstead community but also serves children, from newborn to age 21, from the surrounding neighborhoods (Elmont, Freeport, Uniondale and Roosevelt). In addition, Winthrop's Pediatric Specialty Center in Mineola sends a Pediatric Pulmonologist and an Adolescent Pediatrician to the Hempstead location on a regular basis to allow for easier access to these services. In 2012 alone, a total of 12,873 patients were treated at the facility. From January through October, 2013, 11,537 patients were treated. Year round, Hempstead Practice collaborates with community-based organizations at Health Fairs and community events so that the parents of Hempstead and the surrounding communities know that we are available and ready to be of service to them and their children. The physicians and staff also meet with members of the Hagedorn Children's Center, the Hispanic Counseling Center and the Economic Opportunity Commission to work in partnership to better serve the community. By partnering with the Hispanic Counseling Center, the Pediatric practice is able to provide counseling services to at-risk patients. Children are able to begin sessions at the Pediatric Office, an environment that is familiar to them, and have services at the practice. If continuing sessions are needed, they are transitioned to the Hispanic Counseling Center when they are comfortable attending sessions at that site. The Hempstead High School Health Center (HHHC) is a school-based Health Center, which has been providing services for enrolled students since 1997. In 2012-2013, there were over 5,000 visits to the Center by approximately 1,400 enrolled students. Comprehensive preventive, episodic and confidential healthcare was provided. Winthrop has also implemented specific programs needed by the school's population, including: - Youth support groups in English and Spanish that address common adolescent issues such as acculturation, adolescent adjustment, alternative lifestyles, teen pregnancy and prevention, parenting teens, and violence prevention, including gang violence. - A ""Positive PPD Chest Clinic"" that provides students with screening, free chest x-ray and access to preventive medications. Arrangements are made for students who test positive to have the proper treatment, whether it is through a private healthcare provider or the clinic if insurance currently is not in place. - An Asthma Management Program that monitors and tracks students with asthma. This effort is particularly significant in Hempstead, where asthma rates are nearly double those of adjacent neighborhoods. Collaboration with primary care physicians in the community facilitates treatment that meets current medical standards, trains high school nurses and staff about asthma, and offers access to free medications to those students without health coverage."

A trained Health Educator offers the Workshops ""FREE"" in the early evening every month at Winthrop. The Workshops are also offered in the community and workplace settings, thus eliminating the barriers of transportation and time. FALLS PREVENTION Summary of Efforts to reduce falls The Hospital's efforts to reduce the rate of falls resulting in injury to seniors in Nassau County included the following: - Raising community awareness of the serious impact of falls - Conducting screenings and risk assessments for falls - Educating seniors, caregivers and other interested people (target population) about identifying and modifying risk factors and methods of preventing falls - Tracking and evaluating outcomes for program effectiveness - Going into community-based organizations to offer programs Successes In Year Four, the following was accomplished: - Additional classes were added to the Falls Prevention program. This included balance/strength exercises at a higher level as the senior progresses, balance assessment and reassessment, demonstration of how to get up from a fall (Be Prepared) and Walking for Strength and Balance. - Creation of an inpatient geriatric discharge report, notifying these individuals about upcoming Falls Prevention programs - Establishment of a tracking mechanism by creating a database of program attendees and a post-workshop outcomes evaluation tool - Collaborating with the ""Project Independence"" (aging in place) initiative to offer the four-weeks series at the ""Yes We Can"" community center in Westbury, a community experiencing health disparities Overall Participation Winthrop's Fall Prevention Program has been, by almost any measure, an outstanding success, with significant growth each year. Participation was as follows: year one, 360; year two, 485; year three, 1100. Due to promotional materials and outreach efforts to the community from September 2012 to August 2013, year four of the Prevention Agenda, 127 fall prevention and exercise programs were offered at the Winthrop Welcome Center and out in the community, with more than 1900 participants. Programs included ""What are the Risks for a Fall,"" ""Risks and Tips to Prevent Falls,"" ""Exercise & Balance,"" ""Walking for Balance and Strength,"" ""Be Prepared"" and ""Balance Assessment & Reassessment"". Addressing Barriers As the popularity of the programs increased, with the space constraint at the Winthrop Welcome Center we have had to turn away prospective participants for our programs. For this reason Winthrop, added more classes and hired an additional registered nurse to meet the need, and to travel to more communities throughout the year."

COMPENSATION FOR 2013 OF THESE UPPER LEVEL EXECUTIVES INCLUDES THE PAYOUT OF AN ANNUAL INCENTIVE PLAN AND A LONG-TERM INCENTIVE PLAN. THIS PERFORMANCE-ORIENTED PROGRAM CONDITIONS PAYMENTS UPON THE ACHIEVEMENT OF MULTIPLE INDIVIDUAL AND GROUP PERFORMANCE MEASURES. MEASURES TO MONITOR PERFORMANCE INCLUDE: OPERATIONAL AND FINANCIAL STRENGTH, PATIENT QUALITY AND SAFETY, PATIENT SATISFACTION, ADVANCEMENT OF PATIENT CARE, AND PEOPLE DEVELOPMENT AND PARTNERSHIP. INCENTIVE AWARDS MAY ONLY BE GRANTED IF THE ORGANIZATION ACHIEVES A FINANCIAL SURPLUS. EVEN IF ALL RELEVANT PERFORMANCE MEASUREMENTS ARE ACHIEVED, THE NYP BOARD OF TRUSTEES RETAINS FULL DISCRETION TO MAKE OR NOT MAKE ANY INCENTIVE AWARDS, OR TO REDUCE THE AMOUNT OF ANY INCENTIVE AWARD. THIS INITIATIVE IS CRITICAL TO ASSURING THAT NYP HAS THE REQUISITE LEADERSHIP TO CREATE AND MANAGE A HIGHLY MOTIVATED AND ENGAGED WORKFORCE, TO DRIVE SUPERIOR PERFORMANCE THROUGHOUT THE ORGANIZATION AND TO ACHIEVE TOP TIER MEDICAL CENTER STATUS.

THE SUPPLEMENTAL EXECUTIVE RETIREMENT PLAN (SERP) IS SUBJECT TO A MULTI-YEAR VESTING REQUIREMENT (COMMENCING AFTER FIVE YEARS OF PARTICIPATION IN THE SERP, IN PRORATED AMOUNTS THROUGH AGE 65) WHICH PLACES AN EXECUTIVE'S SUPPLEMENTAL RETIREMENT BENEFIT AT RISK OF FORFEITURE IF THE VESTING REQUIREMENTS ARE NOT SATISFIED. ONCE VESTED, HOWEVER, PROVISIONS OF THE INTERNAL REVENUE CODE REQUIRE THAT THE VESTED EXECUTIVE INCLUDE IN CURRENT INCOME THE VALUE OF HIS OR HER VESTED SUPPLEMENTAL RETIREMENT BENEFIT. NOTWITHSTANDING THE LEGAL REQUIREMENT TO RECOGNIZE THE VESTED VALUE OF THE SUPPLEMENTAL RETIREMENT BENEFIT AS CURRENT INCOME, THE SUPPLEMENTAL RETIREMENT BENEFIT WILL NOT BE DISTRIBUTED TO THE EXECUTIVE UNTIL THE EXECUTIVE ACTUALLY RETIRES FROM NYP (ALTHOUGH, AS PERMITTED BY THE INTERNAL REVENUE CODE, THE SUPPLEMENTAL RETIREMENT PLAN WILL EFFECT A DISTRIBUTION OF AN AMOUNT NECESSARY TO SATISFY THE EXECUTIVE'S TAX LIABILITY RELUSTING FROM THE INCOME RECOGNITION UPON VESTING). AS NOTED, THIS SUPPLEMENTAL RETIREMENT BENEFIT WILL NOT BE DISTRIBUTED TO THE EXECUTIVE UNTIL THE EXECUTIVE ACTUALLY RETIRES FROM NYP.

AS IN PAST YEARS, THE EXECUTIVE COMPENSATION COMMITTEE OF NYP REQUIRES A THIRD PARTY COMPLETE A REVIEW OF THE ORGANIZATION'S COMPENSATION PROGRAM TO ENSURE ITS EFFECTIVENESS IN TERMS OF GOVERNMENT REGULATIONS, MARKET CONDITIONS AND THE NEED TO CONTINUALLY ELEVATE ORGANIZATIONAL PERFORMANCE. THE REPORT ALSO SERVES TO MEET THE REGULATORY OBLIGATIONS TO ENSURE THAT ALL ELEMENTS OF THE EXECUTIVE COMPENSATION PROGRAMS ARE REASONABLE.

Inpatient Care Centers of Excellence ------------------------------------ Inspira Medical Center Vineland operates four inpatient care centers: - Women's & Children's Center of Care - Home-like labor and delivery suites - Surgical Center of Care - 10 operating suites, a modern ICU/CCU and rehabilitation services - Medical Center of Care - Acute, ICU and post-ICU, dialysis, chemotherapy and medical infusion services - Cardiology Center of Care - 37 bed cardiac acute care unit, ICU and post-ICU and cardiopulmonary unit The inpatient care centers allow for the co-location of like acute and critical care units. The surgical intensive care unit is adjacent to the surgical step-down/post-intensive care unit. This step-down unit is likewise adjacent to the surgical acute care beds. As the patient's illness or injury becomes less acute, the patient can move down this continuum of care without ever physically leaving the inpatient care centers. This configuration also simplifies physicians' rounds. All patient rooms at the Inspira Medical Center Vineland are single patient rooms which increases patient privacy, confidentiality and comfort. The use of private rooms allows for more efficient care and reduces the risk of patients contracting a nosocomial infection during their stay. Also, given the increase in patient acuity and the corresponding increase in demand for more equipment, private rooms provide more space for specialized equipment and caregivers at the bedside. Rooms at Inspira Medical Center Vineland are designed with viewing windows along the hallway allowing patients to be observed by medical personnel without being disturbed.

INSPIRA HEALTH NETWORK, INC. (""NETWORK"") IS THE TAX-EXEMPT PARENT ENTITY OF THE SYSTEM. NETWORK'S BOARD OF DIRECTORS HAS AN EXECUTIVE COMPENSATION COMMITTEE (""COMMITTEE""). THE COMMITTEE HAS ADOPTED A WRITTEN EXECUTIVE COMPENSATION PHILOSOPHY WHICH IT FOLLOWS WHEN IT REVIEWS AND APPROVES OF THE COMPENSATION AND BENEFITS OF THE ORGANIZATION'S SENIOR MANAGEMENT, INCLUDING THE PRESIDENT/CHIEF EXECUTIVE OFFICER AND EXECUTIVE VICE PRESIDENT/CHIEF FINANCIAL OFFICER. THE COMMITTEE REVIEWS THE ""TOTAL COMPENSATION"" OF THE INDIVIDUALS WHICH IS INTENDED TO INCLUDE BOTH CURRENT AND DEFERRED COMPENSATION AND ALL EMPLOYEE BENEFITS, BOTH QUALIFIED AND NON-QUALIFIED. THE COMMITTEE'S REVIEW IS DONE ON AT LEAST AN ANNUAL BASIS AND ENSURES THAT THE ""TOTAL COMPENSATION"" OF SENIOR MANAGEMENT OF THE ORGANIZATION IS REASONABLE. THE ACTIONS TAKEN BY THE COMMITTEE ENABLE THE ORGANIZATION TO RECEIVE THE REBUTTABLE PRESUMPTION OF REASONABLENESS FOR PURPOSES OF INTERNAL REVENUE CODE SECTION 4958 WITH RESPECT TO THE TOTAL COMPENSATION OF CERTAIN MEMBERS OF THE SENIOR MANAGEMENT TEAM, INCLUDING THE PRESIDENT/CHIEF EXECUTIVE OFFICER AND EXECUTIVE VICE PRESIDENT/CHIEF FINANCIAL OFFICER. THE THREE FACTORS WHICH MUST BE SATISFIED IN ORDER TO RECEIVE THE REBUTTABLE PRESUMPTION OF REASONABLENESS ARE THE FOLLOWING: 1. THE COMPENSATION ARRANGEMENT IS APPROVED IN ADVANCE BY AN ""AUTHORIZED BODY"" OF THE APPLICABLE TAX-EXEMPT ORGANIZATION WHICH IS COMPOSED ENTIRELY OF INDIVIDUALS WHO DO NOT HAVE A ""CONFLICT OF INTEREST"" WITH RESPECT TO THE COMPENSATION ARRANGEMENT; 2. THE AUTHORIZED BODY OBTAINED AND RELIED UPON ""APPROPRIATE DATA AS TO COMPARABILITY"" PRIOR TO MAKING ITS DETERMINATION; AND 3. THE AUTHORIZED BODY ""ADEQUATELY DOCUMENTED THE BASIS FOR ITS DETERMINATION"" CONCURRENTLY WITH MAKING THAT DETERMINATION. THE COMMITTEE IS COMPRISED OF MEMBERS OF THE BOARD OF DIRECTORS EACH OF WHO ARE INDEPENDENT AND ARE FREE FROM ANY CONFLICTS OF INTEREST. THE COMMITTEE RELIED UPON APPROPRIATE COMPARABLE DATA; SPECIFICALLY THE COMMITTEE OBTAINED A WRITTEN COMPENSATION STUDY FROM AN INDEPENDENT FIRM WHICH SPECIALIZES IN THE REVIEWING OF HOSPITAL AND HEALTHCARE SYSTEM EXECUTIVE COMPENSATION AND BENEFITS THROUGHOUT THE UNITED STATES. THIS STUDY USED COMPARABLE GEOGRAPHIC AND DEMOGRAPHIC MARKET DATA INCLUDING BUT NOT LIMITED TO SIMILAR SIZED HOSPITALS, # OF LICENSED BEDS AND NET PATIENT SERVICE REVENUE. THE COMMITTEE ADEQUATELY DOCUMENTED ITS BASIS FOR ITS DETERMINATION THROUGH THE TIMELY PREPARATION OF WRITTEN MINUTES OF THE COMPENSATION COMMITTEE MEETINGS DURING WHICH THE EXECUTIVE COMPENSATION AND BENEFITS WAS REVIEWED AND SUBSEQUENTLY APPROVED. THE ACTIONS OUTLINED ABOVE WITH RESPECT TO THE COMMITTEE AND THE ESTABLISHMENT OF THE REBUTTABLE PRESUMPTION OF REASONABLENESS ONLY APPLIES TO CERTAIN SENIOR MANAGEMENT PERSONNEL, INCLUDING BUT NOT LIMITED TO THE PRESIDENT/CHIEF EXECUTIVE OFFICER AND EXECUTIVE VICE PRESIDENT/CHIEF FINANCIAL OFFICER.

AS SUCH, OUR SUCCESS AS A COLLEGE IS MEASURED ACCORDING TO THE SUCCESS OF OUR GRADUATES. WE BELIEVE THAT A LIBERAL ARTS EDUCATION IS THE BEST PREPARATION FOR LIFE.

INDEED, WE BELIEVE THAT WHAT DEFINES A LIBERAL ARTS EDUCATION IS ITS FOCUS ON CULTIVATING IN STUDENTS CERTAIN FUNDAMENTAL ABILITIES: THE ABILITY TO THINK LOGICALLY AND ANALYTICALLY; THE ABILITY TO COMMUNICATE CLEARLY, BOTH IN WRITING AND SPEAKING; THE ABILITY TO USE EFFECTIVELY COMPUTER TECHNOLOGY; THE ABILITY TO WORK PRODUCTIVELY AS A MEMBER OF A GROUP SEEKING TO ACHIEVE A COMMON OBJECTIVE; THE ABILITY TO MAKE INFORMED JUDGMENTS, WHETHER IN THE REALM OF ETHICAL BEHAVIOR OF IN THAT OF AESTHETIC APPRECIATION; THE ABILITY TO FOSTER AND SUSTAIN AN ATTITUDE OF INTELLECTUAL CURIOSITY AND CREATIVITY; AND THE ABILITY TO RECOGNIZE AND HONOR TRUE EXCELLENCE WHEN FOUND IN ANY FORM OR CONTEXT. FURTHERMORE,WE BELIEVE THAT IT IS IMPORTANT FOR A LIBERAL ARTS EDUCATION TO CULTIVATE IN STUDENTS A DESIRE TO UNDERSTAND, A CAPACITY FOR TOLERANCE, AND AN ABILITY TO APPRECIATE THE ETHNIC AND CULTURAL DIVERSITY THAT MAKE UP HUMAN KIND. IT IS THE MISSION OF THE COLLEGE TO DEVELOP IN STUDENTS THESE ABILITIES AND ATTITUDES, AND IN SO DOING TO PROVIDE THEM AN EDUCATION THAT DIRECTS THEM TOWARD A MEANINGFUL AND SUCCESSFUL LIFE. COE'S ACADEMIC PROGRAM REFLECTS A COMMITMENT TO DEVELOPING THESE ABILITIES BY ITS INSISTENCE THAT STUDENTS ACQUIRE CERTAIN EDUCATIONAL EXPERIENCES. WE REQUIRE THAT STUDENTS COMPLETE BOTH OUR GENERAL EDUCATION REQUIREMENTS, WHICH ENSURE BREADTH OF LEARNING, AND OUR REQUIREMENTS FOR A MAJOR; WHICH GUARANTEE DEPTH OF KNOWLEDGE IN A PARTICULAR FIELD. IN ADDITION, AS PART OF EACH STUDENT'S EDUCATION, A SERIES OF INTENSIVE WRITING EXPERIENCES, SPREAD ACROSS THE FOUR YEARS OF STUDY, IS REQUIRED. BEYOND THESE REQUIREMENTS, STUDENTS ARE ENCOURAGED TO BEGIN PLANNING FOR THEIR LIVES AFTER COLLEGE EARLY ON IN THEIR UNDERGRADUATE CAREERS, AND, THROUGH CAREFUL ADVISING, THEY ARE GIVEN GUIDANCE AND DIRECTION IN THIS ENDEAVOR. INDEED, THE DEFINING FEATURE OF A COE EDUCATION IS THE REQUIREMENT THAT EVERY STUDENT PLAN AND PARTICIPATE IN ONE OF THE FOLLOWING: A SIGNIFICANT EXPERIENTIAL PROJECT, SUCH AS AN INTERNSHIP; A MAJOR SCHOLARLY UNDERTAKING; OR STUDY ABROAD. THESE EXPERIENCES WILL OFTEN, THOUGH NOT INVARIABLY, OCCUR DURING THE JUNIOR YEAR. THE HALLMARK OF A COE EDUCATION IS OUR ATTENTION TO EACH STUDENT AS AN INDIVIDUAL. IT IS ALSO IMPORTANT THAT THE COLLEGE ENVIRONMENT AT COE REFLECTS OUR COMMITMENT TO A DIVERSE STUDENT BODY AND OVERALL COLLEGE COMMUNITY. WE BELIEVE THAT THROUGH LISTENING CAREFULLY TO EACH STUDENT AS HIS OR HER INTERESTS AND UNIQUE TALENTS ARE FORMED, AND THROUGH TAILORING AN ACADEMIC PROGRAM TO SUIT EACH STUDENT'S FUTURE, WE HELP THAT STUDENT DEVELOP ABILITIES THAT PROVIDE THE BEST PREPARATION FOR LIFE."

Since 2009 Moody has annually reviewed the 990 salary information of comparable institutions to set benchmarks for this purpose. Information is accessed for the following positions: President, COO, CFO, Chief Educational Officer and Chief Development Officer. We typically look at 7-10 higher education institutions, some of which are competitors to Moody. We choose institutions of comparable mission and size (based upon total expenses). We look at 3-4 parachurch organizations (of generally comparable size) as well. This data is used as a salary administration benchmark. To increase its applicability, the data is adjusted for cost of living differences (based upon the location of the other institutions) in relation to the cost of living in the greater Chicago area.Following this analysis, which is provided for review by the Compensation Committee of the Board in the spring of each calendar year, the President's salary increase recommendations are based upon Institute salary guidelines for the fiscal year(which reflect trends in national average salary increases) and upon job performance. The Compensation Committee can either approve or disapprove the President's recommendations. Increases for officers and other key employees are scheduled for October of each year, so that the financial condition and performance of the institution at the close of the prior fiscal year can be taken into account.The President's salary increase is scheduled at the same time and is set by the Board (in the context of the data provided and the current fiscal year salary guidelines for the Institute)."

THE MISSION OF AIMMC IS TO SERVE THE HEALTH NEEDS OF INDIVIDUALS, FAMILIES, AND COMMUNITIES THROUGH A WHOLISTIC PHILOSOPHY ROOTED IN THE FUNDAMENTAL UNDERSTANDING OF HUMAN BEINGS AS CREATED IN THE IMAGE OF GOD. THE VALUES OF AIMMC SERVE AS AN INTERNAL COMPASS TO GUIDE RELATIONSHIPS AND ACTIONS. THEY INCLUDE EQUALITY, COMPASSION, EXCELLENCE, PARTNERSHIP, AND STEWARDSHIP.

EVEN IN THE FACE OF LOW REIMBURSEMENTS, AIMMC IS DEDICATED TO MAINTAINING A STRONG PRESENCE WITHIN ITS COMMUNITY AND CONTINUES TO MONITOR THESE EXPENDITURES TO MAKE CERTAIN THAT THE PROGRAMS AND SERVICES SUPPORTED ARE IN DIRECT RESPONSE TO COMMUNITY NEED. IN 2013, THE ADVOCATE NORTH SIDE NETWORK, REPORTED OVER $41.4 MILLION IN CHARITABLE CARE AND SERVICES. THESE SERVICES ARE COMPRISED OF MANY COMMUNITY HEALTH PROGRAMS FOCUSED ON IMPROVING ACCESS TO CARE, ADDRESSING SPECIAL NEEDS, AND IMPROVING OVERALL COMMUNITY HEALTH. ADVOCATE ILLINOIS MASONIC MEDICAL CENTER'S COMMUNITY BENEFITS PLAN WAS DEVELOPED TO ESTABLISH STRATEGIES FOR IMPROVING ACCESS TO CARE AND POSITIVELY AFFECTING THE HEALTH OF THE COMMUNITIES THAT IT SERVES. INCLUDED IN THE COMMUNITY BENEFITS PLAN ARE NOT ONLY PLANNED GOALS AND OBJECTIVES FOCUSED ON ADDRESSING NEEDS AS IDENTIFIED THROUGH THE HOSPITAL'S COMMUNITY HEALTH NEEDS ASSESSMENT PROCESS, BUT ALSO OTHER COMMUNITY BENEFITS SUCH AS CHARITY CARE, UNREIMBURSED MEDICAID AND MEDICARE, THAT ARE ONGOING COMMUNITY BENEFIT PROGRAMS. THE PLAN SETS THE COURSE FOR STRENGTHENING EXISTING PARTNERSHIPS AND BUILDING NEW ONES WITH INDIVIDUALS AND ORGANIZATIONS WITHIN ITS SERVICE AREA IN ORDER TO LEVERAGE AND MAXIMIZE THE IMPACT OF ITS PROGRAMS. AIMMC HAS SET FORTH FOUR GOALS AND MULTIPLE OBJECTIVES TO ACCOMPLISH THIS STRATEGY. THE GOALS AND CORRESPONDING EXAMPLES ARE PROVIDED BELOW. GOAL 1: UNDERTAKE OR SUPPORT INITIATIVES THAT ENHANCE ACCESS TO HEALTH AND WELLNESS SERVICES WITHIN THE DIVERSE COMMUNITIES AIMMC SERVES. CHARITY CARE - AIMMC OFFERS A VERY GENEROUS CHARITY CARE PROGRAM REQUIRING NO PAYMENT FROM PATIENTS MOST IN NEED, AND PROVIDING DISCOUNTS TO UNINSURED PATIENTS EARNING UP TO SIX TIMES THE FEDERAL POVERTY LEVEL AND TO INSURED PATIENTS EARNING UP TO FOUR TIMES THE POVERTY LEVEL FOR A FAMILY OF FOUR. A PATIENT'S EXTENUATING CIRCUMSTANCES ARE ALSO CONSIDERED WHEN QUALIFYING PATIENTS FOR CHARITY CARE AND IN CERTAIN CASES, ADVOCATE NORTH SIDE USES ADVOCATE OR PUBLIC RECORDS TO DETERMINE A PATIENT'S ELIGIBILITY (""PRESUMPTIVE ELIGIBILITY""). HISPANOCARE - MORE THAN 40,000 MEMBERS OF CHICAGO'S LATINO COMMUNITY BENEFIT FROM HISPANOCARE, A NETWORK OF OVER 100 BILINGUAL AND BICULTURAL HEALTH CARE PROVIDERS REPRESENTING NEARLY 150 OFFICE LOCATIONS. THE GOAL OF HISPANOCARE IS TO PROVIDE QUALITY, COST-EFFECTIVE HEALTH CARE TO CHICAGO'S LATINO COMMUNITY IN A CULTURALLY SENSITIVE MANNER. TO EASE THE FINANCIAL BURDEN, HISPANOCARE PROVIDERS AGREE TO GIVE ENROLLEES A 20 PERCENT DISCOUNT ON ALL OUT-OF-POCKET EXPENSES. MOBILE DENTAL VAN - THE MOBILE DENTAL VAN OFFERS ACCESS TO ORAL HEALTH SERVICES TO OVER 600 UNDERSERVED AND UNINSURED INDIVIDUALS EACH YEAR. PROVIDING DENTAL SCREENINGS, TREATMENT, AND EDUCATION, THE MOBILE VAN REGULARLY TRAVELS ACROSS THE CITY OF CHICAGO MAKING STOPS AT SENIOR RESIDENCES, SCHOOLS AND PRIMARY CARE CLINICS TO PROVIDE CARE TO HARD-TO-REACH AND UNDERSERVED POPULATIONS INCLUDING ELDERLY PEOPLE WITH LIMITED MOBILITY, CHILDREN FROM LOW-INCOME FAMILIES, DISABLED PERSONS, IMMIGRANTS AND THE HOMELESS. LGBTQ COMMUNITY - AIMMC IS LOCATED NEAR ONE OF THE LARGEST LESBIAN GAY BISEXUAL TRANSGENDER QUESTIONING (LGBTQ) COMMUNITIES IN THE MIDWEST. IN 2013, ADVOCATE ILLINOIS MASONIC MEDICAL CENTER WAS NAMED A LEADER IN PROVIDING EQUAL HEALTH CARE SERVICES FOR THE LGBTQ COMMUNITY BY THE HUMAN RIGHT CAMPAIGN FOUNDATION'S HEALTH CARE EQUALITY INDEX (HEI) REPORT FOR A FIFTH CONSECUTIVE YEAR. AIMMC IS ONE OF NINE FACILITIES IN ILLINOIS TO HAVE BEEN RECOGNIZED AS A LEADER, DEMONSTRATING PATIENT NON-DISCRIMINATION, EQUAL VISITATION, EMPLOYMENT NON-DISCRIMINATION, AND TRAINING IN LGBT PATIENT-CENTERED CARE. AIMMC WORKS DIRECTLY WITH THE CENTER ON HALSTED, THE MIDWEST'S MOST COMPREHENSIVE COMMUNITY CENTER DEDICATED TO BUILDING AND STRENGTHENING THE LGBTQ COMMUNITY AND THEIR FRIENDS, BY PRESENTING DIFFERENT HEALTH PRESENTATIONS AND INFORMATION TO THE DIFFERENT GROUPS WHO USE THE CENTER. MORE THAN 1,000 COMMUNITY MEMBERS VARYING IN AGE FROM YOUTH TO SENIORS VISIT THE CENTER EVERY DAY, LOCATED IN THE HEART OF CHICAGO'S LAKEVIEW NEIGHBORHOOD. BEING IN THE MIDDLE OF CHICAGO AND A LEVEL I TRAUMA CENTER, AIMMC NEEDS TO PROVIDE HEALTH CARE TO PEOPLE FROM DIFFERENT COUNTRIES WHO ARE VISITING CHICAGO. AIMMC EMPLOYS SPANISH, POLISH AND AMERICAN SIGN LANGUAGE INTERPRETERS TO BE ABLE TO PROVIDE SERVICE DURING THE DAY AS NEEDED. BESIDES THESE EMPLOYEES AIMMC PROVIDES INTERPRETER SERVICES FOR OVER 30 LANGUAGES ON A MONTHLY BASIS. GOAL 2: POSITIVELY AFFECT THE HEALTH STATUS AND QUALITY OF LIFE OF INDIVIDUALS AND POPULATIONS IN COMMUNITIES SERVED BY AIMMC THROUGH PROGRAMS AND PRACTICES THAT REFLECT AIMMC'S WHOLISTIC PHILOSOPHY. DEAF AND HARD OF HEARING PROGRAM - AIMMC'S DEAF AND HARD OF HEARING PROGRAM PROVIDES COMPREHENSIVE MENTAL HEALTH CARE IN AMERICAN SIGN LANGUAGE (ASL) TO DEAF, HARD OF HEARING AND DEAF-BLIND CHILDREN, ADOLESCENTS, AND ADULTS IN THE SIX-COUNTY CHICAGO REGION. THE PROGRAM OFFERS A CONTINUUM OF CARE THAT INCLUDES CLINICAL ASSESSMENTS; PRE-SCREENINGS AND LINKAGE; INDIVIDUAL, FAMILY AND GROUP THERAPY; PSYCHIATRIC EVALUATIONS AND MEDICATION MONITORING; AND INTERVENTION WITH A 24-HOUR PHONE LINE CONNECTED TO A TTY (TELETYPE) SYSTEM.

These advisors worked closely with the organization's finance, tax and legal associates and other members of the organization's team assembled to participate in the preparation of the Form 990. The Form 990 is reviewed by finance management, the tax manager, the VP of finance/corporate controller, the chief financial officer and Advocate's outside tax consulting firm and tax legal counsel. Prior to presenting the Form 990 to the board of director's audit committee in November, the organization's team, including its advisors, met frequently to discuss and review drafts of the Form 990. At the November audit committee meeting, the VP of finance/corporate controller and chief financial officer coordinated a review of the Form 990 with committee members, as the audit committee is the committee of the board of directors charged with oversight of audit and tax matters. The VP of finance/corporate controller and chief financial officer responded to the audit committee members' questions and provided the opportunity for detailed discussion of the Form 990. The changes identified were incorporated, and then a complete copy of the final Form 990 was provided to each member of the organization's board of directors before the Form 990 was filed. Form 990, Part VI, Line 12C DESCRIPTION OF THE PROCESS TO MONITOR TRANSACTIONS FOR CONFLICTS OF INTEREST The organization's conflict of interest policy applies to various people, including members of Advocate's board of directors, governing councils, officers, associates, volunteers, and medical staff members with administrative responsibilities. Annually, the compliance department sends this policy and the Advocate code of business conduct to a range of individuals who may be in a position to exercise substantial interest over a particular matter (defined as ""interested persons""). They are required to read the policies and provide a disclosure statement to the compliance department, which identifies activities and relationships that could potentially give rise to a conflict of interest. The chief compliance officer reviews the disclosure and provides a report to the system business conduct (compliance) committee, executive management team and the audit committee of the board for review. The report is then provided, in relevant part, to the site chief executive officers. Potential conflicts are reviewed by the compliance department on a case by case basis. Follow up procedures conducted are unique to the given circumstance, and may include reviewing the potential conflict with the interested person, or investigating the matter in consultation with the interested person's supervisor and/or site management. In circumstances where the interested person is not a member of the board, or governing council, or committee thereof, or a person of interest, if it is determined that there is an actual conflict of interest, the supervisor of the individual is responsible for making an appropriate response, potentially including a restriction of the individual's job duties with respect to the matter giving rise to the conflict."

In this strategy, specific market comparisons are identified and the desired level of competitiveness in those markets specified. In addition, the linkage of executive pay to performance is articulated and how this relationship is to be maintained is outlined. To support and implement the compensation strategy, five basic elements are utilized. These elements are: - A solid, reliable and tested job evaluation methodology - Accurate, quality and relevant compensation survey information - A consistent annual process for updating the compensation levels - An active board review process that assures compliance with the compensation strategy and on-going review of the performance of the organization, and - Active, external review and auditing of compensation by external independent consultants.

The compensation committee ensures that executive total compensation is reflective of the organization's stated compensation philosophy. The committee, in this process, authorizes and supports an annual three step process utilizing Towers Watson's resources: 1) Salary levels, annual bonus targets/payments and long term incentive grants are compared rigorously each year with market data based on comparable positions and organizations. A. Comparable organizations are typically not-for-profit healthcare systems with similar operating revenues. Private sector employer data, when available, are also included in the analysis for ""transferable skills positions"". B. Historically, performance incentive payouts generally track with a normal bonus payout distribution. Incentive goals are primarily based on formally defined quantitative goals approved by the ad hoc Compensation Committee of the RSFH Board of Directors. 2) All recommended pay decisions are tested against these data and the organization's stated compensation philosophy. 3) A formal opinion letter is prepared by Towers Watson, representing that senior executives are compensated within the reasonableness standards mandated by the IRS. A similar process is performed by Towers Watson for the CEO and CFO positions. This letter provides a ""safe harbor"" for the organization's ""directors"" relative to the reasonableness of total executive compensation consistent with IRC Section 4958."

In 2013, we provided financial support along with free lab and imaging tests. In addition, several of our nurses and doctors volunteer their time at the clinic. Crisis Ministries We create moments of wellness and fellowship through our partnership with Crisis Ministries a place where people can receive a meal, a bed and access to a health clinic. Roper St. Francis sponsors an on-site nurse and makes regular donations of medical equipment, lab tests and medication. We are also supporting the creation of the new health clinic that will open in 2014. East Cooper Community Outreach Roper St. Francis' sponsorship dollars and support helps East Cooper Community Outreach provide case management services, medication assistance and healthcare. Our Lady of Mercy Community Outreach Center Welcoming a new baby into the world is one of life's greatest moments. Roper St. Francis proudly partners with Our Lady of Mercy Community Outreach Center to provide prenatal and wellness care to women in need. A Moment for Advocacy Medicaid Expansion A large part of our mission is providing care to the poor. The Affordable Care Act gives states the option to accept federal funding to expand Medicaid and provide healthcare coverage to many more people. We believe the acceptance of federal funding available for Medicaid expansion is the moral and right thing to do. Mission Days Lowcountry In August of 2013, hundreds of our teammates volunteered at a two day medical clinic for the uninsured. Organized by the South Carolina Hospital Association, and with all local hospitals working together, one thousand people were seen and given primary medical care. Those attending were also put in touch with Tricounty Access Health and other local agencies for follow-up and ongoing care. Community Health Needs Assessment Throughout 2013, Roper St. Francis completed a Needs Assessment for the Tricounty area, utilizing public health data, surveys and focus groups. The assessment identified strategic priorities for our system and an implementation plan was created to address those needs. The six highlighted areas within our scope of care and planning are: Access to Services and Coverage for the Uninsured and Underinsured Access to Mental Health Services Infant Mortality and Maternal and Child Health Prevention Wellness Outreach High Prevalence of Chronic Disease Coordination of Care Across Settings A Moment for Recovery The Roper Rehabilitation Hospital is a 52-bed unique hospital within Roper Hospital that is dedicated to rehabilitation and functional recovery. Our excellent team is committed to making every moment of our patients' recovery matter. For generations, Roper St. Francis has been trusted with the health of our community. We understand the importance of your health and that of those you love - it's at the center of everything we do. It's why every moment matters. Why every second saved in the ER is crucial, why every bedside minute gets our full attention, why every moment spent learning about wellness and prevention is time well-spent. We believe that smiles can change lives. We believe in the power of caring. We believe it is the muscle behind medicine and the reason for hope. We believe in the power of community, of reaching out, of extending care and generosity to those who need it most. We believe that every moment matters."

201403219349303590,221494442,"CORE FORM, PART III; STATEMENT OF PROGRAM SERVICE ACCOMPLISHMENTS","BACKGROUND ========== RARITAN BAY MEDICAL CENTER (""RBMC"") IS A GENERAL MEDICAL AND SURGICAL HOSPITAL. RBMC IS RECOGNIZED BY THE IRS AS AN INTERNAL REVENUE CODE SECTION 501(C)(3) TAX-EXEMPT ORGANIZATION. PURSUANT TO ITS CHARITABLE PURPOSES, RBMC PROVIDES MEDICALLY NECESSARY HEALTHCARE SERVICES TO ALL INDIVIDUALS IN A NON-DISCRIMINATORY MANNER REGARDLESS OF RACE, COLOR, CREED, SEX, NATIONAL ORIGIN RELIGION OR ABILITY TO PAY. MOREOVER, RBMC OPERATES CONSISTENTLY WITH THE FOLLOWING CRITERIA OUTLINED IN IRS REVENUE RULING 69-545: 1) RBMC PROVIDES MEDICALLY NECESSARY HEALTHCARE SERVICES TO ALL INDIVIDUALS REGARDLESS OF ABILITY TO PAY, INCLUDING CHARITY CARE, SELF-PAY, MEDICARE AND MEDICAID PATIENTS; 2) RBMC OPERATES AN ACTIVE EMERGENCY DEPARTMENT FOR ALL PERSONS; WHICH IS OPEN 24 HOURS A DAY, 7 DAYS A WEEK, 365 DAYS PER YEAR; 3) RBMC MAINTAINS AN OPEN MEDICAL STAFF, WITH PRIVILEGES AVAILABLE TO ALL QUALIFIED PHYSICIANS; 4) CONTROL OF RBMC RESTS WITH ITS BOARD OF DIRECTORS; WHICH IS COMPRISED OF INDEPENDENT CIVIC LEADERS AND OTHER PROMINENT MEMBERS OF THE COMMUNITY; AND 5) SURPLUS FUNDS ARE USED TO IMPROVE THE QUALITY OF PATIENT CARE, EXPAND AND RENOVATE FACILITIES AND ADVANCE MEDICAL CARE, PROGRAMS AND ACTIVITIES. HISTORY ======= PERTH AMBOY, THE FIRST INCORPORATED CITY IN NEW JERSEY (1718) WAS FERTILE SOIL FOR THE RAPID INDUSTRIALIZATION THAT MARKED THE 19TH CENTURY. WITH ITS HARBOR AND WATERWAYS, SHIPPING, FISHING AND FACTORIES BEGAN SPRINGING UP; AND, AS FACTORIES WERE BUILT, WORKERS WERE IN HIGH DEMAND. SINGLE MEN ENGAGED IN PERILOUS WORK IS A DANGEROUS COMBINATION. BECAUSE THERE WAS NO ONE TO CARE FOR THESE MEN AND INJURIES WERE ON THE RISE, INTERESTED CITIZENS AND CITY LEADERSHIP MET IN 1888 TO DISCUSS PLANS FOR BUILDING AN EMERGENCY HOSPITAL. FROM THIS MEETING EMERGED A TENTATIVE RESOLUTION TO SEEK FUNDS - FUNDS TO BUILD A 12-BED HOSPITAL WHICH, THOUGH PERHAPS UNIMAGINABLE AT THE TIME, WOULD LATER BECOME RBMC, A TWO-CAMPUS 501-BED HEALTHCARE FACILITY SERVING CENTRAL NEW JERSEY. AFTER FOURTEEN YEARS OF FALSE STARTS AND CAPITAL DEFICITS, PERTH AMBOY CITY HOSPITAL WAS DEDICATED ON MAY 2, 1902. YEARS OF TIRELESS FUNDRAISING AND PERSONAL SACRIFICE BY WOMEN'S GROUPS, LOCAL BENEFACTORS, ETHNIC GROUPS AND CIVIC ORGANIZATIONS BUILT AND FURNISHED WHAT WAS CONSIDERED A STATE-OF-THE-ART FACILITY AT THE TURN OF THE CENTURY. A SIX-MEMBER MEDICAL STAFF WAS APPOINTED AND A NURSE MATRON AND ASSISTANT WERE PUT IN CHARGE. FIVE WEEKS LATER PERTH AMBOY CITY HOSPITAL HAD TREATED ITS FIRST 12 PATIENTS. ONE YEAR LATER THE HOSPITAL HAD ITS OWN SCHOOL OF NURSING. BY 1913, THE BOARD OF GOVERNORS REALIZED THAT 12 BEDS COULD NO LONGER SUPPORT THE HEALTHCARE NEEDS OF THE CITY'S BURGEONING POPULATION. FROM THAT TIME UNTIL RIGHT BEFORE THE ONSLAUGHT OF THE GREAT DEPRESSION, PERTH AMBOY CITY HOSPITAL EXPERIENCED TREMENDOUS GROWTH. ADDITIONS MADE ROOM FOR MATERNITY SERVICES, AN ADVANCED LABORATORY AND X-RAY DEPARTMENT, ADDITIONAL OPERATING ROOM SPACE AND EXPANDED LIVING QUARTERS FOR THE NURSE RESIDENTS. DESPITE THE INCREASING NEED FOR ADDITIONAL TREATMENT SPACE, DECEMBER 7, 1941 HALTED PLANS FOR EXPANSION. IMMEDIATELY FOLLOWING THE WAR IN 1945, PERTH AMBOY CITY HOSPITAL TREATED ITS FIRST PATIENT USING A NEW WONDER DRUG, PENICILLIN, WHICH WAS BROUGHT TO THE HOSPITAL UNDER POLICE ESCORT. WAR-DELAYED ADDITIONS WERE THEN RAPIDLY UNDERTAKEN DURING THE NEXT 15 YEARS, SIGNIFICANTLY INCREASING BED CAPACITY AND THE SPACE NECESSARY TO OFFER ADVANCED TECHNIQUES THAT WERE ONCE ONLY AVAILABLE IN MAJOR MEDICAL CENTERS. BY THE 1960'S, THE STAGE WAS SET FOR THE HOSPITAL TO ENTER INTO AN ERA OF ""FIRSTS,"" WHERE INNOVATION WAS FUELED BY CONTINUING RENOVATION AND EXPANSION. IN 1964, SURGEONS PERFORMED ONE OF THE FIRST SUCCESSFUL PACEMAKER IMPLANTS. BY 1968, SCIENTISTS IN THE HOSPITAL'S INSTITUTE OF LABORATORY MEDICINE HAD LINKED A SMALL REFRIGERATOR SIZED COMPUTER TO A SET OF AUTOMATIC ANALYZING MACHINES AND CAME UP WITH A COMPLETELY NEW KIND OF HOSPITAL SERVICE...COMPUTERIZED AUTOMATION. DURING THE 1970'S THE HOSPITAL FOUND ITSELF AT THE FOREFRONT OF CARDIAC MEDICINE, RECORDING NEW JERSEY'S FIRST SUCCESSFUL IMPLANT OF THE RECHARGEABLE PACEMAKER IN 1974 AND USING ONE OF THE VERY FIRST CAT SCANNERS IN MIDDLESEX COUNTY IN 1979. PATIENTS AND PHYSICIANS INCREASINGLY GAINED EXCLUSIVE ACCESS TO WORLD-CLASS HEALTHCARE RIGHT IN THEIR OWN BACKYARD. BY 1976, A NEW BUILDING PROGRAM WAS IN THE WORKS. EXTENSIVE CONSTRUCTION PLANS WERE CREATED FOR PERTH AMBOY, BUT THE MOST AMBITIOUS PART OF THE PROGRAM WAS THE BUILDING OF AN 80-BED AFFILIATE HOSPITAL ON A 41-ACRE LOT IN OLD BRIDGE TOWNSHIP. OLD BRIDGE REGIONAL HOSPITAL WAS COMPLETED IN JUST LESS THAN TWO YEARS, OPENING ITS DOORS ON JANUARY 2, 1979. THROUGH ITS AFFILIATION WITH ITS PERTH AMBOY SISTER FACILITY, FOR THE FIRST TIME RESIDENTS SOUTH OF THE RARITAN RIVER COULD TAKE ADVANTAGE OF ALL OF THE ADVANCED MEDICAL SERVICES AND TECHNIQUES USUALLY RESERVED FOR HOSPITALS IN URBAN CENTERS. RBMC HEALTH SERVICES CORPORATION, THE NEW NAME FOR THE COMBINED HOSPITALS IN OLD BRIDGE AND PERTH AMBOY (LATER CHANGED SIMPLY TO RBMC), SAW ADVANCEMENTS IN SURGERY AND NON-SURGICAL THERAPIES, DIAGNOSTIC TESTING, EDUCATION AND CONTINUED PHYSICAL EXPANSION THROUGHOUT THE 1980'S. IN FACT, OLD BRIDGE REGIONAL HOSPITAL BECAME THE HOME TO THE FIRST LASER KNEE SURGERY PERFORMED IN NEW JERSEY IN 1988. THE CONSTRUCTION OF THE OLD BRIDGE MEDICAL ARTS BUILDING THEN BROUGHT A NEW LEVEL OF CONVENIENCE TO PHYSICIANS AND PATIENTS, FURTHER UPHOLDING RBMC'S PLEDGE TO PROVIDE THE HIGHEST QUALITY HEALTHCARE TO ITS MIDDLESEX COUNTY FAMILY. NEVER RESTING ON ITS LAURELS, IN 1990 THE HOSPITAL SUBMITTED A CERTIFICATE OF NEED TO THE STATE OF NEW JERSEY DETAILING ITS PLANS FOR EXPANSION. SIGNIFICANTLY NAMED, ""RENEWAL 2000,"" THE REQUEST OUTLINED AN AGGRESSIVE $53.6 MILLION RECONSTRUCTION PLAN THAT WOULD AFFECT MOST KEY SERVICE AREAS IN PERTH AMBOY, INCLUDING BUILDING A NEW OUTPATIENT CENTER AND ADDING A PATIENT FLOOR TO THE OLD BRIDGE CAMPUS. WHILE EXTENSIVE RECONSTRUCTION CHANGED THE FACE OF BOTH HOSPITALS, PATIENT CARE PROGRESSED AT OPTIMUM LEVELS. PARTICIPATION IN ADVANCED CLINICAL TRIALS INCREASED AND AFFILIATIONS WERE DEVELOPED WITH ROBERT WOOD JOHNSON UNIVERSITY HOSPITAL, THE CANCER INSTITUTE OF NEW JERSEY, THE EASTERN COOPERATIVE ONCOLOGY GROUP AND THE ROBERT WOOD JOHNSON HEALTH NETWORK. INCREASED SPECIALIZED SERVICES SUCH AS THE MARION TANZMAN DIABETES CENTER, THE JACQUELINE M. AND ROBERT M. WILENTZ CANCER CENTER, THE CARDIAC CATHETERIZATION LABORATORY, THE BIRTHING CENTER AND CENTER FOR WOMEN WERE BUT A FEW OF THE MANY EXCITING HAPPENINGS TO ADD TO RBMC'S GROWING LIST OF ACCOMPLISHMENTS. AFTER RENEWAL 2000 WAS COMPLETED IN 1997, POST-CONSTRUCTION RELAXATION WAS SHORT-LIVED AS THE HOSPITAL UNVEILED ITS NEW PLANS FOR IMPROVING EMERGENCY CARE, CALLED ""PROJECT ER."" SO AS NOT TO SACRIFICE PATIENT CARE, PROJECT ER WAS DESIGNED AS A MULTIPHASE CONSTRUCTION, RENOVATION AND REVITALIZATION OF EMERGENCY DEPARTMENT SERVICES AT BOTH HOSPITALS. 2001 SAW THE FINAL STAGES OF RENOVATIONS PROGRESSING IN PERTH AMBOY, AND THE SUCCESSFUL COMPLETION OF THE OLD BRIDGE DIVISION EXPANSION. AND, ALTHOUGH IT SHOULD BE NO SURPRISE, WITH PROJECT ER FINISHED, PLANS FOR FUTURE EXPANSION ARE ON THE DRAWING BOARD. LOOKING BACK OVER THE MORE THAN 100 YEARS THAT RBMC HAS BEEN BRINGING THE LATEST ADVANCEMENTS IN HEALTHCARE TO CENTRAL NEW JERSEY IN A SUPPORTIVE AND CARING ATMOSPHERE, IT IS NO WONDER, IN 2001, READERS OF THE HOME NEWS TRIBUNE VOTED US THE ""BEST HOSPITAL IN CENTRAL NEW JERSEY.

The compensation policy described below pertains to The Moody Bible Institute as the controlling entity.Several years prior, consultants were used to establish benchmarks for officer salary levels. Since 2009 Moody has annually reviewed the 990 salary information of comparable institutions to set benchmarks for this purpose. Information is accessed for the following positions: President, COO, CFO, Chief Educational Officer and Chief Development Officer. We typically look at 7-10 higher education institutions, some of which are competitors to Moody. We choose institutions of comparable mission and size (based upon total expenses). We look at 3-4 parachurch organizations (of generally comparable size) as well. This data is used as a salary administration benchmark. To increase its applicability, the data is adjusted for cost of living differences (based upon the location of the other institutions) in relation to the cost of living in the greater Chicago area.Following this analysis, which is provided for review by the Compensation Committee of the Board in the spring of each calendar year, the President's salary increase recommendations are based upon Institute salary guidelines for the fiscal year(which reflect trends in national average salary increases) and upon job performance. The Compensation Committee can either approve or disapprove the President's recommendations. Increases for officers and other key employees are scheduled for October of each year, so that the financial condition and performance of the institution at the close of the prior fiscal year can be taken into account.The President's salary increase is scheduled at the same time and is set by the Board (in the context of the data provided and the current fiscal year salary guidelines for the Institute)."

THE EXECUTIVE COMPENSATION COMMITTEE WILL ANNUALLY REVIEW THE PRESIDENT AND CEO'S PERFORMANCE BASED UPON OBJECTIVE CRITERIA AND SUBJECTIVE CRITERIA IN AWARDING ANY ANNUAL INCENTIVE. THE COMMITTEE WILL CONSIDER VARIOUS FACTORS INCLUDING, BUT NOT LIMITED TO MEETING PREVIOUSLY APPROVED ANNUAL GOALS, THE OVERALL FINANCIAL PERFORMANCE OF THE MEDICAL CENTER, PATIENT SATISFACTION, QUALITY CARE INDICATORS, BOTH PUBLISHED AND NON-PUBLISHED, AND RESPONSE TO ANY OTHER UNUSUAL OR EXTRAORDINARY CIRCUMSTANCES OCCURRING DURING THE YEAR.

IN ADDITION, THE POOL OF MONEY AVAILABLE FOR THE INCENTIVE IS ALSO CONTINGENT AND CONDITIONAL ON THE FINANCIAL PERFORMANCE OF THE MEDICAL CENTER. 6. THE EXECUTIVE COMPENSATION COMMITTEE MAY ALSO ESTABLISH AN ANNUAL INCENTIVE COMPENSATION POOL FOR THE VICE PRESIDENTS. WHEN THIS OCCURS, IT IS EXPECTED THAT THE CEO WILL INCLUDE A TEAM COMPONENT, AS WELL AS AN INDIVIDUAL COMPONENT, TO BE CONSIDERED WHEN DISTRIBUTING THIS POOL TO THE SENIOR LEADERSHIP TEAM. 7. THE COMPENSATION COMMITTEE SHALL ALSO REVIEW THE CEO'S PARTICIPATION AND LEADERSHIP IN COMMUNITY AND PROFESSIONAL ORGANIZATIONS ON WHICH THE EXECUTIVE SERVES.

SEMC RECOGNIZES ITS RESPONSIBILITY TO ENSURE THAT ITS EXECUTIVE COMPENSATION PROGRAM IS APPROPRIATE IN VIEW OF ITS STATUS AS A NON-FOR-PROFIT COMMUNITY HOSPITAL AND IN ACCORDANCE WITH ITS TAX-EXEMPT STATUS, AND THAT ITS COMPENSATION AND BENEFITS ARE REASONABLE AND NOT EXCESSIVE. TO THAT END, SEMC AND THE COMMITTEE WILL REVIEW AND APPROVE ALL FORMS OF EXECUTIVE COMPENSATION AND BENEFITS IN A MANNER NECESSARY TO QUALIFY FOR THE ""REBUTTABLE PRESUMPTION OF REASONABLENESS"" UNDER THE INTERMEDIATE SANCTION RULES OF SECTION 4958 OF THE INTERNAL REVENUE CODE. 9.

The Compensation Committees' operating procedures are designed to ensure that the compensation of all such officers and key employees is reasonable (i.e. the value of services is the amount that would ordinarily be paid for like services by like enterprises under like circumstances), and to follow the specific steps outlined in the IRC regulations for establishing the rebuttable presumption of reasonableness that a transaction is not an excess benefit transaction. The Compensation Committee consists exclusively of independent trustees without any conflict of interest (as defined in the applicable IRC regulations) with regard to the compensation arrangements being reviewed or approved. The absence of any conflict of interest with respect to items on that meeting's agenda is confirmed at the beginning of each meeting of the Compensation Committee. The Compensation Committee selects and engages an independent, qualified compensation consultant which performs such valuations on a regular basis to provide appropriate comparability data. Comparability data includes, but is not limited to, compensation levels paid by similarly situated organizations, both taxable and tax-exempt, for functionally comparable positions; the availability of similar services in Mount Sinai's geographic area; current compensation surveys compiled by independent firms; customized surveys in specific circumstances, and actual written offers from similar institutions competing for the services of the disqualified person. The sources of the comparability data used by the compensation consultant are provided to the Compensation Committee. The Compensation Committee receives and reviews the comparability data and any analysis provided by the consultant, as well as information provided by management or, in the case of the CEO, by the Chairman of the Board of Trustees, including information about the CEO's performance. For the CEO, the Committee then determines an appropriate level of total compensation in relation to the comparability data. For the other executives and key employees, the Committee also reviews the position description, the credentials of the incumbent or the candidate for the position, an incumbent's performance appraisal, and the CEO's (or Chairman of the Board's, with respect to the CEO) recommendation, in relation to the comparability data, and decides whether to approve the recommended compensation or to modify it. The Compensation Committee discusses and votes on the compensation arrangements for the CEO, CFO and other senior executive staff members in executive session. The Compensation Committee contemporaneously documents in written minutes the terms of the transaction that was approved and the date it was approved; the members of the Compensation Committee who were present during debate on the transaction that was approved and those who voted on it; the comparability data and information from management obtained and relied on, and how the comparability data was obtained; and the Compensation Committee's basis for the decisions, if the approved compensation is outside the range of comparability data. These minutes are prepared before the later of the next meeting of the Compensation Committee or 60 days after the final actions of the Compensation Committee are taken with respect to the compensation decisions made. The minutes are reviewed and approved by the Compensation Committee within a reasonable time thereafter."

THE GOVERNING BOARD IS VESTED WITH THE ULTIMATE RESPONSIBILITY AND AUTHORITY FOR THE SUCCESSFUL FULFILLMENT OF THIS MISSION. THE GOVERNING BOARD OF REID HOSPITAL EXERCISES A FIDUCIARY RESPONSIBILITY ON BEHALF OF THE SERVICE AREA AND PEOPLE WE SERVE. WHILE REID HOSPITAL IS A PRIVATE, NON-PROFIT ORGANIZATION, THE BOARD IS COMMITTED TO A CONCEPT OF GOVERNANCE THAT SEES ITSELF AS HAVING A PUBLIC MISSION AND OUTLOOK. REID HOSPITAL'S GOVERNING BOARD MAINTAINS AN ONGOING COMMITMENT TO QUALITY AND EXCELLENCE. IT IS THE BELIEF OF THE BOARD THAT THE PEOPLE WE SERVE DESERVE NOTHING LESS. TO COMMIT TO A LESSER STANDARD OR TO BE ACCEPTING OF LESSER PERFORMANCE WOULD BE AN ULTIMATE BREACH OF OUR REASON FOR EXISTENCE. THE COMMITMENT TO QUALITY AND EXCELLENCE STEMS FROM A REALIZATION OF THE STEWARDSHIP INVOLVED IN GOVERNING AND PRESERVING A VITAL HEALTH CARE RESOURCE FOR THE PEOPLE OF A SIX-COUNTY AREA IN EAST CENTRAL INDIANA AND WESTERN OHIO. THIS STEWARDSHIP AND SENSE OF RESPONSIBILITY EXTENDS TO A REALIZATION THAT REID HOSPITAL IS THE LARGEST EMPLOYER IN WAYNE COUNTY. THIS BOARD'S ULTIMATE AUTHORITY AND RESPONSIBILITY INCLUDES ALL ASPECTS OF THE OPERATION: QUALITY OF SERVICES RENDERED, QUALITY OF ITS MEDICAL STAFF, QUALITY OF ITS LEADERSHIP AND OTHER FINANCIAL, LEGAL, ETHICAL, AND OPERATIONAL CONSIDERATIONS. AS A SERVICE TEAM PROVIDING HUMAN SERVICES, REID HOSPITAL'S PEOPLE (GOVERNING AND FOUNDATION BOARDS, MEDICAL STAFF, EMPLOYEES AND VOLUNTEERS) REPRESENT THE SINGLE MOST IMPORTANT ASSET POSSESSED BY THE ORGANIZATION. MORE THAN ANY OTHER FACTOR (BUILDINGS, EQUIPMENT, TECHNOLOGY, ETC.), THE QUALITY OF REID HOSPITAL'S HUMAN RESOURCES DETERMINES THE QUALITY OF SERVICES ULTIMATELY PROVIDED TO ITS PATIENTS AND FAMILIES. THIS COMMITMENT TO QUALITY AND THE STEWARDSHIP OF HUMAN RESOURCES SERVICES ARE THE FOUNDATION FOR REID HOSPITAL'S EMPLOYEE RELATIONS POSTURE. THIS APPLIES TO ALL ASPECTS OF EMPLOYEE RELATIONS AT ALL LEVELS. A COMPENSATION PHILOSOPHY THAT ATTRACTS AND RETAINS QUALIFIED, HIGH QUALITY AND COMMITTED EMPLOYEES AT ALL LEVELS IS IN THE BEST INTEREST OF REID HOSPITAL AND THOSE WE SERVE. THE CHIEF EXECUTIVE OFFICER (PRESIDENT AND CEO), SELECTED AND APPOINTED BY THE GOVERNING BOARD, IS CHARGED WITH THE RESPONSIBILITY OF DEVELOPING AND ADMINISTERING A COMPENSATION PLAN THAT REFLECTS THE PREVIOUSLY STATED PHILOSOPHY AND MISSION. THE CEO IS ACCOUNTABLE TO THE GOVERNING BOARD IN THIS REGARD, JUST AS HE/SHE IS ACCOUNTABLE IN ALL OTHER AREAS. THE FOLLOWING PHILOSOPHY AND GUIDELINES AFFIRM THE BOARD'S COMMITMENT IN REFERENCE TO DEVELOPING A REASONABLE AND APPROPRIATE COMPENSATION PACKAGE FOR THE CEO AND EXECUTIVE STAFF. EXECUTIVE COMPENSATION PHILOSOPHY, GUIDELINES, AND PRACTICES: AN EFFECTIVE EXECUTIVE COMPENSATION PROGRAM ADDRESSES A NUMBER OF GOALS. THESE GOALS INCLUDE: 1.) THE ABILITY TO ATTRACT AN INDIVIDUAL WHO IS HIGHLY QUALIFIED BY REASON OF PROFESSIONAL EDUCATION, PAST EXPERIENCE, AND PERSONAL CHARACTERISTICS; 2.) APPROPRIATE RECOGNITION OF PERFORMANCE (POSITIVE OR NEGATIVE); 3.) MAINTENANCE OF MOTIVATION FOR FURTHER PERFORMANCE AT A LEVEL OF EXCELLENCE; 4.) RETENTION (WHEN DESIRED) OF LEADERSHIP EXPERTISE; AND 5.) FAIRNESS. IT IS IMPORTANT TO NOTE THAT THE ISSUE OF FAIRNESS RELATES TO THE COMMUNITY, THE ORGANIZATION AND TO THE INDIVIDUAL. THAT IS, THE GOAL OF THE BOARD WILL NOT BE TO MINIMIZE COST PER SE. CONVERSELY, THE EXPECTATIONS OF THE CEO SHOULD NOT BE TO MAXIMIZE INCOME AS A SINGLE OBJECTIVE. THE GOAL OF BOTH PARTIES WILL BE TO ACHIEVE A COMPENSATION PACKAGE THAT IS FAIR TO THE COMMUNITY, FAIR TO THE ORGANIZATION, AND FAIR TO THE INDIVIDUAL. THE EXECUTIVE COMMITTEE OF THE GOVERNING BOARD IS THE DESIGNATED COMPENSATION COMMITTEE AND HAS THE RESPONSIBILITY TO SET AND APPROVE CHANGES IN THE CEO'S COMPENSATION PACKAGE. THE COMPENSATION PACKAGE IS REVIEWED ANNUALLY AND ADJUSTED (IF WARRANTED) BASED ON REVIEW, ASSESSMENT AND EVALUATION OF ALL OF THE FOLLOWING FACTORS: 1.) AN ANNUAL PERFORMANCE REVIEW, CONDUCTED BY THE EXECUTIVE COMMITTEE WITH INPUT INVITED FROM THE FULL GOVERNING BOARD PRIOR TO THE REVIEW, WHICH IS SUMMARIZED IN WRITTEN FORM AND SHARED WITH THE ENTIRE BOARD VIA MINUTES OF THE EXECUTIVE COMMITTEE; 2.) THE GENERAL INCREASE (EXCLUDING MERIT) APPROVED BY THE GENERAL BOARD FOR HOURLY EMPLOYEES; 3.) COMPARISON OF COMPENSATION LEVELS AT HOSPITALS OF SIMILAR SIZE AND COMPLEXITY (USING TOTAL REVENUE, NUMBER OF EMPLOYEES AND/OR BED SIZE AS THE BASIS FOR SIMILARITY WHENEVER POSSIBLE), WITH THE GENERAL GOAL OF REMAINING WITHIN THE UPPER PORTION OF THE THIRD QUARTILE (50TH TO 75TH PERCENTILE) OF THESE HOSPITALS, ALTHOUGH OCCASIONAL VARIATIONS ABOVE AND BELOW THIS RANGE WILL OCCUR; AND 4.) COMPARISON, IF AVAILABLE, OF THE MOST RELEVANT PERCENTAGE INCREASES AT OTHER HOSPITALS OF SIMILAR SIZE AND COMPLEXITY (AS DEFINED ABOVE). THE COMPARISON MENTIONED IN ITEMS #3 AND #4 SHALL UTILIZE DATA OBTAINED FROM COMPENSATION SURVEYS SEEN AS LEGITIMATE, STATISTICALLY VALID, AND GENERALLY ACCEPTED. THE SPECIFIC COMPARATIVE SURVEYS USED IN ANY GIVEN YEAR WILL BE OUTLINED IN THE COMMITTEE MINUTES OR EXHIBITS. EXAMPLES OF THIS TYPE OF BONA FIDE SURVEY INCLUDE: 1.) THE ANNUAL INDIANA HOSPITAL & HEALTH ASSOCIATION SURVEY; 2.) WILLIAM MERCER, INC. HEALTH NETWORK SURVEY; 3.) SULLIVAN COTTER & ASSOCIATES SURVEY; 4.) THE ANNUAL MANAGEMENT SCIENCE ASSOCIATION SURVEY; 5.) CLARK CONSULTING; AND 6.) WATSON WYATT. AFTER REVIEW AND EVALUATION OF THE FOUR FACTORS MENTIONED ABOVE, THE EXECUTIVE COMMITTEE SHALL ENACT WHATEVER ADJUSTMENTS ARE DEEMED APPROPRIATE. THESE DISCUSSIONS, CONCLUSIONS, AND ACTIONS WILL BE FULLY DOCUMENTED IN THE MINUTES OF THE EXECUTIVE COMMITTEE. ALSO DOCUMENTED, WILL BE A RECORD OF THOSE PRESENT FOR THE EVALUATION REVIEW DISCUSSION, AS WELL AS THOSE PRESENT FOR RESULTING COMMITTEE ACTIONS RELATING TO COMPENSATION. THROUGH THE PROCEDURES DESCRIBED ABOVE, REID HOSPITAL ENSURES THAT COMPENSATION FOR ITS CEO AND OTHER EXECUTIVE STAFF IS APPROVED IN ADVANCE BY AN AUTHORIZED BODY ENTIRELY COMPOSED OF INDIVIDUALS WITHOUT A CONFLICT OF INTEREST, THAT THIS AUTHORIZED BODY OBTAINS AND RELIES UPON APPROPRIATE DATA AS TO COMPARABILITY, AND THAT THE AUTHORIZED BODY ADEQUATELY AND TIMELY DOCUMENTS THE BASIS FOR ITS DETERMINATION. BY THUS TAKING THE STEPS NECESSARY FOR THESE COMPENSATION DECISIONS TO QUALIFY FOR THE REBUTTABLE PRESUMPTION OF REASONABLENESS, REID HOSPITAL ENDEAVORS TO SATISFY THE STANDARDS ADVOCATED BY THE INTERNAL REVENUE SERVICE FOR APPROVING EXECUTIVE COMPENSATION."

Total rewards at The Colorado Health Foundation (the Foundation) consist of base pay, performance-based bonus opportunity, benefits and other tangible rewards. The rewards program is focused on total rewards and is market-competitive. The Foundation's comparative universe is defined as U.S.-based for-profit and not-for-profit (including healthcare and foundations) organizations of comparable size and complexity. For executives, the competitive universe also includes similarly-sized health and welfare related foundations. The Foundation uses surveys produced by well-established human resources and/or compensation consulting firms, as well as custom surveys when necessary. The Mountain States Employers Council (MSEC) Front Range survey is the primary local survey. Towers Watson Data Services and Mercer are the primary national for-profit and not-for-profit survey used for non-management positions. A custom survey of foundation executive compensation was conducted by a consulting firm for the Foundation. Economic Research Institute data are used when considering Front Range cost of labor adjustments for positions at the manager level and below. This market information is updated at least bi-annually. The Foundation targets median salaries to balance the Foundation's willingness to pay above the market for top talent with the fact that the Foundation is a mission-driven organization with fewer organizational risks than other organizations. The size of the range is generally determined by the conditions in the market and is set to allow employees to be paid 10-15% below or above the median, based on experience and demonstrated performance over time. The Foundation believes that performance-based compensation is an important element in total rewards. Payouts pursuant to the Foundation's annual performance bonus program are based on organization-level performance against specific objectives (defined in annual Work Plan) and individual performance against personal objectives that support the Foundation's external and internal outcome areas. Bonus funding is at the discretion of the Board, based on input from management. Based on competitive market data, the guideline for executive bonuses (including the CEO) is 10% of salary. Actual amounts may be more or less than this amount based on performance. Annually, an independent committee of the Board of Directors (the Compensation Committee) reviews competitive market data, approves salary and bonuses for executives reporting to the CEO, and recommends CEO salary and bonus to the Board. The Board approves CEO salary and bonus with consideration of the annual CEO performance evaluation."

THIS ADVANCED TECHNOLOGY CREATES 3D BREAST RECONSTRUCTIONS SO RADIOLOGISTS CAN VIEW BREASTS IN THIN LAYERS AND SEE EARLY CANCERS THAT WOULD NOT BE VISIBLE USING OTHER MAMMOGRAPHY. IN 2012, SENTARA WILLIAMSBURG REGIONAL MEDICAL CENTER STARTED A NEW TREATMENT FOR SEVERE ASTHMA CALLED BRONCHIAL THERMOPLASTY. THIS MINIMALLY INVASIVE OUTPATIENT PROCEDURE USES A BRONCHOSCOPE TO DELIVER THERMAL ENERGY TO THE LUNGS OF PATIENTS WITH ASTHMA TO DECREASE THE AMOUNT OF SMOOTH MUSCLE IN THE LUNGS THE MUSCLES THAT CONSTRICT AND RESULT IN ASTHMA SYMPTOMS. THAT SAME YEAR, THE SENTARA CANCER NETWORK'S MOBILE PET/CT BEGAN PERFORMING BODY SCANS TO DISCOVER AND STAGE CANCERS THAT MAY HAVE SPREAD TO THE BONES. THIS IS POSSIBLE DUE TO THE FDA'S APPROVAL OF THE USE OF 18F-SODIUM FLUORIDE AS AN INJECTION. AT ROCKINGHAM MEMORIAL HOSPITAL IN 2012, PATIENTS WITH THE HEART CONDITION ATRIAL FIBRILLATION BENEFITTED FROM A PROCEDURE CALLED CARDIAC CRYOABLATION, APPROVED BY THE FDA IN LATE 2010. CRYOABLATION EMPLOYS A SPECIAL BALLOON THAT'S FILLED WITH A COOLANT TO REDUCE ITS TEMPERATURE TO MINUS 80 DEGREES CELSIUS. THE BALLOON IS APPLIED TO THE HEART TISSUES THAT CAUSE IRREGULAR HEARTBEATS, AND THE COLD TEMPERATURES DESTROY THE TISSUE AND CORRECT THE HEART'S PROBLEM. IT HAS PROVED SUCCESSFUL FOR PATIENTS WHO DID NOT RESPOND FULLY TO OTHER TREATMENTS. WITH A $725,000 GRANT FROM THE POTOMAC HEALTH FOUNDATION, SENTARA NORTHERN VIRGINIA MEDICAL CENTER PURCHASED A NEW DIGITAL MAMMOGRAPHY VAN. WITH THE VAN, THE CENTER REACHES WOMEN WITH LITTLE OR NO INSURANCE, IN HOPES OF DETECTING CANCER EARLIER IN WOMEN IN PRINCE WILLIAM COUNTY, WHERE THERE'S A HIGHER-THAN-AVERAGE DEATH RATE FROM BREAST CANCER. ON SEPTEMBER 17, 2012, SURGEONS AND CARDIOLOGISTS AT SENTARA HEART HOSPITAL WERE THE FIRST IN THE WORLD TO BEGIN PERFORMING SURGERIES IN THE DUAL EPICARDIAL ENDOCARDIAL PERSISTENT (DEEP) ATRIAL FIBRILLATION FEASIBILITY TRIAL. THIS FOOD AND DRUG ADMINISTRATION-APPROVED STUDY IS SPONSORED BY CARDIAC DEVICE MANUFACTURER ATRICURE, INC. AND IS DESIGNED TO EVALUATE THE SAFETY AND EFFICACY OF A COMBINED PROCEDURE WHEREBY THE SURGEON CREATES LINES OF BLOCK ON THE OUTSIDE OF THE HEART WORKING THROUGH TINY CHEST INCISIONS. B. EXPANDING SERVICE AREAS AND PARTNERSHIPS IN 2013, WE LAUNCHED AN EFFORT TO BETTER SERVE THE SENIOR POPULATION IN HAMPTON ROADS THROUGH A MEDICARE ADVANTAGE PRODUCT FROM OPTIMA HEALTH, SENTARA HEALTHCARE'S AWARD-WINNING HEALTH PLAN, ONE SPECIALIZED SENTARA MEDICAL GROUP (SMG) PRACTICE AND A NEW COLLABORATION WITH SMG, EASTERN VIRGINIA MEDICAL SCHOOL, OPTIMA HEALTH, SENTARA HOME CARE AND LIFE CARE AND SENTARA HOSPITALS TO CREATE A SEAMLESS EXPERIENCE FOR PATIENTS ACROSS THE CONTINUUM OF CARE."
201423149349300867,540506331,"FORM 990, PART III, LINE 4A","IN AUGUST 2012, SENTARA AND MDLIVE ANNOUNCED AN EQUITY PARTNERSHIP TO DELIVER REAL-TIME MEDICAL CONSULTATIONS VIA TELEPHONE AND ONLINE VIDEO THROUGH AN ESTABLISHED NETWORK OF PHYSICIANS. PATIENTS USE THE MDLIVE VIRTUAL CONSULT PLATFORM TO CONSULT DIRECTLY WITH A LICENSED SENTARA OR PARTNER PHYSICIAN WHO CAN DIAGNOSE LOW-ACUITY ILLNESSES, PROVIDE CARE, AND SUBSCRIBE PRESCRIPTIONS. IN 2013, SENTARA EMPLOYEES WITH OPTIMA HEALTH AND CIGNA INSURANCE RECEIVED THE BENEFIT OF SENTARA MDLIVE APPOINTMENTS FOR A $15 CO-PAY. WE SAW OVER 2,000 SENTARA EMPLOYEES/DEPENDENTS COVERED UNDER OPTIMA INSURANCE REGISTER WITH MDLIVE. THAT SAME YEAR, 429 EMPLOYEES AND THEIR FAMILIES MADE AN APPOINTMENT WITH MDLIVE. SENTARA IS WORKING WITH MDLIVE TO PARTNER WITH OTHER HEALTH SYSTEMS TO OFFER THE BENEFITS TO THEIR EMPLOYEES AND IS WORKING TO LEVERAGE THE TECHNOLOGY TO PILOT NEW MODELS TO TRANSFORM CARE AND IMPROVE LIVES. C. EXPANDING EDUCATIONAL SERVICES CONTINUING TO GROW AND DEVELOP AS WE AIM TO MEET THE DEMAND FOR WELL-EDUCATED HEALTHCARE EXPERTS, THE SENTARA SCHOOL OF HEALTH PROFESSIONALS CHANGED ITS NAME IN 2009 TO THE SENTARA COLLEGE OF HEALTH SCIENCES (SCHS). AT THE SAME TIME, IT RECEIVED APPROVAL TO OFFER A BACCALAUREATE DEGREE IN NURSING, A REQUIREMENT MORE HOSPITALS ARE SETTING FOR ITS STAFF. OUR BACHELOR OF SCIENCE IN NURSING PROGRAM BEGAN IN AUGUST 2010 WITH FOUR WAYS TO RECEIVE A DEGREE: TRADITIONAL BSN, LPN TO BSN, RN TO BSN AND EARLY ADMISSION FOR HIGH SCHOOL SENIORS. THE COLLEGE IS PROVIDING A NEW POOL OF HIGHLY COMPETENT NURSES: THE FIRST RN TO BSN CLASS GRADUATED IN MAY 2012 WITH SEVEN GRADUATES. TWENTY-SIX STUDENTS ALSO GRADUATED IN THE NEW, TRADITIONAL BSN PROGRAM, AND ONE STUDENT GRADUATED IN THE NEW LPN TO BSN PROGRAM. ALL STUDENTS PRACTICE THEIR SKILLS IN SENTARA'S SIMULATION LAB A MINIMUM OF EIGHT TIMES, ENABLING THEM TO PERFECT THEIR CRITICAL-THINKING SKILLS IN A SAFE ENVIRONMENT. THE LAB, EQUIPPED WITH SIX, HIGH-FIDELITY PROGRAMMABLE MANNEQUINS WHO CAN CRY, SWEAT, BREATHE RAPIDLY AND DEVELOP SYMPTOMS OF CARDIAC ARREST, IS LOCATED INSIDE SCHS -- A FEATURE NOT FOUND IN MANY NURSING PROGRAMS -- SO THAT IT IS EASILY ACCESSIBLE FOR BOTH STUDENTS AND PROFESSORS, AND CLASSROOM INSTRUCTION OR FEEDBACK CAN OCCUR IMMEDIATELY AFTERWARDS. WE FURTHERED OUR OFFERINGS WITH THE SURGICAL TECHNOLOGY PROGRAM AT THE COLLEGE LAUNCHING THE FIRST ASSOCIATE OF OCCUPATIONAL SCIENCE DEGREE WITH THE JANUARY 2013 CLASS. D. RESEARCHING FOR THE FUTURE IN A PATIENT STUDY CONDUCTED AT SENTARA LEIGH HOSPITAL IN 2012, NURSES WERE EMPOWERED TO GIVE IV FLUIDS AT THE EARLIEST SIGNS THAT A KNEE OR HIP JOINT REPLACEMENT PATIENT'S BLOOD PRESSURE WAS TRENDING DOWNWARD. BEFORE THE STUDY, A 10-STEP PROCESS INCLUDING A PHYSICIAN ORDER WAS REQUIRED. THIS NEW PROTOCOL SPED CARE AND REDUCED THE NUMBER OF PATIENTS WHOSE CONDITIONS WORSENED DUE TO LOW BLOOD PRESSURE BY 30 PERCENT. STUDY FINDINGS WERE SHARED WITH ORTHOPEDIC NURSES FROM AROUND THE UNITED STATES DURING THE 33RD ANNUAL NATIONAL ASSOCIATION OF ORTHOPAEDIC NURSES CONFERENCE IN SAN ANTONIO IN MAY 2013. IN APRIL 2012, SENTARA HEART HOSPITAL JOINED THE HEARTLIGHT TRIAL FOR THE TREATMENT OF SYMPTOMATIC ATRIAL FIBRILLATION. USING A FIBER OPTIC LIGHT, DOCTORS LOOK INSIDE THE BEATING HEART OF PATIENTS, TESTING A NEW DEVICE CALLED THE CARDIOFOCUS HEARTLIGHT ENDOSCOPIC ABLATION SYSTEM. THE SYSTEM INCLUDES A BALLOON, SMALL CAMERA AND LASER LIGHT TO PRECISELY DELIVER LIGHT ENERGY TO MISFIRING AREAS OF THE HEART AND TO HELP RESTORE REGULAR HEART RHYTHM. THE STUDY REACHED A MILESTONE IN FEBRUARY 2013 WHEN IT ENROLLED MORE THAN HALF OF THE TOTAL STUDY PARTICIPANTS. IN A 10-MONTH, 2012 STUDY, SENTARA PHYSICIANS WORKED WITH THE EASTERN VIRGINIA MEDICAL SCHOOL STRELITZ DIABETES CENTER TO DEVELOP ALERTS IN THE SENTARA ECARE HEALTH NETWORK, OUR ELECTRONIC MEDICAL RECORD SYSTEM, WHEN A CHANGE OCCURS IN A DIABETIC PATIENT'S CONDITION. THE ALERTS OFFER GUIDANCE ABOUT THE APPROPRIATE CARE FOR EACH SITUATION. DURING THE STUDY PERIOD, PATIENTS SHOWED SUBSTANTIAL IMPROVEMENT. NEARLY 900 PATIENTS MOVED FROM THE HIGHEST LEVEL OF RISK FOR COMPLICATIONS TO A HEALTHIER RANGE. THE RESULTS WERE PRESENTED MAY 2, 2013 IN PHOENIX AT THE 22ND ANNUAL SCIENTIFIC AND CLINICAL CONGRESS OF THE AMERICAN ASSOCIATION OF CLINICAL ENDOCRINOLOGIST (AACE). SENTARA PARTNERED WITH CUPRON AND EOS SURFACES IN 2013 TO LAUNCH THE WORLD'S LARGEST CLINICAL TRIAL TO TEST THE EFFECTIVENESS OF COPPER-INFUSED HARD SURFACES AND LINENS IN PREVENTING HOSPITAL-ACQUIRED INFECTIONS. THE STUDY LAUNCHED AT SENTARA NORFOLK GENERAL HOSPITAL'S ICU AND SENTARA LEIGH HOSPITAL'S EAST TOWER IN THE FIRST QUARTER OF 2014 WITH MORE THAN 15,000 HORIZONTAL SQUARE FEET OF PATENT-PENDING CUPRON-ENHANCED EOS SURFACES INSTALLED. ANTI-ODOR TEXTILES MANUFACTURED BY ENCOMPASS ARE USED FOR PATIENT BED LINENS, GOWNS AND OTHER TEXTILES. THE COMPREHENSIVE PROGRAM IS BELIEVED TO BE THE WORLD'S LARGEST HOSPITAL EVALUATION OF ANTIMICROBIAL-PROTECTED MATERIALS, WITH THE GOAL OF COMBATING THE SPREAD OF PATHOGENS KNOWN TO CONTRIBUTE TO HEALTHCARE INFECTIONS. APPROXIMATELY SEVEN MILLION PEOPLE WORLDWIDE SUFFER FROM HOSPITAL-ACQUIRED INFECTIONS EACH YEAR. IV. BUILDING FOR THE FUTURE ALONG WITH REACHING OUT TO NEW COMMUNITIES, SENTARA HEALTHCARE STRIVES TO BUILD ON OUR EXISTING SERVICES AND IN OUR ESTABLISHED AREAS SO THAT WE EXCEED OUR PATIENTS' EXPECTATIONS AND MEET GROWING HEALTHCARE DEMANDS. SOME OF THE CHANGES WE HAVE INVESTED IN RECENTLY WITHIN OUR ESTABLISHED COMMUNITIES INCLUDE: A. LORTON OUTPATIENT FACILITIES NEW OUTPATIENT FACILITIES OPENED IN LORTON/FAIRFAX COUNTY IN JUNE 2013. IT INCLUDES A 24-HOUR EMERGENCY DEPARTMENT AND AN ADVANCED IMAGING CENTER WITH A 64-SLICE CT AT LORTON MARKETPLACE AND ANOTHER IMAGING CENTER AT LORTON STATION, WHICH ADDED 3D MAMMOGRAPHY IN JULY 2013. THESE ARE CONVENIENT HEALTHCARE DESTINATIONS IN A FAST-GROWING MARKETPLACE WHERE THE MAJORITY OF POPULATION GROWTH WILL BE FROM PEOPLE OVER 65. B. BEHAVIORAL HEALTH UNIT A 24-BED INPATIENT BEHAVIORAL HEALTH UNIT OPENED AT SENTARA VIRGINIA BEACH GENERAL HOSPITAL IN JANUARY 2014. THE UNIT INCLUDES 16 BEDS DESIGNATED FOR GERIATRIC PATIENTS AND EIGHT GENERAL ADULT BEDS. THE NUMBER OF PATIENTS SEEKING PSYCHIATRIC SERVICES THROUGH THE EMERGENCY DEPARTMENT AT SENTARA VIRGINIA BEACH GENERAL HAS INCREASED 111 PERCENT SINCE 2006. IN THE PAST, SOME PATIENTS HAVE HAD TO WAIT FOR ADMISSION IN THE EMERGENCY DEPARTMENT, WHERE A STAFF PERSON HAD TO BE COMMITTED TO THE PATIENT FOR HIS OR HER SAFETY. THE NEW BEDS SPEED UP ADMISSION AND IMPROVE CARE. C. MARTHA JEFFERSON NEUROSCIENCE CENTER THE NEUROSCIENCE CENTER BEGAN SERVING PATIENTS IN JANUARY 2013. IT IS EQUIPPED WITH THE LATEST TECHNOLOGY, WITH ELECTROMYOGRAPHY (EMG) AND ELECTROENCEPHALOGRAPHY (EEG) DIAGNOSTIC EQUIPMENT, NEW VESTIBULAR BALANCE REHABILITATION EQUIPMENT, LOW-DOSE CT-IMAGING, AND COMPLETE COMPLEX BRAIN SURGERY SUCH AS STEREOTACTIC RADIOSURGERY (SRS). FOUR NEUROLOGISTS, TWO NEUROSURGEONS AND 13 REHAB THERAPISTS ARE UNDER ONE ROOF TO ENSURE PATIENTS RECEIVE CARE IN ONE LOCATION. THE CENTER HAS ROLLED-OUT MULTI-DISCIPLINARY SUBSPECIALTY CLINICS THAT DELIVER A COORDINATED, PATIENT-CENTERED APPROACH. THE CLINICS INCLUDE THE SEIZURE DISORDER AND EPILEPSY CLINIC, THE NEUROPATHY CLINIC, THE STROKE RECOVERY CLINIC, THE COGNITIVE REHABILITATION CLINIC AND THE VESTIBULAR BALANCE AND FALLS PREVENTION CLINIC. D. SENTARA EASTERN VIRGINIA MEDICAL SCHOOL (EVMS) COMPREHENSIVE PELVIC FLOOR CENTER SENTARA AND EVMS PARTNERED IN FEBRUARY 2013 TO CREATE THE CENTER AND COMBINE THE LATEST IN RESEARCH, STATE-OF-THE-ART TECHNOLOGY AND A MULTIDISCIPLINARY CARE TEAM. THE CENTER BRINGS TOGETHER SPECIALISTS IN UROGYNECOLOGY, GASTROENTEROLOGY, SPECIALIZED RADIOLOGY, UROLOGY, COLORECTAL MEDICINE AND SURGERY, PHYSICAL MEDICINE AND REHABILITATION, NUTRITION AND PHYSICAL THERAPY TO HELP PATIENTS WITH PROBLEMS RELATED TO THE LOWER URINARY TRACT AND THE PELVIC FLOOR. ALMOST HALF OF ALL WOMEN AND ONE IN FIVE MEN WILL EXPERIENCE URINARY INCONTINENCE, AND ROUGHLY 10 PERCENT OF WOMEN WILL UNDERGO SURGERY FOR PELVIC ORGAN PROLAPSE OR URINARY INCONTINENCE."
201423149349300867,540506331,"FORM 990, PART III, LINE 4A","E. SENTARA LEIGH TOWERS WORK BEGAN IN DECEMBER 2011 ON A MULTI-PHASE, THREE-YEAR PROJECT TO BUILD A NEW SENTARA LEIGH HOSPITAL ON THE SITE OF THE CURRENT ONE. SENTARA OPENED THE NEW EAST TOWER IN NOVEMBER 2013. ALONG WITH OUR PLANNED WEST TOWER, IT REPLACES THREE 1970S-ERA WINGS AT THE NORFOLK, VIRGINIA HOSPITAL. THE TOWERS FEATURE STATE-OF-THE-ART PATIENT ROOMS WITH PRIVATE BATHROOMS, NO-STEP SHOWERS AND OVERNIGHT ACCOMMODATIONS FOR FAMILIES. THE PROJECT ALSO INCLUDES A 48-BED ORTHOPEDIC AND REHABILITATION CENTER ON THE FIRST FLOOR AND EMPLOYS PART OF THE OUTSIDE GARDEN SPACE FOR WALKING EXERCISES ON DIFFERENT GRADES AND SURFACES, MAKING IT A TRUE HEALING GARDEN. THE TOWERS PROJECT WILL CONTINUE AS OUR STAFF MAINTAINS EXCELLENT, UNINTERRUPTED PATIENT CARE DURING THE PHASED CONSTRUCTION. F. SENTARA HOSPICE HOUSE IN MARCH 2013, SENTARA OPENED SENTARA HOSPICE HOUSE, AN 8,311 SQUARE-FOOT FACILITY TO PROVIDE CARE FOR UP TO 12 PEOPLE AND THEIR FAMILIES. PREVIOUSLY, WITH ONLY FIVE LIVE-IN HOSPICES IN VIRGINIA AND NONE IN HAMPTON ROADS, PATIENTS WERE NOT OFTEN ABLE TO CHOOSE THIS CARE. NOW THEY CAN. G. ROCKINGHAM MEMORIAL HOSPITAL (RMH) WOMEN'S CENTER CONSTRUCTION BEGAN ON THE RMH FUNKHOUSER WOMEN'S CENTER IN JUNE 2012 AND WAS COMPLETED JUNE 2013. THE 15,000 SQUARE FOOT CENTER HOUSES WOMEN'S IMAGING, INCLUDING ADVANCED BREAST IMAGING/MAMMOGRAPHY AND BONE DENSITY SCREENING, RMH BREAST CARE, THE IMAGE RECOVERY CENTER AND RMH HEART CHECK FOR MEN AND WOMEN AND A SURGEON'S OFFICE. H. ROCKINGHAM MEMORIAL HOSPITAL (RMH) OUTPATIENT ORTHOPEDICS & ADVANCED IMAGING CENTER RMH GAINED APPROVAL FOR THE NEW CENTER IN JULY 2012. THE NEW FACILITY WILL BE AN ORTHOPEDIC AND SPORTS MEDICINE DESTINATION INCLUDING ADVANCED IMAGING, RMH ORTHOPEDICS AND SPORTS MEDICINE, REHABILITATION THERAPY, A SPORTS PERFORMANCE ARENA AND AN INTERVENTIONAL SUITE FOR PAIN MANAGEMENT AND SPECIAL PROCEDURES. THE CENTER IS SCHEDULED TO BE COMPLETED IN LATE 2015. I. MARTHA JEFFERSON OUTPATIENT CARE CENTER A NEW OUTPATIENT CARE CENTER OPENED IN THE FALL OF 2012, WITH A FREE-STANDING 24-HOUR ED AND IMAGING, LABORATORY SERVICES AND A PRIMARY CARE PRACTICE. THE ED SHORTENS TRAVEL TIME FOR EMS PROVIDERS, AND THE FACILITY AS A WHOLE HELPS CUT TRAVEL TIME FOR PATIENTS IN THE NORTHERN COUNTIES OF VIRGINIA. V. SENTARA QUALITY & PATIENT SAFETY DISTINCTIONS A. MEASURING QUALITY HEALTHCARE SINCE OUR HEALTH SYSTEM'S EARLIEST YEARS, WE HAVE BELIEVED THE COMMUNITY DESERVES HEALTHCARE THAT IS MEASURABLY BETTER. SENTARA'S GOAL IS TO BE ACCREDITED BY RESPECTED NATIONAL ORGANIZATIONS AND TO ACHIEVE TOP 10 PERCENT PERFORMANCE WHEREVER BENCHMARKS EXIST. WE ARE PROUD OF THE WORK WE HAVE DONE SO FAR TOWARD THIS GOAL, AS IT HAS BEEN RECOGNIZED IN MANY WAYS: 1. TOP 100 INTEGRATED HEALTHCARE NETWORK SENTARA HAS CONSISTENTLY RANKED AMONG THE NATION'S TOP INTEGRATED HEALTHCARE NETWORKS AS PUBLISHED IN MODERN HEALTHCARE'S FACT-BASED RANKING. THE ONLY HEALTHCARE SYSTEM IN THE COUNTRY TO BE AMONG THE NATION'S TOP 10 FOR ALL 15 YEARS OF THE SURVEY, SENTARA LANDED AT NUMBER ONE IN 2001, 2010 AND 2011. THE STUDY, PUBLISHED ANNUALLY, HIGHLIGHTS THE TOP 100 INTEGRATED HEALTH CARE NETWORKS ACROSS THE NATION AS SELECTED BY SDI, A HEALTH INFORMATION COMPANY. 2. USING TECHNOLOGY TO IMPROVE CARE SENTARA HEALTHCARE WAS BEEN NAMED ONE OF THE NATION'S MOST WIRED HEALTH SYSTEMS IN THE 2013 AND 2012 MOST WIRED SURVEY AND BENCHMARKING STUDY. HOSPITALS & HEALTH NETWORKS POLLED ABOUT 1,570 HOSPITALS. THE SURVEY ASSESSES HOSPITALS AND HEALTH SYSTEMS' MEANINGFUL USE OF ELECTRONIC MEDIA TECHNOLOGY IN FOUR AREAS INFRASTRUCTURE, BUSINESS AND ADMINISTRATIVE MANAGEMENT, CLINICAL QUALITY AND SAFETY, AND CARE CONTINUUM. 3. AWARD-WINING CARDIAC AND NEPHROLOGY CARE SENTARA HEART HOSPITAL/SENTARA NORFOLK GENERAL HOSPITAL IS A COMPREHENSIVE NETWORK OF PROVIDERS, FACILITIES AND SERVICES WORKING TOGETHER TO ENSURE THE HIGHEST LEVEL OF CARE. SENTARA NORFOLK GENERAL HOSPITAL HAS BEEN RANKED THE NUMBER ONE HOSPITAL IN VIRGINIA AND HAMPTON ROADS BY U.S. NEWS & WORLD REPORT. IN THE 2014-15 U.S. NEWS BEST HOSPITALS RANKINGS, THE HOSPITAL WAS RECOGNIZED WITH TWO NATIONALLY RANKED TOP 50 PROGRAMS. CARDIOLOGY AND HEART SURGERY ARE RANKED 44TH, WHICH MARKS THE PROGRAM'S 14TH CONSECUTIVE YEAR AMONG THE NATION'S ELITE PROGRAMS IN THE U.S. NEWS NATIONAL SURVEY. FOR THE FIRST TIME, EAR, NOSE AND THROAT IS ALSO AMONG THE NATION'S TOP 50 PROGRAMS AT NUMBER 41. THIS NATIONAL RANKING IS DUE, IN PART, TO INNOVATIVE PROCEDURES USED BY SURGEONS AND RADIOLOGISTS WITH EASTERN VIRGINIA MEDICAL SCHOOL MEDICAL GROUP FOR PATIENTS WITH HEAD AND NECK CANCERS AND TRAUMATIC INJURIES. THE TWO SPECIALTIES ARE THE ONLY TOP-50 RANKED HEART AND ENT PROGRAMS IN VIRGINIA. IN ADDITION TO THE NATIONAL RANKINGS, U.S. NEWS INCLUDED RANKINGS FOR STATE AND METRO AREAS. SEVEN SENTARA HOSPITALS WERE FEATURED IN THE RANKINGS, WITH SENTARA NORFOLK GENERAL HOSPITAL LISTED AT NUMBER ONE IN THE REGION AND NUMBER ONE IN THE STATE. MARTHA JEFFERSON HOSPITAL RANKED 11TH IN THE STATE AND SENTARA ROCKINGHAM MEMORIAL HOSPITAL 15TH. SENTARA VIRGINIA BEACH GENERAL HOSPITAL WAS 8TH IN THE STATE AND SECOND IN HAMPTON ROADS; SENTARA WILLIAMSBURG REGIONAL MEDICAL CENTER TIED WITH SENTARA LEIGH HOSPITAL FOR 20TH IN THE STATE AND WAS RANKED THIRD IN HAMPTON ROADS. SENTARA LEIGH WAS SIXTH IN HAMPTON ROADS. SENTARA PRINCESS ANNE HOSPITAL RANKED 15TH IN THE STATE AND THIRD IN HAMPTON ROADS. 4. OUTSTANDING CANCER CARE AFTER A THREE-DAY SURVEY IN 2012, THE AMERICAN COLLEGE OF SURGEONS' COMMISSION ON CANCER RE-ACCREDITED THE SENTARA CANCER NETWORK FOR THREE YEARS WITH COMMENDATIONS. THE ACCREDITATION WAS AS AN ""INTEGRATED NETWORK"" THE ONLY ONE IN VIRGINIA WITH NO DEFICIENCIES. 5. SENTARA SYSTEM STROKE TEAM IN FEBRUARY 2013, THE VIRGINIA HOSPITAL ASSOCIATION SELECTED SENTARA'S STANDARDIZED STROKE PROGRAM AS A LEADING BEST PRACTICE. THE SYSTEM STROKE TEAM AT SENTARA DEVELOPED A STANDARDIZED PROGRAM AND IMPLEMENTED IT AT 10 SENTARA HOSPITALS. THE TEAM EVALUATED THE ENTIRE STROKE PROCESS FROM DIAGNOSIS IN THE FIELD AND TREATMENT IN THE EMERGENCY DEPARTMENT TO PATIENT DISCHARGE. THE RESULTS INCLUDED A REDUCTION IN SYSTEM-WIDE STROKE MORTALITY FROM 11 PERCENT IN 2008 TO FIVE PERCENT IN 2012; A REDUCTION IN AVERAGE LENGTH OF STAY BY TWO DAYS WITH AN ASSOCIATED COST SAVINGS OF $1.1 MILLION; AND INCREASED STROKE CORE METRIC PERFORMANCE FROM 54.9 PERCENT OF GOAL MET IN 2009 TO 92.1 PERCENT OF GOAL MET IN 2012. 6.THE JOINT COMMISSION AND DET NORSKE VERITAS HEALTHCARE, INC. (DNVHC) ACCREDITATION THE JOINT COMMISSION ON ACCREDITATION OF HEALTHCARE ORGANIZATIONS HAS GIVEN SEVERAL OF OUR HOSPITALS ITS GOLD SEAL OF APPROVAL AND DISEASE-SPECIFIC CARE CERTIFICATION. AN INDEPENDENT, NOT-FOR-PROFIT ORGANIZATION, THE JOINT COMMISSION ACCREDITS AND CERTIFIES MORE THAN 20,500 HEALTH CARE ORGANIZATIONS AND PROGRAMS IN THE UNITED STATES. JOINT COMMISSION ACCREDITATION AND CERTIFICATION IS RECOGNIZED NATIONWIDE AS A SYMBOL OF QUALITY THAT REFLECTS AN ORGANIZATION'S COMMITMENT TO MEETING CERTAIN PERFORMANCE STANDARDS. THEIR MISSION IS TO CONTINUOUSLY IMPROVE HEALTHCARE FOR THE PUBLIC BY EVALUATING HEALTHCARE ORGANIZATIONS AND INSPIRING THEM TO EXCEL IN PROVIDING SAFE AND EFFECTIVE CARE OF THE HIGHEST QUALITY AND VALUE.

201423149349300867,540506331,"FORM 990, PART III, LINE 4A","7. AWARD FOR SUPPORTING BREASTFEEDING FOUR SENTARA HOSPITALS IN HAMPTON ROADS AND SIX PROGRAM CHAMPIONS RECEIVED BUSINESS INVESTMENT IN BABIES (BIB) AWARDS IN 2012 FROM THE BUSINESS CASE FOR BREASTFEEDING PROGRAM ADMINISTERED THROUGH CINCH, THE COALITION FOR INFANT AND CHILD HEALTH AT EASTERN VIRGINIA MEDICAL SCHOOL. SENTARA WAS AMONG THE EMPLOYERS CITED FOR CREATING A SUPPORTIVE ENVIRONMENT FOR NURSING MOTHERS TO PUMP BREAST MILK DURING THE WORKDAY BY PROVIDING TIME, PRIVATE SPACE, AND WRITTEN POLICIES. HOSPITALS INCLUDED SENTARA NORFOLK GENERAL, SENTARA LEIGH, SENTARA VIRGINIA BEACH GENERAL, AND SENTARA PRINCESS ANNE. 8. FIVE-STAR RANKINGS, SILVER ACHIEVEMENT, AND EXCELLENCE IN ACTION AWARDS FOR NURSING CENTERS IN 2013, FOR THE THIRD YEAR IN A ROW, TWO SENTARA NURSING CENTERS RECEIVED A FIVE STAR OVERALL RANKING IN U.S. NEWS & WORLD REPORT'S ANNUAL BEST NURSING HOMES SURVEY. BEST NURSING HOMES RECOGNIZES TOP-RATED HOMES IN THE UNITED STATES. OF MORE THAN 15,500 HOMES RATED, SENTARA NURSING CENTER WINDMERE, VIRGINIA BEACH AND NURSING CENTER PORTSMOUTH WERE AMONG FEWER THAN ONE IN EIGHT THAT RECEIVED A FIVE-STAR OVERALL RATING IN ALL FOUR QUARTERS. SENTARA NURSING CENTER BARCO, NORTH CAROLINA RECEIVED FIVE STARS IN 2012 AND 2013 AS WELL. SENTARA NURSING CENTER-CURRITUCK RECEIVED A 2012 SILVER-ACHIEVEMENT IN QUALITY AWARD FROM THE AMERICAN HEALTHCARE ASSOCIATION AND NATIONAL CENTER FOR ASSISTED LIVING. THE COMPETITIVE AWARDS FOLLOW CRITERIA IN THE BALDRIGE PERFORMANCE EXCELLENCE PROGRAM AND MARK MEASURABLE PROGRESS IN QUALITY IMPROVEMENTS IN LONG TERM CARE. B. PATIENT SAFETY OUR FOCUS GOES BEYOND THE BASICS OF MAKING HEALTHCARE SAFE FOR OUR PATIENTS. SENTARA HAS BUILT A STRONG ""CULTURE OF SAFETY"" TO REDUCE MEDICAL ERRORS BY MODELING SUCCESSFUL PROGRAMS FROM THE NUCLEAR POWER AND AVIATION INDUSTRIES. THIS CULTURE OF SAFETY PROMOTES BEHAVIORS THAT RESULT IN SAFE, RELIABLE AND EFFECTIVE CARE. THE FOUNDATION OF THIS CULTURE IS A STRONG ACCOUNTABILITY TO PERFORM REGIMENTED BEHAVIORS THAT REDUCE MEDICAL ERRORS. OUR STAFF USES GUIDELINES KNOWN AS ""BEHAVIOR BASED EXPECTATIONS"" OR BBE'S TO ENSURE THE HIGHEST STANDARD OF CARE. THE GOAL IS TO MAKE THESE TOOLS AND TECHNIQUES A HABIT. FOR OUR DEDICATION, WE HAVE RECEIVED NUMEROUS AWARDS FOR PATIENT SAFETY AND QUALITY OF CARE STANDARDS. 1. THE LEAPFROG HOSPITAL SURVEY THE LEAPFROG HOSPITAL RECOGNITION PROGRAM (LHRP) HONORS HOSPITALS THAT DEMONSTRATE EXCELLENCE OR IMPROVEMENT IN PATIENT SAFETY, QUALITY, AND RESOURCE UTILIZATION. IN 2012, THE LEAPFROG GROUP DEVELOPED THE HOSPITAL SAFETY SCORE, GRADING MORE THAN 2,600 OF THE NATION'S HOSPITALS ON PATIENT SAFETY. IN VIRGINIA, 58 HOSPITALS WERE NAMED IN THE REPORT, AND SEVEN SENTARA HOSPITALS ACHIEVED THE HIGHEST GRADE OF A FOR DELIVERING SAFE CARE TO PATIENTS. IN 2013, LEAPFROG RECOGNIZED SENTARA NORFOLK GENERAL HOSPITAL WITH AN A RATING. 2. INFECTION PREVENTION PREVENTION OF HEALTH CARE-ASSOCIATED INFECTIONS IS A NATIONAL CONCERN, AND SENTARA CONTINUALLY STRIVES TO REDUCE THESE CASES. ALL OF OUR HOSPITALS HAVE BEEN WORKING DILIGENTLY TO REDUCE THE OCCURRENCE OF VENTILATOR-ASSOCIATED PNEUMONIA (VAP), WHICH CAN DEVELOP IN PATIENTS WHO HAVE BEEN ON MECHANICAL VENTILATION FOR 48 HOURS OR MORE. IN 2013, SENTARA WILLIAMSBURG REGIONAL MEDICAL CENTER MARKED NINE CONSECUTIVE YEARS WITH ZERO CASES OF VAP, WHICH NO OTHER HOSPITAL IN THE COUNTRY CAN CLAIM. THE DEPARTMENT OF HEALTH AND HUMAN SERVICES AND THE CRITICAL CARE SOCIETIES COLLABORATIVE HAVE RECOGNIZED WILLIAMSBURG FOR OUTSTANDING ACHIEVEMENT AND LEADERSHIP IN THE ELIMINATION OF VAP. VOLUNTARY HOSPITALS OF AMERICA (VHA), A VOLUNTARY NATIONAL ORGANIZATION FOCUSED ON HEALTH CARE FINANCIAL PERFORMANCE THROUGH CLINICAL EXCELLENCE AND SUPPLY CHAIN MANAGEMENT, ""BLUEPRINTED"" THE PRACTICES AT SENTARA WILLIAMSBURG REGIONAL MEDICAL CENTER AS A MODEL FOR HOSPITALS ACROSS THE COUNTRY. 3. IMPROVING PATIENT SAFETY THROUGH TECHNOLOGY SENTARA HEALTHCARE PROVIDES THE SENTARA ECARE HEALTH NETWORK. THE CLINICAL SYSTEM USES INNOVATIVE TECHNOLOGY TO LINK PATIENT MEDICAL INFORMATION BETWEEN OUR HOSPITALS, PHYSICIAN PRACTICES AND OTHER HEALTH CARE SITES OVER A PROTECTED NETWORK, ENABLING THE SECURE SHARING OF PATIENT INFORMATION, INCREASING PATIENT SAFETY AND REDUCING PREVENTABLE MEDICAL ERRORS. MYCHART, THE COMPONENT OF ECARE THAT ALLOWS PATIENTS TO ACCESS PART OF THEIR MEDICAL RECORDS, WAS PROMOTED TO PATIENTS IN 2011. A PHONE APP WAS CREATED TO PROVIDE EASY ACCESS AS WELL. CURRENTLY, 140,000 PATIENTS ACCESS MYCHART EACH YEAR. 2013 MARKED THE 13TH YEAR THAT WE EMPLOYED OUR EICU REMOTE MONITORING SYSTEM FOR OUR SICKEST HOSPITAL PATIENTS. SENTARA WAS THE FIRST HOSPITAL SYSTEM IN THE COUNTRY TO IMPLEMENT THE EICU SYSTEM, WHICH USES A NETWORK OF CAMERAS, MONITORS, ALERTS, AND TWO-WAY COMMUNICATION LINKS. DOCTORS AND CRITICAL CARE NURSES AT THE EICU COMMAND CENTER MAKE VIRTUAL ROUNDS ON ICU PATIENTS. THIS SENTARA-PIONEERED TECHNOLOGY IS NOW USED TO HELP CARE FOR PATIENTS IN NEARLY 5,000 ICU BEDS NATIONALLY. ANOTHER SAFETY INITIATIVE ADOPTED BY SENTARA IS BEDSIDE MEDICATION VERIFICATION, INCLUDING BAR-CODING TECHNOLOGY. NATIONAL STUDIES HAVE FOUND THAT BEDSIDE VERIFICATION CAN REDUCE HOSPITAL MEDICATION ERRORS BY NEARLY 70 PERCENT. VI. COMMITMENT TO THE COMMUNITY AS A NOT-FOR-PROFIT HEALTHCARE ORGANIZATION, WE CONTINUOUSLY REINVEST IN THE COMMUNITY-BY PURCHASING THE MOST MEDICALLY ADVANCED TECHNOLOGY; BUILDING NEW, STATE-OF-THE-ART HEALTHCARE FACILITIES; TRAINING MEDICAL PROFESSIONALS; AND PROVIDING THE HIGHEST QUALITY HEALTHCARE TO ALL PATIENTS REGARDLESS OF THEIR ABILITY TO PAY. IT'S NOT JUST OUR MISSION, IT'S OUR COMMITMENT TO THE COMMUNITY. MARTHA JEFFERSON HOSPITAL WAS HONORED BY THE CHARLOTTESVILLE REGIONAL CHAMBER OF COMMERCE WITH THE 2012 HOVEY S. DABNEY AWARD FOR CORPORATE CITIZENSHIP. ORGANIZATIONS RECEIVING THIS AWARD ARE KNOWN FOR ENGAGING IN SOUND, SUCCESSFUL BUSINESS PRACTICE AND BEING GOOD PARTNERS WITH OTHER BUSINESSES, INVESTING DIRECTLY IN THE ECONOMIC AND CULTURAL ADVANCEMENT OF THE COMMUNITY, PURSING A POSITIVE WORK ENVIRONMENT, AND INSPIRING BY EXAMPLE. THE FEDERAL DEPARTMENT OF HEALTH AND HUMAN SERVICES AWARDED ROCKINGHAM MEMORIAL HOSPITAL (RMH) WITH A $3.1 MILLION, FIVE-YEAR GRANT IN NOVEMBER 2012 TO HELP FAMILIES AT RISK FROM SUBSTANCE ABUSE. AS A FISCAL AGENT, RMH OVERSEES ADMINISTRATION OF THE GRANT, AND CENTRAL SHENANDOAH VALLEY FAMILY PARTNERSHIP HELPS FAMILIES WITH CHILDREN IN DANGER OF BEING REMOVED FROM THEIR HOMES BECAUSE OF SUBSTANCE ABUSE BY A CAREGIVER. SOLIANT HEALTH NAMED MARTHA JEFFERSON HOSPITAL THE TOP VOTE-GETTER IN THE COUNTRY IN ITS ANNUAL ""MOST BEAUTIFUL HOSPITAL"" SURVEY IN 2012. HERE ARE SOME OF THE OTHER WAYS WE'VE INVESTED IN THE PEOPLE WE SERVE: A. THE SENTARA HEALTH FOUNDATION WE ESTABLISHED THE SENTARA HEALTH FOUNDATION IN 1998 TO IMPROVE HEALTH AND QUALITY OF LIFE THROUGHOUT SOUTHEASTERN VIRGINIA AND NORTH CAROLINA, AND TO DEMONSTRATE OUR NOT-FOR-PROFIT MISSION. THE FOUNDATION HAS TOUCHED THE LIVES OF MANY VIRGINIA RESIDENTS FROM THE EASTERN SHORE TO GREATER HAMPTON ROADS THROUGH GRANTS SUPPORTING COMMUNITY HEALTH PROGRAMS. SPECIFICALLY, IT HAS AWARDED OVER $10 MILLION IN GRANTS, INCLUDING $601,800 IN 2013. PROGRAMS INCLUDE DENTAL CARE, PRENATAL SUPPORT, MEDICATION ASSISTANCE, AND REDUCED-COST PRIMARY CARE. THE FOUNDATION ALSO SPONSORS COMMUNITY EVENTS, SUCH AS THE SUSAN G. KOMEN TIDEWATER RACE FOR THE CURE, THE AMERICAN HEART ASSOCIATION HEART GALA AND HEART WALK AND THE AMERICAN CANCER SOCIETY RELAY FOR LIFE. B. IN SUPPORT OF THE COMMUNITY LED BY A VOLUNTEER COMMUNITY BOARD OF DIRECTORS, SENTARA PROUDLY PROVIDES CARE TO ALL, AND REINVESTS IN THE COMMUNITY IN NUMEROUS WAYS: 1. CONTRIBUTIONS EACH YEAR, WE PROVIDE MILLIONS OF DOLLARS IN BENEFITS TO THE COMMUNITY. IN 2013, SENTARA REINVESTED $299,989,000 INTO OUR COMMUNITIES. SENTARA EARMARKED $20,454,000 FOR HEALTH CARE TEACHING PROGRAMS TO ENSURE A QUALIFIED POOL OF PHYSICIANS AND NURSES. WE ALSO SPENT $5,355,000 TO SUPPORT LOCAL COMMUNITY PROGRAMS THAT PROVIDED HEALTH EVENTS AND HEALTH SCREENINGS TO INDIVIDUALS. WE FUNDED $274,180,000 IN UNCOMPENSATED PATIENT CARE FOR PEOPLE WHO WERE UNINSURED OR UNDERINSURED. 2. MEDICALLY UNDERSERVED SENTARA MEDICAL GROUP'S PHYSICIANS AND MEDICAL STAFF VOLUNTEER THOUSANDS OF HOURS TO EASTERN VIRGINIA MEDICAL SCHOOL (EVMS), FREE CLINICS, COMMUNITY EDUCATION, AND CIVIC AND CHARITABLE PROGRAMS. WE SUPPORT AND OPERATE UNCOMPENSATED CARE CLINICS THROUGHOUT THE REGION, INCLUDING THE SENTARA AMBULATORY CARE CENTER (ACC). THE ACC IS A COLLABORATIVE EFFORT WITH EVMS AND IS LOCATED NEAR SENTARA NORFOLK GENERAL HOSPITAL. IT FEATURES AN APPOINTMENT SIDE, WHICH FUNCTIONS LIKE A DOCTOR'S OFFICE, AND A SAME-DAY ""WALK-IN"" SERVICE SIDE FOR MORE PRESSING AND IMMEDIATE HEALTH CONCERNS."

IN LINE WITH THIS PHILOSOPHY, THE SYSTEM PERFORMED SUBSTANTIAL DUE DILIGENCE AS TO MARKET COMPARABLES.

OVERALL, THE CONSULTANT DETERMINED THAT SENTARA'S PAY WAS ALIGNED WITH ITS RELATIVE PERFORMANCE. THE COMPENSATION STUDY WAS PRESENTED TO THE SYSTEM'S COMPENSATION COMMITTEE, WHICH MADE ITS COMPENSATION DECISIONS BASED ON A)ITS REVIEW AND ANALYSIS OF THE PERFORMANCE OF BOTH THE ORGANIZATION AND ITS SENIOR EXECUTIVES AND, B) A REASONABLENESS OF COMPENSATION ANALYSIS AND OPINION FROM AN EXTERNAL EXPERT IN THE COMPENSATION OF EXECUTIVES IN THE TAX-EXEMPT HEALTH CARE FIELD.

IN 2013 ALONE, REGIONS PROVIDED $62.2 MILLION IN CHARITY CARE CHARGES ($21.4 MILLION IN CHARITY CARE COSTS) TO CARE FOR 43,237 PATIENTS WHO DID NOT HAVE INSURANCE OR COULD NOT AFFORD CARE. CHARITY CARE REPRESENTED 2.8 PERCENT OF REGIONS' TOTAL OPERATING EXPENSES. OF THE 75,029 TOTAL PATIENT ACCOUNTS WRITTEN OFF IN 2013, 26,987 WERE PURE SELF-PAY PATIENTS WITH NO COVERAGE AND NO ABILITY TO PAY. APPROXIMATELY 50 PERCENT OF THESE SELF-PAY PATIENTS WERE BETWEEN THE AGES OF 18 AND 24. THE REMAINING 48,042 PATIENTS HAD SOME COVERAGE BUT WERE UNABLE TO PAY THE ""PATIENT RESPONSIBILITY"" PORTION OF THEIR BILL. REGIONS DEFINES CHARITY CARE AS THE COST OF CARE DELIVERED TO PATIENTS WHO ARE WILLING, BUT UNABLE, TO PAY FOR THE SERVICES THEY RECEIVE. THIS INCLUDES PATIENTS WHOSE CHARGES ARE FORGIVEN OR REDUCED BECAUSE OF INABILITY TO PAY, PATIENTS WHO ARE UNABLE TO PAY THE BALANCE LEFT BY A THIRD-PARTY PAYER, AND PATIENTS FOR WHOM UNUSUAL CIRCUMSTANCES OR SPECIAL FINANCIAL HARDSHIP WARRANT SPECIAL CONSIDERATION.

IN FACT, PATIENTS FROM GOVERNMENT PROGRAMS FOR SENIORS CONSTITUTED 39% PERCENT OF REGIONS' CHARGES, PATIENTS FROM GOVERNMENT PROGRAMS FOR THE POOR CONSTITUTED 23% PERCENT OF REGIONS' CHARGES, AND CHARITY CASES WERE 3% OF CHARGES. ONLY 36% OF CHARGES WERE FOR COMMERCIAL OR GOVERNMENT PATIENTS. ALTHOUGH MOST OF REGIONS' REIMBURSEMENT COMES FROM GOVERNMENT PROGRAMS, IT SHOULD ALSO BE NOTED THAT THESE PROGRAMS OFTEN DO NOT COMPENSATE HOSPITALS FOR THE FULL COST OF PROVIDING CARE. REGIONS PAID $13.3 MILLION IN 2013 IN A MINNESOTA HEALTH CARE TAXES EQUAL TO TWO PERCENT OF ITS NET REVENUE FROM PATIENT CARE SERVICES. THE FUNDS RAISED BY THIS TAX ARE EARMARKED BY THE STATE OF MINNESOTA TO INCREASE HEALTH CARE ACCESS FOR MINNESOTANS WHO ARE OTHERWISE UNABLE TO FULLY PAY FOR HEALTH CARE SERVICES.

REGIONS STAFF ACCESSED TELEPHONIC AND VIDEO INTERPRETERS FOR OVER 50 DIFFERENT LANGUAGES DURING 2013. THE COST PAID TO PROVIDE THIS RESOURCE IS $1.7 MILLION FOR 2013.

TO PROVIDE A RANGE OF QUALITY CARE, WE HAVE GROWN SLOWLY THROUGHOUT VIRGINIA AND NORTH CAROLINA. WE HAVE REACHED OUT TO INDUSTRY LEADERS AND JOINED FORCES, AND WE NOW OPERATE MORE THAN 100 SITES OF CARE, INCLUDING 12 ACUTE CARE HOSPITALS - SEVEN IN HAMPTON ROADS, ONE IN NORTHERN VIRGINIA, TWO IN THE BLUE RIDGE REGION OF VIRGINIA, ONE IN SOUTHERN VIRGINIA AND ONE IN NORTH CAROLINA. FOR MORE THAN A DECADE, MODERN HEALTHCARE MAGAZINE HAS RANKED US AS ONE OF THE NATION'S TOP INTEGRATED HEALTHCARE SYSTEMS. OUR NOT-FOR-PROFIT SYSTEM PROUDLY INCLUDES ADVANCED IMAGING CENTERS, NURSING AND ASSISTED-LIVING CENTERS, OUTPATIENT CAMPUSES, PHYSICAL THERAPY AND REHABILITATION SERVICES, HOME HEALTH AND HOSPICE AGENCY, A 3,800-PROVIDER MEDICAL STAFF, AND FOUR MEDICAL GROUPS. IN ADDITION, WE PROVIDE MEDICAL TRANSPORT AMBULANCES AND NIGHTINGALE AIR AMBULANCE, AND EXTEND HEALTH INSURANCE TO 440,000 PEOPLE THROUGH OPTIMA HEALTH, OUR AWARD-WINNING HEALTH PLAN. AMONG OUR MANY STRENGTHS, WE ARE A NATIONAL LEADER IN HEART AND KIDNEY CARE, STROKE CARE, AND INFECTION PREVENTION, AND WE WERE THE FIRST IN THE NATION TO PIONEER AND DEVELOP THE EICU, A REMOTE MONITORING SYSTEM FOR INTENSIVE CARE. OUR DEDICATION TO IMPROVING AND INCREASING MEDICAL OPTIONS FOR OUR PATIENTS IS REINFORCED BY OUR ONGOING PARTICIPATION IN NATIONAL AND INTERNATIONAL RESEARCH. THESE VITAL MEDICAL TRIALS HELP US ADVANCE TOWARD OUR MISSION OF IMPROVING HEALTH EVERY DAY. IN NOVEMBER 2013, WE PROUDLY CELEBRATED 125 YEARS OF DELIVERING COMPASSIONATE AND QUALITY CARE. WHEN WE BEGAN AS THE RETREAT FOR THE SICK IN 1888 IN NORFOLK, VIRGINIA, MEDICAL PROVIDERS DEDICATED THEMSELVES TO CARING FOR NORFOLK'S POOR, FOCUSED ON MEETING THEIR IMMEDIATE HEALTHCARE NEEDS. AS NOTED ABOVE AND DETAILED IN THIS REPORT, WE HAVE GROWN INTO A MULTI-STATE, INTEGRATED HEALTHCARE SYSTEM COMMITTED TO STILL DELIVERING THAT SAME COMPASSIONATE AND QUALITY CARE AND REACHING FAR BEYOND THE PATIENTS WHO COME DIRECTLY TO US. WE STRIVE TO SERVE EVERYONE IN OUR COMMUNITIES THROUGH HEALTH OUTREACH PROGRAMS, EDUCATION AND FINANCIAL SUPPORT OF OTHER NOT-FOR-PROFIT HEALTH ORGANIZATIONS. II.GROWING THE SENTARA FAMILY SINCE THE BEGINNING, SENTARA HAS REACHED OUT TO NEARBY INDUSTRY LEADERS AND JOINED FORCES TO EXTEND HEALTHCARE TO MORE PEOPLE. IN RECENT YEARS, WE HAVE GROWN IN VIRGINIA AND NORTH CAROLINA BY SEEKING PARTNERSHIPS WITH LONG-ESTABLISHED AND SUCCESSFUL HOSPITALS AND HEALTHCARE SYSTEMS WHO SHARE OUR DEDICATION TO EXCELLENCE AND VALUE. SOME OF OUR MOST RECENT ADDITIONS INCLUDE: A. HALIFAX REGIONAL HOSPITAL IN THE FALL OF 2012, HALIFAX REGIONAL HOSPITAL SIGNED A LETTER OF INTENT TO AFFILIATE WITH SENTARA HEALTHCARE. IT IS AN INTEGRATED SYSTEM INCLUDING A 192-BED HOSPITAL, THREE LONG-TERM CARE FACILITIES, A HOME CARE AND HOSPICE FACILITY, AND A BROAD RANGE OF SPECIALTIES AND OUTPATIENT SERVICES ACROSS THE SOUTH BOSTON REGION, ABOUT 165 MILES WEST OF NORFOLK. THE MERGER WAS COMPLETED JULY 1, 2013, WHICH ALSO MARKED HALIFAX'S 60TH ANNIVERSARY SERVING THE SOUTH BOSTON COMMUNITY. THE SYSTEM'S EXTENSIVE EXPERIENCE SERVING RURAL COMMUNITIES MAKES IT PARTICULARLY VALUABLE TO LOCALS AND COMPLEMENTS SENTARA'S COMMITMENT TO PERSONALIZED HEALTHCARE IT IS NOW THE 11TH OF 12 HOSPITALS IN SENTARA'S NOT-FOR-PROFIT INTEGRATED HEALTH SYSTEM. B. SENTARA ALBEMARLE HOSPITAL, MEDICAL GROUP AND RELATED FACILITIES SENTARA HEALTHCARE AND ALBEMARLE HEALTH OF NORTHEASTERN NORTH CAROLINA BEGAN A PARTNERSHIP MARCH 1, 2014, AFTER APPROVAL BY THE PASQUOTANK COUNTY BOARD OF COMMISSIONERS AND THE ALBEMARLE HOSPITAL AUTHORITY BOARD OF COMMISSIONERS AND THEIR TWO-YEAR PROCESS OF EVALUATING POTENTIAL PARTNERS. ALL FOUR ENTITIES SHARE THE GOALS OF IMPROVING THE COMMUNITY'S ACCESS TO PRIMARY CARE, MANAGING CHRONIC DISEASE AND IMPROVING SERVICES AND PROGRAMS IN THE REGION. LOCATED IN ELIZABETH CITY, SENTARA ALBEMARLE MEDICAL CENTER IS A 182 LICENSED BED, FULL-SERVICE FACILITY OFFERING A WIDE RANGE OF SERVICES, INCLUDING: INPATIENT AND CRITICAL CARE, A FULL ARRAY OF SURGICAL SERVICES, SOPHISTICATED DIAGNOSTIC IMAGING TECHNOLOGY, COMPREHENSIVE WOMEN'S CARE, CARDIOLOGY, CANCER TREATMENT, REHABILITATION SERVICES AND MORE. SENTARA ALBEMARLE MEDICAL CENTER HAS ASSEMBLED A MEDICAL STAFF OF MORE THAN 100 PHYSICIANS, REPRESENTING NEARLY 30 SPECIALTIES, AND A CARING STAFF OF ALMOST 1,000 EMPLOYEES. IT IS NUMBER 12 OF OUR 12 HOSPITALS. ALBEMARLE PHYSICIAN SERVICES SENTARA BRINGS TOGETHER A DEDICATED TEAM OF PRIMARY CARE AND SPECIALTY PHYSICIANS TO CARE FOR PATIENTS ACROSS NORTHEASTERN NORTH CAROLINA. ALL OF THE FACILITIES ADOPTED THE SENTARA NAME IN MAY 2014. III.CONSTANTLY LOOKING AHEAD TO BEST SERVE OUR COMMUNITIES AND PROVIDE THE MOST PATIENT-FOCUSED, COST-EFFECTIVE HEALTHCARE POSSIBLE, WE SEEK TO EXPAND AND ENHANCE OUR SERVICES IN A VARIETY OF WAYS. WE STRIVE TO BE THE FIRST IN OUR COMMUNITIES TO OFFER NEW, YET PROVEN, MEDICAL PROCEDURES, AND WE REACH OUT TO NEW COMMUNITIES TO OFFER SERVICES WE HAVE PROUDLY AND SUCCESSFULLY OFFERED IN OTHER REGIONS. WE ALSO LEAD AND PARTICIPATE IN RESEARCH EFFORTS TO IDENTIFY AND TEST FUTURE TREATMENTS AND BEST PRACTICES. SOME OF THE WAYS WE HAVE DONE THIS RECENTLY INCLUDE: A.OFFERING NEW PROCEDURES AND TECHNOLOGY SENTARA PHYSICIANS LEAD THE WAY BY OFFERING LIFE-SAVING PROCEDURES PREVIOUSLY NOT AVAILABLE OR NOT READILY AVAILABLE. BY DOING SO, THEY GIVE RESIDENTS THE COMFORT AND COST-SAVINGS OF BEING CLOSE TO HOME WHILE IMPROVING THEIR HEALTH. IN 2013, SENTARA ADDED 3D MAMMOGRAPHY, A BREAKTHROUGH TECHNOLOGY FOR DETECTING EARLY BREAST CANCER, AT EIGHT BREAST IMAGING LOCATIONS FROM WILLIAMSBURG TO VIRGINIA BEACH. THIS ADVANCED TECHNOLOGY CREATES 3D BREAST RECONSTRUCTIONS SO RADIOLOGISTS CAN VIEW BREASTS IN THIN LAYERS AND SEE EARLY CANCERS THAT WOULD NOT BE VISIBLE USING OTHER MAMMOGRAPHY. IN 2012, SENTARA WILLIAMSBURG REGIONAL MEDICAL CENTER STARTED A NEW TREATMENT FOR SEVERE ASTHMA CALLED BRONCHIAL THERMOPLASTY. THIS MINIMALLY INVASIVE OUTPATIENT PROCEDURE USES A BRONCHOSCOPE TO DELIVER THERMAL ENERGY TO THE LUNGS OF PATIENTS WITH ASTHMA TO DECREASE THE AMOUNT OF SMOOTH MUSCLE IN THE LUNGS THE MUSCLES THAT CONSTRICT AND RESULT IN ASTHMA SYMPTOMS. THAT SAME YEAR, THE SENTARA CANCER NETWORK'S MOBILE PET/CT BEGAN PERFORMING BODY SCANS TO DISCOVER AND STAGE CANCERS THAT MAY HAVE SPREAD TO THE BONES. THIS IS POSSIBLE DUE TO THE FDA'S APPROVAL OF THE USE OF 18F-SODIUM FLUORIDE AS AN INJECTION. AT ROCKINGHAM MEMORIAL HOSPITAL IN 2012, PATIENTS WITH THE HEART CONDITION ATRIAL FIBRILLATION BENEFITTED FROM A PROCEDURE CALLED CARDIAC CRYOABLATION, APPROVED BY THE FDA IN LATE 2010. CRYOABLATION EMPLOYS A SPECIAL BALLOON THAT'S FILLED WITH A COOLANT TO REDUCE ITS TEMPERATURE TO MINUS 80 DEGREES CELSIUS. THE BALLOON IS APPLIED TO THE HEART TISSUES THAT CAUSE IRREGULAR HEARTBEATS, AND THE COLD TEMPERATURES DESTROY THE TISSUE AND CORRECT THE HEART'S PROBLEM. IT HAS PROVED SUCCESSFUL FOR PATIENTS WHO DID NOT RESPOND FULLY TO OTHER TREATMENTS. WITH A $725,000 GRANT FROM THE POTOMAC HEALTH FOUNDATION, SENTARA NORTHERN VIRGINIA MEDICAL CENTER PURCHASED A NEW DIGITAL MAMMOGRAPHY VAN. WITH THE VAN, THE CENTER REACHES WOMEN WITH LITTLE OR NO INSURANCE, IN HOPES OF DETECTING CANCER EARLIER IN WOMEN IN PRINCE WILLIAM COUNTY, WHERE THERE'S A HIGHER-THAN-AVERAGE DEATH RATE FROM BREAST CANCER. ON SEPTEMBER 17, 2012, SURGEONS AND CARDIOLOGISTS AT SENTARA HEART HOSPITAL WERE THE FIRST IN THE WORLD TO BEGIN PERFORMING SURGERIES IN THE DUAL EPICARDIAL ENDOCARDIAL PERSISTENT (DEEP) ATRIAL FIBRILLATION FEASIBILITY TRIAL. THIS FOOD AND DRUG ADMINISTRATION-APPROVED STUDY IS SPONSORED BY CARDIAC DEVICE MANUFACTURER ATRICURE, INC. AND IS DESIGNED TO EVALUATE THE SAFETY AND EFFICACY OF A COMBINED PROCEDURE WHEREBY THE SURGEON CREATES LINES OF BLOCK ON THE OUTSIDE OF THE HEART WORKING THROUGH TINY CHEST INCISIONS. B. EXPANDING SERVICE AREAS AND PARTNERSHIPS IN 2013, WE LAUNCHED AN EFFORT TO BETTER SERVE THE SENIOR POPULATION IN HAMPTON ROADS THROUGH A MEDICARE ADVANTAGE PRODUCT FROM OPTIMA HEALTH, SENTARA HEALTHCARE'S AWARD-WINNING HEALTH PLAN, ONE SPECIALIZED SENTARA MEDICAL GROUP (SMG) PRACTICE AND A NEW COLLABORATION WITH SMG, EASTERN VIRGINIA MEDICAL SCHOOL, OPTIMA HEALTH, SENTARA HOME CARE AND LIFE CARE AND SENTARA HOSPITALS TO CREATE A SEAMLESS EXPERIENCE FOR PATIENTS ACROSS THE CONTINUUM OF CARE."
201443149349301959,541547408,"FORM 990, PART III, LINE 4A","IN AUGUST 2012, SENTARA AND MDLIVE ANNOUNCED AN EQUITY PARTNERSHIP TO DELIVER REAL-TIME MEDICAL CONSULTATIONS VIA TELEPHONE AND ONLINE VIDEO THROUGH AN ESTABLISHED NETWORK OF PHYSICIANS. PATIENTS USE THE MDLIVE VIRTUAL CONSULT PLATFORM TO CONSULT DIRECTLY WITH A LICENSED SENTARA OR PARTNER PHYSICIAN WHO CAN DIAGNOSE LOW-ACUITY ILLNESSES, PROVIDE CARE, AND SUBSCRIBE PRESCRIPTIONS. IN 2013, SENTARA EMPLOYEES WITH OPTIMA HEALTH AND CIGNA INSURANCE RECEIVED THE BENEFIT OF SENTARA MDLIVE APPOINTMENTS FOR A $15 CO-PAY. WE SAW OVER 2,000 SENTARA EMPLOYEES/DEPENDENTS COVERED UNDER OPTIMA INSURANCE REGISTER WITH MDLIVE. THAT SAME YEAR, 429 EMPLOYEES AND THEIR FAMILIES MADE AN APPOINTMENT WITH MDLIVE. SENTARA IS WORKING WITH MDLIVE TO PARTNER WITH OTHER HEALTH SYSTEMS TO OFFER THE BENEFITS TO THEIR EMPLOYEES AND IS WORKING TO LEVERAGE THE TECHNOLOGY TO PILOT NEW MODELS TO TRANSFORM CARE AND IMPROVE LIVES. C. EXPANDING EDUCATIONAL SERVICES CONTINUING TO GROW AND DEVELOP AS WE AIM TO MEET THE DEMAND FOR WELL-EDUCATED HEALTHCARE EXPERTS, THE SENTARA SCHOOL OF HEALTH PROFESSIONALS CHANGED ITS NAME IN 2009 TO THE SENTARA COLLEGE OF HEALTH SCIENCES (SCHS). AT THE SAME TIME, IT RECEIVED APPROVAL TO OFFER A BACCALAUREATE DEGREE IN NURSING, A REQUIREMENT MORE HOSPITALS ARE SETTING FOR ITS STAFF. OUR BACHELOR OF SCIENCE IN NURSING PROGRAM BEGAN IN AUGUST 2010 WITH FOUR WAYS TO RECEIVE A DEGREE: TRADITIONAL BSN, LPN TO BSN, RN TO BSN AND EARLY ADMISSION FOR HIGH SCHOOL SENIORS. THE COLLEGE IS PROVIDING A NEW POOL OF HIGHLY COMPETENT NURSES: THE FIRST RN TO BSN CLASS GRADUATED IN MAY 2012 WITH SEVEN GRADUATES. TWENTY-SIX STUDENTS ALSO GRADUATED IN THE NEW, TRADITIONAL BSN PROGRAM, AND ONE STUDENT GRADUATED IN THE NEW LPN TO BSN PROGRAM. ALL STUDENTS PRACTICE THEIR SKILLS IN SENTARA'S SIMULATION LAB A MINIMUM OF EIGHT TIMES, ENABLING THEM TO PERFECT THEIR CRITICAL-THINKING SKILLS IN A SAFE ENVIRONMENT. THE LAB, EQUIPPED WITH SIX, HIGH-FIDELITY PROGRAMMABLE MANNEQUINS WHO CAN CRY, SWEAT, BREATHE RAPIDLY AND DEVELOP SYMPTOMS OF CARDIAC ARREST, IS LOCATED INSIDE SCHS -- A FEATURE NOT FOUND IN MANY NURSING PROGRAMS -- SO THAT IT IS EASILY ACCESSIBLE FOR BOTH STUDENTS AND PROFESSORS, AND CLASSROOM INSTRUCTION OR FEEDBACK CAN OCCUR IMMEDIATELY AFTERWARDS. WE FURTHERED OUR OFFERINGS WITH THE SURGICAL TECHNOLOGY PROGRAM AT THE COLLEGE LAUNCHING THE FIRST ASSOCIATE OF OCCUPATIONAL SCIENCE DEGREE WITH THE JANUARY 2013 CLASS. D. RESEARCHING FOR THE FUTURE IN A PATIENT STUDY CONDUCTED AT SENTARA LEIGH HOSPITAL IN 2012, NURSES WERE EMPOWERED TO GIVE IV FLUIDS AT THE EARLIEST SIGNS THAT A KNEE OR HIP JOINT REPLACEMENT PATIENT'S BLOOD PRESSURE WAS TRENDING DOWNWARD. BEFORE THE STUDY, A 10-STEP PROCESS INCLUDING A PHYSICIAN ORDER WAS REQUIRED. THIS NEW PROTOCOL SPED CARE AND REDUCED THE NUMBER OF PATIENTS WHOSE CONDITIONS WORSENED DUE TO LOW BLOOD PRESSURE BY 30 PERCENT. STUDY FINDINGS WERE SHARED WITH ORTHOPEDIC NURSES FROM AROUND THE UNITED STATES DURING THE 33RD ANNUAL NATIONAL ASSOCIATION OF ORTHOPAEDIC NURSES CONFERENCE IN SAN ANTONIO IN MAY 2013. IN APRIL 2012, SENTARA HEART HOSPITAL JOINED THE HEARTLIGHT TRIAL FOR THE TREATMENT OF SYMPTOMATIC ATRIAL FIBRILLATION. USING A FIBER OPTIC LIGHT, DOCTORS LOOK INSIDE THE BEATING HEART OF PATIENTS, TESTING A NEW DEVICE CALLED THE CARDIOFOCUS HEARTLIGHT ENDOSCOPIC ABLATION SYSTEM. THE SYSTEM INCLUDES A BALLOON, SMALL CAMERA AND LASER LIGHT TO PRECISELY DELIVER LIGHT ENERGY TO MISFIRING AREAS OF THE HEART AND TO HELP RESTORE REGULAR HEART RHYTHM. THE STUDY REACHED A MILESTONE IN FEBRUARY 2013 WHEN IT ENROLLED MORE THAN HALF OF THE TOTAL STUDY PARTICIPANTS. IN A 10-MONTH, 2012 STUDY, SENTARA PHYSICIANS WORKED WITH THE EASTERN VIRGINIA MEDICAL SCHOOL STRELITZ DIABETES CENTER TO DEVELOP ALERTS IN THE SENTARA ECARE HEALTH NETWORK, OUR ELECTRONIC MEDICAL RECORD SYSTEM, WHEN A CHANGE OCCURS IN A DIABETIC PATIENT'S CONDITION. THE ALERTS OFFER GUIDANCE ABOUT THE APPROPRIATE CARE FOR EACH SITUATION. DURING THE STUDY PERIOD, PATIENTS SHOWED SUBSTANTIAL IMPROVEMENT. NEARLY 900 PATIENTS MOVED FROM THE HIGHEST LEVEL OF RISK FOR COMPLICATIONS TO A HEALTHIER RANGE. THE RESULTS WERE PRESENTED MAY 2, 2013 IN PHOENIX AT THE 22ND ANNUAL SCIENTIFIC AND CLINICAL CONGRESS OF THE AMERICAN ASSOCIATION OF CLINICAL ENDOCRINOLOGIST (AACE). SENTARA PARTNERED WITH CUPRON AND EOS SURFACES IN 2013 TO LAUNCH THE WORLD'S LARGEST CLINICAL TRIAL TO TEST THE EFFECTIVENESS OF COPPER-INFUSED HARD SURFACES AND LINENS IN PREVENTING HOSPITAL-ACQUIRED INFECTIONS. THE STUDY LAUNCHED AT SENTARA NORFOLK GENERAL HOSPITAL'S ICU AND SENTARA LEIGH HOSPITAL'S EAST TOWER IN THE FIRST QUARTER OF 2014 WITH MORE THAN 15,000 HORIZONTAL SQUARE FEET OF PATENT-PENDING CUPRON-ENHANCED EOS SURFACES INSTALLED. ANTI-ODOR TEXTILES MANUFACTURED BY ENCOMPASS ARE USED FOR PATIENT BED LINENS, GOWNS AND OTHER TEXTILES. THE COMPREHENSIVE PROGRAM IS BELIEVED TO BE THE WORLD'S LARGEST HOSPITAL EVALUATION OF ANTIMICROBIAL-PROTECTED MATERIALS, WITH THE GOAL OF COMBATING THE SPREAD OF PATHOGENS KNOWN TO CONTRIBUTE TO HEALTHCARE INFECTIONS. APPROXIMATELY SEVEN MILLION PEOPLE WORLDWIDE SUFFER FROM HOSPITAL-ACQUIRED INFECTIONS EACH YEAR. IV. BUILDING FOR THE FUTURE ALONG WITH REACHING OUT TO NEW COMMUNITIES, SENTARA HEALTHCARE STRIVES TO BUILD ON OUR EXISTING SERVICES AND IN OUR ESTABLISHED AREAS SO THAT WE EXCEED OUR PATIENTS' EXPECTATIONS AND MEET GROWING HEALTHCARE DEMANDS. SOME OF THE CHANGES WE HAVE INVESTED IN RECENTLY WITHIN OUR ESTABLISHED COMMUNITIES INCLUDE: A. LORTON OUTPATIENT FACILITIES NEW OUTPATIENT FACILITIES OPENED IN LORTON/FAIRFAX COUNTY IN JUNE 2013. IT INCLUDES A 24-HOUR EMERGENCY DEPARTMENT AND AN ADVANCED IMAGING CENTER WITH A 64-SLICE CT AT LORTON MARKETPLACE AND ANOTHER IMAGING CENTER AT LORTON STATION, WHICH ADDED 3D MAMMOGRAPHY IN JULY 2013. THESE ARE CONVENIENT HEALTHCARE DESTINATIONS IN A FAST-GROWING MARKETPLACE WHERE THE MAJORITY OF POPULATION GROWTH WILL BE FROM PEOPLE OVER 65. B. BEHAVIORAL HEALTH UNIT A 24-BED INPATIENT BEHAVIORAL HEALTH UNIT OPENED AT SENTARA VIRGINIA BEACH GENERAL HOSPITAL IN JANUARY 2014. THE UNIT INCLUDES 16 BEDS DESIGNATED FOR GERIATRIC PATIENTS AND EIGHT GENERAL ADULT BEDS. THE NUMBER OF PATIENTS SEEKING PSYCHIATRIC SERVICES THROUGH THE EMERGENCY DEPARTMENT AT SENTARA VIRGINIA BEACH GENERAL HAS INCREASED 111 PERCENT SINCE 2006. IN THE PAST, SOME PATIENTS HAVE HAD TO WAIT FOR ADMISSION IN THE EMERGENCY DEPARTMENT, WHERE A STAFF PERSON HAD TO BE COMMITTED TO THE PATIENT FOR HIS OR HER SAFETY. THE NEW BEDS SPEED UP ADMISSION AND IMPROVE CARE. C. MARTHA JEFFERSON NEUROSCIENCE CENTER THE NEUROSCIENCE CENTER BEGAN SERVING PATIENTS IN JANUARY 2013. IT IS EQUIPPED WITH THE LATEST TECHNOLOGY, WITH ELECTROMYOGRAPHY (EMG) AND ELECTROENCEPHALOGRAPHY (EEG) DIAGNOSTIC EQUIPMENT, NEW VESTIBULAR BALANCE REHABILITATION EQUIPMENT, LOW-DOSE CT-IMAGING, AND COMPLETE COMPLEX BRAIN SURGERY SUCH AS STEREOTACTIC RADIOSURGERY (SRS). FOUR NEUROLOGISTS, TWO NEUROSURGEONS AND 13 REHAB THERAPISTS ARE UNDER ONE ROOF TO ENSURE PATIENTS RECEIVE CARE IN ONE LOCATION. THE CENTER HAS ROLLED-OUT MULTI-DISCIPLINARY SUBSPECIALTY CLINICS THAT DELIVER A COORDINATED, PATIENT-CENTERED APPROACH. THE CLINICS INCLUDE THE SEIZURE DISORDER AND EPILEPSY CLINIC, THE NEUROPATHY CLINIC, THE STROKE RECOVERY CLINIC, THE COGNITIVE REHABILITATION CLINIC AND THE VESTIBULAR BALANCE AND FALLS PREVENTION CLINIC. D. SENTARA EASTERN VIRGINIA MEDICAL SCHOOL (EVMS) COMPREHENSIVE PELVIC FLOOR CENTER SENTARA AND EVMS PARTNERED IN FEBRUARY 2013 TO CREATE THE CENTER AND COMBINE THE LATEST IN RESEARCH, STATE-OF-THE-ART TECHNOLOGY AND A MULTIDISCIPLINARY CARE TEAM. THE CENTER BRINGS TOGETHER SPECIALISTS IN UROGYNECOLOGY, GASTROENTEROLOGY, SPECIALIZED RADIOLOGY, UROLOGY, COLORECTAL MEDICINE AND SURGERY, PHYSICAL MEDICINE AND REHABILITATION, NUTRITION AND PHYSICAL THERAPY TO HELP PATIENTS WITH PROBLEMS RELATED TO THE LOWER URINARY TRACT AND THE PELVIC FLOOR. ALMOST HALF OF ALL WOMEN AND ONE IN FIVE MEN WILL EXPERIENCE URINARY INCONTINENCE, AND ROUGHLY 10 PERCENT OF WOMEN WILL UNDERGO SURGERY FOR PELVIC ORGAN PROLAPSE OR URINARY INCONTINENCE."
201443149349301959,541547408,"FORM 990, PART III, LINE 4A","E. SENTARA LEIGH TOWERS WORK BEGAN IN DECEMBER 2011 ON A MULTI-PHASE, THREE-YEAR PROJECT TO BUILD A NEW SENTARA LEIGH HOSPITAL ON THE SITE OF THE CURRENT ONE. SENTARA OPENED THE NEW EAST TOWER IN NOVEMBER 2013. ALONG WITH OUR PLANNED WEST TOWER, IT REPLACES THREE 1970S-ERA WINGS AT THE NORFOLK, VIRGINIA HOSPITAL. THE TOWERS FEATURE STATE-OF-THE-ART PATIENT ROOMS WITH PRIVATE BATHROOMS, NO-STEP SHOWERS AND OVERNIGHT ACCOMMODATIONS FOR FAMILIES.

MEASURING QUALITY HEALTHCARE SINCE OUR HEALTH SYSTEM'S EARLIEST YEARS, WE HAVE BELIEVED THE COMMUNITY DESERVES HEALTHCARE THAT IS MEASURABLY BETTER. SENTARA'S GOAL IS TO BE ACCREDITED BY RESPECTED NATIONAL ORGANIZATIONS AND TO ACHIEVE TOP 10 PERCENT PERFORMANCE WHEREVER BENCHMARKS EXIST. WE ARE PROUD OF THE WORK WE HAVE DONE SO FAR TOWARD THIS GOAL, AS IT HAS BEEN RECOGNIZED IN MANY WAYS: 1. TOP 100 INTEGRATED HEALTHCARE NETWORK SENTARA HAS CONSISTENTLY RANKED AMONG THE NATION'S TOP INTEGRATED HEALTHCARE NETWORKS AS PUBLISHED IN MODERN HEALTHCARE'S FACT-BASED RANKING. THE ONLY HEALTHCARE SYSTEM IN THE COUNTRY TO BE AMONG THE NATION'S TOP 10 FOR ALL 15 YEARS OF THE SURVEY, SENTARA LANDED AT NUMBER ONE IN 2001, 2010 AND 2011. THE STUDY, PUBLISHED ANNUALLY, HIGHLIGHTS THE TOP 100 INTEGRATED HEALTH CARE NETWORKS ACROSS THE NATION AS SELECTED BY SDI, A HEALTH INFORMATION COMPANY. 2. USING TECHNOLOGY TO IMPROVE CARE SENTARA HEALTHCARE WAS BEEN NAMED ONE OF THE NATION'S MOST WIRED HEALTH SYSTEMS IN THE 2013 AND 2012 MOST WIRED SURVEY AND BENCHMARKING STUDY. HOSPITALS & HEALTH NETWORKS POLLED ABOUT 1,570 HOSPITALS. THE SURVEY ASSESSES HOSPITALS AND HEALTH SYSTEMS' MEANINGFUL USE OF ELECTRONIC MEDIA TECHNOLOGY IN FOUR AREAS INFRASTRUCTURE, BUSINESS AND ADMINISTRATIVE MANAGEMENT, CLINICAL QUALITY AND SAFETY, AND CARE CONTINUUM. 3. AWARD-WINING CARDIAC AND NEPHROLOGY CARE SENTARA HEART HOSPITAL/SENTARA NORFOLK GENERAL HOSPITAL IS A COMPREHENSIVE NETWORK OF PROVIDERS, FACILITIES AND SERVICES WORKING TOGETHER TO ENSURE THE HIGHEST LEVEL OF CARE. SENTARA NORFOLK GENERAL HOSPITAL HAS BEEN RANKED THE NUMBER ONE HOSPITAL IN VIRGINIA AND HAMPTON ROADS BY U.S. NEWS & WORLD REPORT. IN THE 2014-15 U.S. NEWS BEST HOSPITALS RANKINGS, THE HOSPITAL WAS RECOGNIZED WITH TWO NATIONALLY RANKED TOP 50 PROGRAMS.

FOR THE FIRST TIME, EAR, NOSE AND THROAT IS ALSO AMONG THE NATION'S TOP 50 PROGRAMS AT NUMBER 41. THIS NATIONAL RANKING IS DUE, IN PART, TO INNOVATIVE PROCEDURES USED BY SURGEONS AND RADIOLOGISTS WITH EASTERN VIRGINIA MEDICAL SCHOOL MEDICAL GROUP FOR PATIENTS WITH HEAD AND NECK CANCERS AND TRAUMATIC INJURIES. THE TWO SPECIALTIES ARE THE ONLY TOP-50 RANKED HEART AND ENT PROGRAMS IN VIRGINIA. IN ADDITION TO THE NATIONAL RANKINGS, U.S. NEWS INCLUDED RANKINGS FOR STATE AND METRO AREAS. SEVEN SENTARA HOSPITALS WERE FEATURED IN THE RANKINGS, WITH SENTARA NORFOLK GENERAL HOSPITAL LISTED AT NUMBER ONE IN THE REGION AND NUMBER ONE IN THE STATE.

THE ACCREDITATION WAS AS AN ""INTEGRATED NETWORK"" THE ONLY ONE IN VIRGINIA WITH NO DEFICIENCIES. 5. SENTARA SYSTEM STROKE TEAM IN FEBRUARY 2013, THE VIRGINIA HOSPITAL ASSOCIATION SELECTED SENTARA'S STANDARDIZED STROKE PROGRAM AS A LEADING BEST PRACTICE. THE SYSTEM STROKE TEAM AT SENTARA DEVELOPED A STANDARDIZED PROGRAM AND IMPLEMENTED IT AT 10 SENTARA HOSPITALS.

THE COMPETITIVE AWARDS FOLLOW CRITERIA IN THE BALDRIGE PERFORMANCE EXCELLENCE PROGRAM AND MARK MEASURABLE PROGRESS IN QUALITY IMPROVEMENTS IN LONG TERM CARE. B. PATIENT SAFETY OUR FOCUS GOES BEYOND THE BASICS OF MAKING HEALTHCARE SAFE FOR OUR PATIENTS. SENTARA HAS BUILT A STRONG ""CULTURE OF SAFETY"" TO REDUCE MEDICAL ERRORS BY MODELING SUCCESSFUL PROGRAMS FROM THE NUCLEAR POWER AND AVIATION INDUSTRIES. THIS CULTURE OF SAFETY PROMOTES BEHAVIORS THAT RESULT IN SAFE, RELIABLE AND EFFECTIVE CARE. THE FOUNDATION OF THIS CULTURE IS A STRONG ACCOUNTABILITY TO PERFORM REGIMENTED BEHAVIORS THAT REDUCE MEDICAL ERRORS. OUR STAFF USES GUIDELINES KNOWN AS ""BEHAVIOR BASED EXPECTATIONS"" OR BBE'S TO ENSURE THE HIGHEST STANDARD OF CARE. THE GOAL IS TO MAKE THESE TOOLS AND TECHNIQUES A HABIT. FOR OUR DEDICATION, WE HAVE RECEIVED NUMEROUS AWARDS FOR PATIENT SAFETY AND QUALITY OF CARE STANDARDS. 1. THE LEAPFROG HOSPITAL SURVEY THE LEAPFROG HOSPITAL RECOGNITION PROGRAM (LHRP) HONORS HOSPITALS THAT DEMONSTRATE EXCELLENCE OR IMPROVEMENT IN PATIENT SAFETY, QUALITY, AND RESOURCE UTILIZATION. IN 2012, THE LEAPFROG GROUP DEVELOPED THE HOSPITAL SAFETY SCORE, GRADING MORE THAN 2,600 OF THE NATION'S HOSPITALS ON PATIENT SAFETY. IN VIRGINIA, 58 HOSPITALS WERE NAMED IN THE REPORT, AND SEVEN SENTARA HOSPITALS ACHIEVED THE HIGHEST GRADE OF A FOR DELIVERING SAFE CARE TO PATIENTS. IN 2013, LEAPFROG RECOGNIZED SENTARA NORFOLK GENERAL HOSPITAL WITH AN A RATING. 2. INFECTION PREVENTION PREVENTION OF HEALTH CARE-ASSOCIATED INFECTIONS IS A NATIONAL CONCERN, AND SENTARA CONTINUALLY STRIVES TO REDUCE THESE CASES. ALL OF OUR HOSPITALS HAVE BEEN WORKING DILIGENTLY TO REDUCE THE OCCURRENCE OF VENTILATOR-ASSOCIATED PNEUMONIA (VAP), WHICH CAN DEVELOP IN PATIENTS WHO HAVE BEEN ON MECHANICAL VENTILATION FOR 48 HOURS OR MORE. IN 2013, SENTARA WILLIAMSBURG REGIONAL MEDICAL CENTER MARKED NINE CONSECUTIVE YEARS WITH ZERO CASES OF VAP, WHICH NO OTHER HOSPITAL IN THE COUNTRY CAN CLAIM. THE DEPARTMENT OF HEALTH AND HUMAN SERVICES AND THE CRITICAL CARE SOCIETIES COLLABORATIVE HAVE RECOGNIZED WILLIAMSBURG FOR OUTSTANDING ACHIEVEMENT AND LEADERSHIP IN THE ELIMINATION OF VAP. VOLUNTARY HOSPITALS OF AMERICA (VHA), A VOLUNTARY NATIONAL ORGANIZATION FOCUSED ON HEALTH CARE FINANCIAL PERFORMANCE THROUGH CLINICAL EXCELLENCE AND SUPPLY CHAIN MANAGEMENT, ""BLUEPRINTED"" THE PRACTICES AT SENTARA WILLIAMSBURG REGIONAL MEDICAL CENTER AS A MODEL FOR HOSPITALS ACROSS THE COUNTRY. 3. IMPROVING PATIENT SAFETY THROUGH TECHNOLOGY SENTARA HEALTHCARE PROVIDES THE SENTARA ECARE HEALTH NETWORK. THE CLINICAL SYSTEM USES INNOVATIVE TECHNOLOGY TO LINK PATIENT MEDICAL INFORMATION BETWEEN OUR HOSPITALS, PHYSICIAN PRACTICES AND OTHER HEALTH CARE SITES OVER A PROTECTED NETWORK, ENABLING THE SECURE SHARING OF PATIENT INFORMATION, INCREASING PATIENT SAFETY AND REDUCING PREVENTABLE MEDICAL ERRORS. MYCHART, THE COMPONENT OF ECARE THAT ALLOWS PATIENTS TO ACCESS PART OF THEIR MEDICAL RECORDS, WAS PROMOTED TO PATIENTS IN 2011. A PHONE APP WAS CREATED TO PROVIDE EASY ACCESS AS WELL. CURRENTLY, 140,000 PATIENTS ACCESS MYCHART EACH YEAR. 2013 MARKED THE 13TH YEAR THAT WE EMPLOYED OUR EICU REMOTE MONITORING SYSTEM FOR OUR SICKEST HOSPITAL PATIENTS. SENTARA WAS THE FIRST HOSPITAL SYSTEM IN THE COUNTRY TO IMPLEMENT THE EICU SYSTEM, WHICH USES A NETWORK OF CAMERAS, MONITORS, ALERTS, AND TWO-WAY COMMUNICATION LINKS. DOCTORS AND CRITICAL CARE NURSES AT THE EICU COMMAND CENTER MAKE VIRTUAL ROUNDS ON ICU PATIENTS. THIS SENTARA-PIONEERED TECHNOLOGY IS NOW USED TO HELP CARE FOR PATIENTS IN NEARLY 5,000 ICU BEDS NATIONALLY. ANOTHER SAFETY INITIATIVE ADOPTED BY SENTARA IS BEDSIDE MEDICATION VERIFICATION, INCLUDING BAR-CODING TECHNOLOGY. NATIONAL STUDIES HAVE FOUND THAT BEDSIDE VERIFICATION CAN REDUCE HOSPITAL MEDICATION ERRORS BY NEARLY 70 PERCENT. VI. COMMITMENT TO THE COMMUNITY AS A NOT-FOR-PROFIT HEALTHCARE ORGANIZATION, WE CONTINUOUSLY REINVEST IN THE COMMUNITY-BY PURCHASING THE MOST MEDICALLY ADVANCED TECHNOLOGY; BUILDING NEW, STATE-OF-THE-ART HEALTHCARE FACILITIES; TRAINING MEDICAL PROFESSIONALS; AND PROVIDING THE HIGHEST QUALITY HEALTHCARE TO ALL PATIENTS REGARDLESS OF THEIR ABILITY TO PAY. IT'S NOT JUST OUR MISSION, IT'S OUR COMMITMENT TO THE COMMUNITY. MARTHA JEFFERSON HOSPITAL WAS HONORED BY THE CHARLOTTESVILLE REGIONAL CHAMBER OF COMMERCE WITH THE 2012 HOVEY S. DABNEY AWARD FOR CORPORATE CITIZENSHIP. ORGANIZATIONS RECEIVING THIS AWARD ARE KNOWN FOR ENGAGING IN SOUND, SUCCESSFUL BUSINESS PRACTICE AND BEING GOOD PARTNERS WITH OTHER BUSINESSES, INVESTING DIRECTLY IN THE ECONOMIC AND CULTURAL ADVANCEMENT OF THE COMMUNITY, PURSING A POSITIVE WORK ENVIRONMENT, AND INSPIRING BY EXAMPLE. THE FEDERAL DEPARTMENT OF HEALTH AND HUMAN SERVICES AWARDED ROCKINGHAM MEMORIAL HOSPITAL (RMH) WITH A $3.1 MILLION, FIVE-YEAR GRANT IN NOVEMBER 2012 TO HELP FAMILIES AT RISK FROM SUBSTANCE ABUSE. AS A FISCAL AGENT, RMH OVERSEES ADMINISTRATION OF THE GRANT, AND CENTRAL SHENANDOAH VALLEY FAMILY PARTNERSHIP HELPS FAMILIES WITH CHILDREN IN DANGER OF BEING REMOVED FROM THEIR HOMES BECAUSE OF SUBSTANCE ABUSE BY A CAREGIVER. SOLIANT HEALTH NAMED MARTHA JEFFERSON HOSPITAL THE TOP VOTE-GETTER IN THE COUNTRY IN ITS ANNUAL ""MOST BEAUTIFUL HOSPITAL"" SURVEY IN 2012. HERE ARE SOME OF THE OTHER WAYS WE'VE INVESTED IN THE PEOPLE WE SERVE: A. THE SENTARA HEALTH FOUNDATION WE ESTABLISHED THE SENTARA HEALTH FOUNDATION IN 1998 TO IMPROVE HEALTH AND QUALITY OF LIFE THROUGHOUT SOUTHEASTERN VIRGINIA AND NORTH CAROLINA, AND TO DEMONSTRATE OUR NOT-FOR-PROFIT MISSION. THE FOUNDATION HAS TOUCHED THE LIVES OF MANY VIRGINIA RESIDENTS FROM THE EASTERN SHORE TO GREATER HAMPTON ROADS THROUGH GRANTS SUPPORTING COMMUNITY HEALTH PROGRAMS. SPECIFICALLY, IT HAS AWARDED OVER $10 MILLION IN GRANTS, INCLUDING $601,800 IN 2013. PROGRAMS INCLUDE DENTAL CARE, PRENATAL SUPPORT, MEDICATION ASSISTANCE, AND REDUCED-COST PRIMARY CARE. THE FOUNDATION ALSO SPONSORS COMMUNITY EVENTS, SUCH AS THE SUSAN G. KOMEN TIDEWATER RACE FOR THE CURE, THE AMERICAN HEART ASSOCIATION HEART GALA AND HEART WALK AND THE AMERICAN CANCER SOCIETY RELAY FOR LIFE. B. IN SUPPORT OF THE COMMUNITY LED BY A VOLUNTEER COMMUNITY BOARD OF DIRECTORS, SENTARA PROUDLY PROVIDES CARE TO ALL, AND REINVESTS IN THE COMMUNITY IN NUMEROUS WAYS: 1. CONTRIBUTIONS EACH YEAR, WE PROVIDE MILLIONS OF DOLLARS IN BENEFITS TO THE COMMUNITY. IN 2013, SENTARA REINVESTED $299,989,000 INTO OUR COMMUNITIES. SENTARA EARMARKED $20,454,000 FOR HEALTH CARE TEACHING PROGRAMS TO ENSURE A QUALIFIED POOL OF PHYSICIANS AND NURSES. WE ALSO SPENT $5,355,000 TO SUPPORT LOCAL COMMUNITY PROGRAMS THAT PROVIDED HEALTH EVENTS AND HEALTH SCREENINGS TO INDIVIDUALS. WE FUNDED $274,180,000 IN UNCOMPENSATED PATIENT CARE FOR PEOPLE WHO WERE UNINSURED OR UNDERINSURED. 2. MEDICALLY UNDERSERVED SENTARA MEDICAL GROUP'S PHYSICIANS AND MEDICAL STAFF VOLUNTEER THOUSANDS OF HOURS TO EASTERN VIRGINIA MEDICAL SCHOOL (EVMS), FREE CLINICS, COMMUNITY EDUCATION, AND CIVIC AND CHARITABLE PROGRAMS. WE SUPPORT AND OPERATE UNCOMPENSATED CARE CLINICS THROUGHOUT THE REGION, INCLUDING THE SENTARA AMBULATORY CARE CENTER (ACC). THE ACC IS A COLLABORATIVE EFFORT WITH EVMS AND IS LOCATED NEAR SENTARA NORFOLK GENERAL HOSPITAL. IT FEATURES AN APPOINTMENT SIDE, WHICH FUNCTIONS LIKE A DOCTOR'S OFFICE, AND A SAME-DAY ""WALK-IN"" SERVICE SIDE FOR MORE PRESSING AND IMMEDIATE HEALTH CONCERNS."

IN RESPONSE, SENTARA HAS IMPLEMENTED OUR TOBACCO-FREE ENVIRONMENT (TFE) CAMPAIGN. NO ONE IS ALLOWED TO SMOKE, CHEW OR DIP ANYWHERE ON CAMPUS, NOT EVEN IN CARS. THE GOAL IS NOT JUST TO AVOID THE AESTHETIC AND HEALTH ISSUES OF SECOND-HAND SMOKE, BUT TO PUT SENTARA'S MISSION INTO PRACTICE BY HELPING STAFF, PATIENTS, AND VISITORS QUIT THIS HABIT. AS OF 2011, ALL OF OUR FACILITIES ADOPTED THE TOBACCO FREE ENVIRONMENT INITIATIVES. WE HAVE EARNED THE AMERICAN CANCER SOCIETY ""EXCELLENCE IN THE WORKPLACE TOBACCO CONTROL"" AWARD FOR OUR EFFORTS.

IN LINE WITH THIS PHILOSOPHY, THE SYSTEM PERFORMED SUBSTANTIAL DUE DILIGENCE AS TO MARKET COMPARABLES. THE SYSTEM'S COMPENSATION COMMITTEE, WHICH CONSISTS OF SYSTEM BOARD MEMBERS WITHOUT CONFLICTS OF INTERESTS, ENGAGED AN OUTSIDE CONSULTANT, WHO REPORTS TO THE COMPENSATION COMMITTEE, TO CONDUCT A STUDY ASSESSING THE COMPETITIVENESS OF TOTAL COMPENSATION (INCLUDING CASH COMPENSATION, BENEFITS AND PERQUISITES) OF ITS SENIOR EXECUTIVES PRIOR TO MAKING DECISIONS REGARDING ANNUAL BASE SALARY ADJUSTMENTS, APPROVING INCENTIVE AWARDS, OR CONSIDERING PROGRAMMATIC CHANGES. THE STUDY COMPARED THE COMPENSATION OF THE SYSTEM'S SENIOR EXECUTIVES TO COMPENSATION DATA FROM MULTIPLE PUBLISHED SURVEY SOURCES BASED ON THE SENIOR EXECUTIVE'S FUNCTIONAL RESPONSIBILITY. IN CONDUCTING THE STUDY, THE CONSULTANT TARGETED OTHER NOT-FOR-PROFIT HEALTH SYSTEMS OF SIMILAR SIZE BASED ON NET REVENUE AND COMPLEXITY. FOR HEALTH PLAN POSITIONS, HEALTH PLANS WITH SIMILAR PREMIUMS, OR MEMBERS, WERE TARGETED. THE CONSULTANT ALSO CONDUCTS A REVIEW OF THE ORGANIZATION'S PERFORMANCE RELATIVE TO A GROUP OF NOT-FOR-PROFIT HEALTH SYSTEMS OF COMPARABLE SIZE AND SCOPE OF OPERATIONS EVERY YEAR. THE MOST RECENT STUDY COMPARED SENTARA'S PERFORMANCE TO 29 NOT-FOR-PROFIT HEALTHCARE SYSTEMS BASED ON NET REVENUE GROWTH, OPERATING MARGIN, BOND RATING, AND QUALITATIVE PERFORMANCE MEASURES BASED ON RANKINGS FROM SDI'S NATIONAL TOP INTEGRATED HEALTH NETWORKS. OVERALL, THE CONSULTANT DETERMINED THAT SENTARA'S PAY WAS ALIGNED WITH ITS RELATIVE PERFORMANCE. THE COMPENSATION STUDY WAS PRESENTED TO THE SYSTEM'S COMPENSATION COMMITTEE, WHICH MADE ITS COMPENSATION DECISIONS BASED ON A)ITS REVIEW AND ANALYSIS OF THE PERFORMANCE OF BOTH THE ORGANIZATION AND ITS SENIOR EXECUTIVES AND, B) A REASONABLENESS OF COMPENSATION ANALYSIS AND OPINION FROM AN EXTERNAL EXPERT IN THE COMPENSATION OF EXECUTIVES IN THE TAX-EXEMPT HEALTH CARE FIELD. THE COMMITTEE'S BASES FOR ITS DECISIONS WERE DOCUMENTED IN COMMITTEE MINUTES TAKEN DURING THE MEETING AND THEN CIRCULATED FOR REVIEW AND APPROVAL. ALL DECISIONS REGARDING COMPENSATION WERE MADE BY THE COMMITTEE, WHICH CONSISTS OF SYSTEM BOARD MEMBERS WITHOUT CONFLICT OF INTERESTS. THIS PROCESS WAS USED TO ESTABLISH COMPENSATION FOR THE ORGANIZATION'S CHAIRMAN, PRESIDENT, TREASURER AND CERTAIN KEY EMPLOYEES; WHO ALSO SERVE AS CEO, PRESIDENT AND COO, SENIOR VICE PRESIDENT AND CFO, AND SENIOR AND CORPORATE VICE PRESIDENTS OF THE SYSTEM, RESPECTIVELY. THE PROCESS WAS LAST UNDERTAKEN DURING 2013 FOR ALL POSITIONS LISTED."
