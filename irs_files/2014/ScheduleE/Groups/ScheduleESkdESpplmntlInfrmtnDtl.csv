THE CCE IS RECOGNIZED BY ED AS A RELIABLE AUTHORITY AS TO THE QUALITY OF EDUCATION OR TRAINING OFFERED BY AN INSTITUTION. THE COMMISSION EVALUATED THE COLLEGE AND DETERMINED, BASED ON ITS FINANCIAL CRITERIA, THAT THE COLLEGE MET ITS CRITERIA AND WAS FINANCIALLY STABLE FOR PURPOSES OF ACCREDITATION. THE COLLEGE SUCCESSFULLY REAPPLIED FOR TITLE IV ELIGIBILITY EFFECTIVE APRIL 25, 1996. THE COLLEGE HAS SUCCESSFULLY REAPPLIED FOR MEMBERSHIP WITH SACS. CURRENTLY, THE COLLEGE IS DUALLY ACCREDITED BY BOTH SACS (REGIONAL ACCREDITATION) AND CCE (PROGRAMMATIC ACCREDITATION)."
