THE COLLEGE'S SPENDING AND INVESTMENT POLICIES WORK TOGETHER TO ACHIEVE THIS OBJECTIVE. THE INVESTMENT POLICY ESTABLISHES AN ACHIEVABLE RETURN OBJECTIVE THROUGH DIVERSIFICATION OF ASSET CLASSES. THE CURRENT LONG-TERM RETURN OBJECTIVE IS TO ACHIEVE A TOTAL RETURN (INCOME PLUS CAPITAL CHANGE, NET OF ALL INVESTMENT EXPENSES) EQUAL TO OR EXCEEDING ANY APPROVED DISTRIBUTION RATE, PLUS THE INFLATION RATE AS MEASURED BY THE CONSUMER PRICE INDEX. ACTUAL RETURNS IN ANY GIVEN YEAR MAY VARY FROM THIS AMOUNT. TO SATISFY ITS LONG-TERM RATE-OF-RETURN OBJECTIVES, THE COLLEGE RELIES ON A TOTAL RETURN STRATEGY IN WHICH INVESTMENT RETURNS ARE ACHIEVED THROUGH BOTH CAPITAL APPRECIATION (REALIZED AND UNREALIZED) AND CURRENT YIELD (INTEREST AND DIVIDENDS). THE COLLEGE TARGETS A DIVERSIFIED ASSET ALLOCATION THAT PLACES AN EMPHASIS ON U.S. EQUITY-BASED INVESTMENTS AND U.S. INTERMEDIATE-TERM DEBT SECURITIES TO ACHIEVE ITS LONG-TERM RETURN OBJECTIVES WITHIN PRUDENT RISK PARAMETERS. THE SPENDING POLICY CALCULATES THE AMOUNT OF MONEY ANNUALLY DISTRIBUTED FROM THE COLLEGE'S VARIOUS ENDOWED FUNDS, FOR SCHOLARSHIPS, PROGRAMS AND ADMINISTRATION. THE COLLEGE UTILIZES A TOTAL RETURN SPENDING RATE POLICY WHICH LIMITS THE AMOUNT OF INVESTMENT RETURN USED TO SUPPORT CURRENT OPERATIONS. THE LIMIT IS DETERMINED BY THE COLLEGE'S CURRENT BUDGETED AMOUNT TO BE SPENT FOR THE YEAR. UNDER THE TOTAL SPENDING POLICY, THE COLLEGE UTILIZED 467,000 AND 424,000 IN 2014 AND 2013, RESPECTIVELY. THIS EQUATES TO APPROXIMATELY 1.85% IN 2014 AND 1.90% IN 2013 OF THE FAIR VALUE OF THE ENDOWMENT FUNDS. ACCORDINGLY, OVER THE LONG TERM, THE COLLEGE EXPECTS ITS CURRENT SPENDING POLICY TO ALLOW ITS ENDOWMENT ASSETS TO GROW AT AN AVERAGE RATE OF 3% ANNUALLY.

Under ASC 740, CTP is required to report information regarding its exposure to various tax positions taken by the organization and requires a two-step process that separates recognition from measurement. The first step is determining whether a tax position has met the recognition threshold; the second step is measuring a tax position that meets the recognition threshold. Management believes that the organization has adequately addressed all tax positions and that there are no unrecorded tax liabilities.CTP has received notification from the Internal Revenue Service and the State of California that it qualifies for tax-exempt status under Section 501(c)(3) of the Internal Revenue Code and Section 23701d of the California Revenue and Taxation Code. This exemption is subject to periodic review by the federal and state taxing authorities and management is confident that the organization continues to satisfy all federal and state statutes in order to qualify for continued tax exemption status. CTP may periodically receive unrelated business income requiring the organization to file separate tax returns under federal and state statutes. Under such conditions, CTP calculates and accrues the applicable taxes payable."

In addition to the main study and research collections, the Hillsdale College Mossey Library contains a number of rare and special holdings, including the Ludwig von Mises Library and the Richardson Heritage Room early and rare editions. Ludwig von Mises, the early twentieth century Austrian economist and author of such seminar works as ""The Theory of Money and Credit"" and ""Human Action,"" chose Hillsdale College to be the recipient of his personal library, because of the school's commitment to teach the principles of freedom. This important collection of books, pamphlets, and papers related to free-market economics is housed in the Ludwig von Mises Room in the Mossey Library and is available to Hillsdale faculty and students for research. THE RICHARDSON HERITAGE ROOM contains a collection of rare- and first-edition books that relate to our country's founding and early American history. A bibliography of the collection is available at www.hillsdale.edu LIBERTY WALK -the mission of Hillsdale College, which has guided the school since its 1844 founding, is to preserve the blessings of civil and religious liberty through ""the diffusion of learning."" The Liberty Walk project is a marvelous example of teaching and learning through objects of art. This collection of over-life-size statues provides visible testimony to the lives of historic defenders of freedom. It calls the citizen observer to vigilance in defending and upholding the principles of freedom. It stands as a constant reminder of the previous nature of freedom and the strength and sacrifice required to preserve it. To date, the collection includes seven statues: the Alpha Kappa Phi Civil War Soldiers' Monument, 1895; George Washington, 2003; Winston Churchill, 2004; Margaret Thatcher, 2008; Thomas Jefferson, 2009; Abraham Lincoln, 2009; and Ronald Reagan, 2011.

ASC 740 provides that a tax benefit from an uncertain tax position may be recognized when it is more likely than not that the position will be sustained upon examination, including resolutions of any related appeals or litigation processes, based on technical merits. Income tax positions must be a more likely-than-not recognition threshold at the effective date to be recognized upon the adoption of ASC 740 and in subsequent periods.

A tax position is recognized as a benefit only if it is ""more likely than not"" that the tax position would be sustained in a tax examination, with a tax examination being presumed to occur. The amount recognized is the largest amount of tax benefit that is greater than 50% likely of being realized on examination. For tax positions not meeting the ""more likely than not"" test, no tax benefit is recorded. The College recognizes interest and penalties related to unrecognized tax benefits in interest and income tax expense, respectively. The College has no amounts accrued for interest or penalties as of May 31, 2014. The College does not expect the total amount of unrecognized tax benefits to significantly change in the next 12 months. The College has applied this criterion to all tax positions for which the statute of limitations remains open. The tax years open to examination by tax authorities under the statute of limitations include fiscal 2011 through 2013. The College has determined that its tax provision satisfies the more likely than not criterion, and that no provision for income taxes is required at May 31, 2014."

This support includes funds for scholarships and for specific academic programs. The University has adopted an endowment spending policy designed to provide a predictable flow of funds to operations. The policy is intended to balance current spending needs and preserve the endowment's future purchasing power. The University applies a 4.5% spending rate to a three-year moving average of endowment investment funds. The Board of Regents sets the spending rate. The purpose of using a moving average is to smooth out any wide fluctuations in the market value. Endowment earnings in excess of the spending rate are added back to the principal of the endowment investments. In years when yield exceeds the amount appropriated under the spending policy the excess is returned to principal as appreciation. When annual yield is insufficient to support spending appropriations, the balance is provided from accumulated appreciation. Special allocations are made for certain purposes in addition to the spending rate, as approved by the University's Board of Regents, annually."

This standard required the University to determine whether a tax position is more likely than not to be sustained upon examination by the applicable taxing authority, including resolution of any related appeals or litigation processes, based on the technical merits of the position. The University has processes presently in place to ensure the maintenance of its tax-exempt status; to identify and report unrelated income; determine its filing and tax obligations in jurisdictions for which it has nexus; and to review other matters that may be considered tax positions. The tax years ending 2011, 2012, 2013, and 2014 remain open to audit for both federal and state purposes.

The College has also determined that the open tax years are generally three years for federal and four years for California tax purposes. Thus, the general open tax years are the years ended June 30, 2011 through June 30, 2014 for federal purposes and the years ended June 30, 2010 through June 30, 2014 for California purposes. For both federal and California, there is an unrelated business income net operating loss carryover of approximately $1,343,371 and $1,260,294 as of June 30, 2013 and June 30, 2012, to utilize for the tax years ended June 30, 2014 and June 30, 2013, respectively. The carryover extends the statute of limitations and thus the open tax years for purposes of the net operating loss only are the years ended June 30, 2005 through June 30, 2007 and June 30, 2009 to June 30, 2010 for federal purposes and the years ended June 30, 2005 through June 30, 2007 and June 30, 2009 for California purposes. The net operating loss carryover will begin to expire June 30, 2025 for federal purposes and June 30, 2015 for California purposes. The College applies ASC 740-10-25, Accounting for Uncertainty in Income Taxes, to all tax positions for which the statute of limitations remained open and determined there were no material unrecognized tax benefits as of the year ended June 30, 2014 and the year ended June 30, 2013, nor are any changes anticipated in the twelve months following June 30, 2014. A net operating loss can only be reflected as a benefit (deferred tax asset) on the statement on financial position when it is likely that the loss would be utilized against taxable income in another tax year. Since there is not presently a likelihood of taxable income in another tax year, the College does not have a deferred tax asset on the statement of financial position and there have been no related tax penalties or interest, which would be classified as tax expense in the statement of activities."

Under the requirements of FIN 48, tax-exempt organizations could now be required to record an obligation as the result of a tax position they have historically taken or various tax exposure items. Prior to FIN 48, the determination of when to record a liability for tax exposure was based on whether a liability was considered probable and reasonably estimable in accordance with SFAS No.5, Accounting for Contingencies.

SMITH COLLEGE BEGAN COLLECTING ORIGINAL WORKS OF ART IN 1879, ONLY FOUR YEARS AFTER IT ENROLLED ITS FIRST CLASS. INITIALLY, PRESIDENT L. CLARK SEELYE BOUGHT WORKS OF CONTEMPORARY AMERICAN ART, OFTEN DIRECTLY FROM THE ARTISTS THEMSELVES, BELIEVING THAT STUDENTS SHOULD BE FAMILIAR WITH THE ART OF THEIR OWN TIME. AMERICAN ART HAS REMAINED ONE OF THE COLLECTIONS' CORE STRENGTHS. BY THE EARLY TWENTIETH CENTURY, ALFRED VANCE CHURCHILL, THE MUSEUM'S FIRST DIRECTOR, HAD EXPANDED THE COLLECTING SPHERE TO INCLUDE EUROPEAN ART. AT THE REQUEST OF THE COLLEGE'S TRUSTEES, CHURCHILL FORMALIZED THE MUSEUM'S COLLECTING GUIDELINES IN 1920. THESE INVOLVED A ""CONCENTRATION PLAN"" THAT FOCUSED ON THE MODERN ERA, WHICH HE DEFINED AS BEGINNING WITH THE FRENCH REVOLUTION. HIS PLAN EMPHASIZED THE IMPORTANCE OF COLLECTING WORKS OF HIGH QUALITY, WHILE RECOGNIZING THE INSTRUCTIONAL VALUE OF PREPARATORY STUDIES AND UNFINISHED WORKS THAT SHOW AN ARTIST'S WORKING METHOD. GUIDED BY THIS PLAN, THE MUSEUM ASSEMBLED IMPORTANT HOLDINGS OF FRENCH ART OF THE NINETEENTH CENTURY, INCLUDING SUPERB WORKS BY EDGAR DEGAS, JEAN-BAPTISTE-CAMILLE COROT, GUSTAVE COURBET, PAUL CEZANNE, CLAUDE MONET AND OTHERS. THE PLAN WAS REVISITED IN THE EARLY 1990S, AND ACQUIRING WORKS BY WOMEN ARTISTS AND ARTISTS OF COLOR BECAME A COLLECTING PRIORITY. IN THE LAST DECADE, THE COLLECTING PLAN HAS SIGNIFICANTLY EXPANDED TO INCLUDE AFRICAN, ISLAMIC, AND, PARTICULARLY, ASIAN ART TO SUPPORT THE COLLEGE'S GLOBAL CURRICULUM. THE NEWEST ACQUISITIONS TO THE MUSEUM'S COLLECTION INCLUDE WORKS BY JAUNE QUICK-TO-SEE SMITH, ANA MENDIETA, MISHIMA KIMIYO, TADDEO DI BARTOLO, ROBERT MOTHERWELL AND BETYE SAAR.

The permanent endowment is not reduced by losses on the investments, except to the extent required by the donor, or by appropriations from the endowment fund. The accumulated portion of a donor-restricted fund that is not permanently restricted is classified as temporarily restricted net assets until appropriated for expenditure by the College in a manner consistent with the standard of prudence prescribed by Ohio's enacted version of UPMIFA.

As such, the College is generally not subject to federal or state income taxes except for amounts derived from unrelated business activities as defined by the IRC. The College adopted the accounting standard on accounting for uncertainty in income taxes, which addresses the determination of whether tax benefits claimed or expected to be claimed on a tax return should be recorded in the financial statements. Under this guidance, the College may recognize the tax benefit from an uncertain tax position only if it is more likely than not that the tax position will be sustained on examination by taxing authorities, based on the technical merits of the position. Examples of tax positions include the tax-exempt status of the College, the continued tax-exempt status of bonds issued by the College, and various positions related to the potential sources of unrelated business taxable income (UBIT). The tax benefits recognized in the financial statements from such a position are measured based on the largest benefit that has a greater than 50 percent likelihood of being realized upon ultimate settlement. The guidance on accounting for uncertainty in income taxes also addresses de-recognition, classification, interest and penalties on income taxes, and accounting in interim periods. At June 30, 2014 there were no unrecognized tax benefits identified or recorded as liabilities. With few exceptions, the College is no longer subject to examinations by tax authorities for fiscal years prior to 2011."

AS A PREMIER UNIVERSITY MUSEUM AND RESEARCH INSTITUTION, THE SPECIMENS AND THEIR RELATED DATA ARE AVAILABLE TO RESEARCHERS OF THE SCIENTIFIC AND MUSEUM COMMUNITY. USE OF THE COLLECTIONS IN STUDENT RESEARCH, WHETHER AS THESIS WORK OR INDEPENDENT STUDY, IS ALSO ENCOURAGED. FISHER MUSEUM HARVARD FOREST: THE FISHER MUSEUM'S MAIN EXHIBIT DISPLAYS TWENTY-THREE INTERNATIONALLY ACCLAIMED MODELS (DIORAMAS) PORTRAYING THE HISTORY, CONSERVATION AND MANAGEMENT OF CENTRAL NEW ENGLAND FORESTS. OTHER EXHIBITS AT THE MUSEUM REPRESENT THE RANGE OF HARVARD FOREST'S RESEARCH. HARVARD UNIVERSITY HERBARIA (WITHIN MUSEUM OF NATURAL HISTORY): THE HARVARD UNIVERSITY HERBARIA ARE AMONG SOME SEVERAL THOUSAND COLLECTIONS OF PRESSED, DRIED PLANT SPECIMENS WORLDWIDE THAT ARE USED BY RESEARCHERS TO FURTHER OUR UNDERSTANDING OF THE PLANT WORLD. SOME OF THE EARLIEST HERBARIA WERE FOUNDED IN EUROPE IN THE EARLY 1600'S, DURING THE DAYS OF EXPLORATION, WHEN KNOWLEDGE OF THE EARTH'S FLORA WAS GROWING AT SUCH A RAPID PACE THAT BOTANICAL GARDENS COULD NO LONGER MAINTAIN LIVING EXAMPLES OF EVERY KNOWN SPECIES. WHILE HERBARIUM COLLECTIONS OF ALL SIZES EXIST TODAY, THERE ARE FEWER THAN 75 HERBARIA WORLDWIDE WITH MORE THAN ONE MILLION SPECIMENS. HERBARIUM COLLECTIONS HAVE BEEN BUILT UP OVER THE YEARS BY THE EFFORTS OF NUMEROUS BOTANISTS AND PLANT COLLECTORS WHO HAVE SEARCHED FROM REMOTE AND ISOLATED JUNGLES TO INNER CITY WASTE LOTS AND RAILROAD TRACKS TO DOCUMENT THE DIVERSITY AND DISTRIBUTION OF THE EARTH'S FLORA. REPRESENTATIVES OF MOST KNOWN SPECIES OF PLANTS CAN BE FOUND IN HERBARIA TODAY, CAREFULLY MOUNTED ON SHEETS OF ARCHIVAL QUALITY PAPER, LABELED WITH IMPORTANT INFORMATION ABOUT THEM, AND STORED ON SHELVES IN CABINETS. IN ESSENCE, A HERBARIUM IS ANALOGOUS TO A LIBRARY OF CAREFULLY PRESERVED PLANTS WHERE THE SPECIMENS THEMSELVES AND THE LABELS ASSOCIATED WITH THEM PROVIDE A WEALTH OF INFORMATION ONCE THEY HAVE BEEN ""READ"" AND STUDIED BY SCIENTISTS. THE SPECIMENS ARE THE KEY TO UNDERSTANDING PLANT RELATIONSHIPS,GEOGRAPHIC DISTRIBUTIONS, ECONOMIC USEFULNESS, EVEN THEIR MOLECULAR MAKEUP. AS WE LOSE NATURAL HABITATS THE WORLD OVER, HERBARIA INCREASINGLY SERVE AS A RECORD OF THE RECENT HISTORY OF PLANT LIFE, AND AS A REPOSITORY OF PRECIOUS GENETIC INFORMATION. HERBARIA HOLD THE TOOLS FOR OUR UNDERSTANDING OF THE PLANT WORLD. MINERALOGICAL AND GEOLOGICAL MUSEUM (WITHIN MUSEUM OF NATURAL HISTORY): THE HARVARD MINERAL COLLECTION RANKS AMONG THE WORLD'S FINEST DUE TO ITS VERY BROAD REPRESENTATION, WEALTH OF RARE SPECIES, LARGE NUMBER OF SPECIMENS DESCRIBED IN THE SCIENTIFIC LITERATURE, AND THE QUALITY OF ITS DISPLAY SPECIMENS. A RICH SYSTEMATIC MINERAL COLLECTION AND DISPLAYS OF GEMSTONES ARE THE PRINCIPAL EXHIBITS IN THE MINERAL GALLERY. THE MUSEUM IS COMMITTED TO THE DEVELOPMENT AND PRESERVATION OF WORLD-CLASS COLLECTIONS OF MINERALS, GEMS, ROCKS, ORES, AND METEORITES FOR RESEARCH, EDUCATION, AND PUBLIC DISPLAY. ITS EARLIEST COLLECTIONS DATE BACK TO THE LATE 18TH CENTURY. THE MUSEUM CATERS TO THE NEEDS OF STUDENTS AND FACULTY AT HARVARD UNIVERSITY AS WELL AS THE GEOLOGICAL COMMUNITY AT LARGE BY SERVING AS A UNIQUELY RICH RESOURCE OF MATERIALS AND INFORMATION. PEABODY MUSEUM OF ARCHAEOLOGY AND ETHNOLOGY: THE PEABODY MUSEUM OF ARCHAEOLOGY AND ETHNOLOGY IS STEWARD TO ONE OF THE OLDEST AND LARGEST COLLECTIONS OF CULTURAL OBJECTS IN THE WESTERN HEMISPHERE. SINCE THE LATE NINETEENTH CENTURY, THE MUSEUM HAS PLAYED AN ACTIVE PART IN THE HISTORY OF AMERICAN ANTHROPOLOGY AND IN THE EVOLVING RELATIONSHIP BETWEEN MUSEUMS AND NATIVE PEOPLES. AS A UNIVERSITY MUSEUM SITUATED IN AN ACADEMIC AND REGIONAL COMMUNITY CENTRAL TO THE DEVELOPMENT AND THE STUDY OF AMERICAN CIVIC CULTURE, THE PEABODY STRIVES TO MAKE COLLECTIONS WIDELY ACCESSIBLE AND ENGAGE ISSUES OF CONCERN TO DIVERSE AUDIENCES. TODAY, THE PEABODY HOUSES MORE THAN SIX MILLION INDIVIDUAL OBJECTS, 500,000 PHOTOGRAPHIC IMAGES, AND SUBSTANTIAL ARCHIVAL RECORDS. STRONGEST IN THE CULTURES OF NORTH, CENTRAL, AND SOUTH AMERICA, AND THE PACIFIC ISLANDS, THE PEABODY IS ALSO CARETAKER TO IMPORTANT COLLECTIONS FROM AFRICA, EUROPE, AND ASIA. COLLECTION TYPES INCLUDE ARCHAEOLOGY; ETHNOGRAPHY; OSTEOLOGY; AND PAINTING, DRAWING, AND PRINTS. SEMITIC MUSEUM: THE SEMITIC MUSEUM IS HOME TO THE UNIVERSITY'S COLLECTIONS OF NEAR EASTERN ARCHAEOLOGICAL ARTIFACTS. THESE ARTIFACTS COMPRISE OVER 40,000 ITEMS, INCLUDING POTTERY, CYLINDER SEALS, SCULPTURE, COINS AND CUNEIFORM TABLETS. MANY ARE FROM MUSEUM-SPONSORED EXCAVATIONS IN ISRAEL, JORDAN, IRAQ, EGYPT, CYPRUS, AND TUNISIA. THE MUSEUM IS DEDICATED TO THE USE OF THESE COLLECTIONS FOR THE TEACHING, RESEARCH, AND PUBLICATION OF NEAR EASTERN ARCHAEOLOGY, HISTORY, AND CULTURE. WARREN ANATOMICAL MUSEUM: THE WARREN ANATOMICAL MUSEUM'S PRESENT COLLECTION CONTAINS APPROXIMATELY 15,000 ARTIFACTS AND CASES INCLUDING: ANATOMICAL AND PATHOLOGICAL PREPARATIONS; VARIOUS WAX, PAPER MACHE, AND DRY PREPARATION ANATOMICAL MODELS; PHOTOGRAPHS, PRINTS, PAINTINGS, AND DRAWINGS; MEDICAL INSTRUMENTS AND MACHINES; AND OTHER MEDICAL MEMORABILIA.

The University's board adopted a spending policy of 4.75% with a view toward balancing the need for expendable funds for University programs against the need to preserve the endowment against inflation. In order to achieve the objective of mainlining purchasing power, the endowment's annual rate of return must equal the annual distribution, plus inflation, plus management, custodial, and administrative fees. The distribution to the University is based on a 12 quarter moving average of the market value. This spending method protects the University's distribution from the increased volatility in the markets. Distributions are provided to students for scholarships, various colleges, and programs in accordance with donor designations. The distributions are reflected in the net assets of the endowment fund. However, there is not a transfer of actual cash from the endowment fund without requiring a liquidation of cash, this treatment allows the investments of the endowment to grow."

The Law School has received a favorable determination letter from the Internal Revenue Service indicating that they qualify for tax-exempt status. The Law School is also exempt from California income taxes under the related State provisions. Management believes that the Law School will continue to be exempt from taxes. As of July 1, 2010, the Law School adopted accounting guidance related to uncertain tax positions. In accordance with this guidance, management is required to determine whether a tax position of the Law School is more likely than not to be sustained upon examination by the applicable taxing authority, including resolution of any related appeals or litigation processes, based on the technical merits of the position. The tax benefit to be recognized is measured as the largest amount of benefit that is greater than fifty percent likely of being realized upon ultimate settlement. Derecognition of a tax benefit previously recognized could result in the Law School recording a tax liability that would reduce net assets. The Law School has reviewed all significant tax positions for material tax jurisdictions including the U.S. federal and California state tax jurisdictions for which the statute of limitations remained open which is generally three years for federal and state taxes and four years for California. The open tax years are 2010 through 2014 for federal and 2009 through 2014 for California tax years and determined there were no material unrecognized tax benefits. However, the statue can be extended if there was a failure to file a necessary tax return. In addition, there have been no material changes in unrecognized benefits since July 1, 2013, nor are any anticipated in the 12 months following June 30, 2014. However, management's conclusions regarding this policy may be subject to review and adjustment at a later date based on factors including, but not limited to, on-going analyses of and changes to tax laws, regulations and interpretations thereof. There have been no related tax penalties or interest, which would be classified as operating or interest expense in the statement of operations."

ENDOWMENT FUNDS INCLUDE INVESTED GIFTS AND CASH. AS REQUIRED BY GENERALLY ACCEPTED ACCOUNTING PRINCIPLES, THE COLLEGE CLASSIFIES AS PERMANENTLY RESTRICTED NET ASSETS (A) THE ORGINAL VALUE OF GIFTS DONATED TO THE PERMANENT ENDOWMENT, (B) THE ORIGINAL VALUE OF SUBSEQUENT GIFTS TO THE PERMANENT ENDOWMENT, AND (C) ACCUMULATIONS TO THE PERMANENT ENDOWMENT MADE IN ACCORDANCE WITH THE DIRECTION OF THE APPLICABLE DONOR GIFT INSTRUMENT AT THE TIME THE ACCUMULATION IS ADDED TO THE FUND.

IN ACCORDANCE WITH THE UNIFORM PRUDENT MANAGEMENT OF INSTITUTIONAL FUNDS ACT, THE COLLEGE MAY CONSIDER THE FOLLOWING FACTORS IN MAKING A DETERMINATION TO APPROPRIATE OR ACCUMULATE DONOR-RESTRICTED ENDOWMENT FUND; GENERAL ECONOMIC CONDITIONS; THE POSSIBLE EFFECT OF INFLATION AND DELATION; THE EXPECTED TOTAL RETURN FROM INCOME AND THE APPRECIATION OF INVESTMENTS; OTHER RESOURCES OF THE ORGANIZATION; AND THE INVESTMENT POLICIES OF THE ORGANIZATION.

ACTUAL RETURNS IN ANY GIVEN YEAR MAY VARY FROM THIS AMOUNT. TO SATISFY ITS LONG-TERM RATE-OF-RETURN OBJECTIVES, THE COLLEGE RELIES ON A TOTAL RETURN STRATEGY IN WHICH INVESTMENT RETURNS ARE ACHIEVED THROUGH BOTH CAPITAL APPRECIATION (REALIZED AND UNREALIZED) AND CURRENT YIELD (INTEREST AND DIVIDENDS).

Examples of tax positions include the tax-exempt status of the School and various positions related to the potential sources of unrelated business taxable income. The tax benefits recognized in the financial statements from such a position, if any, are measured based on the largest benefit that has a greater than 50 percent likelihood of being realized upon ultimate settlement. At August 31, 2014, there were no unrecognized tax benefits identified or recorded as liabilities. The School files Form 990 in the U.S. federal jurisdiction. The School is no longer subject to examination by the Internal Revenue Service for fiscal years before 2011."

The College has identified its tax status as a tax exempt entity as its only significant tax position and has determined that such tax position does not result in an uncertainty requiring recognition. The College is not currently under examination by any taxing jurisdiction. The College's federal and state income tax returns are generally open for examination for the three past years."

This support is manifest in the art collections currently on display throughout the CGU campus. Through acquisition and gifts in kind, CGU has been a champion of creative expression through the visual arts. CGU has four distinct collections in its possession and on display. These include: the Claremont Graduate University Collection of work donated or accessioned; Claremont Graduate University President's Award (annually purchased from graduating MFA students in the CGU Art Department); The Capital Group Collection on loan to CGU through the Capital Group Foundation; and CGU MFA student artwork (loaned by students for display to the CGU and CUC community). Original works of art exhibited on campus can inspire students, faculty and staff to a greater appreciation of beauty, the creative process and diversity of critical thought that bridges academic disciplines. The borrowing and display of original works of art must be implemented in a manner that ensures the effective educational and artistic use of the art collections in our keeping. Works must not become mere decoration, lost in the shuffle, forgotten or cast aside. It is of utmost concern that we care for the works of art and use them to some positive educational purpose.

SCHEDULE D, PART III, LINE 4 THE JOHN CARTER BROWN LIBRARY CONTAINS an internationally renowned, constantly growing collection of primary historical sources pertaining to the Americas, both North and South, before ca. 1825. The John Carter Brown Library collection of 50,000 rare books (printed before ca. 1825), manuscripts, and 16,000 reference books and secondary sources (printed after ca. 1825) is distinguished in many subject areas. Most well-known, perhaps, are the Library's extensive holdings in the literature of European exploration and travel in the Western Hemisphere, from the first Latin edition of the Columbus letter of 1493, through nearly all of the contemporary narratives of Spanish, Portuguese, French, Dutch, and English discovery, exploration, and settlement. The holdings of the library are available to scholars engaged in productive research for whom access to the collection is essential for the advancement of their work. The Brown University Library, in support of the University's educational and research mission, is the local repository for and the principal gateway to current information and the scholarly record. The Brown University Library is comprised of the John D. Rockefeller, Jr. Library; the Sciences Library; the Orwig Music Library; the John Hay Library; and the Annmary Brown Memorial. The John D. Rockefeller, Jr. Library is the primary teaching and research library for the humanities, social sciences, and fine arts. The Sciences Library holds materials that support study and research in the fields of Medicine, Psychology, Neural Science, Environmental Science, Biology, Chemistry, Geology, Physics, Engineering, Computer Science, and Pure and Applied Mathematics, and provides a wide range of services to the staff, students and faculty. The Orwig Music Library houses the general music collection on campus: music books, scores, periodicals, sound recordings, video recordings, and microforms. The collection supports the curriculum of the Music Department and provides material for general use by the Brown community. The John Hay Library houses diverse collections spanning many subjects and time periods, with particularly strong collections in American literature and history, popular culture, military history and iconography, history of science and the art and history of the book. THE ANNMARY BROWN MEMORIAL HOUSES EXHIBITS OF EUROPEAN AND AMERICAN PAINTINGS FROM THE 17TH THROUGH THE 20TH CENTURIES, THE CYRIL AND HARRIET MAZANSKY BRITISH SWORD COLLECTION, AS WELL AS PERSONAL MEMENTOS OF ITS FOUNDER, GENERAL RUSH C.

ASC 740-10 clarifies the accounting for uncertainty in tax positions taken or expected to be taken in a tax return, including issues relating to financial statements recognition and measurement. This section provides that the tax effects from an uncertain tax position can be recognized in the financial statements only if the position is ""more-likely-than-not"" to be sustained if the position were to be challenged by a taxing authority. The assessment of the tax position is based solely on the technical merits of the position, without regard to the likelihood that the tax position may be challenged. The College is exempt from federal income taxation by virtue of being an organization described in Section 501(c)(3) of the Internal Revenue Code. Nevertheless, the College may be subject to tax on income unrelated to its exempt purpose, unless that income is otherwise excluded by the Code.

THE MAJORITY OF THE ENDOWMENT FUNDS ARE DESIGNATED FOR STUDENT AWARDS, BUT THERE ARE A FEW IN PLACE WITH THE INTENT TO HELP SUPPORT A PARTICULAR PROGRAM. THE UNIVERSITY'S ENDOWMENT CONSISTS OF APPROXIMATELY 100 INDIVIDUAL FUNDS ESTABLISHED FOR A VARIETY OF PURPOSES. ITS ENDOWMENT INCLUDES BOTH DONOR-RESTRICTED ENDOWMENT FUNDS AND FUNDS DESIGNATED BY THE BOARD OF TRUSTEES TO FUNCTION AS ENDOWMENTS. AS REQUIRED BY ACCOUNTING PRINCIPLES GENERALLY ACCEPTED IN THE UNITED STATES OF AMERICA, NET ASSETS ASSOCIATED WITH ENDOWMENT FUNDS, INCLUDING FUNDS DESIGNATED BY THE BOARD OF TRUSTEES TO FUNCTION AS ENDOWMENTS, ARE CLASSIFIED AND REPORTED BASED ON THE EXISTENCE OR ABSENCE OF DONOR-IMPOSED RESTRICTIONS. THE BOARD OF TRUSTEES OF THE UNIVERSITY HAS INTERPRETED PENNSYLVANIA LAW AS REQUIRING THE PRESERVATION OF THE FAIR VALUE OF THE ORIGINAL GIFT AS OF THE GIFT DATE OF THE DONOR-RESTRICTED ENDOWMENT FUNDS ABSENT EXPLICIT DONOR STIPULATIONS TO THE CONTRARY. AS A RESULT OF THIS INTERPRETATION, THE UNIVERSITY CLASSIFIES AS PERMANENTLY RESTRICTED NET ASSETS (A) THE ORIGINAL VALUE OF GIFTS DONATED TO THE PERMANENT ENDOWMENT, (B) THE ORIGINAL VALUE OF SUBSEQUENT GIFTS TO THE PERMANENT ENDOWMENT, AND (C) ACCUMULATIONS TO THE PERMANENT ENDOWMENT MADE IN ACCORDANCE WITH THE DIRECTION OF THE APPLICABLE DONOR GIFT INSTRUMENT AT THE TIME THE ACCUMULATION IS ADDED TO THE FUND. THE REMAINING PORTION OF THE DONOR-RESTRICTED ENDOWMENT FUND THAT IS NOT CLASSIFIED IN PERMANENTLY RESTRICTED NET ASSETS IS CLASSIFIED AS EITHER TEMPORARILY RESTRICTED OR UNRESTRICTED NET ASSETS BASED ON THE EXISTENCE OF DONOR RESTRICTIONS OR BY LAW. THE UNIVERSITY CONSIDERS THE FOLLOWING FACTORS IN MAKING A DETERMINATION TO APPROPRIATE OR ACCUMULATE DONOR-RESTRICTED ENDOWMENT FUNDS: 1. THE DURATION AND PRESERVATION OF THE FUND 2. THE PURPOSES OF THE UNIVERSITY AND THE DONOR-RESTRICTED ENDOWMENT FUND 3. GENERAL ECONOMIC CONDITIONS 4. THE POSSIBLE EFFECT OF INFLATION AND DEFLATION 5. THE EXPECTED TOTAL RETURN FROM INCOME AND THE APPRECIATION OF INVESTMENTS 6. OTHER RESOURCES OF THE UNIVERSITY 7. THE INVESTMENT POLICIES OF THE UNIVERSITY THE UNIVERSITY HAS ADOPTED INVESTMENT AND SPENDING POLICIES FOR ENDOWMENT ASSETS THAT ATTEMPT TO PROVIDE A PREDICTABLE STREAM OF FUNDING TO PROGRAMS SUPPORTED BY ITS ENDOWMENT WHILE SEEKING TO MAINTAIN THE PURCHASING POWER OF THE ENDOWMENT ASSETS. ENDOWMENT ASSETS INCLUDE THOSE ASSETS OF DONOR-RESTRICTED FUNDS THAT THE UNIVERSITY MUST HOLD IN PERPETUITY OR FOR A DONOR-SPECIFIED PERIOD(S) AS WELL AS BOARD-DESIGNATED FUNDS. UNDER THIS POLICY, AS APPROVED BY THE BOARD OF TRUSTEES, THE ENDOWMENT ASSETS ARE INVESTED IN A MANNER THAT IS INTENDED TO PRODUCE RESULTS THAT EXCEED THE PRICE AND YIELD RESULTS OF THE S&P 500 INDEX WHILE ASSUMING A MODERATE LEVEL OF INVESTMENT RISK. THE UNIVERSITY EXPECTS ITS ENDOWMENT FUNDS, OVER TIME, TO PROVIDE AN AVERAGE RATE OF RETURN OF APPROXIMATELY 9 PERCENT ANNUALLY. ACTUAL RETURNS IN ANY GIVEN YEAR MAY VARY FROM THIS AMOUNT. TO SATISFY ITS LONG-TERM RATE-OF-RETURN OBJECTIVES, THE UNIVERSITY RELIES ON A TOTAL RETURN STRATEGY IN WHICH INVESTMENT RETURNS ARE ACHIEVED THROUGH BOTH CAPITAL APPRECIATION (REALIZED AND UNREALIZED) AND CURRENT YIELD (INTEREST AND DIVIDENDS). THE UNIVERSITY TARGETS A DIVERSIFIED ASSET ALLOCATION THAT PLACES A GREATER EMPHASIS ON EQUITY-BASED INVESTMENTS TO ACHIEVE ITS LONG-TERM RETURN OBJECTIVES WITHIN PRUDENT RISK CONSTRAINTS. THE UNIVERSITY HAS A POLICY OF APPROPRIATING FOR DISTRIBUTION EACH YEAR 3.5 TO 5 PERCENT OF ITS ENDOWMENT FUNDS' AVERAGE FAIR VALUE OVER THE PRIOR 12 QUARTERS THROUGH THE CALENDAR YEAR-END PROCEEDING THE FISCAL YEAR IN WHICH THE DISTRIBUTION IS PLANNED. IN ESTABLISHING THIS POLICY, THE UNIVERSITY CONSIDERED THE LONG-TERM EXPECTED RETURN ON ITS ENDOWMENT. ACCORDINGLY, OVER THE LONG TERM, THE UNIVERSITY EXPECTS THE CURRENT SPENDING POLICY TO ALLOW ITS ENDOWMENT TO GROW AT AN AVERAGE OF 4 PERCENT ANNUALLY. THIS IS CONSISTENT WITH THE UNIVERSITY'S OBJECTIVE TO MAINTAIN THE PURCHASING POWER OF THE ENDOWMENT ASSETS HELD IN PERPETUITY OR FOR A SPECIFIED TERM AS WELL AS TO PROVIDE ADDITIONAL REAL GROWTH THROUGH NEW GIFTS AND INVESTMENT RETURN."

Measurement of the tax uncertainty occurs if the recognition threshold has not been met. This guidance also addresses derecognition, classification, interest and penalties, disclosure, and transition. The College conducts business in the U.S. and, as a result, files information returns for U.S. and Illinois. In the normal course of business, the College is subject to examination by taxing authorities.

THE FUNDS ARE INVESTED IN PERPETUITY FOR LONG TERM GROWTH AND THE PAYOUT IS USED FOR THE PURPOSE SET FORTH IN THE GIFT DOCUMENT.

STANFORD CONTINUES TO BE ONE OF FEW PRIVATE INSTITUTIONS THAT ENROLL AND ADMIT THE VERY BEST APPLICANTS, REGARDLESS OF THEIR FAMILIES' INCOME AND PROVIDE SUFFICIENT FINANCIAL AID FOR ALL ADMITTED STUDENTS WHO HAVE UNIVERSITY-COMPUTED NEED, AND WHO MEET STATED FINANCIAL AND ELIGIBLE REQUIREMENTS, TO ATTEND THE UNIVERSITY. ENDOWMENT SUPPORT CONTRIBUTES GREATLY TO THE SUCCESS OF THESE EFFORTS. IN PART AS A RESULT OF ENDOWMENT SUPPORT OF STUDENT AID, STANFORD IS ABLE TO WAIVE THE TOTAL COST OF TUITION FOR MANY OF ITS DESERVING STUDENTS. STANFORD RECENTLY EXPANDED FINANCIAL AID BY INCREASING THE INCOME THRESHOLDS AT WHICH PARENTS ARE NOT EXPECTED TO CONTRIBUTE TOWARD EDUCATIONAL COSTS. STANFORD WILL EXPECT NO PARENTAL CONTRIBUTION TOWARD TUITION FROM PARENTS WITH ANNUAL INCOMES BELOW $125,000 - PREVIOUSLY $100,000 - AND TYPICAL ASSETS. AND THERE WILL BE ZERO PARENTAL CONTRIBUTION TOWARD TUITION, ROOM OR BOARD FOR PARENTS WITH ANNUAL INCOMES BELOW $65,000 - PREVIOUSLY $60,000 - AND TYPICAL ASSETS.

The tax benefit to be recognized is measured as the largest amount of benefit that is greater than fifty percent likely of being realized upon ultimate settlement. Derecognition of a tax benefit previously recognized could result in the University recording a tax liability that would reduce net assets. The University has reviewed all significant tax positions for material tax jurisdictions including US federal, and California and Oregon state tax jurisdictions for which the statute of limitations remained open, which is generally three years for federal and four years for state. The open tax years also include tax years to the extent of net operating loss carry forwards, which add the tax years June 30, 2002 through June 30, 2008 for state tax purposes. The University has determined there were no material unrecognized tax benefits in the open tax years. However, the statute can be extended if there was a failure to file a necessary tax return. In addition, there have been no material changes in unrecognized benefits since July 1, 2013, nor are any anticipated in the 12 months following June 30, 2014. However, management's conclusions regarding this policy may be subject to review and adjustment at a later date based on factors including, but not limited to, ongoing analyses of and changes to tax laws, regulations and interpretations thereof.

Accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of America prescribes recognition thresholds and measurement attributes for the financial statement recognition and measurement of a tax position taken or expected to be taken in a tax return. Tax benefits will be recognized only if a tax position is more-likely-than-not sustained in a tax examination, with a tax examination being presumed to occur. The amount recognized will be the largest amount of tax benefit that is greater than 50% likely of being realized on examination. For tax positions not meeting the more-likely-than-not test, no tax benefit will be recorded. Management has concluded that they are unaware of any tax benefits or liabilities to be recognized at June 30, 2014. The University would recognize interest and penalties related to unrecognized tax benefits in interest and income tax expense, respectively. The University has no amounts accrued for interest or penalties for the year ended June 30, 2014. The University is no longer subject to examination by taxing authorities for years before 2011.

THE ENDOWMENT INCLUDES BOTH DONOR-RESTRICTED ENDOWMENT FUNDS AND FUNDS DESIGNATED BY THE GOVERNING BODY TO FUNCTION AS ENDOWMENTS (BOARD DESIGNATED ENDOWMENTS). AS REQUIRED BY ACCOUNTING PRINCIPLES GENERALLY ACCEPTED IN THE UNITED STATES OF AMERICA (""GAAP""), NET ASSETS ASSOCIATED WITH ENDOWMENT FUNDS, INCLUDING BOARD-DESIGNATED ENDOWMENT FUNDS, ARE CLASSIFIED AND REPORTED BASED ON THE EXISTENCE OR ABSENCE OF DONOR-IMPOSED RESTRICTIONS. THE UNIVERSITY'S GOVERNING BODY HAS INTERPRETED THE STATE OF MISSOURI PRUDENT MANAGEMENT OF INSTITUTIONAL FUNDS ACT (SPMIFA), ADOPTED IN AUGUST 2009, AS REQUIRING PRESERVATION OF THE FAIR VALUE OF THE ORIGINAL GIFT AS OF THE GIFT DATE OF THE DONOR-RESTRICTED ENDOWMENT FUNDS ABSENT EXPLICIT DONOR STIPULATIONS TO THE CONTRARY. AS A RESULT OF THIS INTERPRETATION, THE UNIVERSITY CLASSIFIES AS PERMANENTLY RESTRICTED NET ASSETS (A) THE ORIGINAL VALUE OF GIFTS DONATED TO THE PERMANENT ENDOWMENT, (B) THE ORIGINAL VALUE OF SUBSEQUENT GIFTS TO THE PERMANENT ENDOWMENT AND (C) ACCUMULATIONS TO THE PERMANENT ENDOWMENT MADE IN ACCORDANCE WITH THE DIRECTION OF THE APPLICABLE DONOR GIFT INSTRUMENT AT THE TIME THE ACCUMULATION IS ADDED TO THE FUND. THE REMAINING PORTION OF DONOR-RESTRICTED ENDOWMENT FUNDS IS CLASSIFIED AS TEMPORARILY RESTRICTED NET ASSETS UNTIL THOSE AMOUNTS ARE APPROPRIATED FOR EXPENDITURE BY THE UNIVERSITY IN A MANNER CONSISTENT WITH THE STANDARD OF PRUDENCE PRESCRIBED BY SPMIFA. IN ACCORDANCE WITH SPMIFA, THE UNIVERSITY CONSIDERS THE FOLLOWING FACTORS IN MAKING A DETERMINATION TO APPROPRIATE OR ACCUMULATE DONOR-RESTRICTED ENDOWMENT FUNDS: 1. DURATION AND PRESERVATION OF THE FUND 2. PURPOSES OF THE UNIVERSITY AND THE FUND 3. GENERAL ECONOMIC CONDITIONS 4. POSSIBLE EFFECT OF INFLATION AND DEFLATION 5.

UNDER THE UNIVERSITY'S ENDOWMENT SPENDING POLICY, FOR OPERATIONAL PURPOSES THE BOARD OF TRUSTEES ANNUALLY DIRECTS THAT A PERCENTAGE OF A THREE-YEAR ROLLING AVERAGE MARKET VALUE OF INVESTMENTS HELD FOR ENDOWMENT PURPOSES BE ALLOCATED AS A DISTRIBUTION OF ENDOWMENT INCOME FOR CURRENT OPERATIONS. FOR 2014, SUCH PERCENTAGE WAS 7%. THE UNIVERSITY HAS ADOPTED INVESTMENT AND SPENDING POLICIES FOR ENDOWMENT ASSETS THAT ATTEMPT TO PROVIDE A PREDICTABLE STREAM OF FUNDING TO PROGRAMS AND OTHER ITEMS SUPPORTED BY ITS ENDOWMENT WHILE SEEKING TO MAINTAIN THE PURCHASING POWER OF THE ENDOWMENT. ENDOWMENT ASSETS INCLUDE THOSE ASSETS OF DONOR-RESTRICTED ENDOWMENT FUNDS THE UNIVERSITY MUST HOLD IN PERPETUITY OR FOR DONOR-SPECIFIED PERIODS, AS WELL AS THOSE OF BOARD-DESIGNATED ENDOWMENT FUNDS. UNDER THE UNIVERSITY'S POLICIES, ENDOWMENT ASSETS ARE INVESTED IN A MANNER THAT IS INTENDED TO MAINTAIN PURCHASING POWER, WHILE REDUCING, TO THE GREATEST EXTENT POSSIBLE, THE POSSIBILITY OF LOSS. THE ENDOWMENT FUND'S RETURN IS MEASURED ON A TIME WEIGHTED TOTAL RETURN BASIS OVER A ONE, THREE AND FIVE YEAR PERIOD OF TIME AGAINST APPROPRIATE BENCHMARKS AND A MANAGER UNIVERSE OF FUNDS HAVING A SIMILAR INVESTMENT STYLE. TO SATISFY ITS LONG-TERM RATE OF RETURN OBJECTIVES, THE UNIVERSITY RELIES ON A TOTAL RETURN STRATEGY IN WHICH INVESTMENT RETURNS ARE ACHIEVED THROUGH BOTH CURRENT YIELD (INVESTMENT INCOME SUCH AS DIVIDENDS AND INTEREST) AND CAPITAL APPRECIATION (BOTH REALIZED AND UNREALIZED).
