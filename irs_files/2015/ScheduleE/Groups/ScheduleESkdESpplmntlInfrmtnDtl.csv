Shortly after its incorporation in 1852, it amended its articles of incorporation to provide that, ""nor shall religious or theological opinions of any kind or considerations of race, creed, or national origin ever be used as a basis for excluding a person from its benefits."" The University has since expanded its policy of nondiscrimination requiring that ""Antioch provides equal opportunity for all qualified applicants and does not discriminate on the basis of race, color, gender, ancestry, religion, national origin, sexual orientation, gender identity, family status or disability in matters affecting employment or in providing access to programs."" It now includes its nondiscrimination policy statement in all brochures and other recruitment materials as well as in the course catalog. Finally, the policy is clearly posted on the website of each University campus and program. Further, as per section 4.03 paragraph c, the University currently enrolls students of racial minorities in meaningful numbers. Per section 4.03 paragraph b of Rev.
