These scholarship decisions are also made by committee after a review of scholarship budgets and criteria. With respect to grants, Hillsdale College students may become eligible for grant monies only by demonstrating significant need on Hillsdale College's Confidential Family Financial Statement (CFFS).

EACH STUDENT'S AWARD PACKAGE IS REVIEWED TO ENSURE COMPLIANCE WITH APPLICABLE REGULATORY REQUIREMENTS, AND IN THE CASE OF RESTRICTED INSTITUTIONAL FUNDS, WITH THE DONOR'S INTENT AND WISHES. ACADEMIC SCHOLARSHIP ELIGIBILITY IS BASED ON A SCORING MATRIX THAT EVALUATES AN INDIVIDUAL STUDENT'S SUCCESS USING NATIONAL TEST SCORES, RANK IN CLASS, AND HIGH SCHOOL GPA.

INSTITUTIONALLY FUNDED NEED-BASED FINANCIAL AID PROGRAMS ARE BASED ON ELIGIBILITY ESTABLISHED BY THE FAFSA. STUDENTS APPLYING FOR NEED-BASED GRANTS ARE REQUIRED TO SUBMIT THE CSS PROFILE APPLICATION. THE FINANCIAL AID OFFICE ALSO WORKS CLOSELY WITH THE DONOR RELATIONS DIVISION OF UNIVERSITY ADVANCEMENT TO ENSURE THAT OUR DONORS' WISHES ARE MET WHEN MATCHING FUNDS TO STUDENTS. ALL DONORS OF ENDOWED AWARDS ARE PROVIDED WITH A ""SCHOLARSHIP AGREEMENT"" OUTLINING THE UNIVERSITY'S UNDERSTANDING OF THE DONOR'S INTENT.

ELIGIBILITY FOR TITLE IV FEDERAL FINANCIAL ASSISTANCE AND STATE FUNDED NEED-BASED AID PROGRAMS IS DETERMINED USING FEDERAL METHODOLOGY AND REQUIRES THE SUBMISSION OF THE FAFSA. PRIOR TO DISBURSEMENT, EACH RECIPIENT MUST PASS A VARIETY OF EDIT CHECKS, OR ""DISBURSEMENT RULES"" TO ENSURE THAT THE STUDENT IS ENROLLED IN CLASSES AND HAS SUBMITTED ALL REQUIRED DOCUMENTATION NEEDED TO SATISFY PROGRAM ELIGIBILITY. AFTER DISBURSEMENT, STUDENT AID RECIPIENTS ARE REVIEWED AT THE END OF THE 100% TUITION REFUND PERIOD FOR A FINAL ENROLLMENT STATUS DETERMINATION. STUDENTS WHO RECEIVED AID BASED ON PROJECTED FULL-TIME ENROLLMENT, BUT WHO HAVE DROPPED BELOW 12 CREDIT HOURS, ARE SUBJECT TO AN ADJUSTMENT OF THEIR AID PACKAGE. AT THE END OF THE 25%, AND FINAL REFUND PERIOD, STUDENTS ARE AGAIN REVIEWED AND SUBJECT TO AID ADJUSTMENT BASED ON FINAL COSTS FOR THE TERM. AID RECIPIENTS ARE MONITORED ON A REGULAR BASIS THROUGHOUT THE ACADEMIC YEAR.

REPORTS ARE SUBMITTED TO THE TEXAS HIGHER EDUCATION COORDINATING BOARD PERIODICALLY FOR REVIEW OF STATE AID RECIPIENTS, AND THE UNIVERSITY IS SUBJECT TO PERIODIC AUDITS AND REVIEWS FROM BOTH ENTITIES. ACADEMIC SUCCESS IS THE ULTIMATE GOAL OF ALL AID PROGRAMS, AND SATISFACTORY ACADEMIC PROGRESS IS REVIEWED AT THE END OF EACH TERM. AT A MINIMUM, FULL-TIME STUDENTS ARE REQUIRED TO COMPLETE AT LEAST 24 CREDIT HOURS AND OBTAIN A 2.00 GPA TO MEET RENEWAL REQUIREMENTS. MOST TCU FUNDED AWARDS REQUIRE A MINIMUM GPA OF 2.50.

Contributions by the University are made where they further the University's mission or its role as a good community citizen. All grants, including sub-grants, are accounted for separately by the University's financial accounting system and each is managed by a principal investigator. Financial activity reports are provided to principal investigators on a daily basis, with reconciliation of financial reports required on a monthly basis. Sub-grants are further monitored by obtaining a grantee's A-133 audits and evaluating the grantee's ability to comply with the terms of the sub-grant. All grant monitoring is subject to the policies and procedures of the University, which are designed to meet federal requirements. The University's Office of Institutional Compliance, Office of Research Services, Restricted Accounting and others are charged with ensuring that all DePaul employees are aware of their responsibilities in developing and maintaining a compliance-conscious environment. Additionally, the Office of Institutional Compliance, Office of Research Services, Restricted Accounting, Principal Investigators and others are charged with ensuring that the University's policies and procedures, as well as local, state and federal laws are followed. This is accomplished through conducting risk assessments, monitoring operational activities, providing online, classroom and/or one-on-one training and other tools that foster compliance. Grants and assistance to students represents financial assistance in the form of institutional scholarships. All scholarships are administered through the University's financial aid system. Institutional scholarships are credited to the student's internal tuition account and represent an offset to tuition and other fees assessed by the University. Grants and assistance to University staff and their eligible spouse, dependents, or an unrelated second domiciled adult represent staff tuition waivers, pursuant to a written benefits plan. Staff tuition waivers are administered through the University's benefits system and, like institutional scholarships for students, are credited to the individual's internal tuition account to offset tuition charges. Taxability of tuition waivers is determined pursuant to sections 127 and 117(d) of the Internal Revenue Code."

The Director of Financial Aid is responsible for establishing Institutional policy development surrounding the delivery of financial assistance. Policy development adheres to federal and state laws and regulations as well as to the mission of the University. When appropriate, Financial Aid policy is reported to and approved by the Executive Vice President & Chief Operations Officer. The primary purpose of a collegiate financial aid program should be to provide financial assistance to accepted students who, without such aid, would be unable to attend that university. Each university has an obligation to assist in realizing the national goal of equality of educational opportunity. The University, therefore, should work with schools, community groups, and other educational institutions in support of this goal. Parents are expected to contribute according to their means, taking into account their income, assets, number of dependents, and other relevant information. Students themselves are expected to contribute from their own assets and earnings, including appropriate borrowing against future earnings. Need-based financial aid should be offered only after determination that the resources of the family are insufficient to meet the student's educational expenses. The amount of need-based aid offered should not exceed the amount needed to meet the difference between the student's total educational expenses and the family's resources. The amount and type of self-help expected from students should be related to the circumstances of the individual. In the assignment of funds to those students designated to receive financial aid, the largest amounts of total grant assistance should go to students with the least ability to pay. The university should review its financial assistance awards annually and adjust them, if necessary, to reflect changes in the financial needs of students and the expenses of attending the institution. The university has an obligation to inform students and parents of the financial aid renewal policies for enrolled students at the time of the initial offer of financial assistance. Because the amount of financial assistance awarded reflects the economic circumstances of students and their families as well as available funding, the university should refrain from any public announcement of the amount of aid offered and encourage students, their secondary schools, and others to respect the confidentiality of this information. Selection of students to receive financial aid will be made without regard to age, sex, race, color, religion, national origin, disability or marital status. Priority consideration for aid is given to students whose files are complete by March 1 of each year. The institution will package each student according to the matrix (percentage) need assigned the student. This determination is made by the award year the student will enter. Once the matrix year is determined the student is awarded a percentage of his or her (FAFSA) need with federal, state and institutional aid. The student is then awarded work study followed with Perkins loan, Stafford (subsidized or unsubsidized) loan and the PLUS loan, as applicable. Aid is ""frozen"" from one year to the next. In extreme instances as defined by the Financial Aid Office, the amount of grant money may be adjusted accordingly to reflect a students' new need. Honors scholarships are awarded based on the high school GPA, rank and either the SAT or ACT scores. Students will continue to receive the scholarship as long as the student is in good academic standing. Award letters are mailed or emailed to the student whenever there is a change to the financial aid award and the change affects federal or state awards."
