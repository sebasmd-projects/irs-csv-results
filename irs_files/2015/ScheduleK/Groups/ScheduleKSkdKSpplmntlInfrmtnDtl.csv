For Seton Hall University issue 2013D, Rebate calculations were done for the period from July 10, 2013 through June 30, 2014 Part I, Column(f) Description of Purpose 1. Seton Hall University Issues, 2008 Series D & E,(CUSIP numbers 646065WZ1 and 646065XQ0) were issued by the New Jersey Educational Facilities Authority (NJEFA) to currently refund Seton Hall University Issues, 2005 Series C and 2006 Series A. The 2005 Series C issue was issued on August 18, 2005 by the NJEFA to finance capital improvements at the University. The 2006 Series A issue was issued on June 1, 2006. It refunded the University's 1996 Series E issue, which was for capital improvements and for refunding the University's 1989 Series C issue, which was for capital improvements. The 2008 Series D & E issues were treated as a single issue for tax purposes. Amounts reported in Schedule K herein are for the combined issue. All proceeds deposited in the refunding escrows have been spent. The issue price in Part I, column E, of $73,939,881 plus $8,217 of interest earnings at the time of issue and $685,153 of project funds remaining from the 2005 and 2006 bonds at the time of the refunding, which were transferred to the 2008 Series D & E Bonds, equals the Part II, line3, total proceeds of the issue of $74,633,251. All of the $685,153 has been used for capital expenditures. In 2005, the University entered into two long-term interest rate swap agreements with Citibank, N.A. in order to hedge interest rate exposure related to their 2005 Series C and 2006 Series A issues. Following the refunding of the 2005 and 2006 issues with 2008 Series D & E, the interest rate swap agreements remained in place, following an amendment, in order to hedge interest rate exposure for the 2008 Series D issue. The swap agreements expire concurrently with the maturity of the 2008 Series D bonds, the last of which mature on July 1, 2037. 2. Seton Hall University Issue, 2011 Series A, (CUSIP number 646065U83) was issued by the NJEFA to currently refund Seton Hall University's 1999 Refunding, 2001 Series A, 2001 Series B, and 2001 Series G bond issues. The 1999 Refunding issue was issued in July 1999 to refund the University's 1991 Series D and 1989 Series C issues. The 1991 Series D and the 1989 Series C issues were issued to finance capital improvements. The 2001 Series A issue was issued in June 2001 to refund the University's 1991 Series A issue which refunded the University's 1985 Series A issue which was issued to finance capital improvements. The 2001 Series B issue was issued in June 2001 to refund the University's 1991 Series B issue which was issued to refund the University's 1988 Series B issue which was issued to refund the University's 1976 Series A issue and to finance capital improvements. The 1976 Series A issue was issued to finance capital improvements. The 2001 Series G issue was issued in June 2001 to finance capital improvements. 3. On April 14, 2004, the NJEFA issued Capital Improvement Fund (""CIF"")Series 2004A bonds pursuant to a program of the State of New Jersey to finance capital improvements at institutions of higher education. The bonds were issued in the principal amount of $76,725,000 which was allocated to a total of seven institutions in New Jersey, three public and four private. An 8038 was filed for the portion of the issue allocated to private institutions and a separate 8038-G was filed for the portion allocated to public institutions. Seton Hall's apportioned amount, after $115,491 of apportioned issuance and credit enhancement costs, was $7,690,209. Of this amount $78,458 was allocated to capitalized interest. The remainder that was received by Seton Hall was $7,611,751, of which $3,805,875 was a grant and $3,805,876 was repayable over 20 years. Bonds issued to finance grants must be approved by the State Treasurer and are repayable by the State subject to appropriation. The bonds are sold based on the credit of the State. Each grantee enters into a grant agreement obligating the grantee to pay 1/2 of the debt service on the bonds allocable to the grant. On October 26, 2006, NJEFA issued CIF Bonds, Series 2006 A to partially advance refund the 2004 A Bonds and other series of CIF Bonds. At that time, the amounts payable by each grantee were adjusted to take account of allocable debt service savings. The CUSIP number and issue date shown in Part I of Schedule K are for the Series 2004 A Bonds. The NJEFA has further information about the total bond issue. Seton Hall spent the entire amount of bond proceeds allocated to it on capital improvements on the University's campus. Seton Hall University does not use any of the debt financed property to undertake a non-exempt activity. The amounts reported on Schedule K, Part III, Line 5 represent the bond issuance and credit enhancement costs from Schedule K, Part II, Lines 7 and 8 divided by the amount on Part II, Line 3, total proceeds of issue. The University has responded ""Yes"" to Schedule K, Part IV, line 2a, which asks if an exception to rebate applies. This response is predicated on the University's spending of its apportioned grant and loan amount of $7,611,751 as part of this bond issue. On April 29, 2014 the NJEFA issued CIF bonds, Series 2014 B, and advance refunding CIF bonds, Series 2014 D, pursuant to a program of the State of New Jersey to finance capital improvements at institutions of higher education. One Form 8038 was filed by the NJEFA covering both issues, under CUSIP number 646066DG2. Gross proceeds from both issues were $19,369,367 with the 2014 B portion being $15,493,539 and the 2014 D portion being $3,875,828. The Series 2014 D issue partially advance refunded the 2004A bonds related to three private institutions of higher education. As a result of this advance refunding, amounts payable by each institution, including the University, was adjusted to take into account allocable debt service savings. 4. As noted above, on April 29, 2014 the NJEFA issued CIF bonds, Series 2014 B, pursuant to a program of the State of New Jersey to finance capital improvements at institutions of higher education. The gross proceeds of this issuance were $15,493,539. The proceeds were allocated to six private institutions of higher education. Seton Hall's apportioned amount was $2,192,165. After $12,165 of apportioned issuance costs, the remainder that was received by Seton Hall was $2,180,000, of which $1,165,170 was a grant and $1,014,830 was repayable over 20 years. Bonds issued to finance grants must be approved by the State Treasurer and are repayable by the State subject to appropriation. The bonds were sold based on the credit of the State. Each institution enters into a grant agreement obligating the grantee to pay a portion of the debt service on the bonds allocable to the grant. Seton Hall intends to spend the entire amount of the bond proceeds allocated to it on capital improvements. The amount reported on Schedule K, Part III, line 5 represents the bond issuance costs from Schedule K, Part II, line 7 divided by the amount on Part II, line 3, total proceeds of issue. 5. Seton Hall University issue, 2013 D, (CUSIP 6460656D9) was issued by the NJEFA to currently refund Seton Hall University's 2009 C bonds sold directly to Capital One, N.A., finance a portion of the cost of terminating the University's interest rate swap agreement with Citibank, N.A. that hedged interest rate exposure related to the 2009 C bonds, and to finance capital improvements. The University's 2009 Series C bonds refunded the University issue, 1998 Series F, issued on June 29, 1998 by the NJEFA to refund a 1991 Series D Seton Hall University issue that financed capital improvements at the University. The portion of the 2013 D total proceeds of $43,935,728 that was used to refund the 2009 C bonds and to finance a portion of the cost to terminate the related swap agreement was $7,800,307. The remainder of $36,135,421 was used to pay costs of issuance of $522,077, pay $2,405,009 of capitalized interest, and deposit $33,208,335 into a construction fund for capital improvements.

THE UNIVERSITY USES GENEROUS DONOR GIFTS, UNIVERSITY RESERVES AND TAXABLE DEBT, IN ADDITION TO PROCEEDS FROM TAX EXEMPT BORROWING, TO FUND THE CONSTRUCTION OF ACADEMIC BUILDINGS, RESEARCH SUPPORT FACILITIES, RESIDENCES AND OTHER CAMPUS HOUSING, ROADS AND INFRASTRUCTURE. THESE FACILITIES HAVE, IN TURN, ENABLED THE UNIVERSITY TO ATTRACT OUTSTANDING FACULTY AND STUDENTS AND TO MORE EFFECTIVELY PERFORM INTERDISCIPLINARY RESEARCH DESIGNED TO ADDRESS FUNDAMENTAL WORLD PROBLEMS. THE NEW FACILITIES PROVIDE THE STANFORD COMMUNITY WITH THE MOST ADVANCED TECHNOLOGY AND ENVIRONMENT FOR TEACHING, LEARNING AND RESEARCH. THE FUNDING ALSO HAS PLAYED A KEY ROLE IN ENABLING STANFORD TO MEET SEISMIC AND OTHER FEDERAL AND STATE BUILDING REQUIREMENTS. THE FOLLOWING ARE EXAMPLES OF BUILDINGS FUNDED IN PART THROUGH TAX-EXEMPT DEBT: i. THE YANG YAMAZAKI ENVIRONMENTAL AND ENERGY BUILDING IS THE HUB OF STANFORD'S ENVIRONMENTAL SUSTAINABILITY TEACHING AND RESEARCH. IT IS A MODEL FOR SUSTAINABILITY BUILDING STANDARDS, USING 56 PERCENT LESS ENERGY AND 90 PERCENT LESS POTABLE WATER THAN A TRADITIONALLY CONSTRUCTED BUILDING OF ITS SIZE. IT HAS BEEN RECOGNIZED WITH LEED PLATINUM CERTIFICATION. ii. THE LI KA SHING CENTER FOR LEARNING AND KNOWLEDGE BRINGS TOGETHER CUTTING-EDGE MEDICINE, MODERN EDUCATION AND ADVANCED TECHNOLOGY TO TRAIN THE PHYSICIANS OF TOMORROW. MEDICAL STUDENTS PRACTICE LIFE-SAVING SKILLS IN REALISTIC SIMULATIONS AND LEARN TO APPLY RESEARCH TO BEDSIDE TREATMENTS. THE CENTER IS A GATHERING PLACE FOR MEDICAL EXPERTS TO SHARE RESEARCH AND HEALTH CARE INSIGHTS AND TO BRING THEIR COMBINED EXPERTISE TO BEAR ON THE WORLD'S GREATEST HEALTH CHALLENGES. iii. THE JAMES AND ANNA MARIE SPILKER ENGINEERING AND APPLIED SCIENCES BUILDING FOSTERS COLLABORATIVE DEVELOPMENT IN THE BURGEONING FIELD OF NANOTECHNOLOGY. SCIENTISTS AT THE CENTER ARE STUDYING HOW TO CREATE MATERIALS AND DEVICES NO BIGGER THAN ONE-BILLIONTH OF A METER, WITH DIRECT AND ECONOMICALLY VIABLE APPLICATIONS TO MEDICINE, ENERGY AND COMMUNICATIONS. iv. THE HUANG ENGINEERING CENTER HOUSES THE SCHOOL OF ENGINEERING, WHOSE TIES TO THE HIGH-TECHNOLOGY INDUSTRY CONTINUE TO FUEL THE GROWTH AND ECONOMY OF SILICON VALLEY AND NORTHERN CALIFORNIA. THE SCHOOL OF ENGINEERING IS WORLD RENOWNED FOR PUSHING THE FRONTIERS OF MODERN SCIENCE AND ENGINEERING, ESPECIALLY IN THE FIELDS OF COMPUTER SCIENCE, BIOENGINEERING AND ENVIRONMENTAL SUSTAINABILITY. v. THE LORRY I. LOKEY STEM CELL RESEARCH BUILDING OPENED IN 2010 AND IS THE LARGEST DEDICATED STEM CELL RESEARCH BUILDING IN THE COUNTRY. THE BUILDING HOUSES THE STANFORD STEM CELL BIOLOGY AND REGENERATIVE MEDICINE INSTITUTE, WHICH INTEGRATES RESEARCHERS FROM CANCER, NEUROSCIENCE, CARDIOVASCULAR MEDICINE, TRANSPLANTATION, IMMUNOLOGY, BIOENGINEERING AND DEVELOPMENTAL BIOLOGY. ALL ARE FOCUSED ON MAKING DISCOVERIES IN STEM CELL RESEARCH AND QUICKLY TRANSLATING THEM INTO PRECLINICAL APPLICATIONS, INNOVATIVE THERAPIES AND TREATMENTS. vi. THE MUNGER GRADUATE RESIDENCE IS A FIVE-BUILDING HOUSING COMPLEX FOR 600 STANFORD LAW AND OTHER GRADUATE STUDENTS. IT IS A SIGNIFICANT INVESTMENT BY STANFORD IN MITIGATING TRAFFIC AND OTHER ENVIRONMENTAL CONCERNS AS IT GREATLY REDUCES THE NUMBER OF PEOPLE DRIVING TO CAMPUS DAILY. vii. THE WILLIAM H. NEUKOM BUILDING, WHICH HOUSES THE CLINICS OF THE STANFORD LAW SCHOOL, OPENED IN 2011 AND WAS BUILT TO SATISFY THE EQUIVALENT OF A LEED GOLD CERTIFICATION FOR SUSTAINABILITY. THE BUILDING USES 30 PERCENT LESS ENERGY THAN REQUIRED BY CODE. THE BUILDING HOUSES THE MILLS LEGAL CLINIC, WHICH INCLUDES 12 CLINICS THAT TEACH THROUGH EXPERIENTIAL EDUCATION. LAW STUDENTS LEARN THE PRACTICE OF LAW BY REPRESENTING, FOR INSTANCE, LOW-INCOME OR INDIGENT PEOPLE IN CIVIL AND CRIMINAL LITIGATIONS, AND BY PROVIDING LEGAL COUNSEL ON ENVIRONMENTAL ISSUES, HUMAN RIGHTS, NONPROFIT CORPORATE GOVERNANCE, EDUCATION, AND RELIGIOUS FREEDOM.

REPORTING APPROACH FOR THE TAX-EXEMPT COMMERCIAL PAPER PROGRAM: THE UNIVERSITY USES THE PROCEEDS FROM ISSUANCE OF COMMERCIAL PAPER NOTES TO FUND PURCHASES OF CAPITAL EQUIPMENT, LIBRARY BOOKS AND INFORMATION TECHNOLOGY ASSETS, AND TO FUND MINOR CAPITAL RENOVATIONS. THE NOTES IN EACH SERIES ARE ISSUED IN TRANCHES. EACH TRANCHE IS COMPRISED OF ISSUES WHICH ARE SEGREGATED BY THE AFOREMENTIONED FOUR ASSET TYPES. WEIGHTED AVERAGE LIFE CALCULATIONS ARE PREPARED FOR EACH ISSUE WITHIN A TRANCHE, RESULTING IN UNIQUE MATURITY DATES FOR EACH ISSUE WITHIN A TRANCHE. WHILE A SEPARATE FORM 8038 IS PREPARED FOR EACH ISSUE WITHIN A COMMERCIAL PAPER TRANCHE, SCHEDULE K INSTRUCTIONS PERMIT INFORMATION TO BE COMBINED FOR SERIES THAT ARE ISSUED AT SUBSTANTIALLY THE SAME TIME. SINCE THIS IS THE CASE FOR THE UNIVERSITY'S COMMERCIAL PAPER ISSUANCES THAT ARE ISSUED AS ONE TRANCHE, ALL ISSUES FOR AN INDIVIDUAL TRANCHE ARE COMBINED AND REPORTED AT THE TRANCHE LEVEL FOR PART I OF SCHEDULE K.
