""Be of service"" is an integral core value that we demonstrate in a variety of ways. Perhaps the most obvious way we meet our commitment to community is by providing treatment services to individuals and families who seek and qualify for care but are unable to pay the full cost. Our patient aid policy provides that Hazelden Betty Ford will annually establish a target amount of patient aid. Our patient aid awards totaled nearly $7,800,000 in charges forgone in 2014. In addition, the Foundation provides a variety of other benefits for the public good including:Hazelden Betty Ford Graduate School of Addiction Studies: -The Hazelden Betty Ford Graduate School of Addiction Studies prepares future leaders in addiction counseling through the Master of Arts in Addiction Counseling and the Certificate in Addiction Counseling programs. The school emphasizes public engagement as a means of serving its constituent communities. In 2014 alone, students provided more than 13,000 hours of clinical services at agencies reaching underserved and economically disadvantaged populations. Students also volunteered their time to organizations reaching the homeless and worked to educate the public at large. The school offers a full scholarship each year to students from Chisago County Health and Human Services and provides continuing education to these Chisago County professionals at no cost. Sixty-four students graduated with master's degrees from the school in 2014. Overall, more than 90 percent of graduates who seek careers in the addiction treatment field find employment in their home communities or at regional or national treatment agencies. Faculty and graduate-school leaders participate in public service events throughout the United States and make research, educational, and scholarly contributions to the field of addiction treatment.Butler Center for Research: The Butler Center for Research (BCR) is dedicated to improving recovery from addiction by conducting clinical and institutional research, collaborating with other research centers, and communicating scientific findings. It is the Center's vision that sustained recovery for all who seek help will be achieved through advancements in knowledge and integration of research into practice. Among the department's many activities in 2014: -As part of Hazelden Betty Ford Foundation's commitment to evidence-based practice, over 35 data analyses projects were conducted to inform clinical care and academic programming, identify treatment needs, drive data-based decision-making, set targets for 2015 strategic plan goals, and contribute to the field's knowledge of addiction treatment.-The Huss Research Chair on Older Adults is a collaborative initiative that allows Hazelden Betty Ford Foundation researchers to partner with leading national experts on projects related to older adults with addiction. The current Huss Research study is examining the effects of naltrexone, an anticraving agent for alcohol, on treatment outcomes among alcohol dependent adult residential patients. The study is also examining whether patient response to naltrexone depends on a particular gene related to an opioid receptor in the brain. All data collection is complete. Statistical analyses of the data are currently underway and manuscripts are being prepared for submission to peer reviewed journals. -Several clinical research projects were conducted in 2014. Twelve-month outcomes data collection for a study measuring attentional bias among young adults was completed and analyses of study data are underway. Analyses of data from the recovery index studies, designed to create a measure of functioning in recovery from addiciton, were conducted and a manuscript of the findings is currently under review at a peer-reviewed research journal. Recruitment and baseline testing continued for a project studying the impact of treatment programming for opioid-dependent patients, with over 50 participants recruited to date.-Research Updates were disseminated to professionals, educators, researchers, students, and other stakeholders. Three new Research Updates were created, including one on clinical severity among lesbian, gay, bisexual, transgendered, and questioning (LGBTQ) patients attending residential treatment. These two-page summaries of scientific findings from the field of addiction treatment research are provided at no cost as a community benefit to policy makers, treatment professionals, and the public at large. They are also available on the BCR's webpage at hazeldenbettyford.org.-Several research manuscripts were published in peer-reviewed addictions journals in 2014. These papers focused on several different topics including clinical and baseline substance use severity among LGBTQ patients admitted to residential treatment.-BCR's Dan Anderson Research Award is conferred on an annual basis to recognize a published article that has a significant impact on the field of addiction treatment research. In the fall of 2014, Henry R. Kranzler, MD, director, Center for Studies of Addiction at the University of Pennsylvania Perelman School of Medicine, earned the award for his study entitled ""Topiramate treatment for heavy drinkers: Moderation by GRIK1 polymorphism,"" published in 2014 in the American Journal of Psychiatry. This study examined the effectiveness of topiramate treatment in reducing drinking among a sample of heavy drinkers.Professionals in Residence: The Professionals in Residence (PIR) program and the Summer Institute for Medical Students (SIMS) give medical students, residents, and health care and legal professionals an in-depth experience with the dynamics of the disease of addiction. Intensive one-week programs blend classes presented by Hazelden Betty Ford Foundation physicians and expert clinicians with time spent interacting with patients or family members and staff on treatment units or family programs. Participants learn about the latest research and evidence-based methods from our multidisciplinary faculty. -A two-week rotation on addiction for family medicine residents is available in Minnesota and California. A one-year accredited Addiction Medicine Fellowship is available at the Betty Ford Center in California and a Course on Addictions and Recovery Education (CARE) is available worldwide. The Minnesota and California sites offer customized programming for larger groups.-In 2014, the Minnesota and California programs welcomed a total of 510 participants.Center for Public Advocacy: In 2014, activities at the Hazelden Betty Ford Foundation's Center for Public Advocacy (CPA) focused on building greater public understanding of addiction and shaping public policy that supports treatment and recovery.-A key initiative was participating in several public forums on the dangers of prescription painkiller misuse. We hosted some of these events and collaborated on others, providing speakers and information.-Another key initiative was continuing to advocate for robust implementation of the federal ""parity"" law, which expands access to addiction treatment through private health care insurance. The Paul Wellstone and Pete Domenici Mental Health and Addiction Equity Act ends discrimination by insurance companies against people who need addiction treatment. The CPA plays a leading role in the the Parity Implementation Coalition (PIC), which advocates for expansive interpretations of the federal implementing regulations for the law. In conjuction with the PIC, the CPA produced a online ""toolkit"" that is posted on the Hazelden Betty Ford Foundation website to help people understand and access their rights under the law. The CPA also continues to monitor the implementation of the law.-Federal health care reform was also a key focus of the Center's efforts. Working with other treatment providers, Hazelden Betty Ford Foundation ensured that addiction to alcohol and other drugs was included as a covered illness in the ""essential benefits package"" under the Affordable Care Act (ACA). Promoting awareness of these benefits for addiction consumers and providers in ACA is an ongoing priority and activity.-Hazelden Betty Ford Foundation hosts a free online Social Community, which provides an easily accessible forum for people all over the world to gather, gain information on addiction and recovery, and share with others their experience, strength, and hope."
201502129349301030,410682405,"-The CPA hosted free public-screenings and discussions of the film The Anonymous People, which performs a public service for those in recovery from addiction by highlighting successful recovery stories and empowering those in recovery to speak out, share their own stories, and advocate for recovery-favorable policies. The Social Community hosted a free online screening of the film as well. Over 5,700 people logged on to watch, and afterward, many of them participated in an online discussion featuring several experts.-Not all of the Center's efforts were focused on national public policy. In Minnesota, the Hazelden Betty Ford Foundation has played a leading role with state lawmakers in making the case for the efficacy and cost effectiveness of substance abuse treatment in these tight budgetary times. The Foundation also argued for an increase in state alcohol taxes, with the proceeds to be used to prevent and treat abuse and addiction. In addition, the CPA hosted and participated in a recovery advocacy seminar in St. Paul.-Throughout 2014, the Center's Willam C. Moyers spoke to national conventions, state trade associations, local civic and education groups, and gatherings of people in recovery about the importance of standing up and speaking out for treatment and recovery.-In 2014, Moyers and the Center also engaged the news media in a wide variety of other policy efforts, serving as a key media spokesperson and being featured in newspapers and magazines nationwide. In addition, Moyers authored a weekly syndicated column, ""Beyond Addiction,"" that was distributed nationally. Dean Peterson, former Chief of Staff to retired Congressman Jim Ramstad, has been an energetic presence on behalf of the Foundation and the wider treatment community both in Washington D.C. and Minnesota.-Under the direction of the Hazelden Betty Ford Foundation Speakers Bureau, 34 employees presented to nearly 18,000 attendees at 123 events in 23 states on a broad range of subjects including drug trends, prevention, the opioid crisis, treatment advances, and recovery issues. Community Relations Services: -Through its community relations services, the Hazelden Betty Ford Visitors Program in Center City scheduled and conducted 30 tours for 224 individuals. Volunteers at facilities in Minnesota, Illinois, New York, Oregon and Florida donated 9,436 hours valued at $234,107.-Educational scholarships from Hazelden were awarded totaling $5,200 to students at six high schools in the Twin Cities and the surrounding Center City area. -The Foundation continues its involvement with the Partners for a Drug Free Chisago County, providing expertise, hosting meetings and allowing staff to serve on the organization's board. Publishing: -Hazelden Publishing is the leading publisher of state-of-the-art resources for preventing, treating, and managing addiction and closely related issues. Translating research into practice, we help organizations treat the whole client by offering information, guidance, tools, and support to meet their unique needs. With 141 new offerings in 2014, our publications continue to provide inspiration, guidance and encouragement to millions around the world every day. In 2014, Hazelden Publishing generated 41 new products, 45 new distributed products, 8 new services and trainings, 19 new e-books, 5 new apps, 12 translation rights, and 11 new subscriptions. If not for the Hazelden Betty Ford Foundation's mission, much of this material would not be published and available to consumers because of its limited appeal to mainstream publishers. Hazelden Publishing's materials also reach underserved populations, including many customers in the community treatment, faith-based and corrections markets.-In 2014, through its BookAid program, Hazelden sent 6,113 packages of over 18,000 products that reached the lives of more than 200,000 people through 76 libraries serving programs and institutions in need. BookAid resources were sent to individuals and organizations in the United States and around the world. Hazelden Publishing received over $40,000 in donations for the BookAid program.Hazelden Betty Ford Website: -A new website at hazeldenbettyford.org was launched in 2014 and will become the primary website of the new organization by the end of 2015. The new site is built on state-of-the-art technology and offers a personalized experience for each visitor. In addition to information about the products and services of the Hazelden Betty Ford Foundation, the site continues to provide daily inspirational readings, research findings, a bookstore, and informational articles, as well as access to career opportunities, webinars, a social community, an alcohol screening tool, and online professional education. Over 7 million visits were recorded across all Hazelden Betty Ford Foundation websites in 2014. -The Hazelden Betty Ford Foundation's Social Community-an online network for people interested in recovery from substance use disorders-features blogs, discussion boards, a book club, and online meetings that are accessible to anyone from anywhere in the world. By year's end, 43,000 people had joined the community since its inception 14 years ago. The Hazelden Betty Ford Foundation's Facebook, Twitter, YouTube, and LinkedIn accounts, along with our award-winning mobile apps, provide additional access to recovery resources, providing daily inspiration, information, and fellowship to our diverse constituencies.Resource Center: -In 2014, Hazelden Betty Ford Foundation's Resource Center received more than 203,000 calls and more than 11,000 online inquiries from people seeking information, assistance and products related to addiction issues. Part of the Resource Center's work is connecting people with the help they need, in the form of products, services and free information. For those in need of resources beyond what the Foundation provides, the Resource Center searches its database of more than 30,000 agencies to locate other possible assistance."
