AHSSHC has taken steps to ensure that processes are in place to satisfy the rebuttable presumption of reasonableness standard as set forth in Treasury Regulation 53.4958-6 with respect to its active executive-level positions. The AHSSHC Board Compensation Committee (the Committee) serves as the governing body for all executive compensation matters.

Voting members of the Committee include only individuals who serve on the Board as independent representatives of the community, who hold no employment positions with AHSSHC and who do not have relationships with any of the individuals whose compensation is under their review that impacts their best independent judgment as fiduciaries of AHSSHC. The Committee's role is to review and approve all components of the executive compensation plan of AHSSHC. As an independent governing body with respect to executive compensation, it should be noted that the Committee will often confer in executive sessions on matters of compensation policy and policy changes. In such executive sessions, no members of management of AHSSHC are present. The Committee is advised by an independent third party compensation advisor. This advisor prepares all the benchmark studies for the Committee. Compensation levels are benchmarked with a national peer group of other not-for-profit healthcare systems and hospitals of similar size and complexity to AHS and each of its affiliated entities. The following principles guide the establishment of individual executive compensation: - The salary of the President/CEO of AHS will not exceed the 40th percentile of comparable salaries paid by similarly situated organizations; and - Other executive salaries shall be established using market medians. The compensation philosophy, policies, and practices of AHSSHC are consistent with the organization's faith-based mission and conform to applicable laws, regulations, and business practices. As a faith-based organization sponsored by the Seventh-day Adventist Church (the Church), AHSSHC's philosophy and principles with respect to its executive compensation practices reflect the conservative approach of the Church's mission of service and were developed in counsel with the Church's leadership."

In recognition of the contribution that each executive makes to the success of AHS, AHS provides to eligible executives participation in the AHS Executive FLEX Benefit Program (the Plan). The purpose of the Plan is to offer eligible executives an opportunity to elect from among a variety of supplemental benefits, including deferred compensation benefits taxable under Internal Revenue Code (IRC) Section 457(f), to individually tailor a benefits program appropriate to each executive's needs. The Plan provides eligible participants a pre-determined benefits allowance credit that is equal to a percentage of the executive's base pay from which is deducted the cost of mandatory and elective employee benefits. The pre-determined benefits allowance credit percentage is approved by the AHSSHC Board Compensation Committee, an independent committee of the Board of Directors of AHSSHC. Any funds that remain after the cost of mandatory and elective benefits are subtracted from the annual pre-determined benefits allowance are contributed, at the employee's option, to either an IRC 457(f) deferred compensation account or to an IRC 457(b) eligible deferred compensation plan. Upon attainment of age 65, all previous 457(f) deferred amounts are paid immediately to the participant and any future employer contributions are made quarterly from the Plan directly to the participant. The Plan documents define an employee who is eligible to participate in the Plan to generally include the Chief Executive Officers of AHS entities and Vice Presidents of all AHS entities whose base salary is at least $218,000. The Plan provides for a class year vesting schedule (2 years for each class year) with respect to amounts accumulated in the executive's 457(f) deferred compensation account. Distributions could also be made from the executive's 457(f) deferred compensation account upon attainment of age 65 or upon an involuntary separation. The account is forfeited by the executive upon a voluntary separation. In addition to the Plan, AHS has instituted a defined benefit, non-tax-qualified deferred compensation plan for certain executives who have provided lengthy service to AHS and/or to other Seventh-Day Adventist Church hospitals or health care institutions. Participation in the plan is offered to AHS executives on a prorata schedule beginning with 20 years of service as an employee of AHS and/or another hospital or health care institution controlled by the Seventh-Day Adventist Church and who satisfy certain other qualifying criteria. This supplemental executive retirement plan (SERP) was designed to provide eligible executives with the economic equivalent of an annual income beginning at normal retirement age equal to 60% of the average of the participant's three, five or seven highest years of base salary from AHS active employment inclusive of income from all other Seventh-Day Adventist Church healthcare employer-financed retirement income sources and investment income earned on those contributions through social security normal retirement age as defined in the plan. The number of years included in highest average compensation is determined by the individual's year of entry to the SERP and by the individual's year of entry to the AHS Executive FLEX Benefit Program.

The process/policy for setting presidential compensation at Mercyhurst University is the following. At Mercyhurst University, the Committee on Compensation of the Board of Trustees is responsible for the compensation-setting function of the President. The committee consists of no fewer than three trustees appointed by the chair of the board, who will also name a chair and vice chair. These trustees must be independent, without a conflict of interest as it relates to this area, and may not have been employed by Mercyhurst University in the last five years. No member may be an executive of Mercyhurst University. In May, the Committee on Compensation evaluates the President's performance for the fiscal year-end May. The committee reviews the president's performance in light of the university's goals and objectives. In addition the committee reviews the President's compensation to ensure that his compensation complies with rules governing tax exempt universities described in the Internal Revenue Code, complies with compensation rules and regulations promulgated by any other regulatory agency or legislative authority and aligns appropriately with compensation levels at comparable universities. They use this review as the basis for recommendations on the president's compensation. The committee negotiates the terms of the (new or renewed) president's contract and increases in compensation level, elements of the compensation package, and structure. The recommendation is then presented for approval of the full board. At this time the committee also requests the President to provide a list of goals and objectives for the institution and for the office of the president for the forthcoming year. This document provides the baseline used in evaluating the performance of the president 10 to 12 months later. This request is followed up in both October and February by a request of the Committee on Compensation to the President to prepare a report that assesses progress on each of the annual and standing objectives presented in the May report."

The university did not utilize chartered flights for air travel. Extensive travel is required of the position of president and s/he is encouraged by the Board of Trustees to travel business or first class on flights of two hours or more. This provision is made for several reasons: (1) business or first-class travel allows for the most flexibility to accommodate a travel schedule that must frequently be altered, often at the last minute to accommodate donors' schedules, add critical meetings, or to take advantage of other strategic opportunities for the university; (2) circumstances sometimes call for the president to return to campus without notice, or to remain on campus when a trip was planned, and first or business-class travel best accommodates these changing conditions; and (3) the Board of Trustees wishes the president to be at his or her best performance representing and seeking funding for the university during often grueling travel itineraries for meetings frequently critical to the institution's well-being. This accommodation was not treated as taxable compensation. HOUSING ALLOWANCE OR RESIDENCE FOR PERSONAL USE: The president is required to live on campus in the university-owned president's residence where he regularly holds university events.
