In addition, St. Olaf College provided support in the form of compensation to staff involved in these activities and postage for mailings sent to legislators. The primary focus of efforts was to communicate to representatives their continued interest in receiving grants for educational activities.The influence to legislation through other activities is derived from the dues St. Olaf College pays to the Minnesota Private College Council (MPCC). St. Olaf College is a member of MPCC, an organization described in section 501(c)(4) of the Internal Revenue Code. MPCC is an association of private nonprofit institutions of higher education that serves a variety of its members' shared needs, including, but not only, nonpartisan and non-electoral advocacy for public policy that meets students' needs and advances the interests of private higher education. St. Olaf College paid membership dues to MPCC in the amount of $161,544 during the taxable year.MPCC has divided its expenses for its taxable year into two groups. Group 1 consists of those expenses that did not in any way support attempts to influence legislation within the meaning of section 501(c)(3) of the Internal Revenue Code (""lobbying""), and Group 2 consists of all other expenses. Group 2 includes many expenses, such as personnel costs, that supported both lobbying and nonlobbying activities. MPCC did not attempt to allocate the Group 2 expenses between lobbying and nonlobbying activities. MPCC has determined that the amount of the Group 2 expenses represents 71.55% of the amount of the dues that MPCC collected in the same taxable year. Assuming that all Group 2 expenses were paid from member dues, and allocating those expenses pro rata based on the dues paid by each member, $115,585 of St. Olaf College's dues were used to pay Group 2 expenses. The amount of lobbying expenses paid from St. Olaf College's dues was significantly less than that amount."

201502129349301030,410682405,"Part II-B, Line 1:","In 2014, the effort to confront the growing prescription pain pill and heroin epidemic was a key initiative of Hazelden Betty Ford's Center for Public Advocacy. By informing audiences and key stakeholders about important issues like these, Hazelden Betty Ford's goal is to improve the formulation of policy at its earliest stage, thereby improving access to treatment for people in need and supporting their continued recovery after treatment. These efforts are coordinated through the organization's Center for Public Advocacy. The Center also supports each Hazelden Betty Ford facility, its employees and other interested stakeholders by responding to requests and providing them with information on relevant federal, state and local legislation. The Center participated in several public forums on the dangers of prescription painkiller misuse. The Center hosted some of these events and collaborated on others, providing speakers and information as part of our focus on influencing public perception and awareness through education about addiction, treatment and recovery. Hazelden Betty Ford's advocacy and policy efforts also focused on advocating for robust implementation of the federal ""parity"" law, which expands access to addiction treatment through private health care insurance. The ""Paul Wellstone and Pete Domenici Mental Health and Addiction Equity Act"" ends discrimination by insurance companies against people who need addiction treatment. The Center for Public Advocacy plays a leading role in the Parity Implementation Coalition (PIC), which advocates for expansive interpretations of the federal implementing regulations for the law. In conjunction with the PIC, the CPA produced an online ""toolkit"" that is posted on the Hazelden Betty Ford website to help people understand and access their rights under the law. The CPA also continues to monitor the implementation of the law. Ahead of implementation, Hazelden Betty Ford's Center for Public Advocacy produced an 8-page consumer brochure to inform patients, their families, businesses large and small and civic organizations about the changes in coverage. Hazelden Betty Ford was also active in the implementation of the Affordable Care Act (ACA). The new law contains a number of benefits for addiction consumers and providers. Hazelden Betty Ford is part of the Coalition for Whole Health, a group of addiction and mental health organizations that raised awareness of substance abuse treatment and recovery issues in the debate and during the implementation phase, as well as of state-based groups working to implement the federal law at the state level. In addition, the Hazelden Betty Ford Foundation hosts a free online Social Community, which provides an easily accessible forum for people all over the country and world to gather, gain information on addiction and recovery, and share with others their experience, strength and hope. Finally, the Center for Public Advocacy hosted free public screenings and discussions of the film The Anonymous People, which performs a public service for those in recovery from addiction by highlighting successful recovery stories and empowering those in recovery to speak out, share their own stories and advocate for recovery-favorable policies. The Social Community hosted a free online screening of the film as well. Over 5,700 people logged on to watch, and many of them participated in an online discussion after the film featuring several experts. Not all of the center's efforts were focused on national public policy. In Minnesota, Hazelden Betty Ford has played a leading role with state lawmakers in making the case for the efficacy and cost-effectiveness of substance abuse treatment in these tight budgetary times. Hazelden Betty Ford also argued for an increase in state alcohol taxes, with the proceeds to be used to prevent and treat alcohol abuse and addiction. In addition, the CPA hosted and participated in a recovery advocacy seminar in St. Paul. Hazelden Betty Ford regularly receives requests for information on addiction, treatment and recovery issues from federal, state and local legislatures and governments. Membership in associations related to the addiction field and the preservation of the services we provide allows Hazelden Betty Ford to join forces with others sharing similar concerns and interests. Hazelden Betty Ford tapped its resources to influence policy and public attitudes by engaging the news media and collaborating with grassroots community-based organizations across the country on local, state and federal policy issues. And under the direction of the Hazelden Betty Ford Speakers Bureau, which is part of the Center for Public Advocacy, a wide range of employees presented at events throughout the country on a broad range of subjects including drug trends, prevention, the opioid crisis, treatment advances, and recovery issues. Hazelden Betty Ford's Center for Public Advocacy advances these Guiding Principles: Addiction to alcohol and other drugs is a chronic illness and a public health problem affecting all Americans; addiction is a treatable illness with measurable outcomes of success, and Hazelden Betty Ford's treatment modality offers people the best opportunity to find lifelong recovery; standardized treatment outcomes are integral to ensuring that people receive proper care. These outcome standards must also help to define the treatment field's role in the continuum of health care services at the state and federal level; all people with addiction disease deserve to find recovery through a level of treatment and related services that is appropriate to meet their individual needs; the stigma of addiction is a major barrier to recovery; access to care will improve by ending discrimination against people with this illness."

201531319349302678,410694747,"Schedule C, Part II-B, Line 1","College Relations occasionally contact legislators to express the College's views on pending legislation which would affect the College. Costs incurred in connection with these activities are insignificant and no separate account is made for these costs. In addition, students participate in a volunteer activity sponsored by the Minnesota Private Council (MPCC) called ""Day at the Capital"" to discuss the importance of the State Grant Program with representatives. Costs incurred by the College to support this program are De minimus. Carleton College is a member of Minnesota Private College Council (MPCC), an organization described in section 501(c)(4) of the Internal Revenue Code. MPCC is an association of private nonprofit institutions of higher education that serves a variety of its members' shared needs, included, but not only, nonpartisan and non-electoral advocacy for public policy that meets students' needs and advances the interest of private higher education. Carleton College paid member dues to MPCC in the amount of $127,890 during the taxable year. MPCC has divided its expenses for its taxable year ending June 30, 2014 into two groups. Group 1 consists of those expenses that did not in any way support attempts to influence legislation within the meaning of section 501(c)(3) of the Internal Revenue Code ('lobbying""), and Group 2 consists of all other expenses. Group 2 includes many expenses such as personnel costs that support both lobbying and nonlobbying activities. MPCC did not attempt to allocate the Group 2 expenses between lobbying and nonlobbying activities. MPCC has determined that the amount of the Group 2 expenses represents 71.55% of the amount of dues that MPCC collected in the same taxable year. Assuming that all Group 2 expenses were paid from member dues, and allocating those expenses pro rata based on the dues paid by each member, $91,505 of Carleton College's dues were used to pay Group 2 expenses. The amount of lobbying expenses paid from Carleton College's dues was significantly less than that amount."
