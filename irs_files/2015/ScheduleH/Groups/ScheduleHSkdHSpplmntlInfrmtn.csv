(UVM MEDICAL CENTER) LISTED IN SECTION A AND SECTION D, UVM MEDICAL CENTER OPERATES 29 ADDITIONAL CLINIC SITES AROUND ITS SERVICE AREA. EACH OF THESE SITES IS COVERED UNDER THE UVM Medical Center HOSPITAL LICENSE. ALL LISTED OR NON-LISTED FACILITIES OPERATED BY UVM Medical Center OR ITS SUBSIDIARIES FOLLOW ALL OF THE SAME POLICIES AND PROCEDURES AS THE UVM Medical Center. SCHEDULE H, PART V, LINE 3 UVM MEDICAL CENTER took into account input from persons who represent the community we serve in many different ways. Interviews with seventeen key leaders in our community were completed in the initial phase of the work, with the leaders answering questions about healthy communities, unmet needs, important health issues, barriers, and the range of available community services and they offered recommendations for improving the quality of life for residents. These leaders were selected based on various age groups served (seniors, children, adults, families, for example) as well as a mix of subject areas (low-income, refugees, mental health, substance abuse, for example). The Leaders represented: human service agencies (C.I.D.E.R., HUNGER FREE VERMONT, MILTON FAMILY CENTER, SPECTRUM, UNITED WAY OF CHITTENDEN COUNTY, VISITING NURSE ASSOCIATION OF CHITTENDEN AND GRAND ISLE COUNTIES), state departments of health, federally qualified community health centers (COMMUNITY HEALTH CENTERS OF BURLINGTON), schools (WINOOSKI SCHOOL DISTRICT), law enforcement (BURLINGTON POLICE DEPARTMENT), state agencies (VERMONT DEPARTMENT OF HEALTH, VERMONT AGENCY OF HUMAN SERVICES, VERMONT OFFICE OF MINORITY HEALTH), local funders (UNITED WAY OF CHITTENDEN COUNTY, VERMONT HEALTH FOUNDATION), health care, mental health care (HOWARD CENTER), youth services (HOWARD CENTER, SPECTRUM, MILTON FAMILY CENTER) and senior services (VISITING NURSE ASSOCIATION OF CHITTENDEN AND GRAND ISLE COUNTIES).

Schedule H Part V Section B Line 5c Condensed Versions of the Community Health Needs Assessment have been placed throughout the health system for viewing by visitors and patients. Schedule H Part V Section B Line 12i Wheaton Franciscan Healthcare's Financial Assistance Policy reviews assets, and limits the equity in a patient's home to no more than $150,000 and also limits liquid assets (such as cash in bank accounts) to no more than $50,000. Beyond that, assets for patients who will potentially qualify under our Financial Assistance Policy are not reviewed in detail. Additionally, provided that a Medicare patient shows financial need, they are eligible for charity care on any out of pocket expenses they may incur. Schedule H Part V Section B Line 14g Wheaton Franciscan Healthcare takes several proactive approaches to make our patients aware of our financial assistance policy. In addition to our policy being posted on our website and available to anyone who requests one, there is abundant signage throughout all of our facilities explaining our financial assistance policy and how to obtain the actual policy, if so desired. Notices regarding the availability of financial assistance are displayed in highly visible locations where there is a significant volume of inpatient or outpatient traffic such as in patient admitting and registration areas (both inpatient and outpatient settings), physician offices, and emergency departments. Brochures describing the policy are available in the same locations, and the policy is discussed at the time of registration or pre-registration for those identified with a need. Lastly, our patient statements also include notifications about the availability of financial assistance and a phone number to call for more information. Schedule H Part V Section B Lines 15-18: Internal policies would not support any actions listed in Schedule H Section B Lines 16-17 commencing until after a patient's eligibility under our financial assistance policy is determined. However, Wheaton Franciscan Healthcare performs credit agency reporting and commencements of lawsuits on an as needed basis, but only after a patient's eligibility under our financial assistance policy can be determined. Please note, Wheaton Franciscan Healthcare's regular practices include performing all items as listed in Question #18 prior to sending an account to collection, but because Questions 16-17 have been left blank, our interpretation of Question 18 is that it does not apply and therefore it has also been left blank."
201501289349301235,231352222,"Part V, Line 3 - Account Input from Person Who Represent the Community","In the early 1990s, WellSpan Health-York Hospital began developing new ways of working more closely with its communities. The first Community Needs Health Assessment for York County was completed in 1994, with subsequent assessments conducted in 1997, 2000, 2005, 2008 and 2012. These are led by the county health coalition, Healthy York County Coalition, which we support and are done collaboratively with other hospitals and community partners. The assessments evaluate the health of York County as a whole, and often target specific geographic or demographic segments for further study, such as the City of York or youth. Gathering data is one component of the community health needs assessment process and, as a community, is used at public meetings and forums to identify priorities for the community. These involve stakeholders from health and human services, government, business, and other sectors. Our system-wide planning committee, which includes York Hospital Board members, dedicates a meeting on this topic and the priorities identified are used to define our organization's community health objectives in its annual plan. The Community Health Needs Assessment is distributed and utilized broadly in the community and provides other organizations, as well as our own, with a more data-driven picture of the issues and needs facing our community. Our focus is to understand the health status and behaviors of those residing in York County, prioritize results and identify community needs, and respond to those needs through the implementation of evidence-based strategies. In the recent 2012 Assessment, 1004 York County adults were interviewed and served as a sample of the patients with whom our organization daily interacts. These individuals are geographically distributed across 48 zip codes and represent the diversity - age, gender, race/ethnicity, educational background, and socioeconomic status - of the community our organization serves. The 2012 CHNA process was led by a Community Health Assessment Planning Committee, a multidisciplinary collaborative comprised of at least twelve agencies interested in the health needs of the community, including:Two acute care facilities One integrated health care delivery systemTwo county-level health coalitionsA local Federally Qualified Health Center (FQHC)The local city health bureauA local behavioral health counseling agencyA local United Way branchArea colleges and universitiesA non-profit community foundationHistorically, Planning Committee members contribute in-kind staff hours to the Community Health Needs Assessment process, utilize data to integrate priority interventions into their respective organizational plans, and assist with disseminating results to the community at-large. Except for the Healthy York County Coalition and participating colleges and universities, member organizations also financially support the community health needs assessment process, including a contractual agreement with an opinion research department at a local college to collect and analyze data, and generate necessary reports. Health coalition staff time spent during the assessment process and in monitoring this contract is considered an in-kind contribution.When initially convened, Planning Committee members determined deliverables to be included in a Request for Applications (RFA) to fund an entity that would conduct the assessment, analyze results, and summarize the findings. Responsibility for recent community health needs assessments was shared between both the Healthy York County Coalition and its sister coalition in Adams County, Healthy Adams County, to maximize economies of scale and identify shared priorities across the region. However, separate reports are generated to demonstrate respective community priorities and to meet regulatory requirements. The CHNA typically engages two components - primary data collection through implementation of the Behavioral Risk Factor Surveillance System (BRFSS) and secondary data collection available through online state or national level resources. Members of the Planning Committee partnered with the funded CHNA research entity to finalize BRFSS questions and approve the identified sample size. For the 2012 CHNA, the Planning Committee elected to correlate community health results with potential disparities (e.g. age, geographic area, poverty, race/ethnicity) to obtain additional detail about community needs. Previous CHNAs have included qualitative data obtained through focus group results on key topics (e.g. behavioral health, substance abuse). The CHNA process is continuous in that, while prior assessment strategies are being implemented, planning for the next Community Health Needs Assessment is underway. The makeup of the 2015 CHNA Planning Committee is similar to that of the 2012 committee, and represents several agencies including those who represent the community, medically underserved individuals, and special populations. A consultant to conduct the CHNA has been identified and secured, with the intent to begin data collection in the fall of 2014 and release results at a community forum in June 2015."

201501289349301235,231352222,"Part V, Line 5c - Description of Making Needs Assessment Widely Available","In 2012, Planning Committee members elected to disseminate CHNA results and establish priorities for the community at-large and in their respective organizations at a local Health Summit held in June 2012. CHNA findings were also distributed through smaller organizational forums and in press releases. Health summits have demonstrated efficacy to convene a larger group of interested parties including: community-based organizations (YMCA/YWCA); faith communities; healthcare insurers and providers; law enforcement agencies; local school districts; social service organizations, and; the general public to brainstorm about how to effect community change that improves health status and encourages positive health behaviors. As with past assessments, the lead researcher for the 2012 CHNA served as the keynote speaker and presented the overall results. A combination of general and breakout sessions were then employed to identify priorities and associated programmatic opportunities. The 2012 CHNA provided the most robust data, to date, and has enabled our organization to better integrate its results into our annual organizational and entity-level planning processes. Our system-wide Community Benefit Council, comprised of representation from both acute care facilities, and service line and corporate leadership, reviewed the CHNA results and identified four key priorities for the organization, including each of our three hospitals: adult overweight/obesity; avoidance of healthcare because of cost; depression, and; tobacco use. CHNA results continue to be shared at varying levels of our organization and are foundational to the creation of entity-level objectives and associated evaluation indicators in our community health implementation strategy. Our CHNA was finalized and made available to the public in fiscal year 2013. The implementation strategy for WellSpan Health (The WellSpan Community Health Improvement Plan) was developed during fiscal year 2013 and is attached to this return. Results from the CHNA are available on the Healthy York County Coalition website (www.healthyyork.org) and the WellSpan Health website (www.wellspan.org) and also upon request."
201501289349301235,231352222,"Part V, Line 7 - Explanation of Needs Not Addressed and Reasons Why","Public health research recommends that a root cause approach be utilized to address many chronic disease, diabetes, respiratory ailments, and overweight/obesity. A focus on improving healthy eating and physical activity behaviors and reducing tobacco use has demonstrated efficacy in reducing the impact of various chronic conditions. A few cardiovascular indicators were ranked high by Community Benefit Council members, but not selected as priorities. These include those who have high blood pressure and high cholesterol, and those who have been told that they have heart disease, heart attack, or stroke risk indicators. Council members felt that the root causes of these conditions - unhealthy eating, physical inactivity, and tobacco use - were already part of the selected priorities - adult overweight/obesity and tobacco use."
201501289349301235,231352222,"Part V, Line 14g - Other Means Hospital Facility Publicized the Policy","Our organization maintains its commitment to improving access to care, based on the community health needs assessment's prioritization of medical, dental and oral health access as high. A key element of our strategy in addressing this need is to reach beyond simply informing patients about our patient assistance policies to proactively identifying patients without access and connecting them to available public and community programs. Outreach is evident through Community Health Workers and health coaches, who actively seek out patients and community members and focus on meeting them where they are, working through both medical and social needs. WellSpan also sponsors case managers within Healthy York Network (HYN) to support patient enrollment in public programs (i.e., Medicaid), health insurance marketplace options or in its own HYN discounted care program, which is based on the charity care guidelines of health care providers. In this time of healthcare reform, Healthy York Network focuses on communicating changes clearly to members and provides support in directing members to the health insurance marketplace and other resources. Finally, through a multi-year initiative to ensure awareness among all people who qualify for charity care and financial assistance, our website has been updated, our enrollment processes and late bill communications have been simplified, the provision and availability of financial support resources at high visibility care sites has improved, and our partnership with our local Federally Qualified Health Center (FQHC) for early identification and qualification of patients has been strengthened."

This was accomplished by conducting 25 Key Informant Interviews, as well as developing and disseminating a Community Health Input Questionnaire. A web-based tool was utilized to conduct the community input process; however, paper questionnaires identical to the electronic version were distributed to populations who may not have had access to the internet or generationally are more likely to complete a paper questionnaire.

For purposes of conducting the CHNA's, three of these hospitals, The Williamsport Hospital (DBA: Williamsport Regional Medical Center), Divine Providence Hospital, and Muncy Valley Hospital, share the same definition of community served, which is Lycoming County, PA. The fourth hospital that is part of the System is Soldiers & Sailors Memorial Hospital located in Wellsboro, PA, and those defined community is Tioga County, PA. The Systems approach to providing community benefit is to leverage the assets and expertise of all four hospitals to meet the needs and improve the health status of those who reside in the communities located in Lycoming and Tioga counties. Accordingly, a certain amount of collaboration between these related hospitals occurred in the development of their CHNA's and related implementation plans.

For a more detailed discussion regarding identified health needs you may view the CHNA and related Implementation Plan at www.susquehannahealth.org. Throughout the first full year subsequent to its initial CHNA, TWH, along with DPH, MVH, and SSMH have worked collaboratively to address identified health needs in Lycoming and Tioga counties. Highlights of year 1 accomplishments include, 1) the October 1, 2014 opening of a new cancer center on the campus of SSMH to increase access to cancer services in Tioga county. 2) Copnducted a transportation study, including 5 focus groups, to help identify and remedy transportation barries for cancer patients in Lycoming and Tioga counties. 3) Conducted a physician needs study to assess and document community need for various physician specialties in Lycoming and Tioga counties. 4) Based upon the physician needs study noted above, revised physician recruitment plan as to number and mis of physicians and advanced practice professionals needed. 5) Implemented a primary care extended hours clinic in Lycoming county to provide additional patient access for evening and weekend hours. 6) Increased the number of Mental Health providers in Lycoming County by adding additional per diem Psyciatrists and an additional certified registered nurse practioner to increase access to services. 7) Implemented Telesychiatry consult services with local nursing homes to increase access to Mental Health services to nursing home patients. 8) Completed plans for Mental Health facility upgrades and renovations. 9) Implemented new group therapy programs to expand acess to Mental Health services. 10) Develop a primary care physician (PCP) outreach program to educate PCP's in how to better identify Mental Health needs among their patients and better understanding the community resources that are available."

The Organization will continue to provide excellent quality of care and health literacy education to meet the wide array of health needs present among county residents. To allocate resources in an effort to impact the most pressing needs, the five key priority areas were identified. It is important to emphasize the criteria-driven approach that went into the selection of the priority issues. While the seriousness of the issue and ability to impact were the primary criteria for the quantitative ratings, additional criteria were included in the group discussion. These included the availability of proven best practices and prevention strategies, existing expertise and resources around any particular issue, and the opportunity for collective community buy-in or support to rally around a health priority. As a result, the Organization and its partners are confident that the prioritization process was a systematic, democratic, and thorough course of action. In total, nine key needs/themes were identified following the interpretation of the CHNA findings. A rationale for exclusion of the four issues not included in the final prioritized list of community needs is detailed below. Behavioral Health: The Organization currently provides both inpatient and outpatient behavioral health services to the community in collaboration with the County and other local providers that specialize in specific community-based supports, such as housing, case management, family support, respite care ,etc. Resource constraints do not permit expansion of these efforts. Drug and Alcohol Abuse: While the Organization will continue to provide supportive services to the community, as appropriate, however other providers specialize in this care and are better suited to address the initiatives related to drug and alcohol abuse in the community. Maternal Health: The Organization has many successful programs related to prenatal and maternal health which will continue to be offered to the community. Community Sustainability: The Organization will continue to support environmental responsibility and will encourage safe neighborhoods.

Utilizing guidelines set forth by the Catholic Health Association of the United States (CHA) in collaboration with VHA Inc. and Healthy Communities Institute, the Beebe CHNA process followed the following steps: Step 1: Plan and Prepare for the Assessment, Step 2: Determine the Purpose and Scope of the CHNA, Step 3: Identify Data that Describes the Health and Needs of the Community, Step 4: Understand and Interpret the Data, Step 5: Define and Validate Priorities, Step 6: Document and Communicate Results The organization felt it was imperative to collect primary data due to the limitation of servicing a relatively rural population not well characterized by solely secondary data sources. According to the Delaware Health Tracker, inaccurate data on the population at risk in small geographic areas continues to complicate epidemiologic studies in community settings. Census data are less accurate for cities or counties than for states. Therefore, an ideal approach incorporates both primary and secondary data. In order to fully incorporate the primary data elements, the CHNA team conducted focus groups, town hall meetings, stakeholder interviews, and online surveys. By gathering information from local residents and area organizations, the organization hoped to gain a better insight to the priority needs of those living in the service area. Additional data was also collected through completion of a community health survey by area residents, community based organizations and health care providers. Lastly, key informant interviews were completed with community stake holders.

Understanding that each health care system would ultimately be responsible for drafting and implementing the needs assessment and strategies, it was agreed that sharing the same methodological approach for completion of the assessment and developing strategy interventions collectively would ideally suit the needs of the residents of Sussex County. In the fall of 2012, Task Force members researched validated needs assessment tools and designed a survey and interview questionnaire in English and Spanish collaboratively. In January of 2013, outreach teams from all of the organizations involved in the Task Force began to distribute the surveys and perform interviews with stakeholders across the county. In addition, the Healthier Sussex County website was utilized to communicate regarding the Community Health Needs Assessment and served as the platform for the on-line survey tool disseminated in Sussex.

Participants were asked to share their viewpoints on:-Important health concerns in the community;-Significant service gaps in the community; -Ideas for addressing concerns and service gaps.To gauge the importance of various health concerns, respondents were asked to identify issues of community concern from a list modified from topics in Healthy People 2010. Respondents were able to enter additional concerns in an open-ended response item. Participants were also asked to review a list of services typically important to addressing health concerns. Respondents were then asked to indicate services that needed to be strengthened in terms of availability, access, or quality.

Oral health is important because it can impact general health. Multiple community organizations are engaged in providing dental care services to the uninsured.

As such Bon Secours will not be addressing dental needs at this time.Transportation: Other community organizations are better positioned to provide transportation. The Greater Richmond Transit Authority (GRTC) serves the City of Richmond and Henrico County. They have 186 buses and 40 routes. Each bus is equipped with a wheel chair lift. GRTC serves the Richmond Community Hospital campus.GRTC CARE service provides curb-to-curb public transportation to disabled individuals who may not be reasonably able to use the GRTC fixed route bus. It is also available for persons aged 80 or older. Of the four Bon Secours Richmond hospitals (St. Mary's Hospital, St. Francsis Medical Center, Richmond Community Hospital and Memorial Regional Medical Center), Richmond Community Hospital provides limited patient transportation. Patients who reside within a 10-mile radius of the hospital may utilize the patient transport van to reach the hospital campus. This service includes behavioral health patients. Lack of adequate transportation can be a barrier to accessing health care services. The Bon Secours Care-A-Van is a mobile health outreach program providing primary care services in local neighborhoods in the Richmond Community Hospital service area. The Care-A-Van contributes to the elimination of transportation as a barrier to care for uninsured patients."

An electronic survey using Survey Monkey was developed and administered by Community Health Solutions to 495 community members and partners.Individuals were invited to participate based on their ability to represent: underserved, low-income and minority population needs; needs of chronically ill patients; and awareness of healthcare needs in their respective communities. A total of 139 (28%) responded, though not all participants completed each question. Participants represented over 60 agencies from across the primary service area, including concerned citizens, faith community leaders, free clinics, physicians, elected officials and governmental servants. Participants were asked to share their viewpoints on:- Important health concerns in the community;- Significant service gaps in the community; - Ideas for addressing concerns and service gaps.To gauge importance of various health concerns, respondents were asked to identify issues of community concern from a list modified from topics in Healthy People 2010. Respondents were able to enter additional concerns in an open-ended response item. Participants were also asked to review a list of services typically important to addressing health concerns. Respondents were then asked to indicate services that needed to be strengthened in terms of availability, access, or quality. Open-ended response items were provided for participants to indicate additional service gaps in the community and ideas for addressing concerns and service gaps.Priority NeedsMultiple meetings were conducted with various constituents to assist in prioritizing needs and receiving feedback on the Community Health Needs Assessment. One of the meetings warrants additional descriptions because of its unique contribution to the process. The Bon Secours Richmond CHNA Community Review session covered all four hospitals, and was facilitated by Becky Clay Christensen with The Clay Christensen Group. This review included: Medical Directors and an Associate Medical Director covering Health Departments for four jurisdictions; Health Department Registered Nurses from two jurisdictions; a Chief Operating Officer of a Free Clinic; an Executive Director of a Federally Qualified Health Center; an Executive Director for Community Health Services; the Director of Richmond Promise Neighborhoods. In addition to these community health leaders, the following internal leaders also participated: the Senior Vice President of Sponsorship for Bon Secours Richmond; the Administrative Director for Community Health Services; the Administrative Director for Advocacy; a Manager for Evaluation and Sustainability; a Manager for Community Nutrition; two Healthy Community Liaisons. After hearing a presentation on initial findings, which included secondary and survey data, this group discussed and made ""dot choices"" by distributing dots on issues from the report and raised by the group."
201521949349300627,541744931,"Memorial Regional Medical Center, Inc.","Part V, Section B, Line 7: Dental Care/Oral HealthDental Care was identified in the CHNA community survey as a gap. Oral health is important because it can impact general health. Multiple community organizations are engaged in providing dental care services to the uninsured. They include Virginia Commonwealth University's School of Dentistry, Daily Planet, FQHC, Vernon J. Harris FQHC Dental Clinic, CrossOver Ministry and Goochland Free Clinic and Family Services. As such Bon Secours will not be addressing dental needs at this time.Transportation Other community organizations are better positioned to provide transportation. The Greater Richmond Transit Authority (GRTC) serves the City of Richmond and Henrico County. They have 186 buses and 40 routes. Each bus is equipped with a wheel chair lift. GRTC serves the Richmond Community Hospital campus.GRTC CARE service provides curb-to-curb public transportation to disabled individuals who may not be reasonably able to use the GRTC fixed route bus. It is also available for persons aged 80 or older. Of the four Bon Secours Richmond hospitals (St. Mary's Hospital, St. Francsis Medical Center, Richmond Community Hospital and Memorial Regional Medical Center), Richmond Community Hospital provides limited patient transportation. Patients who reside within a 10-mile radius of the hospital may utilize the patient transport van to reach the hospital campus. This service includes behavioral health patients. Lack of adequate transportation can be a barrier to accessing health care services. The Bon Secours Care-A-Van is a mobile health outreach program providing primary care services in local neighborhoods in the Richmond Community Hospital service area. The Care-A-Van contributes to the elimination of transportation as a barrier to care for uninsured patients."

HCDI is a consortium of organizations joined together to prioritize and address significant community health issues. Samaritan Hospital has been a member organization of HCDI since 1999. The CHNA benefited from the review and input of the members of the Community Health Needs Assessment Workgroup of the Healthy Capital District Initiative. These individuals are subject matter experts from the area county public health departments of Albany, Rensselaer, and Schenectady; and of each of the Capital Region hospitals, Albany Medical Center, St. Peter's Hospital, Sunnyview Hospital and Rehabilitation Center, St. Mary's Hospital, Samaritan Hospital, Albany Memorial and Ellis Hospital. They were joined by representatives from community based organizations, businesses, consumers, schools, academics, and disease groups for a total of 34 different organizations in our Capital Region such as Catholic Charities, Whitney M. Young, Jr. Federally Qualified Health Center (""FQHC""), Capital District Physicians Health Plan, Fidelis Care Health Plan, University of Albany School of Public Health, YMCA, Community Gardens, and senior housing organizations. Representatives of the HCDI determined the process for completing the needs assessment and reviewed the collected data. The CHNA is the result of over a year of meetings with member organizations and community input through our survey of over 3,000 residents of the Capital District. Drafts of the sections were sent to local subject matter experts for review in the health departments of Albany, Rensselaer, and Schenectady counties and in St. Peter's Health Partners, Albany Medical Center, Ellis Hospital, and Interfaith Partnership for the Homeless. Comments were addressed and changes were incorporated into the final document. The Community Health Needs Assessment was completed and approved in June 2013."

While the organization will continue to offer services addressing other pressing health needs, it felt that the increased focus on the selected areas represents the best use of resources and expertise. Other health care facilities serving our community will continue to address the other areas as well. Thus, cancer, sudden infant death, HIV, sexually transmitted diseases, unintended death, automobile deaths, suicide, childhood vaccines, and pneumonia vaccine among seniors are being worked on at both the county level and at the state level.

A hospital task force considered the data and identified areas of significant needs to be addressed, as well as areas of need unable to be addressed by the hospital. An implementation strategy was presented and adopted by the hospitals board of directors. The Implementation Strategy consists of actions the hospital intends to take to address the health need. Programs/resources the hospital plans to commit to address the health need were identified along with planned collaborations with other area organizations.1h To assure broad representation of the communitys interests, key public health and healthcare partners were engaged and consulted throughout the design and implementation phase of the 2014 CHNA. Qualitative Stakeholder Surveys were distributed to public and community health representatives who directly serve the communities interests. Sampling was monitored throughout the survey dissemination to assure a minimum threshold of respondents providing local insight to priority community health needs and opportunities. Survey outreach was conducted by the local hospital, partner healthcare facilities in the same region, the local public health liaison, and a local comprehensive community health coalition.1i The 2014 CHNA report presents findings of three sets of data, by county. The data sets include absolute indicators of health status as gathered in 2010 using BRFSS and other primary source data gathered using empirical methods; A qualitative stakeholder survey conducted in 2014 and 2014 County Health Rankings indicator set. The qualitative stakeholder survey was disseminated broadly to public health and community stakeholders who serve local populations. As such, the Community Health Needs Assessment does not provide for random assignment of survey respondents, nor does it attempt to function as a surveillance instrument. Limitations aside, taken together, the data provide a unique perspective on the health of Maine communities, with a focus on the social, environmental, and clinical factors which influence the ability of populations to lead healthy lives."

The CHNA was comprised of both quantitative and qualitative research components. A brief synopsis of the qualitative research components is included below:THOCC sought community input through Key Informant Interviews with community stakeholders. Public health and health care professionals shared knowledge and expertise about health issues, and leaders and representatives of non-profit and community-based organizations provided insight on the community served by THOCC including medically underserved, low income, and minority populations. Interviews were conducted with key community leaders. In total, 21 people participated, representing a variety of sectors including public health and medical services, non-profit and social organizations, children and youth agencies, and the business community.Name - OrganizationDr. Michael Grey - The Hospital of Central Connecticut Dr. Jeffrey Finkelstein - The Hospital of Central Connecticut Kathy Scalise -The Hospital of Central Connecticut Paul Hutcheon - Central Connecticut Health Department Sergio Lupo - New Britain Health Department Francine Truglio - New Britain Health Department Shane Lockwood - Plainville/Southington Health Department Wendy DeAngelo - Wheeler Clinic Ray Gorman - Community Mental Health Affiliate Yvette Highsmith Francis - Community Health Centers Ellen Rothberg - VNA Healthcare Pat Ciardullo - New Britain EMS Grace Damio - Hispanic Health Counsel Fatma Antar - Berlin Mosque Monsignor Daniel Plocharczyk - Sacred Heart of New Britain Stephen J.

The survey was modeled after the Center for Disease Control and Prevention's Behavioral Risk Factor Surveillance System (BRFSS) which assesses health status, health risk behaviors, preventive health practices, and health care access primarily related to chronic disease and injury. Participants were randomly selected for participation based on a statistically valid sampling frame developed by Holleran. The sampling strategy was designed to represent the service area of THOCC."

BMC also collaborated with organizations that participated in a ""Design Team"" established by the Coalition. Representatives from the Collaborative for Community Health, Inc., the Franklin Regional Council of Governments, the Massachusetts Department of Public Health, and the Springfield Department of Health and Human Services participated on this Team. Many individuals provided input for this assessment. Lists of interviewees are included in the report."
201522229349300222,042790311,Baystate Medical Center,"Part V, Section B, Line 3: Community input was gathered through interviews, a community survey, and community listening sessions. Interviews were conducted with public health experts, representatives of health, social services, or other departments or agencies, community leaders, health care providers, and persons representing the broad interests of the community. The interviews were structured to help identify the most pressing health status and access issues in the community. BMC also sought input from the public regarding the health of the community through an online and paper-based survey. A website link to the survey (in both English and Spanish) was made available from January through February 2013. Paper copies of the survey were distributed at various local organizations and clinics in multiple languages. Efforts were made to reach those without internet access as well as vulnerable populations such as racial and ethnic minorities, low-income groups, individuals with low literacy levels, and non-English speakers. The survey was publicized via flyers, social media, human services organizations, boards of health, newspapers, email listservs, and other methods. A listening session was held during which community members reviewed and discussed preliminary findings from this assessment. Discussion at the listening session was helpful in that it validated assessment findings and contributed to the prioritization process. The survey consisted of 48 questions about a range of health status and access issues and respondent demographic characteristics. 1,321 residents from the Baystate community completed the survey. Seventy-four percent of respondents were female and 49 percent were between the ages of 45 and 64. Seventy-two percent were White and 98 percent did not identify as Hispanic (or Latino). The majority of respondents reported being in good or very good overall health (70 percent), married (50 percent), employed full time (61 percent), privately insured (67 percent), and having an undergraduate degree or higher (53 percent). The majority (83 percent) of respondents speak English in the home. Spanish was the top non-English language reported. Seven percent of respondents reported that they spoke multiple languages at home. Survey responses were received from residents of 43 of the Baystate community's 51 ZIP codes. Although the survey garnered many respondents, the sample is not representative of the community and the results are not generalizable to the community as a whole. 1,321 residents in Baystate's community responded to the community survey. Key informant interviews were conducted face-to-face and by telephone by Mark Rukavina, Principal at Community Health Advisors, LLC. The interviews were designed to gain perspective into health needs in the community served by Baystate. A total of 39 local key informants, including external and internal stakeholders (those affiliated or employed by Baystate Medical Center) were interviewed during December 2012 through February 2013. In addition, 10 staff members from the Massachusetts Department of Public Health regional office in Northampton also were interviewed as a part of this assessment. These interviews were conducted using a structured questionnaire. Informants were asked to discuss community health issues and encouraged to look broadly at the social determinants of health. Interviewees were asked about issues related to health care access, changes in community population, prevalence of chronic health conditions, and health disparities. The frequency with which community health issues was mentioned and the interviewees' perceptions of the significance of each concern were assessed.The 49 stakeholders were comprised of public health experts; individuals from health or other departments and agencies; leaders or representatives of medically underserved, low-income, and minority populations; and other community members. In addition, 18 community members participated in the CHNA listening sessions."

NorthShore has a Community Relations Department, whose personnel serve as points of contact for NorthShore's involvement with community building, partnership development, program building, local governmental advocacy, and outreach activities. Community Relations has developed relationships with local and state government, public health agencies, clergy, business, civic and social service agencies, and school leaders. Through these relationships, Community Relations identified health needs in the NorthShore community by regularly attending events, meetings, community boards, coalitions, consortiums, and one-on-one engagements. NorthShore's senior leadership also regularly participate in outreach programs to local leaders. NorthShore physicians and staff also play an equally important role in identifying health trends and needs through their leadership, board participation, and involvement in local, regional, and national organizations. Each NorthShore hospital has a Community Advisory Committee (CAC) comprised of a range of community leaders representing local public health agencies, non-profit organizations serving low-income residents, faith based groups, governmental agencies, and business and civic leaders. Each hospital's CAC meets quarterly to discuss the health needs in their communities, identifying gaps in delivery of services and providing strategic recommendations to the hospital to address the identified health needs. All four hospital CACs also meet annually to address more global health and healthcare related issues, promoting discussion about policy and services at the local, state and federal levels. The following organizations were represented on the NorthShore CACs while NorthShore conducted the fiscal year 2013 CHNA: Evanston Hospital - Village of Wilmette, CJE Senior Life, Childcare Network of Evanston, McGaw YMCA, Erie Evanston/Skokie Health Center, City of Evanston, North Shore Senior Center, Kenilworth School District 38, Mather LifeWays, Evanston/Skokie School District 65, Shorefront Legacy, New Trier High School, YWCA Evanston Northshore, and Evanston Township High School.

NorthShore also conducted a community health needs focus group, consisting of community leaders and public health experts who provide social services and healthcare within NorthShore's community. Discussions during the focus group centered on what pressing health concerns were present, which healthcare resources were available and not available, and what barriers to healthcare resources existed for individuals in the community. The following organizations were represented in the focus group: Evanston Health Department, City of Evanston, New Trier High School, Kenilworth School District 38, Evanston/Skokie School District 65, North Shore Senior Center, Lake County Health Department, Lake Forest Senior Center, Tri-Con Childcare Center, Northfield Township, Northbrook Police Department, Northbrook YMCA, Skokie Health Department, Erie Family Health Center, Metropolitan Family Services, and the Northwest Suburban United Way."

HCDI is a consortium of organizations joined together to prioritize and address significant community health issues. Albany Memorial Hospital has been a member organization of HCDI since 1999. The CHNA benefited from the review and input of the members of the Community Health Needs Assessment Workgroup of the Healthy Capital District Initiative. These individuals are subject matter experts from the area county public health departments of Albany, Rensselaer, and Schenectady; and of each of the Capital Region hospitals, Albany Medical Center, St. Peter's Hospital, Sunnyview Hospital and Rehabilitation Center, St. Mary's Hospital, Samaritan Hospital, Albany Memorial and Ellis Hospital. They were joined by representatives from community based organizations, businesses, consumers, schools, academics, and disease groups for a total of 34 different organizations in our Capital Region such as Catholic Charities, Whitney M. Young, Jr. Federally Qualified Health Center (""FQHC""), Capital District Physicians Health Plan, Fidelis Care Health Plan, University of Albany School of Public Health, YMCA, Community Gardens, and senior housing organizations. Representatives of the HCDI determined the process for completing the needs assessment and reviewed the collected data. The CHNA is the result of over a year of meetings with member organizations and community input through our survey of over 3,000 residents of the Capital District. Drafts of the sections were sent to local subject matter experts for review in the health departments of Albany, Rensselaer, and Schenectady counties and in St. Peter's Health Partners, Albany Medical Center, Ellis Hospital, and Interfaith Partnership for the Homeless. Comments were addressed and changes were incorporated into the final document. The Community Health Needs Assessment was completed and approved in June 2013."

While the organization will continue to offer services addressing other pressing health needs, it felt that the increased focus on the selected areas represents the best use of resources and expertise. Other health care facilities serving our community will continue to address the other areas as well. Thus, cancer, sudden infant death, HIV, sexually transmitted diseases, unintended death, automobile deaths, suicide, child vaccines and pneumonia vaccine among seniors are being worked on at both the county level and at the state level. The two focus areas were chosen according to the results of the Community Health Needs Assessment-we looked at disease prevalence rates, which conditions affected disparate populations most, and the availability of evidence based interventions to address the problem, as directed by the NY State Prevention Agenda."

SOME OF THE PRIMARY NEEDS INCLUDE: - DECREASE CIGARETTE SMOKING AMONG ADULTS - DECREASE ADULT OBESITY - INCREASE HYPERTENSIVES WHO HAVE THEIR BLOOD PRESSURE IN CONTROL - DECREASE UNINTENDED PREGNANCY RATES - DECREASE STDS/STIS, ESPECIALLY CHLAMYDIA AND GONORRHEA RATES - IMPROVE MENTAL HEALTH AMONG ADULTS AND ADOLESCENTS THE COMMUNITY HEALTH IMPROVEMENT WORKGROUP CHOSE TO PRIORITIZE ""PREVENTING CHRONIC DISEASE"", WHICH CLEARLY INCLUDES THE TOP THREE BULLET POINTS. DUE TO LIMITED RESOURCES AND TO AVOID 'MISSION CREEP' THE HOSPITAL SYSTEMS CHOSE NOT TO ADDRESS RISKY SEXUAL BEHAVIORS AND MENTAL HEALTH PROMOTION IN THE IMPROVEMENT PLAN. REGARDING ISSUES OF RISKY SEXUAL BEHAVIOR: ALTHOUGH THE MEASURES OF SUCCESS INDICATE THAT MONROE COUNTY IS 'WORSE THAN' THE STATE AND HAS NOT REACHED THE GOALS SET IN THE NY STATE PREVENTION AGENDA, HOSPITAL LEADERS FELT THAT ALTHOUGH THIS ISSUE CERTAINLY AFFECTS THE MEMBERS IN THE HOSPITAL'S TARGET AREAS, THIS IS NOT A TOP PRIORITY FOR USE OF THE HOSPITALS' RESOURCES. HOSPITAL LEADERS FELT THEY WERE NOT THE BEST ENTITY TO ADDRESS THIS PROBLEM. IN ADDITION, THERE ARE COMMUNITY ORGANIZATIONS WHO HAVE THIS GOAL AS THEIR MISSION, AND SEVERAL INITIATIVES THAT HAVE JUST STARTED IN MONROE COUNTY THAT COULD BE QUITE IMPACTFUL. REGARDING ISSUES OF MENTAL HEALTH: ALTHOUGH MENTAL HEALTH IS ALWAYS A CONCERN AMONG THE COMMUNITY, THE COMMUNITY HEALTH IMPROVEMENT WORKGROUP FELT THAT THE DEGREE OF THE PROBLEM WAS NOT AS SEVERE AS SOME OTHER HEALTH ISSUES. ALTHOUGH MONROE COUNTY IS WORSE THAN THE STATE FOR PREVENTION AGENDA INDICATORS, THIS DIFFERENCE IS NOT SIGNIFICANT, SO MONROE COUNTY IS SOMEWHAT IN LINE WITH GOALS AND THE REST OF THE STATE.

201521349349303762,370661238,"Schedule H, Part V Sec B, Line 3, Community Served by Needs Assessment","(1) - ST. JOHN'S HOSPITAL: ST. JOHN'S HOSPITAL COMMISSIONED A SURVEY THROUGH LEEDE RESEARCH TO HELP GAUGE THE NEEDS OF THE POPULATION IN SANGAMON AND THE COLLAR COUNTIES. IN ADDITION TO THIS SURVEY AND THE RESULTING DATA, SECONDARY DATA FROM THE *BEHAVIORAL RISK FACTOR SURVEILLANCE SYSTEM, THE ILLINOIS PLANNING FOR LOCAL ASSESSMENT OF NEED (IPLAN), AND OTHER SOURCES WERE ALSO INCLUDED IN THE ASSESSMENT PROCESS. PRIMARY DATA FOR THE STUDY WAS COLLECTED BY LEEDE RESEARCH USING A TELEPHONE SURVEY WITH THE GOAL OF MEASURING COMMUNITY HEALTH, IDENTIFYING SENSITIVE HEALTH ISSUES IN THE COMMUNITY AND EXPLORING PERCEPTIONS OF HEALTH ISSUES IN THE COMMUNITY. THE SURVEY WAS DEVELOPED THROUGH WORK BETWEEN ST. JOHN'S HOSPITAL, LEEDE RESEARCH AND HOSPITAL SISTERS HEALTH SYSTEM (HSHS). THE SURVEY TOOL WAS APPROVED BY THE INTERNAL COMMUNITY BENEFIT COMMITTEE, MADE UP OF ST. JOHN'S HOSPITAL COLLEAGUES, AND THE COMMUNITY BENEFIT SUB COMMITTEE, MADE UP OF COMMUNITY STAKEHOLDERS. THE SURVEY REGION CONSISTED OF SANGAMON COUNTY AND ITS COLLAR COUNTIES. THE ONLY EXCEPTION WAS MONTGOMERY COUNTY, WHICH WAS NOT INCLUDED BECAUSE IT IS SERVED BY ANOTHER SYSTEM HOSPITAL. THESE ARE THE AREAS FROM WHICH ST. JOHN'S HOSPITAL PATIENTS MOST COMMONLY COME. A TOTAL OF 400 COMPLETED INTERVIEWS WERE CONDUCTED IN THIS STUDY. THE SAMPLE USED IN THE STUDY WAS PROVIDED BY NATIONAL SAMPLE SOURCE SURVEY SAMPLING AND WAS A REPRESENTATIVE SAMPLE OF MEMBERS IN THE TARGETED GEOGRAPHIC AREA AT THE TIME OF THE STUDY. A PROPORTIONATE STRATIFIED SAMPLE WAS USED TO GIVE THE ENTIRE SERVICE AREA EQUAL REPRESENTATION BY ZIP CODE POPULATION. USING UNLIMITED POPULATION SAMPLING, THE STUDY RESULTED IN A MAXIMUM ERROR OF +/- 4/9% BASED ON 95% CONFIDENCE. LEEDE RESEARCH COMPLETED ALL VALIDATION, REPORTING, ANALYSIS AND PRESENTATION MATERIALS. LEEDE RESEARCH REVIEWED PRELIMINARY DATA FROM THE STUDY COMPARED TO DEMOGRAPHIC INFORMATION FROM THE SERVICE AREA, AND ON THE BASIS OF THIS REVIEW, THEY DETERMINED THAT THE SAMPLE REQUIRED WEIGHTED ADJUSTMENTS TO AGE AND INCOME RATIOS. THE YOUNGER AND POPULATIONS AND LOWER INCOME LEVELS WERE UNDER-REPRESENTED IN THE OVERALL STUDY. LEEDE RESEARCH WEIGHTED THE STUDY SAMPLE BY AGE AND INCOME TO MORE ACCURATELY MATCH THE ACTUAL POPULATION OF THE SERVICE AREA. THE GOAL OF THIS WEIGHTING WAS THE IMPROVEMENT OF THE OVERALL ACCURACY OF THE INFORMATION TO BETTER IDENTIFY COMMUNITY NEEDS. THIS FORMED THE BASIS OF THE ANALYSIS OF THE SURVEY DATA. SECONDARY DATA FOR THIS ASSESSMENT WAS GATHERED FROM SOURCES SUCH AS BEHAVIORAL RISK FACTOR SURVEILLANCE SYSTEM, IPLAN AND THE ILLINOIS DEPARTMENT OF PUBLIC HEALTH (IDPH). THIS SECONDARY DATA HELPED TO INFORM CONCERNS BROUGHT UP THROUGH THE NEEDS ASSESSMENT PROCESS. AT EACH STEP OF THE PROCESS, MEMBERS OF THE INTERNAL COMMUNITY BENEFIT COMMITTEE AND COMMUNITY BENEFIT SUB COMMITTEE WERE ASKED TO REVIEW THE DATA, TOOLS AND RESULTS OF THE RESEARCH, AND THEIR INPUT WAS INCLUDED TO MAXIMIZE THE RELEVANCE AND EFFECTIVENESS OF THE RESEARCH. COMMUNITY REPRESENTATION THE AGE BREAKDOWN OF THE RESPONDENTS TO THE TELEPHONE SURVEY WAS 23.8% IN THE 18-34 GROUP, 39.1% IN THE AGES OF 35-54, 22.8% IN THE 55-74 AGE GROUP AND 14.4% OF RESPONDENTS WERE 75+. THE MAJORITY (61.0%) OF RESPONDENTS WERE MARRIED, WHILE 13.4% WERE SINGLE, 13.6% SEPARATED, 11.7% WERE DIVORCED AND 0.3% WERE WIDOWED. FIFTY-FIVE PERCENT OF RESPONDENTS HAD CHILDREN LIVING AT HOME. EIGHTY-NINE PERCENT OF RESPONDENTS WERE CAUCASIAN, WITH 5.5% AFRICAN AMERICAN AND THE REMAINDER A MIXTURE OF OTHER RACES AND MULTIRACIAL INDIVIDUALS. THIRTY-THREE PERCENT OF THE STUDY GROUP WERE HIGH SCHOOL GRADUATES OR GED HOLDERS, 20.4% HAD COMPLETED SOME COLLEGE OR A TECHNICAL SCHOOL. THREE PERCENT HAD COMPLETED A TECHNICAL DEGREE, 28.7% WERE FOUR YEAR DEGREE HOLDERS AND 13.2% HAD AN ADVANCED OR PROFESSIONAL DEGREE. THE INCOME BREAK DOWN RESULTED IN A MAJORITY OF THE POPULATION FALLING BETWEEN 35,000 AND 99,999 ANNUAL HOUSEHOLD INCOME. ABOUT 35% OF THE POPULATION WAS BELOW $35,000, AND LESS THAN 10% WAS AT $100,000 OR HIGHER. SIXTY-TWO PERCENT OF RESPONDENTS WERE FEMALE AND 37.9% WERE MALE. THE COMMUNITY BENEFIT SUB COMMITTEE ALSO REPRESENTED THE COMMUNITY IN THIS NEEDS ASSESSMENT PROCESS. THIS GROUP INCLUDES LOCAL HEALTH CARE PROVIDERS; HOSPITAL REPRESENTATIVES; PUBLIC HEALTH OFFICIALS ; COMMUNITY STAKEHOLDERS INCLUDING NONPROFIT EMPLOYEES WORKING WITH UNDERSERVED COMMUNITIES; SCHOOL BOARD AND DISTRICT REPRESENTATIVES; AND LEADERS AND REPRESENTATIVES OF UNDERSERVED, LOW-INCOME AND MINORITY POPULATIONS. PUBLIC HEALTH OFFICIALS SERVING ON THE COMMITTEE WERE ALSO ABLE TO REPRESENT THE NEEDS OF PERSONS WITH CHRONIC DISEASES. THE COMMUNITY BENEFIT SUB COMMITTEE WAS ORGANIZED TO 1) TO GUIDE AND PARTICIPATE IN THE PLANNING, DEVELOPMENT AND IMPLEMENTATION OF PROJECTS AND PROGRAMS AIMED AT IMPROVING THE HEALTH OF THE ST. JOHN'S HOSPITAL SERVICE AREA; 2) TO ADDRESS THE NEEDS OF THOSE COMMUNITIES WHERE THERE ARE DISPROPORTIONATE UNMET HEALTH NEEDS AND 3) TO ENSURE ST. JOHN'S REMAINS COMMITTED TO ITS CHARITABLE MISSION BY IMPROVING THE QUALITY OF LIVES IN SANGAMON COUNTY AND THE SURROUNDING REGION. THE COMMITTEE IS RESPONSIBLE FOR RECOMMENDING AND OVERSEEING COMMUNITY BENEFIT POLICIES AND PROGRAMS DESIGNED TO CARRY OUT THE MISSION OF ST. JOHN'S HOSPITAL TO PROVIDE EXCEPTIONAL HEALTH CARE SERVICES TO THE PEOPLE OF CENTRAL ILLINOIS. ;"

JOHN'S HOSPITAL: TWENTY TOP ISSUES WERE UNCOVERED FROM PRIMARY AND SECONDARY DATA GATHERED THROUGH THE SURVEY AND EXISTING DATA SETS INCLUDING: BLOOD PRESSURE, CHILDHOOD OBESITY, HIGH CHOLESTEROL, DIABETES, SMOKING, ASTHMA, HEART DISEASE, STROKE, FRUIT AND VEGETABLE CONSUMPTION, FAST FOOD CONSUMPTION, EXERCISE, MENTAL HEALTH, DRUG USE, DRINKING, TEEN PREGNANCY, SEXUALLY TRANSMITTED DISEASES, LACK OF MOTIVATION, LACK OF EXERCISE TOOLS, FLU SHOTS, AND BICYCLE HELMETS. BEFORE PRIORITIZING NEEDS, THE INTERNAL COMMUNITY BENEFIT COMMITTEE WAS PROVIDED A LIST OF THE TOP 20 NEEDS DERIVED FROM OUR PRIMARY AND SECONDARY DATA COLLECTION. OUR INTERNAL COMMUNITY BENEFIT COMMITTEE IS COMPRISED OF LEADERS AND PHYSICIAN EXPERTS FROM ST. JOHN'S HOSPITAL. MEMBERS GAVE INPUT THAT COMBINED VARIOUS ISSUES ACCORDING TO COMMON FACTORS, YIELDING A LIST OF TEN PRIORITIES INCLUDING: METABOLIC SYNDROME, CARDIOVASCULAR DISEASE, LIFESTYLE, ASTHMA, MENTAL HEALTH, HEALTH ENVIRONMENT, SUBSTANCE ABUSE, TEEN PREGNANCY, BICYCLE HELMETS, AND SEXUALLY TRANSMITTED INFECTIONS. THIS GROUPING OF TEN IDENTIFIED NEEDS WAS THEN SUBMITTED TO THE EXTERNAL COMMUNITY BENEFIT SUB COMMITTEE AND PRIORITIZED TO ADDRESS THE THREE TOP NEEDS BY RANKING EACH ISSUE BY MAGNITUDE, SERIOUSNESS AND FEASIBILITY. ABOUT HALF OF THE ORIGINAL NEEDS WERE COMBINED WITH OTHER PRIORITY AREAS IN ORDER TO NARROW THE LIST DOWN FROM THE ORIGINAL TWENTY AREAS OF NEED. OF THE TEN THAT WERE RANKED BY THE INTERNAL AND EXTERNAL COMMITTEES, SEVEN WERE NOT CONSIDERED A PRIMARY FOCUS FOR ST. JOHN'S HOSPITAL. THIS DECISION WAS MADE BASED ON TWO PRIMARY FACTORS: 1. THE NEED IS CURRENTLY BEING ADDRESSED BY ANOTHER ORGANIZATION IN THE COMMUNITY; AND 2. THERE IS ANOTHER ORGANIZATION WITHIN THE COMMUNITY BETTER EQUIPPED TO ADDRESS THE NEED. WHILE THE LIST BELOW WILL NOT BE AREAS OF PRIMARY FOCUS FOR ST. JOHN'S, THE HOSPITAL WILL CONTINUE TO PARTICIPATE IN EFFORTS WITH OTHER ORGANIZATIONS AS APPROPRIATE AND WHERE THE HOSPITAL CAN LEND SUPPORT. - ASTHMA REMAINS A CONCERN IN THE COMMUNITY BECAUSE SANGAMON COUNTY HAS IMPORTANT RISK FACTORS SUCH AS POPULATION DENSITY AND DEMOGRAPHICS. THE MOST IMPORTANT ACTOR AGAINST ASTHMA IS THE LOCAL PUBLIC HEALTH DEPARTMENT WHICH EDUCATES AND HELPS TO TREAT AFFECTED COMMUNITY MEMBERS. - HEALTH ENVIRONMENT: NONPROFIT GROUPS SUCH AS GENH AND OTHERS ARE WORKING TO EXPAND HEALTHY OPTIONS IN THE LOCAL AREA. - SUBSTANCE ABUSE: THE GATEWAY FOUNDATION AND THE TRIANGLE CENTER BOTH WORK TO FIGHT SUBSTANCE ABUSE IN SANGAMON COUNTY IN ADDITION TO PUBLIC HEALTH EDUCATION AND LAW ENFORCEMENT PROGRAMS. - TEEN PREGNANCY: ORGANIZATIONS LIKE THE SPRINGFIELD PREGNANCY CENTER OPERATE IN SANGAMON COUNTY AND ARE ONE OF THE MAIN SOURCES OF RELIEF FROM THIS ISSUE FOR COMMUNITY MEMBERS. - BICYCLE HELMETS: ST. JOHNS AND OTHER ORGANIZATIONS CURRENTLY PROVIDE FREE HELMETS TO CHILDREN. - SEXUALLY TRANSMITTED INFECTIONS: ORGANIZATIONS SUCH AS THE SANGAMON COUNTY DEPARTMENT OF PUBLIC HEALTH ARE PROVIDING RELIEF FROM THIS ISSUE FOR COMMUNITY MEMBERS. - MENTAL HEALTH: THE SANGAMON COUNTY DEPARTMENT OF PUBLIC HEALTH IS ONE OF THE MAIN ORGANIZATIONS FOR MENTAL HEALTH SUPPORT IN THE AREA. OVER 20 OTHER ORGANIZATIONS OR RESOURCES EXIST IN AND AROUND THE COLLAR COUNTIES INCLUDING THE NATIONAL ALLIANCE FOR THE MENTALLY ILL AND MACOUPIN COUNTY MENTAL HEALTH. DUE TO A PREVALENT NEED FOR MENTAL HEALTH SERVICES, ST. JOHN'S HOSPITAL HAS DECIDED TO PUT A GROUP IN PLACE TO LOOK AT THE EXPANSION OF INTERNAL SERVICES AND PARTNERSHIPS WITH EXTERNAL SERVICES. IT IS OUR HOPE TO BETTER POSITION THE HOSPITAL AND COMMUNITY PARTNERS TO ADDRESS MENTAL HEALTH NEEDS IN THE FUTURE. ;"
