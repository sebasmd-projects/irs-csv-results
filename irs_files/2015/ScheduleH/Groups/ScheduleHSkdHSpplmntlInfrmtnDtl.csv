The University of Miami Hospital and Anne Bates Leach Eye Hospital are reimbursed under the Medicare Prospective Payment System (PPS). For inpatient services, the reimbursement methodology is the Inpatient Prospective Payment System (IPPS), which uses the Diagnostic Related Groups (DRGS) methodology to reimburse the hospital. The DRG amounts are updated by the Medicare program annually by an updating factor. However, the amount of the updating factor is always significantly less than the actual healthcare inflation factor because the Medicare program includes a ""budget neutrality"" factor for the overall Medicare program. Thus, the hospital does not receive full reimbursement of its cost for inpatient services. For outpatient services, the reimbursement methodology is the Outpatient Prospective Payment System (OPPS), which uses ambulatory payment classifications (APCS) to reimburse the hospital. The APC amounts are updated by the Medicare program annually by an updating factor. However, the amount of the updating factor is always significantly less than the actual healthcare inflation factor because the Medicare program includes a ""budget neutrality"" factor for the overall Medicare program. Thus, the hospital does not receive full reimbursement for its cost for outpatient services. The University of Miami Hospital and Clinics is a cancer specialty hospital and, as such, is cost based reimbursed for both inpatient and outpatient services. For inpatient services, the limit is the TEFRA target limit. The hospital, on occasion, exceeds the target rate and does not receive full cost reimbursement. The TEFRA target amount is updated by the Medicare program annually by the TEFRA updating factor. However, the amount of the TEFRA updating factor is always significantly less than the actual healthcare inflation factor because the Medicare program includes a ""budget neutrality"" factor for the overall Medicare program. For outpatient services, the limit is the payment to cost ratio (PCR). The PCR was established using a base year, which was 1996, at a rate of 85.5% of cost. The PCR for all exempt cancer centers was 91% through 12/31/13, and then 89% from 1/1/14 to 5/31/14; therefore, the hospital currently does not receive payment for a range of 9% to 11% of its outpatient cost."

201521269349301337,520491660,COMMUNITY INFORMATION,"PART VI, LINE 4 MEDSTAR HARBOR HOSPITAL'S COMMUNITY BENEFIT SERVICE AREA IS DEFINED AS ZIP CODE 21225, THE SAME ZIP CODE IN WHICH THE HOSPITAL IS LOCATED. WITHIN THAT AREA, THE FOCUS IS ON THE CHERRY HILL COMMUNITY, MEDSTAR HARBOR'S CLOSEST NEIGHBOR. CHERRY HILL IS A HISTORICALLY AFRICAN-AMERICAN NEIGHBORHOOD, WITH ROOTS GOING BACK TO THE 17TH CENTURY. AFTER WORLD WAR II, MORE THAN 600 HOUSING UNITS WERE BUILT THERE BY THE UNITED STATES WAR HOUSING ADMINISTRATION SPECIFICALLY FOR AFRICAN-AMERICAN WAR WORKERS. SHORTLY AFTER THE WAR, THESE UNITS WERE MADE INTO LOW-INCOME HOUSING. ADDITIONAL LOW-INCOME HOUSING UNITS HAVE BEEN ADDED THROUGHOUT THE YEARS, MAKING CHERRY HILL ONE OF THE LARGEST HOUSING PROJECTS EAST OF CHICAGO. U.S. CENSUS DATA FROM 2010 LISTS THE CURRENT POPULATION OF ZIP CODE 21225 AT 33,545. THE POPULATION OF CHERRY HILL IN 2010, ACCORDING TO THE BALTIMORE CITY 2011 NEIGHBORHOOD HEALTH PROFILE, WAS 8,202, AND 96 PERCENT OF CHERRY HILL RESIDENTS ARE AFRICAN-AMERICAN, AS COMPARED WITH 63.6 PERCENT OF BALTIMORE CITY AS A WHOLE. APPROXIMATELY 53 PERCENT OF CHERRY HILL HOUSEHOLDS WITH CHILDREN WERE HEADED BY A SINGLE PARENT-AGAIN, HIGHER THAN THE CITYWIDE PERCENTAGE OF 26 PERCENT. THIRTY-FOUR PERCENT OF CHERRY HILL RESIDENTS AGES 25 TO 64 DO NOT HAVE A HIGH SCHOOL EDUCATION, WHILE LESS THAN SEVEN PERCENT OF ADULTS 25 AND OLDER HAVE A BACHELOR'S DEGREE OR MORE (AMERICAN COMMUNITY SURVEY, 2005 - 2009). THE MEDIAN HOUSEHOLD INCOME FOR CHERRY HILL IN 2010 WAS $19,183, AMONG THE LOWEST OF BALTIMORE NEIGHBORHOODS. IN FACT, NEARLY 92 PERCENT OF FAMILIES IN THE NEIGHBORHOOD, EXCLUDING MARRIED COUPLE FAMILIES, EARN BELOW THE MARYLAND SELF SUFFICIENCY WAGE STANDARD. ACCORDING TO THE 2010 U.S. CENSUS, 45.1 PERCENT OF CHERRY HILL FAMILIES LIVE IN POVERTY. IN TERMS OF HEALTH CARE, THE CHERRY HILL COMMUNITY HOUSES MEDSTAR HARBOR HOSPITAL, AS WELL AS A LOCAL BRANCH OF THE FAMILY HEALTH CENTERS OF BALTIMORE, WHICH IS A FEDERALLY QUALIFIED HEALTH CENTER (FQHC) PROVIDING HEALTH CARE SERVICES ON A SLIDING FEE SCALE. IN ADDITION, BALTIMORE CITY HEALTH DEPARTMENT PROGRAMS OPERATE CITY-WIDE, AND VARIOUS MOBILE SERVICES-SUCH AS A NEEDLE EXCHANGE PROGRAM, VIOLENCE PREVENTION, MATERNAL AND INFANT NURSING, LEAD POISONING AND ABATEMENT PROGRAMS AND OTHERS-SERVE THE CHERRY HILL AREA. ACCORDING TO THE CHERRY HILL HEALTH PROFILE, PUBLISHED BY THE BALTIMORE CITY HEALTH DEPARTMENT IN PARTNERSHIP WITH THE JOHNS HOPKINS SCHOOL OF PUBLIC HEALTH IN OCTOBER 2011, THE LIFE EXPECTANCY AT BIRTH OF A CHERRY HILL RESIDENT IS 67.8, AS COMPARED TO 71.8 IN BALTIMORE CITY AS A WHOLE AND 78.6 IN THE UNITED STATES (WORLD BANK, 2011). HEART DISEASE ACCOUNTS FOR 24.6 PERCENT OF ALL DEATHS, AND CANCER ACCOUNTS FOR 17.3 PERCENT. STROKE, HIV/AIDS AND HOMICIDE ARE LESS COMMON, BUT, WHEN COMBINED, ARE ASSOCIATED WITH 20.2 PERCENT OF DEATHS IN THIS AREA. HIGH RATES OF TYPE 2 DIABETES AND HEART DISEASE, INCLUDING STROKE, ALSO OCCUR IN THIS COMMUNITY. FOR A VARIETY OF REASONS, INCLUDING THE HIGH POVERTY RATE AND LOW RATE OF HEALTH CARE INSURANCE COVERAGE, MANY CHERRY HILL RESIDENTS OFTEN USE THE MEDSTAR HARBOR EMERGENCY DEPARTMENT FOR PRIMARY CARE SERVICES. DESPITE THE CONVENIENT NEIGHBORHOOD LOCATION OF THE FQHC, MANY RESIDENTS DO NOT UTILIZE A PRIMARY CARE PHYSICIAN. TYPICALLY, A CHRONIC CONDITION, SUCH AS DIABETES OR HEART DISEASE, PRESENTS SEVERE ENOUGH SYMPTOMS TO WARRANT A TRIP TO THE EMERGENCY DEPARTMENT. IN MANY CASES, SEVERAL CO-MORBIDITIES ARE FOUND TO BE PRESENT AT THIS TIME. WITHOUT PRIMARY CARE FOLLOW-UP, HOWEVER, THESE CONDITIONS USUALLY CANNOT BE ADDRESSED FULLY IN THE TIME ALLOTTED FOR THE EMERGENT ISSUE. IN OTHER CASES, PATIENTS MAY HAVE SYMPTOMS OF A MUCH LESS SERIOUS ILLNESS-A SIMPLE COLD, FOR EXAMPLE-BUT BECAUSE THEY DO NOT HAVE A PRIMARY HEALTH CARE PROVIDER, THEY ALSO VISIT THE EMERGENCY DEPARTMENT FOR THESE AILMENTS. AS A RESULT, MANY OF THEIR MOST BASIC HEALTH NEEDS OFTEN ARE NOT MET."

MedStar Health and its healthcare facilities will: "" Treat all patients equitably, with dignity, with respect and with compassion. "" Serve the emergency health care needs of everyone who presents at our facilities regardless of a patient's ability to pay for care. "" Assist those patients who are admitted through our admissions process for non-urgent, medically necessary care who cannot pay for part of all of the care they receive. "" Balance needed financial assistance for some patients with broader fiscal responsibilities in order to keep its hospitals' doors open for all who may need care in the community. In meeting its commitments, MedStar Health's facilities will work with their uninsured patients to gain an understanding of each patient's financial resources prior to admission (for scheduled services) or prior to billing (for emergency services). Based on this information and patient eligibility, MedStar Health's facilities will assist uninsured patients who reside within the communities we serve in one or more of the following ways: "" Assist with enrollment in publicly-funded entitlement programs (e.g., Medicaid). "" Assist with consideration of funding that may be available from other charitable organizations. "" Provide charity care and financial assistance according to applicable guidelines. "" Provide financial assistance for payment of facility charges using a sliding scale based on patient family income and financial resources. "" Offer periodic payment plans to assist patients with financing their healthcare services. Each facility will post the policy, including a description of the applicable communities it serves, in each major patient registration area and in any other areas required by applicable regulations, will communicate the information to patients as required by this policy and applicable regulations and will make a copy of the policy available to all patients. Additionally, the Maryland Patient Information Sheet/MedStar's Patient Information Sheet will be provided to inpatients on admission and at time of final account billing. MedStar Health believes that its patients have personal responsibilities related to the financial aspects of their healthcare needs. The charity care, financial assistance, and periodic payment plans available under this policy will not be available to those patients who fail to fulfill their responsibilities.

201501319349301510,231352213,"SCHEDULE H, PART III, LINE 8","Medicare costs were derived from the Medicare cost report filed by the organization. Medicare underpayments and bad debt are community benefit and associated costs are includable on the Form 990, Schedule H, Part I. The organization feels that Medicare underpayments (shortfall) and bad debt are community benefit and associated costs are includable on the Form 990, Schedule H, Part I. As outlined more fully below the organization believes that these services and related costs promote the health of the community as a whole and are rendered in conjunction with the organization's charitable tax-exempt purposes and mission in providing medically necessary healthcare services to all individual's in a non-discriminatory manner without regard to race, color, creed, sex, national origin, religion or ability to pay and consistent with the community benefit standard promulgated by the IRS. The community benefit standard is the current standard for a hospital for recognition as a tax-exempt and charitable organization under Internal Revenue Code (""IRC"") 501(c)(3). The organization is recognized as a tax-exempt entity and charitable organization under 501(c)(3) of the IRC. Although there is no definition in the tax code for the term ""charitable"", a regulation promulgated by the department of the treasury provides some guidance and states that ""[t]he term charitable is used in 501(c)(3) in its generally accepted legal sense,"" and provides examples of charitable purposes, including the relief of the poor or unprivileged; the promotion of social welfare; and the advancement of education, religion, and science. Note: it does not explicitly address the activities of hospitals. In the absence of explicit statutory or regulatory requirements applying the term ""charitable"" to hospitals, it has been left to the IRS to determine the criteria hospitals must meet to qualify as IRC 501(c)(3) charitable organizations. The original standard was known as the charity care standard. This standard was replaced by the IRS with the community benefit standard which is the current standard. Charity care standard In 1956, the IRS issued Revenue Ruling 56-185, which addressed the requirements hospitals needed to meet in order to qualify for IRC 501(c)(3) status. One of these requirements is known as the ""charity care standard."" under the standard, a hospital had to provide, to the extent of its financial ability, free or reduced-cost care to patients unable to pay for it. A hospital that expected full payment did not, according to the ruling, provide charity care based on the fact that some patients ultimately failed to pay. The ruling emphasized that a low level of charity care did not necessarily mean that a hospital had failed to meet the requirement since that level could reflect its financial ability to provide such care. The ruling also noted that publicly supported community hospitals would normally qualify as charitable organizations because they serve the entire community, and a low level of charity care would not affect a hospital's exempt status if it was due to the surrounding community's lack of charitable demands. Community benefit standard In 1969, the IRS issued Revenue Ruling 69-545, which ""remove[d]"" from Revenue Ruling 56-185 ""the requirements relating to caring for patients without charge or at rates below cost."" under the standard developed in Revenue Ruling 69-545, which is known as the ""community benefit standard,"" hospitals are judged on whether they promote the health of a broad class of individuals in the community. The ruling involved a hospital that only admitted individuals who could pay for the services (by themselves, private insurance, or public programs such as Medicare), but operated a full-time emergency room that was open to everyone. The IRS ruled that the hospital qualified as a charitable organization because it promoted the health of people in its community. The IRS reasoned that because the promotion of health was a charitable purpose according to the general law of charity, it fell within the ""generally accepted legal sense"" of the term ""charitable,"" as required by Treas. Reg. 1.501(c)(3)-1(d)(2). The IRS ruling stated that the promotion of health, like the relief of poverty and the advancement of education and religion, is one of the purposes in the general law of charity that is deemed beneficial to the community as a whole even though the class of beneficiaries eligible to receive a direct benefit from its activities does not include all members of the community, such as indigent members of the community, provided that the class is not so small that its relief is not of benefit to the community. The IRS concluded that the hospital was ""promoting the health of a class of persons that is broad enough to benefit the community"" because its emergency room was open to all and it provided care to everyone who could pay, whether directly or through third-party reimbursement. Other characteristics of the hospital that the IRS highlighted included the following: its surplus funds were used to improve patient care, expand hospital facilities, and advance medical training, education, and research; it was controlled by a board of trustees that consisted of independent civic leaders; and hospital medical staff privileges were available to all qualified physicians. Medicare underpayments and bad debt are community benefit and associated costs are includable on the Form 990, Schedule H, Part I. The American Hospital Association (""AHA"") feels that Medicare underpayments (shortfall) and bad debt are community benefit and thus includable on the Form 990, Schedule H, Part I. This organization agrees with the AHA position. As outlined in the aha letter to the IRS dated August 21, 2007 with respect to the first published draft of the new Form 990 and Schedule H, the AHA felt that the IRS should incorporate the full value of the community benefit that hospitals provide by counting Medicare underpayments (shortfall) and bad debt as quantifiable community benefit for the following reasons: - PROVIDING CARE FOR THE ELDERLY AND SERVING MEDICARE PATIENTS IS AN ESSENTIAL PART OF THE COMMUNITY BENEFIT STANDARD. - MEDICARE, LIKE MEDICAID, DOES NOT PAY THE FULL COST OF CARE. RECENTLY, MEDICARE REIMBURSES HOSPITALS ONLY 92 CENTS FOR EVERY DOLLAR THEY SPEND TO TAKE CARE OF MEDICARE PATIENTS. THE MEDICARE PAYMENT ADVISORY COMMISSION (""MEDPAC"") IN ITS MARCH 2007 REPORT TO CONGRESS CAUTIONED THAT UNDERPAYMENT WILL GET EVEN WORSE, WITH MARGINS REACHING A 10-YEAR LOW AT NEGATIVE 5.4 PERCENT. - MANY MEDICARE BENEFICIARIES, LIKE THEIR MEDICAID COUNTERPARTS, ARE POOR. MORE THAN 46 PERCENT OF MEDICARE SPENDING IS FOR BENEFICIARIES WHOSE INCOME IS BELOW 200 PERCENT OF THE FEDERAL POVERTY LEVEL. MANY OF THOSE MEDICARE BENEFICIARIES ARE ALSO ELIGIBLE FOR MEDICAID -- SO CALLED ""DUAL ELIGIBLES."" THERE IS EVERY COMPELLING PUBLIC POLICY REASON TO TREAT MEDICARE AND MEDICAID UNDERPAYMENTS SIMILARLY FOR PURPOSES OF A HOSPITAL'S COMMUNITY BENEFIT AND INCLUDE THESE COSTS ON FORM 990, SCHEDULE H, PART I. MEDICARE UNDERPAYMENT MUST BE SHOULDERED BY THE HOSPITAL IN ORDER TO CONTINUE TREATING THE COMMUNITY'S ELDERLY AND POOR. THESE UNDERPAYMENTS REPRESENT A REAL COST OF SERVING THE COMMUNITY AND SHOULD COUNT AS A QUANTIFIABLE COMMUNITY BENEFIT. Both the AHA and this organization also feel that patient bad debt is a community benefit and thus includable on the Form 990, Schedule H, Part I. There are compelling reasons that patient bad debt should be counted as quantifiable community benefit as follows: - a significant majority of bad debt is attributable to low-income patients, who, for many reasons, decline to complete the forms required to establish eligibility for hospitals' charity care or financial assistance programs. A 2006 congressional budget office (""cbo"") report, nonprofit hospitals and the provision of community benefits, cited two studies indicating that ""the great majority of bad debt was attributable to patients with incomes below 200% of the federal poverty line."" - the report also noted that a substantial portion of bad debt is pending charity care. Unlike bad debt in other industries, hospital bad debt is complicated by the fact that hospitals follow their mission to the community and treat every patient that comes through their emergency department, regardless of ability to pay. Patients who have outstanding bills are not turned away, unlike other industries. Bad debt is further complicated by the auditing industry's standards on reporting charity care. Many patients cannot or do not provide the necessary, extensive documentation required to be deemed charity care by auditors. As a result, roughly 10% of bad debt is pending charity care. - the cbo concluded that its findings ""support the validity of the use of uncompensated care [bad debt and charity care] as a measure of community benefits"" assuming the findings are generalizable nationwide; the experience of"
201501319349301510,231352213,"SCHEDULE H, PART III, LINE 9B","Accounts considered to be charity care are not included in the bad debt expense, but rather, are accounted for as an allowance against the organization's patient service revenue. St. Luke's financial assistance program St. Luke's is a non-profit organization dedicated to the care and treatment of the sick and the prevention of illness. The first consideration in the admission and placement or treatment of a patient is the medical needs of the patient. Patients shall be provided and encouraged to obtain medically necessary care regardless of ability to pay or eligibility for financial assistance. However, all patients will be required to pay for the care which they receive if they are financially able to do so. Advance payment will not be required for any medically necessary service. Some individuals fail to obtain necessary care due to financial concerns. In order to encourage such patients to obtain appropriate care, St. Luke's shall operate a Financial Assistance program for the uninsured indigent population and a discount program for all other uninsured patients. All patients presenting for medically necessary services with no insurance will have the opportunity to qualify for St. Luke's Financial Assistance Program. Services excluded from the program include but are not limited to; cosmetic, bariatric, IVF, IUDs, tubal ligations, sleep study. St. Luke's reserves the right to exclude services if upon review it is determined that they are not medically necessary. In addition, patients scheduled for elective procedures or studies will be assessed for medical need and timing for the procedure along with ability to pay for a portion of the procedure. Eligibility for the Pa Fair Care program will be reviewed and application required if eligible. Medical Assistance application may be required and completed prior to service for elective cases. Patients who meet a hardship exemption for the Affordable Care Act (ACA) may apply for Financial Assistance upon signing an attestation form of hardship eligibility. Patients receiving inpatient or high dollar outpatient services will be evaluated for Medical Assistance eligibility and ACA in order to qualify for the St. Luke's Hospital Financial Assistance Program. Individuals will not be eligible for financial assistance if Medical Assistance or ACA coverage is denied due to lack of cooperation (i.e., timeliness or failure to produce required documentation). Any patient payments made for services that subsequently receive Medical Assistance approval will be refunded to the patient. Financial Assistance Individuals with family income at or below 300% of the current federal poverty guidelines may be eligible for a 100% financial assistance allowance on the cost of their medically necessary services, after a minimum copay amount for certain outpatient services as follows; Clinic visits, including the hospital family practice centers, rural health centers, women's and children's clinics = $10. Other programs within the clinics may establish a flat rate minimum amount due for elective procedures that are at or below the Medical Assistance fee schedule for patients not eligible for Medical Assistance but are under the 300% federal poverty guidelines. Urgent care center visits = $15 Emergency room visits= $25 Uninsured patients with income exceeding 300% of federal poverty guidelines will automatically receive an 80% discount on hospital charges. No proof of income is required for this discount and this is not considered Financial Assistance. Patients with routine co-pays and deductibles from managed care and commercial insurances are not eligible for financial assistance or a discount unless a financial hardship can be proven. Patients having limited benefit coverage through insurance and who demonstrate a financial hardship may be eligible for the Financial Assistance program. Patients who have received financial assistance in the past but who are having services that are elective or high dollar procedures, visits will be required to comply with the process of Medical Assistance eligibility or eligibility for programs such as ACA. Case by case decisions will be made re financial liability in each instance. Determining Eligibility for Financial Assistance Designated business service department employees will utilize independent third party income estimation software information as the determinant of eligibility. The income estimation software application utilized by St. Luke's is based upon a statistically validated methodology to provide income and family size determination. This information is then automatically cross-walked to St. Luke's financial assistance eligibility matrix ranging from 0% to 300% of the current federal poverty guidelines to determine the level of financial assistance to be applied. When insufficient information is returned via the software application, the manual process below will be utilized to determine eligibility. In determining family income and family size, a family unit will be defined as immediate family members /significant other/domestic partner living in the household. All income of occupants will be considered in determining total household income. In determining income the following will be considered: - Wages - Pension - Annuities - Social Security - Interest, Dividend, and other Investment Income such as Capital Gains - Unemployment Compensation - Workers Comp - Disability Benefits - Child Support - Alimony - Public Assistance - Net Rental Income (Income Less Expenses) as calculated for Federal Tax purposes Assets may be considered in determining eligibility and the level of discount approved for financial assistance. Designated business service department employees may also discuss financial assistance with patients who upon receiving a billing statement express an inability to pay for services rendered. Financial assistance applications may be supplied to these patients along with the information regarding required documentation or the income estimation software may be used to determine eligibility status. Medical Indigence Assessment If the patient does not qualify for any of the financial assistance categories identified above, but the medical expenses exceed an ability to pay, the patient will be encouraged to write a hardship letter to be submitted to the Associate Vice President of Finance for consideration of a hardship write-off of all or part of the outstanding medical liability. In the case of foreign visitors, the hospital will attempt to identify the person who sponsored the visitor's entry into the United States. If the sponsor is legally responsible for the visitor's medical bills, the hospital will apply its normal collection efforts in attempting to collect from the sponsor. Application for financial assistance will be based on the sponsor's income. St. Luke's Hospital reserves the right to deny an application for financial assistance based upon lack of reasonably required documentation or the submission of fraudulent documentation. If information is not provided, an application may be denied unless the information was not provided for reasons beyond the applicant's control. In these cases the patient will not be eligible for the financial assistance program. Notification to Patient All patients receiving inpatient or high dollar OP services will receive a notice of determination from the business office with the amount of financial assistance granted and any remaining financial liability. Patients may provide documentation if they feel the automatic estimation of income and assets is incorrect or incomplete. The business office will assess and revise the determination as appropriate for future encounters based on the software information provided. All patient statements will have the phone number to call for patients having difficulty meeting financial obligations. St. Luke's credit and collection policy The Credit and Collection policy is established and is to be administered in accordance with the mission and values of the hospital as well as federal and state law. The policy is designed to promote appropriate access to medical care for all patients regardless of their ability to pay while maintaining the Network's fiscal responsibility to maximize reimbursement and minimize bad debt. All medically necessary hospital services are provided without consideration of ability to pay and are not delayed pending application and/or approval of Medical Assistance or St. Luke's Financial Assistance Program. Advance payment is not required for any medically necessary service. This Credit and Collection policy is intended to take into account each individual's ability to contribute to the cost of his or her care.

Analysis of information from the following sources is part of the department's ongoing health needs assessment process: vital statistics, Pennsylvania Department of Health data, hospital discharge data, the Robert Wood Johnson County health profiles and other county data available from various other state agencies. In addition, the department collects ongoing statistics from its comprehensive community outreach initiatives and from financial support for the Bethlehem partnership for a health community. Established in 1996 by the board of directors of St. Luke's University Health Network, the partnership is a national model for collaborative efforts to improve access to healthcare services. Currently more than 165 participating/funding agencies, representing local business, government, educational and community organizations are actively involved in partnership programs which serve the greater Lehigh Valley. Through community ownership and shared responsibility, the partnership strives to enhance the physical, mental, emotional and spiritual wellness of individuals and communities, thereby improving the quality of life for all. The department's healthcare needs assessment process is enhanced by data obtained through the Bethlehem partnership's various school-based programs, such as numbers of children failing dental and vision examinations and number of children not receiving medical examinations. The department also utilizes guidelines for adolescent preventive services (gaps) in the Bethlehem partnership's various mobile van service programs to collect data on risk factors for students and to monitor community health problems. For example, data has been tracked on risk factors such as smoking, obesity, seatbelt use and drug and alcohol use. Gaps is also used on an ongoing basis to build and modify programs. Most recently, the network has contracted with the Lehigh Valley Research Consortium to conduct a formal health needs assessment for the greater Lehigh Valley and Upper Bucks County area, served by St. Luke's Hospital (Allentown/Bethlehem), St. Luke's Quakertown Hospital and the Visiting Nurse Association of St. Luke's.

201511329349301416,520591667,Community Health Care Needs Assessment,"Schedule H, Part VI, Line 2 On June 6, 2013, Maryland General Hospital was renamed University of Maryland Medical Center Midtown Campus (UMMC Midtown Campus). The new name reflects our alignment with the University Of Maryland Medical Center and our shared goal of providing the highest quality of patient care and services. UMMC Midtown Campus, part of the University of Maryland Medical System (UMMS), is a non-profit, 208-bed urban community teaching hospital located in midtown Baltimore with a network of services providing care to approximately 100,000 patients each year. For purposes of community benefits programming and this report, the Community Benefit Service Area (CBSA) of UMMC Midtown Campus is defined following the completion of our Community Health Needs Assessment in FY'12 using the following 10 Baltimore City zip codes: 21201 21202 21211 21215 21216 21217 21218 21223 21229 21230 This CBSA was determined by identifying the zip codes with the highest percentage of admissions within Baltimore City. The CBSA is similar to the University of Maryland Medical Center's CBSA and reflects the primary and secondary service areas of the hospital. Approach and Resources In fiscal year 2012, UMMC Midtown Campus partnered with other city-based hospitals within the University of Maryland Medical System (University of Maryland Medical Center, Kernan Orthopedic and Rehabilitation Hospital, and Mt. Washington Pediatric Hospital), to conduct a comprehensive community health needs assessment (CHNA). This CHNA report and implementation plan was approved by UMMC board of directors on June 28, 2012. The CHNA report is available on the following website: http://ummidtown.org/pdfs/mgh%Community%20needs%20assessment%20report%206_ 12%20final.pdf."" The following resources were utilized to complete the assessment: - UMMS City-Based Hospitals Community Needs Survey - Community meetings with persons representing the broad interests of the community - National Healthcare Disparities Report (Agency for Healthcare Research and Quality) - Maryland State Health Improvement Process (SHIP) Plan - Healthy Baltimore 2015 (Baltimore City Health Department) - 2012 County Health Outcomes & Roadmaps UMMS City-based Hospitals Community Needs Survey The survey was designed to obtain feedback from the community about health-related concerns. It was administered as follows: Paper Survey Paper surveys were administered during community events, including the UMMS- sponsored Take a Loved One to the Doctor Day and Spring into Good Health fairs, B'More Health Expo, and other local community health fairs, and in UMMC Midtown ambulatory care practices. The survey was also included in the Spring issue of HealthBeat, UMMC Midtown Campus' community newsletter, at that time, which was mailed to 40,000 households in our primary service area. Intranet Survey An electronic form of the survey was administered through a link that was prominently placed on websites of the participating hospitals. Community Meetings with Persons Representing the Broad Interests of the Community Representatives from UMMC Midtown Campus held meetings and attended community events to discuss health-related needs and priorities of our common communities and opportunities for working together. These sessions included the following: -Meetings with religious and school leaders from churches and schools in the service area: Furman Templeton Elementary, Samuel F.B. Morse Elementary, Booker T. Washington Middle, Eutaw-Marshburn Elementary, Mt. Royal Elementary, Franklin Square Elementary/Middle, Pennsylvania Avenue AME Zion, Sharp Street United Methodist, Macedonia Baptist, Trinity Baptist, St. James Episcopal, Douglas Memorial Community, Union Baptist, Enon Baptist, Bethel AME, Madison Avenue Presbyterian, Providence Baptist Attending the Baltimore City Health Department's ""Your Community...Your Health"" meetings. Representatives from city-based hospitals within the University of Maryland Medical System (University of Maryland Medical Center, Kernan, Mt. Washington Pediatric, UMMC Midtown Campus) attended meetings conducted in our primary service areas. National Healthcare Disparities Report In 1999, Congress directed the Agency for Healthcare Research and Quality (AHRQ) to produce an annual report that tracks 'prevailing disparities in health care delivery as it relates to racial factors and socioeconomic factors in priority populations.' Titled the National Healthcare Disparities Report (NHDR), this report examines disparities in health care among designated priority populations. The referenced priority populations consist of groups with unique health care needs or issues that require special focus, such as racial and ethnic minorities, low-income populations, and people with special health care needs. Maryland State Health Improvement Process (SHIP) Plan The goal of the State Health Improvement Process (SHIP) is to provide a framework for accountability, local action, and public engagement to improve the health status of Marylanders. The SHIP includes 39 measures in 6 vision areas (healthy babies, healthy social environments, safe physical environments, infectious disease, chronic disease, healthcare access) that represent what it means for Maryland to be healthy. Healthy Baltimore 2015 In Spring 2009, the Baltimore City Health Department conducted a community health survey. As stated in the Summary Results Report released by the Department, ""the main goals of the survey were to: assess health needs of city residents, identify gaps in access to health services, and to assess the use and perception of city health services."" The community health survey was followed up with a report entitled Healthy Baltimore 2015. Healthy Baltimore 2015 is the Baltimore City Health Department's comprehensive health policy agenda, articulating its priority areas and indicators for action. This plan highlights where the largest impact can be made to reduce morbidity and mortality and improve the quality of life for city residents. It includes data showing significant health disparities by race, gender, education, and income, and identifies opportunities for addressing such inequities. Healthy Baltimore 2015 sets specific goals for reducing deaths from serious illnesses such as heart disease, cancer, HIV/AIDS and diabetes. It also addresses behavioral and nutritional issues that impact health, such as smoking, alcohol abuse, drug addiction and obesity. While the focus of this report is Baltimore City health indicators, it contains useful comparisons to state-wide and national prevalence rates as well. After the report was released, Dr. Oxiris Barbot, Baltimore City Commissioner of Health, met with the leaders of Baltimore City hospitals and encouraged partnering with each other and community-based organizations to develop and undertake initiatives to assist with meeting the targeted health improvement goals delineated in Healthy Baltimore 2015. 2012 County Health Outcomes & Roadmaps County Health Rankings measures and compares the health of counties/cities within a state. Four types of health factors are measured and compared: health behaviors, clinical care, social and economic, and physical environment factors. Health outcomes are used to rank the overall health of each county and city. Based on the data identified through the community health needs assessment process, UMMC Midtown Campus identified 4 strategic priorities as follows: - Promote Access to Quality Health Care - Decrease Smoking and Drug/Alcohol Use - Prevention of HIV and Other Sexually Transmitted Diseases - Diabetes Management & Prevention The UMMC Midtown Campus partners with the University of Maryland Medical Center and other Baltimore-based UMMS hospitals, such as Mt Washington Pediatric Hospital, and University of Maryland Rehab & Orthopedic Institute, and the UMMS Community Advocacy Team to address these needs. UMMC Midtown Campus also partners with the Maryland DHMH, Baltimore City Health Department, American Diabetes Association, the Jacques Initiative, the local faith community, and others to address these identified needs. UMMC Midtown Campus identified core community outreach priorities that target the intersection of identified community needs and the organization's key strengths and mission. However, several additional topic areas were identified during the CHNA process including: Obesity/CVD Cancer Mental Health Asthma/Lung disease Dental Health SIDS Injuries These areas, while still important to the health of the community, will be met through other health care organizations with our assistance as available. The unmet needs not addressed by UMMC Midtown Campus will be addressed by key Baltimore City governmental agencies, other local healthcare providers and organizations, and existing community-based organizations with whom we partner with regularly. The UMMC Midtown Campus will undertake its next community health needs assessment in FY15 and wil"

201501349349303910,421264647,Various - see the following references,"Schedule H Part 1 Line 6a The Annual Report that outlines the Hospital's community benefit information is contained in a report prepared by the system, Wheaton Franciscan Services, Inc. (FEIN #36-3262111) which is the ultimate parent organization of an integrated health care system operated in Wisconsin, Illinois, Iowa, and Colorado. For more information, please see our annual report at www.mywheaton.org. It is available under ""About Wheaton"" by selecting ""Community Impact,"" and scrolling down to ""View Our Annual Report"". Schedule H Part 1 Line 7 Community Benefit amounts are reported using total actual costs per the hospital's managerial accounting system in use, which includes all patient segments including inpatient, outpatient, emergency room, private insurance, Medicaid, Medicare, Medicare HMO, uninsured, and self-pay patients. Medicare is reported using the most recently filed cost report at the time the Annual Report and related community benefit information is published. Amounts are compiled using a software application recommended by the Catholic Health Association because it has the ability to provide the information in a format suitable for Schedule H presentation. After the data is entered by the Site Finance Directors, its accuracy is verified by employees who are trained in community benefit reporting, and then approved by the Chief Financial Officer and the President/CEO of the organization. After amounts are verified and approved, community benefit amounts become finalized. Wheaton Franciscan Healthcare complies with Illinois state law which requires reporting to the Attorney General's Office. Additionally, Wheaton Franciscan Healthcare voluntarily reports community benefit information in Wisconsin and Iowa by making the information readily available on certain websites. Finally, the information is compiled with the assistance of the software, for presentation in IRS Forms 990 Schedule H and Statement of Program Service Accomplishments Part III. Schedule H Part 1 Line 7 Column f Wheaton Franciscan Healthcare organizations follow guidelines established by the Catholic Health Association, who recommends that bad debt expense not be included in community benefit amounts. As a result of this applied methodology, a total amount of $9,361,008 has not been included in the denominator of the calculation that determines the percentages reported on Schedule H Line 7 Column f. Schedule H Part 1 Line 7g In the Southeast Wisconsin and Marianjoy regions, physician clinics are operated by a separate legal entity and are therefore not included in Community Benefit amounts on hospital 990's. In the Iowa region, clinic operations are included as a department of the hospital, Covenant Medical Center, Inc. Clinic operations for the Iowa clinics are included only in the community benefit reporting of charity care, government sponsored health care, and Medicare shortfall. Therefore, for all entities, including Covenant Medical Center, Inc., costs related to physician clinics are not included in subsidized health services reported on Schedule H Part I Line 7g. Schedule H Part III Section A Lines 1-4 As part of an annual process, affiliates of Wheaton Franciscan Healthcare complete a consolidated audit each year, which for June 30, 2014, contained a footnote on Bad Debt which appeared under item (4) ""Net Patient Service Revenue"" on page 15-16 of the attached audited financial statements. Note that while FASB ASU 2011-07 requires certain organizations present bad debt as a reduction from patient service revenue for financial statement presentation, for IRS Form 990 presentation, these amounts are classified as bad debt expense. It is the practice of Wheaton Franciscan Healthcare to record actual bad debt expense for each organization at the time the amount due is determined to be uncollectible, and thus written off. With the onset of presumptive care effective July 1, 2011, practices are now in place to retroactively determine a patient's eligibility under Wheaton's Charity Care Policy, and remove those amounts from bad debt expense in order to correctly show these patients as charity care. Wheaton Franciscan Healthcare's position is therefore that none of the patients resulting in uncollectible accounts would have qualified as charity care patients as this determination is made at the time of admission, and corrective action is taken based on presumptive care. Bad debt expense is only determined after many months of collection efforts, and for this reason Part III Section A Line 3 is reported at zero. Additionally, since the organization follows guidelines established by the Catholic Health Association and the related state counterpart in Wisconsin, Iowa, or Illinois as appropriate, Wheaton Franciscan Healthcare does not include any form of bad debt expense in its annual reporting of community benefit amounts. Schedule H Part III Section B Line 6-8 Schedule H Part III Section B Line 6 reports ""allowable costs of care"" as taken from the most recently filed Medicare cost report available at the time the Community Benefit Report is published. The Medicare cost report calculates its allowable total costs based on applicable Medicare regulations. Medicare and Medicaid cost is determined using individual cost center cost-to-charge ratios. This cost to charge ratio is determined using all payer cost and all payer charges. The cost to charge ratio is applied to the actual Medicare and Medicaid charges to determine the Medicare and Medicaid cost. This organization has adopted the cost and charge practices as recommended by the Catholic Health Association and the Wisconsin, Iowa, or Illinois Hospital Association as applicable, and therefore, does not count any Medicare shortfall numbers in its annual reporting of Community Benefit amounts. Schedule H Part III Section C Line 9b Wheaton Franciscan Healthcare has a policy that outlines all collection practices for patients who are known to qualify for government programs and for our charity care program. We make every attempt to assist the patient in enrolling in government insurance plans or our own charity care program allowing for free or discounted care. If the patient does not qualify for any type of aid or charity care, declines to establish a reasonable payment plan or pay the liability, the patient will be moved into a bad debt status, and the account is sent to a collection agency. This does not occur before the patient has received several notices and a final written warning. Schedule H Part V Section A and Section C Affiliates of Wheaton Franciscan Healthcare have defined and reported ""hospital facilities"" to include only those bricks and mortar buildings that actually have inpatient beds, in addition to meeting all other criteria under Wisconsin, Iowa, or Illinois state laws, as applicable, required for hospital licensing. Although there are other facilities within our system built to hospital standards, performing hospital-based billing, and conforming to other ""hospital"" standards under state law, until there is further guidance from the IRS, these facilities have been reported in Section C, due to their lack of having state certified inpatient beds. Schedule H Part VI Line 2 Wheaton Franciscan Healthcare assesses the needs of the communities it serves by reviewing admission and discharge data, analyzing information from the community health departments and other community leaders, and by aligning our services with the Healthy People 2020 and other current year initiatives. Wheaton Franciscan Healthcare has also completed its first Community Health Needs Assessments and Implementation Plans for all its hospital facilities, so please reference Schedule H Part V Section B Lines 1-8 for additional information. Schedule H Part VI Line 3 Wheaton Franciscan Healthcare provides its patients with several opportunities to gain knowledge and awareness of its Community Care (Charity Care/Financial Assistance) program. Notices regarding the availability of financial assistance are displayed in highly visible locations where there is a significant volume of inpatient or outpatient traffic such as: patient admitting and registration areas in both inpatient and outpatient settings, physician offices, and emergency departments. Additionally, brochures describing the policy are available upon request in the same locations and on Wheaton Franciscan Healthcare's website. The policy is also discussed at the time of registration or pre-registration for all inpatient procedures.

201501289349301235,231352222,"Part III, Line 2 - Methodology Used To Estimate Bad Debt Expense",The number was calculated using the cost to charge ratio factor applied against actual patient bad debt write-offs. These numbers are included after all efforts have been exhausted to determine if the patient meets our charity care write-off policy based on federal poverty levels.
201501289349301235,231352222,"Part III, Line 3 - Methodology of Estimated Amount & Rationale for Including in Community Benefit",The estimate of bad debt attributable to charity care policy was calculated by dividing the bad debt amount that was originally coded bad debt but later found to qualify as charity care by the amount coded to the charity care write-off codes. This ratio is applied to the bad debt cost factor expense.
201501289349301235,231352222,"Part III, Line 4 - Bad Debt Expense","York Hospital provides an allowance for doubtful accounts for estimated losses resulting from the unwillingness or inability of patients to make payments for services. The allowance is determined by analyzing specific accounts and historical data and trends. Patient accounts receivable are charged off against the allowance for doubtful accounts, when management determines that recovery is unlikely, and YH ceases collection efforts. Losses have been consistent with management's expectations in all material respects."
201501289349301235,231352222,"Part III, Line 8 - Explanation Of Shortfall As Community Benefit",York Hospital maintains records to identify and monitor the level of charity care and community service it provides. These records include the amount of charges forgone based on established rates for services and supplies furnished under its charity care and community service policies and the estimated cost of these services. Payments from Medicare are generally less than York Hospital's costs of providing the service.
201501289349301235,231352222,"Part III, Line 9b - Provisions On Collection Practices For Qualified Patients","Guidelines for suggested minimum number of phone attempts and letters to be sent before the account is turned over to an outside collection agency are included in the Patient Administrative Services Policy. Upon final PARO (Payment Assistance Rank Ordering) scoring, if a patient qualifies for presumptive charity, their account would not be forwarded to any third party collections. It shall be the policy of Patient Administrative Services to recommend accounts to Bad Debt on a timely basis. Inpatient/Outpatient accounts will go to bad debt automatically after the account has been in the financial class Pending Bad Debt for 30 days. All accounts must follow the approved limits for refunds and write offs, as established in Policy PF-102, before being transferred. The primary agencies will work the accounts for 6 months or until they feel it is uncollectable and return the account. The accounts are forwarded to secondary agencies from the primary agencies Closed and Return Reports. The financial class is changed to Bad Debt Other after the Closed and Return Reports are received from the Secondary Agency. The agencies must get written approval from the manager in the relatively rare instance of legal action being taken to collect the debt."
201501289349301235,231352222,Part VI - Needs Assessment,"In the early 1990s, our organization began developing new ways of working more closely with its communities. The first Community Health Assessment for York County was completed in 1994. Since that time, we've competed health assessments in 1997, 2000, 2005, 2008 and 2012. These are led by the regional health coalition, Healthy York County Coalition, which we support and are done collaboratively with other hospitals and community partners. The assessments evaluate the health of York County as a whole, and often target specific geographic or demographic segments for further study - such as the City of York or Youth. The gathering of data is one component of the health assessment process. As a community, the data is utilized as a basis of public meetings and forums to identify priorities for the community. These involve stakeholders from health and human services, government, business and other sectors. Our system-wide planning committee, which includes York Hospital Board members, dedicates a meeting on this topic and the priorities identified are used to define our organization's community health objectives in its annual plan. The Community Health Assessment is distributed and utilized broadly in the community and provides other organization's as well as our own with more data-driven picture of the issues and needs facing our community. Our focus is to understand the health status and behaviors of those residing in York County, prioritize results and identify community needs, and respond to those needs through the implementation of evidence-based strategies. In the recent 2012 Assessment, 1004 York County adults were interviewed and served as a sample of the patients with whom our organization daily interacts. These individuals are geographically distributed cross 48 zip codes and represent the diversity - age, gender, race/ethnicity, educational background, and socioeconomic status - of the community our organization serves. . The 2012 CHNA process was led by a Community Health Assessment Planning Committee, a multidisciplinary collaborative comprised of at least twelve agencies interested in the health needs of the community, including:""Two acute care facilities ""One integrated health care delivery system""Two county-level health coalitions""A local Federally Qualified Health Center (FQHC)""The local city health bureau""A local behavioral health counseling agency""Two local United Way branches""Area colleges and universities""A non-profit community foundationHistorically, Planning Committee members contribute in-kind staff hours to the Community Health Assessment process, utilize data to integrate priority interventions into their respective organizational plans, and assist with disseminating results to the community at-large. Except for the Healthy York County Coalition and participating colleges and universities, member organizations also financially support the community health assessment process, including a contractual agreement with an opinion research department at a local college to collect and analyze data, and generate necessary reports. Health coalition staff time spent during the assessment process and in monitoring this contract is considered an in-kind contribution.When initially convened, Planning Committee members determined deliverables to be included in a Request for Applications (RFA) to fund an entity that would conduct the assessment, analyze results, and summarize the findings. Responsibility for recent community health assessments was shared between both the Healthy York County Coalition and its sister coalition in Adams County, Healthy Adams County , to maximize economies of scale and identify shared priorities across the region. However, separate reports are generated to demonstrate respective community priorities and to meet regulatory requirements. The CHNA typically engages two components - primary data collection through implementation of the Behavioral Risk Factor Surveillance System (BRFSS) and secondary data collection available through online state or national level resources. Members of the Planning Committee partnered with the funded community health assessment entity to finalize BRFSS questions and approve the identified sample size. For the 2012 CHNA, the Planning Committee elected to correlate community health results with potential disparities (e.g. age, geographic area, poverty, race/ethnicity) to obtain additional detail about community needs. Previous health assessments have included qualitative data obtained through focus group results on key topics (e.g. behavioral health, substance abuse). In 2012, Planning Committee members elected to disseminate CHNA results and establish priorities for the community at-large and in their respective organizations at a local Health Summit held in June 2012. CHNA findings were also distributed through smaller organizational forums and in press releases. Health Summits have demonstrated efficacy to convene a larger group of interested parties including: community-based organizations (YMCA/YWCA); faith communities; healthcare insurers and providers; law enforcement agencies; local school districts; social service organizations, and; the general public to brainstorm about how to effect community change that improves health status and encourages positive health behaviors. As with past assessments, the lead researcher for the 2012 CHNA served as the keynote speaker and presented the overall results. A combination of general and breakout sessions were then employed to identify priorities and associated programmatic opportunities. The 2012 CHNA provided the most robust data, to date, and has enabled our organization to better integrate its results into our annual organizational and entity-level planning processes. Our system-wide Community Benefit Council, comprised of representation from both acute care facilities, and service line and corporate leadership, reviewed the CHNA results and identified four key priorities for the organization, including each of our three hospitals: adult overweight/obesity; avoidance of healthcare because of cost; depression, and; tobacco use. CHNA results continue to be shared at varying levels of our organization and are foundational to the creation of entity-level objectives and associated evaluation indicators in our community health implementation strategy. Our CHNA was finalized and made available to the public in fiscal year 2013. The implementation strategy for WellSpan Health (The WellSpan Community Health Improvement Plan) was developed during fiscal year 2013 and is attached to this return. The CHNA process is continuous in that, for example, 2012 Plan objectives are being implemented as planning for the 2015 Community Health Needs Assessment is underway."
201501289349301235,231352222,Part VI - Patient Education of Eligibility for Assistance,"For more than a decade, our organization has been working to improve access to care - based on the community health assessment's prioritization of medical, dental and oral health access as high. A key element of our strategy in addressing this need is to reach beyond simply informing patients about our patient assistance policies to proactively identifying patients without access and connecting them to available public and community programs. Outreach is conducted through programs like Health Connect, a mobile health program which travels throughout the county and takes care of immediate medical issues, while seeking opportunities to link unconnected individuals with a primary care provider and health insurance and charity care options. WellSpan also sponsors case managers within Healthy York Network (HYN) to support patient enrollment in public programs (i.e., Medicaid), health insurance marketplace options or in its own HYN discounted care program, which is based on the charity care guidelines of health care providers. In this time of healthcare reform, Healthy York Network has focused on communicating changes clearly to members and has provided support in directing members to the health insurance marketplace and other resources. Patient education is also provided by identifying special resources for at risk populations, including members of racial and ethnic minority communities, and supporting lay Community Health Workers to guide people toward enrollment options. Finally, through a multi-year initiative to ensure awareness among all people who qualify for charity care and financial assistance, our website has been updated, our enrollment processes and late bill communications have been simplified, the provision and availability of financial support resources at high visibility care sites has improved, and our partnership with our local Federally Qualified Health Center (FQHC) for early identification and qualification of patients has been strengthened."
201501289349301235,231352222,Part VI - Community Information,"To the casual observer, our service area could be described as one community. The combined population of York and Adams counties is over 545,000 people. This population is expected to increase by 4% or 21,000 people over the next five years. The York/Adams population is growing older. While the 18-44 age group comprises the largest segment of the population, this group will experience nominal growth through 2017. Most growth will occur in the 45-64 (4% or 6,300 people) and the 65+ (18% or 14,000 people) age groups. This shift is occurring as the baby boom generation ages, as people live longer due to healthy lifestyles and medical advances, and as retirees move from the Baltimore/Washington metro area to Southern York and Adams counties to find a safer, lower cost lifestyle. Although the overall population growth projected for the York/Adams area over the next five years is moderate, the changing demographic profile of the population will result in elevated incidence rates for both acute and chronic disorders that present themselves ever increasingly as the population ages. York County is situated in south-central Pennsylvania, and is bordered by Adams and Cumberland counties to the west and north respectively, and the Susquehanna River and Lancaster County to the east. Northeast of the river lies Dauphin County and the southern border is the Mason-Dixon line which forms the border with Maryland and its northernmost counties of Carroll, Baltimore and Harford. York County is approximately 911 square miles or 583,040 acres and is comprised of 72 municipalities; 35 townships, 36 boroughs and one (1) city.Generally and historically, employment rates are better than state and national averages but the composition of the workforce contains more manufacturing, production and tourism related business. An assessment of general health status is gathered as part of Community Health Assessments. The percent of adults in York County rating their health as fair or poor was 14.0%. Our in-depth knowledge of the community, gathered through community health assessments and focused studies during the past 15 years, however, show that our service area is not made up of one community but of many, with social and health factors that are significantly impacting its health. The number of uninsured has remained stable at approximately 6.5% but continues to be a major barrier to access to oral health, medical care and pharmaceuticals, and the incidence of chronic disease in on the rise."
201501289349301235,231352222,Part VI - Explanation Of How Organization Furthers Its Exempt Purpose,"Our involvement and support of a county health coalition - Healthy York County Coalition engages more than 200 community members in community health improvement initiatives. The Coalition consists of three committees Prevention and Wellness, Access and Empowerment, and Community Engagement; each of which continue to attract new community members, leaders and professionals. Coalition activities also focus on key community health priorities, as identified in the 2012 CHNA, and foster collaboration between health care entities, community-based organizations, and other interested parties. For example, the Healthy York County Coalition, in partnership with Healthy Adams County and WellSpans Health Community Health and Wellness department, distributed a 15 question survey to primary care providers in York and Adams counties, asking about current processes for screening and treatment of depression in the primary care setting, the availability of and linkage to existing community resources, and opportunities to better manage patients with depression. Survey results provided critical background information that was be used to enhance community awareness of depression, and advocate for system level changes that would bring more providers and services to the area in the future. This year, in partnership with Healthy Adams County and WellSpans Health Community Health and Wellness department, the Healthy York County Coalition will launch a depression awareness campaign called Feeling Blue in early November 2014. The campaign, managed by a committee of multiple service providers and community organization representatives, will feature a webpage - www.feeling-blue.com that provides self-management tips and techniques to support individuals with mild to moderate depression. Additionally, in response to a growing concern about end of life care in our community, the Coalition is encouraging community members to consider the conversation and learn more about end of life care, planning and preparation. Nearly 100 community members engaged in multiple focus group discussions around end of life topics and identified strategies to engage additional community members around the topic. Educational sessions, including the showing of a documentary and panel discussions, followed the focus groups and remains ongoing. During this past fiscal year, more than 200 individuals were engaged in end of life conversations. As a charitable, community-based healthcare organization, WellSpan is committed to improving the lives and well-being of the people and communities it serves. This dedication is evident in our organizational mission statement - ""Working as one to improve health through exceptional care for all, lifelong wellness, and healthier communities."" Employees at WellSpan Health practice its mission statement every day by engaging in community benefit activities that address the needs of the community, especially those focused on the four health priorities identified in the 2012 CHNA access, adult overweight/obesity, depression, and tobacco. One example of our commitment to the community is the development of the web-based 10 Pound Throwdown challenge, implemented by WellSpan Community Health & Wellness. This community-wide campaign promoted healthy weight loss and maintenance, as well as healthy habits such as physical activity and healthy eating during a 12 week period, beginning in early February. The Challenge included an online weight tracker, weekly email reminders, and tips toward a healthier lifestyle. It was designed to address the significant issue of adult overweight and obesity in our community by encouraging community members including: local employers and employees; WellSpan employees and patients, and specific populations to participate in a healthy challenge toward managing their weight. The 10 Pound Throwdown spans three counties Adams, Lancaster, and York, and engages more than 1600 individuals annually. Lastly, WellSpan Health-York Hospital continues to support and promote tobacco cessation programs throughout the community and is enhancing the referral process for providers, community organizations, and employers. In 2014, WellSpan Health successfully submitted a grant application to the American Lung Association, with the proposed launch in the summer of 2014. By partnering with individuals and other organizations, supporting their endeavors, sharing our knowledge and expertise, and learning from one another, together we are creating a healthier community. In addition to community benefit items outlined in Schedule H, we actively engage community members as organizational partners to reinvest in the health of our community by: providing Board and committee leadership opportunities; encouraging patient feedback that improves care through advisory groups, and; engaging diverse stakeholders on community-based taskforces that address complex community health issues. Both in the hospital and across our health system, community members actively volunteer their time to support activities and initiatives, and generously donate funds to the organization. During the fiscal year, approximately 2,000 individuals across the system volunteered a total of 170,000 hours of service, equivalent to approximately $3,500,000. In addition, the York Health Foundation, York Hospital's philanthropic organization, raised $4,810,376 to support an array of health services and programs."

ELIZABETH'S HOSPITAL IN BELLEVILLE IS AN AFFILIATE OF HOSPITAL SISTERS HEALTH SYSTEM (HSHS), A HEALTH CARE MINISTRY THAT INCLUDES 13 HOSPITALS, NUMEROUS COMMUNITY-BASED HEALTH CENTERS AND CLINICS, AND HUNDREDS OF PHYSICIAN PARTNERS ACROSS ILLINOIS AND WISCONSIN. THE MISSION OF HSHS IS ""TO REVEAL AND EMBODY CHRIST'S HEALING LOVE FOR ALL PEOPLE THROUGH OUR HIGH QUALITY FRANCISCAN HEALTH CARE MINISTRY."" WE LIVE OUR MISSION BY PROVIDING HOLISTIC HEALING TO ALL WHO SEEK OUR CARE, AS WELL AS THROUGH COMMUNITY BENEFIT. WORKING COLLABORATIVELY WITH OTHERS IN THE COMMUNITIES WE SERVE, OUR COMMUNITY BENEFIT INITIATIVES ARE STRATEGICALLY AND SUCCESSFULLY EXPANDING ACCESS TO CARE, IMPROVING THE HEALTH STATUS OF RESIDENTS, AND FURTHERING MEDICAL EDUCATION AND KNOWLEDGE. IN FY2014, OUR 13 HOSPITALS RESPONDED TO NEEDS IDENTIFIED IN EACH OF THEIR COMMUNITY HEALTH NEEDS ASSESSMENTS (CHNAS) COMPLETED IN FY2012. THE INFORMATION GATHERED FROM THESE ASSESSMENTS WAS USED TO DEVELOP NEW AND ENHANCE EXISTING COMMUNITY BENEFIT PROGRAMS AND SERVICES THAT BEST ADDRESSED COMMUNITY NEEDS. INCLUDED AMONG THE MANY PRIORITY NEEDS IDENTIFIED IN OUR CHNAS WERE CHRONIC DISEASE PREVENTION AND MANAGEMENT, OBESITY, ADEQUATE FOOD AND NUTRITION, MENTAL HEALTH, AND ACCESS TO HEALTH CARE SERVICES. HSHS HOSPITALS ARE PROACTIVELY ADDRESSING THESE AND OTHER NEEDS THROUGH PATIENT, PROVIDER AND COMMUNITY EDUCATION, PREVENTATIVE SCREENINGS, SELF-MANAGEMENT CLASSES, AND NEW OR ENHANCED CLINICAL SERVICES. ACROSS HSHS, WE COLLECTIVELY PROVIDED $174.0 MILLION IN COMMUNITY BENEFIT (OR 9.3% OF TOTAL HOSPITAL EXPENSES) IN FY2014. INCLUDED IN THIS AMOUNT WAS $39.9 MILLION PROVIDED FOR FINANCIAL ASSISTANCE (I.E. CHARITY CARE) AND $95.8 MILLION FOR UNREIMBURSED CARE PROVIDED UNDER THE MEDICAID PROGRAM. IN ADDITION, HSHS HOSPITALS COMMITTED SIGNIFICANT RESOURCES TO CARE FOR MEDICARE PATIENTS. THE COST OF PROVIDING SERVICES TO PRIMARILY ELDERLY BENEFICIARIES OF THE MEDICARE PROGRAM - IN EXCESS OF GOVERNMENTAL AND MANAGED CARE CONTRACT PAYMENTS - WAS $175.2 MILLION. HSHS HOSPITALS ALSO RECORDED $94.2 MILLION IN UNCOLLECTIBLE ACCOUNTS. WHILE THE LATTER TWO AMOUNTS ARE NOT COUNTED AS COMMUNITY BENEFIT, THEY NONETHELESS REFLECT OUR COMMITMENT TO ALL PERSONS IN NEED OF CARE. IN ADDITION TO THE DOLLARS INVESTED IN OUR COMMUNITY BENEFIT PROGRAMS, HSHS ALSO CONTINUES TO REINVEST ANY SURPLUS REVENUE FROM OPERATIONS AND INVESTMENTS INTO NEW MEDICAL TECHNOLOGY, FACILITY INFRASTRUCTURE AND HEALTH CARE SERVICES IN OUR COMMUNITIES. BY DOING SO, WE ENSURE WE ARE ABLE TO MEET THE ONGOING DEMAND FOR HIGH QUALITY, EFFICIENT AND EASILY ACCESSIBLE HEALTH CARE. RECOGNIZING THAT THE HEALTH CARE DELIVERY MODEL IN THE UNITED STATES IS EVOLVING, HSHS REMAINS FOCUSED ON IMPLEMENTING OUR CARE INTEGRATION STRATEGY. CARE INTEGRATION COORDINATES THE DELIVERY OF CARE AROUND THE NEEDS OF EACH PATIENT. DURING FY2014, WE MADE SIGNIFICANT PROGRESS WITH THIS STRATEGY AS WE FURTHER IMPLEMENTED INTEROPERABLE HEALTH INFORMATION TECHNOLOGIES, EXPANDED THE NUMBER OF MEDICAL HOMES, AND STRENGTHENED OUR ALIGNMENT WITH PHYSICIANS. GREATER ACCESS TO CARE AS A FRANCISCAN HEALTH CARE MINISTRY, HSHS IS DEEPLY COMMITTED TO SERVING THOSE WHO ARE MOST IN NEED. WE NOT ONLY PROVIDE CARE TO EVERY PATIENT WHO WALKS THROUGH OUR DOORS, BUT ALSO REACH OUT BEYOND THE WALLS OF OUR HOSPITALS AND CLINICS TO CARE FOR THOSE IN OUR COMMUNITIES. OUR EFFORTS TO ENSURE RESIDENTS IN THE COMMUNITIES WE SERVE RECEIVE THE RIGHT CARE AT THE RIGHT TIME IN THE RIGHT SETTING OFTEN INVOLVE PARTNERING WITH OTHERS TO ACHIEVE THIS GOAL. ACROSS OUR TWO-STATE SYSTEM, THERE ARE NUMEROUS EXAMPLES OF HSHS COLLABORATING WITH OTHER ORGANIZATIONS TO ENHANCE ACCESS TO CARE FOR THOSE IN NEED. IN FY2014, HSHS AND OUR 13 HOSPITALS INVESTED A CONSIDERABLE AMOUNT OF COMMUNITY BENEFIT RESOURCES TO EDUCATE THE UNINSURED ABOUT HISTORIC NEW OPPORTUNITIES TO ENROLL IN AFFORDABLE HEALTH CARE COVERAGE AND TO FACILITATE THE ENROLLMENT PROCESS. STUDIES HAVE SHOWN THAT PEOPLE WITHOUT INSURANCE COVERAGE ARE MORE LIKELY THAN THEIR INSURED COUNTERPARTS TO POSTPONE CARE AND TO DEVELOP MORE SEVERE AND EXPENSIVE CONDITIONS. IT IS FOR THIS REASON THAT THE CATHOLIC CHURCH, CATHOLIC HEALTH CARE AND HSHS HAVE LONG PROMOTED ""COVERAGE AND ACCESS FOR ALL."" HSHS AND OUR 13 HOSPITALS IN PARTNERSHIP WITH LOCAL HEALTH DEPARTMENTS, SOCIAL SERVICE AGENCIES AND OTHER HEALTH CARE PROVIDERS PLAYED A VITAL ROLE IN EDUCATING ELIGIBLE PEOPLE IN THEIR LOCAL COMMUNITIES, IN REFERRING PEOPLE TO CERTIFIED APPLICATION COUNSELORS AND/OR IN ENROLLING THEM IN THE HEALTH INSURANCE EXCHANGES OR IN SECURING COVERAGE THROUGH MEDICAID EXPANSION.

JOSEPH'S HOSPITAL AND CHIP) WAS DEVELOPED IN FY2014 TO PROVIDE FREE BEHAVIORAL HEALTH SERVICES TO ELIGIBLE PATIENTS OF THE OPEN DOOR CLINIC. THIS INITIATIVE IS IN DIRECT RESPONSE TO THE IDENTIFIED NEED TO PROVIDE BETTER ACCESS TO MENTAL HEALTH SERVICES FOR THOSE WITHOUT INSURANCE COVERAGE. IN FY2014, 105 REFERRALS WERE MADE FROM THE OPEN DOOR CLINIC TO LE PHILLIPS-LIBERTAS TREATMENT CENTER. IN TOTAL, 950 VISITS WERE PROVIDED TO REFERRED PATIENTS INCLUDING INITIAL INTAKE AND FOLLOW UP THERAPY SESSIONS - MENTAL HEALTH SERVICES THAT WOULD NOT HAVE BEEN RECEIVED HAD THE PROGRAM NOT BEEN DEVELOPED AND IMPLEMENTED.

JOSEPH'S HOSPITAL IN COLLABORATION WITH THE ILLINOIS DEPARTMENT OF INSURANCE PARTICIPATES IN THE SENIOR HEALTH INSURANCE PROGRAM (SHIP), A FREE HEALTH INSURANCE COUNSELING SERVICE FOR MEDICARE BENEFICIARIES AND THEIR CAREGIVERS. IN ADDITION TO PROGRAMS DESIGNED TO INCREASE ACCESS TO CARE, HSHS MAKES SURE THAT THOSE WHO NEED FINANCIAL ASSISTANCE RECEIVE IT. HSHS'S FINANCIAL ASSISTANCE (CHARITY CARE) POLICY WAS MODIFIED EFFECTIVE JANUARY 1, 2014 TO OFFER A 25% SELF-PAY DISCOUNT TO ALL PATIENTS WHO REGISTER WITHOUT INSURANCE. HSHS FINANCIAL ASSISTANCE PROGRAMS HAVE A SLIDING SCALE, IN SOME INSTANCES PROVIDING UP TO A 55% REDUCTION OFF BILLED CHARGES IF AN UNINSURED PATIENT'S FAMILY INCOME LEVEL IS DETERMINED TO BE ABOVE 500% BUT EQUAL TO OUR LESS THAN 600% OF THE CURRENT FEDERAL POVERTY GUIDELINES. ALL CHARGES ARE WAIVED FOR PATIENTS BELOW 200% OF THE FEDERAL POVERTY LEVELS. COUNSELORS ARE AVAILABLE IN OUR HOSPITALS TO EXPLAIN OUR FINANCIAL ASSISTANCE POLICY TO PATIENTS, PROVIDE THEM WITH ASSISTANCE IN FILLING OUT A SIMPLE APPLICATION FORM, OR HELP THEM ENROLL IN PUBLICLY FUNDED HEALTH CARE PROGRAMS."

CIGARETTE SMOKING MAY ALSO EXPOSE CHILDREN, ADOLESCENTS, FAMILIES AND THE GENERAL PUBLIC TO SECONDHAND SMOKE, WHICH CAUSES A BROAD RANGE OF ADVERSE HEALTH ISSUES. CIGARETTE SMOKING REMAINS ONE OF THE LEADING PREVENTABLE CAUSES OF DISEASE AND DISABILITY IN LOS ANGELES COUNTY. THE HOSPITAL POLICY ALSO SUPPORTS STAFF AND COMMUNITY MEMBERS WHO ARE TRYING TO QUIT SMOKING. A COMMITTEE OF HOSPITAL STAFF AND EXECUTIVE LEADERS DEVELOPED RESOURCES AND KITS TO SUPPORT SMOKING CESSATION. -- COORDINATING CARE FOR MOTHER AND FETUS - THE INSTITUTE FOR MATERNAL-FETAL HEALTH (IMFH) IS ONE OF ONLY A HANDFUL OF COMPREHENSIVE MATERNAL AND FETAL DIAGNOSTIC AND TREATMENT CENTERS NATIONWIDE.

201511329349301101,520610538,Community Building Activities,"Schedule H, Part II Through a variety of community building activities, UM Shore Regional Health promotes health and wellness in the community it serves. These activities include: active engagement and collaboration with local Health Departments, Chambers of Commerce, and organizations that work to improve the quality of life for the residents of the Mid-Shore (Talbot, Caroline, Dorchester, Queen Anne's, and Kent Counties) Because local action is essential to public health progress, UM Shore Regional Health is a key stakeholder in the Mid-Shore Health Improvement Coalition, a partnership of public sector agencies, health care providers and community-based partners. The coalition was formed in December 2011 in response to a Statewide Health Improvement Process (SHIP). In addition to providing the coalition with leadership, a variety of clinical and non-clinical UM SRH associates serve on various coalition workgroups. The work of the coalition began by reviewing and prioritizing objectives identified by the Maryland Department of Health and Mental Hygiene's (DHMH) State Health Improvement Process (SHIP). SHIP, launched in September 2011, focuses on improving the health of Maryland residents in six vision areas: Healthy Babies, Healthy Social Environments, Safe Physical Environments, Infectious Disease, Chronic Disease and Health Care Access. Under SHIP's umbrella, the coalition develops and implements strategies that will improve local public health. The coalition decided to focus on three health priorities: (1) adolescent obesity, (2) adolescent tobacco use, and (3) diabetes related emergency department visits. The coalition formulated an action plan that articulates specific goals and strategies for the three health priorities. Through coalition workgroups and committees, representatives from the Mid-Shore collaborate to assess local health needs and services; share data and other resources; explore evidence-based health practices; and acquire support to enhance and initiate health programs that impact targeted populations and communities. The coalition plans to effectively leverage and utilize new and existing resources to measurably improve the health status of the residents of the Mid-Shore. In addition to being an integral part of the Mid-Shore Health Improvement Coalition, UM SRH continues to maintain open communication with the Health Departments of Talbot, Caroline, Dorchester, Queen Anne's, and Kent Counties, Mid-Shore Mental Health System, Choptank Community Health System, local government and schools. UM SRH's community outreach programs can be found in County schools, senior centers, community centers and churches throughout the Mid-Shore. UM SRH's director of community outreach participates in committees and advisory councils, promoting continuous dialogue between the medical center and community stakeholders. This provides opportunities for new ideas and programs to be exchanged, allowing UM SRH to maximize community outreach efforts. UM SRH seeks insight from community members attending educational programs through its outreach events. Program participants are asked to complete a brief survey evaluation, providing feedback and comments about the program they attended, as well as providing suggestions for future program topics."

AT THAT TIME, THE HSCRC APPROVED RATES APPLIED ONLY TO COMMERCIAL INSURERS. IN 1977, THE HSCRC NEGOTIATED A WAIVER FROM MEDICARE HOSPITAL PAYMENT RULES FOR MARYLAND HOSPITALS TO BRING THE FEDERAL MEDICARE PAYMENTS UNDER HSCRC CONTROL. MEDICARE REIMBURSES MARYLAND HOSPITALS ACCORDING TO RATES ESTABLISHED BYTHE HSCRC AS LONG AS THE STATE CONTINUES TO MEET A TWO-PART TEST. THIS TWO-PART WAIVER TEST ALLOWS MEDICARE TO PARTICIPATE IN THE MARYLAND SYSTEM AS LONG AS TWO CONDITIONS ARE MET. - ALL OTHER PAYERS PARTICIPATING IN THE SYSTEM PAY HSCRC SET RATES, AND - THE RATE OF GROWTH IN MEDICARE PAYMENTS TO MARYLAND HOSPITALS FROM 1981 TO THE PRESENT IS NOT GREATER THAN THE RATE OF GROWTH IN MEDICARE PAYMENTS TO HOSPITALS NATIONALLY OVER THE SAME TIME FRAME. BAD DEBT EXPENSE FOOTNOTE ON AUDITED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS Schedule H, Part III, Line 4 For receivables associated with services provided to patients who have third-party coverage, the Corporation analyzes contractually due amounts and provides an allowance for bad debts, allowance for contractual adjustments, provision for bad debts, and contractual adjustments on accounts for which third-party payor has not yet paid or for payors who are known to be having financial difficulties that make the realization of the amounts due unlikely. For receivables associated with self-pay patients or balances remaining after third-party coverage has already paid, the Corporation records a significant provision for bad debts in the period of service on the basis of its historical collections, which indicates that many patients ultimately do not pay the portion of their bill for which they are financially responsible. The difference between the discounted rates and the amounts collected after all reasonable collection efforts have been exhausted is charged off against the allowance for Bad Debts. allowance for Bad Debts."

All patients presenting as self pay and requesting charity relief from their bill will be screened at all points of entry, for possible coverage through state programs and a probable determination for coverage for either Medical Assistance or Financial Assistance (charity care) from the hospital is immediately given to the patient. The process is resource intensive and time consuming for patients and the hospital; however, if patients qualify for one of these programs, then they will have health benefits that they will carry with them beyond their current hospital bills, and allow them to access preventive care services as well. UM Shore Regional Health works with a business partner who will work with our patients to assist them with the state assistance programs, which is free to our patients. If a patient does not qualify for Medicaid or another program, UM Shore Regional Health offers our financial assistance program. UM Shore Regional Health posts notices of our policy in conspicuous places throughout the hospitals- including the emergency department, has information within our hospital billing brochure, educates all new employees thoroughly on the process during orientation, and does a yearly re- education to all existing staff. All staff have copies of the financial assistance application, both in English and Spanish, to supply to patients who we deem, after screening, to have a need for assistance. UM Shore Regional Health has a dedicated Financial Assistance Liaison to work with our patients to assist them with this process and expedite the decision process. Shore Health notifies patients of availability of financial assistance funds prior to service during our calls to patients, through signage at all of our registration locations, through our patient billing brochure and through our discussions with patients during registration. In addition, the information sheet is mailed to patients with all statements and/or handed to them if needed. Notices are sent regarding our Hill Burton program (services at reduced cost) yearly as well. - Shore Health prepares its FAP in a culturally sensitive manner, at a reading comprehension level appropriate to the CBSA's population, and in Spanish. - Shore Health posts its FAP and financial assistance contact information in admissions areas, emergency rooms, and other areas of facilities in which eligible patients are likely to present; - Shore Health provides a copy of the FAP and financial assistance contact information to patients or their families as part of the intake process; - Shore Health provides a copy of the FAP and financial assistance contact information to patients with discharge materials. - A copy of Shore Health's FAP along with financial assistance contact information, is provided in patient bills; and/or - Shore Health discusses with patients or their families the availability of various government benefits, such as Medicaid or state programs, and assists patients with qualification for such programs, where applicable. - An abbreviated statement referencing Shore Health's financial assistance policy, including a phone number to call for more information, is run annually in the local newspaper (Star Democrat)."
201511329349301101,520610538,Description of Community Served,"Schedule H, Part VI, Line 4 UM SHORE REGIONAL HEALTH'S SERVICE AREA IS DEFINED AS THE MARYLAND COUNTIES OF CAROLINE, DORCHESTER, TALBOT (PRIMARY SERVICE AREA); QUEEN ANNE'S AND KENT (SECONDARY SERVICE AREA). THE FIVE COUNTIES OF THE MID-SHORE COMPRISE 20% OF THE LANDMASS OF THE STATE OF MARYLAND AND 2% OF THE POPULATION. THE POPULATION OF THE FIVE COUNTIES IS JUST OVER 170,000. THE ENTIRE REGION HAS OVER 4,400 EMPLOYERS WITH NEARLY 45,000 WORKERS. ONLY 50 OF THOSE EMPLOYERS EMPLOY 100 OR MORE WORKERS. ALMOST 85% OF EMPLOYERS IN THIS RURAL REGION ARE MANUFACTURING FIRMS, WHICH REQUIRE WORKERS WITH HIGH-LEVEL TECHNOLOGY SKILLS AS WELL AS LOW-SKILLED WORKERS. ( - 9.62% ADULTS HAVE LESS THAN A 9TH GRADE EDUCATION AND ANOTHER 9.62% HAVE AN EDUCATION AT THE 9TH -12TH GRADE LEVEL BUT DO NOT HAVE A HIGH SCHOOL DIPLOMA). THE SERVICE INDUSTRY IS GROWING RAPIDLY AS THE LOCAL POPULATION SHIFTS TO INCLUDE MORE SENIOR ADULTS WHO RETIRE TO THIS BEAUTIFUL AREA OF THE STATE. ALTHOUGH THE SEAFOOD INDUSTRY CONTINUES TO BE IMPORTANT TO THE REGION IT IS FAST BECOMING AN ENDANGERED SPECIES. THE MID-SHORE HAS A HIGHER PERCENTAGE OF POPULATION AGED 65 AND OLDER AS COMPARED TO MARYLAND OVERALL. TALBOT COUNTY HAS A 23.7 % RATE FOR THIS AGE GROUP. THIS CONCENTRATION IS DUE MAINLY TO INFLUX OF RETIREES. THE MID SHORE REGION HAS 26,203 MINORITY PERSONS, REPRESENTING 25.3% OF THE TOTAL POPULATION. WHILE STEADY PROGRESS IS BEING MADE, THE MID-SHORE ECONOMY STILL FACES A MYRIAD OF CHALLENGES THAT INCLUDE LIMITED ACCESS TO AFFORDABLE HIGH SPEED BROADBAND SERVICES, A SHORTAGE OF AFFORDABLE HOUSING, AN INADEQUATE SUPPLY OF SKILLED WORKERS, LOW PER CAPITA INCOME, AND MORE LAYOFFS IN THE MANUFACTURING SECTOR.(SOURCE: MID SHORE COMPREHENSIVE ECONOMIC DEVELOPMENT STRATEGY CEDS) IN TERMS OF HEALTHCARE, LARGE DISPARITIES EXIST BETWEEN BLACKS AND WHITES AS REPORTED BY THE OFFICE OF MINORITY HEALTH AND HEALTH DISPARITIES, DHMH. FOR EMERGENCY DEPARTMENT (ED) VISIT RATES FOR DIABETES, ASTHMA AND HYPERTENSION, THE BLACK RATES ARE TYPICALLY 3- TO 5 FOLD HIGHER THAN WHITE RATES. ADULTS AT HEALTHY WEIGHT METRIC IS LOWER (WORSE) FOR BLACKS IN ALL THREE COUNTIES WHERE BLACK DATA COULD BE REPORTED. HEART DISEASE MORTALITY BLACK RATES ARE VARIOUSLY HIGHER OR LOWER COMPARED TO WHITE RATES IN INDIVIDUAL COUNTIES. IN CAROLINE, THE BLACK RATE IS LOWER THAN THE WHITE RATES NOT BECAUSE THE BLACK RATE IS PARTICULARLY LOW, BUT BECAUSE THE WHITE RATE IS UNUSUALLY HIGH. FOR CANCER MORTALITY, BLACK RATES EXCEED WHITE RATES IN DORCHESTER, KENT, QUEEN ANNE'S AND TALBOT. IN CAROLINE, BLACK RATES ARE LOWER, AGAIN BECAUSE OF A RATHER HIGH WHITE RATE. THE BLACK RATES AND WHITE RATES ARE BELOW THE STATE HEALTH IMPROVEMENT PROCESS (SHIP) GOALS. (SOURCE: HTTP://WWW.DHMH.MARYLAND.GOV/SHIP).

HOUSING IN DORCHESTER COUNTY, EVEN THOUGH RELATIVELY LOW-PRICED, IS NOT NECESSARILY MORE AFFORDABLE DUE TO THE RELATIVELY LOW INCOME OF COUNTY RESIDENTS. COMPARED TO THE SURROUNDING COUNTIES, THE HOUSING STOCK IS OLDER, FEWER HOMES ARE OWNER- OCCUPIED, MORE HOUSEHOLDS ARE LOW TO MODERATE INCOME, AND MORE HOUSING LACKS COMPLETE PLUMBING. THE LACK OF MOVE-UP HOUSING IN THE COUNTY IS SEEN AS A DETERRENT TO ATTRACTING BUSINESS. DORCHESTER COUNTY HAS A RELATIVELY WEAK HOUSING MARKET LINKED TO THE WEAK ECONOMY. IN ADDITION, THE DISPROPORTIONATE AMOUNT OF THE COUNTY'S ELDERLY POPULATION DICTATES THE NEED FOR MORE MODEST PRICED HOMES FOR THE PERSONS IN THIS AGE CATEGORY. COUNTY-WIDE, JUST OVER 31.5 PERCENT OF HOUSING WAS RENTER OCCUPIED IN 2010 WITH A RENTER RATE FOR INCORPORATED TOWNS NEARING 50 PERCENT. IN 2010, 18.3 PERCENT OF THE COUNTY'S HOUSING UNITS WERE VACANT. THIS IS A MUCH HIGHER PERCENTAGE THAN FOR ADJOINING COUNTIES. PROBLEMS ASSOCIATED WITH DORCHESTER COUNTY HOUSING INCLUDE THE FOLLOWING: - HIGH HOUSING COSTS COMPARED TO INCOME - SIGNIFICANT NUMBER OF HOMES IN POOR PHYSICAL CONDITION - OWNER OCCUPANCY LEVEL FOR HOUSING UNITS IN CAMBRIDGE AT LESS THAN 50 PERCENT - MARKET DEMAND FOR RURAL SUBDIVISIONS COUPLED WITH DISINCENTIVES FOR HOUSING DEVELOPMENTS IN TOWNS ARE RESULTING IN INCREASING HOUSING DEVELOPMENT IN THE UNINCORPORATED AREA OF THE COUNTY. TALBOT COUNTY. THE HOUSING ISSUES IN TALBOT COUNTY ARE COMPLEX PRIMARILY BECAUSE OF THE EXTREME DISPARITY OF INCOME LEVELS IN THE COUNTY. LIMITED ENTREPRENEURIAL AND JOB OPPORTUNITIES KEEP THE MODERATE INCOME WAGE EARNERS FROM HOME OWNERSHIP. HABITAT FOR HUMANITY AND NEW EASTON TOWN COUNCIL INITIATIVES NOW REQUIRE DEVELOPERS TO ADDRESS LOW TO MODERATE INCOME, AFFORDABLE HOME OWNERSHIP OPPORTUNITIES AS PART OF ANY NEW HOUSING DEVELOPMENT STRATEGY. THE NET EFFECT WILL NOT BE KNOWN FOR SEVERAL YEARS. THERE IS NO SHORTAGE OF HIGH END HOUSING OPTIONS. MIDDLE INCOME AFFORDABLE HOUSING REMAINS A COUNTY WIDE ISSUE. TALBOT COUNTY HAD THE FOURTH SMALLEST NUMBER OF PERSONS PER HOUSEHOLD IN THE STATE IN 2000 (2.32) HOWEVER 40% OF PUBLIC HOUSING REMAINS INEXPLICABLY VACANT. RENTAL PROPERTY IS EXORBITANT AND OFTEN REQUIRES UNRELATED FAMILIES TO SHARE SPACE. APARTMENTS REPRESENT 85% OF THE RENTAL PROPERTY.

201511329349301101,520610538,Promoting the Health of the Community,"Schedule H, Part VI, Line 5 The analysis of local data indicated that diabetes, heart disease, cancer, behavioral health and access to care were all health improvement priorities for the Mid-Shore. After careful review of County health data, the Mid-Shore SHIP Coalition prioritized the potential health improvement areas and decided to focus the Coalition's efforts on three areas: (1) adolescent obesity, (2) adolescent tobacco use, and (3) diabetes related emergency department visits. The Coalition is committed to examining what evidence-based initiatives can improve the county's health in these three areas related to racial, ethnic and other demographic and geographic-related health disparities. Maryland's State Health Improvement Process (SHIP) provides a framework for continual progress toward a healthier Maryland. Maryland's State Heath Improvement Process (SHIP) began with national, state and local data being reviewed and analyzed by the Maryland Department of Health and Mental Hygiene (DHMH) Office of Population Health as well as by the 5 Departments of Health (Talbot, Caroline, Dorchester, Queen Anne's, Kent). It has three main components: accountability, local action and public engagement. SHIP includes 39 measures that provide a framework to improve the health of Maryland residents. Twenty-eight of the measures have been identified as critical racial/ethnic health disparities. Each measure has a data source and a target, and where possible, can be assessed at the county level. UM SRH's priorities are aligned with the Maryland State Health Improvement Process vision areas and those objectives outlined by the local health improvement coalition. UM SRH's Priorities: 1. Chronic Diseases (Obesity, Heart Disease, Diabetes and Cancer) 2. Wellness and Access 3. Reducing ED visits due to chronic disease 4. Access to Care Several additional topic areas were identified by the CHNA Steering Committee including: safe housing, transportation, and substance abuse. The unmet needs not addressed by UM SRH will continue to be addressed by key governmental agencies and existing community- based organizations. While UM SRH will focus the majority of our efforts on the identified priorities outlined in the CHNA Action Plan, we will review the complete set of needs identified in the CHNA for future collaboration and work. These areas, while still important to the health of the community, will be met through other health care organizations with our assistance as available. Initiative 1 Identified Need: Reduce emergency department visits due to diabetes, hypertension. Hospital Initiative: Shore Wellness Partners (SWP) Primary Objective of Initiative/Metrics that will be Used to Evaluate the Results: Shore Well Partners is a unique program that provides a continuum of care, focusing on preventive care to improve the ability of patients and families to work together to reduce emergency department visits and readmissions. The program is designed for at-risk families and individuals who do not have sufficient resources and are not eligible for other in-home services. Wellness Partners helps patients with disease management and life skills so that they can continue to live in their own homes. The service is provided by Shore Health System at no charge for those who qualify. Objectives: - Managing physical health problems - Connection with other community services - Dietary education - Home safety evaluations - Safe medicine use - Education on specific illness and treatments - Emotional support - Monitoring client progress through home visits or phone calls Single of Multi-Year Initiative Time Period: Multi-year initiative beginning in 2011. Key Partners and/or Hospitals in Initiative Development and/or Implementation: Members of the Shore Wellness Partners team include advanced practice nurses and medical social workers. These specialists work with patients, caregivers, and primary care providers (sometimes care is provided in the patient's home). Shore Wellness Partners is a partner in the HEZ for Dorchester and Caroline Counties. Detailed information for the HEZ model, Competent Care Connections can be found at: http://dhmh.org Evaluation Dates: July 1, 2013 through June 30 2014. Evaluation of Outcomes: (1) # of referrals to service ;( 2) # of patients on service with Shore Wellness Partners; (3) Comparison of ALL CAUSE readmissions for FY14 Outcomes (process and impact measures included): Number of referrals = 305 Number of active patients=232 There was a 52% reduction in hospital admissions for clients on service with SWP for 0-6 months, which represented 84% of the SWP clients in FY 2014. This admission reduction is similar to the Glendening-Napoli, Dowling, Pulvion, Baillargeon and Raimer (2012) study that found a 53% decrease in hospital admissions. Based on FY 2014 history, there was an 8% mean ED visit and a 30% mean hospital visit rate decrease for clients with SWP greater than 6 months. FY14 satisfaction survey, which had a 29% response rate, SWP clients were highly satisfied with the program. One hundred percent of the clients surveyed rated the program 10 on a 0 - 10 scale with 0 being the worst service possible and 10 representing the best service possible. Medication management, vital signs monitoring, and emotional support were highly rated aspects of the program. Continuation of Initiative: Yes, Expansion of SWP as part of the HEZ grant Total Cost of Initiative $467,268 (includes staff salary and supplies Does not include indirect overhead) Direct offsetting revenue from Restricted Grants HEZ Grant: $35,289. $485,341(includes staff salary and supplies Does not include indirect overhead) Initiative 2 Identified Need: Cardiovascular Disease, Critical Care Access to emergency medications prevents terminal outcomes for patients (Advanced Cardiac Life Support) Hospital Initiative: (A) Anti-thrombosis Clinic; (B): EMS Medication Programs Primary Objective of Initiative/Metrics that will be Used to Evaluate the Results: A).

THE COMMUNITY BENEFIT STANDARD IS THE CURRENT STANDARD FOR A HOSPITAL FOR RECOGNITION AS A TAX-EXEMPT AND CHARITABLE ORGANIZATION UNDER INTERNAL REVENUE CODE (""IRC"") 501(C)(3). THE ORGANIZATION IS RECOGNIZED AS A TAX-EXEMPT ENTITY AND CHARITABLE ORGANIZATION UNDER 501(C)(3) OF THE IRC. ALTHOUGH THERE IS NO DEFINITION IN THE TAX CODE FOR THE TERM ""CHARITABLE"" A REGULATION PROMULGATED BY THE DEPARTMENT OF THE TREASURY PROVIDES SOME GUIDANCE AND STATES THAT ""[T]HE TERM CHARITABLE IS USED IN SECTION 501(C)(3) IN ITS GENERALLY ACCEPTED LEGAL SENSE,"" AND PROVIDES EXAMPLES OF CHARITABLE PURPOSES, INCLUDING THE RELIEF OF THE POOR OR UNPRIVILEGED; THE PROMOTION OF SOCIAL WELFARE; AND THE ADVANCEMENT OF EDUCATION, RELIGION, AND SCIENCE. NOTE IT DOES NOT EXPLICITLY ADDRESS THE ACTIVITIES OF HOSPITALS. IN THE ABSENCE OF EXPLICIT STATUTORY OR REGULATORY REQUIREMENTS APPLYING THE TERM ""CHARITABLE"" TO HOSPITALS, IT HAS BEEN LEFT TO THE IRS TO DETERMINE THE CRITERIA HOSPITALS MUST MEET TO QUALIFY AS IRC 501(C)(3) CHARITABLE ORGANIZATIONS. THE ORIGINAL STANDARD WAS KNOWN AS THE CHARITY CARE STANDARD. THIS STANDARD WAS REPLACED BY THE IRS WITH THE COMMUNITY BENEFIT STANDARD WHICH IS THE CURRENT STANDARD. CHARITY CARE STANDARD IN 1956, THE IRS ISSUED REVENUE RULING 56-185, WHICH ADDRESSED THE REQUIREMENTS HOSPITALS NEEDED TO MEET IN ORDER TO QUALIFY FOR IRC 501(C)(3) STATUS. ONE OF THESE REQUIREMENTS IS KNOWN AS THE ""CHARITY CARE STANDARD."" UNDER THE STANDARD, A HOSPITAL HAD TO PROVIDE, TO THE EXTENT OF ITS FINANCIAL ABILITY, FREE OR REDUCED-COST CARE TO PATIENTS UNABLE TO PAY FOR IT. A HOSPITAL THAT EXPECTED FULL PAYMENT DID NOT, ACCORDING TO THE RULING, PROVIDE CHARITY CARE BASED ON THE FACT THAT SOME PATIENTS ULTIMATELY FAILED TO PAY. THE RULING EMPHASIZED THAT A LOW LEVEL OF CHARITY CARE DID NOT NECESSARILY MEAN THAT A HOSPITAL HAD FAILED TO MEET THE REQUIREMENT SINCE THAT LEVEL COULD REFLECT ITS FINANCIAL ABILITY TO PROVIDE SUCH CARE. THE RULING ALSO NOTED THAT PUBLICLY SUPPORTED COMMUNITY HOSPITALS WOULD NORMALLY QUALIFY AS CHARITABLE ORGANIZATIONS BECAUSE THEY SERVE THE ENTIRE COMMUNITY, AND A LOW LEVEL OF CHARITY CARE WOULD NOT AFFECT A HOSPITAL'S EXEMPT STATUS IF IT WAS DUE TO THE SURROUNDING COMMUNITY'S LACK OF CHARITABLE DEMANDS. COMMUNITY BENEFIT STANDARD IN 1969, THE IRS ISSUED REVENUE RULING 69-545, WHICH ""REMOVE[D]"" FROM REVENUE RULING 56-185 ""THE REQUIREMENTS RELATING TO CARING FOR PATIENTS WITHOUT CHARGE OR AT RATES BELOW COST."" UNDER THE STANDARD DEVELOPED IN REVENUE RULING 69-545, WHICH IS KNOWN AS THE ""COMMUNITY BENEFIT STANDARD,"" HOSPITALS ARE JUDGED ON WHETHER THEY PROMOTE THE HEALTH OF A BROAD CLASS OF INDIVIDUALS IN THE COMMUNITY. THE RULING INVOLVED A HOSPITAL THAT ONLY ADMITTED INDIVIDUALS WHO COULD PAY FOR THE SERVICES (BY THEMSELVES, PRIVATE INSURANCE, OR PUBLIC PROGRAMS SUCH AS MEDICARE), BUT OPERATED A FULL-TIME EMERGENCY ROOM THAT WAS OPEN TO EVERYONE. THE IRS RULED THAT THE HOSPITAL QUALIFIED AS A CHARITABLE ORGANIZATION BECAUSE IT PROMOTED THE HEALTH OF PEOPLE IN ITS COMMUNITY. THE IRS REASONED THAT BECAUSE THE PROMOTION OF HEALTH WAS A CHARITABLE PURPOSE ACCORDING TO THE GENERAL LAW OF CHARITY, IT FELL WITHIN THE ""GENERALLY ACCEPTED LEGAL SENSE"" OF THE TERM ""CHARITABLE,"" AS REQUIRED BY TREAS. REG. 1.501(C)(3)-1(D)(2). THE IRS RULING STATED THAT THE PROMOTION OF HEALTH, LIKE THE RELIEF OF POVERTY AND THE ADVANCEMENT OF EDUCATION AND RELIGION, IS ONE OF THE PURPOSES IN THE GENERAL LAW OF CHARITY THAT IS DEEMED BENEFICIAL TO THE COMMUNITY AS A WHOLE EVEN THOUGH THE CLASS OF BENEFICIARIES ELIGIBLE TO RECEIVE A DIRECT BENEFIT FROM ITS ACTIVITIES DOES NOT INCLUDE ALL MEMBERS OF THE COMMUNITY, SUCH AS INDIGENT MEMBERS OF THE COMMUNITY, PROVIDED THAT THE CLASS IS NOT SO SMALL THAT ITS RELIEF IS NOT OF BENEFIT TO THE COMMUNITY. THE IRS CONCLUDED THAT THE HOSPITAL WAS ""PROMOTING THE HEALTH OF A CLASS OF PERSONS THAT IS BROAD ENOUGH TO BENEFIT THE COMMUNITY"" BECAUSE ITS EMERGENCY ROOM WAS OPEN TO ALL AND IT PROVIDED CARE TO EVERYONE WHO COULD PAY, WHETHER DIRECTLY OR THROUGH THIRD-PARTY REIMBURSEMENT. OTHER CHARACTERISTICS OF THE HOSPITAL THAT THE IRS HIGHLIGHTED INCLUDED THE FOLLOWING: ITS SURPLUS FUNDS WERE USED TO IMPROVE PATIENT CARE, EXPAND HOSPITAL FACILITIES, AND ADVANCE MEDICAL TRAINING, EDUCATION, AND RESEARCH; IT WAS CONTROLLED BY A BOARD OF TRUSTEES THAT CONSISTED OF INDEPENDENT CIVIC LEADERS; AND HOSPITAL MEDICAL STAFF PRIVILEGES WERE AVAILABLE TO ALL QUALIFIED PHYSICIANS. THE AMERICAN HOSPITAL ASSOCIATION (""AHA"") BELIEVES THAT MEDICARE UNDERPAYMENTS (SHORTFALL) AND BAD DEBT ARE COMMUNITY BENEFIT AND THUS INCLUDABLE ON THE FORM 990, SCHEDULE H, PART I. THIS ORGANIZATION AGREES WITH THE AHA POSITION. AS OUTLINED IN THE AHA LETTER TO THE IRS DATED AUGUST 21, 2007 WITH RESPECT TO THE FIRST PUBLISHED DRAFT OF THE NEW FORM 990 AND SCHEDULE H, THE AHA FELT THAT THE IRS SHOULD INCORPORATE THE FULL VALUE OF THE COMMUNITY BENEFIT THAT HOSPITALS PROVIDE BY COUNTING MEDICARE UNDERPAYMENTS (SHORTFALL) AS QUANTIFIABLE COMMUNITY BENEFIT FOR THE FOLLOWING REASONS: - PROVIDING CARE FOR THE ELDERLY AND SERVING MEDICARE PATIENTS IS AN ESSENTIAL PART OF THE COMMUNITY BENEFIT STANDARD. - MEDICARE, LIKE MEDICAID, DOES NOT PAY THE FULL COST OF CARE. RECENTLY, MEDICARE REIMBURSES HOSPITALS ONLY 92 CENTS FOR EVERY DOLLAR THEY SPEND TO TAKE CARE OF MEDICARE PATIENTS. THE MEDICARE PAYMENT ADVISORY COMMISSION (""MEDPAC"") IN ITS MARCH 2007 REPORT TO CONGRESS CAUTIONED THAT UNDERPAYMENT WILL GET EVEN WORSE, WITH MARGINS REACHING A 10-YEAR LOW AT NEGATIVE 5.4 PERCENT. - MANY MEDICARE BENEFICIARIES, LIKE THEIR MEDICAID COUNTERPARTS, ARE POOR. MORE THAN 46 PERCENT OF MEDICARE SPENDING IS FOR BENEFICIARIES WHOSE INCOME IS BELOW 200 PERCENT OF THE FEDERAL POVERTY LEVEL. MANY OF THOSE MEDICARE BENEFICIARIES ARE ALSO ELIGIBLE FOR MEDICAID -- SO CALLED ""DUAL ELIGIBLES."" THERE IS EVERY COMPELLING PUBLIC POLICY REASON TO TREAT MEDICARE AND MEDICAID UNDERPAYMENTS SIMILARLY FOR PURPOSES OF A HOSPITAL'S COMMUNITY BENEFIT AND INCLUDE THESE COSTS ON FORM 990, SCHEDULE H, PART I. MEDICARE UNDERPAYMENT MUST BE SHOULDERED BY THE HOSPITAL IN ORDER TO CONTINUE TREATING THE COMMUNITY'S ELDERLY AND POOR. THESE UNDERPAYMENTS REPRESENT A REAL COST OF SERVING THE COMMUNITY AND SHOULD COUNT AS A QUANTIFIABLE COMMUNITY BENEFIT. BOTH THE AHA AND THIS ORGANIZATION ALSO FEEL THAT PATIENT BAD DEBT IS A COMMUNITY BENEFIT AND THUS INCLUDABLE ON THE FORM 990, SCHEDULE H, PART I. LIKE MEDICARE UNDERPAYMENT (SHORTFALLS), THERE ALSO ARE COMPELLING REASONS THAT PATIENT BAD DEBT SHOULD BE COUNTED AS QUANTIFIABLE COMMUNITY BENEFIT AS FOLLOWS: - A SIGNIFICANT MAJORITY OF BAD DEBT IS ATTRIBUTABLE TO LOW-INCOME PATIENTS, WHO, FOR MANY REASONS, DECLINE TO COMPLETE THE FORMS REQUIRED TO ESTABLISH ELIGIBILITY FOR HOSPITALS' CHARITY CARE OR FINANCIAL ASSISTANCE PROGRAMS. A 2006 CONGRESSIONAL BUDGET OFFICE (""CBO"") REPORT, NONPROFIT HOSPITALS AND THE PROVISION OF COMMUNITY BENEFITS, CITED TWO STUDIES INDICATING THAT ""THE GREAT MAJORITY OF BAD DEBT WAS ATTRIBUTABLE TO PATIENTS WITH INCOMES BELOW 200% OF THE FEDERAL POVERTY LINE."" - THE REPORT ALSO NOTED THAT A SUBSTANTIAL PORTION OF BAD DEBT IS PENDING CHARITY CARE. UNLIKE BAD DEBT IN OTHER INDUSTRIES, HOSPITAL BAD DEBT IS COMPLICATED BY THE FACT THAT HOSPITALS FOLLOW THEIR MISSION TO THE COMMUNITY AND TREAT EVERY PATIENT THAT COMES THROUGH THEIR EMERGENCY DEPARTMENT, REGARDLESS OF ABILITY TO PAY. PATIENTS WHO HAVE OUTSTANDING BILLS ARE NOT TURNED AWAY, UNLIKE OTHER INDUSTRIES. BAD DEBT IS FURTHER COMPLICATED BY THE AUDITING INDUSTRY'S STANDARDS ON REPORTING CHARITY CARE. MANY PATIENTS CANNOT OR DO NOT PROVIDE THE NECESSARY, EXTENSIVE DOCUMENTATION REQUIRED TO BE DEEMED CHARITY CARE BY AUDITORS. AS A RESULT, ROUGHLY 40% OF BAD DEBT IS PENDING CHARITY CARE. - THE CBO CONCLUDED THAT ITS FINDINGS ""SUPPORT THE VALIDITY OF THE USE OF UNCOMPENSATED CARE [BAD DEBT AND CHARITY CARE] AS A MEASURE OF COMMUNITY BENEFITS"" ASSUMING THE FINDINGS ARE GENERALIZABLE NATIONWIDE; THE EXPERIENCE OF HOSPITALS AROUND THE NATION REINFORCES THAT THEY ARE GENERALIZABLE.

THE COMMUNITY BENEFIT STANDARD IS THE CURRENT STANDARD FOR A HOSPITAL FOR RECOGNITION AS A TAX-EXEMPT AND CHARITABLE ORGANIZATION UNDER INTERNAL REVENUE CODE (""IRC"") 501(C)(3). THE ORGANIZATION IS RECOGNIZED AS A TAX-EXEMPT ENTITY AND CHARITABLE ORGANIZATION UNDER 501(C)(3) OF THE IRC. ALTHOUGH THERE IS NO DEFINITION IN THE TAX CODE FOR THE TERM ""CHARITABLE"" A REGULATION PROMULGATED BY THE DEPARTMENT OF THE TREASURY PROVIDES SOME GUIDANCE AND STATES THAT ""[T]HE TERM CHARITABLE IS USED IN SECTION 501(C)(3) IN ITS GENERALLY ACCEPTED LEGAL SENSE,"" AND PROVIDES EXAMPLES OF CHARITABLE PURPOSES, INCLUDING THE RELIEF OF THE POOR OR UNPRIVILEGED; THE PROMOTION OF SOCIAL WELFARE; AND THE ADVANCEMENT OF EDUCATION, RELIGION, AND SCIENCE. NOTE IT DOES NOT EXPLICITLY ADDRESS THE ACTIVITIES OF HOSPITALS. IN THE ABSENCE OF EXPLICIT STATUTORY OR REGULATORY REQUIREMENTS APPLYING THE TERM ""CHARITABLE"" TO HOSPITALS, IT HAS BEEN LEFT TO THE IRS TO DETERMINE THE CRITERIA HOSPITALS MUST MEET TO QUALIFY AS IRC 501(C)(3) CHARITABLE ORGANIZATIONS. THE ORIGINAL STANDARD WAS KNOWN AS THE CHARITY CARE STANDARD. THIS STANDARD WAS REPLACED BY THE IRS WITH THE COMMUNITY BENEFIT STANDARD WHICH IS THE CURRENT STANDARD. CHARITY CARE STANDARD IN 1956, THE IRS ISSUED REVENUE RULING 56-185, WHICH ADDRESSED THE REQUIREMENTS HOSPITALS NEEDED TO MEET IN ORDER TO QUALIFY FOR IRC 501(C)(3) STATUS. ONE OF THESE REQUIREMENTS IS KNOWN AS THE ""CHARITY CARE STANDARD."" UNDER THE STANDARD, A HOSPITAL HAD TO PROVIDE, TO THE EXTENT OF ITS FINANCIAL ABILITY, FREE OR REDUCED-COST CARE TO PATIENTS UNABLE TO PAY FOR IT. A HOSPITAL THAT EXPECTED FULL PAYMENT DID NOT, ACCORDING TO THE RULING, PROVIDE CHARITY CARE BASED ON THE FACT THAT SOME PATIENTS ULTIMATELY FAILED TO PAY. THE RULING EMPHASIZED THAT A LOW LEVEL OF CHARITY CARE DID NOT NECESSARILY MEAN THAT A HOSPITAL HAD FAILED TO MEET THE REQUIREMENT SINCE THAT LEVEL COULD REFLECT ITS FINANCIAL ABILITY TO PROVIDE SUCH CARE. THE RULING ALSO NOTED THAT PUBLICLY SUPPORTED COMMUNITY HOSPITALS WOULD NORMALLY QUALIFY AS CHARITABLE ORGANIZATIONS BECAUSE THEY SERVE THE ENTIRE COMMUNITY, AND A LOW LEVEL OF CHARITY CARE WOULD NOT AFFECT A HOSPITAL'S EXEMPT STATUS IF IT WAS DUE TO THE SURROUNDING COMMUNITY'S LACK OF CHARITABLE DEMANDS. COMMUNITY BENEFIT STANDARD IN 1969, THE IRS ISSUED REVENUE RULING 69-545, WHICH ""REMOVE(D)"" FROM REVENUE RULING 56-185 ""THE REQUIREMENTS RELATING TO CARING FOR PATIENTS WITHOUT CHARGE OR AT RATES BELOW COST."" UNDER THE STANDARD DEVELOPED IN REVENUE RULING 69-545, WHICH IS KNOWN AS THE ""COMMUNITY BENEFIT STANDARD,"" HOSPITALS ARE JUDGED ON WHETHER THEY PROMOTE THE HEALTH OF A BROAD CLASS OF INDIVIDUALS IN THE COMMUNITY. THE RULING INVOLVED A HOSPITAL THAT ONLY ADMITTED INDIVIDUALS WHO COULD PAY FOR THE SERVICES (BY THEMSELVES, PRIVATE INSURANCE, OR PUBLIC PROGRAMS SUCH AS MEDICARE), BUT OPERATED A FULL-TIME EMERGENCY ROOM THAT WAS OPEN TO EVERYONE. THE IRS RULED THAT THE HOSPITAL QUALIFIED AS A CHARITABLE ORGANIZATION BECAUSE IT PROMOTED THE HEALTH OF PEOPLE IN ITS COMMUNITY. THE IRS REASONED THAT BECAUSE THE PROMOTION OF HEALTH WAS A CHARITABLE PURPOSE ACCORDING TO THE GENERAL LAW OF CHARITY, IT FELL WITHIN THE ""GENERALLY ACCEPTED LEGAL SENSE"" OF THE TERM ""CHARITABLE,"" AS REQUIRED BY TREAS. REG. 1.501(C)(3)-1(D)(2). THE IRS RULING STATED THAT THE PROMOTION OF HEALTH, LIKE THE RELIEF OF POVERTY AND THE ADVANCEMENT OF EDUCATION AND RELIGION, IS ONE OF THE PURPOSES IN THE GENERAL LAW OF CHARITY THAT IS DEEMED BENEFICIAL TO THE COMMUNITY AS A WHOLE EVEN THOUGH THE CLASS OF BENEFICIARIES ELIGIBLE TO RECEIVE A DIRECT BENEFIT FROM ITS ACTIVITIES DOES NOT INCLUDE ALL MEMBERS OF THE COMMUNITY, SUCH AS INDIGENT MEMBERS OF THE COMMUNITY, PROVIDED THAT THE CLASS IS NOT SO SMALL THAT ITS RELIEF IS NOT OF BENEFIT TO THE COMMUNITY. THE IRS CONCLUDED THAT THE HOSPITAL WAS ""PROMOTING THE HEALTH OF A CLASS OF PERSONS THAT IS BROAD ENOUGH TO BENEFIT THE COMMUNITY"" BECAUSE ITS EMERGENCY ROOM WAS OPEN TO ALL AND IT PROVIDED CARE TO EVERYONE WHO COULD PAY, WHETHER DIRECTLY OR THROUGH THIRD-PARTY REIMBURSEMENT. OTHER CHARACTERISTICS OF THE HOSPITAL THAT THE IRS HIGHLIGHTED INCLUDED THE FOLLOWING: ITS SURPLUS FUNDS WERE USED TO IMPROVE PATIENT CARE, EXPAND HOSPITAL FACILITIES, AND ADVANCE MEDICAL TRAINING, EDUCATION, AND RESEARCH; IT WAS CONTROLLED BY A BOARD OF TRUSTEES THAT CONSISTED OF INDEPENDENT CIVIC LEADERS; AND HOSPITAL MEDICAL STAFF PRIVILEGES WERE AVAILABLE TO ALL QUALIFIED PHYSICIANS. THE AMERICAN HOSPITAL ASSOCIATION (""AHA"") BELIEVES THAT MEDICARE UNDERPAYMENTS (SHORTFALL) AND BAD DEBT ARE COMMUNITY BENEFIT AND THUS INCLUDABLE ON THE FORM 990, SCHEDULE H, PART I. THIS ORGANIZATION AGREES WITH THE AHA POSITION. AS OUTLINED IN THE AHA LETTER TO THE IRS DATED AUGUST 21, 2007 WITH RESPECT TO THE FIRST PUBLISHED DRAFT OF THE NEW FORM 990 AND SCHEDULE H, THE AHA FELT THAT THE IRS SHOULD INCORPORATE THE FULL VALUE OF THE COMMUNITY BENEFIT THAT HOSPITALS PROVIDE BY COUNTING MEDICARE UNDERPAYMENTS (SHORTFALL) AS QUANTIFIABLE COMMUNITY BENEFIT FOR THE FOLLOWING REASONS: - PROVIDING CARE FOR THE ELDERLY AND SERVING MEDICARE PATIENTS IS AN ESSENTIAL PART OF THE COMMUNITY BENEFIT STANDARD. - MEDICARE, LIKE MEDICAID, DOES NOT PAY THE FULL COST OF CARE. RECENTLY, MEDICARE REIMBURSES HOSPITALS ONLY 92 CENTS FOR EVERY DOLLAR THEY SPEND TO TAKE CARE OF MEDICARE PATIENTS. THE MEDICARE PAYMENT ADVISORY COMMISSION (""MEDPAC"") IN ITS MARCH 2007 REPORT TO CONGRESS CAUTIONED THAT UNDERPAYMENT WILL GET EVEN WORSE, WITH MARGINS REACHING A 10-YEAR LOW AT NEGATIVE 5.4 PERCENT. - MANY MEDICARE BENEFICIARIES, LIKE THEIR MEDICAID COUNTERPARTS, ARE POOR. MORE THAN 46 PERCENT OF MEDICARE SPENDING IS FOR BENEFICIARIES WHOSE INCOME IS BELOW 200 PERCENT OF THE FEDERAL POVERTY LEVEL. MANY OF THOSE MEDICARE BENEFICIARIES ARE ALSO ELIGIBLE FOR MEDICAID -- SO CALLED ""DUAL ELIGIBLES."" THERE IS EVERY COMPELLING PUBLIC POLICY REASON TO TREAT MEDICARE AND MEDICAID UNDERPAYMENTS SIMILARLY FOR PURPOSES OF A HOSPITAL'S COMMUNITY BENEFIT AND INCLUDE THESE COSTS ON FORM 990, SCHEDULE H, PART I. MEDICARE UNDERPAYMENT MUST BE SHOULDERED BY THE HOSPITAL IN ORDER TO CONTINUE TREATING THE COMMUNITY'S ELDERLY AND POOR. THESE UNDERPAYMENTS REPRESENT A REAL COST OF SERVING THE COMMUNITY AND SHOULD COUNT AS A QUANTIFIABLE COMMUNITY BENEFIT. BOTH THE AHA AND THIS ORGANIZATION ALSO FEEL THAT PATIENT BAD DEBT IS A COMMUNITY BENEFIT AND THUS INCLUDABLE ON THE FORM 990, SCHEDULE H, PART I. LIKE MEDICARE UNDERPAYMENT (SHORTFALLS), THERE ALSO ARE COMPELLING REASONS THAT PATIENT BAD DEBT SHOULD BE COUNTED AS QUANTIFIABLE COMMUNITY BENEFIT AS FOLLOWS: - A SIGNIFICANT MAJORITY OF BAD DEBT IS ATTRIBUTABLE TO LOW-INCOME PATIENTS, WHO, FOR MANY REASONS, DECLINE TO COMPLETE THE FORMS REQUIRED TO ESTABLISH ELIGIBILITY FOR HOSPITALS' CHARITY CARE OR FINANCIAL ASSISTANCE PROGRAMS. A 2006 CONGRESSIONAL BUDGET OFFICE (""CBO"") REPORT, NONPROFIT HOSPITALS AND THE PROVISION OF COMMUNITY BENEFITS, CITED TWO STUDIES INDICATING THAT ""THE GREAT MAJORITY OF BAD DEBT WAS ATTRIBUTABLE TO PATIENTS WITH INCOMES BELOW 200% OF THE FEDERAL POVERTY LINE."" - THE REPORT ALSO NOTED THAT A SUBSTANTIAL PORTION OF BAD DEBT IS PENDING CHARITY CARE. UNLIKE BAD DEBT IN OTHER INDUSTRIES, HOSPITAL BAD DEBT IS COMPLICATED BY THE FACT THAT HOSPITALS FOLLOW THEIR MISSION TO THE COMMUNITY AND TREAT EVERY PATIENT THAT COMES THROUGH THEIR EMERGENCY DEPARTMENT, REGARDLESS OF ABILITY TO PAY. PATIENTS WHO HAVE OUTSTANDING BILLS ARE NOT TURNED AWAY, UNLIKE OTHER INDUSTRIES. BAD DEBT IS FURTHER COMPLICATED BY THE AUDITING INDUSTRY'S STANDARDS ON REPORTING CHARITY CARE. MANY PATIENTS CANNOT OR DO NOT PROVIDE THE NECESSARY, EXTENSIVE DOCUMENTATION REQUIRED TO BE DEEMED CHARITY CARE BY AUDITORS. AS A RESULT, ROUGHLY 40% OF BAD DEBT IS PENDING CHARITY CARE. - THE CBO CONCLUDED THAT ITS FINDINGS ""SUPPORT THE VALIDITY OF THE USE OF UNCOMPENSATED CARE [BAD DEBT"

THE GROUP HELD A SERIES OF MEETINGS TO REVIEW ACA REQUIREMENTS WITH POLICY EXPERTS FROM THE AMERICAN HOSPITAL ASSOCIATION AND CONSIDERED THE TYPES OF RESOURCES THAT MIGHT BE NEEDED TO CONDUCT NEEDS ASSESSMENTS. UNDER THE WORKGROUP'S GUIDANCE, DVHC DEVELOPED A SCOPE OF WORK TO DEFINE THE RESEARCH SERVICES AND OTHER RESOURCES WHICH HOSPITALS MIGHT NEED TO ASSIST IN CONDUCTING COMMUNITY HEALTH NEEDS ASSESSMENTS. BASED ON THE SCOPE OF WORK, DVHC ISSUED A REQUEST FOR PROPOSAL TO IDENTIFY HIGHLY QUALIFIED RESEARCH PARTNERS WHO COULD SUPPORT HOSPITALS IN CONDUCTING NEEDS ASSESSMENTS. AFTER A RIGOROUS EVALUATION PROCESS THAT INCLUDED INTENSIVE INPUT FROM WORKGROUP MEMBERS, PUBLIC HEALTH MANAGEMENT CORPORATION (""PHMC"") WAS SELECTED AS THE MOST APPROPRIATE RESEARCH PARTNER. PHMC'S SELECTION WAS DUE IN PART TO THEIR COMMUNITY HEALTH DATA BASE'S IN-DEPTH, ZIP-CODE-LEVEL HEALTH INFORMATION FOR THE FIVE-COUNTY REGION.

In addition, the hospital has a Presumptive Charity Care process where self pay patients not applying for financial assistance are evaluated based on income data received from Experian, the credit bureau. In addition, during the registration process, the patient can be flagged as Presumptive Charity Care if they provide documentation that their income is less than 200 of the federal poverty line FPL. Presumptive Charity Care is also income based, but it does not require a formal application. As of January 1, 2014, this evaluation started taking place prior to the initial bill to the patient per state regulations.

Part VI, Item 4 - COMMUNITY INFORMATION: The Medical Center is located in Sussex County, the southern-most of three Delaware counties, which consists of 938 square miles, or 48% of Delaware's entire land area. Because of its climate and low property taxes, Sussex County has become an attractive retirement community. All of the county's growth over the next decade is projected to come from persons moving into the county. Traditionally, Sussex County has been regarded as a rural agricultural area. In many respects, it remains an agricultural area with 167 persons per square mile compared with the statewide average of 401 persons. However, the eastern edge of Sussex County that fronts on the Delaware Bay and Atlantic Ocean has become a major tourist resort and, most recently, a favored retirement area, retail, and hospitality center. Eastern and Southeastern Sussex County, which is Beebe Medical Center's primary service area, is particularly attractive due to its proximity to the Atlantic Ocean and Delaware Bay. As a result, the Medical Center generally experiences a significant increase in patient visits during the summer periods. The retirement age group is the fastest growing segment of the population in the Medical Center's service area due to the many retirement communities that have developed in the Sussex County area. With the 2000 Census, the Medicare age group comprised 22% of the population in the Medical Center's primary service area, compared with 18.5% for all of Sussex County. The 10-year (1990-2000) national growth rate of persons age 65 and older was at 12%, while in Delaware, the rate was 26%. However, in Sussex County, the 10-year growth rate of persons age 65 and older is 53%, or four times the national average and twice the statewide average. The population of Sussex County increased 37.8% between 2000 and 2010, growing to 215,000 people in 2010 residing year-round in the hospital's service area. The most recent population growth projection for persons older than 65 years for the Medical Center's primary service area is expected to be 24.3%.

MEDICARE SHORTFALLS MUST BE ABSORBED BY GCMC IN ORDER TO CONTINUE TREATING THE ELDERLY IN OUR COMMUNITY. GCMC PROVIDES CARE REGARDLESS OF THE MEDICARE SHORTFALL AND THEREBY RELIEVES THE FEDERAL GOVERNMENT OF THE BURDEN OF PAYING THE FULL COST FOR PROVIDING CARE TO MEDICARE PATIENTS.

Management relies on the results of detailed reviews of historical write-offs and recoveries as a primary source of information to utilize in estimating the collectability of the Company's accounts receivable. The results of the detailed reviews of historical write-offs and recoveries, adjusted for changes in trends and conditions, are used to estimate the allowance for doubtful accounts for the current period.

The primary collection risks relate to uninsured patient accounts, including patient accounts for which the primary insurance carrier has paid the amounts covered by the applicable agreement, but patient responsibility amounts (deductibles and copayments) remain outstanding. The provision for doubtful accounts and the allowance for doubtful accounts relate primarily to amounts due directly from patients. An estimated allowance for doubtful accounts is recorded for all uninsured accounts, regardless of the aging of those accounts. Accounts are written off when all reasonable internal and external collections efforts have been performed. Our collection policies include a review of all accounts against certain standard collection criteria, upon completion of our internal collection efforts. Accounts determined to possess positive collectability attributes are forwarded to a secondary external collections agency and the other accounts are written off. The accounts that are not collected by the secondary external collection agency are written off when they are returned to us by the collection agency (usually within 12 months). Write-offs are based upon specific identification and the write-off process requires a write-off adjustment entry to the patient accounting system. We do not pursue collection of amounts related to patients that meet our guidelines to qualify as charity care. The methodology to determine the bad debt expense reported at cost on Part III, Line 2 is to take the ratio of patient care costs to gross patient charges and multiply this resulting ratio by the gross charges for bad debt accounts."

Notices highlighting the provision of uncompensated care will be posted prominently in the admissions area, the business office, and the emergency room (Attachment B). These notices will be provided in English and Spanish. The hospital will make a reasonable effort to communicate the meaning of the notices to individuals who may not be able to read or understand them.

The discount is recorded as an adjustment to gross revenue and is not recorded in bad debt expense. If the balance after discount is not paid or not paid in full, the unpaid amount will be written off to bad debt expense. When a patient remits a payment on an account that has already been written off to bad debt expense, the payment is recorded as a recovery of bad debt, which reduces bad debt expense."

The cost report segregates the total facility actual expenses into costs for support departments, clinical departments (routine and ancillary) and nonreimburseable departments. The cost report uses appropriate statistical bases to ""step down"" support costs to allowable clinical and nonreimburseable departments. The charges for clinical departments are matched to the total cost for these departments for a cost-to-charge ratio. Medicare-specific allowable costs for in- and outpatient ancillary departments are computed by applying the department-specific cost-to-charge ratio to the Medicare program charges by department. For routine departments, a per diem total cost is computed and applied to Medicare program days for the Medicare routine program cost.The organization feels the total shortfall of Medicare reimbursement compared to computed Medicare allowable costs should be treated as community benefit. The hospital improves access to patient care by providing services regardless of a patient's ability to pay or the hospital's ability to receive full cost reimbursement for services. The hospital also relieves the government of a financial burden when it provides care to publically insured patients where reimbursement is less than cost of providing the service."

Becky Clay Christenson, of The Clay Christensen Group, facilitated conversation to prioritize and vet findings from the initial data collection. Jason W. Smith, PhD, consulted on the CHNA and implementation strategy process, documenting method, analyzing data, and synthesizing components into a public document. The CHNA was conducted during Fiscal Year 2013 (September 1, 2012 to August 31, 2013.) in order to prepare documents by the end of the fiscal year. It was determined that existing secondary data, augmented by a key informant survey, would be used to identify and prioritize health indicators. An executive summary and report was then presented to system leadership from Mission and Business Development. Findings were then presented to the St. Mary's Hospital Senior Operations Team for further review and comment. Finally, a presentation was made to the Bon Secours Richmond Health System Board for final approval prior to being made available to the public.Secondary Data:The core of the secondary data analysis was conducted by CHS in order to develop a Community Health Indicator Profile. The analysis intentionally did not include every possible indicator, but instead focused on key metrics that provide a broad insight into community health. Availability of data sources was also considered in selection of content. In many cases, results can be considered in comparison to Virginia averages. Foundational source of data include: Alteryx, Inc.; Virginia Department of Health; hospital discharge data from Virginia Health Information, Inc.; Health Resources and Administration data. In other cases, data was only readily available at the state or national levels and synthetic estimates were created by CHS in order to further develop the community profile. CHS developed statistical models to produce estimates where local data was not available. This analysis was based on the CDC's Behavioral Risk Factor Surveillance Survey; the Virginia Foundation for Youth's Market Decisions' 2010 Obesity Survey; a report produced for Virginia Healthcare Foundation by Urban Institute; and local demographic characteristics obtained by Alteryx, Inc.

In addition, patient statements request that patients apply for financial assistance, if needed, once any patient financial obligation is determined.Bon Secours is committed to ensuring access to health care services for all. As a health care provider, Bon Secours treats all patients, whether insured, underinsured or uninsured, with dignity, respect and compassion throughout admission, delivery of services, discharge and billing and collection processes. Bon Secours addresses the needs of the uninsured by providing free or reduced fees on hospital services, community outreach efforts to assist with enrollment in Medicaid and other medical coverage programs, including free community-based preventive and primary care services. Bon Secours proactively screens to identify individuals and their families who may qualify for federal, state or local health insurance programs or the Bon Secours Patient Financial Assistance Program (""FAP"") and assist the potential eligible patients through the qualification process. Potentially eligible patients that do not qualify for a federal or state health insurance program are referred to the Financial Assistance Coordinator located in Patient Financial Services for assistance in completing the documentation required to establish FAP eligibility. Patients are responsible for providing the information necessary to complete the documentation. The FAP aids uninsured and underinsured patients who do not qualify for government-sponsored health insurance and who communicate their inability to pay for their medical care. The FAP provides 100% financial assistance to uninsured patients with annual family incomes at or below 200% of the Federal Poverty Guidelines (""FPG""), A sliding scale assistance policy is afforded patients that exceed the income guidelines for 100% assistance. Sliding scale assistance is provided to patients and progressively declines in proportion to the patient's higher income level. Additionally, all uninsured (i.e. self pay) patients are given a reduction to the amount of the full charges for medically necessary services through a community service adjustment (""CSA""). The CSA is market adjusted and based on the payment discount received by other health care payers doing business in the community. For these patients, the FAP also sets a maximum annual family payment liability to ensure that no family suffers a catastrophic financial burden to receive necessary health care services. Based on research conducted by the Tax Foundation, a non partisan tax research group based in Washington DC, the maximum annual family liability is based on a sliding scale determined by the family income and size. In addition, a variety of other potential payment options are available. Bon Secours is dedicated to meeting the needs of non-English speaking patients by having on-site Spanish translators, and other language translation services. In addition, Bon Secours employs a telephone language service which assists in meeting any language needs that arise.

To determine the cost of Medicaid services provided, a cost-to-charge ratio is applied to traditional and managed Medicaid gross charges captured in the patient accounting system and general ledger. Payments include payments for individual claims, payments from the Medicaid program paid outside the claim process (such as medical education payments) and expected or actual cost report settlements.Part I, line 7c: Unreimbursed costs from other means-tested government programs are computed by applying a cost-to-charge ratio to the total charges to patients covered under these programs.

Estimates are based on historical collection rates.When an uninsured patient is billed for patient care services, the charges are automatically discounted and the patient is requested to only pay the amount after discount. The discount is recorded as an adjustment to gross revenue and is not recorded in bad debt expense. If the balance after discount is not paid or not paid in full, the unpaid amount will be written off to bad debt expense. When a patient remits a payment on an account that has already been written off to bad debt expense, the payment is recorded as a recovery of bad debt, which reduces bad debt expense."

201521949349300627,541744931,"Part III, Line 8:","Medicare allowable costs reflected in Part III come directly from the facility's Medicare cost report. The cost report segregates the total facility actual expenses into costs for support departments, clinical departments (routine and ancillary) and nonreimburseable departments. The cost report uses appropriate statistical bases to ""step down"" support costs to allowable clinical and nonreimburseable departments. The charges for clinical departments are matched to the total cost for these departments for a cost-to-charge ratio. Medicare-specific allowable costs for in- and outpatient ancillary departments are computed by applying the department-specific cost-to-charge ratio to the Medicare program charges by department. For routine departments, a per diem total cost is computed and applied to Medicare program days for the Medicare routine program cost.The organization feels the total shortfall of Medicare reimbursement compared to computed Medicare allowable costs should be treated as community benefit. The hospital improves access to patient care by providing services regardless of a patient's ability to pay or the hospital's ability to receive full cost reimbursement for services. The hospital also relieves the government of a financial burden when it provides care to publically insured patients where reimbursement is less than cost of providing the service."
201521949349300627,541744931,"Part III, Line 9b:","The hospital has a written policy that describes collection practices applying to patients that qualify for charity care or financial assistance. If full assistance is approved, no collection efforts are pursued on that patient's account(s). If partial assistance is provided, the patient is responsible for the adjusted account balance and collection efforts will follow the established practices for all patients where a self-pay balance exists. Collection efforts are not pursued on any pending Financial Assistance Program (FAP) account.Specific criteria exist for how much financial assistance, partial or total, will be provided to the patient based on the assessed need. Criteria is based on Federal Poverty Guidelines and is reviewed and updated annually. Once a patient has been deemed eligible for the FAP, the patient is notified by letter within 60 days after receipt of the application and supporting documentation. The patient retains eligibility for a period of twelve months from the date of the application. This eligibility is signaled to hospital admissions, billing and collection staff by the assignment of a specific financial class with accompanying eligibility dates. At the end of those twelve months, the patient is responsible for reapplying for FAP eligibility."
201521949349300627,541744931,"Part VI, Line 2:","BSRHS contracted with Community Health Solutions (CHS), a local Healthcare Consultant who was recommended by the Virginia Hospital and Healthcare Association (VHHA) to assist with data collection and analysis. Becky Clay Christenson, of The Clay Christensen Group, facilitated conversation to prioritize and vet findings from the initial data collection. Jason W. Smith, PhD, consulted on the CHNA and implementation strategy process, documenting method, analyzing data, and synthesizing components into a public document. The CHNA was conducted during Fiscal Year 2013 (September 1, 2012 to August 31, 2013.) in order to prepare documents by the end of the fiscal year. It was determined that existing secondary data, augmented by a key informant survey, would be used to identify and prioritize health indicators. An executive summary and report was then presented to system leadership from Mission and Business Development. Findings were then presented to the Memorial Regional/Richmond Community Operations Team for further review and comment. Finally, a presentation was made to the Bon Secours Richmond Health System Board for final approval prior to being made available to the public.Secondary DataThe core of the secondary data analysis was conducted by CHS in order to develop a Community Health Indicator Profile. The analysis intentionally did not include every possible indicator, but instead focused on key metrics that provide a broad insight into community health. Availability of data sources was also considered in selection of content. In many cases, results can be considered in comparison to Virginia averages. Foundational source of data include: Alteryx, Inc.; Virginia Department of Health; hospital discharge data from Virginia Health Information, Inc.; Health Resources and Administration data. In other cases, data was only readily available at the state or national levels and synthetic estimates were created by CHS in order to further develop the community profile. CHS developed statistical models to produce estimates where local data was not available. This analysis was based on the CDC's Behavioral Risk Factor Surveillance Survey; the Virginia Foundation for Youth's Market Decisions' 2010 Obesity Survey; a report produced for Virginia Healthcare Foundation by Urban Institute; and local demographic characteristics obtained by Alteryx, Inc. Because the data is extrapolated, meaningful comparisons to state and national averages cannot be made.Community Input Input from community members was included in assessing health care needs as previously described in Part V, Section B, Line 3."

In addition, patient statements request that patients apply for financial assistance, if needed, once any patient financial obligation is determined.Bon Secours is committed to ensuring access to health care services for all. As a health care provider, Bon Secours treats all patients, whether insured, underinsured or uninsured, with dignity, respect and compassion throughout admission, delivery of services, discharge and billing and collection processes. Bon Secours addresses the needs of the uninsured by providing free or reduced fees on hospital services, community outreach efforts to assist with enrollment in Medicaid and other medical coverage programs, including free community-based preventive and primary care services. Bon Secours proactively screens to identify individuals and their families who may qualify for federal, state or local health insurance programs or the Bon Secours Patient Financial Assistance Program (""FAP"") and assist the potential eligible patients through the qualification process. Potentially eligible patients that do not qualify for a federal or state health insurance program are referred to the Financial Assistance Coordinator located in Patient Financial Services for assistance in completing the documentation required to establish FAP eligibility. Patients are responsible for providing the information necessary to complete the documentation. The FAP aids uninsured and underinsured patients who do not qualify for government-sponsored health insurance and who communicate their inability to pay for their medical care. The FAP provides 100% financial assistance to uninsured patients with annual family incomes at or below 200% of the Federal Poverty Guidelines (""FPG""), A sliding scale assistance policy is afforded patients that exceed the income guidelines for 100% assistance. Sliding scale assistance is provided to patients and progressively declines in proportion to the patient's higher income level. Additionally, all uninsured (i.e. self pay) patients are given a reduction to the amount of the full charges for medically necessary services through a community service adjustment (""CSA""). The CSA is market adjusted and based on the payment discount received by other health care payers doing business in the community. For these patients, the FAP also sets a maximum annual family payment liability to ensure that no family suffers a catastrophic financial burden to receive necessary health care services. Based on research conducted by the Tax Foundation, a non partisan tax research group based in Washington DC, the maximum annual family liability is based on a sliding scale determined by the family income and size. In addition, a variety of other potential payment options are available. Bon Secours is dedicated to meeting the needs of non-English speaking patients by having on-site Spanish translators, and other language translation services. In addition, Bon Secours employs a telephone language service which assists in meeting any language needs that arise. The translation services are offered to non-English speaking patients from admission to discharge, including the financial process."

THE MAJORITY OF THE HOSPITALS' SERVICES ARE RENDERED TO PATIENTS WITH COMMERCIAL OR MANAGED CARE INSURANCE, OR UNDER THE FEDERAL MEDICARE AND CALIFORNIA STATE MEDI-CAL PROGRAMS. REIMBURSEMENT FROM THESE VARIOUS PAYERS IS BASED ON A COMBINATION OF PROSPECTIVELY DETERMINED RATES, DISCOUNTS FROM CHARGES AND HISTORICAL COSTS. Amounts received under the Medicare program are subject to retroactive settlements based on review and final determination by program intermediaries or their agents. Provisions for contractual adjustments and retroactive settlements related to these payers are accrued on an estimated basis in the period the related services are rendered and adjusted in future periods as additional information becomes known or as final settlements are determined. The allowance for doubtful accounts is based upon management's assessment of historical and expected net collections considering historical business and economic conditions, trends in health care coverage, and other collection indicators. Periodically throughout the year management assesses the adequacy of the allowance for doubtful accounts based upon historical write-off experience by payor category. The results of this review are then used to make any modifications to the allowance for doubtful accounts. The determination of charity care generally should be made at the time of admission, or shortly thereafter. However, events after discharge may change the ability of the patient to pay. Designation as Charity Care will only be considered after all payment sources have been exhausted. Hospital charges for patient accounts identified as Charity Care at the time of admission or service are not recognized by the facility as net revenues or net receivables. If patient accounts are identified as Charity Care subsequent to the facility recognizing the charges as revenue, an adjustment is required to classify appropriately the revenue and any bad debt expense previously recorded.

For uninsured and underinsured patients that do not qualify for charity care, the Corporation establishes an allowance to reduce the carrying value of such receivables to their estimated net realizable value. This allowance is established based on the aging of accounts receivable and the historical collection experience by Samaritan Hospital and for each type of payor.

Financial counseling is provided to patients with respect to their payment obligations and hospital bills. Information on hospital-based financial support policies and external programs that provide coverage for services are made available to patients during the pre-registration and registration processes and/or through communications with patients seeking financial assistance. Financial counselors make affirmative efforts to help patients apply for public and private programs for which they may qualify and that may assist them in obtaining and paying for healthcare services. Every effort is made to determine a patient's eligibility prior to, or at the time of, admission or service. However, determination for financial support can be made during any stage of the patient's stay after stabilization or collection cycle. Samaritan Hospital offers financial support to patients with limited means. This support is available to uninsured and underinsured patients who do not qualify for public programs or other assistance. Notification about financial assistance, including contact information, is available through patient brochures, messages on patient bills, posted notices in public registration areas including emergency rooms, admitting and registration departments, and other patient financial services offices. Summaries of hospital programs are made available to appropriate community health and human services agencies and other organizations that assist people in need. Information regarding financial assistance programs is also available on hospital websites. In addition to English, this information is also available in Spanish or other languages, reflecting other primary languages spoken by the population serviced by our hospital. Samaritan Hospital has established a written policy for the billing, collection and support for patients with payment obligations. Samaritan Hospital makes every effort to adhere to the policy and is committed to implementing and applying the policy for assisting patients with limited means in a professional, consistent manner."

Troy is located on the western edge of Rensselaer County and on the eastern bank of the Hudson River. Troy has close ties to the nearby cities of Albany and Schenectady, forming a region popularly called the Capital District. The city is one of the three major centers for the Albany-Schenectady-Troy Metropolitan Statistical Area (MSA), which has a population of 850,957. At the 2010 census, the population of Troy was 50,129.The communities served by Samaritan include the counties of Albany, Rensselaer and Schenectady. The three counties provide a range of geography that includes urban, suburban and rural settings in addition to representing the home zip codes of 65.5% of its patients. The combined population in Albany, Rensselaer, and Schenectady counties was 78.8% White, 9.6% Black, 4.8% Hispanic, 3.7% Asian/Pacific Islander, and 3.0% other races/ethnicities in 2010. Over time, the Capital District population has grown more ethnically diverse, with fewer individuals identified as White Non-Hispanic. In general, persons in the community served by Samaritan tend to be better educated and have a higher income than those in the U.S. as a whole and the state of NY. There is a lower rate of unemployment and fewer persons without health insurance than the state or national comparisons. The population for the three county service areas is 620,414. There are 276,563 housing units in the service area with an average of 64% owner occupied. On average 12.3% of persons live below the poverty level. The median household income is $58,254. Health care access indicators show the Capital District having fewer barriers to care than the Rest of State. Capital District residents, both children and adults, had higher health insurance coverage rates compared to the rest of the State. While the Capital District had good health insurance coverage, still slightly less than 10% of residents were not covered by any form of health insurance. A higher percent of residents also had a regular health care provider."

As we have done for many years, we continue to play a major role in the Healthy Capital District Initiative, an organization dedicated to improving the health of the residents of Albany, Rensselaer and Schenectady Counties. Our partners in this endeavor are the local county health departments, other health care providers, insurers and community members. Samaritan supports many local community health services, churches, and other health care organizations to provide comprehensive and accessible health care services and proactive health care programs, this includes sitting on community boards, committees, and advisory groups.Samaritan also provides services for the broader community as a part of its overall community benefit. The greatest share of these expenses is for educating health professionals, helping to prepare future health care professionals is a distinguishing characteristic of nonprofit health care. This education includes student internships, clinic experience and other education for nurses, physical therapists and other health care students.As a nonprofit organization and as part of St. Peter's Health Partners, a regional governing board comprised largely of independent community members representing the makeup of the area we serve guides Samaritan Hospital. Samaritan has an open medical staff composed of qualified physicians who work to provide care to our communities. All medical staff must undergo a thorough and comprehensive credentialing and orientation process.No part of the income of Samaritan benefits any private individual nor is any private interest being served. All surplus funds are reinvested into the facility, equipment, or programs of the hospital to improve the quality of patient care, expand our facilities, and advance our medical training, education and research programs."

The process results in an actionable community health improvement plan (CHIP) for measurable improvements in the community's health and quality of life as well as a scorecard for implementation and evaluation. The resulting community plan does not focus on one agency or community health challenge; rather, MAPP provides a long-term strategy that addresses the multiple factors that affect health in the community. Community involvement throughout the creation and the implementation of a health improvement plan results in creative solutions to community health problems with an improved focus on priorities, reduced duplication of services, increased collaboration on projects and activities, and increased capacity to garner additional resources. Moreover, continous community involvement leads to community ownership of the process. Community ownership, in turn, increases the credibility and sustainability of the health improvement efforts."

If a patient is indigent or charity eligible they will be offered assistance through the hospital's charity and indigent care policy including the state's indigent care trust fund. If the patient has no other insurance and fails to qualify for indigent care assistance, the financial counselor can then offer the patient an opportunity to accept a payment plan with discounted payment options based on their ability to pay immediately or over time.

Generally about 85% to 90% of the patient volume comes from this service area although other health systems have a presence in the area as well. Demographically the region is one of the fastest growing in the state as well as the country and the expansion of the services for the patient population reflects a desire to offer healthcare ""closer to home"" since Wellstar is considered a part of a larger metropolitan Atlanta market.

Improvement to health needs stemming from socioeconomic and physical environmental such as air quality and transportation, gain traction from public policy and education. A health system can complement efforts to impact policy, but has to rely on public health, state and local municipalities and federal governmental agencies to drive these types of health improvements. Key questions when addressing health needs are do we have existing facilities and resources dedicated to the health needs showing clear disparities and poor performance? And do we have effective and feasible interventions, a successful solution that has the potential to solve multiple problems, and the opportunity to intervene at the prevention level? WellStar Health System, Inc. and its affiliates will continue to address these and other questions."

In accordance with the System's mission of service to those persons living in poverty and other vulnerable persons, each Health Ministry accepts patients regardless of their ability to pay. The System uses four categories to identify the resources utilized for the care of persons living in poverty and community benefit programs:- Traditional charity care includes the cost of services provided to persons who cannot afford health care because of inadequate resources and/or who are uninsured or underinsured.- Unpaid cost of public programs, excluding Medicare, represents the unpaid cost of services provided to persons covered by public programs for persons living in poverty and other vulnerable persons.- Cost of other programs for persons living in poverty and other vulnerable persons includes unreimbursed costs of programs intentionally designed to serve the persons living in poverty and other vulnerable persons of the community, including substance abusers, the homeless, victims of child abuse, and persons with acquired immune deficiency syndrome.- Community benefit consists of the unreimbursed costs of community benefit programs and services for the general community, not solely for the persons living in poverty, including health promotion and education, health clinics and screenings, and medical research.Discounts are provided to all uninsured patients, including those with the means to pay. Discounts provided to those patients who did not qualify for assistance under charity care guidelines are not included in the cost of providing care of persons living in poverty and other community benefit programs. The cost of providing care to persons living in poverty and other community benefit programs is estimated using internal cost data and is estimated by reducing charges forgone by a factor derived from the ratio of total operating expenses to billed charges for patient care. The amount of traditional charity care provided, determined on the basis of cost, was approximately $18,380,000 for the year ended June 30, 2014.

Community Health Improvement Plans CHIP from both counties place emphasis on three key areas 1 health promotion activities to encourage healthy living and limit the onset of chronic diseases 2 early detection opportunities that include screening populations at risk and 3 successful management strategies for existing diseases and related complications. These strategies, recommended by the Health Impact Pyramid, are based on the interventions evidenced base potential to address health inequities, the ability to measure success and potential reach, potential for broad partner support and collaboration, and political feasibility. This method is based on findings from such organizations as the Institute of Medicine of the National Academies and their report, Accelerating Progress in Obesity Prevention, Solving the Weight of the Nation or the CDCs, Recommended Community Strategies and Measurements to Prevent Obesity in the United States. For each focus area under the selected Prevention Agenda, Prevent Chronic Disease priority, Chemung and Steuben County Partnerships identified objectives and goals that include improvement strategies and performance measures with measurable and time framed targets over the next five years. The proposed chronic disease prevention strategies are evidence based or promising practices. They include activities currently underway by partners and new strategies to be implemented. All proposed strategies in Chemung and Steuben Counties are supported by the HP2 and SHPT partnerships. Chronic disease prevention strategies will be implemented in multiple sectors, including at local schools, worksites, businesses, community organizations, and with providers, to make it easier for residents to make healthy choices. By planning and implementing strategies from many levels of the Health Impact Pyramid, and through our network of diverse partnerships, we can create an environment that is conducive to physical activity, good nutrition and tobacco cessation. The Chemung and Steuben County partnerships have included many suggested activities from the States Prevent Chronic Disease Plan that will encourage increased physical activity, better nutrition and tobacco cessation strategies that aim toward reducing and preventing the incidence of chronic disease in Chemung and Steuben Counties. Some of these interventions include environmental, policy and systems changes to create communities that support physical activity, improved nutrition and breastfeeding, and tobacco cessation. Chemung County will continue its work through the Creating Healthy Places to Live, Work and Play grant and improve parks and playgrounds, establish community gardens to improve access to fresh fruits and vegetables, and work with local restaurant partners to make eating out healthier. Steuben County will continue to work with the cross county Southern Tier Tobacco Awareness Community Partnership, STTAC to establish tobacco free policies and urge members of the Regional Economic Development Council to consider health in their projects. Both counties plan to pursue joint use agreements with local school districts. Promote breast feeding policies at worksites, and create resource guides that promote the counties many opportunities for physical activity and healthy foods, including local farmers markets, parks and hiking trails. Other strategies include the clinical and community solutions such as provider 51 referrals to Diabetes Prevention Programs, Chronic Disease Self Management Programs and Tobacco Cessation Education. One exciting aspect of the CHIP is the unlimited possibilities offered by technological advances. Arnot Health and other local providers are beginning to implement Electronic Health Records, EHR. When fully functional, the benefits of EHRs will include improved quality and convenience of patient care, accuracy of diagnoses, enhanced care coordination, increased patient participation in their care, improved health outcomes and increased practice efficiencies and cost savings. EHRs will give providers decision support tools and available resources to better prevent and manage chronic disease. Arnot Health is currently working towards consolidating existing technologies within the healthcare system, with the objective of getting everyone on the same system organization wide. Consolidating technology within the healthcare system will improve communication among care providers, and between patients with their providers, enhance patient care coordination, improve chronic disease management and health outcomes. Arnot Health is increasing its focus on population health management and working towards increasing the systems abilities and competencies related to population health management. Areas of focus include realigning our health care delivery system to be more patient and ambulatory centric; increasing patient engagement with primary care providers using PCMH as a model; improving care coordination; and improving the management of chronic disease. Successful consolidation of IT systems will, contribute towards the integration and interoperability of data, and data exchange among care providers. Create robust and functional analytics which can identify higher risk patients to better manage chronic disease and improve health outcomes. Equip providers with the competencies needed to manage health care in a more predictive and less reactive way. Reduce preventable utilization of higher cost health care services such as emergency room or inpatient settings. Chemung and Steuben Counties Community Health Improvement Plans propose training primary care providers to talk to their patients about their weight, physical activity, diet and tobacco use and offering professional training opportunities which include programs on prevention, screening, diagnosis and treatment of overweight, obesity and diabetes. Residents and medical students will benefit from this training through the healthcare systems graduate medical education program. Arnot Healths graduate medical education program is offered in partnership with Lake Erie College of Osteopathic Medicine, LECOM. Another CHIP strategy is to investigate the possibility of incorporating referrals to community resources to prevent or manage chronic disease through a link in EHR. Through the use of new technology, follow up calls can be made to check on patient compliance, and provide the opportunity to document and measure the effectiveness of healthcare interventions. 52 Arnot Healths service area includes two Medically Underserved Areas, MUA. Elmiras Census Tract 0007.00 in Chemung County and Troupsburg and Tuscarora Town Service Area in Steuben County. Poor access to care is associated with a higher incidence of chronic disease, poorly managed chronic disease and an increased incidence of preventable hospitalizations. In both counties, the ratio of residents to primary care providers exceeds the NYS average. Arnot Health, through its Arnot Medical Services provider practice group, continues to aggressively recruit providers for the counties most underserved areas, and expand its graduate medical program to help meet identified needs within the MUAs. As Arnot Health works in partnership with Chemung Countys HP2 and Steuben Counties SHPT to implement the CHIPs, we will continue to identify emerging best practices to reduce obesity and tobacco use. Data measures will be developed to assess the effectiveness of our plans in impacting the communitys health, and set mid-course corrections where needed. Promising cases for return on investment will be shared with policymakers. The specifics of Chemung and Steuben Counties Community Health Improvement Plans are outlined in the following CHIP charts.

201502249349301105,010211534,Part VI - Community Information,"Mercy Hospital is a community hospital comprised of three acute inpatient locations, 9 primary care practices, 5 Express Care facilities, and 14 specialty practices. Mercys service area is the greater Portland metropolitan area, roughly comprised of Maines Cumberland County. The population of Cumberland County is 285,456. While Portland is the largest city in Maine, much of the service area is made up of small towns and rural areas surrounding Portland. The Portland area is experiencing an increase in diversity, with at least 6% of area residents born outside of the United States. Many of these new Mainers are refugees and asylum-seekers, who bring a unique set of circumstances and health needs to the community. Approximately 11% of Cumberland county households fall below the federal poverty level. Median household income in the county is $57,000. Maine has an uninsured rate of 11.6% after the implementation of the Affordable Care Act. 12.8 % of Mercy patients had MaineCare during 2014. Also, the U.S. Census Bureau estimates that 12.4% of people living in Cumberland County had annual income below the poverty level during the 2011-2013 American Community Survey.Of Maines 16 counties, Cumberland County ranks third in health outcomes and 2nd for quality of life. Residents have the highest admission rates for depressive disorders, as well as high rates for several sexually transmitted infections. In addition to new Mainers, people experiencing poverty, homelessness, and mental illness are among Cumberland Countys most vulnerable residents. Residents are served by 241 primary care providers and six hospitals, varying from community hospitals such as Mercy to a large tertiary trauma center. Greater Portlands residents are also served by the presence of a Federally-Qualified Health Center (FQHC) with designation to serve the materially poor and homeless populations."

In 2014, Mercy providers Dr. Craig Brett from Cardiology and Dr. Ben Grasso from Behavioral Health Services discuss the impacts of stress and how you can best manage your symptoms on @MPBN Maine Calling. Mercy provides diabetic education and primary care materials at Amistads Health Dinners and at Health on the Move events. Mercys New England Foot and Ankle provides foot care, diabetic screening, and new shoes and socks for 200 homeless persons at the Oxford Street Shelter in Portland in December. Mercy Hospital provides Colonoscopy education to show support for colon health and as a conclusion to National Colorectal Cancer Awareness Month. Visitors are able to stroll through an inflatable, larger-than-life colon replica, taught lifesaving information about colon health, and offered four educational sessions followed by stories from survivors as follows: The Truth About Colon Cancer Dr. Karin Cole, Early Detection Saves Lives Dr. Chris Kleeman; Cutting Edge Treatment Dr. Roger Inhorn and Nutrition and Exercise Saves Lives Joan Lavery McLaughlin and Jennifer Daggett.Mercys Medical Neighborhood is a health collaborative that seeks to provide access to quality healthcare for all uninsured patients in the Greater Portland community through the expansion of our flexible care delivery system. The intent of this model is to promote healthy relationships and rational utilization of services and to reduce the overall cost associated with care of uninsured and underinsured patients. Mercys Emergency Department Care Managers play a critical role in developing a rapport with uninsured patients in the acute setting and engaging the necessary neighborhood resources such as peers, street outreach, or CHOWs to begin the desired transition to a medical home. Experts from area non-profits such as Amistads Peer Support Program, Milestones Homeless Outreach & Mobile Engagement (HOME) Team, outreach workers from the City of Portland, Preble Street, and the Oxford Street Shelter; and Community Health Outreach Workers (CHOWs) from Portlands Health Equity Department respond to the unique needs of the vulnerable patients in Mercys Medical Neighborhood. In 2014, Mercy Hospital reduced both cost and ED utilization and afforded $221,737 in resources towards this community activity. McAuley Residence, a department of Mercy Hospital, is a comprehensive two-year program for women in early recovery with or without children. In the newly-renovated space that is owned by Community Housing of Maine (CHOM), McAuley Residence expanded from six apartments to fifteen apartments with beautiful common space for the residents to gather such as a community kitchen and large playroom for the children. The program serves women who have experienced addiction, homelessness, trauma, and domestic violence. Mercy Hospital provides the staffing (LMSW, LADC, and Peer) at McAuley Residence and provides resources to operate the program annually. Women and their children also have access to the resources of the Mercy Recovery Center, Mercy Primary Care and Specialty Care and New England Eating Disorders Program as needed.

THIS EFFORT IS ACHIEVED BY: -RE-INVESTING SURPLUS FUNDS BACK INTO COMMUNITIES THROUGH PROGRAMS AND SERVICES. -MAKING SURE THAT CARE IS AVAILABLE TO EVERYONE - REGARDLESS OF THE ABILITY TO PAY. -USING COMPASSION AS A CORNERSTONE IN IMPROVING THE HEALTH OF OUR COMMUNITIES. -ATTENDING TO THE NEEDS OF PATIENTS AND THEIR FAMILY MEMBERS BY ADDRESSING THE NEEDS OF THE WHOLE PERSON NOT JUST AS A DISEASE OR A DIAGNOSIS. -PROVIDING A RANGE OF SPECIAL BENEFITS TO THE COMMUNITY, SUCH AS PROGRAMS TO MANAGE CARE FOR PERSONS WITH CHRONIC DISEASES, HEALTH EDUCATION AND DISEASE PREVENTION INITIATIVES, OUTREACH FOR THE ELDERLY, AND CARE FOR PERSONS WHO ARE POOR OR UNINSURED. IN COMPLIANCE WITH IRS GUIDELINES, A YEAR-LONG PROCESS TO DEVELOP A FORMAL COMMUNITY HEALTH NEEDS ASSESSMENT (CHNA) WAS COMPLETED BY HALLMARK HEALTH IN AUGUST 2013, IN COLLABORATION WITH THE INSTITUTE FOR COMMUNITY HEALTH (ICH), A NON-PROFIT ORGANIZATION RECOGNIZED FOR COMMUNITY-BASED PARTICIPATORY RESEARCH, ASSESSMENT, AND DISSEMINATION. THIS PROCESS INCLUDED A REVIEW OF REPUTABLE PUBLIC HEALTH, SOCIO-ECONOMIC, AND FOUNDATION DATA; INPUT FROM THE HALLMARK HEALTH COMMUNITY BENEFITS ADVISORY COUNCIL, COMMUNITY OUTREACH TEAMS, PATIENT/FAMILY ADVISORY COUNCIL, LOCAL COMMUNITY COALITIONS, AND THE COMMUNITY HEALTH NETWORK AREAS MEMBERSHIP. STAKEHOLDER INTERVIEWS AND COMMUNITY SURVEYS WERE ALSO COMPLETED. REFLECTING IRS REQUIREMENTS, AND TO FOSTER TRANSPARENCY, THE ENTIRE CHNA AS WELL AS AN EXECUTIVE SUMMARY OF ITS FINDINGS ARE POSTED ON THE HALLMARK HEALTH SYSTEM WEBSITE AND IN PRINTED VERSIONS AT EACH HOSPITAL CAMPUS AND OTHER KEY SERVICE DELIVERY LOCATIONS IN THE CATCHMENT AREA. ONGOING MONITORING OF THE CHNA AND ITS IDENTIFIED HEALTH PRIORITIES IS THE RESPONSIBILITY OF THE COMMUNITY BENEFITS ADVISORY COUNCIL. AS OF THE END OF FY 2014/TY 2013, THE HALLMARK HEALTH COUNCIL IS COMPRISED OF A MEMBER OF THE HOSPITAL'S BOARD OF TRUSTEES; THE EXECUTIVE VICE PRESIDENT FOR STRATEGY & EXTERNAL AFFAIRS; EXECUTIVE VICE PRESIDENT AND CHIEF LEGAL OFFICER; SYSTEM VICE PRESIDENT OF HOME CARE AND COMMUNITY PROGRAMS; CHIEF MARKETING OFFICER; FISCAL CONTROLLER; SYSTEM DIRECTOR OF HEMATOLOGY-ONCOLOGY; TWO HALLMARK HEALTH-AFFILIATED PHYSICIANS; THREE COMMUNITY REPRESENTATIVES; THE DIRECTOR, COMMUNITY SERVICES; AND THE MANAGER, COMMUNITY BENEFITS. THE COUNCIL ACTS AS OVERSEERS FOR THE CHNA, AND DEFINES THE PROCESS FOR RECOGNIZING CURRENT AND EMERGING HEALTH NEEDS IN THE COMMUNITY, AS WELL AS DEVELOPING A MULTI-YEAR COMMUNITY BENEFITS IMPLEMENTATION PLAN TO RESPOND TO THESE NEEDS. AT THE START OF FY 2014/TY 2013, THE COUNCIL REVIEWED AND SENT THE FY 2014-16 IMPLEMENTATION PLAN TO THE BOARD OF TRUSTEES WHO VOTED TO APPROVE IT AS PRESENTED. THE COUNCIL MEETS QUARTERLY (AND INCREASED TO 6 MEETINGS PER YEAR IN FY 2015) TO PROVIDE INPUT TO THE ONGOING EXECUTION OF THE PLAN, DISCUSS ONGOING COMMUNITY HEALTH ISSUES, AND OFFER INPUT TO THE GOVERNING BOARD REGARDING EMERGING AND NEWLY IDENTIFIED COMMUNITY HEALTH NEEDS. THE COUNCIL ADDED TWO PHYSICIAN REPRESENTATIVES DURING FY 2014/TY 2013, AND PLANS TO WELCOME ADDITIONAL HOSPITAL REPRESENTATIVES (THE MANAGER, INTERPRETER SERVICES AND LICSW MANAGER, CASE MANAGEMENT) IN FY 2015. RECRUITMENT OF COMMUNITY REPRESENTATIVES REFLECTING THE VULNERABLE POPULATIONS IN THE COMMUNITY, AND REPRESENTING DIVERSE CONSTITUENCIES AND VIEWPOINTS, WILL TAKE PLACE ON AN ONGOING BASIS. HALLMARK HEALTH ALSO ACTIVELY PARTICIPATED WITH THE COMMUNITY THROUGH ITS COMMUNITY OUTREACH TEAMS, SOLICITING INPUT FROM KEY COMMUNITY LEADERS, INCLUDING SUPERINTENDENTS OF SCHOOLS, STATE REPRESENTATIVES, BUSINESS LEADERS, FIRE AND POLICE PERSONNEL AND LOCAL HEALTH DEPARTMENTS. ADDITIONAL APPROACHES INCLUDE WORK AS MEMBERS OF COMMUNITY COALITIONS AND WITH THE COMMUNITY HEALTH NETWORK AREAS (CHNA 15 AND 16) DESIGNATED BY THE MA DEPARTMENT OF PUBLIC HEALTH. THESE HAVE PROVEN EFFECTIVE IN GAINING VITAL PERSPECTIVE AROUND THE HEALTH NEEDS OF LOCAL RESIDENTS, AND IN TAILORING OUTREACH MESSAGES AND PROGRAMMING BASED ON WHAT CONSTITUENCIES AND COMMUNITIES VALUE MOST. (COMMUNITY TEAMS FUNCTIONS ARE FURTHER EXPLAINED IN THE DESCRIPTION OF COMMUNITY BUILDING ACTIVITIES IN PART II.) ANOTHER WAY THAT HALLMARK HEALTH ASSESSES NEEDS WITHIN THE COMMUNITY IS THROUGH THE PATIENT/FAMILY ADVISORY COUNCIL (PFAC). THIS COUNCIL WAS FORMED TO OBTAIN FEEDBACK AND IDEAS FROM COMMUNITY MEMBERS ON HOW THE HOSPITALS CAN BE MORE RECEPTIVE TO THE UNIQUE NEEDS OF COMMUNITY RESIDENTS, ESPECIALLY THOSE OF DIVERSE BACKGROUNDS, AND TO PROMOTE THE HIGHEST QUALITY OF PATIENT-CENTERED SERVICES BY FOSTERING A STRONG PARTNERSHIP THROUGH OUTREACH ACTIVITIES WITH COMMUNITY RESIDENTS. THE COUNCIL OFTEN ASSISTS HALLMARK HEALTH STAFF BY PROVIDING INPUT INTO THE PLANNING OF FUTURE COMMUNITY ACTIVITIES AND INITIATIVES. IN FY 2014/TY 2013, PFAC MEMBERS' INPUT WAS SOLICITED ON FURNITURE THAT HALLMARK HEALTH PURCHASED TO UPDATE AND IMPROVE PATIENT ROOMS, A COMPLETE REVISION OF THE HOSPITAL'S PATIENT WELCOME PACKETS, A UNIFORM, SYSTEM-WIDE PROTOCOL FOR PATIENT SIGN-IN PROCEDURES IN OUTPATIENT OFFICES, AND THE CREATION OF A MORE ""USER- FRIENDLY"" PATIENT DISCHARGE REPORT. PFAC MEMBERS RAISED QUESTIONS AROUND PATIENT CALL BUTTONS, SERVED ON A PILOT SUB-GROUP TO TEST THE HOSPITAL'S NEW ELECTRONIC PATIENT PORTAL, PROVIDED FEEDBACK ON THE HOSPITAL'S INTERPRETER SERVICES PROGRAM, AND REVIEWED AND COMMENTED ON PROPOSED RENOVATIONS TO THE EMERGENCY DEPARTMENT AT LAWRENCE MEMORIAL HOSPITAL. AS PART OF ITS EFFORTS TO IMPROVE HEALTH STATUS IN THE CATCHMENT AREA, HALLMARK HEALTH SYSTEM ALSO PARTICIPATES IN A VARIETY OF BROAD-BASED COMMUNITY COALITIONS AND INITIATIVES THAT WORK TOWARDS ADDRESSING THE SPECIFIC AND GENERAL HEALTH NEEDS IN THESE CITIES AND TOWNS. A SAMPLE OF THESE MEMBERSHIPS INCLUDE: MYSTIC VALLEY ELDER SERVICES PROVIDER TASK FORCE; LOCAL COUNCILS ON AGING; THE HEALTHY FAMILIES COMMUNITY COALITION; THE JOINT COMMITTEE FOR CHILDREN'S HEALTH CARE IN EVERETT (JCCHCE); MEDFORD HEALTH MATTERS; TRI-CITY HUNGER NETWORK; CHINESE CULTURE CONNECTION; SUBSTANCE ABUSE PREVENTION COALITIONS IN MELROSE, MEDFORD, WAKEFIELD, READING AND STONEHAM; THE MALDEN'S PROMISE COALITION; DPH MASS IN MOTION PROGRAMS IN MELROSE-WAKEFIELD, MALDEN, AND EVERETT; AND THE MELROSE, STONEHAM, AND WAKEFIELD ALLIANCES AGAINST VIOLENCE. ONE CENTRAL FOCUS OF HALLMARK HEALTH'S COMMUNITY BENEFITS WORK IS TO CONTINUE TO FOSTER RELATIONSHIPS WITH A WIDER ARRAY OF COMMUNITY GROUPS AND LOCAL LEADERS, INCLUDING FAITH-BASED AND GRASSROOTS ORGANIZATIONS. SUCH RELATIONSHIPS PROVIDE INSIGHT INTO HOW THESE GROUPS VIEW HALLMARK HEALTH SYSTEM'S ROLE IN THEIR COMMUNITY, HOW OUR SYSTEM CAN IMPROVE THE WAYS WE SERVE DIVERSE RESIDENTS, AND HOW THE SYSTEM SHOULD STRENGTHEN COLLABORATION TO BEST MEET DIVERGENT HEALTH NEEDS."

MidState coordinates a Community Vision group that interacts with the community to address needs and facilitate responses to identified needs. Through Community Vision, MidState has collaborated with the United Way of Meriden and Wallingford to address food collection and distribution for the needy while also conducting semi-annual food collections within the hospital for distribution to those in need. More specifically, MidState is involved in a Family Zone in Meriden that is modeled after the Harlem Children Zone in New York and provides extended services to families who reside in a targeted segment of the community. MidState representatives also serve on a housing coalition that addresses the need for housing and shelter in its primary service area. Since basic needs, such as food and housing, are tied to health status, MidState's participation in these initiatives alongside the United Way has been important and beneficial to the community the hospital serves. MidState staff is also involved in workforce development activities through a regional board that is focused on training, education, and employment opportunities. This enhances the training of the workforce and also can lead to career opportunities at MidState Medical Center. Furthermore, MidState is proud of the school business partnerships it has in the community, further addressing workforce development efforts among the area's youth and understanding that employment is another factor tied to health status.Since the mid-1990s, MidState has had a close-knit relationship with nearby John Barry Elementary School which has provided opportunities for staff to adopt classrooms and enrich the academic experience of students through read-a-loud days and other classroom activities, as well as promote tailored education to students on important health topics including the signs and symptoms of stroke. By educating students on disease risk factors at an early age, it is the hope that their knowledge base will increase, they will share information with their families and perhaps recognize a health problem in a loved one. Over 20 years ago MidState and its community partners, under the Healthy Meriden initiative, established the Multidisciplinary Geriatric Service Provider Team to bring together all the geriatric service providers in the area to address health issues that the elderly face and how the organizations around the table can better address those issues through collaboration, more coordinated service, and networking. The team still continues to meet monthly and participation is strong. MidState assists with organizing these meetings and serves as a meeting location for the group. Through this specialized team, work is being done to improve the healthcare services available to our aging population.For FY14, the Medical Center expended $10,371 on community building activities as reported on Part II of schedule H and in the narratives above."

A community group, incorporating MidState Medical Center, United Way, Chamber of Commerce, as well as other health and human service organizations, key opinion leaders, business leaders, clergy, and other volunteers collaborate to address these issues. This group has convened community-based task forces to address identified issues.The Center continues to use emergency room data to track increases in medical conditions such as falls, flu, drug overdoses, etc. The same approach is taken in our outpatient clinics. We periodically canvas our Social Work/Case Management staff as to what they are seeing and hearing about as they work with patients. We also track requests from other entities such as area non profits, local government agencies and public schools. These requests often reflect growing needs and issues in our community."

The majority of MidState Medical Center's governing board is comprised of persons who either reside or work in its primary service area, and they are neither employees nor contractors of the Hospital.MidState Medical Center extends medical staff privileges to all qualified physicians in its community. The Hospital/Medical Center has partnered with the Community Health Center to provide health services to the underserved in the community. In addition, MidState participates in Community Vision to improve community health and well-being.MidState has contracted to use the services of an organization to assist its patients in determining eligibility and applying for state and federal means tested programs such as Medicare and Medicaid, as well as for the MidState Medical Center Financial Assistance Program. Additionally, the MidState Emergency Department and satellite MediQuick Urgent Care facilities provide medical care regardless of patients' ability to pay for services. In towns across central Connecticut, MidState Medical Center is committed and focused on efforts to promote health and wellness in the communities the hospital serves. Each year, MidState makes a concerted effort to go above and beyond its call to the community. Our physicians, nurses, and staff reach out to thousands of individuals every year through health-related programs and special events. Additionally, MidState has partnered with various community organizations to improve the quality of life of its residents. MidState and these partners come together on a monthly basis in Community Vision meetings to discuss plans to address community need and determine the best means to promote positive change. Many of the issues address focus on the ongoing work related to the 2012 Community Needs Assessment Project conducted by MidState and the United Way of Meriden and Wallingford. Financial Assistance - MidState Medical Center is the leading safety net provider of acute medical care for the communities it serves. MidState routinely provides services to uninsured patients and to people covered under government programs for which it does not receive full payment. Eligibility for the financial assistance programs is dependent on income and other personal circumstances. Lung Cancer Screening Program - For years lung cancer survival rates have fallen far below that of other cancers, typically, because lung cancer is often found at a later stage when treatment is less effective. However, a study that was published by the New England Journal of Medicine offered new hope in the early detection of lung cancer, suggesting that individuals who are high-risk and undergo a low dose screening CT scan can increase their chances of survival by 20 percent. In the summer of 2013, MidState Medical Center took a giant step forward in the efforts of early detection by launching its Lung Cancer Screening Program, which makes low-dose CT scans available at no charge to patients who qualify. In order to qualify for a free screening, a patient must be a current or former smoker (having quit within the last 15 years), be between the ages of 55 and 74 and healthy enough to undergo treatment, have a smoking history of at least 30 pack-years, and have no previous history of lung cancer. Younger patients between the ages of 50 and 54 may also fit the criteria if they have had a second exposure to their lungs, such as radon or another occupational hazard or a family history of lung cancer. To date, MidState has screened close to 200 individuals, at no charge, in the communities it serves. Doctors estimate that for every 100 people screened, 1 lung cancer will be found. To date, two lung cancers have been detected at early stages, allowing for critical treatment to begin. The program has provided free screenings in the amount of nearly $150,000.Senior Emergency Care Services - In May 2013, with an eye on the health needs of our aging population, MidState began offering a newer, innovative approach to caring for seniors in its Emergency Department. When a patient 65+ comes to our Emergency Department, they are not just treated for the ailment that brought them to the hospital. A multi-disciplinary team also performs a special assessment to gauge the patient's status and whether they may have medication issues, be a fall risk or suffer from ailments like dementia and depression. The hope is to identify follow-up care before the condition worsens. When patients leave our Emergency Department, we make sure they are transitioning home or to another care setting smoothly by developing individualized care plans following discharge, making follow-up appointments with physicians, and referring patients to a reputable, high-quality physician if they do not have a primary care doctor. Connecticut Center for Healthy Aging - Since its inception in 2004, more than 2,500 seniors and their families have benefited from the educational resources, consultation and referral services available through the Connecticut Center for Healthy Aging. The Center has three locations: the New Britain General and Bradley Memorial campuses of The Hospital of Central Connecticut, and most recently, at MidState Medical Center. With the partnership of Central Connecticut Senior Health Services, the center offers assessments and referral services based on identified needs; helps seniors and caregivers with access to medical care, social services, community resources, financial planning and elder law advisors, holistic care and wellness programs; education and training for caregivers, elders and family members.Health Fairs, Support Groups, Programs & Screenings - MidState has coordinated and participated in nearly 65 different program categories, including health fairs, countless educational seminars and dozens of free health screenings. The hospital also offers a number of support groups for cancer patients, new moms, diabetes patients and bereavement support. Through the combination of these programs, MidState has served tens of thousands of people. The LaPlanche Clinic & Geriatric Outreach - MidState's LaPlanche Clinic was established in 1979 to meet the growing needs of the senior population in town. Working collaboratively with the Meriden Senior Center, the clinic is staffed by a registered nurse who provides education and care to seniors. Screenings offered include blood pressure, cholesterol and glucose, as well as regular programming on health topics such as nutrition, heart health, cancer prevention, healthy lifestyles and more. The clinic sees approximately 2,000 patient visits each year. A similar clinic operates out of the Cheshire Senior Center once per week, where another several dozen seniors in MidState's core community receive outstanding clinical care and free blood pressure screenings. MidState also runs an 8-week program called Diet Watch that focuses on nutrition basics to help seniors live healthy lifestyles. Speakers' Bureau - Our MidState physicians and clinicians hold speaking engagements at various community locations to offer individuals the opportunity to ask questions and learn about specific health conditions and ways of leading a healthier lifestyle. Programming is consistently offered free of charge for local senior centers, libraries, YMCAs, women's groups, faith communities, Rotary clubs, Kiwanis, and other community groups. Together the Central Region participates in a Healthy Family FunFest held at the Aqua Turf annually and open to the public free of charge. Last year nearly 2,500 participates attended and took advantage of the numerous screenings, health oriented programs, literature and personnel.Community Partners -MidState takes a collaborative approach to building a healthier community, working with a variety of organizations on a number of initiatives to enhance the health and well-being of those we serve. In the last year, MidState is privileged to have worked with the United Way of Meriden & Wallingford, the Cheshire and Wallingford YMCAS, its local health departments and the Meriden Chamber Health and Wellness Council. MidState has been particularly involved this year in the Activate Wallingford initiative with the Wallingford YMCA to address the issue of childhood obesity in the Wallingford Community. Tremaine Resource Center - Our medical and consumer health library offers a broad range of resources and services to support the needs of patients, caregivers and area residents for accurate and current health information. The Tremaine Resource Center supports student research and offers services to patients in the hospital."

THE AIM IS TO INCORPORATE A TEAM OF PROVIDERS DEDICATED AND PREPARED TO MEET THE CHALLENGING NEEDS OF THE HIGH RISK ELDER POPULATION; TO INTERVENE IN A WAY THAT FOSTERS FUNCTIONAL INDEPENDENCE, WITH THE HIGHEST REGARD TO MAINTAINING A QUALITY OF LIFE. THE STRATEGY AND TACTICS TO ACHIEVE THIS ARE BASED ON THE PATIENT'S FUNCTIONAL GOALS AND ARE DEVELOPED IN A WAY THAT IDENTIFIES THE UNIQUE NEEDS OF THE POPULATION. WITHIN THIS STRATEGY IS AN EMPHASIS ON FALL RISK AND DEPRESSION SCREENING TOOLS. DIABETIC ROSTERSIGNATURE MEDICAL GROUP ENGAGED THE PROVIDERS AND STAFF IN POPULATION HEALTH REVIEWS. OUR FOCUS IS THE DIABETIC PATIENTS WITHIN EACH PRACTICE. THE CARE TEAM MEETS QUARTERLY TO REVIEW ALL DIABETIC PATIENTS AND MONITOR HOW WELL THEIR DIABETES IS IN CONTROL. THE CARE TEAM CONSISTS OF THE PRIMARY CARE PHYSICIAN, NURSE PRACTITIONER, CLINICAL AND CLERICAL STAFF, PHARMACIST AND ENDOCRINOLOGISTS. OUR GOAL IS TO ENSURE EACH PATIENT IS UP TO DATE WITH ANNUAL LABS, EYE EXAM, KIDNEY FUNCTION AND BLOOD PRESSURE CONTROL. THE TEAM VERIFIES THE PATIENT'S LAB WORK IS WITHIN NORMAL RANGE TO PREVENT COMPLICATIONS OF DIABETES. MEDICATIONS ARE ADJUSTED AND FREQUENT FOLLOW UP APPOINTMENTS ARE SCHEDULED. EACH PATIENT'S UNIQUE COPING MECHANISMS ARE DISCUSSED AND IF BARRIERS TO CARE ARE IDENTIFIED, THE TEAM ENGAGES OUR CASE MANAGEMENT AND/OR SOCIAL WORK DEPARTMENTS TO SUPPORT PATIENTS WITH MEDICATIONS, NUTRITIONAL OR TRANSPORTATION NEEDS.

HEALTHCARE GAPS: VERISK SIGNATURE HEALTHCARE RECENTLY PURCHASED A LICENSE FOR THE VERISK HEALTH PRODUCT. THIS DATABASE PROVIDES DETAILED INFORMATION RELATING TO THE QUALITY AND COST OF SIGNATURE MEDICAL GROUP PATIENTS UNDER CONTRACTUAL RISK. THIS INFORMATION ADDS TO THE ABILITY OF SMG PROVIDERS TO IMPROVE QUALITY PROCESSES AND OUTCOMES FOR THEIR PATIENTS. FOR EXAMPLE, SMG PCPS, WITH THE ASSISTANCE OF VERISK HEALTH DATA, CAN NOW IDENTIFY DIABETICS WITH LESS THAN 80% COMPLIANCE TO FILLING CHOLESTEROL REDUCING DRUG PRESCRIPTIONS. THIS DATA IS CRITICAL IN PCP FOLLOW-UP TO THEIR PATIENTS.USING PROVIDER INTELLIGENCE FOR COMMUNITY-BASED POPULATION HEALTH, VERISK HEALTH SOFTWARE WAS SUCCESSFULLY INTEGRATED WITH SIGNATURE HEALTHCARE'S DATA WAREHOUSE, CARETRACKER. DATA FROM 75,500 PATIENTS IN SIGNATURE MEDICAL GROUP'S PRIMARY CARE PRACTICES FROM 2012 TO 2013 IN CLAIMS FOR FIVE HEALTH INSURANCE PLANS WERE UPLOADED. THE EXPERIENCE WITH VERISK HAS IMPROVED SIGNATURE HEALTHCARE'S ABILITY TO DOWNLOAD CLAIMS, INTEGRATE TABLES WITH THE EMR ALLSCRIPTS PROGRAM, AND INTERNALLY QUERY CARETRACKER. IN ADDITION TO GENERATING DATA ON UTILIZATION AND COST, THE DIAGNOSTIC COST GROUPS (DXCG) STATISTICAL ALGORITHM AND PREDICTIVE MODELING, WHICH ARE PART OF VERISK, PROVIDE STATISTICAL PREDICTIONS OF THE ""LIKELIHOOD OF HOSPITALIZATION"" AND FUTURE COSTS. THIS ABILITY TO STRATIFY POPULATIONS BY DISEASE BURDEN, UTILIZATION, AND COST THROUGH PREDICTIVE MODELING PROVIDES A DATA-DRIVEN SYSTEM FOR EFFECTIVE POPULATION MANAGEMENT.SMG UTILIZES MULTIPLE DATABASES AND TOOLS TO GUIDE THE PCPS IN FOCUSING ON QUALITY DEFECTS.

HEART FAILURE DISEASE MANAGEMENT PROGRAMTHE FOCUS OF THIS PROGRAM IS TO ENROLL HIGH RISK PATIENTS WITH A PRIMARY ADMISSION OF ACUTE DECOMPENSATED HEART FAILURE. ACHIEVEMENTS WHICH IMPROVE THE CARE OF THIS PATIENT POPULATION ARE THE USE OF TEACH BACK IN EDUCATION OF OUR PATIENTS, THE IMPLEMENTATION OF A HOSPITAL WIDE CASE MANAGEMENT RISK ASSESSMENT TOOL, AND FURTHER EXPANSION OF OUR MULTIDISCIPLINARY ROUNDS TO INCLUDE REPRESENTATION FROM THE PHARMACY. POLYPHARMACY ISSUES ARE COMMON IN THE CHALLENGES IDENTIFIED FOR CARE OF THE CHF PATIENT POPULATION.HOMEWARD BOUNDHOMEWARD BOUND IS AN INNOVATIVE PARTNERSHIP BETWEEN BROCKTON HOSPITAL AND BROCKTON HOSPITAL SCHOOL OF NURSING TO COORDINATE THE CARE FOR PATIENTS WHO HAVE BEEN HOSPITALIZED WITH CONGESTIVE HEART FAILURE (CHF). APPROXIMATELY 28% OF BROCKTON HOSPITAL PATIENTS WITH CHF ARE READMITTED TO THE HOSPITAL WITHIN 30 DAYS COMPARED TO THE NATIONAL AVERAGE OF 24.7%. HOMEWARD BOUND WAS SPECIFICALLY DESIGNED TO LOWER THE 30-DAY READMISSION RATE FOR THESE PATIENTS. ACCORDING TO THE CENTERS FOR MEDICARE AND MEDICAID SERVICES, 90% OF ALL READMISSIONS FOR HEART FAILURE ARE UNPLANNED OR PREVENTABLE.(STAMP,ET.AL.,2013) MOST READMISSIONS ARE DUE TO PATIENTS' POOR UNDERSTANDING OF THEIR DIAGNOSIS, NON-COMPLIANCE WITH THEIR MEDICATION REGIME, AND LACK OF MOTIVATION TO CHANGE THEIR DIET AND/OR EXERCISE. THE NURSING STUDENTS, HOSPITAL STAFF AND FACULTY WORK TOGETHER TO MONITOR PATIENT'S CONDITIONS ON A DAILY BASIS THROUGH HOME VISITS AND TELEMEDICINE. THE GOAL OF THESE VISITS IS TO REDUCE THE 30-DAY READMISSION RATES FOR CHF PATIENTS. IN THE FIRST YEAR, HOMEWARD BOUND WORKED WITH 22 PATIENTS, NONE OF WHOM WERE RE-HOSPITALIZED. HPIIN 2014 SIGNATURE HEALTHCARE INITIATED A PARTNERSHIP WITH HEALTHCARE PERFORMANCE IMPROVEMENT (HPI) TO CONDUCT A SAFETY ASSESSMENT AND DEVELOP AN INTERVENTION PLAN DESIGNED TO REDUCE SERIOUS ADVERSE EVENTS IN THE HOSPITAL BY 50-80% IN TWO YEARS. THE INITIAL ASSESSMENT IDENTIFIED OPPORTUNITIES IN SIGNATURE HEALTHCARE'S CURRENT SAFETY CULTURE. WE ENGAGED THE SERVICES OF HPI TO LEAD SIGNATURE HEALTHCARE IN A JOURNEY TOWARDS ZERO-HARM. HPI IS CURRENTLY EDUCATING MANAGEMENT STAFF AND PHYSICIAN LEADERSHIP ON IMPLEMENTING A CULTURE OF SAFETY, LEADING TO PRACTICE, PROCESS AND BEHAVIORAL CHANGES AIMED AT REDUCING EVENTS WHICH CAUSE HARM TO PATIENTS. PERAHEALTHPERATREND SOFTWARE FROM PERAHEALTH WAS INTEGRATED INTO THE MEDITECH ELECTRONIC MEDICAL RECORD (EMR) FOR USE ON MEDICAL/SURGICAL WARD A5 IN SIGNATURE HEALTHCARE BROCKTON HOSPITAL. PERATREND SOFTWARE IS AN EMR-COMPLIMENT THAT UTILIZES THE ROTHMAN INDEX (RI), A GENERAL MEASURE OF INDIVIDUAL PATIENT CONDITION. IN IMPLEMENTING THIS TOOL, NURSING DOCUMENTATION HAD TO BE RESTRUCTURED WHICH LED TO IMPROVED CLINICAL DOCUMENTATION. CLINICAL PROVIDERS, NURSING STAFF AND HOSPITALISTS ROUTINELY REVIEW THE RI ON EACH PATIENT IN ORDER TO PROMPT REASSESSMENTS, FACILITATE COMMUNICATION BETWEEN CLINICIANS, AND MAKE DECISIONS ABOUT CARE TRANSITIONS. STAFF EXPERIENCE WITH PERATREND ON WARD A5 HAS BEEN POSITIVE WITH 88% OF STAFF REPORTING THAT THE RI IS A VALUABLE TOOL AND WOULD RECOMMEND EXTENDING THE TOOL HOSPITAL-WIDE. INDEED, SIGNATURE HEALTHCARE PLANS TO EXPAND THE USE OF THE PERATREND TOOL AND THE IMPROVED NURSING DOCUMENTATION ACROSS THE HOSPITAL IN 2015.PRE-DIABETES PILOTAT THE BEGINNING OF FY 14, THE SIGNATURE HEALTHCARE BRIDGEWATER OFFICE CREATED A PROGRAM AIMED AT REDUCING THE PERCENTAGE OF PATIENTS WITH RISK FACTORS FOR PRE-DIABETES. THIS PROGRAM HAD MANY COMPONENTS, THE FIRST OF WHICH WAS HOW TO IDENTIFY THE TARGET POPULATION. A PRE-VISIT PREPARATION WORKSHEET FOR MEDICAL ASSISTANTS TO COMPLETE PRIOR TO PATIENT APPOINTMENTS WAS DEVELOPED. THEY RECORDED THE PATIENT'S LAST HEMOGLOBIN A1C RESULT AND SCREENING NEED BASED ON AGE (45 OR OLDER) OR BMI (25 OR GREATER). THE PATIENTS WERE THEN FLAGGED WHEN THEY WERE IN NEED OF SCREENING AT POINT OF SERVICE. THE OFFICE DEVELOPED STANDARD REPORTS FOR USE WITHIN THE PRACTICE TO MONITOR THE 'AT RISK' POPULATION'S SCREENING DEFECT RATE OVER TIME. A FOUR COMPONENT SCREENING PROCESS WAS DEVELOPED. FIRST, THE POINT OF CARE HBA1C TESTING WAS IMPLEMENTED ALLOWING RESULTS TO BE DETERMINED WITHIN 3 MINUTES AFTER SPECIMEN COLLECTION. SECOND, THE CLINICAL STAFF PERFORMED TESTING BASED ON STANDING ORDERS WITH RESULTS AVAILABLE BEFORE THE PROVIDERS ENTERED THE EXAM ROOM. THIS STANDARD PROCESS ALLOWED THE PRIMARY CARE PHYSICIAN TO PROVIDE REAL TIME INTERVENTION AT THE TIME OF THE APPOINTMENT. THIRD, THE OFFICE STAFF TOOK STEPS TO ASSIST THE PATIENT IN MANAGING LIFESTYLE CHANGES. PATIENT EDUCATION MATERIALS WERE DEVELOPED WITH INFORMATION ABOUT HEALTHY EATING AND PHYSICAL ACTIVITY. SIGNATURE HEALTHCARE PARTNERED WITH THE OLD COLONY YMCA DIABETES PREVENTION PROGRAM TO PROVIDE LIFESTYLE COACHING AFTER HOURS. FOURTH, RESOURCES WERE LEVERAGED WITHIN THE PRACTICE, SUCH AS NUTRITION COUNSELING AND ENDOCRINOLOGY CONSULTS TO MEET A PATIENT'S NEEDS. IN THE FIRST YEAR OF THIS PROJECT, 2,755 PATIENTS OF THE 6,100 PATIENT PRIMARY CARE PRACTICE WERE SCREENED, REDUCING THE SCREENING DEFECT RATE FROM 85% TO 29%. OF THIS, 988 PATIENTS (36%) WERE DIAGNOSED WITH PRE-DIABETES AND 49 PATIENTS DIAGNOSED WITH TYPE 2 DIABETES. OF THE PATIENTS DIAGNOSED WITH PRE-DIABETES, MORE THAN 64% LOST WEIGHT OVER THE COURSE OF THE YEAR, WITH 31% LOSING AT LEAST 5% OF THEIR BODY WEIGHT. AS ANTICIPATED, THE PRE-DIABETIC PATIENT'S WEIGHT LOSS GENERATED A CORRESPONDING IMPROVEMENT IN HEMOGLOBIN A1C LEVELS WITH 72% OF PRE-DIABETIC PATIENTS HBA1C DECREASING OVER BASELINE, AND 25% OF PRE-DIABETIC PATIENTS ACHIEVING NORMAL HBA1C VALUES. SUBSTANCE ABUSE INITIATIVESIGNATURE HEALTHCARE EMERGENCY DEPARTMENT PHYSICIANS WORK WITH LOCAL POLICE AND FIRE DEPARTMENTS - PROVIDING TRAINING AND MEDICAL GUIDANCE. POLICE DEPARTMENTS FROM NORFOLK, PLYMOUTH AND BRISTOL COUNTIES WERE TRAINED ON PROPER USE OF NASAL NARCAN. THE ED PHYSICIANS ARE ALSO WORKING ON PROJECTS WITH THE NORFOLK AND PLYMOUTH COUNTY DISTRICT ATTORNEY'S OFFICES TO PROVIDE LECTURES TO STUDENTS, PARENTS, TEACHERS AND OTHER HEALTHCARE PROFESSIONALS ON CONCUSSIONS, SPORTS INJURIES AND SUBSTANCE ABUSE. A SECOND INITIATIVE WITHIN THE SIGNATURE HEALTHCARE EMERGENCY DEPARTMENT HAS BEEN CREATED TO ADDRESS THE NEEDS OF OVERDOSE PATIENTS. AT TIME OF DISCHARGE, THESE PATIENTS WILL RECEIVE NASAL NARCAN, A LIST OF DETOXIFICATION FACILITIES AND COUNSELING. THE ED PHYSICIANS ARE ALSO LIMITING THE NUMBER OF NARCOTICS THEY ARE PRESCRIBING TO PATIENTS. THEY WILL NOT FILL LOST PRESCRIPTIONS AND THEY ARE ADVANCING USE OF THE STATE'S ""PRESCRIPTION MONITORING PROGRAM.""

201522229349300222,042790311,"Part I, Line 7:","Line 7a (Charity Care) - community benefit expense was calculated by applying the ratio of patient care cost to charges, calculated on Worksheet 2, against total charity care gross patient charges from the audited financial statements.Line 7b (Unreimbursed Medicaid) - community benefit expense was derived using the organization's cost accounting system, which takes into account all hospital inpatients, outpatients and emergency room patients for whom services were provided and covered under Medicaid and Medicaid managed care plans.Line 7c (Other Means-Tested Programs) - community benefit expense was derived using the organization's cost accounting system, which takes into account all hospital inpatients, outpatients and emergency room patients for whom services were provided and covered under other means-tested government programs.Line 7f (Health Professional Education) - community benefit expense was derived using the organization's cost accounting system.Line 7g (Subsidized Programs) - community benefit expense was derived using the organization's cost accounting system. The expense relates to specific outpatient programs.Line 7h (Research) - community benefit expense was derived using the organization's cost accounting system. In addition to the research costs reported on line 7h, there was $1,176,633 of expenses related to Industry-sponsored grants that we believe should be treated as community benefit expense because they were incurred to promote the health and well-being of the local population and are a key component of our commitment to the community."

201522229349300222,042790311,"Part I, Ln 7 Col(f):","In fiscal year 2013, the organization adopted the provisions of Accounting Standards Update 2011-07, Health Care Entities (Topic 954), Presentation and disclosure of Patient Service Revenue, Provision for Bad Debts, and the Allowance for Doubtful Accounts for Certain Health Care Entities on October 1, 2012. The update changed how the provision for bad debts is reported on the audited financial statements. In prior years it was included with total operating expenses, and subtracted from total expenses reported in Part IX, Line 25, column (A) for the purpose of calculating the percentages in Part I, Line 7, column (f). Beginning in 2013, the provision for bad debts was reported as a deduction to net patient service revenue. The 2014 provision for bad debts totalled $14,768,939 and is not included in total expenses reported in Part IX, LIne 25, column (A) for the purpose of calculating the percentages in Part 1, LIne 7, column (f)."
201522229349300222,042790311,"Part II, Community Building Activities:","Specific to Part II Baystate Medical Center provided $100,000 to the North End Housing Initiative (NEHI) with the goal of increasing the quantity, quality and healthfulness of affordable single and duplex family housing for low income families with young children in the North End neighborhoods of Springfield, Massachusetts. A portion of the funding is also used to leverage additional funding to write grants for projects what will assist the NEHI to achieve its mission. In addition to providing additional housing in the North End, NEHI also provides homebuyer and financial literacy courses to North End households and maximizes economic opportunities for minority-owned businesses within NEHI construction projects. The NEHI improves the public health of the community by providing greater access to healthy homes, reducing the prevalence of asthma in young children, increasing housing stability and creating safer and more beautiful neighborhoods through affordable homeownership. The following description is not quantified specifically in Part II of Schedule H. Baystate Medical Center provided $100,000 as a Voluntary Contribution to the City of Springfield, specifically to fund public health initiatives under the Department of Health and Human Services. Baystate Medical Center provided $111,337.92 as a Payment in Lieu of Taxes (PILOT) to the City of Springfield for our outpatient facility at 3300 Main Street, Springfield. Baystate Medical Center provided $35,753.62 as a Payment in Lieu of Taxes (PILOT) to the City of Chicopee for our employee parking lot located at Center Street, Chicopee. Baystate Medical Center is a dues paying member of the Economic Development Council of Western Massachusetts (EDC) and the Affiliated Chambers of Commerce of Greater Springfield (ACCGS). BMC participates in the EDC and ACCGS as we are the largest local employer in our region. The Chamber and its membership coordinate activities toward a common purpose of sustainability and economic growth for the region. The amount paid for FY 2014 was $83,949.Baystate Medical Center is committed to creating healthier communities and understands that many state and federally mandated community benefit programs and services are not sufficient to address ethnic, racial and economic health disparities. BMC extends the traditional definition of ""health"" to include economic opportunity, affordable housing, quality education, safe neighborhoods, food security, arts/culture, and racism and homophobia free communities - all elements that are needed for individuals, families and communities to thrive. Baystate Medical Center provides many valuable services, resources, programs and financial support - beyond the walls of the hospital and into the communities and homes of the people we serve; including sponsorships for more than 200 non-profit community organizations and events and involvement of Baystate leadership with over 70 community boards that align with our mission."
201522229349300222,042790311,"Part III, Line 4:","The cost of bad debts reported in Part III, line 2 was calculated by applying a ratio of cost to charges (based on the organization's cost accounting system including all hospital inpatients and outpatients) against total patient bad debt net of recoveries as reported in the audited financial statements. The portion of bad debt that reasonably could be attributable to patients who may qualify for financial assistance under the hospital's charity care program (reported in Part III line 3) was calculated by applying the percentage of bad debts by zip code (for which the average household income for each zip code is less than 200% of the federal poverty level) to the total cost of bad debt reported in Part III line 2. Since this portion of bad debt is attributable to patients residing in an area where the average income is less than 200% of the Federal poverty level, it is highly likely these patients would have qualified for the organization's charity care program had they applied. For this reason, we believe the amount, totalling $2,061,315, should be treated as community benefit expense in Part I. As noted above, the organization adopted Accounting Standards Update 2011-07 effective October 1, 2012, which changed the way entities report and disclose certain financial information including the provision for bad debts. See footnote #2 (Significant Accounting Policies) on page 12 of the audited financial statements under the caption ""Allowance for Uncollectible Accounts"" for a description of the organization's reporting of its provision for bad debts.If a patient is determined eligible for financial assistance, the appropriate adjustment is made to the patient account based on their income level. Once the necessary approvals are obtained, it then flows to the general ledger. Patients applying for a prompt payment discount will have this allowance entered after agreed upon payment is received."
201522229349300222,042790311,"Part III, Line 8:","Line 6 - included all Medicare allowable costs as calculated in Worksheets D-1 Part II (inpatient and inpatient psych), D Part V (outpatient) and E Part A (organ acquisition) of the hospital's 2014 Medicare cost report, net of Medicare costs reported in Part 1, line 7g, and based on Medicare costing principles. There is no shortfall reported on line 7."
201522229349300222,042790311,"Part III, Line 9b:","For patients who are known to qualify for Charity Care or Financial Assistance: The patient may have requested assistance up front at time of service with a Financial Counselor or the Patient could have asked for assistance after receiving their bill by contacting our Patient Billing Services Representatives. The Financial Counselor will assist the patient in applying for the appropriate type of assistance based on their income and circumstances. Once approved for a State Medicaid or other program, all billing and collection activity will stop (except for required co-payments or deductibles).For all other patients, our statements contain information regarding how to apply for financial assistance. Notices concerning availability for assistance are also posted at patient care sites."
201522229349300222,042790311,"Part VI, Line 2:","In partnership with the Coalition of Western MA Hospitals, Baystate Medical Center conducted its most recent community health needs assessment (CHNA) in 2013 of the geographic areas served by the hospital pursuant to the requirements of the MA Attorney General's Community Benefit Guidelines and Section 501(r) of the Internal Revenue Code. The CHNA findings were made available on the hospital's website in September 2013. Per the Internal Revenue Service (IRS) and the Massachusetts Office of the Attorney General, each non-profit hospital must conduct a formal community health needs assessment (CHNA) every three-years in partnership with community organizations and individuals across the hospital's service area. The aim is to identify community assets as well as the critical gaps/needs in public health resources and the weak connections between medical care and community care. This ""gaps analysis"" assists Baystate Health's Board of Trustees and senior managers in developing community benefit policy, which targets our charitable resources in focused areas. These areas frame existing community benefit programs, assist in transforming community service activities to comply with the IRS and MA Attorney General's criteria, and set priorities in the design of new programs. The CHNA is the basis for developing accountable community benefit programs. In an ideal situation, an effective and large scale community benefit program will demonstrate measurable community impacts on the health status and quality of life for residents - effectively closing gaps when current data is compared to initial CHNA baseline indicators. At a more practical program level, the CHNA guides a ""theory of change"" linking health needs to community benefit efforts to desired program and community outcomes. BMC's CHNA began by identifying the communities served by the hospital. Findings are based on various quantitative analyses regarding health-related needs in those areas, a review of health assessments conducted by other organizations in recent years, information obtained from interviews, and findings from a community survey. Preliminary assessment findings were discussed with community stakeholders during a series of ""listening sessions"" and feedback from participants helped validate findings. Finally, Verite applied a ranking methodology to help prioritize the community health needs identified by the assessment. Including multiple data sources and stakeholder views is important when assessing the level of consensus that exists regarding priority community health needs. If alternative data sources including interviews support similar conclusions, then confidence is increased regarding the most problematic health needs in a community. Further information about the analytic methods and prioritization process and criteria can be found in the hospitals 2013 CHNA report. The list that follows describes the health needs identified throughout the assessment as priorities in the community served by Baystate Medical Center. These needs are presented in alphabetical order, by category. The prioritized list identifies the 15 most problematic community health needs found by this assessment. Needs were determined by synthesizing findings from multiple data sources.Access to Care: Lack of Affordable and Accessible Medical CareNeed for Care Coordination and Culturally Sensitive Care Dental Health:Lack of Access to Dental Care Health Behaviors:High Rates of Alcohol, Tobacco, and Drug Use High Rates of Unsafe Sex, Teen Pregnancy, and Chlamydia Maternal and Child Health:Prevalent Infant Health Risk Factors (e.g., smoking during pregnancy, lack of prenatal care) Pediatric DisabilityMental Health:Lack of Access to Mental Health Services and Poor Mental Health Status Use Morbidity and Mortality:High Rates of Diet and Exercise-Related Diseases and Mortality High Rates of Asthma Racial and Ethnic Disparities in Disease Morbidity and Mortality Physical Environment:Poor Community Safety (e.g., homicide and other violent crimes) Poor Built Environment and Environmental Quality (e.g., air quality, presence of food deserts) Social and Economic Factors:Basic Needs Insecurity: Financial Hardship, Housing, and Food Access Low Educational Achievement Baystate Health's Board of Trustees is actively involved in overseeing community benefit programs and expenditures. In July 2010, the Baystate Health Board of Trustees assigned oversight of community benefits to the Board's Governance Committee. Through its regular board meetings, internal hospital meetings and leadership activities, Baystate Health is actively involved in shaping community benefits provided by the system. For FY 2014 the systems Vice President for Government and Community Relations and Public Affairs, under the direction of the Sr. Vice President for Strategy & External Relations, supervised the Director of Community Health Planning and Manager of Community Relations and Community Benefit. In addition, the Director and Manager work collaboratively with the Regional Director of Public Affairs & Communications for Baystate Health Northern Region and the Public Relations & Community Relations Specialist at Baystate Mary Lane Hospital to oversee the hospitals' community benefit planning, community health needs assessments, annual program data collection, and state and federal reporting of community benefit. The Baystate Health Board Governance Committee meets two times per year and is charged with advocating for community benefits at the Board level and throughout the health system; integrating three (3) hospital-specific community benefit plans into the health system's strategic plan; periodic review of community health needs assessment data; approval of a community benefit mission statement and health priorities; review impact of community benefit programs in promoting health of the community; and ensure community benefits programs are in compliance with guidelines established by the MA Attorney General and IRS. Bi-annually, Baystate Health's Vice President for Government and Community Relations and Public Affairs and the Director of Community Health Planning or Community Benefit Manager present a system-wide community benefit update to the full Board of Trustees. Baystate Medical Center is in the planning phase of kicking-off a formal Community Benefit Advisory Council (CBAC). A CBAC brings a community lens and filter for interpreting findings of a community health needs assessment and priority setting process. The CBAC provides a community perspective on how to increase wellness and resilience opportunities for optimal health for an entire population; guidance in matching Baystate Medical Center resources to community resources, thus making the most of what is possible with the goal to improve health status and quality of life; and policy advocacy to assure and restore health equity by targeting resources for residents. Participants on a CBAC for Baystate Medical Center will represent employees, community benefit program managers and Hampden county constituencies and communities that the hospital serves. CBAC members will be responsible for reviewing community needs assessment data and use this analysis as a foundation for providing the hospital with input on its community benefit planning process."
201522229349300222,042790311,"Part VI, Line 3:","Baystate Medical Center (BMC) is committed to ensuring that patients in its community have access to quality health care services with fairness and respect without regard to the patients' ability to pay. BMC recognizes that the cost of necessary health care services can impose a significant financial burden on patients who are uninsured or underinsured and acts affirmatively to lessen that burden by offering patients in need the opportunity to apply for free or reduced cost services. BMC not only offers free and reduced cost care to the financially needy as required by law, but has also voluntarily established discount and financial assistance programs that provide additional free and reduced cost care to more patients residing within the communities served by BMC.Baystate Medical Center recognizes that the billing and collection process can be bewildering and burdensome for patients and has implemented procedures to make the process understandable for patients; to inform patients about discount and financial assistance options; and to ensure that patients are not subject to aggressive collection activities. Consistent with its patient commitment BMC is required to maintain a credit and collection policy that reflects its patient billing and collection procedures and complies with applicable state and federal laws and regulations.Baystate Medical Center has Financial Counselors available to help patients apply for financial assistance programs that may cover unpaid hospital bills, including a variety of federal and state programs as well as financial assistance through Baystate Medical Center. BMC Financial Counselors have all been trained and certified by the state as Certified Account Counselors to assist patients in applying for available state and federal programs. BMC is committed to ensuring that patients or prospective patients in the community are aware of financial assistance programs. For uninsured or underinsured patients, BMC will assist in applying for available financial assistance programs. BMC notifies patients of the availability of assistance in both the initial bill sent to patients as well as in general notices posted throughout the hospital.When applicable, BMC also assists patients in applying for coverage of services as a Medical Hardship based on the patient's documented income and allowable medical expenses. BMC provides, upon request, specific information about the eligibility process to be a Low Income Patient under either the Massachusetts Health Safety Net Program or additional assistance for patients who are low income through BMC's own internal financial assistance program. BMC also notifies patients about available payment plans based on their family size and income. Signs about the availability of financial assistance programs at Baystate Medical Center are translated into Spanish, because Spanish is primarily spoken by 10% or more of the residents in the hospital's service area. Signs are large enough to be clearly visible. Baystate Medical Center's sign is 8-1/2 x 11 inches and the header print font is 24 pts. Notice of availability of Financial Assistance Programs are posted in the following locations; inpatient, clinic, emergency department admissions and/or registration areas, central admission/registration area, patient financial counselor areas and business office areas that are open to patients.Our Credit and Collection Policy is posted on the baystatehealth.org website. The goal of posting the Credit and Collection Policy is to ensure that patients or prospective patients in our community are aware of our financial assistance programs. Baystate Medical Center's Credit and Collection Policy was developed in partnership with Health Care For All, a Massachusetts non-profit organization dedicated to making adequate and affordable health care accessible to everyone, regardless of income, social or economic status."
201522229349300222,042790311,"Part VI, Line 4:","Baystate Medical Center, located in Springfield, Massachusetts, is an academic, research, and teaching hospital that serves as the western campus of Tufts University School of Medicine. The Hospital is a 716-bed facility with 57 bassinets and is the only Level 1 trauma center in western Massachusetts, treating the most critical and urgent cases in the region. The hospital is also home to the second-busiest emergency department in Massachusetts. The primary community served by the hospital is defined based on the geographic origins of the hospital's discharges. The hospital's primary community is comprised of 51 ZIP codes in 21 cities and towns: Agawam, Blandford, Brimfield, Chester, Chicopee, East Longmeadow, Granville, Hampden, Holland, Holyoke, Longmeadow, Ludlow, Monson, Palmer, Russell, Southwick, Springfield, Wales, West Springfield, Westfield, and Wilbraham. The 51 ZIP codes collectively and essentially are equivalent to Hampden County. Hampden County has a total population of 464,416.In 2012, the community served by the hospital was comprised of 76% White residents, 9.1% African American residents, 21.8 % Latino residents and 2.1% Asian residents. The Latino community of Hampden County is concentrated in the cities of Holyoke and Springfield, while the African-American community is concentrated in Springfield. In all, 81% of all Latino residents of Hampden County live in either Springfield or Holyoke. Non-White populations are expected to grow faster than White populations in the community. The Asian, American Indian, Black, and Other are expected to have the fastest growth. The growing diversity of the community is important to recognize, given the presence of health disparities. Located in Hampden County along the Connecticut River, Springfield is 27 miles north of Hartford CT, while Boston and New York City are 80 and 134 miles away, respectively. The Springfield Metropolitan Statistical Area (MSA) is the fourth-largest metropolitan area in New England and the county's contiguous urban nuclei is comprised of the central city of Springfield, with a population of 152,998, and the cities of Chicopee (55,453), and Holyoke (40,073). Much of BMC's service area has Medically Underserved Area or Population (MUA/P) designation from the Health Resources and Services Administration (HRSA) while the major towns have Health Professional Shortage Area (HPSA) designation. Within Hampden County, Springfield and the surrounding community, especially Holyoke, have many community risk factors that contribute to poor health, including substance abuse, child abuse and neglect, poverty and unemployment, crime and domestic violence, decreased informal social support networks, and overburdened public schools.For FY 2014 BMC's ethnic mix of inpatient & outpatient patients included 48.6% White; 35.8% Hispanic; 11.7% Black; 1.4% Asian, 0.1% Native American, 2.5% Other. BMC's payer mix of patients included 41.45% Medicare; 29.19% Medicaid; 25.64% Managed Care; 1.35% Non-Managed Care; 2.38% Other. In FY 2014 BMC had 39,317 inpatient discharges and 80,059 emergency service visits. Payer mix for ED visits included 22.14% Medicaid; 2.01% Free Care; 23.14% Healthnet; 1.35% Commonwealth Care; 51.36% Other.BMC is committed to reducing health disparities in Springfield. Our commitment is demonstrated by our investment of significant resources in our three community health centers and pediatric clinic located in Springfield's low-income neighborhoods that have both HPSA and MUA/MUP designation. BMC health centers are primary care first-contact sites for thousands of underserved, low-income people. These community training sites for our Residency Program provide continuity of care for over 130,000 patients annually, most of who reside in an MUA/MUP. BMC provides primary care to a medically-underserved population in Springfield comprised of primarily Latinos and African-Americans. Springfield's black and Latino families fare poorly in comparison to their peers across the state on a myriad of sensitive indicators (e.g., infant deaths per 1,000 live births, low birth weight, births to adolescent mothers, adequacy of prenatal care). Springfield has one of the highest concentrations of MassHealth eligible populations. This low income population has a special health risk and a specific location in the Mason Square and North End neighborhoods with child poverty rates well above 30% and as high as 70% in some small areas."

THE INFORMATION GATHERED AS PART OF THIS EFFORT ALLOWED NEBH TO ENGAGE THE COMMUNITY AND GAIN A BETTER UNDERSTANDING OF THE HEALTH STATUS, HEALTH CARE NEEDS, SERVICE GAPS, AND BARRIERS TO CARE OF THOSE LIVING IN MISSION HILL AND ROXBURY, NEBH'S PRIMARY SERVICE FOR ITS COMMUNITY BENEFIT EFFORTS. THE IMPLEMENTATION PLAN STARTED IN SEPTEMBER 2013. NEBH WILL CONDUCT ANOTHER CHNA IN 2016.SEVERAL COMMUNITY PROGRAMS AND EVENTS IN WHICH NEBH PLAYS A LEADERSHIP ROLE INCLUDE:MUSCULOSKELETAL HEALTH ARTHRITIS AND LUPUS SUPPORT GROUPTHE GOAL OF THIS INITIATIVE IS TO ADDRESS ACCESS, EDUCATION, TREATMENT, AND SUPPORT NEEDS OF PEOPLE WITH ARTHRITIS AND LUPUS, ESPECIALLY UNDER-SERVED POPULATIONS IN THE CITY OF BOSTON, TARGETING WOMEN OF COLOR. THE LONG-TERM GOAL IS TO MEET THE IDENTIFIED NEEDS OF MORE SUPPORT AND EDUCATION. ARTHRITIS FOUNDATIONTHE ARTHRITIS FOUNDATION'S WALK TO CURE ARTHRITIS ENCOURAGES PEOPLE TO MOVE TO PREVENT OR TREAT ARTHRITIS. THERE ARE 27 MILLION PEOPLE WITH OSTEOARTHRITIS, THE MOST COMMON FORM OF ARTHRITIS, 1.3 MILLION PEOPLE WITH RHEUMATOID ARTHRITIS, AN AUTOIMMUNE DISEASE THAT CAN LEAD TO CHRONIC PAIN, LOSS OF FUNCTION AND DEFORMITY AND 300,000 CHILDREN (OR ONE IN 250) WITH JUVENILE ARTHRITIS, WHICH AFFECTS CHILDREN BETWEEN THE AGES OF INFANCY AND 18. BY 2030, AN ESTIMATED 67 MILLION AMERICANS AGES 18 YEARS OR OLDER ARE PROJECTED TO HAVE DOCTOR-DIAGNOSED ARTHRITIS. NEW ENGLAND BAPTIST HOSPITAL (NEBH) HAS PARTNERED WITH THE ARTHRITIS FOUNDATION'S, GREATER BOSTON CHAPTER ON THEIR WALK TO CURE ARTHRITIS, IN THE FIGHT AGAINST ARTHRITIS BY RAISING AWARENESS AND REDUCING THE IMPACT OF ARTHRITIS, WHICH IS THE NATION'S LEADING CAUSE OF DISABILITY. OSTEOPOROSISOSTEOPOROSIS IS A MAJOR PUBLIC HEALTH THREAT FOR AN ESTIMATED 54 MILLION AMERICANS AGE 50 AND OLDER. TWENTY PERCENT OF NON-HISPANIC CAUCASIAN AND ASIAN WOMEN AGED 50 AND OLDER ARE ESTIMATED TO HAVE OSTEOPOROSIS, AND 52 PERCENT ARE ESTIMATED TO HAVE LOW BONE MASS. THE MASSACHUSETTS DEPARTMENT OF PUBLIC HEALTH (DPH) HAS IDENTIFIED OSTEOPOROSIS AS A PUBLIC HEALTH ISSUE AND ESTABLISHED THE OSTEOPOROSIS AWARENESS PROGRAM. PHYSICAL ACTIVITY CAN IMPROVE THE OVERALL HEALTH AND WELL-BEING OF OLDER ADULTS. EVEN MODEST LEVELS OF ACTIVITY, DONE EACH DAY FOR A TOTAL OF 30 MINUTES, CAN PREVENT OR CONTROL OSTEOPOROSIS AND WEIGHT GAIN. NEBH SUPPORTS TWO WALKING GROUPS AT ROXBURY TENANTS OF HARVARD: A WALKING/EXERCISE PROGRAM HELD IN MISSION HILL, SERVING BETWEEN 20-40 WOMEN AND MEN BETWEEN THE AGES OF 40 AND 90 FROM ALL ETHNIC BACKGROUNDS AT EACH SESSION. THE HOSPITAL ALSO OFFERS EDUCATIONAL PROGRAMS SUCH AS STRETCHING, EATING HEALTHY, ETC. TO THIS GROUP.GREATER BOSTON SENIOR GAMESSINCE 2001, NEBH HAS BEEN A SPONSOR OF THE GREATER BOSTON SENIOR GAMES.

IN FY 2014 TOTAL INPATIENT HOSPITAL ADMISSIONS WERE 7,986, OF WHICH 97% WERE FOR SURGICAL PROCEDURES - PRIMARILY HIP, KNEE, AND OTHER MUSCULOSKELETAL PROCEDURES; AND OUTPATIENT ACTIVITY WERE PREDOMINANTLY APPOINTMENT SURGERIES AND RELATED ANCILLARY VISITS TO RADIOLOGY, LAB, AND PHYSICAL THERAPY CLINICS. THE ACU, AS MENTIONED ABOVE, IS DESIGNED TO MEET THE URGENT CARE NEEDS NOT MET BY OUR APPOINTMENT BASED STRUCTURE. BEYOND URGENT CARE AND APPOINTMENT SURGERIES, THOUGH, THE HOSPITAL IDENTIFIED A NEED WITHIN ITS IMMEDIATE COMMUNITY FOR CONTINUING CARE. IN FY 2009, THE HOSPITAL HIRED A PRIMARY CARE PHYSICIAN WITH OFFICES ON MISSION HILL, DR. BILL TSIKITAS, TO PROVIDE THOSE IN THE MISSION HILL COMMUNITY WITH A FIRST CONTACT FOR UNDIAGNOSED HEALTH CONCERNS OR PREVENTIVE CARE NEEDS. SIMILARLY TO THE ACU, PATIENTS WITH CONDITIONS BEST SERVED BY OTHER HEALTH CARE ORGANIZATIONS ARE TRANSFERRED. HIS PRACTICE IS NOT DESIGNED OR MAINTAINED TO FIND AND REFER ORTHOPEDIC CASES. IN FY 2014, DR. TSIKITAS' PRACTICE REQUIRED A SUBSIDY $231K AND THE HOSPITAL EXPECTS A SIMILAR FINANCIAL LOSS IN FUTURE YEARS. BOSTON'S FOREIGN-BORN POPULATION HAS INCREASED BY ALMOST 50% OVER THE PAST TWENTY YEARS AND NOW MAKES UP AN ESTIMATED 28% OF THE POPULATION, WELL ABOVE THE STATE AND NATIONAL AVERAGES MAKING BOSTON ONE OF THE MOST DIVERSE CITIES IN THE UNITED STATES. THE ORIGIN OF THESE RECENT IMMIGRANTS IS INCREDIBLY DIVERSE: NO SINGLE COUNTRY OF ORIGIN REPRESENTS MORE THAN 10% OF THIS FOREIGN-BORN POPULATION AND IT IS ESTIMATED THAT THERE ARE OVER 140 DIFFERENT LANGUAGES SPOKEN IN BOSTON HOMES. SETTLEMENT OF RECENT IMMIGRANTS IS SIMILARLY DIVERSE, AS EVERY BOSTON NEIGHBORHOOD HAS SEEN ITS FOREIGN-BORN POPULATION GROW AT HIGHER RATES THAN THE GENERAL POPULATION. HYDE PARK, A NEIGHBORHOOD AT THE SOUTHERN EDGE OF BOSTON (APPROXIMATELY A FIFTEEN MINUTE DRIVE FROM NEBH) HAS EXPERIENCED SIMILAR GROWTH IN DIVERSITY. NEBH HAS SINCE FY 2005 SUBSIDIZED THE PRACTICE OF DR. GREGORY TALALAYEVSKY, A RUSSIAN-SPEAKING PRIMARY CARE PHYSICIAN, TO THE MEET THE UNIQUE NEEDS OF THAT COMMUNITY. DR. TALALAYEVSKY SMALL PRACTICE HAS A STEADY PATIENT BASE OF THE ELDERLY AND RUSSIAN-SPEAKING POPULATION IN HYDE PARK.

NEBH WORKS WITH ALL SEGMENTS OF THE POPULATION BUT IN RECOGNITION OF ITS STRONG TIES TO ITS SURROUNDING COMMUNITY AND ITS SPECIFIC CLINICAL EXPERTISE, NEBH FOCUSES ITS COMMUNITY BENEFIT EFFORTS ON IMPROVING THE HEALTH AND WELL-BEING OF THE LOW INCOME, UNDERSERVED POPULATIONS LIVING IN MISSION HILL AND ROXBURY AND ON MUSCULOSKELETAL HEALTH. NEBH CURRENTLY OPERATES NUMEROUS EDUCATIONAL, OUTREACH, AND COMMUNITY-STRENGTHENING INITIATIVES, COLLABORATES WITH MANY OF THE COMMUNITY'S LEADING SERVICE ORGANIZATIONS. THE HOSPITAL CONTRIBUTES OVER $2.5 MILLION ANNUALLY TO SUPPORT ITS COMMUNITY BENEFIT COMMITMENTS AND THE MASSACHUSETTS UNCOMPENSATED CARE POOL. NEBH IS EAGER TO EXPLORE WAYS THAT IT CAN FURTHER ENGAGE AND ENRICH ITS CONNECTIONS TO THE COMMUNITY.THIS REPORT AND ASSOCIATED COMMUNITY HEALTH IMPROVEMENT PLAN IS THE CULMINATION OF FOUR MONTHS OF WORK. THIS PROJECT WAS BORNE LARGELY OUT OF NEBH'S DESIRE TO BETTER UNDERSTAND AND ADDRESS THE HEALTH-RELATED NEEDS OF THOSE LIVING IN ITS SURROUNDING COMMUNITY. HOWEVER, THE PROJECT ALSO FULFILLS LONG-STANDING REQUIREMENTS OF THE MASSACHUSETTS ATTORNEY GENERAL'S OFFICE AND A NEW FEDERAL INTERNAL REVENUE SERVICE (IRS) REQUIREMENTS, WHICH MANDATE THAT ALL NONPROFIT HOSPITALS CONDUCT A PERIODIC COMMUNITY HEALTH NEEDS ASSESSMENT (CHNA) AND STRATEGIC PLANNING PROCESS. THE COMMONWEALTH REQUIRES NONPROFIT HOSPITALS AND MANAGED CARE ORGANIZATIONS TO UPDATE THEIR CHNAS EVERY YEAR AND THE IRS REQUIRES THAT A CHNA BE CONDUCTED EVERY THREE YEARS. MORE SPECIFICALLY, THE COMMONWEALTH AND IRS REGULATIONS REQUIRE THAT NEBH ASSESS COMMUNITY HEALTH NEED, ENGAGE THE COMMUNITY, IDENTIFY PRIORITY HEALTH ISSUES, AND CREATE A COMMUNITY HEALTH STRATEGY THAT DESCRIBES HOW THE HOSPITAL, IN COLLABORATION WITH THE COMMUNITY AND LOCAL HEALTH DEPARTMENT, WILL ADDRESS THE NEEDS AND THE PRIORITIES IDENTIFIED BY THE ASSESSMENT.IN LIGHT OF THESE REQUIREMENTS, NEBH HIRED JOHN SNOW, INC. (JSI), A NATIONALLY RECOGNIZED PUBLIC HEALTH CONSULTING FIRM, TO CONDUCT A COMPREHENSIVE COMMUNITY HEALTH NEEDS ASSESSMENT FOCUSING ON MISSION HILL AND ROXBURY, ITS PRIMARY SERVICE AREA WITH RESPECT TO ITS COMMUNITY BENEFIT INITIATIVES. THE OVERALL GOAL OF THE ASSESSMENT WAS TO COMPILE INFORMATION FROM A RANGE OF QUANTITATIVE AND QUALITATIVE SOURCES TO CLARIFY THE HEALTH CARE NEEDS AND PRIORITIES OF COMMUNITY RESIDENTS AND ASSESS THE OVERALL STRENGTHS AND WEAKNESSES OF THE AREA'S HEALTH AND SOCIAL SERVICE SYSTEMS. ULTIMATELY, THE PURPOSE OF THE ASSESSMENT WAS TO FACILITATE THE DEVELOPMENT OF A STRATEGIC PLAN THAT WOULD GUIDE HOW NEBH WOULD WORK WITH STAKEHOLDERS IN MISSION AND HILL AND ROXBURY TO STRENGTHEN THE COMMUNITY AND IMPROVE HEALTH STATUS MOVING FORWARD. THE CHNA WAS CONDUCTED IN THREE PHASES:- PHASE I: THE JSI PROJECT TEAM CONDUCTED A PRELIMINARY NEEDS ASSESSMENT THAT RELIED HEAVILY ON QUANTITATIVE HEALTH-RELATED DATA DRAWN FROM THE MASSACHUSETTS COMMUNITY HEALTH INFORMATION PROFILE (MASSCHIP) SYSTEM AS WELL AS OTHER NATIONAL, STATE, AND LOCAL SOURCES. THESE DATA ALLOWED THE JSI PROJECT TEAM TO UNDERSTAND THE UNDERLYING CHARACTERISTICS OF AREA RESIDENTS AND IDENTIFY THE SPECIFIC SEGMENTS OF THE COMMUNITY MOST AT-RISK. - PHASE II: JSI CONDUCTED A SERIES OF INTERVIEWS WITH KEY STAKEHOLDERS AND TWO FOCUS GROUPS WITH COMMUNITY MEMBERS. THE FOCUS GROUPS HELPED THE JSI PROJECT TEAM TO ENGAGE THE COMMUNITY AND BETTER UNDERSTAND THEIR HEALTH STATUS, HEALTH-SEEKING BEHAVIORS, SERVICE GAPS, HEALTH-RELATED CHALLENGES, AND PRIORITIES. - PHASE III: CHRISTINE DWYER, DIRECTOR OF PUBLIC AFFAIRS AND COMMUNITY RELATIONS, AND BETH GREENSPAN, VICE PRESIDENT, CHIEF STRATEGY OFFICER, WORKED WITH JSI TO INTEGRATE THE CHNA'S FINDINGS, INCLUDING FEEDBACK FROM NEBH STAFF AND THE COMMUNITY, AND DEVELOPED NEBH'S COMMUNITY HEALTH IMPROVEMENT PLAN. IN PHASE III, JSI ALSO DEVELOPED A FINAL CHNA REPORT, OBTAINED APPROVAL FOR ITS COMMUNITY HEALTH IMPROVEMENT PLAN FROM NEBH'S BOARD OF TRUSTEES, AND DISSEMINATED THE RESULTS OF THE PROJECT TO INTERNAL AND EXTERNAL STAKEHOLDERS.THE CHNA UTILIZED A PARTICIPATORY, COLLABORATIVE APPROACH TO LOOK AT HEALTH IN ITS BROADEST CONTEXT. AS NOTED ABOVE, THE ASSESSMENT PROCESS INCLUDED SYNTHESIZING EXISTING DATA ON SOCIAL, ECONOMIC, AND HEALTH INDICATORS IN THE REGION AS WELL AS INFORMATION FROM COMMUNITY DIALOGUES CONDUCTED WITH COMMUNITY RESIDENTS, AND INTERVIEWS WITH COMMUNITY STAKEHOLDERS. (SCHEDULE H, PART V, SECTION B, QUESTION 3). NEBH CONDUCTED THIS CHNA PROCESS INDEPENDENTLY AS REPORTED IN SCHEDULE H, PART V, SECTION B, QUESTION 4.COMMUNITY HEALTH NEEDS ASSESSMENT - KEY FINDINGSTHE FOLLOWING ARE KEY FINDINGS RELATED TO COMMUNITY CHARACTERISTICS AND THE DETERMINANTS OF HEALTH FOR NEBH'S COMMUNITY BENEFIT SERVICE AREA. SINCE MISSION HILL IS THE DOMINANT GEOGRAPHY IN NEBH'S COMMUNITY BENEFIT SERVICE AREA, THE FOCUS OF THIS SUMMARY IS ON MISSION HILL AS COMPARED TO ROXBURY AND BOSTON OVERALL- AGE: MISSION HILL'S POPULATION HAS LARGER PROPORTIONS OF OLDER ADULTS (65+) AND SMALLER PROPORTIONS OF CHILDREN (<18) THAN THE POPULATIONS IN ROXBURY AND BOSTON OVERALL. WITH RESPECT TO AGE, THE MOST STRIKING FINDING IS THE EXTREMELY LARGE PROPORTION OF YOUNG ADULTS (COLLEGE STUDENTS) THAT RESIDE IN MISSION HILL COMPARED TO ROXBURY AND BOSTON OVERALL, WHICH SKEWS THE AGE DISTRIBUTION. MORE THAN 40% (40.2%) OF MISSION HILL'S POPULATION IS BETWEEN 18 AND 24 YEARS OLD, COMPARED TO 16.4 FOR ROXBURY AND 19.0% FOR BOSTON OVERALL."
201522269349303182,042103612,"SCHEDULE H, PART VI: LINE 1 & 2, PART V, SECTION B, LINES 1-9","NEEDS ASSESSMENT CONTINUED- RACE/ETHNICITY, FOREIGN BORN STATUS, AND LANGUAGE: THE PROPORTION OF RACIAL/ETHNIC MINORITY POPULATIONS IN MISSION HILL IS HIGH RELATIVE TO THE COMMONWEALTH OF MASSACHUSETTS OVERALL BUT MIRRORS THE PROPORTIONS IN BOTH ROXBURY AND BOSTON OVERALL. HOWEVER, THE SPECIFIC CHARACTERISTICS OF THE RACIAL/ETHNIC MINORITY POPULATION IN MISSION HILL ARE VERY DIFFERENT. IN MISSION HILL THERE ARE MUCH LARGER PERCENTAGES OF ASIAN RESIDENTS AND SMALLER PROPORTIONS OF AFRICAN AMERICAN AND HISPANIC RESIDENTS COMPARED TO ROXBURY. ACROSS MISSION HILL, ROXBURY,AND BOSTON OVERALL. HOWEVER, THE SPECIFIC CHARACTERISTICS OF THE RACIAL/ETHNIC MINORITY POPULATION IN MISSION HILL ARE VERY DIFFERENT. IN MISSION HILL THERE ARE MUCH LARGER PERCENTAGES OF ASIAN RESIDENTS AND SMALLER PROPORTIONS OF AFRICAN AMERICAN AND HISPANIC RESIDENTS COMPARED TO ROXBURY. ACROSS MISSION HILL, ROXBURY, AND BOSTON OVERALL, MORE THAN ONE-THIRD OF THE POPULATIONS ARE FOREIGN BORN AND MORE THAN ONE-THIRD OF THE POPULATIONS SPEAK A LANGUAGE OTHER THAN ENGLISH AT HOME. THERE ARE CLEAR AND WELL-RECOGNIZED HEALTH DISPARITIES AMONG RACIAL/ETHNIC MINORITY AND FOREIGN POPULATIONS COMPARED TO THE MAJORITY NON-HISPANIC WHITE POPULATION. IN ADDITION, THERE ARE SIGNIFICANT HEALTH LITERACY ISSUES AMONG RACIAL/ETHNIC MINORITIES, PARTICULARLY WITH FOREIGN-BORN POPULATIONS AND FOR THOSE WITH LIMITED ABILITY TO SPEAK ENGLISH. - INCOME/POVERTY: LARGE PROPORTIONS OF THE POPULATIONS IN MISSION HILL AND ROXBURY LIVE IN POVERTY (< 100% OF THE FEDERAL POVERTY LEVEL - FPL) OR LOW-INCOME HOUSEHOLDS (< 200% FPL) AND STRUGGLE TO PAY FOR FOOD AND OTHER BASIC HOUSEHOLD ITEMS. IN MISSION HILL 39% OF THE HOUSEHOLDS ARE LIVING IN POVERTY, COMPARED TO 35% IN ROXBURY, AND 21% IN BOSTON OVERALL. THE SIGNIFICANT AND NEGATIVE IMPACTS OF POVERTY WERE ALSO DISCUSSED IN NEARLY ALL OF INTERVIEWS AND IN EACH FOCUS GROUP. THE MISSION HILL FIGURES ARE SOMEWHAT SKEWED BY THE LARGE NUMBERS OF COLLEGE STUDENTS THAT LIVE IN THE AREA AND DO NOT HAVE A REGULAR INCOME. IF THESE YOUNG ADULTS LIVING IN NON-FAMILY HOUSEHOLDS ARE TAKEN OUT OF THE ANALYSIS, MISSION HILL FAIRS SLIGHTLY BETTER THAN ROXBURY. HOWEVER, POVERTY AND ITS IMPACTS ARE STILL MAJOR ISSUE FOR MISSION HILL'S FAMILIES AND OTHER MORE PERMANENT RESIDENTS. - EDUCATION: COMPARED TO BOSTON, RESIDENTS OF MISSION HILL ARE LESS LIKELY TO HAVE A HIGH SCHOOL DIPLOMA. COMPARED TO ROXBURY, HOWEVER, MISSION HILL RESIDENTS ARE MORE LIKELY TO HAVE A HIGH SCHOOL DIPLOMA. ONCE AGAIN, THIS DATA IS SKEWED BY THE HIGH NUMBER OF TRANSIENT YOUNG ADULT RESIDENTS WHO ATTEND BOSTON'S MANY UNIVERSITIES AND COLLEGES AND LIVE IN MISSION HILL.- LACK OF EMPLOYMENT, THE ECONOMIC DOWNTURN, AND ITS IMPACTS: WHILE MISSION HILL RESIDENTS APPEAR BETTER OFF THAN RESIDENTS OF ROXBURY ON THIS ISSUE, A LARGE PROPORTION OF THE MISSION HILL POPULATION ARE EITHER UNEMPLOYED OR DO NOT CONSIDER THEMSELVES PART OF THE WORKFORCE. THE UNEMPLOYMENT RATE IN MISSION HILL FOR PEOPLE OVER THE AGE OF 16 YEARS OLD IS JUST 8.1%, COMPARED TO 16.5% IN ROXBURY AND 10.2% IN BOSTON OVERALL. HOWEVER, IN ORDER TO GET A CLEAR PICTURE OF THIS ISSUE ONE MUST ALSO CONSIDER THE NUMBER AND PROPORTION OF THE POPULATION WHO DO NOT CONSIDER THEMSELVES PART OF THE WORKFORCE. IN MISSION HILL NEARLY 40% (5,873) OF THE 16-YEAR-OLD-AND-OVER POPULATION DOES NOT CONSIDER ITSELF TO BE PART OF LABOR FORCE, WHICH MEANS THAT 41% (5,873) OF THE TOTAL POPULATION IS NOT EMPLOYED. VIEWED IN THIS MANNER, MISSION HILL IS STILL BETTER OFF THAN ROXBURY BUT NOT NEARLY TO THE EXTENT THAT UNEMPLOYMENT FIGURES ALONE SUGGEST. IN ROXBURY, 51% (17,837) OF THE POPULATION IS NOT EMPLOYED AND IN BOSTON OVERALL THE FIGURE, NOT SURPRISINGLY, IS MUCH LOWER AT 38% (199,006). UNEMPLOYMENT AND THE IMPACT THAT THE ECONOMIC DOWNTURN HAS HAD ON THE MISSION HILL COMMUNITY OVER THE PAST 3-5 YEARS WAS ONE OF THE DOMINANT, IF NOT THE MOST DOMINANT, THEMES IN THE INTERVIEWS AND FOCUS GROUPS. LACK OF EMPLOYMENT OPPORTUNITIES FOR MISSION HILL'S YOUTH AND ADULTS HAS GREATLY IMPACTED THEIR ABILITY TO PROVIDE FOOD AND OTHER BASIC HOUSEHOLD ITEMS, TO SAY NOTHING OF OTHER COMFORTS THAT MANY TAKE FOR GRANTED. THESE ISSUES HAVE ALSO IMPACTED PEOPLE'S EMOTIONAL HEALTH AND LED TO ISOLATION, PARTICULARLY FOR OLDER ADULTS ON LIMITED FIXED INCOMES. CERTAINLY, POVERTY, UNEMPLOYMENT, ISOLATION, AND EMOTIONAL WELL-BEING ARE IMPORTANT DETERMINANTS OF HEALTH AND WELLNESS. - FOOD INSECURITY: ANOTHER DOMINANT THEME FROM THE INTERVIEWS AND FOCUS GROUPS WAS THE LACK OF ACCESS TO AFFORDABLE, HEALTHY FOODS. INTERVIEWEES AND FOCUS GROUP PARTICIPANTS DISCUSSED THE FACT THAT THERE ARE FEW PLACES FOR RESIDENTS OF MISSION HILL AND ROXBURY TO BUY REASONABLY PRICED FRESH VEGETABLES AND OTHER NUTRITIONAL FOODS. PARTICIPANTS ALSO SPOKE OF THE HIGH PRICES AND LACK OF FRESH VEGETABLES AT THE LARGE, LOCAL GROCERY STORES IN THE AREA AND THE LONG DISTANCES THAT THEY HAD TO TRAVEL TO ACCESS MORE AFFORDABLE HEALTHY FOOD OPTIONS.- TRANSPORTATION: GIVEN THE STEEP AND HILLY LANDSCAPE OF MISSION HILL, TRANSPORTATION WAS SEEN AS A MAJOR BARRIER AND DETERMINANT OF HEALTH AND WELL-BEING. LACK OF TRANSPORTATION WAS A LEADING THEME FROM THE ASSESSMENT INTERVIEWEES AND FOCUS GROUP PARTICIPANTS, ESPECIALLY FOR OLDER ADULT AND LOW-INCOME RESIDENTS LACKING A PERSONAL VEHICLE. INTERVIEWEES AND FOCUS GROUP PARTICIPANTS DISCUSSED CHALLENGES RELATED TO NAVIGATING THE HILLY TERRAIN ON MISSION HILL, THE ISOLATION THAT THOSE WITHOUT A PERSONAL CAR EXPERIENCED, THE NECESSITY FOR MANY TO TRAVEL OUTSIDE THE MISSION HILL AREA TO FIND AFFORDABLE FOOD AND OTHER BASIC ITEMS, AND THE IMPORTANCE OF THE MISSION LINK PUBLIC TRANSPORTATION SERVICE. - ACCESS TO RECREATIONAL FACILITIES: DESPITE THE DENSITY OF THE MISSION HILL COMMUNITY, ACCESS TO RECREATIONAL FACILITIES AND OPEN SPACES IS ONE OF MISSION HILL'S ASSETS. THERE ARE A NUMBER OF PARKS, RECREATIONAL AREAS, AND INDOOR COMMUNITY CENTERS. AS WILL BE DISCUSSED LATER IN THE REPORT, A HIGH PROPORTION OF THE POPULATION IS OVERWEIGHT AND DOES NOT GET REGULAR PHYSICAL EXERCISE, BUT NOT NECESSARILY BECAUSE RECREATIONAL FACILITIES OR OPEN SPACES ARE IN SHORT SUPPLY. - VIOLENCE: RATES OF HOMICIDE AND NON-FATAL GUNSHOT WOUNDS SEEN IN THE CITY'S HOSPITAL EMERGENCY DEPARTMENTS ARE CONSIDERABLY HIGHER IN ROXBURY (INCLUDING MISSION HILL) THAN IN BOSTON OVERALL. WHILE THERE WAS A CLEAR CONSENSUS AMONG INTERVIEWEES AND FOCUS GROUP PARTICIPANTS THAT THIS ISSUE HAD IMPROVED DRAMATICALLY OVER THE PAST 2 DECADES AND THAT MISSION HILL WAS CONSIDERABLY SAFER THAN ROXBURY OVERALL, THIS GROUP AGREED THAT VIOLENCE STILL HAD A MAJOR IMPACT ON THE COMMUNITY. VIOLENCE NEGATIVELY AFFECTS THE HEALTH OF THOSE DIRECTLY INVOLVED BUT ALSO HAS MAJOR NEGATIVE EMOTIONAL EFFECTS ON THOSE WHO ARE INDIRECTLY INVOLVED AND THE COMMUNITY MORE BROADLY. THESE IMPACTS INCLUDE MENTAL HEALTH ISSUES, ISOLATION, AND LACK OF COMMUNITY COHESION. NEARLY EVERYONE WHO WAS INTERVIEWED OR INVOLVED IN FOCUS GROUPS DISCUSSED THE IMPACTS OF VIOLENCE AND ITS ASSOCIATED TRAUMA, PARTICULARLY ON THE AREA'S YOUTH AND THEIR FAMILIES. NEARLY EVERYONE WE TALKED WITH SAID THAT THEY KNEW SOMEONE WHO HAD BEEN IMPACTED DIRECTLY BY VIOLENCE AND UNDERSTOOD FIRST-HAND THE TOLL IT TOOK ON THE COMMUNITY. COMMUNITY HEALTH NEEDS ASSESSMENT - COMMUNITY HEALTH PRIORITIESTHE CHNA'S APPROACH PROVIDED AMPLE OPPORTUNITY TO VET THE QUANTITATIVE AND QUALITATIVE DATA COMPILED DURING THE ASSESSMENT. IN ADDITION, INTERVIEW AND FOCUS GROUP PARTICIPANTS WERE ASKED WHAT THEY PERCEIVED TO BE THE LEADING COMMUNITY HEALTH PRIORITIES. ULTIMATELY, THERE WAS LITTLE DEBATE THAT THE MOST SIGNIFICANT HEALTH-RELATED ISSUE FACING THE COMMUNITIES SURROUNDING NEBH WAS THE BROADER 1) SOCIAL AND ECONOMIC DETERMINANTS (E.G., POVERTY, UNEMPLOYMENT, FOOD INSECURITY, VIOLENCE, TRANSPORTATION), WHICH PREVENT MANY RESIDENTS, PARTICULARLY LOW INCOME, RACIAL/ETHNIC MINORITY, AND OLDER ADULT RESIDENTS FROM MAINTAINING A HEALTHY LIFESTYLE AND/OR ACCESSING THE REGULAR PREVENTIVE AND ACUTE HEALTH SERVICES THEY NEED. IN ADDITION TO THIS UNDERLYING PRIORITY, 2) ISSUES RELATED OBESITY, LACK OF PHYSICAL EXERCISE, AND POOR NUTRITION AS WELL AS THE CHRONIC DISEASES THAT ARE OFTEN ASSOCIATED WITH THESE FACTORS WERE SEEN AS ANOTHER PRIORITY. FINALLY, ISSUES RELATED TO 3) ELDER HEALTH (E.G., GENERAL HEALTH AND WELLNESS, FALLS PREVENTION, ISOLATION/DEPRESSION, OSTEOPOROSIS, CHRONIC DISEASE) WERE ALSO A PRIORITY. THIS IS PARTICULARLY TRUE IF ONE PRIORITIZES THE MORE PERMANENT RESIDENTS OF THE COMMUNITY, WHO ARE DISPROPORTIONATELY OLDER THAN THE COMMUNITY OVERALL."

SUCH ASSISTANCE TAKES INTO ACCOUNT EACH INDIVIDUAL'S ABILITY TO CONTRIBUTE TO THE COST OF HIS OR HER CARE.FOR THOSE PATIENTS THAT ARE UNINSURED OR UNDERINSURED, THE HOSPITAL WILL WORK WITH THEM TO ASSIST WITH APPLYING FOR AVAILABLE FINANCIAL ASSISTANCE PROGRAMS THAT MAY COVER ALL OR SOME OF THEIR UNPAID HOSPITAL BILLS. THE HOSPITAL PROVIDES THIS ASSISTANCE FOR BOTH RESIDENTS AND NON-RESIDENTS OF MASSACHUSETTS; HOWEVER, THERE MAY NOT BE COVERAGE IN A STATE PUBLIC ASSISTANCE PROGRAM FOR A MASSACHUSETTS HOSPITAL'S SERVICES THROUGH AN OUT-OF STATE RESIDENT. IN ORDER FOR THE HOSPITAL TO ASSIST UNINSURED AND UNDERINSURED PATIENTS FIND THE MOST APPROPRIATE COVERAGE OPTIONS AS WELL AS DETERMINE IF THE PATIENT IS FINANCIALLY ELIGIBLE FOR ANY DISCOUNTS IN PAYMENTS, PATIENTS MUST ACTIVELY WORK WITH HOSPITALS TO VERIFY THE PATIENT'S DOCUMENTED FAMILY INCOME, OTHER INSURANCE COVERAGE, AND ANY OTHER INFORMATION THAT COULD BE USED IN DETERMINING ELIGIBILITY. 2. ENROLLMENT IN A PUBLIC ASSISTANCE PROGRAMHOSPITALS HAVE NO ROLE IN SPECIFICALLY DETERMINING THE ELIGIBILITY FOR ENROLLMENT WITHIN A PUBLIC ASSISTANCE PROGRAM. IN MASSACHUSETTS, INDIVIDUALS APPLY FOR COVERAGE IN MASSHEALTH, THE PREMIUM ASSISTANCE PAYMENT PROGRAM OFFERED THROUGH THE HEALTH CONNECTOR (INCLUDING CONNECTORCARE), HEALTH SAFETY NET, THE CHILDREN'S MEDICAL SECURITY PROGRAM, OR MEDICAL HARDSHIP MUST DO SO THROUGH A SINGLE UNIFORM APPLICATION THAT IS SUBMITTED THROUGH THE STATE'S NEW ENROLLMENT SYSTEM CALLED THE HEALTH INSURANCE EXCHANGE (HIX). THROUGH THIS PROCESS, THE INDIVIDUAL CAN SUBMIT AN APPLICATION THROUGH AN ONLINE WEBSITE (WHICH IS CENTRALLY LOCATED ON THE STATE'S HEALTH CONNECTOR WEBSITE), A PAPER APPLICATION, OR OVER THE PHONE WITH A CUSTOMER SERVICE REPRESENTATIVE LOCATED AT EITHER MASSHEALTH OR THE CONNECTOR. INDIVIDUALS MAY ALSO ASK FOR ASSISTANCE FROM THE HOSPITAL'S FINANCIAL COUNSELORS (CAC -""CERTIFIED APPLICATION COUNSELOR"") WITH SUBMITTING THE APPLICATION EITHER ON THE WEBSITE OR THROUGH A PAPER APPLICATION. IN ORDER TO APPLY FOR COVERAGE, THE FOLLOWING PROCESS OCCURS:1. AN INDIVIDUAL IS REQUESTED TO DEVELOP AN ONLINE ACCOUNT FOR USE BY THE STATE TO CONDUCT AN IDENTITY VERIFICATION OF THE INDIVIDUAL. ONCE THIS IS COMPLETED, THE INDIVIDUAL IS THEN ABLE TO SUBMIT A COMPLETED APPLICATION THROUGH THE HCENTIVE SYSTEM ON THE CONNECTOR WEBSITE. IF THE INDIVIDUAL DOES NOT WANT TO GO THROUGH THE ONLINE IDENTITY VERIFICATION SYSTEM, THEY CAN SUBMIT A PAPER APPLICATION. OTHER VERIFICATION MAY STILL BE NEEDED, INCLUDING PROOF OF INCOME, RESIDENCY, AND CITIZENSHIP. 2. ONCE THE APPLICATION IS RECEIVED, THE STATE WILL VERIFY THE ELIGIBILITY BY COMPARING THE INDIVIDUALS FINANCIAL AND OTHER DEMOGRAPHIC INFORMATION TO A FEDERAL DATA SITE AS WELL AS CONDUCTING AN INCOME REVIEW USING A MODIFIED ADJUSTED GROSS INCOME REVIEW.

IN ADDITION, THE HOSPITAL WILL USE THIS INFORMATION TO DISCUSS ELIGIBILITY FOR CERTAIN HEALTH INSURANCE PROGRAMS. IF THE PATIENT OR GUARANTOR IS UNABLE TO PROVIDE THE NECESSARY INFORMATION, THE HOSPITAL MAY (AT THE PATIENT'S REQUEST) MAKE REASONABLE EFFORTS TO OBTAIN ANY ADDITIONAL INFORMATION FROM OTHER SOURCES. THIS WILL OCCUR WHEN THE PATIENT IS SCHEDULING THEIR SERVICES, DURING PRE-REGISTRATION, WHILE THE PATIENT IS ADMITTED IN THE HOSPITAL, UPON DISCHARGE, OR FOR A REASONABLE TIME FOLLOWING DISCHARGE FROM THE HOSPITAL. INFORMATION THAT THE HOSPITAL OBTAINS WILL BE MAINTAINED IN ACCORDANCE WITH APPLICABLE FEDERAL AND STATE PRIVACY AND SECURITY LAWS.THE SCREENING AND APPLICATION PROCESS FOR A PUBLIC HEALTH INSURANCE PROGRAMS IS DONE THROUGH EITHER THE VIRTUAL GATEWAY (WHICH IS AN INTERNET PORTAL DESIGNED BY THE MASSACHUSETTS EXECUTIVE OFFICE OF HEALTH AND HUMAN SERVICES TO PROVIDE THE GENERAL PUBLIC, MEDICAL PROVIDERS, AND COMMUNITY-BASED ORGANIZATIONS WITH AN ONLINE APPLICATION FOR THE PROGRAMS OFFERED BY THE STATE) OR THROUGH A STANDARD PAPER APPLICATION THAT IS COMPLETED BY THE PATIENT AND ALSO SUBMITTED DIRECTLY TO THE MASSACHUSETTS EXECUTIVE OFFICE OF HEALTH AND HUMAN SERVICES FOR PROCESSING.

IN SPECIAL CIRCUMSTANCES, THE HOSPITAL MAY APPLY FOR THE PATIENT FOR ELIGIBILITY IN THE HEALTH SAFETY NET PROGRAM USING A SPECIFIC FORM DESIGNED BY THE MASSACHUSETTS DIVISION OF HEALTH CARE FINANCE AND POLICY. SPECIAL CIRCUMSTANCES INCLUDE INDIVIDUALS SEEKING FINANCIAL ASSISTANCE COVERAGE DUE TO BEING INCARCERATED, VICTIMS OF SPOUSAL ABUSE, OR APPLYING DUE TO A MEDICAL HARDSHIP. THE HOSPITAL SPECIFICALLY ASSISTS THE PATIENT IN COMPLETING THE MASSACHUSETTS EXECUTIVE OFFICE OF HEALTH AND HUMAN SERVICES STANDARD APPLICATION AND SECURING THE NECESSARY DOCUMENTATION REQUIRED BY THE APPLICABLE FINANCIAL ASSISTANCE PROGRAM.

THE HOSPITAL WILL THEN SUBMIT THIS DOCUMENTATION TO THE MASSACHUSETTS OFFICE OF MEDICAID AND ASSIST THE PATIENT IN SECURING ANY ADDITIONAL DOCUMENTATION IF SUCH IS REQUESTED BY THE STATE AFTER COMPLETING THE APPLICATION. MASSACHUSETTS PLACES A THREE DAY TIME LIMITATION ON SUBMITTING ALL NECESSARY DOCUMENTATION FOLLOWING THE SUBMISSION OF THE APPLICATION FOR A PROGRAM. FOLLOWING THIS THREE DAY PERIOD, THE PATIENT AND THE PROVIDER MUST WORK WITH THE MASSHEALTH ENROLLMENT CENTERS TO SECURE THE ADDITIONAL DOCUMENTATION NEEDED FOR ENROLLMENT IN THE APPLICABLE FINANCIAL ASSISTANCE PROGRAM. ALL VIRTUAL GATEWAY AND PAPER APPLICATIONS ARE REVIEWED AND PROCESSED BY THE MASSACHUSETTS OFFICE OF MEDICAID, WHICH USES THE FEDERAL POVERTY GUIDELINES, ASSET INFORMATION, AS WELL AS THE NECESSARY DOCUMENTATION LISTED ABOVE AS THE BASIS FOR DETERMINING ELIGIBILITY FOR STATE SPONSORED PUBLIC ASSISTANCE PROGRAMS. THE ELIGIBILITY FOR ENROLLMENT INTO THE HEALTH SAFETY NET PROGRAM FOR FULL OR PARTIAL HEALTH SAFETY NET COVERAGE IS ALSO DETERMINED THROUGH THE VIRTUAL GATEWAY. THE HOSPITAL WILL ALSO ASSIST OTHER PATIENTS, SUCH AS MINORS RECEIVING CONFIDENTIAL SERVICES OR INDIVIDUALS WHO HAVE BEEN BATTERED OR ABUSED, OBTAIN COVERAGE THROUGH THE HEALTH SAFETY NET BY USING THE MASSACHUSETTS DIVISION OF HEALTH CARE FINANCE AND POLICY SPECIAL CIRCUMSTANCE APPLICATION. A COPY OF THE FEDERAL POVERTY GUIDELINES THAT ARE USED BY THE STATE IS ATTACHED TO THIS POLICY. HOSPITALS HAVE NO ROLE IN THE DETERMINATION OF PROGRAM ELIGIBILITY MADE BY THE STATE, BUT AT THE PATIENT'S REQUEST MAY TAKE A DIRECT ROLE IN APPEALING OR SEEKING INFORMATION RELATED TO THE COVERAGE DECISIONS. IT IS STILL THE PATIENT'S RESPONSIBILITY TO INFORM THE HOSPITAL OF ALL COVERAGE DECISIONS MADE BY THE STATE TO ENSURE ACCURATE AND TIMELY ADJUDICATION OF ALL HOSPITAL BILLS.3.

201522269349303182,042103612,"SCHEDULE H, PART VI, LINE 4: COMMUNITY INFORMATION","THE COMMUNITY SERVED BY NEW ENGLAND BAPTIST HOSPITAL (NEBH) IS DETERMINED BY PROXIMITY TO THE HOSPITAL AND AN EVALUATION OF DISCHARGE DATA. ITS PRIMARY COMMUNITY SERVICE AREA IS THE BOSTON NEIGHBORHOOD OF MISSION HILL; HOWEVER, THE HOSPITAL'S PATIENT BASE AND SERVICES EXTEND TO OTHER BOSTON NEIGHBORHOODS AND SURROUNDING TOWNS. PRIMARY COMMUNITY SERVICE AREA: MISSION HILL, BOSTON AND PARTS OF ROXBURY AND JAMAICA PLAINSMISSION HILL IS A ONE SQUARE MILE NEIGHBORHOOD LOCATED APPROXIMATELY ONE MILE FROM BOSTON'S DOWNTOWN BUSINESS DISTRICT. APPROXIMATELY THREE QUARTERS OF THE NEIGHBORHOOD IS RESIDENTIAL MADE-UP OF PRIVATELY OWNED ONE TO THREE FAMILY BUILDINGS AND A NUMBER OF MULTI-FAMILY BUILDINGS. MISSION HILL'S POPULATION OF AROUND 19,000 PEOPLE IS RACIALLY AND ECONOMICALLY DIVERSE. ATOP THE HILL IS NEW ENGLAND BAPTIST HOSPITAL AND MCLAUGHLIN PLAYGROUND, WHICH EXTENDS FROM THE HOSPITAL GROUNDS DOWN PARKER HILL AVENUE. MCLAUGHLIN PLAYGROUND, IS ONE OF THE HIGHEST POINTS IN THE CITY WHERE YOU CAN OBSERVE A PANORAMIC VIEW OF DOWNTOWN BOSTON, BOSTON HARBOR, AND THE BLUE HILLS.COMMUNITY HEALTH NEEDS ASSESSMENT - KEY FINDINGSTHE FOLLOWING ARE KEY FINDINGS RELATED TO COMMUNITY CHARACTERISTICS AND THE DETERMINANTS OF HEALTH FOR NEBH'S COMMUNITY BENEFIT SERVICE AREA. SINCE MISSION HILL IS THE DOMINANT GEOGRAPHY IN NEBH'S COMMUNITY BENEFIT SERVICE AREA, THE FOCUS OF THIS SUMMARY IS ON MISSION HILL AS COMPARED TO ROXBURY AND BOSTON OVERALL- AGE: MISSION HILL'S POPULATION HAS LARGER PROPORTIONS OF OLDER ADULTS (65+) AND SMALLER PROPORTIONS OF CHILDREN (<18) THAN THE POPULATIONS IN ROXBURY AND BOSTON OVERALL. WITH RESPECT TO AGE, THE MOST STRIKING FINDING IS THE EXTREMELY LARGE PROPORTION OF YOUNG ADULTS (COLLEGE STUDENTS) THAT RESIDE IN MISSION HILL COMPARED TO ROXBURY AND BOSTON OVERALL, WHICH SKEWS THE AGE DISTRIBUTION. MORE THAN 40% (40.2%) OF MISSION HILL'S POPULATION IS BETWEEN 18 AND 24 YEARS OLD, COMPARED TO 16.4 FOR ROXBURY AND 19.0% FOR BOSTON OVERALL.- RACE/ETHNICITY, FOREIGN BORN STATUS, AND LANGUAGE: THE PROPORTION OF RACIAL/ETHNIC MINORITY POPULATIONS IN MISSION HILL IS HIGH RELATIVE TO THE COMMONWEALTH OF MASSACHUSETTS OVERALL BUT MIRRORS THE PROPORTIONS IN BOTH ROXBURY AND BOSTON OVERALL. HOWEVER, THE SPECIFIC CHARACTERISTICS OF THE RACIAL/ETHNIC MINORITY POPULATION IN MISSION HILL ARE VERY DIFFERENT. IN MISSION HILL THERE ARE MUCH LARGER PERCENTAGES OF ASIAN RESIDENTS AND SMALLER PROPORTIONS OF AFRICAN AMERICAN AND HISPANIC RESIDENTS COMPARED TO ROXBURY. ACROSS MISSION HILL, ROXBURY, AND BOSTON OVERALL, MORE THAN ONE-THIRD OF THE POPULATIONS ARE FOREIGN BORN AND MORE THAN ONE-THIRD OF THE POPULATIONS SPEAK A LANGUAGE OTHER THAN ENGLISH AT HOME. THERE ARE CLEAR AND WELL-RECOGNIZED HEALTH DISPARITIES AMONG RACIAL/ETHNIC MINORITY AND FOREIGN POPULATIONS COMPARED TO THE MAJORITY NON-HISPANIC WHITE POPULATION. IN ADDITION, THERE ARE SIGNIFICANT HEALTH LITERACY ISSUES AMONG RACIAL/ETHNIC MINORITIES, PARTICULARLY WITH FOREIGN-BORN POPULATIONS AND FOR THOSE WITH LIMITED ABILITY TO SPEAK ENGLISH. - INCOME/POVERTY: LARGE PROPORTIONS OF THE POPULATIONS IN MISSION HILL AND ROXBURY LIVE IN POVERTY (< 100% OF THE FEDERAL POVERTY LEVEL - FPL) OR LOW-INCOME HOUSEHOLDS (< 200% FPL) AND STRUGGLE TO PAY FOR FOOD AND OTHER BASIC HOUSEHOLD ITEMS. IN MISSION HILL 39% OF THE HOUSEHOLDS ARE LIVING IN POVERTY, COMPARED TO 35% IN ROXBURY, AND 21% IN BOSTON OVERALL. THE SIGNIFICANT AND NEGATIVE IMPACTS OF POVERTY WERE ALSO DISCUSSED IN NEARLY ALL OF INTERVIEWS AND IN EACH FOCUS GROUP. THE MISSION HILL FIGURES ARE SOMEWHAT SKEWED BY THE LARGE NUMBERS OF COLLEGE STUDENTS THAT LIVE IN THE AREA AND DO NOT HAVE A REGULAR INCOME. IF THESE YOUNG ADULTS LIVING IN NON-FAMILY HOUSEHOLDS ARE TAKEN OUT OF THE ANALYSIS, MISSION HILL FAIRS SLIGHTLY BETTER THAN ROXBURY. HOWEVER, POVERTY AND ITS IMPACTS ARE STILL MAJOR ISSUE FOR MISSION HILL'S FAMILIES AND OTHER MORE PERMANENT RESIDENTS. - EDUCATION: COMPARED TO BOSTON, RESIDENTS OF MISSION HILL ARE LESS LIKELY TO HAVE A HIGH SCHOOL DIPLOMA. COMPARED TO ROXBURY, HOWEVER, MISSION HILL RESIDENTS ARE MORE LIKELY TO HAVE A HIGH SCHOOL DIPLOMA. ONCE AGAIN, THIS DATA IS SKEWED BY THE HIGH NUMBER OF TRANSIENT YOUNG ADULT RESIDENTS WHO ATTEND BOSTON'S MANY UNIVERSITIES AND COLLEGES AND LIVE IN MISSION HILL.- LACK OF EMPLOYMENT, THE ECONOMIC DOWNTURN, AND ITS IMPACTS: WHILE MISSION HILL RESIDENTS APPEAR BETTER OFF THAN RESIDENTS OF ROXBURY ON THIS ISSUE, A LARGE PROPORTION OF THE MISSION HILL POPULATION ARE EITHER UNEMPLOYED OR DO NOT CONSIDER THEMSELVES PART OF THE WORKFORCE. THE UNEMPLOYMENT RATE IN MISSION HILL FOR PEOPLE OVER THE AGE OF 16 YEARS OLD IS JUST 8.1%, COMPARED TO 16.5% IN ROXBURY AND 10.2% IN BOSTON OVERALL. HOWEVER, IN ORDER TO GET A CLEAR PICTURE OF THIS ISSUE ONE MUST ALSO CONSIDER THE NUMBER AND PROPORTION OF THE POPULATION WHO DO NOT CONSIDER THEMSELVES PART OF THE WORKFORCE. IN MISSION HILL NEARLY 40% (5,873) OF THE 16-YEAR-OLD-AND-OVER POPULATION DOES NOT CONSIDER ITSELF TO BE PART OF LABOR FORCE, WHICH MEANS THAT 41% (5,873) OF THE TOTAL POPULATION IS NOT EMPLOYED. VIEWED IN THIS MANNER, MISSION HILL IS STILL BETTER OFF THAN ROXBURY BUT NOT NEARLY TO THE EXTENT THAT UNEMPLOYMENT FIGURES ALONE SUGGEST. IN ROXBURY, 51% (17,837) OF THE POPULATION IS NOT EMPLOYED AND IN BOSTON OVERALL THE FIGURE, NOT SURPRISINGLY, IS MUCH LOWER AT 38% (199,006). UNEMPLOYMENT AND THE IMPACT THAT THE ECONOMIC DOWNTURN HAS HAD ON THE MISSION HILL COMMUNITY OVER THE PAST 3-5 YEARS WAS ONE OF THE DOMINANT, IF NOT THE MOST DOMINANT, THEMES IN THE INTERVIEWS AND FOCUS GROUPS. LACK OF EMPLOYMENT OPPORTUNITIES FOR MISSION HILL'S YOUTH AND ADULTS HAS GREATLY IMPACTED THEIR ABILITY TO PROVIDE FOOD AND OTHER BASIC HOUSEHOLD ITEMS, TO SAY NOTHING OF OTHER COMFORTS THAT MANY TAKE FOR GRANTED. THESE ISSUES HAVE ALSO IMPACTED PEOPLE'S EMOTIONAL HEALTH AND LED TO ISOLATION, PARTICULARLY FOR OLDER ADULTS ON LIMITED FIXED INCOMES. CERTAINLY, POVERTY, UNEMPLOYMENT, ISOLATION, AND EMOTIONAL WELL-BEING ARE IMPORTANT DETERMINANTS OF HEALTH AND WELLNESS. - FOOD INSECURITY: ANOTHER DOMINANT THEME FROM THE INTERVIEWS AND FOCUS GROUPS WAS THE LACK OF ACCESS TO AFFORDABLE, HEALTHY FOODS. INTERVIEWEES AND FOCUS GROUP PARTICIPANTS DISCUSSED THE FACT THAT THERE ARE FEW PLACES FOR RESIDENTS OF MISSION HILL AND ROXBURY TO BUY REASONABLY PRICED FRESH VEGETABLES AND OTHER NUTRITIONAL FOODS. PARTICIPANTS ALSO SPOKE OF THE HIGH PRICES AND LACK OF FRESH VEGETABLES AT THE LARGE, LOCAL GROCERY STORES IN THE AREA AND THE LONG DISTANCES THAT THEY HAD TO TRAVEL TO ACCESS MORE AFFORDABLE HEALTHY FOOD OPTIONS.- TRANSPORTATION: GIVEN THE STEEP AND HILLY LANDSCAPE OF MISSION HILL, TRANSPORTATION WAS SEEN AS A MAJOR BARRIER AND DETERMINANT OF HEALTH AND WELL-BEING. LACK OF TRANSPORTATION WAS A LEADING THEME FROM THE ASSESSMENT INTERVIEWEES AND FOCUS GROUP PARTICIPANTS, ESPECIALLY FOR OLDER ADULT AND LOW-INCOME RESIDENTS LACKING A PERSONAL VEHICLE. INTERVIEWEES AND FOCUS GROUP PARTICIPANTS DISCUSSED CHALLENGES RELATED TO NAVIGATING THE HILLY TERRAIN ON MISSION HILL, THE ISOLATION THAT THOSE WITHOUT A PERSONAL CAR EXPERIENCED, THE NECESSITY FOR MANY TO TRAVEL OUTSIDE THE MISSION HILL AREA TO FIND AFFORDABLE FOOD AND OTHER BASIC ITEMS, AND THE IMPORTANCE OF THE MISSION LINK PUBLIC TRANSPORTATION SERVICE. - ACCESS TO RECREATIONAL FACILITIES: DESPITE THE DENSITY OF THE MISSION HILL COMMUNITY, ACCESS TO RECREATIONAL FACILITIES AND OPEN SPACES IS ONE OF MISSION HILL'S ASSETS. THERE ARE A NUMBER OF PARKS, RECREATIONAL AREAS, AND INDOOR COMMUNITY CENTERS. AS WILL BE DISCUSSED LATER IN THE REPORT, A HIGH PROPORTION OF THE POPULATION IS OVERWEIGHT AND DOES NOT GET REGULAR PHYSICAL EXERCISE, BUT NOT NECESSARILY BECAUSE RECREATIONAL FACILITIES OR OPEN SPACES ARE IN SHORT SUPPLY. - VIOLENCE: RATES OF HOMICIDE AND NON-FATAL GUNSHOT WOUNDS SEEN IN THE CITY'S HOSPITAL EMERGENCY DEPARTMENTS ARE CONSIDERABLY HIGHER IN ROXBURY (INCLUDING MISSION HILL) THAN IN BOSTON OVERALL. WHILE THERE WAS A CLEAR CONSENSUS AMONG INTERVIEWEES AND FOCUS GROUP PARTICIPANTS THAT THIS ISSUE HAD IMPROVED DRAMATICALLY OVER THE PAST 2 DECADES AND THAT MISSION HILL WAS CONSIDERABLY SAFER THAN ROXBURY OVERALL, THIS GROUP AGREED THAT VIOLENCE STILL HAD A MAJOR IMPACT ON THE COMMUNITY. VIOLENCE NEGATIVELY AFFECTS THE HEALTH OF THOSE DIRECTLY INVOLVED BUT ALSO HAS MAJOR NEGATIVE EMOTIONAL EFFECTS ON THOSE WHO ARE INDIRECTLY INVOLVED AND THE COMMUNITY MORE BROADLY. THESE IMPACTS INCLUDE MENTAL HEALTH ISSUES, ISOLATION, AND LACK OF COMMUNITY COHESION. NEARLY EVERYONE WHO WAS INTERVIEWED OR INVOLVED IN FOCUS GROUPS DISCUSSED THE IMPACTS OF VIOLENCE AND ITS ASSOCIATED TRAUMA, PARTICULARLY ON THE AREA'S YOUTH AND THEIR FAMILIES. NEARLY EVERYONE WE TALKED WITH SAID THAT THEY KNEW SOMEONE WHO HAD BEEN IMPACTED DIRECTLY BY VIOLENCE AND UNDERSTOOD FIRST-HAND THE TOLL IT TOOK ON THE COMMUNITY."

THE HOSPITAL PROVIDES IN-KIND AND FINANCIAL SUPPORT FOR SEVERAL ECONOMIC INITIATIVES THROUGHOUT THE CITY OF NEW HAVEN. MEMBERS OF THE HOSPITAL'S LEADERSHIP AND MANAGEMENT STAFF ALSO SUPPORT ECONOMIC DEVELOPMENT BY SERVING ON THE BOARDS OF THE GREATER NEW HAVEN CHAMBER OF COMMERCE, GUILFORD CHAMBER OF COMMERCE, ECONOMIC DEVELOPMENT CORPORATION OF NEW HAVEN, REGIONAL GROWTH PARTNERSHIP, REGIONAL LEADERSHIP COUNCIL, ARTS COUNCIL OF GREATER NEW HAVEN, INTERNATIONAL FESTIVAL OF ARTS AND IDEAS, MARKET NEW HAVEN, TWEED NEW HAVEN, AND THE TENNIS FOUNDATION OF CONNECTICUT. THROUGH THESE ORGANIZATIONS, YALE-NEW HAVEN HOSPITAL ADVOCATES FOR AND FACILITATES INCREASED ECONOMIC DEVELOPMENT FOR THE AREA. YALE-NEW HAVEN HOSPITAL, ALONG WITH MANY OTHER HOSPITALS ACROSS THE COUNTRY, UTILIZES THE COMMUNITY BENEFITS INVENTORY FOR SOCIAL ACCOUNTABILITY (CBISA) DATABASE DEVELOPED BY LYON SOFTWARE TO CATALOG ITS COMMUNITY BENEFIT AND COMMUNITY BUILDING ACTIVITIES AND THE GUIDELINES DEVELOPED BY THE CATHOLIC HOSPITAL ASSOCIATION (CHA) IN ORDER TO CATALOG THESE BENEFITS. THESE TWO ORGANIZATIONS HAVE WORKED TOGETHER FOR OVER 20 YEARS TO PROVIDE SUPPORT TO NOT-FOR-PROFIT HOSPITALS TO DEVELOP AND SUSTAIN EFFECTIVE COMMUNITY BENEFIT PROGRAMS.THE MOST RECENT VERSION OF THE CHA GUIDE FOR PLANNING AND REPORTING COMMUNITY BENEFIT DEFINES COMMUNITY BUILDING ACTIVITIES AS PROGRAMS THAT ADDRESS THE ROOT CAUSES OF HEALTH PROBLEMS, SUCH AS POVERTY, HOMELESSNESS AND ENVIRONMENTAL PROBLEMS. THESE ACTIVITIES ARE CATEGORIZED INTO EIGHT DISTINCT AREAS INCLUDING PHYSICAL IMPROVEMENT AND HOUSING, ECONOMIC DEVELOPMENT, COMMUNITY SUPPORT, ENVIRONMENTAL IMPROVEMENTS, LEADERSHIP DEVELOPMENT AND TRAINING FOR COMMUNITY MEMBERS, COALITION BUILDING, ADVOCACY FOR COMMUNITY HEALTH IMPROVEMENTS, AND WORKFORCE DEVELOPMENT. YALE NEW HAVEN HEALTH ENHANCES THE LIVES OF THOSE WE SERVE BY PROVIDING ACCESS TO INTEGRATED, HIGH-VALUE, PATIENT-CENTERED CARE IN COLLABORATION WITH OTHERS WHO SHARE OUR VALUES. AS SUCH, YALE-NEW HAVEN HOSPITAL IS INCREASINGLY AWARE OF HOW SOCIAL DETERMINANTS IMPACT THE HEALTH OF INDIVIDUALS AND COMMUNITIES. A PERSON'S HEALTH AND CHANCES OF BECOMING SICK AND DYING EARLY ARE GREATLY INFLUENCED BY POWERFUL SOCIAL FACTORS SUCH AS EDUCATION, INCOME, NUTRITION, HOUSING AND NEIGHBORHOODS. DURING FISCAL YEAR 2014, YALE-NEW HAVEN HOSPITAL PROVIDED $3.5 MILLION IN FINANCIAL AND IN-KIND DONATIONS TO SUPPORT AFFORDABLE HOUSING PROGRAMS, JOB TRAINING, ECONOMIC DEVELOPMENT AND OTHER ESSENTIAL SERVICES. THE HOSPITAL CONSIDERS THESE INVESTMENTS PART OF ITS OVERALL COMMITMENT OF BUILDING STRONGER NEIGHBORHOODS. EXAMPLES BELOW FOCUS ON THE AREAS OF REVITALIZING OUR NEIGHBORHOODS, CREATING EDUCATIONAL OPPORTUNITIES, AND WORKFORCE DEVELOPMENT INITIATIVES.REVITALIZING OUR NEIGHBORHOODS-OVER THE PAST SEVERAL YEARS, YALE-NEW HAVEN HOSPITAL HAS MADE SIGNIFICANT INVESTMENTS TOWARDS THE REVITALIZATION OF THE CITY OF NEW HAVEN, ADDRESSING THE AREAS OF ADEQUATE, AFFORDABLE AND SAFE HOUSING. ACCORDING TO THE LATEST CENSUS DATA, 27% OF HOMES IN NEW HAVEN WERE OWNER-OCCUPIED COMPARED TO 63 PERCENT IN THE STATE OF CONNECTICUT. AS A RESULT, THE NEW HAVEN POPULATION IS INCREASINGLY MOBILE. TO REVERSE THIS TREND, YALE-NEW HAVEN HOSPITAL HAS FOCUSED ON INCREASING PERMANENT HOME OWNERSHIP THROUGH THE FOLLOWING TWO INITIATIVES.IN 2006, YALE-NEW HAVEN HOSPITAL AND ITS MEDICAL STAFF BEGAN A MULTI-YEAR PARTNERSHIP WITH HABITAT FOR HUMANITY OF GREATER NEW HAVEN TO BUILD HOMES IN NEW HAVEN'S HILL NEIGHBORHOOD FOR LOW-INCOME FAMILIES. TO DATE, THIS COLLABORATION HAS JOINTLY BUILT SIX HOMES WITH THE MOST RECENT BUILD COMPLETED IN 2013. OVER 300 EMPLOYEE VOLUNTEERS HAVE COLLECTIVELY INVESTED MORE THAN 4,000 HOURS IN THIS PROJECT, WHILE YALE-NEW HAVEN HOSPITAL SPONSORED THE BUILDING MATERIALS FOR EACH HOME. THE HOME OWNERSHIP MADE EASIER (H.O.M.E.) PROGRAM AT YALE-NEW HAVEN HOSPITAL PROVIDES HOSPITAL EMPLOYEES WITH UP TO $10,000 IN FORGIVABLE LOANS TO HELP PURCHASE THEIR FIRST HOME IN THE CITY OF NEW HAVEN. THIS YEAR, THE PROGRAM HELPED 16 EMPLOYEES AND THEIR FAMILIES. SINCE THE PROGRAM'S INCEPTION IN 2006, A TOTAL OF 119 HOMES HAVE BEEN PURCHASED BY YALE-NEW HAVEN HOSPITAL EMPLOYEES. TO DATE $902,500 IN FINANCIAL ASSISTANCE HAS BEEN PROVIDED TO EMPLOYEES IN THE FORM OF DOWN PAYMENTS AND MORTGAGE PAYMENTS. AMONG THE HOMES PURCHASED THROUGH THE H.O.M.E. PROGRAM WAS ONE HABITAT FOR HUMANITY PROPERTY. RESULTS FROM THE FALL 2012 COMMUNITY ALLIANCE FOR RESEARCH AND ENGAGEMENT AT YALE SCHOOL OF PUBLIC HEALTH SURVEY OF NEW HAVEN'S LOW-INCOME NEIGHBORHOODS, INCLUDING THE HILL NORTH NEIGHBORHOOD WHERE THE HOSPITAL IS LOCATED, PROVIDE EVIDENCE THAT ACCESS TO HEALTHY AFFORDABLE FOOD IS A MAJOR PUBLIC HEALTH CONCERN. FOR EXAMPLE, ABOUT 40% OF RESPONDENTS SAID THEY WERE NOT ALWAYS ABLE TO AFFORD TO BUY VEGETABLES, FRUIT, HEALTHY OILS OR WHOLE GRAINS. OVER THE PAST FOUR YEARS, YALE-NEW HAVEN HOSPITAL HAS BEEN A PROUD SPONSOR, ALONG WITH THE CONNECTICUT MENTAL HEALTH CENTER, OF THE CITY SEED, INC. FARMER'S MARKET IN THE HILL NEIGHBORHOOD. THE FARMER'S MARKET IS HELD IN THE CONNECTICUT MENTAL HEALTH CENTER PARKING LOT ADJACENT TO THE YALE-NEW HAVEN HOSPITAL'S YORK STREET CAMPUS EACH YEAR FROM JUNE THROUGH OCTOBER AND OFFERS HEALTHY, AFFORDABLE FOOD FOR LOCAL RESIDENTS. IN ADDITION, AS PART OF A SUSTAINABILITY PROGRAM AIMED AT ADDRESSING FOOD INSECURITY, YALE-NEW HAVEN HOSPITAL AND ROCK AND WRAP IT UP! TEAMED UP TO RECOVER FOOD THAT HAS BEEN PREPARED BUT NOT SERVED FROM THE HOSPITAL AND DONATED IT TO THE COMMUNITY SOUP KITCHEN AT CHRIST CHURCH AND ST. LUKE'S EPISCOPAL CHURCH IN NEW HAVEN AS WELL AS ST. ANN'S SOUP KITCHEN IN HAMDEN. THE 2013-2014 HOSPITAL-SPONSORED, EMPLOYEE UNITED WAY CAMPAIGN RAISED OVER $148,450 TO SUPPORT THE NONPROFITS SERVED BY THE GREATER NEW HAVEN UNITED WAY. THROUGH THE HOSPITAL'S ANNUAL SCHOOL READINESS DRIVE, WHICH IS PART OF THE CAMPAIGN, EMPLOYEES DONATED APPROXIMATELY 14,000 SCHOOL SUPPLIES TO STUDENTS AT TWO NEW HAVEN ELEMENTARY SCHOOLS IN NEW HAVEN'S HILL COMMUNITY.

THE DECENTRALIZATION OF POLICE SERVICES AND THE ESTABLISHMENT OF SUBSTATION MANAGEMENT TEAMS IN EACH OF NEW HAVEN'S 10 COMMUNITY POLICING DISTRICTS HAS BEEN ONE OF THE MOST IMPORTANT COMMUNITY POLICING INITIATIVES IN NEW HAVEN. COMMUNITY SUBSTATION MANAGEMENT TEAMS HELP IDENTIFY AND DEVELOP STRATEGIES TO RESOLVE NEIGHBORHOOD PROBLEMS UTILIZING LOCAL RESOURCES. THE MANAGEMENT TEAMS ARE COMPRISED OF THE POLICE SUPERVISOR, BEAT OFFICERS, BLOCK WATCH MEMBERS, ALDERPERSONS, REPRESENTATIVES OF NEIGHBORHOOD BASED AGENCIES, SUCH AS THE HOSPITAL, AND ANY CITIZEN WHO TAKES AN ACTIVE INTEREST IN NEIGHBORHOOD IMPROVEMENT.CREATING EDUCATIONAL OPPORTUNITIES- HIGHER EDUCATIONAL ATTAINMENT IS ASSOCIATED WITH BETTER HEALTH STATUS AND LONGER LIFE. FOR EXAMPLE, ADULTS AGED 25-50 YEARS WHO HAVE A COLLEGE DEGREE WILL ON AVERAGE LIVE FIVE YEARS LONGER THAN THOSE WITH LESS THAN A HIGH SCHOOL EDUCATION. ACCORDING TO RECENT CENSUS STATISTICS, ONLY 80.5% OF INDIVIDUALS IN THE CITY OF NEW HAVEN HAD ATTAINED THE EQUIVALENT OF A HIGH SCHOOL EDUCATION OR GREATER COMPARED TO NEARLY 90% STATEWIDE. ADDITIONALLY, NEW HAVEN YOUTH HAVE LOWER HIGH SCHOOL COMPLETION RATES AND SCORE WELL BELOW THEIR STATE-WIDE PEERS ON THE CONNECTICUT MASTERY TEST. IN RESPONSE TO THESE STATISTICS, YALE-NEW HAVEN HOSPITAL SUPPORTED A VARIETY OF EDUCATIONAL PROGRAMS IN 2014.IN 2011, REFLECTING ITS STRONG COMMITMENT TO THE NEW HAVEN COMMUNITY AND SUPPORT OF EDUCATION, YALE-NEW HAVEN HOSPITAL COMMITTED TO A MULTI-YEAR CONTRIBUTION TOTALING $2.0 MILLION OVER FOUR YEARS TO SUPPORT NEW HAVEN PROMISE. NEW HAVEN PROMISE IS A COLLEGE SCHOLARSHIP AND SUPPORT PROGRAM FOR THE CITY'S PUBLIC SCHOOL STUDENTS. YALE-NEW HAVEN'S CONTRIBUTION FUNDS THE INITIATIVE'S PARTNERSHIP COMPONENT. ITS GOAL IS TO MAKE HIGHER EDUCATION AN EXPECTATION AND REALITY FOR MORE NEW HAVEN STUDENTS. THE PROGRAM IS ADMINISTERED BY THE COMMUNITY FOUNDATION OF GREATER NEW HAVEN. THOUGH THE IMPACT OF THE NEW HAVEN PROMISE PROGRAM WILL NOT BE MEASURABLE FOR SEVERAL YEARS, NEW HAVEN PROMISE HAS OVER 220 STUDENTS ENROLLED IN 17 CONNECTICUT COLLEGES AND UNIVERSITIES.

Financially indigent shall mean uninsured or underinsured patients accepted for care with no obligation or a discounted obligation to pay for services rendered based on the medical center's eligibility system which may include:(a) income levels and means testing or other criteria for determining a patient's inability to pay; or (b) other criteria for determining a patient's inability to pay that are consistent with the medical center's mission and established policy.

The patient would be required to provide documentation of income to determine if he/she is to be considered medically indigent. All patients are eligible to be considered for medically indigent status with the exception of patients with income below 200% of the federal poverty level as these patients are considered for some level of uncompensated care under the financially indigent category."

SAINT MARY'S ALSO WORKS CLOSELY WITH MANY LOCAL CHARITABLE COMMUNITY SERVICE ORGANIZATIONS TO BOTH IDENTIFY AND ADDRESS COMMUNITY NEEDS. SAINT MARY'S HOSPITAL (SMH) INDIVIDUAL COMMUNITY BENEFIT PROGRAMS HAVE BEEN DESIGNED TO MEET THE LONG-STANDING NEEDS OF INDIVIDUALS LIVING IN THE SERVICE AREA. TO IDENTIFY NEED, SMH HAS RELIED ON EXISTING LOCAL AND REGIONAL NEEDS ASSESSMENTS INCLUDING: UNITED WAY OF GREATER WATERBURY'S COMMUNITY STATUS REPORT (2013); UNITED WAY'S TEN-YEAR PLAN TO END HOMELESSNESS (2013); THE CENTERS FOR DISEASE CONTROL AND PREVENTION BEHAVIORAL RISK FACTOR SURVEILLANCE SYSTEM (2013); CONNECTICUT DEPARTMENT OF PUBLIC HEALTH STATE HEALTH ASSESSMENT (2013); AND THE CONNECTICUT HEALTH CARE SURVEY (2013) BY THE CONNECTICUT HEALTH FOUNDATION. IN ADDITION, THE HOSPITAL USES CONNECTICUT HOSPITAL ASSOCIATION (CHA) ONLINE TOOLS WHICH INCLUDE THE CHIME DECISION SUPPORT TOOL AND CHIME MAPS TO UNDERSTAND SERVICE AREA NEEDS. THE HOSPITAL USES THE CENSUS BUREAU DATABASES AS WELL AS DEMOGRAPHIC REPORTS AVAILABLE THROUGH CLARITAS DATABASES. BETWEEN 2012 AND 2013, SAINT MARY'S CONDUCTED A COMMUNITY HEALTH NEEDS ASSESSMENT (CHNA). SAINT MARY'S REACHED OUT TO LOCAL ORGANIZATIONS AND FORMED THE GREATER WATERBURY HEALTH IMPROVEMENT PARTNERSHIP (THE PARTNERSHIP). THE PARTNERSHIP INCLUDES LOCAL NON-PROFIT ORGANIZATIONS (SAINT MARY'S HOSPITAL, WATERBURY HOSPITAL, THE WATERBURY DEPARTMENT OF HEALTH, UNITED WAY OF GREATER WATERBURY, STAYWELL HEALTH CENTER, AND THE CONNECTICUT COMMUNITY FOUNDATION). PARTNERSHIP MEMBERS EACH CONTRIBUTED FINANCIAL RESOURCES TO CONDUCT THE COMMUNITY HEALTH NEEDS ASSESSMENT. DATA COLLECTION AND RESEARCH SAINT MARY'S CONTRACTED WITH HOLLERAN, AN INDEPENDENT RESEARCH AND CONSULTING FIRM LOCATED IN LANCASTER, PENNSYLVANIA, TO CONDUCT RESEARCH IN SUPPORT OF THE CHNA. THE CHNA INCLUDED BOTH QUALITATIVE AND QUANTITATIVE DATA COLLECTION METHODS. QUALITATIVE DATA WERE COLLECTED THROUGH BOTH A KEY INFORMANT ONLINE SURVEY AND SIX FOCUS GROUPS. TWO HUNDRED FIVE COMMUNITY LEADERS, PARTNERS AND HEALTH CARE PROVIDERS PARTICIPATED IN THE ONLINE KEY INFORMANT SURVEY. TWO FOCUS GROUPS WITH HEALTHCARE PROVIDERS WERE HELD AT EACH OF THE HOSPITALS; 24 HEALTH CARE PROVIDERS PARTICIPATED. FOUR FOCUS GROUPS WERE HELD AT NEIGHBORHOOD ASSOCIATIONS IN WATERBURY; 33 LOCAL RESIDENTS PARTICIPATED. QUANTITATIVE DATA WERE COLLECTED THROUGH A STATISTICAL HOUSEHOLD TELEPHONE SURVEY OF 1,100 PEOPLE IN THE SAINT MARY'S SERVICE AREA. THE STATISTICAL HOUSEHOLD SURVEY WAS BASED ON THE BEHAVIORAL RISK FACTOR SURVEILLANCE SYSTEM (BRFSS) STUDY DEVELOPED BY THE CENTERS FOR DISEASE CONTROL AND PREVENTION (CDC). THE SURVEY ASSESSED INDICATORS SUCH AS GENERAL HEALTH STATUS, PREVENTION ACTIVITIES (SCREENINGS, ETC.) AND RISK BEHAVIORS (ALCOHOL USE, ETC.). THE RESULTS WERE EXAMINED BY A VARIETY OF DEMOGRAPHIC INDICATORS INCLUDING AGE AND GENDER. SPECIAL ATTENTION WAS GIVEN TO IDENTIFYING THE NEEDS OF UNDERSERVED INDIVIDUALS, INCLUDING LOW-INCOME, MINORITY, AND CHRONIC CONDITION POPULATIONS IN THE SAINT MARY'S SERVICE AREA. IN ADDITION TO THE HOUSEHOLD SURVEY, SECONDARY DATA WERE ALSO ANALYZED AS PART OF THE CHNA. PRIORITIZATION ON JUNE 18, 2013, THE PARTNERSHIP HELD A PRIORITIZATION SESSION THAT INCLUDED 40 INDIVIDUALS REPRESENTING LOCAL HEALTH AND HUMAN SERVICE AGENCIES, AREA NON-PROFIT ORGANIZATIONS, HEALTH PROVIDERS AND PUBLIC HEALTH REPRESENTATIVES. THE OBJECTIVES OF THE PRIORITIZATION SESSION WERE TO REVIEW THE RECENTLY COMPILED COMMUNITY HEALTH DATA AND HIGHLIGHT KEY RESEARCH FINDINGS; TO GATHER FEEDBACK FROM THE COMMUNITY REPRESENTATIVES; AND TO PRIORITIZE THE COMMUNITY HEALTH NEEDS BASED ON SELECTED CRITERIA. ATTENDEES VOTED ON THE TOP FOUR PRIORITY AREAS. THE SELECTED PRIORITIES ARE (1) ACCESS TO CARE; (2) MENTAL HEALTH AND SUBSTANCE ABUSE; (3) CHRONIC DISEASES - OBESITY, DIABETES, HEART DISEASE AND ASTHMA; AND (4) SMOKING. IMPLEMENTATION STRATEGY SAINT MARY'S HOSPITAL DEVELOPED AN IMPLEMENTATION STRATEGY TO ILLUSTRATE SPECIFIC PROGRAMS AND RESOURCES THAT SUPPORT THESE IDENTIFIED COMMUNITY HEALTH PRIORITIES. THE IMPLEMENTATION STRATEGY WAS ADOPTED BY THE SAINT MARY'S BOARD OF DIRECTORS ON SEPTEMBER 12, 2013. THE IMPLEMENTATION STRATEGY IS ATTACHED TO THIS FILING. THE CHNA SUMMARY REPORT AND IMPLEMENTATION STRATEGY ARE ALSO AVAILABLE ON THE HOSPITAL'S WEBSITE (WWW.STMH.ORG). ONCE THE IMPLEMENTATION STRATEGY WAS CREATED, CONTINUED MONTHLY MEETINGS WITH THE GREATER WATERBURY HEALTH IMPROVEMENT PARTNERSHIP WERE DONE TO ENSURE TAHT EACH ORGANIZATION STAYED ON TRACK WITH THE NEEDS OF THE COMMUNITY. THERE ARE SEVERAL REPRESENATIVES FROM SAINT MARY'S THAT ATTEND THESE MEETINGS EACH MONTH TO NOT ONLY IMPROVE THE HOSPITAL WITH INCREMENTAL CHANGES, BUT THE GREATER WATERBURY COMMUNITY AS A WHOLE.

201522249349301082,362167060,Part III Line 2 - Bad Debt Expense,"Bad debt expense was reported at cost using a cost-to-charge methodology. The Schedule H, Worksheet 2, Ratio of Patient Care Cost-to-Charges calculated to report charity care on Part I, Line 7a was multiplied by the bad debt expense to determine the bad debt expense at cost.

NorthShore University HealthSystem (NorthShore) believes that all of the $74,604,669 Medicare shortfall should be considered as community benefit. The Internal Revenue Service Community Benefit Standard includes the provision of care to the elderly and Medicare patients. Medicare shortfalls must be absorbed by NorthShore in order to continue treating the elderly in our community. During fiscal year 2014, Medicare accounted for approximately 47% of hospital gross patient revenues. The hospital provides care regardless of this shortfall and thereby relieves the government of the burden of paying the full cost of care for Medicare beneficiaries."

Patients qualifying for financial assistance are recognized as charity care accounts when sufficient information is received to determine their eligibility. Prior to this point, an allowance for doubtful accounts is calculated on uninsured accounts. This allowance is reversed if the account is determined to qualify for financial assistance."

THE HOSPITAL USES FINANCIAL AND OTHER INFORMATION OF SUCH PATIENTS OTHERWISE AVAILABLE TO THE HOSPITAL TO IDENTIFY THOSE patients THAT would qualify for charity care if they completed the paperwork. THE HOSPITAL ANALYZES ITS PAST HISTORY AND IDENTIFIES THE PERCENTAGE OF THE BAD DEBT EXPENSE THAT IS EVENTUALLY REVERSED DUE TO PATIENTS QUALIFYING FOR FINANCIAL ASSISTANCE. THE HOSPITAL APPLIES THAT PERCENTAGE TO THE BAD DEBT EXPENSE TO ESTIMATE THE AMOUNT OF THE HOSPITAL'S BAD DEBT EXPENSE THAT WILL BE FOUND TO BE ATTRIBUTABLE TO PATIENTS ELIGIBLE FOR FINANCIAL ASSISTANCE. The bad debt expense associated with SUCH PATIENTS' ACCOUNTS ARE treated as community benefit.

These costs and charges are adjusted to account for items not reimbursed through the cost report such as provider-based physician services. IRS Revenue Ruling 69-545, which established the community benefit standard for nonprofit hospital's states that if a hospital serves patients with government health benefits, including Medicare, then this is an indication that the hospital operates to promote the health of the community.

201501349349304460,430653493,"Part VI, Line 5:","PROMOTION OF COMMUNITY HEALTHMercy Hospitals East Communities (""MHEC"") provides quality medical health care regardless of race, creed, sex, national origin, handicap, age or ability to pay. In active pursuit of this mission, MHEC provided services to 47,163 inpatients, 116,251 emergency room visits, 1,038,214 outpatient visits, 82,102 home health visits and 51,790 clinic visits.MHEC is a Catholic health care corporation that, pursuant to the organizational core belief that health care services are a vital and integral part of the Church's healing mission, engages in a ministry which provides general acute care, ambulatory, long-term and home care health services to individuals and families in its service communities. Consistent with the organization's commitment to social accountability and the provision of community benefit, MHEC offers other services and programs which further health promotion, maintenance and care. MHEC's services include two clinics which were established specifically for individuals who are uninsured or underinsured and do not have a means to pay for healthcare services. These clinics provide a significant focus on prenatal care. Many clinic patients were also treated, on a charitable basis, as inpatients. In response to the increased needs of the underinsured in the St. Louis area, these clinics have continually expanded, offering new services to more patients. The institution continues to focus on the provision of primary health services and education to the community, regardless of their means to pay for these services. The organization also has a continuing commitment to health research and to health education at all levels.Although reimbursement for services rendered is critical to the continued ability to provide healthcare services to all patients, MHEC recognizes that not all individuals possess the ability to purchase essential medical services and, further, that part of our mission is to provide healthcare services and healthcare education to the communities in which our facilities are located. In keeping with MHEC's commitment to serve all members of the communities it serves, MHEC provides (i) free care and/or subsidized care; (ii) care to persons covered by governmental programs at below cost; (iii) health activities and programs to support the community; (iv) health education programs; and, (v) a variety of broad community support activities. JFK & McAuley ClinicsConsidered two of the most comprehensive clinics in St Louis and Franklin counties, Mercy Hospital St. Louis' JFK Clinic and Mercy Hospital Washington's McAuley Clinic offer medical, obstetrical, gynecological and pediatric services to a diverse population of over 10,000 patients who are economically disadvantaged, uninsured or underinsured. With more than 60,000 patient visits each year, the clinics serve as a major safety net provider in their communities. Clinic patients also have access to specialty care, behavioral health counseling and treatment, pharmacy services, vision and dental care. The JFK and McAuley Clinics are rolled up with overall Charity Care and unreimbursed cost of Medicaid community benefit figures, but the incredible work of these Mercy Clinics serving the poorest individuals and families in our communities is not described in any area of this report. Access to CareMercy partnered with the St. Louis Integrated Health Network (IHN) and contracted for a new Community Referral Coordinator (CRC) position in the fall of 2013 to help emergency room patients connect with the medical care they need. The CRC focuses on Medicaid and uninsured patients, but works with all patients to: - Enhance access to a primary care home and health resources regardless of ability to pay - Reduce non-emergent use of emergency departments and low acuity readmissions - Enhance continuity of care - Strengthen communications/processes among hospital, safety net and other primary care providers, and community social services agencies/programs This CRC program is a collaborative effort between Mercy, the IHN and other area hospitals and clinics to improve access, quality and transitions of care. The IHN serves as a platform for multiple health providers to share best practices, troubleshoot problems and oversee the CRC program in the region. Since its launch, the Community Resource Coordinator at Mercy has helped more than 1,000 patients and referred more than 500 to primary care providers.School-based Health InitiativeExamples of improving community health through building partnerships with area schools include:HealthTeacher is a health literacy program that provides online health and wellness tools and resources for educators, students in Kindergarten through 12th grade, and families by integrating health into the classrooms. Health and wellness education, especially for children, is essential in disease prevention and in promoting the health of every community. This program is offered by Mercy at no charge to public and parochial schools in our communities. Mercy Clinic at Roosevelt High School - a partnership between Mercy, St Louis Public Schools, and The Boeing Company produced Mercy's first school-based clinic in one of the inner city's most challenging schools. Routine physicals and urgent care is complemented with on-site behavioral health services and educational programs focused on healthy lifestyles. Initial community partnerships include the YMCA Literacy Council and the St Louis City Department of Health with other partnerships being developed. The Roosevelt school-based health center is managed by our integrated physician group and is therefore not able to be included as a community benefit on Schedule H. Open Medical Staff Medical staff privileges are extended to all qualified physicians in the community for almost all of our departments. Mercy Hospital St. Louis has exclusive contracts with physician groups for the following services: radiology, pathology, neonatology, and CV surgery. Mercy Hospital Washington has exclusive contracts with physician groups for the following services: pathology, radiology, cardiology, and obstetrics This means that over 90% of the physicians on staff are in categories that are open to qualified physicians in the community.PhysiciansMuch work in terms of prevention/wellness education takes place in collaboration with our integrated physician practices. Tobacco cessation, nutrition (weight loss education and exercise) are just a few examples of critical work that our physicians engage in through their practices and in the communities through outreach. In addition, many hours of time have been spent preparing to become and Accountable Care Organization (ACO) and implementing Meaningful Use. These activities are not reflected in this report.Community EngagementAs Mercy works to continue to improve its community benefit program, a greater focus is being placed on recording involvement by leadership and clinical co-workers on boards, coalitions, and other organizations. We believe this is a vital part of our work and one that is significantly underreported.Use of Surplus FundsSurplus funds and unrestricted assets held by Mercy Health East Communities are reinvested in patient care, medical education and research initiatives which support the organization's mission to deliver compassionate care and exceptional health care services to the communities it serves. Examples include the following:- A new inpatient child and adolescent behavioral health unit was opened at Mercy Children's Hospital in St. Louis to serve the needs of children in the communities served. It is the first of its kind in the St. Louis and the only pediatric behavioral health unit housed in a children's hospital- Enhancement and expansion of women's services at Mercy Hospital St. Louis, providing a full range of services to women regardless of ability to pay- Purchase of new state of the art Linear Accelerator medical equipment at Mercy Hospital Washington to provide high quality care and treatment for cancer patients in their local community- Continued funding of the Mercy Health East Communities Research Institute which is dedicated to improving patient outcomes by supporting new and potentially life-changing health research including over 100 active clinical trials at Mercy Hospital St. Louis.- Continued funding of graduate medical education program (provides residency training in family medicine, internal medicine, OB/Gyn, dental medicine, orthopedics and critical care) and schools of radiology, respiratory and clinical laboratory science."

OF THESE BABIES, 10.6% WERE OF LOW BIRTH WEIGHT AND 13.7% WERE PREMATURE. LOW BIRTH WEIGHT AND PREMATURITY ARE INTERTWINED AND CORRELATED. AS CITED IN QUESTION #2, LOW BIRTH WEIGHT IS A KEY HEALTH STATUS INDICATOR THAT IS MEASURED AND TRACKED BY BALTIMORE CITY DEPARTMENT OF HEALTH THAT MUST BE DECREASED IN INCIDENCE.THE HOSPITAL HAS TAKEN A LEADERSHIP ROLE THROUGH ITS ACTIVE PARTICIPATION IN ""B'MORE FOR HEALTHLY BABIES"", A LONG TERM INITIATIVE LED BY THE MAYOR'S OFFICE AND MANAGED BY BALTIMORE CITY HEALTH DEPARTMENT TO REDUCE THE INCIDENTS OF LOW BIRTH WEIGHT. DR ROBERT ATLAS, CHAIRMAN OF MERCY MEDICAL CENTER'S DEPARTMENT OF OBSTETRICS AND GYNECOLOGY, HAS A LEADERSHIP ROLE WITHIN THIS WORKGROUP.

AN INDIVIDUAL'S INCOME UNDER THE HUD GUIDELINES IS A SIGNIFICANT FACTOR IN DETERMINING ELIGIBILITY FOR FINANCIAL ASSISTANCE. HOWEVER, IN DETERMINING WHETHER TO EXTEND DISCOUNTED OR FREE CARE TO A PATIENT, THE PATIENT'S ASSETS MAY ALSO BE TAKEN INTO CONSIDERATION. FOR EXAMPLE, A PATIENT SUFFERING A CATASTROPHIC ILLNESS MAY HAVE A REASONABLE LEVEL OF INCOME, BUT A LOW LEVEL OF LIQUID ASSETS SUCH THAT THE PAYMENT OF MEDICAL BILLS WOULD BE SERIOUSLY DETRIMENTAL TO THE PATIENT'S BASIC FINANCIAL (AND ULTIMATELY PHYSICAL) WELL-BEING AND SURVIVAL.

The Rockefeller University Hospital community served/service area is determined based on research being conducted. Principal Investigators identify an area of interest and submit a protocol for review and approval by our institutional review board. If and when the protocol is approved, our recruitment office works with the investigator to develop and submit advertisements in local newspapers, magazines and online. Identification of lucrative places to advertise is determined by current trends in readership among local newspapers, magazines and visits to particular websites such as Craigslists and Facebook. Research participants are culled from all over New York City as well as through collaborations with neighboring hospitals, Universities, and clinics. As a result, our enrolled research participant demographics follow those of New York City overall.

These activities include the following programs:Community Support: (1) Temple University Hospital Emergency Preparedness and Research Program. The purpose of this program is to ensure that our staff and hospital facilities are prepared to continue to provide safe, quality patient care even under the most austere conditions. We ensure that our staff and facilities are prepared for disasters and other emergencies by working on many levels, both within the hospital and in the communities we serve. The TUH Emergency Preparedness and Research Program is also a critical link in the federal, state and local disaster response plans. Our Emergency Preparedness Department is involved in three local committees, including the North Philadelphia Emergency Healthcare Support Zone, the Regional Hospital Subcommittee; and the Emergency Support Function-8 Work Group. These committees are focused on creation of drills, policy development, and continuing education.(2) Cradle to Grave Anti-Violence. This program helps reduce the financial, emotional, and societal costs of gun violence in the City of Philadelphia. Temple's Cradle to Grave program works with at-risk youth to help break the cycle of gun violence, reaching more than 1,500 people this year. Since the program began in 2006, Cradle to Grave has connected with more than 9,000 middle and high school students, as well as at-risk youth from area alternative schools and the Juvenile Justice Center of Philadelphia.(3) Blood Drives. Temple University Hospital works closely with the American Red Cross to support its mission of providing a safe and reliable blood supply that helps ensure quality outcomes and save lives. This year, Temple helped collect more than 650 pints of blood from employees and physicians.(4) Philadelphia MOM program: Temple University Hospital assists the Philadelphia Department of Health in providing early interventions for healthy newborns. After identification at Temple University Hospital, city social workers make home visitations through the child's 6th birthday to ensure that they have access to healthcare and educational resources. (5) Temple University Hospital conducts numerous employees engagement activities throughout the year, including collections for new coats and clothing, holiday gifts, food, and school supplies to benefit low income families living in our communities. We are particularly proud of the support that we provide to local public schools, where many families have limited resources to purchase warm weather clothing and school supplies for their young children. We also conduct drives to support disabled children and adults to help them participate in the adapted cycling program of the Pennsylvania Center for Adapted Sports.(6) Temple University Hospital also assists in providing free space and supports for the City of Philadelphia District Attorney Office Youth Aid Panel, as well as the Philadelphia Election Commission's efforts to provide safe, accessible polling places for community members.(7) Temple Center for Population Health: Serves as an interface with federal, state and local agencies and with community based organizations to collaborate on initiatives to improve the health of our low-income, diverse, medically complex population.Workforce Development: Investment in Community's Healthcare Workforce. The purpose of this program is to build local workforce and improve skills sets needed to deliver quality healthcare. This involves comprehensive training and education to help workers living in our community adapt and improve skills to enable them to participate in a changing healthcare workplace. About half the students are union members and half from the general community, including laid-off workers and Welfare recipients.Community Health Worker Program: Work in partnership with TU Center for Social Policy, District Council 1199c Training and Upgrade Fund and Philadelphia Workforce Development Corporation to develop job skills for unemployed individuals living in our community while achieving the national goals of improving healthcare quality, improving the health of our communities, and reducing the cost of quality care."

The Hospital extends medical staff privileges to all qualified physicians in its community. The Windham Hospital Foundation, a related organization, raises funds to assure that the latest advancements in technology are available to our patients, as well as a range of community benefit programs that are not funded by other sources. We are a true community resource as we offer space for other community groups to meet at no charge, bring together other health providers for health fairs and educational sessions for the community, and encourage the involvement of our staff on various boards and councils that promote the overall health of the community. The hospital uses its surplus funds to provide additional benefits to its patients and the community it serves."

HHC, through its affiliates including The Hospital of Central Connecticut, strives to improve health using the ""Triple Aim"" model: improving quality and experience of care; improving health of the population (population health) and reducing costs. The Strategic Planning and Community Benefit Committee of the HHC Board of Directors ensures the oversight for these services by each hospital community. In addition, HHC continues to take important steps toward achieving its vision of being ""nationally respected for excellence in patient care and most trusted for personalized, coordinated care"".The affiliation with HHC creates a strong, integrated health care delivery system with a full continuum of care across a broader geographic area. This allows the small communities easy and expedient access to the more extensive and specialized services the larger hospitals are able to offer. This includes continuing education of health care professionals at all the affiliated institutions through the Center of Education, Simulation and Innovation located at Hartford Hospital, the largest of the system hospitals.The affiliation further enhances the hospitals' abilities to support their missions, identity, and respective community roles. This is achieved through integrated planning and communication to meet the changing needs of the region. This includes responsible decision making and appropriate sharing of services, resources and technologies, as well as containment strategies. Additionally, the hospital is affiliated with several other non hospital charitable organizations. These organizations provide significant benefits to the community. These benefits are not reported in the Community Benefit data provided by the hospital."

ALONG WITH PROVIDING CARE TO MEDICAID PATIENTS AND PROVIDING FREE OR DISCOUNTED CARE TO OTHER LOW INCOME PATIENTS, THE IRS COMMUNITY BENEFIT STANDARD INCLUDES THE PROVISION OF CARE TO THE ELDERLY AND MEDICARE PATIENTS. FOR MANY OF THE MEDICAL SERVICES PROVIDED BY THE HOSPITAL, MEDICARE DOES NOT PROVIDE SUFFICIENT REIMBURSEMENT TO COVER THE COST OF PROVIDING CARE TO THESE PATIENTS, FORCING GLH TO USE OTHER FUNDS TO COVER THE SHORTFALL. MEDICARE SHORTFALLS MUST BE ABSORBED BY GLH IN ORDER TO CONTINUE TREATING THE ELDERLY IN OUR COMMUNITY. GLH PROVIDES CARE REGARDLESS OF THE MEDICARE SHORTFALL AND THEREBY RELIEVES THE FEDERAL GOVERNMENT OF THE BURDEN OF PAYING THE FULL COST FOR PROVIDING CARE TO MEDICARE PATIENTS.

MEMBERS GIVE INSIGHT INTO WHAT THE COMMUNITY IS SAYING ABOUT THE HOSPITAL AND SUGGESTIONS FOR CHANGES TO MAKE THE HOSPITAL EXPERIENCE MORE PATIENT- FOCUSED. THE MARKETING ADVISORY COMMITTEE'S PURPOSE IS TO PROVIDE GUIDANCE FOR THE HOSPITAL'S MARKETING AND OUTREACH EFFORTS. MEDICAL STAFF SURVEYS: THE PRIMARY OBJECTIVE OF THE MEDICAL STAFF ASSESSMENT PROCESS WAS TO CREATE A MEDICAL STAFF DEVELOPMENT PLAN FOR GLH THAT PROJECTS THE NEEDS FOR PHYSICIANS OVER THE NEXT SEVERAL YEARS, BY SPECIALTY, IN THE HOSPITAL'S PRIMARY AND SECONDARY SERVICE AREAS. IN ADDITION, THE SURVEY WAS USED TO CREATE A PHYSICIAN RECRUITMENT STRATEGY FOR THE HOSPITAL AND MEMBERS OF THE MEDICAL STAFF.

SINCE 1989, THE PENNSYLVANIA DEPARTMENT OF HEALTH HAS RELEASED ANNUAL REPORTS USING BRFSS DATA ON VARIOUS HEALTH RISK BEHAVIORS, SUCH AS SMOKING, DRINKING, SEAT BELT USAGE AND HEALTH STATUS. HOW IS ALL OF THE ABOVE INFORMATION PULLED TOGETHER AND UTILIZED? VARIOUS HOSPITAL STAFF MEMBERS ASSIST WITH THE DATA COLLECTION. PRIMARY AND SECONDARY DATA IS ORGANIZED INTO COMPUTER FILES TO MAKE THE INFORMATION EASIER TO USE AND ANALYZE. ONCE THE HOSPITAL HAS THE PRIMARY AND SECONDARY DATA COLLECTED AND IN HAND, THE SENIOR TEAM SPENDS TIME ANALYZING THE DATA TO DISCERN PATTERNS AND THEMES. ASSESSMENT DATA FINDINGS ARE SHARED WITH A VARIETY OF GROUPS INTERNALLY AND EXTERNALLY (MANAGEMENT STAFF, MEDICAL- DENTAL STAFF, BOARD OF TRUSTEES, COMMUNITY ORGANIZATIONS). SINCE SUFFICIENT RESOURCES ARE NOT AVAILABLE TO ADDRESS ALL THE HEALTH CONCERNS IDENTIFIED IN THE ASSESSMENTS, CHOICES MUST BE MADE ABOUT WHICH ISSUES ARE DESIGNATED AS PRIORITIES FOR ACTION IN THE SHORT TO INTERMEDIATE TERM (ONE TO THREE YEARS). IN GENERAL, THE HOSPITAL ADDRESSES THREE TO FOUR PRIORITIES. THE HOSPITAL COLLABORATES WITH OTHER COMMUNITY STAKEHOLDERS TO GAIN A GREATER COMMITMENT TO ACTION. A CONSENSUS IS REACHED WITH INPUT FROM HOSPITAL STAFF, MEDICAL STAFF, THE BOARD OF TRUSTEES, AND COMMUNITY MEMBERS. CRITERIA THAT ARE USED TO IDENTIFY THE MOST SIGNIFICANT HEALTH ISSUES INCLUDE: THE MAGNITUDE OF THE PROBLEM THE SEVERITY OF THE PROBLEM A HIGH NEED AMONG VULNERABLE POPULATIONS CRITERIA THAT ARE USED TO EVALUATE WHICH HEALTH ISSUES THE HOSPITAL SHOULD PRIORITIZE INCLUDE: THE HOSPITAL'S CAPACITY TO ACT ON THE ISSUE, INCLUDING ECONOMIC,SOCIAL, AND CULTURAL CONSIDERATIONS. THE FEASIBILITY OF HAVING A MEASURABLE IMPACT ON THE ISSUE COMMUNITY RESOURCES ALREADY FOCUSED ON THE ISSUE WHETHER THE ISSUE IS A ROOT CAUSE OF OTHER PROBLEMS (THEREBY POSSIBLY AFFECTING MULTIPLE ISSUES) WHEN THE ISSUES HAVE BEEN PRIORITIZED, THE SENIOR TEAM AND BOARD OF TRUSTEES DISCUSS THE PRIORITIZED LIST AND ASK FOR ADDITIONAL INPUT AND VALIDATION.

THIS RURAL AREA CONTAINS SOME 145,000 PEOPLE SPREAD OVER MORE THAN 2,500 SQUARE MILES OF RUGGED TERRAIN LOCATED IN THE HEART OF THE APPALACHIAN MOUNTAINS IN CENTRAL PENNSYLVANIA. THE AVERAGE POPULATION DENSITY IS APPROXIMATELY 60 PERSONS PER SQUARE MILE. THE JUNIATA RIVER RUNS ALONG THE VERDANT VALLEYS AND SLICES THROUGH NARROW MOUNTAIN PASSES TO CONNECT OUR RESIDENTS TOGETHER, WHICH IS WHY OUR AREA IS CALLED THE JUNIATA VALLEY. TRANSPORTATION BARRIERS PLAY A MAJOR ROLE IN ACCESS TO HEALTH CARE IN OUR REGION. THESE NATURAL BARRIERS INCLUDE NARROW ROADS THAT EITHER MEANDER ALONG STREAMS AND CREEKS OR CROSSOVER THE MOUNTAIN RANGES THAT TRAVERSE OUR APPALACHIAN RIDGE REGION. THESE BARRIERS ARE EVEN MORE DAUNTING GIVEN HAZARDOUS WINTER DRIVING CONDITIONS CAUSED BY SNOW OR ICE COVERED ROADS. LOW-INCOME AND SENIOR CITIZENS ALSO FACE TRANSPORTATION ISSUES, AS THERE IS NO PUBLIC TRANSPORTATION IN OUR SERVICE AREA. SENIOR CITIZENS AND MEDICAID-ELIGIBLE PERSONS CAN USE THE ""CARS"" VAN SYSTEM FOR TRANSPORTATION TO REGULARLY SCHEDULED APPOINTMENTS WITH A WEEKS' NOTICE BUT NOT FOR URGENT OR EMERGENCY CARE. LOW INCOME CITIZENS HAVE NO ACCESS TO ANY PUBLIC TRANSPORTATION AT ALL IN OUR COMMUNITY. IF A TRIP TO A SPECIALIST IS REQUIRED THE MAJOR SUPPORT HOSPITALS ARE OVER ONE AND HALF HOURS DRIVE. THE POPULATION OF OUR TOTAL SERVICE AREA IS JUST ABOUT 145,000 PERSONS BASED ON 2010 US CENSUS DATA. MIFFLIN COUNTY HAS A RELATIVELY FLAT GROWTH RATE WITH A POPULATION CHANGE OF 0.4% FROM 2000 TO 2010. JUNIATA COUNTY, ON THE OTHER HAND, HAS SEEN SIGNIFICANT GROWTH WITH A 10.6% INCREASE IN POPULATION FROM 2000 TO 2010. IT IS BELIEVED THAT THIS GROWTH IS MOSTLY COMING FROM PEOPLE WHO WORK IN THE NEARBY HARRISBURG AREA WHO ARE LOOKING FOR A LOWER COST OF LIVING. WITH THE RECENT COMPLETION OF A NEW FOUR-LANE HIGHWAY NORTH OF HARRISBURG, THE COMMUTE TO HARRISBURG HAS BECOME MORE CONVENIENT RESULTING IN AN INCREASE IN JUNIATA COUNTY'S POPULATION AS PEOPLE MOVE FURTHER AWAY FROM THE URBAN AREAS TO LIVE IN THE COUNTRY. HIGHER GROWTH IN FULTON COUNTY IS EXPLAINED BY MIGRATION FROM MARYLAND AS PEOPLE TRY TO MOVE AWAY FROM HIGHER HOUSING COSTS IN MARYLAND. HUNTINGDON COUNTY'S GROWTH IS MOSTLY OCCURRING IN THE NORTHERN PORTION OF THE COUNTY THAT IS CLOSE ENOUGH TO STATE COLLEGE TO ALLOW RESIDENTS TO COMMUTE TO PENN STATE UNIVERSITY. THESE GROWTH RATES ARE STILL VERY LOW WHEN COMPARED TO A NATIONAL GROWTH RATE OF OVER 13%. OTHER IMPORTANT DEMOGRAPHIC STATISTICS ARE OUTLINED BELOW. STATISTICS: MIFFLIN COUNTY(MC), JUNIATA COUNTY(JC), PENNSYLVANIA(PA) POPULATION: 46,682(MC), 24,636(JC, 12,702,379(PA) POPULATION LESS THAN 18 YEARS OF AGE: 23.1%(MC), 24%(JC), 22%(PA) AGE 65 AND UP: 18.5%(MC), 16.8%(JC), 15.4%(PA) PERCENTAGE OF POPULATION BELOW THE POVERTY LEVEL (2010): 16.6%(MC), 11.1%(JC), 13.4% (PA) POVERTY RATE FOR CHILDREN UNDER AGE 18 (2010): 28.1%(MC), 18.0%(JC), 18.9%(PA) MEDIAN HOUSEHOLD INCOME: 37,163(MC), 45,810(JC), 49,245(PA) UNINSURED ADULTS (2010): 19.1%(MC), 18.7%(JC), 14.5%(PA) UNEMPLOYMENT RATE (2010): 9.5%(MC), 7.7%(JC), 8.4%(PA) MIFFLIN COUNTY'S 65 AND OVER AGE GROUP IS 18.5 PERCENT (2010), WHILE JUNIATA COUNTY'S IS 16.8%, HUNTINGDON COUNTY'S, 16.2% AND FULTON COUNTY'S 17.1%. THE PENNSYLVANIA AVERAGE FOR THIS STATISTIC IS 15.4%. BOTH MIFFLIN AND JUNIATA COUNTIES HAVE HIGHER PERCENTAGES OF PERSONS LESS THAN 18 YEARS OF AGE, 23.1% AND 24.0% RESPECTIVELY, THAN THE PA AVERAGE OF 22.0%. BOTH OF THESE GROUPS REQUIRE MORE HEALTH CARE RESOURCES THAN OTHER AGE GROUPS IN OUR COMMUNITY. MIFFLIN COUNTY HAS 16.6% OF THE POPULATION WITH INCOME BELOW THE POVERTY LINE AND 28.1% OF CHILDREN UNDER 18 LIVING IN POVERTY. JUNIATA COUNTY HAS 11.1% OF THE POPULATION WITH INCOME BELOW THE POVERTY LINE, WHILE HUNTINGDON AND SNYDER COUNTIES ARE 13% AND 14% RESPECTIVELY.

LAWS, REGULATIONS, CATASTROPHIC ILLNESSES AND THE RISING COSTS OF NEW TECHNOLOGY HAVE CREATED A CATEGORY OF PATIENTS WHO ARE EITHER UNINSURED OR UNDERINSURED. THIS CHARITY CARE PROGRAM HAS BEEN DEVELOPED TO HELP THE HOSPITAL MEET THE NEEDS OF THESE PATIENTS AND, CONCURRENTLY, MAINTAIN THE FINANCIAL VIABILITY OF THE HOSPITAL FOR FUTURE GENERATIONS. THIS CHARITY CARE POLICY EXPLAINS HOW THE HOSPITAL ASSISTS PATIENTS WHO CANNOT PAY FOR PART OR ALL OF THE ESSENTIAL MEDICAL CARE THEY RECEIVE. PRINCIPLES: STRONG MEMORIAL HOSPITAL PROACTIVELY CONVEYS INFORMATION ABOUT THIS CHARITY CARE POLICY TO PATIENTS AND THEIR FAMILIES. - WE BELIEVE THAT FEAR OF A HOSPITAL BILL SHOULD NEVER GET IN THE WAY OF ESSENTIAL HEALTH SERVICES.

COMMUNITY HEALTH IMPROVEMENT ADVOCACY THE UNIVERSITY OF ROCHESTER (UR) WELL STREET MEDICINE PROGRAM WAS LAUNCHED IN 2011 IN RESPONSE TO A MEDICAL STUDENT'S PROPOSAL, WHICH DREW ON HER EXPERIENCE WORKING IN STREET MEDICINE IN ANOTHER COMMUNITY. THE MISSION OF UR WELL STREET MEDICINE IS TO ENSURE ACCESS TO QUALITY MEDICAL CARE FOR ROCHESTER'S UNSHELTERED HOMELESS POPULATION, OPERATING UNDER THE PRINCIPLE THAT HEALTH CARE IS A BASIC HUMAN RIGHT. IT SEEKS TO BRIDGE GAPS BETWEEN THE HOMELESS AND MEDICAL COMMUNITIES THROUGH DIRECT STREET OUTREACH AND ENGAGEMENT WITH HOMELESS PEOPLE WHERE THEY LIVE, WHILE BUILDING RELATIONSHIPS OF TRUST AND RESPECT. OUTREACH TEAMS (EACH COMPOSED OF AN OUTREACH GUIDE, A PHYSICIAN, MEDICAL STUDENTS FROM THE SCHOOL OF MEDICINE AND DENTISTRY, AND SOCIAL WORKERS) MAKE WEEKLY VISITS TO HOMELESS SHELTERS, CAMPSITES, CITY PARKS, AND OTHER PLACES WHERE HOMELESS PEOPLE RESIDE. THESE TEAMS PROVIDE MEDICAL CARE THAT IS PATIENT-CENTERED AND HOLISTIC, INCLUDING HEALTH EDUCATION, HOUSING ASSISTANCE, SUBSTANCE ABUSE REHABILITATION, MENTAL HEALTH SERVICES, AND CASE MANAGEMENT TO MEET SPECIFIC NEEDS.

ADMINISTRATIVELY, UR MEDICAL CENTER LEADERSHIP HAS INITIATED A COMPREHENSIVE AND AMBITIOUS STRATEGIC PLANNING PROCESS ACROSS THE INSTITUTION. THE GOALS OF THE PLAN INCLUDE EXPANDING COMMUNITY HEALTH PROGRAMS AND RESEARCH THAT IMPROVE THE OVERALL HEALTH OF THE GREATER ROCHESTER COMMUNITY. THE BOARD OF DIRECTORS ENDORSE AND CHAMPION THE VISION OF THE PLAN. THE COMMUNITY ADVISORY COUNCIL (CAC) WAS CREATED IN 2006 TO REPRESENT THE VOICE OF THE COMMUNITY AND TO GUIDE AND SUPPORT THE FOUR MISSIONS OF THE URMC. THE THIRTY-SEVEN MEMBER CAC REPRESENTS EIGHTEEN COMMUNITY-BASED ORGANIZATIONS, INCLUDING HEALTH AND SOCIAL SERVICE AGENCIES, THE FAITH COMMUNITY, LOCAL GOVERNMENT, THE CITY SCHOOL DISTRICT AND MEDIA.

CURRENTLY, THE HOSPITAL IS IMPLEMENTING PROCESSES, PROCEDURES AND SYSTEMS TO MORE EFFECTIVELY DETERMINE CHARITY CARE THAT WILL REDUCE A PATIENT'S DOCUMENTATION REQUIREMENTS AND EASE THE PATIENT'S EMOTIONAL BURDEN IN APPLYING FOR CHARITY CARE. THIS WILL PROVIDE A MORE ACCURATE REPORTING OF CHARITY CARE SERVICES PROVIDED BY THE HOSPITAL."

NONETHELESS, THE MEDICARE PROGRAM, IN MANY CASES, DOES NOT PROVIDE PAYMENT THAT COVERS THE FULL COST OF THE CARE PROVIDED. SINCE IT IS THE MISSION OF THE HOSPITAL TO RESPOND TO COMMUNITY NEED, HOSPITAL MANAGEMENT CONTINUALLY ADVOCATES FOR IMPROVED MEDICARE PAYMENT SO THAT THE COST OF QUALITY CARE TO THOSE PATIENTS WHO ARE NOT ABLE TO AFFORD IT IS NOT COMPROMISED AND IS FAIRLY SUBSIDIZED BY ALL PAYERS. WHILE THIS SHORTFALL IN MEDICARE PAYMENTS IS NOT CLASSIFIED AS COMMUNITY BENEFIT BY THE IRS, WE NONETHELESS BELIEVE IT IS AN IMPORTANT CONTRIBUTION MADE BY THE HOSPITAL TO THE HEALTH AND WELL-BEING OF THE COMMUNITY. IF THE MEDICARE PROGRAM DID NOT EXIST, MANY MEDICARE PATIENTS WOULD BE ELIGIBLE FOR CHARITY CARE OR OTHER MEANS-TESTED GOVERNMENT PROGRAMS. FURTHER, BY ABSORBING THIS PAYMENT SHORTFALL AND PROVIDING CARE BELOW COST TO THESE INDIVIDUALS, ST. JOHN'S IS RELIEVING THE BURDENS OF THE GOVERNMENT. ACCORDINGLY, THIS SHORTFALL RESTRICTS ST. JOHN'S ABILITY TO MAKE FUNDS AVAILABLE TO PROVIDE FOR CHARITY CARE AND OTHER COMMUNITY BENEFITS. THE HOSPITAL MEDICARE SHORTFALL AT COST FOR FISCAL YEAR 2014 WAS $31,098,145. MEDICARE ALLOWABLE COSTS OF CARE RELATING TO REVENUE RECEIVED FROM MEDICARE WAS CALCULATED FROM THE MOST RECENTLY FILED COST REPORT AND CALCULATED USING A COST TO CHARGE RATIO."

AS A HEALING MINISTRY OF THE CATHOLIC CHURCH AND AN AFFILIATE OF THE HOSPITAL SISTERS HEALTH SYSTEM (HSHS), ST. JOHN'S HOSPITAL IS COMMITTED TO DELIVERING HIGH QUALITY, COMPASSIONATE, AND COST-EFFECTIVE HEALTH CARE SERVICES TO ALL. THE HOSPITAL WAS FOUNDED MORE THAN 130 YEARS AGO TO BRING A HEALING PRESENCE AND IMPROVE THE HEALTH OF OUR COMMUNITY, ESPECIALLY FOR PEOPLE WHO ARE SICK, POOR, AND DISADVANTAGED. BECAUSE OF THE HOSPITAL'S PURPOSE AND TRADITION, IT IS ORGANIZED TO PROMOTE THE HEALTH OF SPRINGFIELD AND SURROUNDING AREAS. THE HOSPITAL IS GOVERNED BY A BOARD OF DIRECTORS, A MAJORITY OF WHOM RESIDE IN THE HOSPITAL'S PRIMARY SERVICE AREA AND WHO ARE NEITHER EMPLOYEES NOR CONTRACTORS OF THE HOSPITAL NOR FAMILY MEMBERS THEREOF. THE BOARD ENSURES THAT ST. JOHN'S HOSPITAL IS RESPONDING TO COMMUNITY NEED. DURING FY2012, FOR EXAMPLE, THE BOARD REVIEWED THE COMMUNITY HEALTH NEEDS ASSESSMENT AND APPROVED AN IMPLEMENTATION STRATEGY FOR ADDRESSING SELECTED NEEDS. ALSO CONSISTENT WITH ITS EXEMPT PURPOSE, ST. JOHN'S HOSPITAL HAS AN OPEN MEDICAL STAFF WITH PRIVILEGES AVAILABLE TO ALL QUALIFIED PHYSICIANS IN THE AREA. IN ADDITION, THE HOSPITAL OPERATES AN EMERGENCY DEPARTMENT THAT IS OPEN 24 HOURS TO ALL PERSONS REGARDLESS OF THEIR ABILITY TO PAY. AS A NOT-FOR-PROFIT HOSPITAL, ST. JOHN'S REINVESTS SURPLUS FUNDS INTO THE MISSION OF THE ORGANIZATION AND HEALTH OF THE COMMUNITY RATHER THAN DISTRIBUTING THEM AS PROFITS TO SHAREHOLDERS OR INDIVIDUALS. FUNDS NOT COMMITTED TO ONGOING OPERATIONS ARE GENERALLY USED TO UPGRADE FACILITIES, SECURE NEW TECHNOLOGIES, IMPROVE PATIENT CARE, CONDUCT MEDICAL EDUCATION, MEDICAL RESEARCH, AND SUPPORT INITIATIVES DESIGNED TO PROMOTE HEALTH AND ENSURE ACCESS FOR ALL. FOR EXAMPLE, ST. JOHN'S HOSPITAL IS CURRENTLY WORKING WITH ITS PARENT ORGANIZATION, HOSPITAL SISTERS HEALTH SYSTEM, TO CONTINUOUSLY ENHANCE QUALITY AND IMPROVE COORDINATION OF CARE BOTH INSIDE THE HOSPITAL AND WITH A GROWING NUMBER OF PHYSICIAN PARTNERS. SUPPORTED BY INVESTMENTS IN INFORMATION TECHNOLOGY, THIS ""CARE INTEGRATION"" STRATEGY IS DESIGNED TO BETTER COORDINATE CARE, IMPROVE HEALTH OUTCOMES, CREATE NEW EFFICIENCIES, AND HELP ENSURE THAT PATIENTS ESPECIALLY THOSE WITH CHRONIC CONDITIONS GET WELL AND STAY WELL. ST. JOHN'S HOSPITAL ALSO DEVOTES SIGNIFICANT RESOURCES TO ACCESS FOR PATIENTS WHO CANNOT AFFORD CARE, ALONG WITH OTHER COMMUNITY BENEFITS. IN FISCAL YEAR 2014, ST. JOHN'S PROVIDED MORE THAN $28.3 MILLION IN COMMUNITY BENEFIT SERVICES, INCLUDING CHARITY CARE AT COST, UNPAID COSTS OF MEDICAID AND OTHER PUBLIC PROGRAMS, AND A RANGE OF DIVERSE PROGRAMS DESIGNED TO ENHANCE ACCESS AND IMPROVE COMMUNITY HEALTH. ADDITIONALLY, DURING THIS PERIOD, ST. JOHN'S PROVIDED $7.4 MILLION (AT COST) IN UNCOMPENSATED CARE TO PATIENTS THAT DID NOT QUALIFY FOR CHARITY CARE OR PUBLIC ASSISTANCE AND MORE THAN $31 MILLION (AT COST) IN EXCESS OF MEDICARE PAYMENT FOR HEALTH CARE SERVICES. ST. JOHN'S HOSPITAL PROVIDES A RANGE OF COMMUNITY BENEFITS THAT FLOWS FROM OUR MISSION AND LONG-STANDING COMMITMENT TO OUR COMMUNITY. IN MANY CASES, THESE PROGRAMS WOULD BE UNLIKELY TO EXIST WITHOUT THE LEADERSHIP ROLE PLAYED BY ST. JOHN'S AND THEY OFTEN RELIEVE A BURDEN THAT WOULD OTHERWISE BE CARRIED BY GOVERNMENT. SEVERAL OF THESE PROGRAMS AND ACTIVITIES ARE DESIGNED TO RESPOND TO OUR FY2012 COMMUNITY HEALTH NEEDS ASSESSMENT, WHICH SURFACED THE FOLLOWING PRIORITY NEEDS FOR ATTENTION FROM THE HOSPITAL IN COLLABORATION WITH OTHER COMMUNITY ORGANIZATIONS: * LIFESTYLE (STRATEGIES FOCUS ON HEALTHY CHOICES AND BEHAVIOR CHANGE) * CARDIOVASCULAR DISEASE * METABOLIC SYNDROME FOLLOWING ARE EXAMPLES OF NEW OR ENHANCED COMMUNITY BENEFIT PROGRAMS DEVELOPED IN FY2014 IN RESPONSE TO NEEDS IDENTIFIED IN THE HOSPITAL'S FY2012 CHNA. KOHL'S GOTTA DANCE (LIFESTYLE AND METABOLIC SYNDROME) THIS PROGRAM IS IMPLEMENTED IN PARTNERSHIP WITH KOHL'S, FOUR LOCAL DANCE STUDIOS AND FAITH-BASED ORGANIZATIONS. THROUGH A SERIES OF 24 DANCE CLASSES, PARTICIPANTS LEARN, PRACTICE AND REPEAT HEALTHY LIFESTYLE BEHAVIORS. THE OVERALL GOAL OF THIS PROGRAM IS TO GET KIDS PHYSICALLY ACTIVE FOR AT LEAST 60-MINUTES PER DAY. IN ITS SECOND YEAR, WE ARE SEEING A TREMENDOUS POSITIVE IMPACT ON PARTICIPANTS' SELF-ESTEEM, COMMUNICATION SKILLS, PROBLEM SOLVING SKILLS, HEALTHY PEER INTERACTION, AND A DEVELOPMENT OF LEADERSHIP SKILLS. EAST SIDE FARMER'S MARKET (LIFESTYLE AND METABOLIC SYNDROME) THE HOSPITAL PLAYED A LEAD ROLE IN OPENING A FARMER'S MARKET IN A LOW-INCOME PART OF SPRINGFIELD WHICH HAS ALSO BEEN IDENTIFIED AS A FOOD DESERT BY THE USDA. IN COLLABORATION WITH THE SANGAMON COUNTY DEPARTMENT OF PUBLIC HEALTH, THE ESFM IS OFFERED WEEKLY IN JUNE TO SEPTEMBER. OVER THE LAST THREE SUMMERS, 3,074 FAMILIES HAVE BEEN SERVED BY THE ESFM. WIC CLIENTS, SENIOR CITIZENS, AND DISABLED PERSONS HAVE SPECIFICALLY BENEFITED FROM THE ESFM DUE TO THE MARKET BEING OFFERED ON THE SAME DAY AS WIC EDUCATION CLASSES AND THE CLOSE PROXIMITY OF PARKING TO VENDORS. FOR SENIORS AND DISABLED PERSONS IN PARTICULAR THE FARMERS HAVE CREATED A DRIVE THROUGH MODEL TO MAKE SHOPPING EASIER. WIC COOKING CLASSES (CARDIOVASCULAR DISEASE, LIFESTYLE AND METABOLIC SYNDROME) THIS PROGRAM IS ALSO IMPLEMENTED IN COLLABORATION WITH THE PUBLIC HEALTH DEPARTMENT. IT IS DESIGNED TO TEACH PARTICIPANTS HOW TO PREPARE FRESH PRODUCE AND INCORPORATE FRUITS AND VEGETABLES INTO DAILY MEALS AND SNACKS. OVER THE LAST THREE SUMMERS, 480 PARTICIPANTS HAVE BENEFITED FROM THIS PROGRAM. WHAT STARTED OUT AS AN ADULT-ONLY CLASS QUICKLY TURNED INTO A FAMILY-BASED CLASS. CHILDREN LEARN ALONGSIDE THEIR PARENTS OR GUARDIANS THE VALUE OF MEAL PLANNING, PRODUCE SELECTION, FOOD HANDLING AND PREPARATION, AND HEALTHY EATING. PARISH NURSE PROGRAM (CARDIOVASCULAR DISEASE) PARISH NURSING SCHOLARSHIPS WILL BE PROVIDED TO NURSES FROM EAST SIDE CHURCHES TO ATTEND THE PARISH NURSE PROGRAM AT ST. JOHN'S COLLEGE OF NURSING. IN RETURN, NURSES WILL PROVIDE A SET NUMBER OF HEART RELATED EVENTS IN PARTNERSHIP WITH ST. JOHN'S HOSPITAL TO THEIR CONGREGATION. THIS PROGRAM WAS ESTABLISHED TO INCREASE ACCESS TO WORKING IN UNDERSERVED, AT-RISK POPULATIONS. HEALTHCARE PROFESSIONAL EDUCATION SERIES (CARDIOVASCULAR DISEASE AND METABOLIC SYNDROME) THE GOAL OF THIS EDUCATIONAL SERIES IS TO IDENTIFY PRACTICE GAPS AND RESEARCH BEST PRACTICES AND EVIDENCE-BASED POLICY TO REDUCE THE PROGRESSION OF METABOLIC SYNDROME. EDUCATION TAKES PLACE DURING GRAND ROUNDS AND THROUGH CME EVENTS. THIS IS A COLLABORATIVE EFFORT BETWEEN ST. JOHN'S HOSPITAL, SIU SCHOOL OF MEDICINE, THE PUBLIC HEALTH DEPARTMENT, GENHKIDS COALITION, AND SPRINGFIELD CLINIC. ENROLLMENT OUTREACH AND ASSISTANCE IN FY2014, HOSPITAL SISTERS HEALTH SYSTEM (HSHS) AND OUR 13 LOCAL SYSTEMS INVESTED A CONSIDERABLE AMOUNT OF COMMUNITY BENEFIT RESOURCES TO EDUCATE THE UNINSURED ABOUT HISTORIC NEW OPPORTUNITIES TO ENROLL IN AFFORDABLE HEALTH INSURANCE COVERAGE AND TO FACILITATE THE ENROLLMENT PROCESS. BETWEEN OCTOBER 1, 2013 AND MARCH 31, 2014, STATE-BASED INSURANCE EXCHANGES BEGAN A SIX-MONTH OPEN ENROLLMENT PERIOD THAT GAVE MILLIONS OF AMERICANS ACCESS TO HEALTH INSURANCE COVERAGE. ST. JOHN'S HOSPITAL PLAYED A VITAL ROLE IN EDUCATING ELIGIBLE PEOPLE IN THEIR LOCAL COMMUNITIES, REFERRING THEM TO CERTIFIED APPLICATION COUNSELORS AND/OR IN ENROLLING THEM IN THE HEALTH INSURANCE EXCHANGES OR IN SECURING COVERAGE THROUGH MEDICAID EXPANSION. MEDICAID EXPANSION IS A KEY PART OF THE REFORM LAW'S STRATEGY TO PROVIDE HEALTH COVERAGE FOR MANY OF THE NATION'S UNINSURED. OF THE EIGHT STATES WITH THE HIGHEST CONCENTRATION OF UNINSURED, ILLINOIS WAS AMONG 25 STATES THAT MOVED TOWARD MEDICAID EXPANSION UNDER THE AFFORDABLE CARE ACT. ST. JOHN'S HOSPITAL'S ENROLLMENT OUTREACH AND ASSISTANCE INCLUDED EDUCATIONAL FLYERS, BOOKMARKS, POSTERS; EDUCATIONAL MATERIALS FOR SWITCHBOARD AND REGISTRATION COLLEAGUES; AND ONGOING EMAIL UPDATES AND EDUCATION TO KEY HOSPITAL COLLEAGUES. ST. JOHN'S WAS AN ACTIVE MEMBER OF THE SANGAMON COUNTY HEALTH EXCHANGE COALITION; PARTNERED WITH THE SANGAMON COUNTY DEPARTMENT OF HEALTH AND LOCAL COMMUNITY COLLEGE TO HOST ENROLLMENT EVENTS; AND HOSTED ONSITE MIDNIGHT ENROLLMENT EVENTS ON THE LAST TWO DAYS OF OPEN ENROLLMENT TO INCREASE ACCESS AND ENCOURAGE ENROLLMENT."

THE MISSION OF HSHS IS ""TO REVEAL AND EMBODY CHRIST'S HEALING LOVE FOR ALL PEOPLE THROUGH OUR HIGH QUALITY FRANCISCAN HEALTH CARE MINISTRY."" WE LIVE OUR MISSION BY PROVIDING HOLISTIC HEALING TO ALL WHO SEEK OUR CARE, AS WELL AS THROUGH COMMUNITY BENEFIT. WORKING COLLABORATIVELY WITH OTHERS IN THE COMMUNITIES WE SERVE, OUR COMMUNITY BENEFIT INITIATIVES ARE STRATEGICALLY AND SUCCESSFULLY EXPANDING ACCESS TO CARE, IMPROVING THE HEALTH STATUS OF RESIDENTS, AND FURTHERING MEDICAL EDUCATION AND KNOWLEDGE. IN FY2014, OUR 13 HOSPITALS RESPONDED TO NEEDS IDENTIFIED IN EACH OF THEIR COMMUNITY HEALTH NEEDS ASSESSMENTS (CHNAS) COMPLETED IN FY2012. THE INFORMATION GATHERED FROM THESE ASSESSMENTS WAS USED TO DEVELOP NEW AND ENHANCE EXISTING COMMUNITY BENEFIT PROGRAMS AND SERVICES THAT BEST ADDRESSED COMMUNITY NEEDS. INCLUDED AMONG THE MANY PRIORITY NEEDS IDENTIFIED IN OUR CHNAS WERE CHRONIC DISEASE PREVENTION AND MANAGEMENT, OBESITY, ADEQUATE FOOD AND NUTRITION, MENTAL HEALTH, AND ACCESS TO HEALTH CARE SERVICES. HSHS HOSPITALS ARE PROACTIVELY ADDRESSING THESE AND OTHER NEEDS THROUGH PATIENT, PROVIDER AND COMMUNITY EDUCATION, PREVENTATIVE SCREENINGS, SELF-MANAGEMENT CLASSES, AND NEW OR ENHANCED CLINICAL SERVICES. ACROSS HSHS, WE COLLECTIVELY PROVIDED $174.0 MILLION IN COMMUNITY BENEFIT (OR 9.3% OF TOTAL HOSPITAL EXPENSES) IN FY2014. INCLUDED IN THIS AMOUNT WAS $39.9 MILLION PROVIDED FOR FINANCIAL ASSISTANCE (I.E. CHARITY CARE) AND $95.8 MILLION FOR UNREIMBURSED CARE PROVIDED UNDER THE MEDICAID PROGRAM. IN ADDITION, HSHS HOSPITALS COMMITTED SIGNIFICANT RESOURCES TO CARE FOR MEDICARE PATIENTS. THE COST OF PROVIDING SERVICES TO PRIMARILY ELDERLY BENEFICIARIES OF THE MEDICARE PROGRAM - IN EXCESS OF GOVERNMENTAL AND MANAGED CARE CONTRACT PAYMENTS - WAS $175.2 MILLION. HSHS HOSPITALS ALSO RECORDED $94.2 MILLION IN UNCOLLECTIBLE ACCOUNTS. WHILE THE LATTER TWO AMOUNTS ARE NOT COUNTED AS COMMUNITY BENEFIT, THEY NONETHELESS REFLECT OUR COMMITMENT TO ALL PERSONS IN NEED OF CARE. IN ADDITION TO THE DOLLARS INVESTED IN OUR COMMUNITY BENEFIT PROGRAMS, HSHS ALSO CONTINUES TO REINVEST ANY SURPLUS REVENUE FROM OPERATIONS AND INVESTMENTS INTO NEW MEDICAL TECHNOLOGY, FACILITY INFRASTRUCTURE AND HEALTH CARE SERVICES IN OUR COMMUNITIES. BY DOING SO, WE ENSURE WE ARE ABLE TO MEET THE ONGOING DEMAND FOR HIGH QUALITY, EFFICIENT AND EASILY ACCESSIBLE HEALTH CARE. RECOGNIZING THAT THE HEALTH CARE DELIVERY MODEL IN THE UNITED STATES IS EVOLVING, HSHS REMAINS FOCUSED ON IMPLEMENTING OUR CARE INTEGRATION STRATEGY. CARE INTEGRATION COORDINATES THE DELIVERY OF CARE AROUND THE NEEDS OF EACH PATIENT. DURING FY2014, WE MADE SIGNIFICANT PROGRESS WITH THIS STRATEGY AS WE FURTHER IMPLEMENTED INTEROPERABLE HEALTH INFORMATION TECHNOLOGIES, EXPANDED THE NUMBER OF MEDICAL HOMES, AND STRENGTHENED OUR ALIGNMENT WITH PHYSICIANS. GREATER ACCESS TO CARE AS A FRANCISCAN HEALTH CARE MINISTRY, HSHS IS DEEPLY COMMITTED TO SERVING THOSE WHO ARE MOST IN NEED. WE NOT ONLY PROVIDE CARE TO EVERY PATIENT WHO WALKS THROUGH OUR DOORS, BUT ALSO REACH OUT BEYOND THE WALLS OF OUR HOSPITALS AND CLINICS TO CARE FOR THOSE IN OUR COMMUNITIES. OUR EFFORTS TO ENSURE RESIDENTS IN THE COMMUNITIES WE SERVE RECEIVE THE RIGHT CARE AT THE RIGHT TIME IN THE RIGHT SETTING OFTEN INVOLVE PARTNERING WITH OTHERS TO ACHIEVE THIS GOAL. ACROSS OUR TWO-STATE SYSTEM, THERE ARE NUMEROUS EXAMPLES OF HSHS COLLABORATING WITH OTHER ORGANIZATIONS TO ENHANCE ACCESS TO CARE FOR THOSE IN NEED. IN FY2014, HSHS AND OUR 13 HOSPITALS INVESTED A CONSIDERABLE AMOUNT OF COMMUNITY BENEFIT RESOURCES TO EDUCATE THE UNINSURED ABOUT HISTORIC NEW OPPORTUNITIES TO ENROLL IN AFFORDABLE HEALTH CARE COVERAGE AND TO FACILITATE THE ENROLLMENT PROCESS. STUDIES HAVE SHOWN THAT PEOPLE WITHOUT INSURANCE COVERAGE ARE MORE LIKELY THAN THEIR INSURED COUNTERPARTS TO POSTPONE CARE AND TO DEVELOP MORE SEVERE AND EXPENSIVE CONDITIONS. IT IS FOR THIS REASON THAT THE CATHOLIC CHURCH, CATHOLIC HEALTH CARE AND HSHS HAVE LONG PROMOTED ""COVERAGE AND ACCESS FOR ALL."" HSHS AND OUR 13 HOSPITALS IN PARTNERSHIP WITH LOCAL HEALTH DEPARTMENTS, SOCIAL SERVICE AGENCIES AND OTHER HEALTH CARE PROVIDERS PLAYED A VITAL ROLE IN EDUCATING ELIGIBLE PEOPLE IN THEIR LOCAL COMMUNITIES, IN REFERRING PEOPLE TO CERTIFIED APPLICATION COUNSELORS AND/OR IN ENROLLING THEM IN THE HEALTH INSURANCE EXCHANGES OR IN SECURING COVERAGE THROUGH MEDICAID EXPANSION. OF THE EIGHT STATES WITH THE HIGHEST CONCENTRATION OF UNINSURED, ILLINOIS WAS AMONG 25 STATES THAT MOVED TOWARD MEDICAID EXPANSION UNDER THE AFFORDABLE CARE ACT. WITH THE SUPPORT OF ST. MARY'S HOSPITAL MEDICAL CENTER AND ST. VINCENT HOSPITAL IN GREEN BAY, WISCONSIN, THE NEW COMMUNITY CLINIC DENTAL PROGRAM ON THE CAMPUS OF NORTHEAST WISCONSIN (NEW) TECHNICAL COLLEGE WAS ABLE TO PURCHASE EQUIPMENT TO ENABLE LOCAL ORAL SURGEONS TO PROVIDE CARE (ON A VOLUNTEER BASIS) AT THE CLINIC - THE SITE THAT ST. MARY'S AND ST. VINCENT HOSPITALS HELPED TO ESTABLISH IN 2013. ANNUALLY, THE CLINIC PROVIDES DENTAL SERVICES TO APPROXIMATELY 6,000 LOW-INCOME AND UNINSURED PERSONS INCLUDING THE HOMELESS IN BROWN COUNTY. ST. FRANCIS HOSPITAL IN LITCHFIELD, ILLINOIS PARTNERED WITH LEWIS & CLARK COMMUNITY COLLEGE AND LOCAL DENTAL PROVIDERS TO BRING THE COLLEGE'S MOBILE DENTAL HEALTH UNIT TO THE LITCHFIELD AREA; THE UNIT PROVIDES EXAMS AND SCREENINGS, X-RAYS AND HYGIENE TO THOSE IN NEED. IN WESTERN WISCONSIN, A PARTNERSHIP BETWEEN ST. JOSEPH'S HOSPITAL IN CHIPPEWA FALLS, THE CHIPPEWA HEALTH IMPROVEMENT PARTNERSHIP (CHIP), LE PHILLIPS-LIBERTAS TREATMENT CENTER AND THE OPEN DOOR CLINIC (A FREE CLINIC SUPPORTED BY ST. JOSEPH'S HOSPITAL AND CHIP) WAS DEVELOPED IN FY2014 TO PROVIDE FREE BEHAVIORAL HEALTH SERVICES TO ELIGIBLE PATIENTS OF THE OPEN DOOR CLINIC. THIS INITIATIVE IS IN DIRECT RESPONSE TO THE IDENTIFIED NEED TO PROVIDE BETTER ACCESS TO MENTAL HEALTH SERVICES FOR THOSE WITHOUT INSURANCE COVERAGE. IN FY2014, 105 REFERRALS WERE MADE FROM THE OPEN DOOR CLINIC TO LE PHILLIPS-LIBERTAS TREATMENT CENTER. IN TOTAL, 950 VISITS WERE PROVIDED TO REFERRED PATIENTS INCLUDING INITIAL INTAKE AND FOLLOW UP THERAPY SESSIONS - MENTAL HEALTH SERVICES THAT WOULD NOT HAVE BEEN RECEIVED HAD THE PROGRAM NOT BEEN DEVELOPED AND IMPLEMENTED. IN SOUTHEAST ILLINOIS, AREA RESIDENTS CAN GET HELP FILLING A PRESCRIPTION THROUGH THE LONG-TERM COLLABORATION BETWEEN ST. ANTHONY'S MEMORIAL HOSPITAL IN EFFINGHAM AND CATHOLIC CHARITIES. IN FY2014, ST. ANTHONY'S HELPED UNDERWRITE THE COST OF PRESCRIPTION MEDICATIONS FOR 311 RESIDENTS, A 10% INCREASE OVER FY2013. ST. ANTHONY'S AND CATHOLIC CHARITIES BELIEVE THAT NO ONE SHOULD BE WITHOUT PRESCRIBED MEDICATIONS BECAUSE OF INABILITY TO PAY. IN SOUTHWEST ILLINOIS, ST. JOSEPH'S HOSPITAL IN HIGHLAND ENHANCED THEIR OFFERINGS TO THEIR SENIOR POPULATION BASED ON THEIR CHNA. ""SENIOR RENEWAL"" IS AN OUTPATIENT COUNSELING PROGRAM FOR SENIOR ADULTS WHO MAY BE FACING EMOTIONAL AND PHYSICAL PROBLEMS UNIQUE TO THE AGING PROCESS SUCH AS FEELINGS OF LONELINESS, ISOLATION AND ANXIETY. CLIENTS RECEIVE AN INTENSIVE LEVEL OF TREATMENT WITHOUT INPATIENT HOSPITALIZATION THROUGH COUNSELING STRATEGIES AND EDUCATION. IN ADDITION, ST. JOSEPH'S HOSPITAL IN COLLABORATION WITH THE ILLINOIS DEPARTMENT OF INSURANCE PARTICIPATES IN THE SENIOR HEALTH INSURANCE PROGRAM (SHIP), A FREE HEALTH INSURANCE COUNSELING SERVICE FOR MEDICARE BENEFICIARIES AND THEIR CAREGIVERS. IN ADDITION TO PROGRAMS DESIGNED TO INCREASE ACCESS TO CARE, HSHS MAKES SURE THAT THOSE WHO NEED FINANCIAL ASSISTANCE RECEIVE IT. HSHS'S FINANCIAL ASSISTANCE (CHARITY CARE) POLICY WAS MODIFIED EFFECTIVE JANUARY 1, 2014 TO OFFER A 25% SELF-PAY DISCOUNT TO ALL PATIENTS WHO REGISTER WITHOUT INSURANCE. HSHS FINANCIAL ASSISTANCE PROGRAMS HAVE A SLIDING SCALE, IN SOME INSTANCES PROVIDING UP TO A 55% REDUCTION OFF BILLED CHARGES IF AN UNINSURED PATIENT'S FAMILY INCOME LEVEL IS DETERMINED TO BE ABOVE 500% BUT EQUAL TO OUR LESS THAN 600% OF THE CURRENT FEDERAL POVERTY GUIDELINES. ALL CHARGES ARE WAIVED FOR PATIENTS BELOW 200% OF THE FEDERAL POVERTY LEVELS. COUNSELORS ARE AVAILABLE IN OUR HOSPITALS TO EXPLAIN OUR FINANCIAL ASSISTANCE POLICY TO PATIENTS, PROVIDE THEM WITH ASSISTANCE IN FILLING OUT A SIMPLE APPLICATION FORM, OR HELP THEM ENROLL IN PUBLICLY FUNDED HEALTH CARE PROGRAMS."

BY DOING SO, WE MAXIMIZE OUR EFFORTS AND REDUCE THE DUPLICATION OF SERVICES. HSHS HOSPITALS ALSO UNDERSTAND WE NEED TO LISTEN CLOSELY TO THE RESIDENTS OF THE COMMUNITIES WE SERVE TO ENSURE THE HEALTH CARE NEEDS OF ALL ARE BEING MET. TO THAT END, EACH OF OUR 13 HOSPITALS COMPLETED COMMUNITY HEALTH NEEDS ASSESSMENTS (CHNA) DURING FY2012. THE INFORMATION GATHERED FROM THESE ASSESSMENTS IS BEING USED TO HELP US DEVELOP NEW, AND ENHANCE EXISTING, PROGRAMS AND SERVICES THAT BEST ADDRESS THE NEEDS OF THE COMMUNITY. SEVERAL PRIORITY NEEDS WERE IDENTIFIED IN THE CHNAS INCLUDING METABOLIC AND CARDIOVASCULAR DISEASE MANAGEMENT, ADEQUATE FOOD AND NUTRITION, AND MENTAL HEALTH. HSHS HOSPITALS ARE ADDRESSING THESE AND OTHER NEEDS BY PROACTIVELY OFFERING EDUCATIONAL OPPORTUNITIES, PREVENTATIVE SCREENINGS, AND NEW OR ENHANCED CLINICAL SERVICES. IN MANY CASES, THE HOSPITALS COLLABORATE WITH OTHER COMMUNITY ORGANIZATIONS TO ADDRESS IDENTIFIED NEEDS. IN PARTNERSHIP WITH THE SANGAMON COUNTY HEALTH DEPARTMENT AND LOCAL FARMERS, ST. JOHN'S HOSPITAL IN SPRINGFIELD, ILLINOIS TOOK A LEAD ROLE IN BRINGING A FARMERS MARKET TO THE EAST SIDE OF SPRINGFIELD. THE EAST SIDE FARMERS MARKET (ESFM) ADDRESSES THREE COMMUNITY NEEDS: CHILDHOOD OBESITY, CHILDHOOD POVERTY (26% OF CHILDREN IN SANGAMON COUNTY LIVE IN POVERTY VS. 18% IN THE STATE) AND PROVIDING FRESH PRODUCE TO PERSONS LIVING IN A KNOWN ""FOOD DESERT."" OVER THE LAST THREE SUMMERS (JUNE - OCTOBER), ESFM HAS SERVED 3,074 FAMILIES. WIC CLIENTS, SENIOR CITIZENS AND DISABLED PERSONS HAVE ESPECIALLY BENEFITTED DUE TO ESFM BEING OFFERED ON THE SAME DAY AS WIC EDUCATION CLASSES, AND THE CLOSE PROXIMITY OF PARKING TO VENDORS. IN ADDITION, THE FARMERS CREATED A ""DRIVE THROUGH"" TO MAKE SHOPPING EASIER FOR SENIORS AND DISABLED PERSONS. ST.

201522249349301227,060646597,"Part III, Line 3 - Methodology of Estimated Amount & Rationale for Including in Community Benefit","It is the policy of the Hospital to provide necessary care to all persons seeking treatment without discrimination on the grounds of age, race, creed, national origin or any other grounds unrelated to an individual's need for the service or the availability of the needed service at the Hospital. A patient is classified as a charity care patient by reference to established policies of the Hospital. Essentially, these policies define charity services as those services for which no payment is anticipated. In assessing a patient's inability to pay, the Hospital utilizes the generally recognized federal poverty income guidelines, but also includes certain cases where incurred charges are significant when compared to a responsible party's income and their countable assets. Those charges are not included in net patient service revenue for financial reporting purposes. Because the hospital is not paid for these services, they are considered to be community benefit.When private pay patients are sent to the collection agency their account is considered to be a bad debt. Subsequently, Medicaid may be granted for some of those patients. At that time those accounts would become charity care or a community benefit."
201522249349301227,060646597,"Part III, Line 4 - Bad Debt Expense","The Hospitals estimation of the allowance for uncollectible accounts is based primarily upon the type and age of the patient accounts receivable and the effectiveness of the Hospitals collection efforts. The Hospitals policy is to reserve a portion of all self-pay receivables, including amounts due from the uninsured and amounts related to co-payments and deductibles, as these charges are recorded. On a monthly basis, the Hospital reviews its accounts receivable balances and various analytics to support the basis for its estimates. These efforts primarily consist of reviewing the following: Historical write-off and collection experience using a hindsight or look-back approach; Revenue and volume trends by payor, particularly the self-pay components; Changes in the aging and payor mix of accounts receivable, including increased focus on accounts due from the uninsured and accounts that represent co-payments and deductibles due from patients; Cash collections as a percentage of net patient revenue less the provision for bad debt; and Trending of days revenue in accounts receivable The amount of the allowance for uncollectible accounts is based upon managment's assessment of historical and expected net collections, business and economic conditions, trends in Medicare and Medicaid health care coverage, and other collection indicators.The Hospital regularly performs hindsight procedures to evaluate historical write-off and collection experience throughout the year to assist in determining the reasonableness of its process for estimating the allowance for uncollectible accounts. The Hospitals primary concentration of credit risk is patient accounts receivable, which consists of amounts owed by various governmental agencies, insurance companies and private patients. The Hospital manages the receivables by regularly reviewing its patient accounts and contracts, and by providing appropriate allowances for uncollectible amounts. Significant concentrations of gross patient accounts receivable include 35% and 14%, and 32% and 13%, for Medicare and Medicaid, respectively, at September 30, 2014 and 2013, respectively."

As a result, the organization must balance the cost of these programs against the continued decreasing government reimbursement levels, uninsured population and community needs.A cost accounting system is used to calculate the shortfall, which is Medicare Net Patient Revenue less applicable costs."

A Steering Committee comprised of health care providers, community-based providers, and local government agencies met quarterly to oversee a community health improvement plan (CHIP) that was developed utilizing data from a report card and previous community conversations that focused on four priority health indicators (PHI). Each indicator has objectives, strategies and work groups that carry out these objectives: The four PHI workgroups have designated a leader and met at least quarterly to further develop and refine their action plans. During April 2014 the Center for Health Schools & Communities @ Education Connection facilitated a Community Forum to provide a feedback loop to community stakeholders. Overall, data obtained from the Conversations provided high quality information to frame the beginning of a community health improvement change process in the region.1. Prevention and Education of Most Prevalent Chronic Diseases/Health Conditions: Obesity, Type 2 diabetes, and hypertension were identified as the most prevalent health conditions in the community. The PHI team goals are to increase healthy eating options, enhance access to physical activities, and promote a universal healthy lifestyle. In July 2014, the PHI team received the YMCA Diabetes Prevention Program Grant which was used to fund their diabetes prevention program. The team also participated in National Walk Day, which garnered over 150 people from the Housatonic Valley Region and formation of 3 community walking groups. A wellness campaign building on the 5, 2, 1, 0 Lets Go messaging and collaboration with health providers, schools andbusinesses is being developed.2. Improving Access/Utilization to Substance Abuse and Mental Health Services: Mental health issues and substance abuse continue to be prevalent issues in the community. This PHI team is collaborating with 12 Local Prevention Councils, the CT Prevention Framework, and other entities to increase outreach efforts. Their goals are to identify gaps in services and access, provide education, and increase awareness regarding services and programs. There is awareness to vulnerable target groups in need of enhanced services and supports, such as the homeless population and youth. The team worked to improve education and information dissemination, and supported integration of a question-persuade-refer model for suicide prevention.3. Improve Assessment and Service Planning to Senior Health: Senior citizens, particularly homebound elderly and immigrants, are in need of assessment and service planning to address their health, housing, and social support needs. The main goal is to increase awareness, services, and education for senior health. This team is supporting and collaborating with the Aging in Place initiatives funded by the Peter and Carmen Lucia Buck Foundation, which includes the Safe at Home program that delivers home safety items to seniors.4. Improve Awareness and Utilization of Existing Health and Social Programs/Services: This team focused on enhancing awareness and utilization of existing programs and services in the community, including support of Infoline 2-1-1 and 5 Health Access CT Assistor sites by target populations. It also established a partnership with FamilyWize to provide promotional materials for distribution to health providers and key community sites.

201531359349301848,310538525,PART VI,"NEEDS ASSESSMENT As a first step towards understanding the health needs of our community, TCH has formed a community benefit and social accountability committee, consisting of a variety of internal and external stakeholders, to write the community benefit policy and to preside over key community benefit decisions. This committee is responsible for determining the health needs of the community TCH serves and implement proven programs and strategies that target those identified needs. They do this by analyzing a number of data sources including public health data, hospitalization data, health risk factor surveys, socioeconomic needs assessments, environmental standards and existing programs that had been developed for residents in their service area. The essential components examined in this process include the data indicators compiled on TCH's online community health dashboard of over 100 economical, environmental and health categories; the A.I.M. (Ask. Inform. Make a difference.) community health needs assessment; the Hamilton County public health department's community health assessment for Hamilton County; the Greater Cincinnati Community Health Status Survey and the United Way of Greater Cincinnati's Bold Goals. This community benefit data includes both qualitative and quantitative data; demographics including race, age, ethnicity and gender; socioeconomic data including income, education and health insurance rates; primary care and chronic disease needs of uninsured persons; and data on health disparities in health outcomes among minority groups. Key findings are reviewed to further identify gaps in existing community outreach and hospital based services. PATIENT EDUCATION OF ELIGIBILITY AND ASSISTANCE TCH posts its charity care policy and financial assistance contact information in admissions areas, emergency department, and other areas of the organization's facilities in which eligible patients are likely to be present. TCH provides a copy of the policy, or summary thereof, and financial assistance contact information to patients as part of the intake process and with discharge materials. Additionally, a copy of the policy or a summary along with the financial assistance contact information is included in the patient bills. TCH discusses with the patient the availability of various government benefits, such as Medicaid or state programs, where applicable. Additionally, TCH assists patients in obtaining medical benefits through federal, state, and hospital programs. TCH representatives will provide the following services at no cost to the patient: - explore eligibility, - file application on patient's behalf, - schedule and attend appointments, - provide transportation when necessary, - provide medical documentation to social security administration for disability claims. Throughout the registration and discharge process, patients and their counselors look at what options are available. TCH understands that not everyone can pay for healthcare services. TCH representatives are available to offer options and assistance for those who are uninsured or underinsured. COMMUNITY INFORMATION TCH's primary service area, comprised of 80.0% of the inpatient admissions, encompasses ten (10) counties in the Greater Cincinnati area including, Hamilton, Brown, Adams, Clermont, Butler and Warren counties in Ohio and Campbell, Kenton and Brown County in Kentucky. TCH's secondary service area, comprised of an additional 20.0% of the inpatient admissions, encompasses an additional four (4) counties including Adams, Clinton and Highland counties in Ohio; Pendleton and Grant counties in Kentucky. TCH's service area largely serves Hamilton County, which has a population of approximately 815,400 with 14.2% of the population over the age of 65. Hamilton County population includes 13.6% of the population living at less than 100.0% of the federal poverty line. Approximately 68.9% of the Hamilton County population is Caucasian and 25.1% is African American; 2.1% of the population is Asian, and the remaining 4.0% is of other ethnicity. Within Hamilton County, 52.9% of the households have an average income level of less than $50,000; 27.8% of the average household income levels are $50,000 and $100,000; and 19.3% of the average household income levels are greater than $100,000. PROMOTION OF COMMUNITY HEALTH TCH operates an emergency room open to all persons regardless of ability to pay. In addition to providing emergency services, a systematic approach is used to determine community health needs with input from organizations such as the Center for Closing the Health Gap, the TCH Family Advisory Council, and the Gathering of Community Health Statistics by the KSI Clinical Services Portfolio Team and by the marketing department. Information gathered through these sources has led to the deployment of the palliative care program, a center for health and aging to address the special needs of geriatric patients and a newly remodeled behavioral health unit at a time when other healthcare providers in the community were discontinuing that service. TCH also supports the community in numerous fund drives such as United Way, American Heart Association, diabetes walk, cancer walk and fine arts fund. At the beginning of each school year and at Christmas, TCH staff also donates school supplies and gifts to the students at Taft Elementary School located in Mt. Auburn. In addition, the staff provides mentoring opportunities to undergraduate and graduate student interns interested in healthcare careers and also to explorer scouts.

In evaluating the collectibility of accounts receivable, the Association analyzes its past history and identifies trends for each of its major payer sources of revenue to estimate the appropriate allowance for doubtful accounts and provision for uncollectible accounts. Management regularly reviews data about these major payer sources of revenue in evaluating the sufficiency of the allowance for doubtful accounts. For receivables associated with services provided to patients who have third-party coverage, the Association analyzes contractually due amounts and provides an allowance for doubtful accounts and a provision for uncollectible accounts, if necessary (for example, for expected uncollectible deductibles and copayments on accounts for which the third-party payer has not yet paid, or for payers who are known to be having financial difficulties that make the realization of amounts due unlikely). For receivables associated with self-pay patients (which includes both patients without insurance and patients with deductible and copayment balances due for which third-party coverage exists for part of the bill), the Association records a significant provision for uncollectible accounts in the period of service on the basis of its past experience, which indicates that many patients are unable or unwilling to pay the portion of their bill for which they are financially responsible. The difference between the standard rates (or the discounted rates if negotiated or provided by policy) and the amounts actually collected after all reasonable collection efforts have been exhausted is charged off against the allowance for doubtful accounts.
