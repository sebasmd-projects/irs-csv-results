201531039349300443,590624458,"Part III, Line 8:","The source of this information is the Medicare Cost Report data, which uses a ""cost to charge"" ratio methodology. The University of Miami Hospital and Anne Bates Leach Eye Hospital are reimbursed under the Medicare Prospective Payment System (PPS). For inpatient services, the reimbursement methodology is the Inpatient Prospective Payment System (IPPS), which uses the Diagnostic Related Groups (DRGS) methodology to reimburse the hospital. The DRG amounts are updated by the Medicare program annually by an updating factor. However, the amount of the updating factor is always significantly less than the actual healthcare inflation factor because the Medicare program includes a ""budget neutrality"" factor for the overall Medicare program. Thus, the hospital does not receive full reimbursement of its cost for inpatient services. For outpatient services, the reimbursement methodology is the Outpatient Prospective Payment System (OPPS), which uses ambulatory payment classifications (APCS) to reimburse the hospital. The APC amounts are updated by the Medicare program annually by an updating factor. However, the amount of the updating factor is always significantly less than the actual healthcare inflation factor because the Medicare program includes a ""budget neutrality"" factor for the overall Medicare program. Thus, the hospital does not receive full reimbursement for its cost for outpatient services. The University of Miami Hospital and Clinics is a cancer specialty hospital and, as such, is cost based reimbursed for both inpatient and outpatient services. For inpatient services, the limit is the TEFRA target limit. The hospital, on occasion, exceeds the target rate and does not receive full cost reimbursement. The TEFRA target amount is updated by the Medicare program annually by the TEFRA updating factor. However, the amount of the TEFRA updating factor is always significantly less than the actual healthcare inflation factor because the Medicare program includes a ""budget neutrality"" factor for the overall Medicare program. For outpatient services, the limit is the payment to cost ratio (PCR). The PCR was established using a base year, which was 1996, at a rate of 85.5% of cost. The PCR for all exempt cancer centers was 91% through 12/31/13, and then 89% from 1/1/14 to 5/31/14; therefore, the hospital currently does not receive payment for a range of 9% to 11% of its outpatient cost."

The provision for doubtful accounts and the allowance for doubtful accounts relate primarily to amounts due directly from patients. Management relies on the results of detailed reviews of historical write-offs and recoveries as a primary source of information to utilize in estimating the collectability of the Company's accounts receivable. The results of the detailed reviews of historical write-offs and recoveries, adjusted for changes in trends and conditions, are used to estimate the allowance for doubtful accounts for the current period. Adverse changes in general economic conditions, business office operations, payor mix, or tends in federal or state governmental health care coverage could affect the Company's collection of accounts receivable, cash flows, and results of operations."

Collection of outstanding receivables from third-party payors (Medicare, managed care payers, etc.) is the Hospitals' primary source of cash and is critical to our ability to fund operations. The primary collection risks relate to uninsured patient accounts, including patient accounts for which the primary insurance carrier has paid the amounts covered by the applicable agreement, but patient responsibility amounts (deductibles and copayments) remain outstanding. The provision for doubtful accounts and the allowance for doubtful accounts relate primarily to amounts due directly from patients. An estimated allowance for doubtful accounts is recorded for all uninsured accounts, regardless of the aging of those accounts. Accounts are written off when all reasonable internal and external collections efforts have been performed. Our collection policies include a review of all accounts against certain standard collection criteria, upon completion of our internal collection efforts. Accounts determined to possess positive collectability attributes are forwarded to a secondary external collections agency and the other accounts are written off. The accounts that are not collected by the secondary external collection agency are written off when they are returned to us by the collection agency (usually within 12 months). Write-offs are based upon specific identification and the write-off process requires a write-off adjustment entry to the patient accounting system. We do not pursue collection of amounts related to patients that meet our guidelines to qualify as charity care. The methodology to determine the bad debt expense reported at cost on Part III, Line 2 is to take the ratio of patient care costs to gross patient charges and multiply this resulting ratio by the gross charges for bad debt accounts."

The Hospital advises prospective patients during the registration process as to potential eligibility for participation in the Medicaid program. Those for whom participation seems possible are referred to a contractor, RCA, to complete the appropriate applications and procedures. The Hospital has an ""uncompensated care"" policy. It is communicated to patients and interested persons as follows: General Communication with the Public As part of the effort to notify the public concerning uncompensated services provided, TUHC will publish, in a generally circulated local newspaper, a notice describing TUHC's uncompensated care policy. The notice will outline the level of uncompensated services to be provided and the services which are considered eligible under the uncompensated care policy. This notice will invite public comment from interested parties. This notice will be published prior to modification of the policy and termination of the policy. Communication of the Policy to Individuals Seeking Services at TUHC TUHC will provide a descriptive notice of the uncompensated care policy to any individual inquiring about the provision of uncompensated services (Attachment A). The notice will include information relative to the uncompensated services provided, eligibility requirements, and the determination process. The notice will identify a location within the hospital at which additional information can be requested. The notice will be provided at all times that uncompensated services are available. Notices highlighting the provision of uncompensated care will be posted prominently in the admissions area, the business office, and the emergency room (Attachment B). These notices will be provided in English and Spanish. The hospital will make a reasonable effort to communicate the meaning of the notices to individuals who may not be able to read or understand them. In the event that uncompensated care services are not being provided due to exceeding uncompensated care thresholds, all notification and signage related to the provision of uncompensated care will be removed until such time as uncompensated care services are once again provided."

Sixty percent of all admissions originated from the Emergency Department which evidenced access for all groups within community (especially the downtown area). Tulane runs a children's hospital within a hospital as well as a pediatric emergency department (one of two in the city) to accommodate the needs of the community's children. Tulane is collaborating with the only freestanding Children's hospital in the State in offering pediatric cardiology services. The hospital also has a contract with the Veteran's Administration to provide a variety of inpatient and outpatient services.

THE MAJORITY OF THE HOSPITALS' SERVICES ARE RENDERED TO PATIENTS WITH COMMERCIAL OR MANAGED CARE INSURANCE, OR UNDER THE FEDERAL MEDICARE AND CALIFORNIA STATE MEDI-CAL PROGRAMS. REIMBURSEMENT FROM THESE VARIOUS PAYERS IS BASED ON A COMBINATION OF PROSPECTIVELY DETERMINED RATES, DISCOUNTS FROM CHARGES AND HISTORICAL COSTS. Amounts received under the Medicare program are subject to retroactive settlements based on review and final determination by program intermediaries or their agents. Provisions for contractual adjustments and retroactive settlements related to these payers are accrued on an estimated basis in the period the related services are rendered and adjusted in future periods as additional information becomes known or as final settlements are determined. The allowance for doubtful accounts is based upon management's assessment of historical and expected net collections considering historical business and economic conditions, trends in health care coverage, and other collection indicators. Periodically throughout the year management assesses the adequacy of the allowance for doubtful accounts based upon historical write-off experience by payor category. The results of this review are then used to make any modifications to the allowance for doubtful accounts. The determination of charity care generally should be made at the time of admission, or shortly thereafter. However, events after discharge may change the ability of the patient to pay. Designation as Charity Care will only be considered after all payment sources have been exhausted. Hospital charges for patient accounts identified as Charity Care at the time of admission or service are not recognized by the facility as net revenues or net receivables. If patient accounts are identified as Charity Care subsequent to the facility recognizing the charges as revenue, an adjustment is required to classify appropriately the revenue and any bad debt expense previously recorded.

The Rockefeller University Hospital is a very unique institution. As an institution solely committed to conducting clinical research our community/service area is defined as the New York Metropolitan Area. The Rockefeller University Hospital has provided an array of clinical research and patient care services since its founding in 1910. The Rockefeller University Hospital community served/service area is determined based on research being conducted. Principal Investigators identify an area of interest and submit a protocol for review and approval by our institutional review board. If and when the protocol is approved, our recruitment office works with the investigator to develop and submit advertisements in local newspapers, magazines and online. Identification of lucrative places to advertise is determined by current trends in readership among local newspapers, magazines and visits to particular websites such as Craigslists and Facebook. Research participants are culled from all over New York City as well as through collaborations with neighboring hospitals, Universities, and clinics. As a result, our enrolled research participant demographics follow those of New York City overall. In calendar year 2013 21% of research participants identified as Hispanic, 24% identified as Black or African-American and 47% identified as white (RUH subject race and ethnicity report 2013), which mirrors the geographic makeup of New York City (44% white, 25% Black or African-American, and 28% Hispanic) (www.census.gov 2010)."

Thus, all research participants are volunteers, and as such are important partners in the research process.

LAWS, REGULATIONS, CATASTROPHIC ILLNESSES AND THE RISING COSTS OF NEW TECHNOLOGY HAVE CREATED A CATEGORY OF PATIENTS WHO ARE EITHER UNINSURED OR UNDERINSURED. THIS CHARITY CARE PROGRAM HAS BEEN DEVELOPED TO HELP THE HOSPITAL MEET THE NEEDS OF THESE PATIENTS AND, CONCURRENTLY, MAINTAIN THE FINANCIAL VIABILITY OF THE HOSPITAL FOR FUTURE GENERATIONS. THIS CHARITY CARE POLICY EXPLAINS HOW THE HOSPITAL ASSISTS PATIENTS WHO CANNOT PAY FOR PART OR ALL OF THE ESSENTIAL MEDICAL CARE THEY RECEIVE. PRINCIPLES: STRONG MEMORIAL HOSPITAL PROACTIVELY CONVEYS INFORMATION ABOUT THIS CHARITY CARE POLICY TO PATIENTS AND THEIR FAMILIES. - WE BELIEVE THAT FEAR OF A HOSPITAL BILL SHOULD NEVER GET IN THE WAY OF ESSENTIAL HEALTH SERVICES. THE PROVISION OF URGENT OR EMERGENT HEALTHCARE IS NEVER DELAYED PENDING A FINANCIAL ASSISTANCE DETERMINATION. SIGNS ANNOUNCING THE CHARITY CARE PROGRAM ARE POSTED IN THE HOSPITAL (E.G. EMERGENCY DEPARTMENT, ADMITTING OFFICE) TO PROACTIVELY CONVEY THIS MESSAGE TO PROSPECTIVE PATIENTS AND THE PUBLIC IN GENERAL. - WE MAINTAIN FINANCIAL AID POLICIES THAT ARE CONSISTENT WITH THE MISSION, VALUES AND CAPACITY OF THE HOSPITAL AND THAT TAKE INTO ACCOUNT EACH INDIVIDUAL'S ABILITY TO CONTRIBUTE TO THE COST OF HIS OR HER CARE. - WE COMMUNICATE THE AVAILABILITY OF FINANCIAL AID IN A MANNER THAT IS CLEAR, UNDERSTANDABLE, SENSITIVE TO THE PATIENT'S DIGNITY, AND IN MULTIPLE LANGUAGES. A NOTICE IS AVAILABLE AT REGISTRATION SITES THAT INFORMS PATIENTS OF THIS PROGRAM AND PROVIDES THE PHONE NUMBER TO CALL TO OBTAIN MORE INFORMATION AND TO APPLY FOR THIS PROGRAM. DESIGNATED STAFF ARE PROVIDED DETAILED TRAINING SO THAT THEY CAN PROVIDE INFORMATION AND ANSWER QUESTIONS ABOUT THE CHARITY CARE PROGRAM. INFORMATION IS GENERALLY AVAILABLE IN BOTH ENGLISH AND SPANISH. WHEN REQUESTED, IT WILL ALSO BE MADE AVAILABLE IN OTHER LANGUAGES. - INFORMATION REGARDING OUR CHARITY CARE PROGRAM IS ALSO AVAILABLE ON THE URMC WEBSITE. - WE IMPLEMENT FINANCIAL AID PROCEDURES THAT ARE CONSUMER-FRIENDLY, RESPECTFUL, AND CONFIDENTIAL, AS WELL AS DEBT COLLECTION POLICIES THAT REFLECT THE MISSION AND VALUES OF THIS HOSPITAL. - WE WORK WITH GOVERNMENT, PAYERS, BUSINESS, CONSUMER GROUPS AND OTHERS TO ADDRESS THE UNDERLYING PROBLEM THAT TOO MANY NEW YORKERS LACK HEALTH INSURANCE. GENERAL GUIDELINES: AS PART OF FINANCIAL PLANNING ASSISTANCE, WE PROVIDE PATIENTS, AND/OR THEIR LEGAL REPRESENTATIVE, WITH INFORMATION ABOUT THE CRITERIA THAT MUST BE MET IN ORDER TO OBTAIN MEDICAID, MEDICARE, OR OTHER HEALTH INSURANCES. PATIENTS ARE ASSISTED IN MAKING APPLICATIONS FOR ANY OF THESE INSURANCES OR DISCOUNTED FEE PLANS. PATIENTS ARE EXPECTED TO PARTICIPATE FULLY IN ALL EFFORTS TO OBTAIN ANY INSURANCE FOR WHICH THEY MAY QUALIFY. UNDER CERTAIN CIRCUMSTANCES, AS DETERMINED BY THE FINANCIAL CASE MANAGERS OR OTHER HOSPITAL SENIOR ADMINISTRATORS. APPLICATIONS FOR MEDICAID, MEDICARE OR OTHER INSURANCE PROGRAMS MAY BE WAIVED WHEN DEEMED UNNECESSARY. IF AVAILABLE INSURANCE BENEFITS ARE NOT SUFFICIENT TO COVER THE COST OF THEIR CARE, PATIENTS MAY THEN APPLY FOR ASSISTANCE FROM THE CHARITY CARE PROGRAM. CHARITY CARE APPLICATIONS MUST BE COMPLETED AND RETURNED TO THE HOSPITAL WITH THE REQUESTED INCOME DOCUMENTATION. PATIENTS WILL NOT RECEIVE CHARITY CARE ASSISTANCE IF THEY (A) DO NOT COMPLETE THE APPLICATION PROCESS FOR MEDICAID OR OTHER INSURANCE FOR WHICH THEY MAY QUALIFY, (B) ELECT NOT TO MAKE APPLICATION FOR CHARITY CARE, OR (C) HAVE ADEQUATE RESOURCES OR INCOME TO PAY PRIVATELY FOR THEIR CARE. IN THESE SITUATIONS, THEY WILL REMAIN FINANCIALLY RESPONSIBLE FOR FULL PAYMENT OF THEIR HOSPITAL BILLS. CHARITY CARE ASSISTANCE IS AVAILABLE FOR PATIENTS WHO RESIDE IN NEW YORK STATE AND RECEIVE EMERGENCY HOSPITAL SERVICES, INCLUDING EMERGENCY TRANSFERS, AND TO PATIENTS WHO RESIDE IN STRONG MEMORIAL HOSPITAL'S PRIMARY SERVICE AREA IN NEW YORK STATE WHO RECEIVE SERVICES IN DESIGNATED STRONG MEMORIAL HOSPITAL PROGRAMS, INCLUDING MOST INPATIENT AND OUTPATIENT SERVICES. IN ADDITION, THE HOSPITAL MAY, IN ITS DISCRETION, GRANT CHARITY CARE TO INDIVIDUALS WHO RESIDE OUTSIDE OF NEW YORK STATE. CHARITY CARE ASSISTANCE DOES NOT COVER MEDICALLY UNNECESSARY CARE, COSMETIC ALTERATION, TELEPHONE, TELEVISION AND PRIVATE ROOM CHARGES. IT DOES NOT COVER SERVICES GENERATED BY AN INSURED PATIENT WHO CHOOSES TO RECEIVE CARE AT AN OUT-OF-NETWORK HOSPITAL, OR WHO FAILS TO COMPLY WITH INSURANCE POLICY REQUIREMENTS (E.G. UNAUTHORIZED SERVICES) NOR DOES IT APPLY TO NON-RESIDENT ALIENS (UNLESS APPROVED IN ADVANCE OF CARE BEING PROVIDED), TO DRUGS NOT ADMINISTERED IN THE HOSPITAL, TO TRANSPORTATION FURNISHED BY THIRD PARTY VENDORS, OR TO CARE, SERVICES, DRUGS OR SUPPLIES FOR THE PURPOSE OF GENDER CHANGE PROCEDURE. SPECIFIC QUESTIONS ABOUT SERVICES THAT ARE NOT COVERED SHOULD BE DIRECTED TO THE PATIENT ACCOUNTS MANAGER OR THEIR DELEGATE. FINANCIAL GUIDELINES: FINANCIAL AID IS INTENDED TO ASSIST THOSE INDIVIDUALS WHO CANNOT AFFORD TO PAY IN PART OR IN FULL FOR THEIR CARE. IT SHOULD TAKE INTO ACCOUNT EACH INDIVIDUAL'S ABILITY TO CONTRIBUTE TO THE COST OF HIS OR HER CARE. HOSPITAL FINANCIAL AID SHOULD NOT BE VIEWED AS A SUBSTITUTE FOR EMPLOYER-SPONSORED OR INDIVIDUALLY PURCHASED INSURANCE. PATIENTS WITHOUT INSURANCE AND WITH INCOME THAT WOULD QUALIFY THEM FOR THE CHARITY CARE PROGRAM BUT ALSO HAVE SUBSTANTIAL RESOURCES (OTHER THAN TAX-DEFERRED OR COMPARABLE RETIREMENT SAVINGS OR COLLEGE SAVINGS ACCOUNTS) MAY BE EXPECTED TO PAY PART OF THEIR BILLS(S). CHARITY CARE ASSISTANCE IS GENERALLY AVAILABLE TO INDIVIDUALS WHOSE INCOME IS LESS THAN OR EQUAL TO 400% OF THE FEDERAL POVERTY LEVEL. HOWEVER, PATIENTS WHO HAVE EXHAUSTED THEIR INSURANCE BENEFITS, EXCEEDED FINANCIAL ELIGIBILITY CRITERIA, FACE EXTRAORDINARY MEDICAL COSTS, OR WHO HAVE OTHER UNIQUE CIRCUMSTANCES MAY BE CONSIDERED FOR CHARITY CARE APPROVAL IN THE HOSPITAL'S SOLE DISCRETION. WHILE APPLICATION FOR MEDICAID OR OTHER INSURANCE IS USUALLY REQUIRED, THE HOSPITAL MAY, AT ITS SOLE DISCRETION, IN APPROPRIATE CASES, ALSO CONSIDER PATIENTS FOR CHARITY CARE WHEN THEY MEET THE FINANCIAL CRITERIA OF THIS PROGRAM, BUT HAVE NOT SATISFACTORILY COMPLETED ALL THE REQUIREMENTS OF THE CHARITY CARE APPLICATION PROCESS. THIS MAY INCLUDE PATIENTS WHO HAVE BEEN SANCTIONED BY MEDICAID, HAVE FILED BANKRUPTCY OR APPEAR TO BE ELIGIBLE FOR CHARITY CARE ASSISTANCE BASED ON AVAILABLE INFORMATION. ELIGIBILITY DETERMINATIONS IN COMPLEX CASE CIRCUMSTANCES WILL BE MADE AFTER CONSIDERATION BY THE CHARITY CARE REVIEW TEAM THAT INCLUDES THE CHARITY CARE OFFICER, FINANCIAL CASE MANAGER AND/OR THEIR MANAGERS, OR MAY BE MADE BY SENIOR HOSPITAL ADMINISTRATORS. THE AMOUNT OF THE DISCOUNT AFFORDED TO QUALIFIED CHARITY CARE PATIENTS WILL BE DETERMINED THROUGH ASSESSMENT OF THE RESPONSIBLE PARTY'S ANNUAL HOUSEHOLD INCOME AND THE NUMBER OF PEOPLE IN THE HOME, AS A PERCENTAGE OF THE FEDERAL POVERTY GUIDELINE AMOUNTS FOR SAME SIZE HOUSEHOLDS. THE FINANCIAL GUIDELINES WILL BE UPDATED ANNUALLY IN CONJUNCTION WITH THE FEDERAL POVERTY UPDATES PUBLISHED BY CMS. PATIENTS MAY RECEIVE FULL OR PARTIAL DISCOUNT FROM THE COST OF CARE, DEPENDING ON THE PERCENTAGE OF THE GUIDELINES MATCHED BY THE PATIENT'S HOUSEHOLD INCOME. ANY BILL AMOUNT REMAINING AFTER APPLICATION OF A PARTIAL CHARITY CARE DISCOUNT IS THE RESPONSIBILITY OF THE PATIENT. THE AMOUNT AN APPROVED CHARITY CARE PATIENT WILL GENERALLY BE EXPECTED TO PAY FOR SERVICES COVERED BY THE POLICY WILL BE LIMITED TO THE LOWER OF THE AMOUNT THAT THE HOSPITAL WOULD HAVE RECEIVED FOR THE SAME SERVICE UNDER MEDICARE PARTS A AND B, (INCLUDING COINSURANCE, CO-PAYMENTS AND DEDUCTIBLES) OR THE USUAL AND CUSTOMARY CHARGES. THE PATIENT WILL BE ASSISTED BY THE HOSPITAL IN MAKING ARRANGEMENTS TO SATISFY ANY BALANCE REMAINING ON THE ACCOUNT(S) AFTER THE APPLICATION OF THE APPROPRIATE CHARITY CARE DISCOUNT BY USE OF A PAYMENT PLAN. THE MONTHLY PAYMENTS UNDER SUCH PLANS SHALL NOT EXCEED TEN PERCENT (10%) OF THE ELIGIBLE PATIENT'S GROSS MONTHLY INCOME.

THE MISSION OF UR WELL STREET MEDICINE IS TO ENSURE ACCESS TO QUALITY MEDICAL CARE FOR ROCHESTER'S UNSHELTERED HOMELESS POPULATION, OPERATING UNDER THE PRINCIPLE THAT HEALTH CARE IS A BASIC HUMAN RIGHT. IT SEEKS TO BRIDGE GAPS BETWEEN THE HOMELESS AND MEDICAL COMMUNITIES THROUGH DIRECT STREET OUTREACH AND ENGAGEMENT WITH HOMELESS PEOPLE WHERE THEY LIVE, WHILE BUILDING RELATIONSHIPS OF TRUST AND RESPECT. OUTREACH TEAMS (EACH COMPOSED OF AN OUTREACH GUIDE, A PHYSICIAN, MEDICAL STUDENTS FROM THE SCHOOL OF MEDICINE AND DENTISTRY, AND SOCIAL WORKERS) MAKE WEEKLY VISITS TO HOMELESS SHELTERS, CAMPSITES, CITY PARKS, AND OTHER PLACES WHERE HOMELESS PEOPLE RESIDE.

ADMINISTRATIVELY, UR MEDICAL CENTER LEADERSHIP HAS INITIATED A COMPREHENSIVE AND AMBITIOUS STRATEGIC PLANNING PROCESS ACROSS THE INSTITUTION. THE GOALS OF THE PLAN INCLUDE EXPANDING COMMUNITY HEALTH PROGRAMS AND RESEARCH THAT IMPROVE THE OVERALL HEALTH OF THE GREATER ROCHESTER COMMUNITY. THE BOARD OF DIRECTORS ENDORSE AND CHAMPION THE VISION OF THE PLAN. THE COMMUNITY ADVISORY COUNCIL (CAC) WAS CREATED IN 2006 TO REPRESENT THE VOICE OF THE COMMUNITY AND TO GUIDE AND SUPPORT THE FOUR MISSIONS OF THE URMC. THE THIRTY-SEVEN MEMBER CAC REPRESENTS EIGHTEEN COMMUNITY-BASED ORGANIZATIONS, INCLUDING HEALTH AND SOCIAL SERVICE AGENCIES, THE FAITH COMMUNITY, LOCAL GOVERNMENT, THE CITY SCHOOL DISTRICT AND MEDIA.
