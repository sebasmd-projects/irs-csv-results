THE NOTES IN EACH SERIES ARE ISSUED IN TRANCHES. EACH TRANCHE IS COMPRISED OF ISSUES WHICH ARE SEGREGATED BY THE AFOREMENTIONED FOUR ASSET TYPES. WEIGHTED AVERAGE LIFE CALCULATIONS ARE PREPARED FOR EACH ISSUE WITHIN A TRANCHE, RESULTING IN UNIQUE MATURITY DATES FOR EACH ISSUE WITHIN A TRANCHE. WHILE A SEPARATE FORM 8038 IS PREPARED FOR EACH ISSUE WITHIN A COMMERCIAL PAPER TRANCHE, SCHEDULE K INSTRUCTIONS PERMIT INFORMATION TO BE COMBINED FOR SERIES THAT ARE ISSUED AT SUBSTANTIALLY THE SAME TIME.

Part III, Line 1, Columns A, C and D: In 2015, SLU entered into a joint venture with SSM Health Care Corporation (""SSM Health Care""). As part of the joint venture, SLU contributed SLU Hospital (which was not tax-exempt bond financed) and certain related assets to SSM Health Care's St. Louis hospital operating subsidiary, SSM Health St. Louis (""SSM St. Louis""), the second largest health system in the St. Louis market. In the joint venture SLU has a 15% membership interest in SSM St. Louis and SSM Health Care has the remaining 85% member interest in SSM St. Louis. In connection with the joint venture, SSM Health Care committed to replace SLU Hospital and the current SLU outpatient care center (at a cost of approximately $550 million) within five years from the date of the purchase. In connection with the SLU Hospital transaction, SLU also entered into a new 50-year Academic Affiliation Agreement with SSM St. Louis which will enhance and expand the academic and medical mission of SLUCare and the SLU's Medical School. This integrated partnership will provide the St. Louis community with more coordinated access to high quality care.

During the tax year approximately 11% of the recreation center revenues were derived from an unrelated trade or business. This unrelated trade or business use, measured as a percentage of the bonds would be approximate 1/10th of 1% of bond proceeds during the tax year.
