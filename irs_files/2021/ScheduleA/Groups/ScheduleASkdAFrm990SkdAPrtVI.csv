GENERAL BARTON KYLE YOUNT OBTAINED THE AIRFIELD WITH THE EXPRESS PURPOSE OF DEVELOPING A SCHOOL FOCUSED EXCLUSIVELY ON INTERNATIONAL TRADE AND GLOBAL RELATIONS. AS AIFT, THUNDERBIRD BECAME THE FIRST-EVER HIGHER-EDUCATION INSTITUTION TO FOCUS EXCLUSIVELY ON INTERNATIONAL MANAGEMENT BY CONCENTRATING CURRICULUM ON CROSS-CULTURAL COMMUNICATION, REGIONAL BUSINESS STUDIES, AND HANDS-ON, REAL-WORLD TRAINING IN GLOBAL BUSINESS NUANCES. BY 1955, THERE WERE TWO DEGREES OFFERED: A BACHELOR OF FOREIGN TRADE AND A MASTER OF FOREIGN TRADE. OVER THE YEARS, THE BACHELOR'S PROGRAM WAS DISCONTINUED AND THE MASTER'S PROGRAM MORPHED INTO A MASTER OF INTERNATIONAL MANAGEMENT (MIM). IN 2001, THE MIM WAS ADAPTED INTO AN MBA IN GLOBAL MANAGEMENT TO RESPOND TO THE GROWING DEMAND FOR GRADUATES WITH A BUSINESS ADMINISTRATION FOCUS. DURING THOSE SAME YEARS, THUNDERBIRD EXPANDED ITS DEGREE PROGRAM OFFERINGS TO INCLUDE AN ONLINE MBA, AN EXECUTIVE MBA, AND EARLY-CAREER MASTER'S DEGREES LIKE THE MASTER OF ARTS IN GLOBAL AFFAIRS & MANAGEMENT. THE SCHOOL CONSISTENTLY RANKED #1 FOR INTERNATIONAL BUSINESS FOR MANY YEARS, SETTING THE STANDARD FOR GLOBAL MANAGEMENT EDUCATION WORLDWIDE. AT THE SAME TIME, THUNDERBIRD EXECUTIVE EDUCATION OFFERED OPEN PROGRAMS FOR INDIVIDUALS SEEKING CAREER DEVELOPMENT OPPORTUNITIES AND CUSTOM PROGRAMS FOR GLOBAL ORGANIZATIONS LOOKING FOR INDIVIDUALIZED DEVELOPMENT SOLUTIONS FOR THEIR UNIQUE CHALLENGES. RANKED AMONG THE WORLD'S BEST EXECUTIVE EDUCATION PROGRAMS, THUNDERBIRD'S EDUCATIONAL OFFERINGS EXPANDED OVER THE YEARS TO INCLUDE A ROBUST SELECTION OF ONLINE EXECUTIVE CERTIFICATE PROGRAMS, INTERNATIONAL CONSORTIA PROGRAMS, EXECUTIVE COACHING, AND MORE. IN DECEMBER OF 2014, THUNDERBIRD ENTERED INTO AN AGREEMENT WITH ARIZONA STATE UNIVERSITY (ASU) TO INTEGRATE THUNDERBIRD INTO THE GREATER ASU KNOWLEDGE ENTERPRISE IN ORDER TO CREATE MORE IN DEPTH AND BROADER REACHING EDUCATION TO STUDENTS AND EXECUTIVES INTERNATIONALLY. AS PART OF THIS AGREEMENT, ALL US EMPLOYEES AND DEGREE SEEKING STUDENTS OF THUNDERBIRD BECAME EMPLOYEES AND STUDENTS OF ASU. THUNDERBIRD'S EXECUTIVE EDUCATION PROGRAM, CERTAIN INTERNATIONAL PROGRAMS, AND MOST THUNDERBIRD ASSETS REMAINED WITH THUNDERBIRD. THE PROGRAMS AND SERVICES THAT REMAIN WITH THUNDERBIRD CONTINUE TO FURTHER THUNDERBIRD'S CHARITABLE AND EDUCATIONAL PURPOSES, INCLUDING BY SUPPORTING ASU. BEGINNING IN FISCAL YEAR 2015, AND IN ORDER TO MORE ACCURATELY REFLECT THE CURRENT CHARITABLE AND EDUCATIONAL ACTIVITIES OF THUNDERBIRD, THUNDERBIRD BELIEVES IT NOW IS APPROPRIATE TO REPORT AS A PUBLICLY SUPPORTED PUBLIC CHARITY UNDER SECTION 509(A)(2) OF THE CODE. IN CONJUNCTION WITH THIS DECISION AND TRANSITION, THUNDERBIRD IS ENGAGING IN INTERNAL EFFORTS TO IDENTIFY AND DEVELOP NEW SOURCES OF PUBLIC SUPPORT RELATIVE TO THUNDERBIRD'S CURRENT PROGRAMS AND SERVICES. AS A SCHOOL DESCRIBED IN SECTION 170(B)(1)(A)(II) OF THE CODE, THUNDERBIRD WAS NOT REQUIRED TO CONSIDER WHICH OF ITS REVENUES REPORTED ON LINES 1, 2, OR 3 OF PART III OF SCHEDULE A WERE RECEIVED FROM DISQUALIFIED PERSONS AND DOES NOT HAVE RECORDS SUFFICIENT TO MAKE THIS DETERMINATION. ACCORDINGLY, IN ORDER TO COMPLETE PART III OF SCHEDULE A, THUNDERBIRD HAS ASSUMED, FOR PURPOSES OF CALCULATING ITS PUBLIC SUPPORT PERCENTAGE, THAT ALL GIFTS, GRANTS, CONTRIBUTIONS, AND MEMBERSHIP FEES REPORTED ON LINE 1 WERE RECEIVED FROM DISQUALIFIED PERSONS, EXCEPT TO THE EXTENT THAT THUNDERBIRD'S RECORDS CLEARLY INDICATE AMOUNTS OF SUPPORT RECEIVED FROM GOVERNMENTAL UNITS OR ORGANIZATIONS DESCRIBED IN SECTION 509(A)(1) OF THE CODE.

FOR FY19 THERE WERE NO DISQUALIFED DONORS. IN 2018 THUNDERBIRD WAS APPROACHED BY ARIZONA CHRISTIAN UNIVERSITY (ACU) ABOUT EXCHANGING THE THUNDERBIRD GLENDALE CAMPUS WITH ACU'S NORTH PHOENIX CAMPUS. THIS EXCHANGE MET THE NEEDS OF THUNDERBIRD IN THEIR FUTURE STRATEGIC AND PROGRAMMATIC PLANS PROJECTIONS AND THIS EXCHANGE WAS FINALIZED NOVEMBER 2018. THIS RESULTED IN A CAPITAL ASSET WRITE OFF OF JUST OVER $9 MILLION DOLLARS. AS THIS CAPITAL ASSET WRITE OFF WAS DUE TO THE EXCHANGE OF CAPITAL ASSETS, IT IS NOT REQUIRED TO BE COUNTED IN THE CALCUATION OF PUBLIC SUPPORT. IN 2019 THE ACU CAMPUS WAS SOLD TO AN UNRELATED THIRD PARTY WHICH RESULTED IN A CAPITAL GAIN OF JUST OVER $4 MILLION DOLLARS. AS THE GAIN WAS RELATED TO THE SALE OF CAPITAL ASSETS, THE GAIN IS NOT REQUIRED TO BE COUNTED IN THE CALCUATION OF PUBLIC SUPPORT. ALSO, IN 2019 THUNDERBIRD WAS THE RECIPIENT OF A $4 MILLION DOLLAR BEQUEST FROM AN ALUM, THIS CONTRIBUTION MEETS THE DEFINITION OF AN UNUSUAL GRANT UNDER 1.509(A)-3(C)(3) AND HAS BEEN EXCLUDED FROM THE PUBLIC SUPPORT TEST."
