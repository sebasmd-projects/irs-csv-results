The executive compensation strategy includes a comprehensive review of the entire compensation package, which includes base salary, incentive and deferred compensation, retirement plans, and other benefits. As is common for private universities, Lynn offers a deferred compensation plan to officers and executives. Annual deferrals into the plan become taxable when they are distributed, which can often result in large amounts included in taxable income because several years of deferrals are paid out at once. Multiple years of deferred and incentive compensation came to fruition in 2019. This compensation was awarded to Dr. Ross in consideration for his long tenure, which is more than double the average college president tenure, and for the completion of the university's Lynn 2020 strategic plan two years ahead of schedule. Under his leadership, the university has added 27 new undergraduate majors and 11 new graduate majors; raised over $100 million in capital and endowed gifts; transformed campus with enhanced technology and nearly 200,000 square feet of new facilities; and increased overall enrollment by 53 percent in the past 10 years, which includes a 48 percent increase in undergraduate enrollment and 72 percent growth in graduate enrollment. On June 30, 2019, President Ross received a distribution from a nonqualified supplemental deferred compensation plan in the amount of $337,462, which includes $300,000 previously reported as deferred compensation and $37,462 of plan earnings. The University also accrued $100,000 into this plan for President Ross during 2019. Additionally, the University maintains a deferred compensation plan for Sherrie Weldon, which provides her each a one-time distribution of $75,000 if she is still employed at Lynn at the end of three years. The University accrued $25,000 during 2019 for Sherrie Weldon."

The remainder of the severance is to be paid over the next two years and is included in the deferred compensation reported in column (C). PART I, LINES 3, 4B & PART II - COLUMNS (B)(i), (ii) and (iii) As it relates to Compensation from either Montefiore Medicine Academic Health System, Inc. or Montefiore Health System, Inc. The Compensation Committee reviews and approves all forms of compensation and benefits provided to all officers and certain key employees with the assistance of a national independent compensation consulting firm. The consulting firm assists the Compensation Committee with its decision-making process to ensure executive compensation levels are reasonable and appropriate relative to those of other similar organizations. Base salaries in Column B(i) are determined based on competitive market practices for comparable positions with similar size organizations and scope of responsibilities. Bonus and incentive compensation in Column B(ii) is based on the achievement of performance goals. The executives' compensation program has a significant pay-at-risk component to ensure the alignment of pay and organizational performance. Goals are set in advance in areas such as quality of care, patient satisfaction, community services and financial performance. Compensation is at risk if the goals established by the Compensation Committee are not met. Other reportable compensation in column B(III) includes distributions from the supplemental executive retirement plan. In a manner designed to qualify for the ""rebuttable presumption of reasonableness"" the Compensation Committee of the Board of Trustees expressly reviewed and approved these retirement benefit arrangements for senior executives in a manner that qualified under the intermediate sanctions rules of the Federal tax law, and in recognition of (a) the executives' years of service to the organization and (b) the significant contributions to enhancing the ability of the organization to achieve its charitable mission in a manner consistent with financial solvency. Accordingly, this benefit should be viewed as applying to years of service for the organization.

Part I, Line 4A - Severance Pay: Richard Ortiz received 355,000 in severance pay. Helen Kotchoubey received 360,000 in severance pay. Part I, Line 4B: Supplemental nonqualified retirement Plan: NewYork-Presbyterian/Brooklyn Methodist supplements their executives pension benefits through a supplemental (""nonqualified"") retirement plan. The supplemental executive retirement plan (SERP) is subject to a multi-year vesting requirement (commencing after three years of participation in the SERP, in prorated amounts through age 65) which places an executive's supplemental retirement benefit at risk of forfeiture if the vesting requirements are not satisfied. If the participant performs continuous, uninterrupted substantial service for the hospital through each applicable vesting date, the balance then credited to the participants account and in which the participant shall become vested on such vesting date shall be paid to the participant in a single sum within sixty (60) days following the vesting date. Part I, Line 4B: Participated in Supplemental nonqualified retirement Plan: Michael Fagan: 48,901 Steven Silber: 35,047 Part I, Line 4B: Supplemental Nonqualified retirement plan as reported on W2: Michael Fagan: 75,591 Steven Silber: 35,493 Richard Ortiz: 123,905 Part I, Line 4B: A Certain individual of the New York and Presbyterian Hospital identified in part VII as a Director of New York Presbyterian/Brooklyn Methodist is responsible for executing the mission and management of the New York and Presbyterian Hospital (NYP) and its affiliated entities. Compensation for 2019 of these upper level executives includes the payout of an annual incentive plan and a long-term incentive plan. This performance-oriented program conditions payments upon the achievement of multiple individual and group performance measures. Measures to monitor performance include: operational and financial strength, patient quality and safety, patient satisfaction, advancement of patient care, and people development and partnership. Incentive awards may only be granted if the organization achieves a financial surplus. Even if all relevant performance measurements are achieved, the NYP Board of Trustees retains full discretion to make or not make any incentive awards, or to reduce the amount of any incentive award. This initiative is critical to assuring that NYP has the requisite leadership to create and manage a highly motivated and engaged workforce, to drive superior performance throughout the organization and to achieve top tier medical center status. As a separate matter, due to restrictions imposed by the Internal Revenue Code, upper level executives are limited in the amount of benefits received under a tax-qualified retirement plan. Like many employers, NYP supplements these executives' pension benefits through a supplemental (""nonqualified"") retirement plan. The supplemental executive retirement plan (SERP) is subject to a multi-year vesting requirement (commencing after five years of participation in the SERP, in prorated amounts through age 65) which places an executive's supplemental retirement benefit at risk of forfeiture if the vesting requirements are not satisfied. Once vested, however, provisions of the Internal Revenue Code require that the vested executive include in current income the value of his or her vested supplemental retirement benefit. Notwithstanding the legal requirement to recognize the vested value of the supplemental retirement benefit as current income, the supplemental retirement benefit will not be distributed to the executive until the executive actually retires from NYP (although, as permitted by the Internal Revenue Code, the supplemental retirement plan will effect a distribution of an amount necessary to satisfy the executive's tax liability resulting from the income recognition upon vesting). As noted, this supplemental retirement benefit will not be distributed to the executive until the executive actually retires from NYP. There are constantly changing legal, tax, accounting, and public disclosure rules for a SERP (supplemental executive retirement plan) in not-for-profit organizations. The executive Compensation Committee continuously monitors these changes and incorporates any changes into the overall SERP plan design. As in past years, the executive Compensation Committee of NYP requires a third party complete a review of the organization's compensation program to ensure its effectiveness in terms of government regulations, market conditions and the need to continually elevate organizational performance. The report also serves to meet the regulatory obligations to ensure that all elements of the executive compensation programs are reasonable. The individuals listed in part VII that are compensated by New York Presbyterian Hospital devote an average of sixty hours per week to perform their responsibilities for the New York Presbyterian Hospital and other related organizations in the aggregate.

The procedure is designed to comply with the requirements of Section 4958 of the Internal Revenue Code and Internal Revenue Service regulations. The CORD Committee maintains a roster of disqualified persons, as defined by the IRS, for whose compensation the procedure is used. The roster is reviewed periodically but at least annually. The procedure was last evaluated with the full board in December 2014. The procedure requires three elements as follows: 1) The terms of transactions are approved by the organization's governing body, or a committee thereof, whose members have no conflict of interest with respect to the arrangement. The Board of Trustees delegated authority to the CORD Committee to act on behalf of the Board in these matters at its meeting on March 25, 1999. Compensation arrangements are reviewed and approved by the CORD Committee before the effective date. Members of the CORD Committee recuse themselves from any vote in which there is a potential or actual conflict of interest. 2) The governing body or committee obtains and relies upon appropriate, comparable data before making its determination. Rice participates in the annual survey by Willis Towers Watson of select universities' executive compensation, and additional appropriate peer surveys. These reports reflect executive compensation in universities of a stature similar to that of Rice, and with which Rice competes for faculty and staff. The CORD Committee may also seek and rely on other relevant information, including compensation paid by other taxable and tax-exempt organizations for functionally comparable positions, geographic market forces, and actual written offers from similar institutions competing for services. The CORD Committee relies on this data and documents any determinations that reasonable compensation is an amount more than the range of comparable data. 3) The governing body or committee adequately documents the basis for making determinations concurrently with making decisions. Minutes documenting the deliberations of the CORD Committee are prepared contemporaneously for review and approval at its next meeting."

Travel for companions: AHSSHC has a Corporate Executive Policy that provides a benefit to allow for a traveling AHSSHC executive to have his or her spouse accompany the executive on certain business trips each year. Typically, reimbursement is only provided to certain executive leaders and is usually limited to one business trip per year beyond the annual AdventHealth President's Council business meeting and other meetings where the spouse is specifically invited. The AHSSHC Corporate Executive Spousal Travel Policy was originally approved and reviewed by the AHSSHC Board Compensation Committee, an independent body of the AHSSHC Board of Directors. All spousal travel costs reimbursed to the executive are considered taxable compensation to the executive."

Compensation and benefits provided to this individual are determined pursuant to policies, procedures, and processes of AHSSHC that are designed to ensure compliance with the intermediate sanctions laws as set forth in IRC Section 4958. AHSSHC has taken steps to ensure that processes are in place to satisfy the rebuttable presumption of reasonableness standard as set forth in Treasury Regulation 53.4958-6 with respect to its active executive-level positions. The AHSSHC Board Compensation Committee (the Committee) serves as the governing body for all executive compensation matters. The Committee is composed of certain members of the Board of Directors (the Board) of AHSSHC. Voting members of the Committee include only individuals who serve on the Board as independent representatives of the community, who hold no employment positions with AHSSHC and who do not have relationships with any of the individuals whose compensation is under their review that impacts their best independent judgment as fiduciaries of AHSSHC. The Committee's role is to review and approve all components of the executive compensation plan of AHSSHC. As an independent governing body with respect to executive compensation, it should be noted that the Committee will often confer in executive sessions on matters of compensation policy and policy changes. In such executive sessions, no members of management of AHSSHC are present. The Committee is advised by an independent third-party compensation advisor. This advisor prepares all the benchmark studies for the Committee. Compensation levels are benchmarked with a national peer group of other not-for-profit healthcare systems and hospitals of similar size and complexity to AdventHealth and each of its affiliated entities. The following principles guide the establishment of individual executive compensation: - The salary of the President/CEO of AdventHealth will not exceed the 50th percentile of comparable salaries paid by similarly situated organizations; and - Other executive salaries shall be established using market medians. The compensation philosophy, policies, and practices of AHSSHC are consistent with the organization's faith-based mission and conform to applicable laws, regulations, and business practices. As a faith-based organization sponsored by the Seventh-day Adventist Church (the Church), AHSSHC's philosophy and principles with respect to its executive compensation practices reflect the conservative approach of the Church's mission of service and were developed in counsel with the Church's leadership."
202043219349309354,593069793,"Part I, Line 4b","As discussed in Line 1a above, the President of the filing organization is compensated by and on the payroll of Adventist Health System Sunbelt Healthcare Corporation (AHSSHC), the parent organization of a healthcare system now known as AdventHealth. In recognition of the contribution that each executive makes to the success of AdventHealth, AdventHealth provides to eligible executives participation in the AdventHealth Executive FLEX Benefit Program (the Plan). The purpose of the Plan is to offer eligible executives an opportunity to elect from among a variety of supplemental benefits, including a split dollar life insurance policy and long-term care insurance, to individually tailor a benefits program appropriate to each executive's needs. The Plan provides eligible participants a pre-determined benefits allowance credit that is equal to a percentage of the executive's base pay from which is deducted the cost of mandatory and elective employee benefits. The pre-determined benefits allowance credit percentage is approved by the AHSSHC Board Compensation Committee, an independent committee of the Board of Directors of AHSSHC. Any funds that remain after the cost of mandatory and elective benefits are subtracted from the annual pre-determined benefits allowance are contributed, at the employee's option, to either an IRC 457(f) deferred compensation account or to an IRC 457(b) eligible deferred compensation plan. Upon attainment of age 65, all previous 457(f) deferred amounts are paid immediately to the participant and any future employer contributions are made quarterly from the Plan directly to the participant. The Plan documents define an employee who is eligible to participate in the Plan to generally include the Chief Executive Officers of AdventHealth entities and Vice Presidents of all AdventHealth entities whose base salary is at least $260,000. The Plan provides for a class year vesting schedule (2 years for each class year) with respect to amounts accumulated in the executive's 457(f) deferred compensation account. Distributions could also be made from the executive's 457(f) deferred compensation account upon attainment of age 65 or upon an involuntary separation. The account is forfeited by the executive upon a voluntary separation. In addition to the Plan, AdventHealth has instituted a defined benefit, non-tax-qualified deferred compensation plan for certain executives who have provided lengthy service to AdventHealth and/or to other Seventh-day Adventist Church hospitals or health care institutions. Participation in the plan is offered to AdventHealth executives on a pro-rata schedule beginning with 20 years of service as an employee of AdventHealth and/or another hospital or health care institution controlled by the Seventh-day Adventist Church and who satisfy certain other qualifying criteria. This supplemental executive retirement plan (SERP) was designed to provide eligible executives with the economic equivalent of an annual income beginning at normal retirement age equal to 60% of the average of the participant's three, five or seven highest years of base salary from AdventHealth active employment inclusive of income from all other Seventh-day Adventist Church healthcare employer-financed retirement income sources and investment income earned on those contributions through social security normal retirement age as defined in the plan. The number of years included in highest average compensation is determined by the individual's year of entry to the SERP and by the individual's year of entry to the AdventHealth Executive FLEX Benefit Program. Additionally, AdventHealth has adopted a Senior Executive Death Benefit (SEDB) Plan in recognition of the considerable age and service requirements in the SERP. The SEDB Plan provides a benefit in an amount equal to the amount the executive's benefit would have been under the SERP Plan assuming that, on the date of the executive's death (and not before), the executive satisfied the last of the eligibility requirements of the SERP Plan with present value recognizing an early benefit commencement. An eligible executive becomes a participant in the SEDB Plan if the executive dies prior to termination of employment, provided the executive has not satisfied all of the eligibility requirements of SERP as of the executive's date of death but would have satisfied all of those requirements within five (5) years following death had the executive lived and continued employment. The SEDB Plan was reviewed and approved by the AHSSHC Board Compensation Committee, an independent body of the AHSSHC Board of Directors.
