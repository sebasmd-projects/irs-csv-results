All need-based financial aid must be awarded according to a student's calculated financial need. Scholarship awards are primarily provided on scholastic achievement. University scholarships are highly competitive and available to students through a combination of academic achievement and personal commitment, display of values, compassion, and pursuit of excellence which embody the spirit and mission of the University. The University has many scholarships funded through special endowments and donations.
