The policy provides guidance to ensure that subrecipients conduct their portions of sponsored projects in compliance with laws, regulations, terms and conditions of awards and subawards, and that reimbursed costs incurred by subrecipients are allowed. The policy addresses the roles and responsibilities of central offices and academic departments of the university and describes the monitoring procedures for each area. The full text of Vanderbilt's subrecipient policy is available online at the following web address: https://www.vanderbilt.edu/ocga/docs/vupolicies/subrecipient/RevisedVUSubrecipientMonitoringGuidelines_effective12_26_2014.pdf Financial Aid: Assistance offered from institutional funds by Vanderbilt to our students is awarded on the basis of merit and/or financial need. Such assistance helps students and their families support the cost of attendance which includes tuition, mandatory fees, room & board, books, other course materials/supplies, and allowances for personal/miscellaneous and travel expenses. Merit-based awards are competitively awarded in recognition of academic achievement, leadership, and commitment to community service, contributions to society, and other forms of accomplishment. Need-based assistance is awarded on the basis of documented financial need, resulting from a need analysis evaluation accomplished in accordance with relevant and applicable federal, state, and/or institutional programs, policies, and eligibility requirements. The units responsible for administering student financial aid at Vanderbilt regularly initiate system-generated reviews, as well as other cross-checks on an ad hoc basis. Results from these reviews, along with recurring management reports, are regularly evaluated. Subsequently, follow-up corrective actions are taken when appropriate and potentially include award revisions or cancellations. These provisions are designed to help ensure that student assistance funds are awarded to eligible recipients, in accordance with applicable federal, state, institutional, and other program legislation, as well as relevant internal University policies and operational guidelines/criteria."

Student Financial Services staff determine student eligibility based on a consistently applied need analysis formula which calculates the expected family contribution (EFC). The EFC is subtracted from the total cost of attendance to equal the financial aid eligibility. The financial aid grant amount is determined based on consistently applied packaging formulas to meet the full calculated need of each student. In addition to the need based aid, there are some grants that are awarded based on merit or other factors. Financial aid grant funds are monitored through the financial aid management software, PowerFAIDS. Staff who will be awarding financial aid grant funds are trained to adhere to these policies and procedures. The financial aid grant information is transferred from PowerFAIDS to the student information system, Ellucian Colleague, via a regularly scheduled interface. When all institutional grant disbursement requirements are met, the funds are disbursed to the student account in Colleague. The funds are credited against any billed charges that have been previously posted. If this transaction results in a credit balance, the credit may be refunded to the student in the form of a check. The student initiates this refund process by submitting a completed Disbursement Form or Credit Balance Request Form. Student eligibility is monitored throughout the period of enrollment and adjustments are made, as necessary, for changes in enrollment status according to the College's published refund policies. During the fiscal year, the College conducted grant-funded research. Four of the research grants included collaboration with institutions whose faculty are accomplished in their respective fields of study. Infrequently at the discretion of the President or Vice President for Finance and Administration, the College makes donations to support the town or nonprofit organizations. In these instances, the College generally does not monitor the ultimate use of the funds as these amounts are unrestricted grants to municipalities and organizations that are recognized as being described in Internal Revenue Code Section 501(C)(3).

Travel Grants - Travel grants are awarded to students to offset travel expenses used for educational purposes such as attending a conference, presenting a paper, etc. The awarding of travel grants is based upon an application process and meeting a set of criteria that establish the benefits to the students' educational endeavors. Research Grants - The Office of the Vice Provost for Research (OVPR) publishes guidelines for each of the internal grant programs that provide the general conditions of the award, as well as guidance on the expenses that may be charged to the award. Each grant is set up as a separate project in the University's financial system based on the award amount and budget categories approved by the OVPR and administered through the Office of Sponsored Programs. The financial system provides real time access to a Budget Summary Report for the project that provides a comparison of budgeted expenditures to cumulative actual expenditures by expenditure category. This report can be accessed by the Project Manager and others with administrative and financial oversight responsibilities. Expenditure transactions under internal grant programs are subject to internal controls for approval and processing similar to other University expenditure transactions.

Grant recipients subject to the U.S. Office of Management and Budget Circular A-133 Audits of States, Local Governments, and Non-Profit Organizations are also required to provide certification of their compliance with the financial audit requirements of those guidelines prior to receiving funds. Thereafter, the University requires an annual certification of continuing compliance and a copy of their most recent audit report.

In such cases, the donee/grantee organization must provide documentation to the filing organization before funds are approved for disbursement. In other cases, grantees submit progress reports on the anniversary date on which the grant was received. The evaluation report includes: 1) progress toward the deployment of the stated goals and objectives, 2) progress towards the achievement of desired outcome as demonstrated by Project Work Plan, 3) an accurate accounting of the revenue and expenses and the amount of the mission fund award expensed, and 4) a summary past, current and future funding sources and efforts to secure sustaining sources of funding. Description of the Bon Secours Mercy Health Mission Fund: Bon Secours Mercy Health performs its philanthropic work through its mission department. This initiative, called the Bon Secours Health System Mission Fund (""Mission Fund""), was developed to promote the Catholic Health Ministry and the Bon Secours Mercy Health, Inc. Mission. This purpose is realized through the funding of initiatives that improve the health and well-being of communities, particularly for disenfranchised and marginalized people, served by Bon Secours Mercy Health Local Systems (""Local Systems""), Cosponsors and the Congregation of the Sisters of Bon Secours. The scope of its purpose and use of funds would be to: -promote healthy community coalition initiatives in conjunction with local system efforts, -develop local system and community excellence for a specific health condition and preventive need, and -improve access for uninsured populations and reduce health disparities among populations in the community. The Strategic Quality Plan of the health system calls for focused efforts to Build Healthier Communities. The health system understands ""health"" to include social and communal dimensions and has adopted the following articulation of a healthy community. The conditions of communities and individuals served by Bon Secours Mercy Health reflect the interaction of significant factors and complex behaviors at the individual, communal, and societal level. It is not likely that interventions by any one organization will result in substantial improvement or benefit to the community. Rather, increased participation by stakeholders and greater cooperation among entities with appropriate skills and resources is necessary for systemic change and improved outcomes. Mission Fund grants place emphasis on increased collaboration among community based members (Healthy Community Initiative), public health officials and other providers of services. The Mission Fund anticipates that most endeavors that seek to bring meaningful improvement require time and commitment. Consequently, local system grant recipients may expect continuity of support (several years) to establish and track outcomes. At the same time, grant applicants need to cultivate and achieve a wide array of financial resources necessary to sustain promising projects and service programs."

Both are credited to the student's semester bill thus reducing the payment due to the college. The college also awards a relatively small number of merit-based grants. The college funds internships that meet rigorous academic criteria. Other financial assistance is provided to meet emergency type aid on a case-by-case basis.

Each student's award package is reviewed to ensure compliance with applicable regulatory requirements, and in the case of restricted institutional funds, with the donor's intent and wishes. Academic scholarship eligibility is based on a scoring matrix that evaluates an individual student's success using national test scores, high school GPA, and rigor of curriculum. Those who have excelled academically are generally given the largest share of university funded dollars. Institutionally funded need-based financial aid programs are based on eligibility established by use of an Institutional Methodology, with family financial information submitted to the CSS Profile. The financial aid office also works closely with the donor relations division of university advancement to ensure that our donors' wishes are met when matching funds to students. All donors of endowed awards are provided with a ""scholarship agreement"" outlining the university's understanding of the donor's intent. These agreements must be approved by both the director of financial aid, and the vice-chancellor for advancement, to ensure that the university has the capability to identify appropriate recipients. In addition to institutionally funded grants and scholarships, TCU manages and accepts fiduciary responsibility for a variety of federal and state funded financial aid programs. Eligibility for all federal and state funded financial aid is based solely on the results of the FAFSA, using required Federal Methodology. Prior to disbursement, each recipient must pass a variety of edit checks, or ""disbursement rules"" to ensure that the student is enrolled in classes and has submitted all required documentation needed to satisfy program eligibility. After disbursement, student aid recipients are reviewed at the end of the 100% tuition refund period for a final enrollment status determination. Students who received aid based on projected full-time enrollment, but who have dropped below 12 credit hours, are subject to an adjustment of their aid package. At the end of the 25%, and final refund period, students are again reviewed and subject to aid adjustment based on final costs for the term. Aid recipients are monitored on a regular basis throughout the academic year. Files are reviewed weekly to identify updated FAFSA and Profile applications, and adjustments are made when required. Reports are submitted to the Texas higher education coordinating board periodically for review of state aid recipients, and the university is subject to periodic audits and reviews from both entities. Academic success is the ultimate goal of all aid programs, and satisfactory academic progress is reviewed at the end of each term. At a minimum, full-time students are required to complete at least 75% of attempted hours and obtain a 2.00 GPA to meet renewal requirements. Most TCU funded awards require a minimum GPA of 2.50. Academic scholarships require a 3.25 GPA. Once posted to student accounts, the office of student financial services also monitors award amounts in relation to specific charges.
