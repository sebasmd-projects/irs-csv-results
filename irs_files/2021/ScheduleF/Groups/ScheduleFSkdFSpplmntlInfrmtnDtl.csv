The EFC is subtracted from the total cost of attendance to equal the financial aid eligibility. The financial aid grant amount is determined based on consistently applied packaging formulas to meet the full calculated need of each student.

Staff who will be awarding financial aid grant funds are trained to adhere to these policies and procedures. The financial aid grant information is transferred from PowerFAIDS to the student information system, Ellucian Colleague, via a regularly scheduled interface. When all institutional grant disbursement requirements are met, the funds are disbursed to the student account in Colleague. The funds are credited against any billed charges that have been previously posted.

If any of this information is not available, the pass-through entity shall provide the best information available to describe the Federal award. The subrecipient is advised of requirements imposed by governing laws, regulations, and provisions of contracts or grant agreements and supplemental requirements imposed by the pass-through entity. The subrecipient's activities are monitored to ensure awards are used for authorized purposes in compliance with laws, regulations, and the provisions of contracts or grant agreements and performance goals are achieved. Assurance is ascertained that any subrecipient expending $750,000 or more in Federal awards during the subrecipient's fiscal year must meet the audit requirements of Uniform Grant Guidance (formerly OMB A-133). A management decision on audit findings must be issued within six months after receipt of the subrecipient's audit report and ensure that the subrecipient takes appropriate and timely corrective action. A determination is made as to whether subrecipient audits necessitate adjustment of the pass-through entity's own records. Each subrecipient is required to permit the pass-through entity and auditors to have access to the records and financial statements as necessary for the pass-through entity to comply with this part. POST-AWARD SUBRECIPIENT MONITORING: The Principal Investigator (PI) or Program Director (PD) is responsible for monitoring the activities. The subrecipient should submit progress reports, technical reports and other deliverables to the PI/PD by specified due dates. The PI/PD is responsible for forwarding copies of the subrecipient's report(s) to the Office of Sponsored Programs and Research (OSPR). Subrecipient invoices submitted to the university must contain the following information: invoice on subcontractor's letterhead, date of invoice, invoice number, period of performance covered by the invoice, itemized description of services and backup documentation, current period costs including cost sharing, cumulative project costs and subrecipient contact person with respect to invoice. Invoice must be signed by an authorized official of the subcontractor and must contain a certification that all payments requested are for appropriate purposes and in accordance with the agreements set forth in the application and award documents. The PI/PD is responsible for reviewing and approving invoices from subrecipient(s) for adherence to the budget and submitting invoices for payment in Smart Buy Plus. Grant Accounting will review the subrecipient's invoice(s) for the following: period of performance is within the contract period, appropriate invoice format and level of detail, signature by authorized subrecipient representatives, evidence of cost sharing, if applicable, and availability of funding. Grant Accounting is responsible for ensuring that subrecipients that expend $750,000 or more of Federal funds each fiscal year submit an Audit Certification Letter along with a copy of subrecipient's audited financial statements. The following is required to close out a subrecipient award: receipt of final invoice, receipt of cost share documentation, if applicable, time and effort certifications, final progress and technical reports, annual audit certification letter. Grant Accounting is responsible for tracking payments made to individuals or organizations and where payments are sent when outside of the US as required by the Schedules F and I - Form 990. EDUCATIONAL ASSISTANCE: Educational assistance is awarded based on financial need and merit. Need based assistance is awarded after review of the student's FAFSA, tax return information, W-2 statements, and other relevant financial documents. Students are required to maintain satisfactory academic progress in order to continue to be eligible for need based assistance. Students' Grade Point Averages and earned units are reviewed each academic year to ensure satisfactory academic progress is achieved. Merit based educational assistance is awarded to students via Committee. Students who are awarded merit based assistance are required to maintain satisfactory academic progress in accordance with the terms of the assistance received.

If any of this information is not available, the pass-through entity shall provide the best information available to describe the Federal award. The subrecipient is advised of requirements imposed by governing laws, regulations, and provisions of contracts or grant agreements and supplemental requirements imposed by the pass-through entity. The subrecipient's activities are monitored to ensure awards are used for authorized purposes in compliance with laws, regulations, and the provisions of contracts or grant agreements and performance goals are achieved. Assurance is ascertained that any subrecipient expending $750,000 or more in Federal awards during the subrecipient's fiscal year must meet the audit requirements of Uniform Grant Guidance (formerly OMB A-133). A management decision on audit findings must be issued within six months after receipt of the subrecipient's audit report and ensure that the subrecipient takes appropriate and timely corrective action. A determination is made as to whether subrecipient audits necessitate adjustment of the pass-through entity's own records. Each subrecipient is required to permit the pass-through entity and auditors to have access to the records and financial statements as necessary for the pass-through entity to comply with this part. POST-AWARD SUBRECIPIENT MONITORING: The Principal Investigator (PI) or Program Director (PD) is responsible for monitoring the activities. The subrecipient should submit progress reports, technical reports and other deliverables to the PI/PD by specified due dates. The PI/PD is responsible for forwarding copies of the subrecipient's report(s) to the Office of Sponsored Programs and Research (OSPR). Subrecipient invoices submitted to the university must contain the following information: invoice on subcontractor's letterhead, date of invoice, invoice number, period of performance covered by the invoice, itemized description of services and backup documentation, current period costs including cost sharing, cumulative project costs and subrecipient contact person with respect to invoice. Invoice must be signed by an authorized official of the subcontractor and must contain a certification that all payments requested are for appropriate purposes and in accordance with the agreements set forth in the application and award documents. The PI/PD is responsible for reviewing and approving invoices from subrecipient(s) for adherence to the budget and submitting invoices for payment in Smart Buy Plus. Grant Accounting will review the subrecipient's invoice(s) for the following: period of performance is within the contract period, appropriate invoice format and level of detail, signature by authorized subrecipient representatives, evidence of cost sharing, if applicable, and availability of funding. Grant Accounting is responsible for ensuring that subrecipients that expend $750,000 or more of Federal funds each fiscal year submit an Audit Certification Letter along with a copy of subrecipient's audited financial statements. The following is required to close out a subrecipient award: receipt of final invoice, receipt of cost share documentation, if applicable, time and effort certifications, final progress and technical reports, annual audit certification letter. Grant Accounting is responsible for tracking payments made to individuals or organizations and where payments are sent when outside of the US as required by the Schedules F and I - Form 990. EDUCATIONAL ASSISTANCE: Educational assistance is awarded based on financial need and merit. Need based assistance is awarded after review of the student's FAFSA, tax return information, W-2 statements, and other relevant financial documents. Students are required to maintain satisfactory academic progress in order to continue to be eligible for need based assistance. Students' Grade Point Averages and earned units are reviewed each academic year to ensure satisfactory academic progress is achieved. Merit based educational assistance is awarded to students via Committee. Students who are awarded merit based assistance are required to maintain satisfactory academic progress in accordance with the terms of the assistance received. Need and merit based educational assistance are funded directly to the student's accounts receivable balance to offset tuition, fees, and room and board. Any resulting refunds are issued to the student. Students are granted research awards by their academic departments and work with faculty advisors who monitor the research performed by the student."

Financial aid is an important factor for many students, and 100 percent of eligible Manchester University students receive some combination of grants, scholarships, loans, and work. Student Financial Services will determine a student's eligibility for financial aid by using the results of the Free Application for Federal Student Aid (FAFSA); the estimated family contribution (EFC) and review of edit (c-codes), as well as the student's academic records and funds available. Manchester University utilizes an awarding matrix based on a combination of academic and financial need criteria referenced above. Student Financial Services administers financial aid from federal, state, and institutional resources utilizing the federal guidelines established by the U.S. Department of Education. The following steps must be taken by a student to receive a financial aid package from Manchester University: 1. Apply for admission and be admitted to Manchester University. Eligibility for academic scholarships from the University is determined through the admission process. 2. Submit a FAFSA. Eligibility for federal, state and institutional need based grants and loans is determined through this process.
