It also houses the theatre department. In support of the mission of the college, the focus of new acquisitions is largely but not exclusively works by women artists on paper. Artwork is selected and donations accepted with consideration to how they will benefit the campus learning environment. The collection is actively used within the arts curriculum and across disciplines. The art department offers three undergraduate majors, including studio art and art history, to students. In addition, students write visual analyses of works and five tours to the public. Informative wall text is researched and written by students under the guidance of faculty. Works by Agnes Scott students are embraced into the overall display, including a vibrant body of self-portrait woodblock prints that are sited in dorms and public buildings. Furthermore, along with a student show, the gallery presents two exhibits a year which include a roster of local, national, and international professional artists and are organized around an inclusive theme that engages contemporary issues, focusing not only on the world of art but also on the larger global conversation.

These exhibits and programs are an exciting learning resource for students and the academic community. The Hood offers a vital curricular resource, a source for lectures, gallery talks, symposia, and receptions for the public, and an on-line database of thousands of works. The Dartmouth College Library is committed to partnering with faculty and students to enhance and showcase Dartmouth scholarly output and entrepreneurial endeavors. The Library provides immersive and transformative learning experiences, prepares students for a lifetime of learning and responsible leadership, and proactively supports undergraduate, graduate, and professional student academic success through innovative educational programs. The Library offers creative workspaces for individual and collaborative scholarly enquiry and aims to promote well-being as well as stimulate innovative thinking. The Rauner Special Collections Library houses Dartmouth's Archives, the Rare Books Collections, and the Manuscripts Collection.

ASC 740 addresses the accounting for uncertainty in income taxes recognized in an entity's financial statements and prescribes a threshold of more-likely-than-not for recognition and derecognition of tax positions taken or expected to be taken in a tax return. The adoption of ASC 740 by Bon Secours Mercy Health, Inc. on September 1, 2007 did not have a material impact on BSMH's consolidated financial statements. As the organization does not conduct a separate audit of its financial statements, below is the related statement from the Bon Secours Mercy Health, Inc. consolidated audited financial statements: The Company and most of its subsidiaries (including certain joint venture entities) are exempt from federal income taxes under Section 501(c)(3) of the Internal Revenue Code of 1986, as amended.Their related income is exempt from federal income tax under Section 501(A). Some of the subsidiaries are taxable entities, and some of the income of the tax-exempt entities is subject to taxation as unrelated business taxable income. The Company and its subsidiaries file U.S. federal income tax returns, and they also file in various state and foreign jurisdictions. The Company accounts for uncertain tax positions in accordance with ASC Topic 740, Income Taxes.The Company accounts for uncertainty in income tax positions by applying a recognition threshold and measurement attribute for financial statement recognition and measurement of a tax position taken or expected to be taken in a tax return. The Company has determined that no significant unrecognized tax benefits or liabilities exist as of December 31, 2019. Accounting for uncertainty in income taxes, ASC Topic 740-10 prescribes a comprehensive model for how an organization should measure, recognize, present and disclose in its financial statements uncertain tax positions that an organization has taken or expects to take on a tax return. The Company is subject to routine audits by taxing jurisdictions. An Internal Revenue Service audit of Mercy for 2016 and 2017 tax periods was completed in July 2019. There are no current audits in progress. The Company believes it is no longer subject to income tax examinations for years prior to 2014. As of December 31, 2019, the Company has no uncertain tax positions. The Company's taxable subsidiaries had $205,170 and $169,666 of net operating loss carryforwards as of December 31, 2019 and 2018, respectively, which expire in varying periods through 2037 and are available to offset future taxable income. The Company accounts for income taxes under the asset and liability method. Under this method, deferred tax assets and liabilities are recognized for the estimated future tax consequences attributable to differences between the financial statement carrying amounts of existing assets and liabilities and their respective tax bases. Deferred tax assets and liabilities are measured using enacted tax rates expected to be in effect during the year in which those temporary differences are expected to be recovered or settled. The effect on deferred tax assets and liabilities of a change in tax rates is recognized in income in the period that includes the enactment date. Interest and penalties related to income taxes are accounted for as income tax expense. The Company's deferred tax assets are fully reserved as of December 31, 2019 and 2018 as the Company considers it more likely than not that these amounts will not be recognized."

It also houses the theatre department. In support of the mission of the college, the focus of new acquisitions is largely but not exclusively works by women artists on paper. Artwork is selected and donations accepted with consideration to how they will benefit the campus learning environment. The collection is actively used within the arts curriculum and across disciplines. The art department offers three undergraduate majors, including studio art and art history, to students. In addition, students write visual analyses of works and five tours to the public. Informative wall text is researched and written by students under the guidance of faculty. Works by Agnes Scott students are embraced into the overall display, including a vibrant body of self-portrait woodblock prints that are sited in dorms and public buildings. Furthermore, along with a student show, the gallery presents two exhibits a year which include a roster of local, national, and international professional artists and are organized around an inclusive theme that engages contemporary issues, focusing not only on the world of art but also on the larger global conversation.

ASC 740 addresses the accounting for uncertainty in income taxes recognized in an entity's financial statements and prescribes a threshold of more-likely-than-not for recognition and derecognition of tax positions taken or expected to be taken in a tax return. The adoption of ASC 740 by Bon Secours Mercy Health, Inc. on September 1, 2007 did not have a material impact on BSMH's consolidated financial statements. As the organization does not conduct a separate audit of its financial statements, below is the related statement from the Bon Secours Mercy Health, Inc. consolidated audited financial statements: The Company and most of its subsidiaries (including certain joint venture entities) are exempt from federal income taxes under Section 501(c)(3) of the Internal Revenue Code of 1986, as amended.Their related income is exempt from federal income tax under Section 501(A). Some of the subsidiaries are taxable entities, and some of the income of the tax-exempt entities is subject to taxation as unrelated business taxable income. The Company and its subsidiaries file U.S. federal income tax returns, and they also file in various state and foreign jurisdictions. The Company accounts for uncertain tax positions in accordance with ASC Topic 740, Income Taxes.The Company accounts for uncertainty in income tax positions by applying a recognition threshold and measurement attribute for financial statement recognition and measurement of a tax position taken or expected to be taken in a tax return. The Company has determined that no significant unrecognized tax benefits or liabilities exist as of December 31, 2019. Accounting for uncertainty in income taxes, ASC Topic 740-10 prescribes a comprehensive model for how an organization should measure, recognize, present and disclose in its financial statements uncertain tax positions that an organization has taken or expects to take on a tax return. The Company is subject to routine audits by taxing jurisdictions. An Internal Revenue Service audit of Mercy for 2016 and 2017 tax periods was completed in July 2019. There are no current audits in progress. The Company believes it is no longer subject to income tax examinations for years prior to 2014. As of December 31, 2019, the Company has no uncertain tax positions. The Company's taxable subsidiaries had $205,170 and $169,666 of net operating loss carryforwards as of December 31, 2019 and 2018, respectively, which expire in varying periods through 2037 and are available to offset future taxable income. The Company accounts for income taxes under the asset and liability method. Under this method, deferred tax assets and liabilities are recognized for the estimated future tax consequences attributable to differences between the financial statement carrying amounts of existing assets and liabilities and their respective tax bases. Deferred tax assets and liabilities are measured using enacted tax rates expected to be in effect during the year in which those temporary differences are expected to be recovered or settled. The effect on deferred tax assets and liabilities of a change in tax rates is recognized in income in the period that includes the enactment date. Interest and penalties related to income taxes are accounted for as income tax expense. The Company's deferred tax assets are fully reserved as of December 31, 2019 and 2018 as the Company considers it more likely than not that these amounts will not be recognized."

THE COLLECTION IS AN IMPORTANT RESOURCE FOR THE HARVARD UNIVERSITY COMMUNITY, AS WELL AS TO A BROADER AUDIENCE OF STUDENTS, SCHOLARS, AND THE GENERAL PUBLIC. IT IS USED TO ADVANCE THE KNOWLEDGE AND APPRECIATION OF ART AND ART MUSEUMS THROUGH PROGRAMS INVOLVING RESEARCH, TEACHING, PROFESSIONAL TRAINING, AND PUBLIC EDUCATION. ARNOLD ARBORETUM: THE ARNOLD ARBORETUM OF HARVARD UNIVERSITY IS THE OLDEST PUBLIC ARBORETUM IN NORTH AMERICA AND ONE OF THE WORLD'S LEADING CENTERS FOR THE STUDY OF PLANTS. ADMINISTERED BY THE OFFICE OF THE PROVOST OF HARVARD UNIVERSITY AND A LINK IN BOSTON'S EMERALD NECKLACE OF PARKS, THE ARNOLD ARBORETUM IS A UNIQUE BLEND OF RESPECTED RESEARCH INSTITUTION AND BELOVED PUBLIC LANDSCAPE. WE PROVIDE AND SUPPORT WORLD-CLASS RESEARCH, HORTICULTURE, AND EDUCATION PROGRAMS THAT FOSTER THE UNDERSTANDING, APPRECIATION, AND PRESERVATION OF TREES. COLLECTION OF HISTORICAL SCIENTIFIC INSTRUMENTS: HARVARD UNIVERSITY HAS BEEN ACQUIRING SCIENTIFIC INSTRUMENTS ON A CONTINUOUS BASIS FOR TEACHING AND RESEARCH SINCE 1672. THE COLLECTION OF HISTORICAL SCIENTIFIC INSTRUMENTS, WHICH WAS ESTABLISHED IN 1948 TO PRESERVE THIS APPARATUS AS A RESOURCE FOR TEACHING AND RESEARCH IN THE HISTORY OF SCIENCE AND TECHNOLOGY, HAS BECOME ONE OF THE THREE LARGEST UNIVERSITY COLLECTIONS OF ITS KIND IN THE WORLD. IT CONTAINS OVER 20,000 OBJECTS DATING FROM ABOUT 1400 TO THE PRESENT. A BROAD RANGE OF SCIENTIFIC DISCIPLINES ARE REPRESENTED, INCLUDING ASTRONOMY, NAVIGATION, HOROLOGY, SURVEYING, GEOLOGY, CALCULATING, PHYSICS, BIOLOGY, MEDICINE, PSYCHOLOGY, ELECTRICITY, AND COMMUNICATION. SIGNIFICANT INSTRUMENTS, MADE OBSOLETE BY NEW TECHNOLOGIES, CONTINUE TO BE INCORPORATED. MANY OF THE DOCUMENTS DETAILING THE PURCHASE AND USE OF THE INSTRUMENTS HAVE BEEN PRESERVED, AND ARE AVAILABLE FOR RESEARCH IN THE COLLECTION'S ADJUNCT LIBRARY. MUSEUM OF COMPARATIVE ZOOLOGY (WITHIN THE MUSEUM OF NATURAL HISTORY): THE MUSEUM OF COMPARATIVE ZOOLOGY (THE MCZ) WAS FOUNDED IN 1859 ON THE CONCEPT THAT COLLECTIONS ARE AN INTEGRAL AND FUNDAMENTAL COMPONENT OF ZOOLOGICAL RESEARCH AND TEACHING. THIS 150-YEAR-OLD COMMITMENT REMAINS A STRONG AND PROUD TRADITION FOR THE MCZ. THE PRESENT-DAY MCZ CONTAINS OVER 21 MILLION SPECIMENS IN TEN RESEARCH COLLECTIONS WHICH COMPRISE ONE OF THE WORLD'S RICHEST AND MOST VARIED RESOURCES FOR STUDYING THE DIVERSITY OF LIFE. THE MUSEUM SERVES AS THE PRIMARY REPOSITORY FOR ZOOLOGICAL SPECIMENS COLLECTED BY PAST AND PRESENT HARVARD FACULTY-CURATORS, STAFF AND ASSOCIATES CONDUCTING RESEARCH AROUND THE WORLD. AS A PREMIER UNIVERSITY MUSEUM AND RESEARCH INSTITUTION, THE SPECIMENS AND THEIR RELATED DATA ARE AVAILABLE TO RESEARCHERS OF THE SCIENTIFIC AND MUSEUM COMMUNITY. USE OF THE COLLECTIONS IN STUDENT RESEARCH IS ALSO ENCOURAGED. FISHER MUSEUM HARVARD FOREST: THE FISHER MUSEUM'S MAIN EXHIBIT DISPLAYS TWENTY-THREE INTERNATIONALLY ACCLAIMED MODELS (DIORAMAS) PORTRAYING THE HISTORY, CONSERVATION AND MANAGEMENT OF CENTRAL NEW ENGLAND FORESTS. OTHER EXHIBITS AT THE MUSEUM REPRESENT THE RANGE OF HARVARD FOREST'S RESEARCH. HARVARD UNIVERSITY HERBARIA (WITHIN MUSEUM OF NATURAL HISTORY): THE HARVARD UNIVERSITY HERBARIA ARE AMONG SOME SEVERAL THOUSAND COLLECTIONS OF PRESSED, DRIED PLANT SPECIMENS WORLDWIDE THAT ARE USED BY RESEARCHERS TO FURTHER OUR UNDERSTANDING OF THE PLANT WORLD. SOME OF THE EARLIEST HERBARIA WERE FOUNDED IN EUROPE IN THE EARLY 1600'S, DURING THE DAYS OF EXPLORATION, WHEN KNOWLEDGE OF THE EARTH'S FLORA WAS GROWING AT SUCH A RAPID PACE THAT BOTANICAL GARDENS COULD NO LONGER MAINTAIN LIVING EXAMPLES OF EVERY KNOWN SPECIES. WHILE HERBARIUM COLLECTIONS OF ALL SIZES EXIST TODAY, THERE ARE FEWER THAN 75 HERBARIA WORLDWIDE WITH MORE THAN ONE MILLION SPECIMENS. HERBARIUM COLLECTIONS HAVE BEEN BUILT BY THE EFFORTS OF NUMEROUS BOTANISTS AND PLANT COLLECTORS WHO SEARCHED FROM REMOTE AND ISOLATED JUNGLES TO INNER CITY WASTE LOTS AND RAILROAD TRACKS TO DOCUMENT THE DIVERSITY AND DISTRIBUTION OF THE EARTH'S FLORA. REPRESENTATIVES OF MOST KNOWN SPECIES OF PLANTS CAN BE FOUND IN HERBARIA TODAY, CAREFULLY MOUNTED ON SHEETS OF ARCHIVAL QUALITY PAPER, LABELED WITH IMPORTANT INFORMATION ABOUT THEM, AND STORED ON SHELVES IN CABINETS. IN ESSENCE, A HERBARIUM IS ANALOGOUS TO A LIBRARY OF CAREFULLY PRESERVED PLANTS WHERE THE SPECIMENS THEMSELVES AND THE LABELS ASSOCIATED WITH THEM PROVIDE A WEALTH OF INFORMATION ONCE THEY HAVE BEEN ""READ"" AND STUDIED BY SCIENTISTS. THE SPECIMENS ARE THE KEY TO UNDERSTANDING PLANT RELATIONSHIPS, GEOGRAPHIC DISTRIBUTIONS, ECONOMIC USEFULNESS, EVEN THEIR MOLECULAR MAKEUP. AS WE LOSE NATURAL HABITATS THE WORLD OVER, HERBARIA INCREASINGLY SERVE AS A RECORD OF THE RECENT HISTORY OF PLANT LIFE, AND AS A REPOSITORY OF PRECIOUS GENETIC INFORMATION. HERBARIA HOLD THE TOOLS FOR OUR UNDERSTANDING OF THE PLANT WORLD. MINERALOGICAL AND GEOLOGICAL MUSEUM (WITHIN MUSEUM OF NATURAL HISTORY): THE HARVARD MINERAL COLLECTION RANKS AMONG THE WORLD'S FINEST DUE TO ITS VERY BROAD REPRESENTATION, WEALTH OF RARE SPECIES; LARGE NUMBER OF SPECIMENS DESCRIBED IN THE SCIENTIFIC LITERATURE; AND THE QUALITY OF ITS DISPLAY SPECIMENS. A RICH SYSTEMATIC MINERAL COLLECTION AND DISPLAYS OF GEMSTONES ARE THE PRINCIPAL EXHIBITS IN THE MINERAL GALLERY. THE MUSEUM IS COMMITTED TO THE DEVELOPMENT AND PRESERVATION OF WORLD-CLASS COLLECTIONS OF MINERALS, GEMS, ROCKS, ORES, AND METEORITES FOR RESEARCH, EDUCATION, AND PUBLIC DISPLAY. ITS EARLIEST COLLECTIONS DATE BACK TO THE LATE 18TH CENTURY. THE MUSEUM CATERS TO THE HARVARD STUDENTS AND FACULTY AS WELL AS THE GEOLOGICAL COMMUNITY AT LARGE BY SERVING AS A UNIQUELY RICH RESOURCE OF MATERIALS AND INFORMATION. PEABODY MUSEUM OF ARCHAEOLOGY AND ETHNOLOGY: THE PEABODY MUSEUM OF ARCHAEOLOGY AND ETHNOLOGY IS STEWARD TO ONE OF THE OLDEST AND LARGEST COLLECTIONS OF CULTURAL OBJECTS IN THE WESTERN HEMISPHERE. SINCE THE LATE NINETEENTH CENTURY, THE MUSEUM HAS PLAYED AN ACTIVE PART IN THE HISTORY OF AMERICAN ANTHROPOLOGY AND IN THE EVOLVING RELATIONSHIP BETWEEN MUSEUMS AND NATIVE PEOPLES. THE PEABODY STRIVES TO MAKE COLLECTIONS WIDELY ACCESSIBLE AND ENGAGE ISSUES OF CONCERN TO DIVERSE AUDIENCES. TODAY, THE PEABODY HOUSES MORE THAN SIX MILLION INDIVIDUAL OBJECTS, 500,000 PHOTOGRAPHIC IMAGES, AND SUBSTANTIAL ARCHIVAL RECORDS. STRONGEST IN THE CULTURES OF NORTH, CENTRAL, AND SOUTH AMERICA, AND THE PACIFIC ISLANDS, THE PEABODY IS ALSO CARETAKER TO IMPORTANT COLLECTIONS FROM AFRICA, EUROPE, AND ASIA. COLLECTION TYPES INCLUDE ARCHAEOLOGY; ETHNOGRAPHY; OSTEOLOGY; AND PAINTING, DRAWING, AND PRINTS. SEMITIC MUSEUM: THE SEMITIC MUSEUM IS HOME TO THE UNIVERSITY'S COLLECTIONS OF NEAR EASTERN ARCHAEOLOGICAL ARTIFACTS. THESE ARTIFACTS COMPRISE OVER 40,000 ITEMS, INCLUDING POTTERY, CYLINDER SEALS, SCULPTURE, COINS AND CUNEIFORM TABLETS. MANY ARE FROM MUSEUM-SPONSORED EXCAVATIONS IN ISRAEL, JORDAN, IRAQ, EGYPT, CYPRUS, AND TUNISIA. THE MUSEUM IS DEDICATED TO THE USE OF THESE COLLECTIONS FOR THE TEACHING, RESEARCH, AND PUBLICATION OF NEAR EASTERN ARCHAEOLOGY, HISTORY, AND CULTURE. WARREN ANATOMICAL MUSEUM: THE WARREN ANATOMICAL MUSEUM'S PRESENT COLLECTION CONTAINS APPROXIMATELY 15,000 ARTIFACTS AND CASES INCLUDING: ANATOMICAL AND PATHOLOGICAL PREPARATIONS; VARIOUS WAX, PAPER MACHE, AND DRY PREPARATION ANATOMICAL MODELS; PHOTOGRAPHS, PRINTS, PAINTINGS, AND DRAWINGS; MEDICAL INSTRUMENTS AND MACHINES; AND OTHER MEDICAL MEMORABILIA. ALONG WITH THE WELL-KNOWN SKULL OF PHINEAS GAGE, THE MUSEUM HOLDS MANY OTHER RARE AND INTERESTING ITEMS. AMONG THESE ARE THE PHRENOLOGICAL COLLECTION OF JOHANN GASPAR SPURZHEIM, THE BOSTON SOCIETY FOR MEDICAL IMPROVEMENT COLLECTION, AND A W. T. G. MORTON-TYPE ETHER INHALER. THE MUSEUM PROMOTES THE COLLECTION FOR THE PURPOSES OF MEDICAL EDUCATION IN ALL FORMS WHENEVER POSSIBLE, BY EXPANDING ITS SCOPE TO PROVIDE PUBLIC PROGRAMMING AND EDUCATIONAL RESOURCES TO THE LARGER COMMUNITY. CARPENTER CENTER FOR THE VISUAL ARTS: CARPENTER CENTER FOR THE VISUAL ARTS IS DEDICATED TO THE SYNTHESIS OF ART, DESIGN, AND EDUCATION THROUGH THE EXHIBITION OF EXISTING WORKS AND PRODUCTION OF NEW COMMISSIONS. IT STRIVES TO BRING PEOPLE, IDEAS, AND OBJECTS TOGETHER IN GENERATIVE WAYS THAT PROVIDE UNPARALLELED EXPERIENCES WITH CONTEMPORARY ART, ULTIMATELY ENRICHING THE CREATIVE AND INTELLECTUAL LIVES OF THEIR AUDIENCES."

All the collections are open to the public. The Yale University Art Gallery: The Yale University Art Gallery, founded in 1832, is the oldest U.S. college art museum. The gallery houses more than 250,000 objects representing Eastern and Western cultures and ranging in date from ancient times to the present day. The collection includes ancient art, Asian art, African art, Indo-Pacific art, prints and drawings, photographs, numismatics, works of European and American masters from virtually every period, and a rich collection of modern and contemporary art. The mission of the Yale University Art Gallery is to encourage appreciation and understanding of art and its role in society through direct engagement with original works of art. The gallery stimulates active learning about art and the creative process through research, teaching, and dialogue among communities of Yale students, faculty, artists, scholars, alumni, and the wider public. The Gallery organizes exhibitions and educational programs to offer enjoyment and encourage inquiry, while building and maintaining its collections in trust for future generations. The Yale Center for British Art: The Yale Center for British Art is a public art museum and research institute for the study of British art and culture. The Yale Center for British Art, which opened in 1977, houses the largest and most comprehensive collection of British art outside the United Kingdom. The collection of paintings, sculpture, prints, drawings, watercolors, rare books, and manuscripts reflects the development of British art and culture from the Elizabethan period onward. The Center offers a year-round schedule of exhibitions and programs, including talks and lectures, conferences, films, concerts, and performances. The Yale Center for British Art oversees an active research program through which it promotes and fosters the scholarship of all aspects of British art and material culture. Academic resources of the center include the Reference Library and Archives, conservation laboratories, a study room for examining works on paper as well as rare books and manuscripts from the collection, and an online catalogue of the collections. Peabody Museum: Yale's Peabody Museum of Natural History, founded in 1866, is one of the oldest and largest university-based natural history museums with worldwide acclaim for its dinosaur skeletons, mammal displays, and natural history collections. The Peabody Museum houses more than 13 million specimens and artifacts representing more than 4 billion years of geological, biological, and human history. These collections are at the heart of university teaching and are a resource for scholars at Yale and around the world. Museums and the expertise that surrounds them are vibrant elements of Yale's culture of scholarship and teaching. The Peabody is a working museum, where public exhibition, research, conservation, teaching, and learning intersect. Its mission is to serve the University by advancing the understanding of earth's history through geological, biological, and anthropological research, and by communicating the results of this research to the widest possible audience through publication, exhibition, and educational programs. Fundamental to this mission is stewardship of the Museum's rich collections, which provide a remarkable record of the history of the earth, its life, and its cultures. Conservation, augmentation and use of these collections become increasingly urgent as modern threats to the diversity of life and culture continue to intensify. The Museum's collections are a major component of the research and teaching activities of the Peabody and Yale. The Yale Peabody Museum Office of Student Programs supports Yale student participation in the activities of the Museum across all of its departments and divisions. In addition, each year the Yale Peabody Museum provides educational programs on biology, paleontology, geology, ancient civilizations, and social studies to more than 25,000 students from Connecticut, Massachusetts, New York, and Rhode Island. All programs draw on the Museum's exhibits to meet the increasingly sophisticated needs of science and social studies education, and most can be adapted to accommodate specific group needs as requested. The Museum's collections are available to legitimate researchers at established institutions for scholarly use. Collection of Musical Instruments: Established in 1900, the Collection of Musical Instruments today comprises nearly one thousand instruments, the majority documenting the history of Western art music. It is committed to fostering an understanding and appreciation of musical instruments from all cultures and periods. One of the foremost institutions of its kind, the Collection acquires, preserves, and exhibits musical instruments from antiquity to the present, featuring restored examples in demonstration and live performance. It provides access to and disseminates information about its holdings to Yale students, faculty, and staff; to scholars, musicians, and instrument makers; and to the broader public. An important resource for the music curricula of the University, the Collection serves as a laboratory for courses in the history of musical instruments and as a supplemental archive for courses taught in the arts and sciences. The Collection maintains regular public visiting hours, mounts exhibits, and presents an annual series of concerts. Lectures, tours, and special concerts are offered throughout the year. In recent years the Collection has undertaken an active program of digitization of the objects themselves and supporting documentation. This information is stored in the Museum's database, and much of it is now available on the online Digital Collection. Yale University Library: In addition to its museums, the Yale University Library provides outstanding support for teaching, learning, research and practice at the University, and for the world-wide scholarly community, through its staff, collections, programs, spaces, and services. The collection of nearly 15 million print and electronic volumes is housed in 15 libraries, including Sterling Memorial, Beinecke, and Bass libraries, the Center for Science and Social Science Information, as well as many other school and departmental libraries. Collections range from ancient papyri and early printed books to digital collections and electronic databases; and they transcend a wide array of formats including text, photographs, video, audio, data, maps, and ephemera. In building the magnificent collections over the last three centuries, Yale made a stewardship commitment to assist in the preservation of human knowledge. The Library also has a responsibility to bring digital resources to the Yale community and to address the challenges of digital preservation."

This standard provides that the tax effects from an uncertain tax position can be recognized in the consolidated financial statements only if the position is ""more-likely-than-not"" to be sustained if the position were to be challenged by a taxing authority. The assessment of the tax position is based solely on the technical merits of the position, without regard to the likelihood that the tax position may be challenged. The College is exempt from Federal and New York State income taxation by virtue of being an organization described in Section 501(c)(3) of the IRC and similar provisions of the New York State tax code.

The accounting standard on accounting for uncertainty in income taxes addresses the determination of whether tax benefits claimed or expected to be claimed on a tax return should be recorded in the financial statements. Under this guidance, the College may recognize the tax benefit from an uncertain tax position only if it is more likely than not that the tax position will be sustained on examination by taxing authorities, based on the technical merits of the position. Examples of tax positions include the tax-exempt status of the College and various positions related to the potential sources of unrelated business taxable income. The tax benefits recognized in the financial statements from such a position are measured based on the largest benefit that has a greater than 50 percent likelihood of being realized upon ultimate settlement. The guidance on accounting for uncertainty in income taxes also addresses de-recognition, classification, interest and penalties on income taxes, and accounting in interim periods. There were no unrecognized tax benefits identified or recorded as liabilities during the periods covered by these financial statements. The College files Form 990 in the U.S. federal jurisdiction and the State of Illinois.

U.S. generally accepted accounting principles require that the asset and liability method of accounting for income taxes be utilized by these organizations and for unrelated business activities of the tax-exempt entities included in Northwell's consolidated financial statements. Under the asset and liability method, deferred income taxes are recognized for the tax consequences of temporary differences by applying enacted statutory tax rates applicable to future years to differences between the financial statement carrying amounts and the tax basis of existing assets and liabilities. At December 31, 2019 and 2018, Northwell has a deferred tax asset of approximately $112,000,000 and $118,000,000, respectively, both of which have been fully offset by a related valuation allowance. A valuation allowance is provided when it is more likely than not that some portion or all of the deferred tax asset will not be realized. Significant components of the deferred tax asset relate to net operating loss (NOL) carryforwards. Certain entities have NOL carryforwards aggregating approximately $540,000,000 at December 31, 2019.

The endowment includes both donor-restricted endowment funds and funds designated by the Board of Trustees to function as endowments (board-designated endowment funds). In accordance with GAAP, net assets associated with endowment funds are classified and reported based on the existence or absence of donor-imposed restrictions. The College has interpreted Ohio's enacted version of UPMIFA as requiring the preservation of the fair value of the original gift as of the gift date absent explicit donor instructions to the contrary. The College classifies as permanently restricted net assets the original gift value plus the value of subsequent gifts to the permanent endowment. The permanent endowment is not reduced by losses on the investments, except to the extent required by the donor, or by appropriations from the endowment fund. The accumulated portion of a donor-restricted fund that is not permanently restricted is classified as temporarily restricted net assets until appropriated for expenditure by the College in a manner consistent with the standard of prudence prescribed by Ohio's enacted version of UPMIFA. Appropriations from the endowment are used to support scholarships and loans, faculty and academic program support, student awards and prizes, and the general operations of the College."

As such, the College is generally not subject to federal or state income taxes except for amounts derived from unrelated business activities as defined by the IRC. The College adopted the accounting standard on accounting for uncertainty in income taxes, which addresses the determination of whether tax benefits claimed or expected to be claimed on a tax return should be recorded in the financial statements. Under this guidance, the College may recognize the tax benefit from an uncertain tax position only if it is more likely than not that the tax position will be sustained on examination by taxing authorities, based on the technical merits of the position. Examples of tax positions include the tax-exempt status of the College, the continued tax-exempt status of bonds issued by the College, and various positions related to the potential sources of unrelated business taxable income (UBIT). The tax benefits recognized in the financial statements from such a position are measured based on the largest benefit that has a greater than 50 percent likelihood of being realized upon ultimate settlement. The guidance on accounting for uncertainty in income taxes also addresses de-recognition, classification, interest and penalties on income taxes, and accounting in interim periods. At June 30, 2020 and 2019, there were no unrecognized tax benefits identified or recorded as liabilities."

202021969349302227,133297197,"Schedule D, Part III, Line 4 Collections of art - description of collections","The mission of The New School art collection, in recognition of its historic commitment to art as a vehicle for sociopolitical change, is to advance the importance of art as an agent for personal and collective transformation. As a curricular resource for all areas of study, the role of the collection is to conserve, interpret, and present works of art to the students, faculty, and greater community. New acquisitions support the vision of the university as an environment for innovative thinking and artistic experimentation. HISTORY OF THE COLLECTION The university's legacy of supporting the freedom of artistic expression began in 1931 with the commissioning of two historically significant mural cycles: Jose Clemente Orozco's A Call for Revolution and Universal Brotherhood, and Thomas Hart Benton's epic America Today. Over the years, the university has hosted a roster of accomplished artists, writers, dancers, designers, historians, social scientists, and philosophers, creating a flourishing laboratory for experimentation and innovation. As an institution that embraced such diverse figures as poet Robert Frost, anthropologist Margaret Meade, art historian Meyer Schapiro, and composer/conceptual artist John Cage, The New School has always stood at the forefront of self-discovery and visionary social, intellectual, and aesthetic experimentation. The New School art collection was established in 1960 with a grant from the Albert A. List Foundation. The collection, grown to approximately 2,039 postwar and contemporary works of art, includes examples in almost all media by some of the most innovative and creative artists of our time. Installed throughout the university campus and transforming the public spaces into lively forums for examining contemporary art, the collection offers students and faculty a rare opportunity to engage with art on a daily basis, making it a distinctive component of their educational experience. The collection has continued its tradition of incorporating site-specific works into its public spaces."
202021969349302227,133297197,"Schedule D, Part V, Line 4 Intended uses of endowment funds","The university's endowment is composed of approximately 319 individual funds established for a variety of purposes, including scholarships, professorships, faculty development, lectures, and research programs. The endowment consists of both donor restricted endowment funds and funds designated by the board of trustees to function as endowments. Net assets associated with endowment funds, including funds functioning as endowments, are classified and reported based on the existence or absence of donor imposed restrictions. THE UNIVERSITY'S INDIVIDUAL ENDOWMENT FUNDS ARE POOLED FOR INVESTMENT PURPOSES. THE INVESTMENT PORTFOLIO IS MANAGED TO ACHIEVE A PRUDENT LONG TERM RETURN. THE UNIVERSITY RELIES ON A TOTAL RETURN STRATEGY IN WHICH INVESTMENT RETURNS ARE ACHIEVED THROUGH BOTH CAPITAL APPRECIATION (REALIZED AND UNREALIZED) AND CURRENT YIELD (INTEREST AND DIVIDENDS). THE UNIVERSITY TARGETS A DIVERSIFIED ASSET ALLOCATION THAT PLACES A GREATER EMPHASIS ON EQUITY BASED INVESTMENTS TO ACHIEVE ITS LONG TERM RETURN OBJECTIVES WITHIN PRUDENT RISK CONSTRAINTS. THE ENDOWMENT ASSETS ARE INVESTED TO PROVIDE A REAL TOTAL RETURN THAT PRESERVES THE PURCHASING POWER OF THE ENDOWMENT, WHILE GENERATING AN INCOME STREAM TO SUPPORT THE ACADEMIC ACTIVITIES OF THE UNIVERSITY. ACTUAL RETURNS MAY VARY FROM THIS GOAL IN ANY GIVEN YEAR. The university's endowment spending policy is designed to provide a sustainable and predictable flow of funds to support annual operations. The spending policy is intended to balance current spending needs and to preserve the endowment's future purchasing power. The university applies a board specified spending rate to a moving average of endowment investment funds. The purpose of using a moving average is to smooth out any wide fluctuations in the market value. Endowment earnings in excess of the spending rate are added back to the principal of the endowment investments. Prior to fiscal year 2012, the board specified spending rate was 5%. Beginning with fiscal year 2012, the spending rate was reduced to 4% using a ""soft landing"" approach. The fiscal year 2011 appropriation will be used as the annual appropriation until the investment portfolio increases sufficiently over time to result in an effective 4% spending rate. Thereafter, the 4% spending rate would be applied against the average of the previous 16 quarters' fair value of the endowment portfolio."

The assessment of the tax position is based solely on the technical merits of the position, without regard to the likelihood that the tax position may be challenged.

Kiara, Inc. is an Illinois for-profit corporation that recognizes income taxes under the asset-and-liability method. Deferred tax assets and liabilities are recognized for the future tax consequences attributable to differences between the consolidated financial statement carrying amounts of existing assets and liabilities and their respective tax basis and operating loss and tax credit carryforwards. Deferred tax assets and liabilities are measured using the enacted tax rates expected to apply to taxable income in the years in which those temporary differences are expected to be recovered or settled. The effect on deferred tax assets and liabilities of a change in tax rates is recognized in income in the period that includes the enactment date. The net operating loss carryforwards result in a deferred tax asset of $70,000 and $60,575 at June 30, 2019 and 2018, respectively. In assessing the realizability of deferred tax assets, management considers whether it is more likely than not that some portion or all of the deferred tax assets will not be realized. The ultimate realization of deferred tax assets is dependent upon the generation of future taxable income during the periods in which those temporary differences become deductible. Management considers projected future taxable income and tax planning strategies in making this assessment. Based upon the level of historical taxable losses and projections for future taxable losses over the periods for which the deferred tax assets are deductible, management believes it is more likely Kiara, Inc. will not realize the majority of the benefits of these deductible differences. Full valuation allowances have been applied against the deferred tax assets attributable to the net operating loss carryforwards not realized as of June 30, 2019 and 2018 in the accompanying consolidated financial statements due to the uncertainty of realization. HSHS recognizes the tax benefit from an uncertain tax position only if it is more likely than not the tax position will be sustained on examination by the taxing authorities, based on the technical merits of the position. As of June 30, 2019 and 2018, HSHS does not have any liabilities for unrecognized tax benefits."

Under the requirements of FIN 48, tax-exempt organizations could now be required to record an obligation as the result of a tax position they have historically taken or various tax exposure items.

The University files a Form 990 annually. When these returns are filed , it is highly certain that some positions taken would be sustained upon examination by the taxing authorities, while others are subject to uncertainty about the merits of the tax position taken or the amount of the position that would ultimately be sustained. Examples of tax positions common to universities include such matters as the following: the tax exempt status of each entity and various positions relative to potential sources of unrelated business income tax (UBIT). UBIT is reported on Form 990-T, as appropriate. The benefit of a tax position is recognized in the financial statements in the period during which, based on all available evidence, management believes that it is more likely than not that the position will be sustained upon examination, including the resolution of appeals or litigation processes, if any. Tax positions are not offset or aggregated with other positions. Tax positions that meet the ""more likely than not"" recognition threshold are measured as the largest amount of tax benefit that is more than 50% likely to be realized on settlement with the applicable taxing authority. The portion of the benefits associated with tax positions taken that exceeds the amount measured as described above would be reflected as a liability for uncertain tax benefits in the accompanying statements of financial position along with any associated interest and penalties that would be payable to the taxing authorities upon examination. As of June 30, 2019 and 2018, there were no uncertain tax positions identified. The University does not expect the total amount of unrecognized tax benefits to significantly change in the next 12 months. Forms 990 and 990-T filed by the University are subject to the examination by the IRS up to three years from the extended due date of each return. Management believes the Forms 990 and 990-T have been filed appropriately. The University would recognize interest and penalties related to unrecognized tax positions in interest and income tax expense, respectively.

This guidance provides that the tax effects from an uncertain tax position can only be recognized in the financial statements if the position is more-likely-than-not to be sustained if the position were to be challenged by a taxing authority. The assessment of the tax position is based solely on the technical merits of the position, without regard to the likelihood that the tax position may be challenged.SMH is exempt from federal income tax under IRC section 501(c)(3), though it is subject to tax on income unrelated to its exempt purpose, unless that income is otherwise excluded by the Code. SMH has processes presently in place to ensure the maintenance of its tax-exempt status; to identify and report unrelated income; to determine its filing and tax obligations in jurisdictions for which there was nexus; and to identify and evaluate other matters that may be considered tax positions. SMH has determined that there are no material uncertain tax positions that require recognition or disclosure in the financial statements."

The University applies a 4.5% spending rate to a three-year moving average of endowment investment funds. The Board of Regents sets the spending rate. The purpose of using a moving average is to smooth out any wide fluctuations in the market value. Endowment earnings in excess of the spending rate are added back to the principal of the endowment investments. In years when yield exceeds the amount appropriated under the spending policy the excess is returned to principal as appreciation. When annual yield is insufficient to support spending appropriations, the balance is provided from accumulated appreciation. Special allocations may be made for certain purposes in addition to the spending rate, as approved by the University's Board of Regents.

Kiara, Inc. is an Illinois for-profit corporation that recognizes income taxes under the asset-and-liability method. Deferred tax assets and liabilities are recognized for the future tax consequences attributable to differences between the consolidated financial statement carrying amounts of existing assets and liabilities and their respective tax basis and operating loss and tax credit carryforwards. Deferred tax assets and liabilities are measured using the enacted tax rates expected to apply to taxable income in the years in which those temporary differences are expected to be recovered or settled. The effect on deferred tax assets and liabilities of a change in tax rates is recognized in income in the period that includes the enactment date. The net operating loss carryforwards result in a deferred tax asset of $83,066 and $70,000 at June 30, 2020 and 2019, respectively. In assessing the realizability of deferred tax assets, management considers whether it is more likely than not that some portion or all of the deferred tax assets will not be realized. The ultimate realization of deferred tax assets is dependent upon the generation of future taxable income during the periods in which those temporary differences become deductible. Management considers projected future taxable income and tax planning strategies in making this assessment. Based upon the level of historical taxable losses and projections for future taxable losses over the periods for which the deferred tax assets are deductible, management believes it is more likely Kiara, Inc. will not realize the majority of the benefits of these deductible differences. Full valuation allowances have been applied against the deferred tax assets attributable to the net operating loss carryforwards not realized as of June 30, 2020 and 2019 in the accompanying consolidated financial statements due to the uncertainty of realization. HSHS recognizes the tax benefit from an uncertain tax position only if it is more likely than not the tax position will be sustained on examination by the taxing authorities, based on the technical merits of the position. As of June 30, 2020 and 2019, HSHS does not have any liabilities for unrecognized tax benefits."

ITS ENDOWMENT INCLUDES DONOR RESTRICTED ENDOWMENT FUNDS. AS REQUIRED BY GENERALLY ACCEPTED ACCOUNTING PRINCIPLES, NET ASSETS ASSOCIATED WITH ENDOWMENT FUNDS ARE CLASSIFIED AND REPORTED BASED ON THE EXISTENCE OR ABSENCE OF DONOR-IMPOSED OR LEGAL RESTRICTIONS. ENDOWMENT FUNDS INCLUDE INVESTED GIFTS AND CASH. AS REQUIRED BY GENERALLY ACCEPTED ACCOUNTING PRINCIPLES, THE COLLEGE CLASSIFIES AS DONOR RESTRICTED NET ASSETS (A) THE ORIGINAL VALUE OF GIFTS DONATED TO THE PERMANENT ENDOWMENT, (B) THE ORIGINAL VALUE OF SUBSEQUENT GIFTS TO THE PERMANENT ENDOWMENT, AND (C) ACCUMULATIONS TO THE PERMANENT ENDOWMENT MADE IN ACCORDANCE WITH THE DIRECTION OF THE APPLICABLE DONOR GIFT INSTRUMENT AT THE TIME THE ACCUMULATION IS ADDED TO THE FUND. THE REMAINING PORTION OF THE DONOR-RESTRICTED ENDOWMENT FUNDS IS CLASSIFIED AS EXPENDABLE NET ASSETS WITH DONOR RESTRICTIONS UNTIL THOSE AMOUNTS ARE APPROPRIATED FOR EXPENDITURE BY THE COLLEGE IN A MANNER CONSISTENT WITH THE STANDARD OF PRUDENCE PRESCRIBED BY STATE LAW. IN ACCORDANCE WITH THE UNIFORM PRUDENT MANAGEMENT OF INSTITUTIONAL FUNDS ACT, THE COLLEGE MAY CONSIDER THE FOLLOWING FACTORS IN MAKING A DETERMINATION TO APPROPRIATE OR ACCUMULATE DONOR-RESTRICTED ENDOWMENT FUNDS: THE DURATION AND PRESERVATION OF THE FUND; THE PURPOSES OF THE COLLEGE AND THE DONOR-RESTRICTED ENDOWMENT FUND; GENERAL ECONOMIC CONDITIONS; THE POSSIBLE EFFECT OF INFLATION AND DEFLATION; THE EXPECTED TOTAL RETURN FROM INCOME AND THE APPRECIATION OF INVESTMENTS; OTHER RESOURCES OF THE COLLEGE; AND THE INVESTMENT POLICIES OF THE COLLEGE. THE COLLEGE HAS ADOPTED INVESTMENT AND SPENDING POLICIES FOR ITS ENDOWMENT ASSETS THAT ATTEMPT TO PROVIDE A PREDICTABLE STREAM OF FUNDING FOR ITS PROGRAMS WHILE SEEKING TO MAINTAIN THE PURCHASING POWER OF THE ENDOWMENT ASSETS. UNDER THIS POLICY, AS APPROVED BY THE BOARD, THE ENDOWMENT ASSETS ARE INVESTED IN A PORTFOLIO OF DEBT AND EQUITY SECURITIES WITH THE OBJECTIVE OF ACHIEVING LONG-TERM CAPITAL APPRECIATION WHILE MODERATING THE LEVEL OF INVESTMENT RISK. ACTUAL RETURNS IN ANY GIVEN YEAR MAY VARY FROM THIS AMOUNT. TO SATISFY ITS LONG-TERM RATE-OF-RETURN OBJECTIVES, THE COLLEGE RELIES ON A TOTAL RETURN STRATEGY IN WHICH INVESTMENT RETURNS ARE ACHIEVED THROUGH BOTH CAPITAL APPRECIATION (REALIZED AND UNREALIZED) AND CURRENT YIELD (INTEREST, DIVIDENDS AND NET RENTAL INCOME). THE COLLEGE HAS INVESTED IN DEBT AND EQUITY SECURITIES THAT TARGET A DIVERSIFIED ASSET ALLOCATION THAT PLACES A GREATER EMPHASIS ON EQUITY-BASED INVESTMENTS TO ACHIEVE ITS LONG-TERM RETURN OBJECTIVES WITHIN PRUDENT RISK CONSTRAINTS. THE COLLEGE HAS A POLICY OF APPROPRIATING FOR DISTRIBUTION, AS NEEDED, AMOUNTS FOR THE PURPOSES OF SCHOLARSHIPS AND FINANCIAL AID, CAPITAL PROJECTS, AND SPECIAL PROGRAMS. IN ESTABLISHING THIS POLICY, THE COLLEGE CONSIDERED THE LONG-TERM EXPECTED RETURN ON ITS ENDOWMENT. THIS IS CONSISTENT WITH THE COLLEGE'S OBJECTIVE TO MAINTAIN THE PURCHASING POWER OF ITS ENDOWMENT. FROM TIME TO TIME, THE FAIR VALUE OF ASSETS ASSOCIATED WITH INDIVIDUAL DONOR-RESTRICTED ENDOWMENT FUNDS MAY FALL BELOW THE LEVEL THAT THE DONOR IMPOSED RESTRICTIONS REQUIRE THE COLLEGE TO RETAIN AS A FUND OF PERPETUAL DURATION. THE COLLEGE MAY APPROPRIATE FOR EXPENDITURE FROM THESE UNDERWATER ENDOWMENT FUNDS IN ACCORDANCE WITH THE PRUDENT MEASURES PRESCRIBED BY STATE LAW. AS OF JUNE 30, 2020, FUNDS WITH AN ORIGINAL GIFT VALUE OF $1,874,266 WERE UNDERWATER BY $95,603. AS OF JUNE 30, 2019, FUNDS WITH AN ORIGINAL GIFT VALUE OF $54,178 WERE UNDERWATER BY $2,145."

THE COLLEGE HAS ADOPTED INVESTMENT AND SPENDING POLICIES FOR ENDOWMENT ASSETS THAT ATTEMPT TO PROVIDE A PREDICTABLE STREAM OF FUNDING FOR ITS PROGRAMS WHILE SEEKING TO MAINTAIN THE PURCHASING POWER OF THE ENDOWMENT ASSETS. UNDER THIS POLICY, AS APPROVED BY THE BOARD OF TRUSTEES, THE ENDOWMENT ASSETS ARE INVESTED IN A MANNER THAT IS INTENDED TO PRODUCE A FIXED STREAM OF INCOME WHILE ASSUMING A MODERATE LEVEL OF INVESTMENT RISK. ACTUAL RETURNS IN ANY GIVEN YEAR MAY VARY FROM THIS AMOUNT. TO SATISFY ITS LONG-TERM RATE-OF-RETURN OBJECTIVES, THE COLLEGE RELIES ON A TOTAL RETURN STRATEGY IN WHICH INVESTMENT RETURNS ARE ACHIEVED THROUGH BOTH CAPITAL APPRECIATION (REALIZED AND UNREALIZED) AND CURRENT YIELD (INTEREST, DIVIDENDS AND NET RENTAL INCOME). THE COLLEGE HAS INVESTED IN DEBT AND EQUITY SECURITIES THAT TARGET A DIVERSIFIED ASSET ALLOCATION THAT PLACES A GREATER EMPHASIS ON EQUITY-BASED INVESTMENTS TO ACHIEVE ITS LONG-TERM RETURN OBJECTIVES WITHIN PRUDENT RISK CONSTRAINTS. THE COLLEGE HAS A POLICY OF REINVESTING 25% OF THE INCOME GENERATED BY THE ENDOWMENT FUND'S INVESTMENTS INTO THE ENDOWMENT. IN ESTABLISHING THIS POLICY, THE COLLEGE CONSIDERED THE LONG-TERM EXPECTED RETURN ON ITS ENDOWMENT. THIS IS CONSISTENT WITH THE COLLEGE'S OBJECTIVE TO MAINTAIN THE PURCHASING POWER OF ITS ENDOWMENT. FROM TIME TO TIME, THE FAIR VALUE OF ASSETS ASSOCIATED WITH INDIVIDUAL DONOR-RESTRICTED ENDOWMENT FUNDS MAY FALL BELOW THE LEVEL THAT THE DONOR-IMPOSED RESTRICTIONS REQUIRE THE COLLEGE TO RETAIN AS A FUND OF PERPETUAL DURATION.

Under the requirements of FIN 48, tax-exempt organizations could now be required to record an obligation as the result of a tax position they have historically taken or various tax exposure items. Prior to FIN 48, the determination of when to record a liability for tax exposure was based on whether a liability was considered probable and reasonably estimable in accordance with SFAS No.5, Accounting for Contingencies.

THE COLLEGE'S SPENDING AND INVESTMENT POLICIES WORK TOGETHER TO ACHIEVE THIS OBJECTIVE. THE INVESTMENT POLICY ESTABLISHES AN ACHIEVABLE RETURN OBJECTIVE THROUGH DIVERSIFICATION OF ASSET CLASSES. THE CURRENT LONG-TERM RETURN OBJECTIVE IS TO ACHIEVE A TOTAL RETURN (INCOME PLUS CAPITAL CHANGE, NET OF ALL INVESTMENT EXPENSES) EQUAL TO OR EXCEEDING ANY APPROVED DISTRIBUTION RATE, PLUS THE INFLATION RATE AS MEASURED BY THE CONSUMER PRICE INDEX. ACTUAL RETURNS IN ANY GIVEN YEAR MAY VARY FROM THIS AMOUNT. TO SATISFY ITS LONG- TERM RATE-OF-RETURN OBJECTIVES, THE COLLEGE RELIES ON A TOTAL RETURN STRATEGY IN WHICH INVESTMENT RETURNS ARE ACHIEVED THROUGH BOTH CAPITAL APPRECIATION (REALIZED AND UNREALIZED) AND CURRENT YIELD (INTEREST AND DIVIDENDS). THE COLLEGE TARGETS A DIVERSIFIED ASSET ALLOCATION THAT PLACES AN EMPHASIS ON U.S. EQUITY-BASED INVESTMENTS AND U.S. INTERMEDIATE-TERM DEBT SECURITIES TO ACHIEVE ITS LONG-TERM RETURN OBJECTIVES WITHIN PRUDENT RISK PARAMETERS. THE SPENDING POLICY CALCULATES THE AMOUNT OF MONEY ANNUALLY DISTRIBUTED FROM THE COLLEGE'S VARIOUS ENDOWED FUNDS, FOR SCHOLARSHIPS, PROGRAMS AND ADMINISTRATION. THE COLLEGE UTILIZES A TOTAL RETURN SPENDING RATE POLICY WHICH LIMITS THE AMOUNT OF INVESTMENT RETURN USED TO SUPPORT CURRENT OPERATIONS. THE LIMIT IS DETERMINED BY THE COLLEGE'S CURRENT BUDGETED AMOUNT TO BE SPENT FOR THE YEAR. UNDER THE TOTAL SPENDING POLICY, THE COLLEGE UTILIZED 765,000 AND 883,000 IN 2020 AND 2019, RESPECTIVELY. THIS EQUATES TO APPROXIMATELY 2.49% IN 2020 AND 2.90% IN 2019 OF THE FAIR VALUE OF THE ENDOWMENT FUNDS.

Tax benefits will be recognized only if the tax position is more-likely-than-not sustained in a tax examination, with a tax examination being presumed to occur. The amount recognized will be the largest amount of tax benefit that is greater than 50% likely of being realized on examination. For tax positions not meeting the more-likely-than-not test, no tax benefit will be recorded. Management has concluded that they are unaware of any tax benefits or liabilities to be recognized at June 30, 2020 and 2019.

HOWEVER, PART 2 OF THE GRANT IS CONSIDERED ""CONDITIONAL"", AND THE INSTITUTE IS ONLY ELIGIBLE FOR THE AMOUNT OF FUNDS REMITTED IN RELATION TO PART 1.

The College has also determined that the open tax years are generally three years for federal and four years for California tax purposes. For federal there is an unrelated business income net operating loss carryover of approximately $1,727,000 and $1,797,000 as of June 30, 2020 and 2019, respectively. For California there is an unrelated business income net operating loss carryover of approximately $2,012,000 and $1,829,000 as of June 30, 2020 and 2019, respectively. A net operating loss can only be reflected as a benefit (deferred tax asset) on the statement of financial position when it is likely that the loss would be utilized against taxable income in another tax year. Since there is not presently a likelihood of taxable income in another tax year, the College has recorded a full valuation allowance for the deferred tax assets on the statement of financial position for these net operating loss carryovers. There have been no related tax penalties or interest, which would be classified as tax expense in the statement of activities. The net operating loss carryover will begin to expire June 30, 2025 for federal purposes and June 30, 2019 for California purposes. The College applied ASC 740-10-25, Accounting for Uncertainty in Income Taxes, to all tax positions for which the statute of limitations remained open and determined there were no material unrecognized tax benefits as of the year ended June 30, 2020 and the year ended June 30, 2019, nor are any changes anticipated in the twelve months following June 30, 2020."

Its endowment includes both donor-restricted endowment funds and funds designated by the Board of Trustees to function as endowments. As required by U.S. generally accepted accounting principles (GAAP), net assets associated with endowment funds, including funds designated by the Board of Trustees to function as endowments, are classified and reported based on the existence or absence of donor-imposed restrictions. The College has adopted investment and spending policies for endowment assets that attempt to provide a predictable stream of funding to programs supported by its endowment while seeking to maintain the purchasing power of the endowment assets. Endowment assets include those assets of donor-restricted funds that the College must hold in perpetuity or for a donor-specified period(s) as well as board-designated funds. Under this policy, as approved by the Board of Trustees, the endowment assets are invested in a manner that is intended to produce results that exceed the price and yield results of appropriate market indices while assuming a moderate level of investment risk. The College's investment objectives are to provide a total return sufficient to support the College's operating budget while preserving the assets against inflation. To meet these objectives the Board seeks a total return of at least 5% greater than the rate of inflation as measured by the Consumer Price Index (U.S. CPI-U) over a long-term horizon. Total return is defined as dividends or interest income, plus or minus realized and unrealized capital appreciation or depreciation at fair market value, net of fees. The maximum amount of endowment income utilization is determined by a spending formula approved by the Board of Trustees. The amount available for spending ranges between 5% and 7% of the previous three-year average market value for the years ended June 30, 2020 and 2019, respectively. The amounts available to be distributed, net of unspent endowment income, under the spending policy were $1,590,215 and $676,422 for the years ended June 30, 2020 and 2019, respectively. These amounts are included in change in net assets from operations. Investment return greater or less than the amounts available to be distributed under the spending policy is reported as a change in net assets from non-operating activities."

202101349349301830,133297197,"Schedule D, Part III, Line 4 Collections of art - description of collections","The mission of The New School art collection, in recognition of its historic commitment to art as a vehicle for sociopolitical change, is to advance the importance of art as an agent for personal and collective transformation. As a curricular resource for all areas of study, the role of the collection is to conserve, interpret, and present works of art to the students, faculty, and greater community. New acquisitions support the vision of the university as an environment for innovative thinking and artistic experimentation. HISTORY OF THE COLLECTION The university's legacy of supporting the freedom of artistic expression began in 1931 with the commissioning of two historically significant mural cycles: Jose Clemente Orozco's A Call for Revolution and Universal Brotherhood, and Thomas Hart Benton's epic America Today. Over the years, the university has hosted a roster of accomplished artists, writers, dancers, designers, historians, social scientists, and philosophers, creating a flourishing laboratory for experimentation and innovation. As an institution that embraced such diverse figures as poet Robert Frost, anthropologist Margaret Meade, art historian Meyer Schapiro, and composer/conceptual artist John Cage, The New School has always stood at the forefront of self-discovery and visionary social, intellectual, and aesthetic experimentation. The New School art collection was established in 1960 with a grant from the Albert A. List Foundation. The collection, grown to approximately 2,081 postwar and contemporary works of art, includes examples in almost all media by some of the most innovative and creative artists of our time. Installed throughout the university campus and transforming the public spaces into lively forums for examining contemporary art, the collection offers students and faculty a rare opportunity to engage with art on a daily basis, making it a distinctive component of their educational experience. The collection has continued its tradition of incorporating site-specific works into its public spaces."
202101349349301830,133297197,"Schedule D, Part V, Line 4 Intended uses of endowment funds","The university's endowment is composed of approximately 332 individual funds established for a variety of purposes, including scholarships, professorships, faculty development, lectures, and research programs. The endowment consists of both donor restricted endowment funds and funds designated by the board of trustees to function as endowments. Net assets associated with endowment funds, including funds functioning as endowments, are classified and reported based on the existence or absence of donor imposed restrictions. THE UNIVERSITY'S INDIVIDUAL ENDOWMENT FUNDS ARE POOLED FOR INVESTMENT PURPOSES. THE INVESTMENT PORTFOLIO IS MANAGED TO ACHIEVE A PRUDENT LONG TERM RETURN. THE UNIVERSITY RELIES ON A TOTAL RETURN STRATEGY IN WHICH INVESTMENT RETURNS ARE ACHIEVED THROUGH BOTH CAPITAL APPRECIATION (REALIZED AND UNREALIZED) AND CURRENT YIELD (INTEREST AND DIVIDENDS). THE UNIVERSITY TARGETS A DIVERSIFIED ASSET ALLOCATION THAT PLACES A GREATER EMPHASIS ON EQUITY BASED INVESTMENTS TO ACHIEVE ITS LONG TERM RETURN OBJECTIVES WITHIN PRUDENT RISK CONSTRAINTS. THE ENDOWMENT ASSETS ARE INVESTED TO PROVIDE A REAL TOTAL RETURN THAT PRESERVES THE PURCHASING POWER OF THE ENDOWMENT, WHILE GENERATING AN INCOME STREAM TO SUPPORT THE ACADEMIC ACTIVITIES OF THE UNIVERSITY. ACTUAL RETURNS MAY VARY FROM THIS GOAL IN ANY GIVEN YEAR. The university's endowment spending policy is designed to provide a sustainable and predictable flow of funds to support annual operations. The spending policy is intended to balance current spending needs and to preserve the endowment's future purchasing power. The university applies a board specified spending rate to a moving average of endowment investment funds. The purpose of using a moving average is to smooth out any wide fluctuations in the market value. Endowment earnings in excess of the spending rate are added back to the principal of the endowment investments. Prior to fiscal year 2012, the board specified spending rate was 5%. Beginning with fiscal year 2012, the spending rate was reduced to 4% using a ""soft landing"" approach. The fiscal year 2011 appropriation will be used as the annual appropriation until the investment portfolio increases sufficiently over time to result in an effective 4% spending rate. Thereafter, the 4% spending rate would be applied against the average of the previous 16 quarters' fair value of the endowment portfolio."

THE STUDENTS TAKE A BRIEF TOUR; VISIT THE LEARNING CIRCLE UNDER THE WHALE TO TOUCH DIFFERENT SPECIMENS AND THEN SET OFF TO WORK ON AN ACTIVITY SHEET SELECTED BY THE TEACHER. BECAUSE THE MUSEUM IS AN INTIMATE SPACE, FILLED WITH SPECIMENS, CHILDREN ARE ABLE TO MAKE OBSERVATIONS, EXPLORE DIFFERENCES AMONG THE SPECIMENS, AND THINK ABOUT THEM. THE MUSEUM HOSTS MANY HOME SCHOOL FAMILIES AND ALSO IS USED BY OUR BENEDICTINE STUDENTS FOR CLASS ASSIGNMENTS IN BIOLOGY, ART AND EDUCATION. THERE ARE OVER 5,000 VISITORS TO THE MUSEUM EACH YEAR. IN ADDITION, THE JURICA-SUCHY NATURE MUSEUM OFFERS A DISCOVERY BOX LOAN PROGRAM OF MORE THAN 40 BOXES FOR TEACHERS, HOME SCHOOL FAMILIES AND OTHER GROUPS.

The IRS confirmed in 2008 that this exemption still applies. The University has 11 subsidiary corporations that are included in the consolidated financial statements. Two of these subsidiary corporations are exempt from federal income taxes under 501(c)(2), two are exempt under 501(c)(3), one is exempt under 501(c)(4), four are exempt under 501(c)(25) and two are subject to taxation. The University is classified as an organization that is not a private foundation under Section 509(a) of the Internal Revenue Code because it is described in Sections 509(a)(1) and 170(b)(1)(A)(ii) and, as such, gifts to the University qualify for deduction as charitable contributions to the extent provided by law. The University and its subsidiary corporations that are exempt from federal income tax are required to pay federal income tax on unrelated business income. The amount of income tax expense for unrelated business income for the University and its subsidiary corporations was immaterial for the years ended June 30, 2020 and 2019, respectively. The University is part of a small group of universities that are subject to an excise tax of 1.4% on the University's net investment income and the net investment income of its subsidiary corporations. The excise tax is recognized as a reduction of the University's investment returns. The University recorded a reduction of returns of $2,608 and $7,530 for the years ended June 30, 2020 and 2019, respectively. U.S. GAAP requires the University to evaluate its tax positions to recognize a tax liability (or asset) if the University has taken an uncertain tax position that, more likely than not, would not be sustained upon examination by the IRS. The University has analyzed the tax positions taken and has concluded that as of June 30, 2020, there are no significant uncertain positions taken."

The withdrawal of works of art from the collection of the Institute is performed in accordance with a formal policy initially adopted in 1975 and last revised in fiscal year 2020.

All the collections are open to the public. The Yale University Art Gallery: The Yale University Art Gallery, founded in 1832, is the oldest U.S. college art museum. The gallery houses more than 300,000 objects from all regions of the globe and across time. The collection includes ancient art, Asian art, African art, Indo-Pacific art, prints and drawings, photographs, numismatics, works of European and American masters from virtually every period, and a rich collection of modern and contemporary art. The mission of the Yale University Art Gallery is to encourage appreciation and understanding of art and its role in society through direct engagement with original works of art. The gallery stimulates active learning about art and the creative process through research, teaching, and dialogue among communities of Yale students, faculty, artists, scholars, alumni, and the wider public. The Gallery organizes exhibitions and educational programs to offer enjoyment and encourage inquiry, while building and maintaining its collections in trust for future generations. The Yale Center for British Art: The Yale Center for British Art is a public art museum and research institute for the study of British art and culture. The Yale Center for British Art, which opened in 1977, houses the largest and most comprehensive collection of British art outside the United Kingdom. The collection of paintings, sculpture, prints, drawings, watercolors, rare books, and manuscripts reflects the development of British art and culture from the Elizabethan period onward. The Center offers a year-round schedule of exhibitions and programs, including talks and lectures, conferences, films, concerts, and performances. The Yale Center for British Art oversees an active research program through which it promotes and fosters the scholarship of all aspects of British art and material culture. Academic resources of the center include the Reference Library and Archives, conservation laboratories, a study room for examining works on paper as well as rare books and manuscripts from the collection, and an online catalogue of the collections. Peabody Museum: Yale's Peabody Museum of Natural History, founded in 1866, is one of the oldest and largest university-based natural history museums with worldwide acclaim for its dinosaur skeletons, mammal displays, and natural history collections. The Peabody Museum houses more than 13 million specimens and artifacts representing more than 4 billion years of geological, biological, and human history. These collections are at the heart of university teaching and are a resource for scholars at Yale and around the world. Museums and the expertise that surrounds them are vibrant elements of Yale's culture of scholarship and teaching. The Peabody is a working museum, where public exhibition, research, conservation, teaching, and learning intersect. Its mission is to serve the University by advancing the understanding of earth's history through geological, biological, and anthropological research, and by communicating the results of this research to the widest possible audience through publication, exhibition, and educational programs. Fundamental to this mission is stewardship of the Museum's rich collections, which provide a remarkable record of the history of the earth, its life, and its cultures. Conservation, augmentation and use of these collections become increasingly urgent as modern threats to the diversity of life and culture continue to intensify. The Museum's collections are a major component of the research and teaching activities of the Peabody and Yale. The Yale Peabody Museum Office of Student Programs supports Yale student participation in the activities of the Museum across all of its departments and divisions. In addition, each year the Yale Peabody Museum provides educational programs on biology, paleontology, geology, ancient civilizations, and social studies to more than 25,000 students from Connecticut, Massachusetts, New York, and Rhode Island. All programs draw on the Museum's exhibits to meet the increasingly sophisticated needs of science and social studies education, and most can be adapted to accommodate specific group needs as requested. The Museum's collections are available to legitimate researchers at established institutions for scholarly use. Collection of Musical Instruments: Established in 1900, the Collection of Musical Instruments today comprises nearly one thousand instruments, and has helped scholars document the history of Western art music. It is committed to fostering an understanding and appreciation of musical instruments from all cultures and periods. One of the foremost institutions of its kind, the Collection acquires, preserves, and exhibits musical instruments from antiquity to the present, and showcases restored examples in demonstration and live performance. Yale University Library: In addition to its museums, the Yale University Library provides outstanding support for teaching, learning, research and practice at the University, and for the world-wide scholarly community, through its staff, collections, programs, spaces, and services. The collection of nearly 15 million print and electronic volumes is housed in 15 libraries, including Sterling Memorial, Beinecke, and Bass libraries, the Center for Science and Social Science Information, as well as many other school and departmental libraries. Collections range from ancient papyri and early printed books to digital collections and electronic databases; and they transcend a wide array of formats including text, photographs, video, audio, data, maps, and ephemera. In building the magnificent collections over the last three centuries, Yale made a stewardship commitment to assist in the preservation of human knowledge. The Library also has a responsibility to bring digital resources to the Yale community and to address the challenges of digital preservation."

The University's investment policy represents the current consensus of the endowment fund's investment philosophy and shall be reviewed from time to time to ensure that it continues to reflect the appropriate expectations, goals and objectives for the endowment fund. The University has interpreted the Uniform Prudent Management of Institutional Funds Act (UPMIFA) as requiring the preservation of the fair value of the original gift as of the gift date of the donor-restricted endowment funds absent explicit donor stipulations to the contrary. As a result of this interpretation, the University classifies as permanently restricted net assets: (A) The original value of gifts donated to the permanent endowment, (B) the original value of subsequent gifts to the permanent endowment and (C) accumulations to the permanent endowment made in accordance with the direction of the applicable donor gift instrument at the time the accumulation is added to the fund. The remaining portion of the donor-restricted endowment fund that is not classified in permanently restricted net assets is classified as temporarily restricted net assets until those amounts are appropriated for expenditure by the University in a manner consistent with the standard of Prudent prescribed by the State of Illinois in its enacted version of UPMIFA. In accordance with UPMIFA, the University considers the following factors in making a determination to appropriate or accumulate donor restricted endowment funds: (1) the duration and preservation of the endowment fund, (2) the purposes of the University and the donor restricted endowment fund, (3) general economic conditions, (4) the possible effect of inflation and deflation, (5) the expected total return from income and the appreciation of investments, (6) other resources of the University, and (7) the investment policies of the University. In September 2018, the University adopted its own investment and spending policies. The objective of these policies is to assure the financial health, independence, and future growth of the University's services and programs. The University's investment policy represents the current consensus of the endowment fund's investment philosophy and shall be reviewed from time to time to ensure that it continues to reflect the appropriate expectations, goals and objectives for the endowment fund. Also in September 2018, the Board approved the establishment and funding of a Board-Designated Endowment. The $6 million funding was provided from unrestricted funds held by the University."

The University has a favorable determination letter from the Internal Revenue Service stating they are exempt from federal income taxes under Section 501(a) of the Internal Revenue Code (IRC) of 1986, as organized under Section 501(C)(3). The University follows guidance that clarifies the accounting for uncertainty in tax positions taken or expected to be taken in a tax return, including issues relating to financial statement recognition and measurement. This guidance provides that the tax effects from an uncertain tax position can only be recognized in the financial statements if the position is ""more-likely-than-not"" to be sustained if the position were to be challenged by a taxing authority. The assessment of the tax position is based solely on the technical merits of the position, without regard to the likelihood that the tax position may be challenged. The University is exempt from federal income tax under IRC Section 501(C)(3), though it is subject to tax on income unrelated to its exempt purposes, unless that income is otherwise excluded by the code. The University has processes presently in place to ensure the maintenance of its tax-exempt status; to identify and report unrelated income, to determine its filing and tax obligations in jurisdictions for which it has nexus; and to identify and evaluate other matters that may be considered tax positions. The University has determined that there are no material uncertain tax positions that require recognition or disclosure in the financial statements."

SACKLER MUSEUM) AND FOUR RESEARCH CENTERS (STRAUS CENTER FOR CONSERVATION AND TECHNICAL STUDIES, CENTER FOR THE TECHNICAL STUDY OF MODERN ART, HARVARD ART MUSEUM ARCHIVES, ARCHAEOLOGICAL EXPLORATION OF SARDIS, TURKEY). THE MUSEUMS' COLLECTION CONSISTS OF MORE THAN 250,000 OBJECTS IN ALL MEDIA, RANGING IN DATE FROM ANTIQUITY TO THE PRESENT WITH WORLDWIDE ORIGINS. THE COLLECTION IS AN IMPORTANT RESOURCE FOR THE HARVARD UNIVERSITY COMMUNITY, AS WELL AS TO A BROADER AUDIENCE OF STUDENTS, SCHOLARS, AND THE GENERAL PUBLIC. IT IS USED TO ADVANCE THE KNOWLEDGE AND APPRECIATION OF ART AND ART MUSEUMS THROUGH PROGRAMS INVOLVING RESEARCH, TEACHING, PROFESSIONAL TRAINING, AND PUBLIC EDUCATION. ARNOLD ARBORETUM: THE ARNOLD ARBORETUM OF HARVARD UNIVERSITY IS THE OLDEST PUBLIC ARBORETUM IN NORTH AMERICA AND ONE OF THE WORLD'S LEADING CENTERS FOR THE STUDY OF PLANTS. ADMINISTERED BY THE OFFICE OF THE PROVOST OF HARVARD UNIVERSITY AND A LINK IN BOSTON'S EMERALD NECKLACE OF PARKS, THE ARNOLD ARBORETUM IS A UNIQUE BLEND OF RESPECTED RESEARCH INSTITUTION AND BELOVED PUBLIC LANDSCAPE. WE PROVIDE AND SUPPORT WORLD-CLASS RESEARCH, HORTICULTURE, AND EDUCATION PROGRAMS THAT FOSTER THE UNDERSTANDING, APPRECIATION, AND PRESERVATION OF TREES. COLLECTION OF HISTORICAL SCIENTIFIC INSTRUMENTS: HARVARD UNIVERSITY HAS BEEN ACQUIRING SCIENTIFIC INSTRUMENTS ON A CONTINUOUS BASIS FOR TEACHING AND RESEARCH SINCE 1672. THE COLLECTION OF HISTORICAL SCIENTIFIC INSTRUMENTS, WHICH WAS ESTABLISHED IN 1948 TO PRESERVE THIS APPARATUS AS A RESOURCE FOR TEACHING AND RESEARCH IN THE HISTORY OF SCIENCE AND TECHNOLOGY, HAS BECOME ONE OF THE THREE LARGEST UNIVERSITY COLLECTIONS OF ITS KIND IN THE WORLD. IT CONTAINS OVER 20,000 OBJECTS DATING FROM ABOUT 1400 TO THE PRESENT. A BROAD RANGE OF SCIENTIFIC DISCIPLINES ARE REPRESENTED, INCLUDING ASTRONOMY, NAVIGATION, HOROLOGY, SURVEYING, GEOLOGY, CALCULATING, PHYSICS, BIOLOGY, MEDICINE, PSYCHOLOGY, ELECTRICITY, AND COMMUNICATION. SIGNIFICANT INSTRUMENTS, MADE OBSOLETE BY NEW TECHNOLOGIES, CONTINUE TO BE INCORPORATED. MANY OF THE DOCUMENTS DETAILING THE PURCHASE AND USE OF THE INSTRUMENTS HAVE BEEN PRESERVED, AND ARE AVAILABLE FOR RESEARCH IN THE COLLECTION'S ADJUNCT LIBRARY. MUSEUM OF COMPARATIVE ZOOLOGY (WITHIN THE MUSEUM OF NATURAL HISTORY): THE MUSEUM OF COMPARATIVE ZOOLOGY (THE MCZ) WAS FOUNDED IN 1859 ON THE CONCEPT THAT COLLECTIONS ARE AN INTEGRAL AND FUNDAMENTAL COMPONENT OF ZOOLOGICAL RESEARCH AND TEACHING. THIS 150-YEAR-OLD COMMITMENT REMAINS A STRONG AND PROUD TRADITION FOR THE MCZ. THE PRESENT-DAY MCZ CONTAINS OVER 21 MILLION SPECIMENS IN TEN RESEARCH COLLECTIONS WHICH COMPRISE ONE OF THE WORLD'S RICHEST AND MOST VARIED RESOURCES FOR STUDYING THE DIVERSITY OF LIFE. THE MUSEUM SERVES AS THE PRIMARY REPOSITORY FOR ZOOLOGICAL SPECIMENS COLLECTED BY PAST AND PRESENT HARVARD FACULTY-CURATORS, STAFF AND ASSOCIATES CONDUCTING RESEARCH AROUND THE WORLD. AS A PREMIER UNIVERSITY MUSEUM AND RESEARCH INSTITUTION, THE SPECIMENS AND THEIR RELATED DATA ARE AVAILABLE TO RESEARCHERS OF THE SCIENTIFIC AND MUSEUM COMMUNITY. USE OF THE COLLECTIONS IN STUDENT RESEARCH IS ALSO ENCOURAGED. FISHER MUSEUM HARVARD FOREST: THE FISHER MUSEUM'S MAIN EXHIBIT DISPLAYS TWENTY-THREE INTERNATIONALLY ACCLAIMED MODELS (DIORAMAS) PORTRAYING THE HISTORY, CONSERVATION AND MANAGEMENT OF CENTRAL NEW ENGLAND FORESTS. OTHER EXHIBITS AT THE MUSEUM REPRESENT THE RANGE OF HARVARD FOREST'S RESEARCH. HARVARD UNIVERSITY HERBARIA (WITHIN MUSEUM OF NATURAL HISTORY): THE HARVARD UNIVERSITY HERBARIA ARE AMONG SOME SEVERAL THOUSAND COLLECTIONS OF PRESSED, DRIED PLANT SPECIMENS WORLDWIDE THAT ARE USED BY RESEARCHERS TO FURTHER OUR UNDERSTANDING OF THE PLANT WORLD. SOME OF THE EARLIEST HERBARIA WERE FOUNDED IN EUROPE IN THE EARLY 1600'S, DURING THE DAYS OF EXPLORATION, WHEN KNOWLEDGE OF THE EARTH'S FLORA WAS GROWING AT SUCH A RAPID PACE THAT BOTANICAL GARDENS COULD NO LONGER MAINTAIN LIVING EXAMPLES OF EVERY KNOWN SPECIES. WHILE HERBARIUM COLLECTIONS OF ALL SIZES EXIST TODAY, THERE ARE FEWER THAN 75 HERBARIA WORLDWIDE WITH MORE THAN ONE MILLION SPECIMENS. HERBARIUM COLLECTIONS HAVE BEEN BUILT BY THE EFFORTS OF NUMEROUS BOTANISTS AND PLANT COLLECTORS WHO SEARCHED FROM REMOTE AND ISOLATED JUNGLES TO INNER CITY WASTE LOTS AND RAILROAD TRACKS TO DOCUMENT THE DIVERSITY AND DISTRIBUTION OF THE EARTH'S FLORA. REPRESENTATIVES OF MOST KNOWN SPECIES OF PLANTS CAN BE FOUND IN HERBARIA TODAY, CAREFULLY MOUNTED ON SHEETS OF ARCHIVAL QUALITY PAPER, LABELED WITH IMPORTANT INFORMATION ABOUT THEM, AND STORED ON SHELVES IN CABINETS. IN ESSENCE, A HERBARIUM IS ANALOGOUS TO A LIBRARY OF CAREFULLY PRESERVED PLANTS WHERE THE SPECIMENS THEMSELVES AND THE LABELS ASSOCIATED WITH THEM PROVIDE A WEALTH OF INFORMATION ONCE THEY HAVE BEEN ""READ"" AND STUDIED BY SCIENTISTS. THE SPECIMENS ARE THE KEY TO UNDERSTANDING PLANT RELATIONSHIPS, GEOGRAPHIC DISTRIBUTIONS, ECONOMIC USEFULNESS, EVEN THEIR MOLECULAR MAKEUP. AS WE LOSE NATURAL HABITATS THE WORLD OVER, HERBARIA INCREASINGLY SERVE AS A RECORD OF THE RECENT HISTORY OF PLANT LIFE, AND AS A REPOSITORY OF PRECIOUS GENETIC INFORMATION. HERBARIA HOLD THE TOOLS FOR OUR UNDERSTANDING OF THE PLANT WORLD. MINERALOGICAL AND GEOLOGICAL MUSEUM (WITHIN MUSEUM OF NATURAL HISTORY): THE HARVARD MINERAL COLLECTION RANKS AMONG THE WORLD'S FINEST DUE TO ITS VERY BROAD REPRESENTATION, WEALTH OF RARE SPECIES; LARGE NUMBER OF SPECIMENS DESCRIBED IN THE SCIENTIFIC LITERATURE; AND THE QUALITY OF ITS DISPLAY SPECIMENS. A RICH SYSTEMATIC MINERAL COLLECTION AND DISPLAYS OF GEMSTONES ARE THE PRINCIPAL EXHIBITS IN THE MINERAL GALLERY. THE MUSEUM IS COMMITTED TO THE DEVELOPMENT AND PRESERVATION OF WORLD-CLASS COLLECTIONS OF MINERALS, GEMS, ROCKS, ORES, AND METEORITES FOR RESEARCH, EDUCATION, AND PUBLIC DISPLAY. ITS EARLIEST COLLECTIONS DATE BACK TO THE LATE 18TH CENTURY. THE MUSEUM CATERS TO THE HARVARD STUDENTS AND FACULTY AS WELL AS THE GEOLOGICAL COMMUNITY AT LARGE BY SERVING AS A UNIQUELY RICH RESOURCE OF MATERIALS AND INFORMATION. PEABODY MUSEUM OF ARCHAEOLOGY AND ETHNOLOGY: THE PEABODY MUSEUM OF ARCHAEOLOGY AND ETHNOLOGY IS STEWARD TO ONE OF THE OLDEST AND LARGEST COLLECTIONS OF CULTURAL OBJECTS IN THE WESTERN HEMISPHERE. SINCE THE LATE NINETEENTH CENTURY, THE MUSEUM HAS PLAYED AN ACTIVE PART IN THE HISTORY OF AMERICAN ANTHROPOLOGY AND IN THE EVOLVING RELATIONSHIP BETWEEN MUSEUMS AND NATIVE PEOPLES. THE PEABODY STRIVES TO MAKE COLLECTIONS WIDELY ACCESSIBLE AND ENGAGE ISSUES OF CONCERN TO DIVERSE AUDIENCES. TODAY, THE PEABODY HOUSES MORE THAN SIX MILLION INDIVIDUAL OBJECTS, 500,000 PHOTOGRAPHIC IMAGES, AND SUBSTANTIAL ARCHIVAL RECORDS. STRONGEST IN THE CULTURES OF NORTH, CENTRAL, AND SOUTH AMERICA, AND THE PACIFIC ISLANDS, THE PEABODY IS ALSO CARETAKER TO IMPORTANT COLLECTIONS FROM AFRICA, EUROPE, AND ASIA. COLLECTION TYPES INCLUDE ARCHAEOLOGY; ETHNOGRAPHY; OSTEOLOGY; AND PAINTING, DRAWING, AND PRINTS. SEMITIC MUSEUM: THE SEMITIC MUSEUM IS HOME TO THE UNIVERSITY'S COLLECTIONS OF NEAR EASTERN ARCHAEOLOGICAL ARTIFACTS. THESE ARTIFACTS COMPRISE OVER 40,000 ITEMS, INCLUDING POTTERY, CYLINDER SEALS, SCULPTURE, COINS AND CUNEIFORM TABLETS. MANY ARE FROM MUSEUM-SPONSORED EXCAVATIONS IN ISRAEL, JORDAN, IRAQ, EGYPT, CYPRUS, AND TUNISIA. THE MUSEUM IS DEDICATED TO THE USE OF THESE COLLECTIONS FOR THE TEACHING, RESEARCH, AND PUBLICATION OF NEAR EASTERN ARCHAEOLOGY, HISTORY, AND CULTURE. WARREN ANATOMICAL MUSEUM: THE WARREN ANATOMICAL MUSEUM'S PRESENT COLLECTION CONTAINS APPROXIMATELY 15,000 ARTIFACTS AND CASES INCLUDING: ANATOMICAL AND PATHOLOGICAL PREPARATIONS; VARIOUS WAX, PAPER MACHE, AND DRY PREPARATION ANATOMICAL MODELS; PHOTOGRAPHS, PRINTS, PAINTINGS, AND DRAWINGS; MEDICAL INSTRUMENTS AND MACHINES; AND OTHER MEDICAL MEMORABILIA. ALONG WITH THE WELL-KNOWN SKULL OF PHINEAS GAGE, THE MUSEUM HOLDS MANY OTHER RARE AND INTERESTING ITEMS. AMONG THESE ARE THE PHRENOLOGICAL COLLECTION OF JOHANN GASPAR SPURZHEIM, THE BOSTON SOCIETY FOR MEDICAL IMPROVEMENT COLLECTION, AND A W. T. G. MORTON-TYPE ETHER INHALER. THE MUSEUM PROMOTES THE COLLECTION FOR THE PURPOSES OF MEDICAL EDUCATION IN ALL FORMS WHENEVER POSSIBLE, BY EXPANDING ITS SCOPE TO PROVIDE PUBLIC PROGRAMMING AND EDUCATIONAL RESOURCES TO THE LARGER COMMUNITY. CARPENTER CENTER FOR THE VISUAL ARTS: CARPENTER CENTER FOR THE VISUAL ARTS IS DEDICATED TO THE SYNTHESIS OF ART, DESIGN, AND EDUCATION THROUGH THE EXHIBITION OF EXISTING WORKS AND PRODUCTION OF NEW COMMISSIONS. IT STRIVES TO BRING PEOPLE, IDEAS, AND OBJECTS TOGETHER IN GENERATIVE WAYS THAT PROVIDE UNPARALLELED EXPERIENCES WITH CONTEMPORARY ART, ULTIMATELY ENRICHING THE CREATIVE AND INTELLECTUAL LIVES OF THEIR AUDIENCES."

Kiara, Inc. is an Illinois for-profit corporation that recognizes income taxes under the asset-and-liability method. Deferred tax assets and liabilities are recognized for the future tax consequences attributable to differences between the consolidated financial statement carrying amounts of existing assets and liabilities and their respective tax basis and operating loss and tax credit carryforwards. Deferred tax assets and liabilities are measured using the enacted tax rates expected to apply to taxable income in the years in which those temporary differences are expected to be recovered or settled. The effect on deferred tax assets and liabilities of a change in tax rates is recognized in income in the period that includes the enactment date. The net operating loss carryforwards result in a deferred tax asset of $83,066 and $70,000 at June 30, 2020 and 2019, respectively. In assessing the realizability of deferred tax assets, management considers whether it is more likely than not that some portion or all of the deferred tax assets will not be realized. The ultimate realization of deferred tax assets is dependent upon the generation of future taxable income during the periods in which those temporary differences become deductible. Management considers projected future taxable income and tax planning strategies in making this assessment. Based upon the level of historical taxable losses and projections for future taxable losses over the periods for which the deferred tax assets are deductible, management believes it is more likely Kiara, Inc. will not realize the majority of the benefits of these deductible differences. Full valuation allowances have been applied against the deferred tax assets attributable to the net operating loss carryforwards not realized as of June 30, 2020 and 2019 in the accompanying consolidated financial statements due to the uncertainty of realization. HSHS recognizes the tax benefit from an uncertain tax position only if it is more likely than not the tax position will be sustained on examination by the taxing authorities, based on the technical merits of the position. As of June 30, 2020 and 2019, HSHS does not have any liabilities for unrecognized tax benefits."

The OCIO managing the majority of the University investments is The Investment Fund for Foundation (TIFF). The University owns interests in two different products structured as a partnership fund which invests with a wide variety of investment products and vehicles. Since the University does not own a direct interest in the underlying investments themselves but gains exposure through the ownership interest in the overarching fund, the investments are classified as alternative investments although the actual underlying exposure is much more typical of a common university endowment portfolio. The assets comprising the alternative investments reported are investments in TIFF's Multi-Asset Fund (""MAF""), TIFF's The Keystone Fund (""TKF""), and certain legacy private equity investments managed by Hirtle Callaghan. The MAF has daily liquidity, and is comprised of underlying investments in funds focused on equity, debt, and commodity securities employing a variety of strategies. Asset types for the MAF include global equities, high yield bonds, resource-related equity, real estate investment trusts hedge funds, asset-backed securities, commodity futures, opportunistic credit assets, conventional bonds, treasury inflation-protected securities, and cash. TKF, has quarterly liquidity with 180 days' notice, and similar to the MAF, TKF invests in the same types of investments as the MAF with the addition of private equity investments. The University's exposure to private investments when taking into account the underlying assets of the multi-asset fund and the Keystone fund was approximately $26.2 million and $25.9 million as of June 30, 2020 and 2019, respectively. This equates to 21.9 percent and 23.9 percent of the total balances for June 30, 2020 and 2019, respectively.

THE MUSEUM FULFILLS ITS MISSION BY: - MAINTAINING AND EVOLVING THE MUSEUM AS A SYMBOL OF CHURCHILL?S LEADERSHIP AND PRINCIPLES, - BUILDING AND PRESERVING THE COLLECTIONS ABOUT CHURCHILL AND CHRISTOPHER WREN, - CONTRIBUTING TO CULTURAL ENRICHMENT THROUGH EXHIBITIONS AND EDUCATIONAL PROGRAMS, AND - DEVELOPING ACADEMIC RESOURCES TO PROMOTE SCHOLARLY STUDY. THE MUSEUM'S COLLECTION IS A JEWEL FOR MILITARY AND BRITISH HISTORIANS AND COMPRISES MANY ONE-OF-A-KIND ARTIFACTS.

BAUMAN WHO COMPLETED A GENERAL SURVEY OF THE MUSEUM IN 2008 (WWW.BAUMANCONSERVATION.COM). THE COLLECTION INCLUDES OVER 10,000 LIBRARY AND ARCHIVAL MATERIALS. THERE ARE ALSO THOUSANDS OF PHOTOGRAPHS, SEVERAL HUNDRED PRINTS AND DRAWINGS, AND APPROX. 1,000 THREE-DIMENSIONAL OBJECTS. THE GREATEST STRENGTH OF THE HOLDINGS IS THE INTERRELATIONSHIPS WITHIN THE VARIOUS SECTIONS OF THE COLLECTION. THE COLLECTION ALSO INCLUDES LESSER NUMBERS OF PAINTINGS AND TEXTILES, PRIMARILY UNIFORMS. SOME OF THE COLLECTION IS USED IN HANDS-ON EDUCATIONAL ACTIVITIES. THIS OFFERS A WONDERFUL ADDITIONAL EXPERIENCE TO ALL STUDENTS.

OTHER COLLECTION MATERIALS INCLUDE HUNDREDS OF ORIGINAL WAR POSTERS, NEWSPAPERS AND CLIPPINGS FOR EXCELLENT PRIMARY SOURCES FOR FACTS AND OPINIONS. COLLECTIONS ON MUSEUM EVENTS GIVE PERSPECTIVE ON THE VISITS OF CHURCHILL, TRUMAN, GORBACHEV, THATCHER, REAGAN, BUSH AND OTHER STATE LEADERS AND THEIR GLOBAL VIEWPOINT ON THE COLD WAR.

The endowment includes both donor-restricted endowment funds and funds designated by the Board of Trustees to function as endowments (board-designated endowment funds).

The College has interpreted Ohio's enacted version of UPMIFA as requiring the preservation of the fair value of the original gift as of the gift date absent explicit donor instructions to the contrary. The College classifies as permanently restricted net assets the original gift value plus the value of subsequent gifts to the permanent endowment. The permanent endowment is not reduced by losses on the investments, except to the extent required by the donor, or by appropriations from the endowment fund. The accumulated portion of a donor-restricted fund that is not permanently restricted is classified as temporarily restricted net assets until appropriated for expenditure by the College in a manner consistent with the standard of prudence prescribed by Ohio's enacted version of UPMIFA. Appropriations from the endowment are used to support scholarships and loans, faculty and academic program support, student awards and prizes, and the general operations of the College."

As such, the College is generally not subject to federal or state income taxes except for amounts derived from unrelated business activities as defined by the IRC. The College adopted the accounting standard on accounting for uncertainty in income taxes, which addresses the determination of whether tax benefits claimed or expected to be claimed on a tax return should be recorded in the financial statements. Under this guidance, the College may recognize the tax benefit from an uncertain tax position only if it is more likely than not that the tax position will be sustained on examination by taxing authorities, based on the technical merits of the position. Examples of tax positions include the tax-exempt status of the College, the continued tax-exempt status of bonds issued by the College, and various positions related to the potential sources of unrelated business taxable income (UBIT). The tax benefits recognized in the financial statements from such a position are measured based on the largest benefit that has a greater than 50 percent likelihood of being realized upon ultimate settlement. The guidance on accounting for uncertainty in income taxes also addresses de-recognition, classification, interest and penalties on income taxes, and accounting in interim periods. At June 30, 2019 and 2018, there were no unrecognized tax benefits identified or recorded as liabilities."

The University is not classified as a private foundation. The University files a Form 990 (Return of Organization Exempt from Income Tax) annually. When these returns are filed, it is highly certain that some positions taken would be sustained upon examination by the taxing authorities, while others are subject to uncertainty about the merits of the tax position taken or the amount of the position that would ultimately be sustained. Examples of tax positions common to universities include such matters as the following: the tax exempt status of each entity and various positions relative to potential sources of unrelated business income tax (""UBIT""). UBIT is reported on Form 990-T, as appropriate. The benefit of a tax position is recognized in the financial statements in the period during which, based on all available evidence, management believes that it is more likely than not that the position will be sustained upon examination, including the resolution of appeals or litigation processes, if any. Tax positions are not offset or aggregated with other positions. Tax positions that meet the ""more likely than not"" recognition threshold are measured as the largest amount of tax benefit that is more than 50% likely to be realized on settlement with the applicable taxing authority. The portion of the benefits associated with tax positions taken that exceeds the amount measured as described above would be reflected as a liability for uncertain tax benefits in the accompanying statements of financial position along with any associated interest and penalties that would be payable to the taxing authorities upon examination. As of May 31, 2020 and 2019, there were no uncertain tax positions identified. The University does not expect the total amount of unrecognized tax benefits to significantly change in the next 12 months. Forms 990 and 990-T filed by the University are subject to examination by the Internal Revenue Service (IRS) up to three years from the extended due date of each return. Management believes the Forms 990 and 990-T have been filed appropriately. Forms 990 and 990-T filed by the University are no longer subject to examination for the fiscal years ended May 31, 2015 and prior. The University would recognize interest and penalties related to unrecognized tax positions in interest and income tax expense, respectively. The University did not recognize or accrue any interest or penalties as of May 31, 2020 and 2019, and for the years then ended."
