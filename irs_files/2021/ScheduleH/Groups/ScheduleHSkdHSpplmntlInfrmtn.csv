THE PURPOSE OF THE ENVIRONMENTAL SCAN WAS TO CREATE A CLEAR PICTURE OF THE HOSPITAL COMMUNITIES, INCLUDING THEIR SOCIAL, ECONOMIC AND PHYSICAL BARRIERS TO HEALTHY LIVING, AND ENGAGE THE COMMUNITY FOR THEIR PERSPECTIVES ON THESE ISSUES. THE COMMUNITY ENGAGEMENT STRATEGY WAS DESIGNED TO GATHER COMMUNITY INPUT ON DISPARITIES WITHIN THE HOSPITAL'S SERVICE AREA, UNDERSTAND COMMUNITY RESOURCES, GAUGE GAPS IN SERVICES, AND CLARIFY AND ENHANCE THE COMMUNITY PROFILE. DATA COLLECTION OCCURRED IN THREE PHASES: COMMUNITY CANVASSING; FOCUS GROUPS; AND COMMUNITY STAKEHOLDER SURVEYS. COMMENTS FROM COMMUNITY MEMBERS ENGAGED IN THE COMMUNITY ENVIRONMENTAL SCAN ARE PROVIDED THROUGHOUT THE REPORT WHEN AVAILABLE. CANVASSING COMMUNITY CANVASSING OCCURRED AT TWO LARGE EVENTS ACROSS THE HOSPITAL'S SERVICE AREA. THE EVENTS WERE THE BOYLE HEIGHTS CHRISTMAS PARADE AND THE RAMONA GARDENS HOLIDAY GIFT GIVE AWAY. CANVASSING QUESTIONS WERE: 1. WHAT STOPS YOU FROM ACHIEVING YOUR HIGHEST LEVEL OF HEALTH? 2. WHAT DOES YOUR COMMUNITY NEED TO BE HEALTHIER? THE CANVASSING EVENTS ENGAGED 111 RESIDENTS IN A SELF-SERVICE SURVEY WHERE THEY COULD WRITE AND PLACE ANSWERS TO THREE OPEN-ENDED QUESTIONS ON POSTER BOARDS. THIS SURVEY METHOD, BASED ON THE DOT SURVEY TECHNIQUE, WAS USED TO INCREASE ACCESS TO SURVEY QUESTIONS FOR PARTICIPANTS, SHOW TRANSPARENCY WITH COMMUNITY RESIDENTS, AND BE AN INTERACTIVE AND PARTICIPATORY ACTIVITY. FOCUS GROUPS DURING CANVASSING EVENTS, LANGUAGE PREFERENCES FOR FOCUS GROUPS WERE DETERMINED AND COMMUNITY RESIDENTS WERE RECRUITED FOR FOCUS GROUP PARTICIPATION. TEN (10) FOCUS GROUPS ENGAGED 108 PERSONS AND WERE CONDUCTED FROM NOVEMBER 2018 TO MARCH 2019. FOCUS GROUPS WERE HELD AT SCHOOLS, PREDOMINANTLY ATTENDED BY PARENTS OF YOUNG CHILDREN, AND AT COMMUNITY CENTERS AND A CLINIC. ONE FOCUS GROUP WAS CONDUCTED WITH A SENIOR CITIZEN GROUP KNOWN AS FRIENDS OF RAMONA GARDENS AT THEIR LOCAL ADULT RECREATION CENTER. EACH OF THE LOCATIONS WAS CHOSEN FOR ITS EASE OF ACCESS TO COMMUNITY MEMBERS AND THE LIKELIHOOD THOSE NEIGHBORS WOULD BE WILLING TO PARTICIPATE.

HOW ARE THEY AFFECTING YOUR HEALTH? 2. WHAT DO YOU BELIEVE ARE THE MOST SIGNIFICANT HEALTH NEEDS FOR YOU AND MEMBERS OF YOUR COMMUNITY? 3. WHAT HEALTH RESOURCES ARE AVAILABLE IN YOUR COMMUNITY? HOW CAN THESE RESOURCES BETTER SERVE TO IMPROVE THE HEALTH OF YOUR COMMUNITY? 4. ARE YOU AWARE OF ANY RESOURCES IN THE COMMUNITY BEING PROVIDED BY THE HOSPITAL? WHAT WOULD YOU LIKE TO SEE THEM PROVIDE? STAKEHOLDER SURVEYS COMMUNITY STAKEHOLDERS WERE IDENTIFIED DURING COMMUNITY CANVASSING AND FOCUS GROUP RECRUITMENT. THE RESPONDING ELEVEN STAKEHOLDERS REPRESENTED A BROAD RANGE OF INTEREST IN THE HOSPITAL'S SERVICE AREA AND INCLUDED LEADERS IN COMMUNITY ORGANIZATIONS AND SCHOOLS. STAKEHOLDER SURVEYS WERE DEVELOPED AND DISSEMINATED ONCE CANVASSING AND FOCUS GROUP THEMES EMERGED. THE SURVEYS SUMMARIZED THE NEEDS AND CONCERNS OF COMMUNITY RESIDENTS, WHICH ALLOWED THE NHF TEAM TO ASK STAKEHOLDERS MORE DIRECT QUESTIONS REGARDING THE SEVERITY OF THE EMERGING ISSUES. STAKEHOLDERS WERE CONTACTED THROUGH EMAIL OR IN PERSON DURING CANVASSING EVENTS AND WERE ASKED TO PARTICIPATE IN AN ANONYMOUS ONLINE SURVEY BASED ON ISSUES RAISED THROUGH COMMUNITY INPUT. THE ONLINE SURVEY WAS ADMINISTERED USING GOOGLE FORMS AND EMAILED TO STAKEHOLDERS WHO EXPRESSED INTEREST IN PARTICIPATING.

SIGNIFICANT DATA SOURCES INCLUDED THE YOUTH RISK BEHAVIOR SURVEY, BEHAVIORAL RISK FACTOR SURVEILLANCE SURVEY, NYS PREVENTION AGENDA DASHBOARDS, SPARCS DATA, VITAL RECORDS, AND THE MOST RECENT MY HEALTH STORY SURVEY. SEVERAL AREAS OF CONCERN WERE NOTED ESPECIALLY THOSE AREAS WHERE MONROE COUNTY DID SIGNIFICANTLY WORSE THAN THE STATE PREVENTION AGENDA PRIORITY AREAS GOALS. HIGHLIGHTED AREAS THAT ARE OF PARTICULAR CONCERN FOR MONROE COUNTY INCLUDE: HEALTHY EATING AND FOOD SECURITY, TOBACCO PREVENTION, INJURIES AND VIOLENCE, MATERNAL AND WOMENS HEALTH, PERINATAL AND INFANT HEALTH, CHILD AND ADOLESCENT SOCIAL AND EMOTIONAL DEVELOPMENT, BUILDING RESILIENT AND SUPPORTIVE ENVIRONMENTS, PREVENTING MENTAL AND SUBSTANCE USE DISORDERS, AND SEXUALLY TRANSMITTED INFECTION RATES. SEVERAL SIGNIFICANT NEEDS WERE IDENTIFIED FROM THE DATA, UNFORTUNATELY THERE ARE NOT ENOUGH RESOURCES TO EFFECTIVELY ADDRESS EACH AREA. THE NEEDS WERE THEN PRIORITIZED BASED ON ESTABLISHED CRITERIA THAT INCLUDED: NEED AMONG VULNERABLE POPULATIONS; ABILITY TO HAVE A MEASURABLE IMPACT; ABILITY TO INTERVENE AT THE PREVENTION LEVEL; COMMUNITY CAPACITY AND WILLINGNESS TO ACT; AND IMPORTANCE OF THE PROBLEM TO COMMUNITY MEMBERS. BASED ON THESE CRITERIA, AND SEVERAL MEETINGS OF GROUP DISCUSSION AMONG THE COMMUNITY HEALTH IMPROVEMENT WORKGROUP, AND AFTER MEETING WITH SEVERAL COMMUNITY GROUPS INCLUDING THE AFRICAN AMERICAN HEALTH COALITION AND THE LATINO HEALTH COALITION, TWO PRIMARY FOCUS AREAS WERE IDENTIFIED: MENTAL HEALTH AND MATERNAL/CHILD HEALTH. IN ADDITION, FIVE AREAS OF CONCERN REMAIN IN THE MONROE COUNTY CHNA AS AREAS TO FOLLOW, AND THESE INCLUDE FOOD INSECURITY, TOBACCO USE, VIOLENCE, OPIOID USE AND SEXUALLY TRANSMITTED INFECTIONS. THE HOSPITAL IS ADDRESSING THE SIGNIFICANT NEEDS IDENTIFIED IN THE 2019 CHNA THROUGH MANY INTERVENTIONS DESCRIBED IN THE IMPLEMENTATION STRATEGY. PROGRESS ON THE IMPLEMENTATION STRATEGY IS WIDELY AVAILABLE TO THE PUBLIC AND CAN BE FOUND ON THE SAME WEBSITE AS THE CHNA (https://www.urmc.rochester.edu/community.aspx). TO ADDRESS THE FIRST PRIORITIZED GOAL OF PROMOTING HEALTHY WOMEN, INFANTS AND CHILDREN, THE HOSPITAL JOINS THE CHIW TO REDUCE RACIAL, ETHINIC ECONOMIC AND GEOGRAPHIC DISPARITIES IN MATERNAL AND CHILD HEALTH OUTCOMES, AND PROMOTE HEALTH EQUITY FOR MATERNAL AND CHILD POPULATIONS. SPECIFICALLY, AS SUGGESTED BY THE NYS DEPARTMENT OF HEALTH IN THE PREVENTION AGENDA, THE HOSPITAL AND THE CHIW WILL ENHANCE COLLABORATIONS WITH OTHER PROGRAMS, PROVIDERS, AGENCIES AND COMMUNITY MEMBERS TO ADDRESS KEY SOCIAL DETERMINANTS OF HEALTH THAT IMPACT THE HEALTH OF WOMEN, INFANTS, CHILDREN AND FAMILIES ACROSS THE LIFE COURSE. THE HOSPITAL SUPPORTED THE MATERNAL CHILD HEALTH ADVISORY GROUP (MCH-AG) WHICH FACILITATED SEVERAL COLLABORATIONS BETWEEN THE HOSPITAL AND COMMUNITY AGENCIES. THE GROUP IS WORKING ON HOUSING INSECURITY AMONG YOUNG FAMILIES, ADDRESSING INSTITUTIONAL RACISM ESPECIALLY IN LABOR AND DELIVERY, AND REDUCING UNPLANNED PREGNANCY AND BIRTH SPACING THROUGH LONG ACTING REVERSIBLE CONTRACEPTION AND SOCIAL SUPPORT SYSTEMS THAT ENCOURAGE BIRTH SPACING. TO ADDRESS THE SECOND PRIORITIZED GOAL OF PROMOTING WELL-BEING TO PREVENT MENTAL AND SUBSTANCE USE DISORDERS, THE HOSPITAL JOINS THE CHIW IN STRENGTHENING OPPORTUNITIES TO BUILD WELL-BEING AND RESILIENCE ACROSS THE LIFESPAN. THE HOSPITAL WILL EXPLORE OPPORTUNITIES TO BUILD COMMUNITY WEALTH SUCH AS SUPPORTING WORKER-OWNED COOPERATIVES AND BUSINESSES, USING THE POWER OF HOSPITALS AS ANCHOR INSTITUTIONS. IN ADDITION, THE HOSPITAL WILL FACILITATE SUPPORTIVE ENVIRONMENTS THAT PROMOTE RESPECT/DIGNITY FOR PEOPLE OF ALL AGES BY EXPLORING POLICY AND PROGRAM INTERVENTIONS THAT PROMOTE INCLUSION, INTEGRATION AND COMPETENCE.

202003189349303485,263162145,"Schedule H, Part V, Section B, Line 5 Input from Community","In conducting its most recent Community Health Needs Assessment (""CHNA"") IU Health Arnett Hospital took into account input from persons who represent the broad interests of the communities it serves. Primary data were gathered in three ways: Community Meetings, Key Stakeholder Interviews, and a Community Survey. For purposes of this CHNA, IU Health Arnett Hospital's community is defined as Benton, Carroll, and Tippecanoe counties, Indiana. These three counties accounted for over 67 percent of the hospital's inpatient cases in 2016. Community Meetings - Tippecanoe County On May 8, 2018, a meeting of community representatives was held at IU Health Arnett Hospital in Lafayette, the county seat of Tippecanoe County. The meeting was attended by 22 community members invited by IU Health because they represent important community organizations and sectors such as: local health departments, non-profit organizations, local businesses, health care providers, local policymakers, parks and recreation departments, and schools. Through this meeting, IU Health sought a breadth of perspectives on the community's health needs. The specific organizations represented at the meeting are listed below. - City of Lafayette - Food Finders Food Bank - Hanna Community Center - Heartford House Child Advocacy Center - Henriott Group, Inc. - IU Health - IU Health Arnett Hospital - IU Health West Central Region - LTHC Homeless Services - Lafayette Family YMCA - North Central Health Services - Purdue Extension - Riggs Community Health Center - Sycamore Springs - Tippecanoe Arts Federation - Tippecanoe County CASA - Tippecanoe County - Tippecanoe Health Department - United Way of Greater Lafayette - YWCA Greater Lafayette - YWCA Foundation The meeting began with a presentation that discussed the goals and status of the CHNA process and the purpose of the community meeting. Then, secondary data were presented, along with a summary of the most unfavorable community health indicators. For Tippecanoe County, those indicators were (in alphabetical order): - Cancer incidence and mortality - Diabetes - Physical inactivity and access to exercise opportunities - Physically and mentally unhealthy days - Preventable hospital stays - Sexually transmitted diseases - Smoking, including during pregnancy - Supply of primary care physicians and mental health providers Participants then were asked to discuss whether the identified, unfavorable indicators accurately identified the most significant community health issues and were encouraged to add issues that they believed were significant. Several issues were added, such as: opioid abuse, the number of uninsured, childhood trauma, and suicide. Obesity was added as a factor that contributes to diabetes. During the meeting, a range of other topics was discussed, including: - Access to healthy food - Suicide (not related to overdoses) among the younger population - Teen pregnancy - Screen time - Purdue University students contributing to the poverty rate After discussing the needs identified through secondary data and adding others to the list, each participant was asked through a voting process to identify ""three to five"" they consider to be most significant. From this process, the group identified the following needs as most significant in Tippecanoe County: - Diabetes and obesity - Opioid abuse - Supply of primary care physicians - Supply of mental health providers The group decided it would be best to split the supply of primary care physicians and the supply of mental health providers into two distinct needs. Community Meetings - Carroll County On April 16, 2018, a meeting of community representatives was held at Wabash & Erie Canal Conference Center in Delphi, the county seat of Carroll County. The meeting was attended by 12 community members invited by IU Health because they represent important community organizations and sectors such as: non-profit organizations, local business, health care providers, local policymakers, and schools. Through this meeting, IU Health sought a breadth of perspectives on the community's health needs. The specific organizations represented at the meeting are listed below. - Carroll County Chamber of Commerce - Carroll County Council - Carroll White Rural Electric Membership Corporation (REMC) - Delphi Community Elementary School - Family Health Clinics (North Central Nursing Clinics) - IU Health Arnett Hospital - IU Health West Central Region - North Central Health Services The meeting began with a presentation that discussed the goals and status of the CHNA process and the purpose of the community meeting. Then, secondary data were presented, along with a summary of the most unfavorable community health indicators. For Carroll County, those indicators were (in alphabetical order): - Cancer incidence and mortality - Diabetes - Physical inactivity and access to exercise opportunities - Physically and mentally unhealthy days - Preventable hospital stays - Sexually transmitted diseases - Smoking, including during pregnancy - Supply of primary care physicians and mental health providers Participants then were asked to discuss whether the identified, unfavorable indicators accurately identified the most significant community health issues and were encouraged to add issues that they believed were significant. Several issues were added, such as: opioid use, pharmacy care, and urgent/emergency care. During the meeting, a range of other topics was discussed, including: - Children/youth - Follow up care - Pharmacy access - Transportation After discussing the needs identified through secondary data and adding others to the list, each participant was asked through a voting process to identify ""three to five"" they consider to be most significant. From this process, the group identified the following needs as most significant for Carroll County: - Supply of primary care physicians and mental health providers - Physical inactivity and access to exercise opportunities - Opioid use - Urgent/Emergency Care - Physically and mentally unhealthy days - Pharmacy Care - Cancer Incidence and Mortality - Diabetes Key Stakeholder Interviews An interview was conducted with a representative from the Benton County Health Department, and the feedback was consistent with the input received during the Community Meetings. An interview was conducted with a representative of the Tippecanoe County Health Department. The interview was conducted to assure that appropriate and additional input was received from a governmental public health official. The individual that was interviewed for Tippecanoe County participated in the community meeting. Accordingly, the results of the community meeting were discussed and insights were sought regarding significant community health needs, why such needs are present, and how they can be addressed. The interview was guided by a structured protocol that focused on opinions regarding significant community health needs, describing why such needs are present, and seeking ideas for how to address them. The interviewee confirmed that the four needs identified by the community meeting participants were significant, adding that all four rank fairly evenly in terms of their prevalence and significance. These four needs were: - Diabetes and obesity - Opioid abuse - Supply of primary care physicians - Supply of mental health providers ""Diabetes and obesity"" was identified as particularly prevalent in low income populations who struggle to afford and access healthy foods. The shortage of primary care and mental health providers is ""realis made more challenging because existing professionals typically only are available to patients during business hours. The supply of mental health providers contributes to opioid abuse, because those unable to access mental health services may be self-medicating. Homelessness also was described as a contributing factor to substance abuse. Many recovering or suffering from addiction have trouble finding stable housing, leading to continued drug abuse. Affordable housing for low income and Section 8 residents is needed. Many residents are uninsured or underinsured, leading to inadequate access to care. For underinsured individuals, many providers are out of network, presenting significant access barriers. Many community residents do not own cars. A lack of transportation options presents another barrier to accessing care. Bringing health services to people in their homes would be helpful. Due to inadequate access to primary care, many use emergency departments for basic health care service. This is particularly true for low income residents who, at the end of the month, exhaust their food, medication, and other basic-needs assistance. Programs that seek to improve the health of low income populations would enhance job retention, education levels, and housing stability. Maternal and child health services also are needed.

IU Health Arnett is unable to address those community health needs that do not relate directly to the Hospital's mission to deliver healthcare. These are needs that other governmental agencies and/or community organizations have the most appropriate expertise and resources to address. IU Health Arnett is unable to address the following community health needs identified in the 2018 Community Health Needs Assessment: Maternal and Child Health The Nurse Family Partnership provides in-home services to qualifying families. Healthy Communities of Clinton County Coalition offers numerous health services to new and expecting mothers. IU Health Arnett provides maternity services in the region, as well as post-partum and breastfeeding support groups for new mothers. As a system, IU Health is addressing maternal and child health by focusing on infant mortality, creating a system-wide collaborative to focus on this issue. Obesity and Diabetes IU Health Arnett focused on obesity prevention as one of the priority health needs from 2015-2018. The hospital supported many activities in the community. However, during the 2018 community health needs assessment, other needs arose as more necessary to address. There are other community resources that continue to address obesity and diabetes, including Healthy Active Tippecanoe. The hospital provides diabetes education programs. The local YMCA provides a Diabetes Prevention Program. Purdue Extension is another community resource that addresses obesity and diabetes. IU Health team members will continue to participate in the Healthy Active Tippecanoe, which addresses healthy eating and active living.

IU Health team members often serve on agency boards or participate in local coalitions addressing the social determinants of health."
202003189349303485,263162145,"Schedule H, Part V, Section B, Line 13b Income Level Other than FPG","In addition to FPG, IU Health Arnett may take into consideration a patient's income and/or ability to pay in calculation of a financial assistance award."
202003189349303485,263162145,"Schedule H, Part V, Section B, Line 13h Other FAP Factors","IU Health Arnett takes into consideration several other factors in determining patient eligibility for financial assistance. These factors include the following: 1. IU Health's Individual Solutions Department Prior to seeking Financial Assistance under the FAP, all patients or their guarantors must consult with a member of IU Health's Individual Solutions department to determine if healthcare coverage may be obtained from a government insurance/assistance product or from the Health Insurance Exchange Marketplace. 2. Alternate Sources of Assistance When technically feasible, a patient will exhaust all other state and federal assistance programs prior to receiving an award from IU Health Arnett's Financial Assistance Program. Patients who may be eligible for coverage under an applicable insurance policy, including, but not limited to, health, automobile, and homeowner's, must exhaust all insurance benefits prior to receiving an award from IU Health Arnett's Financial Assistance Program. This includes patients covered under their own policy and those who may be entitled to benefits from a third-party policy. Patients may be asked to show proof that such a claim was properly submitted to the proper insurance provider at the request of IU Health Arnett. Eligible patients who receive medical care from IU Health Arnett as a result of an injury proximately caused by a third party, and later receive a monetary settlement or award from said third party, may receive Financial Assistance for any outstanding balance not covered by the settlement or award to which IU Health Arnett is entitled. In the event a Financial Assistance Award has already been granted in such circumstances, IU Health Arnett reserve the right to reverse the award in an amount equal to the amount IU Health Arnett would be entitled to receive had no Financial Assistance been awarded. 3. Alternate Methods of Eligibility Determination IU Health Arnett will conduct a quarterly review of all accounts placed with a collection agency partner for a period of no less than one hundred and twenty (120) days after the account is eligible for an Extraordinary Collection Action (""ECA""). Said accounts may be eligible for assistance under the FAP based on the patient's individual scoring criteria. To ensure all patients potentially eligible for Financial Assistance under the FAP may receive Financial Assistance, IU Health Arnett will deem patients/guarantors to be presumptively eligible for Financial Assistance if they are found to be eligible for one of the following programs, received emergency or direct admit care, and satisfied his/her required copay/deductible: - Indiana Children's Special Health Care Services - Medicaid - Healthy Indiana Plan - Patients who are awarded Hospital Presumptive Eligibility (HPE) - Enrolled in a state and/or federal program that verifies the patient's gross household income is less than or equal to 200% of the Federal Poverty Level 4. Additional Considerations Financial Assistance may be granted to a deceased patient's account if said patient is found to have no estate. Additionally, IU Health Arnett will deny or revoke Financial Assistance for any patient or guarantor who falsifies any portion of a Financial Assistance application. 5. Non-Emergent Services Down Payment Uninsured Patients presenting for scheduled or other non-emergent services will not be charged more than the Amounts Generally Billed (""AGB"") AGB for their services. Patients will receive an estimated AGB cost of their care prior to IU Health Arnett rendering the services and will be asked to pay a down-payment percentage of the AGB adjusted cost prior to receiving services. In the event a patient is unable to fulfill the down-payment, their service may be rescheduled for a later date as medically prudent and in accordance with all applicable federal and state laws and/or regulations. 6. Emergency Services Non-Refundable Deposit This section will be implemented with a strict adherence to EMTALA and IU Health Policy ADM 1.32, Screening and Transfer of Emergency or Unstable Patients. Amount of Non-Refundable Deposit All Uninsured Patients presenting for services at IU Health Arnett's Emergency Department, via transfer from another hospital facility, or direct admission, will be responsible for a one-hundred dollar ($100.00) non-refundable deposit for services rendered. Patients/guarantors will be responsible for any copays and/or deductibles required by their plan prior to full Financial Assistance being applied. Uninsured Patients wishing to make an application for Financial Assistance greater than the AGB must fulfill their non-refundable deposit prior to IU Health Arnett processing said application. Uninsured Patients making payments toward their outstanding non-refundable deposit balance will have said payments applied to their oldest application on file, if applicable."

These data sources along with both primary and secondary research targeting key patient service areas were conducted to determine the needs of the hospital's patient population and highlight key health disparities. Focus groups and in-depth interviews were conducted to seek feedback from the populations we serve including community partners, patients, general consumers and health system staff and leadership. In addition to the focus groups and interviews, paper and electronic surveys were administered using the following method: - Conducted in early 2019 - Distributed via email and in person - Collected 120 responses - Organizations throughout Miami-Dade County participated including: o Health Council of South Florida o Health Foundation of South Florida o Public Health Trust/Jackson Health System o South Florida Behavioral Health Network o Miami Dade County Grants Coordination o American Cancer Society o Sant La o Chamber of Commerce - Fort Lauderdale o Chamber of Commerce - South Florida Hispanic o Legal Services of Greater Miami o Susan G Komen o Ronald McDonald House o Florida Department of Health in Miami-Dade County o South Florida Hospital and Healthcare Association o Miami-Dade County AHEC o United Way of Miami-DadeThe survey captured information about perceived community health needs, areas of priority and opportunities for improving community health. UMHC also partnered with the Health Foundation of South Florida on developing the CHNA. The CHNA was provided publicly on its web site and had paper copies available for review for anyone who inquired. After the data was collected and analyzed, seven priority areas emerged that UMHC has included in its CHNA:1. Access to Care2. Availability of Primary Care and Prevention3. Cancer Prevention and Treatment4. Chronic Disease management5. Communicable Disease including HIV and STDs6. Health Lifestyles including Physical Activity and Nutrition7. Maternal and Child Health"

Strategies in the implementation plan were developed via a consensus amongst a multidisciplinary steering committee. The implementation plan was approved by the UHealth Board of Directors in September 2019. UHealth's community benefit activities were greatly impacted beginning February 2020 by the novel coronavirus (COVID-19). In early March 2020, all community-based activities, that could not be shifted online, were placed on hold for the safety of our community residents, faculty and staff. However, UHealth successfully transitioned many of its community benefit outreach, education, wellness activities, and health care delivery, to telehealth/telemedicine platforms ensuring continuity of information and care to address the most pressing needs in our community. Access to care:Develop a comprehensive guide of all resources available to patients and their families and train financial counselors on all options to connect patients with all available resources. The evaluation metrics include the number of referrals to county programs, number of referrals to partner programs such as Light House for the Blind for low vision patients and the number of patients enrolled in available funding programs. Availability of Primary Care and Prevention:Provide free comprehensive primary care to targeted underserved populations in Miami-Dade County through various partnerships including the Miller School of Medicine Department of Community Service, Center for Haitian Studies, IDEA Clinic and Light of the World. The evaluation metrics include the number of people served through these free clinics and the number of people with positive findings referred for follow up care. Cancer Prevention and Treatment:Provide free cancer screenings and prevention activities to black and Hispanic populations in zip codes in Miami-Dade County with high incidence of late stage cancer in partnership with Sant La Haitian Neighborhood Center, WIC and the Department of Health. The evaluation metrics include the number of people screened and the number of people with positive findings who were referred to supportive services. Chronic Disease Management:Provide free glucose screenings and blood pressure checks to individuals who are at risk and have limited access to formal healthcare. The evaluation metrics include the number of patients with abnormal findings and referrals to appropriate, accessible follow up care.Communicable Disease:Utilize a mobile unit to provide free HIV screenings and PrEP (pre-exposure prophylaxis) to individuals at high risk of infection in partnership with the Miller School Center for AIDS Research and the County Department of Health. The evaluation metrics include the number of people with positive screenings who were referred for appropriate follow up care and the number of people provided PrEP. Healthy Lifestyles:Develop a resources directory to provide to patients that includes all available resources to assist with nutritional needs including WIC, SNAP and TANF in partnership with the County Department of Health. The evaluation metric includes the number of people counseled on available resources and provided the directory. Maternal and Child Health:Provide free well child visits including immunizations to elementary school children at underserved populated schools in Miami-Dade County in partnership with the Children's Health Fund, Kennedy Foundation, Center for Haitian Studies and the Garfield Foundation.
