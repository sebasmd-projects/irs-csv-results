Listed below is an overview of our work in 2019, which addressed the priorities identified in the 2016 CHNA: 1. IMPROVE COORDINATION OF CARE FOR GRADY PATIENTS WITH DIABETES, HYPERTENSION, PROSTATE CANCER, HIV/AIDS AND BEHAVIORAL HEALTH CONDITIONS. In partnership with the Atlanta Regional Collaborative for Health Improvement (ARCHI), several health systems in metro-Atlanta-Grady Health System, St. Joseph's Mercy Care, Wellstar, Piedmont Hospital, and Kaiser Permanente-formed a collaborative to improve diabetes population health outcomes and launched a pilot that included digital education and telephonic coaching. Over 600 patients participated in the digital education program and nearly all who completed the program reported that it was helpful to their diabetes management. Among the 70 patients enrolled in telephonic coaching, a majority were able to lose weight, lower their blood pressure or lower their A1C. Nearly half (49%) of the coaching patients had two or more social needs, and coaches were able to connect patients to resources including financial assistance, housing, transportation, SNAP and mental health services. This pilot highlighted the complex nature of patients with uncontrolled diabetes and showed that person-centered coaching focused on addressing nonclinical needs is effective in improving clinical outcomes. The partners continue to work together to address diabetes and apply lessons learned to the next phase. Community Health Workers (CHWs) are critical members of a patient's care team, and Grady continues to expand access to CHWs to improve outcomes. In late 2018, in partnership with United Way of Greater Atlanta, Grady added a CHW in Women's Services to reduce preterm births, low birth weight, infant mortality, maternal mortality and the use of emergency services for pregnancy care. This CHW provides prenatal care coordination, linkage to other health, community or social services, and education to reinforce healthy behaviors. Within the first year, 26 women began working with the CHW and 22 completed the intervention. Among these patients, the CHW completed 35 home visits, coordinated 217 medical appointments, completed 13 community referrals, and helped secure housing, baby supplies, and transportation. Of the 22 women who completed the intervention, only four (18%) had an infant with low or very low birth weight, four (18%) had a pre-term delivery, 14 (63%) were breastfeeding one-week post-partum, and 14 (63%) were connected to a primary care physician. Grady is continuing to optimize this program through expanded referral pathways and partnerships with other Grady services to better serve moms and babies. Grady also worked with the Westside Health Collaborative (WHC) to refer patients with uncontrolled diabetes or hypertension to CHWs based at Chris 180, a WHC partner. The program was designed to help residents of Westside neighborhoods (Vine City and English Avenue) improve their health and connect to community resources. Ten percent of Grady's patients reside in Westside neighborhoods, a community with high poverty rates, low educational attainment and significant health disparities. Throughout 2019, a Nurse Care Coordinator at Grady's Asa Yancey Neighborhood Health Center identified and referred 111 eligible patients. Among the 59 patients who enrolled, 51 attended follow up appointments, 53 achieved blood glucose readings within the prescribed range and 57 recorded blood pressure readings within the healthy range. Just over half were taking their medication as prescribed and engaging in physical activity. In addition, the CHW was able to connect patients with transportation support, food assistance, utility assistance, and home health coordination. In 2019, Grady expanded Medication-Assisted Treatment (MAT) in partnership with Fulton County. MAT is a treatment that combines medications with counseling and behavioral therapies for patients who suffer from an opioid use disorder (OUD) related to prescription opioids. With the support of the County, Grady doubled the capacity of the service to increase access for Fulton County residents. Grady also added inductions, MAT initiation, at the main hospital to better facilitate the transition to outpatient care. Through this partnership, Grady served 139 people in 2019, about one-third of whom came from Grady Hospital following an overdose. 2. INCREASE OPPORTUNITIES FOR ALL GEORGIANS, WITH A FOCUS ON PERSONS SERVED BY GRADY HEALTH SYSTEM, TO ACCESS HEALTHCARE. Grady has engaged a number of resources to assist patients in gaining access to Medicaid and other public benefits. In 2019, Grady submitted more than 3,962 Medicaid applications for patients. Through our Food as Medicine Partnership, the Atlanta Community Food Bank and Wholesome Wave Georgia submitted 369 Medicaid and 681 Supplemental Nutrition Assistance Program (SNAP) applications on behalf of Grady patients. In 2019, Grady expanded critical health care services to southwest Atlanta with our newest facility, camp creek comprehensive care center. It is a state-of-the-art, one-stop shop for adult and pediatric primary care and specialty care, including women's health services, cardiology, orthopedics, geriatrics, and much more. The center has quick on-site lab services and advanced imaging including x-ray, CT scans and mammography. 3. INCREASE PATIENT AND COMMUNITY ENGAGEMENT IN HEALTHY BEHAVIORS TO PREVENT DIABETES, HYPERTENSION, HIV, UNINTENTIONAL INJURIES, AND HOMICIDE. Georgia has the highest rate of HIV diagnoses of all states and most HIV diagnoses occur in Atlanta. Pre-exposure Prophylaxis (PrEP) with once daily, oral Truvada(R) is up to 99% effective at preventing HIV infection in high-risk groups, including men who have sex with men. Despite its safety and effectiveness, PrEP use remains low in Atlanta and the Southern US. In 2018, GHS launched its first pilot PrEP program within the Primary Care Center and neighborhood health centers. After starting 94 individuals on PrEP during the nine-month pilot, Grady expanded the service in 2019. Through the Food as Medicine (FAM) Partnership, a collaboration between Grady, the Atlanta Community Food Bank, and Open Hand Atlanta, Grady established the Fresh Food Cart (FFC) at Grady's Brookhaven Health Center in June 2019 to pilot a scaled approach to fresh food distribution at our neighborhood health centers. In an effort to address both food insecurity and chronic disease, the FFC provides fresh produce to Grady patients and their families twice a month. In 2019, the FFC grew from serving about 100 patients per event to nearly 200. In 2019, there were 1,400 patient visits and we distributed over 41,000 pounds of fresh produce. FAM Partners also expanded the Fruit and Vegetable Prescription (FVRx) Program in partnership with Wholesome Wave Georgia in 2019 from four to seven cohorts. The Grady Nutrition Team achieved a 90% retention rate in this six-month program. This resulted in 156 patients receiving six cooking classes, six nutrition classes, and nearly $50,000 of food prescriptions redeemed for fresh produce at local farmers markets. Most importantly, patient health improved. We observed reductions in weight, waist circumference, blood pressure and A1C for those with diabetes. Although Grady did not select low birth weight (LBW) as a priority in 2016, Grady offers a robust centering program to address LBW and the CHW hired in Women's Services this year is having an impact on LBW. Similarly, Grady is continuously working to improve breast cancer services and has a robust patient-centered care initiative that drives this work. The other lower priorities of Grady's 2016 CHNA-obesity, poverty, and high school education non-attainment-were not included as areas of focus, because Grady does not have the resources or expertise to significantly address these community health needs, and because other ARCHI partners with the resources and expertise are leading various initiatives to address these needs."

DATA TRENDS INDICATE THAT MENTAL HEALTH AND SUBSTANCE USE ARE INCREASING AND THE NEED FOR PROGRAMMING IS CONTINUING TO GROW. MENTAL HEALTH AND SUBSTANCE USE OFTEN CO-OCCUR. THE CHC HAS RECOMMENDED DEVELOPING APPROACHES AND INTERVENTIONS THAT ADDRESS BOTH HEALTH ISSUES. ADVOCATE CHRIST WILL ADDRESS THE MENTAL HEALTH AND SUBSTANCE USE ISSUES OF INDIVIDUALS IMPACTED BY TRAUMA THROUGH THE TRAUMA RECOVERY CENTER. THE HIGH RATES OF ED VISITS AND HOSPITALIZATION DUE TO MENTAL HEALTH ISSUES ARE PREVENTABLE THROUGH EMPLOYING COPING MECHANISMS AND RESILIENCE TRAINING. EXAMPLES INCLUDE RESTORATIVE JUSTICE ACTIVITIES, MENTAL HEALTH FIRST AID TRAININGS AND TRAUMA INFORMED WORKSHOPS. THE MEDICAL CENTER WILL ADOPT STRATEGIES THAT IMPROVE THE RATES OF MENTAL HEALTH EMERGENCIES AND DECREASE ED VISITS AND HOSPITALIZATION DUE TO MENTAL HEALTH ISSUES. IN ADDITION, ADVOCATE CHRIST WILL CONTINUE TO BUILD A PARTNERSHIP WITH STAFF FROM THE MEDICAL CENTER'S TRAUMA RECOVERY CENTER.DIABETES. HOSPITALIZATION AND EMERGENCY DEPARTMENT (ED) VISITS ARE INDICATIVE OF POORLY CONTROLLED CHRONIC DISEASES AND A LACK OF ACCESS TO ROUTINE PREVENTIVE CARE. POORLY CONTROLLED DIABETES CAN LEAD TO SEVERE OR LIFE-THREATENING COMPLICATIONS, SUCH AS HEART AND BLOOD VESSEL DISEASE, NERVE DAMAGE, KIDNEY DAMAGE, EYE DAMAGE AND BLINDNESS, FOOT DAMAGE AND LOWER EXTREMITY AMPUTATION, HEARING IMPAIRMENT, SKIN CONDITIONS AND ALZHEIMER'S DISEASE. ED VISITS FOR DIABETES ARE HEAVILY CONCENTRATED IN THE WEST AND SOUTH SIDES OF CHICAGO AND THE SOUTHERN REGION OF SUBURBAN COOK COUNTY. THE AREAS WITH HIGH RATES OF ED VISITS LARGELY OVERLAP WITH COMMUNITIES WITH HIGH RATES OF POVERTY, UNEMPLOYMENT AND COST-BURDENED HOUSEHOLDS. AS A RESULT, THE MEDICAL CENTER'S CHC DECIDED THAT DIABETES INITIATIVES IN THIS SERVICE AREA ARE STILL NEEDED AND CONTINUE TO BE A BURDEN FOR RESIDENTS (THE ALLIANCE FOR HEALTH EQUITY, 2019).VIOLENCE PREVENTION. TO A LARGE EXTENT, THE CONDITIONS OF THE ENVIRONMENTS IN WHICH WE LIVE, WORK, PLAY, GROW AND AGE DETERMINE OUR QUALITY OF LIFE AND HEALTH OUTCOMES. THESE SOCIAL DETERMINANTS OF HEALTH (SDOH) EXPLAIN WHY SOME PEOPLE FACE A MORE DIFFICULT CHALLENGE IN ACHIEVING AND MAINTAINING GOOD HEALTH.VIOLENCE HAS PROFOUND DIRECT AND INDIRECT IMPACTS ON HEALTH IN COMMUNITIES AND CAN HAVE BROADER SOCIOECONOMIC EFFECTS THAT FURTHER IMPACT THE HEALTH OF COMMUNITIES. VIOLENCE IN COMMUNITIES HAS BEEN ASSOCIATED WITH REDUCED INVESTMENT IN COMMUNITY RESOURCES, SUCH AS PARKS, RECREATIONAL FACILITIES AND PROGRAMS THAT PROMOTE HEALTHY ACTIVITY (PREVENTION INSTITUTE, 2011). FOOD RESOURCES SUCH AS SUPERMARKETS ARE MORE RELUCTANT TO ENTER COMMUNITIES OF COLOR WITH HIGHER RATES OF VIOLENCE FURTHER REDUCING ACCESS TO HEALTHY FOODS (ODOMS-YOUNG ET AL., 2009; ZENK ET AL., 2005). GUN VIOLENCE CAN SIGNIFICANTLY DECREASE THE GROWTH OF NEW RETAIL AND SERVICE BUSINESSES, DECREASE THE NUMBER OF NEW JOBS AVAILABLE AND SLOW HOME VALUE APPRECIATION (IRVIN-ERICKSON ET AL., 2017). IN ADDITION, HIGH RATES OF GUN VIOLENCE ARE ASSOCIATED WITH LOWER HOME VALUES, CREDIT SCORES AND HOME OWNERSHIP RATES (IRVIN-ERICKSON ET AL., 2017). THE MEDICAL CENTER'S CHC IDENTIFIED VIOLENCE PREVENTION AS A SIGNIFICANT DETERMINANT OF HEALTH IN THE PSA AND WILL WORK WITH INTERNAL AND EXTERNAL STAKEHOLDERS TO DEVELOP NEW AND STRENGTHEN EXISTING EFFORTS TO PREVENT VIOLENCE IN THE COMMUNITY.HEALTH NEEDS SELECTED BY ADVOCATE CHILDREN'SADVOCATE CHILDREN'S-OAK LAWN WILL ADDRESS THE FOLLOWING PRIORITY AREAS FOR IMPLEMENTATION PLANNING FROM 2020-2022, INCLUDING: ACCESS TO PRIMARY HEALTH CARE FOR LOW-INCOME CHILDREN SCHOOL-BASED BEHAVIORAL HEALTH ASSISTANCE INFANT MORTALITY/PRE-TERM DELIVERIES/LOW BIRTH WEIGHTACCESS TO PRIMARY CARE. ACCESS TO PRIMARY CARE IS IMPORTANT FOR THE HEALTH AND WELL-BEING OF CHILDREN AND ADOLESCENTS.

HEART DISEASE WAS NOT SELECTED AS A PRIORITY BY ADVOCATE LUTHERAN GENERAL. ALTHOUGH HEART DISEASE WAS NOT SELECTED, THE HOSPITAL IS COMMITTED TO DECREASING THE RATE OF HEART DISEASE THROUGH ADDRESSING AND PRIORITIZING HEALTHY LIFESTYLES AND OBESITY PREVENTION. NATIONAL DATA MAPS FROM THE CDC INDICATE THAT HIGHER HEART DISEASE AND STROKE DEATH RATES OCCUR IN STATES THAT ALSO HAVE HIGHER OBESITY RATES. THE CHC DECIDED IT WAS MORE BENEFICIAL TO PRIORITIZE OBESITY BECAUSE OF ITS IMPACT ON REDUCING THE RISK FOR HEART DISEASE, INCLUDING HOSPITALIZATIONS AND ER VISITS DUE TO HEART DISEASE. ADVOCATE LUTHERAN GENERAL ALSO ADDRESSES HEART DISEASE THROUGH THE HOSPITAL'S MANY ADVOCATE HEART INSTITUTE PROGRAMS. DIABETES. DIABETES WAS ALSO A PRIORITY NOT SELECTED.

THROUGHOUT THE PSA, VACCINATIONS/IMMUNIZATIONS ARE BEING ADDRESSED BY THE RETAIL AND NON-PROFIT SECTORS. ADVOCATE AURORA HAS SEVERAL WALGREENS CLINICS IN WHICH VACCINATIONS ARE OFFERED AT A LOW-COST TO THE COMMUNITY. IN ADDITION, THERE ARE SEVERAL COMMUNITY CLINICS THAT OFFER VACCINATIONS AT LOW OR NO COST TO PSA RESIDENTS, INCLUDING THOSE WITH NO INSURANCE. DUE TO THE AVAILABILITY OF VACCINATIONS ACROSS THE PSA, THE CHC DID NOT SELECT IMMUNIZATIONS/INFECTIOUS DISEASE AS THE PRIORITY HEALTH NEED. ADVOCATE CHILDREN'SASTHMA/RESPIRATORY DISEASE. ASTHMA/RESPIRATORY DISEASE WAS IDENTIFIED AS A HEALTH NEED. HOWEVER, THE CHC DID NOT RECOMMEND ASTHMA/RESPIRATORY DISEASE AS A HEALTH PRIORITY DUE TO THE LACK OF COMMUNITY PARTNERS AND THE INEFFECTIVENESS/AVAILABILITY OF ASTHMA PREVENTION PROGRAMS.

THESE SIX FOCUS AREAS INCLUDE: 1) ACCESS/BEHAVIORAL HEALTH SERVICES; 2) ACCESS/PRIMARY MEDICAL HOMES; 3) COMMUNITY SAFETY; 4) FOOD SECURITY; 5) HOUSING; AND 6) WORKFORCE DEVELOPMENT.HEALTH NEEDS SELECTED BEHAVIORAL HEALTH. BEHAVIORAL HEALTH WAS ADOPTED AS A PRIORITY HEALTH NEED FOR DUPAGE COUNTY. THE CHC INITIALLY LOOKED AT SUBSTANCE USE AND MENTAL HEALTH AS SEPARATE HEALTH ISSUES HOWEVER, AFTER CAREFUL REVIEW OF DATA, IT WAS EVIDENT THAT MENTAL HEALTH AND SUBSTANCE USE ARE STRONGLY CORRELATED AND PRESENT AS CO-OCCURRING HEALTH ISSUES. TAKING THIS INTO CONSIDERATION, THE CHC AND THE IMPACT DUPAGE STEERING COMMITTEE IDENTIFIED BEHAVIORAL HEALTH AS THE PRIORITY HEALTH NEED AND THE MOST EFFECTIVE WAY TO ADDRESS MENTAL HEALTH AND SUBSTANCE USE. DATA TRENDS INDICATED THAT MENTAL HEALTH ISSUES ARE INCREASING AND THE NEED FOR MENTAL HEALTH SERVICES AND PROGRAMMING IS CONTINUING TO GROW. ADOLESCENTS AND YOUNG ADULTS HAVE SOME OF THE HIGHEST HOSPITALIZATION AND ER RATES DUE TO MENTAL HEALTH ISSUES AND THE GREATEST NEED FOR MENTAL HEALTH SERVICES. THE CHC IS SPECIFICALLY INTERESTED IN COLLABORATING WITH COMMUNITY ORGANIZATIONS SUCH AS THE NATIONAL ALLIANCE FOR MENTAL ILLNESS (NAMI) TO INCREASE THE AMOUNT OF COMMUNITY PROGRAMS AND RESOURCES AVAILABLE TO TEENS AND YOUNG ADULTS WHO EXPERIENCE MENTAL HEALTH ISSUES. THE HOSPITAL WILL WORK WITH THE DUPAGE COUNTY HEALTH DEPARTMENT AND IMPACT DUPAGE TO EFFECTIVELY ADDRESS BEHAVIORAL HEALTH NEEDS IN DUPAGE COUNTY. HEALTH STATUS IMPROVEMENT.

THE CHC AND IMPACT DUPAGE IDENTIFIED HEALTHY LIFESTYLES AND ACCESS TO HEALTH CARE AS A CRITICAL HEALTH NEED FOR DUPAGE COUNTY. OBESITY AND NUTRITION ARE THE LEADING CAUSES OF MANY CHRONIC DISEASES AND HEALTH ISSUES, INCLUDING HEART DISEASE, STROKE, SOME CANCERS AND DIABETES. TAKING THIS INTO CONSIDERATION, THE CHC AND IMPACT DUPAGE SELECTED HEALTH STATUS IMPROVEMENT DUE TO THE ABILITY TO IMPACT THE QUALITY OF LIFE AND OVERALL HEALTH STATUS OF COMMUNITY MEMBERS. BOLINGBROOK-ROMEOVILLE HEALTH NEEDS SELECTED CHRONIC DISEASE PREVENTION AND MANAGEMENT. CHRONIC DISEASE PREVENTION AND MANAGEMENT WAS SELECTED AS A HEALTH PRIORITY FOR THE BOLINGBROOK-ROMEVILLE COMMUNITY. THIS PRIORITY WAS SELECTED DUE TO THE POTENTIAL IMPACT IT CAN HAVE ON DECREASING OBESITY, INCREASING HEALTHY LIFESTYLES AND IMPROVING ACCESS TO AFFORDABLE HEALTHY FOODS. THE HOSPITAL WILL PARTNER WITH BOLINGBROOK-ROMEOVILLE VNA HEALTH CARE, WILL COUNTY HEALTH DEPARTMENT AND WEST SUBURBAN COMMUNITY PANTRY (WSCP) TO ADDRESS CHRONIC DISEASE PREVENTION AND MANAGEMENT.

FURTHERMORE, THE HOSPITAL WILL BE ENGAGED IN THE WILL COUNTY FOOD ACCESS WORKSHOP TO ADDRESS FOOD INSECURITY IN WILL COUNTY. DUPAGE COUNTY HEALTH NEEDS NOT SELECTED AFFORDABLE HOUSING. AFFORDABLE HOUSING WAS IDENTIFIED AS A HEALTH NEED BUT NOT SELECTED. ALTHOUGH AFFORDABLE HOUSING WAS IDENTIFIED AS A SIGNIFICANT HEALTH NEED BY THE CHC AND VOTED AS A PRIORITY FOR DUPAGE COUNTY BY THE IMPACT DUPAGE STEERING COMMITTEE, THE CHC DETERMINED THE HOSPITAL'S CAPACITY AND AVAILABILITY OF RESOURCES WAS LIMITED TO TWO HEALTH PRIORITIES. IN EFFORTS TO EFFECTIVELY ADDRESS BEHAVIORAL HEALTH AND HEALTH STATUS IMPROVEMENT, THE CHC AND THE HOSPITAL'S COMMUNITY HEALTH DEPARTMENT DECIDED TO BE ENGAGED IN THE PLANNING, BRAINSTORMING AND PROMOTION PHASE OF THE COUNTY'S AFFORDABLE HOUSING INITIATIVE. ADVOCATE GOOD SAMARITAN RECOGNIZES THE SIGNIFICANCE OF THE NEED FOR AFFORDABLE HOUSING IN DUPAGE COUNTY AND WILL, THEREFORE, CONTINUE TO PARTNER WITH THE DUPAGE COUNTY HEALTH DEPARTMENT AND DUPAGE PADS TO ADVANCE AFFORDABLE HOUSING STRATEGIES IN THE COUNTY.CARDIOVASCULAR DISEASE. CARDIOVASCULAR DISEASE WAS NOT SELECTED AS A HEALTH NEED. AFTER CAREFUL REVIEW OF THE DATA, THE CHC ALTERNATIVELY RECOMMENDED THAT THE HOSPITAL ADDRESS CARDIOVASCULAR DISEASE THROUGH THE HEALTH STATUS IMPROVEMENT PRIORITY, WHICH INCLUDES NUTRITION, PHYSICAL ACTIVITY AND OBESITY PREVENTION. THE IMPACT DUPAGE STEERING COMMITTEE ALSO DID NOT SELECT CARDIOVASCULAR DISEASE AS A COUNTY HEALTH NEED PRIORITY DUE TO THE IMPACT HEALTH STATUS IMPROVEMENT HAS ON DECREASING THE RATE OF CARDIOVASCULAR DISEASE. ASTHMA WAS IDENTIFIED AS A HEALTH NEED BUT NOT SELECTED AS THE RECOMMENDED HEALTH PRIORITY BY THE CHC DUE TO THE LACK OF COMMUNITY PARTNERS AND THE INEFFECTIVENESS/AVAILABILITY OF ASTHMA PREVENTION PROGRAMS. THE CHC ALSO IDENTIFIED THE HIGH RATES OF HOSPITALIZATION AND EMERGENCY ROOM (ER) VISITS DUE TO ASTHMA AS A POTENTIAL ACCESS TO HEALTH CARE ISSUE. TAKING THIS INTO CONSIDERATION, CHC MEMBERS SUGGESTED ADDRESSING ACCESS TO CARE THROUGH THE HEALTH STATUS IMPROVEMENT PRIORITY AS A WAY TO ADDRESS THE ER AND HOSPITALIZATION RATES DUE TO ASTHMA.SEXUALLY TRANSMITTED INFECTIONS (STIS). STIS WAS ALSO NOT SELECTED AS A HEALTH PRIORITY. WHILE THE CHC RECOGNIZED THAT STIS ARE AN INCREASING NEED PARTICULARLY IN THE ADOLESCENT POPULATION, THE CHC DID NOT RECOMMEND PRIORITIZING THIS HEALTH ISSUE DUE TO THE MULTIPLE ORGANIZATIONS, INCLUDING DUPAGE COUNTY SCHOOLS, ADDRESSING THE ISSUE.

202003239349301515,362169147,"SCHEDULE H, PART V, SEC B, LINE 11 - ADVOCATE GOOD SHEPHERD HOSPITAL","CARDIOVASCULAR DISEASE. IN MCHENRY COUNTY, THERE HAS BEEN A DECLINE IN MORTALITY RATES FOR HEART DISEASE AND STROKE. OVER THE PAST DECADE, MCHENRY COUNTY'S HEART DISEASE DEATH RATE HAS DROPPED BY NINETEEN PERCENT, WHILE THE STROKE DEATH RATE HAS FALLEN BY TWENTY-FIVE PERCENT. THE MOST RECENT DEATH RATE DATA FOR STROKE AND HEART DISEASE SHOWS THIS CONTINUING DOWNWARD TREND. THE PREVALENCE RATE OF HEART DISEASE IS SLIGHTLY HIGHER IN MCHENRY COUNTY THAN LAKE COUNTY; HOWEVER, THE MORTALITY RATE FROM HEART DISEASE IS HIGHER IN LAKE COUNTY THAN MCHENRY COUNTY. THE COMMUNITY HEALTH COUNCIL DECIDED IT WAS MORE BENEFICIAL TO PRIORITIZE OBESITY BECAUSE OF ITS IMPACT ON THE RISK FACTORS FOR HEART DISEASE. THE HOSPITAL IS COMMITTED TO DECREASING THE RATE OF HEART DISEASE THROUGH MANY OF THE ADVOCATE HEART INSTITUTE PROGRAMS. THE HOSPITAL CONTINUES TO BE A MEMBER OF THE CARDIOVASCULAR MAPP (MOBILIZING FOR ACTION THROUGH PLANNING AND PARTNERSHIPS) ACTION TEAM IN MCHENRY COUNTY AND PARTNERS WITH THE MCHENRY COUNTY HEALTH DEPARTMENT TO ADMINISTER THE HEART AGE SCREENING TOOL THROUGHOUT THE COMMUNITY.SUBSTANCE ABUSE. SUBSTANCE ABUSE WAS IDENTIFIED AS A NEED WITHIN THE ADVOCATE GOOD SHEPHERD SERVICE AREA. CONTRIBUTING HEALTH BEHAVIORS IDENTIFIED INCLUDED EXCESSIVE ALCOHOL USE IN ADULTS AND THE PERCENTAGE OF TEENS USING MARIJUANA. THOSE WHO ARE MENTALLY ILL ARE MORE LIKELY TO ABUSE DRUGS OR ALCOHOL. BECAUSE OF THE UNDERLYING MENTAL HEALTH ISSUES AFFECTING THE USE OF SUBSTANCES, THE COMMUNITY HEALTH COUNCIL DECIDED TO SELECT MENTAL HEALTH AS THE PRIORITY DURING THE 2014-2016 CHNA CYCLE. IN 2019, ADVOCATE GOOD SHEPHERD CONTINUED ITS COLLABORATION WITH GATEWAY FOUNDATION TO RUN THE WARM HANDOFF PROGRAM IN THE EMERGENCY DEPARTMENT (ED). A GATEWAY FOUNDATION PATIENT ENGAGEMENT SPECIALIST MEETS WITH PATIENTS IN THE ADVOCATE GOOD SHEPHERD ED WHO HAVE SUBSTANCE USE DISORDER OR OPIOID USE DISORDER AND ASSISTS THEM IN NAVIGATING TO SUBSTANCE USE TREATMENT. IN 2019, THE PROGRAM SERVED 87 INDIVIDUALS; 71 PERCENT OF THE INDIVIDUALS ASSESSED IN THE ED BY THE GATEWAY ENGAGEMENT SPECIALIST WERE REFERRED FOR TREATMENT. SIXTY-NINE PERCENT OF THOSE REFERRED FOR TREATMENT KEPT THEIR APPOINTMENT AND 31 PERCENT DID NOT. THE DIRECTOR OF COMMUNITY HEALTH SITS ON THE LAKE COUNTY OPIOID INITIATIVE TASK FORCE, A COALITION OF AGENCIES WHICH FOCUSES ON PREVENTION OF SUBSTANCE USE AND PROVIDING ACCESS TO SUBSTANCE USE TREATMENT. ADDITIONALLY, THE COMMUNITY HEALTH DIRECTOR IS A MEMBER OF THE MCHENRY COUNTY SUBSTANCE ABUSE COALITION, WHICH IS A GROUP OF COMMUNITY STAKEHOLDERS FROM A WIDE VARIETY OF SECTORS, FOCUSED ON SUBSTANCE USE PREVENTION AND ENSURING ACCESS TO SUBSTANCE USE TREATMENT. 2017-2019 CHNAADVOCATE GOOD SHEPHERD CONDUCTED A COMPREHENSIVE 2017-2019 CHNA WHICH INCLUDED THE SELECTION OF HEALTH PRIORITIES THROUGH A CONSENSUS PRIORITIZATION PROCESS BY THE COMMUNITY HEALTH COUNCIL. THE COUNCIL RECOMMENDED, AND THE HOSPITAL GOVERNING COUNCIL APPROVED, TWO HEALTH AREAS FOR PRIORITY ACTION: 1) OBESITY; AND 2) SUBSTANCE ABUSE. STEPS BEING TAKEN TO ADDRESS THE TWO PRIORITIES ARE PROVIDED BELOW.HEALTH NEEDS SELECTED OBESITY. OBESITY WAS SELECTED AS A HEALTH PRIORITY FOR THE 2017-2019 CHNA. SINCE THE PREVIOUS CHNA, THE PREVALENCE OF OBESITY IN THE U.S. HAS CONTINUED TO STEADILY INCREASE. IN 2017, OBESITY PREVALENCE RATES FOR ILLINOIS REMAINED BETWEEN 30 AND 35 PERCENT. THE RATES ARE EVEN HIGHER FOR ILLINOIS HISPANIC ADULTS AND NON-HISPANIC AFRICAN AMERICAN ADULTS (PREVALENCE OF SELF-REPORTED OBESITY AMONG U.S. ADULTS BY RACE/ETHNICITY, STATE AND TERRITORY, BRFSS, 2017). MORE THAN SIXTEEN PERCENT OF ILLINOIS ADOLESCENTS ARE OBESE. FIFTEEN PERCENT OF ILLINOIS WIC PRESCHOOLERS, AGES TWO TO FOUR, ARE OBESE. IN LAKE COUNTY, 24 PERCENT OF ADULTS ARE OBESE, AND THE RATE IS 26 PERCENT IN MCHENRY COUNTY. SEVEN PERCENT OF LAKE COUNTY ADULTS ARE FOOD INSECURE AND 13 PERCENT OF MCHENRY COUNTY ADULTS ARE FOOD INSECURE. OBESITY IS A SERIOUS CONCERN BECAUSE IT IS ASSOCIATED WITH POORER MENTAL HEALTH OUTCOMES, REDUCED QUALITY OF LIFE, AND THE LEADING CAUSES OF DEATH IN THE U.S. AND WORLDWIDE, INCLUDING DIABETES, HEART DISEASE, STROKE, AND SOME TYPES OF CANCER (CENTERS FOR DISEASE CONTROL AND PREVENTION, ADULT OVERWEIGHT AND OBESITY CAUSES AND CONSEQUENCES, 2017). BECAUSE OF ITS STRONG CORRELATION TO CHRONIC DISEASES AND OTHER HEALTH CONDITIONS, THE CHC VOTED TO CONTINUE FOCUSING ON OBESITY AS A PRIORITY HEALTH ISSUE. SUBSTANCE ABUSE. SUBSTANCE ABUSE WAS THE SECOND HEALTH ISSUE IDENTIFIED AS A PRIORITY NEED WITHIN THE ADVOCATE GOOD SHEPHERD PSA. TWO SPECIFIC HEALTH BEHAVIORS WERE DISCUSSED AS CENTRAL TO THE ISSUE IN THE PSAEXCESSIVE ALCOHOL USE IN ADULTS AND THE HIGH PERCENTAGE OF TEENS USING ELECTRONIC CIGARETTES (VAPING). THE HOSPITALIZATION RATE DUE TO ALCOHOL USE IN ADULTS IS IN THE WORST 25TH PERCENTILE COMPARED TO OTHER ILLINOIS COUNTIES FOR THE PSA. SURVEY RESULTS FROM THE 2018 LAKE COUNTY SURVEY INDICATED THAT 77 PERCENT OF ADULTS HAD A DRINK OR ALCOHOL IN THE PAST 30 DAYS, AND 31 PERCENT INDICATED THAT THEY HAD BINGED ALCOHOL ONE OR MORE TIMES IN THE PAST 30 DAYS. THE ALCOHOL IMPAIRED DRIVING DEATH RATES FOR LAKE AND MCHENRY COUNTY ARE ALSO IN THE WORST 25TH PERCENTILE COMPARED TO OTHER ILLINOIS COUNTIES, AND THE RATE IS CONTINUING TO INCREASE IN MCHENRY COUNTY. THE RATE OF TEENS IN BOTH COUNTIES THAT USE ALCOHOL AND MARIJUANA ARE IN THE WORST 50TH75TH PERCENTILE AND VAPING RATES ARE HIGH WITH 37 PERCENT OF MCHENRY COUNTY AND 31 PERCENT OF LAKE COUNTY HIGH SCHOOL SENIORS INDICATING IN 2018 THAT THEY HAD USED E-CIGARETTES IN THE LAST 30 DAYS. ALCOHOL USE, MARIJUANA USE AND VAPING ARE ALREADY AREAS OF FOCUS IN THE MCHENRY COUNTY SUBSTANCE ABUSE COALITION AND THE LAKE COUNTY OPIOID INITIATIVE TASK FORCE. NEW INITIATIVES ARE IN THE INITIAL PLANNING STAGES, WHICH ALLOWS ADVOCATE GOOD SHEPHERD THE OPPORTUNITY TO BUILD A COLLABORATIVE APPROACH WITH COMMUNITY PARTNERS TO ADDRESS THESE SERIOUS SUBSTANCE USE ISSUES AS A PRIORITY. HEALTH NEEDS NOT SELECTED DIABETES. DIABETES WAS NOT IDENTIFIED AS ONE OF THE PRIORITY HEALTH NEEDS FOR THE ADVOCATE GOOD SHEPHERD PSA, ALTHOUGH DIABETES PREVALENCE IS INCREASING OVER TIME BOTH NATIONALLY AND LOCALLY. ACTION TEAMS ARE ACTIVELY ADDRESSING DIABETES IN BOTH LAKE COUNTY AND MCHENRY COUNTY, COORDINATED THROUGH EACH OF THE LOCAL HEALTH DEPARTMENTS. EVIDENCE-BASED INITIATIVES ARE UNDERWAY, INCLUDING THE DIABETES SELF-MANAGEMENT PROGRAM (STANFORD MODEL) AND DIABETES PREVENTION PROGRAM IN BOTH COUNTIES. ACTIVITIES INCLUDE DIABETES PREVENTION, DIABETES SCREENING TO IDENTIFY DIABETES AND PRE-DIABETES, AND EDUCATION ON DIABETES SELF-MANAGEMENT. BECAUSE PROGRAMS TO ADDRESS DIABETES ARE ALREADY IN PLACE, THE CHC MADE THE DECISION TO NOT SELECT IT AS A PRIORITY.CARDIOVASCULAR DISEASE. CARDIOVASCULAR DISEASE WAS NOT SELECTED AS A HEALTH PRIORITY. OVER THE PAST DECADE, HEART DISEASE DEATH RATES HAVE DROPPED IN BOTH LAKE COUNTY AND MCHENRY COUNTY. WHILE HEART DISEASE RATES ARE DECLINING, MALES AND OLDER ADULTS HAVE SLIGHTLY HIGHER RATES. THE HOSPITAL CURRENTLY PROMOTES AND CONDUCTS HEART HEALTH RISK ASSESSMENTS USING THE AMERICAN HEART ASSOCIATION TOOL, CONDUCTS HEART SCAN CTS TO IDENTIFY CALCIUM IN THE HEART, AND PROMOTES PREVENTION MEASURES SUCH AS GOOD NUTRITION AND PHYSICAL ACTIVITY IN THE COMMUNITY. ALL OF THESE ACTIVITIES ARE COORDINATED WITH THE ADVOCATE HEART INSTITUTE PROGRAMS FOCUSED ON TREATING CARDIOVASCULAR DISEASE IN THE PSA AND THE PUBLIC HEALTH DEPARTMENTS IN MCHENRY COUNTY AND LAKE COUNTY. SINCE HEART DISEASE DEATH RATES ARE DECLINING AND MANY COMMUNITY-BASED PROGRAMS TO ADDRESS CARDIOVASCULAR DISEASE ARE ALREADY ACTIVE, THE CHC DECIDED IT WAS MORE BENEFICIAL TO PRIORITIZE OBESITY BECAUSE OF ITS IMPACT ON THE RISK FOR HEART DISEASE. MENTAL HEALTH. MENTAL HEALTH WAS NOT SELECTED AS A PRIORITY FOR THE CURRENT CHNA CYCLE EVEN THOUGH IT WAS SELECTED IN THE PREVIOUS CHNA CYCLE. AS OF 2015-2017, ER RATES FOR THE PSA (BOTH FOR ADULTS AND PEDIATRICS) DUE TO MENTAL HEALTH ARE IN THE BEST 50TH PERCENTILE RANGE. OVER THE PAST THREE YEARS, ADVOCATE GOOD SHEPHERD HAS IMPLEMENTED THE MENTAL HEALTH FIRST AID THROUGHOUT THE PSA. IN BOTH LAKE COUNTY AND MCHENRY COUNTY, THERE ARE NOW COUNTY-WIDE INITIATIVES IN PLACE TO IMPLEMENT MHFA TRAINING, INVOLVING STAKEHOLDERS FROM ACROSS THE COUNTY. ADVOCATE GOOD SHEPHERD COMMUNITY HEALTH STAFF HAVE BEEN ACTIVE MEMBERS OF THE MHFA ACTION TEAM IN LAKE COUNTY. SINCE A GREAT DEAL OF WORK IS ALREADY BEING DONE TO ADDRESS MENTAL HEALTH IN THE PSA, THE CHC VOTED FOR THE HOSPITAL TO TURN ITS ATTENTION TO SUBSTANCE ABUSE FOR THE NEXT THREE-YEAR PERIOD."

THE ONLY EXCEPTION IS FOR BREAST CANCER, WHICH IS INCREASING AT A STATISTICALLY SIGNIFICANT RATE. AS PART OF THE REQUIREMENTS TO MAINTAIN CERTIFICATION WITH THE COMMISSION ON CANCER, ADVOCATE GOOD SHEPHERD IMPLEMENTS CANCER SCREENING, AND PREVENTION EDUCATION ON AN ANNUAL BASIS. OVER THE PAST THREE YEARS, COMMUNITY HEALTH STAFF HAVE WORKED WITH THE ADVOCATE GOOD SHEPHERD CANCER CENTER STAFF TO ADDRESS BARRIERS TO NAVIGATION AND PROMOTE EARLY SCREENING AND DETECTION FOR COLORECTAL CANCER, SKIN CANCER AND LUNG CANCER. BECAUSE ACTIVITIES RELATED TO CANCER SCREENING AND PREVENTION ARE ALREADY INTEGRATED INTO THE REGULAR PROGRAMMING OF BOTH THE COMMUNITY HEALTH PROGRAM AND THE CANCER CENTER, AND CANCER INCIDENCE RATES ARE TRENDING DOWN FOR ALL BUT BREAST CANCER, THE CHC DETERMINED IT WAS PRUDENT TO FOCUS ON OTHER HEALTH PRIORITIES."

OBESITY WAS SELECTED AS ONE OF THE THREE TOP HEALTH PRIORITIES BY THE MCLEAN COUNTY COMMUNITY HEALTH COUNCIL FOR THE 2016 MCLEAN COUNTY CHNA BECAUSE IT RANKED AS NUMBER THREE ACCORDING TO ITS PRIORITY SCORE OF 153.8 FROM THE HANLON METHOD. ADDITIONALLY, THE COUNCIL FELT THAT BY IMPROVING OBESITY, MANY OTHER HEALTH OUTCOMES, SUCH AS HEART DISEASE, CANCER AND DIABETES MAY ALSO BE POSITIVELY IMPACTED. IT WAS ALSO SELECTED BECAUSE OBESITY IS A WIDESPREAD ISSUE AFFECTING MANY PEOPLE ACROSS ALL SOCIAL AND ECONOMIC SECTORS. THERE WERE ALSO MANY SIGNIFICANT EFFORTS UNDERWAY IN THE COMMUNITY RELATED TO OBESITY THROUGH THE MCLEAN COUNTY WELLNESS COALITION. THE HEALTH DEPARTMENT AND BOTH HOSPITALS ARE A PART OF THE MCLEAN COUNTY WELLNESS COALITION (NOW KNOWN AS THE HEALTHY EATING/ACTIVE LIVING PRIORITY ACTION TEAM).

THIS WAS A NEW SERVICE FOR THE MCLEAN COUNTY COMMUNITY. COVERAGE IS PROVIDED BY THE NEONATOLOGISTS FROM ADVOCATE CHILDREN'S. AS AN INTERMEDIATE CARE NURSERY WITH THIS ENHANCED LEVEL OF PHYSICIAN COVERAGE, THE HOSPITAL CAN KEEP BABIES AS YOUNG AS 32 WEEKS GESTATION. THIS ALLOWS NEW MOMS AND BABIES TO STAY TOGETHER, PROVIDING EXCELLENT OUTCOMES FOR FAMILIES.IN ADDITION, THE MCLEAN COUNTY HEALTH DEPARTMENT HAS THREE PROGRAMS AVAILABLE WHICH PROMOTE HEALTHY PREGNANCIES AND CONNECT PREGNANT WOMEN TO HEALTH AND WELLNESS SERVICES: ALL OUR KIDS EARLY CHILDHOOD NETWORK, FAMILY CASE MANAGEMENT, AND WOMEN, INFANTS AND CHILDREN (WIC). ORAL HEALTH. THERE WAS SOME DISCUSSION IN THE PRIORITIZATION MEETING ABOUT SELECTING ORAL HEALTH AS ONE OF THE THREE HEALTH PRIORITIES IN PLACE OF ONE OF THE THREE HIGHEST PRIORITY SCORING HEALTH CONCERNS. ORAL HEALTH RANKED CLOSELY BEHIND OBESITY (153.8) WITH A PRIORITY SCORE OF 148.4. ALTHOUGH ORAL HEALTH WAS DEEMED AS AN EXTREMELY IMPORTANT ISSUE IN MCLEAN COUNTY, THE MCLEAN COUNTY COMMUNITY HEALTH COUNCIL AGREED TO PROCEED WITH THE THREE ISSUES THAT RECEIVED THE HIGHEST PRIORITY SCORES. THIS WAS PARTIALLY DUE TO THE EFFORTS CURRENTLY IN PLACE TO ASSIST INDIVIDUALS WITHOUT DENTAL INSURANCE OR MEDICAID TO RECEIVE CARE. SOME EXAMPLES OF STEPS TAKEN TO ADDRESS ORAL HEALTH INCLUDE THE FOLLOWING. ADVOCATE BROMENN'S PRESIDENT AND/OR THE COMMUNITY HEALTH DIRECTOR ATTENDED SEVERAL ORAL HEALTH COLLABORATIVE MEETINGS WITH THE MCLEAN COUNTY PUBLIC HEALTH DEPARTMENT, OSF ST. JOSEPH MEDICAL CENTER, THE COMMUNITY HEALTH CARE CLINIC AND CHESTNUT HEALTH SYSTEMS TO DISCUSS THE ISSUE OF ACCESS TO DENTAL CARE FOR UNINSURED ADULTS IN MCLEAN COUNTY. FURTHERMORE, AN ADVOCATE MEDICAL GROUP PEDIATRICIAN'S OFFICE LOCATED IN NORMAL, ILLINOIS, HAS ALSO BEEN PARTICIPATING FOR SEVERAL YEARS IN THE BRIGHT SMILES FROM BIRTH PROGRAM THROUGH THE ILLINOIS CHAPTER OF THE AMERICAN ACADEMY OF PEDIATRICS, AND THE ADVOCATE BROMENN FAMILY HEALTH CARE CLINIC BEGAN THE PROGRAM IN 2017. AFTER COMPLETING A COURSE, THE OFFICE CAN BILL MEDICAID FOR THE APPLICATION OF FLUORIDE VARNISH ON FULLY ERUPTED TEETH OF CHILDREN UNDER THREE YEARS OF AGE. EACH FLUORIDE APPLICATION CAN BE DONE THREE TIMES PER YEAR. THE FLUORIDE SERVES TO PROTECT THE BABY TEETH RESULTING IN FEWER CAVITIES. THE MCLEAN COUNTY HEALTH DEPARTMENT ALSO PROVIDES A DENTAL CLINIC WITH INTERVENTION CARE FOR ADULTS (NO PREGNANT WOMEN), AND PREVENTIVE CARE AND INTERVENTION FOR KIDS. HEARTLAND HEAD START COORDINATES REFERRALS TO DENTAL CARE FOR KIDS SIX WEEKS TO FIVE YEARS AS WELL AS PREGNANT WOMEN. EXTRACTION CLINICS ARE HELD TWICE PER YEAR AT A LOCAL ORAL SURGEON'S OFFICE. RESPIRATORY DISEASE. ONE OF THE REASONS RESPIRATORY DISEASE WAS NOT SELECTED AS ONE OF THE TOP THREE HEALTH PRIORITIES FOR MCLEAN COUNTY WAS THAT IT RANKED FIFTH ACCORDING TO ITS PRIORITY SCORE OF 121 AND THE MCLEAN COUNTY COMMUNITY HEALTH COUNCIL DID NOT FEEL THAT THERE WAS A COMPELLING REASON TO ELIMINATE ONE OF THE HEALTH CONCERNS THAT RANKED IN THE TOP THREE. THE COUNCIL DID DISCUSS THAT IMPROVING ACCESS TO APPROPRIATE HEALTHCARE MAY POSSIBLY ALSO IMPROVE HEALTH OUTCOMES FOR RESPIRATORY DISEASE, PARTICULARLY IN AREAS OF HIGH SOCIOECONOMIC NEEDS.2017-2019 CHNAHEALTH NEEDS SELECTED ACCESS TO CARE. ACCESS TO CARE WAS SELECTED AS A SIGNIFICANT HEALTH NEED TO BE ADDRESSED BY THE MCLEAN COUNTY COMMUNITY HEALTH COUNCIL NOT ONLY BECAUSE OF ITS HIGH PRIORITY SCORE (160.3), BUT FOR SEVERAL OTHER REASONS. ACCESS TO APPROPRIATE CARE IS AN IMPORTANT ISSUE THAT AFFECTS MANY HEALTH OUTCOMES. IMPROVING ACCESS IN CERTAIN AREAS AND FOR CERTAIN POPULATIONS CAN HAVE A WIDESPREAD IMPACT ON A VARIETY OF HEALTH OUTCOMES RANGING FROM ORAL HEALTH TO RESPIRATORY DISEASE. DATA PRESENTED TO THE COUNCIL ALSO INDICATED THAT THERE ARE SIGNIFICANT GEOGRAPHIC AND RACIAL/ETHNIC DISPARITIES IN MCLEAN COUNTY THAT MAY BE RELATED TO ACCESS TO CARE. RESEARCH AND SUBJECT MATTER EXPERTISE SUGGESTED THAT THERE ARE A VARIETY OF FACTORS THAT CAN IMPROVE ACCESS TO CARE, RANGING FROM INCREASED HOURS OF OPERATION FOR URGENT CARE CLINICS AND PRIMARY CARE OFFICES, TO TRANSPORTATION AND EDUCATION OF BOTH CONSUMERS AND PROVIDERS. ACCESS TO APPROPRIATE CARE WAS ALSO SELECTED AS A HEALTH PRIORITY FOR THE 2016 MCLEAN COUNTY CHNA.THE 2020-2022 MCLEAN COUNTY COMMUNITY HEALTH IMPROVEMENT PLAN WILL BE A JOINT PLAN FOR THE ENTIRE COUNTY AND CONSIST OF INTERVENTIONS AND RESOURCES TO BE PROVIDED BY THE HOSPITALS, HEALTH DEPARTMENT, FAMILY HEALTH CENTER AND NUMEROUS SOCIAL SERVICES OR OTHER COMMUNITY ORGANIZATIONS.THE ACCESS TO CARE PRIORITY ACTION TEAM MEETING WAS HELD ON APRIL 29, 2019. THE FOLLOWING GOAL WAS ESTABLISHED DURING THE MEETING: ENSURE APPROPRIATE ACCESS TO CARE TO IMPROVE THE HEALTH AND WELL-BEING OF OUR RESIDENTS, NEIGHBORHOODS AND COUNTY BY 2023. HIGHLIGHTS FOR STEPS THAT WILL BE TAKEN AS A PART OF THE 2020-2022 MCLEAN COUNTY COMMUNITY HEALTH IMPROVEMENT PLAN TO ADDRESS ACCESS TO CARE ARE LISTED BELOW: SUPPORT LINKAGE/NAVIGATION PROGRAMS CAATCH (COORDINATING APPROPRIATE ACCESS TO COMPREHENSIVE CARE) COHESION PROJECT EXPAND APPLICATION OF FLUORIDE VARNISH APPLICATION IN PEDIATRIC SETTINGS TRANSPORTATION ACCESS INVENTORY OF COMMITTEES IDENTIFY GAPS IN TRANSPORTATION SERVICES INCREASE HEALTHCARE REPRESENTATION ON TRANSPORTATION COMMITTEES INCREASE USE OF TELEMEDICINE/VIRTUAL HEALTHCARE INCREASE THE # OF FTES FOR DENTISTS AND HYGIENISTS SERVING LOW-INCOME CLIENTS.ADDITIONAL INTERVENTIONS ARE LISTED IN THE 2020-2022 MCLEAN COUNTY COMMUNITY HEALTH IMPROVEMENT PLAN AT HTTPS://WWW.ADVOCATEHEALTH.COM/HOSPITAL-CHNA-REPORTS-IMPLEMENTATION-PLANS-PROGRESS-REPORTS/BROMENN-CHNA-REPORT-2019BEHAVIORAL HEALTH (MENTAL HEALTH AND SUBSTANCE ABUSE. BEHAVIORAL HEALTH WAS SELECTED AS A SIGNIFICANT HEALTH NEED TO BE ADDRESSED BY THE MCLEAN COUNTY COMMUNITY HEALTH COUNCIL FOR SEVERAL REASONS. BEHAVIORAL HEALTH RECEIVED THE HIGHEST PRIORITY SCORE (162.5) CLEARLY INDICATING THE NEED FOR FURTHER IMPROVEMENTS IN THIS AREA IN MCLEAN COUNTY. IN ADDITION, THERE ARE NUMEROUS HEALTH DISPARITIES IN BLOOMINGTON ZIP CODE 61701 FOR BOTH MENTAL HEALTH AND SUBSTANCE ABUSE. THERE HAS ALSO BEEN A GREAT DEAL OF PUBLIC SUPPORT AND MOMENTUM BEHIND MENTAL HEALTH IN MCLEAN COUNTY FOR THE LAST SEVERAL YEARS. MCLEAN COUNTY IS WELL SITUATED TO CONTINUE TO COLLABORATE ON MENTAL HEALTH DUE TO THE ON-GOING EFFORTS OF NUMEROUS ORGANIZATIONS AND THE MCLEAN COUNTY GOVERNMENT. MENTAL HEALTH WAS ALSO PREVIOUSLY SELECTED AS A KEY HEALTH PRIORITY FOR THE 2016 MCLEAN COUNTY CHNA GIVING FURTHER MOMENTUM TO THE EFFORTS OF IMPROVING MENTAL HEALTH FOR COUNTY RESIDENTS.THE BEHAVIORAL HEALTH PRIORITY ACTION TEAM MEETING WAS HELD ON APRIL 30, 2019. THE FOLLOWING GOAL WAS ESTABLISHED DURING THE MEETING: ADVANCE A SYSTEMIC COMMUNITY APPROACH TO ENHANCE BEHAVIORAL HEALTH AND WELL-BEING BY 2023.HIGHLIGHTS FOR STEPS THAT WILL BE TAKEN AS A PART OF THE 2020-2022 MCLEAN COUNTY COMMUNITY HEALTH IMPROVEMENT PLAN TO ADDRESS BEHAVIORAL HEALTH ARE LISTED BELOW: EMBEDDED BEHAVIORAL HEALTH IN SCHOOLS BEHAVIORAL HEALTH FORUM TRAUMA-INFORMED CARE COLLABORATIVE SUBSTANCE USE COALITION SUPPORT TELEPSYCHIATRY CONDUCT A GAP IN SERVICES ASSESSMENT SUPPORT FUSE (FREQUENT USERS SYSTEM ENGAGEMENT) SUPPORT 24/7 TRIAGE CENTER SUPPORT EVIDENCE-BASED PROGRAMS: PEARLS MENTAL HEALTH FIRST AID ENDING THE SILENCE TOO GOOD FOR DRUGS SOCIAL MEDIA CAMPAIGN SUPPORT INTEGRATED OR CO-LOCATED BEHAVIORAL HEALTH AT PRIMARY CAREADDITIONAL INTERVENTIONS ARE LISTED IN THE 2020-2022 MCLEAN COUNTY COMMUNITY HEALTH IMPROVEMENT PLAN AT HTTPS://WWW.ADVOCATEHEALTH.COM/HOSPITAL-CHNA-REPORTS-IMPLEMENTATION-PLANS-PROGRESS-REPORTS/BROMENN-CHNA-REPORT-2019"

HEALTHY EATING/ACTIVE LIVING WAS SELECTED AS A SIGNIFICANT HEALTH NEED TO BE ADDRESSED BY THE MCLEAN COUNTY COMMUNITY HEALTH COUNCIL BECAUSE IT RANKED AS NUMBER THREE ACCORDING TO ITS PRIORITY SCORE OF 158.1. ADDITIONALLY, THE COUNCIL FELT THAT BY FOCUSING ON HEALTHY EATING/ACTIVE LIVING, MANY OTHER HEALTH OUTCOMES SUCH AS HEART DISEASE, CANCER AND DIABETES MAY ALSO POSITIVELY BE IMPACTED. IT WAS ALSO SELECTED BECAUSE OBESITY IS A WIDESPREAD ISSUE AFFECTING SO MANY PEOPLE AND IT DOES NOT DISCRIMINATE. FOOD INSECURITY AND FOOD ACCESS ARE ALSO AREAS NEEDING IMPROVEMENT IN MCLEAN COUNTY. OBESITY WAS ALSO SELECTED AS A HEALTH PRIORITY FOR THE 2016 MCLEAN COUNTY CHNA.THE HEALTHY EATING/ACTIVE LIVING PRIORITY ACTION TEAM MEETING WAS HELD ON MAY 9, 2019.

THE COUNCIL DID DISCUSS THAT IMPROVING ACCESS TO CARE MAY POSSIBLY ALSO IMPROVE HEALTH OUTCOMES FOR HEART DISEASE, PARTICULARLY IN AREAS OF HIGH SOCIOECONOMIC NEEDS.ORAL HEALTH. ALTHOUGH ORAL HEALTH IS DEEMED AS AN EXTREMELY IMPORTANT ISSUE IN MCLEAN COUNTY, THE MCLEAN COUNTY COMMUNITY HEALTH COUNCIL AGREED TO ADDRESS THE THREE NEEDS THAT RECEIVED THE HIGHEST PRIORITY SCORES. ORAL HEALTH WAS RANKED FIFTH WITH A SCORE OF 107.7. THE COUNCIL DID DISCUSS THAT ORAL HEALTH IS ALSO AN ACCESS ISSUE AND CAN FIT UNDER ACCESS TO CARE. THE OPENING OF A NEW DENTAL CLINIC FOR INDIVIDUALS WITHOUT HEALTH INSURANCE, WHICH IS SUPPORTED BY ADVOCATE BROMENN AND OSF ST. JOSEPH MEDICAL CENTER, MAY ASSIST IN IMPROVING ACCESS TO ORAL HEALTH CARE IN MCLEAN COUNTY. RESPIRATORY DISEASE. ONE OF THE REASONS RESPIRATORY DISEASE WAS NOT SELECTED AS A HEALTH NEED TO BE ADDRESSED WAS THAT IT RANKED SIXTH ACCORDING TO ITS PRIORITY SCORE OF 81.1 AND THE MCLEAN COUNTY COMMUNITY HEALTH COUNCIL DID NOT FEEL THAT THERE WAS A COMPELLING REASON TO ELIMINATE ONE OF THE HEALTH CONCERNS THAT RANKED IN THE TOP THREE.

202003239349301515,362169147,"SCHEDULE H, PART V, LINE 11 - ADVOCATE EUREKA HOSPITAL","A SECOND REASON MENTAL HEALTH WAS SELECTED IS BECAUSE THE AGE-ADJUSTED DEATH RATE DUE TO SUICIDE IN WOODFORD COUNTY IS IN THE WORST 25TH PERCENTILE RANGE (RED INDICATOR) COMPARED TO OTHER COUNTIES IN THE U.S., IS HIGHER THAN THE ILLINOIS VALUE, DOES NOT MEET THE HEALTHY PEOPLE 2020 TARGET AND IS HIGHER THAN BOTH PEORIA AND TAZEWELL COUNTIES. ADDITIONALLY, 27 PERCENT OF WOODFORD COUNTY SURVEY RESPONDENTS WHO REPORTED THAT THEY DID NOT HAVE ACCESS TO CARE CITED EMBARRASSMENT AS THE REASON. THE CONTINUATION OF THE EVIDENCE-BASED MENTAL HEALTH FIRST AID CLASS HELPS DECREASE THE STIGMA ASSOCIATED WITH MENTAL HEALTH AND HAS BEEN OFFERED BY ADVOCATE EUREKA FOR SEVERAL YEARS.ADVOCATE EUREKA ALSO SELECTED MENTAL HEALTH AS A SIGNIFICANT HEALTH NEED BECAUSE A FEW OF THE HIGH SOCIONEEDS ZIP CODESSPECIFICALLY EL PASO, WASHBURN AND LOWPOINTHAD HIGHER VALUES THAN THE COUNTY VALUE FOR SOME OF THE AGE-ADJUSTED EMERGENCY ROOM RATES; MENTAL HEALTH, PEDIATRIC MENTAL HEALTH AND/OR SUICIDE AND SELF-INFLICTED INJURY FOR BOTH ADULTS AND ADOLESCENTS.THE FOURTH REASON MENTAL HEALTH WAS SELECTED AS A SIGNIFICANT HEALTH NEED FOR ADVOCATE EUREKA'S CHNA IS BECAUSE MENTAL HEALTH WAS A HEALTH PRIORITY OR SIGNIFICANT HEALTH NEED FOR BOTH THE 2013 AND 2016 ADVOCATE EUREKA CHNA.IT WAS CLEAR FROM COMMUNITY INPUT AND CURRENT DATA THAT CONTINUED EFFORTS ARE NEEDED TO REDUCE THE STIGMA ASSOCIATED WITH MENTAL HEALTH AND GIVE FURTHER MOMENTUM TO THE EFFORTS OF IMPROVING MENTAL HEALTH FOR COUNTY RESIDENTS.ADVOCATE EUREKA PARTICIPATED IN THE PARTNERSHIP FOR A HEALTHY COMMUNITY (PFHC) AD-HOC CHNA COLLABORATIVE GOAL SETTING MEETINGS FOR THE 2020-2022 PFHC COMMUNITY HEALTH IMPROVEMENT PLAN. ALTHOUGH THE HOSPITAL IS PRIMARILY FOCUSING ON WOODFORD COUNTY AND TWO OF THE FOUR SIGNIFICANT HEALTH NEEDS SELECTED FOR THE TRI-COUNTY REGION, STAFF FROM THE HOSPITAL WILL PARTICIPATE IN THE PFHC PRIORITY ACTION TEAMS AND WILL SUPPORT THE TRI-COUNTY GOALS LISTED BELOW FOR ADVOCATE EUREKA'S SELECTED HEALTH NEEDS FOR ITS 2020-2022 IMPLEMENTATION PLAN.THE MENTAL HEALTH GOAL ESTABLISHED BY THE PFHC BEHAVIORAL HEALTH PRIORITY ACTION TEAM IS TO IMPROVE MENTAL HEALTH AMONG TRI-COUNTY RESIDENTS THROUGH PREVENTATIVE STRATEGIES AND INCREASED ACCESS TO SERVICES.HIGHLIGHTS FOR STEPS THAT WILL BE TAKEN AS A PART OF THE 2020-2022 ADVOCATE EUREKA IMPLEMENTATION STRATEGY TO ADDRESS MENTAL HEALTH ARE LISTED BELOW: ADVOCATE EUREKA WILL HAVE A STAFF MEMBER SERVE ON THE PARTNERSHIP FOR A HEALTHY COMMUNITY BEHAVIORAL HEALTH PRIORITY ACTION TEAM FOR THE 2020-2022 IMPLEMENTATION PERIOD. THE COMMUNITY HEALTH DIRECTOR ALSO SERVES ON THE PARTNERSHIP FOR A HEALTHY COMMUNITY BOARD FOR THE TRI-COUNTY REGION AND WILL CONTINUE TO LOOK FOR WAYS THE HOSPITAL CAN SUPPORT BEHAVIORAL HEALTH IN THE TRI-COUNTY REGION, WITH A FOCUS ON WOODFORD COUNTY.TO IMPROVE MENTAL HEALTH IN WOODFORD COUNTY, THE HOSPITAL WILL ALSO CONTINUE ITS COLLABORATION WITH THE TAZWOOD CENTER FOR WELLNESS TO ALLOW WOODFORD COUNTY RESIDENTS TO RECEIVE MENTAL HEALTH SERVICES LOCALLY INSTEAD OF TRAVELLING OUTSIDE OF THE COUNTY FOR CARE. IN JUNE 2016 THE COUNSELING APPOINTMENTS, PREVIOUSLY HELD AT THE WOODFORD COUNTY HEALTH DEPARTMENT, BY THE TAZWOOD CENTER FOR WELLNESS, MOVED TO ADVOCATE EUREKA. THE MOVE TO THE HOSPITAL IMPROVES ACCESS TO MENTAL HEALTH SERVICES BECAUSE IT ALLOWS FOR RESIDENTS TO SCHEDULE APPOINTMENTS LATER IN THE EVENING. TELEPSYCHIATRY WILL ALSO CONTINUE TO BE OFFERED AT ADVOCATE EUREKA TO IMPROVE ACCESS TO MENTAL HEALTH SERVICES.FOR THE 2020-2022 HOSPITAL IMPLEMENTATION PLAN, IT IS ALSO HOPED THAT THE PARTNERSHIP BETWEEN ADVOCATE MEDICAL GROUP (AMG) BEHAVIORAL HEALTH, TRI-COUNTY SPECIAL EDUCATION ASSOCIATION AND ILLINOIS STATE UNIVERSITY'S PSYCHOLOGICAL SERVICES CENTER CONTINUES. AS A RESULT OF THIS PARTNERSHIP, DOCTORAL LEVEL PSYCHOLOGY INTERNS PROVIDE FOUR DAYS OF INTEGRATED BEHAVIORAL HEALTH SERVICES ACROSS THREE ADVOCATE SETTINGS IN CENTRAL ILLINOIS, ADVOCATE BROMENN OUTPATIENT CENTER, EL PASO FAMILY PRACTICE AND EUREKA FAMILY PRACTICE.ADVOCATE EUREKA PLANS TO CONTINUE OFFERING MENTAL HEALTH FIRST AID (MHFA), AN EVIDENCE-BASED MENTAL HEALTH PROGRAM TO THE COMMUNITY. MHFA IS A NATIONALLY RECOGNIZED ADULT PUBLIC EDUCATION PROGRAM THAT TEACHES INDIVIDUALS HOW TO IDENTIFY, UNDERSTAND AND RESPOND TO THE SIGNS OF MENTAL ILLNESS AND SUBSTANCE ABUSE DISORDERS. PARTICIPANTS LEARN ABOUT THE SIGNS AND SYMPTOMS OF ACUTE MENTAL HEALTH CRISES AND CHRONIC MENTAL HEALTH PROBLEMS LIKE ANXIETY AND DEPRESSION. CERTIFIED INSTRUCTORS TEACH PARTICIPANTS TO BECOME MENTAL HEALTH FIRST AIDERS. IN APRIL 2016, ADVOCATE EUREKA SENT AN EMPLOYEE TO BECOME A CERTIFIED MENTAL HEALTH FIRST AID TRAINER. THE HOSPITAL WILL COLLABORATE WITH THE TRI-COUNTY HEALTH DEPARTMENTS AND THE CENTRAL ILLINOIS AREA HEALTH EDUCATION CENTER COMMUNITY PARTNERS TO OFFER THIS PROGRAM. EACH YEAR, UPON REQUEST, THE MHFA INSTRUCTOR FROM ADVOCATE EUREKA ALSO OFFERS A MHFA COURSE FOR RESIDENTIAL ASSISTANTS AT EUREKA COLLEGE AND TEACHES SESSIONS ON DEPRESSION AND ANXIETY FOR HIGH SCHOOL FRESHMEN. LASTLY, ADVOCATE EUREKA WILL OFFER ADVERSE CHILDHOOD EXPERIENCES (ACES) PRESENTATIONS TO HOSPITAL STAFF AND THE COMMUNITY.HEALTHY EATING/ACTIVE LIVING. ADVOCATE EUREKA SELECTED HEALTHY EATING/ACTIVE LIVING AS A SIGNIFICANT HEALTH NEED FROM THE FOUR NEEDS SELECTED BY THE PFHC AD-HOC CHNA COLLABORATIVE TEAM FOR SEVERAL REASONS. A HEALTHY LIFESTYLE OF REGULAR PHYSICAL ACTIVITY AND A HEALTHY DIET SERVES AS A FOUNDATION FOR GOOD MENTAL, PHYSICAL AND EMOTIONAL HEALTH AND IS KEY IN PREVENTING NUMEROUS CHRONIC DISEASES. FIFTY-FIVE PERCENT OF TRI-COUNTY COMMUNITY HEALTH SURVEY RESPONDENTS ALSO RATED BEING OVERWEIGHT OR OBESITY AS ONE OF THE TOP PERCEIVED HEALTH NEEDS IN THE COUNTY. ALTHOUGH WOODFORD COUNTY IS SURROUNDED BY FARMLAND, THE PERCENTAGE OF ADULTS WHO EAT FRUITS AND VEGETABLES FIVE OR MORE TIMES PER DAY IS LOW AT 11.6 PERCENT AND IS IN THE WORST 25TH PERCENTILE RANGE (RED INDICATOR) IN COMPARISON TO OTHER COUNTIES IN ILLINOIS. IN ADDITION TO NOT EATING ENOUGH FRUITS AND VEGETABLES, THE 2018 TRI-COUNTY COMMUNITY HEALTH SURVEY DATA SHOW THAT 26 PERCENT OF WOODFORD COUNTY SURVEY RESPONDENTS INDICATED THAT THEY DO NOT EXERCISE AT ALL, WHILE 34 PERCENT ONLY EXERCISE ONE TO TWO TIMES PER WEEK.AN ADDITIONAL REASON ADVOCATE EUREKA SELECTED HEALTHY EATING/ACTIVE LIVING AS ONE OF THE TWO SIGNIFICANT NEEDS FOR ITS 2019 CHNA IS DUE TO THE HOSPITAL RESOURCES AND STAFFING AVAILABLE TO ASSIST WITH THIS ISSUE FOR WOODFORD COUNTY AS WELL AS THE TRI-COUNTY REGION. THE HOSPITAL'S CHNA TEAM FELT THAT AS A CRITICAL ACCESS HOSPITAL, IT COULD MAKE SIGNIFICANTLY MORE CONTRIBUTIONS TOWARD IMPROVING HEALTHY EATING/ACTIVE LIVING IN THE COUNTY THAN WITH SUBSTANCE USE OR CANCER. THE GOAL ESTABLISHED BY THE PFHC HEALTHY EATING/ACTIVE LIVING (HEAL) PRIORITY ACTION TEAM IS TO FOSTER AND PROMOTE HEALTHY EATING AND ACTIVE LIVING TO REDUCE CHRONIC DISEASE AND FOOD INSECURITY IN THE TRI-COUNTY AREA.HIGHLIGHTS FOR STEPS THAT WILL BE TAKEN AS A PART OF THE 2020-2022 ADVOCATE EUREKA CHNA IMPLEMENTATION STRATEGY TO ADDRESS HEALTHY EATING/ACTIVE LIVING ARE LISTED BELOW: OFFER SEMI-ANNUAL COOKING CLASSES AT ADVOCATE EUREKA PARTICIPATE IN AND PROMOTE COLLABORATIVE TRI-COUNTY COMMUNITY EXERCISE INCENTIVE PROGRAMS, SUCH AS THE TRI-COUNTY TREK EXPLORE PLANTING A COMMUNITY GARDEN AT ADVOCATE EUREKA EXPLORE COORDINATING HEALTHY FOOD DRIVES AT ADVOCATE EUREKA FOR DISTRIBUTION AT LOCAL FOOD BANKS SUPPORT THE TRI-COUNTY ENDING THE HUNGER INITIATIVEIN ADDITION TO THE ABOVE INTERVENTIONS OR STEPS, ADVOCATE EUREKA WILL HAVE A MINIMUM OF ONE STAFF MEMBER SERVE ON THE PARTNERSHIP FOR A HEALTHY COMMUNITY HEALTHY EATING/ACTIVE LIVING PRIORITY ACTION TEAM FOR THE 2020-2022 IMPLEMENTATION PERIOD. THE HOSPITAL'S COMMUNITY HEALTH DIRECTOR ALSO SERVES ON THE PARTNERSHIP FOR A HEALTHY COMMUNITY BOARD WHICH OVERSEES THE PRIORITY ACTION TEAMS. THE HOSPITAL EMPLOYS NURSES IN MOST OF THE PUBLIC SCHOOLS IN WOODFORD COUNTY WHO CAN REINFORCE HEALTHIER EATING HABITS AND INCREASED EXERCISE AMONG STUDENTS AS WELL.HEALTH NEEDS NOT SELECTED CANCER. THE HOSPITAL CHNA TEAM DID NOT SELECT CANCER AS A SIGNIFICANT HEALTH NEED AND ELECTED TO FOCUS ON JUST TWO SIGNIFICANT HEALTH NEEDS INSTEAD, GIVEN ITS RESOURCES ARE LIMITED AS A CRITICAL ACCESS HOSPITAL. THE HOSPITAL WILL, HOWEVER, CONTINUE TO SUPPORT THE EFFORTS OF THE PFCH CANCER PRIORITY ACTION TEAM FOR THE TRI-COUNTY REGION.

GHPC RECRUITED AND CONDUCTED TWO FOCUS GROUPS AMONG RESIDENTS LIVING IN THE COMMUNITY SERVED BY WELLSTAR COBB, WELLSTAR DOUGLAS, WELLSTAR KENNESTONE, WELLSTAR PAULDING, AND WELLSTAR WINDY HILL HOSPITALS. GHPC DESIGNED FACILITATION GUIDES FOR FOCUS GROUP DISCUSSIONS. RESIDENTS WERE RECRUITED USING A THIRD-PARTY RECRUITING FIRM. RECRUITMENT STRATEGIES FOCUSED ON RESIDENTS THAT HAD CHARACTERISTICS REPRESENTATIVE OF THE BROADER COMMUNITY, SPECIFICALLY AREAS THAT EXPERIENCE DISPARITIES AND LOW SOCIOECONOMIC STATUS. FOCUS GROUPS LASTED APPROXIMATELY 1.5 HOURS, DURING WHICH TIME TRAINED FACILITATORS LED SIX TO 12 PARTICIPANTS THROUGH A DISCUSSION ABOUT THE HEALTH OF THEIR COMMUNITY, HEALTH NEEDS, RESOURCES AVAILABLE TO MEET HEALTH NEEDS, AND RECOMMENDATIONS TO ADDRESS COMMUNITY HEALTH NEEDS. ALL PARTICIPANTS WERE OFFERED APPROPRIATE COMPENSATION ($50) FOR THEIR TIME AND A LIGHT MEAL.

LEADERS OF GEORGIA STATE UNIVERSITYS GEORGIA HEALTH POLICY CENTER HELPED GUIDE THE WELLSTAR HEALTH SYSTEM THROUGH THE PRIORITIZATION PROCESS AT THE HEALTH SUMMIT. FROM THE SIGNIFICANT HEALTH NEEDS IDENTIFIED BY CHNA RESEARCH CONDUCTED, THE FOLLOWING HEALTH NEEDS WERE VALUATED AS PRIORITY FOR THE COMMUNITY WELLSTAR COBB, WELLSTAR DOUGLAS, WELLSTAR KENNESTONE, WELLSTAR PAULDING, AND WELLSTAR WINDY HILL HOSPITALS SERVE: 1. ACCESS TO APPROPRIATE CARE 2. CHRONIC DISEASE 3. BEHAVIORAL HEALTH 4. SUBSTANCE ABUSE 5. MATERNAL AND CHILD HEALTH IMPLEMENTATION STRATEGIES FOR EACH NEED WERE RECOMMENDED DURING GROUP EXERCISES. THE STRATEGIES WERE LATER REVIEWED BY THE WELLSTAR POPULATION HEALTH AND COMMUNITY EDUCATION AND OUTREACH TEAM AND VETTED BY THE WELLSTAR BOARD OF TRUSTEES COMMUNITY ADVOCACY AND ENGAGEMENT COMMITTEE AND THE WCHC TASK FORCE, THE CONDUITS FOR SYSTEMWIDE DELIVERY OF COMMUNITY HEALTH IMPROVEMENT SERVICES AND EDUCATION. ACTION AREAS FOR IMPLEMENTATION TO IMPROVE COMMUNITY HEALTH ARE INFLUENCED BY THE FULL SPECTRUM OF THE PUBLIC HEALTH SYSTEM, IN WHICH WELLSTAR COBB, WELLSTAR DOUGLAS, WELLSTAR KENNESTONE, WELLSTAR PAULDING, AND WELLSTAR WINDY HILL HOSPITALS PLAY A VITAL ROLE. WELLSTAR COBB, WELLSTAR DOUGLAS, WELLSTAR KENNESTONE, WELLSTAR PAULDING, AND WELLSTAR WINDY HILL HOSPITALS ARE DEDICATED TO IMPROVING THE HEALTH OF THE COMMUNITY WE SERVE. WITH THE UNIQUE NEEDS IDENTIFIED BY OUR COMMUNITY PARTNERS, WELLSTAR CREATED THE CENTER FOR HEALTH EQUITY IN 2019. THE WELLSTAR CENTER FOR HEALTH EQUITY: THE PURPOSE OF THE WELLSTAR CENTER FOR HEALTH EQUITY IS TO ACCELERATE OUR STRATEGIC EFFORTS TO ADDRESS THE PRIORITY HEALTH NEEDS OF THE COMMUNITIES WE SERVE. WE WILL IMPLEMENT OUR STRATEGY THROUGH COMMUNITY ENGAGEMENT, PARTNERSHIP, INTERNAL TRANSFORMATION, CAPACITY BUILDING, HEALTH POLICY AND SYSTEM ADVOCACY. THERE ARE SIX STRATEGIC DOMAINS FOR THE CENTER FOR HEALTH EQUITY: 1. ACCESS TO CARE 2. WOMENS HEALTH 3. SUBSTANCE ABUSE 4. SUICIDE 5. FOOD INSECURITY 6. CANCER WELLSTAR CENTER FOR HEALTH EQUITY COMMITTEE: WELLSTAR CENTER FOR HEALTH EQUITY COMMITTEE (WCHEC) IS A CROSS-FUNCTIONAL COMMITTEE THAT REPRESENTS MULTIPLE FACETS OF WELLSTAR HEALTH SYSTEM. - IN RESPONSE TO CHNA FINDINGS AND THE DIVERSITY OF WELLSTAR COMMUNITIES, WCHEC WAS EXPANDED TO INCREASE WELLSTARS CAPACITY TO SUPPORT THE CENTER FOR HEALTH EQUITYS STRATEGIES. - BY ENGAGING A MORE DIVERSE SELECTION OF WELLSTAR LEADERSHIP AND SUBJECT MATTER EXPERTS, THE CENTERS PRIORITIES AND INITIATIVES CAN BEST REFLECT THE CAPACITY OF THE ORGANIZATION TO IMPACT AND MEET THE COMMUNITYS NEEDS. - THIS EXPANSION ALSO HELPS THE CENTER INCREASE COORDINATION OF EFFORTS, LEVERAGE PARTNERSHIPS AND MAXIMIZE EFFICIENCY AND STRATEGIC ALIGNMENT, WITHIN AND ACROSS WELLSTAR HEALTH SYSTEM. - THIS IS DONE BY WCHEC MEMBERS GUIDING AND INFORMING THE STRATEGIC PLANNING AND IMPLEMENTATION PROCESS FOR GREATER INSTITUTIONAL ALIGNMENT AND IMPACT. THE CENTER FOR HEALTH EQUITYS IMPLEMENTATION STRATEGY FOCUSES ON SIX STRATEGIC DOMAINS: 1. FOOD INSECURITY - CONTEXT: FOOD INSECURITY IS AN IMPORTANT BUT OFTEN OVERLOOKED FACTOR AFFECTING THE HEALTH OF A SIGNIFICANT SEGMENT OF GEORGIA RESIDENTS. 16.2% OF THE PEOPLE LIVING IN GEORGIA ARE FOOD INSECURE AND 23.2% OF GEORGIA CHILDREN LIVE IN FOOD INSECURE HOUSEHOLDS. THIS IS ONE IN EVERY FOUR GEORGIA CHILDREN. - EXAMPLE WELLSTAR INTERVENTIONS: - WELLSTAR DAY OF SERVICE: CREATES VOLUNTEER OPPORTUNITIES FOR WELLSTAR EMPLOYEES TO SUPPORT GEORGIAS FOOD SUPPORT SYSTEM FOR VULNERABLE AND UNDERSERVED POPULATIONS. - FOOD AS MEDICINE PROGRAM: INTEGRATES HEALTH AND NUTRITION EDUCATION INTO THE COMMUNITY SETTING, WHILE ALSO PROVIDING ACCESS TO HEALTHY FOODS AND MEDICALLY TAILORED COOKING CLASSES. - FOOD INSECURITY SCREENING: IMPLEMENTING THE PROCESS TO SCREEN PATIENTS FOR FOOD INSECURITY AND CONNECTING PATIENTS TO AVAILABLE RESOURCES AND INTERVENTIONS. 2.

THESE PARTNERS INCLUDE WELLSTAR WOMENS HEALTH SERVICE NETWORK, GEORGIA DEPARTMENT OF PUBLIC HEALTH, GEORGIA DEPARTMENT OF HUMAN SERVICES AND SUPREME COURT OF GEORGIA. - OPIOID TASKFORCE: THREE PHYSICIAN-LED WORK GROUPS COMMITTED TO PREVENTION, TREATMENT AND RECOVERY, TARGET VARIOUS POPULATIONS INTERNALLY (TEAM-BASED) AND EXTERNALLY (COMMUNITY-BASED): (1) PROVIDER AND PATIENT EDUCATION, (2) CLINICAL INITIATIVES AND (3) COMMUNITY AWARENESS AND ENGAGEMENT. 3. WOMENS HEALTH - CONTEXT: THE PREGNANCY-RELATED MATERNAL MORTALITY RATIO IN GEORGIA WAS 40.8 PER 100,000 LIVE BIRTHS. THE MATERNAL DEATH RATE FOR BLACK WOMEN IN GEORGIA IS TWICE THAT FOR WHITE WOMEN IN GEORGIA AND 6 TIMES THE RATE FOR WHITE WOMEN, NATIONALLY. - EXAMPLE WELLSTAR INTERVENTIONS: - CLINICAL PRACTICE STANDARDS: SYSTEM-LEVEL COUNCILS MONITOR CLINICAL PRACTICES THROUGHOUT WELLSTAR HEALTH SYSTEM AND IMPLEMENT CARE MODELS WITH EVIDENCE-BASED POLICIES, PROCEDURES, PROTOCOLS AND PATHWAYS, WHILE LOCAL INTERDISCIPLINARY COUNCILS MONITOR WOMENS HEALTH PRACTICES ON-SITE IN INDIVIDUAL WELLSTAR HOSPITALS. - WOMEN AND CHILDREN RESOURCE CENTER: OFFERS PERINATAL EDUCATION AND SUPPORT SERVICES THROUGH THE WOMEN AND CHILDREN RESOURCE CENTER TO REACH MORE THAN 15,000 FAMILIES ANNUALLY. - GME COMMUNITY CLINIC & BABIES BORN HEALTHY (BBH): PROVIDES PRENATAL SERVICES AT A REDUCED RATE FOR VULNERABLE AND UNDERSERVED WOMEN.

In an effort to create a greater impact on the community and address the greatest needs, Roper St. Francis Healthcare participated in and produced a joint Community Health Needs Assessment (CHNA) in collaboration with the Medical University of South Carolina and the Trident United Way. Data for the CHNA was collected from January - February 2019. To gather community input the Community Health Needs Assessment team disseminated a community survey with the purpose of identifying a general overview of the most concerning health topics. The surveys had 5,128 responses which greatly surpassed the number of responses from the previous CHNA of 905 survey responses. This level of engagement is an immediate benefit of collaborating with community partners. Furthermore, the team hosted 19 Interviews with community leaders, elected officials and health care professionals, held 12 focus groups with 57 participants from the community at large, and had 100 participants at the team's community input session. During the 2019 CHNA planning process, specific community groups and organizations, including area schools, churches, and clinics, were included to to engage more members from African American, Latino, low socioeconomic and rural communities. Using feedback from the surveys, interviews, focus groups and the community input session a summary of community feedback was created.

The Roper St. Francis Healthcare (RSFH) Community Needs Assessment Team developed implementation strategies for each health issue identified as a strategic priority. This implementation plan was rolled out over 3 years. Some strategies may be addressed by more than one RSFH hospital or the system as a whole. The team developed a monitoring method at the conclusion of the implementation planning process to provide status updates to community partners, stakeholders, and the community-at-large. The following are the 2019 strategies and outcomes on the 5 issues identified as priorities in the 2016 Community Health Needs Assessment. Access to Care 2019 Strategies and Outcomes: Strategy (System-wide): Navigate high users of emergency departments to primary care medical homes, and to refer underinsured and uninsured patients to AccessHealth and/or the Transitions Clinic * During 2019, the four local hospital systems actively participated in AccessHealth Tri-County Network in order to collaborate with local healthcare systems to identify Emergency Department (ED) ""super utilizers"". * RSFH took steps to navigate uninsured ED ""super utilizers"" to AccessHealth and/or the Transitions Clinic. During 2019, AccessHealth had 3,411 patients, including 1,042 new patients, and Transitions Clinic had 1,321 patients, including 406 new patients. The resulting new patients reduced the number of ED visits by 61%. * RSFH developed a team-based program to create a comprehensive, patient-centered care plan for ED ""super utilizers,"" engaging both RSFH and community resources. During 2019, Bon Secours St. Francis Xavier enrolled 45 patients in the program, and Roper Hospital enrolled 25 patients in the program.

In order to obtain input from the community, three initiatives were advanced: a Community Health Needs Assessment Steering Committee was convened, a community engagement survey was conducted, and several community conversations were held. The purpose of the CHNA Steering Committee is to support the CHNA process by engaging community members and providing feedback on the findings. All organizations involved with the CHNA Steering Committee have special knowledge of public health and underserved populations in the service area. Organizations involved in the Steering Committee are identified as having either a) conducted a previous Community Health Needs Assessment/Community Health Assessment due to IRS or accreditation requirements or b) already engaged in regional population health assessment. From January 2018 to April 2019 Steering Committee members served as key informants representing medically underserved, low- income or minority populations. The committee met bi-monthly to identify regional indicators and to inform the community engagement strategy for the creation of this document. Additionally, a survey to assess community health needs was conducted as part of the CHNA process during a six-week period between January and February 2019. One thousand one hundred (1100) individuals responded listing their top five health concerns. Seven Community Conversations occurred in March of 2019 as part of the CHNA process in which 60 individuals participated from all of the core jurisdictions. The purpose of the conversation was to elicit feedback from community members about publically available health data describing health conditions in the service areas and to review the survey results to further explore the findings. The top 10 health issues as identified from the survey results were presented to the attendees and they were asked to 1) rank the health issues according to which issues impacted them and the people close to them the most and 2) from a community perspective, rank the issues that should be addressed to improve the overall health of the region.

THE HEALTH PRIORITIES IDENTIFIED IN THE MOST RECENT CHNA WERE: 1. PREVENT AND MANAGE CHRONIC DISEASE -- ASTHMA, DIABETES AND HEART DISEASE. 2. INCREASE ACCESS TO MATERNAL SERVICES -- PRENATAL CARE. 3. PROMOTE CANCER AWARENESS -- BREAST CANCER AND PROSTATE CANCER. BEGINNING IN 2020, INGALLS WILL ADDRESS THE NEEDS IDENTIFIED IN ITS MOST RECENTLY CONDUCTED CHNA THROUGH EXECUTION OF THE IMPLEMENTATION STRATEGY. IN ADDITION, INGALLS WAS FULLY ENGAGED IN THE ALLIANCE FOR HEALTH EQUITY, A MEMBERSHIP COLLABORATION OF 35 HOSPITALS AND TWO HEALTH DEPARTMENTS AND REGIONAL COMMUNITY-BASED ORGANIZATIONS TO IMPROVE HEALTH EQUITY, WELLNESS, AND QUALITY OF LIFE ACROSS CHICAGO AND COOK COUNTY. MANY OF INGALLS ACTIONS TO ADDRESS THESE NEEDS ARE INCLUDED IN PROGRAMS THAT ARE NOT LIMITED TO THESE NEEDS. BEGINNING IN 2020, THE SELECTED PRIORITY AREAS (SIGNIFICANT NEEDS) WILL BE ADDRESSED THROUGH THE FOLLOWING APPROACHES: CARE DELIVERY INITIATIVES. A MYRIAD OF INITIATIVES THAT PROVIDE DIRECT HEALTH, MEDICAL, OR WELLNESS SERVICES TO COMMUNITY MEMBERS. THESE SERVICES ARE EXECUTED IN MULTIPLE WAYS THAT INCLUDE LEVERAGING INGALLS RESOURCES AND PARTNERING WITH COMMUNITY HEALTH CENTERS AND COMMUNITY-BASED CLINICAL SERVICES. COMMUNITY BENEFIT GRANTS.

HCDI IS A CONSORTIUM OF ORGANIZATIONS JOINED TOGETHER TO PRIORITIZE AND ADDRESS SIGNIFICANT COMMUNITY HEALTH ISSUES. SAMARITAN HOSPITAL HAS BEEN A MEMBER OF HCDI SINCE 1997. THE CHNA BENEFITED FROM THE REVIEW AND INPUT OF THE MEMBERS OF THE PREVENTION AGENDA WORKGROUP OF THE HCDI. BEGINNING IN JANUARY 2019, THESE INDIVIDUALS ARE SUBJECT MATTER EXPERTS FROM THE COUNTY PUBLIC HEALTH DEPARTMENTS OF ALBANY, RENSSELAER, AND SCHENECTADY; AND OF EACH OF THE CAPITAL REGION HOSPITALS: ST. PETER'S HOSPITAL, ALBANY MEDICAL CENTER, ALBANY MEMORIAL HOSPITAL, SUNNYVIEW HOSPITAL AND REHABILITATION CENTER, SAMARITAN HOSPITAL, AND ELLIS HOSPITAL. DURING FEBRUARY AND MARCH, THIS GROUP WAS JOINED BY REPRESENTATIVES FROM COMMUNITY-BASED ORGANIZATIONS, BUSINESSES, CONSUMERS, SCHOOLS, ACADEMICS, AND THOSE WHO HAVE CONTACT WITH AND CARE FOR PEOPLE WITH CERTAIN CHRONIC DISEASES, SUCH AS DIABETES, ASTHMA, COPD, AND CANCER. A TOTAL OF 28 DIFFERENT ORGANIZATIONS IN OUR CAPITAL REGION PARTICIPATED, SUCH AS CATHOLIC CHARITIES, WHITNEY M. YOUNG, JR. FEDERALLY QUALIFIED HEALTH CENTER (FQHC), CAPITAL DISTRICT PHYSICIANS HEALTH PLAN, FIDELIS CARE HEALTH PLAN, UPPER HUDSON PLANNED PARENTHOOD, HUDSON VALLEY COMMUNITY COLLEGE, CAPITAL ROOTS, FOOD PANTRIES FOR THE CAPITAL DISTRICT, PROMESA/CAMINO NUEVO AND SENIOR HOUSING ORGANIZATIONS. ALMOST ALL OF THESE ORGANIZATIONS SERVE MEDICALLY UNDERSERVED, LOW-INCOME OR MINORITY POPULATIONS, AND MANY OFFER SPECIFIC PROGRAMS TARGETED TOWARDS THESE GROUPS. REPRESENTATIVES OF THE HCDI DETERMINED THE PROCESS FOR COMPLETING THE NEEDS ASSESSMENT AND REVIEWED THE COLLECTED DATA. THE CHNA IS THE RESULT OF OVER A YEAR OF MEETINGS WITH MEMBER ORGANIZATIONS AND COMMUNITY INPUT. IN ADDITION TO THE HEALTH DATA, THE 2018 COMMUNITY HEALTH SURVEY WAS CONDUCTED IN DECEMBER 2018 BY THE SIENA RESEARCH INSTITUTE. THE SURVEY WAS A REPRESENTATIVE SAMPLE OF ADULT (18+ YEARS) RESIDENTS OF THE CAPITAL REGION. THE SURVEY INCLUDED 1,204 (MOE +/- 3.4%) TOTAL INTERVIEWS WHICH WERE MADE UP OF A PHONE SAMPLE, OVERSAMPLE OF LOW INCOME RESIDENTS AND A SMALL ONLINE SAMPLE. THIS CONSUMER SURVEY WAS CONDUCTED TO LEARN ABOUT THE HEALTH NEEDS, BARRIERS AND CONCERNS OF THE RESIDENTS OF THE CAPITAL REGION. FROM APRIL TO MAY 2019, DRAFTS OF THE SECTIONS WERE SENT TO LOCAL SUBJECT MATTER EXPERTS FOR REVIEW IN THE HEALTH DEPARTMENTS OF ALBANY, RENSSELAER, AND SCHENECTADY COUNTIES AND IN ST. PETER'S HEALTH PARTNERS (ALBANY MEMORIAL HOSPITAL, ST. PETER'S HOSPITAL, SAMARITAN HOSPITAL AND SUNNYVIEW REHABILITATION HOSPITAL), ALBANY MEDICAL CENTER, ELLIS HOSPITAL, BURDETT BIRTH CENTER AND COMMUNITY BASED ORGANIZATIONS.

202043149349300204,550526150,"Facility Reporting Group - A Part V, Section B, line 5:","Household Telephone Survey: The household surveys were conducted using appropriate quality controls which included involving research experts in the design of the survey instrument, thorough and consistent training of interviewers, and the use of reputable survey-analysis software. The principal investigator provided oversight to the surveying process including data collection and entry. Data was collected and entered using a web-based survey. This report was compiled and verified for accuracy by members of the Kanawha Coalition for Community Health Improvement. This survey sample size results in a statistically significant 95% confidence interval with an error margin of plus or minus 5.73%. Not all respondents answered every question; therefore the margin of error was adjusted and reported for each question, based on the number of respondents. Numbers too small to be statistically significant were noted as such. An independent sampling firm randomly selected landline telephone numbers for Kanawha County households. The random landline sample consisted of 8,600 numbers which was screened for disconnects and businesses, resulting in a list of 4,568 numbers. A total of 26 nursing students received training and administered the phone survey. After learning that the number of American homes with only wireless telephones continues to grow and 47.4% of American homes had only wireless telephones (January - June 2015 National Center for Health Statistics Survey), the Kanawha Coalition attempted to increase the number of responses among younger residents and lower income residents, by doubling the acquired address based sample of households with only wireless phones. The wireless sample of 5,600 households received postcards in the mail directing them to the online survey or to call the Kanawha Coalition to arrange a convenient time to take the survey by telephone. The Kanawha Coalition process works to ensure that the survey sample size is valid, and that the sample is randomly selected. It also ensured that the fourth-year nursing students with the University of Charleston's School of Nursing were adequately trained in how to administer the phone survey. As with any telephone survey, there are certain limitations. The result of the survey depends on the accuracy of the responses given by the persons interviewed. Self-reported behavior must be interpreted with caution. To assure proper sampling distribution, the demographics of the survey respondents were compared to county demographics based on 2010-2015 U.S. Census Quickfacts data. This comparison reveals an over-representation of respondents who were female, over 55 years of age, widowed, had no children in the home and were Caucasian. There was an under-representation of African Americans, people with lower-educational attainment (high school or less), those with children in the home, and those who had never been married. Focus Groups:To understand community needs, focus groups were held throughout Kanawha County in November 2016. As one component of the Coalition's five-part assessment, focus groups offer insight into the needs, concerns and experiences of people whose voice is not often heard. Typically, focus groups are comprised of a small group of individuals, usually a vulnerable or target population. In this case focus groups were organized in communities located in different geographical locations in the county. It is important to note that the results reflect the perceptions of some community members, but may not necessarily represent all community members in Kanawha County. A series of six focus groups were convened. Participants received gift cards for their completion of the focus group. The purpose of the discussion was to obtain input on issues that could impact the health of the residents of their communities. A total of 51 community members participated in focus groups in the following communities: Cross Lanes, Elkview, Kanawha City, Marmet, Miami and London. The Kanawha Coalition provided training to fourth year University of Charleston-School of Health Science's nursing students with the University of Charleston-School of Health Sciences to enable them to facilitate the groups. The students also compiled the results and prepared reports of the findings for the Kanawha Coalition.Steering Committee: Steering Committee Members are from the CAMC, Thomas Health System,Highland Hospital, Charleston Area Alliance, Kanawha County Schools, WV Bureau for Public Health, Partnership of African American Churches and the Kanawha Coalition for Community Health Improvement and they serve in an advisory capacity for the Coalition. The Steering Committee follows a set of Guiding Principles as it promotes and safeguards the integrity of the collaborative process as each assumes the role of an equal partner in the process. They make tangible commitments of resources to the Coalition and believe that the process is the product and serves as the vehicle to put people together to explore and address challenges and opportunities to improve the health of the people of Kanawha County. The Steering Committee is committed to including all members of the community in the community health needs assessment process as it cultivates a community-wide sense of ownership, not organizational ownership. It provides encouragement and support to keep Coalition volunteers engaged and motivated while remaining flexible in its approach to meeting community needs. It believes in continuous quality improvement and supports an ongoing process to evaluate and improve outcomes and it celebrates successes along the way.Members of the Kanawha Coalition Steering Committee actively participate in the survey planning process to provide public health insight and ensure data integrity. Additionally, epidemiologists from the West VirginiaDepartment of Health and Human Services work with the Coalition for question design for consistency with other surveys to allow benchmarks and comparisons. In addition, Key Informant Interviews provide in-depthinformation on the community. The Steering Committee also provides contact information for key informants in the community.Key Informant Interviews:The 87 key informants representing 20 different sectors or areas of expertise in the community were given both standardized questions and open ended questions designed to elicit a full range of responses. They were asked to identify the top three populations in Kanawha County with unmet needs and to share their biggest concerns in terms of health risk behaviors, clinical care, social and economic factors and the physical environment. They were also asked to share the challenges and barriers they believed exist and how best to overcome them. Finally, they were asked to identify the top three overall issues in Kanawha County and what they believed to be the top three health related strengths and assets for the community."

One of the community need issues identified is Drugs (all types illicit and prescription, does not include alcohol). We addressed this community need issue through the CAMC Ryan White Program. In 2019, there were 375 participants and we provided $61,929 in unreimbursed care. We also addressed this issue with the Drug Addicted Mother Baby Program. In 2019, 627 mothers were identified and participated in the program at CAMC Women and Children's Hospital.2.) Another community need issue identified is Diabetes. We addressed this Community need issue with our Outpatient Diabetes Education Program and Information available through our Health Information Center. We also provided community screenings via our annual Teddy Bear health fair.3.) Obesity was addressed via our continued provision of Play Patch, a 940 square feet children's play area that includes fruit and vegetable themed play equipment Along with a family restroom at the local shopping mall. 4.) Heart Disease/Hypertension/Heart Attack/Stroke was addressed via community education provided via the CAMC Mall Walkers, Wear Red Day, Women Heart Support Group and Physician Guest Lecture Programs. Health Screenings for heart disease were also provided at Healthfest. In all, over 2000 residents of the community were impacted by CAMC's outreach efforts.5.) Limited Access to Healthy Foods is addressed through our Local Wealth Creation ""Value Chain"" program and our continued efforts to work with The Greater Kanawha Foundation to create and sustain a wealth creation value chain. This approach bridges conventional approaches to community and economic development by using a systems framework, working with wealth creation value chains. CAMC's 5 county primary service area is comprised 356,000 people with a small increases in the size of the working population since 1990. 18% of people and 25% of children live in poverty with little improvement over the past 10 years. The health connection is that improvements in health care are associated with higher productivity in the workforce and for the economy overall. The value chain premises are that we need to be intentionally inclusive of local people and places as economic contributors to have a positive impact on wealth in our communities. This program's focus is on working with local growers to develop their capability to sell their produce to CAMC at a guaranteed quantity and price and once the process is established to roll it out to other ""buyers"". In 2019, we continued to work with individuals in the community and local farmers to coordinate the number of growers providing fresh produce purchased by CAMC and to maintain and expand GAP certification.6.) Tobacco Use was addressed through ""Tobacco Free for Baby and Me"", the Tobacco Free Day at the West Virginia Legislature, the ALA Bike Trek and Great Smoke Out. The Tobacco Free for Baby and Me program identified 200 women who were tobacco users through the CAMC Women's Medicine Center in 2019.7.) Lack of Access to Mental Health and Addiction Services was addressed through the Outpatient Mental Health Program offered through the CAMC Family Resource Center. The program is for low income residents and served over 100 individuals in 2019.8.) Cancer was addressed through Breast Cancer Awareness Activities, Community Cancer Screenings, and our Healthy Steps Program, Look Good/Feel Better Program, Breast Cancer Survivorship Group, Lung Bridge Program and participation in various community events such as Relay for Life and Run for your Life. We also participated in the Project Echo cancer survivorship program."

We sought to include more stakeholders in our process of developing the CHNA this time around by engaging old and new partners. We began by gathering input from community members as well as from Rush faculty, students and staff (especially those who live in our service area). We sought perspectives from our colleagues at health systems and public health entities in the area; community leaders and members; and our colleagues participating in the Alliance for Health Equity. The Alliance for Health Equity is a collaborative group convened by the Illinois Public Health Institute and consisted at the time of over 30 hospitals, area health departments, and more than 100 community-based organizations working together on a joint CHNA process. As we developed our recommended actions for this iteration of the CHNA, we again sought input from our key stakeholders.

We have brought the CHNA to meetings with community based organizations across the west side of Chicago since its adoption as well as to partners in the near west suburbs, as we view this as a public good for our respective communities. We also ensured that we brought our CHNA, Community Health Implementation Plan (CHIP), and Community Benefit Report to our ambulatory sites and waiting rooms across the Rush enterprise to ensure more people can see/access it. Rush has also presented on the CHNA at many national meetings and conferences, as Rush views the document as a prime example of our commitment to connecting academic and community impact.

202001979349303330,362174823,Rush University Medical Center,"Part V, Section B, Line 11: Rush's Community Health Implementation Plan (CHIP) was adopted in June 2019 simultaneously with the CHNA. This combined approach was an improvement for the new round of CHNA/CHIP, as Rush leadership believed that if we identify needs we must simultaneously come up with an approach to address them. The following Community Health Needs were identified in partnership with the Alliance for Health Equity, and the improvements with guidance and focus to connect with local initiatives as Rush believes it must partner with others to move the needle to improve health such as the Alliance, West Side United, Senator Durbin's HEALE initiative, and West Side ConnectED. Given that our CHNA/CHIP were formally adopted in June 2019, the following efforts tied to the final year of our 2016-2019 CHNA/CHIP, but there is great overlap as we are doubling down on our new goals. The needs identified for 2019 remained the same with the addition of maternal child health, as a fifth need.Please note that we only highlight selected information in the following section. For more detailed information, please find published documents and supporting programs on our website, https://www.rush.edu/about-us/rush-community.Goal 1: Reduce inequities caused by the social, economic and structural determinants of health a. Rush has been working to improve educational attainment through long standing programs such as our partnership with Malcolm X College, Richard T. Crane Medical Preparatory High School, and the K-12 program- REACH, the Rush Education and Career Hub. This builds on years of partnership, but focuses our efforts in communities we identified with the most need. In FY19, REACH programs served more than 2,500 students, 500 parents and more than 350 teachers.b. Identify, measure and mitigate the social determinants of health among those at risk - particularly children, young adults and people with chronic illness.During the fiscal year, Rush implemented a screening tool to identify non-medical barriers to good health, such as food insecurity, homelessness, lack of utilities, transportation barriers, and lack of primary care/insurance. This screening tool was implemented in the Rush University Medical Center Emergency Department, primary care settings, and community based settings. Patients screened for these social determinants of health (SDOH) were connected to services via a partnership with NowPow, a locally-based, resource directory company which provides curated, personalized resources that are shared with patients. Future plans include the integration of the SDOH screening tool with a screen designed to detect Adverse Childhood Experiences (ACE) - traumatic events which are strongly related to the development and prevalence of a wide range of health problems throughout a person's lifespan. Further, we intend to expand the SDOH screening tool system-wide and connect it with Medicare Health Risk Assessments (HRAs) as well as develop opportunities to study and publish on the impact of screening on patients' overall health outcomes.Rush joined the Alliance for Health Equity (AHE) early on and is a member of the steering committee. In addition, a Rush representative chairs several work-groups, including the Food Security and Social Determinants workgroups. Rush is particularly invested in helping guide AHE to focus on our identified needs and improvements. Rush also has a leadership role data, policy, and trauma informed care work groups. Goal 2: Improve access to mental and behavioral health services a. Address psychological trauma through screening tools and referral programs in school-based health centers and faith-based organizationsRush is working to address the mental and behavioral health needs of our patients and communities by having social work services offered to our primary care, inpatient, and emergency department patients. In addition, the College of Nursing and Rush Community Based Practices offer mental health services in the community at Simpson Academy for Young Women and the College of Nursing Faculty Practice sites.School Based Students seen in the SBHCs are receiving age-appropriate risk screening and evaluation for mental health issues. Those identified with mental health issues are referred for in-SBHC or community-based counseling and psychiatric services. In FY19, 876 risk screenings were completed, resulting in 175 referrals for additional mental health services. Of those 175, 100 were successfully linked to care. Among the 100 are three pregnant teens who have been referred to home visiting services through the ACEs in Pregnancy program. Through a partnership with the Rush Department of Psychiatry, psychiatric services, provided both in-SBHC and by telehealth visits, launched in January 2018. During FY19, there were 49 students referred for SBHC provided psychiatric care. One thousand seven hundred forty minutes of education that focused on trauma, mental health, and skill building for resilience was provided to 900 students through school outreach activities. Finally, 140 teachers, parents, staff, and community members' participated educational sessions on the same topics.Faith Based A total of 233 congregants and community members were trained in Mental Health First Aid, which teaches lay people how to identify, understand, and respond to signs of addictions and mental illnesses. b. Expand access to other screenings and servicesThrough a partnership with the Rush Department of Psychiatry launched in January of 2018, Rush provided psychiatric services, in-SBHCs and by telehealth visits. Nearly two thousand hours of education that focused on trauma, mental health, identification of mental health issues, and skill building for resilience was provided to 825 students through school outreach activities.Goal 3: Prevent and reduce chronic disease by focusing on risk factors a. Reduce risk factors through assessments, disease management programs and improved access to healthy food. The Rush Surplus Project continued to take place at both Rush University Medical Center and Rush Oak Park Hospital in FY19. Through a continued partnership with Franciscan Outreach and Oak Park River Forest Food Pantry (recently renamed Beyond Hunger), in FY19, Rush has provided 26,488 free meals to both Franciscan and Beyond Hunger. Additionally, Rush continues to collaborate with another community partner, Top Box foods to provide local produce to its employees and community members for a discounted rate monthly. In FY19, 529 unique Rush employees participated in this program. Finally, Rush recently implemented their Food is Medicine Program on 4 inpatient units and is actively rolling it out to the remainder of the inpatient care units and ROPH. This program provides food from the hospital-based pantry to the patients who have screened positive for food insecurity prior to their discharge at Rush University Medical Center. These individuals are also provided with referrals to local pantries for them to continue to receive food after discharge and pursue SNAP. Through July 2019, there have been 270 bags of food delivered to patients who have screened positive for food insecurity.ROPH's community wellness program screens and connects individuals to resources at Oak Park River Forest Food Pantry, a nursing led screening program. It provides free educational seminars and fitness classes, which are designed to help community members lead healthier lives and address chronic disease. Healthy Motivations provided education on topics such as heart and vascular disease, preventive health, depression and more. In FY19, the program provided services to over 2,268 women and families. The Metropolitan Chicago Breast Cancer Task Force launched in 2007 as an independent nonprofit based at Rush, with the goal of reducing the disparity in breast cancer deaths between black women and white women in Chicago. After these initiatives launched, the disparities began to decrease. In addition, ROPH provides free mammograms to uninsured or underinsured women who live in Oak Park, River Forest and Proviso Township. In FY19, more than 550 women were screened.In the past fiscal year, Rush focused its efforts on the Tobacco Oversight Committee and extending the reach of its community efforts, particularly supporting Oakley Square in their efforts to go smoke-free by offering staff support, training, and our comprehensive web-based tool, Pro-Change. In addition, Rush provides trainings to its respective providers on Courage and Counsel to Quit with partner, Respiratory Health Association. This also included offering quarterly courses to patients and community members to quit smoking at Rush Oak Park Hospital.CONTINUED BELOW"

Based on the findings of its most recently conducted CHNA, Mercy Hospital Washington has chosen to address the following three significant health needs identified in Franklin County: - Access to Care - Navigation to Services and Social Determinants of Health- Behavioral Health - Mental Health and Substance & Opiate Use- Childhood Obesity Food and Nutritional EducationThese needs are being addressed in both the Mercy Hospital St. Louis & Washington's Community Health Improvement Plan (CHIP), which can be accessed here: https://www.mercy.net/forms/community-benefits/. Some notable achievements during the 2019 year include:- 2019 - The Community Health Worker (CHW) program, which was piloted beginning in 2018, was adopted and expanded across Mercy hospitals in 2019. Mercy Hospital St. Louis hired two full-time CHWs, and Mercy Hospital Washington hired one full-time CHW, to connect uninsured and underinsured patients in the Emergency Department to community resources for social needs, address social determinants of health issues, and assist patients with applying for Medicaid, market place insurance, disability or hospital charity care. CHWs also collaborate closely with the Care Management team, social workers and in St. Louis, Community Referral Coordinators, to ensure continuity of care and improve quality of life. - In FY20, Mercy Hospital St. Louis' CHWs assisted 535 patients through 813 unique encounters. 65% of patients were uninsured, and 12% were either on Medicaid or were Medicaid pending. - In FY20, Mercy Hospital Washington's CHW assisted 212 patients through 535 unique encounters. 76% of patients were uninsured, and 16% were either on Medicaid or were Medicaid pending. - 2019 - The Community Referral Coordinator (CRC) program at Mercy Hospital St. Louis works in the department (ED) in order to provide patients without a medical home assistance in finding a primary care or specialty care provider, along with social service support, as appropriate. In 2019, the CRC encountered 1,798 patients. - 68.9% of patients were self-pay/uninsured and 15.8% were Medicaid patients - 78% of patients assisted by the CRC were without a Primary Care Home at the time of outreach, and 91% reported a barrier to Primary Care - 986 appointments were scheduled (53.2% referral rate), and 64.6% of patients kept their appointments, which represents a 5.5% increase in total kept rate over the prior year. - 2019 - Mercy Hospital St. Louis and Mercy Hospital Washington supported several behavioral health programs in partnership with the Behavioral Health Network: - Emergency Room Enhancement Project and the Youth Emergency Room Enhancement Project: focus on enhancing support for adult and youth high utilizers of ER with the primary goal of reducing preventable hospital contacts across the region by fostering engagement through support, intensive outreach and improving outcomes through connection to community - Engaging Patients in the Care Coordination Program (EPICC): provides intensive referral and linkage services by Recovery Coaches, peers with lived experience, to impact those who have overdosed on opioids to establish immediate linkages to substance use and medication assisted treatment services - Mercy Hospital St. Louis also engaged in Hospital Community Linkages (HCL) Project: focuses on enhancing transitions from hospital inpatient psychiatric care settings to community care at the region's safety-net Community Mental Health Centers (CMHCs)- 2019 - Mercy Hospital St. Louis in partnership with Generate Health, Barnes Jewish Hospital and SSM Health System continued their collaborative work on the BUILD Health Challenge Grant which focuses on decreasing Maternal/Child Health and infant mortality rates by addressing disparities and transportation.

The program ended in May of 2019 with 12 out of 16 participants graduating from the course. - 2020 - Recognizing the economic hardship, stress and emotional trauma that the COVID-19 pandemic brought to individuals and families, and understanding that it is often the most vulnerable that are impacted the most in times of crisis, Mercy was proactive in engaging community partners in COVID-19 response from the start of the pandemic. In particular, individuals experiencing homelessness may be at increased risk of infection and complication from the COVID-19 virus. Community Health Leaders across Mercy's hospitals worked with local partner agencies to develop comprehensive plans for safely discharging COVID-19 patients to a designated location if they do not require hospitalization but lack housing. At Mercy Hospital St. Louis, the Community Health Leader collaborated with local social service and homeless serving agencies and healthcare providers in order to successfully enact a plan that aligns local resources with regional protocols. Other community services offered by Mercy Hospital St. Louis during the COVID-19 pandemic include: - Community COVID-19 testing sites- Donated 2500 gloves and mask for PPE supplies, including hand sanitizer for COVID-19 kits distributed to North County and North City residents via PrepareSTL and The Urban League Of Metropolitan St. Louis. - Mercy Hospital Washington engaged in the Jefferson and Franklin County COVID-19 Homeless Response Taskforce to coordinate efforts around supporting the homeless during the pandemic and worked closely with local partners in the Franklin Homeless Taskforce (HTF). Other community services offered by Mercy Hospital St. Louis during the COVID-19 pandemic include:- Community COVID-19 testing sites were developed to provide access for any community member. - Mercy Hospital Washington Social Workers continued establishing ED patients with Primary Care Physicians for follow-up care and educating the patient on possibly more affordable options when needing care.- 2018 - Mercy Hospital Washington opened a free COPD education clinic in Washington for their patients- Mercy Hospital Washington facilitated the Winter Warming Overnight Center to prevent those sleeping outside from freezing to death with the American Inn within Washington. - Mercy Hospital Washington, in partnership with the Multi-County Drug Task Force and Franklin County Sheriff's Office, continued training first responders in several counties so that they could begin carrying and utilizing Narcan to revive overdosed patients while waiting for the ambulance to arrive. The local Mercy hospital stored the Narcan in their pharmacyAdditional needs being addressed by the Mercy Hospital St. Louis and Mercy Hospital Washington include: - Violence: Domestic, Elderly, Child Abuse, and TraffickingMHSL - MHSL and Alternatives to Living in Violent Environments (ALIVE), a St. Louis based domestic violence agency, have implemented Project HOPE, the only program in the St. Louis area that allows domestic violence survivors to file for, and potentially have granted, orders of protection while still in a hospital setting. Information regarding ALIVE's programming and services is distributed throughout MHSL, with Spanish translations provided to better reach patients who speak limited English. MHSL is also actively involved in the Coalition Against Trafficking and Exploitation (CATE), and partners with St. Martha's Hall, a Catholic Charities organization that provides shelter and services to women and children who have survived domestic violence. Mercy will continue its collaboration and involvement with these groups, as well as the awareness and education campaigns it has begun with restroom resource posters, a training video, and the incorporation of a screening question/referral process in Mercy's Electronic Medical Record (EMR). However, it was felt by Mercy's Community Health Council that while continued attention to this issue was important, the issues of access, health equity, and the community's crisis with behavioral health and addiction demanded Mercy's focus at this time.

A robust initiative, Mercy's Healthification program, provides comprehensive health evaluation, screening, education, and incentives to increase healthy behaviors and improve health among Mercy coworkers. Mercy Clinic also offers a variety of programs and services to address chronic conditions and a healthy lifestyle.- Chronic Conditions: Heart Disease, Diabetes, or Asthma and AllergiesA significant concern relating to chronic conditions is the disparity in health outcomes and treatment for Blacks/African-Americans and Whites/Caucasians. MHSL recently signed an American Hospital Association Health Equity pledge and is beginning to implement ""Call to Action"" goals aimed at identifying and, subsequently, addressing areas of health disparity and service gaps. As the leader in St Louis County for newborn deliveries, MHSL has decided to take on the significant issue of health equity by beginning with maternal/child health disparities and addressing some of the region's needs with low birth weight babies. Mercy has also committed to addressing health equity in the Inner North region community of Wellston; Mercy is outlining a collaborative community plan to address overall health equity with these community members.- Cancers and Tobacco UseMHSL & MHW - Community cancer screenings and education continue to be offered regionally. Efforts to address tobacco cessation will continue through Mercy's Certified Health and Wellness Coach/Mercy Road to Freedom program though Mercy's Cardiopulmonary Rehab area. Other identified needs not being addressed and why not, if applicable.The following needs are not being addressed:- Sexually Transmitted InfectionsMHSL & MHW - Infectious disease physicians at Mercy will continue to address this issue through collaborative work. Mercy will not, however, take a lead role on this issue as there are some limitations to the organization's partnerships in this area as a Catholic Health System. - Physical Environment: Air/Water Quality and HousingMHW - In the category of Physical Environment, MHW has chosen Transportation, under the Access to Care priority. Collaboration with local coalitions addressing homelessness and housing will continue as will Mercy's support of industry, government, non-governmental organizations and the public in addressing air and water quality in our area."

SPECIFICALLY FOR THE 2019 CHNA, COMMUNITY INPUT WAS ACQUIRED BY REVIEWING EXISTING COMMUNITY REPORTS AND BY DISCUSSIONS WITH EXISTING COMMUNITY BASED GROUPS ABOUT THE DATA-IDENTIFIED NEEDS. IN 2018, COMMON GROUND HEALTH CONDUCTED A REGIONAL SURVEY OF COMMUNITY MEMBERS TO LEARN MORE ABOUT HEALTH BEHAVIORS AND BARRIERS TO HEALTHY LIVES. WITH PARTICULAR ATTENTION TO GATHERING INPUT FROM A DIVERSE GROUP OF PARTICIPANTS, OVER 4,000 PEOPLE WERE SURVEYED. ALTHOUGH RESULTS WERE NOT FULLY ANALYZED AT THE TIME OF THE CHNA DEVELOPMENT, COMMON GROUND HEALTH SHARED SEVERAL PRELIMINARY RESULTS OF THE SURVEY WITH THE CHIW. THE SURVEY ASKED ABOUT A WIDE RANGE OF TOPICS FROM ACCESS TO MEDICAL AND DENTAL CARE TO PERCEPTIONS OF PERSONAL SAFETY AND SATISFACTION WITH WORK. TO CAPTURE EACH INDIVIDUALS UNIQUE STORY, SEVERAL QUESTIONS WERE OPEN-ENDED WITH AN OPPORTUNITY FOR UNSTRUCTURED FEEDBACK. THE RESULTS OF THE SURVEY INDICATED THAT THE TOP CONCERN FOR ADULTS IN MONROE COUNTY ACROSS ALL RACES, GEOGRAPHIES, AND SOCIOECONOMIC STATUS LEVELS WAS MENTAL HEALTH. BEYOND THE MY HEALTH SURVEY INFORMATION, THE CHIW MET WITH SEVERAL COMMUNITY GROUPS INCLUDING THE AFRICAN AMERICAN HEALTH COALTION, THE LATINO HEALTH COALITION, THE MATERNAL CHILD HEALTH ADVISORY GROUP AND THE COMMUNITY ADVISORY COUNCIL. THIS HIGH LEVEL COLLABORATION AMONG COMMUNITY MEMBERS, PUBLIC HEALTH PROVIDERS AND HOSPITAL SYSTEMS, ALONG WITH THE ROBUST PROCESS OF COMMUNITY INPUT GATHERING, PROVIDES A TRULY COMMUNITY BASED HEALTH NEEDS ASSESSMENT AND IMPROVEMENT PLAN. --------------------"

SIGNIFICANT DATA SOURCES INCLUDED THE YOUTH RISK BEHAVIOR SURVEY, BEHAVIORAL RISK FACTOR SURVEILLANCE SURVEY, NYS PREVENTION AGENDA DASHBOARDS, SPARCS DATA, VITAL RECORDS, AND THE MOST RECENT MY HEALTH STORY SURVEY. SEVERAL AREAS OF CONCERN WERE NOTED ESPECIALLY THOSE AREAS WHERE MONROE COUNTY DID SIGNIFICANTLY WORSE THAN THE STATE PREVENTION AGENDA PRIORITY AREAS GOALS. HIGHLIGHTED AREAS THAT ARE OF PARTICULAR CONCERN FOR MONROE COUNTY INCLUDE: HEALTHY EATING AND FOOD SECURITY, TOBACCO PREVENTION, INJURIES AND VIOLENCE, MATERNAL AND WOMENS HEALTH, PERINATAL AND INFANT HEALTH, CHILD AND ADOLESCENT SOCIAL AND EMOTIONAL DEVELOPMENT, BUILDING RESILIENT AND SUPPORTIVE ENVIRONMENTS, PREVENTING MENTAL AND SUBSTANCE USE DISORDERS, AND SEXUALLY TRANSMITTED INFECTION RATES. SEVERAL SIGNIFICANT NEEDS WERE IDENTIFIED FROM THE DATA, UNFORTUNATELY THERE ARE NOT ENOUGH RESOURCES TO EFFECTIVELY ADDRESS EACH AREA. THE NEEDS WERE THEN PRIORITIZED BASED ON ESTABLISHED CRITERIA THAT INCLUDED: NEED AMONG VULNERABLE POPULATIONS; ABILITY TO HAVE A MEASURABLE IMPACT; ABILITY TO INTERVENE AT THE PREVENTION LEVEL; COMMUNITY CAPACITY AND WILLINGNESS TO ACT; AND IMPORTANCE OF THE PROBLEM TO COMMUNITY MEMBERS. BASED ON THESE CRITERIA, AND SEVERAL MEETINGS OF GROUP DISCUSSION AMONG THE COMMUNITY HEALTH IMPROVEMENT WORKGROUP, AND AFTER MEETING WITH SEVERAL COMMUNITY GROUPS INCLUDING THE AFRICAN AMERICAN HEALTH COALITION AND THE LATINO HEALTH COALITION, TWO PRIMARY FOCUS AREAS WERE IDENTIFIED: MENTAL HEALTH AND MATERNAL/CHILD HEALTH. IN ADDITION, FIVE AREAS OF CONCERN REMAIN IN THE MONROE COUNTY CHNA AS AREAS TO FOLLOW, AND THESE INCLUDE FOOD INSECURITY, TOBACCO USE, VIOLENCE, OPIOID USE AND SEXUALLY TRANSMITTED INFECTIONS. THE HOSPITAL IS ADDRESSING THE SIGNIFICANT NEEDS IDENTIFIED IN THE 2019 CHNA THROUGH MANY INTERVENTIONS DESCRIBED IN THE IMPLEMENTATION STRATEGY. PROGRESS ON THE IMPLEMENTATION STRATEGY IS WIDELY AVAILABLE TO THE PUBLIC AND CAN BE FOUND ON THE SAME WEBSITE AS THE CHNA (https://www.urmc.rochester.edu/community.aspx). TO ADDRESS THE FIRST PRIORITIZED GOAL OF PROMOTING HEALTHY WOMEN, INFANTS AND CHILDREN, THE HOSPITAL JOINS THE CHIW TO REDUCE RACIAL, ETHINIC ECONOMIC AND GEOGRAPHIC DISPARITIES IN MATERNAL AND CHILD HEALTH OUTCOMES, AND PROMOTE HEALTH EQUITY FOR MATERNAL AND CHILD POPULATIONS. SPECIFICALLY, AS SUGGESTED BY THE NYS DEPARTMENT OF HEALTH IN THE PREVENTION AGENDA, THE HOSPITAL AND THE CHIW WILL ENHANCE COLLABORATIONS WITH OTHER PROGRAMS, PROVIDERS, AGENCIES AND COMMUNITY MEMBERS TO ADDRESS KEY SOCIAL DETERMINANTS OF HEALTH THAT IMPACT THE HEALTH OF WOMEN, INFANTS, CHILDREN AND FAMILIES ACROSS THE LIFE COURSE. THE HOSPITAL SUPPORTED THE MATERNAL CHILD HEALTH ADVISORY GROUP (MCH-AG) WHICH FACILITATED SEVERAL COLLABORATIONS BETWEEN THE HOSPITAL AND COMMUNITY AGENCIES. THE GROUP IS WORKING ON HOUSING INSECURITY AMONG YOUNG FAMILIES, ADDRESSING INSTITUTIONAL RACISM ESPECIALLY IN LABOR AND DELIVERY, AND REDUCING UNPLANNED PREGNANCY AND BIRTH SPACING THROUGH LONG ACTING REVERSIBLE CONTRACEPTION AND SOCIAL SUPPORT SYSTEMS THAT ENCOURAGE BIRTH SPACING. TO ADDRESS THE SECOND PRIORITIZED GOAL OF PROMOTING WELL-BEING TO PREVENT MENTAL AND SUBSTANCE USE DISORDERS, THE HOSPITAL JOINS THE CHIW IN STRENGTHENING OPPORTUNITIES TO BUILD WELL-BEING AND RESILIENCE ACROSS THE LIFESPAN. THE HOSPITAL WILL EXPLORE OPPORTUNITIES TO BUILD COMMUNITY WEALTH SUCH AS SUPPORTING WORKER-OWNED COOPERATIVES AND BUSINESSES, USING THE POWER OF HOSPITALS AS ANCHOR INSTITUTIONS. IN ADDITION, THE HOSPITAL WILL FACILITATE SUPPORTIVE ENVIRONMENTS THAT PROMOTE RESPECT/DIGNITY FOR PEOPLE OF ALL AGES BY EXPLORING POLICY AND PROGRAM INTERVENTIONS THAT PROMOTE INCLUSION, INTEGRATION AND COMPETENCE. IN 2019, THE CHIW WORKED TO PROMOTE YOUTH MENTAL HEALTH FIRST AID AND CONNECTED TARGETED AUDIENCES TO THIS TRAINING. IN ADDITION, ELECTRONIC MEDICAL RECORD NOTES AND DISCHARGE SUMMARIES FOR THOSE SUFFERING FROM MENTAL HEALTH AND SUBSTANCE ABUSE ISSUES HAVE BEEN EXAMINED FOR TRAUMATIZING LANGUAGE AND CHANGED TO BE MORE INCLUSIVE AND SUPPORTIVE.

In order to obtain input from the community, three initiatives were advanced: a Community Health Needs Assessment Steering Committee was convened, a community engagement survey was conducted, and several community conversations were held. The purpose of the CHNA Steering Committee is to support the CHNA process by engaging community members and providing feedback on the findings. All organizations involved with the CHNA Steering Committee have special knowledge of public health and underserved populations in the service area. Organizations involved in the Steering Committee are identified as having either a) conducted a previous Community Health Needs Assessment/Community Health Assessment due to IRS or accreditation requirements or b) already engaged in regional population health assessment. From January 2018 to April 2019 Steering Committee members served as key informants representing medically underserved, low- income or minority populations. The committee met bi-monthly to identify regional indicators and to inform the community engagement strategy for the creation of this document. Additionally, a survey to assess community health needs was conducted as part of the CHNA process during a six-week period between January and February 2019. One thousand one hundred (1100) individuals responded listing their top five health concerns. Seven Community Conversations occurred in March of 2019 as part of the CHNA process in which 60 individuals participated from all of the core jurisdictions. The purpose of the conversation was to elicit feedback from community members about publically available health data describing health conditions in the service areas and to review the survey results to further explore the findings. The top 10 health issues as identified from the survey results were presented to the attendees and they were asked to 1) rank the health issues according to which issues impacted them and the people close to them the most and 2) from a community perspective, rank the issues that should be addressed to improve the overall health of the region.

ST. JOSEPH'S HAS NOT INCLUDED IN THIS PLAN SPECIFIC ACTION ON THE FOLLOWING HEALTH NEEDS. THESE HEALTH NEEDS SURFACED DURING THE QUANTITATIVE AND QUALITATIVE DATA ASSESSMENT PROCESS, BUT WERE NOT SCORED AMONG THE HIGHEST PRIORITY NEEDS:1. HEALTHY MOMS AND BABIES - ST. JOSEPH'S DOES NOT PLAN TO DIRECTLY ADDRESS THIS PARTICULAR NEED BECAUSE THERE ARE LIMITED RESOURCES IN THE COMMUNITY. THEREFORE, IT WOULD BE DIFFICULT TO COMMIT SUFFICIENT TIME AND RESOURCES TO A COMMUNITY-LEVEL INITIATIVE. ST. JOSEPH'S WILL, HOWEVER, SUPPORT THE HEALTH OF MOMS AND BABIES THROUGH THE PROVISION OF OB/GYN AND PRIMARY CARE SERVICES FOR UNDERSERVED POPULATIONS.2. HOUSING - ST. JOSEPH'S DOES NOT PLAN TO DIRECTLY ADDRESS THIS PARTICULAR NEED BECAUSE IT WAS NOT PRIORITIZED AS HIGHLY AS THE BROADER ISSUE OF POVERTY/ECONOMIC INSTABILITY IN THE COMMUNITY, WHICH IT IS ADDRESSING IN THE IMPLEMENTATION STRATEGY. 3. RISK OF FALLS - ST. JOSEPH'S DOES NOT PLAN TO DIRECTLY ADDRESS THIS PARTICULAR NEED BECAUSE IT DID NOT SCORE AS ONE OF THE HIGHEST COMMUNITY-LEVEL PRIORITIES. ST. JOSEPH'S WILL, HOWEVER, CONTINUE TO IDENTIFY OPPORTUNITIES TO REDUCE FALL RISKS AMONG THOSE SERVED BY ST. JOSEPH'S IN BOTH INPATIENT AND OUTPATIENT SETTINGS."

These issues will be addressed indirectly in implementation strategies developed to meet the prioritized needs in areas that may overlap. For example, efforts to reduce the incidence of type 2 diabetes in the community may also reduce the incidence of heart disease. Mercy Springfield will consider focusing on these issues should resources become available. Until then, Mercy Springfield will support, as able, the efforts of partner agencies and organizations currently working to address these needs within the community."

IN 2016, THE WILL COUNTY MAPP COLLABORATIVE CONVENED TO CONDUCT THE THIRD ITERATION OF THE MAPP PROCESS. MAPP IS A COMMUNITY-DRIVEN, STRATEGIC PLANNING FRAMEWORK THAT ASSISTS COMMUNITIES IN DEVELOPING AND IMPLEMENTING EFFORTS AROUND THE PRIORITIZATION OF PUBLIC HEALTH ISSUES AND THE IDENTIFICATION OF RESOURCES TO ADDRESS THEM, AS DEFINED BY THE 10 ESSENTIAL PUBLIC HEALTH SERVICES. THE MAPP PROCESS HAS SIX PHASES WHICH INCLUDE FOUR ASSESSMENTS. COMMUNITY HEALTH STATUS ASSESSMENT THE COMMUNITY HEALTH STATUS ASSESSMENT (CHSA) IS ONE OF FOUR ASSESSMENTS CONDUCTED AS A PART OF THE MAPP PROCESS. DURING THIS ASSESSMENT, INFORMATION REGARDING DEMOGRAPHICS, HEALTH STATUS, HEALTH BEHAVIORS, AND SOCIAL DETERMINANTS IN THE COMMUNITY IS GATHERED AND ANALYZED. DATA IS COLLECTED FROM A VARIETY OF RESOURCES AND ANALYZED COMPARING LOCAL, STATE, AND NATIONAL BENCHMARKS WHEN AVAILABLE. THE CHSA WAS CONDUCTED MAY - NOVEMBER 2016. COMMUNITY THEMES AND STRENGTHS ASSESSMENT THE COMMUNITY THEMES AND STRENGTHS ASSESSMENT (CTSA) AIMS TO GATHER COMMUNITY MEMBERS' PERCEPTIONS, THOUGHTS, OPINIONS, AND CONCERNS REGARDING QUALITY OF LIFE IN WILL COUNTY. THIS INPUT PROVIDES VALUABLE INSIGHT INTO THE ISSUES OF IMPORTANCE TO THE COMMUNITY. THE CTSA WAS CONDUCTED DECEMBER 2016 - MARCH 2017. FORCES OF CHANGE ASSESSMENT THE FORCES OF CHANGE ASSESSMENT (FOCA) AIMS TO IDENTIFY ALL THE FORCES AND ASSOCIATED OPPORTUNITIES AND THREATS THAT CAN AFFECT, EITHER NOW OR IN THE FUTURE, THE LOCAL PUBLIC HEALTH SYSTEM. FORCES MAY BE SOCIAL, ECONOMIC, POLITICAL, TECHNOLOGICAL, ENVIRONMENTAL, SCIENTIFIC, LEGAL, AND/OR ETHICAL IN NATURE. FORCES CAN BE TRENDS, FACTORS, OR EVENTS. THE FOCA WAS CONDUCTED SEPTEMBER - DECEMBER 2016. LOCAL PUBLIC HEALTH SYSTEM ASSESSMENT THE LOCAL PUBLIC HEALTH SYSTEM ASSESSMENT (LPHSA) WAS CONDUCTED ON DECEMBER 1, 2016. THE LPHSA IS USED TO UNDERSTAND THE OVERALL STRENGTHS AND WEAKNESSES OF THE PUBLIC HEALTH SYSTEM BASED ON THE 10 ESSENTIAL PUBLIC HEALTH SERVICES. THE WILL COUNTY MAPP COLLABORATIVE WAS FORMED FOLLOWING THE COMPLETION OF THE MAPP PROJECT IN 2011. THE SECOND ITERATION OF THE MAPP PROCESS BEGAN IN SEPTEMBER 2012 AND WAS COMPLETED IN MAY 2014. THE THIRD ROUND OF THE MAPP PROCESS BEGAN IN JANUARY 2016 AND THE FOURTH ROUND BEGAN IN 2019 FOR COMPLETION IN 2020. THE MAPP EXECUTIVE COMMITTEE MEETS BI-MONTHLY TO PROVIDE OVERSIGHT TO THE ONGOING MAPP PROCESS AND MAKE RECOMMENDATIONS TO THE OVERALL OPERATIONS OF THE MAPP COLLABORATIVE. A PROGRAM COORDINATOR WAS APPOINTED IN MARCH 2013. THE COORDINATOR IS A FULL-TIME STAFF MEMBER OF THE WILL COUNTY HEALTH DEPARTMENT, WITH PARTIAL FUNDING BY THE WILL COUNTY MAPP COLLABORATIVE. ACTION TEAMS WERE ESTABLISHED AROUND THE IDENTIFIED PRIORITIES AND HAVE BEEN IMPLEMENTING ACTION PLANS AND STRATEGIES TO ADDRESS THOSE NEEDS. THE ACTION TEAMS ARE LED BY CHAIRS AND CO-CHAIRS FROM PARTNER ORGANIZATIONS. MOST OF THE TEAMS MEET MONTHLY OR BI-MONTHLY AS NEEDED.

THE MEETING WAS FACILITATED BY THE ILLINOIS PUBLIC HEALTH INSTITUTE. ATTENDEES IDENTIFIED FIVE POTENTIAL STRATEGIC ISSUES BUT COULD NOT COME TO CONSENSUS. IN MAY OF 2017, MAPP EXECUTIVE COMMITTEE MEMBERS WERE ASKED TO USE A PRIORITIZATION CRITERIA AND PLANNING WORKSHEET DURING THE DISCUSSION OF THE PREVIOUSLY IDENTIFIED STRATEGIC ISSUES. ALL ATTENDEES AGREED THAT TRANSPORTATION IS A CONCERN, BUT THAT IT COULD BE NESTED UNDER ALL STRATEGIC ISSUES AND BECOME A GOAL OF THE MAPP EXECUTIVE COMMITTEE. ACCESS TO HEALTHY LIFESTYLE CHOICES WOULD ALSO BE NESTED IN ALL ISSUES AS A STRATEGY. MAPP EXECUTIVE COMMITTEE MEMBERS DECIDED THAT BEHAVIORAL HEALTH, ACCESS TO DENTAL AND PRIMARY CARE, AND CHRONIC DISEASE WOULD BE THE TOP THREE STRATEGIC ISSUES FOR THE NEXT THREE YEARS."

AFTER CONSOLIDATING OVERLAPPING ISSUES IDENTIFIED IN THE MAPP CHNA, THE TOP IDENTIFIED NEEDS IN WILL COUNTY ARE: -IMPROVING BEHAVIORAL HEALTH -ACCESS TO DENTAL AND PRIMARY CARE -PREVENTING AND REDUCING CHRONIC DISEASE AMITA HEALTH SAINT JOSEPH MEDICAL CENTER WILL CONTINUE TO SERVE ON THE MAPP EXECUTIVE COMMITTEE AND MAPP ACTION TEAMS TO ADDRESS THE IDENTIFIED NEEDS IN WILL COUNTY WITHIN THE NEXT THREE TO FIVE YEARS. ALL SIGNIFICANT NEEDS IDENTIFIED IN THE MOST RECENTLY CONDUCTED CHNA ARE BEING ADDRESSED. Access to Dental and Primary Care Federally Qualified Health Centers (FQHC) and Free Clinic Partner Support: Provide financial, referral, and in-kind support to local FQHCs and free clinics. In fiscal year 2019. AMITA Health Saint Joseph Medical Center Joliet provided an annual donation as well as in-kind surgical and ancillary care for patients registered with the Will-Grundy Medical Clinic. The Clinic annually serves over 800 persons, who are the most economically vulnerable in our community and are not eligible for government assistance. In addition, in order to increase and secure access to primary health care for those uninsured and underinsured, AMITA HEALTH Saint Joseph Medical Center partnered with Aunt Martha's to ensure patients are assigned a medical home for post discharge care. In collaboration, Aunt Martha's provided an on-site coordinator and phone liaison to AMITA Health Saint Joseph Medical Center, to round in the emergency department as well as on inpatient units to coordinate primary care visits for patients and sign patients up for Medicaid services or insurance on the federal exchanges. Additionally, Saint Joseph Medical Center provides clinic space within the Medical Center campus for Aunt Martha's at a rental fee of only $1 per year. Oral Health Needs Assessment: Conduct a comprehensive oral health needs assessment for Will County to develop further strategies to address dental issues. In 2018 & 2019 a comprehensive oral needs assessment was completed in collaboration with the Will County Health Department. Findings from the assessment were circulated to key stakeholders in the community. A resource list of services for patients who utilize Medicaid was developed and Saint Joseph Medical Center circulated this resource to its emergency department team for referrals. Improving Behavioral Health Behavioral Health Capacity Assessment: A county-wide assessment to determine the current barriers to care for behavior health. In partnership with the Will County MAPP Collaborative a bi-annual capacity assessment was completed to identify gaps in mental health care and substance use disorder programs. Findings from the assessment were circulated to key stakeholders in the community. Additionally, an GIS mapped Behavioral Health Resource Directory was completed in collaboration with the Will County GIS department. Mental Health First Aid (MHFA): Certificate-based program using national, evidence-based curriculum that teaches the skills to respond to the signs of mental illness and substance use disorders. Saint Joseph Medical Center hosted and funded trainings for local law enforcement, first responders, the local YMCAs and other community members during the last 3-year action cycle. Family Guidance Center Warm Handoff Program In partnership with Family Guidance Center, a non-profit behavioral health organization, the Warm Handoff Program for those AMITA Health Saint Joseph Medical Center Joliet patients with an identified substance use disorder, was initiated in 2018. Family Guidance Center provides a full-time Certified Alcohol and Drug Counselor on site at AHSJMCJ so clinical staff that identify patients suffering with SUD can be routed to treatment options. Family Guidance specializes in finding appropriate inpatient or intensive outpatient treatment for those individuals who are uninsured or underinsured. Through the initiation of this program, over 360 persons have been screened and nearly 50 have been to treatment. Preventing and Reducing Chronic Diseases American Lung Association Tobacco 21 Act: Increasing the minimum age of sale for tobacco products to at least 21 years old will significantly reduce youth tobacco use and save thousands of lives. Through local and state advocacy efforts, AMITA Health was able to assist in the passage of reducing the age to obtain to tobacco to 21 years. This was passed into state law in 2019. Micro Pantry Through partnership with the Food Access team of the Will County MAPP Collaborative, additional sites of need were identified to install a micro pantry in Will County. As a result of this collaboration, AMITA Health Saint Joseph Medical Center Joliet installed a pantry outside of the chapel entrance in September 2018. A micro pantry is a 24/7 emergency food source typically location outside a hosting organization. Additionally, the all the micro pantries in the county were mapped using GIS services and promoted with those who have food insecurity. Food Insecurity Screenings: Food Box & Rx Mobile Food Pantries In collaboration with Northern Illinois Food Bank, AHSJMCJ began screening outpatient dietician and diabetes patients on food insecurity. In fiscal year 2019, patients who screened positive were given a voucher to obtain a free box of fresh fruit and produce from the Medical Center. On average 10-15 boxes per week were provided to patients. In fiscal year 2020, a new program, Rx Mobile Food Pantry, was initiated to bring an on-site mobile food pantry truck to the AHSJMJ campus twice per month to provide free produce, meat and dairy. Patients referred by the outpatient dietician and diabetes center are tracked on health outcomes related to obtaining healthy foods from the Rx Mobile Food Pantry. On average, each truck serves 220 individuals with free healthy food options that they would normally would not obtain on their limited incomes. Diabetes Prevention Program (DPP): Diabetes screening and education program focusing on the prevention of type 2 diabetes through lifestyle and nutrition therapy. In response to prevalence of diabetes we supported the Greater Joliet Area YMCA in implementing a Diabetic Prevention Program, an evidence-based program, to reduce the rate of uncontrolled Type 2 Diabetes. In addition, AMITA advocated for expansion and sustainability of the Diabetes Prevention Program with federal and state representatives to provide reimbursement for Medicare and coverage for Medicaid recipients. Diabetes Resource Guide: A comprehensive guide of services for diabetes and pre-diabetes for providers and community. Through partnership with the Will County MAPP Collaborative a diabetes resource guide for Will County was established and shared with key community stakeholders in 2018."

ONE MAJOR INITIATIVE INCLUDED A SERIES OF SEVEN FOCUS GROUPS WITH COMMUNITY MEMBERS IN THE SUMMIT HEALTH SERVICE AREA. THE GOAL OF THESE FOCUS GROUPS WAS TO GATHER INFORMATION ABOUT FRANKLIN COUNTYS TOP COMMUNITY HEALTH NEEDS FROM THE PERSPECTIVE OF TARGETED COMMUNITY INFORMANTS THAT INCLUDED SCHOOLS, LOW-INCOME, MINORITY, AND SENIOR POPULATIONS. A SECOND TOOL WAS A SURVEY OF 51 VETERANS CONDUCTED BY THE COMMUNITY SERVICES TEAM AT SUMMIT HEALTH. THIS SURVEY WAS DESIGNED TO CLOSELY MIRROR THE COMMUNITY BEHAVIORAL RISK FACTOR SURVEY AND PROVIDE MORE DETAILS ABOUT THE HEALTH CONDITIONS, RISKS, AND BEHAVIORS OF THIS POPULATION. IN ADDITION TO THE FOCUS GROUPS AND VETERANS SURVEY, SUMMIT HEALTH HOSTED A STAKEHOLDER FORUM ON APRIL 15, 2019 WITH MEMBERS OF THE HEALTHY FRANKLIN COUNTY LEADERSHIP TEAM. THE THREE PRIMARY GOALS OF THE FORUM WERE TO: (1) EXPLAIN THE CHNA PROCESS AND THE ROLE OF COMMUNITY STAKEHOLDERS; (2) PRESENT THE ANALYTIC FRAMEWORK AND PRELIMINARY COMMUNITY HEALTH DATA INCLUDED IN THIS SUMMARY; AND (3) GATHER INPUT FROM THESE COMMUNITY STAKEHOLDERS WHO HAVE PUBLIC HEALTH EXPERTISE OR SERVE MEDICALLY UNDERSERVED, LOW-INCOME, AND MINORITY POPULATIONS IN FRANKLIN COUNTY, ABOUT COMMUNITY HEALTH NEEDS AND COMMUNITY RESOURCES."

SINCE 2015, SUMMIT HEALTH'S COMMUNITY SERVICES TEAM ENGAGED WITH THE COMMUNITY TO ESTABLISH SPECIFIC ACTIVITIES TARGETED TO IMPROVING COMMUNITY HEALTH IN SEVEN PRIORITY AREAS. THE COMMUNITY PRIORITIES, GOALS, AND ACTIVITIES RESULTING FROM THE 2015 COMMUNITY HEALTH NEEDS ASSESSMENT PROCESS ARE FULLY DESCRIBED IN APPENDIX I OF THE 2018-2019 SUMMIT HEALTH COMMUNITY HEALTH NEEDS ASSESSMENT. THE SEVEN PRIORITY AREAS ESTABLISHED IN 2015 INCLUDE ACCESS TO PRIMARY CARE SERVICES, NUTRITION, PHYSICAL ACTIVITY, MENTAL HEALTH AND SUBSTANCE USE AND PREVENTION, EDUCATION AND COMMUNITY BASED EDUCATION, EARLY CHILDHOOD EDUCATION, AND ADOLESCENT HEALTH. TABLE 8 OF THE 2018-2019 SUMMIT HEALTH COMMUNITY HEALTH NEEDS ASSESSMENT SHOWS THE NUMBER OF INITIATIVES IMPLEMENTED AND HEALTH INDICATORS RELATED TO EACH. THE COMMUNITY, LED BY SUMMIT HEALTH AND THE HEALTHY FRANKLIN COUNTY LEADERSHIP GROUP, CREATED MANY COMMUNITY INTERVENTIONS, WITH THE MOST EFFORT DEDICATED TO NUTRITION, FOLLOWED BY MENTAL HEALTH AND SUBSTANCE USE AND PREVENTION, PHYSICAL ACTIVITY, AND ACCESS TO CARE. UNFORTUNATELY, ALL OF THESE ACTIVITIES HAVE NOT YET PRODUCED MUCH COMMUNITY-LEVEL CHANGE. ACCESS TO CARE HAS REMAINED VIRTUALLY UNCHANGED WITH THE EXCEPTION OF HIGHER RATES OF DENTAL VISITS. INDICATORS RELATED TO NUTRITION AND PHYSICAL ACTIVITY HAVE GOTTEN WORSE. MENTAL HEALTH INDICATORS HAVE ALSO DECLINED. EDUCATION AND COMMUNITY BASED EDUCATION INDICATORS HAVE REMAINED VIRTUALLY UNCHANGED. ACCESS TO EARLY CHILDHOOD EDUCATION HAS IMPROVED AS HAVE TEEN BIRTH RATES AND TEEN CHLAMYDIA RATES. THESE RESULTS ARE REMINDERS OF AT LEAST TWO IMPORTANT TRUTHS ABOUT IMPROVING PUBLIC HEALTH. FIRST, EFFECTING CHANGE WILL REQUIRE MORE THAN THREE OR FOUR YEARS. MOST OF THE PUBLIC HEALTH PROBLEMS IN OUR COMMUNITIES HAVE EMERGED OVER LONG PERIODS OF TIME AND IT WILL REQUIRE A LONG-TERM AND SUSTAINED INVESTMENT TO PRODUCE CHANGE. SECOND, MOST OF THE INDICATORS USED HERE ARE TRAILING INDICATORS THAT REFLECT AT LEAST IN PART SOCIAL AND STRUCTURAL CONTEXTS THAT ARE LIKELY TO MOVE ONCE THOSE UNDERLYING CONDITIONS BEGIN TO CHANGE. PUT SIMPLY, TIME AND SOCIAL CHANGE ARE NECESSARY CONDITIONS FOR IMPROVING THE HEALTH OF A COMMUNITY. THE PRIORITIES AND IMPACTS ESTABLISHED BY THE 2015 COMMUNITY HEALTH NEEDS ASSESSMENT (CHNA) PROVIDE A SUMMARY OF THE WORK IMPLEMENTED GUIDED BY THE RESULTS OF THE PREVIOUS CHNA REGARDING THE SEVEN PRIORITY AREAS IDICATED ABOVE. TO ASSESS PROGRESS TOWARDS THESE GOALS, COMMUNITY INDICATORS FROM THE 2015 CHNA AND 2019 CHNA WERE COMPARED IN THE CATEGORIES OF ORGANIZATIONAL INDICATORS AND PRESENTED IN A TABLE IN THE CHNA ASSESSMENT REPORT. ACCESS TO CARE HAS REMAINED VIRTUALLY UNCHANGED WITH THE EXCEPTION OF HIGHER RATES OF DENTIST VISITS. NUTRITION AND PHYSICAL ACTIVITY HAS GOTTEN WORSE FOR ALL INDICATORS, DESPITE THE MANY ACTIVITIES COMPLETED AT AN ORGANIZATIONAL LEVEL TO ADDRESS THESE ISSUES. MENTAL HEALTH INDICATORS HAVE ALSO DECLINED. EDUCATION AND COMMUNITY BASED EDUCATION INDICATORS HAVE REMAINED VIRTUALLY UNCHANGED. ACCESS TO EARLY CHILDHOOD EDUCATION HAS IMPROVED. TEEN BIRTH RATE AND TEEN CHLAMYDIA RATES HAVE GONE DOWN, WHILE THE CHLAMYDIA RATE FOR YOUNG ADULTS HAS INCREASED. THESE RESULTS SHOULD BE VIEWED WHILE CONSIDERING ONE IMPORTANT POINT - IT TAKES TIME IN ORDER TO SEE CHANGES AT THE COMMUNITY LEVEL; SIMPLY BECAUSE AN INDICATOR HAS NOT CHANGED OR HAS DECLINED, DOES NOT MEAN THAT THE INTERVENTION HAS FAILED - THERE MAY BE MANY REASONS WHY A POSITIVE CHANGE HAS NOT OCCURRED."

THE ACTIONS TAKEN WERE AS FOLLOWS: (1)OBESITY - MORE THAN 200,000 RESIDENTS ARE OVERWEIGHT OR OBESE. READING HOSPITAL INCREASED THE NUMBER OF F.I.T.T. (FUN ACTIVE HEALTHY YOUTH) PROGRAM SESSIONS FROM ONCE TO TWICE PER YEAR. THERE HAS BEEN AN INCREASE IN PARTICIPATION WITH THE ADDITION OF THESE SESSIONS FROM 1 SESSION WITH 10 PARTICIPANTS DURING FY2017 TO 4 SESSIONS WITH 39 PARTICIPANTS AND 4 SESSIONS WITH 33 PARTICIPANTS FOR FY2018 AND FY2019, RESPECTIVELY. THE BE WELL BERKS GRANT PROGRAM WAS CREATED AS A MEANS TO INVEST DOLLARS INTO COMMUNITY ORGANIZATIONS SEEKING TO ADDRESS AND REDUCE OBESITY AMONG RESIDENTS. TWO PROGRAMS THAT WERE FUNDED THROUGH THIS PROGRAM WERE THE ANTIETAM SCHOOL DISTRICT - ANTIETAM FIT PROGRAM (20,855.52 AWARD) AND NEW JOURNEY COMMUNITY OUTREACH, INC. - FIGHTING POVERTY. FEEDING HOPE. PROJECT (20,000.00 AWARD). READING HOSPITAL ALSO PARTNERED WITH ZAGSTER, INC. TO IMPLEMENT A BIKE SHARE PROGRAM FOR ITS STAFF. MEMBERSHIP HAS STEADILY INCREASED FROM FY2017 (86 MEMBERS) TO 105 MEMBERS DURING FY2018 AND 160 MEMBERS IN FY2019. (2)MENTAL HEALTH - MORE THAN 175,000 RESIDENTS SUFFER FROM ANXIETY OR DEPRESSIVE DISORDERS. TO ADDRESS THIS ISSUE, READING HOSPITAL HAS EMBEDDED 8 INTEGRATED CARE CLINICIANS WHO PROVIDE SERVICES AT 8 SITES TO PROVIDE BRIEF SUPPORTIVE THERAPY TO ASSIST WITH CURRENT CRISES, INTERMITTENT CONTACTS TO ASSIST WITH ONGOING MAINTENANCE OF GAINS, AND REFERRALS TO BEHAVIORAL HEALTH PROVIDERS AS NEEDED. AT THE ORIGINAL 2 PRACTICES, 75% OF TOTAL PATIENTS (13,840) WERE SCREENED. OF THOSE, 1,591 WERE MODERATELY DEPRESSED, AND 2,215 OF THE SCREENED PATIENTS LIVE IN THE 19601 ZIP CODE. READING HOSPITAL ALSO PARTNERED WITH SCREENING FOR MENTAL HEALTH, INC. TO IMPLEMENT A MINDKARE KIOSK, WHICH WAS LAUNCHED IN DECEMBER 2017, AIMED AT REDUCING MENTAL HEALTH STIGMA. MENTAL HEALTH SCREENINGS INCREASED FROM 39 KIOSK SCREENINGS AND 579 ONLINE SCREENINGS IN FY2018 TO 43 KIOSK SCREENINGS AND 644 ONLINE SCREENINGS (AS OF APRIL 2019). THE BE WELL BERKS GRANT PROGRAM ALSO AWARDED 34,030.48 IN FUNDING TO BERKS COUNSELING CENTER TO TRAIN PEERS IN WHOLE HEALTH ACTION MANAGEMENT (WHAM) AND COMMUNITY MEMBERS IN MENTAL HEALTH FIRST AID (MHFA) TRAINING. 12 PEER SPECIALISTS FROM 7 COMMUNITY AGENCIES PARTICIPATED IN WHAM TRAINING, AND 4 BERKS COUNSELING CENTER STAFF BECAME CERTIFIED MHFA TRAINERS. THREE MHFA TRAININGS HAVE BEEN HELD TO DATE FOR OVER 60 PARTICIPANTS. ADDITIONAL TRAININGS ARE BEING SCHEDULED. (3)ADDICTION - RESIDENTS LACK ACCESS TO COORDINATED, COMMUNITY-BASED TREATMENT. READING HOSPITAL WAS THE RECIPIENT OF A 500,000 GRANT FROM THE DEPARTMENT OF HUMAN SERVICES AND WAS DESIGNATED AN OPIOID USE DISORDER CENTER OF EXCELLENCE (COE). THE COE RESPONDED TO MORE THAN 1,200 REFERRALS FOR ADDICTION TREATMENT - 522 REFERRALS WERE MADE IN CY2017, 541 REFERRALS WERE MADE IN CY2018, AND 221 REFERRALS WERE MADE IN CY2019 (AS OF APRIL 2019).

THE HOSPITAL INSTITUTED A 24/7 WARM HANDOFF AND CREATED CARE TEAMS CONSISTING OF THERAPISTS, NURSES, PROVIDERS, AND CARE COORDINATORS TO PROVIDE COMPREHENSIVE CARE THAT ADDRESSES PHYSICAL, EMOTIONAL, AND BEHAVIORAL NEEDS OF PATIENTS STRUGGLING WITH ADDICTION. (4)ACCESS - UNMET SOCIAL NEEDS AND LACK OF CULTURALLY COMPETENT CARE CREATES BARRIERS. READING HOSPITAL RECEIVED A 4.5M GRANT FROM CENTER FOR MEDICARE & MEDICAID SERVICES TO IMPLEMENT THE ACCOUNTABLE HEALTH COMMUNITIES MODEL, KNOWN AT THE HOSPITAL AS THE COMMUNITY CONNECTION PROJECT (CCP), TO IDENTIFY AND ADDRESS UNMET SOCIAL NEEDS WITHIN THE MEDICARE AND MEDICAID PATIENT POPULATIONS. IN FY2019 (AS OF APRIL 2019), THE CCP SCREENED 27,455 SCREENINGS FOR 17,057 PATIENTS. AS A RESULT OF THOSE SCREENINGS, 7,394 COMMUNITY REFERRAL SUMMARIES WERE DISTRIBUTED, AND NAVIGATION SERVICES WERE OFFERED TO 2,019 PATIENT CASES. TOWER HEALTH MEDICAL GROUP'S STREET MEDICINE PROGRAM PROVIDES PRIMARY CARE TO HOMELESS INDIVIDUALS IN SOUP KITCHENS, HOMELESS SHELTERS, AND TENT SITES. SINCE ITS INCEPTION, THE PROGRAM HAS PROVIDED CARE TO OVER 900 UNIQUE PATIENTS. IN FY2017, 563 VISITS WERE CONDUCTED WITH 205 UNIQUE PATIENTS. IN FY2018, 810 VISITS WERE CONDUCTED WITH 407 UNIQUE PATIENTS. AND IN FY2019 (AS OF APRIL 2019), 716 VISITS WERE CONDUCTED WITH 320 UNIQUE PATIENTS. MIDPENN LEGAL SERVICES WAS AWARDED 85,024.00 IN FUNDING FROM THE BE WELL BERKS GRANT PROGRAM TO IMPLEMENT A MEDICAL LEGAL PARTNERSHIP PROGRAM. THE PROGRAM BEGAN PRACTICE IN NOVEMBER 2018, AND AS OF APRIL 2019, 109 REFERRALS WERE MADE IN THE AREAS OF HOUSING AND INCOME. TO IMPROVE CULTURALLY COMPETENT CARE, READING HOSPITAL IMPLEMENTED CULTURAL COMPETENCY TRAINING FOR STAFF. AS OF APRIL 2019, 4 OF 9 COHORTS WERE CONDUCTED, TRAINING 111 STAFF. A TENTH TRAINING SESSION IS PLANNED AS A TRAIN-THE-TRAINER STYLE COURSE. A NUMBER OF WORKPLACE AND VIRTUAL EXPERIENCE OPPORTUNITIES ARE MADE AVAILABLE TO STUDENTS FROM DIVERSE BACKGROUNDS TO ENCOURAGE SELECTION OF HEALTHCARE AS A CAREER PATH. IN FY2017, 312 STUDENTS ENGAGED IN THE PATHWAYS TO HEALTHCARE CAREERS PROGRAMS (MEDICAL EXPLORERS - 209 STUDENTS, JOB SHADOWING - 14 STUDENTS, HIGH SCHOOL INTERNSHIP PROGRAM - 8 STUDENTS). IN FY2018, 368 STUDENTS WERE ENGAGED (MEDICAL EXPLORERS - 184 STUDENTS, JOB SHADOWING - 83 STUDENTS, ADVENTURES IN HEALTH SCIENCE AND MEDICINE (AHSM) PROGRAM - 92 STUDENTS, HIGH SCHOOL INTERNSHIP PROGRAM - 9 STUDENTS).

THE IMPLEMENTATIN PLAN, WHICH COVERS A THREE YEAR SPAN, OUTLINES SPECIFIC STRATEGIES FOR EACH PRIORITY AREA THAT WILL BE IMPLEMENTED THROUGH A VARIETY OF METHODS INCLUDING INPUT FROM EXPERT PROVIDERS, COMMUNITY OUTREACH, AND COLLABORATIONS AND PARTNERSHIPS WITH COMMUNITY ORGANIZATIONS. AN OVERVIEW OF EACH PRIORITY FOLLOWS: ACCESS TO HEALTH CARE: THE GOAL IS TO INCREASE THE COMMUNITY'S ACCESS TO HEALTH CARE SERVICES, PARTICULARLY THOSE COMMUNITY MEMBERS CONSIDERED VULNERABLE AND/OR LIVING IN UNDERSERVED AREAS. READING HOSPITAL WILL UTILIZE GSI TECHNOLOGY TO IDENTIFY SUBPOPULATIONS WHO ARE AT RISK FOR HIGHER READMISSION RATES AND CHRONIC CONDITIONS OR DISEASES AND OVERLAY THIS WITH DATA SETS TO HELP SUPPORT PROGRAM DEVELOPMENT, PLACEMENT OF SERVICES, AND MESSAGING. THE INFORMATION GATHERED FROM THIS RESEARCH WILL PROVIDE SUPPORT AND DEVELOPMENT OF CURRENT PROGRAMS THAT DELIVER CARE TO VULNERABLE POPULATIONS (I.E. STREET MEDICINE, COMMUNITY PARAMEDICINE, AND REMOTE PATIENT MONITORING PROGRAMS), AS WELL AS TO DEVELOP PLANS TO INCREASE ACCESS TO SPECIALTY CARE THROUGH VIRTUAL OFFICE VISITS, TELECART, MOBILE APPS, AND TELEMEDICINE. BY STREAMLINING AN ADVANCED ACCESS CENTER WILL PROVIDE EASE OF ACCESS FOR COMMUNITY MEMBERS SEEKING TO SCHEDULE APPOINTMENTS WITH AMBULATORY AND SPECIALTY CARE SERVICE LINES. READING HOSPITAL WILL WORK TO IMPROVE CULTURAL SENSITIVITY OF STAFF BY CONDUCTING CULTURAL AWARENESS TRAININGS AND CREATING A DIVERSITY AND INCLUSION COUNCIL FOR PROVIDERS AND OTHER CLINICAL AND NON-CLINICAL STAFF TO PARTICIPATE. READING HOSPITAL WILL ALSO WORK TO INCREASE PARTICIPATION IN PROGRAMS DESIGNED TO EDUCATION STUDENTS ABOUT CAREERS IN HEALTHCARE - MEDICAL EXPLORERS, JOB SHADOWING, HIGH SCHOOL AND COLLEGE INTERNSHIP PROGRAMS, AND ADVENTURES IN HEALTH SCIENCE AND MEDICINE - THROUGH PROGRAM PROMOTION. SOCIAL DETERMINANTS OF HEALTH: THE GOAL IS TO IDENTIFY AND ADDRESS SOCIAL DETERMINANTS OF HEALTH (SDOH). READING HOSPITAL WILL SEEK TO ACHIEVE THIS GOAL IN THE CLINICAL ENVIRONMENT BY SCREENING MEDICARE AND MEDICAID PATIENTS IN IDENTIFIED CLINICAL AREAS, IDENTIFYING NEEDS, CONNECTING PATIENTS TO APPROPRIATE COMMUNITY RESOURCES, AND PROVIDING NAVIGATION SERVICES TO PATIENTS IDENTIFIED AS HIGH-RISK. THROUGH THE MEDICAL LEGAL PARTNERSHIP PROGRAM, READING HOSPITAL WILL UTILIZE AN IN-HOUSE ATTORNEY TO ASSIST PATIENTS WITH LEGAL ISSUES THAT HAVE AN ADVERSE EFFECT ON HEALTH (I.E. HOUSING, INCOME STABILITY, ETC.) TO HELP REDUCE TRANSPORTATION BARRIERS, READING HOSPITAL WILL IMPLEMENT THE RIDE HEALTH PROGRAM. READING HOSPITAL WILL ALSO IMPLEMENT COMMUNITY-BASED INTERVENTION INITIATIVES, SPECIFICALLY A COMMUNITY HEALTH WORKER PROGRAM TO WORK WITH PEDIATRIC ASTHMA PATIENTS, THEN SEEK TO EXPAND THE PROGRAM TO ADDITIONAL POPULATIONS. DISEASE PREVENTION & MANAGEMENT: THIS GOAL IS TO IMPLEMENT CHRONIC DISEASE PREVENTION AND MANAGEMENT PROGRAMS IN THE PRIMARY SERVICE AREA, SPECIFICALLY TARGETING VULNERABLE POPULATIONS. READING HOSPITAL WILL CONDUCT MULTIPLE CANCER SCREENING EVENTS FOR THE COMMUNITY, INCLUDING CERVICAL CANCER, BREAST CANCER, ORAL CANCER, AND SKIN CANCER SCREENINGS. READING HOSPITAL WILL IMPLEMENT SHORT AND LONG-TERM WELLNESS INITIATIVES THROUGH TOWER WELLNESS PROGRAMS, ENCOURAGE COMMUNITY PARTICIPATION IN BERKS TRAIL CHALLENGE, INCREASE PHYSICAL ACTIVITY AND HEALTH EATING HABITS AMONG SCHOOL-AGED YOUTH THROUGH THE F.I.T.T. PROGRAM, AND ENCOURAGE STAFF TO UTILIZE THE BIKE SHARE PROGRAM AS A FORM OF EXERCISE. READING HOSPITAL WILL PARTNER WITH COMMUNITY ORGANIZATIONS TO INCREASE ACCESS TO HEALTHY FOOD. ACCESS TO BEHAVIORAL HEALTH SERVICES: THE GOAL IS TO IMPROVE ACCESS TO SCREENING, ASSESSMENT, TREATMENT, AND SUPPORT FOR BEHAVIORAL HEALTH. READING HOSPITAL'S CENTER OF EXCELLENCE (COE) WILL SCREEN PATIENTS FOR OPIOID USE DISORDER (OUD) AND DETERMINE THE APPROPRIATE LEVEL OF CARE VIA STANDARDIZED PROCESSES (SBIRT) AND TOOLS (ASAM PLACEMENT CRITERIA). TOWER BEHAVIORAL HEALTH, A JOINT VENTURE WITH ACADIA, WILL BUILD A NEW 144-BED IMPATIENT BEHAVIORAL HEALTH FACILITY. MINDKARE'S KIOSK AND ONLINE FREE, ANONYMOUS, CONFIDENTIAL MENTAL HEALTH SCREENING TOOL WILL BE PROMOTED THROUGHOUT THE COMMUNITY. READING HOSPITAL'S BEHAVIORAL HEALTH INTEGRATION PROGRAM WILL INTEGRATE THERAPISTS INTO PRIMARY CARE PRACTICES WHERE PATIENTS WILL BE SCREENED FOR DEPRESSION, AND THOSE WHO SCREENED POSITIVE WILL BE CONNECTED TO THE EMBEDDED THERAPIST FOR ASSISTANCE. READING HOSPITAL WILL ALSO SEEK TO DECREASE THE STIGMA RELATED TO BEHAVIORAL HEALTH BY PARTNERING WITH BERKS COUNSELING CENTER TO CONDUCT MENTAL HEALTH FIRST AID TRAININGS FOR STAFF AND THE COMMUNITY. LIST OF HEALTH NEEDS THE FACILITY DOES NOT PLAN TO ADDRESS: READING HOSPITAL DOES NOT INTEND TO ADDRESS DIABETES AS A STAND-ALONE CONDITION. RATHER IT WILL BE CATEGORIZED AS A CHRONIC DISEASE AND WILL BE ADDRESSED IN THE CHRONIC DISEASE MANAGEMENT STRATEGY. DENTAL HEALTH, TOBACCO AND STDS WILL BE ADDRESSED THROUGH ONGOING HEALTH SYSTEM INITIATIVES AND/OR IN COLLABORATION WITH ESTABLISHED COMMUNITY ORGANIZATIONS."

IN ADDITION, MERCY HAS COMPLETED AN UPDATED COMMUNITY HEALTH NEEDS ASSESSMENT AND IMPLEMENTATION STRATEGY IN JUNE 2018. THIS UPDATED VERSION IS AVAILABLE ON THE MERCY HEALTH SERVICES WEBSITE.PRIOR TO 2013, MERCY'S COMMUNITY BENEFIT OUTREACH WAS FOCUSED ON A LARGE GEOGRAPHIC AREA WITHIN BALTIMORE CITY. THE HOSPITAL PRIMARY SERVICE AREA HISTORICALLY COVERED 17 ZIP CODES IN WHICH 60% OF ALL INPATIENT ADMISSIONS ORIGINATED. 15 OF THESE 17 ZIP CODES WERE PREVIOUSLY SELECTED AS MERCY'S COMMUNITY BENEFIT SERVICE AREA (""CBSA"") BASED ON THE PREVALENCE AND CONCENTRATION OF EMERGENCY ROOM VISITS. WHILE APPROPRIATE AND WELL INTENTIONED, THE USE OF ZIP CODES AS THE BASIS FOR MERCY'S CBSA HAS PROVED CUMBERSOME FOR THE FOLLOWING REASONS:- ZIP CODES ARE BY NATURE LARGE. MERCY'S PREVIOUS CBSA COVERED ALMOST 70 SQUARE MILES WITHIN THE CITY-THE TOTAL LAND AREA IN BALTIMORE IS 81 SQUARE MILES. OTHER PEER HOSPITALS HAVE DESIGNATED A MUCH SMALLER CBSA FOOTPRINT THAT TENDS TO FOCUS ON THE IMMEDIATE NEIGHBORHOOD(S) IN WHICH THEY RESIDE.- A CONCENTRATION OF EMERGENCY ROOM VISITS (OR ANY OTHER VARIABLE) MAY ONLY EXIST IN A SMALL PORTION OF A ZIP CODE. YET THE ENTIRE ZIP CODE WAS BEING ADDED INTO OUR CBSA. - ACCESSIBLE, TIMELY, AND HIGH QUALITY COMMUNITY HEALTH PROFILES HAVE ALREADY BEEN CREATED BY THE BALTIMORE CITY HEALTH DEPARTMENT. BUT THESE COMMUNITY HEALTH PROFILES ARE ORGANIZED BY MUCH SMALLER COMMUNITY STATISTICAL AREAS (CSAS), NOT ZIP CODES.- FINALLY, ZIP CODES ARE FACELESS, IMPERSONAL DESIGNATIONS THAT DO NOT CARRY THE SAME CONNECTION AND IMPACT AS A SPECIFICALLY NAMED COMMUNITY. MERCY'S COMMUNITY BENEFITS COMMITTEE BELIEVES THAT WE SHOULD FOCUS ATTENTION ON OUR NEIGHBORS IN ""MIDTOWN OR ""MT. VERNON"", AND NOT ""21202"".DURING A SERIES OF MEETINGS, MERCY'S COMMUNITY BENEFITS COMMITTEE DISCUSSED THE SOCIOECONOMIC AND HEALTH PARAMETERS THAT SHOULD HELP DEFINE MERCY'S ""COMMUNITY"" FOR PURPOSES OF THIS CHNA. THE SISTERS OF MERCY WERE ORIGINALLY FOUNDED IN DUBLIN, IRELAND TO CARE FOR HOMELESS, ABUSED AND NEGLECTED WOMEN AND CHILDREN. THIS TIMELESS LEGACY INFLUENCED THE COMMITTEE TO FOCUS ATTENTION ON CERTAIN TARGET POPULATIONS, SUCH AS INFANTS, WOMEN, AND THE IMPOVERISHED. WITH A STRONG DESIRE TO BE DATA-DRIVEN AND MISSION FOCUSED, THE COMMITTEE IDENTIFIED THREE RELEVANT FACTORS TO HELP SHAPE THE COMMUNITY IN WHICH MERCY WILL FOCUS ITS LIMITED FINANCIAL RESOURCES AS PART OF THE CHNA PROCESS: - LOW BIRTH WEIGHT BABIES BORN AT MERCY- REPEAT EMERGENCY ROOM VISITORS (10+ VISITS IN ONE YEAR)- CHARITY CARE RECIPIENTSADDITIONALLY, SINCE THE IMPLEMENTATION OF THE NEW MARYLAND ALL-PAYER MODEL WHICH FOLLOWED THE COMPLETION OF MERCY'S 2013 CHNA, MERCY IS INCREASINGLY FOCUSED ON HIGH-UTILIZER PATIENTS, INCLUDING THOSE WITHIN OUR PREVIOUSLY-DEFINED CHNA COMMUNITY BENEFIT SERVICE AREA.

LOUIS & FRANKLIN COUNTY HOSPITAL'S COMMUNITY HEALTH IMPROVEMENT PLAN (CHIP), WHICH CAN BE ACCESSED HERE: HTTPS://WWW.MERCY.NET/forms/community-benefits/. Some notable achievements during the 2018 year include:- 2018 - Patients seen in the Mercy Hospital St. Louis Emergency Department who had not seen a primary care provider in recent years or were uninsured were referred to the Community Health Worker (CHW) program which began in 2018. The CHW helps the patient establish a ""medical home and/or address social determinants of health issues and are screened and assisted with applying for Medicaid, market place insurance, disability or hospital charity care.- 2018 - The Community Referral Coordinator (CRC) program at Mercy Hospital St. Louis has evolved to a 65% appointment kept rate when encountered by a CRC which works in the department (ED) in order to provide patients without a medical home assistance in finding a primary care or specialty care provider, along with social service support, as appropriate. - 2018 - Mercy Hospital St. Louis implemented several behavioral health programming; Hospital Community Linkages (HCL) Project, the Youth Emergency Room Enhancement Project which mirrors the Emergency Room Enhancement Project for adults. These programs focus on enhancing support for adult and youth high utilizers of ER with the primary goal of reducing preventable hospital contacts across the region by fostering engagement through support, intensive outreach and improving outcomes through connection to community. Mercy Hospital St. Louis also implemented the Engaging Patients in the Care Coordination Program also known as EPICC, this program provides intensive referral and linkage services by Recovery Coaches, peers with lived experience, to impact those who have overdosed on opioids to establish immediate linkages to substance use and medication assisted treatment services. - 2018 - Mercy Hospital St. Louis in partnership with Generate Health, Barnes Jewish Hospital and SSM Health System continued their collaborative work on the BUILD Health Challenge Grant which focuses on decreasing Maternal/Child Health and infant mortality rates by addressing disparities and transportation.- 2018 - Mercy Hospital St. Louis continued the Diabetes Empowerment Education Program for minorities battling diabetes in North St. Louis County.- 2018 Mercy Hospital Washington Social Workers continued establishing ED patients with Primary Care Physicians for follow-up care and educating the patient on possibly more affordable options when needing care.- 2018 Mercy Hospital Washington opened a free COPD education clinic in Washington for their patients- 2018 Mercy Hospital Washington opened a Winter Warming Overnight Center to prevent those sleeping outside from freezing to death.- 2018 - Mercy Hospital Washington, in partnership with the Multi-County Drug Task Force and Franklin County Sheriff's Office, began training first responders in several counties so that they could begin carrying and utilizing Narcan to revive overdosed patients while waiting for the ambulance to arrive. The local Mercy hospital stored the Narcan in their pharmacy.Additional needs being addressed by the Mercy Hospital St. Louis and Mercy Hospital Washington include: - Violence: Domestic, Elderly, Child Abuse, and TraffickingMHSL - MHSL and Alternatives to Living in Violent Environments (ALIVE), a St. Louis based domestic violence agency, have implemented Project HOPE, the only program in the St. Louis area that allows domestic violence survivors to file for, and potentially have granted, orders of protection while still in a hospital setting. Information regarding ALIVE's programming and services is distributed throughout MHSL, with Spanish translations provided to better reach patients who speak limited English. MHSL is also actively involved in the Coalition Against Trafficking and Exploitation (CATE), and partners with St. Martha's Hall, a Catholic Charities organization that provides shelter and services to women and children who have survived domestic violence. Mercy will continue its collaboration and involvement with these groups, as well as the awareness and education campaigns it has begun with restroom resource posters, a training video, and the incorporation of a screening question/referral process in Mercy's Electronic Medical Record (EMR). However, it was felt by Mercy's CHC that while continued attention to this issue was important, the issues of access, health equity, and the community's crisis with behavioral health and addiction demanded Mercy's focus at this time.MHW - MHW works closely with domestic violence, sex trafficking and family services agencies, such as Alternatives to Living in Violent Environments (ALIVE) and local law enforcement to insure patients are given safe choices while in a hospital setting. Mercy has begun safety awareness and educational campaigns which includes internal training videos, restroom resource posters, and the incorporation of a safety screening/referral question which cues up in each patient's Mercy's Electronic Medical Record (EMR).- Obesity/Poor Nutrition/Physical InactivityMHSL & MHW - Although neither chose healthy lifestyles as a priority community health need to be addressed, Mercy has focused on its own coworkers, 10,000+ in the East Community, as a start to addressing this need. A robust initiative, Mercy's Healthification program, provides comprehensive health evaluation, screening, education, and incentives to increase healthy behaviors and improve health among Mercy coworkers. Mercy Clinic also offers a variety of programs and services to address chronic conditions and a healthy lifestyle.- Chronic Conditions: Heart Disease, Diabetes, or Asthma and AllergiesA significant concern relating to chronic conditions is the disparity in health outcomes and treatment for Blacks/African-Americans and Whites/Caucasians. MHSL recently signed an American Hospital Association Health Equity pledge and is beginning to implement ""Call to Action"" goals aimed at identifying and, subsequently, addressing areas of health disparity and service gaps. As the leader in St Louis County for newborn deliveries, MHSL has decided to take on the significant issue of health equity by beginning with maternal/child health disparities and addressing some of the region's needs with low birth weight babies. Mercy has also committed to addressing health equity in the Inner North region community of Wellston; Mercy is outlining a collaborative community plan to address overall health equity with these community members.- Cancers and Tobacco UseMHSL & MHW - Community cancer screenings and education continue to be offered regionally. Efforts to address tobacco cessation will continue through Mercy's Certified Health and Wellness Coach/Mercy Road to Freedom program though Mercy's Cardiopulmonary Rehab area. Additionally, Mercy will continue to advocate around measures that promote tobacco cessation. For example, Tobacco 21, a bill introduced by a MHSL physician in 2016 to raise the tobacco products purchase age to 21 in St. Louis County. The bill was passed and the new tobacco products purchase age law will go into effect on December 1, 2016. MHW will look for opportunities to expand this legislation to Franklin County. Other identified needs not being addressed and why not, if applicable.The following needs are not being addressed:- Sexually Transmitted InfectionsMHSL & MHW - Infectious disease physicians at Mercy will continue to address this issue through collaborative work. Mercy will not, however, take a lead role on this issue as there are some limitations to the organization's partnerships in this area as a Catholic Health System. - Physical Environment: Air/Water Quality and HousingMHW - In the category of Physical Environment, MHW has chosen Transportation, under the Access to Care priority. Collaboration with local coalitions addressing homelessness and housing will continue as will Mercy's support of industry, government, non-governmental organizations and the public in addressing air and water quality in our area."

The findings in this CHNA result from a year-long process of collecting and analyzing data and consulting with stakeholders throughout the community and the region. The CHNA can be used as a roadmap to guide service providers, especially public health, in their efforts to develop programs and services targeted to improve the overall health and well-being of people and communities in the region. Working within the framework provided by New York State's (NYS) Prevention Agenda, GFH and Warren, Washington and Saratoga County Public Health Departments collaborated in the development of the CHNA. Additionally, GFH coordinated with Fulton, Essex, Hamilton, Franklin and Clinton County Public Health, as well as with several other hospitals in the region, through the regional health assessment and planning efforts coordinated by the Adirondack Rural Health Network (ARHN). Since 2002, ARHN has been recognized as the leading sponsor of formal community health planning in the region. The Community Health Assessment (CHA) Committee, facilitated by ARHN, is made up of hospitals and county health departments working together to utilize a systematic approach to community health planning and assessment. A variety of data sources were used to inform the county and hospital assessments. The two most significant resources used were developed and provided by the ARHN collaboration: 1) publicly available county health indicator data and 2) data collected from a regional community stakeholder survey. Each county public health department, as well as GFH, used additional data sources to supplement this information and inform the process based on their needs. Additional data sources used by GFH include the NYS Prevention Agenda Dashboard, County Health Rankings, the NYS Cancer Registry, the Governor's Cancer Research Initiative - Warren County Cancer Incidence Report, and an attitudinal tobacco assessment conducted in Warren, Washington and Saratoga counties.

202013119349300201,141338413,PART V LINE 11,"After careful consideration and extensive internal and external discussions, GFH determined that the most effective strategy would be twofold: 1) ensure the hospital coordinated with and/or participated in each of the public health departments' assessment processes and 2) utilize the results of each of the county assessments to inform a coordinated and complementary regional CHNA for the GFH service area. In addition to evaluating the priorities and county level data indicators for our local county health departments, GFH considered our expertise, capacity, funding, and potential impact. The following have been identified as the most significant health needs for the population served by GFH. These needs will be the major focus of GFH's community health strategies for 2019 - 2021: Priority Area: Prevent Chronic Disease Focus Area 1 - Healthy Eating and Food Security Focus Area 2 - Physical Activity Focus Area 3 - Tobacco Prevention Focus Area 4 - Chronic Disease Preventive Care and Management. GFH is expanding the scope of work to include an additional priority area. Priority Area: Prevent Communicable Diseases Focus Area 5 - Antibiotic Resistance and Healthcare-Associated Infections In regards to regional priorities, and in addition to GFH choosing the four focus areas under the Prevent Chronic Diseases priority area, as part of the community health planning and assessment process, the CHA Committee identified and selected Prevent Chronic Diseases as one of the regional priorities in support of the NYS Prevention Agenda 2019-2024. The CHA Committee also selected an additional priority, Promote Well-Being and Prevent Mental and Substance Use Disorders. Additional analysis revealed an increasing demand and need for mental health and substance abuse services throughout the three-county region. GFH recognizes this trend and the need for quality services and program, however, has not historically formalized strategies into the plan due to lack of resources and capacity. Currently, Glens Falls Hospital is the contracted behavioral health provider for Warren and Washington counties. The need will only increase, and we are working to proactively ensure patients have access to the care they need. Most recently, Glens Falls Hospital is working with Warren and Washington Counties to conduct a thoughtful and deliberate partnership exploration process for outpatient behavioral health and substance use services. We are working with the Counties to identify potential partners who can help us better serve patients, with a goal to expand access to much needed specialized behavioral health services in our community. Simultaneously, GFH will continue to work through initiatives such as Health Home and DSRIP to work with all providers on integrated care models and population health strategies. Additional community health needs, such as housing, transportation, and other social determinants of health, are not addressed in the action plan due to lack of resources, expertise and/or quantitative data to support a proper assessment and plan.

The statewide Community Engagement Committee met monthly from March 2018 through January 2019 to review and provide input on every aspect of engagement process. In addition to the state-level Community Engagement Committee, a Local Community Engagement Planning Committee in each of Maines 16 counties planned and implemented the logistics of community forums and events within each district. These committees were comprised of hospitals, public health district liaisons, and a variety of additional partners. The 2018 Community Engagement Toolkit was designed to assist the Local Community Engagement Planning Committees in this effort. Criteria for visualizing data included areas identified as a health priority in the last CHNA, significant changes in the data over time, or where a countys data was notably better or worse than the state or the nation. Forum agenda items included remarks from health leaders; a review of previous health improvement efforts; a review of county-level data, discussion, and prioritization in small groups; and an overall forumwide voting process. The Community Engagement and Steering Committees created and approved a rubric to guide the selection criteria for the subset of data to be presented in each forums PowerPoint presentations. Small groups had 35-45 minutes to discuss the data in the presentation and the full county profile, and to share their own experiences in order to identify their top county health priorities. Table facilitatiors guided these discussions using key questions and worksheets during these small groups were collated and presented to the larger plenary session, where each attendee voted for their top four priorities. Votes were tallied and a hierarchy emerged. The summary votes for each forum were used to develop the county level priorities. If multiple forums were held in a county, the forum results for forums held with the general community were included in the total votes for the county. In cases where a forum was held with a specific population, for example, LGBTQ youth or older adults, then the results of their voting and discussion were included in the section describing the needs of that particular population. To arrive at the top countywide community health issues, votes from the broad community forums were combined for each of the priority areas to identify priority areas which fell within 70% of the combined voting total. The community forum participants also shared knowledge on gaps and assets available in their communities to address each of the top four priorities identified. The information gathered in this report is a start for further asset and gap mapping for each priority selected by the county. Three community engagement activities were held in Androscoggin County. The County Health Rankings Health Action Forum was held on June 27, 2018. The purpose of this event was to solicit community information from immigrants, refugees and asylum seekers on health issues specific to this population. A further goal was to build and strengthen connections between small immigrant-led organizations working in public health in Maine and the district and state-level public health organizations. Finally, this event hoped to generate takeaway action steps and suggestions for interventions aimed at improving health equity in Maine. There were only two County Health Rankings Health Action Forums held in Maine. The other was held in Portland on June 25, 2018. The key informant interview guide was developed with input from the Community Engagement and Steering Committee members and consisted of Five questions. Thirty-one interviews were conducted by JSI and 11 by members of Local Community Engagement Planning Committees. Information gathered from the key informant interviews is included in discussions where applicable in the county level report within each of the county priorities. For example, when discussing substance use, a discussion of the needs of vulnerable populations within this priority was also included. The state level report provides a summary of key findings from these interviews for each of the ten vulnerable populations. All outcomes from these efforts were collected via the Community Outreach Reporting Tool or the Key Informant Reporting tool. Both of these collection tools were online surveys within Survey Monkey. Other data collection tools included Table Facilitators notes, forum registrations, and sign-ins."

The 2019-2021 Community Health Needs Assessment involved a primary data collection strategy in conjunction with secondary data. Community input on health priorities in Westchester County was gathered through a community survey and an in-person summit with stakeholders. Multiple approaches to primary data collection were used to make use of existing and cost-efficient data collection activities and to employ multiple methods at gathering community input, so that no single group was over represented in the identification of community concerns. Montefiore New Rochelle engaged with the Westchester County Department of Healths online Community Resident Survey in the winter and spring of 2019 to facilitate the implementation of the primary data collection process for the Community Health Needs Assessment for Westchester County and to assist in the facilitation of these community level connections thereby alleviating additional surveying overload. The community survey could be completed via a web-based tool (SurveyMonkey) or on paper. The paper surveys were available in English and Spanish and other languages by request. The primary distribution of the survey was conducted through the Westchester County Department of Healths Office of the Administrator and was made available through its website. The Montefiore Hudson Valley Collaborative also distributed the survey to its membership of over 900 hospitals, community based organizations, faith-based organizations and other social service providers. The survey was disseminated through multiple distribution points including other hospitals, health care providers, community-based organizations and others. A Community Health Survey of the Hudson Valley was created and administered by Siena College Research Institute on behalf of the CHA Collaborative. The survey was conducted in all seven counties in the region. Additionally, in March and April of 2019, Members of the Local Health Department Prevention Agenda collaborative conducted 10 focus groups with health and service providers to identify the most pressing barriers and issues facing the populations they serve. The Local Health Department Prevention Agenda collaborative designed the focus groups as a supplement to the Community Health Survey acknowledging that certain populations, mainly those who speak English as a second language, those experiencing homelessness, members of the LGBTQ community, and children may have been under represented in the original data collection process. In addition to collaborative input from the local Department of Health, Montefiore worked closely with it communities, organized partnership and collaborates, and other providers in lower Westchester as well as extensive work with representatives of the affected communities to help Montefiore to identify health care needs and determine the appropriate configuration of services. While the exact priorities identified through each of these approaches varied somewhat, there was a consistent placement of healthy eating and food security, and its related environmental factors of access to healthier food and the health consequences of chronic disease care and screening as the top community health priorities. Montefiore New Rochelle meets regularly with the local Department of Health, and continues to participate in a MHVC DSRIP aligned Collaborative with membership from St. Josephs Medical Center (including St. Vincents Hospital Westchester), St. Johns Riverside Hospital, White Plains Hospital, and Burke Rehabilitation Hospital working to ensure that the Community Service Plan and DSRIP goals retain their alignment. As the CHNA process was conducted simultaneously with the New York State Community Service Plan (CSP) review, there is strong alignment between the areas of focus in this report and the areas presented in the CSP. Montefiore will continue to work with its partners on existing program initiatives in its mission of advancing healthcare to the communities that it serves. The hospital has not received any written comments concerning it most recently conducted CHNA and implementation strategies."

The reporting data between the two facilities are essentially the same, even though demographically distinct, due to the close proximity of each facility to the other, the high migration of patients between facilities and the sharing of employees. Both organizations are also members of the Montefiore Health System, the premier academic health system and the University Hospital for Albert Einstein College of Medicine, serving the 3.1 million people living in the New York City region and the Hudson Valley."

202033169349303983,462931956,"Schedule H, Part V, Section B, Lines 11","In the Comprehensive Community Services plan developed for 2016-2018, the priority areas selected were Prevent Chronic Disease and Promote Healthy Women Infants and Children. Through the projects and activities initiated during that plan, Montefiore New Rochelle was able to contribute to the overall trend improvements in those areas for New York State. However, although Westchester County has continued to be among the top five and has shown improvements along with the rest of New York State, the rates for conditions identified in the communities of New Rochelle remains higher in most cases than the countywide and statewide averages. The Priority Areas that were selected in 2016 have been expanded upon to have greater alignment with the initiatives of the Delivery System Reform Incentive Payment Program (DSRIP). Montefiore New Rochelle choose to continue its work on Maternal and Child Health with an emphasis on breastfeeding. Furthermore, Montefiore New Rochelle will continue their participation with the Westchester County Department of Healths Community Service Plan Collaborative to coordinate their alignment with the Countys other healthcare providers. Montefiore has elected to retain these two priority areas, Prevent Chronic Disease and Promote Healthy Women Infants and Children for the 2019-2021 plan. Montefiore New Rochelle Hospital has also added a new priority area for this cycle: Prevent Communicable Disease with a focus on vaccine preventable disease, specifically HPV. The first Priority area selected was preventing chronic Disease with a specific focus on preventive Care and Management. This hospital is addressing this need by providing access to a range of preventive, maintenance and self-management programs for individuals across the pre-diabetes and diabetes spectrum with assistance from our partners in providing technical Assistance, opportunities for neighborhood based culture/linguistic specific classes and opportunities for data sharing and collaboration. Our goal is to increase early detection of cardiovascular disease, diabetes, pre-diabetes and obesity. The targeted community is mainly low-income individuals that includes a high proportion of Hispanic and non-Hispanic black. The second priory area selected was to promote healthy women, infants and children with a focus on perinatal and infant health. The hospital will address this need by engagement and referral into appropriate clinical or community programs to support mothers with breastfeeding. Our partners will also provide technical assistance and supportive community programming. Our goal is to increase the percentage of all infants who are exclusively breastfed in the hospital by 10% from 47.0% to 51.7%. The third and new priority area added for the 2019-2021 plan is to prevent communicable disease focusing on vaccine preventable diseases. We plan to support outreach efforts through education and advocacy of the importance of HPV vaccination with parents of children and adolescents age 9-13 and provide vaccinations with the goal of increasing the percentage of NYS 13-year-old adolescents with a complete HPV vaccine series by 10% to 37.4%. The targeted community is mainly low-income individuals including a large Hispanic or non-Hispanic black population. Despite each of the different methods and approaches to primary data collection in gathering community input, there was a consistent focus on obesity and related behaviors and outcomes among the main community health concerns. Obesity and its related behaviors have significant impact in chronic disease, therefore, it is intended that the programs that are detailed specifically for the reduction of obesity will also affect the prevalence of Diabetes, hypertension, asthma, cancer and cardiovascular disease in Westchester County. Montefiore has a vast portfolio of programs and services that address a majority of the significant community health needs identifies in the community health needs assessment. The breadth and depth of the programs and service vary, but each address a need identifies in the community. In particular, there are programs underway in collaboration with Hudson River Healthcare and Westchester local government units to work with bodegas on healthy snack displays and creating walking paths in parks and communities. In addition to the multiple resources that have been developed at Montefiore independently and through partnership with other organizations, there continues to be a need for community-based programs and resources that can augment Montefiores programs and services. Montefiore continues to engage in cross-sector partnerships with government, community organizations, hospitals, and businesses to address the health and social needs of our patient population. Since the previous version of this report in 2016, Montefiore has begun using the internet database platform www.nowpow.com, to connect patients to needed resources, which has been a challenge for the health care sector. This online tool is a much more comprehensive and practical alternative to the homegrown referral guides that many health care providers have had to use in the past, which were difficult to search and keep-up-to-date, a problem that is largely addressed by the online version. Many Montefiore sites have been introduced to this new online resource and work is underway to more seamlessly integrate this kind of solution into the various workflows across the ambulatory, ED and inpatient setting. The use of an internet database will allow Montefiore to connect patients to important community resources provided outside of the health system by many of our community partners to address community needs such as housing (quality and affordability), transportation, employment, and education. We at Montefiore recognizes the importance of addressing the social determinants of Health as part of our mission of advancing the health of the communities that we serve."

THE INITIAL 2013 COMMUNITY HEALTH NEEDS ASSESSMENT IDENTIFIED FIFTEEN HEALTH NEEDS, AND, CONSISTENT WITH FEDERAL REQUIREMENTS, THE 2019 AND 2016 CHNAS CONTINUE TO IDENTIFY ALL FIFTEEN (CONSOLIDATED TO FOURTEEN THROUGH COMBINATION OF THE INTERCONNECTED OBESITY/DIABETES AND FOOD INSECURITY TOPICS) HEALTH NEEDS AS REMAINING IN NEED OF ATTENTION BY THE HOSPITAL.

WHILE 57 (84%) OF THESE REMAINED ENGAGED AFTER TWO MONTHS, ONLY 13 (19%) COMPLETED BOTH THE HOME VISITS AND ASTHMA EDUCATION COMPONENTS. THE PROJECT'S FINAL REPORT CONCLUDED THAT CULTURAL DYNAMICS (""FATALISM"") AND STRUCTURAL BARRIERS (ISSUES OF TRUST) MAY HAVE PREVENTED INDIVIDUALS FROM ACCESSING OPTIMAL CARE.-ALTHOUGH THE PROJECT CLEARLY DEMONSTRATED THE CHALLENGES OF ENGAGING PATIENTS, THE CLINICAL ASPECTS OF THE THREE-TIERED MODEL REMAIN VALID.

The health district steering committee provided executive oversight. For the collaborative design, the process for gathering primary data, and the process for identifying, collecting, interpreting, and analyzing secondary data, the consultants referenced numerous methods for both qualitative and quantitative data. The consultants sought data that reflected recent as well as emerging issues by people who lived in the hospitals' service areas, with attention to vulnerable populations and social determinants of health. Secondary data provided information about demographics, health conditions, and health-related issues as of 2016. Primary data reflected the opinions and attitudes of individuals and agencies motivated to attend a meeting or complete a survey. Their passion and level of interest is helpful to hospitals who are contemplating future programs that depend on community support. While not designed to be statistically representative of all 3.3 million residents of the region, there was often remarkable alignment among the top 5-10 priorities from meetings, individual surveys, agency surveys, and health departments. In addition to the regional data, the Clark County Combined Health District also held several (6) public information meetings throughout Clark County in the Summer of 2018 where community members could attend and give their feedback on localized health needs. One was conducted by the THC/GDAHA consultants, and five were conducted by the Clark County Combined Health District. 68 people contributed votes to identify a total of 18 priorities. Surveys from individual consumers living in Clark County were also collected between 6/19/18 and 8/3/18. Eight organizations serving County residents, especially vulnerable populations, responded with their priorities. The Stakeholder Group compared secondary data to the information gathered via community meetings, individuals surveyed, organizations surveyed, and the Clark County Combined Health District data. All participants at the Clark County Community Health Steering Committee were asked to brainstorm for 8-10 minutes about what factors and goals they should prioritize in terms of community health. They were asked to write down the ideas, general or specific, onto post it notes and place them under one of three categories on the board: Big Prizes (Health Outcomes), Causal Factors, or Other. These Ideas were then read to the group and a second round of brainstorming allowed for any other additional post-it notes to be added to the board. Suggestions were then rearranged via discussion by the committee into subcategories such as behavioral health, cross-cutting, etc. Post its were then placed categorically on the wall under the County Health Ranking Model. From this list our Significant Health Needs were identified.

Chronic Disease Implementation Activities: Goal: Asthma - By March 2019, the Chronic Disease Task Force will show a decrease in the number of asthma attacks that require emergency room services or treatment. Congestive Heart Failure - By March 2018, the Chronic Disease Task Force will work to decrease the number of readmissions among unaffiliated CHF patients (those without a primary care physician) within 30-90 days of discharge by establishing primary care providers/medical homes for 50% of patients. Diabetes - By March 2018, the Chronic Disease Task Force will increase the number of patients completing diabetes education courses by adding ADA-certified sites in Clark County. Oral health - The Chronic Disease Task Force will campaign for fluoride to be added to the Clark County water supply to decrease the prevalence of tooth decay and tooth extractions. 2019 Strategies and Outcomes: Springfield Regional Medical Center (SRMC) participates in the Chronic Disease Task Force. The following actions were taken by the hospital or the Task Force: * Asthma - Completed background research to on current practices to review successful evidence-based practices and existing assessments. The hospital had multiple contacts with the Clark County Combined Health Department, ED personnel and SRMC Case Management to establish a referred program for asthma patients. * Asthma - The hospital engaged strategic partners to develop an effective home-based environmental assessment program with the goal to decrease the number of serious asthma attacks in children that require emergency room services. In 2019, the hospital continued its work through meetings and communication as follows: - Continued communication with the Asthma Subgroup with emailed updates. Four updates were provided in 2019. - Provided periodic contact with cost-cutting partners. Attended three meetings with MVCDC, four health fairs, one local pharmacist meeting, and mailed and/or delivered materials to care providers four times in 2019. - Maintained email communication with school nurses, and co-hosted two school nurse training sessions. - Attended five asthma meetings hosted by the Ohio Department of Health. - Made multiple contacts and attended one meeting with the hospital ED personnel and one meeting with hospital Case Managers to discuss referreal to the program. - Utilized social media to deliver periodic outreach and educational materials. * Asthma - Continued to provide information to local care providers in 2019, conducted in-home assessments for 33 children and 17 adults, provided supplies to 27 families, and reduced unscheduled medical visits by 90% at 30 day contact, and 88% at 6 month contact. * Congestive Heart Failure (CHF) - Collected data on the number of patients discharged with CHF without a primary care physician (PCP). In 2019, appointments were made after discharge for 60-70 Congestive Heart Failure (CHF) patients via a previously established program with Rocking House Center to identify and follow unaffiliated patients who were accepted by a PCP/medical home and track the following metrics: weight, medication compliance, symptoms and readmissions at 30, 60 and 90 days. * Diabetes - Maintained ADA certification at The Rocking Horse Center in Clark County. -Continue to track the number of referrals by PCP/medical homes to education programs and track the number of participants completing the programs. There has been slight growth in participants at this location. In 2019, 65% of participants completed the programs. * Diabetes - The hospital measured attainment of patient-defined goals and patient outcomes using appropriate measurement techniques to evaluate the effectiveness of the educational intervention. In 2019, 30 unduplicated patients were seen with 52 educational visits completed. * Oral Health- The hospital continues its goal to educate residents on the importance of fluoridated public water. In 2019, the hospital attended World Health Coalition meetings on a quarterly basis. The Committee continues to review statistics and ways to educate the community on the issue. Mental Health Implementation Activities: Goal: By March 2019, the Mental Health Task Force will redirect emergency medical service (EMS) frequent users to appropriate care and reduce all EMS overuse as evidenced by the development of pre-hospital treatment protocols and related collaborative multiprovider agreements supporting the implementation of Mobile Integrated Health Care or similar system management concepts. 2019 Strategies and Outcomes: * SRMC has employed Behavioral Health Nurses in the Emergency Department. When a patient with mental health related conditions is received, the BH Nurse does a crisis assessment to determine if the patient is safe to return to home and receive outpatient therapy or if the patient needs to be placed in an inpatient facility. If placement in inpatient facility is required, the Mercy Health Access Center arranges for placement and transportation. The collaborative will continue to investigate best practices in other similar communities to find a workable solution to the issues faced. * In 2019, SRMC hired 2 RNs with mental health crisis intervention training as well as established a Telepsych program in collaboration with St. Rita's Medical Center in Lima, Ohio to support patients. * SRMC established positions for social worker and case management to cover the ED 8 am - 11 pm 7 days a week with the balance of 9 hours covered on-call. The staff identify and addressing the needs of patients for support to navigate their needs, i.e., primary care, shelter, food, medication, and social service agencies in the community. * Case Management and Social workers have developed a directory of professional support for patient referral. * The ED manager meets monthly with the Clark County Mental Health Services director to maintain a connection for the 16-bed inpatient facility as well as outpatient support referral. There is a daily call to assess bed availability so patients who need transferred to an inpatient facility can remain local. * Community partners meet to discuss collaboration for the safest care of patients. I.e., previously the city jail brought suicide patients directly to the ED and after conferring with Mental Health Services (MHS) a process was put in place to have a direct connect between MHS and the Jail.

THE CHNA COMMITTEE MET REGULARLY VIA IN PERSON MEETINGS AND CONFERENCE CALLS TO PLAN AND EXECUTE PROJECT ACTIVITIES, VET PRELIMINARY FINDINGS, ADDRESS CHALLENGES, AND ENSURE THAT THE ASSESSMENT PROCESS WAS INCLUSIVE, COMPREHENSIVE, AND OBJECTIVE. DURING THIS PROCESS, SENIOR LEADERSHIP AND CLINICAL STAFF WERE ENGAGED TO HELP PRIORITIZE COMMUNITY HEALTH ISSUES AND PRIORITY POPULATION SEGMENTS FOR INCLUSION IN THE IMPLEMENTATION STRATEGY. THE ASSESSMENT BEGAN IN DECEMBER 2018 AND WAS CONDUCTED IN THREE PHASES, WHICH ALLOWED FOR THE COLLECTION OF AN EXTENSIVE AMOUNT OF QUANTITATIVE AND QUALITATIVE DATA (PHASE 1); ENGAGEMENT OF COMMUNITY RESIDENTS, KEY STAKEHOLDERS, AND SERVICE PROVIDERS (PHASE 2); AND ANALYSIS AND PRIORITIZATION OF FINDINGS FOR USE IN DEVELOPING A DATA-DRIVEN IMPLEMENTATION STRATEGY (PHASE 3). PHASE I ------- THE PRELIMINARY NEEDS ASSESSMENT AND ENGAGEMENT EFFORT RELIED ON SECONDARY DATA COLLECTED VIA LOCAL, STATE, AND NATIONAL SOURCES. THIS INFORMATION INCLUDED DATA ON THE POPULATION CHARACTERISTICS OF BERGEN COUNTY, INCLUDING DEMOGRAPHICS, SOCIAL DETERMINANTS OF HEALTH, HEALTH STATUS, AND MORBIDITY/MORTALITY. WHENEVER POSSIBLE, CONFIDENCE INTERVALS WERE ANALYZED TO TEST FOR STATISTICALLY SIGNIFICANT DIFFERENCES BETWEEN MUNICIPAL AND STATE OF NEW JERSEY DATA POINTS. A COMPREHENSIVE DATA BOOK IS INCLUDED IN APPENDIX B OF THE ORGANIZATIONS CHNA. IN THIS DATA BOOK, DATA POINTS ARE COLOR-CODED TO VISUALIZE WHICH MUNICIPAL-LEVEL DATA POINTS WERE SIGNIFICANTLY HIGHER OR LOWER COMPARED TO THE STATE OVERALL. RELATIVE TO MOST STATES, NEW JERSEY DOES AN EXCELLENT JOB AT MAKING COMPREHENSIVE DATA AVAILABLE AT THE STATE, COUNTY, AND MUNICIPAL LEVELS THROUGH AN INTERACTIVE PORTAL ACCESSIBLE VIA THE NEW JERSEY DEPARTMENT OF HEALTH (""NJ DOH"") WEBSITE. THE MOST SIGNIFICANT LIMITATION IN REGARDS TO QUANTITATIVE DATA WAS THE AVAILABILITY OF TIMELY DATA RELATED TO MORBIDITY, MORTALITY, AND SERVICE UTILIZATION. THE DATA SETS USED IN THIS REPORT ARE THE MOST UP-TO-DATE PROVIDED BY NJ DOH. THE DATA PROVIDED WAS VALUABLE AND ALLOWED FOR IDENTIFICATION OF HEALTH NEEDS RELATIVE TO THE STATE AND SPECIFIC COMMUNITIES. HOWEVER, THESE DATA SETS IN SOME CASES MAY NOT REFLECT RECENT TRENDS IN HEALTH STATISTICS. ADDITIONALLY, QUANTITATIVE DATA WAS NOT STRATIFIED BY AGE, RACE/ETHNICITY, INCOME, OR OTHER CHARACTERISTICS, WHICH LIMITED THE ABILITY TO IDENTIFY HEALTH DISPARITIES IN AN OBJECTIVE WAY. THE BERGEN COUNTY RANDOM HOUSEHOLD SURVEY AND THE TARGETED COMMUNITY ENGAGEMENT AND QUALITATIVE ASSESSMENT ACTIVITIES ALLOWED FOR EXPLORATION OF THESE ISSUES. KEY INFORMANT INTERVIEWS WERE CONDUCTED WITH APPROXIMATELY 80 COMMUNITY STAKEHOLDERS FROM THROUGHOUT BERGEN COUNTY. THESE INTERVIEWS CONFIRMED AND/OR REFINED THE FINDINGS FROM QUANTITATIVE DATA SOURCES AND PROVIDED VALUABLE INSIGHT ON COMMUNITY NEED, COMMUNITY HEALTH PRIORITIES, SEGMENTS OF THE POPULATION MOST AT-RISK, AND COMMUNITY HEALTH ASSETS. INDIVIDUAL INTERVIEWS WERE CONDUCTED BY PHONE USING A STRUCTURED INTERVIEW GUIDE DEVELOPED BY JOHN SNOW, INC. (JSI), A PUBLIC HEALTH RESEARCH AND CONSULTING FIRM, AND THE STEERING COMMITTEE. AT THE OUTSET, JSI WORKED WITH THE STEERING COMMITTEE TO IDENTIFY A REPRESENTATIVE LIST OF KEY INFORMANTS THAT COULD PROVIDE A DEEP AND BROAD PERSPECTIVE ON THE HEALTH-RELATED NEEDS OF THE COUNTY. THIS LIST INCLUDED ADMINISTRATIVE AND CLINICAL REPRESENTATIVES FROM EACH OF THE HOSPITALS AND BCDHS, AS WELL AS REPRESENTATIVES FROM ACROSS MANY SECTORS, INCLUDING HEALTH, PUBLIC HEALTH, SOCIAL SERVICE, ACADEMIC, AND BUSINESS. DETAILED NOTES WERE TAKEN FOR EACH INTERVIEW. DURING THIS PHASE, JSI STAFF WORKED WITH THE STEERING COMMITTEE TO DEVELOP A RESOURCE INVENTORY. THIS INVENTORY WAS MEANT TO INFORM WHAT SERVICES ARE AVAILABLE IN BERGEN COUNTY TO ADDRESS COMMUNITY NEEDS AS WELL AS TO DETERMINE THE EXTENT TO WHICH THERE ARE GAPS IN HEALTH-RELATED SERVICES. THE CHIP AND BCDHS STAFF SUPPORTED THIS EFFORT BY PROVIDING A LIST OF COMMUNITY PARTNERS AND KNOWN RESOURCES FROM ACROSS THE BROAD CONTINUUM OF SERVICES, INCLUDING CLINICAL HEALTH CARE SERVICES, COMMUNITY HEALTH AND SOCIAL SERVICES, AND PUBLIC HEALTH RESOURCES. THIS WAS DONE PRIMARILY BY COMPILING INFORMATION FROM EXISTING RESOURCE INVENTORIES AND PARTNER LISTS FROM THE CHIP, BCDHS, HOSPITALS, AND OTHER SERVICE PROVIDERS. PHASE II -------- PHASE II INCLUDED SEVERAL ACTIVITIES AIMED AT FURTHER ENGAGING COMMUNITY RESIDENTS AND STAKEHOLDERS INCLUDING SEGMENTS THAT ARE TYPICALLY HARD TO REACH. JSI CONDUCTED A MAIL-BASED BERGEN COUNTY RANDOM HOUSEHOLD SURVEY, WHICH CAPTURED INFORMATION DIRECTLY FROM COMMUNITY RESIDENTS ON HEALTH STATUS AND OVERALL WELL-BEING, SERVICE UTILIZATION, AND BARRIERS TO CARE. TO GENERATE THE SURVEY SAMPLE, A COMPREHENSIVE SURVEY WAS DISTRIBUTED TO MORE THAN 4,000 RANDOMLY IDENTIFIED HOUSEHOLDS IN THE COUNTY. THE INITIAL RANDOM SAMPLE OF 4,000 HOUSEHOLDS INCLUDED AN OVERSAMPLE OF COMMUNITIES WITH LARGE PROPORTIONS OF BLACK/AFRICAN AMERICAN, HISPANIC/LATINO, AND LOW-INCOME RESIDENTS TO ENSURE THAT ENOUGH SURVEYS WERE GENERATED FROM HOUSEHOLDS WITH OFTEN UNDER-REPRESENTED SEGMENTS OF THE POPULATION. IN ALL, 1,372 COMMUNITY RESIDENTS RESPONDED TO THE SURVEY, REPRESENTING A SURVEY RESPONSE RATE OF APPROXIMATELY 31%. FOCUS GROUPS WERE CONDUCTED WITH POPULATION SEGMENTS AND HEALTH/SOCIAL SERVICE PROVIDER GROUPS TO GATHER MORE PRECISE AND NUANCED INFORMATION ON THE NEEDS OF SPECIFIC SEGMENTS OF THE POPULATION OR FROM INDIVIDUALS WITH SPECIFIC EXPERTISE. FOCUS GROUPS WERE HELD AT LOCATIONS THAT WERE CONSIDERED SAFE AND ACCESSIBLE FOR PARTICIPANTS AND WERE FACILITATED IN APPROPRIATE LANGUAGES TO ENSURE FULL PARTICIPATION. JSI AND CO-FACILITATORS CONDUCTED ALL FOCUS GROUPS USING A GUIDE THAT WAS SIMILAR TO THE ONE USED FOR KEY INFORMANT INTERVIEWS TO ENSURE CONSISTENT DATA COLLECTION. JSI, THE CHIP, AND HOSPITAL PARTNERS WORKED WITH ORGANIZATIONS IN THE COUNTY TO PLAN THESE EVENTS AND IDENTIFY FOCUS GROUP PARTICIPANTS. JSI FACILITATED TWO COMMUNITY LISTENING SESSIONS, ONE IN RIDGEWOOD AND ONE IN ENGLEWOOD. THESE SESSIONS PROVIDED AN OPPORTUNITY FOR ANYONE WHO WAS INTERESTED TO PARTICIPATE AND ALLOWED FOR THE CAPTURE OF INFORMATION DIRECTLY FROM COMMUNITY RESIDENTS, STAFF FROM COMMUNITY-BASED ORGANIZATIONS, AND LOCAL SERVICE PROVIDERS. PARTICIPANTS WERE ASKED TO REACT TO PRELIMINARY DATA FINDINGS AND TO SHARE THOUGHTS ON COMMUNITY HEALTH NEEDS, BARRIERS TO CARE, VULNERABLE POPULATIONS, AND COMMUNITY ASSETS AND RESOURCES. BOTH SESSIONS WERE HELD IN LOCATIONS THAT WERE EASILY ACCESSIBLE, SAFE, AND WELL KNOWN. FINALLY, JSI WORKED WITH THE STEERING COMMITTEE TO DEVELOP A WEB-BASED BERGEN COUNTY COMMUNITY HEALTH PERCEPTIONS SURVEY TO SOLICIT ADDITIONAL INFORMATION DIRECTLY FROM COMMUNITY RESIDENTS. RESPONDENTS WERE ASKED TO PROVIDE THEIR OPINION AND PERCEPTIONS OF LEADING SOCIAL DETERMINANTS OF HEALTH AND BARRIERS TO CARE, CLINICAL HEALTH ISSUES, VULNERABLE POPULATIONS, ACCESS TO HEALTH CARE SERVICES, AND OPPORTUNITIES FOR THE HOSPITAL TO IMPROVE COMMUNITY HEALTH PROGRAMMING. SURVEYS WERE AVAILABLE ONLINE, THROUGH THE SURVEYGIZMO PLATFORM, IN MULTIPLE LANGUAGES. SURVEYS WERE ALSO MADE AVAILABLE IN HARD COPY FOR DISTRIBUTION; HARD-COPY SURVEYS WERE COLLECTED AND THE RESPONSES WERE INCLUDED IN THE FINAL ANALYSIS. THE CHIP, BCDHS, HOSPITALS, AND PUBLIC HEALTH PARTNERS WORKED IN CLOSE COLLABORATION WITH LOCAL COMMUNITY ORGANIZATIONS, BUSINESSES, AND STAKEHOLDERS TO DISTRIBUTE THE SURVEY TO COMMUNITY RESIDENTS, INCLUDING THOSE WHO ARE TYPICALLY HARD-TO-REACH (E.G. NON-ENGLISH SPEAKERS, DIVERSE POPULATIONS)."

202023149349304507,221487173,"SCHEDULE H, PART V, SECTION B, QUESTION 11","THE ORGANIZATION IS COMMITTED TO IMPROVING THE HEALTH STATUS AND WELL-BEING OF ALL RESIDENTS LIVING IN THEIR SERVICE AREA. CERTAINLY ALL GEOGRAPHIC, DEMOGRAPHIC, AND SOCIOECONOMIC SEGMENTS OF THE POPULATION FACE CHALLENGES THAT MAY IMPEDE THEIR ABILITY TO ACCESS CARE OR MAINTAIN GOOD HEALTH. REGARDLESS OF AGE, RACE/ETHNICITY, INCOME, FAMILY HISTORY, OR OTHER CHARACTERISTICS, EVERYONE IS IMPACTED IN SOME WAY BY HEALTH-RELATED DISPARITIES. WITH THIS IN MIND, ENGLEWOODS IMPLEMENTATION STRATEGY INCLUDES ACTIVITIES THAT WILL SUPPORT ALL RESIDENTS, ACROSS ALL SEGMENTS OF THE POPULATION. HOWEVER, BASED ON THE ASSESSMENTS QUANTITATIVE AND QUALITATIVE FINDINGS, THE IMPLEMENTATION STRATEGY WILL PRIORITIZE CERTAIN DEMOGRAPHIC AND SOCIO-ECONOMIC SEGMENTS OF THE POPULATION. THE ORGANIZATIONS IMPLEMENTATION STRATEGY WAS APPROVED BY THE BOARD OF TRUSTEES ON APRIL 23, 2020. THE IMPLEMENTATION STRATEGY IS THE RESULT OF BERGEN COUNTYS CHNA, CONDUCTED IN 2019. THROUGH THE CHNA, ENGLEWOOD HEALTH WAS ABLE TO IDENTIFY MULTIPLE COMMUNITY HEALTH PRIORITY AREAS. THESE AREAS WERE IDENTIFIED AFTER CONSIDERATION OF VARIOUS CRITERIA, INCLUDING SECONDARY DATA (COMPARISON OF BERGEN COUNTY DATA TO NEW JERSEY AND NATIONAL DATA); QUALITATIVE FINDINGS FROM SURVEYS, FOCUS GROUPS, COMMUNITY LISTENING SESSIONS, AND KEY INFORMANT INTERVIEWS; AND THE POTENTIAL HEALTH IMPACT WITHIN A PRIORITY AREA. BASED ON THE RESULTS FROM ITS CHNA, ENGLEWOOD HAS PRIORITIZED THE SIGNIFICANT NEEDS IDENTIFIED INTO THE FOLLOWING PRIORITY AREAS: 1) WELLNESS AND PREVENTION - GOOD NUTRITION IS MISSION CRITICAL FOR GOOD HEALTH. GOOD NUTRITION IS NOT PRACTICED FOR A RANGE OF REASONS, INCLUDING AWARENESS, ACCESS AND COST. AS A RESULT, WEIGHT-RELATED HEALTH ISSUES, INCLUDING OBESITY, ARE PERVASIVE AND CONTINUE TO CONTRIBUTE SIGNIFICANTLY TO THE SPREAD OF CHRONIC AND COMPLEX CONDITIONS (HEART DISEASE AND STROKE, CANCER, DIABETES). PHYSICAL FITNESS IS AN ESSENTIAL COMPONENT OF A HEALTHY LIFE. ACROSS ALL POPULATIONS, EXERCISE RATES ARE AT AN ALL-TIME RECORDED LOW. 2) CHRONIC AND COMPLEX CONDITIONS - CONDITIONS SUCH AS HEART DISEASE, CANCER AND DIABETES ARE THE LEADING CAUSES OF DEATH AND DISABILITY AMONG BERGEN COUNTY RESIDENTS. MORE THAN 50% OF U.S. ADULTS HAVE AT LEAST ONE CHRONIC CONDITION. THE NUTRITION CHALLENGES AND EMOTIONAL CHALLENGES OF INDIVIDUALS WHO ARE STRUGGLING WITH CHRONIC AND COMPLEX CONDITIONS SHOULD BE CONSIDERED AND ADDRESSED IN THE SUPPORT PROGRAMS AND CARE PLANS FOR THIS POPULATION. 3) BEHAVIORAL HEALTH - MENTAL HEALTH, ANXIETY, STRESS AND SUBSTANCE USE ARE IDENTIFIED AS LEADING HEALTH ISSUES IN OUR COUNTY. THE IMPACT CAN BE SEEN IN THE INCREASE OF DEPRESSION, MENTAL HEALTH CHALLENGES, AND RISE IN SUBSTANCE USE AND ADDICTION. THERE IS A GAP IN THE ABILITY TO ACCESS SUPPORT, COMPLICATED BY LACK OF ADEQUATE SUPPLY AND AFFORDABLE OPTIONS. 4) SOCIAL DETERMINANTS OF HEALTH (A) THE OVERALL PERCENTAGE OF HOUSEHOLDS WITH INSURANCE IS MISLEADING. VULNERABLE POPULATIONS HAVE FREQUENT ""LAPSES"" IN INSURANCE. LACK OF HEALTH INSURANCE HAS BEEN IDENTIFIED AS ONE OF THE LEADING BARRIERS TO HEALTH CARE; (B) NEARLY ONE THIRD OF BERGEN COUNTY RESIDENTS ARE FOREIGN BORN AND FACE LANGUAGE-RELATED CHALLENGES THAT IMPACT UNDERSTANDING, NAVIGATION AND ACCESS TO HEALTH CARE; (C) BERGEN COUNTY HAS THE SECOND HIGHEST POPULATION OF ADULTS OVER 65 IN NJ (16.4%). THIS GROUP COMMONLY FACES WELLNESS CHALLENGES (ISOLATION, INFLUENZA, PNEUMONIA, FALLS, ALZHEIMERS AND LACK OF END OF LIFE CARE DIRECTIVES); AND (D) NEARLY 20% OF ALL RESPONDENTS TO THE BERGEN COUNTY RANDOM HOUSEHOLD SURVEY REPORT THEY HAVE BEEN SOMEWHAT OR VERY WORRIED ABOUT FOOD RUNNING OUT SOMETIME IN THE PAST YEAR. PERCENTAGES WERE HIGHEST AMONG LOW INCOME (46.8%), HISPANIC/LATINO (42.2%), AND BLACK/AA (27.2%). ENGLEWOOD HEALTH IS COMMITTED TO ACHIEVING IMPROVED HEALTH THROUGH BETTER QUALITY CARE AT LOWER COSTS. TO ADDRESS THE NEEDS OF ITS COMMUNITY, ENGLEWOOD HEALTH IS ALLOCATING SIGNIFICANT RESOURCES TO ACHIEVE THE GOALS SET FORTH IN ITS IMPLEMENTATION STRATEGY. ENGLEWOOD HEALTHS POPULATION HEALTH DEPARTMENT, WHICH INCLUDES BOTH CLINICAL AND COMMUNITY SUPPORT SERVICES, WILL LEAD THIS EFFORT. ENGLEWOOD HEALTH IS DEDICATED TO BEING THE HEALTHCARE LEADER FOR OUR COMMUNITY.

BEING ONE OF 2 HOSPITALS IN THE STATE THAT TREAT CHILDREN UNDER 10, WE DEVELOPED A SEPARATE TREATMENT AND PROGRAMMING TRACK, INCLUDING CAPITAL INVESTMENTS IN A SENSORY ROOM AND REDESIGNED ACTIVITY SPACES AS WELL AS UPDATED TREATMENT MATERIALS. IN THE AREA OF AUTISM, CENTRA HAS A FREESTANDING RIVERMONT SCHOOL IN LYNCHBURG FOR CHILDREN WITH AUTISM.

In addition to the focus groups and interviews, paper and electronic surveys were administered using the following method: - Conducted in early 2019 - Distributed via email and in person - Collected 120 responses - Organizations throughout Miami-Dade County participated including: o Health Council of South Florida o Health Foundation of South Florida o Public Health Trust/Jackson Health System o South Florida Behavioral Health Network o Miami Dade County Grants Coordination o American Cancer Society o Sant La o Chamber of Commerce - Fort Lauderdale o Chamber of Commerce - South Florida Hispanic o Legal Services of Greater Miami o Susan G Komen o Ronald McDonald House o Florida Department of Health in Miami-Dade County o South Florida Hospital and Healthcare Association o Miami-Dade County AHEC o United Way of Miami-DadeThe survey captured information about perceived community health needs, areas of priority and opportunities for improving community health. UMHC also partnered with the Health Foundation of South Florida on developing the CHNA. The CHNA was provided publicly on its web site and had paper copies available for review for anyone who inquired. After the data was collected and analyzed, seven priority areas emerged that UMHC has included in its CHNA:1. Access to Care2. Availability of Primary Care and Prevention3. Cancer Prevention and Treatment4. Chronic Disease management5. Communicable Disease including HIV and STDs6. Health Lifestyles including Physical Activity and Nutrition7. Maternal and Child Health"

St. John's Hospital is committed to addressing community health needs in collaboration with local organizations and other area health care institutions. In response to the FY2015 CHNA, the hospital planned, implemented and evaluated strategies to address the top four identified community health needs: pediatric asthma, mental health, childhood obesity and access to care. The FY2018 assessment built on that collaboration, actively seeking input from a cross section of community stakeholders with the goal of reaching consensus on priorities to mutually focus human, material and financial resources. The external advisory committee was used as the primary stakeholder group to review and force rank data. During three meetings, community stakeholders were asked to review data presented and provide additional sources for priority areas not listed. The external advisory committee also helped develop the community survey tool and outcomes and recommendations on the final priorities. The external advisory committee also helped identify community assets and gaps which were weighed when considering the magnitude and feasibility of the priority areas. Lastly, their feedback was instrumental in developing the implementation plan. The University of Illinois Office of Survey Research (UIS SRO) circulated an electronic survey on behalf of the core group in January 2018. In total 1,079 individuals completed the survey. UIS SRO analyzed and provided the results to the external and internal advisory teams. The results were used to guide further discussion around final priority selection. Focus groups were conducted around the final priority areas selected and helped determine the implementation plan adopted by the board of directors. More information about the focus groups can be found in the implementation plan document HSHS and St. John's Hospital are committed to promoting and defending human dignity, caring for persons living in poverty and other vulnerable persons, promoting the common good and stewarding resources. We believe the CHNA process must be informed by input from the poor and vulnerable populations we seek to serve. To ensure the needs of these groups were adequately represented, we included representatives from the following organizations representing persons living in poverty, persons with disabilities, children, elderly, persons living in food deserts, and minority populations (a complete list is noted in Part V, Line 6b): Sangamon County Department of Public Health, United Way of Central Illinois, Springfield Urban League, Springfield School District 186, two federally qualified health centers, Catholic Charities, Memorial Behavioral Health, and Sangamon County Department of Community Resources. These organizations serve the under-resourced in our community, including low-income seniors, children living in poverty and families who struggle with shelter and food. Representatives of these organizations have extensive knowledge and quantifiable data regarding the needs of their service populations. Actively including these organizations in the CHNA process was critical to ensure that needs of the most vulnerable persons in our communities were addressed in the CHNA process."

Based on the Community Health Needs Assessment (CHNA) planning and development process described, the following community health needs were identified: 1. Access to care 2. Child maltreatment 3. Maternal and infant health 4. Substance Abuse - Drugs Access to care: Access to Care is broad and has many dimensions. In Sangamon County, there is a direct correlation between access barriers and ZIP codes ranked worst on the socio needs index. Existing data shows social determinants of health and health disparities lead to a higher incidence of emergency department visits and hospitalization of individuals in low-income neighborhoods. Actions to address Access to Care in response to the FY2015 CHNA have led to measurable improvement in health for residents in the Enos Park Neighborhood. Using the effective model in place, strategies will be adapted to meet the unique needs of additional neighborhoods in Springfield. By addressing access barriers in socio-economically disadvantaged neighborhoods, health outcomes will continue to improve. Goal: Build on the success of the Enos Park Access to Care Collaborative to enhance services in Enos Park and expand the Access to Care Collaborative to the Pillsbury Mills Neighborhood. Explore collaborative expansion to additional neighborhoods in Springfield, Illinois. Strategy 1: Continue Enos Park Access to Care Collaborative In FY2019, the hospital agreed to continue the collaboration with Memorial Medical Center (MMC) and SIU Center for Family Medicine to support ongoing efforts in Enos Park to improve access to health and health care. Collaboration with MMC and SIU continues in Enos Park. Managed Medicaid case managers were engaged to access resources through the Managed Care Organization (MCO) for our clients, which freed up a significant amount of car time for the Community Health Worker (CHW). Since the service is already reimbursed through Medicaid, we have increased capacity by accessing the service. This step also is helping our clients to become more self-sufficient as they now know where they can go to access transportation. Strategy 2: Expand the Access to Care Collaborative to Pillsbury Mills Neighborhood In FY2019, the hospital agreed to collaborate with Memorial Medical Center and SIU Center for Family Medicine to expand the Access to Care Collaborative to the Pillsbury Mills Neighborhood, and to explore expansion opportunities in other neighborhoods in Springfield, Illinois. Expansion into Pillsbury Mills was successfully completed in FY2019. At the time of the Schedule H filing, the year-one impact statement for Pillsbury Mills was not completed. However, a full time CHW is currently serving the new neighborhood including 42 clients: 22 adults and 25 children. The advisory group is comprised of the neighborhood association, neighborhood police officers, and several of Pillsbury Mill Neighborhood clients. Strategy 3: Expand Provider Council to include providers serving Pillsbury Mills The Provider Council has proven successful in providing education and training opportunities for social service and health providers serving the Enos Park Neighborhood. In FY2019, the council was expanded to include providers serving Pillsbury Mills and to create a synergistic approach to establishing referral networks and coordinated care of clients. The Provider Council has been expanded to include all neighborhoods in Springfield that have a CHW component, which includes the United Way funded CHW program on Springfield's eastside. By uniting all teams, we can also discuss complex cases and work together to identify resources and problem solve based on past experiences. Child maltreatment: In Sangamon County, we continue to see an increase in reported cases of child abuse and neglect. Currently one in five children is abused or neglected. The likelihood of poor health outcomes and risky behaviors for children who have experienced abuse and neglect increases significantly. Child maltreatment includes physical, sexual and emotional abuse; neglect; and the exploitation of children. Goal: Integrate screening tools for early identification and intervention of child abuse in the health care setting. Strategy 1: Trauma Informed Care The hospital will collaborate with existing partners to provide Trauma Informed Care educational sessions for key stakeholders across sectors. A trauma informed approach helps the stakeholder realize the widespread impact of trauma and understand potential paths for recovery through: Recognizing the signs and symptoms of trauma in individuals; Understanding the appropriate steps to engage providers in intervention; Fully integrating knowledge about trauma into policies, procedures and practices; and Actively resisting re-traumatization. In FY2019, the hospital hosted two Trauma Informed Care (TIC) trainings - one for social service providers and one for medical and clinical students through St. John's College of Nursing, SIU Med School, SIU-Edwardsville Pharmacy, Lincoln Land Community College CON and EMT. One hundred percent of participants reported an increased awareness of Adverse Childhood Experiences (ACEs). Interestingly, of the 150 medical students who attended the training, approximately 85% had never heard of ACEs or TIC. Strategy 2: Human Trafficking training for emergency providers. In the United States of America, Human Trafficking (HT) rose 35.7% from 2016 to 2017. Additionally, the Human Trafficking in Illinois Fact Sheet reports an estimated 25,000 women and children are being trafficked as prostitutes and 1,818 victims have been rescued since 2012. Calls to the national HT Hotline estimate Illinois ranks 10th for the number of reported cases of HT in the United States. The State Attorney's Human Trafficking Taskforce has identified three points in Central Illinois as 'hotspots' of human trafficking activity due to their proximity to Interstate 55, federally recognized as providing easier access to transporting of victims due to its proximity to the railway and intersection through numerous cities and international airports: Peoria, Illinois; Springfield, Illinois; and Litchfield, Illinois. The Human Trafficking of Person's report estimates that one third of all trafficked victims are children. The National Institutes of Health estimates that 33% of trafficking victims will seek care in a health care setting. The strategy is to train Emergency Department providers to identify and respond to suspected human trafficking victims; and adopt a plan to expand training across HSHS ministries in the Central Illinois Division. In FY2019, we finalized a training tool as well as protocol. A Human Trafficking specific policy was adopted in September 2019. The next step is to roll out the policy to HSHS ministries in the Central Illinois Division and launch provider training."
202011409349300726,370661238,"Schedule H, Part V, Section B, Line 11 Facility , 2","Facility , 2 - HSHS St. John's Hospital. Maternal and infant health: This priority will address maternal and infant health through a three-pronged approach: Focus on first time mothers; Focus on pre-term babies born 32 weeks in the NICU; and Focus on accidental infant asphyxiation. Goals: 1. To develop community-wide strategies to address accidental suffocation and strangulation of infants. 2. To utilize a home-visiting nurse to assist first-time moms and NICU infants and families to identify resources and provide timely care for healthier infants and moms. Strategy 1: Explore the issue of infant mortality, particularly accidental asphyxiation In Sangamon County, there were a total of 27 infant deaths reported in the first year of life. These deaths occurred in the home. Eighteen deaths were attributed to accidental asphyxiation. While the number of infants impacted does not represent a large percentage of total babies born, we feel there is education that can occur to better equip parents and guardians on infant safety post discharge. The hospital has identified and surveyed 25 organizations who provide education on safe sleep. We have also been working with the Sangamon County Coroner to collect recent data for the number of sleep related infant deaths. Three meetings were held with stakeholders to conduct an asset and gaps assessment and identify opportunities for improved messaging and delivery of messaging. In FY2020, we have scheduled focus groups with community members and providers to discuss safe sleep perceptions, messaging, and challenges. Recommendations for a campaign will be made in December 2019 and then reviewed by the hospital's Legal and Risk departments for approval. Implementation is currently projected for February/March 2020. Strategy 2: Beyond the NICU Beyond the NICU uses trained NICU nurses to support the vulnerable parents of premature children so that they can provide their at-risk babies with the best possible start in life. Since infant outcomes are closely tied to maternal health and well-being, this program will focus on assessing and improving maternal mental health and family preparedness. By June 30, 2019, 100 percent of our Beyond the NICU babies who were eligible for graduation, successfully completed and graduated from the program. Eligibility is determined by total number of months in the program. Eight babies who began in January 2018 successfully completed the program in June 2019. Strategy 3: Continue to Support Nurse-Family Partnership The Nurse-Family Partnership (NFP) is a national, evidence-based program that transforms the lives of families in the Springfield community. First-time moms are eligible for free help from a home-visiting nurse. The home-visiting nurses offer moms advice, support, and resources needed to have a healthy pregnancy, a healthy baby, and be a great mom. St. John's Hospital joined others in the community to provide monetary support to bring the NFP to Springfield. St. John's Hospital will continue to support the NFP program, led by SIU Center for Family Medicine, by committing a physician liaison to serve on the local NFP Community Advisory Board which provides advice and support on decisions affecting the implementation, program growth and sustainability of the local NFP. The hospital's NICU Chief Medical Officer represents HSHS St. John's Hospital and Children's Hospital including our NICU and Birth Center on the NFP Board. Substance Abuse - Drugs: Since 2014, fatal and non-fatal drug overdose has increased significantly in Sangamon County. While the recent trend has shown an increase in opioid and heroin use, officials report that the use of methamphetamine is on the rise. Emphasis is needed on both prevention and treatment moving forward. Goal: Work with community stakeholders to prevent opioid-related deaths and other non-fatal opioid overdoses through prevention, treatment and recovery, and response. Strategy 1: Sangamon County Opioid Task Force St. John's Hospital will identify a hospital liaison to serve on the Sangamon County Opioid Task Force (SCOT) led by the Sangamon County Department of Public Health. St. John's identified two hospital liaisons to serve on the Opioid Task Force. One colleague also serves on the education subcommittee of the task force. Strategy 2: Opioid Education Event St. John's Hospital will participate in the planning and implementation of an interprofessional opioid education event led by the St. John's College of Nursing. The event will provide education on care, treatment and management of patients with opioid use disorder. In FY2019, St. John's College of Nursing successfully provided interprofessional opioid education. A member of the hospital's community benefit team sat on the planning team and provided education on Adverse Childhood Experiences (ACEs) and Trauma Informed Care (TIC) including what are ACEs and TIC, what is a trauma brain, how do ACEs increase risk for substance use, and how to approach patients through a trauma informed lens. In FY2019, 150 students were educated, and 200 students were recently educated in September 2019 (FY2020). Needs Not Being Addressed: As an outcome of the prioritization process, the following community health needs were also identified and will not be addressed directly by the hospital for the reasons indicated: Asthma: The local county health department is the lead on asthma education and the treatment of affected community members. Additionally, a community roundtable has convened to address the need to identify and mitigate asthma triggers in inner-city and older homes. Education: The external and internal advisory committee members felt education could be wrapped into each of the final priority areas to raise awareness, educate and see positive change occur. Therefore, education was not selected as a standalone priority but will be included in strategies developed to meet identified needs. Food Access: Food Access is addressed by groups including the Central Illinois Food Bank, Illinois Coalition of Community Services, genHkids Coalition, COMPASS for Kids, local school districts and the county health department. The hospital supports these efforts by donating monetary and in-kind resources to their programs and organizations. Housing: In the past year, a group of community stakeholders have come together to address housing issues and disparities in Sangamon County. St. John's Hospital sits on that committee. This group is taking the lead on housing issues in the city and county. Mental Health: Memorial Behavioral Health takes the lead on Mental and Behavioral Health issues in the community. United Way of Central Illinois has also adopted a Mental Health strategy to its Health Vision Council priorities and funding process. The hospital will support these efforts by donating resources to various community strategies as appropriate. Violent Crime: The Access to Care collaborative developed in response to the 2015 CHNA has led to a decrease in crime in the Enos Park Neighborhood. By expanding the collaborative, we will continue to impact crime across the city and county. We will continue to support these initiatives and others through monetary and in-kind resources."

The Healthy York County Coalition (HYCC)- a local health coalition representing the diversity of the community- has led each of the seven CHNAs that have been conducted. For the 2018 CHNA, HYCC partnered with its sister health coalition in Adams County- Healthy Adams County- to form a CHNA Planning Committee comprised of representatives from health and human service agencies, government entities, community-based organizations, higher education institutions, and other interested community members to assist with survey development, data review and analysis, and results distribution. This core committee also assisted with sharing the data and association community health priorities, once identified by Coalition leadership, to community members at a public forum on June 7th, 2018. WellSpan- York Hospital is a funding partner and governance leader within Healthy York County Coalition and served on the CHNA Planning committee. In that regard, WellSpan- York Hospital partners to conduct the CHNA, disseminate its results both among hospital leadership and in the community, and integrates evidence-based strategies that impact identified community health needs into its annual planning process. Whether in meetings with community stakeholders or system/ hospital leaders or at larger public forum, WellSpan- York Hospital is committed to obtaining community input to ensure that the CHNA and its associated implementation strategies appropriately address the identified needs of the entire community.

In 2018, CHNA results and related priorities identified by Healthy York County Coalition were shared with the system-wide Planning Committee and WellSpan Health. This committee is comprised of community members and leader that represent each of WellSpans primary entities and service areas, in addition to corporate leadership. Planning Committee members reviewed the CHNA data and designated system-wide priorities as: Care for all, including a focus on access to care and health equity; Behavioral health and lifelong wellness, which would incorporate behavioral health, substance use and addiction and lifelong wellness, and; healthy communities and social determinants of health, which provide a deeper dive into community engagement, social determinants of health and violence prevention. Similarly, Healthy York County Coalition selected adult overweight and obesity, depression, and the social determinants of health as priorities- these priorities built on previously developed strategies that were a result of the 2015 CHNA and also encourage a deeper dive into the WellSpan system-wide, organizational priorities. The established Healthy York County Coalition and WellSpan specific priorities and associated data were presented to the WellSpan- York Hospital Board for their adoption. Additionally, the CHNA data was presented to multiple members of WellSpans leadership team. Healthy York County Coalition communicated the CHNA results and identified priorities to more than 100 community members at a public forum held on June 7, 2018. During that forum, community members discussed the opportunities and risk associated with each priority, as well as how the organization which they represent can have an impact on the priority. In addition to these venues, CHNA results are available on the Healthy York County Coalition (www.healthyyork.org) and WellSpan Health (www.wellspan.org) websites, and may also be obtained upon request.

THIS ISSUE WAS NOT ELEVATED TO A PRIORITY FOR THIS PARTICULAR PLAN BECAUSE THE INTENT WAS TO IDENTIFY ADDITIONAL STRATEGIES AND INITIATIVES THAT REACH ABOVE AND BEYOND CHI HEALTH'S TYPICAL BUSINESS. FOR EXAMPLE, CHI HEALTH HAS CONTINUED TO EXPAND ITS PORTFOLIO OF PRIMARY CARE ACCESS POINTS INCLUDING EXTENDED CLINIC HOURS, PRIORITY CARE SERVICES (WALK-IN CARE), QUICK CARE, VIRTUAL CARE, AND PARTNERING WITH MEDEXPRESS FOR URGENT CARE. ADDITIONAL PROGRAMS LIKE MD SAVE, WHICH ALLOWS PATIENTS TO PRE-PURCHASE CERTAIN SERVICES AT A DISCOUNTED PRICE, AND THE MEDICATION ACCESS PROGRAM (A PRESCRIPTION MEDICATION FINANCIAL ASSISTANCE PROGRAM), ARE WORKING TO LOWER THE COST OF CARE TO THE CONSUMER. IN ADDITION TO PROVIDING THE MAJORITY OF CARE TO THE UNINSURED AND UNDERINSURED IN THE OMAHA METRO AREA, CHI HEALTH WILL CONTINUE TO ADDRESS ACCESS TO HEALTHCARE SERVICES THROUGH FINANCIAL SUPPORT PROVIDED TO THE MAGIS CLINIC, HOPE MEDICAL, FEDERALLY QUALIFIED HEALTH CENTERS- CHARLES DREW AND ONE WORLD COMMUNITY HEALTH CENTER- AND THROUGH FREE HEALTH SCREENINGS AND IMMUNIZATION CLINICS IN THE COMMUNITY.CANCER: CHI HEALTH DID NOT PRIORITIZE CANCER AS A TOP HEALTH NEED IN ORDER TO FOCUS AND MEANINGFULLY IMPACT OTHER AREAS OF NEED. THE PRIORITIZED HEALTH NEEDS ABOVE REPRESENT A CONCERTED EFFORT TO FOCUS ON UPSTREAM EFFORTS THAT MAY IMPACT AN INDIVIDUAL'S CANCER RISK, PARTICULARLY LIFESTYLE FACTORS SUCH AS ALCOHOL AND SUBSTANCE ABUSE. CHI HEALTH WILL CONTINUE TO PERFORM EXISTING CANCER OUTREACH THROUGHOUT THE COMMUNITY AND FINANCIALLY SUPPORT COMMUNITY PARTNERS SUCH AS THE AMERICAN CANCER SOCIETY, THE NEBRASKA CANCER COALITION AND PROJECT PINK'D. ADDITIONALLY, CHI HEALTH CLINICS ARE WORKING TO INCREASE UTILIZATION OF HPV VACCINATION TO PREVENT CERVICAL CANCER.DEMENTIA AND ALZHEIMER'S DISEASES: THIS NEED WILL BE MET THROUGH THE BEHAVIORAL HEALTH PRIORITY, WHICH IDENTIFIES, ""PROVIDING SUPPORT FOR INDIVIDUALS WITH ALZHEIMER'S/ DEMENTIA AND THEIR CAREGIVERS"" AS A KEY ACTIVITY. IN ADDITION, CHI HEALTH IMMANUEL OPERATES AN INPATIENT AND OUTPATIENT GERIATRIC PSYCHIATRY PROGRAM AND RECENTLY OPENED A NEUROLOGICAL INSTITUTE. CHI HEALTH PROVIDES FINANCIAL SUPPORT TO THE NEBRASKA ALZHEIMER'S ASSOCIATION FOR FREE CARE CONSULTATION FOR FAMILIES WITH A LOVED ONE WHO HAS RECENTLY RECEIVED A DEMENTIA/ ALZHEIMER'S DIAGNOSIS.DIABETES: CHI HEALTH DID NOT PRIORITIZE DIABETES IN ORDER TO FOCUS AND MEANINGFULLY IMPACT OTHER AREAS OF NEED. CHI HEALTH WILL CONTINUE PERFORMING DIABETES OUTREACH AND EDUCATION ACROSS THE OMAHA METRO AREA, INCLUDING THROUGH THE INTEGRATION OF CERTIFIED DIABETES EDUCATORS INTO PRIMARY CARE CLINICS. SEE ALSO NUTRITION, PHYSICAL ACTIVITY & WEIGHT STATUS FOR RELATED ACTIVITIES.HEART DISEASE AND STROKE: WHILE THIS NEED WAS NOT PRIORITIZED SPECIFICALLY, THE FOCUS ON SUBSTANCE ABUSE THROUGH THE BEHAVIORAL HEALTH PRIORITY WILL HAVE AN IMPACT ON BEHAVIORAL RISK FACTORS FOR HEART DISEASE AND STROKE, SUCH AS ALCOHOL AND SUBSTANCE ABUSE. ADDITIONALLY, CHI HEALTH OFFERS PROGRAMMING DESIGNED TO MITIGATE RISK FACTORS FOR HEART DISEASE AND STROKE THROUGH HEART AND SOLE/ HEART FAILURE 101 AND OFFERING HEART HEALTHY COOKING CLASSES. CHI HEALTH IS A FINANCIAL SUPPORTER OF THE AMERICAN HEART ASSOCIATION.NUTRITION, PHYSICAL ACTIVITY AND WEIGHT: THIS NEED WILL BE ADDRESSED IN PART THROUGH THE FOOD ACCESS STRATEGY UNDER THE SOCIAL DETERMINANTS OF HEALTH PRIORITY. THERE IS SIGNIFICANT EXISTING WORK WITHIN CHI HEALTH AND THE COMMUNITY TO ADDRESS NUTRITION, PHYSICAL ACTIVITY AND WEIGHT STATUS, SUCH AS THE HEALTHY FAMILIES PROGRAM, 5-4-3-2-1 GO!, LIVE WELL OMAHA, AND FREE ""GET COOKING!"" CLASSES OFFERED AT CHI HEALTH LAKESIDE AND CHI HEALTH MIDLANDS.

LVHN IS REQUIRED TO PRODUCE A CHNA HEALTH PROFILE FOR EACH OF OUR LICENSED FACILITIES IN ORDER TO ADDRESS THE LOCAL CONTEXT OF THE DIFFERENT COMMUNITIES WE SERVE. THEREFORE, LVHN HAS PRODUCED FOUR CHNA HEALTH PROFILES FOR OUR FOUR DIFFERENT LEHIGH VALLEY HOSPITAL CAMPUSES: LEHIGH VALLEY HOSPITAL - CEDAR CREST, 17TH STREET, AND MUHLENBERG, LEHIGH VALLEY HOSPITAL - SCHUYLKILL, LEHIGH VALLEY HOSPITAL - HAZLETON, AND LEHIGH VALLEY HOSPITAL - POCONO.

THERE ARE MANY OTHER FACTORS THAT OCCUR OUTSIDE THE DOCTOR'S OFFICE AND HOSPITAL WALLS THAT INFLUENCE HEALTH BEYOND MEDICAL CARE. THEY INCLUDE:- SOCIAL AND ECONOMIC FACTORS, SUCH AS EDUCATION, EMPLOYMENT, AND SOCIAL SUPPORT- PHYSICAL ENVIRONMENT FACTORS, SUCH AS HOUSING, TRANSPORTATION, AND AIR QUALITY- HEALTH BEHAVIORS, SUCH AS SMOKING, DRINKING, DIET, AND EXERCISETHEREFORE, THE CHNA HEALTH PROFILE PROVIDES INFORMATION ABOUT HEALTH CARE AS WELL AS OTHER HEALTH FACTORS FOLLOWED BY HEALTH OUTCOMES. THERE ARE TWO TYPES OF DATA INCLUDED IN THE CHNA HEALTH PROFILES. THE FIRST TYPE IS QUANTITATIVE DATA, OR NUMBERS AND STATISTICS ABOUT THE OVERALL POPULATION IN THE COMMUNITY. THESE STATISTICS COME FROM A VARIETY OF LOCAL, STATE AND NATIONAL SOURCES INCLUDING THE CENSUS, THE CENTER FOR DISEASE CONTROL, THE DEPARTMENT OF EDUCATION, AND THE CENTERS FOR MEDICAID AND MEDICARE SERVICES. A MAJORITY OF THESE DATA POINTS ARE COMPILED TOGETHER THROUGH A PLATFORM CALLED THE CARES ENGAGEMENT NETWORK HEALTH PLAN TOOL, WHICH LVHN USES AS THE STARTING POINT FOR ITS CHNA HEALTH PROFILES, ADDING OTHER KEY STATE AND LOCAL DATA SOURCES TO THE DATA PROVIDED THROUGH THIS HEALTH REPORT.IN ADDITION, NON-PROFIT HOSPITAL SYSTEMS ARE REQUIRED TO OBTAIN INPUT FROM INDIVIDUALS WHO REPRESENT THE BROAD INTERESTS OF THE COMMUNITY, INCLUDING THOSE WITH PUBLIC HEALTH EXPERTISE AND THE VULNERABLE POPULATIONS. LVHN CHOSE TO OBTAIN THIS INPUT THROUGH FOCUS GROUPS AND INTERVIEWS WITH COMMUNITY MEMBERS AND LEADERS. THIS TYPE OF DATA IS REFERRED TO AS QUALITATIVE DATA.

THE TABLE SHOWS THAT THE HISPANIC POPULATION IS 3% OF THE TOTAL POPULATION, HIGHLIGHTING THE NEED FOR COMPREHENSIVE LANGUAGE SUPPORT AND CULTURAL AWARENESS ACROSS THE NETWORK. THE COMMUNITY MENTIONED THESE ISSUES MULTIPLE TIMES IN FOCUS GROUPS. LVHN LEADERSHIP AGREED, RANKING INCLUSION AND DIVERSITY RELATED ISSUES AS ONE THAT WOULD HAVE A MODERATE IMPACT ON OVERALL HEALTH, BUT IT ALIGNED WITH OVERALL ORGANIZATIONAL GOALS AND WAS AN INITIATIVE WE HAVE THE CAPACITY TO ADDRESS. LVHN WILL FOCUS ON TWO IMPORTANT STRATEGIES. FIRST, LVHN WILL INCREASE ACCESS TO LANGUAGE INTERPRETATION AT ALL HEALTH CARE SERVICE SITES, BUILDING ON THE ALREADY STRONG SET OF SERVICES AVAILABLE.

THIS NEW PATHWAY ALLOWED CERTIFIED STAFF TO CONVERSE WITH PATIENTS IN EITHER ENGLISH OR SPANISH TO FILL IN THE IDENTIFIED GAP IN SERVICES DURING THIS CRITICAL TIME. A TOTAL OF 39 EMPLOYEES TOOK THE ASSESSMENT ACROSS THE NETWORK WITH 32 OF THEM PASSING THE TEST. THIS WORK WILL NOW CONTINUE IN FY21, AND POST-COVID-19. WORLD LANGUAGES WILL BE AVAILABLE FOR LANGUAGE PROFICIENCY TESTING THROUGH AN EXTERNAL VENDOR IN FY21 SO STAFF CAN BE APPROVED AS PROFICIENT IN OTHER LANGUAGES AS WELL.CULTURAL AWARENESS AND STAFF EDUCATIONTHE CHIEF DIVERSITY, EQUITY AND INCLUSION LIAISON OFFERS A WIDE RANGE OF EDUCATION AND TRAINING FOR LVHN STAFF, RANGING FROM GENERAL CULTURAL AWARENESS COVERED AT ""CONNECTIONS"" (THE ORIENTATION PROGRAM FOR ALL NEW LVHN EMPLOYEES) TO INCLUSIVE LEADERSHIP, CULTURAL SENSITIVITY (GEARED TOWARD MULTIPLE SPECIALTIES), AND DIVERSITY. IN FY20, OVER 61 TRAININGS WERE HELD WITH JUST OVER 4,000 EMPLOYEES ATTENDING IN TOTAL. THERE WERE FOUR SESSIONS WITH NURSE RESIDENTS AND TWO SESSIONS FOR NURSE PRECEPTORS INCLUDING COLLEAGUES FROM LVH-LEHIGH VALLEY, LVH-HAZLETON, LVH-SCHUYLKILL AND LVH-POCONO. A HIGHLIGHT OF THE THIRD AND FOURTH QUARTERS OF FY20 WAS THE GRAND ROUNDS SESSION ON LGBTQ HEALTH THAT WAS DELIVERED BY THE PENNSYLVANIA SECRETARY OF HEALTH, RACHEL LEVINE, MD. MORE RECENTLY, THE LIAISON DELIVERED A PRESENTATION ON DISPARITIES AND COVID-19 FOR THE DEPARTMENT OF MEDICINE IN EARLY MAY 2020. CLINICIANS FROM ACROSS THE LVHN ENTERPRISE TOOK PART IN THIS VIRTUAL SESSION. THERE WAS ALSO A SITE-SPECIFIC SESSION ON LGBTQ HEALTH FOR THE SCHOOL OF NURSING FACULTY AT LVH-SCHUYLKILL. PRIORITY AREA: SOCIAL DETERMINANTS OF HEALTHSOCIAL DETERMINANTS OF HEALTH ARE AT THE HEART OF COMMUNITY HEALTH WORK AT LVHN. DURING THE PRIMARY DATA COLLECTION PROCESS, LVHN RECEIVED COMMUNITY FEEDBACK THAT CONFIRMED THE IMPORTANCE OF ADDRESSING SOCIAL DETERMINANTS BOTH DIRECTLY AND THROUGH PARTNERSHIPS WITH COMMUNITY ORGANIZATIONS. EXAMPLES OF SOCIAL DETERMINANTS THAT REQUIRE MULTIPLE AGENCIES AND ORGANIZATIONS WORKING TOGETHER IN A COORDINATED MANNER ARE HOUSING AND FOOD INSECURITY. BOTH WERE HIGHLIGHTED DURING COMMUNITY FOCUS GROUPS. IN ALL COUNTIES LVHN SERVES, AN AVERAGE OF 20% OF THE POPULATIONS ARE AT RISK FOR FOOD INSECURITY, AND AT LEAST A QUARTER OF THE POPULATION SPENDS MORE THAN 30% OF THEIR INCOME ON HOUSING.LVHN CHNA EXECUTIVE TEAMS RECOGNIZED THE MAGNITUDE OF HOUSING AND FOOD INSECURITY ISSUES, BUT ALSO WERE LESS CERTAIN ABOUT HEALTHCARE'S ABILITY TO HAVE AN IMPACT IN THIS AREA, PARTICULARLY BECAUSE THESE ARE NOT ISSUES THAT HEALTHCARE CAN ADDRESS ALONE. THE IMPORTANCE OF PARTNERSHIPS IN THIS AREA IS HIGHLIGHTED IN LVHN'S CHNA IMPLEMENTATION PLAN. BELOW ARE BOTH INTERNAL AND CROSS-SECTOR PARTNERSHIP EFFORTS ADDRESSING THESE ISSUES IN OUR COMMUNITIES.FOOD ACCESS THE FIRST STRATEGY TO ADDRESS SOCIAL DETERMINANTS OF HEALTH OUTLINED IN THE IMPLEMENTATION PLAN IS IMPROVE ACCESS TO HEALTHY FOOD AND REDUCE OBESITY RATES IN OUR COMMUNITIES, THROUGH IN-SCHOOL EDUCATION, PROMOTION OF HEALTHY LIFESTYLES AND COMMUNITIES, AND SUPPORT OF MOBILE MARKET FOOD DISTRIBUTION. THE WELLER CENTER PROVIDES IN-SCHOOL EDUCATION AROUND FOOD, NUTRITION, AND PHYSICAL ACTIVITY. FOR 38 YEARS, WELLER HEALTH EDUCATION HAS PARTNERED WITH SCHOOLS TO PROVIDE INTERACTIVE RESEARCH-BASED PROGRAMS THAT HELP PREVENT CHRONIC DISEASE AND IMPROVE CHILDREN'S OVERALL HEALTH, SAFETY, AND WELL-BEING. ACQUIRED BY LEHIGH VALLEY HEALTH NETWORK (LVHN) IN 2017. WELLER'S EDUCATORS TRAVEL TO SCHOOLS ACROSS LVHN'S SIX-COUNTY SERVICE AREA AND OUR PROGRAMS HAVE BECOME AN INTEGRAL PART OF MANY SCHOOL DISTRICTS' CURRICULA. BETWEEN SEPTEMBER 2019 AND MARCH 2020 BEFORE THE SCHOOLS CLOSED DUE TO COVID-19, WELLER SERVED OVER 27,000 STUDENTS FROM 72 SCHOOLS IN 25 SCHOOL DISTRICTS IN SIX COUNTIES. WITH THE GENEROUS SUPPORT OF THE CARL E. AND EMILY I. WELLER FOUNDATION, CORPORATE AND FOUNDATION FUNDERS, AND IN-KIND SUPPORT FROM THE LEHIGH VALLEY REILLY CHILDREN'S HOSPITAL, PROGRAMS WERE PRESENTED FREE TO SCHOOL DISTRICTS WHERE MORE THAN 50% OF THE STUDENTS ARE ECONOMICALLY DISADVANTAGED. NUTRITION AND EXERCISE ACCOUNTED FOR 6% OF THE PROGRAMMING PROVIDED IN THE SCHOOLS. LVH-SCHUYLKILL HAS PARTNERED WITH SCHUYLKILL COUNTY VISION ON THE HEALTHY SCHUYLKILL COMMUNITIES INITIATIVE, AN EFFORT TO PROMOTE NUTRITION AND EXERCISE, HEALTHY LIFESTYLE, AND ACCESS TO HEALTHY FOODS. SCHUYLKILL COUNTY VISION HAS SET UP 4 GARDENS THROUGHOUT THE COUNTY (SCHUYLKILL HAVEN, MAHANOY). IN ADDITION, BETWEEN JULY AND SEPT 2019 SCHUYLKILL COUNTY VISION HELD 8 COMMUNITY ENGAGEMENT EVENTS FOCUSED ON HEALTHY FOOD AND NUTRITION, REACHING 142 COMMUNITY MEMBERS. EXAMPLES OF THESE HEALTHY LIFESTYLE EVENTS INCLUDE SCHUYLKILL ON THE MOVE, MATTER OF BALANCE, AND SUMMER CAMP YOGA. DUE TO COVID-19, THESE EFFORTS COULD NOT CONTINUE DURING THE REMAINDER OF FY20. HOUSINGTHE SECOND STRATEGY TO ADDRESS SOCIAL DETERMINANTS OF HEALTH OUTLINED IN THE IMPLEMENTATION PLAN IS TO PARTNER WITH COMMUNITY ORGANIZATIONS TO MINIMIZE BARRIERS TO SAFE AND HEALTHY HOUSING AND DECREASE IMPACTS OF POVERTY, PARTICULARLY THROUGH COLLABORATION WITH PA LEGAL AID SERVICE ENTITIES.AT LVH-17TH STREET (LVH-LEHIGH VALLEY), NPLS@17TH STREET, THE MEDICAL LEGAL PARTNERSHIP BETWEEN LEHIGH VALLEY HEALTH NETWORK (LVHN) AND NORTH PENN LEGAL SERVICES (NPLS), WAS FIRST IMPLEMENTED IN AUGUST OF 2016. A FULL-TIME CIVIL LAW ATTORNEY AND PART-TIME PARALEGAL HAVE OFFICES AT LVH-17TH STREET CAMPUS TO ALLOW PATIENTS EASY ACCESS TO FREE LEGAL AID SERVICES IN THE SAME PLACE WHERE THEY RECEIVE OUTPATIENT HEALTHCARE SERVICES. THE PURPOSE OF THE PROGRAM IS TO ASSIST LOW-INCOME PATIENTS AND THEIR FAMILIES WITH IDENTIFIED LEGAL ISSUES THAT HAVE REAL OR POTENTIAL IMPACTS ON HEALTH. THE SERVICE AIMS TO IMPROVE THE QUALITY OF LIFE AMONG PATIENTS AND THEIR FAMILY BY ADDRESSING HOUSING STABILITY, FOOD INSECURITY, AND FINANCIAL AND SOCIAL SERVICE SUPPORT. THE AIM IS TO EXPAND THIS PARTNERSHIP TO THE OTHER COUNTIES LVHN SERVES, STARTING WITH SCHUYLKILL AND MONROE COUNTIES. MID-PENN LEGAL SERVICES IN SCHUYLKILL COUNTY AND NORTH PENN LEGAL SERVICES IN MONROE COUNTY PROVIDE FREE CIVIL LEGAL SERVICES TO THE LOCAL COMMUNITIES. STAFF EDUCATION AT LVH-POCONO AND LVH-SCHUYLKILL OCCURRED DURING FY20 TO ENSURE STAFF UNDERSTAND THE SERVICES PROVIDED BY THESE LEGAL SERVICE ENTITIES. LVHN WILL CONTINUE TO EXPLORE OPPORTUNITIES TO FORMALIZE PARTNERSHIPS TO ADDRESS THIS BARRIER TO HEALTH AND WELL-BEING AS IDENTIFIED BY OUR PATIENTS. PRIORITY AREA: BEHAVIORAL HEALTHONE CONSISTENT AREA OF NEED VOICED BY THE COMMUNITY, IN BOTH THE 2016 AND 2019 LVHN CHNAS, WAS THE NEED TO BETTER ADDRESS BEHAVIORAL HEALTH AND MENTAL WELL-BEING IN THE COMMUNITY. ACCORDING TO THE ROBERT WOOD JOHNSON FOUNDATION COUNTY HEALTH RANKINGS, MEMBERS OF THE COMMUNITY EXPERIENCE MORE THAN 4 ""UNHEALTHY"" MENTAL HEALTH DAYS PER MONTH, ECHOING THE DIRECT FEEDBACK FROM FOCUS GROUPS. THIS NEED WAS DISCUSSED IN ALL FIVE COUNTIES AND THEREFORE WAS MADE A CROSS-CUTTING PRIORITY AREA FOR THE IMPLEMENTATION PLAN. WITHIN THE BEHAVIORAL HEALTH PRIORITY AREA, THERE ARE 3 AREAS OF FOCUS: MENTAL HEALTH, SUBSTANCE ABUSE, AND SUICIDE PREVENTION. WHILE PUBLIC DATA AROUND SUBSTANCE USE DISORDER IS LACKING, IT WAS A CLEAR CONCERN EXPRESSED COMMUNITY MEMBERS WHO PARTICIPATED IN FOCUS GROUPS AND INTERVIEWS. LVHN LEADERSHIP BELIEVES THIS IS A HIGH IMPACT AREA OF WORK, BUT WE NEED TO INCREASE CAPACITY IN ORDER TO ADDRESS THESE NEEDS ADEQUATELY. THE SECTIONS BELOW OUTLINE THE APPROACHES BEING IMPLEMENTED IN EACH OF THESE FOCUS AREAS TO ADDRESS THE BEHAVIORAL HEALTH NEEDS OF THE COMMUNITIES LVHN SERVES."

IN ADDITION, LVHN WILL PARTICIPATE IN AND PARTNER AROUND COMMUNITY-BASED TRAUMA-INFORMED CARE COLLABORATIVE TO CREATE MORE TRAUMA-INFORMED COMMUNITIES. LVHN HAS MADE A CONCERTED EFFORT TO DEVELOP SUPPORTS FOR THE PREGNANT AND PARENTING POPULATION IN OUR REGION. IN THE LEHIGH VALLEY, THE CONNECTIONS CLINIC IS A PROGRAM FOR PREGNANT AND/OR POSTPARTUM SUBSTANCE USE DISORDER INCLUDING OPIOIDS AND IS A COLLABORATION BETWEEN OBSTETRICS AND PEDIATRICS (SEE SUBSTANCE ABUSE SECTION FOR ADDITIONAL DETAILS). IN FY20, THE LVH-SCHUYLKILL CAMPUS RECEIVED AND BEGAN IMPLEMENTING A PREGNANCY SUPPORT SERVICES GRANT. THROUGH THIS GRANT, THE LAKESIDE GLOBAL INSTITUTE TRAUMA 101 (OVERVIEW OF TRAUMA INFORMED CARE), 102 (BASIC SKILLS OF TRAUMA-INFORMED CARE), AND 103 (RECOGNIZING VICARIOUS & SECONDARY TRAUMA IN CAREGIVERS) TRAININGS WERE PROVIDED FOR LVHN EMPLOYEES WITHIN THE WOMEN AND CHILDREN'S SERVICE LINE AND WITH THE CONNECTIONS CLINIC. THESE TRAININGS WERE HELD OVER THE COURSE OF 3 CONSECUTIVE WEEKS DURING THE MONTH OF JUNE AND WERE ATTENDED BY 32 INDIVIDUALS WITH APPROXIMATELY 45% OF ATTENDEES COMPLETING ALL 3 SESSIONS. THE GRANT IS ALSO CREATING A SERVICE SIMILAR TO THE CONNECTION CLINIC FROM LVH-LV AT THE LVH-S CAMPUS, BUT SPECIFICALLY FOR OPIOID USE DISORDER. IT IS A COLLABORATION BETWEEN LVH-S MENTAL HEALTH SERVICES AND OBSTETRICS AND GYNECOLOGY. TO DATE, 45 WOMEN IN THE SCHUYLKILL AREA HAVE BEEN REFERRED FOR SERVICES AND 5 OF THEM HAVE BEEN ADMITTED TO DRUG AND ALCOHOL SERVICES. AS A PART OF THIS MODEL, LVH-S IS ALSO PROVIDING TELE-PSYCH SERVICES AT THE ST. CLAIR PRACTICE (SEE TELE-PSYCH SECTION BELOW).LVH-SCHUYLKILL IS ALSO PARTNERING WITH A COMMUNITY GROUP, SCHUYLKILL COUNTY VISION, WHO RECEIVED PENNSYLVANIA COMMISSION ON CRIME AND DELINQUENCY (PCCD) FUNDING TO CREATE A RESILIENCY CENTER IN SCHUYLKILL COUNTY, NOW CALLED FAMILIES GROW TOGETHER. IN NOVEMBER 2019, THE 2ND ANNUAL SCHUYLKILL TRAUMA DAY WAS HELD THAT PROVIDED A SERIES OF WORKSHOPS, ON TOPICS SUCH AS TRAUMA 101, STIGMA, SAFETY PLANNING (DOMESTIC VIOLENCE), AND VETERANS: COACHING INTO CARE (SUICIDE). SEVENTY-TWO (72) PEOPLE ATTENDED THE TRAUMA DAY AS WELL AS 19 VENDORS. THROUGH THE RESILIENCY CENTER, PROFESSIONALS IN SCHOOLS ARE TRAINED TO BE CERTIFIED TRAUMA COUNSELORS. ONE COUNSELOR FROM EACH DISTRICT IS IN THE PROCESS OF BECOME CERTIFIED AS A TRAUMA COMPETENT PROFESSIONAL. THEY ARE IN THE 2ND OF 3 PHASES OF THE CERTIFICATION. IT IS ANTICIPATED TRAINING WILL BE COMPLETED AT THE END OF 2020. ADDITIONAL TRAUMA TRAININGS WERE HELD IN SCHOOLS AND THROUGH THE INTERFAITH NETWORK THROUGHOUT FY20, REACHING A TOTAL OF 462 PEOPLE. SCHOOL TRAININGSJANUARY 2020: 2 TRAUMA 101 PROGRAMS IN THE BLUE MOUNTAIN SCHOOL DISTRICT 2 WITH 85 ATTENDEES FROM THE MIDDLE SCHOOL AND 65 ATTENDEES FROM THE HIGH SCHOOL (150 ATTENDEES TOTAL).JANUARY 2020: AN ACES AND TRAUMA TRAINING AT PENN STATE UNIVERSITY SCHUYLKILL WHICH 35 PEOPLE ATTENDED.MARCH 2020: TRAUMA 101 TRAINING FOR MAHANOY AREA SCHOOL DISTRICT WHICH 150 PEOPLE ATTENDED. INTERFAITH NETWORK TRAININGS HELD 2 TRAUMA 101 VIRTUAL TRAINING IN MAY (12 ATTENDEES) AND AUGUST 2020 (9 ATTENDEES), REACHING 21 INDIVIDUALS TOTAL. IN PARTNERSHIP WITH THE DEPARTMENT OF HEALTH OFFICE OF HEALTH EQUITY, A VIRTUAL TRAINING WAS HELD REGARDING STIGMA AND IMPLICIT AND EXPLICIT BIAS, WHICH REACHED 106 PEOPLE IN APRIL 2020. GIVEN CHANGES TO IN PERSON MEETINGS DUE TO COVID-19, AN ONLINE VIRTUAL TRAINING SERIES WAS HELD IN JULY 2020 THAT 92 PROFESSIONALS (E.G., TEACHERS, COUNSELORS, SOCIAL WORKERS) REGISTERED FOR AND WERE PROVIDED CEUS. THE TOPICS INCLUDED: EFFECTIVELY WORKING WITH SEXUAL OFFENDERS, WORKING WITH GENDER NON-CONFORMING AND TRANS INDIVIDUALS, AND VETERANS AND SUICIDE: COACHING INTO CARE.REFERRAL COORDINATIONTHE SECOND STRATEGY TO ADDRESS THE MENTAL HEALTH NEEDS OF THE COMMUNITY IS A CENTRALIZED REFERRAL PROCESS TO OUTPATIENT BEHAVIORAL HEALTH SERVICES. IN FY19, LVHN RECEIVED OVER 9,000 REFERRALS FOR BEHAVIORAL HEALTH SERVICES AND WERE ABLE TO SERVE 1 IN 8. IN ORDER TO IMPROVE TREATMENT AND REFERRAL WORKFLOWS FOR PATIENTS, LVHN CREATED A BEHAVIORAL HEALTH REFERRAL SPECIALIST ROLE. THIS ROLE PROVIDES SUPPORT TO PROVIDERS, PRACTICES AND PATIENTS SEEKING ACCESS TO MENTAL HEALTH AND/OR SUBSTANCE ABUSE SERVICES. SUPPORT BY THIS ROLE IS PROVIDED ON THREE LEVELS: 1. INFORMATION DISSEMINATION AND EDUCATION: PRACTICES RECEIVE RESOURCE INFORMATION TO ENABLE THEM TO MAKE BEHAVIORAL HEALTH AND SUBSTANCE ABUSE REFERRALS FROM THE BEHAVIORAL HEALTH RESOURCES SHAREPOINT DATABASE WITH INFORMATION THAT IS ALWAYS CURRENT AND ACCURATE. IN ADDITION, THE BEHAVIORAL HEALTH REFERRAL SPECIALIST HAS BEEN PROVIDING EDUCATION ON HOW TO EFFECTIVELY REFER A PATIENT FOR MENTAL HEALTH AND/OR SUBSTANCE ABUSE SERVICES TO THE FOLLOWING: PEDIATRIC PRIMARY CARE, ADULT SPECIALTY PROGRAMS, INPATIENT CASE MANAGEMENT, LVHN LEADERSHIP AND ADDITIONAL OUTSIDE PROGRAMS AND SERVICES.2. CONSULTATION TO PROVIDERS SEEKING SERVICES FOR THEIR PATIENTS WHEN THEY ARE UNABLE TO DO SO UTILIZING THE BEHAVIORAL HEALTH RESOURCES SHAREPOINT AND PAST REFERRAL EDUCATION. 3. DIRECT PATIENT CONTACT TO PROVIDE SUPPORT AND RESOURCES IF THE FIRST TWO LEVELS OF SERVICE FAIL TO SUPPORT THE PATIENT. IN FY19, THERE WERE 620 REQUESTS FOR ASSISTANCE FROM THE BEHAVIORAL HEALTH REFERRAL SPECIALIST. IN FY20, DUE TO THE HIGH DEMAND, A NEW PROCESS WAS IMPLEMENTED TO HAVE THE BEHAVIORAL HEALTH REFERRAL SPECIALIST MANAGE ALL OUTPATIENT PSYCHIATRY REFERRALS FOR LVHN AFFILIATED PRACTICES. THIS NEW PROCESS WAS MADE TO IMPROVE THE REFERRAL EXPERIENCE FOR THE AFFILIATED PRACTICE PROVIDERS WHILE BETTER ASSISTING PATIENTS WITH CONNECTING TO BEHAVIORAL HEALTH AND SUBSTANCE ABUSE SERVICES. THE BEHAVIORAL HEALTH SPECIALIST HAS BECOME A TEAM OF 5.5 FTE DEDICATED TO MANAGING ALL REFERRALS TO AMBULATORY PSYCHIATRY PRACTICES, WHICH IS NOW CALLED CENTRALIZED INTAKE. THIS SERVICE OFFICIALLY WENT LIVE ON MAY 4, 2020, AND THEY RECEIVE REFERRALS FROM OUTPATIENT PRACTICES FROM ALL LVHN CAMPUSES. IN THE FIRST 2 MONTHS OF FY20, CENTRALIZED INTAKE RECEIVED 1,220 REFERRALS. OF THE 1,220 REFERRALS, 489 (40%) WERE SCHEDULED WITH LVHN PSYCHIATRY PRACTICES OR PROVIDED WITH A LIST OF EXTERNAL PROVIDERS WITH THE OPTION TO CALL BACK FOR ADDITIONAL ASSISTANCE. BASED ON JULY 2020 REFERRALS, IT IS ANTICIPATED THAT OVER 9,000 REFERRALS WILL BE MADE TO CENTRALIZED INTAKE IN FY21.INNOVATIONTHE THIRD STRATEGY LVHN HAS COMMITTED TO IN ORDER TO ADDRESS THE MENTAL HEALTH NEEDS OF THE COMMUNITY IS INNOVATION THROUGH THE USE OF TECHNOLOGY TO PROVIDE TELE-PSYCHIATRY, TELE-THERAPY, AN APP DEPLOYMENT CALLED ECONSULTS. THE DEVELOPMENT AND IMPLEMENTATION OF TELE-PSYCHIATRY AND THERAPY SERVICES WAS UNDERWAY AT THE START OF FY20. WITH THE ONSET OF THE COVID-19 PANDEMIC, THE SCALE AND REACH OF THESE SERVICES INCREASED RAPIDLY AND DRAMATICALLY. IN FY20 THE DEPARTMENT OF PSYCHIATRY COMPLETED OVER 20,000 VIRTUAL VISITS, WHICH WAS WELL OVER THE ANTICIPATED 2,000 VISITS (LARGELY DURING THE FIRST SURGE OF COVID-19). IN ADDITION, TELE-CONSULTS WERE PROVIDED FOR PRIMARY CARE PROVIDERS. A RAPID OUTPATIENT CONSULTATION REFERRAL ORDER WAS ESTABLISHED TO FACILITATE A BRIEF PSYCHIATRIC INTERVENTION BY A PSYCHIATRIST OR APC WITH THE GOAL OF EVALUATING AND PROVIDING TREATMENT RECOMMENDATIONS WHICH MAY INCLUDE THE PRESCRIBING OF PSYCHOTROPIC MEDICATIONS, AND THEN RETURNING THE PATIENT BACK TO THEM FOR ON-GOING CARE. IN FY20, 80 TELE-PRIMARY CARE CONSULTS AND 208 ECONSULTS WERE COMPLETED AT LVH-LEHIGH VALLEY PRIMARILY, WITH SOME CONSULTS COMPLETED FOR LVH-SCHUYLKILL AND LVH-POCONO. AT LVH-SCHUYLKILL, THE SCHUYLKILL COUNSELLING CENTER WENT PARTIALLY VIRTUAL WITH PATIENT ENCOUNTERS OVER TELEPHONE, SOCIAL DISTANCING IN GROUPS, AND THE CURRENT DEPLOYMENT OF WEBEX FOR VIDEO GROUP TREATMENT IN THE INTENSIVE OUTPATIENT PROGRAM. A TOTAL OF 506 TELE-PSYCHIATRY VISITS WERE COMPLETED FOR PATIENTS AT LVH-SCHUYLKILL. THE SAME SERVICE WILL BE IMPLEMENTED AT LVH-HAZLETON IN FY21."

HOWEVER, THE TWO CAMPUSES HAVE BEEN CONDUCTING INDEPENDENT COMMUNITY HEALTH NEEDS ASSESSMENTS AND COMMUNITY HEALTH IMPROVEMENT PLANS OVER THEIR HISTORIES. BECAUSE THE TWO CAMPUSES ARE IN SEPARATE STATES AND THE SERVICE NEEDS BETWEEN THE TWO SERVICE AREAS ARE DIFFERENT, A DECISION WAS MADE TO CONTINUE TO CONDUCT SEPARATE CHNAS FOR THE TWO CAMPUSES.IN ADDITION, THE THREE-YEAR CYCLES OF THE TWO HOSPITAL ARE DIFFERENT. OLEAN GENERAL HOSPITAL APPROVED ITS MOST RECENT CHNA IN AUGUST, 2019. THE LATEST CHNA FOR THE BRADFORD REGIONAL MEDICAL CENTER CAMPUS WAS COMPLETED IN DECEMBER, 2018. CHNAS FOR BOTH HOSPITALS APPEAR ON THE RESPECTIVE WEBSITES FOR OLEAN GENERAL HOSPITAL (WWW.OGH.ORG) AND BRADFORD REGIONAL MEDICAL CENTER (WWW.BRMC.COM).OLEAN GENERAL HOSPITAL - THE 2019-2021 CATTARAUGUS COUNTY COMMUNITY SERVICE PLAN (CSP) AND COMMUNITY HEALTH ASSESSMENT AND COMMUNITY HEALTH IMPROVEMENT PLAN (CHA-CHIP) WERE DEVELOPED IN PARTNERSHIP BETWEEN OLEAN GENERAL HOSPITAL (OGH), WHICH IS PART OF UPPER ALLEGHENY HEALTH SYSTEM (UAHS) AND THE CATTARAUGUS COUNTY HEALTH DEPARTMENT (CCHD). STRATEGY SOLUTIONS, INC. (SSI) WAS ENGAGED BY CCHD AND OGH TO ASSIST WITH THE ASSESSMENT. REPRESENTATIVES FROM OGH AND CCHD WORKED COLLABORATIVELY TO GUIDE AND CONDUCT THE ASSESSMENT. A STEERING COMMITTEE MADE UP OF SENIOR LEADERS OF UAHS, OGH, CCHD, AND REPRESENTATIVES FROM THE CATTARAUGUS COUNTY HEALTHY LIVABLE COMMUNITIES CONSORTIUM, WHICH INCLUDES LEADING HEALTH AND SOCIAL SERVICE ORGANIZATIONS AND MUNICIPALITIES, PROVIDED ADDITIONAL INPUT. THE COMBINED EXPERTISE, INPUT AND KNOWLEDGE OF THE MEMBERS OF THE STEERING COMMITTEE WAS VITAL TO THE PROJECT. THIS GROUP DESERVES SPECIAL RECOGNITION FOR THEIR TIRELESS OVERSIGHT AND SUPPORT OF THE CSP/CHA-CHIP PROCESS. DURING THE CSP/CHA-CHIP PROJECT, TEN (10) STAKEHOLDERS WERE INTERVIEWED BY STRATEGY SOLUTIONS, INC. (SSI). SSI CONDUCTED A COMMUNITY HEALTH SURVEY WITH 669 SURVEYS COMPLETED, AND CCHD CONDUCTED A COMMUNITY HEALTH SURVEY WITH 227 SURVEYS COMPLETED. FINALLY, INFORMATION WAS GATHERED BY THE PROJECT TEAM THROUGH A SERIES OF TEN (10) FOCUS GROUPS WITH A TOTAL OF 56 PARTICIPANTS, INCLUDING A CROSS SECTOR OF COMMUNITY GROUPS. INFORMATION-GATHERING EFFORTS ALLOWED THE PROJECT TEAM AND STEERING COMMITTEE TO GAIN A BETTER UNDERSTANDING OF THE HEALTH STATUS, HEALTH CARE NEEDS, SERVICE GAPS, AND BARRIERS TO CARE FOR THOSE LIVING IN CATTARAUGUS COUNTY. FOLLOWING THE CONSOLIDATION OF DATA FOR THE COMMUNITY HEALTH ASSESSMENT (CHA), A PLANNING PROCESS WAS INITIATED TO CREATE A 2019-2021 COMMUNITY HEALTH IMPROVEMENT PLAN (CHIP). A TOTAL OF 28 PARTICIPANTS DESIGNATED AS THE CHIP PARTNERSHIP COMMITTEE FOCUSED ON THE TWO HEALTH PRIORITIES, WHICH WERE IDENTIFIED THROUGH A RIGOROUS COMMUNITY DATA ASSESSMENT STUDY AND DEVELOPED A GUIDE FOR IMPLEMENTING AN ACTION PLAN. A DISCUSSION OF EVIDENCED-BASED HEALTH RELATED PROGRAMS AND INITIATIVES THAT ARE CURRENTLY OFFERED OR ARE PLANNED FOR THE FUTURE WAS FACILITATED BY STRATEGY SOLUTIONS. BASED ON THIS DISCUSSION, A PLAN TO MEET THE COMMUNITY HEALTH NEEDS WAS DEVELOPED.THE 2019-2021 OLEAN GENERAL HOSPITAL COMMUNITY SERVICE PLAN (CSP) AND THE CATTARAUGUS COUNTY HEALTH DEPARTMENT'S COMMUNITY HEALTH ASSESSMENT AND COMMUNITY HEALTH IMPROVEMENT PLAN (CHA-CHIP) WERE CONDUCTED TO IDENTIFY SIGNIFICANT HEALTH NEEDS AS OUTLINED BY NEW YORK STATE DEPARTMENT OF HEALTH'S 2019-2024 PREVENTION AGENDA).

HSHS St. Elizabeth's Hospital completed a 10-month planning and implementation effort to develop the CHNA, identify and prioritize community health needs for its service area and formulate an implementation plan to guide ongoing population health initiatives with like-missioned partners and collaborators. The process and methods used to conduct the assessment required leveraging both internal and external individuals and groups. These planning and development activities included the following internal and external steps: HSHS St. Elizabeth's senior leadership engaged University of Illinois Survey Research Office, Springfield, Illinois, to provide quantitative and secondary data and community health data on the HSHS St. Elizabeth's service area. In addition, the team, along with members of the community benefits committee identified additional data sets to review and discuss. Additional data included the top 10 emergency department discharge diagnosis, the top 10 inpatient diagnosis and a review of two of the surveys that were conducted as part of the St. Clair County MAPP process (Mobilizing Action through Process and Partnerships). In addition, they took into consideration the information provided by the stakeholder community leader focus group. The team also reviewed the FY2015 CHNA. A core group of HSHS St. Elizabeth's colleagues provided valuable input for the FY2018 CHNA. This focus group discussed the data, shared insights from their perspective vantage points and identified their top three healthcare areas of focus. HSHS St. Elizabeth's Hospital also leveraged existing relationships that provided diverse input for a comprehensive review and analysis of community health needs in the hospital's service area. External components and steps included working in concert with the St. Clair County Health Department IPLAN process. In anticipation of the HSHS St. Elizabeth's CHNA, the hospital worked collaboratively with the St. Clair County Health Department as a partner to lead one aspect of the MAPP process. In addition, the hospital fully supported all aspects of the IPLAN development. St. Clair County hosted their annual Healthcare Policy Summit with keynote speaker Tyler Norris and a panel of regional health care leaders. The summit generated collective energy regarding the county health rankings and an unprecedented commitment by community leaders to get involved. This increased awareness by a broad section of the community offers great potential for further collaboration throughout the county. For the first time, two other local hospitals partnered with HSHS St. Elizabeth's to conduct a focus group on the perceptions of the health needs of St. Clair County residents from the perspective of community leaders. Community leaders were invited based on their awareness and expertise in the needs of our community. There was particular attention, roughly 30%, afforded to those who work with the underserved, low income, and minority populations. THE HOSPITAL'S FY2018 CHNA WAS CONDUCTED WITH THE FOLLOWING ORGANIZATIONS: ST.

We believe that the CHNA process must be informed by input from the poor and vulnerable populations we seek to serve. To ensure that the needs of these groups were adequately represented, we included representatives from Catholic Urban programs, St. Vincent DePaul East St. Louis, BEACON ministries, Karla Smith Foundation, St. Clair County 708 Mental Health Board, East Side Aligned, Programs and Services for Older Persons, and Age Smart. These organizations serve the under-resourced in our community, including low-income seniors, adults and children living in poverty, and persons with mental illness and substance abuse. Representatives of these organizations, who work 20 directly with their constituents, have extensive knowledge and quantifiable data regarding the needs of their service populations. Actively including these organizations in the CHNA process was critical to ensure that the needs of the most vulnerable persons in our communities were being shared and addressed in the CHNA process and development of related implementation strategies."

202131339349302383,370663567,"Schedule H, Part V, Section B, Line 11 Facility , 1","Facility , 1 - HSHS St. Elizabeth's Hospital. In FY2018, HSHS St. Elizabeth's Hospital conducted a CHNA. The hospital partnered with other agencies and hospitals and reviewed primary and secondary data. Then the internal work group gathered and based on the data and the prioritization process, the following priority community health needs were selected: 1. Mental Health and Substance Abuse 2. Nutrition 3. Infant Mortality The FY2018 Implementation Plan outlined the strategies that the hospital would undertake to address the priority community health needs identified through the CHNA process. Evaluation of the impact of the actions that were taken in response to the hospital's FY2018 CHNA is as follows. At this point it is important to note that HSHS St. Elizabeth's is a partner in the Healthier Together movement. As a long-standing member of the St Clair County Health Commission, the hospital is aware of the poor county health rankings and the associated difficulty to gain support and traction regarding both the severity of the situation and the capacity to develop sustainable solutions for incremental improvement. In 2017, key community leaders inspired by the collective impact principles resolved to adopt an ""All In"" approach to address the county health issues and work with members of the Commission, such as HSHS St. Elizabeth's Hospital, to prepare the Community Health Improvement Plan (CHIP) for St Clair County. This approach led to the formation of a grassroots movement known as Healthier Together. The Healthier Together movement is 100% volunteer driven and governed by an independent Council of Partners whose members include leaders in healthcare, business, faith, education, and local government and social agencies. The movement seeks to support the efforts of six work groups comprised of over 85 volunteers representing 45 service organization, dedicated to working together to improve the health and quality of life in the following areas: - Chronic Disease - Community Safety - Education - Maternal and Infant Death - Mental Health - Substance Abuse HSHS St. Elizabeth's priority health needs align with the Healthier Together movement and the hospital is actively engaged in several workgroups as we align our implementation plan with the county and work collectively with other organizations to meet our goals and the county goals. In FY2020, St. Elizabeth's Hospital joined other hospitals in St. Clair County to donate $75,000 toward the Healthier Together initiative. The Hospital also helped facilitate a site visit to explore launching a best practice Community Health Worker model in Washington Park, St. Clair County. The organizations involved in the CHW model have been engaged in assisting in the development of a similar model in our County. In FY2021, we will continue to develop this initiative. Mental Health and Substance Abuse Mental health and Substance abuse is not only a county health issue but a national epidemic. The following data supports the impact of mental health and substance abuse on St. Clair County. The internal work group who selected our top priorities believed that poverty plays a factor in substance abuse. Of the four counties comprising the St. Elizabeth service area, only St. Clair County, at 18.23%, has a poverty rate higher than the state rate. This indicator is revealed because poverty creates barriers to access including health services, nutritional food, and other necessities that contribute to poor health status. In addition, suicide rates in St. Clair Counties were all higher than the state rate and the percent of Medicare Beneficiaries diagnosed with depression in the St. Elizabeth service area was higher than the state rate. When considering substance abuse, compared to the statewide density, there is a higher ratio of bars and drinking establishments per 100,000 people in the St. Elizabeth service area than the state as a whole - 11% higher. However, the data suggests that there are fewer beer, wine, or liquor stores in St. Elizabeth's service area. When assessing the data as it relates to students, cigarettes, alcohol, and marijuana usage are higher in the 12th grade when compared to the state. FY2020 Outcomes HSHS St. Elizabeth's is actively involved in the both the mental health and the substance abuse work groups in Healthier Together. A colleague attends the meeting for Drug Free Alliance and the Suicide Preventions Partnership. Through a grant, HSHS St. Elizabeth's partnered with Gateway Foundation to assist patients with drug and alcohol addiction. The goal of this partnership is to assist individuals who are substance abusers with the opportunity for rehabilitation. Patients who present to the Emergency Department with a drug or alcohol diagnosis are offered the opportunity to meet with a counselor and arrange for rehabilitation services. Recognizing that patients are frequent utilizers of health care resources, the counselor will work to develop a relationship with the patient and follow-up with them. This partnership was initiated at the end of FY2019. In FY2020, this partnership was expanded to our MedSurge floors as well as our ambulatory facilities in the community. HSHS St. Elizabeth's is viewed as a safe haven for support groups. Naranon meets weekly in our facility with new members joining every few weeks. This group grew over the past year with new members joining monthly. Alanon began a support group at the hospital in FY2020. Nutrition Nutrition impacts multiple areas of health including diabetes, obesity, food insecurity, food accessibility, and impact of diet on other chronic diseases such as heart and cardiovascular disease. Food insecurity is an indicator that reports the estimated percentage of the total population and the population under age 18 that experienced food insecurity at some point during the year but are ineligible for State or Federal nutrition assistance. The rate of food insecurity in children in HSHS St. Elizabeth's service area was higher than the local counties. Other factors that indicate nutrition is a health priority, include a 3% higher population that receive supplement nutritional assistance program (SNAP), a higher obesity rate than the state average, a decrease in consumption of fresh fruits and vegetables, and 31% of the residents live in a census tract identified as food deserts. Secondary effects of poor nutrition are also evident. Residents of St. Clair County have statistically higher cholesterol, blood pressure, and diabetes. FY2020 Outcomes To address this issue, the Chronic Disease Work Group and the Education Work Group (two of the six work groups that are part of the collective impact, Healthier Together) collaborated to provide nutrition and healthy lifestyles curricula to the summer camp program serving 365 K-6th grade students. In addition to the three health needs selected as top priorities, internal work group along with community members identified one other significant health need in St. Clair County. While mental health and substance abuse were selected, the group felt that violent crime and poverty were very much intertwined with substance abuse and mental health. In addition, the priority need of nutrition provided an overarching focus that encompasses obesity, food availability, diabetes, and cardiovascular disease. Infant mortality was selected as a priority because it is considered a result of the other two health needs. HSHS St Elizabeth's will collaborate with multiple organizations to address these issues. The one priority health need that HSHS St Elizabeth's will not address and measure will be resources needed for the elderly. Several other organizations that participated in the CHNA process do address elder care needs. While this issue will not be addressed by the hospital as a priority health need, we will provide support for this community effort whenever possible."

Focus on health outreach and education Maryland Health Care Commission (MHCC) Rural Health Study During the 2016 Legislative Session, Senate Bill 707 Freestanding Medical Facilities- Certificate of Need, Rates and Definition (SB 707), passed into law and was signed by the Governor on May 10, 2016. The legislation established a workgroup on rural health care delivery to oversee a study of healthcare delivery in the Middle Shore region and to develop a plan for meeting the health care needs of the five counties -- Caroline, Dorchester, Kent, Queen Anne's and Talbot. The purpose of the study was to assess the health care of the residents of the five-county study area and the capacities of the health system in the region, and propose options for enhancing health and health care delivery on the Mid-Shore. The research team was asked to consider: (1) the limited availability of health care providers and services; (2) the special needs of vulnerable populations, including the frail and elderly, racial and ethnic minorities, immigrants and patients with persistent behavioral illnesses; (3) barriers to access caused by transportation limitations; and (4) the economic impact of closures, partial closures or conversions of health care facilities. The Summary Report provides highlights of findings from all components of the study and integrates them into key recommendations. Methods and findings are detailed for review at: http://mhcc.maryland.gov/mhcc/pages/home/workgroups/documents/rural_health/September%2025th%202017%20Meeting/lgsrpt_%20ExecutiveSummary_rpt_20170928.pdf The University of Maryland Medical System in partnership with UM Shore Regional Health as members of the Rural Health Care Delivery Workgroup produced a white paper, Commitment to Meeting the Health Care Needs of Our Vulnerable Rural Communities.

WEBINARS WERE HELD IN OCTOBER AND NOVEMBER 2017 TO ANNOUNCE THE ONSET OF THE CHNA AND ENCOURAGE BROAD PARTICIPATION ACROSS THE REGION. THROUGHOUT OCTOBER AND NOVEMBER 2017, A KEY INFORMANT SURVEY WAS SENT TO APPROXIMATELY 1,000 REPRESENTATIVES OF HEALTH AND HUMAN SERVICE ORGANIZATIONS, RELIGIOUS INSTITUTIONS, CIVIC ASSOCIATIONS, BUSINESSES, ELECTED OFFICIALS AND OTHER COMMUNITY REPRESENTATIVES. PARTNER FORUMS WERE HELD THROUGHOUT THE REGION IN JANUARY 2018 TO BRING TOGETHER THESE PARTNERS TO REVIEW RESEARCH FINDINGS AND PROVIDE FEEDBACK ON THE MOST PRESSING COMMUNITY HEALTH NEEDS. IN MARCH AND APRIL 2018, FOCUS GROUPS WITH SENIORS WERE HELD TO BETTER UNDERSTAND CHALLENGES AND OPPORTUNITIES TO IMPROVING HEALTH AMONG HIGH RISK POPULATIONS.

CHNA METHODOLOGY THE FY2019 CHNA WAS CONDUCTED FROM SEPTEMBER 2017 TO APRIL 2018 AND USED BOTH PRIMARY AND SECONDARY RESEARCH TO ILLUSTRATE AND COMPARE HEALTH TRENDS AND DISPARITIES ACROSS THE REGION. PRIMARY RESEARCH WAS USED TO SOLICIT INPUT FROM KEY COMMUNITY STAKEHOLDERS REPRESENTING THE BROAD INTERESTS OF THE COMMUNITY, INCLUDING EXPERTS IN PUBLIC HEALTH AND INDIVIDUALS REPRESENTING MEDICALLY UNDERSERVED, LOW-INCOME AND MINORITY POPULATIONS. FOCUS GROUPS AND INTERVIEWS WERE USED TO COLLECT IN-DEPTH INSIGHT FROM HEALTH CONSUMERS REPRESENTING MEDICALLY UNDERSERVED OR HIGH RISK POPULATIONS. EXISTING DATA SOURCES, INCLUDING PUBLIC HEALTH STATISTICS, DEMOGRAPHIC AND SOCIAL MEASURES, AND HEALTHCARE UTILIZATION, WERE COLLECTED AND ANALYZED TO IDENTIFY HEALTH TRENDS ACROSS HOSPITAL SERVICE AREAS.

202101369349302410,231352187,"FACILITY 1, GEISINGER-LEWISTOWN HOSPITAL - PART V, LINE 11","FIVE PRIORITY AREAS WERE IDENTIFIED WITHIN OUR CURRENT CHNA: ACCESS TO CARE, BEHAVIORAL HEALTH, CHRONIC DISEASE, MATERNAL/INFANT HEALTH, AND SENIOR HEALTH. IN ASSESSING THE HEALTH NEEDS OF THE COMMUNITY, GEISINGER AND ITS CHNA PARTNERS SOLICITED AND RECEIVED INPUT FROM PERSONS WHO REPRESENT THE BROAD INTERESTS OF THE COMMUNITIES SERVED BY EACH HOSPITAL, INCLUDING THOSE WITH EXPERTISE IN PUBLIC HEALTH, REPRESENTATIVES OF MEDICALLY UNDERSERVED, LOW INCOME, AND MINORITY POPULATIONS, AND OTHER COMMUNITY STAKEHOLDERS WHO BROUGHT WIDE PERSPECTIVES ON COMMUNITY HEALTH NEEDS, EXISTING COMMUNITY RESOURCES TO MEET THOSE NEEDS, AND GAPS IN THE CURRENT SERVICE DELIVERY SYSTEM. THROUGH FACILITATED DIALOGUE AND A SERIES OF CRITERIA-BASED VOTING EXERCISES, THE FOLLOWING HEALTH ISSUES WERE PRIORITIZED AS THE MOST SIGNIFICANT HEALTH NEEDS ACROSS THE REGION ON WHICH TO FOCUS HEALTH IMPROVEMENT EFFORTS OVER THE COMING THREE-YEAR CYCLE: ACCESS TO CARE, BEHAVIORAL HEALTH, AND CHRONIC DISEASE. PROGRAMMING AND CLINICAL SERVICES WITHIN THESE PRIORITY AREAS IMPACT THE POPULATIONS OF MATERNAL/INFANT HEALTH AND SENIOR HEALTH AND ARE THEREBY SERVED THROUGH ALL APPROPRIATE HEALTH IMPROVEMENT EFFORTS. BELOW ARE SYSTEMWIDE PROGRAMS OFFERED BY GEISINGER TO FULFILL COMMUNITY NEEDS THAT WERE IDENTIFIED IN THE HOSPITAL'S MOST RECENT CHNA. SOME PROGRAMS ARE COMPLETELY OPERATED OR FUNDED BY GEISINGER AND SOME ARE OFFERED IN COOPERATION WITH LOCAL HEALTH AND HUMAN SERVICE AGENCIES. FOR MORE SPECIFIC NEEDS FOUND IN OUR LOCAL COMMUNITIES, WE OFFER PROGRAMS TO SERVE PATIENTS CLOSE TO HOME. THE TOP THREE NEEDS IDENTIFIED IN THE MOST RECENT AND/OR PAST CHNA SURVEYS FALL INTO ONE OF THREE COMMUNITY NEED CATEGORIES: 1)IMPROVING ACCESS TO HEALTHCARE: THE MOST SIGNIFICANT NEED IDENTIFIED WAS FOR BETTER, FASTER, MORE CONVENIENT AND LESS COSTLY ACCESS TO HEALTHCARE SERVICES. GEISINGER IS TAKING INNOVATIVE STEPS TO ADDRESS BARRIERS TO HEALTHCARE BY: INCREASING THE NUMBER OF RESIDENTS WHO HAVE A REGULAR PRIMARY CARE PROVIDER, INCREASING ACCESS TO PRIMARY AND SPECIALTY CARE PROVIDERS PRACTICING WITHIN MEDICALLY UNDERSERVED AREAS (MUAS) OR HEALTH PROFESSIONAL SHORTAGE AREAS (HPSAS), REDUCING BARRIERS TO RECEIVING CARE FOR RESIDENTS WITHOUT TRANSPORTATION, PROMOTING AWARENESS OF OPTIONS FOR ASSISTANCE TO PAY FOR HEALTH CARE NEEDS, FOSTERING PURSUIT OF HEALTH CAREERS AND PROVIDING ONGOING TRAINING OF HEALTH PROFESSIONALS AND PROMOTING PARTNERSHIPS WITH SOCIAL SERVICE AGENCIES TO ADDRESS SOCIO- ECONOMIC NEED OF RESIDENTS. 2)ADDRESSING BEHAVIORAL HEALTH AND SUBSTANCE ABUSE: GEISINGER IS COMMITTED TO HELPING PATIENTS FIND HEALTHCARE SERVICES WHEN THEY ARE FACING BEHAVIORAL HEALTH CHALLENGES OR STRUGGLING WITH ADDICTION. WE ADVANCE DIALOGUE AT THE LOCAL AND STATE LEVEL TO ADDRESS BEHAVIORAL HEALTH NEEDS. WE FOSTER INTEGRATION OF BEHAVIOR AND PRIMARY HEALTH CARE. WE PROVIDE EDUCATION TO INCREASE RESIDENTS' AWARENESS OF BEHAVIORAL HEALTH ISSUES AND REDUCE THE STIGMA ASSOCIATED WITH BEHAVIORAL HEALTH CONDITIONS. AND WE STRIVE TO INCREASE ACCESS TO BEHAVIORAL HEALTH SERVICES. 3)MANAGING CHRONIC CONDITIONS: GEISINGER HAS NUMEROUS PROGRAMS TO HELP PATIENTS PREVENT AND MANAGE CHRONIC CONDITIONS. EFFORTS INCLUDE ENCOURAGING COMMUNITY INITIATIVES THAT SUPPORT ACCESS TO AND AVAILABILITY OF HEALTHY LIFESTYLE CHOICES AND INITIATING EARLY-STAGE INTERVENTIONS FOR INDIVIDUALS AT HIGH RISK FOR CHRONIC DISEASE. ACCESS TO CARE: MIFFLIN AND JUNIATA COUNTIES, PRIMARILY RURAL AREAS, HAVE HISTORICALLY SUFFERED FROM A SHORTAGE OF HEALTHCARE PROFESSIONALS. THIS SHORTAGE HAS FORCED RESIDENTS TO TRAVEL GREAT DISTANCES TO FIND CARE AND, ALL TOO FREQUENTLY, PUT OFF GETTING THE CARE THEY NEED UNTIL MINOR ISSUES HAVE BECOME HEALTH CONCERNS THAT CAN NO LONGER BE IGNORED. TO ADDRESS THIS ISSUE, GEISINGER HAS SUCCESSFULLY RECRUITED SEVERAL NEW PRIMARY CARE PHYSICIANS AND SEVERAL NEW ADVANCED PRACTITIONERS IN PRIMARY CARE OVER THE PAST YEAR. WE ALSO HAVE APPROVED FUNDING FOR THE CONSTRUCTION OF A NEW BUILDING IN THE REEDSVILLE COMMUNITY TO EXPAND ACCESS TO PRIMARY CARE IN THAT LOCATION. TELEPSYCHIATRY SERVICES WILL SOON BE GOING LIVE AT THE LEWISTOWN CLINIC AND WILL SERVE MIFFLIN AND JUNIATA COUNTIES (SEE MORE IN BEHAVIORAL HEALTH SECTION). OUR NEW LIFE GEISINGER CENTER IN LEWISTOWN GIVES NURSING-HOME-ELIGIBLE SENIORS A PLACE TO SPEND THEIR DAYS SO THEY CAN MAINTAIN THEIR INDEPENDENCE AND CONTINUE TO LIVE IN THEIR OWN HOMES. HEALTHCARE, WELLNESS ACTIVITIES, SOCIAL OPPORTUNITIES AND - THANKS TO A PARTNERSHIP WITH LOCAL AGENCIES - DOOR-TO-DOOR TRANSPORTATION ARE ALL PROVIDED BY THE PROGRAM. PARTNERSHIP WITH LOCAL AGENCIES, SUCH AS THE CALL A RIDE COALITION, ALSO ALLOWS PATIENTS TO BE APPROVED FOR SAME-DAY URGENT CARE TRANSPORTATION AND RIDES HOME FROM THE HOSPITAL AFTER DISCHARGE. HOURS HAVE BEEN EXPANDED TO COVER 8 A.M. THROUGH 6 P.M. WEEKDAYS, AND SATURDAY HOURS ARE ALSO AVAILABLE. BEHAVIORAL HEALTH: SIGNIFICANT PROGRESS HAS BEEN MADE IN THE PROVISION OF BEHAVIORAL HEALTH SERVICES IN THE WESTERN HUB SURROUNDING GEISINGER LEWISTOWN HOSPITAL. AN ADULT OUTPATIENT PSYCHIATRIST SPLITS TIME BETWEEN THE SCENERY PARK AND GRAY'S WOODS CLINICS TO SERVE THE ADULT POPULATION. A PEDIATRIC PSYCHOLOGIST AND A LICENSED CLINICAL SOCIAL WORKER SERVING THE ADULT POPULATION SUPPORT THE LEWISTOWN COMMUNITY MEDICINE CLINIC. A NEUROPSYCHOLOGIST IS BASED AT SCENERY PARK. ADULT PSYCHOLOGISTS SUPPORT PRIMARY CARE AT GRAY'S WOODS AND SCENERY PARK. A PEDIATRIC PSYCHOLOGIST IS ALSO IN PLACE AT GRAY'S WOODS PEDIATRIC CLINIC. TELEPSYCHIATRY SERVICES ARE PROVIDED TO PATIENTS AT SCENERY PARK TO SUPPLEMENT THE IN-PERSON PROVIDER. APPROVALS HAVE BEEN SECURED TO PROVIDE TELEPSYCHIATRY TO THE LEWISTOWN PRIMARY CARE CLINIC FOR ADULT AND PEDIATRIC POPULATIONS. PLANNING IS UNDERWAY TO PROVIDE ADDICTION MEDICINE SERVICES VIA TELEMEDICINE AS WELL. A PEDIATRIC PSYCHIATRIST JOINED THE GRAY'S WOODS PEDIATRIC TEAM JUNE 2020. WHILE WE HAVE NOT YET ESTABLISHED A CHRONIC PAIN SUPPORT GROUP, WE HAVE STARTED A PILOT INTERDISCIPLINARY PAIN CLINIC AT THE GEISINGER LEWISTOWN CLINIC. EACH MONTH, WE HAVE DEDICATED NEW PATIENT SLOTS FOR PRIMARY CARE PROVIDERS TO REFER CHRONIC PAIN PATIENTS TO THE INTERDISCIPLINARY CLINIC. HERE THEY SEE A TEAM CONSISTING OF AN INTERVENTIONAL PAIN SPECIALIST, A CLINICAL PHARMACIST, A BEHAVIORAL HEALTH SPECIALIST AND A PHYSICAL THERAPIST, ALL IN ONE VISIT, FOR INDIVIDUAL EVALUATION AFTER WHICH A PROVIDER TEAM MEETS TO DEVELOP AN INTERDISCIPLINARY PLAN OF CARE. THE PILOT IS BEING LED BY PAIN MEDICINE SPECIALIST TONIA NOVOSAT, MD, AND NURSE NAVIGATOR MELISSA GUSS. OUR PLAN IS TO EXPAND THE CLINIC TO AT LEAST A WEEKLY PRESENCE. CHRONIC DISEASE MANAGEMENT AND PREVENTION: OUR NEW FRESH FOOD FARMACY LOCATION IN LEWISTOWN HELPS FOOD-INSECURE FAMILIES MANAGE AND PREVENT DIABETES AND OTHER SERIOUS HEALTH ISSUES BY PROVIDING NUTRITIOUS FOOD, FREE OF CHARGE, ALONG WITH COUNSELING AND EDUCATION. THE PROGRAM PROVIDES HEALTH MEALS DAILY FOR UP TO FOUR FAMILY MEMBERS AND IS DESIGNED FOR ANYONE 18 YEARS OF AGE OR OLDER WHO HAS BEEN DIAGNOSED WITH TYPE 2 DIABETES, HAS AN HBA1C HIGHER THAN 8.0% AND FINDS PAYING FOR FOOD TO BE A SIGNIFICANT CHALLENGE. GEISINGER LEWISTOWN HOSPITAL HAS PARTICIPATED IN AND HOSTED NUMEROUS FREE COMMUNITY HEALTH FAIRS TARGETING DIVERSE POPULATIONS, INCLUDING THE MIFFLIN/JUNIATA GERIATRIC INTEREST GROUP (GIN) HEALTH FAIR, THE DOWNTOWN LEWISTOWN KID CONNECTION, THE MIFFLIN COUNTY SCIENCE AND TECHNOLOGY FAIR, THE MIFFLINTOWN FESTIVAL IN THE PARK AND THE MIFFLIN/JUNIATA AREA AGENCY ON AGING INC.

AMITA Health Saint Joseph Medical Center Joliet (AHSJMCJ) and members of the Will County Mobilizing through Action, Planning and Partnership (MAPP) Collaborative, a collaborative of the Will County Health Department, local hospitals and community partners, worked together over 16 months (May 2018-November 2019) to build a comprehensive 2019 Community Health Needs Assessment (CHNA) for Will County. Using the Mobilizing for Action through Planning and Partnerships (MAPP) model for the CHNA, Will County MAPP Collaborative have engaged diverse groups of community residents and stakeholders and gathered robust data from various perspectives about health status and health behaviors. These prioritized health needs were selected in coordination with community residents and stakeholders through dedicated workgroups, focus groups, and 1,688 community survey responses. IN 2018, THE WILL COUNTY MAPP COLLABORATIVE CONVENED TO CONDUCT THE FOURTH ITERATION OF THE MAPP PROCESS. MAPP IS A COMMUNITY-DRIVEN, STRATEGIC PLANNING FRAMEWORK THAT ASSISTS COMMUNITIES IN DEVELOPING AND IMPLEMENTING EFFORTS AROUND THE PRIORITIZATION OF PUBLIC HEALTH ISSUES AND THE IDENTIFICATION OF RESOURCES TO ADDRESS THEM, AS DEFINED BY THE 10 ESSENTIAL PUBLIC HEALTH SERVICES. THE MAPP PROCESS HAS SIX PHASES WHICH INCLUDE FOUR ASSESSMENTS. COMMUNITY HEALTH STATUS ASSESSMENT THE COMMUNITY HEALTH STATUS ASSESSMENT (CHSA) IS ONE OF FOUR ASSESSMENTS CONDUCTED AS A PART OF THE MAPP PROCESS. DURING THIS ASSESSMENT, INFORMATION REGARDING DEMOGRAPHICS, HEALTH STATUS, HEALTH BEHAVIORS, AND SOCIAL DETERMINANTS IN THE COMMUNITY IS GATHERED AND ANALYZED. DATA IS COLLECTED FROM A VARIETY OF RESOURCES AND ANALYZED COMPARING LOCAL, STATE, AND NATIONAL BENCHMARKS WHEN AVAILABLE. THE CHSA WAS CONDUCTED MAY 2018 - JANUARY 2019. COMMUNITY THEMES AND STRENGTHS ASSESSMENT THE COMMUNITY THEMES AND STRENGTHS ASSESSMENT (CTSA) AIMS TO GATHER COMMUNITY MEMBERS' PERCEPTIONS, THOUGHTS, OPINIONS, AND CONCERNS REGARDING QUALITY OF LIFE IN WILL COUNTY. THIS INPUT PROVIDES VALUABLE INSIGHT INTO THE ISSUES OF IMPORTANCE TO THE COMMUNITY. THE CTSA WAS CONDUCTED MARCH-AUGUST 2019. FORCES OF CHANGE ASSESSMENT THE FORCES OF CHANGE ASSESSMENT (FOCA) AIMS TO IDENTIFY ALL THE FORCES AND ASSOCIATED OPPORTUNITIES AND THREATS THAT CAN AFFECT, EITHER NOW OR IN THE FUTURE, THE LOCAL PUBLIC HEALTH SYSTEM. FORCES MAY BE SOCIAL, ECONOMIC, POLITICAL, TECHNOLOGICAL, ENVIRONMENTAL, SCIENTIFIC, LEGAL, AND/OR ETHICAL IN NATURE. FORCES CAN BE TRENDS, FACTORS, OR EVENTS. THE FOCA WAS CONDUCTED FEBRUARY-MAY 2019. LOCAL PUBLIC HEALTH SYSTEM ASSESSMENT THE LOCAL PUBLIC HEALTH SYSTEM ASSESSMENT (LPHSA) WAS HELD VIA ELECTRONIC SURVEY AND WAS CONDUCTED IN MAY 2019.. THE LPHSA IS USED TO UNDERSTAND THE OVERALL STRENGTHS AND WEAKNESSES OF THE PUBLIC HEALTH SYSTEM BASED ON THE 10 ESSENTIAL PUBLIC HEALTH SERVICES. THE WILL COUNTY MAPP COLLABORATIVE WAS FORMED FOLLOWING THE COMPLETION OF THE MAPP PROJECT IN 2011. THE SECOND ITERATION OF THE MAPP PROCESS BEGAN IN SEPTEMBER 2012 AND WAS COMPLETED IN MAY 2014. THE THIRD ROUND OF THE MAPP PROCESS BEGAN IN JANUARY 2016 AND THE FOURTH ROUND BEGAN IN 2018 FOR COMPLETION IN LATE 2019.

AMITA Health Saint Joseph Medical Center (SJMC) has developed an Implementation Strategy for the next three years that describes the programs we are undertaking to address these prioritized health needs in our community. Prioritized Health Needs The following prioritized health needs will be addressed in the 2021-2023 (fiscal year) implementation strategy FOR THE TAX YEAR 2019 CHNA: Behavioral Health and Substance Use Access to Health Care Access to Food & Nutrition Stabilization of the Built Environment This implementation strategy was approved by the Presence Health Suburban Network Board on October 29, 2020. The collective monitoring, reporting progress and revising will ensure the plan remains relevant and effective. Behavioral Health and Substance Use Strategy: Mental Health First Aid In response to a demonstrated system and state-wide need of addressing barriers to accessing and utilizing mental health services, AMITA Health Saint Joseph Medical Center Joliet and its community partners will continue to implement an evidence-based program, Mental Health First Aid (MHFA), to reduce the stigma associated with mental illness and improve the coordination of mental health care. MHFA trains community residents and first responders to recognize, respond, and seek assistance for signs of mental illness and substance abuse. Anticipated Impact: By June 2023, AMITA Health Saint Joseph Medical Center Joliet and its community partners will have trained an additional 200 persons in Mental Health First Aid. Strategy: Warm Hand-off Program with Family Guidance Centers In partnership with Family Guidance Center, a non-profit behavioral health organization, continue the Warm Handoff Program for those AMITA Health Saint Joseph Medical Center Joliet patients with an identified substance use disorder. Family Guidance Center provides a full-time Certified Alcohol and Drug Counselor (CADC) on site at SJMC to identify patients suffering with SUD that might be looking for treatment options. Family Guidance specializes in finding appropriate inpatient or intensive outpatient treatment for those individuals who are uninsured or underinsured. Through the initiation of this program in 2019, over 600 persons have been screened and nearly 58 persons have attended treatment. Anticipated Impact: By June 2023, 150 patients screened through this partnership will have attended treatment (inpatient or outpatient) with Family Guidance Center or another SUD provider. Access to Health Care Strategy: Partnership with Will-Grundy Medical Clinic and Aunt Martha's Health & Wellness (FQHC) In order to increase and secure access to primary health care for those uninsured and underinsured, AMITA has partnered with Aunt Martha's to ensure patients are assigned a medical home for post discharge care. In collaboration, Aunt Martha's provided on-site coordinators and phone liaisons to AMITA Health Saint Joseph Medical Center, to round in the emergency department as well as on inpatient units to coordinate primary care visits for patients and sign patients up for Medicaid services or insurance on the federal exchanges. Additionally, AMITA Health provides clinic space within the Medical Center campus for Aunt Martha's at a rental fee of only $1 per year to ensure ease of access and the provision of quality health care for the low-income community. This location has over 9,500 visits in FY19 including over 4,600 unique patient visits. AMITA Health Saint Joseph Medical Center Joliet will continue to support and provide in-kind surgical and ancillary care for patients registered with the Will-Grundy Medical Clinic. The Clinic annually serves over 800 persons, who are the most economically vulnerable in our community and are not eligible for government assistance. Anticipated Impact: By June 2023, over 50% of AHSJMCJ patients scheduled for post-discharge appointments with Aunt Martha's Health & Wellness will keep their appointments. Access to Food and Nutrition Strategy: Rx Mobile Food Pantries & Micro Pantry In collaboration with Northern Illinois Food Bank (NIFB), continue the provisioning of the Rx Mobile Food Pantries and other food interventions in high need areas within the SJMC community. Work with community partner organizations to help promote the availability of and locations of the pantries. Continue to refer patients from the outpatient dietician and diabetes center to track health outcomes related to obtaining healthy foods. On average, each pantry truck serves 220 individuals with free healthy food options that they would normally not obtain on their limited incomes. Additionally, continue to support and stock the Micro Pantry on the SJMC campus, which provides 24/7 access to emergency food. A stocked pantry provides an average of 90 meals per day to those in need. Anticipated Impact: Through June 2023, a monthly average of 220 persons will be provided with free healthy food options through the Rx Mobile Food Pantry and other food interventions conducted by AHSJMCJ. Stabilizing the Built Environment Strategy: Health & Housing Collaboration Using established models of health and housing collaboration, work with the local Continuum of Care, the lead agency within a geographical area that coordinates homeless prevention and services, and other key community agencies to develop a multi agency collaborative. Support the strategic planning of the local Continuum of Care to ensure homeless persons health factors and interactions within the local public health system are prioritized. Anticipated Impact: By June 2023, in partnership with the Continuum of Care, establish a Health & Housing Collaborative to increase care coordination of the homeless population in Will County. Summary of Progress FY20: In FY20, the following indicates the progress made on programming conducted to address the identified health needs of the hospital from the 2017 & 2019 CHNA findings, as the 2019 CHNA was approved during this the FY20 fiscal year. In addition to the strategic initiatives below, each hospital provided many additional health education initiatives, health focused events, in-kind services and cash donations to support and respond to the needs of the community. Prioritized Health Need: Preventing Chronic Diseases: Food Access SJMC continued to host its 24/7 emergency food pantry, a micro pantry, on its campus in FY20. Associate time was spent organizing, coordinating donations, and restocking the micro pantry that provides approximately 90 [IME1] meals per day. In FY2020, a new program, Rx Mobile Food Pantry, was initiated in partnership with Northern Illinois Food Bank to bring an on-site mobile food pantry truck to the hospital campus twice per month to provide free produce, meat and dairy. This initiative provided food to over 8,200 persons from July 2019-June 2020. Prioritized Health Need: Access to Dental & Health Care Through a commitment throughout AMITA Health, SJMC associates utilized the social determinant of health software, Aunt Bertha, to connect and refer patients to local resources such as food pantry, health clinics, utilities support and more. This systemic software is utilized at the patient's bedside as social needs arise that affect their health. Additionally, AMITA Health hosts Aunt Bertha on our external consumer website for community members to search for their own resources. In FY20, additional community partners were added to the resource portal and additional associates were trained on the platform. SJMC continued to provide in-kind clinic space to Aunt Martha's Health & Wellness, a federally qualified health center to ensure ease of access and the provision of quality health care for the low-income community. This location had over 9,500 visits in FY20 including over 4,600 unique patient visits. Additionally, SJMC and Aunt Martha's leadership meet to provide care coordination. In FY20, SJMC continued to support and provide in-kind surgical and ancillary care for patients registered with the Will-Grundy Medical Clinic. This free clinic serves over 800 persons annually, who are the most economically vulnerable in the community and are not eligible for government assistance. Prioritized Health Need: Behavioral Health In FY20, SJMC began a warm hand-off program in partnership with Family Guidance Centers. Through this effort, over 600 persons were screened and 58 persons attended treatment. AMITA Health has committed to providing free mental health first aid training and workshops in all our hospital communities. In FY20, SJMC provided training to 11 persons. Due to the COVID-19 pandemic, additional in-person trainings were put on hold."

THIS PROCESS IS KNOWN AS ILLINOIS PROJECT FOR LOCAL ASSESSMENT OF NEED, (IPLAN). HOSPITALS ARE REQUIRED BY THE IRS TO COMPLETE A CHNA EVERY THREE YEARS. FOR THE 2018 ASSESSMENT AND PLANNING PROCESS, THE PARTNERSHIP FOR A HEALTHY COMMUNITY USED THE MOBILIZING FOR ACTION THROUGH PLANNING AND PARTNERSHIPS (MAPP) PROCESS AS AN EQUIVALENT FOR IPLAN. THE KANKAKEE COUNTY HEALTH DEPARTMENT AND AMITA HEALTH SAINT MARY'S HOSPITAL PARTNERED TO FACILITATE THE MAPP PROCESS IN 2012 AND AGAIN IN 2015 AND 2018. FROM FEBRUARY 2017 THROUGH MARCH 2018 FOUR SEPARATE ASSESSMENTS WERE CONDUCTED. MAPP IS A PROCESS THAT PROVIDES A COMPREHENSIVE FRAMEWORK FOR ASSESSING COMMUNITY NEEDS, AND DEVELOPING AND ADDRESSING STRATEGIC ISSUES. THE PURPOSE OF THE KANKAKEE COUNTY MAPP PROCESS IS TO PROVIDE A COMMUNITY PLAN THAT IS DEVELOPED BY AND FOR THE COMMUNITY. THE BENEFITS OF KANKAKEE COUNTY ENGAGING IN THIS PROCESS INCLUDE: -A HEALTHIER COMMUNITY THAT IMPROVES THE QUALITY OF LIFE FOR THE PEOPLE WHO LIVE AND WORK IN IT. -INCREASED VISIBILITY OF PUBLIC HEALTH IN THE COMMUNITY. -INCREASED AWARENESS AND KNOWLEDGE ABOUT PUBLIC HEALTH ISSUES. -PREPARATION OF OUR LOCAL PUBLIC HEALTH SYSTEM TO BETTER ANTICIPATE, MANAGE AND RESPOND TO CHANGES IN THE COUNTY. -GREATER COLLABORATION AND SHARING OF RESOURCES AMONG PARTNERS. -REFLECTION OF PRIORITIES IN HOSPITAL IMPLEMENTATION STRATEGIES. MAPP HAS SIX PHASES. THE FIRST FIVE PHASES WERE COMPLETED OVER TWENTY-TWO MONTHS. PHASE SIX, THE ACTION CYCLE, IS AN ONGOING PROCESS OF PLANNING, IMPLEMENTING AND EVALUATING. KANKAKEE COUNTY IS CURRENTLY IN PHASE SIX OF THE PROCESS."

The Healthy York County Coalition (HYCC)- a local health coalition representing the diversity of the community- has led each of the seven CHNAs that have been conducted. For the 2018 CHNA, HYCC partnered with its sister health coalition in Adams County- Healthy Adams County- to form a CHNA Planning Committee comprised of representatives from health and human service agencies, government entities, community-based organizations, higher education institutions, and other interested community members to assist with survey development, data review and analysis, and results distribution. This core committee also assisted with sharing the data and association community health priorities, once identified by Coalition leadership, to community members at a public forum on June 7th, 2018. WellSpan- York Hospital is a funding partner and governance leader within Healthy York County Coalition and served on the CHNA Planning committee. In that regard, WellSpan- York Hospital partners to conduct the CHNA, disseminate its results both among hospital leadership and in the community, and integrates evidence-based strategies that impact identified community health needs into its annual planning process.

In 2018, CHNA results and related priorities identified by Healthy York County Coalition were shared with the system-wide Planning Committee and WellSpan Health. This committee is comprised of community members and leaders that represent each of WellSpans primary entities and service areas, in addition to corporate leadership. Planning Committee members reviewed the CHNA data and designated system-wide priorities as: Care for all, including a focus on access to care and health equity; Behavioral health and lifelong wellness, which would incorporate behavioral health, substance use and addiction and lifelong wellness, and; healthy communities and social determinants of health, which provide a deeper dive into community engagement, social determinants of health and violence prevention. Similarly, Healthy York County Coalition selected adult overweight and obesity, depression, and the social determinants of health as priorities- these priorities built on previously developed strategies that were a result of the 2015 CHNA and also encourage a deeper dive into the WellSpan system-wide, organizational priorities. The established Healthy York County Coalition and WellSpan specific priorities and associated data were presented to the WellSpan- York Hospital Board for their adoption.

The University of Maryland Medical Center Midtown Campus (UMMC Midtown) utilized two major frameworks for completing its most recent Community Health Needs Assessment (CHNA) in fiscal year 2018. To complete this comprehensive assessment of the needs of the community, the Association for Community Health Improvement's (ACHI) 9-step Community Health Assessment Process was utilized as an organizing methodology. An additional 5-component assessment and engagement strategy was also utilized to lead the data collection methodology. The UMMC Community Health Improvement Team (CHI Team) included both the Downtown and Midtown Campuses and served as the lead team to conduct the CHNA with input from other University of Maryland Medical System Baltimore City-based hospitals, community leaders, the academic community, the public, health experts, and the Baltimore City Health Department. Data was collected from multiple sources, groups, and individuals and integrated into a comprehensive document which was utilized at a retreat on January 22, 2018 of the UMMC Downtown/Midtown Campuses' Community Health Improvement (CHI) Team. During that strategic planning retreat, priorities were identified using the collected data and an adapted version of the Catholic Health Association's (CHA) priority setting criteria. The identified priorities were also validated by a panel of UM Clinical Advisors and University of Maryland Baltimore (UMB) Campus experts. UMMC Midtown used primary and secondary sources of data as well as quantitative and qualitative data and consulted with numerous individuals and organizations during the CHNA, including other University of Maryland Medical System (UMMS) Baltimore City-based hospitals (University of Maryland Medical Center Downtown Campus, University of Maryland Rehabilitation and Orthopedic Institute, community leaders, community partners, the University of Maryland Baltimore (UMB) academic community, the general public, local health experts, and the Baltimore City Health Department. Additionally, for the first time in the city's history, nine Baltimore City hospitals joined together in fiscal year 2018 to collaborate on several key data collection strategies for a joint community health needs assessment. UMMC Midtown partnered with the University of Maryland Medical Center Downtown Campus, University of Maryland Rehabilitation & Orthopedic Institutes, Johns Hopkins Hospital, Sinai Hospital (Lifebridge), Medstar Health, St. Agnes Health System, and Mercy Medical Center. The above hospitals/health systems had been collaborating on several initiatives prior to the CHNA year and agreed that it would be beneficial to work on a more detailed level on a joint city-wide CHNA. This multi-hospital collaborative worked on the following data collection components together: - Public survey of Baltimore City residents - Key stakeholder interviews - Key population focus groups - Key community partner focus groups After the data was collected and analyzed jointly, each individual hospital used the collected data for their respective community benefit service areas to identify their unique priorities for their communities. The collaborating hospitals/health systems did agree to jointly focus on behavioral health as a key city-wide priority. The following describes the individual data collection strategies with the accompanying results. A) Community Perspective The community's perspective was obtained through one survey offered to the public using several methods throughout Baltimore City. A 6-item survey queried Baltimore City residents to identify their top health concerns and their top barriers in accessing health care. Methods 6-item survey distributed in FY2018 using the following methods: * Conducted from late September through November 2017 * Participating hospitals collected data throughout the city * Distributed in person and offered online * Offered in English, Spanish, and Russian * Collected 4,755 surveys * All Baltimore City zip codes were represented in the responses Analysis by CBSA targeted zip codes revealed the same top health concerns and top health barriers with little deviation from the overall Baltimore City data. The sample size was 4,755 for all of Baltimore City and 1,324 for residents from the identified UMMC CBSA.

The additional unmet needs not addressed by UMMC will also continue to be addressed by key Baltimore City governmental agencies and existing community-based organizations. The UMMC identified core priorities target the intersection of the identified community needs and the organization's key strengths and mission."

PRIORITIZATION OF NEEDS WAS DETERMINED BY THE FORT SMITH COMMUNITY HEALTH COUNCIL, WHICH IS COMPRISED OF LOCAL COMMUNITY LEADERS. THE TOP HEALTH NEEDS TO THE FORT SMITH COMMUNITY ARE: ACCESS TO CARE, BEHAVIORAL HEALTH AND NUTRITION. ACCESS TO CARE: WHILE FACILITATING LOCAL COMMUNITY FOCUS GROUPS WITH OUR MARGINALIZED POPULATION WE DISCOVERED THAT MUCH OF THE COMMUNITY LACKED THE RESOURCES FOR OBTAINING HEALTH CARE SERVICES. THIS REMAINS AN ISSUE DUE TO THE UNDERINSURED OR COMPLETELY UNINSURED STATUS ALONG WITH OTHER OBSTACLES TO CARE LIKE TRANSPORTATION. THE SEBASTIAN COUNTY UNINSURED RATE OF 14% IS HIGHER THAN THE ARKANSAS RATE OF 12%. ACCOMPANYING THE HEALTHCARE COVERAGE ISSUES ARE THE SOCIOECONOMIC BARRIERS. THE $50,354 MEDIAN FAMILY INCOME OF THE FORT SMITH COMMUNITY STANDS ABOUT THREE THOUSAND DOLLARS LESS THAN THE STATE. BEHAVIORAL HEALTH: LOCAL FOCUS GROUPS, MEETINGS AND SURVEYS ALONG WITH NATIONAL AND STATE DATA HIGHLIGHT THE NEED FOR BEHAVIORAL HEALTH. THERE IS AN INCREASING NUMBER OF YOUTH AND ADULTS IN THE COMMUNITY THAT ARE EXPERIENCING ANXIETY PROBLEMS, SUICIDAL THOUGHTS, AND SUBSTANCE ABUSE. THE STAKEHOLDER FOCUS GROUP DISCUSSION HIGHLIGHTED ACCESS MENTAL HEALTH SERVICES WAS LACKING, WHICH IS SUPPORTED BY THE DESIGNATION OF A MENTAL HEALTH PROVIDER SHORTAGE AREA BY THE HEALTH RESOURCES & SERVICES ADMINISTRATION. THESE COMMUNITY MEMBERS ALSO TALKED ABOUT HOW SUBSTANCE USE REMAINS THE TOP SOCIAL BEHAVIOR IMPACTING THE FORT SMITH REGION. WHILE SEBASTIAN COUNTY STANDS AS NUMBER ONE IN THE STATE FOR PRESCRIBING RATES, WITH 153 PRESCRIPTIONS PER 100 PERSONS AS SEEN FROM THE CENTERS FOR DISEASE CONTROL AND PREVENTION. THE SUBSTANCE ABUSE HEALTH CRISIS IS MAGNIFIED BY THE PREVALENCE OF FOSTER CARE AND HIGH RECIDIVISM WITHIN THE COMMUNITY. NUTRITION: THE COMMUNITY VOICE RAISED VARIOUS TIMES THAT NUTRITION REMAINS EXTREMELY IMPACTFUL. BOTH LOCAL SURVEYS AND FOCUS GROUPS PUT THAT POOR EATING HABITS WAS THE TOP RISK BEHAVIOR SEEN IN THEIR COMMUNITY AND HEALTHY COOKING CLASSES BEING UNAVAILABLE TO HELP FIND SOLUTIONS TO THESE HABITS. THE OBESITY AND DIABETES EPIDEMIC HITTING THE REGION HAS VARIOUS CAUSES, ONE OF WHICH IS HEALTHY EATING AND NUTRITION. THE ACCESS TO FAST FOOD AND HIGH-CALORIC/NUTRIENT-POOR OPTIONS ALSO CONTRIBUTES TO THE WEIGHT AND CHRONIC HEALTH CONDITION PREVALENCE IN FORT SMITH. THREE ASSESSED HEALTH ISSUES IDENTIFIED IN THE 2019 CHNA PROCESS-CANCER, HOUSING, UNEMPLOYMENT-WERE NOT CHOSEN AS PRIORITY FOCUS AREAS FOR DEVELOPMENT OF IMPLEMENTATION STRATEGIES DUE TO MERCY'S CURRENT LACK OF RESOURCES AVAILABLE TO ADDRESS THESE NEEDS. THESE ISSUES WILL BE ADDRESSED INDIRECTLY IN IMPLEMENTATION STRATEGIES DEVELOPED TO MEET THE PRIORITIZED NEEDS IN AREAS THAT MAY OVERLAP. FOR EXAMPLE, EFFORTS TO REDUCE THE INCIDENCE OF OBESITY IN THE COMMUNITY MAY ALSO REDUCE THE INCIDENCE OF CANCER. ADDITIONALLY, RELATED COMMUNITY PARTNERSHIPS, EVIDENCE-BASED PROGRAMMING, AND SOURCES OF FINANCIAL AND OTHER RESOURCES WILL BE EXPLORED DURING THE NEXT THREE-YEAR CHIP CYCLE. MERCY FORT SMITH WILL CONSIDER FOCUSING ON THESE ISSUES SHOULD RESOURCES BECOME AVAILABLE. UNTIL THEN, MERCY FORT SMITH WILL SUPPORT, AS ABLE, THE EFFORTS OF PARTNER AGENCIES AND ORGANIZATIONS CURRENTLY WORKING TO ADDRESS THESE NEEDS WITHIN THE COMMUNITY. MERCY FORT SMITH IS WORKING ON ACCESS TO CARE THROUGH OUR COMMUNITY HEALTH WORKER PROGRAM AND CONNECTING THE UNINSURED OR UNDERINSURED PATIENTS WITH COMMUNITY RESOURCES. BEHAVIORAL HEALTH IS WORKING WITH AN ASSESSMENT TO SEE THE BEST WAY TO ADDRESS THIS ISSUE IN THE COMMUNITY.

SFMC CONTINUED TO WORK WITH OUR PARTNER, NOVO NORDISK, THROUGHOUT THE YEAR 2019.FOOD INSECURITY, ACCESS, AND NUTRITIONACCESS TO HEALTHY FOODS CONTINUED TO BE A CONCERN FOR TRENTON RESIDENTS AND PLAYS A SIGNIFICANT ROLE IN THE DEVELOPMENT OF THE CHILDREN IN THE TRENTON COMMUNITY. IN ORDER TO ADDRESS THIS CONCERN, SFMC COLLABORATED WITH A LOCAL FARMER TO BRING FRESH FRUITS AND VEGETABLES TO OUR HOSPITAL EMPLOYEES AND TO THE COMMUNITY BY ESTABLISHING A FARMERS MARKET ON CAMPUS. THE MARKET ACCEPTED ALL STATE AND FEDERAL ASSISTANCE PROGRAMS INCLUDING SNAP, WIC, FMNP AND SENIOR VOUCHERS. THIS MARKET WAS HELD ON A WEEKLY BASIS AND WAS EXTREMELY WELL RECEIVED BY OUR EMPLOYEES AND OUR COMMUNITY. AN ADDITIONAL FARMERS MARKET WAS ADDED WEEKLY IN THE DOWNTOWN TRENTON AREA IN COLLABORATION WITH THT AND HENRY J. AUSTIN, THE FEDERALLY QUALIFIED HEALTH CENTER. SFMC CONTINUED TO COLLABORATE WITH THE THT TO TRANSFORM OUR LOCAL CORNER STORES INTO HEALTHY CORNER STORES BY OFFERING FRESH PRODUCE AND OTHER HEALTHY OPTIONS TO COMMUNITY MEMBERS. IN 2017 THROUGH 2020, WORKING WITH THT, THE FOOD TRUST AND THE NJ PARTNERSHIP FOR HEALTHY KIDS, THE LUCKY STAR DELI, LOCATED IN THE CITY OF TRENTON, PARTICIPATED IN THE HEALTHY CORNER STORE NETWORK. ONCE A MONTH HEART SMARTS BROUGHT NUTRITION LESSONS TO THE DELI. CUSTOMERS LEARNED ABOUT SELECTING HEALTHY FOODS SUCH AS HEART HEALTHY WHOLE GRAINS AND TASTED RECIPES MADE FROM HEALTHY PRODUCTS AVAILABLE IN THE STORE. FOLLOWING A BLOOD PRESSURE SCREENING BY A SFMC NURSE, EACH PARTICIPANT RECEIVED FOUR HEART BUCKS (EACH $1) TO REDEEM FOR ANY HEART HEALTHY ITEMS IN THE STORE AS WELL AS OTHER INCENTIVES AND INFORMATION TO ENCOURAGE HEALTHY EATING.IN FY20, SFMC DID NOT DIRECTLY ADDRESS THE FOLLOWING PRIORITIES: HOUSING, RACIAL /ETHNIC INEQUITIES, MENTAL HEALTH AND SUBSTANCE USE DISORDERS, COMMUNITY SAFETY, CHRONIC DISEASE, AND MATERNAL AND CHILD HEALTH. THIS IS DUE TO FINANCIAL RESTRICTIONS, THE ABILITY OF OTHER AGENCIES TO ADDRESS THE SAME ISSUES, AND IN ORDER TO FOCUS ON EFFECTIVELY IMPACTING AND PREVENTING ADVERSE CHILDHOOD EXPERIENCES. THE HOSPITAL WILL CONTINUE TO ACKNOWLEDGE THE IMPACT OF THESE ISSUES WHILE IT FOCUSES ON THE EMERGING PRIORITIES IDENTIFIED BY QUANTITATIVE DATA AND COMMUNITY ENGAGEMENT EFFORTS."

THE STUDY AREA INCLUDED 19 COUNTIES ACROSS CENTRAL, NORTHEASTERN, AND SOUTH CENTRAL PENNSYLVANIA WHICH REPRESENT THE COLLECTIVE SERVICE AREAS OF THE COLLABORATING HOSPITALS. TO DISTINGUISH UNIQUE SERVICE AREAS AMONG HOSPITALS AND FOSTER COOPERATION WITH LOCAL COMMUNITY PARTNERS TO IMPACT HEALTH NEEDS, REGIONAL RESEARCH AND LOCAL REPORTING WAS DEVELOPED. THE COLLABORATING HEALTH SYSTEMS AGREED THAT BY COORDINATING EFFORTS TO IDENTIFY COMMUNITY HEALTH NEEDS ACROSS THE REGION, THE HEALTH SYSTEMS WOULD CONSERVE COMMUNITY RESOURCES WHILE DEMONSTRATING LEADERSHIP IN CONVENING LOCAL COMMUNITY PARTNERS TO ADDRESS COMMON PRIORITY NEEDS. BEST PRACTICES IN COMMUNITY HEALTH IMPROVEMENT DEMONSTRATE THAT FOSTERING ""COLLECTIVE IMPACT"" IS AMONG THE MOST SUCCESSFUL WAYS TO AFFECT THE HEALTH OF A COMMUNITY. COLLECTIVE IMPACT IS ACHIEVED BY COMMITTING A DIVERSE GROUP OF STAKEHOLDERS TOWARD A COMMON GOAL OR ACTION, PARTICULARLY TO IMPACT DEEP ROOTED SOCIAL OR HEALTH NEEDS.

THE CHNA WAS OVERSEEN BY A PLANNING COMMITTEE OF REPRESENTATIVES FROM EACH HEALTH SYSTEM, AS WELL AS A REGIONAL ADVISORY COMMITTEE OF REPRESENTATIVES FROM EACH HOSPITAL. COMMUNITY ENGAGEMENT COMMUNITY ENGAGEMENT WAS AN INTEGRAL PART OF THE CHNA. WEBINARS WERE HELD IN OCTOBER AND NOVEMBER 2017 TO ANNOUNCE THE ONSET OF THE CHNA AND ENCOURAGE BROAD PARTICIPATION ACROSS THE REGION. THROUGHOUT OCTOBER AND NOVEMBER 2017, A KEY INFORMANT SURVEY WAS SENT TO APPROXIMATELY 1,000 REPRESENTATIVES OF HEALTH AND HUMAN SERVICE ORGANIZATIONS, RELIGIOUS INSTITUTIONS, CIVIC ASSOCIATIONS, BUSINESSES, ELECTED OFFICIALS AND OTHER COMMUNITY REPRESENTATIVES. PARTNER FORUMS WERE HELD THROUGHOUT THE REGION IN JANUARY 2018 TO BRING TOGETHER THESE PARTNERS TO REVIEW RESEARCH FINDINGS AND PROVIDE FEEDBACK ON THE MOST PRESSING COMMUNITY HEALTH NEEDS. IN MARCH AND APRIL 2018, FOCUS GROUPS WITH SENIORS WERE HELD TO BETTER UNDERSTAND CHALLENGES AND OPPORTUNITIES TO IMPROVING HEALTH AMONG HIGH RISK POPULATIONS. COMMUNITY FORUMS ARE PLANNED FOR FALL 2018 TO PRESENT CHNA FINDINGS AND IMPLEMENTATION PLANS TO COMMUNITY RESIDENTS AND PROVIDE A FORUM FOR DIALOGUE ABOUT ADDRESSING COMMUNITY HEALTH NEEDS. CHNA METHODOLOGY THE FY2019 CHNA WAS CONDUCTED FROM SEPTEMBER 2017 TO APRIL 2018 AND USED BOTH PRIMARY AND SECONDARY RESEARCH TO ILLUSTRATE AND COMPARE HEALTH TRENDS AND DISPARITIES ACROSS THE REGION. PRIMARY RESEARCH WAS USED TO SOLICIT INPUT FROM KEY COMMUNITY STAKEHOLDERS REPRESENTING THE BROAD INTERESTS OF THE COMMUNITY, INCLUDING EXPERTS IN PUBLIC HEALTH AND INDIVIDUALS REPRESENTING MEDICALLY UNDERSERVED, LOW-INCOME AND MINORITY POPULATIONS. FOCUS GROUPS AND INTERVIEWS WERE USED TO COLLECT IN-DEPTH INSIGHT FROM HEALTH CONSUMERS REPRESENTING MEDICALLY UNDERSERVED OR HIGH RISK POPULATIONS. EXISTING DATA SOURCES, INCLUDING PUBLIC HEALTH STATISTICS, DEMOGRAPHIC AND SOCIAL MEASURES, AND HEALTHCARE UTILIZATION, WERE COLLECTED AND ANALYZED TO IDENTIFY HEALTH TRENDS ACROSS HOSPITAL SERVICE AREAS.

PROGRAMMING AND CLINICAL SERVICES WITHIN THESE PRIORITY AREAS IMPACT THE POPULATIONS OF MATERNAL/INFANT HEALTH AND SENIOR HEALTH AND ARE THEREBY SERVED THROUGH ALL APPROPRIATE HEALTH IMPROVEMENT EFFORTS. BELOW ARE SYSTEMWIDE PROGRAMS OFFERED BY GEISINGER TO FULFILL COMMUNITY NEEDS THAT WERE IDENTIFIED IN THE HOSPITAL'S MOST RECENT CHNA. SOME PROGRAMS ARE COMPLETELY OPERATED OR FUNDED BY GEISINGER AND SOME ARE OFFERED IN COOPERATION WITH LOCAL HEALTH AND HUMAN SERVICE AGENCIES. FOR MORE SPECIFIC NEEDS FOUND IN OUR LOCAL COMMUNITIES, WE OFFER PROGRAMS TO SERVE PATIENTS CLOSE TO HOME. THE TOP THREE NEEDS IDENTIFIED IN THE MOST RECENT AND/OR PAST CHNA SURVEYS FALL INTO ONE OF THREE COMMUNITY NEED CATEGORIES: 1)IMPROVING ACCESS TO HEALTHCARE: THE MOST SIGNIFICANT NEED IDENTIFIED WAS FOR BETTER, FASTER, MORE CONVENIENT AND LESS COSTLY ACCESS TO HEALTHCARE SERVICES. GEISINGER IS TAKING INNOVATIVE STEPS TO ADDRESS BARRIERS TO HEALTHCARE BY: INCREASING THE NUMBER OF RESIDENTS WHO HAVE A REGULAR PRIMARY CARE PROVIDER, INCREASING ACCESS TO PRIMARY AND SPECIALTY CARE PROVIDERS, REDUCING BARRIERS TO RECEIVING CARE FOR RESIDENTS WITHOUT TRANSPORTATION AND FOSTERING THE PURSUIT OF HEALTH CAREERS AND ONGOING TRAINING OF HEALTH PROFESSIONALS. 2)ADDRESSING BEHAVIORAL HEALTH AND SUBSTANCE ABUSE: GEISINGER IS COMMITTED TO HELPING PATIENTS FIND HEALTHCARE SERVICES WHEN THEY ARE FACING BEHAVIORAL HEALTH CHALLENGES OR STRUGGLING WITH ADDICTION. WE ADVANCE DIALOGUE AT THE LOCAL AND STATE LEVEL TO ADDRESS BEHAVIORAL HEALTH NEEDS. WE FOSTER INTEGRATION OF BEHAVIOR AND PRIMARY HEALTHCARE. WE PROVIDE EDUCATION TO INCREASE RESIDENTS' AWARENESS OF BEHAVIORAL HEALTH ISSUES AND REDUCE THE STIGMA ASSOCIATED WITH BEHAVIORAL HEALTH CONDITIONS. AND WE STRIVE TO INCREASE ACCESS TO BEHAVIORAL HEALTH SERVICES. 3)MANAGING CHRONIC CONDITIONS: GEISINGER HAS NUMEROUS PROGRAMS TO HELP PATIENTS PREVENT AND MANAGE CHRONIC CONDITIONS. EFFORTS INCLUDE ENCOURAGING COMMUNITY INITIATIVES THAT SUPPORT ACCESS TO AND AVAILABILITY OF HEALTHY LIFESTYLE CHOICES, INITIATING EARLY STAGE INTERVENTIONS FOR INDIVIDUALS AT HIGH RISK FOR CHRONIC DISEASE AND ADDRESSING HEALTH LITERACY TO IMPROVE RESIDENTS' SELF-EFFICACY IN DISEASE MANAGEMENT. ACCESS TO HEALTHCARE LACK OF TRANSPORTATION IS A SIGNIFICANT CHALLENGE FOR MANY MEMBERS OF OUR COMMUNITY. NOT BEING ABLE TO GET THE CARE THEY NEED - OR PUTTING OFF THE CARE THEY NEED UNTIL A MINOR HEALTH ISSUE BECOMES A MAJOR PROBLEM - IS A POPULATION HEALTH ISSUE THAT CANNOT BE IGNORED. THAT'S WHY GEISINGER HEALTH PLAN IS PARTNERING WITH LOCAL ENTITIES, SUCH AS NEPA MOVES AND THE EQUITABLE TRANSPORTATION WORKGROUP) TO EXPAND TRANSPORTATION SERVICES AND IMPROVE ACCESS TO HEALTHCARE AND SOCIAL SERVICES. THIS INITIATIVE IS PROJECTED TO HAVE A POSITIVE IMPACT ON NO-SHOW RATES, FILL RATES, EMERGENCY DEPARTMENT UTILIZATION, LENGTHS-OF-STAY, UNPLANNED 30-DAY ADMISSIONS, CHANGES IN HEALTH STATUS AND QUALITY OF LIFE. IN ORDER TO ATTRACT AND RETAIN MORE HEALTHCARE PROFESSIONALS, WE ARE TRACKING RECRUITMENT DATA FOR NEW HIRES, GEISINGER COMMONWEALTH SCHOOL OF MEDICINE APPLICANTS AND NURSE EXTERNS. WE HAVE ALSO LAUNCHED A LUNCH-AND- LEARN PROGRAM IN NURSING WHERE LEADERSHIP PROVIDES INFORMATION ON CAREER PATHS WITHIN GEISINGER TO NURSING STUDENTS. THE CLINICAL LUNCHEONS WERE HELD WITH SCHOOLS THAT CONDUCT CLINICALS AT GCMC, A TOTAL OF 83 STUDENTS ATTEND LUNCHEONS. MORE LUNCHEONS WERE SCHEDULED; HOWEVER, DUE TO SCHOOL CANCELLATIONS, THE REMAINDER OF THE LUNCHEONS WERE CANCELED FOR THE SPRING OF 2020. APPROXIMATELY 17 STUDENTS WERE INTERESTED IN NURSING HERE AT GEISINGER. IN ORDER TO DECREASE UNNECESSARY VISITS TO OUR EMERGENCY DEPARTMENT, GEISINGER COMMUNITY MEDICAL CENTER IS WORKING WITH LOCAL CLINICS, ENCOURAGING THEM TO LEAVE OPEN SLOTS IN THEIR APPOINTMENT SCHEDULES SO PATIENTS HAVE EASIER ACCESS. WE ARE ALSO PROVIDING EMERGENCY DEPARTMENT VS. URGENT CARE PATIENT EDUCATION MATERIALS AT COMMUNITY EVENTS TO EDUCATE ON WHEN IT IS APPROPRIATE TO USE THE EMERGENCY DEPARTMENT. BEHAVIORAL HEALTH GEISINGER COMMUNITY MEDICAL CENTER HAS BEEN ADVOCATING TO REMOVE REGULATORY BARRIERS TO THE PROVISION OF BEHAVIORAL HEALTH SERVICES. AS A RESULT OF THESE EFFORTS, AN ADDICTION MEDICINE OUTPATIENT CLINIC WAS LAUNCHED AT 3 WEST OLIVE STREET IN SCRANTON ON APRIL 8, 2019, AND HAS RAMPED UP AND IS SERVING THE COMMUNITY. IN ADDITION, A WARM HANDOFF PROGRAM IS FUNCTIONAL WITHIN THE EMERGENCY DEPARTMENT AT GCMC IN COLLABORATION WITH THE SCRANTON COUNSELING CENTER. THIS PROGRAM IS STAFFED BY CERTIFIED RECOVERY SPECIALISTS, WHO ENGAGE PATIENTS WITH ADDICTIONS WITH THE GOAL OF EFFECTIVELY STEERING THEM TOWARD TREATMENT. THE OFFICE OF MENTAL HEALTH AND SUBSTANCE ABUSE SERVICES (OMHSAS) HAS APPROVED TELEPSYCHIATRY IN THE EMERGENCY DEPARTMENT FOR ADOLESCENTS FOR GEISINGER COMMUNITY MEDICAL CENTER. HOWEVER, SINCE THIS SERVICE OCCURS WITHIN A HOSPITAL, DEPARTMENT OF HEALTH (DOH) APPROVAL MUST ALSO BE OBTAINED. THIS REQUEST HAS BEEN SUBMITTED. EQUIPMENT HAS BEEN ORDERED TO PROVIDE THIS SERVICE BUT HAS NOT YET ARRIVED. THE EQUIPMENT IS BEING FUNDED BY THE MOSES TAYLOR FUND IN COLLABORATION WITH THE BEHAVIORAL HEALTH INITIATIVE. IT IS ANTICIPATED THAT THIS SERVICE WILL BE OPERATIONAL BY JUNE 1, 2020. TELEPSYCHIATRY SERVICES HAVE BEEN APPROVED FOR THE EMERGENCY DEPARTMENT AT GEISINGER COMMUNITY MEDICAL CENTER AND FOR ADULT PATIENTS AND FOR ADULT AND PEDIATRIC PATIENTS AT THE MOUNT PLEASANT CLINIC. GEISINGER CAN REQUEST ADDITIONAL SITES AS LONG AS THESE SITES WILL BE SUPPORTED BY COMMUNITY CARE BEHAVIORAL HEALTH (CCBH) AND THE NORTHEAST BEHAVIORAL HEALTH CARE CONSORTIUM (NBHCC) FOR PAYMENT. PRELIMINARY WORK IS ALSO UNDERWAY TO PROVIDE TELEPSYCHIATRY SUPPORT TO THE LIFE GEISINGER DAY CENTER FOR NURSING-HOME-ELIGIBLE SENIORS IN THE SCRANTON LOCATION. AN INTEGRATED PRIMARY CARE PRACTICE AT THE GEISINGER MOUNT PLEASANT LOCATION SERVES BOTH ADULTS AND PEDS PATIENTS VIA EMBEDDED PSYCHOLOGISTS. IN ADDITION, PLANNING IS UNDERWAY TO EXPAND AND INTEGRATE ADDICTION MEDICINE FELLOWS INTO SERVICES PROVIDED BY THE WRIGHT CENTER.

Rush's Office of Community Engagement, under its Senior Vice President for Community Health Equity, led the effort for the 2019 Rush collaborative CHNA. We sought to include more stakeholders in our process of developing the CHNA this time around by engaging old and new partners. We began by gathering input from community members as well as from Rush faculty, students, and staff (especially those who live in our service area). We sought perspectives from our colleagues at health systems and public health entities in the area; community leaders and members; and our colleagues participating in the Alliance for Health Equity. The Alliance for Health Equity is a collaborative group convened by the Illinois Public Health Institute and consisted at the time of over 30 hospitals, area health departments, and more than 100 community-based organizations working together on a joint CHNA process.

Rush's Community Health Implementation Plan (CHIP) was adopted in June 2019 simultaneously with the CHNA. This combined approach was an improvement for the new round of CHNA/CHIP, as Rush leadership believed that if we identify needs, we must simultaneously come up with an approach to address them. The following community health needs were identified in partnership with the Alliance for Health Equity, and the improvements with guidance and focus to connect with local initiatives as Rush believes it must partner with others to move the needle to improve health such as the Alliance, West Side United, Senator Durbin's HEAL initiative, and West Side ConnectED. Given that our CHNA/CHIP were formally adopted in June 2019, the following efforts tied to the final year of our 2016-2019 CHNA/CHIP, but there is great overlap as we are doubling down on our new goals. The needs identified for 2019 remained the same with the addition of maternal child health as a fifth need. Please note that we only highlight selected information in the following section. For more detailed information, please find published documents and supporting programs on our website, https://www.Rush.edu/about-us/Rush-community Goal 1: Reduce inequities caused by the social, economic and structural determinants of health. A. Rush has been working to improve educational attainment through long standing programs such as our partnership with Malcolm X College, Richard T. Crane Medical Preparatory High School, and the K-12 program - REACH, the Rush Education and Career Hub. This builds on years of partnership, but focuses our efforts in communities we identified with the most need. In FY2020, REACH programs served more than 2,500 students, 500 parents, and more than 350 teachers. B. Identify, measure and mitigate the social determinants of health among those at risk - particularly children, young adults and people with chronic illness. During the fiscal year, Rush implemented a screening tool to identify non-medical barriers to good health, such as food insecurity, homelessness, lack of utilities, transportation barriers, and lack of primary care/insurance. This screening tool was implemented in the Rush University Medical Center emergency department, primary care settings, and community based settings. Patients screened for these social determinants of health (SDOH) were connected to services via a partnership with NowPow, a locally-based, resource directory company which provides curated, personalized resources that are shared with patients. Future plans include the integration of the SDOH screening tool with a screen designed to detect adverse childhood experiences (ACEs) - traumatic events which are strongly related to the development and prevalence of a wide range of health problems throughout a person's lifespan. Further, we intend to expand the SDOH screening tool system-wide and connect it with Medicare Health Risk Assessments (HRAs) as well as develop opportunities to study and publish on the impact of screening on patients' overall health outcomes. Rush joined the Alliance for Health Equity (AHE) early on and is a member of the steering committee. In addition, a Rush representative chairs several workgroups, including the food security and social determinants workgroups. Rush is particularly invested in helping guide AHE to focus on our identified needs and improvements. Rush also has a leadership role in data, policy, and trauma informed care work groups. Goal 2: Improve access to mental and behavioral health services. A. Address psychological trauma through screening tools and referral programs in school-based health centers (SBHCs) and faith-based organizations. Rush is working to address the mental and behavioral health needs of our patients and communities by having social work services offered to our primary care, inpatient, and emergency department patients. In addition, the College of Nursing and Rush Community Based Practices offer mental health services in the community at Simpson Academy for Young Women and the College of Nursing faculty practice sites. School-based initiatives. Students seen in the SBHCs are receiving age-appropriate risk screening and evaluation for mental health issues. Those identified with mental health issues are referred for in-SBHC or community-based counseling and psychiatric services. In FY2020, 564 risk screenings were completed, resulting in 181 students linked to in-SBHC mental health services. Of those 181, five were pregnant teens who have been referred to home visiting services through the ACEs in Pregnancy program. Through a partnership with the Rush Department of Psychiatry, psychiatric services, provided both in-SBHC and by telehealth visits, launched in January 2018. During FY2020, there were 76 students who received SBHC-provided psychiatric care. SBHC staff delivered 2,435 minutes of group education that focused on self-care, mental health, and skill building for resilience to 1,320 students through school outreach activities. Finally, 46 teachers, parents, staff, and community members participated in educational sessions on the same topics. Faith-based initiatives. A total of 233 congregants and community members were trained in mental health first aid, which teaches lay people how to identify, understand, and respond to signs of addictions and mental illnesses. During the time of COVID-19 surge, the SBHCs were closed for operations. SBHC staff were redeployed to various efforts around the system including the Emergency Department ambulance bay, COVID clinic, triage lines, and the results call-back center. All SBHC clinical services were integrated into the Adolescent Family Center or moved to telehealth so vital services for students could go uninterrupted. B. Expand access to other screenings and services through a partnership with the Rush department of psychiatry. Launched in January of 2018, Rush provided psychiatric services, in-SBHCs and by telehealth visits. In FY2020, 76 students received psychiatric services in the SBHCs. Over two thousand hours of education that focused on trauma, mental health, identification of mental health issues, and skill building for resilience was provided to 1,320 students through school outreach activities."

Goal 3: Prevent and reduce chronic disease by focusing on risk factors. 1. Reduce risk factors through assessments, disease management programs and improved access to healthy food. The Rush surplus project continued to take place at both Rush University Medical Center and Rush Oak Park Hospital in FY2020. Through a continued partnership with Franciscan Outreach and Beyond Hunger), Rush has provided over 19,000 free meals annually to the organizations, since it was started in 2015. Additionally, Rush continues to collaborate with another community partner, Top Box Foods, to provide local produce to its employees and community members for a discounted rate monthly. In FY2020, 700 unique Rush employees participated in this program. During the pandemic, connected 350 employees with free, healthy food. At the height of the pandemic, connected approximately 1,500 community residents with healthy food needs. ROPH's community wellness program screens and connects individuals to resources at Oak Park River Forest Food Pantry, a nursing led screening program. It provides free educational seminars and fitness classes, which are designed to help community members Lead healthier lives and address chronic disease. Healthy motivations provided education on topics such as heart and vascular disease, preventive health, depression and more. In FY2020, the program provided services to over 2,268 women and families. The metropolitan Chicago Breast Cancer Task Force launched in 2007 as an independent non-profit based at Rush, with the goal of reducing the disparity in breast cancer deaths between African American women and white women in Chicago. After these initiatives launched, the disparities began to decrease. In addition, ROPH provides free mammograms to uninsured or underinsured women who live in Oak Park, River Forest, and Proviso township. In FY2020, 576 women were screened. In the past fiscal year, Rush has been working on standardizing its approach to tobacco control and cessation per our defined needs and our work with the Chicago Department of Public Health's (CDPH) Healthy Chicago 2.0 Chicago Quits grant in partnership with Respiratory Health Association. However, this past year due to restructure and COVID-19 demands on Respiratory Care, our classes internally and in the community paused, as many had a Spring 2020 start date. Given this change, the team worked on infrastructure and continued to host the Tobacco Oversight Committee and also developed enhanced system connection with ProChange, Rush's partner software for tobacco cessation and updating the internal processes for referral."

OUR PARTNER SESSIONS GAVE THE OPPORTUNITY FOR AREA HOSPITALS TO DISCUSS NYS PREVENTION AGENDA PRIORITIES, FEEDBACK FROM THEIR PUBLIC NEEDS ASSESSMENTS, SERVICES PROVIDED, GAPS IN SERVICE AND BEST PRACTICES. WHILE ALL HOSPITALS IN WESTCHESTER COUNTY SHARE THE SAME PRIORITIES, EACH HOSPITAL SELECTED PRIORITIES THAT ALIGNED WITH THEIR MISSION, WERE ATTAINABLE, AND CREATED A PROGRAM THAT BEST SUITED ITS INSTITUTION AND PATIENT SERVICE AREA. THE PUBLIC INPUT PROCESS ALSO ENCOMPASSED COLLABORATION WITH THE FOLLOWING PARTNERS: CITY OF YONKERS/SJRH'S HEALTHY YONKERS INITIATIVE AND THE SJRH COMMUNITY ADVISORY COMMITTEE. A MULTIDISCIPLINARY GROUP WAS INVOLVED IN ASSESSING COMMUNITY HEALTH NEEDS IN WESTCHESTER COUNTY WITH PUBLIC PARTICIPATION SOLICITED VIA A SURVEY SPONSORED BY THE WCDOH AND COMMUNITY PARTNERS. THE COLLABORATIVE PROCESS WAS BENEFICIAL IN RESEARCHING CURRENT HEALTH DATA, CONDUCTING HEALTH NEEDS ASSESSMENTS WITHIN OUR COMMUNITIES, SHARING OF BEST PRACTICE INTERVENTIONS AND LEVERAGING OF RESOURCES. TO DETERMINE THE MOST PRESSING HEALTH NEEDS OF OUR COMMUNITY, WE SURVEYED MEMBERS OF THE MEDICALLY UNDERSERVED, LOW-INCOME, AND MINORITY POPULATIONS IN THE SJRH SERVICE AREA, WHO REPRESENT THE HEALTH INTERESTS OF OUR PATIENTS AND THEIR FAMILIES. THE COLLABORATIVE SURVEY WAS COMPLETED BY MORE THAN 3,500 RESPONDENTS BETWEEN JANUARY AND MAY 2019. THE SURVEY COMPRISED THE PRIMARY DATA COLLECTION WITH QUERIES TAILORED TO ALIGN WITH THE PREVENTION AGENDA; THE PROCESS INCLUDED COMMUNITY BASED FOCUS GROUPS, GRASS ROOTS DISTRIBUTION, COLLECTION AND INTRA-ORGANIZATIONAL REVIEW OF RESIDENT NEEDS, SERVICE UTILIZATION AND OUTCOMES. THIRTY TWO PERCENT OF RESPONDENTS IDENTIFIED AS HISPANIC AND 43.7% IDENTIFIED AS NON-HISPANIC WHITE AND 16.2% AS NON-HISPANIC BLACK. RESPONDENTS RESIDED THROUGHOUT THE COUNTY, WITH 13% LIVING IN A WHITE PLAINS ZIP CODE (10601, 10603, 10604, 10605, 10606, 10607, 10608) AND APPROXIMATELY 34.6% LIVING IN THE ST. JOHNS RIVERSIDE SERVICE AREA. ST. JOHN'S LEADERSHIP ALSO CONSIDERED ITS OWN RESOURCES, STRENGTHS, AND ABILITIES IN THE SELECTION OF SJRH'S PRIORITY COMMUNITY NEEDS. TO HELP SUPPORT AND COORDINATE THIS COLLABORATION, THE WCDOH INVITED ALL WESTCHESTER HOSPITALS TO ATTEND A KICK-OFF MEETING IN EARLY 2019. TO SUPPORT IN THE SELECTION OF PRIORITIES THE WCDOH'S HEALTH AND HOSPITAL PLANNING TEAM HELD COLLABORATIVE MEETINGS THROUGHOUT 2019. IN ADDITION, MEMBERS OF THAT GROUP JOINED WITH THE WORK OF MONTEFIORES OFFICE OF COMMUNITY AND POPULATION HEALTH FOR MONTHLY MEETINGS THROUGHOUT THE SPRING, SUMMER, AND FALL 2019. THE COLLECTION OF PRIMARY DATA FROM A SAMPLE OF THE WESTCHESTER COUNTY RESIDENTS WAS AN IMPORTANT ELEMENT OF THE DEVELOPMENT OF THE COMMUNITY HEALTH NEEDS ASSESSMENT. SJRH ENGAGED WITH THE WCDOH'S ON-LINE COMMUNITY RESIDENT AND PROVIDER HEALTH SURVEYS TO FACILITATE THE IMPLEMENTATION OF THE DATA COLLECTION PROCESS. WE IDENTIFIED THE FOLLOWING PARTNERS TO HELP IMPLEMENT INTERVENTIONS IDENTIFIED IN OUR COMMUNITY HEALTH NEEDS ASSESSMENT: HUDSON RIVER HEALTHCARE FQHC, HUDSON COMMUNITY HEALTH ALLIANCE'S LOCAL IMPACT INITIATIVE, PRIMARY PRACTICE OFFICES, CANCER COALITION OF WESTCHESTER, HEALTHY YONKERS INITIATIVE, SJRH BEHAVIORAL HEALTH SERVICES, SJRH COMMUNITY ADVISORY TEAM, WESTCHESTER COUNTY DEPARTMENT OF HEALTH AND THE MONTEFIORE HUDSON VALLEY COLLABORATIVE. OUR PLANNING TEAM ALSO CONDUCTED A SURVEY OF SELECTED STAKEHOLDERS REPRESENTING HEALTH CARE AND SERVICE-PROVIDING AGENCIES WITHIN THE COUNTY.

THE SURVEY WAS DEVELOPED THROUGH A COLLABORATIVE EFFORT BY AN EIGHTEEN-MEMBER SURVEY COMMITTEE REPRESENTING COUNTY PUBLIC HEALTH DEPARTMENT AND LOCAL HOSPITALS DURING THE SPRING-SUMMER OF 2017. A TOTAL OF 3,500 COMMUNITY SURVEYS WERE COLLECTED, THIS IS 2,182 MORE SURVEYS THAN THE ONE CONDUCTED FOR THE PREVIOUS COMMUNITY SERVICE PLANNING PROCESS AND THE COMMUNITY HEALTH NEEDS ASSESSMENT PROCESS. TO ENSURE A BROAD ASSESSMENT OF OUR COMMUNITY HEALTH NEEDS, WE ENGAGED A VARIETY OF PARTICIPANTS INCLUDING, BUT NOT LIMITED TO, THE COMMUNITY-AT-LARGE THROUGH LOCAL RESIDENTS PARTICIPATING IN SJRH SPEAKER'S BUREAU'S HEALTH EDUCATION PROGRAMS. WE SHARED HEALTH DATA AND SOUGHT FEEDBACK THROUGH THE FOLLOWING SJRH GROUPS: COMMUNITY ADVISORY COMMITTEE, PASTORAL CARE COMMITTEE, PHYSICIAN ALIGNMENT COMMITTEE, RADIOLOGY ADVISORY COMMITTEE, WELLNESS COMMITTEE, BOARD OF TRUSTEES AND OUR EMPLOYEES. WE PLAN TO PROVIDE ONGOING OPPORTUNITIES FOR HOSPITALS AND OTHER STAKEHOLDERS, I.E. COMMUNITY-BASED ORGANIZATIONS, TO STRATEGIZE ON HOW TO ADDRESS HEALTH PRIORITIES.

The Healthy Franklin County Leadership Advisory Committee, composed of a cross-section of stakeholders in Franklin County, brought significant insight and meaningful engagement to the CHNA process. The Community Services team coordinated and/or facilitated a series of seven focus groups with community members in the Summit Health Service area. The goal of these focus groups was to gather information about Franklin County's top community health needs from the perspective of targeted community informants that included schools, low-income, minority and senior populations. Focus groups were held with Franklin County school nurses and Chambersburg and Waynesboro area school counselors, respectively. Additionally, Dr. Jose Ricardo-Osorio, a professor at Shippensburg University and a member of Healthy Franklin County Leadership team, led a focus group of Spanish-speaking Hispanic community members. Dr. Annette Searfoss, the President and CEO of First Start Partnerships for Children and Families (formerly Franklin County Head Start) and a member of Healthy Franklin County Leadership team, also led a focus groups with a group of currently-enrolled First Start families in Chambersburg while Education and Family Services staff led a second group with the same target population in Waynesboro. Last, Dr. Annette Searfoss later facilitated a focus group in Chambersburg with working adults of retirement age who must continue to work because they do not have enough savings or a retirement fund to support themselves. The goal of each of these focus groups was to gather information about Franklin Countys top community health needs from the perspective of targeted community informants.A second tool was a survey of 51 veterans conducted by the Community Services team atSummit Health. This survey was designed to closely mirror the community behavioral risk factor survey and provide more details about the health conditions, risks, and behaviors of this population.In addition to the focus groups and veterans survey, Summit Health hosted a stakeholder forum on April 15, 2019, with members of the Healthy Franklin County Leadership Advisory Group. The three primary goals of the forum were to: (1) explain the CHNA process and the role of community stakeholders; (2) present the analytic framework and preliminary community health data included in the summary; and (3) gather input from these community stakeholders who have public health expertise or serve medically underserved, low income, and minority populations in Franklin County, about community health needs and community resources."

The key findings from the CHNA and the selected community health priorities were presented at an open community forum: BUILDING A CULTURE OF HEALTH IN FRANKLIN COUNTY, on June 5, 2019. 120 community members were given an opportunity to discuss the priorities identified and give input about how to address them through a health equity lens.The 2018 CHNA results and related priorities identified by Healthy Franklin County Leadership Advisory Group were then shared with Summit Health Management, Waynesboro Hospital, Chambersburg Hospital, and Summit Health Boards."
202141349349300814,230465970,"Facility: WellSpan Chambersburg Hospital - Part V, Section B, Line 11","The Community Health Needs Assessment process encourages communities to reflect on the initiatives that they have undertaken and their successes in addressing the health priorities they have established. Since 2015, Summit Health's Community Services team engaged with the community to establish specific activities targeted to improving community health in seven priority areas. The community priorities, goals, and activities resulting from the 2015 Community Health Needs Assessment process are fully described in Appendix I of the 2018-2019 Summit Health Community Health Needs Assessment.The seven priority areas established in 2015 include access to primary care services, nutrition, physical activity, mental heal and substance use and prevention, education and community based education, early childhood education, and adolescent health. Table 8 of the 2018-2019 Summit Health Community Health Needs Assessment shows the number of initiatives implemented and health indicators related to each. The community, led by Summit Health and the Healthy Franklin County Leadership Group, created many community interventions, with the most effort dedicated to nutrition, followed by mental health and substance use and prevention, physical activity, and access to care. Unfortunately all of these activities have not yet produced much community-level change. Access to care has remained virtually unchanged with the exception of higher rates of dental visits. Indicators related to nutrition and physical activity have gotten worse. Mental health indicators have also declined. Education and community based education indicators have remained virtually unchanged. Access to early childhood education has improved as have teen birth rates and teen chlamydia rates. These results are reminders of at least two important truths about improving public health. First, effecting change will require more than three or four years. Most of the public health problems in our communities have emerged over long periods of time and it will require a long-term and sustained investment to produce change. Second, most of the indicators used here are trailing indicators that reflect at least in part social and structural contexts that are likely to move once those underlying conditions begin to change. Put simply, time and social change are necessary conditions for improving the health of a community. The priorities and impacts established by the 2015 Community Health Needs Assessment (CHNA) provide a summary of the work implemented guided by the results of the previous CHNA regarding the seven priority areas indicated above. To access progress towards these goals, community indicators from the 2015 CHNA and 2019 CHNA were compared in the categories of organizational indicators and presented in a table in the CHNA assessment report. Access to care has remained virtually unchanged with the exception of higher rates of dentist visits.Nutrition and physical activity has gotten worse for all indicators, despite the many activities completed at an organizational level to address these issues. Mental health indicators have also declined. Education and community based education indicators have remained virtually unchanged. Access to early childhood education has improved. Teen birth rate and teen chlamydia rates have gone down, while the chlamydia rate for young adults has increased. These results should be viewed while considering one important point - it takes time in order to see changes at the community level; simply because an indicator has not changed or has declined does not mean that the intervention has failed - there may be more reasons why a positive changed has not occurred.See attached 2019 WellSpan Summit Health Community Health Improvement Plan, also available online at www.wellspan.org in Community Benefits section."

In recent years, overall charity care has decreased slightly as more people have obtained health insurance coverage through the Affordable Care Act and the expansion of Pennsylvanias Medical Assistance (Medicaid) program. WellSpan is proud to be a leading partner in the Healthy Community Network, which works to address the needs of uninsured and underinsured individuals in our community. In addition, the health system recently enhanced its financial assistance policy and the discounts that it provides on services. For example, if a patients income is less than 300 percent of the federal poverty level, that patient would be eligible for a 100 percent discount on the services provided. Additionally, significant discounts are available for patients whose income is between 300 percent and 350 percent of the federal poverty level.

202121339349302032,310537486,GOOD SAMARITAN HOSPITAL,"PART V, SECTION B, LINE 5: PRIMARY DATA SOURCES ALMOST 1,300 PEOPLE HAD AN OPPORTUNITY TO IDENTIFY AND PRIORITIZE HEALTH AND HEALTH-RELATED ISSUES AT A MEETING OR BY SURVEY. TWENTY-THREE (23) COUNTY OR DISTRICT-LEVEL PUBLIC HEALTH DEPARTMENTS RESPONDED BY SURVEY, AND THE CHNA TEAM ALSO RECEIVED SURVEY RESPONSES FROM 5 CITY-LEVEL HEALTH DEPARTMENTS. NINETY-SIX NONPROFIT ORGANIZATIONS COMPLETED SURVEYS, AND THEY SERVED RESIDENTS IN EVERY COUNTY. TOTAL RESPONSE FAR EXCEEDED THE LEVEL OF RESPONSE EXPERIENCED THREE YEARS EARLIER FOR THE 2016 CHNAS IN CINCINNATI AND DAYTON. PRIMARY DATA WAS OBTAINED, WITH A UNIFORM SET OF QUESTIONS, VIA THE FOLLOWING: * THERE WERE 42 MEETINGS, HELD IN 23 COUNTIES DURING MAY THROUGH JULY 2018, WHICH ATTRACTED 463 REPRESENTATIVES OF COMMUNITY ORGANIZATIONS, THE GENERAL PUBLIC, AND/OR MEMBERS OF MEDICALLY UNDERSERVED AND VULNERABLE POPULATIONS TO IDENTIFY BARRIERS TO CARE, GIVE INPUT FOR CURRENT NEEDS ASSESSMENT, PRIORITIZE ISSUES, AND IDENTIFY RESOURCES TO ADDRESS HEALTH AND HEALTH-RELATED ISSUES. * ONLINE SURVEYS OF INDIVIDUALS (828), AGENCIES (96), AND PUBLIC HEALTH DEPARTMENTS (28) THROUGHOUT THE REGION FROM JUNE THROUGH AUGUST 2018. * THE REPORTING HOSPITAL DID NOT RECEIVE WRITTEN COMMENTS FROM THE PUBLIC REGARDING THE 2016 CHNA OR ITS RELATED IMPLEMENTATION STRATEGY. COMMUNITY MEETINGS OUTREACH ANY INDIVIDUAL OR AGENCY REPRESENTATIVE WHO GAVE THEIR ADDRESS DURING THE 2013 OR 2016 CHNA PROCESS WAS ADDED TO AN INVITE LIST, AND THE HEALTH COLLABORATIVE (THC) MAILED THEM AN INVITATION TO THE MEETING SCHEDULED IN THEIR COUNTY. THE CONSULTANTS ADDED NONPROFIT ORGANIZATIONS IN EACH COUNTY THAT HAD EITHER A PHONE NUMBER, STREET ADDRESS, OR EMAIL. THC SENT 544 EMAILS AND 376 LETTERS BY FIRST-CLASS MAIL. THE CONSULTANTS MADE PHONE CALLS TO AGENCIES THAT HAD NOT PREVIOUSLY ATTENDED A CHNA MEETING AS WELL AS TO STRATEGIC ORGANIZATIONS THAT SERVE VULNERABLE POPULATIONS AND/OR HAVE A BROAD REACH, E.G., UNITED WAY. THEY FOLLOWED UP WITH EMAILS. THC SENT FLYERS TO HOSPITALS AND TO MEETING HOST SITES FOR POSTING AND DISTRIBUTION. THE CONSULTANTS ALSO POSTED UPCOMING MEETINGS EVERY TWO WEEKS IN THE INTERACT FOR HEALTH E-NEWSLETTER: HEALTH WATCH, WHICH IS EMAILED ACROSS 20 COUNTIES. THE CONSULTANTS SENT FLYERS TO PUBLIC HEALTH DEPARTMENTS TO POST AND DISTRIBUTE. SOME HEALTH DEPARTMENTS PUBLICIZED MEETINGS ON THEIR SOCIAL MEDIA PAGES AND HELD ADDITIONAL MEETINGS. THERE WAS A 229% INCREASE IN MEETING ATTENDANCE, FROM 202 FOR THE 2016 CYCLE TO 463 FOR THE 2019 CYCLE. APPENDIX 1 OF THE CHNA, WHICH IS POSTED TO TRIHEALTH'S WEBSITE, INCLUDES A LIST OF MEETING ATTENDEES AND THE ORGANIZATIONS EACH REPRESENTS.PURPOSE OF MEETINGS THE PURPOSE OF THE MEETINGS WAS TO SOLICIT PUBLIC INPUT. THE DESIRE WAS TO ATTRACT INDIVIDUALS OR NONPROFIT ORGANIZATIONS WITH EXPERIENCE OR KNOWLEDGE TO SHARE, ESPECIALLY ON EMERGING ISSUES NOT CAPTURED BY THE SECONDARY DATA AND FROM THE PERSPECTIVES OF MEDICALLY UNDERSERVED, MINORITY, AND/OR LOW-INCOME POPULATIONS. THE OBJECTIVES WERE TO: * SHARE COUNTY-LEVEL HIGHLIGHTS FROM THE SECONDARY DATA (AND CITY-LEVEL FOR CINCINNATI HEALTH DEPARTMENT MEETINGS) * GATHER DIVERSE PEOPLE TO SHARE THEIR IDEAS -- GENERAL PUBLIC AND COMMUNITY LEADERS * RECEIVE INPUT FROM AGENCIES THAT REPRESENT VULNERABLE POPULATIONS * HEAR CONCERNS AND QUESTIONS ABOUT EXISTING HEALTH/HEALTH-RELATED ISSUES * OBTAIN INFORMATION ABOUT FINANCIAL AND NON-FINANCIAL BARRIERS TO HEALTH CARE * IDENTIFY RESOURCES AVAILABLE LOCALLY TO ADDRESS ISSUES * OBTAIN INSIGHT INTO LOCAL CONDITIONS FROM LOCAL PEOPLE * DISCOVER HEALTH AND HEALTH-RELATED PRIORITIES OF ATTENDEES MEETING FACILITATION A GROUP OF 2-3 CONSULTANTS WENT TO EACH MEETING, DEPENDING ON THE NUMBER OF RSVPS. EACH MEETING FOLLOWED THE SAME FORMAT AND AGENDA. REFRESHMENTS WERE SERVED, AND NAMETAGS WERE USED TO GENERATE A WELCOMING ATMOSPHERE. LOCATIONS WERE SELECTED FOR CONVENIENCE, ACCESS, AND TRUSTED REPUTATION IN THE COMMUNITY. THE FACILITATOR FIRST SHARED GENERAL TRISTATE AND STATE-SPECIFIC HEALTH AND HEALTH-RELATED DATA TO PROVIDE CONTEXT. THE SURVEY QUESTIONS WERE USED, BUT THE FIRST QUESTION ABOUT MOST SERIOUS HEALTH ISSUES WAS ASKED SEPARATELY. THIS TECHNIQUE WAS INTENDED TO CAPTURE FIRST THOUGHTS WITHOUT AN OPPORTUNITY TO BE INFLUENCED BY THE MORE SPECIFIC COUNTY-LEVEL DATA OR BY OTHER ATTENDEES. AFTER THE FIRST QUESTION, THE CONSULTANTS (A MEETING FACILITATOR AND AT LEAST ONE SCRIBE) SHARED A PROFILE OF THE COUNTY, INCLUDING A SUMMARY OF SECONDARY DATA. THE MEETINGS LASTED 90 MINUTES, OF WHICH 60 MINUTES WAS DEVOTED TO THE GROUP'S BRAINSTORMING. AT THE END, EACH PERSON WAS GIVEN 3 COLORED DOTS. THEY PLACED THE DOTS NEXT TO ISSUES THEY PRIORITIZED AS MOST IMPORTANT HEALTH CONDITIONS OR NEEDS OF THE COMMUNITY. THE AGENDA HANDOUT CONTAINED LINKS TO THE SURVEYS. SURVEYS THE CONSULTANTS DEVELOPED THREE TYPES OF SURVEYS: INDIVIDUAL CONSUMER; AGENCY; AND HEALTH DEPARTMENT. THE QUESTIONS REMAINED THE SAME FOR EACH SURVEY. THE AGENCY SURVEYS WERE PUSHED OUT VIA EMAIL AS WELL AS THE LINK WAS SHARED AT THE COMMUNITY MEETINGS. THE HEALTH DEPARTMENT VERSION ALSO REQUESTED THE QUALIFICATIONS OF THE RESPONDENTS. AS REQUIRED BY THE IRS, THE INDIVIDUAL CONSUMER SURVEY WAS ALSO TRANSLATED INTO SPANISH AND ADAPTED FOR MOBILE APPLICATION AT COMMUNITY EVENTS. THE CONSULTANTS USED SURVEYMONKEY TO COLLECT RESPONSES, TABULATE DATA, INTERPRET AND ANALYZE RESULTS, AND CREATE CATEGORIES TO TRACK KEY WORDS AND PHRASES. PAPER COPIES (TRANSLATED) WERE USED WITH SPANISH-SPEAKING FAMILIES, REFUGEES FROM RWANDA, AND AT TREATMENT FACILITIES. BOTH TRIHEALTH OUTREACH MINISTRIES AND SANTA MARIA COMMUNITY SERVICES PROVIDED THE ANSWERS ALREADY TRANSLATED INTO ENGLISH FOR THE CONSULTANTS. A TOTAL OF 113 IMMIGRANT SURVEYS WERE COMPLETED AND RETURNED. SEE APPENDIX 2 FOR THE SURVEY RESPONDENTS WHO IDENTIFIED THEMSELVES. APPENDIX 3 OF THE CHNA, WHICH IS POSTED TO TRIHEALTH'S WEBSITE, HAS A LIST OF HEALTH DEPARTMENT RESPONDENTS WITH THEIR QUALIFICATIONS.SECONDARY DATA SOURCES DATA COLLECTION COUNTY HEALTH RANKINGS (CHR) FORMED THE FOUNDATION FOR DATA COLLECTION WITH ITS COUNTY-LEVEL FOCUS ON HEALTH OUTCOMES, HEALTH FACTORS, HEALTH BEHAVIORS, QUALITY OF LIFE, CLINICAL CARE, PHYSICAL ENVIRONMENT, AND SOCIOECONOMIC FACTORS. ADDITIONAL SOURCES SUPPLEMENTED THE CHR DATA. PUBLICLY AVAILABLE HEALTH STATISTICS AND DEMOGRAPHICS WERE OBTAINED AT THE STATE AND COUNTY LEVEL. THE EPIDEMIOLOGISTS FOR PUBLIC HEALTH - DAYTON & MONTGOMERY COUNTY (PHDMC) VOLUNTEERED TO COLLECT DATA FOR THE STATE OF OHIO AND ITS COUNTIES. THEY INCLUDED DATA THROUGH 2016. OHIO'S 2017 DATA WAS NOT AVAILABLE IN TIME FOR THIS REPORT. THE NUMBER OF DATA MEASURES INCREASED BY 33%, FROM 106 IN 2016 TO 142 IN 2019. DATA SOURCES THE STANDARDS FOR RESEARCHING AND INCLUDING DATA WERE: * COMPARABLE (MEASURES WITH BENCHMARKS SUCH AS HEALTHY PEOPLE 2020 OR STATE/NATIONAL RATES) * COUNTY-LEVEL DATA (ZIP CODE LEVEL PREFERRED BUT RARE) * FOCUS ON HEALTH OUTCOME DATA (PREFERRED OVER SUBJECTIVE SURVEY DATA WHEN BOTH WERE AVAILABLE) * REPRODUCIBLE (NEW UPDATE AVAILABLE WITHIN THREE YEARS OR AT 3-YEAR INTERVALS VS. ONE-TIME) * REPUTABLE SOURCE * TREND DATA AVAILABLE (MORE THAN ONE DATA POINT; 3-5 YEARS PREFERRED) THE CHR WAS AN EXCELLENT STARTING POINT, BUT THE CONSULTANTS DISCOVERED ADDITIONAL SOURCES WITH MORE RECENT DATA AS WELL AS INDICATORS FOR MEASURES NOT COLLECTED BY CHR. THE PREVALENCE OF CERTAIN CANCERS, THE RAPID INCREASE OF HEROIN OVERDOSE DEATHS IN THE REGION, AND ADDITIONAL MORTALITY DATA ARE EXAMPLES OF SUPPLEMENTAL DATA. MANY EXCELLENT SOURCES OF INFORMATION DID NOT HAVE A BREAKDOWN BELOW THE STATE LEVEL OR DID NOT INCLUDE THE ENTIRE REGION. THE CONSULTANTS CONTACTED STATE HEALTH DEPARTMENTS, LOCAL HEALTH DEPARTMENTS, AND LOCAL EXPERTS. THE BIGGEST CHANGE FROM THE PRIOR CYCLE IS THAT THE DEPARTMENT OF HEALTH AND HUMAN SERVICES NO LONGER MAINTAINS THE HEALTH INDICATORS WAREHOUSE AS AN ONLINE SOURCE, AND IT HAD PROVIDED DATA FOR EIGHT KEY MEASURES. PHDMC EPIDEMIOLOGISTS CONSULTED THE OHIO DATA FOR DATA RANGES ENDING WITH 2016 AND ONE PERIOD PRIOR. DUE TO CHARACTER LIMITATION IN THE SOFTWARE, THESE DATA SOURCES COULD NOT BE INCLUDED IN THIS EXPLANATION. HOWEVER, THE DATA SOURCES AND DATES CAN BE FOUND ON PAGES 12 AND 13 OF THE CHNA POSTED ON TRIHEALTH'S WEBSITE."

THIS COMMITTEE RECEIVED AND REVIEWED THE 2019 CHNA REPORT, 2016-2019 EVALUATION REPORT, AND 2020-2022 STRATEGIC IMPLEMENTATION PLAN AND FORMALLY APPROVED ALL THREE DOCUMENTS ON MAY 23, 2019. THE HEALTH PRIORITIES IDENTIFIED IN THE MOST RECENT CHNA WERE: 1. PREVENT AND MANAGE CHRONIC DISEASE -- ASTHMA, DIABETES AND HEART DISEASE. 2. INCREASE ACCESS TO MATERNAL SERVICES -- PRENATAL CARE. 3. PROMOTE CANCER AWARENESS -- BREAST CANCER AND PROSTATE CANCER. BEGINNING IN 2020, INGALLS BEGAN TO ADDRESS THE NEEDS IDENTIFIED IN ITS MOST RECENTLY CONDUCTED CHNA THROUGH EXECUTION OF THE IMPLEMENTATION STRATEGY.

MANY OF INGALLS ACTIONS TO ADDRESS THESE NEEDS ARE INCLUDED IN PROGRAMS THAT ARE NOT LIMITED TO THESE NEEDS. IN 2020, THE SELECTED PRIORITY AREAS (SIGNIFICANT NEEDS) WERE ADDRESSED THROUGH THE FOLLOWING APPROACHES: 1. CARE DELIVERY INITIATIVES. THE CARE DELIVERY INITIATIVES INCLUDE A MYRIAD OF INITIATIVES THAT PROVIDE DIRECT HEALTH AND WELLNESS SERVICES TO COMMUNITY MEMBERS. THESE SERVICES ARE EXECUTED IN MULTIPLE WAYS THAT INCLUDE LEVERAGING INGALLS RESOURCES AND PARTNERING WITH COMMUNITY HEALTH CENTERS AND COMMUNITY-BASED CLINICAL SERVICES. 2. COMMUNITY BENEFIT GRANTS.

POTENTIAL IMPACT: IS IT LIKELY THAT ADDRESSING THIS CRITICAL ISSUE WILL HAVE A SIGNIFICANT IMPACT ON ONE OR MORE SPECIFIC POPULATIONS? DO YOU HAVE REASON TO BELIEVE YOU CAN BE SUCCESSFUL ON THIS ISSUE? ACTIONABLE/FEASIBLE: ARE THERE OPPORTUNITIES FOR ACTION TO ADDRESS THE CRITICAL ISSUE? IS THERE ROOM TO MAKE MEANINGFUL IMPROVEMENT ON THE ISSUE? RESOURCES: ARE RESOURCES (FUNDS, STAFF, & EXPERTISE) EITHER READILY AVAILABLE OR LIKELY RESOURCES CAN BE OBTAINED TO ADDRESS THE CRITICAL ISSUE? ARE THERE RESOURCES THROUGH THE STATE AND COMMUNITY MEMBERS TO WORK ON THE ISSUE? IF NOT, CAN RESOURCES BE ACQUIRED? COMMUNITY READINESS: IS THIS A CRITICAL ISSUE IDENTIFIED AS IMPORTANT BY THE COMMUNITY? ARE PEOPLE IN THE COMMUNITY INTERESTED IN THE ISSUE? IS THERE COMMUNITY MOMENTUM TO MOVE THIS INITIATIVE FORWARD? INTEGRATION: IS THERE OPPORTUNITY FOR COLLABORATION? IS THERE OPPORTUNITY TO BUILD ON EXISTING INITIATIVES? WILL THIS DUPLICATE EFFORTS?

The CHNA steering committee identified validated research questions to be addressed, drafted the individual survey questions, and identified community partners and internal stakeholders to review and provide input to survey development. Collaboration with these groups was crucial to the success of this survey, with valuable feedback provided on survey construction and length. In an effort to reach a culturally diverse community, the survey was translated into Spanish, Chinese and Russian using a culturally sensitive back translation approach. Below outlines the list of community partners involved in survey construction: . Arthritis Foundation - New York Chapter . Clinical & Translational Science Center (CTSC) - Weill Cornell Medicine . New York Presbyterian Hospital . Medicare Rights Center . NYC DOHMH - Office of Policy, Planning and Strategic Data Use . New York City Department of Aging . S.L.E. Lupus Foundation . Self - Help Innovative Senior Center . Isabella Geriatric . Touro College Graduate School of Social Work . Visiting Nurses Services . Charles B. Wang Community Health Center . Spondylitis Association of America . Stamford YMCA . Charter School of Excellence . NY Sports Connection The CHNA was piloted for one month (October 15 - November 16, 2018) among 70 community members to obtain meaningful feedback about the survey and ensure cultural relevancy and health literacy. Survey Administration: The survey was administered via six methods: mail, online, email, social media, QR codes, and in-person. Mailed surveys were sent to existing lists maintained by the HSS Public & Patient Education and the Social Work Department reaching 15,126 community residents. In an effort to reach the medically underserved population, two strategies were employed: 1) An oversampling approach was used in selecting zip codes identified as Medically Underserved Areas (MUA) derived from the U.S. Department of Health and Human Services (https://data.hrsa.gov/tools/shortage-area/mua-find). Household mailing lists were purchased and distributed to a randomly selected sample of 7,500 households of individuals aged 18 years and older in the MUA zip codes within HSS' primary and secondary service areas. 2) The use of Survey Gizmo Panel services to administer the CHNA survey online reaching 591 low income and diverse community residents. Electronic surveys were sent via e-mail to HSS patients and existing email lists maintained by the Public and Patient Education and the Social Work Departments. Surveys were also posted on the HSS website, and social media outlets such as Facebook and Twitter. Lastly, post cards with QR-codes, and in-person surveys were distributed or displayed with instructions in some waiting areas within the hospital, and Ambulatory Care Centers (ACC), while others were administered in existing educational lectures/workshops within the community, and hospital-based programs. HSS facilitated systematic feedback from its varied constituents (i.e. internal stakeholders, community partners including the local public health department, and the public) based on the CHNA results to guide the selection of the health needs and services to address in its community programming. Our approach in identifying, prioritizing and selecting significant health needs is described below. a) Internal Stakeholders - Recognizing that the development of community health programming requires a concerted effort by all members of the organization, we involved various representatives from HSS departments (i.e. Education Institute, Nursing, Social Work, Nutrition, Rehabilitation, Ambulatory Care Centers, Service Excellence and Language Services, Regional Markets, Patient Experience, Medical Staff and Attendings, Development, Public Relations and Marketing, Digital Communications and Quality). The knowledge and experience of staff that have a vested interest in serving the community was essential in identifying and addressing the community's health needs. An internal stakeholder meeting was held on August 13, 2019 with 20 staff in attendance to discuss identified health priorities and explore areas for implementing initiatives, using CHNA results and stakeholders' awareness of community needs to guide the discussion. Discussions were focused on increasing awareness of educational resources and programs available to the community as well as healthcare providers through increased marketing efforts, and implementing digital programs (i.e. exercises, lectures and workshops) to increase program reach. b) Community partners - Feedback from community partners was critical to driving the assessment and selection of public health priorities for the Hospital. Using results of the CHNA survey as the basis for discussion, HSS and its partners exchanged valuable information regarding community needs, explored areas for future collaboration, and solidified a mutual commitment to advancing public health. Furthermore, community partner knowledge of their respective communities helped to identify gaps in community programming - or more specifically, areas where HSS could use its areas of expertise to make a lasting public health impact. The New York City DOHMH was actively involved in our CHNA process by providing input in the development of the survey and identifying significant health needs based on the CHNA results. A NYC DOHMH staff participated in our community partners meeting. See details about the meeting below: A community partners meeting was held on June 19, 2019 with 23 individuals from five community partner organizations in attendance. During the meeting, we shared the CHNA results, elicited feedback and ranked health issues according to the communities they serve. CHNA results were received positively and there was extensive discussion about how results accurately depicted the various communities served and how these results could be used to impact the community at large. Specifically, there were discussions about access to educational programs and ways in which HSS could extend the reach of its programs. c) General public including medically underserved and low-income population - To further HSS' commitment to developing programs that improve the health of our culturally diverse communities, obtaining feedback from the public and medically underserved, low-income, and minority populations was instrumental in driving the Hospital's selection of significant health needs to improve the health of communities where dramatic health disparities exist. Our approach in soliciting input from the public was through community forums. Seven community forums were held to allow community members an opportunity to identify and prioritize health needs that provided HSS with the appropriate direction in selecting its public health priorities. Our marketing strategy for the community forums included distribution of flyers at public and patient education programs and awareness on social media i.e. Facebook. Furthermore, in order to reach low-income population, HSS partnered with Community-Based Organizations (CBOs) serving medically underserved communities to advertise community forums. Specific dates, locations, and attendance for the community forums were as follows: . June 12, 2019 at Stamford Senior Center, Stamford, CT (40 people present) . June 13, 2019 at Building One Community Center, Stamford, CT (15 people present) . June 13, 2019 at HSS Campus, NYC (14 people present) . June 14, 2019 a Webinar (2 people present) . June 17, 2019 at Chinatown Community Center, Visiting Nurse Service of New York, NY (53 people present) . June 20, 2019 at Selfhelp Innovative Senior Center, Flushing, NY (22 people present) . June 26, 2019 at Leonard Covello Senior Center, Carter Burden Network, Manhattan, NY (21 people present) A total of 167 community members participated in the community forums. At each community forum, participants were asked to rank the top 10 health indicators from a list of 25 identified in the CHNA according to order of importance (where 1 ranks the highest). Ranking results were calculated using a simple point system in which each ranking is assigned a point value from 1-10, with the indicator ranked 1 receiving 10 points and the indicator ranked 10 receiving 1 point. The indicators that received the most collective points were identified as the top priorities for the participants at each respective event. d) Additional Input - HSS also solicited additional input from the Greater New York Hospital Association (GNYHA), a trade association to inform the CHNA process. Additional in-person meetings and conference calls were held with GNYHA on 01/12/2018, 05/11/2018, 10/19/18, 12/14/2018, 03/13/2019 and 05/29/2019 to discuss the NYS DOH CSP requirements and federal requirements for the CHNA. e) Public Comments f"

202101349349303530,310538525,"PART V, SECTION B, LINE 11","The Christ Hospital (TCH) conducted a community health needs assessment in Fiscal Year 2019 (July 1, 2018 - June 30, 2019) and sought input from a variety of community partners to gain valuable insight into the overall health and well-being of the community we serve. One of our primary partners in this endeavor was The Health Collaborative, a nonprofit organization that works with its member hospitals on healthcare improvement projects and shares best practices. The Health Collaborative brought local hospitals together for the third time and led the effort to better understand the health needs of the community. Their community report shares data for the Southwest Ohio region (including Greater Dayton and Greater Cincinnati, which include Northern Kentucky and Southeastern Indiana). Service areas of hospitals vary, so this approach provides the most thorough picture of health needs locally and regionally. Along with the data produced by The Health Collaborative, TCH ANALYZED A VARIETY of data sources including public health data, health risk factor surveys, socioeconomic needs assessments, environmental standards and existing programs that had been developed for residents in the Greater Cincinnati region. In addition, TCH also sought to review any written comments received regarding community health needs in the previous assessment. The priorities were determined by the number of votes in the community meetings, the number of mentions on surveys, and areas where data demonstrated performance worse than state or national benchmarks or trending in the wrong direction and impacting at least 16 counties (secondary data). The 5 identified priorities ranked in the top 8 for all primary data sources. The prevalent health concerns identified in the Hamilton County area through this needs assessment include: Substance Abuse Mental Health Access to Care Chronic Heart Disease Healthy Behaviors THROUGH A COLLABORATIVE AND METICULOUS PROCESS, TCH AND ITS COMMUNITY PARTNERS REVIEWED THE MOST PREVALENT HEALTH CONCERNS IN HAMILTON COUNTY AND ESTABLISHED A COURSE OF ACTION. This Implementation Plan focuses on programs, research, and education geared to target the prevalent health concerns facing the residents of Hamilton County. It is TCH's goal to make a measurable impact on the health of our community. We recognize that community health needs are broad and comprehensive. While we bring our expertise and leadership to addressing these needs, we also understand that one entity's expertise cannot be broad enough to be the sole answer. Collaborations and partnerships are key to meeting those needs, and we partner with community organizations that complement our resources. The Implementation Plan was approved by TCH Board of Directors on 10/16/2019. Due to the complexity of substance abuse, the approach to addressing this will be through a partnership and supportive role, which will also include exploration into the underlying problems leading to addiction in order gather insights for prevention and quality treatment. TCH will engage TCH staff with the Hamilton County Heroin Task Force, with a goal to reduce the number of deaths from heroin overdoses. TCH's partnership with the Hamilton County Heroin Task Force will include a group of hospital members who will engage and proactively work in partnership with the Task Force. The main areas of focus and expertise for the Task Force include prevention, treatment, harm reduction, law enforcement, and first responders. TCH will implement a Controlled Substance Policy. The policy will include a definition of controlled substances, guidance on prescription distribution and fulfillment, patient use of controlled substances and appropriate monitoring of suspicious behavior, with a goal of reducing the prescribing of high dose opiates, which will, in turn, help manage the exposure and distribution of opiates and reduce the availability of substances in the community. In July 2019, TCH established an Outpatient Behavioral Health Program, which includes substance abuse treatment with a goal of providing expanded access to treatment and prevention through the hospital Outpatient program. As previously noted, TCH opened Behavioral Health Outpatient Clinic at its Mt. Auburn campus in July 2019 to serve the needs of patients with mental health and substance abuse conditions. This includes partial hospitalization, intensive outpatient services and treatment. TCH will also continue the Comprehensive Primary Care Plus program that includes office based Primary Care Behavioral Health services to holistically address patient needs. These actions will decrease the rate at which patients are re-admitted to the hospital and revisits to the Emergency Department and will provide a much-needed Outpatient Service to the community. The Comprehensive Primary Care Plus program improves access to Primary Care Mental Health professionals in the communities where the patients live. Both actions will work in tandem to increase access to care. The services will also contribute to the overall understanding of community mental health needs, helping to debunk myths and misunderstandings. TCH will work to provide access to Pharmaceuticals to those who are underserved and to those in need with a goal to improve the quality of care for patients who require pharmaceutical treatment. TCH will work in collaboration with St. Vincent DePaul Pharmacy to provide free pharmacy services to the uninsured and underinsured community. TCH will increase medical care access for the homeless by providing after care to the homeless post- discharge from the hospital through collaboration with the Center for Respite Care, Homeless Medical Recovery. The mission is to partner in providing quality holistic medical care to homeless people who need a safe place to heal, while assisting them in breaking the cycle of homelessness and reducing the number of readmissions to the hospital. TCH will expand partnerships with ride sharing platforms to provide assistance to patients needing access to our facilities. Additionally, the establishment of the Outpatient Behavioral Health Program increases access to Outpatient Behavioral Health to vulnerable Hamilton County populations. TCH is working in collaboration with the Center for Respite Care, Homeless Medical Recovery, to provide after care when homeless patients are discharged from the hospital. The mission is to partner in providing quality holistic medical care to homeless people who need a safe place to heal, while assisting them in breaking the cycle of homelessness. TCH will provide access to preventative vascular screenings in the community served. Early detection of heart disease through screenings facilitate access to care, and the likelihood of effective intervention and treatment. Additionally, TCH will provide access to innovative technology by offering clinical trials across a wide spectrum of cardiovascular diseases. Offering CTO clinical trials to the community will create options to prevent further disease progression. The TCH Heart Failure Clinic offers advanced heart treatment options to the Hamilton County and rural communities increasing access to specialty care. TCH will Actively participate and support the Mount Auburn Gardens Initiative and Collaboration (M.A.G.I.C.) by attending meetings and work days to drive community engagement in the gardens to offer more healthy food options as well as be a source of physical activity for Mt. Auburn community members. The efforts for in-kind support will address food scarcity in Mt. Auburn and encourage healthy eating among its residents. TCH will provide financial support and participation in Mt. Auburn's 14-week lifestyle modification intervention program, Do Right! Block by Block campaign, which will help improve the lives of the underserved through education and the development of a sustainable culture of health throughout the community. TCH will provide financial support to the American Heart Association/GO Red for Women and Heart Walk which will provide healthy heart tips and education for the community. TCH will offer free physicals at events to help encourage the community to live active lifestyles and promote exercise. Additionally, smoking cessation efforts will decrease incidence of chronic lung disease and multiple cancers. our ongoing work has yielded favorable results. across all sectors progress is being made to meet our goals: . opioid use across the network is trending down, with a decrease of 29% in opioid doses administered in fiscal year 2020 when compared to our baseline (fy2019). . the network expanded its behavioral health consultants (bhcs) to all primary care offices. for those practices that have a high volume of referrals, availability to the bhcs has increased. as a result, the network has experienced a decrease in average length of stay ('los') in the inpatient psychiatry units, with an average los of 2.9 days at june 30, 2020 (bel"

Hospital officials also believe that WVUH has the outreach and capacity to positively affect residents living within the service area via existing and new strategies. Due to its high importance, WVUH is prioritizing this as one of their three implementation topics. WVUH is also addressing the growing issue of substance use/abuse and mental health issues not only within the service area but in the state of West Virginia as a whole.

The CHNA report identified eleven health needs as significant in the community, as listed below in alphabetical order. - Aging Population - Access to Mental Health Care and Poor Mental Health Status - Access to Primary Health Care Services by Individuals with Limited Resources - Chronic Diseases and Contributing Lifestyle Factors - Environmental Determinants of Health - Homelessness - Navigating a Changing Health Care Provider Environment - Poverty, Financial Hardship, and Basic Needs Insecurity - Safe and Affordable Housing - Socio-Economic, Racial, Cultural, Ethnic, and Linguistic Barriers to Care - Substance Abuse The hospital selected the following significant needs to focus its efforts during the 2018-2020 time period: - Access to Mental Health Care and Poor Mental Health Status, - Access to Primary Health Care Services by Individuals with Limited Resources, - Chronic Diseases and Contributing Lifestyle Factors, - Socio-Economic, Racial, Cultural, Ethnic, and Linguistic Barriers to Care, and - Substance Abuse. A. Access to Mental Health Care and Poor Mental Health Status The 2017 MSBI CHNA found that the mental health status is poor for many residents because of day-to-day pressures, substance abuse, and psychiatric disorders. The supply of mental health providers is insufficient to meet the demand for mental health services. Planned activities to increase access to mental health care and improve the mental health status of community residents are described below. These activities are in addition to the MSBI activities that impact multiple needs. Health professions education The health professions education activities of MSBI respond to both the current and future community health needs for mental health services. MSBI actively participates in over two dozen residency and fellowship programs. Current residency and fellowship programs that are especially related to mental health care services are as follows: - Clinical Psychology Internship Program - Geriatric Psychiatry Fellowship - Psychiatry Residency Mental Health Services Mental health care services are available at the hospital campuses, outpatient facilities, and physician practices throughout the community. As part of the Mount Sinai Health System, integrated resources such as electronic health records facilitate the referral of patients to needed services provided by other Mount Sinai Health System hospitals and health professionals. Specific mental health services available include the following: Mount Sinai's Department of Psychiatry and Behavioral Sciences. The Department of Psychiatry and Behavioral Sciences at Mount Sinai Beth Israel provides comprehensive inpatient, emergency, and outpatient services. Specific programs, centers, and services of the Department include the following: - Outpatient mental health clinic services - Assertive Community Treatment Team (ACT) - Mobile Crisis Services - Addiction Institute of Mount Sinai at Beth Israel (AIMS-BI): - Outpatient Chemical Dependence Clinic/Rehab - Ambulatory Detoxification - Opioid Treatment Programs - Inpatient detoxification and rehabilitation services - Integrated Behavioral Health and Primary Care services - Comprehensive Psychiatric Emergency Service (CPEP) - Inpatient Psychiatric services Outpatient behavioral health services The MSBI outpatient mental health services unit provides comprehensive, whole health care. It includes a broad spectrum of clinical services including comprehensive psychiatric evaluations, medication management, individual and family psychotherapy, and group psychotherapy. It also runs one of the state-approved ACT teams, providing intensive community-based treatment for people with the most severe mental illnesses. AIMS-BI represents the clinical, educational, and research services and programs to treat people with substance use disorders, develop new treatments and gain better understanding of the mechanisms of disease, and to train the next generation of clinicians to care for people with substance use disorders. The clinical services encompass inpatient to outpatient levels of care, including the Opioid Treatment Programs. In addition, behavioral health services are provided within primary care, as well as primary care and specialty care services within behavioral health services. The focus is on assessing and managing all conditions, whether the conditions are behavioral health related or physical health related, and developing strong collaborations and partnerships with physical health and community based providers. Inpatient and Emergency behavioral health services MSBI provides inpatient psychiatric services for people with acute psychiatric illness, focusing on the resolution of acute symptoms and developing a safe plan for return to the home and community upon crisis stabilization. Treatment consists of a wide range of somatic and psychosocial therapies, with a strong multidisciplinary approach. MSBI also provides emergency evaluation services in the CPEP for adults and adolescents. The Mobile Crisis Team is a community-based team of licensed professionals who respond to referrals for urgent crises in the community. The team provides crisis assessment as well as short-term transitional services to ensure that there is connectivity to outpatient and/or community based services. As part of AIMS-BI, inpatient detoxification and rehabilitation services are also provided. The inpatient unit serves as an acute and intensive initial step to safely manage withdrawal symptoms, then subsequent intensive counseling and therapy to begin the road to recovery from substance use. B. Access to Primary Health Care Services by Individuals with Limited Resources The 2017 MSBI CHNA found that New York City has a robust health provider network. However, access to this network can be limited to individuals with limited financial resources, including lack of health insurance and relatively high deductibles/co-pays. Planned activities to increase access to primary health care for individuals with limited resources are described below. These activities are in addition to the MSBI activities that impact multiple needs. Health professions education The health professions education activities of MSBI respond to both the current and future community health needs for primary health care services. MSBI actively participates in over two dozen residency and fellowship programs. Residency and fellowship programs that are especially related to primary health care services are as follows: - Emergency Medicine Residency - Internal Medicine Residency Primary Care Services MSBI provides significant specialty care services for both inpatient and outpatient services, including but not limited to breast health, cardiology, diabetes services, gastroenterology, general surgery, and orthopedics.

202043189349306254,111631796,PART V LINE 5,"The NewYork-Presbyterian Brooklyn Methodist Hospital (NYP-BMH) completed a Community Health Needs Assessment (CHNA) to identify the needs of our community and develop a Community Service Plan (CSP) and detailed implementation plan. Our commitment is to provide quality and compassionate care to our community and the CHNA process provides the ability to focus community-based efforts to address needs. The leaders of NYP-BMH are dedicated to our community with a mission to provide excellent healthcare services in a compassionate and humane manner to the people who live and work in Brooklyn and its surrounding areas. This document outlines the process, priorities, partners, and intended community-based improvement activities for 2019 2021. Our priorities were determined from a data driven process and align with the 2019-2024 New York State Prevention Agenda (NYS PA) and align with the states goal to promote health equity with a focus on physical health, mental health, and social determinants of health. Full reports related to the CHNA process can be found on our website at https://www.nyp.org/about-us/community-affairs/community-service-plans. Partner Involvement & Commitment NYP-BMH collaborated with NewYork-Presbyterian leadership, the New York City Department of Health and Mental Hygiene (DOHMH), Citizens Committee for Children (CCC), Columbia University Irving Medical Center (CUIMC), Weill Cornell Medical College (WCMC), Greater New York Hospital Association (GNYHA), local Community Based Organizations (CBOs), and the New York Academy of Medicine (NYAM) to adopt a community focused process of collecting and analyzing measurable data (quantitative) and views voiced by the community (qualitative) from a variety of sources. The collaborative process ensured significant input from the key stakeholders and local community through questionnaires and focus groups conducted in several languages. This allowed NYP-BMH to develop a focused implementation plan to meet the needs of a targeted community with high disparities. Data Driven Priorities NYP-BMH compiled measurable data and input from the community from numerous sources in order to analyze the health and challenges of our community. The analysis utilized focused neighborhood geography for metrics and included data related to demographics, socioeconomic status, insurance status, social determinants of health, health status, health service utilization, and priority areas from the NY State Prevention Agenda. Community input sources included focus groups and community questionnaires which allowed for a diverse representation of race, language, age, gender identity, and sexual orientation. Data sources include the Citizens Committee for Children Keeping Track Online; Open Data City of New York; Data2Go.NYC; NYC Health Atlas; NYC Mayor Report, the Association for Neighborhood & Housing Development; Behavioral Risk Factor Surveillance System (BRFSS), Claritas; NYC Community Health Profile, State Cancer Profiles, and U.S. Department of Agriculture. The collected data was ranked to provide detailed insight into the communities with high disparities and was then prioritized to determine the highest health priorities for the identified communities. The prioritized data provided insight into community health needs and challenges and allowed NYP-BMH to establish focus areas and goals to align with the NY State Prevention Agenda. In conducting the 2019 CHNA, NYP and its regional hospitals, inclusive of NYP-BMH, collaborated with the New York City Department of Health and Mental Hygiene, Citizens Committee for Children of New York, Columbia University Irving Medical Center, Weill Cornell Medical College, New York Academy of Medicine, and Greater New York Hospital Association. Through these collaborations NYP was able to adopt a community-engagement approach that involved collecting and analyzing qualitative information and quantitative data from a variety of publicly available sources to comprehensively assess the health status of our communities. Each stakeholder added to the ongoing work by providing insight on the publicly available data for the various regions specific to the NYP-BMH high disparity communities, while providing guidance on collecting stakeholder and community feedback and incorporating best practices for the CHNA. NYP-BMH validated and refined the quantitative data results through the use of (1) primary data and community input from facilitation of focus groups and administration of community health need questionnaires (CHNQ) to area residents as well as (2) leveraging other community assessments such as community roundtable discussions hosted by the Cornell Center for Health Equity (CCHEq) in partnership with the Weill Cornell Meyer Cancer Center; and the CCCs from Strengths to Solutions: An Asset Based Approach to Meeting Community Needs in Brownsville. NYP-BMH engaged NYAM to facilitate focus groups of community members to obtain their perspectives on the health and needs of the community at large. NYP-BMH partnered with several community-based organizations to host these six focus groups: 1 NYP-BMH Community Advisory Board 2 CAMBA 3 Downtown Brooklyn Neighborhood Alliance 4 Caribbean Womens Health Association 5 Brooklyn Pride Center 6 Shorefront Y NYP-BMH engaged in a dynamic data collection and analytic process to ensure that the community and its needs were well represented throughout the CHNA development process. NYP-BMH utilized both quantitative and qualitative data to create a picture of the health needs of the Brooklyn community. The quantitative data focused to measurable indicators at the Neighborhood Tabulation Area (NTA) for the community, while the qualitative data focused to the primary perspectives and input from the community members obtained through questionnaires and focus groups. Additionally, NYP-BMH utilized numerous additional data sources to provide a robust picture of the community including a roundtable discussion and cancer survey in partnership with Cornell Center for Health Equity (CCHEq) and HICCC respectively, and in-depth analysis from CCC of the Brownsville neighborhood. Quantitative data was gathered, validated, and refined using (1) community input from facilitation of focus groups and administration of community health need questionnaires (CHNQs) to area residents as well as (2) leveraging other community assessments performed in the community. The community input from multiple sources allowed for a comprehensive representation of our community inclusive of multiple languages, socioeconomic statuses, culture, race, age, and gender identity. Summaries of each qualitative input source is included below, and additional details can be found in the Community Health Needs Assessment at https://www.nyp.org/about-us/communityaffairs/community-service-plans. New York Academy of Medicine (NYAM) Focus Groups & Questionnaires NYP-BMH partnered with NYAM to conduct CHNQs and community member focus groups. The CHNQs were conducted at community events, with focus group participants and online, and were administered in several languages. The CHNQs were also distributed across the community of focus to ensure that respondents from all demographics were represented in the response rate. NYAM completed six focus groups and received 234 responses to the CHNQs with 59.8% being completed at in person events, 27.8% being completed online, and 12.4% completed by the NYP-BMH Community Advisory Board. NYP-BMH Community Health Survey In addition to the efforts conducted by NYAM, NYP-BMH sponsored a Community Health Survey which appeared in an edition of their community health magazine, Thrive, which is mailed to 250,000 households in Brooklyn.

202043189349306254,111631796,PART V LINE 11,"Based on the prioritization process, NYP-BMH has numerous indicators as the highest priorities for the community. These indicators can be broadly grouped into: 1 Womens Health 2 Obesity and Chronic Disease 3 Mental Health and Substance Use 4 Human Immunodeficiency Virus (HIV) 5 Cancer To ensure the community service plan is focused on initiatives that impact the highest communities of disparity, NYP-BMH undertook an additional analysis of community health need at the Neighborhood Tabulation Area (NTA) geography based upon a composite of 29 different indicators. Indicators were carefully selected, across five domains: demographics, income, insurance, access to care, and New York State Department of Health Prevention Agenda Priorities. The objective was to identify the specific NTAs where there is a higher health need and/or a higher expectation of required resources. The defined communitys 32 ZIP codes were cross-walked to 49 NTAs and then categorized into four quartiles based on identified disparities. Additional analysis was undertaken for the 24 NTAs of higher disparity in quartiles 3 and 4, meaning most high need. Based on the data process of analytics and prioritization, NYP-BMH will target efforts in the Crown Heights neighborhood of Brooklyn to allow our teams to invest and concentrate efforts and directly impact a high need community within the three-years of the service plan. The data outlined allowed the team to identify a community of focus as well as priority areas to impact the healthcare of the most vulnerable populations. The priority areas differ from the prior 2016-2018 Community Service Plan which Included (a.) Prevent Chronic Disease: Focus on Diabetes, (b.) Prevent Chronic Disease: Focus on Childhood Obesity, and (c.) Promote a Healthy and Safe Environment; Reducing Fall Risk Among Most Vulnerable Populations. NYP-BMH is committed to serving the community by providing a wide range of health care services and activities that are important and provide benefit to our community members. Our assessment shows that there are numerous and significant needs, and the hospital has chosen a selection of these needs in order to concentrate resources and efforts and focus evaluations on those initiatives which we believe we can most effectively execute on and which will provide the largest impact to our community. In addition, the prioritization model applied to significant community needs was rooted in the quantitative as well as the qualitative voice of the community helping to ensure that our selection was aligned with those needs ranked highly by our community members. The selected initiatives and resulting Community Service Plan were reviewed and approved by senior leaders, hospital community advisory board members, and our CHNA Steering Committee in the context of our organizational mission, our clinical strengths, and partnerships. 2019-2021 Community Service Plan Initiatives: Prevent Chronic Disease Focus Area 1: Reduce Obesity & the Risk of Chronic Disease Goal 1.1 - Increase access to healthy and affordable foods and beverages Objective Utilize a culturally sensitive process to empower organizations to focus on nutrition and physical activity, Promote wellness through community based partnerships, and address food insecurities. INTERVENTION EXPLAINED: Choosing healthy & active lifestyles for kids (CHALK) is New York-Presbyterian's obesity prevention program. CHALK aims to address obesity using a socio ecological model as its theoretical framework. The program will drive system and environmental changes that produce long lasting improvements around wellness in the targeted community of Crown Heights, where food insecurity and obesity rates are high. Promote Healthy Women, Infants and Children Focus Area 1: Maternal & Womens Health Goal 1.1. - Increase use of primary and preventative health care services by women of all ages with a focus on women of reproductive age Objective: This program aims to reduce racial, ethnic, and geographic disparities in maternal and child health outcomes, and promote health equity for maternal and child health populations. INTERVENTION EXPLAINED: Promote healthy women infants and children by providing peer and expert support to pregnant persons in order to promote optimal infant feeding, childbirth practices, and parental mental well-being. This program seeks to impact at least 10% of NYP Brooklyn Methodist Hospital birthing population, which amounts to over 500 expectant persons. Prevent Communicable Diseases Focus Area 2: Human Immunodeficiency Virus (HIV) and Focus Area 4: Hepatitis C (HCV) Focus Area 2: Goal 2.2 - Increase Viral Suppression Focus Area 4: Goal 4.1 - Increase the number of persons treated for Hepatitis C Virus (HCV), Goal 4.2 Reduce the number of new HCV cases among people who inject drugs INTERVENTION EXPLAINED: Ending the HIV and HCV epidemics in NYS is now a legitimate possibility and NYP is playing a leading role in this effort. The NYP ETE Initiative would create a multi-campus HIV and HCV elimination strategy that would a) increase HIV and HCV testing and linkage to care, b) re-engage HIV+ and HCV+ individuals to care, and c) expand effective HIV and HCV prevention services, like PrEP and MAT. Utilizing existing multi-campus dashboards an NYP Pilot would link, in real-time, all new HIV and HCV diagnoses, those (thousands) individuals out of care, and those in need of preventive services. Expanded deployment of a Health Priority Specialist in existing sites, like NYP Emergency Departments (NYP ED), would be the effector arm for the intervention. A major investment in a Mobile Medical Unit (MMU) would also help bring these needed services to communities surrounding our medical centers and additionally act as the nidus for new PrEP program growth at NYP-BMH. Collectively this multimodal, evidence based intervention could help NYP end the HIV and HCV epidemics in our targeted communities. Prevent Chronic Disease Focus Area 4: Chronic Disease Preventive Care and Management Goal 4.3 Promote evidence-based care to prevent and manage chronic diseases including asthma, arthritis, cardiovascular disease, diabetes and prediabetes and obesity Objective: The 30-Day Transitional care initiative is used by the care team as a time frame required to provide care coordination. INTERVENTION EXPLAINED: The American College of Physicians, Society of General Internal Medicine, Society of Hospital Medicine, American Geriatrics Society, American College of Emergency Physicians, and Society of Academic Emergency Medicine have worked together to develop consensus standards for transitional care.(Snow et. al. 2009) The coordination of care across the health care continuum is crucial to the implementation, management, and evaluation of a patients treatment plan. The transfer and receipt of patient information between different levels of care and locations ensure continuity and promote successful treatment. Unfortunately, breakdowns in these processes, as well as the ineffective handoff of information between care providers, can lead to poor transitions and miscommunication among providers (Mansukhani et. al.2015) NYP-BMHs 30-Day Transitional care initiative is used by the care team as a time frame required to provide care coordination. The Transitions Care Team (TCT) identifies high utilizers and/or patients, who are 18 years of age and older, with a high LACE score, from Medicaid lists. Between 2017 and 2018, the NYP-BMH care team has touched 2215 distinct patients across 5146 visits. This program will continue to identify and treat patients while ensuring continuity of care. Promote Well-Being & Prevent Mental & Substance Use Disorders Focus Area: 1 Strengthen opportunities to build well-being and resilience across the lifespan Goal 1.1: Strengthen opportunities to build well-being and resilience across the lifespan Objective: Expand mental health first aid trainings to expand mental health education, increase prevention and address stigma INTERVENTION EXPLAINED: Mental health first aid (MHFA) is an international, evidence based, training program proven to be an effective intervention for mental health education, prevention and addressing stigma."

IN ADDITION, MERCY HAS COMPLETED AN UPDATED COMMUNITY HEALTH NEEDS ASSESSMENT AND IMPLEMENTATION STRATEGY IN JUNE 2018. THIS UPDATED VERSION IS AVAILABLE ON THE MERCY HEALTH SERVICES WEBSITE.THE SISTERS OF MERCY WERE ORIGINALLY FOUNDED IN DUBLIN, IRELAND TO CARE FOR HOMELESS, ABUSED AND NEGLECTED WOMEN AND CHILDREN. THIS TIMELESS LEGACY INFLUENCES MERCY'S APPROACH TO FOCUS SPECIAL ATTENTION ON CERTAIN TARGET POPULATIONS, SUCH AS INFANTS, WOMEN, AND THE IMPOVERISHED. MERCY DEFINED ITS CHNA COMMUNITY BENEFIT SERVICE AREA AS PART OF ITS CHNA PROCESS FOR THE 2013 TAX YEAR. DURING A SERIES OF MEETINGS AS PART OF THE CHNA PROCESS FOR 2013, MERCY'S COMMUNITY BENEFITS COMMITTEE DISCUSSED THE SOCIO-ECONOMIC AND HEALTH PARAMETERS THAT DEFINE MERCY'S ""COMMUNITY"". FOLLOWING A DATA DRIVEN PROCESS (SEE: MERCY MEDICAL CENTER 2013 CHNA), THE COMMITTEE APPROPRIATELY DECIDED THAT MERCY SHOULD FOCUS ITS LIMITED RESOURCES ON COMMUNITY BENEFIT ACTIVITIES TO IMPROVE POPULATION HEALTH WITHIN 18 COMMUNITY STATISTICAL AREAS (CSAS) THAT REPRESENT DOWNTOWN AND THE INNER-CITY NEIGHBORHOODS EAST, WEST, AND SOUTH OF THE CITY CENTER. THE COMMITTEE BELIEVES THAT THIS DEFINITION OF MERCY'S COMMUNITY, WHICH REPRESENTS A SMALLER GEOGRAPHIC AREA THAN THE CBSA PREVIOUSLY UTILIZED BY MERCY, WILL FOSTER GREATER COORDINATION, BETTER STRATEGIC PARTNERSHIPS AND IMPROVED MEASUREMENT OF OUTCOMES, IN PARTICULAR WITH RESPECT TO THE TARGETED POPULATIONS INCLUDING LOWER-INCOME MOTHERS AND THEIR BABIES AND INDIVIDUALS EXPERIENCING HOMELESSNESS. IN ADDITION, AS PART OF THE CHNA PROCESS FOR 2013 AND 2016, MERCY REPRESENTATIVES SOUGHT INPUT REGARDING ITS PROPOSED COMMUNITY BENEFIT SERVICE AREA FROM COMMUNITY LEADERS, PUBLIC HEALTH EXPERTS, AND REPRESENTATIVES OF MINORITY, LOW INCOME, AND MEDICALLY UNDERSERVED POPULATIONS. THE CONSENSUS FEEDBACK FROM THESE DISCUSSIONS VALIDATES MERCY'S CHNA COMMUNITY BENEFIT SERVICE AREA DEFINITION. IN ACCORDANCE WITH IRS REGULATIONS GOVERNING CHNAS, MERCY'S DEFINED CHNA COMMUNITY INCLUDES ""MEDICALLY UNDERSERVED, LOW INCOME OR MINORITY POPULATIONS"". THE FOLLOWING COMMUNITY STATISTICAL AREAS (CSAS) MAKE UP MERCY'S CHNA SERVICE AREA: CANTON, CLIFTON-BEREA, DOWNTOWN/SETON HILL, FELLS POINT, GREATER ROSEMONT, GREENMOUNT EAST, HARBOR EAST/LITTLE ITALY, INNER HARBOR/FEDERAL HILL, MADISON/EAST END, MIDTOWN, OLDTOWN/MIDDLE EAST, PATTERSON PARK NORTH & EAST, POPPLETON/THE TERRACES/HOLLINS MARKET, SANDTOWN-WINCHESTER/HARLEM PARK, SOUTH BALTIMORE, SOUTHWEST BALTIMORE, UPTON/DRUID HEIGHTS, AND WASHINGTON VILLAGE/PIGTOWN.ADDITIONALLY, SINCE THE IMPLEMENTATION OF THE NEW MARYLAND ALL-PAYER MODEL WHICH FOLLOWED THE COMPLETION OF MERCY'S 2013 CHNA, MERCY IS INCREASINGLY FOCUSED ON HIGH-UTILIZER PATIENTS, INCLUDING THOSE WITHIN OUR PREVIOUSLY-DEFINED CHNA COMMUNITY BENEFIT SERVICE AREA. AS EXPECTED, THERE IS SIGNIFICANT GEOGRAPHIC OVERLAP OF HIGH UTILIZER PATIENT ORIGIN AND OUR PREVIOUSLY-DEFINED CBSA, ESPECIALLY IN THE IMMEDIATE AREAS WHERE THE MOST VULNERABLE POPULATIONS RESIDE. THE SIMILARITY OF GEOGRAPHY PRESENTS AN ONGOING OPPORTUNITY TO INCREASE ALIGNMENT BETWEEN MERCY'S COMMUNITY BENEFIT ACTIVITIES AND MERCY'S FOCUSED POPULATION HEALTH INTERVENTIONS TO REDUCE POTENTIALLY AVOIDABLE UTILIZATION AS IDENTIFIED IN MERCY'S HSCRC STRATEGIC HOSPITAL TRANSFORMATION PLAN. MERCY BELIEVES OUR POPULATION HEALTH STRATEGIES ARE INTEGRAL TO OUR CHNA FOCUS AREAS:-IMPROVING ACCESS TO CARE AND THE FREQUENCY OF CARE FOR OUR HOMELESS NEIGHBORS.-IDENTIFYING TACTICS AND STRATEGIES TO IMPROVE BIRTH OUTCOMES AND PRE-NATAL CARE FOR EXPECTANT MOTHERS.-EXPANDING ACCESS TO PREVENTATIVE COMMUNITY HEALTH SERVICES SUCH AS PRIMARY CARE TO IMPROVE OUTCOMES-PROVIDING SUPPORT TO VICTIMS OF VIOLENCE AND ADDICTION-PROVIDE TARGETED HEALTH EDUCATION OPPORTUNITIES TO THE PUBLIC AND SUPPORT THE EDUCATION OF FUTURE PHYSICIANS,-ADVANCE PRACTICE PROVIDERS, NURSES, AND OTHER HEALTHCARE WORKERS WHO IN-TURN SERVE THE COMMUNITY."

THIS RANKED HIGH IN THE PRIORITIZATION PROCESS, AFTER ACCESS TO CARE AND MENTAL HEALTH. DIABETES WAS ORIGINALLY CONSIDERED A SEPARATE ISSUE BUT THE COMMUNITY BENEFIT COMMITTEE COMBINED IT WITH OBESITY, FOOD & NUTRITION. THE COMMITTEE AGREED THAT THESE THREE SIGNIFICANT HEALTH NEEDS HAD ENOUGH CORRELATION AND A ""CAUSE AND EFFECT"" IMPLICATION AMONG THEM THAT BY ADDRESSING ONE OR TWO, WE COULD ESSENTIALLY ADDRESS ALL THREE. CONCERNS ABOUT FOOD AND NUTRITION, A ROOT CAUSE OF DIABETES AND OBESITY, WERE RAISED BOTH IN THE DATA AND THROUGH COMMUNITY INPUT. CONCERNS ABOUT THE COST, AVAILABILITY, AND EASE OF PREPARING HEALTHY FOOD COMPARED TO ABUNDANT, CHEAP, AND QUICK UNHEALTHY OPTIONS WERE RAISED AT ALL OF THE FOCUS GROUPS AND THE COMMUNITY FORUM.THIS NEED IS BEING ADDRESSED BY:1. IMPROVING THE PERCENTAGE OF PATIENTS SEEN AT LA AMISTAD FEDERALLY QUALIFIED HEALTH CENTER (FQHC) WITH WELL CONTROLLED DIABETES, AS MEASURED BY AN A1C MEASUREMENT BELOW NINE (9)2.

WE WERE INTERESTED IN LEARNING ABOUT AND IMPROVING BOTH THE PROCESS THAT WAS USED PREVIOUSLY AND THE CONCLUSIONS THAT WERE DRAWN IN THAT ASSESSMENT. A TOTAL OF SEVEN EXTERNAL EVALUATORS PROVIDED DETAILED WRITTEN FEEDBACK ON THE 2015 ASSESSMENT. THEY INCLUDED REPRESENTATIVES FROM PUBLIC HEALTH, NONPROFIT ORGANIZATIONS, HEALTH ADVOCACY ORGANIZATIONS AND HEALTH CARE PROVIDERS. REVIEWERS WERE ASKED TO IDENTIFY KEY STRENGTHS AND WEAKNESSES OF THE PREVIOUS ASSESSMENTS. FOR THE PURPOSES OF THE ASSESSMENT, WE USED FOUR QUALITATIVE DATA COLLECTION METHODS: KEY STAKEHOLDER INTERVIEWS WITH COMMUNITY AND HEALTH LEADERS. A TOTAL OF 44 INTERVIEWS WERE COMPLETED WITH INDIVIDUALS WHO REPRESENTED PUBLIC HEALTH, GOVERNMENT, PUBLIC SAFETY, DIRECT SERVICE, PUBLIC EDUCATION AND ADVOCACY ORGANIZATIONS. INTERVIEWEES ALSO REPRESENTED A RANGE OF GEOGRAPHIC AREAS AND ALL FOUR COUNTIES IN OUR COMMUNITY WERE WELL REPRESENTED. 7 OF THE INTERVIEWS WERE WITH STAFF MEMBERS OF THE TRI-COUNTY HEALTH DEPARTMENT, WHICH IS ONE OF THE LARGEST PUBLIC HEALTH DEPARTMENTS IN THE STATE AND COVERS ADAMS, ARAPAHOE AND DOUGLAS COUNTIES. THE LIST OF ORGANIZATIONS INTERVIEWED IS IDENTIFIED IN THE CHNA AND THE NAMES OF THE INTERVIEWEES ARE ON FILE. FOCUS GROUPS IN EACH OF THE FOUR COUNTIES IN OUR COMMUNITY. WE FOCUSED ON RECRUITING LOW-INCOME AND VULNERABLE POPULATIONS TO THE FOCUS GROUPS THAT WE CONDUCTED. WE CONDUCTED 6 FOCUS GROUPS AND HAD A TOTAL OF 48 PARTICIPANTS. WE CONDUCTED 2 GROUPS IN DENVER COUNTY, 1 IN DOUGLAS COUNTY, AND 3 IN LOCATIONS WHERE BOTH ADAMS AND ARAPAHOE COUNTY RESIDENTS COULD PARTICIPATE. PARENT SURVEY IN BOTH ENGLISH AND SPANISH. OUR SURVEY TARGETED PARENTS AND CAREGIVERS OF CHILDREN AGES 0-17 WHO LIVE IN THEIR HOME. PARTICIPANTS WERE RECRUITED VIA CHILDREN'S HOSPITAL EMAIL LISTS AND SOCIAL MEDIA AND THROUGH EMAIL CAMPAIGNS WITH OUR PARTNERS. ADDITIONALLY, WE WORKED CLOSELY WITH THE COMMUNITY CAMPUS PARTNERSHIP (CCP), A NONPROFIT ORGANIZATION THAT FOSTERS COLLABORATIONS BETWEEN THE ANSCHUTZ MEDICAL CAMPUS AND THE SURROUNDING AURORA COMMUNITY NEIGHBORHOODS TO IMPROVE THE HEALTH AND ECONOMIC WELL-BEING OF THE AURORA COMMUNITY. MEMBERS OF THE CCP'S RESIDENT LEADERSHIP COUNCIL, WHO ALL RESIDE NEAR THE MAIN CAMPUS, WERE RECRUITED TO CONDUCT THE SURVEYS IN ADDITIONAL LANGUAGES AND TRANSLATE THE RESPONSES. THEY GREATLY EXPANDED OUR ACCESS TO NON-ENGLISH SPEAKERS WHO RESIDE IN THE THREE ZIP CODES CLOSE TO THE HOSPITAL. IN 2018, ADDITIONAL DEMOGRAPHIC QUESTIONS WERE ADDED TO THE PARENT SURVEY. THIS ALLOWED US TO ANALYZE THE RESULTS IN A MORE IN-DEPTH MANNER. FIRST, AN ANALYSIS OF THE TOP-RATED ISSUES/CONCERNS WAS PERFORMED WITH DIFFERENCES NOTED BETWEEN THE ENGLISH LANGUAGE AND SPANISH LANGUAGE SURVEY RESPONSES. NEXT, WE SORTED RESULTS BY COUNTY AS WELL AS BY INCOME LEVELS TO DETERMINE SIGNIFICANT VARIATIONS IN THE ISSUES IDENTIFIED AS TOP CONCERNS. THIS APPROACH PERMITTED THE TEAM TO GAIN INSIGHT INTO A LARGE CROSS SECTION OF THE POPULATION. IN ALL, 582 RESIDENTS OF OUR FOUR-COUNTY COMMUNITY RESPONDED TO THE SURVEY; 409 IN ENGLISH AND 173 IN SPANISH. THE FOUR COUNTIES WERE FAIRLY EQUALLY REPRESENTED IN THE TOTAL RESPONSES. ONLINE PROVIDER SURVEY. THE PROVIDER SURVEY WAS A NEW ADDITION TO OUR DATA COLLECTION EFFORTS THIS YEAR AND ALLOWED US TO HEAR DIRECTLY FROM HEALTH CARE WORKERS ABOUT THE COMMUNITY NEEDS THEY ARE SEEING IN THEIR PRACTICES. WE HAD 108 PROVIDER RESPONSES FROM PHYSICIANS, SCHOOL NURSES AND OTHER HEALTH CARE PROVIDERS. UNDERSERVED POPULATION INPUT. AS PART OF THIS ASSESSMENT, WE PRIORITIZED GETTING INPUT FROM UNDERSERVED POPULATIONS INCLUDING LOW-INCOME AND MINORITY GROUPS AND GROUPS WHOSE PRIMARY LANGUAGE IS NOT ENGLISH. STAKEHOLDER INTERVIEWS WERE CONDUCTED WITH LEADERS OF ORGANIZATIONS THAT SERVE AND/OR ADVOCATE FOR UNDERSERVED GROUPS. SPECIFIC ORGANIZATIONS IDENTIFIED IN THE CHNA. THE TEAM WORKED WITH COMMUNITY PARTNERS TO ENSURE THAT THE PARENT SURVEY REACHED A SOCIO-ECONOMICALLY AND ETHNICALLY DIVERSE POPULATION. 60% OF OUR RESPONDENTS HAVE A HOUSEHOLD INCOME THAT IS LESS THAN THE STATE'S AVERAGE HOUSEHOLD INCOME OF $75,000 AND 21% HAVE HOUSEHOLD INCOMES OF LESS THAN $25,000. 65% OF OUR RESPONDENTS ARE ETHNIC MINORITIES.

THE 2018 COMMUNITY NEEDS HEALTH ASSESSMENT, WHICH SUMMARIZES THESE FINDINGS, CAN BE FOUND AT HTTPS://WWW.CHILDRENSCOLORADO.ORG/COMMUNITY/COMMUNITYHEALTH/COMMUNITY-HEAL TH-NEEDS-ASSESSMENT/.

THE PLAN OUTLINES OUR THREE-YEAR GOALS FOR EACH OF THOSE PRIORITIES AND DETAILS THE STRATEGIES WE PLAN TO USE TO TACKLE THESE COMPLEX ISSUES. TO CREATE THE IMPLEMENTATION PLAN, CHILDREN'S HOSPITAL COLORADO USED THE INFORMATION GATHERED THROUGH THE COMMUNITY HEALTH NEEDS ASSESSMENT AS THE MAJOR SOURCE OF INFORMATION AND INCORPORATED ADDITIONAL INSIGHTS FROM PLANNING DISCUSSIONS WITH COMMUNITY PARTNERS. WE ALSO DECIDED TO FOCUS OUR WORK ON FIVE TYPES OF ACTIVITIES. WE BELIEVE THESE ACTIVITIES HAVE THE MOST POTENTIAL TO IMPACT CHILD HEALTH OUTCOMES AND WILL MAKE OUR WORK MORE EFFICIENT AND EFFECTIVE. STRATEGIES INCLUDE; EDUCATION AND TRAINING, DIRECT SERVICES AND SUPPORT, SCREENING, REFERRALS AND NAVIGATION, AND POLICY AND ADVOCACY. A SERIES OF FIVE STRATEGY SESSIONS WAS CONVENED WITH PROVIDERS, COMMUNITY HEALTH STRATEGISTS AND ADMINISTRATORS. EACH OF THESE SESSIONS FOCUSED ON ONE OF THE FIVE PRIORITY AREAS THAT HAD BEEN SELECTED THROUGH THE CHNA. WITH THE HELP OF AN OUTSIDE FACILITATOR, TEAMS DEVELOPED VISION STATEMENTS, GOALS AND OBJECTIVES FOR EACH PRIORITY. THE OBJECTIVES SELECTED ARE ALL QUANTIFIABLE AND TIME-LIMITED, WHICH WILL ALLOW FOR EFFECTIVE EVALUATION OF OUR EFFORTS IN THE FUTURE.

THE STUDY AREA INCLUDED 19 COUNTIES ACROSS CENTRAL, NORTHEASTERN, AND SOUTH CENTRAL PENNSYLVANIA WHICH REPRESENT THE COLLECTIVE SERVICE AREAS OF THE COLLABORATING HOSPITALS. TO DISTINGUISH UNIQUE SERVICE AREAS AMONG HOSPITALS AND FOSTER COOPERATION WITH LOCAL COMMUNITY PARTNERS TO IMPACT HEALTH NEEDS, REGIONAL RESEARCH AND LOCAL REPORTING WAS DEVELOPED. THE COLLABORATING HEALTH SYSTEMS AGREED THAT BY COORDINATING EFFORTS TO IDENTIFY COMMUNITY HEALTH NEEDS ACROSS THE REGION, THE HEALTH SYSTEMS WOULD CONSERVE COMMUNITY RESOURCES WHILE DEMONSTRATING LEADERSHIP IN CONVENING LOCAL COMMUNITY PARTNERS TO ADDRESS COMMON PRIORITY NEEDS. BEST PRACTICES IN COMMUNITY HEALTH IMPROVEMENT DEMONSTRATE THAT FOSTERING ""COLLECTIVE IMPACT"" IS AMONG THE MOST SUCCESSFUL WAYS TO AFFECT THE HEALTH OF A COMMUNITY. COLLECTIVE IMPACT IS ACHIEVED BY COMMITTING A DIVERSE GROUP OF STAKEHOLDERS TOWARD A COMMON GOAL OR ACTION, PARTICULARLY TO IMPACT DEEP ROOTED SOCIAL OR HEALTH NEEDS. BY TAKING A COLLABORATIVE APPROACH TO THE CHNA, GEISINGER, ALLIED SERVICES INTEGRATED HEALTH SYSTEM, AND EVANGELICAL COMMUNITY HOSPITAL ARE LEADING THE WAY TO IMPROVE THE HEALTH OF COMMUNITIES IN CENTRAL, NORTHEASTERN, AND SOUTH CENTRAL PENNSYLVANIA. THE FOLLOWING PAGES DESCRIBE THE PROCESS AND RESEARCH METHODS USED IN THE FY2019 CHNA AND THE FINDINGS THAT PORTRAY THE HEALTH STATUS OF THE COMMUNITIES WE SERVE AND OUTLINE OPPORTUNITIES TO WORK WITH OUR COMMUNITY PARTNERS TO ADVANCE HEALTH AMONG ALL RESIDENTS ACROSS OUR SERVICE AREAS. THE CHNA WAS OVERSEEN BY A PLANNING COMMITTEE OF REPRESENTATIVES FROM EACH HEALTH SYSTEM, AS WELL AS A REGIONAL ADVISORY COMMITTEE OF REPRESENTATIVES FROM EACH HOSPITAL. COMMUNITY ENGAGEMENT COMMUNITY ENGAGEMENT WAS AN INTEGRAL PART OF THE CHNA. WEBINARS WERE HELD IN OCTOBER AND NOVEMBER 2017 TO ANNOUNCE THE ONSET OF THE CHNA AND ENCOURAGE BROAD PARTICIPATION ACROSS THE REGION. THROUGHOUT OCTOBER AND NOVEMBER 2017, A KEY INFORMANT SURVEY WAS SENT TO APPROXIMATELY 1,000 REPRESENTATIVES OF HEALTH AND HUMAN SERVICE ORGANIZATIONS, RELIGIOUS INSTITUTIONS, CIVIC ASSOCIATIONS, BUSINESSES, ELECTED OFFICIALS AND OTHER COMMUNITY REPRESENTATIVES. PARTNER FORUMS WERE HELD THROUGHOUT THE REGION IN JANUARY 2018 TO BRING TOGETHER THESE PARTNERS TO REVIEW RESEARCH FINDINGS AND PROVIDE FEEDBACK ON THE MOST PRESSING COMMUNITY HEALTH NEEDS. IN MARCH AND APRIL 2018, FOCUS GROUPS WITH SENIORS WERE HELD TO BETTER UNDERSTAND CHALLENGES AND OPPORTUNITIES TO IMPROVING HEALTH AMONG HIGH RISK POPULATIONS. COMMUNITY FORUMS ARE PLANNED FOR FALL 2018 TO PRESENT CHNA FINDINGS AND IMPLEMENTATION PLANS TO COMMUNITY RESIDENTS AND PROVIDE A FORUM FOR DIALOGUE ABOUT ADDRESSING COMMUNITY HEALTH NEEDS. CHNA METHODOLOGY THE FY2019 CHNA WAS CONDUCTED FROM SEPTEMBER 2017 TO APRIL 2018 AND USED BOTH PRIMARY AND SECONDARY RESEARCH TO ILLUSTRATE AND COMPARE HEALTH TRENDS AND DISPARITIES ACROSS THE REGION. PRIMARY RESEARCH WAS USED TO SOLICIT INPUT FROM KEY COMMUNITY STAKEHOLDERS REPRESENTING THE BROAD INTERESTS OF THE COMMUNITY, INCLUDING EXPERTS IN PUBLIC HEALTH AND INDIVIDUALS REPRESENTING MEDICALLY UNDERSERVED, LOW-INCOME AND MINORITY POPULATIONS. FOCUS GROUPS AND INTERVIEWS WERE USED TO COLLECT IN-DEPTH INSIGHT FROM HEALTH CONSUMERS REPRESENTING MEDICALLY UNDERSERVED OR HIGH RISK POPULATIONS. EXISTING DATA SOURCES, INCLUDING PUBLIC HEALTH STATISTICS, DEMOGRAPHIC AND SOCIAL MEASURES, AND HEALTHCARE UTILIZATION, WERE COLLECTED AND ANALYZED TO IDENTIFY HEALTH TRENDS ACROSS HOSPITAL SERVICE AREAS.

PROGRAMMING AND CLINICAL SERVICES WITHIN THESE PRIORITY AREAS IMPACT THE POPULATIONS OF MATERIAL/INFANT HEALTH AND SENIOR HEALTH AND ARE THEREBY SERVED THROUGH ALL APPROPRIATE HEALTH IMPROVEMENT EFFORTS. BELOW ARE SYSTEMWIDE PROGRAMS OFFERED BY GEISINGER TO FULFILL COMMUNITY NEEDS THAT WERE IDENTIFIED IN THE HOSPITAL'S MOST RECENT CHNA. SOME PROGRAMS ARE COMPLETELY OPERATED OR FUNDED BY GEISINGER AND SOME ARE OFFERED IN COOPERATION WITH LOCAL HEALTH AND HUMAN SERVICE AGENCIES. FOR MORE SPECIFIC NEEDS FOUND IN OUR LOCAL COMMUNITIES, WE OFFER PROGRAMS TO SERVE PATIENTS CLOSE TO HOME. THE TOP THREE NEEDS IDENTIFIED IN THE MOST RECENT AND/OR PAST CHNA SURVEYS FALL INTO ONE OF THREE COMMUNITY NEED CATEGORIES: 1)IMPROVING ACCESS TO HEALTHCARE: THE MOST SIGNIFICANT NEED IDENTIFIED WAS FOR BETTER, FASTER, MORE CONVENIENT AND LESS COSTLY ACCESS TO HEALTHCARE SERVICES. GEISINGER IS TAKING INNOVATIVE STEPS TO ADDRESS BARRIERS TO HEALTHCARE BY: INCREASING THE NUMBER OF RESIDENTS WHO HAVE A REGULAR PRIMARY CARE PROVIDER, INCREASING ACCESS TO PRIMARY AND SPECIALTY CARE PROVIDERS, REDUCING BARRIERS TO RECEIVING CARE FOR RESIDENTS WITHOUT TRANSPORTATION AND FOSTERING THE PURSUIT OF HEALTH CAREERS AND ONGOING TRAINING OF HEALTH PROFESSIONALS. 2)ADDRESSING BEHAVIORAL HEALTH AND SUBSTANCE ABUSE: GEISINGER IS COMMITTED TO HELPING PATIENTS FIND HEALTHCARE SERVICES WHEN THEY ARE FACING BEHAVIORAL HEALTH CHALLENGES OR STRUGGLING WITH ADDICTION. WE ADVANCE DIALOGUE AT THE LOCAL AND STATE LEVEL TO ADDRESS BEHAVIORAL HEALTH NEEDS. WE FOSTER INTEGRATION OF BEHAVIOR AND PRIMARY HEALTHCARE. WE PROVIDE EDUCATION TO INCREASE RESIDENTS' AWARENESS OF BEHAVIORAL HEALTH ISSUES AND REDUCE THE STIGMA ASSOCIATED WITH BEHAVIORAL HEALTH CONDITIONS. AND WE STRIVE TO INCREASE ACCESS TO BEHAVIORAL HEALTH SERVICES. 3)MANAGING CHRONIC CONDITIONS: GEISINGER HAS NUMEROUS PROGRAMS TO HELP PATIENTS PREVENT AND MANAGE CHRONIC CONDITIONS. EFFORTS INCLUDE ENCOURAGING COMMUNITY INITIATIVES THAT SUPPORT ACCESS TO AND AVAILABILITY OF HEALTHY LIFESTYLE CHOICES, INITIATING EARLY STAGE INTERVENTIONS FOR INDIVIDUALS AT HIGH RISK FOR CHRONIC DISEASE AND ADDRESSING HEALTH LITERACY TO IMPROVE RESIDENTS' SELF-EFFICACY IN DISEASE MANAGEMENT. ACCESS TO HEALTHCARE LACK OF TRANSPORTATION IS A SIGNIFICANT CHALLENGE FOR MANY MEMBERS OF OUR COMMUNITY. NOT BEING ABLE TO GET THE CARE THEY NEED - OR PUTTING OFF THE CARE THEY NEED UNTIL A MINOR HEALTH ISSUE BECOMES A MAJOR PROBLEM - IS A POPULATION HEALTH ISSUE THAT CANNOT BE IGNORED. THAT'S WHY GEISINGER HEALTH PLAN IS PARTNERING WITH LOCAL ENTITIES, SUCH AS NEPA MOVES AND THE EQUITABLE TRANSPORTATION WORKGROUP) TO EXPAND TRANSPORTATION SERVICES AND IMPROVE ACCESS TO HEALTHCARE AND SOCIAL SERVICES. THIS INITIATIVE IS PROJECTED TO HAVE A POSITIVE IMPACT ON NO-SHOW RATES, FILL RATES, EMERGENCY DEPARTMENT UTILIZATION, LENGTHS-OF-STAY, UNPLANNED 30-DAY ADMISSIONS, CHANGES IN HEALTH STATUS AND QUALITY OF LIFE. IN ORDER TO ATTRACT AND RETAIN MORE HEALTHCARE PROFESSIONALS, WE ARE TRACKING RECRUITMENT DATA FOR NEW HIRES, GEISINGER COMMONWEALTH SCHOOL OF MEDICINE APPLICANTS AND NURSE EXTERNS. WE HAVE ALSO LAUNCHED A LUNCH-AND- LEARN PROGRAM IN NURSING WHERE LEADERSHIP PROVIDES INFORMATION ON CAREER PATHS WITHIN GEISINGER TO NURSING STUDENTS. THE CLINICAL LUNCHEONS WERE HELD WITH SCHOOLS THAT CONDUCT CLINICALS AT GCMC, A TOTAL OF 83 STUDENTS ATTEND LUNCHEONS. MORE LUNCHEONS WERE SCHEDULED; HOWEVER, DUE TO SCHOOL CANCELLATIONS, THE REMAINDER OF THE LUNCHEONS WERE CANCELED FOR THE SPRING OF 2020. APPROXIMATELY 17 STUDENTS WERE INTERESTED IN NURSING HERE AT GEISINGER. IN ORDER TO DECREASE UNNECESSARY VISITS TO OUR EMERGENCY DEPARTMENT, GEISINGER COMMUNITY MEDICAL CENTER IS WORKING WITH LOCAL CLINICS, ENCOURAGING THEM TO LEAVE OPEN SLOTS IN THEIR APPOINTMENT SCHEDULES SO PATIENTS HAVE EASIER ACCESS. WE ARE ALSO PROVIDING EMERGENCY DEPARTMENT VS. URGENT CARE PATIENT EDUCATION MATERIALS AT COMMUNITY EVENTS TO EDUCATE ON WHEN IT IS APPROPRIATE TO USE THE EMERGENCY DEPARTMENT. BEHAVIORAL HEALTH GEISINGER COMMUNITY MEDICAL CENTER HAS BEEN ADVOCATING TO REMOVE REGULATORY BARRIERS TO THE PROVISION OF BEHAVIORAL HEALTH SERVICES. AS A RESULT OF THESE EFFORTS, AN ADDICTION MEDICINE OUTPATIENT CLINIC WAS LAUNCHED AT 3 WEST OLIVE STREET IN SCRANTON ON APRIL 8, 2019, AND HAS RAMPED UP AND IS SERVING THE COMMUNITY. IN ADDITION, A WARM HANDOFF PROGRAM IS FUNCTIONAL WITHIN THE EMERGENCY DEPARTMENT AT GCMC IN COLLABORATION WITH THE SCRANTON COUNSELING CENTER. THIS PROGRAM IS STAFFED BY CERTIFIED RECOVERY SPECIALISTS, WHO ENGAGE PATIENTS WITH ADDICTIONS WITH THE GOAL OF EFFECTIVELY STEERING THEM TOWARD TREATMENT. THE OFFICE OF MENTAL HEALTH AND SUBSTANCE ABUSE SERVICES (OMHSAS) HAS APPROVED TELEPSYCHIATRY IN THE EMERGENCY DEPARTMENT FOR ADOLESCENTS FOR GEISINGER COMMUNITY MEDICAL CENTER. HOWEVER, SINCE THIS SERVICE OCCURS WITHIN A HOSPITAL, DEPARTMENT OF HEALTH (DOH) APPROVAL MUST ALSO BE OBTAINED. THIS REQUEST HAS BEEN SUBMITTED. EQUIPMENT HAS BEEN ORDERED TO PROVIDE THIS SERVICE BUT HAS NOT YET ARRIVED. THE EQUIPMENT IS BEING FUNDED BY THE MOSES TAYLOR FUND IN COLLABORATION WITH THE BEHAVIORAL HEALTH INITIATIVE. IT IS ANTICIPATED THAT THIS SERVICE WILL BE OPERATIONAL BY JUNE 1, 2020. TELEPSYCHIATRY SERVICES HAVE BEEN APPROVED FOR THE EMERGENCY DEPARTMENT AT GEISINGER COMMUNITY MEDICAL CENTER AND FOR ADULT PATIENTS AND FOR ADULT AND PEDIATRIC PATIENTS AT THE MOUNT PLEASANT CLINIC. GEISINGER CAN REQUEST ADDITIONAL SITES AS LONG AS THESE SITES WILL BE SUPPORTED BY COMMUNITY CARE BEHAVIORAL HEALTH (CCBH) AND THE NORTHEAST BEHAVIORAL HEALTH CARE CONSORTIUM (NBHCC) FOR PAYMENT. PRELIMINARY WORK IS ALSO UNDERWAY TO PROVIDE TELEPSYCHIATRY SUPPORT TO THE LIFE GEISINGER DAY CENTER FOR NURSING-HOME-ELIGIBLE SENIORS IN THE SCRANTON LOCATION. AN INTEGRATED PRIMARY CARE PRACTICE AT THE GEISINGER MOUNT PLEASANT LOCATION SERVES BOTH ADULTS AND PEDS PATIENTS VIA EMBEDDED PSYCHOLOGISTS. IN ADDITION, PLANNING IS UNDERWAY TO EXPAND AND INTEGRATE ADDICTION MEDICINE FELLOWS INTO SERVICES PROVIDED BY THE WRIGHT CENTER. CHRONIC DISEASE MANAGEMENT AND PREVENTION OUR FRESH FOOD FARMACY LOCATION OPENED JULY 2019 IN SCRANTON TO HELP FOOD-INSECURE FAMILIES MANAGE AND PREVENT DIABETES AND OTHER SERIOUS HEALTH ISSUES BY PROVIDING NUTRITIOUS FOOD, FREE OF CHARGE, ALONG WITH COUNSELING AND EDUCATION.

St. John's Hospital is committed to addressing community health needs in collaboration with local organizations and other area health care institutions. In response to the FY2015 CHNA, the hospital planned, implemented and evaluated strategies to address the top four identified community health needs: pediatric asthma, mental health, childhood obesity and access to care. The FY2018 assessment built on that collaboration, actively seeking input from a cross section of community stakeholders with the goal of reaching consensus on priorities to mutually focus human, material and financial resources. The external advisory committee was used as the primary stakeholder group to review and force rank data. During three meetings, community stakeholders were asked to review data presented and provide additional sources for priority areas not listed. The external advisory committee also helped develop the community survey tool and outcomes and recommendations on the final priorities. The external advisory committee also helped identify community assets and gaps which were weighed when considering the magnitude and feasibility of the priority areas. Lastly, their feedback was instrumental in developing the implementation plan. The University of Illinois Office of Survey Research (UIS SRO) circulated an electronic survey on behalf of the core group in January 2018. In total 1,079 individuals completed the survey. UIS SRO analyzed and provided the results to the external and internal advisory teams. The results were used to guide further discussion around final priority selection. Focus groups were conducted around the final priority areas selected and helped determine the implementation plan adopted by the board of directors. More information about the focus groups can be found in the implementation plan document HSHS and St. John's Hospital are committed to promoting and defending human dignity, caring for persons living in poverty and other vulnerable persons, promoting the common good and stewarding resources. We believe the CHNA process must be informed by input from the poor and vulnerable populations we seek to serve. To ensure the needs of these groups were adequately represented, we included representatives from the following organizations representing persons living in poverty, persons with disabilities, children, elderly, persons living in food deserts, and minority populations (a complete list is noted in Part V, Line 6b): Sangamon County Department of Public Health, United Way of Central Illinois, Springfield Urban League, Springfield School District 186, two federally qualified health centers, Catholic Charities, Memorial Behavioral Health, and Sangamon County Department of Community Resources. These organizations serve the under-resourced in our community, including low-income seniors, children living in poverty and families who struggle with shelter and food. Representatives of these organizations have extensive knowledge and quantifiable data regarding the needs of their service populations. Actively including these organizations in the CHNA process was critical to ensure that needs of the most vulnerable persons in our communities were addressed in the CHNA process."

Based on the Community Health Needs Assessment (CHNA) planning and development process described, the following community health needs were identified: 1. Access to care 2. Child maltreatment 3. Maternal and infant health 4. Substance Abuse - Drugs Access to care: Access to Care is broad and has many dimensions. In Sangamon County, there is a direct correlation between access barriers and ZIP codes ranked worst on the socio needs index. Existing data shows social determinants of health and health disparities lead to a higher incidence of emergency department visits and hospitalization of individuals in low-income neighborhoods. Actions to address Access to Care in response to the FY2018 CHNA have led to measurable improvement in health for residents in the Enos Park Neighborhood. Using the effective model in place, strategies will be adapted to meet the unique needs of additional neighborhoods in Springfield. By addressing access barriers in socio-economically disadvantaged neighborhoods, health outcomes will continue to improve. Goal: Build on the success of the Enos Park Access to Care Collaborative to enhance services in Enos Park and expand the Access to Care Collaborative to the Pillsbury Mills Neighborhood. Explore collaborative expansion to additional neighborhoods in Springfield, Illinois. Strategy 1: Continue Enos Park Access to Care Collaborative Since FY2019, the collaborative has continued in partnership with Memorial Medical Center (MMC) and SIU Center for Family Medicine to support ongoing efforts in Enos Park to improve access to health and health care. Cross collaboration between Enos Park and Pillsbury Mills has increased patient capacity. The addition of a part-time community health worker in FY2020 allowed us to expand engagement work with the Latinx population in these neighborhoods and beyond. Additionally, our CHW were trained as PHW (pandemic health workers) in order to address the unique needs of our community during COVID-19. Strategy 2: Expand the Access to Care Collaborative to Pillsbury Mills Neighborhood In FY2020, the Access to Care Collaborative added a 1.0 FTE CHW in order to address the rising needs in Pillsbury Mills. In addition to the 42 clients added in FY2019, we currently have 53 being served in FY2020. A new group called 'Moving Pillsbury Forward' has developed in order to work with the City around the redevelopment of the Pillsbury property which is seen as a main health issue and barrier to health improvement in the neighborhood. Strategy 3: Expand Provider Council to include providers serving Pillsbury Mills The Provider Council has proven successful in providing education and training opportunities for social service and health providers serving the Enos Park Neighborhood. The Provider Council has been expanded to include all neighborhoods in Springfield that have a CHW component, which includes the United Way funded CHW program on Springfield's eastside. By uniting all teams, we can also discuss complex cases and work together to identify resources and problem solve based on past experiences. Child maltreatment: In Sangamon County, we continue to see an increase in reported cases of child abuse and neglect. Currently one in five children is abused or neglected. The likelihood of poor health outcomes and risky behaviors for children who have experienced abuse and neglect increases significantly. Child maltreatment includes physical, sexual and emotional abuse; neglect; and the exploitation of children. Goal: Integrate screening tools for early identification and intervention of child abuse in the health care setting. Strategy 1: Trauma Informed Care The hospital will collaborate with existing partners to provide Trauma Informed Care educational sessions for key stakeholders across sectors. A trauma informed approach helps the stakeholder realize the widespread impact of trauma and understand potential paths for recovery through: Recognizing the signs and symptoms of trauma in individuals; Understanding the appropriate steps to engage providers in intervention; Fully integrating knowledge about trauma into policies, procedures and practices; and Actively resisting re-traumatization. In FY2020, TIC Trainings were conducted with 200 healthcare students including: EMT, Pharmacy, RN, Physical Therapy, MD, Social Work. Strategy 2: Human Trafficking training for emergency providers. In the United States of America, Human Trafficking (HT) rose 35.7% from 2016 to 2017. Additionally, the Human Trafficking in Illinois Fact Sheet reports an estimated 25,000 women and children are being trafficked as prostitutes and 1,818 victims have been rescued since 2012. Calls to the national HT Hotline estimate Illinois ranks 10th for the number of reported cases of HT in the United States. The State Attorney's Human Trafficking Taskforce has identified three points in Central Illinois as 'hotspots' of human trafficking activity due to their proximity to Interstate 55, federally recognized as providing easier access to transporting of victims due to its proximity to the railway and intersection through numerous cities and international airports: Peoria, Illinois; Springfield, Illinois; and Litchfield, Illinois. The Human Trafficking of Person's report estimates that one third of all trafficked victims are children. The National Institutes of Health estimates that 33% of trafficking victims will seek care in a health care setting. The strategy is to train Emergency Department providers to identify and respond to suspected human trafficking victims; and adopt a plan to expand training across HSHS ministries in the Central Illinois Division. In FY2020, emergency department trainings began. Additionally, HT protocol has been developed to accompany the policy adopted in FY2019. Maternal and infant health: This priority will address maternal and infant health through a three-pronged approach. 1. Focus on first time mothers. 2. Focus on pre-term babies born 32 weeks in the NICU. 3. Focus on accidental infant asphyxiation. Strategy 1: Explore the issue of infant mortality, particularly accidental asphyxiation In Sangamon County, there were 27 total infant deaths reported in the first year of life. These deaths occurred in the home. Eighteen deaths were attributed to accidental asphyxiation. While the number of infants impacted does not represent a large percentage of total babies born, we feel there is education that can occur to better equip parents and guardians on infant safety post discharge. In FY2020, we conducted three focus groups comprised of 18-community members and 9-healthcare providers to identify safe sleep barriers and opportunities for awareness. From these community focus groups, messaging was developed and two awareness billboards were placed. Strategy 2: Beyond the NICU Beyond the NICU will use trained NICU nurses to give vulnerable parents of premature children the support they need to provide their at-risk babies with the best possible start in life. Since infant outcomes are closely tied to maternal health and well-being, this program will focus on assessing and improving maternal mental health and family preparedness. In FY2020, 28 babies graduated from the program; 20 new babies entered the program; and 16-babies carried over from FY2019. There are currently a total of 36 babies in the program with 132 to date. Strategy 3: Continue to Support Nurse-Family Partnership This program, supported by St. John's, Memorial Medical Center, and the Springfield Community Foundation, will discontinue the end of fall 2020. All families of the NFP are being transitioned to a community health worker and clients will continue to be assisted. Transition discussions are occurring and will be finalized in FY2021. Substance Abuse - Drugs: Since 2014 fatal and non-fatal drug overdose has increased significantly in Sangamon County. While the recent trend has shown an increase in opioid and heroin use, officials report the use of methamphetamine is on the rise. Emphasis is needed on both prevention and treatment moving forward. Strategy 1: Sangamon County Opioid Task Force St. John's Hospital will identify a hospital liaison to serve on the Sangamon County Opioid Task Force (SCOT) led by the Sangamon County Department of Public Health. St. John's had two hospital liaisons serving on the Opioid Task Force. One colleague also serves on the education subcommittee of the task force. With the onset of COVID-19, the health department was forced to shift focus and these meetings have not started again."

Strategy 2: Opioid Education Event St. John's Hospital will participate in the planning and implementation of an interprofessional opioid education event led by the St. John's College of Nursing. The event will provide education on care, treatment and management of patients with opioid use disorder. This event was successfully held in FY2020 by the college of nursing. A member of the community benefit team sat on the planning team and provided education on Adverse Childhood Experiences and Trauma Informed Care: what are they, what is a trauma brain, how ACES increase risk for substance use, and how to approach patients through a trauma informed lens. 200 students completed this event. Needs Not Being Addressed: As an outcome of the prioritization process, the following community health needs were also identified and will not be addressed directly by the hospital for the reasons indicated: Asthma: The local county health department is the lead on asthma education and the treatment of affected community members. Additionally, a community roundtable has convened to address the need to identify and mitigate asthma triggers in inner-city and older homes. Education: The external and internal advisory committee members felt education could be wrapped into each of the final priority areas to raise awareness, educate and see positive change occur. Therefore, education was not selected as a standalone priority but will be included in strategies developed to meet identified needs. Food Access: Food Access is addressed by groups including the Central Illinois Food Bank, Illinois Coalition of Community Services, COMPASS for kids, local school districts and the county health department. The hospital supports these efforts by donating monetary and in-kind resources to their programs and organizations. Housing: In the past year, a group of community stakeholders have come together to address housing issues and disparities in Sangamon County. St. John's Hospital sits on that committee. This group is taking the lead on housing issues in the city and county. Mental Health: Memorial Behavioral Health takes the lead on Mental and Behavioral Health issues in the community. United Way of Central Illinois has also adopted a Mental Health strategy to its Health Vision Council priorities and funding process. The hospital will support these efforts by donating resources to various community strategies as appropriate. Violent Crime: The Access to Care collaborative developed in response to the 2015 CHNA has led to a decrease in crime in the Enos Park Neighborhood. By expanding the collaborative, we will continue to impact crime across the city and county. We will continue to support these initiatives and others through monetary and in-kind resources."

This allowed the leadership team to cross-reference clinical items with the life factors and personal choices for a deeper understanding of the common themes, and a snapshot perspective of where in life the hospital might be able to implement strategies that will impact many. Survey results for health and disease included 1. Drug addiction/dependence, 2. Obesity 3. Cancers. Survey results for quality of life environment included 1. Low income, 2. Lack of access to recreation spaces for all ages 3. Food insecurity. Survey results for personal choice risky behaviors included 1. Drug abuse 2. Bad eating choices 3. Alcohol abuse."

Utilizing a prioritization matrix to guide discussion, the group considered the degree to which the hospitals can realistically affect health outcomes for each priority health concern, endeavors already underway for each, as well as level of importance relative to the reach of their impact. The list of top health concerns was pared down and reconfigured to the three that will be the focus moving forward with implementation planning. These included 1. Cancer 2.

THE MEDICAL CENTER'S CHC UNANIMOUSLY VOTED TO SELECT THREE HEALTH PRIORITIES TO ADDRESS FOR THE 2014 2016 CHNA, INCLUDING CHRONIC DISEASE PREVENTION/MANAGEMENT; BEHAVIORAL HEALTH AND SOCIAL DETERMINANTS OF HEALTH. HEALTH NEEDS SELECTED CHRONIC DISEASE PREVENTION/MANAGEMENT. ONE OF THE PRIORITIES SELECTED WAS CHRONIC DISEASE PREVENTION MANAGEMENT. THE FIRST STRATEGY WAS TO CREATE A MULTI-COMPONENT, SUSTAINABLE, SCHOOL-BASED OBESITY PREVENTION PROGRAM IN AN ADVOCATE ILLINOIS MASONIC PSA SCHOOL WHOSE STUDENTS HAD BEEN IDENTIFIED AS HAVING HIGH CHILDHOOD OBESITY RATES. IN 2019, ADVOCATE ILLINOIS MASONIC PARTNERED WITH IRV AND SHELLY'S FRESH PICKS TO PROVIDE THREE POP-UP FARMER'S MARKETS (OVER 5,00 POUNDS OF FRESH PRODUCE) TO OVER 550 STUDENTS AND FAMILIES AT GROVER CLEVELAND ELEMENTARY SCHOOL (CLEVELAND). ADVOCATE ILLINOIS MASONIC NURSES PROVIDED HEALTH AND NUTRITION EDUCATION THAT INCLUDED HEALTHY RECIPES AND MY PLATE EDUCATION FROM THE USDA TO THE PARENTS OF STUDENTS ATTENDING CLEVELAND. THE SECOND STRATEGY WAS TO IMPLEMENT A VOLUNTEER-BASED FOLLOW-UP PROGRAMTHE TRANSITION SUPPORT PROGRAMFOR DISCHARGED PATIENTS EXPERIENCING CHRONIC DISEASES AND WITH FREQUENT READMISSION HISTORIES (READMITTED WITHIN 30 DAYS AFTER DISCHARGE FOR ALL CAUSES). IN 2019, THE MEDICAL CENTER'S TRANSITION SUPPORT PROGRAM TRAINED 34 VOLUNTEERS, NAVIGATED 2,616 PATIENTS AND PROVIDED 130 INDIVIDUALS WITH TRANSPORTATION NEEDS. BEHAVIORAL HEALTH. BEHAVIORAL HEALTH WAS IDENTIFIED AND SELECTED AS A SIGNIFICANT HEALTH NEED IN THE MEDICAL CENTER'S PSA.

ADVOCATE ILLINOIS MASONIC PARTICIPATED IN ALL FOUR MENTAL HEALTH SUBCOMMITTEE MEETINGS IN 2019 AND WILL CONTINUE TO PLAY AN ACTIVE ROLE IN THE COMMITTEE MOVING FORWARD. SOCIAL DETERMINANTS OF HEALTH (SDOH). SDOH WAS THE THIRD IDENTIFIED NEED IN THE MEDICAL CENTER'S PSA. ADVOCATE ILLINOIS MASONIC SERVED AS A SITE FOR THE ADVOCATE WORKFORCE INITIATIVE. THE GOAL OF THE WORKFORCE PROGRAM IS TO RECRUIT, TRAIN AND HIRE COMMUNITY MEMBERS SEEKING EMPLOYMENT OPPORTUNITIES IN THE HEALTHCARE INDUSTRY. ADDITIONALLY, THE WORKFORCE PROGRAM OFFERS AN INCUMBENT WORKER STRATEGY (NAVIGATE) TO FRONT-LINE WORKFORCE AT ADVOCATE ILLINOIS MASONIC, WHICH INCLUDES SOFT-SKILLS TRAINING, TOOLS AND RESOURCES DESIGNED TO ASSIST INDIVIDUALS IN DEVELOPING CAREER PATHWAYS.

HEALTH NEEDS NOT SELECTED HEALTH LITERACY/LANGUAGE AND CULTURAL COMPETENCY. HEALTH LITERACY/LANGUAGE AND CULTURAL COMPETENCY WAS IDENTIFIED AS A HEALTH NEED BUT NOT SELECTED IN THE 2016 CHNA AS A PRIORITY TO BE ADDRESSED. HEALTH LITERACY IS THE DEGREE TO WHICH AN INDIVIDUAL HAS THE CAPACITY TO OBTAIN, COMMUNICATE, PROCESS AND UNDERSTAND BASIC HEALTH INFORMATION AND SERVICES TO MAKE APPROPRIATE HEALTH DECISIONS. THE CHC INITIALLY RANKED THIS ISSUE FOURTH. THE MEDICAL CENTER'S DIVERSITY AND INCLUSION WORKGROUP IS SPEARHEADING WORK ON THIS ISSUE. SEVERAL ADVOCATE ILLINOIS MASONIC CHC MEMBERS SERVE ON THE DIVERSITY AND INCLUSION WORKGROUP SO COORDINATION BETWEEN THE TWO GROUPS IS EASILY ACHIEVABLE. STRATEGIES TO ADDRESS THIS ISSUE INCLUDE INCREASING THE QUANTITY OF SPANISH LANGUAGE MATERIALS PRODUCED AND DISSEMINATED; THE LGBTQ TASKFORCE AND COMMUNITY ACTION COUNCIL; AND GREATER USE OF CASE MANAGERS AND COMMUNITY HEALTH WORKERS.

NURSE NAVIGATORS PROVIDE LINKAGE WITH COMMUNITY PROGRAMS, PHYSICAL MEDICINE AND REHABILITATION, PAIN MANAGEMENT SERVICES AND PALLIATIVE CARE, AND HOSPICE AND HOME CARE PROGRAMS. IN 2016 THROUGH 2017, THE CANCER CENTER PROVIDED COMMUNITY HEALTH WORKERS TO WORK WITH BREAST HEALTH PATIENTS INCLUDING MAKING REMINDER CALLS FOR MAMMOGRAMS AND CONDUCTING COMMUNITY OUTREACH AND EDUCATION IN AFRICAN AMERICAN COMMUNITIES WITHIN THE MEDICAL CENTER'S PSA. IN ADDITION, THE MEDICAL CENTER WORKS CLOSELY WITH THE ILLINOIS BREAST AND CERVICAL CANCER PROGRAM TO ENSURE THAT UNINSURED WOMEN HAVE ACCESS TO SCREENING AND TREATMENT FOR BREAST OR CERVICAL CANCER.

THERE ARE SIX FOCUS AREAS THAT ARE IDENTIFIED IN CURRENT INDUSTRY AS HAVING THE MOST UPSTREAM EFFECT ON HEALTH EQUITY AND ARE ALSO STRONGLY CONFIRMED BY ADVOCATE AURORA HEALTH ORGANIZATION-WIDE CHNA DATA. THESE SIX FOCUS AREAS INCLUDE: 1) ACCESS/BEHAVIORAL HEALTH SERVICES; 2) ACCESS/PRIMARY MEDICAL HOMES; 3) COMMUNITY SAFETY; 4) FOOD SECURITY; 5) HOUSING; AND 6) WORKFORCE DEVELOPMENT.HEALTH NEEDS SELECTED HEALTHY LIFESTYLES/OBESITY. HEALTHY LIFESTYLES/OBESITY WAS CHOSEN AS ONE OF THE TWO HEALTH NEED PRIORITIES DUE TO THE MANY CHRONIC DISEASES AND HEALTH ISSUES THAT ARE RELATED TO POOR NUTRITION AND PHYSICAL INACTIVITY. MOREOVER, THE CHC ALSO IDENTIFIED HEALTHY LIFESTYLES AND OBESITY DUE TO THE LARGE IMPACT THIS ISSUE HAS ON QUALITY OF LIFE AND OVERALL HEALTH OUTCOMES IN THE MEDICAL CENTER'S PSA.BEHAVIORAL HEALTH. BEHAVIORAL HEALTH WAS SELECTED AS THE SECOND HEALTH PRIORITY. THIS HEALTH PRIORITY INCLUDES MENTAL HEALTH AND SUBSTANCE/ALCOHOL USE. WITHIN THE MEDICAL CENTER'S PSA, THE RATE OF MENTAL HEALTH ISSUES AND SUBSTANCE USE ARE CONTINUING TO INCREASE OVER TIME AND ARE HIGH WHEN COMPARED TO OTHER COMMUNITIES IN ILLINOIS.

THE FIRST IDENTIFIED NEED OR PRIORITY IS TO REDUCE THE INCIDENCE OF CARDIOVASCULAR DISEASE (1) INCREASING THE NUMBER OF UNINSURED ADULTS WHO ARE MANAGING THEIR HIGH BLOOD PRESSURE OR HYPERTENSION BY FINDING THEM PRIMARY HEALTH CARE. (2) INCREASING THE AMOUNT OF ADULTS EDUCATED ABOUT RISK FACTORS FOR CARDIOVASCULAR DISEASE. THE SECOND IDENTIFIED NEED OR PRIORITY IS TO REDUCE THE INCIDENCE OF LUNG DISEASE. MERCY SPRINGFIELD ADOPTED IMPLEMENTATION STRATEGIES FOR (1) INCREASING THE AMOUNT OF ADULTS EDUCATED ABOUT SYMPTOMS OF MILD OR UNDIAGNOSED LUNG DISEASE. (2) ENCOURAGE BREAST FEEDING AFTER DELIVERY TO DECREASE LUNG DISEASE IN CHILDREN. (3) PROMOTE EVIDENCE BASED CARE TO MANAGE CHRONIC DISEASE. THE THIRD IDENTIFIED NEED OR PRIORITY IS TO INCREASE AWARENESS FOR MENTAL HEALTH ISSUES. MERCY SPRINGFIELD ADOPTED IMPLEMENTATION STRATEGIES FOR (1) PROVIDE COMMUNITY EDUCATION ON SUBSTANCE ABUSE. (2) PROVIDE EDUCATION TO THE COMMUNITY REGARDING RESOURCES IN THE GEOGRAPHIC AREA THAT ASSIST WITH MENTAL AND BEHAVIORAL HEALTH ISSUE. FOR ALL OF THESE IDENTIFIED NEEDS AND PRIORITIES, MERCY SPRINGFIELD CONTINUES TO WORK CLOSELY WITH ITS LOCAL PUBLIC SCHOOL SYSTEM, NONPROFIT ORGANIZATIONS, THE CHAMBER OF COMMERCE, AND PUBLIC OFFICIALS TO ENSURE WE ARE COLLABORATIVELY ADDRESSING THE NEEDS OF OUR COMMUNITY IN A MEASURABLE WAY.

THREE HEALTH ISSUES IDENTIFIED -HEART DISEASE, CANCER, AND SUBSTANCE ABUSE-WERE NOT CHOSEN AS PRIORITY FOCUS AREAS DUE TO MERCY'S CURRENT LACK OF RESOURCES AVAILABLE TO ADDRESS THESE NEEDS AND THE INTENTION TO FOCUS ON THE THREE PRIORITIZED HEALTH NEEDS. THESE ISSUES WILL BE ADDRESSED INDIRECTLY IN IMPLEMENTATION STRATEGIES DEVELOPED TO MEET THE PRIORITIZED NEEDS IN AREAS THAT MAY OVERLAP. FOR EXAMPLE, EFFORTS TO REDUCE THE INCIDENCE OF TYPE 2 DIABETES IN THE COMMUNITY MAY ALSO REDUCE THE INCIDENCE OF HEART DISEASE. MERCY SPRINGFIELD WILL CONSIDER FOCUSING ON THESE ISSUES SHOULD RESOURCES BECOME AVAILABLE.

THE PURPOSE OF THE ENVIRONMENTAL SCAN WAS TO CREATE A CLEAR PICTURE OF THE HOSPITAL COMMUNITIES, INCLUDING THEIR SOCIAL, ECONOMIC AND PHYSICAL BARRIERS TO HEALTHY LIVING, AND ENGAGE THE COMMUNITY FOR THEIR PERSPECTIVES ON THESE ISSUES. THE COMMUNITY ENGAGEMENT STRATEGY WAS DESIGNED TO GATHER COMMUNITY INPUT ON DISPARITIES WITHIN THE HOSPITAL'S SERVICE AREA, UNDERSTAND COMMUNITY RESOURCES, GAUGE GAPS IN SERVICES, AND CLARIFY AND ENHANCE THE COMMUNITY PROFILE. DATA COLLECTION OCCURRED IN THREE PHASES: COMMUNITY CANVASSING; FOCUS GROUPS; AND COMMUNITY STAKEHOLDER SURVEYS. COMMENTS FROM COMMUNITY MEMBERS ENGAGED IN THE COMMUNITY ENVIRONMENTAL SCAN ARE PROVIDED THROUGHOUT THE REPORT WHEN AVAILABLE. CANVASSING COMMUNITY CANVASSING OCCURRED AT TWO LARGE EVENTS ACROSS THE HOSPITAL'S SERVICE AREA. THE EVENTS WERE THE BOYLE HEIGHTS CHRISTMAS PARADE AND THE RAMONA GARDENS HOLIDAY GIFT GIVE AWAY. CANVASSING QUESTIONS WERE: 1. WHAT STOPS YOU FROM ACHIEVING YOUR HIGHEST LEVEL OF HEALTH? 2. WHAT DOES YOUR COMMUNITY NEED TO BE HEALTHIER? THE CANVASSING EVENTS ENGAGED 111 RESIDENTS IN A SELF-SERVICE SURVEY WHERE THEY COULD WRITE AND PLACE ANSWERS TO THREE OPEN-ENDED QUESTIONS ON POSTER BOARDS.

TEN (10) FOCUS GROUPS ENGAGED 108 PERSONS AND WERE CONDUCTED FROM NOVEMBER 2018 TO MARCH 2019. FOCUS GROUPS WERE HELD AT SCHOOLS, PREDOMINANTLY ATTENDED BY PARENTS OF YOUNG CHILDREN, AND AT COMMUNITY CENTERS AND A CLINIC. ONE FOCUS GROUP WAS CONDUCTED WITH A SENIOR CITIZEN GROUP KNOWN AS FRIENDS OF RAMONA GARDENS AT THEIR LOCAL ADULT RECREATION CENTER. EACH OF THE LOCATIONS WAS CHOSEN FOR ITS EASE OF ACCESS TO COMMUNITY MEMBERS AND THE LIKELIHOOD THOSE NEIGHBORS WOULD BE WILLING TO PARTICIPATE. THE FOCUS GROUP QUESTIONS AIMED TO ENGAGE COMMUNITY RESIDENTS IN DISCUSSING CHALLENGES AND NEEDS FOR IMPROVING THEIR HEALTH. 1. WHAT THINGS IN YOUR COMMUNITY NEGATIVELY AFFECT YOUR HEALTH? HOW ARE THEY AFFECTING YOUR HEALTH? 2. WHAT DO YOU BELIEVE ARE THE MOST SIGNIFICANT HEALTH NEEDS FOR YOU AND MEMBERS OF YOUR COMMUNITY? 3. WHAT HEALTH RESOURCES ARE AVAILABLE IN YOUR COMMUNITY? HOW CAN THESE RESOURCES BETTER SERVE TO IMPROVE THE HEALTH OF YOUR COMMUNITY? 4. ARE YOU AWARE OF ANY RESOURCES IN THE COMMUNITY BEING PROVIDED BY THE HOSPITAL?

THE SURVEYS SUMMARIZED THE NEEDS AND CONCERNS OF COMMUNITY RESIDENTS, WHICH ALLOWED THE NHF TEAM TO ASK STAKEHOLDERS MORE DIRECT QUESTIONS REGARDING THE SEVERITY OF THE EMERGING ISSUES. STAKEHOLDERS WERE CONTACTED THROUGH EMAIL OR IN PERSON DURING CANVASSING EVENTS AND WERE ASKED TO PARTICIPATE IN AN ANONYMOUS ONLINE SURVEY BASED ON ISSUES RAISED THROUGH COMMUNITY INPUT. THE ONLINE SURVEY WAS ADMINISTERED USING GOOGLE FORMS AND EMAILED TO STAKEHOLDERS WHO EXPRESSED INTEREST IN PARTICIPATING.

THE FOCUS GROUP QUESTIONS AIMED TO ENGAGE COMMUNITY RESIDENTS IN DISCUSSING CHALLENGES AND NEEDS FOR IMPROVING THEIR HEALTH. 1. WHAT THINGS IN YOUR COMMUNITY NEGATIVELY AFFECT YOUR HEALTH? HOW ARE THEY AFFECTING YOUR HEALTH? 2. WHAT DO YOU BELIEVE ARE THE MOST SIGNIFICANT HEALTH NEEDS FOR YOU AND MEMBERS OF YOUR COMMUNITY? 3. WHAT HEALTH RESOURCES ARE AVAILABLE IN YOUR COMMUNITY? HOW CAN THESE RESOURCES BETTER SERVE TO IMPROVE THE HEALTH OF YOUR COMMUNITY? 4. ARE YOU AWARE OF ANY RESOURCES IN THE COMMUNITY BEING PROVIDED BY THE HOSPITAL? WHAT WOULD YOU LIKE TO SEE THEM PROVIDE? STAKEHOLDER SURVEYS COMMUNITY STAKEHOLDERS WERE IDENTIFIED DURING COMMUNITY CANVASSING AND FOCUS GROUP RECRUITMENT. EXECUTIVE LEADERS IN COMMUNITY ORGANIZATIONS OR SCHOOLS, OR INDIVIDUALS HEAVILY INVOLVED IN ADDRESSING COMMUNITY ISSUES THROUGH LOCAL GOVERNMENT WERE IDENTIFIED AS QUALIFIED STAKEHOLDERS. THE RESPONDING STAKEHOLDERS REPRESENTED A BROAD RANGE OF INTEREST IN THE HOSPITAL'S SERVICES AREA AND INCLUDED NONPROFIT LEADERS, SCHOOL PRINCIPALS, POLICE DEPARTMENT REPRESENTATIVES AND LOCAL GOVERNMENT OFFICIALS. STAKEHOLDER SURVEYS WERE DEVELOPED AND DISSEMINATED ONCE CANVASSING AND FOCUS GROUP THEMES EMERGED. THE SURVEYS SUMMARIZED THE NEEDS AND CONCERNS OF COMMUNITY RESIDENTS, WHICH ALLOWED THE NHF TEAM TO ASK STAKEHOLDERS MORE DIRECT QUESTIONS REGARDING THE SEVERITY OF THE EMERGING ISSUES. STAKEHOLDERS WERE CONTACTED THROUGH EMAIL OR IN PERSON DURING CANVASSING EVENTS AND WERE ASKED TO PARTICIPATE IN AN ANONYMOUS ONLINE SURVEY BASED ON CONCERNS RAISED THROUGH COMMUNITY INPUT. THE ONLINE SURVEY WAS ADMINISTERED USING GOOGLE FORMS AND EMAILED TO STAKEHOLDERS WHO EXPRESSED INTEREST IN PARTICIPATING. THE SURVEY USED A LIKERT SCALE FORMAT AND ASKED STAKEHOLDERS TO RANK HOW STRONGLY THEY AGREED OR DISAGREED WITH COMMUNITY CONCERNS OR ISSUES BEING PRESENT IN THEIR COMMUNITY. STAKEHOLDERS WERE GIVEN THE OPPORTUNITY TO EXPLAIN OR EXPAND ON THEIR ANSWER WITH A FILL-IN SECTION BELOW EACH QUESTION. TWELVE STAKEHOLDERS RESPONDED TO THE SURVEY. PART V, SECTION B, LINE 11: THE SIGNIFICANT HEALTH NEEDS IDENTIFIED FROM THE 2019 CHNA WERE PRIORITIZED BY COMMUNITY STAKEHOLDERS THROUGH A STRUCTURED PROCESS USING DEFINED CRITERIA. THIS IMPLEMENTATION STRATEGY FOCUSES ON THE PRIORITY HEALTH NEEDS THAT WILL BE ADDRESSED BY USC VERDUGO HILLS HOSPITAL THROUGH ITS COMMUNITY BENEFIT PROGRAMS AND ACTIVITIES. THEY ARE: - ACCESS TO HEALTH CARE - CHRONIC DISEASES - MENTAL HEALTH - PREVENTIVE PRACTICES - SENIOR HEALTH THE 2019 IMPLEMENTATION STRATEGY ADOPTED BY USC VERDUGO HILLS HOSPITAL ACTIVELY ADDRESSES HEALTH NEEDS THAT WERE IDENTIFIED IN THE CHNA AS PRIORITY HEALTH NEEDS. USC VERDUGO HILLS HOSPITAL PLANS TO MEET THE IDENTIFIED PRIORITY HEALTH NEEDS THROUGH A COMMITMENT OF RESOURCES WITH SPECIFIC PROGRAMS AND SERVICES. FOR EACH HEALTH NEED THE HOSPITAL PLANS TO ADDRESS, THE IMPLEMENTATION STRATEGY DESCRIBES: ACTIONS THE HOSPITAL INTENDS TO TAKE, INCLUDING PROGRAMS AND RESOURCES IT PLANS TO COMMIT, PLANNED COLLABORATION BETWEEN THE HOSPITAL AND COMMUNITY ORGANIZATIONS, AND ANTICIPATED IMPACTS OF THESE ACTIONS. IN ADDITION TO THE SPECIFIC STRATEGIES FOR THE SELECTED PRIORITY HEALTH NEEDS, USC VERDUGO HILLS HOSPITAL WILL INVESTIGATE THE DEVELOPMENT OF A COMMUNITY GRANTS PROGRAM TO PROVIDE FINANCIAL AND IN-KIND SUPPORT TO COMMUNITY ORGANIZATIONS ADDRESSING THESE NEEDS. OTHER HEALTH NEEDS WERE IDENTIFIED BUT ARE NOT SPECIFICALLY ADDRESSED IN THE IMPLEMENTATION STRATEGY. THESE INCLUDE: ECONOMIC INSECURITY, DENTAL CARE, OVERWEIGHT AND OBESITY, SEXUALLY TRANSMITTED INFECTIONS, SUBSTANCE USE AND MISUSE, AND TRANSPORTATION. WHILE THESE ISSUES ARE ADDRESSED ON A DAY-TO-DAY BASIS IN THE NORMAL COURSE OF OPERATIONS, THE HOSPITAL HAS CHOSEN NOT TO FOCUS THIS IMPLEMENTATION PLAN ON THESE OTHER NEEDS AS IT BELIEVES THAT IT CAN HAVE A GREATER IMPACT ON THE PRIORITY HEALTH NEEDS THAT WERE SELECTED. THESE OTHER HEALTH NEEDS ARE LESS ALIGNED WITH THE HOSPITAL'S STRATEGIC INITIATIVES.
