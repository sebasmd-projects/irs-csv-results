Prior to joining University, Lakeview Hospital was wholly-owned and operated by an affiliate of HCA Healthcare, Inc. The patient accounts receivable billing and collection processes are performed by a patient account service center operated by a wholly-owned affiliate of HCA Healthcare, Inc. The same patient accounts service center provides patient accounts receivable billing and collection processes for the hospitals owned and operated by University. With respect to the hospitals operated by University, the billing and collection processes conform to the requirements of IRC Section 501(r). Prior to joining University certain billing and collection processes that were used for Lakeview's patient accounts receivables did not conform to the billing and collection processes required by IRC Section 501(r) as the hospital was not required to meet those requirements. Upon Lakeview Hospital joining University, these certain billing and collection processes were inadvertently not updated to treat Lakeview similarly to hospitals being operated by University. Specifically, certain patient accounts were held by the patient account service center's collections department for approximately 60 days (instead of 120 days from the first billing statement) prior to being sent to primary collection agencies. Once at primary collection agencies, the patient accounts could have been reported to credit bureaus which is an extraordinary collection activity under 501(r) (""ECA""). A subsequent review indicated that approximately 197 patient accounts were reported to a credit bureau agency prior to 120 days from the first billing statement. This credit bureau reporting has been reversed. Additionally, certain accounts were not routed to receive verbal attempts or final notices at least 30 days prior to closing from the patient account service center's collections department. This process has been updated and patient accounts are receiving the verbal attempts before sending final notices of payment due. Additionally, the patient billing statements sent from the patient account service center did not contain language regarding the availability of financial assistance, the phone number for obtaining more information, or the URL for obtaining the Financial Assistance Policy, Financial Assistance Application or Plain Language Summary for Lakeview accounts as required by 501(r). This process issue has been corrected and the required information is being included on patients' billing statements. Any patient accounts that may have been adversely impacted by these issues have been corrected. """

The provision for doubtful accounts and the allowance for doubtful accounts relate primarily to amounts due directly from patients. Management relies on the results of detailed reviews of historical write-offs and recoveries as a primary source of information to utilize in estimating the collectability of the Company's accounts receivable. The results of the detailed reviews of historical write-offs and recoveries, adjusted for changes in trends and conditions, are used to estimate the allowance for doubtful accounts for the current period. Adverse changes in general economic conditions, business office operations, payer mix, or trends in federal or state governmental health care coverage could affect the Company's collection of accounts receivable, cash flows, and results of operations."

The primary collection risks relate to uninsured patient accounts, including patient accounts for which the primary insurance carrier has paid the amounts covered by the applicable agreement, but patient responsibility amounts (deductibles and copayments) remain outstanding. The provision for doubtful accounts and the allowance for doubtful accounts relate primarily to amounts due directly from patients. An estimated allowance for doubtful accounts is recorded for all uninsured accounts, regardless of the aging of those accounts. Accounts are written off when all reasonable internal and external collections efforts have been performed. Our collection policies include a review of all accounts against certain standard collection criteria, upon completion of our internal collection efforts. Accounts determined to possess positive collectability attributes are forwarded to a secondary external collections agency and the other accounts are written off. The accounts that are not collected by the secondary external collection agency are written off when they are returned to us by the collection agency (usually within 12 months). Write-offs are based upon specific identification and the write-off process requires a write-off adjustment entry to the patient accounting system. We do not pursue collection of amounts related to patients that meet our guidelines to qualify as charity care. The methodology to determine the bad debt expense reported at cost on Part III, Line 2 is to take the ratio of patient care costs to gross patient charges and multiply this resulting ratio by the gross charges for bad debt accounts."

Civic and social organizations, government agencies, educational systems, and health and human services entities were engaged throughout the CHNA. The comprehensive primary data collection phase resulted in the contribution of over 100 community stakeholders/leaders, organizations, and community groups. During the CHNA process, data was collected and analyzed individually for each of the three health facilities due to their distinct geographic regions. The primary data collection consisted of several project component pieces. Community stakeholder interviews were conducted with individuals who represented a) broad interests of the community, b) populations of need or c) persons with specialized knowledge in public health. Health provider surveys were collected to capture thoughts and opinions regarding health providers' community regarding the care and services they provide. Community representatives and stakeholders attended a community forum facilitated by Tripp Umbach to prioritize health needs, which will assist in the implementation and planning phase. A resource inventory was generated to highlight available programs and services within the service area. The resource inventory identifies available organizations and agencies that serve the region within each of the priority needs. A robust regional profile (secondary data profile) was analyzed. The regional profile contained local, state, and federal data/statistics providing invaluable information on a wide-array of health and social topics. Different socioeconomic characteristics, health outcomes, and health factors that affect residents' behaviors; specifically, the influential factors that impact the health of residents were reviewed and discussed with members of the Working Group and Tripp Umbach."

WE PROVIDE EXCELLENT AND COMPASSIONATE CARE AND RESPONSIVE SERVICE. AS WE SEEK TO UNDERSTAND AND FULLY MEET OUR PATIENTS' CURRENT AND FUTURE NEEDS AND EXPECTATIONS, WE RECOGNIZE OUR RESPONSIBILITY TO PRUDENTLY USE THE SCARCE RESOURCES ENTRUSTED TO US. LAWS, REGULATIONS, CATASTROPHIC ILLNESSES AND THE RISING COSTS OF NEW TECHNOLOGY HAVE CREATED A CATEGORY OF PATIENTS WHO ARE EITHER UNINSURED OR UNDERINSURED. THIS CHARITY CARE PROGRAM HAS BEEN DEVELOPED TO HELP THE HOSPITAL MEET THE NEEDS OF THESE PATIENTS AND, CONCURRENTLY, MAINTAIN THE FINANCIAL VIABILITY OF THE HOSPITAL FOR FUTURE GENERATIONS. THIS CHARITY CARE POLICY EXPLAINS HOW THE HOSPITAL ASSISTS PATIENTS WHO CANNOT PAY FOR PART OR ALL OF THE ESSENTIAL MEDICAL CARE THEY RECEIVE. PRINCIPLES: STRONG MEMORIAL HOSPITAL PROACTIVELY CONVEYS INFORMATION ABOUT THIS CHARITY CARE POLICY TO PATIENTS AND THEIR FAMILIES. - WE BELIEVE THAT FEAR OF A HOSPITAL BILL SHOULD NEVER GET IN THE WAY OF ESSENTIAL HEALTH SERVICES. THE PROVISION OF URGENT OR EMERGENT HEALTHCARE IS NEVER DELAYED PENDING A FINANCIAL ASSISTANCE DETERMINATION. SIGNS ANNOUNCING THE CHARITY CARE PROGRAM ARE POSTED IN THE HOSPITAL (E.G. EMERGENCY DEPARTMENT, ADMITTING OFFICE) TO PROACTIVELY CONVEY THIS MESSAGE TO PROSPECTIVE PATIENTS AND THE PUBLIC IN GENERAL. - WE MAINTAIN FINANCIAL AID POLICIES THAT ARE CONSISTENT WITH THE MISSION, VALUES AND CAPACITY OF THE HOSPITAL AND THAT TAKE INTO ACCOUNT EACH INDIVIDUAL'S ABILITY TO CONTRIBUTE TO THE COST OF HIS OR HER CARE. - WE COMMUNICATE THE AVAILABILITY OF FINANCIAL AID IN A MANNER THAT IS CLEAR, UNDERSTANDABLE, SENSITIVE TO THE PATIENT'S DIGNITY, AND IN MULTIPLE LANGUAGES. A NOTICE IS AVAILABLE AT REGISTRATION SITES THAT INFORMS PATIENTS OF THIS PROGRAM AND PROVIDES THE PHONE NUMBER TO CALL TO OBTAIN MORE INFORMATION AND TO APPLY FOR THIS PROGRAM. DESIGNATED STAFF ARE PROVIDED DETAILED TRAINING SO THAT THEY CAN PROVIDE INFORMATION AND ANSWER QUESTIONS ABOUT THE CHARITY CARE PROGRAM. INFORMATION IS GENERALLY AVAILABLE IN BOTH ENGLISH AND SPANISH. WHEN REQUESTED, IT WILL ALSO BE MADE AVAILABLE IN OTHER LANGUAGES. - INFORMATION REGARDING OUR CHARITY CARE PROGRAM IS ALSO AVAILABLE ON THE URMC WEBSITE. - WE IMPLEMENT FINANCIAL AID PROCEDURES THAT ARE CONSUMER-FRIENDLY, RESPECTFUL, AND CONFIDENTIAL, AS WELL AS DEBT COLLECTION POLICIES THAT REFLECT THE MISSION AND VALUES OF THIS HOSPITAL. - WE WORK WITH GOVERNMENT, PAYERS, BUSINESS, CONSUMER GROUPS AND OTHERS TO ADDRESS THE UNDERLYING PROBLEM THAT TOO MANY NEW YORKERS LACK HEALTH INSURANCE. GENERAL GUIDELINES: AS PART OF FINANCIAL PLANNING ASSISTANCE, WE PROVIDE PATIENTS, AND/OR THEIR LEGAL REPRESENTATIVE, WITH INFORMATION ABOUT THE CRITERIA THAT MUST BE MET IN ORDER TO OBTAIN MEDICAID, MEDICARE, OR OTHER HEALTH INSURANCES. PATIENTS ARE ASSISTED IN MAKING APPLICATIONS FOR ANY OF THESE INSURANCES OR DISCOUNTED FEE PLANS. PATIENTS ARE EXPECTED TO PARTICIPATE FULLY IN ALL EFFORTS TO OBTAIN ANY INSURANCE FOR WHICH THEY MAY QUALIFY. UNDER CERTAIN CIRCUMSTANCES, AS DETERMINED BY THE FINANCIAL CASE MANAGERS OR OTHER HOSPITAL SENIOR ADMINISTRATORS. APPLICATIONS FOR MEDICAID, MEDICARE OR OTHER INSURANCE PROGRAMS MAY BE WAIVED WHEN DEEMED UNNECESSARY. IF AVAILABLE INSURANCE BENEFITS ARE NOT SUFFICIENT TO COVER THE COST OF THEIR CARE, PATIENTS MAY THEN APPLY FOR ASSISTANCE FROM THE CHARITY CARE PROGRAM. CHARITY CARE APPLICATIONS MUST BE COMPLETED AND RETURNED TO THE HOSPITAL WITH THE REQUESTED INCOME DOCUMENTATION. PATIENTS WILL NOT RECEIVE CHARITY CARE ASSISTANCE IF THEY (A) DO NOT COMPLETE THE APPLICATION PROCESS FOR MEDICAID OR OTHER INSURANCE FOR WHICH THEY MAY QUALIFY, (B) ELECT NOT TO MAKE APPLICATION FOR CHARITY CARE, OR (C) HAVE ADEQUATE RESOURCES OR INCOME TO PAY PRIVATELY FOR THEIR CARE. IN THESE SITUATIONS, THEY WILL REMAIN FINANCIALLY RESPONSIBLE FOR FULL PAYMENT OF THEIR HOSPITAL BILLS. CHARITY CARE ASSISTANCE IS AVAILABLE FOR PATIENTS WHO RESIDE IN NEW YORK STATE AND RECEIVE EMERGENCY HOSPITAL SERVICES, INCLUDING EMERGENCY TRANSFERS, AND TO PATIENTS WHO RESIDE IN STRONG MEMORIAL HOSPITAL'S PRIMARY SERVICE AREA IN NEW YORK STATE WHO RECEIVE SERVICES IN DESIGNATED STRONG MEMORIAL HOSPITAL PROGRAMS, INCLUDING MOST INPATIENT AND OUTPATIENT SERVICES. IN ADDITION, THE HOSPITAL MAY, IN ITS DISCRETION, GRANT CHARITY CARE TO INDIVIDUALS WHO RESIDE OUTSIDE OF NEW YORK STATE. CHARITY CARE ASSISTANCE DOES NOT COVER MEDICALLY UNNECESSARY CARE, COSMETIC ALTERATION, TELEPHONE, TELEVISION AND PRIVATE ROOM CHARGES. IT DOES NOT COVER SERVICES GENERATED BY AN INSURED PATIENT WHO CHOOSES TO RECEIVE CARE AT AN OUT-OF-NETWORK HOSPITAL, OR WHO FAILS TO COMPLY WITH INSURANCE POLICY REQUIREMENTS (E.G. UNAUTHORIZED SERVICES) NOR DOES IT APPLY TO NON-RESIDENT ALIENS (UNLESS APPROVED IN ADVANCE OF CARE BEING PROVIDED), TO DRUGS NOT ADMINISTERED IN THE HOSPITAL, TO TRANSPORTATION FURNISHED BY THIRD PARTY VENDORS, OR TO CARE, SERVICES, DRUGS OR SUPPLIES FOR THE PURPOSE OF GENDER CHANGE PROCEDURE. SPECIFIC QUESTIONS ABOUT SERVICES THAT ARE NOT COVERED SHOULD BE DIRECTED TO THE PATIENT ACCOUNTS MANAGER OR THEIR DELEGATE. FINANCIAL GUIDELINES: FINANCIAL AID IS INTENDED TO ASSIST THOSE INDIVIDUALS WHO CANNOT AFFORD TO PAY IN PART OR IN FULL FOR THEIR CARE. IT SHOULD TAKE INTO ACCOUNT EACH INDIVIDUAL'S ABILITY TO CONTRIBUTE TO THE COST OF HIS OR HER CARE. HOSPITAL FINANCIAL AID SHOULD NOT BE VIEWED AS A SUBSTITUTE FOR EMPLOYER-SPONSORED OR INDIVIDUALLY PURCHASED INSURANCE. PATIENTS WITHOUT INSURANCE AND WITH INCOME THAT WOULD QUALIFY THEM FOR THE CHARITY CARE PROGRAM BUT ALSO HAVE SUBSTANTIAL RESOURCES (OTHER THAN TAX-DEFERRED OR COMPARABLE RETIREMENT SAVINGS OR COLLEGE SAVINGS ACCOUNTS) MAY BE EXPECTED TO PAY PART OF THEIR BILLS(S). CHARITY CARE ASSISTANCE IS GENERALLY AVAILABLE TO INDIVIDUALS WHOSE INCOME IS LESS THAN OR EQUAL TO 400% OF THE FEDERAL POVERTY LEVEL. HOWEVER, PATIENTS WHO HAVE EXHAUSTED THEIR INSURANCE BENEFITS, EXCEEDED FINANCIAL ELIGIBILITY CRITERIA, FACE EXTRAORDINARY MEDICAL COSTS, OR WHO HAVE OTHER UNIQUE CIRCUMSTANCES MAY BE CONSIDERED FOR CHARITY CARE APPROVAL IN THE HOSPITAL'S SOLE DISCRETION. WHILE APPLICATION FOR MEDICAID OR OTHER INSURANCE IS USUALLY REQUIRED, THE HOSPITAL MAY, AT ITS SOLE DISCRETION, IN APPROPRIATE CASES, ALSO CONSIDER PATIENTS FOR CHARITY CARE WHEN THEY MEET THE FINANCIAL CRITERIA OF THIS PROGRAM, BUT HAVE NOT SATISFACTORILY COMPLETED ALL THE REQUIREMENTS OF THE CHARITY CARE APPLICATION PROCESS. THIS MAY INCLUDE PATIENTS WHO HAVE BEEN SANCTIONED BY MEDICAID, HAVE FILED BANKRUPTCY OR APPEAR TO BE ELIGIBLE FOR CHARITY CARE ASSISTANCE BASED ON AVAILABLE INFORMATION. ELIGIBILITY DETERMINATIONS IN COMPLEX CASE CIRCUMSTANCES WILL BE MADE AFTER CONSIDERATION BY THE CHARITY CARE REVIEW TEAM THAT INCLUDES THE CHARITY CARE OFFICER, FINANCIAL CASE MANAGER AND/OR THEIR MANAGERS, OR MAY BE MADE BY SENIOR HOSPITAL ADMINISTRATORS. THE AMOUNT OF THE DISCOUNT AFFORDED TO QUALIFIED CHARITY CARE PATIENTS WILL BE DETERMINED THROUGH ASSESSMENT OF THE RESPONSIBLE PARTY'S ANNUAL HOUSEHOLD INCOME AND THE NUMBER OF PEOPLE IN THE HOME, AS A PERCENTAGE OF THE FEDERAL POVERTY GUIDELINE AMOUNTS FOR SAME SIZE HOUSEHOLDS. THE FINANCIAL GUIDELINES WILL BE UPDATED ANNUALLY IN CONJUNCTION WITH THE FEDERAL POVERTY UPDATES PUBLISHED BY CMS. PATIENTS MAY RECEIVE FULL OR PARTIAL DISCOUNT FROM THE COST OF CARE, DEPENDING ON THE PERCENTAGE OF THE GUIDELINES MATCHED BY THE PATIENT'S HOUSEHOLD INCOME. ANY BILL AMOUNT REMAINING AFTER APPLICATION OF A PARTIAL CHARITY CARE DISCOUNT IS THE RESPONSIBILITY OF THE PATIENT. THE AMOUNT AN APPROVED CHARITY CARE PATIENT WILL GENERALLY BE EXPECTED TO PAY FOR SERVICES COVERED BY THE POLICY WILL BE LIMITED TO THE LOWER OF THE AMOUNT THAT THE HOSPITAL WOULD HAVE RECEIVED FOR THE SAME SERVICE UNDER MEDICARE PARTS A AND B, (INCLUDING COINSURANCE, CO-PAYMENTS AND DEDUCTIBLES) OR THE USUAL AND CUSTOMARY CHARGES. THE PATIENT WILL BE ASSISTED BY THE HOSPITAL IN MAKING ARRANGEMENTS TO SATISFY ANY BALANCE REMAINING ON THE ACCOUNT(S) AFTER THE APPLICATION OF THE APPROPRIATE CHARITY CARE DISCOUNT BY USE OF A PAYMENT PLAN. THE MONTHLY PAYMENTS UNDER SUCH PLANS SHALL NOT EXCEED TEN PERCENT (10%) OF THE ELIGIBLE PATIENT'S GROSS MONTHLY INCOME. THE RATE OF INTEREST ON UNPAID BALANCES SHALL NOT EXCEED THE US TREASURY RATE FOR 90 DAY SECURITIES PLUS 0.5%. HOSPITAL PATIENT FINANCIAL AID STATUTE DISCOUNTING REQUIREMENTS DISCOUNT / GROSS INCOME AS % OF FEDERAL POVERTY LEVEL 100% / UP TO 200% 80% / BETWEEN 201-250% 60% / BETWEEN 251-300% 40% / BETWEEN 301-350% 20% / BETWEEN 351-400% 0% / OVER 401% PROCESS: APPLICATIONS WILL BE ACCEPTED IMMEDIATELY BEFORE, DURING OR AFTER CARE IS PROVIDED. THE HOSPITAL WILL STRIVE TO ASSIST PATIENTS RECEIVING HIGH-COST SERVICES AS THEY OCCUR. PATIENTS MAY BE APPROVED FOR CHARITY CARE ON AN ACCOUNT-BY-ACCOUNT BASIS OR FOR A PERIOD OF TIME (FOR A COURSE OF TREATMENT). F"

FACULTY AND STAFF FROM WITHIN THE CCHP AS WELL AS AROUND THE INSTITUTION FREQUENTLY ATTEND COMMUNITY MEETINGS AND EVENTS TO GAUGE THE NEEDS OF COMMUNITY MEMBERS. IN ADDITION, THE CCHP SUPPORTS THE COMMUNITY ADVISORY COUNCIL (CAC), A LARGE COLLABORATIVE OF COMMUNITY LEADERS THAT INFORMS THE UNIVERSITY ABOUT ON-GOING AND EMERGING CONCERNS. THE COMMUNITY ADVISORY COUNCIL (CAC) WAS CREATED IN 2006 TO REPRESENT THE VOICE OF THE COMMUNITY AND TO GUIDE AND SUPPORT THE MISSION OF THE URMC. THE THIRTY-NINE MEMBER CAC REPRESENTS TWENTY-ONE COMMUNITY-BASED ORGANIZATIONS, INCLUDING HEALTH AND SOCIAL SERVICE AGENCIES, THE FAITH COMMUNITY, LOCAL GOVERNMENT, THE CITY SCHOOL DISTRICT AND MEDIA. A PRIMARY FUNCTION OF THE CAC IS TO STRENGTHEN URMC-COMMUNITY PARTNERSHIPS WITH A MUTUAL GOAL TO REDUCE INEQUALITIES AND IMPROVE ACCESS TO HEALTH CARE AND SERVICES.

202003189349303485,263162145,"Schedule H, Part I, Line 3c - Other Factors Used in Determining Elig.","IU Health Arnett uses several factors other than Federal Poverty Guidelines (""FPGs"") in determining eligibility for free care under its FAP. These factors include the following: 1. Indiana Residency Requirement Financial Assistance will only be made available to residents of the State of Indiana and those eligible for assistance under 42 U.S.C.A. 1396b(v). IU Health Arnett will employ the same residency test as set forth in Indiana Code 6-3-1-12 to define an Indiana resident. The term Resident includes any individual who was domiciled in Indiana during the taxable year, or any individual who maintains a permanent place of residence in Indiana and spends more than one hundred eight-three (183) days of the taxable year in Indiana. Patients residing in the state of Indiana while attending an institution of higher education may be eligible for assistance under the FAP if they meet the aforementioned residency test and are not claimed as a dependent on a parent's or guardians' federal income tax return. 2. IU Health's Individual Solutions Department Prior to seeking Financial Assistance under the FAP, all patients or their guarantors must consult with a member of IU Health's Individual Solutions department to determine if healthcare coverage may be obtained from a government insurance/assistance product or from the Health Insurance Exchange Marketplace. 3. Uninsured Patients All Uninsured Patients presenting for services at IU health Arnett eligible under the FAP will not be charged more than the AGB as described in the FAP. 4. Services Rendered by Individual Providers The FAP does not cover services rendered by individual providers. A full listing of providers and services not covered by the FAP is available at https://iuhealth.org/pay-a-bill/financial-assistance and is updated on a quarterly basis. 5. Alternate Sources of Assistance When technically feasible, a patient will exhaust all other state and federal assistance programs prior to receiving an award from IU Health Arnett's Financial Assistance Program. Patients who may be eligible for coverage under an applicable insurance policy, including, but not limited to, health, automobile, and homeowner's, must exhaust all insurance benefits prior to receiving an award from IU Health Arnett's Financial Assistance Program. This includes patients covered under their own policy and those who may be entitled to benefits from a third-party policy. Patients may be asked to show proof that such a claim was properly submitted to the proper insurance provider at the request of IU Health Arnett. Eligible patients who receive medical care from IU Health Arnett as a result of an injury proximately caused by a third party, and later receive a monetary settlement or award from said third party, may receive Financial Assistance for any outstanding balance not covered by the settlement or award to which IU Health Arnett is entitled. In the event a Financial Assistance Award has already been granted in such circumstances, IU Health Arnett reserves the right to reverse the award in an amount equal to the amount IU Health Arnett would be entitled to receive had no Financial Assistance been awarded. 6. Alternate Methods of Eligibility Determination IU Health Arnett will conduct a quarterly review of all accounts placed with a collection agency partner for a period of no less than one hundred and twenty (120) days after the account is eligible for an ECA. Said accounts may be eligible for assistance under the FAP based on the patient's individual scoring criteria. To ensure all patients potentially eligible for Financial Assistance under the FAP may receive Financial Assistance, IU Health Arnett will deem patients/guarantors to be presumptively eligible for Financial Assistance if they are found to be eligible for one of the following programs, received emergency or direct admit care, and satisfied his/her required co-pay/deductible: - Indiana Children's Special Health Care Services - Medicaid - Healthy Indiana Plan - Patients who are awarded Hospital Presumptive Eligibility (HPE) - Enrolled in a state and/or federal program that verifies the patient's gross household income is less than or equal to 200% of the Federal Poverty Level 7. Additional Considerations Financial Assistance may be granted to a deceased patient's account if said patient is found to have no estate. Additionally, IU Health Arnett will deny or revoke Financial Assistance for any patient or guarantor who falsifies any portion of a Financial Assistance application. 8. Patient Assets IU Health Arnett may consider patient/guarantor Assets in the calculation of a patient's true financial burden. A patient's/guarantor's primary residence and one (1) motor vehicle will be exempted from consideration in most cases. A patient's primary residence is defined as the patient's principal place of residence and will be excluded from a patient's extraordinary asset calculation so long as the patient's equity is less than five-hundred thousand dollars ($500,000) and the home is occupied by the patient/guarantor, patient's/guarantor's spouse or child under twenty-one (21) years of age. One (1) motor vehicle may be excluded as long as the patient's equity in the vehicle is less than fifty-thousand dollars ($50,000). IU Health Arnett reserves the right to request a list of all property owned by the patient/guarantor and adjust a patient's award of Financial Assistance if the patient demonstrates a claim or clear title to any extraordinary Asset not excluded from consideration under the above guidance. 9. Non-Emergent Services Down Payment Uninsured Patients presenting for scheduled or other non-emergent services will not be charged more than the AGB for their services. Patients will receive an estimated AGB cost of their care prior to IU Health Arnett rendering the services and will be asked to pay a down-payment percentage of the AGB adjusted cost prior to receiving services. In the event a patient is unable to fulfill the down-payment, their service may be rescheduled for a later date as medically prudent and in accordance with all applicable federal and state laws and/or regulations. 10. Emergency Services Non-Refundable Deposit This section will be implemented with a strict adherence to EMTALA and IU Health Policy ADM 1.32, Screening and Transfer of Emergency or Unstable Patients. Amount of Non-Refundable Deposit All Uninsured Patients presenting for services at IU Health Arnett's Emergency Department, via transfer from another hospital facility, or direct admission, will be responsible for a one-hundred dollar ($100.00) non-refundable deposit for services rendered. Patients/guarantors will be responsible for any copays and/or deductibles required by their plan prior to full Financial Assistance being applied. Uninsured Patients wishing to make an application for Financial Assistance greater than the AGB must fulfill their non-refundable deposit prior to IU Health Arnett processing said application. Uninsured Patients making payments toward their outstanding non-refundable deposit balance will have said payments applied to their oldest application on file, if applicable."

202003189349303485,263162145,"Schedule H, Part II - Promotion of Health in Communities Served","IU Health participates in a variety of community-building activities that address the social determinants of health in the communities it serves. IU Health and its related hospital entities across the State of Indiana (""IU Health Statewide System"") invest in economic development efforts across the state, collaborate with like-minded organizations through coalitions that address key issues, and advocate for improvements in the health status of vulnerable populations. This includes making contributions to community-building activities by providing investments and resources to local community initiatives that addressed economic development, community support and workforce development. Several examples include IU Health's support of the following organizations and initiatives that focus on some of the root causes of health issues, such as lack of education, employment and poverty: - Riggs Community Health Center - Starfish Initiative - Teach for America - United Way Additionally, through the IU Health Statewide System's team member community benefit service program team members across the state make a difference in the lives of thousands of Hoosiers every year."
202003189349303485,263162145,"Schedule H, Part III, Line 2 - Bad Debt Expense Methodology","The amount reported on line 2 as bad debt is reported at cost, as calculated using the cost to charge ratio methodology. SCHEDULE H, PART III, LINE 3 - Bad debt attributable to patients eligible under the Financial Assistance Policy an uninsured patient and/or guarantor who was admitted through an eligible facility's emergency department via a direct admission from a physician's office, or transfer from another hospital facility, and whose household income is less than or equal to 200% of the federal poverty level may be eligible for full charity assistance after the successful completion of the financial assistance application and satisfaction of his/her non-refundable deposit. To capture all patients who are potentially eligible for financial assistance under the IU Health Financial Assistance Policy, IU Health will deem patients/guarantors to be presumptively eligible for financial assistance if they are found to be eligible for one of the following programs, received emergency or direct admit care, and satisfied the required co-pay/deductible. 1. Indiana Children's Special Health Care Services 2. Medicaid 3. Healthy Indiana Plan 4. Patients who are awarded hospital presumptive eligibility 5. Enrolled in a state and/or federal program that verifies the patient's gross household income is less than or equal to 200% of the federal poverty level (FPL). IU Health also conducts a quarterly review of all accounts placed with a collection agency partner for a period of no less than one hundred and twenty (120) days after the account is eligible for an extraordinary collection actions. Said accounts may be eligible for assistance under the financial assistance policy based on the patient's individual scoring criteria and are not included in bad debt. Due to this comprehensive methodology. IU Health does not believe any amount of bad debt is attributable to patients who may be eligible under the financial assistance policy and no portion of bad debt is included as community benefit."
202003189349303485,263162145,"Schedule H, Part III, Line 4 - Bad Debt Expense","IU Health Arnett is a subsidiary in the consolidated financial statements of IU Health. IU Health's bad debt expense footnote is as follows: The Indiana University Health System does not require collateral or other security from its patients, substantially all of whom are residents of the State, for the delivery of health care services. However, consistent with industry practice, the Indiana University Health System routinely obtains assignment of (or is otherwise entitled to receive) patients' benefits payable under their health insurance programs, plans or policies (e.g., Medicare, Medicaid, managed care payers, and commercial insurance policies. The Indiana University Health System uses a portfolio approach to account for categories of patient contracts as a collective group, rather than recognizing revenue on an individual contract basis. The portfolios consist of major payer classes for inpatient revenue and outpatient revenue. Based on the historical collection trends and other analysis, the Indiana University Health System believes that revenue recognized by utilizing the portfolio approach approximates the revenue that would have been recognized if an individual contract approach were used. In support of its mission, the Indiana University Health System provides care to uninsured and underinsured patients. The Indiana University Health System provides charity care to patients who lack financial resources and are deemed to be medically indigent. Under its financial assistance policy, the Indiana University Health System provides medically necessary care to uninsured patients with inadequate financial resources at charitable discounts equivalent to the amounts generally billed, and it provides eligibility for full charity for emergent encounters for uninsured patients who earn less than 200% of the federal poverty level and who meet application criteria. Patients whose liability is deemed catastrophic relative to their annual household income are also eligible for reduced charges. Since the Indiana University Health System does not pursue collection of these amounts, the discounted amounts are not reported as patient service revenue. The Indiana University Health System uses presumptive eligibility screening procedures for free care and recognizes net patient service revenue on services provided to self-pay patients at the discounted rate at the time services are rendered. The estimated cost of charity care, using the consolidated cost to charge ratio, was $96,693,000 and $94,886,000 in 2019 and 2018, respectively."
202003189349303485,263162145,"Schedule H, Part III, Line 8 - Medicare Shortfall","The amount reported on Schedule H, Part III, Line 6 is calculated, in accordance with the Form 990 instructions, using ""allowable costs"" from the IU Health Arnett Medicare Cost Report. ""Allowable costs"" for Medicare Cost Report purposes, however, are not reflective of all costs associated with IU Health Arnett's participation in Medicare programs. For example, the Medicare Cost Report excludes certain costs such as billed physician services, the costs of Medicare Parts C and D, fee schedule reimbursed services, and durable medical equipment services. Inclusion of all costs associated with IU Health Arnett's participation in Medicare programs would significantly increase the Medicare shortfall reported on Schedule H, Part III, Line 7. IU Health Arnett's Medicare shortfall is attributable to reimbursements that are less than the cost of providing patient care and services to Medicare beneficiaries and does not include any amounts that result from inefficiencies or poor management. IU Arnett accepts all Medicare patients knowing that there may be shortfalls; therefore it has taken the position that any shortfall should be counted as part of its community benefit. Additionally, it is implied in Internal Revenue Service Revenue Ruling 69-545 that treating Medicare patients is a community benefit. Revenue Ruling 69-545, which established the community benefit standard for nonprofit hospitals, states that if a hospital serves patients with governmental health benefits, including Medicare, then this is an indication that the hospital operates to promote the health of the community."
202003189349303485,263162145,"Schedule H, Part III, Line 9b - Written Debt Collection Policy","IU Health Arnett's FAP and Written Debt Collection Policy describe the collection practices applicable to patients, including those who may qualify for financial assistance. 1. Financial Assistance Application Patients or their guarantors wishing to apply for Financial Assistance are encouraged to submit a Financial Assistance Application within ninety (90) days of their discharge. Patients or their guarantors may submit an application up to two-hundred and forty (240) days from the date of their first billing statement from IU Health, however, accounts may be subject to ECA as soon as one hundred and twenty (120) days after having received their first billing statement. Patients or their guarantors submitting an incomplete application will receive written notification of the application's deficiency upon discovery by IU health.The application will be pended for a period of forty-five (45) days from the date the notification is mailed. IU Health will suspend any ECA until the application is complete, or the patient fails to cure any deficiencies in their application in the allotted period. Patients with limited English proficiency may request to have a copy of the FAP, a FAP Application, and FAP Plain Language Summary in one of the below languages: - Arabic - Burmese - Burmese-Falam - Burmese-Hakha Chin - Mandarin/Chinese - Spanish The patient, and/or their representative, such as the patient's physician, family members, legal counsel, community or religious groups, social services or hospital personnel may request a FAP Application to be mailed to a patient's primary mailing address free of charge. IU Health keeps all applications and supporting documentation confidential. Patients applying for assistance under the FAP will be required to complete a Financial Assistance Application. Patients must include the following documentation with their Financial Assistance Application: - All sources of Income for the last three (3) months; - Most recent three (3) months of pay stubs or Supplemental Security Income via Social Security; - Most recent three (3) statements from checking and savings accounts, certificates of deposit, stocks, bonds and money market accounts; - Most recent state and Federal Income Tax forms including schedules C, D, E, and F. In the event a patient's and/or guarantor's income does not warrant the filing of a federal tax return, the patient may submit a notarized affidavit attesting to the foregoing; - Most recent W-2 statement; - For patients or members of the Household who are currently unemployed, Wage Inquiry from WorkOne; and - If applicable, divorce/dissolution decrees and child custody order 2. Eligibility Determination IU Health Arnett will inform patients or guarantors of the results of their application by providing the patient or guarantor with a Financial Assistance Determination within ninety (90) days of receiving a completed Application and all requested documentation. If a patient or guarantor is granted less than full charity assistance and the patient or guarantor provides additional information for reconsideration, IU Health Revenue Cycle Services may amend a prior Financial Assistance Determination. If a patient or guarantor seeks to appeal the Financial Assistance Determination further, a written request must be submitted, along with the supporting documentation, to the Financial Assistance Committee for additional review/reconsideration. All decisions of the Financial Assistance Committee are final. A patient's Financial Assistance Application and eligibility determination are specific to each individual date(s) of service and related encounters. 3. Extraordinary Collection Actions IU Health Arnett may refer delinquent patient accounts to a third-party collection agency after utilizing reasonable efforts to determine a patient's eligibility for assistance under the FAP. IU Health and its third-party collection agencies may initiate ECA against a patient or their guarantor in accordance with this Policy and 26 C.F.R. 1.501(r). Said ECA may include the following: - Selling a patient's or their guarantor's outstanding financial responsibility to a third party. - Reporting adverse information about the patient or their guarantor to consumer credit reporting agencies or credit bureaus. - Deferring or denying, or requiring a payment before providing, medically necessary care because of a patient's or their guarantor's nonpayment of one or more bills for previously provided care covered under the FAP. - Actions requiring a legal or judicial process, including but not limited to placing a lien on patient's or their guarantor's property, foreclosing on a patient's or their guarantor's real property attaching or seizing a patient's or their guarantor's bank account or other personal property, commencing a civil action against a patient or their guarantor, causing a patient or guarantor's arrest, causing a patient and/or guarantor to be subject to a writ of body attachment, and garnishing a patient or guarantor's wages. When it is necessary to engage in such action, IU Health Arnett and its third party collection agencies, will engage in fair, respectful and transparent collections activities. Patients or guarantors currently subject to an ECA who have not previously applied for Financial Assistance may apply for assistance up to two-hundred and forty (240) days of the date of their first billing statement from IU Health. IU Health and their third-party collection agencies will suspend any ECA engaged on a patient or their guarantor while an Application is being processed and considered. 4. Refunds Patients eligible for assistance under the FAP who remitted payment to IU Health Arnett in excess of their patient responsibility will be alerted to the overpayment as promptly after discovery as is reasonable given the nature of the overpayment. Patients with an outstanding account balance on a separate account not eligible for assistance under the FAP will have their refund applied to the outstanding balance. Patients without an outstanding account balance described above will be issued a refund check for their overpayment as soon as technically feasible."

The IU Health Statewide system is Indiana's most comprehensive healthcare system. With hospitals, physician offices and allied services, IU Health provides access to a full range of specialty and primary care services for adults and children. A unique partnership with Indiana University School of Medicine - one of the nation's leading medical schools - gives patients access to groundbreaking research and innovative treatments to complement high-quality care. National Recognition - Eight hospitals designated as Magnet by the American Nurses Credentialing Center recognizing excellence in nursing care. - IU Health Medical Center is honored to be nationally ranked by U.S. News & World Report for the 22nd year in a row. According to the U.S. News rankings, IU Health Medical Center is the No. 1 ranked hospital in Indiana and Indianapolis and the only nationally ranked adult hospital in the state. For 2019-2020, IU Health Medical Center was rated as high performing nationally in five specialties, with a sixth specialty achieving a top 50 national ranking: - Cancer - high performing - Gastroenterology - high performing - Geriatrics - ranked 45th in nation - Nephrology - high performing - Neurology & Neurosurgery - high performing - Urology - high performing Besides IU Health Medical Center, IU Health has three other hospitals among the 10 top ranked hospitals in Indiana: IU Health Ball Memorial (#5), IU Health Arnett (#8) and IU Health Bloomington (#8) hospitals. The annual rankings, now in their 30th year, are designed to assist patients and their doctors in making informed decisions about where to receive care for challenging health conditions or for common elective procedures. Education and Research As an academic health center, IU Health works in partnership with the IU School of Medicine to train physicians, blending breakthrough research and treatments with the highest quality of patient care. Each year, more than 1,000 residents and fellows receive training in IU Health hospitals. Research conducted by IU School of Medicine faculty gives IU Health physicians and patients access to the most leading-edge and comprehensive treatment options. In 2017, IU Health and the IU School of Medicine announced that they would invest $50 million over six years in the Strategic Research Initiative, a new research collaboration that has enhanced the institutions' joint capabilities in fundamental scientific investigation, translational research and clinical trials. The initial focus is on projects in the fields of neuroscience, cancer and cardiovascular disease with the goal to fund transformative proposals that will fundamentally change the understanding of these diseases and lead to important new therapies for patients. The three target research areas represent research strengths at IU School of Medicine, key strategic service lines for IU Health, and important medical needs in a time of an aging population and rising healthcare costs: - Cancer: One of the initiative's primary goals is to enable the IU Health Melvin and Bren Simon Cancer Center to attain the National Cancer Institute's (NCI) top status of ""comprehensive,"" which would recognize it as one of the top-tier cancer centers in the nation. This designation was achieved in August 2019 making the center the only NCI-designated Comprehensive Cancer Center in Indiana and one of just 51 in the nation. - Neuroscience: The neurosciences research program tackles a broad range of brain injuries, neurodegenerative disorders and neurodevelopmental disorders. - Cardiovascular: The cardiovascular research initiative develops a comprehensive program for the study and treatment of heart failure, from newborns to older adults. A top priority is developing a cardiovascular genetics program. The Strategic Research Initiative provides patients with access to internationally renowned physicians and to new therapies developed through translational research and clinical trials, and will make use of the latest genetic tools to develop personalized therapies that are more effective for individuals and efficient for healthcare providers. IU Health Statewide System IU Health is a part of the IU Health Statewide System which continues to broaden its reach and positive impact throughout the state of Indiana. IU Health is Indiana's most comprehensive academic health center and consists of IU Health Methodist Hospital, IU Health University Hospital, Riley Hospital for Children at IU Health, and IU Health Saxony Hospital.

A comprehensive community outreach strategy and community benefit plan is in place that encompasses the academic medical center downtown Indianapolis, suburban Indianapolis and statewide entities around priority areas that focus on health improvement efforts statewide. IU Health is keenly aware of the positive impact it can have on the communities of need in the state of Indiana by focusing on the most pressing needs in a systematic and strategic way. In 2019, IU Health provided more than $738 million in total community benefit and served more than one million individuals. Some ways we address our community health priorities as a system include: IU Health Day of Service The annual IU Health Days of Service is a high-impact event aimed at engaging IU Health team members in activities that address an identified community priority health need. Each year, more than 2,000 IU Health team members volunteer during the Days of Service. Community Health Initiatives With investments in high-quality and impactful initiatives to address community health needs statewide, IU Health is helping Indiana residents improve their health and their quality of life. In 2019, IU Health impacted many people statewide through educational presentations, health risk screenings, health education programs, and additional health educational opportunities made available to the community, especially to our community members in the greatest need of such services. Twenty-four local organizations are benefitting from grants awarded by IU Health. In 2019, IU Health Community Outreach and Engagement awarded more than $900,000 to community organizations and institutions which - like IU Health - are addressing the health needs of the community.

For inpatient services, the limit is the TEFRA target limit. The hospital, on occasion, exceeds the target rate and does not receive full cost reimbursement. The TEFRA target amount is updated by the Medicare program annually by the TEFRA updating factor. However, the amount of the TEFRA updating factor is always significantly less than the actual healthcare inflation factor because the Medicare program includes a ""budget neutrality"" factor for the overall Medicare program. For outpatient services, the limit is the payment to cost ratio (PCR). The PCR was established using a base year, which was 1996, at a rate of 85.5% of cost. The PCR for all PPS-exempt cancer centers was 88% through 12/31/18, and then 88% from 1/1/19 to 5/31/19; therefore, the hospital currently does not receive payment for 12% of its outpatient cost."

Miami-Dade is the seventh largest county in the nation and represents 12.3% of Florida's population. It is one of the few counties in the United States that is ""minority-majority,"" in that a racial/ethnic minority group comprises the majority of the population with approximately 67.5% Latino or Hispanic residents; 16.3% black, non-Hispanic; 13.7% white, non-Hispanic; 1.5% Asian; 0.1 American Indian and Alaska Native; 0.3% other race alone and approximately 0.3% of non-Hispanic residents identified with more than one race. Miami-Dade County has a relatively young population with 84.7% of residents under age 65 and 20.5% under the age of 18, with a median resident age of 39.5 years old. This diversity is often thought to represent the future demographics of the United States in 2050. In Miami Dade County, nearly 20% of all individuals live below the federal poverty level (e.g., annual income of $25,750 for a family of four), as compared to 14% in Florida overall. The SocioNeeds Index, developed by the Conduent Healthy Communities Institute, is a measure of socioeconomic need calculated from several social and economic factors, ranging from poverty to education, which may impact health and/or access to care. The Index is correlated with potentially preventable hospitalization rates related to chronic conditions, diabetes, and obesity. Index values range from 0 to 100, in which 100 represents communities with the greatest socioeconomic need. The median score for Miami-Dade County is 74.5 out of 100, which is indicative of poor health outcomes due to high needs within the community. The SocioNeeds Index further confirms the socioeconomic disparities observed among residents of Miami-Dade County. This map illustrates the socioeconomic status of Miami-Dade County residents based on the SocioNeeds Index. In addition to the SocioNeeds Index, a rank measure is calculated by comparing the SocioNeeds Index of all zip codes in Miami-Dade County (a rank of 5 represents high need, while a rank of 1 represents low need). More than one-third of Miami-Dade County residents live in ZIP codes identified as those with the ""greatest need"" (5). Over 70% of residents reside in ZIP codes with a SocioNeeds Index score of a three (3) or higher. The top ten leading causes of death in Miami-Dade County are:1. Heart Disease2. Cancer3. Stroke4. Chronic Lower Respiratory Disease5. Unintentional Injury6. Alzheimer's Disease7. Diabetes8. Influenza and Pneumonia9. Nephritis, Nephrotic Syndrome and Nephrosis10.

The Rockefeller University Hospital is a unique institution. As an institution solely committed to conducting clinical research our community/service area is defined as the New York Metropolitan Area. The Rockefeller University Hospital has provided an array of clinical research and patient care services since its founding in 1910. The Rockefeller University Hospital community served/service area is determined based on research being conducted. Principal Investigators identify an area of interest and submit a protocol for review and approval by our institutional review board. If and when the protocol is approved, our recruitment office works with the investigator to develop and submit advertisements in local newspapers, magazines and online. Identification of lucrative places to advertise is determined by current trends in readership among local newspapers, magazines and visits to particular websites such as Craigslist and Facebook. Research participants are culled from all over New York City as well as through collaborations with neighboring hospitals, Universities, and clinics. As a result, our enrolled research participant demographics are similar to those of New York City overall. In calendar year 2019 14% of research participants identified as Hispanic, 30% identified as Black or African-American and 38% identified as white (RUH subject race and ethnicity report 2019), which is similar to the geographic makeup of New York City (42.8% white, 24.3% Black or African-American, and 29.1% Hispanic) https://www.census.gov/quickfacts/fact/table/newyorkcitynewyork,US/PST045219."

For inpatient services, the limit is the TEFRA target limit. The hospital, on occasion, exceeds the target rate and does not receive full cost reimbursement. The TEFRA target amount is updated by the Medicare program annually by the TEFRA updating factor. However, the amount of the TEFRA updating factor is always significantly less than the actual healthcare inflation factor because the Medicare program includes a ""budget neutrality"" factor for the overall Medicare program. For outpatient services, the limit is the payment to cost ratio (PCR). The PCR was established using a base year, which was 1996, at a rate of 85.5% of cost. The PCR for all PPS-exempt cancer centers was 88% through 12/31/19, and then 89% from 1/1/20 to 5/31/20; therefore, the hospital currently does not receive payment for 11-12% of its outpatient cost."

Miami-Dade County has a relatively young population with 83.3% of persons under age 65 and 20.2% under the age of 18. In Miami Dade County, 15.7% of all individuals live below the federal poverty level, with a median household income of $51,347 as compared to 12.7% and 55,600 respectively in the State of Florida. The SocioNeeds Index, developed by the Conduent Healthy Communities Institute, is a measure of socioeconomic need calculated from several social and economic factors, ranging from poverty to education, which may impact health and/or access to care. The Index is correlated with potentially preventable hospitalization rates related to chronic conditions, diabetes, and obesity. Index values range from 0 to 100, in which 100 represents communities with the greatest socioeconomic need. The median score for Miami-Dade County is 67.7 out of 100, which is indicative of poor health outcomes due to high needs within the community. The SocioNeeds Index further confirms the socioeconomic disparities observed among residents of Miami-Dade County. In addition to the SocioNeeds Index, a rank measure is calculated by comparing the SocioNeeds Index of all zip codes in Miami-Dade County (a rank of 5 represents high need, while a rank of 1 represents low need). More than one-third (36.3%) of Miami-Dade County residents live in ZIP codes identified as those with the ""greatest need"" (5). More than two-thirds (67.5%) of residents reside in ZIP codes with a SocioNeeds Index score of a three (3) or higher. In 2019, the ten leading causes of death in Miami-Dade County were heart disease, cancer, stroke, Alzheimer's disease, chronic lower respiratory disease, unintentional injury, diabetes, Parkinson's Disease, nephritis/nephrotic syndrome and nephrosis, and hypertension; seven of which are explicityly addressed in our Community Health Needs Assessment."
