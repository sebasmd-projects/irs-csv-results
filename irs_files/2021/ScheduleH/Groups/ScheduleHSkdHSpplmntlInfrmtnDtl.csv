PATIENT ACCOUNTS RECEIVABLE ARE STATED AT NET REALIZABLE VALUE. AHHC EVALUATES THE COLLECTABILITY OF ITS ACCOUNTS RECEIVABLE BASED ON THE LENGTH OF TIME THE RECEIVABLE IS OUTSTANDING, PAYER CLASS, HISTORICAL COLLECTION EXPERIENCE, AND TRENDS IN HEALTH CARE INSURANCE PROGRAMS. ACCOUNTS RECEIVABLE ARE CHARGED TO THE ALLOWANCE FOR UNCOLLECTIBLE ACCOUNTS WHEN THEY ARE DEEMED UNCOLLECTIBLE.THE COSTING METHODOLOGY USED IN DETERMINING THE AMOUNTS REPORTED ON LINES 2 AND 3 IS BASED ON THE RATIO OF PATIENT CARE COST TO CHARGES. THE UNREIMBURSED COST OF BAD DEBT WAS CALCULATED BY APPLYING THE ORGANIZATION'S COST TO CHARGE RATIO FROM THE MEDICARE COST REPORTS (CMS 2252-96 WORKSHEET C, PART 1, PPS INPATIENT RATIOS) TO THE ORGANIZATION'S BAD DEBT PROVISION PER GENERALLY ACCEPTED ACCOUNTING PRINCIPLES, LESS ANY PATIENT OR THIRD PARTY PAYOR PAYMENTS RECEIVED.ADVOCATE MAKES EVERY EFFORT TO IDENTIFY THOSE PATIENTS WHO ARE ELIGIBLE FOR FINANCIAL ASSISTANCE BY STRICTLY ADHERING TO ITS FINANCIAL ASSISTANCE POLICY. WE BELIEVE THAT ADVOCATE HAS A POPULATION OF PATIENTS WHO ARE UNINSURED OR UNDERINSURED BUT WHO DO NOT COMPLETE THE FINANCIAL ASSISTANCE APPLICATION. THE ESTIMATED AMOUNT OF BAD DEBT EXPENSE (AT COST) WHICH COULD BE REASONABLY ATTRIBUTABLE TO PATIENTS WHO WOULD LIKELY QUALIFY FOR FINANCIAL ASSISTANCE UNDER THE ORGANIZATION'S FINANCIAL ASSISTANCE POLICY, IF SUFFICIENT INFORMATION HAD BEEN AVAILABLE TO MAKE A DETERMINATION OF THEIR ELIGIBILITY, WAS BASED UPON SELF PAY PATIENT ACCOUNTS WHICH HAD AMOUNTS WRITTEN OFF TO BAD DEBTS. OUR METHOD WAS TO BEGIN WITH THE SELF-PAY PORTION OF BAD DEBT EXPENSE PROVISION. THE SELF-PAY PORTION EXCLUDES THOSE PATIENTS WHO HAD FINANCIAL ASSISTANCE APPLICATIONS PENDING AT THE TIME OF SERVICE. THIS COST WAS THEN REDUCED BY CHARGES IDENTIFIED AS TRUE BAD DEBT EXPENSE, INCLUDING COPAYS FOR PATIENTS WHO QUALIFIED FOR LESS THAN 100% FINANCIAL ASSISTANCE. THE COST TO CHARGE RATIO WAS THEN APPLIED TO THE REMAINING CHARGES, TO DETERMINE THE VALUE (AT COST) OF PATIENT ACCOUNTS THAT DID NOT COMPLETE FINANCIAL COUNSELING AND WERE ASSIGNED TO BAD DEBT. WE BELIEVE THIS PROCESS IS A REASONABLE BASIS FOR OUR ESTIMATE. AS WE ARE ONLY CONSIDERING SELF-PAY ACCOUNTS WRITTEN OFF TO BAD DEBT FOR THIS ESTIMATE, THIS ESTIMATE DOES NOT INCLUDE THE IMMEDIATE 20% DISCOUNT TO CHARGES WHICH IS APPLIED TO ALL SELF-PAY PATIENTS. IT ALSO DOES NOT INCLUDE ACCOUNT BALANCES OR CO-PAYS OF NON-SELF PAY ACCOUNTS WHICH ARE WRITTEN OFF TO BAD DEBT WHEN THE PATIENT HAS NO OTHER FINANCIAL RESOURCES TO PAY THESE AMOUNTS AND THE PATIENT DOES NOT APPLY FOR FINANCIAL ASSISTANCE.BAD DEBT AMOUNTS HAVE BEEN EXCLUDED FROM OTHER COMMUNITY BENEFIT AMOUNTS REPORTED THROUGHOUT SCHEDULE H."

ADVOCATE AURORA'S SYSTEM LEADERSHIP HAS HISTORICALLY AND CURRENTLY DIRECTS AND SUPPORTS THE HOSPITALS IN THEIR EFFORTS TO ADDRESS IDENTIFIED COMMUNITY HEALTH NEEDS. IN 2016, A COMMUNITY HEALTH DEPARTMENT WAS DEVELOPED BY ADVOCATE, LED BY A SYSTEM EXECUTIVE AND STAFFED WITH PUBLIC/COMMUNITY HEALTH SPECIALISTS, TO EXECUTE COMMUNITY NEEDS ASSESSMENTS, EVIDENCE-BASED PROGRAM DEVELOPMENT AND COLLABORATIVE PARTNERSHIPS WITHIN THE COMMUNITIES SERVED BY ADVOCATE. PRIOR TO THIS TIME, THE COMMUNITY FACING FUNCTION WAS LED BY A TEAM OF ADVOCATE SYSTEM-LEVEL INDIVIDUALS WHOSE JOB RESPONSIBILITIES INCLUDED VARIOUS COMMUNITY ROLES MORE CLOSELY ALIGNED WITH COMMUNITY RELATIONS. DURING THE INITIAL 2011-2013 CHNA CYCLE, ADVOCATE'S SYSTEM LEADERS PROVIDED OVERSIGHT AND SUPPORT TO THE HOSPITALS FOR DEVELOPING THEIR CHNAS AND SUBSEQUENT PROGRAMMING. IN 2016, ADVOCATE'S NEW COMMUNITY HEALTH TEAM CONDUCTED THEIR HOSPITAL COMPREHENSIVE CHNAS (2014-2016) AND POSTED GOVERNANCE-APPROVED CHNA REPORTS AND CHNA IMPLEMENTATION PLANS ON ADVOCATE'S WEBPAGE IN COMPLIANCE WITH THE AFFORDABLE CARE ACT. FOLLOWING THE MERGER OF ADVOCATE HEALTH CARE AND AURORA HEALTH CARE IN 2018 AND BOARD APPROVAL OF THE NEW COMMUNITY STRATEGY IN 2019, ALL ADVOCATE HOSPITALS' COMMUNITY HEALTH IMPLEMENTATION PLANS ARE GUIDED BY THE AAH COMMUNITY STRATEGY.

FINANCIAL ASSISTANCE. ADVOCATE OFFERS A VERY GENEROUS FINANCIAL ASSISTANCE PROGRAM, REQUIRING NO PAYMENTS FROM THE PATIENTS MOST IN NEED, AND PROVIDING DISCOUNTS TO UNINSURED AND INSURED PATIENTS. FROM JANUARY 2019 TO MAY 2019, UNINSURED PATIENTS EARNING UP TO SIX TIMES THE FEDERAL POVERTY LEVEL (FPL), AND INSURED PATIENTS EARNING UP TO FOUR TIMES THE FPL WERE ELIGIBLE TO BE CONSIDERED FOR A FULL OR PARTIAL FINANCIAL ASSISTANCE DISCOUNT. AS OF JUNE 2019, PATIENTS EARNING UP TO SIX TIMES THE FPL, AND INSURED PATIENTS EARNING UP TO TWO AND HALF TIMES THE FPL MAY QUALIFY FOR A FULL OR PARTIAL FINANCIAL ASSISTANCE DISCOUNT. ADDITIONALLY, A CATASTROPHIC ASSISTANCE DISCOUNT WAS ADDED FOR UNINSURED AND INSURED PATIENTS WHOSE INCOMES EXCEED THE TRADITIONAL FINANCIAL ASSISTANCE INCOME GUIDELINES AND HAVE OUTSTANDING PATIENT BALANCES OF $25,000 OR MORE FOR A SINGLE DATE OF SERVICE OR SUM OF SEVERAL DATES OF SERVICE. THESE PATIENTS MAY QUALIFY TO RECEIVE A FINANCIAL ASSISTANCE DISCOUNT THAT REDUCES THEIR OUTSTANDING BALANCE TO 25% OF THEIR NET INCOME. FOR UNINSURED PATIENTS, ADVOCATE WILL PRESUMPTIVELY PROVIDE FINANCIAL ASSISTANCE IF THE FINANCIAL STATUS HAS BEEN VERIFIED BY A THIRD PARTY. IN THESE CASES, THE PATIENT IS NOT REQUIRED TO SUBMIT A SEPARATE CHARITY APPLICATION. IF PRESUMPTIVE CRITERIA ARE NOT AVAILABLE FOR UNINSURED PATIENTS, FINANCIAL ASSISTANCE ELIGIBILITY IS AVAILABLE USING AN INCOME-BASED SCREENING. ADVOCATE EXTENDS ITS INCOME-BASED FINANCIAL ASSISTANCE POLICY TO ITS INSURED PATIENTS AS WELL.

THE INDEX IS CALCULATED FROM SIX INDICATORS, ONE EACH FROM THE FOLLOWING TOPICS: POVERTY, INCOME, UNEMPLOYMENT, OCCUPATION, EDUCATION AND LANGUAGE. THE INDICATORS ARE WEIGHTED TO MAXIMIZE THE CORRELATION OF THE INDEX WITH PREMATURE DEATH RATES AND PREVENTABLE HOSPITALIZATION RATES. ALL ZIP CODES, COUNTIES, AND COUNTY EQUIVALENTS IN THE U.S. ARE GIVEN AN INDEX VALUE FROM 0 (LOW NEED) TO 100 (HIGH NEED). TO HELP IDENTIFY THE AREAS OF HIGHEST NEED WITHIN A DEFINED GEOGRAPHIC AREA, THE SELECTED ZIP CODES ARE RANKED FROM 1 (LOW NEED) TO 5 (HIGH NEED) BASED ON THEIR INDEX VALUE. THESE VALUES ARE SORTED FROM LOW TO HIGH AND DIVIDED INTO FIVE RANKS USING NATURAL BREAKS. THESE RANKS ARE THEN USED TO COLOR THE ZIP CODES WITH THE HIGHEST SOCIONEEDS RANKINGS WITH THE DARKER COLORS. MCLEAN COUNTY HAS SEVERAL COMMUNITIES THAT HAVE GREATER SOCIOECONOMIC NEEDS COMPARED TO OTHER COMMUNITIES IN THE COUNTY.

202003239349301515,362169147,"SCHEDULE H, PART VI, LINE 5 - ADVOCATE BROMENN MEDICAL CENTER","ADVOCATE BROMENN HAD SEVERAL SIGNIFICANT CAPITAL PROJECTS OR EXPENSES IN 2019 THAT IMPROVED PATIENT CARE OR CONTRIBUTED TO A HEALTHIER COMMUNITY ENVIRONMENT. THE MOTHER-BABY UNIT PURCHASED THE VOLUSON ULTRASOUND MACHINE FOR USE BY PHYSICIANS ON THE UNIT. THE VOLUSON IMPROVES PATIENT CARE BY ALLOWING PHYSICIANS TO IMMEDIATELY EVALUATE FETAL WELL-BEING, POSITION OF THE BABY AND AMNIOTIC FLUID LEVEL. ADDITIONALLY, THE ULTRASOUND MACHINE IS VALUABLE FOR OBSTETRICAL EMERGENCIES.RADIOLOGY PURCHASED THE PRONE BIOPSY SYSTEM WHICH IS A STEREOTACTIC BIOPSY TABLE. STEREOTACTIC BIOPSIES ARE DONE WITH BREAST MASSES ONLY SEEN ON MAMMOGRAPHY. THIS TABLE ALLOWS CLINICIANS TO USE 3D IMAGES FOR THE BIOPSY, RATHER THAN JUST 2D. WHEN MASSES SHOW UP ON 3D IMAGES ONLY, PATIENTS WERE BEING REFERRED OUT OF THE COMMUNITY FOR THE BIOPSY. NOW THEY CAN STAY LOCAL FOR THEIR CARE. IN 2019, SEVERAL PIECES OF EQUIPMENT WERE PURCHASED FOR THE OPERATING ROOM TO IMPROVE PATIENT CARE. THEY ARE AS FOLLOWS:1) SAVI SCOUT TECHNOLOGY PLACES A RFID MARKER IN RADIOLOGY TO ASSIST SURGEONS IN LOCATING AND EXCISING BREAST TUMORS.2) ANESTHESIA FLUID VOLUME MONITOR ALLOWS ANESTHESIA PROVIDERS TO PRECISELY MONITOR THE AMOUNT OF IV FLUIDS GIVEN PATIENTS TO ENSURE THEY DO NOT EXPERIENCE COMPLICATIONS FROM TOO MUCH, OR TOO LITTLE FLUIDS DURING SURGERY.3) STEALTHSTATION NAVIGATION SYSTEM IMAGING SYSTEM THAT ALLOWS FOR PRECISE AND ACCURATE PLACEMENT OF SURGICAL HARDWARE PLACED DURING SPINE AND NEUROSURGERY.4) CUB CRIB PEDIATRIC SURGICAL PATIENT CART/BED.5) CUSA ABLATION SYSTEM ALLOWS NEUROSURGEONS TO EXCISE AND REMOVE SPINAL AND BRAIN TUMORS.6) S5 HEART LUNG PERFUSION SYSTEM COMMONLY USED IN HEART SURGERY, THIS SYSTEM ALLOWS PATIENT'S BLOOD TO BYPASS THEIR OWN HEART AND BE CIRCULATED BACK THROUGHOUT THE PATIENT'S BODY.IN 2019, THE LAB PURCHASED TWO PIECES OF EQUIPMENT THAT IMPROVE PATIENT CARE. THE FIRST ARE THE CS2500 COAGULATION ANALYZERS THAT WERE BROUGHT INTO ADVOCATE BROMENN'S HEMATOLOGY DEPARTMENT. THIS HAS ENABLED THE LABORATORY TO REDUCE REAGENT ERROR RATES AND MOVE TO A PLATFORM THAT IS SUPPORTED BY THE MANUFACTURER. PREVIOUSLY, ALL REAGENTS WERE MANUALLY ENTERED INTO THE ANALYZER, AND PLACED IN SPECIFIC LOCATIONS. IF THE REAGENT WAS PLACED IN AN INCORRECT LOCATION, OR THERE WAS A MIX UP BETWEEN TWO REAGENTS; THE ANALYZER WOULD NOT KNOW. THE CS2500 HAS BARCODE SCANNING FOR ALL REAGENTS AND QUALITY CONTROL MATERIAL THAT IS PLACED ON THE INSTRUMENT. THIS ENSURES THAT THE CORRECT REAGENT IS BEING USED FOR ALL PATIENT TESTING. FURTHERMORE, IT TRACKS VOLUME OF REAGENT MORE PRECISELY WHICH REDUCES OVERALL WASTE. ENSURING THAT PROPER REAGENTS ARE USED FOR TESTING MAKES A DIFFERENCE IN THE REPORTED VALUE FOR SUCH CRITICAL COAGULATION TESTING. WITHOUT THIS, PATIENTS COULD BE SUBJECTED TO UNNECESSARY TRANSFUSIONS OR THEIR ANTICOAGULANT DOSE COULD BE MISS-MONITORED. THE ADDITION OF THE CS2500S HAVE REDUCED THE HUMAN ERROR RATE, SUBSEQUENTLY OFFERING SAFER RESULTS TO CLINICIANS. THE SECOND PIECE OF EQUIPMENT PURCHASED BY THE LAB IS THE MICROBIAL ID SYS-VITEK 2. IN 2019, IT WAS DETERMINED THAT THE CURRENT VITEK2 ANALYZER WAS WELL BEYOND ITS LIFE EXPECTANCY OF 10 YEARS AND THE PC SUPPORTING THE ANALYZER WAS OUTDATED AND NO LONGER ABLE TO ACCEPT UPDATES. IN MICROBIOLOGY, THERE ARE CONSTANT UPDATES IN REGARD TO MICROORGANISM NAMES, LIKE GENUS AND SPECIES AS WELL AS UPDATES FROM THE CDC, FDA AND CLSI IN REGARD TO SUSCEPTIBILITY BREAK POINTS. SUSCEPTIBILITY BREAKPOINTS ARE THE INFORMATION A PHARMACIST OR PHYSICIAN NEEDS TO KNOW TO DETERMINE IF A PARTICULAR ANTIMICROBIAL WILL BE EFFECTIVE AGAINST THE CAUSE OF DISEASE. THE NEW VERSION OF MIDDLEWARE SOFTWARE THAT ACCOMPANIED THE ANALYZER IS ALSO ABLE TO SUPPORT THE CURRENT BLOOD CULTURE ANALYZER WHICH STREAMLINES STAFF WORKLOAD."
202003239349301515,362169147,"SCHEDULE H, PART VI, LINE 2 - ADVOCATE TRINITY HOSPITAL","METHODOLOGYTIMELINE. ADVOCATE TRINITY'S CHNA PROCESS UTILIZED A MIXED METHODS APPROACH, WHICH INCLUDED THE COLLECTION AND REVIEW OF SECONDARY DATA FROM EXISTING SOURCES AND PRIMARY DATA FROM BOTH QUALITATIVE (SURVEY) AND QUANTITATIVE METHODS (FOCUS GROUPS). THE METHODOLOGY FOR THE CHNA HAD THREE COMPONENTS: 1) USE OF DATA COLLECTED THROUGH THE ALLIANCE (FEBRUARY 2018-MARCH 2019); 2) USE OF THE CONDUENT HEALTHY COMMUNITY INSTITUTE'S PLATFORM TO REVIEW PSA, COUNTY, STATE AND ZIP CODE LEVEL DATA (MARCH 2016- AUGUST 2019); AND 3) USE OF INTERNAL HOSPITAL DATA (2017).COLLABORATIVE ASSESSMENT MODEL AND PROCESS. THE ALLIANCE COMPLETED A COLLABORATIVE CHNA BETWEEN MARCH 2018 AND MARCH 2019. PRIMARY AND SECONDARY DATA FROM A DIVERSE RANGE OF SOURCES WERE UTILIZED FOR ROBUST DATA ANALYSIS AND TO IDENTIFY COMMUNITY HEALTH NEEDS IN CHICAGO AND SUBURBAN COOK COUNTY. THE IPHI WORKED WITH THE CHNA COMMITTEE AND STEERING COMMITTEE OF THE ALLIANCE TO DESIGN AND FACILITATE A COLLABORATIVE, COMMUNITY ENGAGED ASSESSMENT. AS WITH THE 2015-2016 COLLABORATIVE CHNA, THE 2017-2019 CHNA PROCESS IS ADAPTED FROM THE MOBILIZING FOR ACTION THROUGH PLANNING AND PARTNERSHIPS (MAPP) FRAMEWORK, A COMMUNITY-ENGAGED STRATEGIC PLANNING FRAMEWORK THAT WAS DEVELOPED BY THE NATIONAL ASSOCIATION FOR COUNTY AND CITY HEALTH OFFICIALS (NACCHO) AND THE CDC. BOTH THE CHICAGO AND COOK COUNTY DEPARTMENTS OF PUBLIC HEALTH USE THE MAPP FRAMEWORK FOR COMMUNITY HEALTH ASSESSMENT AND PLANNING. THE MAPP FRAMEWORK PROMOTES A SYSTEM FOCUS, EMPHASIZING THE IMPORTANCE OF COMMUNITY ENGAGEMENT, PARTNERSHIP DEVELOPMENT, AND THE DYNAMIC INTERPLAY OF FACTORS AND FORCES WITHIN THE PUBLIC HEALTH SYSTEM. THE ALLIANCE CHOSE THIS INCLUSIVE, COMMUNITY-DRIVEN PROCESS TO LEVERAGE AND ALIGN WITH HEALTH DEPARTMENT ASSESSMENTS AND TO ACTIVELY ENGAGE STAKEHOLDERS, INCLUDING COMMUNITY MEMBERS, IN IDENTIFYING AND ADDRESSING STRATEGIC PRIORITIES TO ADVANCE HEALTH EQUITY.PRIMARY DATA COLLECTION. MULTIPLE DATA COLLECTION STRATEGIES WERE EMPLOYED FOR THE 20172019 CHNA. PRIMARY DATA COLLECTION FOR THE CHNA WAS CONDUCTED BY THE ALLIANCE AND COLLABORATIVE PARTNERS UTILIZING FOUR METHODS, INCLUDING COMMUNITY INPUT SURVEYS, COMMUNITY RESIDENT FOCUS GROUPS AND LEARNING MAP SESSIONS, HEALTH CARE AND SOCIAL SERVICE PROVIDER FOCUS GROUPS, AND FORCES OF CHANGE ASSESSMENT (FOCA) AND HEALTH EQUITY CAPACITY ASSESSMENT LED BY PARTNER HEALTH DEPARTMENTS.COMMUNITY INPUT SURVEYS. BETWEEN OCTOBER 2018 AND FEBRUARY 2019, THE ALLIANCE PARTNERS COLLECTED 5,934 COMMUNITY-WIDE INPUT SURVEYS FROM INDIVIDUALS 18 OR OLDER LIVING IN CHICAGO AND SUBURBAN COOK COUNTY. THERE WERE 574 SURVEY RESPONSES COLLECTED FROM ADVOCATE TRINITY'S SERVICE AREA. THE SURVEYS WERE AVAILABLE ON PAPER AND ONLINE, AND WERE DISSEMINATED IN ENGLISH, SPANISH, CHINESE AND POLISH. THE SURVEYS INCLUDED QUESTIONS ASKING RESPONDENTS ABOUT THE HEALTH STATUS OF THEIR COMMUNITIES, COMMUNITY STRENGTHS, OPPORTUNITIES FOR IMPROVEMENT AND PRIORITY HEALTH NEEDS. HOSPITALS, COMMUNITY-BASED ORGANIZATIONS AND HEALTH DEPARTMENTS DISTRIBUTED THE SURVEYS WITH THE INTENTION OF GAINING INSIGHT FROM PRIORITY POPULATIONS THAT ARE TYPICALLY UNDERREPRESENTED IN ASSESSMENT PROCESSES. PRIORITY POPULATIONS INCLUDED COMMUNITIES OF COLOR, IMMIGRANTS, LGBTQ+ COMMUNITY MEMBERS, INDIVIDUALS WITH DISABILITIES AND LOW-INCOME COMMUNITIES. THE INTENTION OF THE COMMUNITY INPUT SURVEY WAS TO COMPLEMENT EXISTING COMMUNITY HEALTH SURVEYS DISTRIBUTED THROUGHOUT CHICAGO AND SUBURBAN COOK COUNTY BY LOCAL HEALTH DEPARTMENTS. IPHI AND THE CHNA COMMITTEE TOOK THE FOLLOWING STEPS TO DEVELOP THE SURVEY TOOL: (1) IPHI DRAFTED A SURVEY BASED ON REVIEW OF 13 EXAMPLE COMMUNITY INPUT SURVEYS; (2) CHNA COMMITTEE MEMBERS FROM HOSPITALS AND HEALTH DEPARTMENTS PROVIDED INPUT; (3) IPHI INCORPORATED REVISIONS FROM CHNA COMMITTEE MEMBERS AND THE UNIVERSITY OF ILLINOIS AT CHICAGO SURVEY RESEARCH LABORATORY; (4) IPHI MADE EDITS BASED ON A HEALTH LITERACY REVIEW; (5) IPHI AND TWO MEMBER HOSPITALS PILOTED THE SURVEY AT THREE COMMUNITY-BASED EVENTS; AND (6) IPHI MADE FINAL EDITS TO ADDRESS MINOR CHALLENGES IDENTIFIED AT THE PILOT EVENTS. THE FINAL SURVEY TOOL INCLUDED 16 QUESTIONSTHREE QUESTIONS RELATED TO ZIP CODE/COMMUNITY OF RESIDENCE, NINE DEMOGRAPHIC QUESTIONS, TWO MULTI-SELECT QUESTIONS ABOUT HEALTH PROBLEMS AND WHAT'S NEEDED FOR A HEALTHY COMMUNITY, AND TWO OPEN-ENDED QUESTIONS ABOUT COMMUNITY STRENGTHS AND IMPROVEMENTS NEEDED. PAPER SURVEYS WERE ENTERED INTO THE SURVEYGIZMO ONLINE PLATFORM SO THAT ELECTRONIC AND PAPER SURVEYS COULD BE ANALYZED TOGETHER. SURVEY DATA ANALYSIS WAS CONDUCTED USING SAS 9.4 STATISTICAL ANALYSIS SOFTWARE AND MICROSOFT EXCEL 2016. FOCUS GROUP AND LEARNING MAP HOST ORGANIZATIONS. BETWEEN AUGUST 2018 AND FEBRUARY 2019, IPHI WORKED WITH THE ALLIANCE PARTNERS TO HOLD A TOTAL OF 52 COMMUNITY INPUT SESSIONS (FOCUS GROUPS AND LEARNING MAP SESSIONS) WITH PRIORITY POPULATIONS SUCH AS VETERANS, INDIVIDUALS LIVING WITH MENTAL ILLNESS, COMMUNITIES OF COLOR, OLDER ADULTS, CAREGIVERS, TEENS AND YOUNG ADULTS, LGBTQ+ COMMUNITY MEMBERS, ADULTS AND TEENS EXPERIENCING HOMELESSNESS, FAMILIES WITH CHILDREN, FAITH COMMUNITIES, ADULTS WITH DISABILITIES, AND CHILDREN AND ADULTS LIVING WITH CHRONIC CONDITIONS, SUCH AS DIABETES AND ASTHMA. THE COMMUNITY INPUT SESSIONS INCLUDED 31 FOCUS GROUPS CONDUCTED BY IPHI AND 21 LEARNING MAP SESSIONS LED BY WEST SIDE UNITED. IN ADDITION TO THE 52 COMMUNITY INPUT SESSIONS, THERE WERE ALSO FIVE FOCUS GROUPS WITH HEALTH CARE AND SOCIAL SERVICE PROVIDERS HOSTED BY SWEDISH COVENANT HOSPITAL, MACNEAL HOSPITAL, AND SOUTH SHORE HOSPITAL. EXHIBITS 23 AND 23.1 LIST ALL THE FOCUS GROUP AND LEARNING MAP SESSION HOST ORGANIZATIONS. FOCUS GROUP FACILITATORS ASKED PARTICIPANTS ABOUT THE UNDERLYING ROOT CAUSES OF HEALTH ISSUES SEEN IN THEIR COMMUNITIES AND SPECIFIC STRATEGIES FOR ADDRESSING THOSE HEALTH NEEDS. IPHI DEVELOPED THE FOCUS GROUP QUESTIONS USING RESOURCES FROM EXISTING CHNA TOOLKITS AND PEER-REVIEWED STUDIES, IN CONSULTATION WITH THE CHNA COMMITTEE AND COLLEAGUES AT PARTNER HEALTH DEPARTMENTS. EACH FOCUS GROUP WAS HOSTED BY A COMMUNITY-BASED ORGANIZATION OR HOSPITAL, AND PARTICIPATION RANGED FROM THREE TO FORTY PEOPLE. MOST FOCUS GROUPS WERE 90 MINUTES LONG WITH AN AVERAGE OF 10 PARTICIPANTS. FEEDBACK FROM ALL 52 COMMUNITY INPUT SESSIONS (FOCUS GROUPS AND LEARNING MAP SESSIONS) WAS COMBINED AND INCLUDED IN THE ASSESSMENT, ALONG WITH INPUT FROM FIVE PROVIDER FOCUS GROUPS.SECONDARY DATA COLLECTION. AS INDICATED ABOVE, ADVOCATE TRINITY COLLABORATED WITH MANY PARTNERS TO COLLECT PSA, COUNTY AND STATE DATA. SECONDARY DATA COLLECTION WAS CONDUCTED USING SEVERAL PLATFORMS, INCLUDING CONDUENT HEALTHY COMMUNITIES INSTITUTE (CONDUENT HCI). DETAIL ON THE HOSPITAL'S 2017-2019 CHNA SECONDARY DATA SOURCES ARE LISTED BELOW.CONDUENT HEALTHY COMMUNITIES INSTITUTE. IN EARLY 2017, ADVOCATE HEALTH CARE SIGNED A SECOND THREE-YEAR CONTRACT WITH CONDUENT HCI TO CONTINUE TO PROVIDE AN INTERNET-BASED DATA RESOURCE PLATFORM FOR ADVOCATE'S 11 HOSPITALS DURING THE 2017-2019 CHNA CYCLE. THIS ROBUST PLATFORM OFFERED THE HOSPITALS 198 HEALTH AND DEMOGRAPHIC INDICATORS, INCLUDING 38 HOSPITALIZATION AND ED VISIT INDICATORS AT THE SERVICE AREA AND ZIP CODE LEVELS. UTILIZING THE ILLINOIS HOSPITAL ASSOCIATION'S COMPDATA, CONDUENT HCI WAS ABLE TO SUMMARIZE, AGE ADJUST AND AVERAGE THE HOSPITALIZATION AND ED DATA FOR FIVE-TIME PERIODS FROM 2009-2017. THE CONDUENT HCI CONTRACT ALSO PROVIDED A WEALTH OF COUNTY AND ZIP CODE DATA COMPARISONS, A SOCIONEEDS INDEX VISUALIZING VULNERABLE POPULATIONS WITHIN SERVICE AREAS AND COUNTIES, A HEALTHY PEOPLE 2020 TRACKER, AND A DATABASE OF PROMISING AND EVIDENCE-BASED INTERVENTIONS. THIS SECONDARY DATA WAS CRUCIAL IN ANALYZING THE HOSPITAL'S PSA HEALTH NEEDS AS THE DATABASE WAS THE ONLY SOURCE THAT PROVIDED SUCH AN EXTENSIVE AMOUNT OF DATA SPECIFIC TO THE 2017-2019 CHNA DEFINED COMMUNITY. ALL DATA COLLECTED THROUGH HCI WAS QUANTITATIVE AND INCLUDED DATA COMPARISONS BETWEEN PSA COMMUNITIES AND COUNTIES IN ILLINOIS.

THE HOSPITAL HAS A DESIGNATED PATIENT NAVIGATOR (POLISH) WHOSE MAIN RESPONSIBILITIES INCLUDE CREATING A COMPETENT CULTURE WITHIN THE HOSPITAL FOR POLISH PATIENTS, ROUNDING ON PATIENTS, CONDUCTING CULTURALLY-SPECIFIC NEEDS ASSESSMENTS, DEVELOPING PROGRAMS TO ADDRESS SIGNIFICANT HEALTH NEEDS AND TO PROVIDE HEALTH EDUCATION. THROUGH ROUNDING, THE POLISH NAVIGATOR SEES APPROXIMATELY 25 TO 50 INPATIENTS PER WEEK. THE NAVIGATOR ALSO WORKS DIRECTLY WITH THE BREAST CENTER, NAVIGATING APPROXIMATELY 5 POLISH WOMEN PER WEEK THROUGH THEIR BREAST HEALTH ENCOUNTERS, INCLUDING DIAGNOSIS AND TREATMENT. THE POLISH LECTURES, WHICH BEGAN IN 2014, HAVE HAD OVER 2,500 ATTENDEES. IN 2019, A TOTAL OF SIX LECTURES WERE OFFERED AND DELIVERED IN POLISH, PROVIDING EDUCATION ON TOPICS SUCH AS HEALTHY BONES AND HEALTHY LIFESTYLES TO MORE THAN 409 PARTICIPANTS FROM THE POLISH COMMUNITY. ALONG WITH INCREASING HEALTH LITERACY AND EDUCATION IN THE COMMUNITY, THE POLISH NAVIGATOR INCREASES ACCESS TO HEALTH CARE, WHICH ALIGNS WITH ADVOCATE AURORA HEALTH'S ACCESS TO PRIMARY CARE COMMUNITY STRATEGY. 2. ACCESS/BEHAVIORAL HEALTH SERVICESA SECOND ADVOCATE COMMUNITY STRATEGY FOCUS AREA IS ACCESS TO BEHAVIORAL HEALTH SERVICES. ADVOCATE HAS IMPLEMENTED MANY PROGRAMS/SERVICES FOCUSED ON IMPROVING THE CONTINUUM OF CARE FOR THE BENEFIT OF MENTAL HEALTH AND BEHAVIORAL HEALTH PATIENTS. SEVERAL EXAMPLES OF BEHAVIORAL HEALTH PROGRAMS THAT ADVOCATE HOSPITALS HAVE IMPLEMENTED AND IMPROVE ACCESS ARE PROVIDED BELOW. MENTAL HEALTH FIRST AID TRAININGS. ADVOCATE'S BEHAVIORAL HEALTH COUNCIL INTEGRATION STRATEGIES HAVE INCLUDED COMMUNITY HEALTH DEPARTMENTS OFFERING MENTAL HEALTH FIRST AID TRAINING TO TARGETED COMMUNITY MEMBERS FOR THE PURPOSE OF REDUCING STIGMA, AND TRAINING COMMUNITY MEMBERS TO RECOGNIZE MENTAL HEALTH ISSUES AND UNDERSTAND APPROPRIATE INTERVENTIONS. IN 2019 FOR EXAMPLE, OVER 299 COMMUNITY MEMBERS WERE TRAINED IN MCLEAN COUNTY ALONE VIA THE EIGHT-HOUR EVIDENCE-BASED PROGRAM. IN ADDITION TO THE 8-HOUR TRAINING, ADVOCATE PAID FOR A BEHAVIORAL HEALTH STAFF LEADER AND A LOCAL POLICE OFFICER TO BE TRAINED AS MENTAL HEALTH FIRST AID TRAINERS IN 40 HOUR PROGRAMS. THESE TWO TRAINERS WILL INCREASE THE NUMBER OF CLASSES THAT CAN BE OFFERED TO THE COMMUNITY. IN ADDITION TO THE EIGHT-HOUR TRAINING, ADVOCATE CONDELL SPONSORED TWO INDIVIDUALS, WHO ARE BOTH BILINGUAL IN ENGLISH AND SPANISH, TO COMPLETE THE 40-HOUR INSTRUCTOR TRAINING FOR MENTAL HEALTH FIRST AID. THE STRATEGY WAS TO INCREASE CAPACITY FOR SPANISH SPEAKING TRAINERS IN LAKE AND MCHENRY COUNTIES. IN 2019, TWO YOUTH MENTAL HEALTH FIRST AID TRAINING SESSIONS WERE HELD WITH SCHOOL DISTRICTS RESULTING IN THE TRAINING OF 54 SCHOOL DISTRICT STAFF MEMBERS.TWENTY-FIVE ADULTS FROM THE BLOOMINGTON/NORMAL AND CHICAGO AREAS WERE TRAINED AS MASTER TRAINERS FOR ADVERSE CHILDHOOD EXPERIENCES (ACE) CURRICULUM DURING A TWO-DAY TRAINING PROGRAM IN 2017. THESE TRAINERS ARE NOW ABLE TO OFFER TRAININGS THROUGHOUT ADVOCATE'S SERVICE AREAS. AS A RESULT OF THIS TRAINING, THE NUMBER OF INDIVIDUALS THAT RECEIVED TRAINING IN MCLEAN COUNTY HAS INCREASED FROM 580 TO 954 COMMUNITY MEMBERS. IN 2019, 583 COMMUNITY MEMBERS WERE TRAINED. OTHER EXAMPLES OF BEHAVIORAL HEALTH-RELATED PROGRAMMING INCLUDE PROGRAMS AT LOCAL SCHOOLS WHERE OVER 3,205 STUDENTS IN MCLEAN COUNTY RECEIVED EVIDENCE-BASED ""ENDING THE SILENCE"" TRAINING AND 2,408 STUDENTS RECEIVED EVIDENCE BASED ""TOO GOOD FOR DRUGS"" TRAINING. ADDITIONALLY, ALL ADVOCATE HOSPITALS ARE PARTICIPATING IN LOCAL COMMUNITY BEHAVIORAL HEALTH AND SUBSTANCE ABUSE COLLABORATIVES."
202003239349301515,362169147,"SCHEDULE H, PART VI, LINE 6 - AFFILIATED HEALTH SYSTEM (ALL HOSPITALS)","FIRST ACCESS PROGRAM. GIVEN THE HIGH NUMBER OF ADMISSIONS AND ED VISITS FOR BEHAVIORAL HEALTH CONDITIONS AT ADVOCATE ILLINOIS MASONIC AND THE HIGH NUMBER OF DISCHARGED PATIENTS THAT WERE NOT KEEPING THEIR OUTPATIENT FOLLOW-UP APPOINTMENTS, THE MEDICAL CENTER'S BEHAVIORAL HEALTH SERVICES DEPARTMENT CREATED THE FIRST ACCESS PROGRAM IN 2013. THE PROGRAM'S GOAL IS TO PROVIDE IMMEDIATE ACCESS TO FOLLOW-UP BEHAVIORAL HEALTH SERVICES TO SUPPORT RECOVERY AND PREVENT RELAPSES. THROUGH FIRST ACCESS, BEHAVIORAL HEALTH ED PATIENTS AS WELL AS PATIENTS REFERRED BY THE MEDICAL CENTER'S INPATIENT PSYCHIATRIC UNIT, MEDICAL FLOORS AND PHYSICIANS ARE WALKED OVER TO OUTPATIENT CARE BY A STAFF MEMBER TO ENSURE SAME DAY FOLLOW-UP FOR OUTPATIENT APPOINTMENTS. SINCE ITS IMPLEMENTATION, FIRST ACCESS HAS CONSISTENTLY INCREASED BEHAVIORAL HEALTH PATIENTS' APPOINTMENT FOLLOW-THROUGH RATES FROM 40 PERCENT IN 2013 TO 100% IN 2019; ALL DISCHARGED PATIENTS RECEIVED WARM HAND-OFFS TO BEHAVIORAL HEALTH SERVICES AND LEFT WITH AN OUTPATIENT PLAN OF CARE. HAVING ACHIEVED THAT, FIRST ACCESS STARTED TO FOCUS ON PROVIDING ACCESS TO CARE TO ALL ADVOCATE AURORA PATIENTS AND ITS VOLUMES GREW STEADILY IN 2019, FROM 738 INTAKES IN 2018 TO 910 IN 2019, A 23% GROWTH IN IMMEDIATE ACCESS TO CARE.MEDICALLY INTEGRATED CRISIS COMMUNITY SUPPORT (MICCS).

THIS IS PARTICULARLY IMPORTANT GIVEN THE STATE'S CLOSURE OF NUMEROUS MENTAL HEALTH HOSPITALS IN ILLINOIS. THE TEAM GOES INTO THE COMMUNITY TO HELP HOMELESS AND INDIGENT PATIENTS WITH SITUATIONS IMPACTING THEIR BEHAVIORAL HEALTH, SUCH AS HOUSING AND MEDICATION STABILIZATION, THUS HELPING CLIENTS IMPROVE THEIR OVERALL HEALTH. IN 2019, 166 INDIVIDUALS WERE SERVED THROUGH THE MICCS PROGRAM. DEAF AND HARD OF HEARING PROGRAM. ADVOCATE ILLINOIS MASONIC'S DEAF AND HARD OF HEARING PROGRAM PROVIDES COMPREHENSIVE MENTAL HEALTH CARE IN AMERICAN SIGN LANGUAGE (ASL) TO DEAF, HARD OF HEARING AND DEAF-BLIND CHILDREN, ADOLESCENTS AND ADULTS IN THE SIX-COUNTY CHICAGO REGION. THE PROGRAM OFFERS A CONTINUUM OF CARE THAT INCLUDES CLINICAL ASSESSMENTS; PRE-SCREENINGS AND LINKAGE; INDIVIDUAL, FAMILY AND GROUP THERAPY; PSYCHIATRIC EVALUATIONS AND MEDICATION MONITORING; AND INTERVENTION WITH A 24-HOUR PHONE LINE CONNECTED TO A TEXT TELEPHONE (TTY) SYSTEM. A TELE-PSYCHIATRY NETWORK ENABLES THE PROVISION OF OTHERWISE SCARCE DEAF-FRIENDLY PSYCHIATRIC SERVICES IN THE HOMES OF DEAF PATIENTS WHO HAVE RECEIVED THE FREE VIDEOPHONE EQUIPMENT AND SERVICES SUPPORTED BY THE FEDERAL COMMUNICATIONS COMMISSION (FCC). A HEALTH EDUCATION WEBSITE ALLOWS USERS TO WATCH VIDEOS, LINK TO OTHER ASL VIDEOS AND/OR TO ORDER FREE ASL HEALTH EDUCATION DVDS. OVER THE YEARS, THE HOSPITAL HAS DISTRIBUTED SEVERAL THOUSAND FREE ASL DVDS ON HIV/AIDS, STDS, BREAST HEALTH, DIABETES, DEPRESSION AND SMOKING CESSATION. IN 2019, 74 UNIQUE PATIENTS WERE SERVED THROUGH THE DEAF AND HARD OF HEARING PROGRAM. 3.

THE CENTER FOR FAITH AND COMMUNITY HEALTH TRANSFORMATION WORKS TO ADVANCE HEALTH EQUITY BY PARTNERING WITH FAITH-BASED AND COMMUNITY ORGANIZATIONS TO BUILD COMMUNITY, NURTURE LEADERS AND CONNECT THE UNIQUE SPIRIT POWER OF FAITH COMMUNITIES TO PROMOTE SOCIAL JUSTICE AND ABUNDANT LIFE FOR INDIVIDUALS, FAMILIES AND COMMUNITIES. THE CENTER IS A PARTNERSHIP BETWEEN ADVOCATE AND THE OFFICE FOR COMMUNITY ENGAGEMENT AND NEIGHBORHOOD HEALTH PARTNERSHIPS AT THE UNIVERSITY OF ILLINOIS AT CHICAGO. CURRENTLY, THE CENTER IS CONVENING A TRAUMA INFORMED CONGREGATIONS NETWORK TO SUPPORT THE CAPACITY OF FAITH COMMUNITIES TO PREVENT TRAUMA AND TO BE PLACES OF HEALING FOR THOSE WHO HAVE EXPERIENCED ADVERSITY IN CHILDHOOD OR THROUGHOUT THEIR LIVES. SEXUAL ASSAULT NURSE EXAMINERS (SANE).

ADVOCATE CONDELL CARED FOR 95 PATIENTS IN 2019, 24 OF WHICH WERE PEDIATRIC SEXUAL ASSAULT PATIENTS (<13 YEARS). ADVOCATE CONDELL ALSO PROVIDED TRAINING REGARDING SEXUAL ASSAULT TREATMENT AND RESPONSE TO COMMUNITY PARTNERS INCLUDING, BUT NOT LIMITED TO, RAPE ADVOCACY CENTERS, LAW ENFORCEMENT AND MEDICAL STUDENTS. ADVOCATE'S SOUTH REGION SANE PROGRAM (ADVOCATE CHRIST, SOUTH SUBURBAN AND ADVOCATE TRINITY HOSPITALS) SERVED 210 PATIENTS IN THE ED WHO WERE SEXUALLY ASSAULTED OR ABUSED IN 2019. IN ADDITION, ADVOCATE CHILDREN'S CHILD PROTECTION TEAM AND SANE PROGRAM PARTNERS, WITH AREA CHILDREN ADVOCACY CENTERS, DCFS AND LAW ENFORCEMENT, PROVIDE CARE TO CHILDREN WHO ARE SEXUALLY ASSAULTED/ABUSED. IN GENERAL, VERY FEW PROGRAMS IN ILLINOIS ARE ABLE TO MEET THE NEEDS OF THIS PATIENT POPULATION. SEXUALLY ASSAULTED CHILDREN WHO REQUIRE EVIDENCE COLLECTION ARE REFERRED TO THE PEDIATRIC EMERGENCY DEPARTMENT AT ONE OF THE ADVOCATE CHILDREN'S CAMPUSES, EITHER IN OAK LAWN OR PARK RIDGE. IN 2019, 158 SEXUALLY ASSAULTED CHILDREN WERE CARED FOR IN THE PEDIATRIC ED. SEXUALLY ASSAULTED CHILDREN NOT REQUIRING EVIDENCE COLLECTION ARE REFERRED TO ONE OF THE ADVOCATE CHILDREN'S CERTIFIED PEDIATRIC SANE CHILD PROTECTION NURSE PRACTITIONERS AND ARE SEEN IN THE OUTPATIENT SEXUAL ABUSE CLINICS. IN 2019, 155 CHILDREN (INCLUDING THOSE MENTIONED EARLIER SERVED BY ADVOCATE CONDELL) WERE SEEN IN ADVOCATE'S OUTPATIENT CHILD PROTECTION SEXUAL ABUSE CLINICS. SANE COORDINATORS FOR BOTH PROGRAMS COLLABORATE TO PROVIDE BEST PRACTICE STANDARDIZED SEXUAL ASSAULT CARE THROUGHOUT ADVOCATE. ACCLIVUS PARTNERSHIP. GIVEN NEARLY 1/3 OF THE VIOLENTLY INJURED (GUNSHOTS, STABBINGS AND/OR BATTERY) PATIENTS TRANSPORTED TO ADVOCATE CHRIST, A LEVEL I TRAUMA CENTER SERVING THE SOUTH AND SOUTHWEST PORTIONS OF CHICAGO AND THE SUBURBS, EACH YEAR ARE VICTIMS OF INTENTIONAL VIOLENCE, THE MEDICAL CENTER HAS PARTNERED WITH ACCLIVUS TO PROVIDE OUTREACH INTERVENTION SERVICES AND COMMUNITY RESOURCES FOR VICTIMS OF VIOLENCE. ACCLIVUS IS A COMMUNITY OUTREACH ORGANIZATION SEEKING TO REDUCE THE INCIDENCE OF DEADLY STREET VIOLENCE IN CHICAGO NEIGHBORHOODS. VIOLENCE, LIKE OTHER EPIDEMICS, IS PREDICTABLE AND OFTEN ENGAGED IN AS AN ACT OF RETALIATION, SO IMMEDIATE INTERVENTION IS NECESSARY. WHEN VIOLENTLY INJURED PATIENTS FROM THE CHICAGO AREA ARE TRANSPORTED TO ADVOCATE CHRIST'S TRAUMA CENTER, CHAPLAINS NOTIFY ACCLIVUS. ACCLIVUS HAS TWO HOSPITAL RESPONDERS AND ONE CASE MANAGER ASSIGNED TO ADVOCATE CHRIST. THEY PROVIDE COUNSELING TO THESE PATIENTS AND THEIR LOVED ONES AIMING TO REDUCE ONGOING CONFLICT IN THE COMMUNITY AND RISK OF RETALIATION. ACCLIVUS' CASE MANAGER SEES THE PATIENTS IN THE TRAUMA CLINIC AFTER DISCHARGE ENSURING COMPREHENSIVE FOLLOW-UP CARE. THE HOSPITAL RESPONDERS SERVED 697 PATIENTS AND MADE 1,543 REFERRALS TO EXISTING COMMUNITY RESOURCES IN 2019. A SECOND HOSPITAL, ADVOCATE ILLINOIS MASONIC, HAS ALSO PARTNERED WITH ACCLIVUS TO ADDRESS VIOLENCE IN CHICAGO'S NORTH SIDE COMMUNITIES."
202003239349301515,362169147,"SCHEDULE H, PART VI, LINE 6 - AFFILIATED HEALTH SYSTEM (ALL HOSPITALS)","4. WORKFORCE DEVELOPMENT. ADVOCATE WORKS WITH NON-TRADITIONAL COMMUNITY PARTNERS, SUCH AS SCHOOL DISTRICTS, EMPLOYMENT AGENCIES, COLLEGES AND UNIVERSITIES, AND OTHER PUBLIC AND PRIVATE BUSINESS LEADERS TO ADDRESS BOTH THE HIGH UNEMPLOYMENT RATES AND ECONOMIC DISPARITIES IN SOME CHICAGO NEIGHBORHOODS AS WELL AS TO CONTRIBUTE TO SOLVING THE CITY'S HEALTHCARE SECTOR TALENT SHORTAGE.

LED BY ADVOCATE, THIS HEALTH CARE SECTOR SKILLS-BASED TRAINING INITIATIVE CONNECTS CHICAGOLAND'S UNDEREMPLOYED AND UNEMPLOYED RESIDENTS WITH HIGH-QUALITY, IN-DEMAND JOBS IN THE RAPIDLY GROWING HEALTH CARE INDUSTRY. UNEMPLOYMENT RATES ARE AS HIGH AS 31.9% IN SOME NEIGHBORHOODS IN THE METROPOLITAN AREA AS COMPARED TO CHICAGO'S OVERALL UNEMPLOYMENT RATE OF 8.2%. ILLINOIS HAS THE NATION'S HIGHEST UNEMPLOYMENT RATE AMONG AFRICAN-AMERICANS. THE UNEMPLOYMENT RATE OF AFRICAN-AMERICANS AND HISPANICS IN CHICAGO IS THREE TIMES THAT OF THEIR WHITE COUNTERPARTS. THE HEALTH CARE SECTOR IS EXPECTED TO GENERATE 14,000 NEW WELL-PAYING MIDDLE-SKILL JOBS ANNUALLY IN THE CHICAGO REGION THROUGH 2019, BUT LACKS THE SKILLED TALENT NEEDED TO FILL THESE ROLES. ADVOCATE ALSO HELPED LAUNCH THE CHICAGOLAND HEALTHCARE WORKFORCE COLLABORATIVE (CHWC).

202003239349301515,362169147,"SCHEDULE H, PART VI, LINE 6 - AFFILIATED HEALTH SYSTEM (ALL HOSPITALS)","CLINICAL PASTORAL EDUCATION (CPE). AS INDICATED EARLIER, ADVOCATE'S SPIRITUAL LEADERS OVERSEE A NATIONALLY ACCREDITED CPE PROGRAM. SUPERVISING OVER 200 STUDENT UNITS EACH YEAR, THE PROGRAM IS THE LARGEST IN THE COUNTRY IN AN INTEGRATED HEALTH CARE SYSTEM, PROVIDING OPPORTUNITIES FOR SEMINARY STUDENTS, CHAPLAINS AND LOCAL FAITH LEADERS TO GROW AND DEVELOP SELF-AWARENESS AND SPIRITUAL CARE MINISTRY SKILLS.

THESE STUDENTS RECEIVE CREDIT TOWARDS GRADUATION IN ADDITION TO HELPING THEM DISCERN IN WHICH HEALTH CARE AREA THEY WISH TO SPECIALIZE. AS AN EXAMPLE, IN ORDER TO GIVE CHICAGO SOUTHSIDE STUDENTS BETTER JOB OPPORTUNITIES, ADVOCATE TRINITY WORKS WITH STUDENTS FROM CHICAGO VOCATIONAL CAREER ACADEMY, AND SOUTH SHORE AND JULIAN HIGH SCHOOLS. THESE STUDENTS ARE ROTATED IN HOSPITAL UNITS TO LEARN MARKETABLE JOB SKILLS. 5. AFFORDABLE HOUSING: ACCORDING TO HEALTHY PEOPLE 2020, DATA INDICATES THAT POOR-QUALITY HOUSING IS ASSOCIATED WITH VARIOUS NEGATIVE HEALTH OUTCOMES, INCLUDING CHRONIC DISEASE AND INJURY, AND POOR MENTAL HEALTH. IT IS FOR THIS REASON THAT ADVOCATE HAS VOWED AS A FIFTH COMMUNITY STRATEGY FOCUS AREA TO DECREASE THE NUMBER OF ED PATIENTS WHO ARE SCREENED POSITIVE FOR HOMELESSNESS BY 5% BY 2025. WHILE WORK TOWARDS THIS GOAL IS STILL EMERGING, SEVERAL ADVOCATE HOSPITALS ARE TAKING STEPS TO PROVIDE PATIENTS WITH A HEALTHY AND SAFE ENVIRONMENT IN WHICH TO HEAL. FLEXIBLE HOUSING POOL. IN 2019, THE FLEXIBLE HOUSING POOL AT ADVOCATE ILLINOIS MASONIC PLACED TWO BEHAVIORAL HEALTH PATIENTS IN PERMANENT HOUSING. THE MEDICAL CENTER ALSO PROVIDES INDIVIDUALS PLACED IN PERMANENT HOUSING WITH BEHAVIORAL HEALTH AND CASE MANAGEMENT SERVICES. ANOTHER EXAMPLE IS ADVOCATE LUTHERAN GENERAL CARE MANAGEMENT DEPARTMENT'S PLANNING OF SAFE DISCHARGES FOR PATIENTS RECOVERING FROM HOSPITALIZATION, WHO HAVE NO HOUSING RESOURCES. THE DEPARTMENT MANAGES THE ADVOCATE LUTHERAN CAROL STREET APARTMENTS. LOCATED ON THE HOSPITAL'S CAMPUS, THESE APARTMENTS ARE AVAILABLE FOR RENT ON A DAILY/WEEKLY/MONTHLY BASIS. THE APARTMENTS ARE USED BY PATIENTS THAT ARE ACTIVELY GETTING SERVICES ON CAMPUS, I.E. CHEMOTHERAPY, RADIATION, ETC., AND ARE ALSO AVAILABLE FOR FAMILY MEMBERS OF INPATIENTS THAT DO NOT LIVE NEAR THE HOSPITAL. FINANCIAL ASSISTANCE IS GRANTED TO PATIENTS AND FAMILIES THAT DEMONSTRATE FINANCIAL HARDSHIP. IN 2019, EXPENSES FOR ELECTRICITY, CLEANING AND RENT TOTALED $32,553.

FOOD SECURITY. ANOTHER KEY ADVOCATE COMMUNITY STRATEGY FOCUS AREA IS FOOD SECURITY. ACCESS TO FRESH, AFFORDABLE FOOD IS A KEY INGREDIENT IN THE RECIPE TO ADDRESS FOOD INSECURITYAND IN KEEPING THE COMMUNITY HEALTHY. ADVOCATE IS INVOLVED WITH MULTIPLE NON-TRADITIONAL COMMUNITY PARTNERS IN LOCAL AND SUSTAINABLE FOOD INITIATIVES TO ADDRESS FOOD INSECURITY. ONE SUCH EXAMPLE IS ADVOCATE GOOD SAMARITAN'S PARTNERSHIP WITH LOCAL FOOD PANTRIES AND THE UNIVERSITY OF ILLINOIS EXTENSION TO DEVELOP A PROGRAM THAT OFFERS HEALTHY FRESH FOOD, NUTRITION AND COOKING CLASSES TO CLIENTS OF THE FOOD PANTRIES. ANOTHER EXAMPLE IS ADVOCATE GOOD SHEPHERD'S WORK WITH VARIOUS COMMUNITY-BASED ORGANIZATIONS AND LOCAL MUNICIPAL ENTITIES THAT SERVE SENIORS TO IMPLEMENT FOOD SECURITY SCREENING FOR SENIORS. A SCREENING TOOL AND COMPREHENSIVE RESOURCE GUIDE HAVE BEEN DEVELOPED FOR SENIORS THAT SCREEN AS FOOD INSECURE.

ADVOCATE GOOD SHEPHERD HAS PARTNERED WITH A LOCAL NON-PROFIT ORGANIZATION, SMARTFARM, WHOSE MISSION IS TO BE AN EDUCATIONAL RESOURCE ON SUSTAINABLE GARDENING AND HEALTHY EATING. SMART FARM MANAGES THE ON-SITE GARDEN ON OVER 10 ACRES OF LAND OWNED BY ADVOCATE AND THE HARVESTED FRESH VEGETABLES ARE DONATED TO LOCAL FOOD PANTRIES. SIMILAR PARTNERSHIPS EXIST AT ADVOCATE SHERMAN AND ADVOCATE BROMENN. IN 2018, ADVOCATE ILLINOIS MASONIC ESTABLISHED A HOSPITAL-BASED FOOD PANTRY TO ADDRESS THE NEEDS OF FOOD INSECURE ONCOLOGY PATIENTS AND IN JANUARY 2019, THE PANTRY WAS EXPANDED TO INCLUDE FOOD INSECURE PATIENTS FROM FOUR NEW SERVICE LINES AND PROGRAMS. IN PARTNERSHIP WITH THE LAKEVIEW FOOD PANTRY, THE MEDICAL CENTER PROVIDES DRY GOOD FOOD BAGS, RE-USABLE WHEELIE GROCERY BAGS AND GIFT CARDS TO LOW-INCOME AND FOOD INSECURE PATIENTS.

IN ADDITION TO THE MANY PROGRAM EXAMPLES PROVIDED PREVIOUSLY, TWO OTHER SYSTEM-LEVEL FUNDED EXAMPLES ARE PROVIDED BELOW. PARISH NURSE MINISTRY. ADVOCATE FULLY FUNDS THREE FAITH COMMUNITY NURSE POSITIONS SERVING THREE CONGREGATIONS IN LOW-INCOME, HIGH NEED COMMUNITIES. THESE FAITH COMMUNITY NURSES PROVIDE HEALTH EDUCATION, WELLNESS PROMOTION, NAVIGATION AND CARE MANAGEMENT, HEALTH SCREENINGS, ADVOCACY AND SPIRITUAL SUPPORT TO THE MEMBERS OF THEIR CONGREGATIONS AND TO THE WIDER COMMUNITIES IN WHICH THEY SERVE. MANY OF THE PEOPLE THESE NURSES SERVE ARE HOMELESS, MARGINALIZED OR CHRONICALLY ILL INDIVIDUALS.

202003239349301515,362169147,"SCHEDULE H, PART VI, LINE 6 - AFFILIATED HEALTH SYSTEM (ALL HOSPITALS)","SOCIONEEDS INDEX. IN PREPARATION FOR THE 2014-2016 CHNA, ADVOCATE PURCHASED ACCESS TO A TOOL THAT COULD BE USED BY ALL OF ITS HOSPITALS TO IDENTIFY PRIORITY OPPORTUNITIES TO IMPACT THE SOCIAL DETERMINANTS OF HEALTH IN THE COMMUNITIES SERVED BY ADVOCATE. INCLUDED IN THIS TOOL, DEVELOPED BY CONDUENT HEALTHY COMMUNITIES INSTITUTE, IS THE SOCIONEEDS INDEX. THE SOCIONEEDS INDEX IS A MEASURE OF SOCIOECONOMIC NEED THAT IS CORRELATED WITH POOR HEALTH OUTCOMES. INDICATORS FOR THE INDEX ARE WEIGHTED TO MAXIMIZE THE CORRELATION OF THE INDEX WITH PREMATURE DEATH RATES AND PREVENTABLE HOSPITALIZATION RATES. THIS INDEX COMBINES MULTIPLE SOCIOECONOMIC INDICATORS INTO A SINGLE COMPOSITE VALUE. AS A SINGLE INDICATOR, THE INDEX CAN SERVE AS A CONCISE WAY TO EXPLAIN WHICH AREAS ARE OF HIGHEST NEED. A MAP WAS THEN PREPARED FOR EACH HOSPITAL SERVICE AREA ENABLING THE COMMUNITY HEALTH COUNCILS TO FOCUS PRIORITY SETTING AND PROGRAM PLANNING ON COMMUNITIES AT HIGHER LEVELS OF SOCIOECONOMIC NEED. THE INDEX WAS AGAIN USED FOR ADVOCATE'S 2017-2019 CHNA PROCESS.ADVOCATE CONTINUES TO WORK LOCALLY AND NATIONALLY WITH MANY PROMINENT COMMUNITY PARTNERS TO ADDRESS SOCIAL DETERMINANTS OF HEALTH. EXAMPLES OF THESE EFFORTS INCLUDE THE FOLLOWING. HEALTH CARE ANCHOR NETWORK (HAN). IN DECEMBER 2016, ADVOCATE JOINED LEADERS FROM HEALTH SYSTEMS IN WASHINGTON, DC, TO EXPLORE WHAT IT WOULD MEAN TO HARNESS THEIR SHARED ECONOMIC AND INTELLECTUAL POWER TO TRULY BENEFIT THEIR COMMUNITIES. ""THE DISCUSSION CENTERED ON IDENTIFYING HOW ALL OF THESE ECONOMIC ASSETS (THE COMBINED PURCHASES OF $65 BILLION IN PURCHASED GOODS AND SERVICES, 1.4 MILLION EMPLOYEES AND $200 BILLION IN INVESTMENT AND ENDOWMENT PORTFOLIOS), COMBINED WITH CIVIC LEADERSHIP COULD BE DEPLOYED TO CREATE INCLUSIVE, EQUITABLE, HEALTHY AND ENVIRONMENTALLY SUSTAINABLE COMMUNITIES"" (ADVANCING THE ANCHOR MISSION OF HEALTHCARE, DEMOCRACY COLLABORATIVE, 2017). IN 2019 HAN, WITH OVER 45 HEALTH SYSTEMS REPRESENTED IN THE NETWORK, BRINGS TOGETHER ANCHOR INSTITUTIONS FROM ACROSS THE COUNTRY THAT TOGETHER EMPLOY MORE THAN 1.5 MILLION PEOPLE, PURCHASE OVER $50 BILLION ANNUALLY, AND HAVE OVER $100 BILLION IN INVESTMENT ASSETS.ADVOCATE OFFICIALLY JOINED THE HEALTH CARE ANCHOR NETWORK IN 2016 AS A FOUNDING PARTNER AND SINCE THEN HAS CONTINUED TO PROVIDE MONETARY SUPPORT, LEADERSHIP AND ACTIVE ENGAGEMENT TO THE NETWORK.

SOME SERVICES SUCH AS PHYSICIAN FEES, ANESTHESIOLOGY FEES, RADIOLOGY INTERPRETATION, AND OUTPATIENT PRESCRIPTIONS ARE SEPARATE FROM HOSPITAL CHARGES AND MAY NOT BE ELIGIBLE FOR REDUCTION. IN ACCORDANCE WITH CHARITY CARE GUIDELINES, PAYMENT ASSISTANCE IS AVAILABLE TO NEW JERSEY RESIDENT PATIENTS WHOSE HOUSEHOLD GROSS INCOME IS AT OR BELOW 300% OF THE FEDERAL POVERTY GUIDELINES AND WHO: 1. HAVE NO HEALTH COVERAGE OR HAVE COVERAGE THAT PAYS ONLY PART OF THE BILL; 2. ARE INELIGIBLE FOR ANY PRIVATE OR GOVERNMENTAL SPONSORED COVERAGE (SUCH AS MEDICAID): AND 3. MEET THE INCOME AND ASSETS CRITERIA DESCRIBED BELOW. CHARITY CARE IS AVAILABLE TO THOSE THAT DO NOT QUALIFY FOR STATE OR FEDERAL PROGRAMS. INCOME CRITERIA - PATIENTS WITH FAMILY GROSS INCOME LESS THAN OR EQUAL TO 200% OF THE FEDERAL POVERTY GUIDELINES (""FPG"") ARE ELIGIBLE FOR 100% CHARITY CARE COVERAGE. PATIENTS WITH FAMILY GROSS INCOME GREATER THAN 200% BUT LESS THAN OR EQUAL TO 300% OF FPG ARE ELIGIBLE FOR DISCOUNTED CARE UNDER THE CHARITY CARE PROGRAM. FREE OR DISCOUNTED CHARGES ARE DETERMINED BY THE FOLLOWING FEE SCHEDULE: INCOME AS A PERCENTAGE OF HHS POVERTY INCOME GUIDELINES: LESS THAN OR EQUAL TO 200% -- 0% OF MEDICAID RATE GREATER THAN 200% BUT LESS THAN OR EQUAL TO 225% -- 20% OF MEDICAID RATE GREATER THAN 225% BUT LESS THAN OR EQUAL TO 250% -- 40% OF MEDICAID RATE GREATER THAN 250% BUT LESS THAN OR EQUAL TO 275% -- 60% OF MEDICAID RATE GREATER THAN 275% BUT LESS THAN OR EQUAL TO 300% -- 80% OF MEDICAID RATE GREATER THAN 300% -- UNINSURED DISCOUNT RATE AVAILABLE ASSETS CRITERIA INDIVIDUAL ASSETS CANNOT EXCEED $7,500 AND FAMILY ASSETS CANNOT EXCEED $15,000. SHOULD AN APPLICANT'S ASSETS EXCEED THESE LIMITS, HE/SHE MAY ""SPEND DOWN"" THE ASSETS TO THE ELIGIBLE LIMITS THROUGH PAYMENT OF THE EXCESS TOWARD THE HOSPITAL BILL AND OTHER APPROVED OUT-OF-POCKET MEDICAL EXPENSES. CHARITY CARE MAY BE AVAILABLE TO NON-NEW JERSEY RESIDENTS, SUBJECT TO SPECIFIC PROVISIONS (SUCH AS EMERGENCY MEDICAL CONDITIONS). NEW JERSEY UNINSURED DISCOUNT CARE RATE --------------------------------------- UNINSURED NEW JERSEY STATE RESIDENT PATIENTS WHO DO NOT QUALIFY FOR CHARITY CARE AND WHOSE INCOME FALLS LESS THAN OR EQUAL TO 500% OF THE FEDERAL POVERTY GUIDELINES WILL BE ELIGIBLE FOR A DISCOUNT BASED UPON MEDICARE RATES AS PER THE NJ STATE STATUTE P.L. 2008, CHAPTER 60, APPROVED ON AUGUST 8, 2008, ASSEMBLY, NO. 2609, AS ENACTED BY THE SENATE AND GENERAL ASSEMBLY OF THE STATE OF NEW JERSEY. COMPASSIONATE CARE DISCOUNT POLICY ---------------------------------- PATIENTS WHO DO NOT QUALIFY FOR ANY HEALTHCARE RELATED GOVERNMENTAL SPONSORED COVERAGE OR PROGRAMS UNDER HNMCS FAP AND DO NOT HAVE PRIMARY INSURANCE COVERAGE WILL BE ELIGIBLE FOR OUR COMPASSIONATE CARE DISCOUNT POLICY. THIS DISCOUNT IS APPLIED AT THE TIME OF BILLING. THE COMPASSIONATE CARE DISCOUNT IS ONLY FOR UNINSURED PATIENTS AND IS NOT DEPENDENT ON INCOME OR ASSET CRITERIA, AND NO APPLICATION IS REQUIRED. IT IS FOR ALL SELF-PAY PATIENTS THAT DO NOT QUALIFY OR DO NOT CHOOSE TO APPLY FOR ANY HOSPITAL PAYMENT ASSISTANCE PROGRAMS. DISCOUNTS APPLIED ARE FOR OUTPATIENT DIAGNOSTIC TESTING SUCH AS RADIOLOGY OR LABORATORY SERVICES, AND A FLAT FEE RATE IS APPLIED TO LEVELS OF CARE SUCH AS AN INPATIENT (I.E. MEDICAL, SURGICAL, OR ICU) OR SAME DAY SURGERY. THE COMPASSIONATE CARE DISCOUNT DOES NOT APPLY TO BALANCES AFTER INSURANCE PAYMENTS, COSMETIC SURGERY, AND OTHER SPECIAL PROGRAMS. THIS DISCOUNT WILL BE APPLIED AT THE TIME OF BILLING. AMOUNT GENERALLY BILLED (""AGB"") ------------------------------- PER INTERNAL REVENUE CODE 501(R)(5) CHARGES FOR EMERGENCY OR OTHER MEDICALLY NECESSARY CARE FOR FAP-ELIGIBLE INDIVIDUALS UNDER HNMCS FAP WILL BE LIMITED TO BUT NOT BILLED MORE THAN THE AMOUNTS GENERALLY BILLED TO INDIVIDUALS WHO HAVE INSURANCE COVERING SUCH CARE."

202002949349301345,221487322,"SCHEDULE H, PART II","ACTIVITIES CLASSIFIED AS COMMUNITY BUILDING INCLUDE USE OF HOLY NAME MEDICAL CENTER'S FACILITY AND/OR EMPLOYEES TO SUPPORT EFFORTS THAT: - PROMOTE THE POSITIVE GROWTH OF THE COMMUNITY; - ASSIST DIVERSE GROUPS IN COMING TOGETHER FOR THE COMMUNITY'S SHORT AND LONG TERM BENEFIT; AND - SEEK TO PROTECT THE COMMUNITY FROM ANYTHING THAT COULD SIGNIFICANTLY AFFECT THE HEALTH AND WELL-BEING OF THE COMMUNITY. HNMC ALSO ASSISTS OTHER NON-PROFITS AND PROVIDES VARIOUS FORMS OF NON-MONETARY AID. IN ADDITION, EMPLOYEES ARE PERMITTED TO ASSIST VALID NON-PROFIT ORGANIZATIONS DURING PAID WORK TIME. AMONG THE ORGANIZATIONS AIDED ARE: NURSING HOMES, BOY SCOUTS, HOUSES OF WORSHIP, COMMUNITY SERVICE GROUPS, ROTARY CLUBS, POLICE GROUPS, ENVIRONMENTAL GROUPS AND SCHOOLS. HNMC ALSO ALLOWS THE PUBLIC TO USE VARIOUS MEETING ROOMS (IN NON-CLINICAL AREAS) AND ITS CONFERENCE CENTER FOR EVENTS. CAREER DAYS ARE HELD FOR LOCAL HIGH SCHOOLS, FOSTERING ENTRANCE OF INTERESTED AND APPLICABLE STUDENTS INTO THE HEALTH PROFESSIONS. HNMC WAS ONE OF NINE HOSPITALS IN NEW JERSEY DESIGNATED BY THE NEW JERSEY DEPARTMENT OF HEALTH (""NJDOH"") AS A REGIONAL MEDICAL COORDINATION CENTER (""MCC""). THE ONLY FACILITY IN BERGEN COUNTY TO BE SO DESIGNATED, HNMC'S ON-CAMPUS MCC WAS ABLE TO BE ACTIVATED IN THE EVENT OF PUBLIC HEALTH EMERGENCIES AND/OR A TERRORIST ATTACK CAUSING MASS CASUALTY INCIDENTS, INFECTIOUS OR COMMUNICABLE DISEASE OR OTHER TYPES OF PUBLIC HEALTH DISRUPTION. THE MCC ALSO MONITORED, ON A DAILY BASIS, SITUATIONAL AWARENESS OF LOCAL ACTIVITY. IN 2014, THE NJDOH LOST MUCH OF ITS FEDERAL FUNDING FOR THE STATEWIDE PROGRAM, CUTTING IN HALF THE NUMBER OF MCC'S IT COULD SUPPORT. HNMC CHOSE NOT TO APPLY TO RENEW ITS DESIGNATION BUT HAS MAINTAINED MOST OF ITS CAPABILITIES ON ITS OWN. GIVEN HNMC'S PROXIMITY TO NEW YORK CITY (I.E., FIVE MILES NORTH OF THE GEORGE WASHINGTON BRIDGE) EMERGENCY PREPAREDNESS IS DEEMED NECESSARY TO ENSURE THE HEALTH AND WELL-BEING OF THE COMMUNITY, REGARDLESS OF THE MCC DESIGNATION."
202002949349301345,221487322,"SCHEDULE H, PART III, SECTION A, QUESTIONS 2, 3 & 4","BAD DEBT EXPENSE WAS CALCULATED USING THE PROVIDERS' BAD DEBT EXPENSE FROM ITS FINANCIAL STATEMENTS, NET OF ACCOUNTS WRITTEN OFF AT CHARGES. HNMC AND ITS AFFILIATES PREPARE AND ISSUE AUDITED CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS. THE BELOW WAS OBTAINED FROM THE FOOTNOTES TO THE AUDITED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS OF HNMC AND SUBSIDIARIES. PATIENT ACCOUNTS RECEIVABLE AND NET PATIENT SERVICE REVENUE ----------------------------------------------------------- NET PATIENT SERVICE REVENUE IS REPORTED AT THE AMOUNT THAT REFLECTS THE CONSIDERATION FOR WHICH THE MEDICAL CENTER EXPECTS TO BE ENTITLED IN EXCHANGE FOR PROVIDING PATIENT CARE. THE MEDICAL CENTER USES A PORTFOLIO APPROACH AS A PRACTICAL EXPEDIENT TO ACCOUNT FOR CATEGORIES OF PATIENT CONTRACTS AS COLLECTIVE GROUPS RATHER THAN RECOGNIZING REVENUE ON AN INDIVIDUAL CONTRACT BASIS. THE PORTFOLIO CONSISTS OF MAJOR PAYOR CLASSES FOR INPATIENT AND OUTPATIENT REVENUE. BASED ON HISTORICAL COLLECTION TRENDS AND OTHER ANALYSES, THE MEDICAL CENTER BELIEVES THAT REVENUE RECOGNIZED BY UTILIZING THE PORTFOLIO APPROACH APPROXIMATES THE REVENUE THAT WOULD HAVE BEEN RECOGNIZED IF AN INDIVIDUAL CONTRACT APPROACH WERE USED. THE MEDICAL CENTER'S INITIAL ESTIMATE OF THE TRANSACTION PRICE FOR THE SERVICES PROVIDED TO PATIENTS SUBJECT TO REVENUE RECOGNITION IS DETERMINED BY REDUCING THE TOTAL STANDARD CHARGES RELATED TO THE PATIENT SERVICES PROVIDED BY VARIOUS ELEMENTS OF VARIABLE CONSIDERATION, INCLUDING CONTRACTUAL ADJUSTMENTS, DISCOUNTS, IMPLICIT PRICE CONCESSIONS, AND OTHER REDUCTIONS TO THE MEDICAL CENTER'S STANDARD CHARGES. THE MEDICAL CENTER DETERMINES THE TRANSACTION PRICE ASSOCIATED WITH SERVICES PROVIDED TO PATIENTS WHO HAVE THIRD-PARTY PAYOR COVERAGE ON THE BASIS OF CONTRACTUAL OR FORMULA DRIVEN RATES FOR THE SERVICES RENDERED (SEE DESCRIPTION OF THIRD-PARTY PAYMENT PROGRAMS BELOW). THE ESTIMATES FOR CONTRACTUAL ALLOWANCES AND DISCOUNTS ARE BASED ON CONTRACTUAL AGREEMENTS, THE MEDICAL CENTER'S DISCOUNT POLICIES AND HISTORICAL EXPERIENCE. FOR UNINSURED AND UNDER-INSURED PATIENTS WHO DO NOT QUALIFY FOR CHARITY CARE, THE MEDICAL CENTER DETERMINES THE TRANSACTION PRICE ASSOCIATED WITH SERVICES RENDERED ON THE BASIS OF CHARGES REDUCED BY IMPLICIT PRICE CONCESSIONS. IMPLICIT PRICE CONCESSIONS INCLUDED IN THE ESTIMATE OF THE TRANSACTION PRICE ARE BASED ON THE MEDICAL CENTER'S HISTORICAL COLLECTION EXPERIENCE FOR APPLICABLE PATIENT PORTFOLIOS. GENERALLY, THE MEDICAL CENTER BILLS PATIENTS AND THIRD-PARTY PAYORS AFTER THE SERVICES ARE PERFORMED AND THE PATIENT IS DISCHARGED. NET PATIENT SERVICE REVENUE IS RECOGNIZED AS PERFORMANCE OBLIGATIONS ARE SATISFIED. PERFORMANCE OBLIGATIONS ARE DETERMINED BASED ON THE NATURE OF THE SERVICES PROVIDED BY THE MEDICAL CENTER. NET PATIENT SERVICE REVENUE FOR PERFORMANCE OBLIGATIONS SATISFIED OVER TIME IS RECOGNIZED BASED ON ACTUAL CHARGES INCURRED IN RELATION TO TOTAL CHARGES. THE MEDICAL CENTER BELIEVES THAT THIS METHOD PROVIDES A REASONABLE DEPICTION OF THE TRANSFER OF SERVICES OVER THE TERM OF THE PERFORMANCE OBLIGATION BASED ON THE SERVICES NEEDED TO SATISFY THE OBLIGATION. GENERALLY, PERFORMANCE OBLIGATIONS SATISFIED OVER TIME RELATE TO PATIENTS RECEIVING INPATIENT ACUTE CARE SERVICES OR PATIENTS RECEIVING SERVICES IN THE MEDICAL CENTER'S OUTPATIENT SETTINGS. THE MEDICAL CENTER MEASURES THE PERFORMANCE OBLIGATION FROM ADMISSION INTO THE MEDICAL CENTER OR THE COMMENCEMENT OF AN OUTPATIENT SERVICE TO THE POINT WHEN IT IS NO LONGER REQUIRED TO PROVIDE SERVICES TO THAT PATIENT, WHICH IS GENERALLY AT THE TIME OF DISCHARGE OR THE COMPLETION OF THE OUTPATIENT VISIT. AS SUBSTANTIALLY ALL OF ITS PERFORMANCE OBLIGATIONS RELATE TO CONTRACTS WITH A DURATION OF LESS THAN ONE YEAR, THE MEDICAL CENTER HAS ELECTED TO NOT DISCLOSE THE AGGREGATE AMOUNT OF THE TRANSACTION PRICE ALLOCATED TO PERFORMANCE OBLIGATIONS THAT ARE UNSATISFIED OR PARTIALLY UNSATISFIED AT THE END OF THE REPORTING PERIOD. THE UNSATISFIED OR PARTIALLY UNSATISFIED PERFORMANCE OBLIGATIONS REFERRED TO ABOVE ARE PRIMARILY RELATED TO INPATIENT ACUTE CARE SERVICES AT THE END OF THE REPORTING PERIOD FOR PATIENTS WHO REMAIN ADMITTED AT THAT TIME (IN-HOUSE PATIENTS). THE PERFORMANCE OBLIGATIONS FOR IN-HOUSE PATIENTS ARE GENERALLY COMPLETED WHEN THE PATIENTS ARE DISCHARGED, WHICH FOR THE MAJORITY OF THE MEDICAL CENTER'S IN-HOUSE PATIENTS OCCURS WITHIN DAYS OR WEEKS AFTER THE END OF THE REPORTING PERIOD. SUBSEQUENT CHANGES TO THE ESTIMATE OF THE TRANSACTION PRICE (DETERMINED ON A PORTFOLIO BASIS WHEN APPLICABLE) ARE GENERALLY RECORDED AS ADJUSTMENTS TO PATIENT SERVICE REVENUE IN THE PERIOD OF THE CHANGE. FOR THE YEAR ENDED DECEMBER 31, 2019, CHANGES IN THE MEDICAL CENTER'S ESTIMATES OF IMPLICIT PRICE CONCESSIONS, DISCOUNTS, CONTRACTUAL ADJUSTMENTS OR OTHER REDUCTIONS TO EXPECTED PAYMENTS FOR PERFORMANCE OBLIGATIONS SATISFIED IN PRIOR YEARS WERE NOT SIGNIFICANT. PORTFOLIO COLLECTION ESTIMATES ARE UPDATED BASED ON COLLECTION TRENDS. SUBSEQUENT CHANGES THAT ARE DETERMINED TO BE THE RESULT OF AN ADVERSE CHANGE IN THE PATIENT'S ABILITY TO PAY (DETERMINED ON A PORTFOLIO BASIS WHEN APPLICABLE) ARE RECORDED AS BAD DEBT EXPENSE. BAD DEBT EXPENSE AND THE ALLOWANCE FOR DOUBTFUL ACCOUNTS AS OF AN FOR THE YEARS ENDED DECEMBER 31, 2019 AND 2018 WERE NOT SIGNIFICANT. THE MEDICAL CENTER HAS DETERMINED THAT THE NATURE, AMOUNT, TIMING AND UNCERTAINTY OF REVENUE AND CASH FLOWS ARE AFFECTED BY THE FOLLOWING FACTORS: PAYORS, LINES OF BUSINESS AND TIMING OF WHEN REVENUE IS RECOGNIZED."
202002949349301345,221487322,"SCHEDULE H, PART III, SECTION B, QUESTION 8","MEDICARE COSTS WERE DERIVED FROM THE 2019 MEDICARE COST REPORT. THE ORGANIZATION FEELS THAT MEDICARE UNDERPAYMENTS (SHORTFALL), BAD DEBT AND ASSOCIATED COSTS ARE COMMUNITY BENEFIT AND ARE INCLUDABLE ON THE FORM 990, SCHEDULE H, PART I. AS OUTLINED MORE FULLY BELOW, THE ORGANIZATION BELIEVES THAT THESE SERVICES AND RELATED COSTS PROMOTE THE HEALTH OF THE COMMUNITY AS A WHOLE AND ARE RENDERED IN CONJUNCTION WITH THE ORGANIZATION'S CHARITABLE TAX-EXEMPT PURPOSES AND MISSION IN PROVIDING MEDICALLY NECESSARY HEALTHCARE SERVICES TO ALL INDIVIDUALS IN A NON-DISCRIMINATORY MANNER WITHOUT REGARD TO RACE, COLOR, CREED, SEX, NATIONAL ORIGIN OR ABILITY TO PAY AND CONSISTENT WITH THE COMMUNITY BENEFIT STANDARD PROMULGATED BY THE IRS. THE COMMUNITY BENEFIT STANDARD IS THE CURRENT STANDARD FOR A HOSPITAL FOR RECOGNITION AS A TAX-EXEMPT AND CHARITABLE ORGANIZATION UNDER INTERNAL REVENUE CODE (""IRC"") 501(C)(3). THE ORGANIZATION IS RECOGNIZED AS A TAX-EXEMPT ENTITY AND CHARITABLE ORGANIZATION UNDER 501(C)(3) OF THE IRC. ALTHOUGH THERE IS NO DEFINITION IN THE TAX CODE FOR THE TERM ""CHARITABLE"" A REGULATION PROMULGATED BY THE DEPARTMENT OF THE TREASURY PROVIDES SOME GUIDANCE AND STATES THAT ""THE TERM CHARITABLE IS USED IN SECTION 501(C)(3) IN ITS GENERALLY ACCEPTED LEGAL SENSE,PROVIDES EXAMPLES OF CHARITABLE PURPOSES, INCLUDING THE RELIEF OF THE POOR OR UNPRIVILEGED; THE PROMOTION OF SOCIAL WELFARE; AND THE ADVANCEMENT OF EDUCATION, RELIGION, AND SCIENCE. NOTE IT DOES NOT EXPLICITLY ADDRESS THE ACTIVITIES OF HOSPITALS. IN THE ABSENCE OF EXPLICIT STATUTORY OR REGULATORY REQUIREMENTS APPLYING THE TERM ""CHARITABLE"" TO HOSPITALS, IT HAS BEEN LEFT TO THE IRS TO DETERMINE THE CRITERIA HOSPITALS MUST MEET TO QUALIFY AS IRC 501(C)(3) CHARITABLE ORGANIZATIONS. THE ORIGINAL STANDARD WAS KNOWN AS THE CHARITY CARE STANDARD. THIS STANDARD WAS REPLACED BY THE IRS WITH THE COMMUNITY BENEFIT STANDARD WHICH IS THE CURRENT STANDARD. CHARITY CARE STANDARD IN 1956, THE IRS ISSUED REVENUE RULING 56-185, WHICH ADDRESSED THE REQUIREMENTS HOSPITALS NEEDED TO MEET IN ORDER TO QUALIFY FOR IRC 501(C)(3) STATUS. ONE OF THESE REQUIREMENTS IS KNOWN AS THE ""CHARITY CARE STANDARD."" UNDER THE STANDARD, A HOSPITAL MUST PROVIDE, TO THE EXTENT OF ITS FINANCIAL ABILITY, FREE OR REDUCED-COST CARE TO PATIENTS WHO CANNOT PAY FOR SUCH SERVICES. A HOSPITAL THAT EXPECTED FULL PAYMENT DID NOT, ACCORDING TO THE RULING, PROVIDE CHARITY CARE BASED ON THE FACT THAT SOME PATIENTS ULTIMATELY FAILED TO PAY. THE RULING EMPHASIZED THAT A LOW LEVEL OF CHARITY CARE DID NOT NECESSARILY MEAN THAT A HOSPITAL HAD FAILED TO MEET THE REQUIREMENT SINCE THAT LEVEL COULD REFLECT ITS FINANCIAL ABILITY TO PROVIDE SUCH CARE. THE RULING ALSO NOTED THAT PUBLICLY SUPPORTED COMMUNITY HOSPITALS WOULD NORMALLY QUALIFY AS CHARITABLE ORGANIZATIONS BECAUSE THEY SERVE THE ENTIRE COMMUNITY AND A LOW LEVEL OF CHARITY CARE WOULD NOT AFFECT A HOSPITAL'S EXEMPT STATUS IF IT WAS DUE TO THE SURROUNDING COMMUNITY'S LACK OF CHARITABLE DEMANDS. COMMUNITY BENEFIT STANDARD IN 1969, THE IRS ISSUED REVENUE RULING 69-545, WHICH ""REMOVED"" FROM REVENUE RULING 56-185 ""THE REQUIREMENTS RELATING TO CARING FOR PATIENTS WITHOUT CHARGE OR AT RATES BELOW COST."" UNDER THE STANDARD DEVELOPED IN REVENUE RULING 69-545, WHICH IS KNOWN AS THE ""COMMUNITY BENEFIT STANDARD,"" HOSPITALS ARE JUDGED ON WHETHER THEY PROMOTE THE HEALTH OF A BROAD CLASS OF INDIVIDUALS IN THE COMMUNITY. THE RULING INVOLVED A HOSPITAL THAT ONLY ADMITTED INDIVIDUALS WHO COULD PAY FOR THE SERVICES (BY THEMSELVES, PRIVATE INSURANCE, OR PUBLIC PROGRAMS SUCH AS MEDICARE), BUT OPERATED A FULL-TIME EMERGENCY ROOM THAT WAS OPEN TO EVERYONE. THE IRS RULED THAT THE HOSPITAL QUALIFIED AS A CHARITABLE ORGANIZATION BECAUSE IT PROMOTED THE HEALTH OF PEOPLE IN ITS COMMUNITY. THE IRS REASONED THAT BECAUSE THE PROMOTION OF HEALTH WAS A CHARITABLE PURPOSE ACCORDING TO THE GENERAL LAW OF CHARITY, IT FELL WITHIN THE ""GENERALLY ACCEPTED LEGAL SENSE"" OF THE TERM ""CHARITABLE,"" AS REQUIRED BY THE DEPARTMENT OF TREASURY REG. 1.501(C)(3)-1(D)(2). THE IRS RULING STATED THAT THE PROMOTION OF HEALTH, LIKE THE RELIEF OF POVERTY AND THE ADVANCEMENT OF EDUCATION AND RELIGION, IS ONE OF THE PURPOSES IN THE GENERAL LAW OF CHARITY THAT IS DEEMED BENEFICIAL TO THE COMMUNITY AS A WHOLE EVEN THOUGH THE CLASS OF BENEFICIARIES ELIGIBLE TO RECEIVE A DIRECT BENEFIT FROM ITS ACTIVITIES DOES NOT INCLUDE ALL MEMBERS OF THE COMMUNITY, SUCH AS INDIGENT MEMBERS OF THE COMMUNITY, PROVIDED THAT THE CLASS IS NOT SO SMALL THAT ITS RELIEF IS NOT OF BENEFIT TO THE COMMUNITY. THE IRS CONCLUDED THAT THE HOSPITAL WAS ""PROMOTING THE HEALTH OF A CLASS OF PERSONS THAT IS BROAD ENOUGH TO BENEFIT THE COMMUNITY"" BECAUSE ITS EMERGENCY ROOM WAS OPEN TO ALL AND IT PROVIDED CARE TO EVERYONE WHO COULD PAY, WHETHER DIRECTLY OR THROUGH THIRD-PARTY REIMBURSEMENT. OTHER CHARACTERISTICS OF THE HOSPITAL THAT THE IRS HIGHLIGHTED INCLUDED THE FOLLOWING: ITS SURPLUS FUNDS WERE USED TO IMPROVE PATIENT CARE, EXPAND HOSPITAL FACILITIES, AND ADVANCE MEDICAL TRAINING, EDUCATION AND RESEARCH; IT WAS CONTROLLED BY A BOARD OF TRUSTEES THAT CONSISTED OF INDEPENDENT CIVIC LEADERS; AND HOSPITAL MEDICAL STAFF PRIVILEGES WERE AVAILABLE TO ALL QUALIFIED PHYSICIANS. THE AMERICAN HOSPITAL ASSOCIATION (""AHA"") FEELS THAT MEDICARE UNDERPAYMENTS (SHORTFALL) AND BAD DEBT ARE COMMUNITY BENEFIT AND THUS INCLUDABLE ON THE FORM 990, SCHEDULE H, PART I. THIS ORGANIZATION AGREES WITH THE AHA'S POSITION. AS OUTLINED IN THE AHA'S LETTER TO THE IRS DATED AUGUST 21, 2007 WITH RESPECT TO THE FIRST PUBLISHED DRAFT OF THE NEW FORM 990 AND SCHEDULE H, THE AHA FELT THAT THE IRS SHOULD INCORPORATE THE FULL VALUE OF THE COMMUNITY BENEFIT THAT HOSPITALS PROVIDE BY COUNTING MEDICARE UNDERPAYMENTS (SHORTFALL) AS QUANTIFIABLE COMMUNITY BENEFIT FOR THE FOLLOWING REASONS: - PROVIDING CARE FOR THE ELDERLY AND SERVING MEDICARE PATIENTS IS AN ESSENTIAL PART OF THE COMMUNITY BENEFIT STANDARD - MEDICARE, LIKE MEDICAID, DOES NOT PAY THE FULL COST OF CARE. FROM THE LATEST DATA PROVIDED BY THE AHA, MEDICARE REIMBURSES HOSPITALS ONLY 87 CENTS FOR EVERY DOLLAR THEY SPEND TO TAKE CARE OF MEDICARE PATIENTS. - MANY MEDICARE BENEFICIARIES, LIKE THEIR MEDICAID COUNTERPARTS, ARE POOR. MORE THAN 42 PERCENT OF MEDICARE SPENDING IS FOR BENEFICIARIES WHOSE INCOME IS BELOW 200 PERCENT OF THE FEDERAL POVERTY LEVEL. MANY OF THOSE MEDICARE BENEFICIARIES ARE ALSO ELIGIBLE FOR MEDICAID -- SO CALLED ELIGIBLE."" THERE IS EVERY COMPELLING PUBLIC POLICY REASON TO TREAT MEDICARE AND MEDICAID UNDERPAYMENTS SIMILARLY FOR PURPOSES OF A HOSPITAL'S COMMUNITY BENEFIT AND INCLUDE THESE COSTS ON FORM 990, SCHEDULE H, PART I. MEDICARE UNDERPAYMENT MUST BE SHOULDERED BY THE HOSPITAL IN ORDER TO CONTINUE TREATING THE COMMUNITY'S ELDERLY AND POOR. THESE UNDERPAYMENTS REPRESENT A REAL COST OF SERVING THE COMMUNITY AND SHOULD COUNT AS A QUANTIFIABLE COMMUNITY BENEFIT. BOTH THE AHA AND THIS ORGANIZATION ALSO FEEL THAT PATIENT BAD DEBT IS A COMMUNITY BENEFIT AND THUS INCLUDABLE ON THE FORM 990, SCHEDULE H, PART I. LIKE MEDICARE UNDERPAYMENT (SHORTFALLS), THERE ALSO ARE COMPELLING REASONS THAT PATIENT BAD DEBT SHOULD BE COUNTED AS QUANTIFIABLE COMMUNITY BENEFIT AS FOLLOWS: - A SIGNIFICANT MAJORITY OF BAD DEBT IS ATTRIBUTABLE TO LOW-INCOME PATIENTS, WHO, FOR MANY REASONS, DECLINE TO COMPLETE THE FORMS REQUIRED TO ESTABLISH ELIGIBILITY FOR HOSPITALS' CHARITY CARE OR THOSE WHO DO NOT PAY ALL, OR A PORTION OF THE ALREADY DISCOUNTED BILLED AMOUNTS UNDER OUR FINANCIAL ASSISTANCE POLICY. A 2006 CONGRESSIONAL BUDGET OFFICE (""CBO"") REPORT, NONPROFIT HOSPITALS AND THE PROVISION OF COMMUNITY BENEFITS, CITED TWO STUDIES INDICATING THAT ""THE GREAT MAJORITY OF BAD DEBT WAS ATTRIBUTABLE TO PATIENTS WITH INCOMES BELOW 200% OF THE FEDERAL POVERTY LINE."" - THE REPORT ALSO NOTED THAT A SUBSTANTIAL PORTION OF BAD DEBT IS PENDING CHARITY CARE. UNLIKE BAD DEBT IN OTHER INDUSTRIES, HOSPITAL BAD DEBT IS COMPLICATED BY THE FACT THAT HOSPITALS FOLLOW THEIR MISSION TO THE COMMUNITY AND TREAT EVERY PATIENT THAT COMES THROUGH THEIR EMERGENCY DEPARTMENT, REGARDLESS OF ABILITY TO PAY. PATIENTS WHO HAVE OUTSTANDING BILLS ARE NOT TURNED AWAY, UNLIKE OTHER INDUSTRIES. BAD DEBT IS FURTHER COMPLICATED BY THE AUDITING INDUSTRY'S STANDARDS ON REPORTING CHARITY CARE. MANY PATIENTS CANNOT OR DO NOT PROVIDE THE NECESSARY, EXTENSIVE DOCUMENTATION REQUIRED TO BE DEEMED CHARITY CARE BY AUDITORS. AS A RESULT, ROUGHLY 40% OF BAD DEBT IS PENDING CHARITY CARE. THE CBO CONCLUDED THAT ITS FINDINGS ""SUPPORT THE VALIDITY OF THE USE OF UNCOMPENSATED CARE [BAD DEBT AND CHARITY CARE] AS A MEASURE OF COMMUNITY BENEFIT"" ASSUMING THE FINDINGS ARE GENERALIZABLE NATIONWIDE; THE EXPERIENCE OF HOSPITALS AROUND THE NATION REINFORCES THAT THEY ARE GENERALIZABLE. AS OUTLINED BY THE AHA, DESPITE THE HOSPITAL'S BEST EFFORTS AND DUE DILIGENCE, PATIENT BAD DEBT IS A PART OF THE HOSPITAL'S MISSION AND CHARITABLE PURPOSES. BAD DEBT REPRESENTS PART OF THE BURDEN HOSPITALS SHOULDER IN SERVING ALL PATIENTS RE"

ADDITIONALLY, HNMC IS COMMITTED TO BILL PATIENTS AND INSURANCE CARRIERS IN A MANNER THAT IS UNDERSTANDABLE, PROFESSIONAL, COMPASSIONATE AND IN COMPLIANCE WITH ALL STATE, LOCAL AND FEDERAL RULES INCLUDING INTERNAL REVENUE CODE SECTION 501(R). IT IS THE INTENTION THAT THE BILLING AND COLLECTION POLICY BE CONSISTENT WITH HNMC'S FINANCIAL ASSISTANCE POLICY (""FAP"") AND ANY INCONSISTENCIES SHALL BE GUIDED BY THE FAP AND APPLIED IN A MANNER THAT BENEFITS THE PATIENT. HNMC WILL FOLLOW THE FOLLOWING PROCEDURES WHEN PURSUING BILLING AND COLLECTION ACTIONS: (1) PATIENTS SHALL BE REGISTERED IN THE HOSPITAL'S INFORMATION SYSTEM IN A MANNER THAT ENSURES THE CAPTURE OF THE INFORMATION NECESSARY TO EFFECTIVELY PROVIDE MEDICALLY NECESSARY CARE AND TO PROFESSIONALLY BILL FOR SERVICES RENDERED; (2) AFTER SERVICES ARE RENDERED THE PATIENTS OR GUARANTOR'S INSURANCE (IF ANY) SHALL BE BILLED. IF THE PATIENT HAS NO INSURANCE AND WAS REGISTERED SELF-PAY THE BILL FOR SERVICES WILL BE ADJUSTED IN ACCORDANCE WITH THE HOSPITAL'S FAP; (3) THE HOSPITAL WILL MAKE REASONABLE EFFORTS TO COLLECT FROM AN INSURANCE CARRIER PRIOR TO BILLING THE PATIENT FOR SERVICES RENDERED.

SUCH REFERRAL SHALL NOT BE DEEMED TO BE AN EXTRAORDINARY COLLECTION ACTION (""ECA""); (7) AN ACCOUNT WITH A COLLECTION AGENCY SHALL GENERALLY BE PURSUED UP TO 180 DAYS UNLESS, AFTER CONSULTING WITH THE HOSPITAL, IT IS DETERMINED TO MAINTAIN AN ACCOUNT BEYOND THAT TIMEFRAME. IF IT IS DETERMINED BY THE HOSPITAL'S PATIENT FINANCIAL SERVICES DEPARTMENT THAT THE ACCOUNT REQUIRES AN ECA, AND SUCH ACCOUNT MEETS THE REQUIREMENTS OF INTERNAL REVENUE CODE SECTION 501(R), INCLUDING BUT NOT LIMITED TO WAITING A MINIMUM OF 120 DAYS AFTER THE FIRST POST DISCHARGE BILL TO COMMENCE ECA ACTIVITIES, THE AGENCY SHALL NOTIFY THE PATIENT IN WRITING A MINIMUM OF 30 DAYS PRIOR TO COMMENCING ECA. SUCH NOTIFICATION SHALL INCLUDE A COPY OF THE HOSPITALS PLAIN LANGUAGE SUMMARY OF THE FAP ALONG WITH A STATEMENT AS TO WHICH ECA'S THE AGENCY MAY BE TAKING. IF WITHIN THE 30 DAY NOTICE PERIOD THE PATIENT REQUESTS FINANCIAL ASSISTANCE, AND THE ACCOUNT IS NOT OLDER THAN 240 DAYS FROM THE FIRST POST DISCHARGE BILL, THEN THE PATIENT SHALL BE GIVEN TIME TO APPLY FOR FINANCIAL ASSISTANCE BEFORE ANY ECAS MAY BE INITIATED. IN THE EVENT THAT AN ECA HAS BEEN INITIATED AND THE ACCOUNT IS NOT OLDER THAN 240 DAYS FROM THE FIRST POST DISCHARGE BILLING DATE AND THE PATIENT REQUESTS FINANCIAL ASSISTANCE THEN THE ECA WILL BE SUSPENDED TO ALLOW FOR THE PATIENT TO APPLY FOR FINANCIAL ASSISTANCE. THE FIRST POST DISCHARGE BILL SHALL BE THE FIRST BILL A PATIENT RECEIVES FOR SERVICES REGARDLESS IF SERVICES ARE ONGOING.

HNMC'S SECONDARY SERVICE AREA (""SSA"") INCLUDES 17 MUNICIPALITIES IN BERGEN COUNTY AND 2 MUNICIPALITIES IN HUDSON COUNTY. TOGETHER, THE PSA AND SSA ACCOUNT FOR APPROXIMATELY 80 PERCENT OF THE MEDICAL CENTER'S ADMISSION VOLUME. AS THE SOLE CATHOLIC HOSPITAL IN AN AREA THAT IS ESTIMATED AT MORE THAN 50% ROMAN CATHOLIC, HNMC ALSO DRAWS FROM TOWNS WELL BEYOND BOTH THE PSA AND SSA. THE MAJORITY OF PSA TOWNS HAVE AN AVERAGE POPULATION OF 27,500, AND ARE LOCATED IN THE SOUTHERN HALF OF BERGEN COUNTY. OVERALL, THE SERVICE AREA IS 44% HISPANIC, ALTHOUGH THE PROPORTIONS DIFFER MARKEDLY BETWEEN BERGEN AND HUDSON: 76% OF THE RESIDENTS OF BERGEN PSA TOWNS ARE NOT HISPANIC; WHILE THE FOUR HUDSON COUNTY TOWNS TOGETHER COUNT 76% OF THEIR RESIDENTS AS HISPANIC. THE RACIAL MIX OF THE PSA IS APPROXIMATELY 60% WHITE, 22% ASIAN, 10% BLACK, AND 8% OTHER, INCLUDING MULTI-RACIAL PERSONS. CERTAIN TOWNS IN THE REGION ARE HEAVILY KOREAN; KOREAN/ASIAN PRESENCE IS MUCH LESS PRONOUNCED IN THE FOUR HUDSON COUNTY TOWNS. THE BROAD AGE MAKE-UP OF THE PRIMARY SERVICE AREA INCLUDES 23% AGED UP TO 19; 50% AGED 20-54; AND 27% AGED 55 AND OLDER. THE LAST CATEGORY IS PROJECTED TO SEE THE MOST SIGNIFICANT GROWTH DURING THE NEXT FIFTEEN YEARS. WITH THE EXCEPTION OF TWO HUDSON COUNTY TOWNS, ALL SSA ZIP CODES ARE LOCATED THROUGHOUT BERGEN COUNTY. THE TOWNS IN THIS SERVICE AREA ARE MUCH SMALLER THAN THOSE OF THE PSA, AVERAGING ONLY 14,000 RESIDENTS EACH. IN STARK CONTRAST TO THE LARGELY HISPANIC HUDSON COUNTY PSA TOWNS, THE TWO HUDSON SSA TOWNS ARE ONLY 20% HISPANIC. THE OVERALL RACIAL MIX OF THE SERVICE AREA IS 76% WHITE, 13% ASIAN, 4% BLACK, AND 7% OTHER, INCLUDING MULTI-RACIAL PERSONS. THE OVERALL KOREAN PRESENCE IS SIGNIFICANT, BUT ONLY HALF THAT SEEN IN THE PRIMARY SERVICE AREA. THE AREA'S AGE MIX IS SIMILAR TO THE PSA, WITH 23% AGED UP TO 19; 51% AGED 20-54; AND 26% AGED 55 AND OLDER. THE MEDICAL CENTER'S SERVICE AREA IS PRIMARILY SUBURBAN, WITH MANY RESIDENTS WORKING OUTSIDE BERGEN COUNTY IN PLACES SUCH AS NEW YORK CITY. HOWEVER, THERE ARE LARGE EMPLOYERS IN THE SERVICE AREA, E.G., OTHER HOSPITALS, A LARGE SPORTS CHAIN, A LARGE COMMUNICATIONS FIRM, A LARGE PHARMACEUTICAL FIRM, A UNIVERSITY, AND A LARGE COMMERCIAL LABORATORY. RESIDENTS OF HNMC'S SERVICE AREA ARE ALSO SERVED BY TWO COMMUNITY HOSPITALS AND A TERTIARY CARE FACILITY WITH TRAUMA SERVICES. GIVEN THE NUMBER OF SERVICE AREA RESIDENTS WHO WORK IN NEARBY NEW YORK CITY, IT IS NOT SURPRISING THAT A SMALL PORTION OF THESE RESIDENTS ALSO RECEIVE THEIR HEALTHCARE IN MANHATTAN. HNMC'S PSA AND SSA COVER A MAJORITY OF THE TOWNS SERVICED BY THE OTHER COMMUNITY HOSPITALS, WHEREAS THE TERTIARY CARE FACILITY'S PRIMARY SERVICE AREA ALSO INCLUDES MANY TOWNS TO THE WEST THAT ARE NOT PART OF HNMC'S SERVICE AREA. NEW JERSEY IS EXPERIENCING SIGNIFICANT CONSOLIDATION OF FORMERLY INDEPENDENT HOSPITALS INTO ANY OF THREE LARGE SYSTEMS. TWO OF THE THREE HOSPITALS WITHIN HNMCS SERVICE AREA ARE PART OF NEW JERSEYS LARGEST SYSTEM; THE THIRD IS AWAITING APPROVAL TO JOIN THEM. WHILE THE SERVICE AREA IS PREDOMINANTLY NON-HISPANIC CAUCASIAN, BOTH HISPANICS (OF ANY RACE) AND ASIAN POPULATIONS (PRINCIPALLY KOREAN) ARE THE FASTEST GROWING GROUPS. IN RESPONSE, THE MEDICAL CENTER HAS PROGRAMS ADDRESSING THESE GROUPS' NEEDS, AND PHYSICIANS AND NURSES FLUENT IN THE APPLICABLE LANGUAGES. IN 2008, APPROXIMATELY 75 KOREAN PHYSICIANS JOINED THE MEDICAL STAFF, ADDING TO THE NEED FOR STAFF AND SERVICES TO MEET THIS GROWING SEGMENT OF THE COMMUNITY. IN 2014, THE MEDICAL CENTER EXPANDED ITS KOREAN MEDICAL PROGRAM TO INCLUDE A FOCUS ON CHINESE AND FILIPINO RESIDENTS AS WELL, RENAMING THE SERVICE ""ASIAN HEALTH SERVICES,THEREAFTER BOTH JAPANESE AND ASIAN INDIAN PROGRAMS WERE INCORPORATED AS WELL."

THE COMMUNITY BENEFIT STANDARD IS THE CURRENT STANDARD FOR A HOSPITAL FOR RECOGNITION AS A TAX-EXEMPT AND CHARITABLE ORGANIZATION UNDER INTERNAL REVENUE CODE (""IRC"") 501(C)(3). THE ORGANIZATION IS RECOGNIZED AS A TAX-EXEMPT ENTITY AND CHARITABLE ORGANIZATION UNDER 501(C)(3) OF THE IRC. ALTHOUGH THERE IS NO DEFINITION IN THE TAX CODE FOR THE TERM ""CHARITABLE"" A REGULATION PROMULGATED BY THE DEPARTMENT OF THE TREASURY PROVIDES SOME GUIDANCE AND STATES THAT ""THE TERM CHARITABLE IS USED IN SECTION 501(C)(3) IN ITS GENERALLY ACCEPTED LEGAL SENSE,PROVIDES EXAMPLES OF CHARITABLE PURPOSES, INCLUDING THE RELIEF OF THE POOR OR UNPRIVILEGED; THE PROMOTION OF SOCIAL WELFARE; AND THE ADVANCEMENT OF EDUCATION, RELIGION, AND SCIENCE. NOTE IT DOES NOT EXPLICITLY ADDRESS THE ACTIVITIES OF HOSPITALS. IN THE ABSENCE OF EXPLICIT STATUTORY OR REGULATORY REQUIREMENTS APPLYING THE TERM ""CHARITABLE"" TO HOSPITALS, IT HAS BEEN LEFT TO THE IRS TO DETERMINE THE CRITERIA HOSPITALS MUST MEET TO QUALIFY AS IRC 501(C)(3) CHARITABLE ORGANIZATIONS. THE ORIGINAL STANDARD WAS KNOWN AS THE CHARITY CARE STANDARD. THIS STANDARD WAS REPLACED BY THE IRS WITH THE COMMUNITY BENEFIT STANDARD WHICH IS THE CURRENT STANDARD. CHARITY CARE STANDARD IN 1956, THE IRS ISSUED REVENUE RULING 56-185, WHICH ADDRESSED THE REQUIREMENTS HOSPITALS NEEDED TO MEET IN ORDER TO QUALIFY FOR IRC 501(C)(3) STATUS. ONE OF THESE REQUIREMENTS IS KNOWN AS THE ""CHARITY CARE STANDARD."" UNDER THE STANDARD, A HOSPITAL HAD TO PROVIDE, TO THE EXTENT OF ITS FINANCIAL ABILITY, FREE OR REDUCED-COST CARE TO PATIENTS UNABLE TO PAY FOR IT. A HOSPITAL THAT EXPECTED FULL PAYMENT DID NOT, ACCORDING TO THE RULING, PROVIDE CHARITY CARE BASED ON THE FACT THAT SOME PATIENTS ULTIMATELY FAILED TO PAY. THE RULING EMPHASIZED THAT A LOW LEVEL OF CHARITY CARE DID NOT NECESSARILY MEAN THAT A HOSPITAL HAD FAILED TO MEET THE REQUIREMENT SINCE THAT LEVEL COULD REFLECT ITS FINANCIAL ABILITY TO PROVIDE SUCH CARE. THE RULING ALSO NOTED THAT PUBLICLY SUPPORTED COMMUNITY HOSPITALS WOULD NORMALLY QUALIFY AS CHARITABLE ORGANIZATIONS BECAUSE THEY SERVE THE ENTIRE COMMUNITY AND A LOW LEVEL OF CHARITY CARE WOULD NOT AFFECT A HOSPITAL'S EXEMPT STATUS IF IT WAS DUE TO THE SURROUNDING COMMUNITY'S LACK OF CHARITABLE DEMANDS. COMMUNITY BENEFIT STANDARD IN 1969, THE IRS ISSUED REVENUE RULING 69-545, WHICH ""REMOVE(D)"" FROM REVENUE RULING 56-185 ""THE REQUIREMENTS RELATING TO CARING FOR PATIENTS WITHOUT CHARGE OR AT RATES BELOW COST."" UNDER THE STANDARD DEVELOPED IN REVENUE RULING 69-545, WHICH IS KNOWN AS THE ""COMMUNITY BENEFIT STANDARD,"" HOSPITALS ARE JUDGED ON WHETHER THEY PROMOTE THE HEALTH OF A BROAD CLASS OF INDIVIDUALS IN THE COMMUNITY. THE RULING INVOLVED A HOSPITAL THAT ONLY ADMITTED INDIVIDUALS WHO COULD PAY FOR THE SERVICES (BY THEMSELVES, PRIVATE INSURANCE, OR PUBLIC PROGRAMS SUCH AS MEDICARE), BUT OPERATED A FULL-TIME EMERGENCY ROOM THAT WAS OPEN TO EVERYONE. THE IRS RULED THAT THE HOSPITAL QUALIFIED AS A CHARITABLE ORGANIZATION BECAUSE IT PROMOTED THE HEALTH OF PEOPLE IN ITS COMMUNITY. THE IRS REASONED THAT BECAUSE THE PROMOTION OF HEALTH WAS A CHARITABLE PURPOSE ACCORDING TO THE GENERAL LAW OF CHARITY, IT FELL WITHIN THE ""GENERALLY ACCEPTED LEGAL SENSE"" OF THE TERM ""CHARITABLE,"" AS REQUIRED BY TREAS. REG. 1.501(C)(3)-1(D)(2). THE IRS RULING STATED THAT THE PROMOTION OF HEALTH, LIKE THE RELIEF OF POVERTY AND THE ADVANCEMENT OF EDUCATION AND RELIGION, IS ONE OF THE PURPOSES IN THE GENERAL LAW OF CHARITY THAT IS DEEMED BENEFICIAL TO THE COMMUNITY AS A WHOLE EVEN THOUGH THE CLASS OF BENEFICIARIES ELIGIBLE TO RECEIVE A DIRECT BENEFIT FROM ITS ACTIVITIES DOES NOT INCLUDE ALL MEMBERS OF THE COMMUNITY, SUCH AS INDIGENT MEMBERS OF THE COMMUNITY, PROVIDED THAT THE CLASS IS NOT SO SMALL THAT ITS RELIEF IS NOT OF BENEFIT TO THE COMMUNITY. THE IRS CONCLUDED THAT THE HOSPITAL WAS ""PROMOTING THE HEALTH OF A CLASS OF PERSONS THAT IS BROAD ENOUGH TO BENEFIT THE COMMUNITY"" BECAUSE ITS EMERGENCY ROOM WAS OPEN TO ALL AND IT PROVIDED CARE TO EVERYONE WHO COULD PAY, WHETHER DIRECTLY OR THROUGH THIRD-PARTY REIMBURSEMENT. OTHER CHARACTERISTICS OF THE HOSPITAL THAT THE IRS HIGHLIGHTED INCLUDED THE FOLLOWING: ITS SURPLUS FUNDS WERE USED TO IMPROVE PATIENT CARE, EXPAND HOSPITAL FACILITIES, AND ADVANCE MEDICAL TRAINING, EDUCATION, AND RESEARCH; IT WAS CONTROLLED BY A BOARD OF TRUSTEES THAT CONSISTED OF INDEPENDENT CIVIC LEADERS; AND HOSPITAL MEDICAL STAFF PRIVILEGES WERE AVAILABLE TO ALL QUALIFIED PHYSICIANS. THE AMERICAN HOSPITAL ASSOCIATION (""AHA"") BELIEVES THAT MEDICARE UNDERPAYMENTS (SHORTFALL) AND BAD DEBT ARE COMMUNITY BENEFIT AND THUS INCLUDABLE ON THE FORM 990, SCHEDULE H, PART I. THIS ORGANIZATION AGREES WITH THE AHA POSITION. AS OUTLINED IN THE AHA LETTER TO THE IRS DATED AUGUST 21, 2007 WITH RESPECT TO THE FIRST PUBLISHED DRAFT OF THE NEW FORM 990 AND SCHEDULE H, THE AHA FELT THAT THE IRS SHOULD INCORPORATE THE FULL VALUE OF THE COMMUNITY BENEFIT THAT HOSPITALS PROVIDE BY COUNTING MEDICARE UNDERPAYMENTS (SHORTFALL) AS QUANTIFIABLE COMMUNITY BENEFIT FOR THE FOLLOWING REASONS: - PROVIDING CARE FOR THE ELDERLY AND SERVING MEDICARE PATIENTS IS AN ESSENTIAL PART OF THE COMMUNITY BENEFIT STANDARD. - MEDICARE, LIKE MEDICAID, DOES NOT PAY THE FULL COST OF CARE. RECENTLY, MEDICARE REIMBURSES HOSPITALS ONLY 92 CENTS FOR EVERY DOLLAR THEY SPEND TO TAKE CARE OF MEDICARE PATIENTS. THE MEDICARE PAYMENT ADVISORY COMMISSION (""MEDPAC"") IN ITS MARCH 2007 REPORT TO CONGRESS CAUTIONED THAT UNDERPAYMENT WILL GET EVEN WORSE, WITH MARGINS REACHING A 10-YEAR LOW AT NEGATIVE 5.4 PERCENT. - MANY MEDICARE BENEFICIARIES, LIKE THEIR MEDICAID COUNTERPARTS, ARE POOR. MORE THAN 46 PERCENT OF MEDICARE SPENDING IS FOR BENEFICIARIES WHOSE INCOME IS BELOW 200 PERCENT OF THE FEDERAL POVERTY LEVEL. MANY OF THOSE MEDICARE BENEFICIARIES ARE ALSO ELIGIBLE FOR MEDICAID - SO CALLED ELIGIBLES."" THERE IS EVERY COMPELLING PUBLIC POLICY REASON TO TREAT MEDICARE AND MEDICAID UNDERPAYMENTS SIMILARLY FOR PURPOSES OF A HOSPITAL'S COMMUNITY BENEFIT AND INCLUDE THESE COSTS ON FORM 990, SCHEDULE H, PART I. MEDICARE UNDERPAYMENT MUST BE SHOULDERED BY THE HOSPITAL IN ORDER TO CONTINUE TREATING THE COMMUNITY'S ELDERLY AND POOR. THESE UNDERPAYMENTS REPRESENT A REAL COST OF SERVING THE COMMUNITY AND SHOULD COUNT AS A QUANTIFIABLE COMMUNITY BENEFIT. BOTH THE AHA AND THIS ORGANIZATION ALSO FEEL THAT PATIENT BAD DEBT IS A COMMUNITY BENEFIT AND THUS INCLUDABLE ON THE FORM 990, SCHEDULE H, PART I. LIKE MEDICARE UNDERPAYMENT (SHORTFALLS), THERE ALSO ARE COMPELLING REASONS THAT PATIENT BAD DEBT SHOULD BE COUNTED AS QUANTIFIABLE COMMUNITY BENEFIT AS FOLLOWS: - A SIGNIFICANT MAJORITY OF BAD DEBT IS ATTRIBUTABLE TO LOW-INCOME PATIENTS, WHO, FOR MANY REASONS, DECLINE TO COMPLETE THE FORMS REQUIRED TO ESTABLISH ELIGIBILITY FOR HOSPITALS' CHARITY CARE OR FINANCIAL ASSISTANCE PROGRAMS. A 2006 CONGRESSIONAL BUDGET OFFICE (""CBO"") REPORT, NONPROFIT HOSPITALS AND THE PROVISION OF COMMUNITY BENEFITS, CITED TWO STUDIES INDICATING THAT ""THE GREAT MAJORITY OF BAD DEBT WAS ATTRIBUTABLE TO PATIENTS WITH INCOMES BELOW 200% OF THE FEDERAL POVERTY LINE."" - THE REPORT ALSO NOTED THAT A SUBSTANTIAL PORTION OF BAD DEBT IS PENDING CHARITY CARE. UNLIKE BAD DEBT IN OTHER INDUSTRIES, HOSPITAL BAD DEBT IS COMPLICATED BY THE FACT THAT HOSPITALS FOLLOW THEIR MISSION TO THE COMMUNITY AND TREAT EVERY PATIENT THAT COMES THROUGH THEIR EMERGENCY DEPARTMENT, REGARDLESS OF ABILITY TO PAY. PATIENTS WHO HAVE OUTSTANDING BILLS ARE NOT TURNED AWAY, UNLIKE OTHER INDUSTRIES. BAD DEBT IS FURTHER COMPLICATED BY THE AUDITING INDUSTRY'S STANDARDS ON REPORTING CHARITY CARE. MANY PATIENTS CANNOT OR DO NOT PROVIDE THE NECESSARY, EXTENSIVE DOCUMENTATION REQUIRED TO BE DEEMED CHARITY CARE BY AUDITORS. AS A RESULT, ROUGHLY 40% OF BAD DEBT IS PENDING CHARITY CARE. - THE CBO CONCLUDED THAT ITS FINDINGS ""SUPPORT THE VALIDITY OF THE USE OF UNCOMPENSATED CARE [BAD DEBT AND CHARITY CARE] AS A MEASURE OF COMM"

AFTER AN UNINSURED OR UNDER-INSURED PATIENT'S ACCOUNT IS REDUCED TO THE UNINSURED DISCOUNT OR THE FINANCIAL ASSISTANCE DISCOUNT RATE, WHICHEVER IS APPLICABLE, THE PATIENT IS RESPONSIBLE FOR THE REMAINDER OF ANY OUTSTANDING PATIENT BALANCES. PATIENTS WILL RECEIVE AN INITIAL STATEMENT INDICATING THEIR BALANCE DUE ALONG WITH INFORMATION REGARDING THE AVAILABILITY OF FINANCIAL ASSISTANCE AND WHO TO CONTACT. SELF-PAY BALANCES GO THROUGH A PRE-COLLECTION AGENCY PLACEMENT PROCESS THAT MAY ENTAIL THE MAILING OF STATEMENTS OR LETTERS AND/OR PHONE CALLS IN ORDER TO COLLECT PAYMENT ON OPEN BALANCES. ONCE OPEN BALANCE ACCOUNTS COMPLETE THE PRE-COLLECTION DUNNING CYCLE, (120 DAYS OR MORE) WITH NO PAYMENT OR PROOF OF ELIGIBILITY FOR FINANCIAL ASSISTANCE OR OTHER PROGRAMS, THE ACCOUNTS WILL BE TRANSFERRED TO A PROFESSIONAL COLLECTION AGENCY. IF A FINANCIAL ASSISTANCE APPLICATION AND APPROPRIATE SUPPORTING DOCUMENTS HAVE BEEN SUBMITTED AND A DECISION IS PENDING, THE ACCOUNT WILL BE HELD FROM AGENCY PLACEMENT. IN SOME CASES, A PATIENT ELIGIBLE FOR FINANCIAL ASSISTANCE MAY NOT HAVE BEEN IDENTIFIED PRIOR TO SENDING THE ACCOUNT TO AN EXTERNAL COLLECTION AGENCY. EACH AGENCY WILL BE MADE AWARE OF THE FINANCIAL ASSISTANCE POLICY AND WILL WORK WITH THE PROVIDER TO ASCERTAIN PATIENT ELIGIBILITY. EXTRAORDINARY COLLECTION ACTIONS (""ECAS"") WILL NOT BE UNDERTAKEN DURING THE INITIAL NOTIFICATION PERIOD OF THE 120 DAYS FROM THE FIRST POST-DISCHARGE BILLING STATEMENT AND UNTIL SUCH TIME AS A 30 DAY INITIATION OF ECA NOTICE HAS BEEN SENT TO THE INDIVIDUAL. THE 30 DAY ECA INITIATION NOTICE WILL CONTAIN THE ECA ACTION THAT THE PROVIDER INTENDS TO UNDERTAKE AND THE DATE AT WHICH TIME THIS WOULD OCCUR. A COPY OF THE ORGANIZATION'S PLAIN LANGUAGE SUMMARY WILL ACCOMPANY THE 30 DAY ECA INITIATION NOTICE. IF THE PATIENT SUBMITS A FINANCIAL ASSISTANCE APPLICATION, AMH WILL SUSPEND ANY ECAS UNTIL THE PATIENT'S FINANCIAL ASSISTANCE ELIGIBILITY IS DETERMINED AND THE PATIENT IS INFORMED OF THEIR ELIGIBILITY. IF A PATIENT ACCOUNT IS REFERRED TO AN OUTSIDE AGENCY, THAT AGENCY MUST FIRST AGREE TO ABIDE BY AMH'S FINANCIAL ASSISTANCE POLICY IN RELATION TO ITS COLLECTION EFFORTS. NO EXTERNAL COLLECTION AGENCY ARE PERMITTED TO ENGAGE IN ECAS UNLESS AUTHORIZED BY AMH. AFTER THE ABOVE-DESCRIBED STEPS HAVE BEEN TAKEN, AMH MAY USE ECAS WITH THE RESPECT TO THE PATIENT ACCOUNT OF AN UNINSURED OR UNDER-INSURED AND MAY FURTHER CONSIDER CREDIT BUREAU REPORTING AND/OR LEGAL ACTION AS APPROPRIATE.

SIGNIFICANT PROVISION IS MADE FOR SELF-PAY PATIENT ACCOUNTS IN THE PERIOD OF SERVICE BASED ON PAST COLLECTION EXPERIENCE. MERCY HEALTH'S CONCENTRATION OF CREDIT RISK RELATED TO NET PATIENT ACCOUNTS IS LIMITED DUE TO THE DIVERSITY OF PATIENTS AND PAYORS. NET PATIENT ACCOUNTS CONSIST OF AMOUNTS DUE FROM GOVERNMENTAL PROGRAMS (PRIMARILY MEDICARE AND MEDICAID), PRIVATE INSURANCE COMPANIES, MANAGED CARE PROGRAMS AND PATIENTS THEMSELVES. NET PATIENT SERVICE REVENUE FOR SERVICES PROVIDED TO PATIENTS WHO HAVE THIRD-PARTY PAYOR COVERAGE IS RECOGNIZED BASED ON CONTRACTUAL RATES FOR SERVICES RENDERED. MERCY HEALTH RECOGNIZES A SIGNIFICANT AMOUNT OF PATIENT SERVICE REVENUE AT THE TIME SERVICES ARE RENDERED EVEN THOUGH IT DOES NOT ASSESS THE PATIENT'S ABILITY TO PAY. AS A RESULT, THE PROVISION FOR BAD DEBTS IS PRESENTED AS A DEDUCTION FROM PATIENT SERVICE REVENUE (NET OF CONTRACTUAL PROVISIONS AND DISCOUNTS). AMOUNTS RECOGNIZED ARE SUBJECT TO ADJUSTMENT UPON REVIEW BY THIRD-PARTY PAYORS. FOR UNINSURED PATIENTS THAT DO NOT QUALIFY FOR CHARITY CARE, MERCY HEALTH RECOGNIZES REVENUE WHEN SERVICES ARE PROVIDED.

THUS, MERCY HEALTH RECORDS A SIGNIFICANT PROVISION FOR BAD DEBTS RELATED TO UNINSURED PATIENTS IN THE PERIOD THE SERVICES ARE PROVIDED.

The data received through this software is believed to err on the side of denying charity. The estimate of bad debt that could have been charity is based on the system error rate. Please note that patients who complete a full charity care application and qualify for charity under our policy are granted charity regardless of the score in the self-pay compass system."

CareAlliance collects substantially all of its third-party insured receivables, which include receivables from governmental agencies. Collections are impacted by the economic ability of patients to pay and the effectiveness of collection efforts. Significant changes in payor mix, business office operations, economic conditions, or trends in federal and state governmental healthcare coverage could affect the collection of accounts receivable. CareAlliance also continually reviews overall reserve adequacy by monitoring historical cash collections as a percentage of trailing net revenue, as well as by analyzing current-period gross charges and admissions by payor classification, aged accounts receivable by payor, and days revenue outstanding."

The Hospital wants its patients focus to be on health and recovery and not financial worry. There is absolutely no additional cost for our financial counseling assistance. Additionally, patients can meet with staff of the Medicaid program. The program staff will meet with patients individually to help them apply for publicly supported programs such as Medicaid, Medicare, and disability.

The tri-county area that makes up the primary service area has a population of approximately 750,000 residents and is expected to grow based on the results of the most recently completed Community Health Needs Assessment (CHNA). These residents are 47% Male and 53% Female with a majority between the ages of 18 and 64. The average annual household income of the tri-county area is between $50,000 - $75,000 with the average level of education being an Associates degree. The race/ethnicity of these residents is approximately 66% White (non-Hispanic), 27% African American, and 6% Hispanic/Latinx. Based on the respondents from the CHNA the average amount of individuals with no health insurance is between 6.8% in Dorchester County, 7.5% in Berkeley County, and 10.6% in Charleston County. Accordingly to national health rankings, South Carolina struggles with high rates of premature death, obesity, violent crime, poverty, and diabetes. However, County Health Rankings and Roadmaps ranks the Tri-County region high in overall health compared to the other 43 counties in South Carolina.

We are the Low Country's only non-governmental, not for profit healthcare system. With this distinction, we believe it is our responsibility to advocate for and respond to our neighbors needs through community benefit. Surplus funds are returned to our community through the development of new facilities to serve population growth, the expansion of existing facilities, subsidizing care for those who are unable to pay, sponsorship of healthcare related activities including outreach clinics and programs for the uninsured, and investing in technology to improve the quality of patient care. The Organization is committed to the enrichment of healthcare in our community as evidenced by the composition of our Board of Directors and Open Medical Staff. Our governing body is comprised of a 13-member Board of Directors. At least nine directors must have their primary residence in a community served by the System.

THE AMOUNT REFLECTED ON SCHEDULE H, PART III, LINE 2 WAS ARRIVED AT BY APPLYING THE ORGANIZATION'S COST TO CHARGE RATIO TO ITS TOTAL BAD DEBT EXPENSE. EFFECTIVE JULY 1, 2018, THE MEDICAL CENTER ADOPTED FINANCIAL ACCOUNTING STANDARDS BOARD (""FASB"") ACCOUNTING STANDARDS UPDATE (""ASU"") 2014-09, REVENUE FROM CONTRACTS WITH CUSTOMERS (TOPIC 606) (""ASU 2014-09""), USING THE RETROSPECTIVE METHOD OF APPLICATION TO ALL CONTRACTS EXISTING ON JULY 1, 2017. THE CORE PRINCIPLE OF THE STANDARD IS THAT AN ENTITY SHOULD RECOGNIZE REVENUE TO DEPICT THE TRANSFER OF PROMISED GOODS OR SERVICES TO CUSTOMERS IN AN AMOUNT THAT REFLECTS THE CONSIDERATION TO WHICH THE ENTITY EXPECTS TO BE ENTITLED IN EXCHANGE FOR THOSE GOODS OR SERVICES. THE ADOPTION OF THE STANDARD HAD NO IMPACT ON THE MEDICAL CENTERS CURRENT OR HISTORICAL FINANCIAL POSITION, RESULTS OF OPERATIONS OR CASH FLOWS. ADDITIONALLY, MANAGEMENT DOES NOT ANTICIPATE THAT THE STANDARD WILL HAVE AN IMPACT ON THE AMOUNT OR TIMING OF WHEN THE MEDICAL CENTER RECOGNIZES REVENUE PROSPECTIVELY. HOWEVER, IN ACCORDANCE WITH THE STANDARD, THE MEDICAL CENTER NOW RECOGNIZES ITS PREVIOUSLY REPORTED PROVISION FOR BAD DEBTS OF $4,946,940 FOR 2018, PRIMARILY RELATED TO ITS SELF-PAY PATIENT POPULATION, AS A DIRECT REDUCTION TO REVENUES AS AN IMPLICIT PRICING CONCESSION, INSTEAD OF SEPARATELY AS A DISCRETE DEDUCTION TO ARRIVE AT PATIENT SERVICE REVENUE. THE MEDICAL CENTERS REVENUE RECOGNITION AND ACCOUNTS RECEIVABLE POLICIES ARE MORE FULLY DESCRIBED BELOW. PATIENT ACCOUNTS RECEIVABLE PATIENT ACCOUNTS RECEIVABLE FOR WHICH THE MEDICAL CENTER RECEIVES PAYMENT UNDER COST REIMBURSEMENT, PROSPECTIVE PAYMENT FORMULAS, OR NEGOTIATED RATES, WHICH COVER THE MAJORITY OF PATIENT SERVICES, ARE STATED AT THE ESTIMATED NET AMOUNTS RECEIVABLE FROM PAYERS, WHICH ARE GENERALLY LESS THAN THE ESTABLISHED BILLING RATES OF THE MEDICAL CENTER. THE MEDICAL CENTER RECOGNIZES A RECEIVABLE WHEN THERE IS AN UNCONDITIONAL RIGHT TO PAYMENT, SUBJECT ONLY TO THE PASSAGE OF TIME. PATIENT ACCOUNTS RECEIVABLE, INCLUDING BILLED ACCOUNTS AND UNBILLED ACCOUNTS, WHICH HAVE THE UNCONDITIONAL RIGHT TO PAYMENT, AND ESTIMATED AMOUNTS DUE FROM THIRD-PARTY PAYERS FOR RETROACTIVE ADJUSTMENTS, ARE RECORDED AS RECEIVABLES SINCE THE RIGHT TO CONSIDERATION IS UNCONDITIONAL AND ONLY THE PASSAGE OF TIME IS REQUIRED BEFORE PAYMENT OF THAT CONSIDERATION IS DUE. THE ESTIMATED UNCOLLECTIBLE AMOUNTS ARE GENERALLY CONSIDERED IMPLICIT PRICE CONCESSIONS THAT ARE RECORDED AS A DIRECT REDUCTION TO PATIENT ACCOUNTS RECEIVABLE. PATIENT SERVICE REVENUE PATIENT SERVICE REVENUE IS REPORTED AT THE AMOUNTS THAT REFLECT THE CONSIDERATION TO WHICH THE MEDICAL CENTER IS EXPECTED TO BE ENTITLED TO IN EXCHANGE FOR PROVIDING PATIENT CARE FOR BOTH THE HOSPITAL AND ANY EMPLOYED PHYSICIANS. THESE AMOUNTS ARE DUE FROM PATIENTS, THIRD-PARTY PAYORS (INCLUDING MANAGED CARE ORGANIZATIONS AND GOVERNMENT PROGRAMS, I.E., MEDICARE AND MEDICAID), AND OTHERS AND THEY INCLUDE VARIABLE CONSIDERATION FOR RETROACTIVE ADJUSTMENTS DUE TO SETTLEMENT OF FUTURE AUDITS, REVIEWS, AND INVESTIGATIONS. RETROACTIVE ADJUSTMENTS ARE CONSIDERED IN THE RECOGNITION OF REVENUE ON AN ESTIMATED BASIS IN THE PERIOD THE RELATED SERVICES ARE RENDERED, AND SUCH AMOUNTS ARE ADJUSTED IN FUTURE PERIODS AS ADJUSTMENTS BECOME KNOWN OR AS YEARS ARE NO LONGER SUBJECT TO SUCH AUDITS, REVIEWS, AND INVESTIGATIONS. GENERALLY, PATIENTS AND THIRD-PARTY PAYORS ARE BILLED SEVERAL DAYS AFTER THE SERVICES ARE PERFORMED OR SHORTLY AFTER DISCHARGE. PATIENT SERVICE REVENUE IS RECOGNIZED IN THE PERIOD IN WHICH THE PERFORMANCE OBLIGATIONS ARE SATISFIED UNDER CONTRACTS BY TRANSFERRING SERVICES TO PATIENTS. PERFORMANCE OBLIGATIONS ARE DETERMINED BASED ON THE NATURE OF THE SERVICES PROVIDED. THE MEDICAL CENTER RECOGNIZES REVENUES FOR PERFORMANCE OBLIGATIONS SATISFIED OVER TIME BASED ON ACTUAL CHARGES INCURRED IN RELATION TO TOTAL EXPECTED CHARGES. THE MEDICAL CENTER BELIEVES THAT THIS METHOD PROVIDES AN APPROPRIATE DEPICTION OF THE TRANSFER OF SERVICES OVER THE TERM OF PERFORMANCE OBLIGATIONS BASED ON THE INPUTS NEEDED TO SATISFY THE OBLIGATIONS. GENERALLY, PERFORMANCE OBLIGATIONS ARE SATISFIED OVER TIME RELATED TO PATIENTS RECEIVING INPATIENT ACUTE CARE SERVICES. THE MEDICAL CENTER MEASURES PERFORMANCE OBLIGATIONS FROM ADMISSION TO THE POINT WHEN THERE ARE NO FURTHER SERVICES REQUIRED FOR THE PATIENT, WHICH IS GENERALLY THE TIME OF DISCHARGE. THE MEDICAL CENTER RECOGNIZES REVENUES FOR PERFORMANCE OBLIGATIONS SATISFIED AT A POINT IN TIME, WHICH GENERALLY RELATE TO PATIENTS RECEIVING OUTPATIENT SERVICES, WHEN: (1) SERVICES ARE PROVIDED; AND (2) WHEN IT IS BELIEVED THE PATIENT DOES NOT REQUIRE ADDITIONAL SERVICES."
202043109349302834,210662542,"SCHEDULE H, PART III, LINE 8","MEDICARE COSTS WERE DERIVED FROM THE 2019 MEDICARE COST REPORT. THE ORGANIZATION FEELS THAT MEDICARE UNDERPAYMENTS (SHORTFALL), BAD DEBT AND ASSOCIATED COSTS ARE COMMUNITY BENEFIT AND ARE INCLUDABLE ON THE FORM 990, SCHEDULE H, PART I. AS OUTLINED MORE FULLY BELOW, THE ORGANIZATION BELIEVES THAT THESE SERVICES AND RELATED COSTS PROMOTE THE HEALTH OF THE COMMUNITY AS A WHOLE AND ARE RENDERED IN CONJUNCTION WITH THE ORGANIZATION'S CHARITABLE TAX-EXEMPT PURPOSES AND MISSION IN PROVIDING MEDICALLY NECESSARY HEALTHCARE SERVICES TO ALL INDIVIDUALS IN A NON-DISCRIMINATORY MANNER WITHOUT REGARD TO RACE, COLOR, CREED, SEX, NATIONAL ORIGIN OR ABILITY TO PAY AND CONSISTENT WITH THE COMMUNITY BENEFIT STANDARD PROMULGATED BY THE IRS. THE COMMUNITY BENEFIT STANDARD IS THE CURRENT STANDARD FOR A HOSPITAL FOR RECOGNITION AS A TAX-EXEMPT AND CHARITABLE ORGANIZATION UNDER INTERNAL REVENUE CODE (""IRC"") 501(C)(3). THE ORGANIZATION IS RECOGNIZED AS A TAX-EXEMPT ENTITY AND CHARITABLE ORGANIZATION UNDER 501(C)(3) OF THE IRC. ALTHOUGH THERE IS NO DEFINITION IN THE TAX CODE FOR THE TERM ""CHARITABLE"" A REGULATION PROMULGATED BY THE DEPARTMENT OF THE TREASURY PROVIDES SOME GUIDANCE AND STATES THAT ""THE TERM CHARITABLE IS USED IN SECTION 501(C)(3) IN ITS GENERALLY ACCEPTED LEGAL SENSE,PROVIDES EXAMPLES OF CHARITABLE PURPOSES, INCLUDING THE RELIEF OF THE POOR OR UNPRIVILEGED; THE PROMOTION OF SOCIAL WELFARE; AND THE ADVANCEMENT OF EDUCATION, RELIGION, AND SCIENCE. NOTE IT DOES NOT EXPLICITLY ADDRESS THE ACTIVITIES OF HOSPITALS. IN THE ABSENCE OF EXPLICIT STATUTORY OR REGULATORY REQUIREMENTS APPLYING THE TERM ""CHARITABLE"" TO HOSPITALS, IT HAS BEEN LEFT TO THE IRS TO DETERMINE THE CRITERIA HOSPITALS MUST MEET TO QUALIFY AS IRC 501(C)(3) CHARITABLE ORGANIZATIONS. THE ORIGINAL STANDARD WAS KNOWN AS THE CHARITY CARE STANDARD. THIS STANDARD WAS REPLACED BY THE IRS WITH THE COMMUNITY BENEFIT STANDARD WHICH IS THE CURRENT STANDARD. CHARITY CARE STANDARD IN 1956, THE IRS ISSUED REVENUE RULING 56-185, WHICH ADDRESSED THE REQUIREMENTS HOSPITALS NEEDED TO MEET IN ORDER TO QUALIFY FOR IRC 501(C)(3) STATUS. ONE OF THESE REQUIREMENTS IS KNOWN AS THE ""CHARITY CARE STANDARD."" UNDER THE STANDARD, A HOSPITAL MUST PROVIDE, TO THE EXTENT OF ITS FINANCIAL ABILITY, FREE OR REDUCED-COST CARE TO PATIENTS WHO CANNOT PAY FOR SUCH SERVICES. A HOSPITAL THAT EXPECTED FULL PAYMENT DID NOT, ACCORDING TO THE RULING, PROVIDE CHARITY CARE BASED ON THE FACT THAT SOME PATIENTS ULTIMATELY FAILED TO PAY. THE RULING EMPHASIZED THAT A LOW LEVEL OF CHARITY CARE DID NOT NECESSARILY MEAN THAT A HOSPITAL HAD FAILED TO MEET THE REQUIREMENT SINCE THAT LEVEL COULD REFLECT ITS FINANCIAL ABILITY TO PROVIDE SUCH CARE. THE RULING ALSO NOTED THAT PUBLICLY SUPPORTED COMMUNITY HOSPITALS WOULD NORMALLY QUALIFY AS CHARITABLE ORGANIZATIONS BECAUSE THEY SERVE THE ENTIRE COMMUNITY AND A LOW LEVEL OF CHARITY CARE WOULD NOT AFFECT A HOSPITAL'S EXEMPT STATUS IF IT WAS DUE TO THE SURROUNDING COMMUNITY'S LACK OF CHARITABLE DEMANDS. COMMUNITY BENEFIT STANDARD IN 1969, THE IRS ISSUED REVENUE RULING 69-545, WHICH ""REMOVED"" FROM REVENUE RULING 56-185 ""THE REQUIREMENTS RELATING TO CARING FOR PATIENTS WITHOUT CHARGE OR AT RATES BELOW COST."" UNDER THE STANDARD DEVELOPED IN REVENUE RULING 69-545, WHICH IS KNOWN AS THE ""COMMUNITY BENEFIT STANDARD,"" HOSPITALS ARE JUDGED ON WHETHER THEY PROMOTE THE HEALTH OF A BROAD CLASS OF INDIVIDUALS IN THE COMMUNITY. THE RULING INVOLVED A HOSPITAL THAT ONLY ADMITTED INDIVIDUALS WHO COULD PAY FOR THE SERVICES (BY THEMSELVES, PRIVATE INSURANCE, OR PUBLIC PROGRAMS SUCH AS MEDICARE), BUT OPERATED A FULL-TIME EMERGENCY ROOM THAT WAS OPEN TO EVERYONE. THE IRS RULED THAT THE HOSPITAL QUALIFIED AS A CHARITABLE ORGANIZATION BECAUSE IT PROMOTED THE HEALTH OF PEOPLE IN ITS COMMUNITY. THE IRS REASONED THAT BECAUSE THE PROMOTION OF HEALTH WAS A CHARITABLE PURPOSE ACCORDING TO THE GENERAL LAW OF CHARITY, IT FELL WITHIN THE ""GENERALLY ACCEPTED LEGAL SENSE"" OF THE TERM ""CHARITABLE,"" AS REQUIRED BY THE DEPARTMENT OF TREASURY REG. 1.501(C)(3)-1(D)(2). THE IRS RULING STATED THAT THE PROMOTION OF HEALTH, LIKE THE RELIEF OF POVERTY AND THE ADVANCEMENT OF EDUCATION AND RELIGION, IS ONE OF THE PURPOSES IN THE GENERAL LAW OF CHARITY THAT IS DEEMED BENEFICIAL TO THE COMMUNITY AS A WHOLE EVEN THOUGH THE CLASS OF BENEFICIARIES ELIGIBLE TO RECEIVE A DIRECT BENEFIT FROM ITS ACTIVITIES DOES NOT INCLUDE ALL MEMBERS OF THE COMMUNITY, SUCH AS INDIGENT MEMBERS OF THE COMMUNITY, PROVIDED THAT THE CLASS IS NOT SO SMALL THAT ITS RELIEF IS NOT OF BENEFIT TO THE COMMUNITY. THE IRS CONCLUDED THAT THE HOSPITAL WAS ""PROMOTING THE HEALTH OF A CLASS OF PERSONS THAT IS BROAD ENOUGH TO BENEFIT THE COMMUNITY"" BECAUSE ITS EMERGENCY ROOM WAS OPEN TO ALL AND IT PROVIDED CARE TO EVERYONE WHO COULD PAY, WHETHER DIRECTLY OR THROUGH THIRD-PARTY REIMBURSEMENT. OTHER CHARACTERISTICS OF THE HOSPITAL THAT THE IRS HIGHLIGHTED INCLUDED THE FOLLOWING: ITS SURPLUS FUNDS WERE USED TO IMPROVE PATIENT CARE, EXPAND HOSPITAL FACILITIES, AND ADVANCE MEDICAL TRAINING, EDUCATION AND RESEARCH; IT WAS CONTROLLED BY A BOARD OF TRUSTEES THAT CONSISTED OF INDEPENDENT CIVIC LEADERS; AND HOSPITAL MEDICAL STAFF PRIVILEGES WERE AVAILABLE TO ALL QUALIFIED PHYSICIANS. THE AMERICAN HOSPITAL ASSOCIATION (""AHA"") FEELS THAT MEDICARE UNDERPAYMENTS (SHORTFALL) AND BAD DEBT ARE COMMUNITY BENEFIT AND THUS INCLUDABLE ON THE FORM 990, SCHEDULE H, PART I. THIS ORGANIZATION AGREES WITH THE AHA'S POSITION. AS OUTLINED IN THE AHA'S LETTER TO THE IRS DATED AUGUST 21, 2007 WITH RESPECT TO THE FIRST PUBLISHED DRAFT OF THE NEW FORM 990 AND SCHEDULE H, THE AHA FELT THAT THE IRS SHOULD INCORPORATE THE FULL VALUE OF THE COMMUNITY BENEFIT THAT HOSPITALS PROVIDE BY COUNTING MEDICARE UNDERPAYMENTS (SHORTFALL) AS QUANTIFIABLE COMMUNITY BENEFIT FOR THE FOLLOWING REASONS: - PROVIDING CARE FOR THE ELDERLY AND SERVING MEDICARE PATIENTS IS AN ESSENTIAL PART OF THE COMMUNITY BENEFIT STANDARD - MEDICARE, LIKE MEDICAID, DOES NOT PAY THE FULL COST OF CARE. FROM THE LATEST DATA PROVIDED BY THE AHA, AS OF 2017, MEDICARE REIMBURSES HOSPITALS ONLY 87 CENTS FOR EVERY DOLLAR THEY SPEND TO TAKE CARE OF MEDICARE PATIENTS. - MANY MEDICARE BENEFICIARIES, LIKE THEIR MEDICAID COUNTERPARTS, ARE POOR. MORE THAN 42 PERCENT OF MEDICARE SPENDING IS FOR BENEFICIARIES WHOSE INCOME IS BELOW 200 PERCENT OF THE FEDERAL POVERTY LEVEL. MANY OF THOSE MEDICARE BENEFICIARIES ARE ALSO ELIGIBLE FOR MEDICAID -- SO CALLED ELIGIBLE."" THERE IS EVERY COMPELLING PUBLIC POLICY REASON TO TREAT MEDICARE AND MEDICAID UNDERPAYMENTS SIMILARLY FOR PURPOSES OF A HOSPITAL'S COMMUNITY BENEFIT AND INCLUDE THESE COSTS ON FORM 990, SCHEDULE H, PART I. MEDICARE UNDERPAYMENT MUST BE SHOULDERED BY THE HOSPITAL IN ORDER TO CONTINUE TREATING THE COMMUNITY'S ELDERLY AND POOR. THESE UNDERPAYMENTS REPRESENT A REAL COST OF SERVING THE COMMUNITY AND SHOULD COUNT AS A QUANTIFIABLE COMMUNITY BENEFIT. BOTH THE AHA AND THIS ORGANIZATION ALSO FEEL THAT PATIENT BAD DEBT IS A COMMUNITY BENEFIT AND THUS INCLUDABLE ON THE FORM 990, SCHEDULE H, PART I. LIKE MEDICARE UNDERPAYMENT (SHORTFALLS), THERE ALSO ARE COMPELLING REASONS THAT PATIENT BAD DEBT SHOULD BE COUNTED AS QUANTIFIABLE COMMUNITY BENEFIT AS FOLLOWS: - A SIGNIFICANT MAJORITY OF BAD DEBT IS ATTRIBUTABLE TO LOW-INCOME PATIENTS, WHO, FOR MANY REASONS, DECLINE TO COMPLETE THE FORMS REQUIRED TO ESTABLISH ELIGIBILITY FOR HOSPITALS' CHARITY CARE OR THOSE WHO DO NOT PAY ALL, OR A PORTION OF THE ALREADY DISCOUNTED BILLED AMOUNTS UNDER OUR FINANCIAL ASSISTANCE POLICY. A 2006 CONGRESSIONAL BUDGET OFFICE (""CBO"") REPORT, NONPROFIT HOSPITALS AND THE PROVISION OF COMMUNITY BENEFITS, CITED TWO STUDIES INDICATING THAT ""THE GREAT MAJORITY OF BAD DEBT WAS ATTRIBUTABLE TO PATIENTS WITH INCOMES BELOW 200% OF THE FEDERAL POVERTY LINE."" - THE REPORT ALSO NOTED THAT A SUBSTANTIAL PORTION OF BAD DEBT IS PENDING CHARITY CARE. UNLIKE BAD DEBT IN OTHER INDUSTRIES, HOSPITAL BAD DEBT IS COMPLICATED BY THE FACT THAT HOSPITALS FOLLOW THEIR MISSION TO THE COMMUNITY AND TREAT EVERY PATIENT THAT COMES THROUGH THEIR EMERGENCY DEPARTMENT, REGARDLESS OF ABILITY TO PAY. PATIENTS WHO HAVE OUTSTANDING BILLS ARE NOT TURNED AWAY, UNLIKE OTHER INDUSTRIES. BAD DEBT IS FURTHER COMPLICATED BY THE AUDITING INDUSTRY'S STANDARDS ON REPORTING CHARITY CARE. MANY PATIENTS CANNOT OR DO NOT PROVIDE THE NECESSARY, EXTENSIVE DOCUMENTATION REQUIRED TO BE DEEMED CHARITY CARE BY AUDITORS. AS A RESULT, ROUGHLY 40% OF BAD DEBT IS PENDING CHARITY CARE. THE CBO CONCLUDED THAT ITS FINDINGS ""SUPPORT THE VALIDITY OF THE USE OF UNCOMPENSATED CARE [BAD DEBT AND CHARITY CARE] AS A MEASURE OF COMMUNITY BENEFIT"" ASSUMING THE FINDINGS ARE GENERALIZABLE NATIONWIDE; THE EXPERIENCE OF HOSPITALS AROUND THE NATION REINFORCES THAT THEY ARE GENERALIZABLE. AS OUTLINED BY THE AHA, DESPITE THE HOSPITAL'S BEST EFFORTS AND DUE DILIGENCE, PATIENT BAD DEBT IS A PART OF THE HOSPITAL'S MISSION AND CHARITABLE PURPOSES. BAD DEBT REPRESENTS PART OF THE BURDEN HOSPITALS SHOULDER IN SERVING ALL"

Training materials were revised, new scripting was developed, and training sessions were held for applicable Revenue Cycle employees which required competency sign-off for those who completed the training. Procedures initially implemented included offering a copy of the plain language summary (PLS) to patients as part of the intake process. Individuals were notified about the Financial Assistance Policy (FAP) by receiving a conspicuous written notice about the FAP on their billing statements, and via conspicuous public displays or other measures reasonably calculated to attract patients' attention. As a result of an annual internal review, it was determined that the PLS of Bon Secours Mercy Health's Healthcare FAP was not being offered to all patients at intake during 2018. Immediately upon recognition of the minor oversight, Bon Secours Mercy Health began taking steps to offer a copy of the PLS to all patients who visit the hospital facilities by adding scripting to notify patients of the availability of financial assistance and offering a copy of the PLS to the patient intake process. In addition, Bon Secours Mercy Health added new language to the Consent for Treatment, Payment, and Health Care Operations (Consent) form required to be signed by all patients, including a copy of the PLS attached as an addendum to the Consent to certify that the patient is aware of Bon Secours Mercy Health's FAP and a copy of the PLS was offered. Additional training has also been provided to all applicable staff. Bon Secours Mercy Health widely publicized its FAP, the FAP Application, and the PLS on the organization's website, includes a conspicuous written notice about the FAP on patients' billing statements, posts conspicuous public displays in the Emergency Department and Registration areas of the hospitals, and notifies members of the community about availability of the FAP. Bon Secours Mercy Health will continue to perform an internal audit on a regular and continuous basis at least once per year to ensure compliance.

The cost report segregates the total facility actual expenses into costs for support departments, clinical departments (routine and ancillary) and non reimbursable departments. The cost report uses appropriate statistical bases to ""step down"" support costs to allowable clinical and non-reimbursable departments. The charges for clinical departments are matched to the total cost for these departments for a cost-to-charge ratio. Medicare-specific allowable costs for in- and outpatient ancillary departments are computed by applying the department-specific cost-to-charge ratio to the Medicare program charges by department. For routine departments, a per diem total cost is computed and applied to Medicare program days for the Medicare routine program cost. The organization feels the total shortfall of Medicare reimbursement compared to computed Medicare allowable costs should be treated as community benefit. The hospital improves access to patient care by providing services regardless of a patient's ability to pay or the hospital's ability to receive full cost reimbursement for services. The hospital also relieves the government of a financial burden when it provides care to publicly insured patients where reimbursement is less than cost of providing the service."

If full assistance is approved, no collection efforts are pursued on that patient's account(s). If partial assistance is approved, the patient is responsible for the adjusted account balance and collection efforts will follow the established practices for all patients where a self-pay balance exists. Collection efforts are not pursued on any pending FAP account. Specific criteria exists for how much financial assistance, partial or total, will be provided to the patient based on the assessed need. Criteria is based on Federal Poverty Guidelines and is reviewed and updated annually. Once a patient has been deemed eligible for the Patient Financial Assistance Program (FAP), the patient is notified by letter within 60 days after receipt of the application and supporting documentation. The patient retains eligibility for a period of eight months from the date of the application. This eligibility is identified by hospital admissions, billing and collection staff by the assignment of a specific financial class with accompanying eligibility dates. At the end of the eight months, the patient is responsible for reapplying for FAP eligibility."

Since 1998, Memorial Regional Medical Center has provided a continuation of RMH's commitment and preserved its monumental importance. Memorial Regional Medical Center is an acute care facility licensed for 225 beds, serving residents primarily from the counties of Hanover, Henrico, King and Queen, King William and New Kent and Richmond City. Bon Secours Richmond Health System serves the larger Richmond, Virginia metropolitan area and includes four hospital facilities whose service areas largely overlap. While the hospitals serve patients from many cities and counties, the majority of patients fall within the counties of Chesterfield, Henrico, Hanover and the City of Richmond totaling over 1 million residents. For the purpose of this CHNA, we refer to these as the ""Richmond Core Service Area."" The Richmond Core Service Area is primarily Caucasian and African American. When the demographics of the City of Richmond are viewed alone, we find a much lower percentage of Caucasians and a much higher percentage of African Americans than the community overall. The population age distribution for the Richmond Core Service Area is similar to Virginia overall with the exception of the City of Richmond, which has a higher percentage of 19-64 year olds (69%) and lower percentages of children (18%) and older adults (13%). Median household incomes in the United States are less than those found in Virginia overall. The Richmond Core Service Area counties of Henrico, Hanover and Chesterfield all have higher median household incomes than the U.S. overall. In contrast, the City of Richmond has a much lower median household income as compared to the U.S. and Virginia overall. Compared to Virginia, the percentage of uninsured adults is highest in the City of Richmond and lowest in Hanover County. The percentages of uninsured children show a much lower degree of variance."

The System was organized in June 1983 to fulfill the healthcare mission of the United States Province of the Congregation of the Sisters of Bon Secours of Paris, a congregation of religious women of the Roman Catholic Church founded in France in 1824. The System's activities are in the states of Ohio, New York, Pennsylvania, Maryland, Virginia, Kentucky, South Carolina, and Florida, each referred to as a local system. The Ministry of BSMH aids those in need, particularly those who are sick and dying, by offering services that include but are not limited to acute inpatient, outpatient, pastoral, palliative, home health, nursing home, rehabilitative, primary and secondary care and assisted living without regard to race, religion, color, gender, age, marital status, national origin, sexual orientation, or disability. As a member of the Catholic health ministry and a member of BSMH, this organization and its related entities are called to continue the healing ministry of Jesus. We exist to benefit the people living in the communities it serves. Through all of the services offered to the community, the mission is ""to bring compassion to health care and to be good help to those in need, especially those who are poor and dying. As a System of caregivers, we commit ourselves to help bring people and communities to health and wholeness as part of the healing ministry of Jesus Christ and the Catholic Church."" This organization and related organizations share the BSMH Vision. BSMH's vision to partner with communities to create a more humane world, build social justice for all and provide exceptional value for those served is implemented through its Strategic Quality Plan which provides focus in four goal areas for the current three year period (2019-2021). - Co-Create Healthy Communities: We recognize that the factors which drive health outcomes extend well beyond the scope of traditional health care services. Thus, we commit to improve the health of communities through partnership and collaboration with a broad range of constituencies including committed community residents - Be Person Centric: We recognize that those whom we serve are increasingly engaged in their own care and are seeking convenience, affordability and reliability. Thus, we commit to anticipate and respond to the changing expectations of health care consumers, and to ensure that we engage each person in an individualized plan for health with a focus on prevention and wellness. - Serve Those Who Are Vulnerable: We recognize, by our Catholic identity, that the struggle for a more humane world is not an option, but an integral part of spreading the gospel. Thus, we commit to serve those who are vulnerable in many ways, addressing health disparities, sustaining global ministries, healing the environment and working to end violence and oppression. - Strengthen Our Culture and Capabilities: We recognize that the health care delivery system is undergoing rapid change with increasing complexity. Thus, we commit to liberate the potential of our people by strengthening individual and collective capabilities with respect to ministry leadership, knowledge, analytics, innovation and finances.

Prior to joining University, Lakeview Hospital was wholly-owned and operated by an affiliate of HCA Healthcare, Inc. The patient accounts receivable billing and collection processes are performed by a patient account service center operated by a wholly-owned affiliate of HCA Healthcare, Inc. The same patient accounts service center provides patient accounts receivable billing and collection processes for the hospitals owned and operated by University. With respect to the hospitals operated by University, the billing and collection processes conform to the requirements of IRC Section 501(r). Prior to joining University certain billing and collection processes that were used for Lakeview's patient accounts receivables did not conform to the billing and collection processes required by IRC Section 501(r) as the hospital was not required to meet those requirements. Upon Lakeview Hospital joining University, these certain billing and collection processes were inadvertently not updated to treat Lakeview similarly to hospitals being operated by University. Specifically, certain patient accounts were held by the patient account service center's collections department for approximately 60 days (instead of 120 days from the first billing statement) prior to being sent to primary collection agencies. Once at primary collection agencies, the patient accounts could have been reported to credit bureaus which is an extraordinary collection activity under 501(r) (""ECA""). A subsequent review indicated that approximately 197 patient accounts were reported to a credit bureau agency prior to 120 days from the first billing statement. This credit bureau reporting has been reversed. Additionally, certain accounts were not routed to receive verbal attempts or final notices at least 30 days prior to closing from the patient account service center's collections department. This process has been updated and patient accounts are receiving the verbal attempts before sending final notices of payment due. Additionally, the patient billing statements sent from the patient account service center did not contain language regarding the availability of financial assistance, the phone number for obtaining more information, or the URL for obtaining the Financial Assistance Policy, Financial Assistance Application or Plain Language Summary for Lakeview accounts as required by 501(r). This process issue has been corrected and the required information is being included on patients' billing statements. Any patient accounts that may have been adversely impacted by these issues have been corrected. """

The provision for doubtful accounts and the allowance for doubtful accounts relate primarily to amounts due directly from patients. An estimated allowance for doubtful accounts is recorded for all uninsured accounts, regardless of the aging of those accounts. Accounts are written off when all reasonable internal and external collections efforts have been performed. Our collection policies include a review of all accounts against certain standard collection criteria, upon completion of our internal collection efforts. Accounts determined to possess positive collectability attributes are forwarded to a secondary external collections agency and the other accounts are written off. The accounts that are not collected by the secondary external collection agency are written off when they are returned to us by the collection agency (usually within 12 months). Write-offs are based upon specific identification and the write-off process requires a write-off adjustment entry to the patient accounting system. We do not pursue collection of amounts related to patients that meet our guidelines to qualify as charity care.

Civic and social organizations, government agencies, educational systems, and health and human services entities were engaged throughout the CHNA. The comprehensive primary data collection phase resulted in the contribution of over 100 community stakeholders/leaders, organizations, and community groups. During the CHNA process, data was collected and analyzed individually for each of the three health facilities due to their distinct geographic regions. The primary data collection consisted of several project component pieces. Community stakeholder interviews were conducted with individuals who represented a) broad interests of the community, b) populations of need or c) persons with specialized knowledge in public health. Health provider surveys were collected to capture thoughts and opinions regarding health providers' community regarding the care and services they provide. Community representatives and stakeholders attended a community forum facilitated by Tripp Umbach to prioritize health needs, which will assist in the implementation and planning phase. A resource inventory was generated to highlight available programs and services within the service area. The resource inventory identifies available organizations and agencies that serve the region within each of the priority needs. A robust regional profile (secondary data profile) was analyzed. The regional profile contained local, state, and federal data/statistics providing invaluable information on a wide-array of health and social topics. Different socioeconomic characteristics, health outcomes, and health factors that affect residents' behaviors; specifically, the influential factors that impact the health of residents were reviewed and discussed with members of the Working Group and Tripp Umbach."

THE ORGANIZATION FEELS THAT MEDICARE UNDERPAYMENTS (SHORTFALL) AND BAD DEBT ARE COMMUNITY BENEFIT AND ASSOCIATED COSTS ARE INCLUDABLE ON THE FORM 990, SCHEDULE H, PART I. AS OUTLINED MORE FULLY BELOW THE ORGANIZATION BELIEVES THAT THESE SERVICES AND RELATED COSTS PROMOTE THE HEALTH OF THE COMMUNITY AS A WHOLE AND ARE RENDERED IN CONJUNCTION WITH THE ORGANIZATION'S CHARITABLE TAX-EXEMPT PURPOSES AND MISSION IN PROVIDING MEDICALLY NECESSARY HEALTHCARE SERVICES TO ALL INDIVIDUAL'S IN A NON-DISCRIMINATORY MANNER WITHOUT REGARD TO RACE, COLOR, CREED, SEX, NATIONAL ORIGIN OR ABILITY TO PAY AND CONSISTENT WITH THE COMMUNITY BENEFIT STANDARD PROMULGATED BY THE INTERNAL REVENUE SERVICE (""IRS""). THE COMMUNITY BENEFIT STANDARD IS THE CURRENT STANDARD FOR A HOSPITAL FOR RECOGNITION AS A TAX-EXEMPT AND CHARITABLE ORGANIZATION UNDER INTERNAL REVENUE CODE (""IRC"") 501(C)(3). THE ORGANIZATION IS RECOGNIZED AS A TAX-EXEMPT ENTITY AND CHARITABLE ORGANIZATION UNDER 501(C)(3) OF THE IRC. ALTHOUGH THERE IS NO DEFINITION IN THE TAX CODE FOR THE TERM ""CHARITABLE"", A REGULATION PROMULGATED BY THE DEPARTMENT OF THE TREASURY PROVIDES SOME GUIDANCE AND STATES THAT ""[T]HE TERM CHARITABLE IS USED IN 501(C)(3) IN ITS GENERALLY ACCEPTED LEGAL SENSE,PROVIDES EXAMPLES OF CHARITABLE PURPOSES, INCLUDING THE RELIEF OF THE POOR OR UNPRIVILEGED; THE PROMOTION OF SOCIAL WELFARE; AND THE ADVANCEMENT OF EDUCATION, RELIGION, AND SCIENCE. NOTE: IT DOES NOT EXPLICITLY ADDRESS THE ACTIVITIES OF HOSPITALS. IN THE ABSENCE OF EXPLICIT STATUTORY OR REGULATORY REQUIREMENTS APPLYING THE TERM ""CHARITABLE"" TO HOSPITALS, IT HAS BEEN LEFT TO THE IRS TO DETERMINE THE CRITERIA HOSPITALS MUST MEET TO QUALIFY AS IRC 501(C)(3) CHARITABLE ORGANIZATIONS. THE ORIGINAL STANDARD WAS KNOWN AS THE CHARITY CARE STANDARD. THIS STANDARD WAS REPLACED BY THE IRS WITH THE COMMUNITY BENEFIT STANDARD WHICH IS THE CURRENT STANDARD. CHARITY CARE STANDARD IN 1956, THE IRS ISSUED REVENUE RULING 56-185, WHICH ADDRESSED THE REQUIREMENTS HOSPITALS NEEDED TO MEET IN ORDER TO QUALIFY FOR IRC 501(C)(3) STATUS. ONE OF THESE REQUIREMENTS IS KNOWN AS THE ""CHARITY CARE STANDARD."" UNDER THE STANDARD, A HOSPITAL HAD TO PROVIDE, TO THE EXTENT OF ITS FINANCIAL ABILITY, FREE OR REDUCED-COST CARE TO PATIENTS UNABLE TO PAY FOR IT. A HOSPITAL THAT EXPECTED FULL PAYMENT DID NOT, ACCORDING TO THE RULING, PROVIDE CHARITY CARE BASED ON THE FACT THAT SOME PATIENTS ULTIMATELY FAILED TO PAY. THE RULING EMPHASIZED THAT A LOW LEVEL OF CHARITY CARE DID NOT NECESSARILY MEAN THAT A HOSPITAL HAD FAILED TO MEET THE REQUIREMENT SINCE THAT LEVEL COULD REFLECT ITS FINANCIAL ABILITY TO PROVIDE SUCH CARE. THE RULING ALSO NOTED THAT PUBLICLY SUPPORTED COMMUNITY HOSPITALS WOULD NORMALLY QUALIFY AS CHARITABLE ORGANIZATIONS BECAUSE THEY SERVE THE ENTIRE COMMUNITY AND A LOW LEVEL OF CHARITY CARE WOULD NOT AFFECT A HOSPITAL'S EXEMPT STATUS IF IT WAS DUE TO THE SURROUNDING COMMUNITY'S LACK OF CHARITABLE DEMANDS. COMMUNITY BENEFIT STANDARD IN 1969, THE IRS ISSUED REVENUE RULING 69-545, WHICH ""REMOVE[D]"" FROM REVENUE RULING 56-185 ""THE REQUIREMENTS RELATING TO CARING FOR PATIENTS WITHOUT CHARGE OR AT RATES BELOW COST."" UNDER THE STANDARD DEVELOPED IN REVENUE RULING 69-545, WHICH IS KNOWN AS THE ""COMMUNITY BENEFIT STANDARD,"" HOSPITALS ARE JUDGED ON WHETHER THEY PROMOTE THE HEALTH OF A BROAD CLASS OF INDIVIDUALS IN THE COMMUNITY. THE RULING INVOLVED A HOSPITAL THAT ONLY ADMITTED INDIVIDUALS WHO COULD PAY FOR THE SERVICES (BY THEMSELVES, PRIVATE INSURANCE, OR PUBLIC PROGRAMS SUCH AS MEDICARE), BUT OPERATED A FULL-TIME EMERGENCY ROOM THAT WAS OPEN TO EVERYONE. THE IRS RULED THAT THE HOSPITAL QUALIFIED AS A CHARITABLE ORGANIZATION BECAUSE IT PROMOTED THE HEALTH OF PEOPLE IN ITS COMMUNITY. THE IRS REASONED THAT BECAUSE THE PROMOTION OF HEALTH WAS A CHARITABLE PURPOSE ACCORDING TO THE GENERAL LAW OF CHARITY, IT FELL WITHIN THE ""GENERALLY ACCEPTED LEGAL SENSE"" OF THE TERM ""CHARITABLE,"" AS REQUIRED BY TREAS. REG. 1.501(C)(3)-1(D)(2). THE IRS RULING STATED THAT THE PROMOTION OF HEALTH, LIKE THE RELIEF OF POVERTY AND THE ADVANCEMENT OF EDUCATION AND RELIGION, IS ONE OF THE PURPOSES IN THE GENERAL LAW OF CHARITY THAT IS DEEMED BENEFICIAL TO THE COMMUNITY AS A WHOLE EVEN THOUGH THE CLASS OF BENEFICIARIES ELIGIBLE TO RECEIVE A DIRECT BENEFIT FROM ITS ACTIVITIES DOES NOT INCLUDE ALL MEMBERS OF THE COMMUNITY, SUCH AS INDIGENT MEMBERS OF THE COMMUNITY, PROVIDED THAT THE CLASS IS NOT SO SMALL THAT ITS RELIEF IS NOT OF BENEFIT TO THE COMMUNITY. THE IRS CONCLUDED THAT THE HOSPITAL WAS ""PROMOTING THE HEALTH OF A CLASS OF PERSONS THAT IS BROAD ENOUGH TO BENEFIT THE COMMUNITY"" BECAUSE ITS EMERGENCY ROOM WAS OPEN TO ALL AND IT PROVIDED CARE TO EVERYONE WHO COULD PAY, WHETHER DIRECTLY OR THROUGH THIRD-PARTY REIMBURSEMENT. OTHER CHARACTERISTICS OF THE HOSPITAL THAT THE IRS HIGHLIGHTED INCLUDED THE FOLLOWING: ITS SURPLUS FUNDS WERE USED TO IMPROVE PATIENT CARE, EXPAND HOSPITAL FACILITIES, AND ADVANCE MEDICAL TRAINING, EDUCATION, AND RESEARCH; IT WAS CONTROLLED BY A BOARD OF TRUSTEES THAT CONSISTED OF INDEPENDENT CIVIC LEADERS; AND HOSPITAL MEDICAL STAFF PRIVILEGES WERE AVAILABLE TO ALL QUALIFIED PHYSICIANS. THE AMERICAN HOSPITAL ASSOCIATION (""AHA"") FEELS THAT MEDICARE UNDERPAYMENTS (SHORTFALL) AND BAD DEBT ARE COMMUNITY BENEFIT AND THUS INCLUDABLE ON THE FORM 990, SCHEDULE H, PART I. THIS ORGANIZATION AGREES WITH THE AHA POSITION. AS OUTLINED IN THE AHA LETTER TO THE IRS DATED AUGUST 21, 2007 WITH RESPECT TO THE FIRST PUBLISHED DRAFT OF THE NEW FORM 990 AND SCHEDULE H, THE AHA FELT THAT THE IRS SHOULD INCORPORATE THE FULL VALUE OF THE COMMUNITY BENEFIT THAT HOSPITALS PROVIDE BY COUNTING MEDICARE UNDERPAYMENTS (SHORTFALL) AND BAD DEBT AS QUANTIFIABLE COMMUNITY BENEFIT FOR THE FOLLOWING REASONS: - PROVIDING CARE FOR THE ELDERLY AND SERVING MEDICARE PATIENTS IS AN ESSENTIAL PART OF THE COMMUNITY BENEFIT STANDARD. - MEDICARE, LIKE MEDICAID, DOES NOT PAY THE FULL COST OF CARE. RECENTLY, MEDICARE REIMBURSES HOSPITALS ONLY 92 CENTS FOR EVERY DOLLAR THEY SPEND TO TAKE CARE OF MEDICARE PATIENTS. THE MEDICARE PAYMENT ADVISORY COMMISSION (""MEDPAC"") IN ITS MARCH 2007 REPORT TO CONGRESS CAUTIONED THAT UNDERPAYMENT WILL GET EVEN WORSE, WITH MARGINS REACHING A 10-YEAR LOW AT NEGATIVE 5.4 PERCENT. - MANY MEDICARE BENEFICIARIES, LIKE THEIR MEDICAID COUNTERPARTS, ARE POOR. MORE THAN 46 PERCENT OF MEDICARE SPENDING IS FOR BENEFICIARIES WHOSE INCOME IS BELOW 200 PERCENT OF THE FEDERAL POVERTY LEVEL. MANY OF THOSE MEDICARE BENEFICIARIES ARE ALSO ELIGIBLE FOR MEDICAID -- SO CALLED ELIGIBLES"". THERE IS EVERY COMPELLING PUBLIC POLICY REASON TO TREAT MEDICARE AND MEDICAID UNDERPAYMENTS SIMILARLY FOR PURPOSES OF A HOSPITAL'S COMMUNITY BENEFIT AND INCLUDE THESE COSTS ON FORM 990, SCHEDULE H, PART I. MEDICARE UNDERPAYMENT MUST BE SHOULDERED BY THE HOSPITAL IN ORDER TO CONTINUE TREATING THE COMMUNITY'S ELDERLY AND POOR. THESE UNDERPAYMENTS REPRESENT A REAL COST OF SERVING THE COMMUNITY AND SHOULD COUNT AS A QUANTIFIABLE COMMUNITY BENEFIT. BOTH THE AHA AND THIS ORGANIZATION ALSO FEEL THAT PATIENT BAD DEBT IS A COMMUNITY BENEFIT AND THUS INCLUDABLE ON THE FORM 990, SCHEDULE H, PART I. THERE ARE COMPELLING REASONS THAT PATIENT BAD DEBT SHOULD BE COUNTED AS QUANTIFIABLE COMMUNITY BENEFIT AS FOLLOWS: - A SIGNIFICANT MAJORITY OF BAD DEBT IS ATTRIBUTABLE TO LOW-INCOME PATIENTS, WHO, FOR MANY REASONS, DECLINE TO COMPLETE THE FORMS REQUIRED TO ESTABLISH ELIGIBILITY FOR HOSPITALS' CHARITY CARE OR FINANCIAL ASSISTANCE PROGRAMS. A 2006 CONGRESSIONAL BUDGET OFFICE (""CBO"") REPORT, NONPROFIT HOSPITALS AND THE PROVISION OF COMMUNITY BENEFITS, CITED TWO STUDIES INDICATING THAT ""THE GREAT MAJORITY OF BAD DEBT WAS ATTRIBUTABLE TO PATIENTS WITH INCOMES BELOW 200% OF THE FEDERAL POVERTY LINE"". - THE REPORT ALSO NOTED THAT A SUBSTANTIAL PORTION OF BAD DEBT IS PENDING CHARITY CARE. UNLIKE BAD DEBT IN OTHER INDUSTRIES, HOSPITAL BAD DEBT IS COMPLICATED BY THE FACT THAT HOSPITALS FOLLOW THEIR MISSION TO THE COMMUNITY AND TREAT EVERY PATIENT THAT COMES THROUGH THEIR EMERGENCY DEPARTMENT, REGARDLESS OF ABILITY TO PAY. PATIENTS WHO HAVE OUTSTANDING BILLS ARE NOT TURNED AWAY, UNLIKE OTHER INDUSTRIES. BAD DEBT IS FURTHER COMPLICATED BY THE AUDITING INDUSTRY'S STANDARDS ON REPORTING CHARITY CARE. MANY PATIENTS CANNOT OR DO NOT PROVIDE THE NECESSARY, EXTENSIVE DOCUMENTATION REQUIRED TO BE DEEMED CHARITY CARE BY AUDITORS. AS A RESULT, ROUGHLY 10% OF BAD DEBT IS PENDING CHARITY CARE. - THE CBO CONCLUDED THAT ITS FINDINGS ""SUPPORT THE VALIDITY OF THE USE OF UNCOMPENSATED CARE [BAD DEBT AND CHARITY CARE] AS A MEASURE OF COMMUNITY BENEFITS"" ASSUMING THE FINDINGS ARE GENERALIZABLE NATIONWIDE; THE EXPERIENCE OF HOSPITALS AROUND THE NATION REINFORCES THAT THEY ARE GENERALIZABLE. AS OUTLINED BY THE AHA, DESPITE THE HOSPITAL'S BEST EFFORTS AND DUE DILIGENCE, PATIENT BAD DEBT IS A PART OF THE HOSPITAL'S MISSION AND CHARITABLE PURPOSES. BAD DEBT REPRESENTS"

The hospitals FY18 CHNA and three-year Implementation Strategies were endorsed by MHHs Board of Directors and approved by the MedStar Health Board of Directors. The document became available on the hospitals website on June 30, 2018. During FY19, key revisions were made across MedStar Health to more effectively impact the communities served throughout Maryland and Washington, DC. Several internal meetings were convened with leadership from each MedStar Health Hospital to review current practices and strategies. As a result of these meetings, the approach to the current CHNA for the remainder of the three-year cycle (FY19-FY21) was revised. A key revision to the CHNA is a greater focus on hospital area strategies that are most appropriate for the local communities served. The number of strategies each hospital is accountable for executing was reduced to encourage more meaningful reach within key areas contrasted with broader reach with reduced impact. Using the standard categories, Health and Wellness, Access to Care and Social Determinants of Health to determine what to prioritize for the CHNA IRS requirements, each hospital agreed to select two to three strategies as priorities that have size and scale impact and measurable outcomes. All other programming was integrated as part of the hospitals overall community health portfolio. These additional programs were captured in the inventory for the whole picture of contributing to the health of the communities served as well as sorted for what counts as community benefit for regulatory reporting. The hospitals Community Benefit Service Area (CBSA) remains the same, based on the Advisory Task Force (ATF) recommendation. The hospital identified Southern Baltimore City and Northern Anne Arundel County as its CBSA, which includes all residents living in ZIP code 21225. The hospital selected this geographic area based on hospital utilization data and secondary public health data as well as its proximity to the hospital. The ATF included a diverse group of individuals, including hospital leaders, grassroots activists, community residents, faith-based leaders, hospital representatives, public health leaders and other stakeholder organizations, such as representatives from local health departments. MHHs health priorities for the CBSA include health and wellness (chronic disease prevention and management, behavioral health) and social determinants of health (social needs screenings, Baltimore JOBS). As a proud member of MedStar Health, representatives from MHH routinely participate in the MedStar Health community health workgroup. The workgroup is comprised of community health professionals who represent all ten MedStar hospitals. The team analyzes local and regional community health data, establishes system-wide community health programming performance and evaluation measures and shares best practices."
202001929349302180,520491660,PATIENT EDUCATION OF ELIGIBILITY FOR ASSISTANCE,"PART VI, LINE 3 As one of the regions leading not-for-profit healthcare systems, MedStar Health is committed to ensuring that uninsured patients and underinsured patients meeting medical hardship criteria within the communities we serve who lack financial resources have access to emergency and medically necessary hospital services. MedStar Health and its healthcare facilities will: . Treat all patients equitably, with dignity, respect, and compassion; .

In meeting its commitments, MedStar Healths facilities will work with their uninsured patients seeking emergency and medically necessary care to gain an understanding of each patients financial resources. Based on this information and eligibility determination, MedStar Health facilities will provide financial assistance to uninsured patients who reside within the communities we serve in one or more of the following ways: .

MedStar Health believes that its patients have personal responsibilities related to the financial aspects of their healthcare needs. Financial assistance and periodic payment plans available under this policy will not be available to those patients who fail to fulfill their responsibilities. For purposes of this policy, patient responsibilities include: .

202001929349302180,520491660,COMMUNITY INFORMATION,"PART VI, LINE 4 Geographic: MHHs CBSA includes all residents of ZIP code 21225, the hospitals home ZIP code. The CBSA spans southern Baltimore City and northern Anne Arundel County, and includes four neighborhoods: Brooklyn, Brooklyn Park, Cherry Hill and Pumphrey. In particular, the hospital will focus on the Cherry Hill community. This area was selected due to its very high poverty rate and its proximity to the hospital, as well as the opportunity to build on pre-existing programs, services, and partnerships. Demographics: Cherry Hill is historically a Black/African American neighborhood, with roots going back to the 17th century. After World War II, more than 600 housing units were built there by the United States War Housing Administration, specifically for African American war workers. Shortly after the war, these units were made into low-income housing. Additional low-income housing units have been added throughout the years, making Cherry Hill one of the largest housing projects east of Chicago. 90.3% of Cherry Hill residents are Black/African American. 60.3% of Cherry Hill residents age 25 years and older have a high school education or less. The median household income for Cherry Hill in is $22,659, compared to $37,992 for the entire CBSA and approximately 57.2% of Cherry Hill families live in poverty. In terms of health care, the Cherry Hill community houses MHH, as well as a local branch of the Family Health Centers of Baltimore, which is a Federally Qualified Health Center (FQHC) providing health care services on a sliding fee scale. In addition, Baltimore City Health Department programs operate city-wide and various mobile services - such as a needle exchange program, violence prevention, maternal and infant nursing, lead poisoning and abatement programs and others - in the Cherry Hill area. According to the Cherry Hill Health Profile, the life expectancy at birth of a Cherry Hill resident is 69.5, compared to 73.6 in Baltimore City. The all-cause mortality rate In Cherry Hill is 124.6; the all-cause mortality rate in Baltimore City is 99.5. High rates of type 2 diabetes and heart disease, including stroke, occur in this community. For a variety of reasons, including the high poverty rate and low rate of health care insurance coverage, many Cherry Hill residents often use the MedStar Harbor Hospital emergency department for primary care services. Despite the convenient neighborhood location of a FQHC, many residents do not utilize a primary care physician. Typically, a chronic condition, such as diabetes or heart disease, presents severe enough symptoms to warrant a trip to the emergency department. In many cases, several co-morbidities are found to be present at this time. Without primary care follow-up, however, these conditions usually cannot be addressed fully in the time allotted for the emergent issue. In other cases, patients may have symptoms of a much less serious illness - a simple cold, for example - but since they do not have a primary health care provider, they also visit the emergency department for these ailments. As a result, many of their most basic health needs often are not met."
202001929349302180,520491660,PROMOTION OF COMMUNITY HEALTH,"PART VI, LINE 5 As a community partner, MHH engages in a number of community benefit activities to improve and promote the health and wellbeing of the community. Priority areas of focus, as determined by the 2018 CHNA, are Health and Wellness, Access to Care and Services, and Social Determinants of Health. One priority area is addressing access to behavioral health services, including mental health and substance use. In FY19, 41,572 patients were screened for substance use in the emergency department through MedStars SBIRT program (Screening, Brief Intervention and Referral to Treatment). Peer Recovery Coaches are integral to hospital care teams to assist with improving access to substance use treatment and social service linkages and support community education efforts. Through the Opioid Survivor Outreach Program (OSOP)peer recovery coaches are sent in the field to see recent overdose survivors and link them to treatment services, naloxone trainings and provide consistent point of contact should someone wish to enter care. As additional efforts to address access to behavioral health resources, in partnership with community organizations such as Baltimore City Health Department, Mosaic Community Services and National Alliance on Mental Illness - Baltimore (NAMI), the hospital offers no cost education courses on mental health awareness and naloxone administration. MHH addresses health and wellness by offering a variety of programs and resources that seek to address chronic disease prevention and management. MHH serves as a hub to screen individuals for cancer. In FY19, 939 breast and cervical cancer screenings and 205 colon cancer screenings were conducted across all three MedStar Baltimore City hospitals with the majority conducted at MHH. A unique aspect of this program is that it provides screening to individuals without insurance and/or documentation. As a result, more than 55% of people served are Hispanic/Latino. MHHs community-based education courses are offered to support healthy lifestyle changes for community members. Programs include Living Well Chronic Disease Self-Management Program, Centers for Disease Control Diabetes Prevention and Smoking Cessation. Additionally, the hospital actively participates in providing health education at events across its CBSA. MHHs other priority is addressing the social determinants of health of the community. Community residents surrounding the hospital have been trained and hired as either a community health advocate or peer recovery coach as part of the Population Health Workforce Development program. These positions serve as a way to empower individuals and their families into better economic conditions. As part of their responsibilities, the community health advocate roles conduct social needs screenings and support linkages to social need services as part of care delivery and chronic disease self-management programming. 436 social needs screens were completed and 317 were connected to social services/resources within the community."

Communities are identified, strategies are identified and plans are funded, implemented, tracked and measure. Our Board approves the plan and reviews plan progress annually. Because of the size and scope of our services, the approach we use to identify our key communities is based on the strategy, key stakeholders needs, and our capacity. Our community for the KCCHI work groups is Kanawha County as determined by the KCCHI mission. For our CAMC community strategy, community is based on the need identified and population to be addressed. We develop Health Indicator Data Sheets for each of our service area counties and identify key issues to address for all or part of our service area. For example, our Perinatal Telemedicine Project includes 14 rural counties and our Child Advocacy Center and HIV program serve our entire service area. Each strategy is deployed through a planning process that addresses key stakeholder needs and is evaluated based on predetermined criteria for outcomes expected. Cycles of learning have ensured the Civic Affairs Council monetary contributions support community organizations in the service area that are clearly aligned with our community strategy. In addition to addressing community needs and contributing financially, our leadership team serves in key leadership roles for community activities, programs and organizations as well as supports the workforce in participating in many community benefit activities such as Day of Caring and HealthFest.

This reduces the bad debt expense of $36,635,277 to cost of $12,460,715. Due to the process that Rush and other hospitals must facilitate to prove a patient's eligibility for discounted or free care, the precise amount of charity care often can be indistinguishable from other categories of uncompensated care. Without the cooperation of the patient in providing appropriate documentation, Rush cannot correctly distinguish patients who meet the defined charity care policies and appropriately categorize those individuals as charity care write-offs. Instead these patient cases can be classified as bad debt write-offs due to a lack of support information. This can create a situation in which patient scan be mistakenly classified as bad debt that could actually be classified as charity care, but cannot be confirmed.

The maintenance of this service for our patients has a significant impact on decreasing the amount of charity care provided and ensuring that patients have the opportunity to obtain insurance. In addition to achieving appropriate, available coverage for our patients' medical services, this eligibility service also obtains eligibility for SSI or SSA benefits for applicable patients. Guiding the patient through this often time-consuming and arduous process is extremely beneficial to the patient, as once SSI/SSA eligibility is approved, the patient will begin receiving a monthly assistance check which provided a benefit well beyond their health care at RUMC.To assist the patient in deciding which is the right program for them, RUMC offers the services of Financial Counselors and Billing Customer Service Representatives.

Since 1990, thousands of students from pre-kindergarten to college have participated in science and math enrichment learning experiences. The REACH model provides these offerings and integrates them into a cradle-to-career pathway with a mission of increasing diversity in STEM/health care professions. Our overall goals are to increase high school graduation rates, college matriculation, interest in healthcare/STEM careers; and to build skills for the 21st-century workforce, including communication, collaboration, critical thinking, creativity, and leadership. Through enrichment, engagement, skills training and high-quality work-based learning, Rush is preparing underrepresented youth for success in the healthcare industry. Rush's dedication to promoting a healthy community has fostered a strong commitment to supporting the growth and development of our local neighborhoods; including school communities. In FY18, REACH deepened its collaboration with five partner elementary schools and four high schools with STEM and/or healthcare programs. Rush University Medical Center is uniquely situated to increase the diversity of the healthcare workforce; addressing educational opportunity gaps, and cultivating a pipeline of health professionals focused on reducing health disparities for west side neighborhoods. REACH provides programming across the pre-K-16 educational continuum through the initiatives highlighted below:Elementary Outreach (Gr. Pre-K-5)In 1998, REACH developed its preschool program to introduce preschool children to science, math, and literacy skills. REACH later expanded to include primary grades and currently provides education outreach in 6 public and private schools. The goal of the REACH Elementary Initiative is to provide a stimulating environment for the development of science, math, and literacy skills by providing science /STEM labs and materials appropriate for young children. REACH works with educators to facilitate understanding of fundamental science and math concepts and support student development of inquiry skills by using their natural curiosity to explore their surroundings. In addition to academic enrichment, Rush exposes students and their families to a variety of STEM/healthcare career pathways to inspire future career plans. REACH believes that early parental involvement is crucial for children to be successful in school and supportive in planning for college and career success. In FY19, 1038 students, 50 teachers and 300 parents participated in this program.Middle School Outreach (Gr. 6-8th)In FY19, REACH launched two new programs targeted for 6th-8th grade students. Vitals for STEM Success is an after-school curriculum enrichment program for middle school students interested in STEM and health care careers. The program consists of three, 10-week sessions on the Rush campus. In addition to STEM learning experiences, the enrichment program includes career exploration, mentoring and tutoring. Future Ready Learning Lab, supported in part by Michael Reese Health Trust, is an enrichment elective focused on building interest and awareness of careers in the STEM/healthcare field, increasing sense of self-efficacy, developing 21st century learning skills and transitioning to high school. The elective is incorporated into the school day and include opportunities for parent and community engagement. The partner schools for this program are Nathaniel Dett Elementary and Washington Irving Elementary Schools.High School Outreach (Gr. 9-12)REACH's programs for grades 9 through 12 include academic, college and career development. Initiatives include specialized courses, site visits, job shadowing and summer internships at Rush that expose students to a wide range of health care careers. REACH also supports dual-credit enrollment opportunities, help student's complete college applications, provide mentoring and more. In FY19, REACH provided intensive experiences for 350 high school students.During the summer of 2019, Rush provided work-based learning experiences for over 200 youth across the campus. Ninety percent of participating high school students also earned industry-recognized certifications in Cardiopulmonary resuscitation, Electrocardiography, and/or First Aid. MedSTEM Pathways, our signature high school program, is designed to introduce teens to a wide range of clinical and non-clinical healthcare careers, develop leadership skills and build academic skills. MedSTEM Pathways provides pre-internships for rising sophomores, juniors, and internships for rising juniors and seniors. By leveraging resources from across Rush University Medical Center, we provided students with comprehensive, engaging experiences including personal development workshops, industry-recognized certifications, and networking with career professionals.In addition, with a generous grant from JP Morgan Chase, Rush completed a pilot of its Health IT program at Richard T. Crane Medical Preparatory High School (Crane). Rush ultimately served 44 students and saw 20 students complete their EPIC Cadence Certification over the summer. The Health IT program expanded to year-round programming and will include the creation of a playbook for replication across the city. College (2yr-4yr)Highly motivated college students can participate in a variety of postsecondary opportunities geared towards workforce development and academic research experiences. In preparation for Summer 2019, we will refine and expand the career pathway opportunities for the College Workforce Development Program; offering paid internships and other resources to help students move quickly into full-time, living-wage employment after graduation.

The partnership includes hosting students' clinical rotations in nursing, surgical technology, radiologic technology, EMT/paramedic, and respiratory care at Rush University Hospital and providing anatomy labs for MXC health occupations students. Rush also provides guest lecturers and recently began offering a monthly interprofessional lunch and learn series for MXC students and faculty. MXC wants to ensure that its graduates have the knowledge, skills and professional attributes they will need to function in the healthcare system, both now and in the future. To help achieve that goal, Rush participates in MXC advisory committees and provides transfer programs for graduates of the MXC radiologic technology and respiratory care programs to allow students the opportunity to obtain a bachelor's degree in their fields.Mini Medical School The RCSIP Mini Medical School is a ten-week program that runs from late September to mid-March for students in fourth and fifth grade, from Chicago Public Schools on Chicago's West Side. The main objective of the program is to expose young students to the health sciences. This program is held at Rush University and includes an orientation, anatomy and physiology lectures, activities on the five major body systems, dissections, homework, and a completion celebration. Rush student and physician volunteers plan the curriculum, implement activities, and assist the youth during these sessions. This year, approximately 117 grade school students attended Mini Medical School.Goal 2: Improve access to mental and behavioral health services Supporting Program Information:Rush School-Based Health Centers Rush has a 30-year history of providing health care at School-Based Health Centers (SBHC). Rush currently has three SBHCs located within Chicago Public Schools that include, Orr Academy High School, Richard T. Crane Medical Preparatory High School, and Simpson Academy for Young Women. Crane and Orr have students in grades 9-12 and Simpson is for girls in grades six to 12 that are pregnant, parenting, or both. All three schools have student bodies from underserved populations, and are located in neighborhoods with high poverty levels and hardship.The Rush SBHC's act as safety nets for these vulnerable students. Wide-ranging clinic services are provided by advanced practice nurses, registered nurses, collaborating physicians and large numbers of Rush's inter-professional students. The services include physicals, immunizations, treatment of injuries, primary care, intermittent care, mental health services, prenatal care, pregnancy prevention programs, heath education programs and health care for the children of the students. Outcomes of this health care and education collaboration include improved immunization rates, decreased incidence of infectious disease, decreased emergency room usage, detecting and treating illness, healthy baby deliveries, increased access to mental health services, success in pregnancy prevention programs, and students establishing healthy living patterns aimed at chronic disease prevention and improved graduation rates. In FY19, 876 risk screenings were completed, resulting in 175 referrals for additional mental health services. Of those 175, 100 were successfully linked to care. Among the 100 are three pregnant teens who have been referred to home visiting services through the ACEs in Pregnancy program. Through a partnership with the Rush Department of Psychiatry, psychiatric services, provided both in-SBHC and by telehealth visits, launched in January 2018. During FY19, there were 49 students referred for SBHC-provided psychiatric care. One thousand seven hundred forty minutes of education that focused on trauma, mental health, and skill building for resilience was provided to 900 students through school outreach activities. Finally, 140 teachers, parents, staff, and community members' participated educational sessions on the same topics. Adolescent Family Center The Rush Adolescent Family Center (AFC) has existed for over forty years. The AFC provides reproductive healthcare, prenatal care, gynecological care, pregnancy prevention programs, sexually transmitted infection (STI) testing and treatment, and community health education to underserved Chicago-area youth. All of AFC's services are provided regardless of income or ability to pay for care. Although AFC draws patients from over 107 Chicago-area zip codes, the majority of patients served reside in the Chicago West Side communities of East Garfield Park, West Garfield Park, North Lawndale, Austin, Humboldt Park and the Near West Side. As part of AFC's community education program, staffs regularly travel off-site to Chicago-area high schools and middle schools to provide community education on pregnancy prevention, reproductive anatomy, contraception, sexually transmitted infection prevention and reproductive health. AFC also offers free prenatal education classes to pregnant teens and their partners. In FY19, AFC provided clinic services to 493 youth - in total 2,006 healthcare encounters - and provided 1,380 minutes of reproductive health education to youth at 4 different schools through community education encounters.The Road Home Program at the Center for Veterans and Their Families at Rush The Road Home Program provides care for the ""invisible wounds of war"" for veterans and their families. Services for veterans deployed in Iraq and Afghanistan include: an adult mental health clinic that specializes in post-traumatic stress disorder; child and family services such as support groups, counseling and guidance for parenting; traumatic brain injury clinic; a military sexual trauma clinic; and an Intensive Outpatient Program (IOP). The IOP is a three-week program where veterans locally, and from all around the country fly in to receive intensive treatment Monday thru Friday, 8:00am to 4:00pm. This past year the Road Home Program conducted veteran outreach to 6,901 people within the community (to veterans and their family members, and through veteran service organizations and related community groups). This past year the Road Home Program provided clinical services to 936 veterans.College of Nursing Faculty Practice ProgramThe College of Nursing (CON) has a 30-year history of providing healthcare services to underserved individuals, families, and communities at a variety of diverse community practice sites through the CON Faculty Practice Program. These sites are deployed where individuals live, learn and work and include a wellness and health program for the Children's School at the Lighthouse for the Blind, a women's health clinic, a case management program for chronic medical and mental illness, a work-place health clinic for the working poor and nurse practitioner led primary healthcare sites. Most recipients of care at the faculty practice sites are uninsured or underinsured and rely on the sites as their main healthcare source. In addition to the hours of care provided by Rush CON faculty practitioners, Rush nursing students deliver healthcare and health education services at the various sites. The students' efforts greatly enhance the volume of health services provided. In addition, Rush University nursing, medical, physician assistant and health systems management students volunteer at these sites developing and delivering health education programs. Nearly two-thousand health encounters are provided per year through the CON Faculty Practice Program."
202001979349303330,362174823,"Part VI, Line 5 Continued","Goal 3: Prevent and reduce chronic disease by focusing on risk factors 5 + 1 = 20 5 + 1 = 20 is a Rush Community Service Initiatives Program (RCSIP) that aims to educate high school students at Chicago Public Schools on the five diseases prevalent in the surrounding underserved community (asthma, hypertension, HIV, diabetes, and cancer). 5 + 1 = 20 is based on the idea that knowledge of these 5 common conditions plus 1 informed high school student (or person) can extend one's life by 20 years (individuals without health insurance have a life expectancy of 20 years less than the general US population). Twice a month, Rush student volunteers teach a health topic related to the five diseases to high school students. The content of the interactive health lectures ranges from disease prevention to practical skills such checking blood pressure. The high school students have opportunities to spread their knowledge through 5 + 1 = 20 health fairs at their schools. Health fair activities include body mass index calculations, blood pressure screenings, vision screenings, glucose level checks, referrals, and health education. Health fair participants include families and friends of the students as well as other members of their communities. This past year, 5 + 1 = 20 provided health education and screenings to approximately 3,540 community members.Mini Health Fairs Rush's Professional Nursing staff helps provide Mini Health Fairs for patients receiving care at Thresholds, an organization that provides services to individuals with chronic mental illness. The Mini Health Fairs provide health education and screenings. This is important since those living with chronic mental illness have a lifespan that is 25 years less than the general population related to chronic medical diseases. This past year, PNS provided health education and screenings to approximately 75 community members.Oak Park Hospital Health & Wellness FairIn FY19 the annual ROPH health and wellness fair provided more than 366 health screenings to participants which include blood pressure, fasting glucose and lipid profile blood tests. Many departments participated by hosting health information booths. These booths were staffed with clinicians who were provided information on diabetes, stroke, cancer, weight management, breast imaging and more. In addition, primary care doctors from Rush Oak Park Physicians Group were on hand to answer health related questions. A healthy breakfast was provided to attendees. Project Lifestyle ChangeFor the sixth consecutive year, ROPH's Project Lifestyle Change, a group education and support program that informs on pre-diabetes health, continued to make an impact in the community. The program teaches blood glucose monitoring, restricted fat and calorie meal planning, exercise and behavior modification at no charge.Rush Department of Social Work and Community Health The health promotion/disease prevention focus of the Rush Department of Social Work and Community Health (SWACH) provides patients, their families, and community members access to an array of programs that provide support and promote wellness through educational programs, physical activity classes, support groups and workshops. Rush Generations, a free health affinity membership program of approximately 15,500 members, offers older adults and their caregivers the opportunity to benefit from health and wellness educational programs. Rush Generations offers its members a free quarterly newsletter, monthly e-newsletter, access to community health fairs and screenings, and opportunities to become more active and engaged by joining the Generations volunteer ambassador program. Transitional care to support patients and caregivers after hospital stays using the Bridge Model, addressing medical and non-medical issues as part of an interprofessional care team. Outpatient social work care management with social workers integrated into primary and specialty care to assess and address psychosocial issues related to care, using the AIMS Model. Mental health and collaborative care, including psychotherapy, supportive services, and coordination with primary care to support patients 12+ years old who screen positively for depression.SWACH operates the Anne Bryon Waud Resource Center and the Tower Resource Center (TRC), which are both open daily to the public. Each center is staffed by a licensed clinical social worker who is available to help with a myriad of issues related to health and chronic health issues that particularly impact adults and caregivers. The Senior Health Insurance Program (SHIP), which provides free options counseling to assist with navigation of Medicare and related benefit. SWACH is also leading the Social Determinants of Health initiative, which identifies, measures, and mitigates the social determinants of health of patients and community members by offering closed-loop referrals to services and resources to alleviate health disparities, as previously mentioned.Tour de West Side Started by a Rush medical student's Summer Dean's Project, Rush began to sponsor five 5Ks on the West Side given its commitment to improving health. This idea was well received, with a committee meeting occurring on a monthly basis and an aim to encourage employees and students to sign up for the annual neighborhood 5Ks in Garfield Park, Austin, North Lawndale, Pilsen, and Little Village. Rush subsidized the cost of participation for 200 employees. West Side Walk to WellnessThe West Side Walk to Wellness, another student's Summer Dean's Project, was developed to enhance exercise and walking in our West Side communities, create a sense of engagement, and level of safety to be outside in the community. The program which lasted 8 weeks, engaged 250 unique community members from Rush and the communities we serve.Goal 4: Increase access to care and community servicesRCSIP Clinics RCSIP Clinics are run by Rush volunteers, more specifically a physician lead and an interprofessional team of Rush student volunteers. The clinics offer various services to patients such as physical exams, health education, free basic medications, and procedures such as wound care and use referrals to help patients establish primary and/or specialty care relationships that are affordable or available through charity care. Examples of these clinics include:1.RCSIP Clinic at Franciscan Outreach is located within the Franciscan House homeless shelter for adult men and women. Over 2,951 healthcare encounters/visits were provided during FY19.2.RCSIP Clinic at Freedom Center serves adult males that are in rehabilitation for substance abuse issues. The clinic is housed within the Salvation Army's Harbor Light Center and provided healthcare to over 225 men during FY19. 3.RCSIP Clinic at Chicago City Church serves homeless and other at-risk adults. Over 140 patients were seen at this clinic during FY19."

THE ORGANIZATIONS FINANCIAL ASSISTANCE POLICY (""FAP"") EXISTS TO OFFER FINANCIAL ASSISTANCE FOR MEDICALLY NECESSARY CARE TO BOTH UNINSURED AND UNDER-INSURED INDIVIDUALS BASED UPON THEIR ABILITY TO PAY. THE GRANTING OF FINANCIAL ASSISTANCE WILL NOT TAKE INTO ACCOUNT AGE, GENDER, RACE, SOCIAL STATUS, SEXUAL ORIENTATION OR RELIGIOUS AFFILIATION. PATIENTS SEEKING EMERGENCY CARE SHALL BE TREATED WITHOUT REGARD TO ABILITY TO PAY FOR SUCH CARE. AS REFLECTED IN SCHEDULE H, PART V, SECTION B, QUESTION 13, IN ADDITION TO FEDERAL POVERTY GUIDELINES (""FPG"") AMH USES THE FOLLOWING CRITERIA WHEN DETERMINING A PATIENTS ELIGIBILITY FOR FREE OR DISCOUNTED FINANCIAL ASSISTANCE: - ASSET LEVEL; - MEDICAL INDIGENCY; - INSURANCE STATUS; - UNDERINSURANCE STATUS; AND - RESIDENCY. IN ACCORDANCE WITH THE ORGANIZATIONS FAP, A PATIENT MAY QUALIFY FOR DISCOUNTS ON MEDICAL CARE IF THERE IS NO HEALTH INSURANCE AVAILABLE, OR HAS HEALTH INSURANCE, BUT THAT INSURANCE DOES NOT FULLY COVER THE MEDICAL CARE NEEDED, SUCH AS EXHAUSTED BENEFITS, AND ALL OF THE FOLLOWING APPLY: - THE PATIENT IS NOT ELIGIBLE FOR STATE MEDICAL ASSISTANCE OR OTHER AVAILABLE ASSISTANCE PROGRAMS; - THE PATIENT MEETS THE CRITERIA FOR FINANCIAL ASSISTANCE DESCRIBED IN THIS POLICY; AND - THE PATIENT PROVIDES THE NECESSARY DOCUMENTS AND COMPLETES NECESSARY PAPERWORK. ELIGIBILITY FOR FINANCIAL ASSISTANCE IS BASED UPON FINANCIAL NEED. PATIENTS THAT FALL BELOW 299% OF THE FPL, BASED ON TOTAL HOUSEHOLD INCOME, WITH SUFFICIENT SUPPORTING DOCUMENTATION PROVIDED, WILL RECEIVE A 100% DISCOUNT. PATIENTS AT 300% OR ABOVE, UP TO A MAXIMUM OF 600% OF THE FPL, ARE ELIGIBLE FOR FINANCIAL ASSISTANCE BASED UPON A SLIDING SCALE DISCOUNT. THESE DISCOUNTS ARE APPLIED AGAINST THE MEDICARE FEE-FOR-SERVICE RATES IN PLACE AT TIME OF DETERMINATION. ELIGIBILITY FOR FINANCIAL ASSISTANCE IS ALSO DETERMINED BY THE PATIENTS OR GUARANTORS ABILITY TO PAY AFTER ALL INSURANCE HAS BEEN UTILIZED OR LIQUID RESOURCES EXHAUSTED (EXCLUDING RETIREMENT FUNDS). AMH WILL NOT CONSIDER THE PATIENTS HOUSE, CAR, RETIREMENT ACCOUNTS, AND OTHER ""NON-LIQUID"" ASSETS. HOWEVER, IT IS RECOGNIZED THAT THERE IS A SMALL PERCENT OF THE UNINSURED PATIENT POPULATION THAT HAS SUBSTANTIAL ASSETS AND COULD EASILY AFFORD TO PAY FOR HEALTHCARE SERVICES, BUT WHOM, BECAUSE OF HAVING TAX-EXEMPT INCOME, WILL NOT HAVE INCOME REFLECTED ON A TAX RETURN. SUCH INDIVIDUALS MAY NOT QUALIFY FOR FINANCIAL ASSISTANCE. FOR UNINSURED PATIENTS, THERE IS AN AUTOMATIC INITIAL DISCOUNT WHICH SHALL EQUATE TO 50% OFF TOTAL CHARGES FOR SERVICES RENDERED. IN ADDITION, FOR EMERGENCY DEPARTMENT AND OBSERVATION SERVICES FOR THOSE TREATED AND RELEASED (NOT ADMITTED AS INPATIENT) THERE WILL BE A MAXIMUM LIABILITY OF $1,600. FOR LABORATORY SERVICES, THERE IS A FURTHER DISCOUNT THAT IS GENERALLY GREATER THAN 50% OFF CHARGES. A PATIENT UNABLE TO PAY THE UNINSURED RATE IS ELIGIBLE TO APPLY FOR FINANCIAL ASSISTANCE."

USING THE COST REPORT WOULD RESULT IN A DECREASE TO THE AMOUNT ON LINE 5 OF $14,571,751 AND A DECREASE TO LINE 6 OF $21,127,010. MEDICARE UNDERPAYMENTS AND BAD DEBT ARE COMMUNITY BENEFIT AND ASSOCIATED COSTS ARE INCLUDABLE ON THE FORM 990, SCHEDULE H, PART I. THE ORGANIZATION BELIEVES THAT MEDICARE UNDERPAYMENTS (SHORTFALL) AND BAD DEBT ARE COMMUNITY BENEFIT AND ASSOCIATED COSTS ARE INCLUDABLE ON THE FORM 990, SCHEDULE H, PART I. AS OUTLINED MORE FULLY BELOW THE ORGANIZATION BELIEVES THAT THESE SERVICES AND RELATED COSTS PROMOTE THE HEALTH OF THE COMMUNITY AS A WHOLE AND ARE RENDERED IN CONJUNCTION WITH THE ORGANIZATION'S CHARITABLE TAX-EXEMPT PURPOSES AND MISSION IN PROVIDING MEDICALLY NECESSARY HEALTHCARE SERVICES TO ALL INDIVIDUALS IN A NON-DISCRIMINATORY MANNER WITHOUT REGARD TO RACE, COLOR, NATIONAL ORIGIN, GENDER, GENDER IDENTITY OR EXPRESSION, SEXUAL ORIENTATION, AGE, STATUS AS AN INDIVIDUAL WITH A HANDICAP/DISABILITY OR ABILITY TO PAY AND CONSISTENT WITH THE COMMUNITY BENEFIT STANDARD PROMULGATED BY THE IRS. THE COMMUNITY BENEFIT STANDARD IS THE CURRENT STANDARD FOR A HOSPITAL FOR RECOGNITION AS A TAX-EXEMPT AND CHARITABLE ORGANIZATION UNDER INTERNAL REVENUE CODE (""IRC"") 501(C)(3). THE ORGANIZATION IS RECOGNIZED AS A TAX-EXEMPT ENTITY AND CHARITABLE ORGANIZATION UNDER 501(C)(3) OF THE IRC. ALTHOUGH THERE IS NO DEFINITION IN THE TAX CODE FOR THE TERM ""CHARITABLE"" A REGULATION PROMULGATED BY THE DEPARTMENT OF THE TREASURY PROVIDES SOME GUIDANCE AND STATES THAT ""THE TERM CHARITABLE IS USED IN SECTION 501(C)(3) IN ITS GENERALLY ACCEPTED LEGAL SENSE,PROVIDES EXAMPLES OF CHARITABLE PURPOSES, INCLUDING THE RELIEF OF THE POOR OR UNPRIVILEGED; THE PROMOTION OF SOCIAL WELFARE; AND THE ADVANCEMENT OF EDUCATION, RELIGION, AND SCIENCE. NOTE IT DOES NOT EXPLICITLY ADDRESS THE ACTIVITIES OF HOSPITALS. IN THE ABSENCE OF EXPLICIT STATUTORY OR REGULATORY REQUIREMENTS APPLYING THE TERM ""CHARITABLE"" TO HOSPITALS, IT HAS BEEN LEFT TO THE IRS TO DETERMINE THE CRITERIA HOSPITALS MUST MEET TO QUALIFY AS IRC 501(C)(3) CHARITABLE ORGANIZATIONS. THE ORIGINAL STANDARD WAS KNOWN AS THE CHARITY CARE STANDARD. THIS STANDARD WAS REPLACED BY THE IRS WITH THE COMMUNITY BENEFIT STANDARD WHICH IS THE CURRENT STANDARD. CHARITY CARE STANDARD IN 1956, THE IRS ISSUED REVENUE RULING 56-185, WHICH ADDRESSED THE REQUIREMENTS HOSPITALS NEEDED TO MEET IN ORDER TO QUALIFY FOR IRC 501(C)(3) STATUS. ONE OF THESE REQUIREMENTS IS KNOWN AS THE ""CHARITY CARE STANDARD."" UNDER THE STANDARD, A HOSPITAL HAD TO PROVIDE, TO THE EXTENT OF ITS FINANCIAL ABILITY, FREE OR REDUCED-COST CARE TO PATIENTS UNABLE TO PAY FOR IT. A HOSPITAL THAT EXPECTED FULL PAYMENT DID NOT, ACCORDING TO THE RULING, PROVIDE CHARITY CARE BASED ON THE FACT THAT SOME PATIENTS ULTIMATELY FAILED TO PAY. THE RULING EMPHASIZED THAT A LOW LEVEL OF CHARITY CARE DID NOT NECESSARILY MEAN THAT A HOSPITAL HAD FAILED TO MEET THE REQUIREMENT SINCE THAT LEVEL COULD REFLECT ITS FINANCIAL ABILITY TO PROVIDE SUCH CARE. THE RULING ALSO NOTED THAT PUBLICLY SUPPORTED COMMUNITY HOSPITALS WOULD NORMALLY QUALIFY AS CHARITABLE ORGANIZATIONS BECAUSE THEY SERVE THE ENTIRE COMMUNITY AND A LOW LEVEL OF CHARITY CARE WOULD NOT AFFECT A HOSPITAL'S EXEMPT STATUS IF IT WAS DUE TO THE SURROUNDING COMMUNITY'S LACK OF CHARITABLE DEMANDS. COMMUNITY BENEFIT STANDARD IN 1969, THE IRS ISSUED REVENUE RULING 69-545, WHICH ""REMOVE(D)"" FROM REVENUE RULING 56-185 ""THE REQUIREMENTS RELATING TO CARING FOR PATIENTS WITHOUT CHARGE OR AT RATES BELOW COST."" UNDER THE STANDARD DEVELOPED IN REVENUE RULING 69-545, WHICH IS KNOWN AS THE ""COMMUNITY BENEFIT STANDARD,"" HOSPITALS ARE JUDGED ON WHETHER THEY PROMOTE THE HEALTH OF A BROAD CLASS OF INDIVIDUALS IN THE COMMUNITY. THE RULING INVOLVED A HOSPITAL THAT ONLY ADMITTED INDIVIDUALS WHO COULD PAY FOR THE SERVICES (BY THEMSELVES, PRIVATE INSURANCE, OR PUBLIC PROGRAMS SUCH AS MEDICARE), BUT OPERATED A FULL-TIME EMERGENCY ROOM THAT WAS OPEN TO EVERYONE. THE IRS RULED THAT THE HOSPITAL QUALIFIED AS A CHARITABLE ORGANIZATION BECAUSE IT PROMOTED THE HEALTH OF PEOPLE IN ITS COMMUNITY. THE IRS REASONED THAT BECAUSE THE PROMOTION OF HEALTH WAS A CHARITABLE PURPOSE ACCORDING TO THE GENERAL LAW OF CHARITY, IT FELL WITHIN THE ""GENERALLY ACCEPTED LEGAL SENSE"" OF THE TERM ""CHARITABLE,"" AS REQUIRED BY TREAS. REG. 1.501(C)(3)-1(D)(2). THE IRS RULING STATED THAT THE PROMOTION OF HEALTH, LIKE THE RELIEF OF POVERTY AND THE ADVANCEMENT OF EDUCATION AND RELIGION, IS ONE OF THE PURPOSES IN THE GENERAL LAW OF CHARITY THAT IS DEEMED BENEFICIAL TO THE COMMUNITY AS A WHOLE EVEN THOUGH THE CLASS OF BENEFICIARIES ELIGIBLE TO RECEIVE A DIRECT BENEFIT FROM ITS ACTIVITIES DOES NOT INCLUDE ALL MEMBERS OF THE COMMUNITY, SUCH AS INDIGENT MEMBERS OF THE COMMUNITY, PROVIDED THAT THE CLASS IS NOT SO SMALL THAT ITS RELIEF IS NOT OF BENEFIT TO THE COMMUNITY. THE IRS CONCLUDED THAT THE HOSPITAL WAS ""PROMOTING THE HEALTH OF A CLASS OF PERSONS THAT IS BROAD ENOUGH TO BENEFIT THE COMMUNITY"" BECAUSE ITS EMERGENCY ROOM WAS OPEN TO ALL AND IT PROVIDED CARE TO EVERYONE WHO COULD PAY, WHETHER DIRECTLY OR THROUGH THIRD-PARTY REIMBURSEMENT. OTHER CHARACTERISTICS OF THE HOSPITAL THAT THE IRS HIGHLIGHTED INCLUDED THE FOLLOWING: ITS SURPLUS FUNDS WERE USED TO IMPROVE PATIENT CARE, EXPAND HOSPITAL FACILITIES, AND ADVANCE MEDICAL TRAINING, EDUCATION, AND RESEARCH; IT WAS CONTROLLED BY A BOARD OF TRUSTEES THAT CONSISTED OF INDEPENDENT CIVIC LEADERS; AND HOSPITAL MEDICAL STAFF PRIVILEGES WERE AVAILABLE TO ALL QUALIFIED PHYSICIANS. THE AMERICAN HOSPITAL ASSOCIATION (""AHA"") BELIEVES THAT MEDICARE UNDERPAYMENTS (SHORTFALL) AND BAD DEBT ARE COMMUNITY BENEFIT AND THUS INCLUDABLE ON THE FORM 990, SCHEDULE H, PART I. THIS ORGANIZATION AGREES WITH THE AHA POSITION. AS OUTLINED IN THE AHA LETTER TO THE IRS DATED AUGUST 21, 2007 WITH RESPECT TO THE FIRST PUBLISHED DRAFT OF THE NEW FORM 990 AND SCHEDULE H, THE AHA FELT THAT THE IRS SHOULD INCORPORATE THE FULL VALUE OF THE COMMUNITY BENEFIT THAT HOSPITALS PROVIDE BY COUNTING MEDICARE UNDERPAYMENTS (SHORTFALL) AS QUANTIFIABLE COMMUNITY BENEFIT FOR THE FOLLOWING REASONS: - PROVIDING CARE FOR THE ELDERLY AND SERVING MEDICARE PATIENTS IS AN ESSENTIAL PART OF THE COMMUNITY BENEFIT STANDARD. - MEDICARE, LIKE MEDICAID, DOES NOT PAY THE FULL COST OF CARE. RECENTLY, MEDICARE REIMBURSES HOSPITALS ONLY 92 CENTS FOR EVERY DOLLAR THEY SPEND TO TAKE CARE OF MEDICARE PATIENTS. THE MEDICARE PAYMENT ADVISORY COMMISSION (""MEDPAC"") IN ITS MARCH 2007 REPORT TO CONGRESS CAUTIONED THAT UNDERPAYMENT WILL GET EVEN WORSE, WITH MARGINS REACHING A 10-YEAR LOW AT NEGATIVE 5.4 PERCENT. - MANY MEDICARE BENEFICIARIES, LIKE THEIR MEDICAID COUNTERPARTS, ARE POOR. MORE THAN 46 PERCENT OF MEDICARE SPENDING IS FOR BENEFICIARIES WHOSE INCOME IS BELOW 200 PERCENT OF THE FEDERAL POVERTY LEVEL. MANY OF THOSE MEDICARE BENEFICIARIES ARE ALSO ELIGIBLE FOR MEDICAID - SO CALLED ELIGIBLES."" THERE IS EVERY COMPELLING PUBLIC POLICY REASON TO TREAT MEDICARE AND MEDICAID UNDERPAYMENTS SIMILARLY FOR PURPOSES OF A HOSPITAL'S COMMUNITY BENEFIT AND INCLUDE THESE COSTS ON FORM 990, SCHEDULE H, PART I. MEDICARE UNDERPAYMENT MUST BE SHOULDERED BY THE HOSPITAL IN ORDER TO CONTINUE TREATING THE COMMUNITY'S ELDERLY AND POOR. THESE UNDERPAYMENTS REPRESENT A REAL COST OF SERVING THE COMMUNITY AND SHOULD COUNT AS A QUANTIFIABLE COMMUNITY BENEFIT. BOTH THE AHA AND THIS ORGANIZATION ALSO FEEL THAT PATIENT BAD DEBT IS A COMMUNITY BENEFIT AND THUS INCLUDABLE ON THE FORM 990, SCHEDULE H, PART I. LIKE MEDICARE UNDERPAYMENT (SHORTFALLS), THERE ALSO ARE COMPELLING REASONS THAT PATIENT BAD DEBT SHOULD BE COUNTED AS QUANTIFIABLE COMMUNITY BENEFIT AS FOLLOWS: - A SIGNIFICANT MAJORITY OF BAD DEBT IS ATTRIBUTABLE TO LOW-INCOME PATIENTS, WHO, FOR MANY REASONS, DECLINE TO COMPLETE THE FORMS REQUIRED TO ESTABLISH ELIGIBILITY FOR HOSPITALS' CHARITY CARE OR FINANCIAL ASSISTANCE PROGRAMS. A 2006 CONGRESSIONAL BUDGET OFFICE (""CBO"") REPORT, NONPROFIT HOSPITALS AND THE PROVISION OF COMMUNITY BENEFITS, CITED TWO STUDIES INDICATING THAT ""THE GREAT MAJORITY OF BAD DEBT WAS ATTRIBUTABLE TO PATIENTS WITH INCOMES BELOW 200% OF THE FEDERAL POVERTY LINE."" - THE REPORT ALSO NOTED THAT A SUBSTANTIAL PORTION OF BAD DEBT IS PENDING CHARITY CARE. UNLIKE BAD DEBT IN OTHER INDUSTRIES, HOSPITAL BAD DEBT IS COMPLICATED BY THE FACT THAT HOSPITALS FOLLOW THEIR MISSION TO THE COMMUNITY AND TREAT EVERY PATIENT THAT COMES THROUGH THEIR EMERGENCY DEPARTMENT, REGARDLESS OF ABILITY TO PAY. PATIENTS WHO HAVE OUTSTANDING BILLS ARE NOT TURNED AWAY, UNLIKE OTHER INDUSTRIES. BAD DEBT IS FURTHER COMPLICATED BY THE AUDITING INDUSTRY'S STANDARDS ON REPORTING CHARITY CARE. MANY PATIENTS CANNOT OR DO NOT PROVIDE THE NECESSARY, EXTENSIVE DOCUMENTATION REQUIRED TO BE DEEMED CHARITY CARE BY AUDITORS. AS A RESULT, ROUGHLY 40% OF BAD DEBT IS PENDING CHARITY CARE. - THE CBO CO"
202001959349300130,231352152,"SCHEDULE H, PART III, SECTION C; QUESTION 9B","AMH provides inpatient, outpatient, and emergency services without regard to a patient's ability to pay. To fulfill its mission of providing compassionate, high quality care to all patients it serves, AMH must also ensure its own financial viability. In order to secure reimbursement of costs for services provided, every effort is made to assist patients in obtaining insurance coverage through medical assistance (ma), children's health insurance program (chip) or other federal, state, or city care coverage sources. AMH provides financial assistance to those patients who are unable to pay based upon the eligibility criteria included in their financial assistance policy. Billing & collection efforts ---------------------------- While qualification for financial assistance is ideally determined prior to, or at the time of service, AMH continues to review such determinations as other financial resources are discovered during the billing and collection process. After an uninsured or under-insured patient's account is reduced to the uninsured discount or the financial assistance discount rate, whichever is applicable, the patient is responsible for the remainder of any outstanding patient balances. Patients will receive an initial statement indicating their balance due along with information regarding the availability of financial assistance and who to contact. Self-pay balances go through a pre-collection agency placement process that may entail the mailing of statements or letters and/or phone calls in order to collect payment on open balances. Once open balance accounts complete the pre-collection dunning cycle, (120 days or more) with no payment or proof of eligibility for financial assistance or other programs, the accounts will be transferred to a professional collection agency. If a financial assistance application and appropriate supporting documents have been submitted and a decision is pending, the account will be held from agency placement. In some cases, a patient eligible for financial assistance may not have been identified prior to sending the account to an external collection agency. Each agency will be made aware of the financial assistance policy and will work with the provider to ascertain patient eligibility. Extraordinary collection actions (""ecas"") will not be undertaken during the initial notification period of the 120 days from the first post-discharge billing statement and until such time as a 30 day initiation of eca notice has been sent to the individual. The 30 day eca initiation notice will contain the eca action that the provider intends to undertake and the date at which time this would occur. A copy of the organizations plain language summary will accompany the 30 day eca initiation notice. If the patient submits a financial assistance application, AMH will suspend any ecas until the patients financial assistance eligibility is determined and the patient is informed of their eligibility. If a patient account is referred to an outside agency, that agency must first agree to abide by AMHs financial assistance policy in relation to its collection efforts. No external collection agency are permitted to engage in ecas unless authorized by AMH. After the above-described steps have been taken, AMH may use ecas with the respect to the patient account of an uninsured or under-insured and may further consider credit bureau reporting and/or legal action as appropriate. AMHs general counsel is required to approve all lawsuits prior to the eca commencing. Final authority for determining that AMH has made adequate attempts to inform a patient of the financial assistance policy, and thus may initiate the use ecas, rests with the organizations vice president director of revenue cycle operations."

LOUIS AND MERCY HOSPITAL WASHINGTONIn 2018, Mercy Hospital St. Louis and Mercy Hospital Washington began planning for their 2019-2021 Community Health Needs Assessments (CHNA). Presidents from the hospitals led their corresponding Community Health Councils in guiding the needs assessment process. The councils convene quarterly and are accountable for ensuring that community benefit activities meet mission compliance and IRS guidelines. They consist of Mercy leaders from various departments, such as behavioral health, finance, care management, philanthropy, etc., and one hospital board member. The Councils determine which health initiatives will be put forth in the hospital's three-year Community Health Improvement Plan (CHIP).Co-workers in Mercy's Community Health & Access Department serve on the Councils and were primary leads of the 2019 CHNAs. The voices of the people of St. Louis County and Franklin County were central to the health needs assessment process. MHSL and MHW gathered community input directly through:- Surveys online and printed (for those with no computer access)- Mercy Community Advisory Panels- Community Coalitions and Stakeholder MeetingsThrough participation in the STLPHC, Mercy Hospital St. Louis also had access to primary and secondary data collected through their Mobilizing for Action through Planning and Partnerships (MAPP) assessments: the Community Themes and Strengths Assessment (CTSA), the Local Public Health System Assessment, the Community Health Status Assessment (CHSA), and the Forces of Change Assessment (FCA). The CTSA in particular included fourteen (14) listening sessions, two (2) surveys, and twelve (12) focus groups conducted with residents throughout the region.

The Mercy Hospital St. Louis and Mercy Hospital Washington Community Health Councils were presented with the quantitative and qualitative community health data and members were asked to rank these health issues by level of concern and ability to collaborate on the issue to produce results. The strengths and services of the hospitals along with their strategic plans were also considered. Upon review and discussion of the Primary and Secondary data gathered, the hospitals' Strategic Plans, and the resources available at the hospitals and in the communities, the following priorities were selected:Mercy Hospital St. Louis: - Access to Care- Behavioral Health/Substance Abuse- Maternal Child Health- Chronic Disease Prevention and Management- Health EquityMercy Hospital Washington:- Access to Care - Navigation to Services and Social Determinants of Health- Behavioral Health - Mental Health and Substance & Opiate Use- Childhood Obesity Food and Nutritional EducationThe Community Health Councils then created Community Health Improvement Plans (CHIP) for their hospital, identifying specific initiatives related to improving each of these health priorities. The CHIPs were designed with realistic, measurable, and attainable goals that align with the mission and strategy of the organizations. Mercy Hospital St. Louis and Mercy Hospital Washington also assess the needs of the community through requests by local agencies. According to the Catholic Health Association, a request from a public agency or community group to initiate or continue an activity or program meets the requirements for a documented community need. Mercy leaders serving on the boards of United Way 2-1-1 and the Integrated Health Network are examples of our involvement with community organizations based on the organization's request for support."

WE PROVIDE EXCELLENT AND COMPASSIONATE CARE AND RESPONSIVE SERVICE. AS WE SEEK TO UNDERSTAND AND FULLY MEET OUR PATIENTS' CURRENT AND FUTURE NEEDS AND EXPECTATIONS, WE RECOGNIZE OUR RESPONSIBILITY TO PRUDENTLY USE THE SCARCE RESOURCES ENTRUSTED TO US. LAWS, REGULATIONS, CATASTROPHIC ILLNESSES AND THE RISING COSTS OF NEW TECHNOLOGY HAVE CREATED A CATEGORY OF PATIENTS WHO ARE EITHER UNINSURED OR UNDERINSURED. THIS CHARITY CARE PROGRAM HAS BEEN DEVELOPED TO HELP THE HOSPITAL MEET THE NEEDS OF THESE PATIENTS AND, CONCURRENTLY, MAINTAIN THE FINANCIAL VIABILITY OF THE HOSPITAL FOR FUTURE GENERATIONS. THIS CHARITY CARE POLICY EXPLAINS HOW THE HOSPITAL ASSISTS PATIENTS WHO CANNOT PAY FOR PART OR ALL OF THE ESSENTIAL MEDICAL CARE THEY RECEIVE. PRINCIPLES: STRONG MEMORIAL HOSPITAL PROACTIVELY CONVEYS INFORMATION ABOUT THIS CHARITY CARE POLICY TO PATIENTS AND THEIR FAMILIES. - WE BELIEVE THAT FEAR OF A HOSPITAL BILL SHOULD NEVER GET IN THE WAY OF ESSENTIAL HEALTH SERVICES. THE PROVISION OF URGENT OR EMERGENT HEALTHCARE IS NEVER DELAYED PENDING A FINANCIAL ASSISTANCE DETERMINATION. SIGNS ANNOUNCING THE CHARITY CARE PROGRAM ARE POSTED IN THE HOSPITAL (E.G. EMERGENCY DEPARTMENT, ADMITTING OFFICE) TO PROACTIVELY CONVEY THIS MESSAGE TO PROSPECTIVE PATIENTS AND THE PUBLIC IN GENERAL. - WE MAINTAIN FINANCIAL AID POLICIES THAT ARE CONSISTENT WITH THE MISSION, VALUES AND CAPACITY OF THE HOSPITAL AND THAT TAKE INTO ACCOUNT EACH INDIVIDUAL'S ABILITY TO CONTRIBUTE TO THE COST OF HIS OR HER CARE. - WE COMMUNICATE THE AVAILABILITY OF FINANCIAL AID IN A MANNER THAT IS CLEAR, UNDERSTANDABLE, SENSITIVE TO THE PATIENT'S DIGNITY, AND IN MULTIPLE LANGUAGES. A NOTICE IS AVAILABLE AT REGISTRATION SITES THAT INFORMS PATIENTS OF THIS PROGRAM AND PROVIDES THE PHONE NUMBER TO CALL TO OBTAIN MORE INFORMATION AND TO APPLY FOR THIS PROGRAM. DESIGNATED STAFF ARE PROVIDED DETAILED TRAINING SO THAT THEY CAN PROVIDE INFORMATION AND ANSWER QUESTIONS ABOUT THE CHARITY CARE PROGRAM. INFORMATION IS GENERALLY AVAILABLE IN BOTH ENGLISH AND SPANISH. WHEN REQUESTED, IT WILL ALSO BE MADE AVAILABLE IN OTHER LANGUAGES. - INFORMATION REGARDING OUR CHARITY CARE PROGRAM IS ALSO AVAILABLE ON THE URMC WEBSITE. - WE IMPLEMENT FINANCIAL AID PROCEDURES THAT ARE CONSUMER-FRIENDLY, RESPECTFUL, AND CONFIDENTIAL, AS WELL AS DEBT COLLECTION POLICIES THAT REFLECT THE MISSION AND VALUES OF THIS HOSPITAL. - WE WORK WITH GOVERNMENT, PAYERS, BUSINESS, CONSUMER GROUPS AND OTHERS TO ADDRESS THE UNDERLYING PROBLEM THAT TOO MANY NEW YORKERS LACK HEALTH INSURANCE. GENERAL GUIDELINES: AS PART OF FINANCIAL PLANNING ASSISTANCE, WE PROVIDE PATIENTS, AND/OR THEIR LEGAL REPRESENTATIVE, WITH INFORMATION ABOUT THE CRITERIA THAT MUST BE MET IN ORDER TO OBTAIN MEDICAID, MEDICARE, OR OTHER HEALTH INSURANCES. PATIENTS ARE ASSISTED IN MAKING APPLICATIONS FOR ANY OF THESE INSURANCES OR DISCOUNTED FEE PLANS. PATIENTS ARE EXPECTED TO PARTICIPATE FULLY IN ALL EFFORTS TO OBTAIN ANY INSURANCE FOR WHICH THEY MAY QUALIFY. UNDER CERTAIN CIRCUMSTANCES, AS DETERMINED BY THE FINANCIAL CASE MANAGERS OR OTHER HOSPITAL SENIOR ADMINISTRATORS. APPLICATIONS FOR MEDICAID, MEDICARE OR OTHER INSURANCE PROGRAMS MAY BE WAIVED WHEN DEEMED UNNECESSARY. IF AVAILABLE INSURANCE BENEFITS ARE NOT SUFFICIENT TO COVER THE COST OF THEIR CARE, PATIENTS MAY THEN APPLY FOR ASSISTANCE FROM THE CHARITY CARE PROGRAM. CHARITY CARE APPLICATIONS MUST BE COMPLETED AND RETURNED TO THE HOSPITAL WITH THE REQUESTED INCOME DOCUMENTATION. PATIENTS WILL NOT RECEIVE CHARITY CARE ASSISTANCE IF THEY (A) DO NOT COMPLETE THE APPLICATION PROCESS FOR MEDICAID OR OTHER INSURANCE FOR WHICH THEY MAY QUALIFY, (B) ELECT NOT TO MAKE APPLICATION FOR CHARITY CARE, OR (C) HAVE ADEQUATE RESOURCES OR INCOME TO PAY PRIVATELY FOR THEIR CARE. IN THESE SITUATIONS, THEY WILL REMAIN FINANCIALLY RESPONSIBLE FOR FULL PAYMENT OF THEIR HOSPITAL BILLS. CHARITY CARE ASSISTANCE IS AVAILABLE FOR PATIENTS WHO RESIDE IN NEW YORK STATE AND RECEIVE EMERGENCY HOSPITAL SERVICES, INCLUDING EMERGENCY TRANSFERS, AND TO PATIENTS WHO RESIDE IN STRONG MEMORIAL HOSPITAL'S PRIMARY SERVICE AREA IN NEW YORK STATE WHO RECEIVE SERVICES IN DESIGNATED STRONG MEMORIAL HOSPITAL PROGRAMS, INCLUDING MOST INPATIENT AND OUTPATIENT SERVICES. IN ADDITION, THE HOSPITAL MAY, IN ITS DISCRETION, GRANT CHARITY CARE TO INDIVIDUALS WHO RESIDE OUTSIDE OF NEW YORK STATE. CHARITY CARE ASSISTANCE DOES NOT COVER MEDICALLY UNNECESSARY CARE, COSMETIC ALTERATION, TELEPHONE, TELEVISION AND PRIVATE ROOM CHARGES. IT DOES NOT COVER SERVICES GENERATED BY AN INSURED PATIENT WHO CHOOSES TO RECEIVE CARE AT AN OUT-OF-NETWORK HOSPITAL, OR WHO FAILS TO COMPLY WITH INSURANCE POLICY REQUIREMENTS (E.G. UNAUTHORIZED SERVICES) NOR DOES IT APPLY TO NON-RESIDENT ALIENS (UNLESS APPROVED IN ADVANCE OF CARE BEING PROVIDED), TO DRUGS NOT ADMINISTERED IN THE HOSPITAL, TO TRANSPORTATION FURNISHED BY THIRD PARTY VENDORS, OR TO CARE, SERVICES, DRUGS OR SUPPLIES FOR THE PURPOSE OF GENDER CHANGE PROCEDURE. SPECIFIC QUESTIONS ABOUT SERVICES THAT ARE NOT COVERED SHOULD BE DIRECTED TO THE PATIENT ACCOUNTS MANAGER OR THEIR DELEGATE. FINANCIAL GUIDELINES: FINANCIAL AID IS INTENDED TO ASSIST THOSE INDIVIDUALS WHO CANNOT AFFORD TO PAY IN PART OR IN FULL FOR THEIR CARE. IT SHOULD TAKE INTO ACCOUNT EACH INDIVIDUAL'S ABILITY TO CONTRIBUTE TO THE COST OF HIS OR HER CARE. HOSPITAL FINANCIAL AID SHOULD NOT BE VIEWED AS A SUBSTITUTE FOR EMPLOYER-SPONSORED OR INDIVIDUALLY PURCHASED INSURANCE. PATIENTS WITHOUT INSURANCE AND WITH INCOME THAT WOULD QUALIFY THEM FOR THE CHARITY CARE PROGRAM BUT ALSO HAVE SUBSTANTIAL RESOURCES (OTHER THAN TAX-DEFERRED OR COMPARABLE RETIREMENT SAVINGS OR COLLEGE SAVINGS ACCOUNTS) MAY BE EXPECTED TO PAY PART OF THEIR BILLS(S). CHARITY CARE ASSISTANCE IS GENERALLY AVAILABLE TO INDIVIDUALS WHOSE INCOME IS LESS THAN OR EQUAL TO 400% OF THE FEDERAL POVERTY LEVEL. HOWEVER, PATIENTS WHO HAVE EXHAUSTED THEIR INSURANCE BENEFITS, EXCEEDED FINANCIAL ELIGIBILITY CRITERIA, FACE EXTRAORDINARY MEDICAL COSTS, OR WHO HAVE OTHER UNIQUE CIRCUMSTANCES MAY BE CONSIDERED FOR CHARITY CARE APPROVAL IN THE HOSPITAL'S SOLE DISCRETION. WHILE APPLICATION FOR MEDICAID OR OTHER INSURANCE IS USUALLY REQUIRED, THE HOSPITAL MAY, AT ITS SOLE DISCRETION, IN APPROPRIATE CASES, ALSO CONSIDER PATIENTS FOR CHARITY CARE WHEN THEY MEET THE FINANCIAL CRITERIA OF THIS PROGRAM, BUT HAVE NOT SATISFACTORILY COMPLETED ALL THE REQUIREMENTS OF THE CHARITY CARE APPLICATION PROCESS. THIS MAY INCLUDE PATIENTS WHO HAVE BEEN SANCTIONED BY MEDICAID, HAVE FILED BANKRUPTCY OR APPEAR TO BE ELIGIBLE FOR CHARITY CARE ASSISTANCE BASED ON AVAILABLE INFORMATION. ELIGIBILITY DETERMINATIONS IN COMPLEX CASE CIRCUMSTANCES WILL BE MADE AFTER CONSIDERATION BY THE CHARITY CARE REVIEW TEAM THAT INCLUDES THE CHARITY CARE OFFICER, FINANCIAL CASE MANAGER AND/OR THEIR MANAGERS, OR MAY BE MADE BY SENIOR HOSPITAL ADMINISTRATORS. THE AMOUNT OF THE DISCOUNT AFFORDED TO QUALIFIED CHARITY CARE PATIENTS WILL BE DETERMINED THROUGH ASSESSMENT OF THE RESPONSIBLE PARTY'S ANNUAL HOUSEHOLD INCOME AND THE NUMBER OF PEOPLE IN THE HOME, AS A PERCENTAGE OF THE FEDERAL POVERTY GUIDELINE AMOUNTS FOR SAME SIZE HOUSEHOLDS. THE FINANCIAL GUIDELINES WILL BE UPDATED ANNUALLY IN CONJUNCTION WITH THE FEDERAL POVERTY UPDATES PUBLISHED BY CMS. PATIENTS MAY RECEIVE FULL OR PARTIAL DISCOUNT FROM THE COST OF CARE, DEPENDING ON THE PERCENTAGE OF THE GUIDELINES MATCHED BY THE PATIENT'S HOUSEHOLD INCOME. ANY BILL AMOUNT REMAINING AFTER APPLICATION OF A PARTIAL CHARITY CARE DISCOUNT IS THE RESPONSIBILITY OF THE PATIENT. THE AMOUNT AN APPROVED CHARITY CARE PATIENT WILL GENERALLY BE EXPECTED TO PAY FOR SERVICES COVERED BY THE POLICY WILL BE LIMITED TO THE LOWER OF THE AMOUNT THAT THE HOSPITAL WOULD HAVE RECEIVED FOR THE SAME SERVICE UNDER MEDICARE PARTS A AND B, (INCLUDING COINSURANCE, CO-PAYMENTS AND DEDUCTIBLES) OR THE USUAL AND CUSTOMARY CHARGES. THE PATIENT WILL BE ASSISTED BY THE HOSPITAL IN MAKING ARRANGEMENTS TO SATISFY ANY BALANCE REMAINING ON THE ACCOUNT(S) AFTER THE APPLICATION OF THE APPROPRIATE CHARITY CARE DISCOUNT BY USE OF A PAYMENT PLAN. THE MONTHLY PAYMENTS UNDER SUCH PLANS SHALL NOT EXCEED TEN PERCENT (10%) OF THE ELIGIBLE PATIENT'S GROSS MONTHLY INCOME. THE RATE OF INTEREST ON UNPAID BALANCES SHALL NOT EXCEED THE US TREASURY RATE FOR 90 DAY SECURITIES PLUS 0.5%. HOSPITAL PATIENT FINANCIAL AID STATUTE DISCOUNTING REQUIREMENTS DISCOUNT / GROSS INCOME AS % OF FEDERAL POVERTY LEVEL 100% / UP TO 200% 80% / BETWEEN 201-250% 60% / BETWEEN 251-300% 40% / BETWEEN 301-350% 20% / BETWEEN 351-400% 0% / OVER 401% PROCESS: APPLICATIONS WILL BE ACCEPTED IMMEDIATELY BEFORE, DURING OR AFTER CARE IS PROVIDED. THE HOSPITAL WILL STRIVE TO ASSIST PATIENTS RECEIVING HIGH-COST SERVICES AS THEY OCCUR. PATIENTS MAY BE APPROVED FOR CHARITY CARE ON AN ACCOUNT-BY-ACCOUNT BASIS OR FOR A PERIOD OF TIME (FOR A COURSE OF TREATMENT). F"

THE COMMUNICABLE DISEASE SECTION OF THE CCHP MONITORS INFECTIOUS DISEASE PREVALENCE AND TRENDS FOR OUR COMMUNITY AND SHARES DATA BOTH LOCALLY AND NATIONALLY. THE CANCER PREVENTION SECTION IN THE CCHP FOLLOWS TRENDS IN CANCER RATES AS WELL AS SCREENING RATES. FACULTY AND STAFF FROM WITHIN THE CCHP AS WELL AS AROUND THE INSTITUTION FREQUENTLY ATTEND COMMUNITY MEETINGS AND EVENTS TO GAUGE THE NEEDS OF COMMUNITY MEMBERS. IN ADDITION, THE CCHP SUPPORTS THE COMMUNITY ADVISORY COUNCIL (CAC), A LARGE COLLABORATIVE OF COMMUNITY LEADERS THAT INFORMS THE UNIVERSITY ABOUT ON-GOING AND EMERGING CONCERNS. THE COMMUNITY ADVISORY COUNCIL (CAC) WAS CREATED IN 2006 TO REPRESENT THE VOICE OF THE COMMUNITY AND TO GUIDE AND SUPPORT THE MISSION OF THE URMC. THE THIRTY-NINE MEMBER CAC REPRESENTS TWENTY-ONE COMMUNITY-BASED ORGANIZATIONS, INCLUDING HEALTH AND SOCIAL SERVICE AGENCIES, THE FAITH COMMUNITY, LOCAL GOVERNMENT, THE CITY SCHOOL DISTRICT AND MEDIA. A PRIMARY FUNCTION OF THE CAC IS TO STRENGTHEN URMC-COMMUNITY PARTNERSHIPS WITH A MUTUAL GOAL TO REDUCE INEQUALITIES AND IMPROVE ACCESS TO HEALTH CARE AND SERVICES.

Training materials were revised, new scripting was developed, and training sessions were held for applicable Revenue Cycle employees which required competency sign-off for those who completed the training. Procedures initially implemented included offering a copy of the plain language summary (PLS) to patients as part of the intake process. Individuals were notified about the Financial Assistance Policy (FAP) by receiving a conspicuous written notice about the FAP on their billing statements, and via conspicuous public displays or other measures reasonably calculated to attract patients' attention. As a result of an annual internal review, it was determined that the PLS of Bon Secours Mercy Health's Healthcare FAP was not being offered to all patients at intake during 2019. Immediately upon recognition of the minor oversight, Bon Secours Mercy Health began taking steps to offer a copy of the PLS to all patients who visit the hospital facilities by adding scripting to notify patients of the availability of financial assistance and offering a copy of the PLS to the patient intake process. In addition, Bon Secours Mercy Health added new language to the Consent for Treatment, Payment, and Health Care Operations (Consent) form required to be signed by all patients, including a copy of the PLS attached as an addendum to the Consent to certify that the patient is aware of Bon Secours Mercy Health's FAP and a copy of the PLS was offered. Additional training has also been provided to all applicable staff. Bon Secours Mercy Health widely publicized its FAP, the FAP Application, and the PLS on the organization's website, includes a conspicuous written notice about the FAP on patients' billing statements, posts conspicuous public displays in the Emergency Department and Registration areas of the hospitals, and notifies members of the community about availability of the FAP. Bon Secours Mercy Health will continue to perform an internal audit on a regular and continuous basis at least once per year to ensure compliance. We do not believe the minor oversight to be considered ""willful or egregious"" and Bon Secours Mercy Health has performed internal research to identify how the minor oversight occurred and taken additional steps to ensure compliance going forward."

The St. Mary's Hospital serves residents primarily from the counties of Chesterfield, Goochland, Hanover, Henrico, and Richmond City. While its core is based in the Richmond metropolitan area, its services reach into the surrounding rural counties. Bon Secours Richmond Health System serves the larger Richmond, Virginia metropolitan area and includes four hospital facilities whose service areas largely overlap. While the hospitals serve patients from many cities and counties, the majority of patients fall within the counties of Chesterfield, Henrico, Hanover and the City of Richmond totaling over 1 million residents. For the purpose of this CHNA, we refer to these as the ""Richmond Core Service Area."" The Richmond Core Service Area is primarily Caucasian and African American. When the demographics of the City of Richmond are viewed alone, we find a much lower percentage of Caucasians and a much higher percentage of African Americans than the community overall. The population age distribution for the Richmond Core Service Area is similar to Virginia overall with the exception of the City of Richmond, which has a higher percentage of 19-64 year olds (69%) and lower percentages of children (18%) and older adults (13%). Median household incomes in the United States are less than those found in Virginia overall. The Richmond Core Service Area counties of Henrico, Hanover and Chesterfield all have higher median household incomes than the U.S. overall. In contrast, the City of Richmond has a much lower median household income as compared to the U.S. and Virginia overall. Compared to Virginia, the percentage of uninsured adults is highest in the City of Richmond and lowest in Hanover County. The percentages of uninsured children show a much lower degree of variance."

The System was organized in June 1983 to fulfill the healthcare mission of the United States Province of the Congregation of the Sisters of Bon Secours of Paris, a congregation of religious women of the Roman Catholic Church founded in France in 1824. The System's activities are in the states of Ohio, New York, Pennsylvania, Maryland, Virginia, Kentucky, South Carolina, and Florida, each referred to as a local system. The Ministry of BSMH aids those in need, particularly those who are sick and dying, by offering services that include but are not limited to acute inpatient, outpatient, pastoral, palliative, home health, nursing home, rehabilitative, primary and secondary care and assisted living without regard to race, religion, color, gender, age, marital status, national origin, sexual orientation, or disability. As a member of the Catholic health ministry and a member of BSMH, this organization and its related entities are called to continue the healing ministry of Jesus. We exist to benefit the people living in the communities it serves. Through all of the services offered to the community, the mission is ""to bring compassion to health care and to be good help to those in need, especially those who are poor and dying. As a System of caregivers, we commit ourselves to help bring people and communities to health and wholeness as part of the healing ministry of Jesus Christ and the Catholic Church."" This organization and related organizations share the BSMH Vision. BSMH's vision to partner with communities to create a more humane world, build social justice for all and provide exceptional value for those served is implemented through its Strategic Quality Plan which provides focus in four goal areas for the current three year period (2019-2021). - Co-Create Healthy Communities: We recognize that the factors which drive health outcomes extend well beyond the scope of traditional health care services. Thus, we commit to improve the health of communities through partnership and collaboration with a broad range of constituencies including committed community residents - Be Person Centric: We recognize that those whom we serve are increasingly engaged in their own care and are seeking convenience, affordability and reliability. Thus, we commit to anticipate and respond to the changing expectations of health care consumers, and to ensure that we engage each person in an individualized plan for health with a focus on prevention and wellness. - Serve Those Who Are Vulnerable: We recognize, by our Catholic identity, that the struggle for a more humane world is not an option, but an integral part of spreading the gospel. Thus, we commit to serve those who are vulnerable in many ways, addressing health disparities, sustaining global ministries, healing the environment and working to end violence and oppression. - Strengthen Our Culture and Capabilities: We recognize that the health care delivery system is undergoing rapid change with increasing complexity. Thus, we commit to liberate the potential of our people by strengthening individual and collective capabilities with respect to ministry leadership, knowledge, analytics, innovation and finances. Please see Schedule R for listings of the related organizations. Each of the reported entities play a role in achieving the vision of BSMH and the SQP (Strategic Quality Plan).

CURRENTLY THE HOSPITAL PROVIDES BEHAVIORAL HEALTH, AND OUTPATIENT SERVICES TO THE COMMUNITY ON A SUBSIDIZED BASIS AS THESE SERVICES REFLECT AN OPERATIONAL LOSS. READING HOSPITAL IS A NOT-FOR-PROFIT HEALTHCARE CENTER PROVIDING COMPREHENSIVE ACUTE CARE, POST-ACUTE CARE REHABILITATION, BEHAVIORAL, AND OCCUPATIONAL HEALTH SERVICES TO THE PEOPLE OF BERKS AND ADJOINING COUNTIES. READING HOSPITAL LIES ON THE OUTSKIRTS OF THE CITY OF READING, WHICH HAS AN ESTIMATED POPULATION OF 79,181, IN 2019. 34.94% OF THE RESIDENTS OF THE CITY LIVE BELOW FEDERAL POVERTY LEVELS. THE HEALTH CARE NEEDS TRACK CLOSELY TO THE HIGH POVERTY RATE IN THE CITY. THE ADULT PREVALENCE OF DIABETES, THE PROPORTION OF ADULTS WITH DIAGNOSED HIGH BLOOD PRESSURE, THE PERCENT OF WOMEN WHO RECEIVE NO PRENATAL CARE IN THE FIRST TRIMESTER, THE PEDIATRIC AND ADULT ASTHMA HOSPITAL ADMISSION RATES, AND THE THREE-YEAR AVERAGE PNEUMONIA DEATH RATE ALL EXCEED THE NATIONAL BENCHMARKS FOR THESE INDICATORS. THE MISSION OF READING HOSPITAL IS TO PROVIDE COMPASSIONATE, ACCESSIBLE, HIGH QUALITY, COST EFFECTIVE HEALTH CARE TO THE COMMUNITY; TO PROMOTE HEALTH; TO EDUCATE HEALTHCARE PROFESSIONALS; AND TO PARTICIPATE IN APPROPRIATE CLINICAL RESEARCH. READING HOSPITAL IS COMMITTED TO SERVING THE NEEDS OF THE COMMUNITY, EVEN WHEN THE NEEDED SERVICES CAUSE A DRAIN ON CAPITAL RESOURCES. READING HOSPITAL IS A REGIONAL REFERRAL CENTER FOR BEHAVIORAL HEALTH SERVICES. READING HOSPITAL PROVIDES APPROXIMATELY ONE-THIRD OF ALL INPATIENT MENTAL HEALTH SERVICES USED BY THE RESIDENTS OF BERKS COUNTY AND 28% AMONG PATIENTS AGE 60+. ANOTHER MENTAL HEALTH PROVIDER, HAVEN BEHAVIORAL HEALTH, HAS RECENTLY ESTABLISHED A TREATMENT FACILITY IN THE CITY OF READING OFFERING MENTAL HEALTH SERVICES. READING HOSPITAL TREATS NEARLY 55% OF BERKS COUNTY PATIENTS REQUIRING INPATIENT SERVICES FOR SUBSTANCE ABUSE. THE OTHER NON-PROFIT HOSPITAL IN THE AREA SERVES ONLY 4% OF THESE PATIENTS. READING HOSPITAL HAS EXPANDED AND RELOCATED ITS INPATIENT DETOXIFICATION CENTER TO MEET THE GROWING NEED FOR THESE SERVICES. IF READING HOSPITAL CEASED TO PROVIDE SUBSTANCE ABUSE SERVICES, PATIENTS WOULD HAVE TO TRAVEL OUT OF THE AREA FOR TREATMENT BECAUSE LOCAL PROVIDERS WOULD NOT HAVE THE ABILITY TO MEET THE NEED. READING HOSPITAL PERENNIALLY RANKS AMONG THE TOP FOUR PENNSYLVANIA HOSPITALS IN OUTPATIENT SERVICES. BECAUSE OF THE HIGH POVERTY RATE AND THE HIGH NUMBER OF UNINSURED AND MEDICAID/CHIP RESIDENTS, OUTPATIENT SERVICES ARE OFTEN PROVIDED WITHOUT ADEQUATE COMPENSATION."

MERCY MEDICAL CENTER'S PRIMARY SERVICE AREA (""PSA"") WHICH COMPRISES 17 ZIP CODES IN BALTIMORE CITY, ACCOUNTS FOR 60% OF ITS TOTAL ADMISSIONS. KEY DEMOGRAPHIC CHARACTERISTICS OF THE PSA ARE AS FOLLOWS: POPULATION 1. THE CHNA SERVICE AREA (CBSA) POPULATION IS 186,653, REPRESENTING APPROXIMATELY 30% OF BALTIMORE CITY'S TOTAL POPULATION. 2. THE PERCENTAGE OF HOUSEHOLDS EARNING LESS THAN $25,000 IS DRAMATICALLY HIGHER THAN THE CITYWIDE PERCENTAGE (41.0% VS 33.2%). CONVERSELY, THERE ARE FAR FEWER HOUSEHOLDS EARNING MORE THAN $75,000 WITHIN MERCY'S CNHA SERVICE AREA THAN CITYWIDE (22.7% VS 25.5%). 3. UNEMPLOYMENT WITHIN MERCY'S CNHA SERVICE AREA IS SLIGHTLY HIGHER THAN CITYWIDE (10.3% VS 9.9%). PERHAPS MORE THAN ANY OTHER DATASET INCLUDED IN THIS REPORT, THIS DEMONSTRATES MERCY'S LONG-STANDING SPECIAL COMMITMENT TO SERVE THE POOR AND UNDERSERVED.

TEEN BIRTH RATE PER 1,000: 98.7 VS BALTIMORE RATE OF 65.4 4. LOW BIRTH WEIGHT: 12.7% VS BALTIMORE RATE OF 13.0% AS SHOWN BY THESE SELECT INDICATORS, THERE IS A SIGNIFICANT HEALTH STATUS DIPARITY BETWEEN MERCY'S COMMUNITY BENEFIT SERVICE AREA (CBSA) AND BALTIMORE CITY'S RESIDENTS. DUE TO ITS LOCATION IN CENTER CITY, MERCY MEDICAL CENTER CARES FOR MANY OF THE AT-RISK, LOW INCOME POPULATION IN THE COMMUNITIES THAT IMMEDIATELY SURROUND THE HOSPITAL. THIS IS BEST EVIDENCED BY THE LARGE PERCENTAGE OF EMERGENCY ROOM VISITS BY THE MEDICAID, UNINSURED AND MEDICARE PATIENTS. MEDICAID COVERED AND UNINSURED PATIENTS ACCOUNTED FOR MORE THAN 60% OF THE FY16 EMERGENCY ROOM VISITS. THERE ARE A COUPLE NOTABLE REASONS FOR SUCH A HIGH MEDICAID AND UNINSURED PATIENT POPULATION VISITING THE EMERGENCY ROOM: 1. BALTIMORE CITY'S LARGEST HOMELESS SHELTER AT GUILFORD AVENUE IS WITHIN THREE BLOCKS OF THE HOSPITAL.2. MERCY MEDICAL CENTER PROVIDES ALL OF THE MEDICAL STAFF (PHYSICIANS AND NURSING PERSONNEL) FOR HEALTHCARE FOR THE HOMELESS (HCH), A FEDERALLY QUALIFIED HEALTH CENTER, WHICH DELIVERS OUTPATIENT CARE TO A LARGE NUMBER OF HOMELESS PERSONS IN BALTIMORE CITY.

THE PROGRAM'S GOAL IS TO HOUSE HOMELESS FAMILIES AND TO PROVIDE SUPPORTIVE SERVICES FOR A DEFINED PERIOD TO PREVENT A RETURN TO HOMELESSNESS. IN FY 2019, THE SUPPORTIVE HOUSING PROGRAM AT MERCY PROVIDES A COMPREHENSIVE RANGE OF COUNSELING SERVICES AND COMMUNITY RESOURCES LINKAGES TO PATIENTS. THESE SERVICES INCURRED DIRECT COSTS OF $549,279 DURING FY 2019. MERCY FAMILY VIOLENCE RESPONSE PROGRAM THE MERCY FAMILY VIOLENCE RESPONSE PROGRAM WAS DEVELOPED BY A MULTIDISCIPLINARY STAFF TASK FORCE AT MERCY MEDICAL CENTER TO PROVIDE CRISIS INTERVENTION AND SAFETY PLANNING FOR VICTIMS OF FAMILY VIOLENCE (DOMESTIC VIOLENCE, CHILD ABUSE, ELDER AND VULNERABLE ADULT ABUSE) AND SEXUAL ASSAULT WHO COME TO MERCY MEDICAL CENTER AND ITS PHYSICIANS FOR TREATMENT. THIS PROGRAM IMPROVES BALTIMORE'S COORDINATED COMMUNITY RESPONSE TO VICTIMS OF VIOLENCE, AND CREATES AN ALERT WORKFORCE AT MERCY MEDICAL CENTER, SKILLED AT IDENTIFYING AND RESPONDING TO VICTIMS OF FAMILY VIOLENCE. DUE TO ITS LOCATION WITHIN THREE BLOCKS OF THE CITY'S LARGEST HOMELSS SHELTER AT GUILFORD AVENUE AND CLOSE PROXIMITY TO HCH, MERCY MEDICAL CENTER'S ER RECEIVES MANY VISITS FROM HOMELESS PERSONS. WITH DECADES OF EXPERIENCE IN PROVIDING EMERGENT AND URGENT CARE TO POOR AND HOMELESS POPULATIONS, THE HOSPITAL HAS ESTABLISHED KEY SERVICES FOR THE MEDICALLY UNDERSERVED INCLUDING THE FOLLOWING: A FULL TIME SOCIAL WORKER IS A PART OF THE ER TEAM TO COORDINATE CARE AND OTHER SERVICES FOR HOMELESS PATIENTS WHO ARRIVE AT THE ER. ER PHYSICIANS AND NURSES MAKE VISITS TO BALTIMORE CITY SHELTERS TO PROVIDE THE FOLLOWING SERVICES: 1. ADMINISTRATION OF FLU VACCINATIONS TO RESIDENTS 2. PRESENTATIONS ON PARASITES AND INFECTIOUS DISEASE 3. INFECTIOUS DISEASE PREVENTION THE FORENSIC NURSE EXAMINER PROGRAM (FNE) IS HOUSED AT THE HOSPITAL'S ER AND PROVIDES 24/7 CARE TO PATIENTS WHO ARE VICTIMS OF SEXUAL, DOMESTIC, CHILD, ELDER AND INSTITUTIONAL VIOLENCE. FORENSIC NURSES PROVIDE COMPREHENSIVE FORENSIC MEDICAL INTERVIEWS, MEDICAL ASSESSMENTS, AND EVIDENCE COLLECTION, AND ASSURE CRISIS INTERVENTION TO AN EVER INCREASING VOLUME OF UNDERSERVED PATIENTS. DURING FY 2019, THE FNE PROGRAM CONDUCTED 433 EXAMINATIONS AND IS THE DESIGNATED SITE FOR PATIENTS IN BALTIMORE CITY. LOW BIRTH WEIGHT PROGRAM - DEPARTMENT OF OBSTETRICS MERCY MEDICAL CENTER DELIVERED MORE BABIES, 2,720, THAN ANY OTHER HOSPITAL IN BALTIMORE CITY IN FY 2019. LOW BIRTH WEIGHT AND PREMATURITY ARE INTERTWINED AND CORRELATED. AS CITED IN QUESTION #2, LOW BIRTH WEIGHT IS A KEY HEALTH STATUS INDICATOR THAT IS MEASURED AND TRACKED BY BALTIMORE CITY DEPARTMENT OF HEALTH THAT MUST BE DECREASED IN INCIDENCE. THE HOSPITAL HAS TAKEN A LEADERSHIP ROLE THROUGH ITS ACTIVE PARTICIPATION IN ""B'MORE FOR HEALTHLY BABIES"", A LONG TERM INITIATIVE LED BY THE MAYOR'S OFFICE AND MANAGED BY BALTIMORE CITY HEALTH DEPARTMENT TO REDUCE THE INCIDENTS OF LOW BIRTH WEIGHT. DR ROBERT ATLAS, CHAIRMAN OF MERCY MEDICAL CENTER'S DEPARTMENT OF OBSTETRICS AND GYNECOLOGY, HAS A LEADERSHIP ROLE WITHIN THIS WORKGROUP. THE GOALS OF ""B'MORE FOR HEALTHY BABIES"" ARE REDUCTION IN THE FOLLOWING: 1. RATE OF PRE-TERM BIRTHS BY AT LEAST 10% 2. RATE OF LOW BIRTH WEIGHT INFANTS BY AT LEAST 10% 3. THE NUMBER OF DEATHS FROM UNSAFE SLEEP BY AT LEAST 10% OF NOTE 75.0% OF THE BABIES CARED FOR IN MERCY MEDICAL CENTER'S NEONATAL INTENSIVE CARE UNIT WERE EITHER MEDICAID BENEFICIARIES OR UNINSURED/SELF PAY. THIS POPULATION IS ESPECIALLY LINKED WITH LOW BIRTH RATE AND PREMATURITY DUE TO POVERTY THAT CLOSELY RELATES TO UNHEALTHY LIFESTYLES, PARTICULARLY POOR NUTRITION AND INADEQUATE PRENATAL CARE. IN ORDER TO ENSURE 24/7 COVERAGE FOR ITS OBSTETRICAL PATIENTS, REGARDLESS OF THEIR ABILITY TO PAY, MERCY MEDICAL CENTER PROVIDED $1,556,209 IN PHYSICIAN SUBSIDY FOR THIS SPECIALTY. DETERMINING THE NEEDS IN THE COMMUNITY TO BE ADDRESSED SINCE THE INCEPTION OF THE COMMUNITY BENEFIT REPORTING TO HSCRC, MERCY MEDICAL CENTER HAS CONSISTENTLY RANKED AMOUNG THE TOP QUARTILE OF HOSPITALS IN THE STATE OF MARYLAND IN TERMS OF THE PERCENTAGE OF OPERATING EXPENSE DEVOTED TO COMMUNITY NEEDS PROGRAMS. ACCESS TO CARE FOR AT-RISK, UNDERSERVED POPULATIONS HAS LONG BEEN A CORNERSTONE MISSION FOR MERCY MEDICAL CENTER. MAJOR PROGRAMS TO SERVE THIS NEED INCLUDE OUR FUNDING OF DIRECT PHYSICIAN CHARITY CARE ACROSS ALL SPECIALTIES AND THE PHARMACY CHARITY FUND TO PATIENTS WHO ARE UNINSURED AND UNABLE TO PAY. IN ADDITION, MERCY PROVIDES SUBSIDIZED SUPPORT TO ADULT AND PEDIATRIC PHYSICIAN OFFICES LOCATED ON THE MERCY CAMPUS THAT PROVIDES COST EFFICIENT ANACCESSIBLE HELATH CARE REGARDLESS OF INSURANCE STATUS AND ARRANGES FOR SLIDING SCALE FEES TO ASSIST THE UNINSURED WITH PHYSICIAN AND OTHER EXPENSES.BASED UPON PRIOR NEEDS ASSESSMENTS, MERCY MEDICAL CENTER IDENTIFIED THREE KEY AREAS OF FOCUS FOR ""MISSION DRIVEN HEALTH SERVICES"" IN FY 2019: THEY ARE AS FOLLOWS: HOMELESSNESS: THE NEED TO RESPOND TO AND ACTIVELY SUPPORT THE MEDICAL PROFESSIONAL NEEDS OF ORGANIZATIONS THAT SERVE THE HOMELESS POPULATION OF BALTIMORE. EMERGENCY SERVICES: AS PROVIDED THROUGH THE EMERGENCY DEPARTMENT, GIVEN THE LARGE PERCENTAGE OF POOR AND UNINSURED PATIENTS WHO ACCESS THIS SERVICE. LOW BIRTH WEIGHT: MERCY MEDICAL CENTER DELIVERS MORE BABIES TO WOMEN AT OR BELOW THE POVERTY LINE THAN ANY OTHER HOSPITAL IN BALTIMORE. A SIGNIFICANT PERCENTAGE (>10%) OF THESE BIRTHS ARE PREMATURE AND OF LOW BIRTH WEIGHT. ALL OF THESE PROGRAMS ARE INTERTWINED AS THEY SHARE A COMMON THREAD IN THAT ALL UNDERSERVED AND POOR POPULATIONS OF BALTIMORE ARE THE PRIMARY RECIPIENTS OF MEDICAL SERVICES PROVIDED BY MERCY MEDICAL CENTER ON AND OFF ITS CAMPUS. HOMELESSNESS THE NUMBER OF PEOPLE EXPERIENCING HOMELESSNESS HAS GROWN STEADILY OVER THE PAST 20 YEARS IN BALTIMORE AND THROUGHOUT THE ENTIRE NATION. THIS NUMBER IS EXPECTED TO CONTINUE TO RISE GIVEN THE DETERIORATING ECONOMIC CONDITIONS LOCALLY AND NATIONALLY THAT CAUSE HIGH UNEMPLOYMENT, LOSS OF HOMES, REDUCED FEDERAL ASSISTANCE TO MEDICAID AND OTHER SAFETY NET PROGRAMS. BALTIMORE'S HOMELESS POPULATION EXTENDS GREATLY BEYOND THOSE WHO CAN FIND BEDS IN CITY AND OTHER NONPROFIT RUN SHELTERS. MERCY MEDICAL CENTER IS DIRECTLY INVOLVED IN THE PROVISION OF MEDICAL SERVICES TO THE HOMELESS POPULATION THROUGH THREE AREAS. HEALTH CARE FOR THE HOMELESS HEALTH CARE FOR THE HOMELESS (HCH) WAS ESTABLISHED IN 1985 AND PROVIDES ADULT, PEDIATRIC, AND GERIATRIC MEDICAL CARE, DENTAL CARE, MENTAL HEALTH, HIV SERVICES, SOCIAL WORK AND CASE MANAGEMENT, ADDICTION TREATMENT, OUTREACH, PRISON RE-ENTRY, SUPPORTIVE HOUSING, AND ACCESS TO EDUCATION AND EMPLOYMENT. SINCE ITS INCEPTION IN 1985 (A 33-YEAR PARTNERSHIP), MERCY MEDICAL CENTER HAS DIRECTLY EMPLOYED AND PROVIDED ALL OF THE PHYSICIAN AND NURSING STAFF TO HCH FOR MEDICAL SERVICES. WHILE THE HOSPITAL IS REIMBURSED FOR THE DIRECT COSTS OF ITS EMPLOYED CLINICIANS BY HCH, INDIRECT AND OTHER COSTS CONTRIBUTED TO HCH WERE $305,089 IN FY 2019.

202003079349300215,111661359,Part VI - Supplemental Information,"Question 1: Part I, Line 3c: This hospital is an affiliated entity of Northwell Health Inc. (""Northwell""). Northwell uses FPG to determine eligibility and utilizes the New York State Department of Health (NYSDOH) guidelines regarding the consideration of resources. Resource tests cannot be used to deny financial assistance, but only to ""upgrade"" a patient's level of obligation, up to the legal maximum permitted under the financial assistance law. Part I, Line 6a: The Community Benefit report is prepared by the hospital, in conjunction with an affiliated entity (Northwell) of the hospital. The Community Benefit Report is accessible to the public and can be accessed on the Northwell website https://www.northwell.edu/sites/northwell.edu/files/2020-10/nwh_community2 019-FINAL.pdf Part I, 7: Row (a) The cost of charity care was determined by utilizing the ratio of cost to charges (RCC) calculated on Worksheet 2 applied to gross charges written off for patients qualifying for charity under the hospital's financial assistance policy. Bad Debt was not reported in any row of Part I, Line 7. Row (b) The Ratio of Cost to Charges method (or RCC) is used to determine the cost of ancillary services. A RCC is developed from these costs, and that RCC is applied to total Medicaid gross ancillary services charges to determine the cost of services provided to Medicaid patients. Row (e) Costs associated with Community Health Improvement Services were determined by adding indirect or overhead costs to the direct costs of the activity. Indirect costs were calculated as a percentage of direct costs. Direct costs for staff expenses were calculated using average system hourly rates, and were adjusted to account for fringe benefits, using a blended rate based on the ratio of total employee benefit expenses to total salary and wages. Row (f) The Bad Debt Expense that appears on Form 990, Part IX, Line 25 column (A), but not included for purposes of calculating the percentage in this column is equal to the amount reported on Form 990, Part X. The costs related to health professions education were determined by utilizing the step down method of cost finding. Row (h) Costs associated with research activities were determined by adding indirect, or overhead, costs to the direct costs of the activity. Indirect costs were calculated as a percentage of costs. Row (i) The cost of in-kind contributions to community groups is comprised of the direct costs of personnel whose compensated time was donated to various charities and community groups. The salaries and wages were adjusted to include benefits using a rate based on the ratio of total employee benefit expenses to total salary and wages. Indirect costs were calculated as a percentage of direct costs. Column (f) for Rows (c)-(k) The percentage of Net Community Benefit Expense divided by Total Expense for the hospital (to calculate the percent of total expense). Note: For the entire Northwell Health Inc. and affiliates, Part I, Line 7 (Row K, Column F) is approximately 12.7 as a percentage of expenses. Part II: All community building activities improve access to health services and address federal, state, or local public health priorities, as well as leverage public health department activities, and in doing so, they provide relief of government burden. These activities broadly serve low-income, underserved patients, and include: collaboration with various community coalitions, system-wide recycling initiative, organizational response to worldly disasters, and bioterrorism efforts. Northwell has taken the lead in increasing awareness of gun violence as a public health issue. The Gun Violence Prevention Forum brought together physicians, researchers, policy experts, health care executives, NYPD counterterrorism and victims' advocates to share their thoughts on how leaders in health care can address this national public health crisis. Northwell's bioterrorism & disaster preparedness includes Center for Emergency Medical Services, has a designated Bioterrorism Resource Center, and has conducted staff training for more than 100 hospitals and area first responders and invested heavily in the infrastructure needed for large-scale emergencies. During catastrophes (both natural and terrorism), Northwell provides a safe haven for thousands of patients, outside nursing home residents, and community members seeking shelter. Northwell assists with the transport of patients and stand ready to contribute food, medicine, and blankets for both affiliated and non-affiliated hospital patients. Investment in a field hospital has furthered the public health infrastructure needed for mass casualties that could result from a terrorist attack, natural attack, or large-scale emergency. Part III, Line 2: For patients who were determined by Northwell to have the ability to pay but did not, the uncollected amounts are recorded as bad debt expense. The amount of gross charges written off is reduced by any charity care or other discounts provided to the patient, as well as any payments received. Bad debt expense reported on this line is reported net of governmental or private offsetting funds. Part III, Line 3: N/A Part III, Line 4: For patients who were determined by Northwell to have the ability to pay but did not, the uncollected amounts are recorded as bad debt expense. Part III, Line 8: Medicare costs are determined utilizing a combination of the step down method of cost findings and a cost per unit of service. Cost per unit of service is used to calculate the routine cost of services provided to Medicare patients. The Ratio of Cost to Charges method (or RCC) is used to determine the cost of ancillary services. An RCC is developed from these costs, and that RCC is applied to total Medicare gross ancillary services charges to determine the cost of services provided to Medicare patients. Part III, Line 9b: The organization's collection policy is standard to all accounts regardless of insurance status (e.g. insured, underinsured, and uninsured). The hospital's collection policy states that they will not send patient accounts to collection if a decision on a financial assistance application is pending, or if a patient is determined to be eligible for Medicaid at the time services were rendered and for which services Medicaid payment is available. Question 2: NEEDS ASSESSMENT: The Community Health Needs Assessment (CHNA) is performed on an ongoing basis. Northwell conducts and participates in population, demographic, and health status evaluations of our respective hospitals' service areas based on county regions and the communities we serve. There is a special effort to include individuals with health disparities and organizations who serve these communities in the CHNA process. The CHNA includes the analysis of primary and secondary data. Multi-year analyses, trends and projections are developed, which identify areas of need for the continuum of health care services. Primary data is obtained through a combination of qualitative analysis of community-based organization (CBO), informant interviews and surveys, individual community member surveys, and participation in collaborative partner meetings. These meetings include representatives from the Departments of Health, CBOs, academic institutions, government agencies, and hospitals. Ongoing input concerning our communities' needs is also obtained through: our Board of Trustees/Directors who are all area residents and leaders in their respective communities; facility based advisory boards and councils, and; the feedback received by our facility administrators and clinicians that serve on local community agency boards. Secondary data analysis includes: internal hospital data, including Prevention Quality Indicators (PQI); Department of Health Community Health Assessments; local regional NYS Prevention Agenda data sources; and Statewide Planning and Research System (SPARCS) data. The Committee on Community Health, a committee of the Board of Trustees, provides recommendations that concern Northwell's community health priorities and interventions based on the CHNA. Committee discussions focus on New York State (NYS) Prevention Agenda Priority Areas, including strategies and intervention outcomes related to chronic disease prevention especially in at risk and diverse communities (Cancer, Diabetes, CVD, Obesity), healthy safe environments, health access, changes in the built environment - housing and access to affordable food, mental health and substance abuse and need for better health literacy. Regional departments of health (I.E. Nassau County Department of Health, Suffolk County Department of Health Services, and NYC Department of Health and Mental Hygiene) perform additional community health assessments (CHA) with the input of hospital and community stakeholders. These regional partners use strategies such as community member surveys, CBO surveys, and public listening sessions to solicit inform"

RESEARCH HAS CONTINUALLY SHOWN THAT WHEN THE FACTORS INFLUENCING HEALTH ARE EXPLORED, HEALTH CARE ACTUALLY PLAYS THE SMALLEST ROLE PROPORTIONATELY. A REPORT IN THE JOURNAL OF AMERICAN MEDICAL ASSOCIATION AND THE CENTER FOR DISEASE CONTROL (MCGINNIS, 1996) SUGGESTS THAT THE FACTORS IMPACTING HEALTH ARE AS FOLLOWS: LIFESTYLE AND BEHAVIORS, 50%, ENVIRONMENT (HUMAN AND NATURAL), 20%, GENETICS AND HUMAN BIOLOGY, 20%, AND HEALTH CARE, 10%. COMMUNITY BUILDING ACTIVITIES HELP TO ADDRESS THE OTHER INDICATORS OUTSIDE OF THE ROLE TRADITIONALLY PLAYED BY HEALTH-CARE ORGANIZATIONS. THESE ACTIVITIES ARE ALMOST EXCLUSIVELY DONE IN SOME FORM OF PARTNERSHIP IN WHICH THE COMMUNITY OR OTHER ORGANIZATIONS ARE BETTER SUITED TO ADDRESS. HEALTH-CARE ORGANIZATIONS GENERALLY PROVIDE TIMELY AND SPECIFIC RESOURCES TO HELP THESE ISSUES. HEALTH-CARE ORGANIZATIONS CAN BE A RICH AND VALUABLE COMMUNITY RESOURCE IN WAYS NOT TYPICALLY CONSIDERED.

202033079349300023,112868878,PART VI - SUPPLEMENTAL INFORMATION,"Hospital Community Benefit Report IRS Form 990, Schedule H, Part VI, Supplemental Information Question 1: Part I, Line 3c: This hospital is an affiliated entity of Northwell Health Inc. (""Northwell""). Northwell uses FPG to determine eligibility and utilizes the New York State Department of Health (NYSDOH) guidelines regarding the consideration of resources. Resource tests cannot be used to deny financial assistance, but only to ""upgrade"" a patient's level of obligation, up to the legal maximum permitted under the financial assistance law. Part I, Line 6a: The Community Benefit report is prepared by the hospital, in conjunction with an affiliated entity (Northwell) of the hospital. The Community Benefit Report is accessible to the public and can be accessed on the Northwell website https://www.northwell.edu/sites/northwell.edu/files/2020-10/nwh_community2 019-FINAL.pdf Part I, 7: Row (a) The cost of charity care was determined by utilizing the ratio of cost to charges (RCC) calculated on Worksheet 2 applied to gross charges written off for patients qualifying for charity under the hospital's financial assistance policy. Bad Debt was not reported in any row of Part I, Line 7. Row (b) The Ratio of Cost to Charges method (or RCC) is used to determine the cost of ancillary services. A RCC is developed from these costs, and that RCC is applied to total Medicaid gross ancillary services charges to determine the cost of services provided to Medicaid patients. Row (e) Costs associated with Community Health Improvement Services were determined by adding indirect or overhead costs to the direct costs of the activity. Indirect costs were calculated as a percentage of direct costs. Direct costs for staff expenses were calculated using average system hourly rates, and were adjusted to account for fringe benefits, using a blended rate based on the ratio of total employee benefit expenses to total salary and wages. Row (f) The Bad Debt Expense that appears on Form 990, Part IX, Line 25 column (A), but not included for purposes of calculating the percentage in this column is equal to the amount reported on Form 990, Part X. The costs related to health professions education were determined by utilizing the step down method of cost finding. Row (h) Costs associated with research activities were determined by adding indirect, or overhead, costs to the direct costs of the activity. Indirect costs were calculated as a percentage of costs. Row (i) The cost of in-kind contributions to community groups is comprised of the direct costs of personnel whose compensated time was donated to various charities and community groups. The salaries and wages were adjusted to include benefits using a rate based on the ratio of total employee benefit expenses to total salary and wages. Indirect costs were calculated as a percentage of direct costs. Column (f) for Rows (c)-(k) The percentage of Net Community Benefit Expense divided by Total Expense for the hospital (to calculate the percent of total expense). Note: For the entire Northwell Health Inc. and affiliates, Part I, Line 7 (Row K, Column F) is approximately 12.7 as a percentage of expenses. Part II: All community building activities improve access to health services and address federal, state, or local public health priorities, as well as leverage public health department activities, and in doing so, they provide relief of government burden. These activities broadly serve low-income, underserved patients, and include: collaboration with various community coalitions, system-wide recycling initiative, organizational response to worldly disasters, and bioterrorism efforts. Northwell has taken the lead in increasing awareness of gun violence as a public health issue. The Gun Violence Prevention Forum brought together physicians, researchers, policy experts, health care executives, NYPD counterterrorism and victims' advocates to share their thoughts on how leaders in health care can address this national public health crisis. Northwell's bioterrorism & disaster preparedness includes Center for Emergency Medical Services, has a designated Bioterrorism Resource Center, and has conducted staff training for more than 100 hospitals and area first responders and invested heavily in the infrastructure needed for large-scale emergencies. During catastrophes (both natural and terrorism), Northwell provides a safe haven for thousands of patients, outside nursing home residents, and community members seeking shelter. Northwell assists with the transport of patients and stand ready to contribute food, medicine, and blankets for both affiliated and non-affiliated hospital patients. Investment in a field hospital has furthered the public health infrastructure needed for mass casualties that could result from a terrorist attack, natural attack, or large-scale emergency. Part III, Line 2: For patients who were determined by Northwell to have the ability to pay but did not, the uncollected amounts are recorded as bad debt expense. The amount of gross charges written off is reduced by any charity care or other discounts provided to the patient, as well as any payments received. Bad debt expense reported on this line is reported net of governmental or private offsetting funds. Part III, Line 3: N/A Part III, Line 4: For patients who were determined by Northwell to have the ability to pay but did not, the uncollected amounts are recorded as bad debt expense. Part III, Line 8: Medicare costs are determined utilizing a combination of the step down method of cost findings and a cost per unit of service. Cost per unit of service is used to calculate the routine cost of services provided to Medicare patients. The Ratio of Cost to Charges method (or RCC) is used to determine the cost of ancillary services. An RCC is developed from these costs, and that RCC is applied to total Medicare gross ancillary services charges to determine the cost of services provided to Medicare patients. Part III, Line 9b: The organization's collection policy is standard to all accounts regardless of insurance status (e.g. insured, underinsured, and uninsured). The hospital's collection policy states that they will not send patient accounts to collection if a decision on a financial assistance application is pending, or if a patient is determined to be eligible for Medicaid at the time services were rendered and for which services Medicaid payment is available. Question 2: NEEDS ASSESSMENT: The Community Health Needs Assessment (CHNA) is performed on an ongoing basis. Northwell conducts and participates in population, demographic, and health status evaluations of our respective hospitals' service areas based on county regions and the communities we serve. There is a special effort to include individuals with health disparities and organizations who serve these communities in the CHNA process. The CHNA includes the analysis of primary and secondary data. Multi-year analyses, trends and projections are developed, which identify areas of need for the continuum of health care services. Primary data is obtained through a combination of qualitative analysis of community-based organization (CBO), informant interviews and surveys, individual community member surveys, and participation in collaborative partner meetings. These meetings include representatives from the Departments of Health, CBOs, academic institutions, government agencies, and hospitals. Ongoing input concerning our communities' needs is also obtained through: our Board of Trustees/Directors who are all area residents and leaders in their respective communities; facility based advisory boards and councils, and; the feedback received by our facility administrators and clinicians that serve on local community agency boards. Secondary data analysis includes: internal hospital data, including Prevention Quality Indicators (PQI); Department of Health Community Health Assessments; local regional NYS Prevention Agenda data sources; and Statewide Planning and Research System (SPARCS) data. The Committee on Community Health, a committee of the Board of Trustees, provides recommendations that concern Northwell's community health priorities and interventions based on the CHNA. Committee discussions focus on New York State (NYS) Prevention Agenda Priority Areas, including strategies and intervention outcomes related to chronic disease prevention especially in at risk and diverse communities (Cancer, Diabetes, CVD, Obesity), healthy safe environments, health access, changes in the built environment - housing and access to affordable food, mental health and substance abuse and need for better health literacy. Regional departments of health (I.E. Nassau County Department of Health, Suffolk County Department of Health Services, and NYC Department of Health and Mental Hygiene) perform additional community health assessments (CHA) with the input of hospital and community stakeholders. These regional partners use strategies"

ALTHOUGH THE CCTP WAS HIGHLY SUCCESSFUL IN REDUCING READMISSIONS AMONG THE PATIENTS IT SERVED, IT DID NOT ACHIEVE THE PATIENT VOLUME REQUIRED BY CMS, AND THE CONTRACT FOR THIS REGION WAS NOT RENEWED BY CMS IN 2014. ELLIS AND ITS REGIONAL PARTNERS CONTINUED TO DELIVER CCTP-LIKE SERVICES TO PATIENTS INSURED BY A REGIONAL NOT-FOR-PROFIT MANAGED CARE ORGANIZATION. A DSRIP ""CARE TRANSITIONS"" PROJECT NOW SUSTAINS FUNDING FOR CERTAIN PATIENTS.ELLIS AND VNS ALSO LED COMMUNITY PROVIDERS AND COMMUNITY-BASED ORGANIZATIONS IN ESTABLISHMENT OF ONE OF THE FIRST THREE STATE-RECOGNIZED HEALTH HOMES IN UPSTATE NEW YORK. HEALTH HOMES RECEIVE CAPITATED STATE FUNDING TO DELIVER CARE MANAGEMENT SERVICES TO AT-RISK MEDICAID BENEFICIARIES, SPECIFICALLY THOSE WITH TWO OR MORE CHRONIC CONDITIONS, A SEVERE AND PERSISTENT MENTAL HEALTH DIAGNOSIS, OR A DIAGNOSIS OF HIV/AIDS. MUCH OF THE CARE MANAGEMENT IS DELIVERED BY ""DOWNSTREAM"" COMMUNITY-BASED AGENCIES INCLUDING CATHOLIC CHARITIES CAREGIVERS SERVICE AND THE ALLIANCE FOR POSITIVE HEALTH. IN 2018, ELLIS WITHDREW FROM PROVIDING HEALTH HOME SERVICES IN SCHENECTADY, BUT REMAINS AS A ""DOWNSTREAM PROVIDER"" FOR THE REGIONAL CAPITAL REGION HEALTH CONNECTIONS HEALTH HOME.ELLIS ALSO PROVIDES SERVICES AND EXPERTISE AT NO CHARGE TO COMMUNITY ORGANIZATIONS. MEETING ROOMS, INCLUDING AUDITORIUMS AT BOTH THE NOTT STREET AND MCCLELLAN STREET CAMPUSES, ARE MADE AVAILABLE AT NO CHARGE FOR CERTAIN COMMUNITY MEETINGS AND GROUPS, INCLUDING RED CROSS BLOOD DRIVES. MANY BOARD MEMBERS, PHYSICIANS AND OTHER STAFF DONATE THEIR SERVICES TO COMMUNITY ORGANIZATIONS. AS EXAMPLES, FACULTY PHYSICIANS AT THE FAMILY MEDICINE RESIDENCY SERVE AS OFFICERS OR BOARD MEMBERS OF SUCH ORGANIZATIONS AS CORNELL COOPERATIVE EXTENSION, SOUTHERN MEDICAL ASSOCIATION, NEW YORK COLLEGE OF OSTEOPATHIC MEDICINE EDUCATION AND RESEARCH COMMITTEE, HEPATITIS C TASK FORCE OF THE CAPITAL REGION, NEW YORK STATE ACADEMY OF FAMILY PHYSICIANS, AND HOMETOWN HEALTH CENTERS (FQHC) CREDENTIALING COMMITTEE. A FORMER MEMBER OF THE ELLIS BOARD OF TRUSTEES SERVES AS CHAIR OF THE BOARD OF HOMETOWN HEALTH CENTERS, AND THE CURRENT CHAIR OF THE BOARD ALSO CHAIRS THE CITY OF SCHENECTADY MAYOR'S SMART CITY ADVISORY COMMITTEE.ANOTHER EXAMPLE OF ELLIS' COALITION BUILDING ACTIVITIES HAS BEEN ITS PARTICIPATION OVER THE YEARS IN THE SCHENECTADY COUNTY PUBLIC HEALTH SERVICES' FEDERALLY-FUNDED STRATEGIC ALLIANCE FOR HEALTH (SAH), WHICH BRINGS TOGETHER A HOST OF HEALTH CARE AND COMMUNITY ORGANIZATIONS TO ADDRESS CHRONIC DISEASE AND TO PROMOTE DISEASE PREVENTION AND WELLNESS. AN ELLIS REPRESENTATIVE PARTICIPATED WHEN THE SAH BOARD HELD REGULAR MEETINGS. ADDITIONALLY, ELLIS WORKS WITH A NUMBER OF COMMUNITY PARTNERS, SUCH AS THE AMERICAN HEART ASSOCIATION AND THE YMCA, TO PROVIDE HEALTH SCREENINGS TO UNINSURED AND UNDERINSURED POPULATIONS IN OUR SERVICE AREA. IN RECENT YEARS, ELLIS PROVIDED OFFICE SPACE AND OTHER IN-KIND SUPPORT FOR THE STATE-SPONSORED SCHENECTADY COUNTY CANCER SERVICES PROGRAM; AND IN 2019 PROVIDED NO-CHARGE OFFICE SPACE FOR THE VITA INCOME TAX PREPARATION VOLUNTEERS. IN COLLABORATION WITH COMMUNITY PARTNERS, ELLIS OFFERS OUTPATIENT SMOKING CESSATION COURSES AND SPONSORS PEER-DRIVEN MENTAL HEALTH AND CANCER PATIENT SUPPORT GROUPS. AND, ELLIS COOPERATES WITH COMMUNITY GROUPS TO FACILITATE ACCESS TO HEALTHY FOODS FOR PEOPLE THROUGH THE COMMUNITY. IN PAST YEARS, ACTING IN COLLABORATION WITH THE SCHENECTADY COUNTY PLANNING DEPARTMENT AND THE COOPERATIVE EXTENSION, ELLIS HOSTED A WEEKLY FARMERS' MARKET IN THE PARKING LOT OF THE ELLIS HEALTH CENTER DURING THE SUMMER MONTHS. AS PART OF A COUNTY GRANT, PHYSICIANS AT THE FAMILY HEALTH CENTER ""PRESCRIBED"" FRESH VEGETABLES TO AT-RISK PATIENTS. THE ""PRESCRIPTION"" CONSTITUTED A VOUCHER FOR NO-CHARGE LOCALLY-GROWN VEGETABLES WHICH WERE DISTRIBUTED AT A ""FARM STAND"" LOCATED AT THE ELLIS MCCLELLAN STREET HEALTH CENTER. DURING 2019, A ""FOOD FARMACY"" FOOD PANTRY, SPECIFICALLY FOCUSED ON ENSURING THE AVAILABILITY OF HEALTHY FOOD TO PATIENTS RECENTLY DISCHARGED FROM THE HOSPITAL, STARTED ITS SECOND YEAR AT THE ELLIS MCCLELLAN STREET HEALTH CENTER, FUNDED BY A DSRIP GRANT. IN OTHER RECENT YEARS, ELLIS OFFERED USE OF THE PARKING LOT AT THE MCCLELLAN STREET HEALTH CENTER TO THE SCHENECTADY INNER CITY MINISTRY (SICM) MOBILE MEALS TRUCK WHICH PROVIDES FREE BREAKFASTS AND LUNCHES FOR CHILDREN AGE 18 OR UNDER DURING THE SUMMER WHEN SCHOOLS ARE CLOSED. ONE-HUNDRED PERCENT OF CHILDREN ATTENDING THE SCHENECTADY CITY SCHOOL DISTRICT (SCSD) SCHOOLS ARE ELIGIBLE FOR FREE SCHOOL LUNCHES.MEDICAL RESIDENTS FROM THE ELLIS FAMILY MEDICINE RESIDENCY DONATE THEIR TIME AND EXPERTISE TO STAFF FREE COMMUNITY-BASED MEDICAL CLINICS. RESIDENT-STAFFED FREE CLINICS AT THE SCHENECTADY CITY MISSION AND, IN 2018 AND 2019, AT BETHESDA HOUSE SERVE UNINSURED, HOMELESS INDIVIDUALS IN THE CITY OF SCHENECTADY. ELLIS STAFF MEMBERS ALSO SIT ON NUMEROUS COMMUNITY BOARDS AND HEALTHCARE COALITIONS TO TARGET IMPROVEMENTS IN SUCH AREAS AS DIABETES, LONG TERM CARE, CANCER, HOSPITAL READMISSION RATES, WORKFORCE DEVELOPMENT, AND HEALTHY LIVING."

THE ADJUSTED PATIENT CARE COST IS DIVIDED BY ADJUSTED PATIENT CARE CHARGES RESULTING IN THE RATIO.ELLIS BELIEVES THAT THE MEDICARE SHORTFALL REPORTED ON PART III LINE 7 SHOULD BE TREATED AS A COMMUNITY BENEFIT. FIRST, ELLIS IS THE ONLY ACUTE CARE GENERAL HOSPITAL IN SCHENECTADY, AND THUS PROVIDES VITAL HEALTH CARE SERVICES FOR MEDICARE BENEFICIARIES WHICH WOULD OTHERWISE BE UNAVAILABLE IN THE COMMUNITY. SECOND, THE INCOME LEVEL AND POVERTY RATE IN THE COMMUNITY DEMONSTRATE THE CHALLENGES WHICH WOULD BE FACED IF ELLIS WERE NOT ABLE TO PROVIDE CARE TO ALL PATIENTS, REGARDLESS OF ABILITY TO PAY. FOR EXAMPLE, THE MEDIAN HOUSEHOLD INCOME FOR THE CITY IS ONLY ABOUT TWO-THIRDS THAT OF THE COUNTY AS A WHOLE WHICH IN TURN IS BELOW THAT OF THE STATE. THE POVERTY RATE IN THE CITY IS NEARLY 40% HIGHER THAN THAT OF THE COUNTY AS A WHOLE. (US CENSUS BUREAU, STATE AND COUNTY QUICKFACTS, AS ACCESSED APRIL 23, 2019) THIRD, MEDICARE BENEFICIARIES ARE AMONG THOSE AFFECTED BY INCOME DISPARITIES WITHIN SCHENECTADY. NEARLY HALF (46%) OF THE RESIDENTS OF THE LARGELY MINORITY (67% NON-WHITE) HAMILTON HILL NEIGHBORHOOD ARE BELOW THE FEDERAL POVERTY LEVEL; 7.8% OF THESE RESIDENTS ARE 65 YEARS OF AGE OR OLDER (2009-2013 AMERICAN COMMUNITY SURVEY). RESIDENTS OF THIS NEIGHBORHOOD ARE AMONG THE HEAVIEST USERS OF HOSPITAL SERVICES; FOR EXAMPLE, THE RATE OF EMERGENCY DEPARTMENT UTILIZATION FOR FALLS AMONG PERSONS 65 AND OLDER IN HAMILTON HILL IS 52% ABOVE THE STATEWIDE AVERAGE (2010-2014 SPARCS). FINALLY, ABOUT 25% OF ELLIS' MEDICARE DISCHARGES ARE DUAL-ELIGIBLE (ENROLLED IN BOTH MEDICARE AND MEDICAID) WHO, BY VIRTUE OF THEIR MEDICAID ELIGIBILITY, ARE LOW-INCOME INDIVIDUALS. HENCE, THE FINANCIAL LOSSES INCURRED IN TREATING MEDICARE PATIENTS DETRACT FROM THE ABILITY OF THE HOSPITAL TO SERVE OTHER LOW-INCOME PATIENTS AND RESIDENTS, AND THE ABILITY OF THE HOSPITAL TO FUNCTION IN SPITE OF THESE LOSSES REPRESENTS A COMMUNITY BENEFIT."

THE 224-PAGE ASSESSMENT AND ITS 757-PAGE DATA APPENDIX ARE POSTED ON THE ALLIANCE FOR BETTER HEALTH (DSRIP PERFORMING PROVIDER SYSTEM) WEBSITE (HTTPS://ABHEALTH.US/ABOUT/COMMUNITY-NEEDS-ASSESSMENT/).2) THE SCHENECTADY COMMUNITY ACTION PROGRAM (SCAP), A SIGNIFICANT COMMUNITY PARTNER, IS REQUIRED AS A CONDITION OF ITS RECEIPT OF FEDERAL FUNDING TO CONDUCT PARALLEL COMMUNITY NEEDS ASSESSMENTS. A COMPREHENSIVE ASSESSMENT WAS CONDUCTED IN NOVEMBER 2018. THE RESULTS, WHICH PARALLEL THE FINDINGS OF THE OTHER CHNAS, ARE AVAILABLE HERE: HTTP://SCAPNY.ORG/PUBLICATIONS/.ELLIS MONITORS OTHER RESOURCES TO IDENTIFY AND ASSESS COMMUNITY HEALTH CARE NEEDS. THESE INCLUDE:1)INFORMATION FROM COMMUNITY ORGANIZATIONS AS REPORTED AT THE QUARTERLY MEETINGS OF THE SCHENECTADY COALITION FOR A HEALTHY COMMUNITY.2)PATIENT SATISFACTION DATA AS REPORTED FROM FORMAL (E.G., CAHPS) AND INFORMAL (E.G., NURSING ROUNDS) SOURCES.3)COMMUNITY LEADER COMMENTS OBTAINED FROM FORMAL MEETINGS (E.G., CHAMBER OF COMMERCE) AND INFORMAL CONTACT (E.G., PERIODIC MEETINGS WITH THE MAYOR, STATE LEGISLATORS, AND THE LOCAL MEMBER OF CONGRESS).4) AN ANNUAL, ANONYMOUS, FORMAL ASSESSMENT OF ELLIS EMPLOYEE SATISFACTION, AS WELL AS EMPLOYEE COMMENTS RECEIVED THROUGH SUCH SOURCES AS THE COMPLIANCE PROGRAM AND UNION MEETINGS.5) COMPARATIVE DATA OBTAINED FROM REGIONAL ORGANIZATIONS INCLUDING THE MEDICARE MSSP ACO (INNOVATIVE HEALTH ALLIANCE OF NEW YORK) AND THE MEDICAID DSRIP SYSTEM (ALLIANCE FOR BETTER HEALTH).6) COMPARATIVE DATA OBTAINED FROM REGULATORY AGENCIES, SUCH AS THE NEW YORK STATEWIDE PLANNING AND RESEARCH COOPERATIVE SYSTEM (SPARCS), AND FEDERAL HOSPITAL COMPARE.7) COMMENTS RECEIVED FROM PATIENTS AND COMMUNITY MEMBERS THROUGH THE ELLIS WEBSITE ( HTTPS://WWW.ELLISMEDICINE.ORG/PAGES/CONTACT.ASPX ) AND OTHER ONLINE COMMUNICATIONS TOOLS SUCH AS FACEBOOK AND TWITTER."

APPLICATIONS FOR FINANCIAL ASSISTANCE ARE AVAILABLE ONLINE AT THE ELLIS WEBSITE NOTED ABOVE. ADDITIONALLY, ELLIS EMPLOYS FINANCIAL ADVOCATES WHO ASSIST PATIENTS IN DETERMINING THE AVAILABILITY OF AND THEIR ELIGIBILITY FOR GOVERNMENT PROGRAMS INCLUDING MEDICAID, SUBSIDIZED INSURANCE PROGRAMS THROUGH THE NEW YORK STATE OF HEALTH EXCHANGE, AND FREE OR LOW-COST CARE THROUGH THE HOSPITAL'S FINANCIAL ASSISTANCE POLICY. THE FINANCIAL ADVOCATES THEN ASSIST PATIENTS WITH COMPLETING THE NEEDED PAPERWORK, INCLUDING BEDSIDE VISITS AS NECESSARY.FOR A DECADE, ELLIS MEDICINE HAS INCLUDED AFFIRMATIVE FINANCIAL ASSISTANCE OUTREACH AS PART OF ITS COMMUNITY-BASED POPULATION HEALTH PROGRAMS. PRIOR TO CREATION OF THE HEALTH INSURANCE ENROLLMENT PROGRAMS BY THE PATIENT PROTECTION AND AFFORDABLE CARE ACT OF 2010 (PPACA), ELLIS OFFERED MEDICAID ENROLLMENT THROUGH EMPLOYEES ""DEPUTIZED"" BY THE SCHENECTADY COUNTY DEPARTMENT OF SOCIAL SERVICES, THROUGH MEDICAID FACILITATED ENROLLERS EMPLOYED BY THE NOT-FOR-PROFIT HEALTH CAPITAL DISTRICT INITIATIVE (HCDI), AND THROUGH FIDELIS, AT THAT TIME, THE LARGEST OF NEW YORK'S NOT-FOR-PROFIT MEDICAID MANAGED CARE ORGANIZATIONS. WITH THE ADVENT OF THE PPACA, ELLIS BEGAN INVITING ON-SITE SERVICES OF HEALTH INSURANCE NAVIGATORS (ALSO KNOWN AS ""IN PERSON ASSISTORS"") FROM ALL FOUR NOT-FOR-PROFIT ORGANIZATIONS (PUBLIC POLICY AND EDUCATION FUND, HEALTHY CAPITAL DISTRICT INITIATIVE, CAPITAL DISTRICT BLACK CHAMBER OF COMMERCE, AND UNIVERSITY AT ALBANY SCHOOL OF SOCIAL WELFARE) DESIGNATED AS SERVING SCHENECTADY COUNTY PURSUANT TO THE PPACA. NAVIGATORS SEE UNINSURED RESIDENTS AT BOTH THE NOTT STREET AND ELLIS MCCLELLAN STREET HEALTH CENTER CAMPUSES, AS WELL AS AT OTHER COMMUNITY LOCATIONS. ELLIS-EMPLOYED FINANCIAL ADVOCATES ALSO COMPLETED STATE-APPROVED TRAINING AND ARE QUALIFIED AS NEW YORK STATE CERTIFIED APPLICATION COUNSELORS (CACS); TRAINED TO HELP PEOPLE ENROLL BOTH IN MEDICAID AS WELL AS IN ""EXCHANGE"" INSURANCE PRODUCTS.ADDITIONALLY, ELLIS OFFERS ITS FINANCIAL ADVOCATES INFORMATION LINE (518-243-3460) THROUGH WHICH PATIENTS WITHOUT INSURANCE CAN RECEIVE INFORMATION ABOUT HOW MUCH THEIR CARE WILL COST AT ELLIS MEDICINE, INCLUDING INSURANCE ENROLLMENT AND PAYMENT PLANS. ANOTHER TELEPHONE RESOURCE (518-243-1695) PROVIDES CALLERS WITH ESTIMATES OF THE TOTAL COST OF PROCEDURES AND HOSPITALIZATIONS, AS MORE AND MORE PATIENTS ARE PAYING HIGHER DEDUCTIBLES AND ARE CONCERNED ABOUT THE COST TO THEM OUT-OF-POCKET. THIS IS PARTICULARLY SIGNIFICANT IN ELLIS' PRIMARY SERVICE AREA, AS THE LARGEST LOCAL EMPLOYER HAS CONVERTED TO A HIGH-DEDUCTIBLE HEALTH INSURANCE PLAN FOR MOST OF ITS EMPLOYEES."
202033169349305633,141338428,"PART VI, LINE 4:","FOR THE PURPOSES OF DETERMINING COMMUNITY NEEDS PURSUANT TO THE REQUIREMENTS OF THE PATIENT PROTECTION AND AFFORDABLE CARE ACT OF 2010, ELLIS HOSPITAL DEFINES THE ""COMMUNITY"" IT SERVES AS CONSISTING OF SCHENECTADY COUNTY, INCLUDING THE CITY OF SCHENECTADY AND THE TOWNS OF DUANESBURG, GLENVILLE, PRINCETOWN, NISKAYUNA, AND ROTTERDAM. THERE ARE SEVERAL REASONS FOR THIS DEFINITION:1) THE GEOGRAPHY OF SCHENECTADY COUNTY IS VERY SIMILAR TO THE PRIMARY SERVICE AREA (PSA) OF THE HOSPITAL. ELLIS USES AN INDUSTRY-STANDARD DEFINITION (THE CONTIGUOUS ZIP CODES IN WHICH THE FIRST 60% OF THE HOSPITAL'S INPATIENTS LIVE) TO DETERMINE ITS PSA. ELLIS' PSA CONSISTS OF THE ENTIRE RANGE OF 123NN ZIP CODES (12302, 12303, 12304, 12305, 12306, 12307, 12308, AND 12309), WHICH CONSTITUTES ALL OF THE CITY OF SCHENECTADY AND MOST OF THE POPULATION OF THE REST OF SCHENECTADY COUNTY. (THE DESIGN OF THE ZIP CODE SYSTEM IS NOT ALIGNED WITH COUNTY OR OTHER POLITICAL BOUNDARIES. THE RURAL WESTERNMOST PORTION OF SCHENECTADY COUNTY IS NOT INCLUDED IN THE ZIP CODE-DEFINED PSA DUE TO LOW POPULATION, WHILE CERTAIN AREAS OF ALBANY AND SARATOGA COUNTIES DO FALL WITHIN THE SCHENECTADY ZIP CODES.) ALTHOUGH ELLIS ACTIVELY SERVES PEOPLE WITHIN ITS SECONDARY SERVICE AREA (SSA), THE GEOGRAPHIC BOUNDARIES OF THOSE ADDITIONAL ZIP CODES (THE ADDITIONAL CONTIGUOUS ZIP CODES IN WHICH THE NEXT 20% OF INPATIENTS LIVE, FOR AN APPROXIMATE TOTAL OF 80% OF INPATIENT VOLUME) STRETCH ACROSS FIVE COUNTIES AND INCLUDE PORTIONS OF THE SERVICE AREAS OF AT LEAST SIX OTHER HOSPITALS. RETAINING A FOCUS ON THE SCHENECTADY COMMUNITY WILL PERMIT DEVELOPMENT OF AN ACTIONABLE IMPLEMENTATION PLAN WHICH CAN TARGET COHESIVE POPULATIONS.2) POPULATION AND HEALTH DATA ARE COMMONLY AVAILABLE BY COUNTY. THE NEW YORK STATE DEPARTMENT OF HEALTH AND OTHER STATE GOVERNMENT AGENCIES MAINTAIN DATA BY COUNTY, THE HEALTHY CAPITAL DISTRICT INITIATIVE PROVIDES COMPARISON DATA BY COUNTY WITHIN THE REGION, AND DATA COLLECTED BY THE UNITED STATES CENSUS ARE FREQUENTLY AT THE COUNTY AND CITY LEVEL. ALTHOUGH CONVENIENCE IS NOT IN AND OF ITSELF A REASON TO DEFINE ""COMMUNITY,"" THE AVAILABILITY OF SOLID DATA, INCLUDING BASELINE AND COMPARISON DATA, WILL PROVIDE A BETTER BASIS FOR PLANNING, AND AN EXTERNALLY-VERIFIABLE SOURCE FOR OUTCOME MEASURES.3) ELLIS HAS ESTABLISHED STRONG PARTNERSHIPS WITH OTHER HEALTHCARE AND COMMUNITY SERVICE ORGANIZATIONS WHICH ARE LOCATED IN AND SERVE SCHENECTADY COUNTY. THE ""MEDICAL HOME GROUP,"" A LOOSE AFFILIATION OF COMMUNITY ORGANIZATIONS CREATED AT THE TIME OF THE THREE-HOSPITAL CONSOLIDATION, HAS EVOLVED INTO THE SCHENECTADY COALITION FOR A HEALTHY COMMUNITY; OVER 60 COMMUNITY GROUPS INCLUDING BUSINESSES, LOCAL GOVERNMENT AGENCIES, HEALTHCARE AND SOCIAL SERVICES PROVIDERS AND COMMUNITY AGENCIES, FAITH-BASED ORGANIZATIONS, AND ADVOCACY GROUPS WHOSE LEADERS MEET QUARTERLY AT ELLIS. BY FOCUSING ""COMMUNITY"" ON A POPULATION WELL-SERVED BY A COORDINATED ARRAY OF PHYSICAL HEALTH, BEHAVIORAL HEALTH, AND COMMUNITY SERVICE ORGANIZATIONS IN COORDINATION WITH STRONG LOCAL GOVERNMENT AGENCIES, A COMMUNITY-WIDE ACTION PLAN CAN LEVERAGE THE HOSPITAL'S IMPLEMENTATION PLAN THROUGH THE EFFICIENT AND EFFECTIVE USE OF MULTIPLE RESOURCES.4) SELECTION OF SCHENECTADY COUNTY AS THE ""COMMUNITY"" IS CONSISTENT WITH REGULATORY REQUIREMENTS TO ASSURE INCLUSION OF ""MEDICALLY UNDERSERVED, LOW-INCOME, OR MINORITY POPULATIONS,"" AS THESE POPULATIONS REPRESENT A GREATER SHARE OF THE POPULATION IN SCHENECTADY COUNTY THAN THEY WOULD IF DIFFUSED AMONG THE FIVE COUNTIES OF THE SECONDARY SERVICE AREA.SCHENECTADY COUNTY (2018 ESTIMATED POPULATION: 155,350) IS, GEOGRAPHICALLY, THE SECOND SMALLEST COUNTY IN UPSTATE NEW YORK. IT CONSISTS OF FIVE TOWNS, TWO PRIMARILY RURAL AND THREE PRIMARILY SUBURBAN, SURROUNDING THE CENTRALLY-LOCATED CITY OF SCHENECTADY (2018 ESTIMATED POPULATION: 65,575). THE COUNTY IS LOCATED IMMEDIATELY WEST OF THE STATE CAPITAL OF ALBANY AND MANY OF ITS RESIDENTS COMMUTE TO JOBS IN ALBANY AND THE OTHER COUNTIES COMPRISING NEW YORK'S CAPITAL REGION.SCHENECTADY COUNTY PUBLIC HEALTH SERVICES (SCPHS), A UNIT OF COUNTY GOVERNMENT, IS RESPONSIBLE FOR ALL PUBLIC HEALTH AND ENVIRONMENTAL HEALTH ACTIVITIES AND ENFORCEMENT THROUGHOUT THE CITY AND COUNTY. THE COUNTY CONTAINS A SINGLE NON-PROFIT ACUTE CARE HOSPITAL ELLIS HOSPITAL (ALSO KNOWN BY THE TRADE NAME ELLIS MEDICINE), AND A SINGLE FEDERALLY QUALIFIED HEALTH CENTER (FQHC) HOMETOWN HEALTH CENTER. THERE IS ALSO A NON-PROFIT SPECIALTY HOSPITAL (SUNNYVIEW REHABILITATION HOSPITAL) WHICH IS A MEMBER OF THE ALBANY-BASED ST. PETER'S HEALTH PARTNERS SYSTEM. THERE IS ONE MEDICALLY UNDERSERVED POPULATION; THE HOMEBOUND POPULATION OF SCHENECTADY COUNTY (ID #06211). THE ENTIRE CITY OF SCHENECTADY IS A FEDERALLY-DESIGNATED HEALTH PROFESSIONS SHORTAGE AREA (HPSA) FOR THE MEDICAID POPULATION FOR MENTAL HEALTH AND DENTAL HEALTH, AND, SINCE 2019, FOR PRIMARY CARE.

Southwest General Health Center may utilize a third-party to conduct an electronic review of patient information to assess financial need. Relief granted using this method will be identified as presumptive financial assistance. The patient will be notified in writing if the discount is less than 100 and will have an opportunity to submit a financial assistance application if the patient believes that he or she may qualify for more assistance. The review utilizes a healthcare industry- recognized predictive model that is based on public record data basis. The models rule based electronic technology is calibrated to the historical approvals for financial assistance under the general application process and is designed to statistically match the hospitals policy. The model considers multiple decision criteria designed to assess each patient to the same standards as defined in this policy. This ensures that Southwest grants assistance only to patients with characteristics similar to the patients who have qualified based on criteria defined in this policy. This predictive model calculates a socio-economic and financial capacity score that includes estimates for income, assets and liquidity.

Net patient accounts are reduced by an allowance for doubtful receivables based upon the hospital's historical collection experience adjusted for current environmental risks and trends for each major payor source. Significant provision is made for self-pay patient accounts in the period of service based on past collection experience. The hospital's concentration of credit risk related to net patient accounts is limited due to the diversity of patients and payors. Net patient accounts consist of amounts due from governmental programs (primarily Medicare and Medicaid), private insurance companies, managed care programs and patients themselves. Net patient service revenue for services provided to patients who have third-party payor coverage is recognized based on contractual rates for services rendered. The hospital recognizes a significant amount of patient service revenue at the time services are rendered even though it does not assess the patient's ability to pay. As a result, the provision for bad debts is presented as a deduction from patient service revenue (net of contractual provisions and discounts). Amounts recognized are subject to adjustment upon review by third-party payors. For uninsured patients that do not qualify for charity care, the hospital recognizes revenue when services are provided. Based on historical experience, a significant portion of the hospital's uninsured patients will be unable or unwilling to pay for services provided. Thus, the hospital records a significant provision for bad debts related to uninsured patients in the period the services are provided. Any discounts applied to self-pay patients would be deemed either Charity or a contractual adjustment. Bad debt would be based on the balance after the charity or contractual adjustment that is deemed uncollectable following a reasonable collection effort."

CMHP owns two of the three hospitals in this geographic area. The third hospital (not owned by CMHP) is a limited-service for-profit hospital that specializes in outpatient and short-stay surgery, and it does not have an emergency department. Springfield City Proper is predominantly a manufacturing community with jobs still rooted in that industry today. The community's primary demographics are comprised of residents who are: White, Non-Hispanic at 84.4%, African American at 8.1%, Hispanic at 3.2% and Two or more races at 3.4%. 48% of our residents are married while 29% have never married or are Divorced at 13%. 45% of our married households have families while 14% are Single, female parent families. 28% of our residents are individuals living alone. Clark County has higher averages of individuals with Disabilities, Sexually Transmitted Diseases and Chronic Diseases. Additionally, babies in Clark County are more likely to be born below average birth weight and pre-term in comparison with the state averages. Nearly 20% of Clark County women who are pregnant smoke during their pregnancy and severely lack 1st Trimester Prenatal Care - only about 57% receive 1st trimester care. The major health problems and/or leading causes of death in our service area are Cardiovascular disease, Dementia, Diabetes and Cancer.

CMHP is sponsored by the Sisters of Mercy and has been an integral part of the community since 1950. CMHP includes an acute care hospital and a critical care access hospital with approximately 641 licensed beds combined. CMHP is a member of Bon Secours Mercy Health, Inc., a Maryland nonprofit, nonstock membership corporation (BSMH), and all of the other entities that are controlled directly or indirectly by BSMH are described collectively as the System. The System was organized in June 1983 to fulfill the healthcare mission of the United States Province of the Congregation of the Sisters of Bon Secours of Paris, a congregation of religious women of the Roman Catholic Church founded in France in 1824. The System's activities are in the states of Ohio, New York, Pennsylvania, Maryland, Virginia, Kentucky, South Carolina, and Florida, each referred to as a local system. The Ministry of BSMH aids those in need, particularly those who are sick and dying, by offering services that include but are not limited to acute inpatient, outpatient, pastoral, palliative, home health, nursing home, rehabilitative, primary and secondary care and assisted living without regard to race, religion, color, gender, age, marital status, national origin, sexual orientation, or disability. As a member of the Catholic health ministry and a member of BSMH, this organization and its related entities are called to continue the healing ministry of Jesus. We exist to benefit the people living in the communities it serves. Through all of the services offered to the community, the mission is ""to bring compassion to health care and to be good help to those in need, especially those who are poor and dying. As a System of caregivers, we commit ourselves to help bring people and communities to health and wholeness as part of the healing ministry of Jesus Christ and the Catholic Church."" This organization and related organizations share the BSMH Vision. BSMH's vision to partner with communities to create a more humane world, build social justice for all and provide exceptional value for those served is implemented through its Strategic Quality Plan which provides focus in four goal areas for the current three year period (2019-2021). - Co-Create Healthy Communities: We recognize that the factors which drive health outcomes extend well beyond the scope of traditional health care services. Thus, we commit to improve the health of communities through partnership and collaboration with a broad range of constituencies including committed community residents - Be Person Centric: We recognize that those whom we serve are increasingly engaged in their own care and are seeking convenience, affordability and reliability. Thus, we commit to anticipate and respond to the changing expectations of health care consumers, and to ensure that we engage each person in an individualized plan for health with a focus on prevention and wellness. - Serve Those Who Are Vulnerable: We recognize, by our Catholic identity, that the struggle for a more humane world is not an option, but an integral part of spreading the gospel. Thus, we commit to serve those who are vulnerable in many ways, addressing health disparities, sustaining global ministries, healing the environment and working to end violence and oppression. - Strengthen Our Culture and Capabilities: We recognize that the health care delivery system is undergoing rapid change with increasing complexity. Thus, we commit to liberate the potential of our people by strengthening individual and collective capabilities with respect to ministry leadership, knowledge, analytics, innovation and finances.

202003189349305740,440545297,"Schedule H, Part III, Line 4 Bad debt expense - financial statement footnote","FINANCIAL STATEMENT FOOTNOTE REGARDING BAD DEBT EXPENSE: Performance obligations are identified based on the nature of the services provided. Revenue associated with performance obligations satisfied over time is recognized based on actual charges incurred in relation to total expected (or actual) charges. Performance obligations satisfied over time relate to patients receiving inpatient acute care services. The System measures the performance obligation from admission into the hospital to the point when there are no further services required for the patient, which is generally the time of discharge. For outpatient services, the performance obligation is satisfied as the patient simultaneously receives and consumes the benefits provided as the services are performed. In the case of these outpatient services, recognition of the obligation over time yields the same result as recognizing the obligation at a point in time. Management believes this method provides a faithful depiction of the transfer of services over the term of performance obligations based on the inputs needed to satisfy the obligations. As the System's performance obligations relate to contracts with a duration of less than one year, the System has applied the optional exemption provided in the guidance and, therefore, is not required to disclose the aggregate amount of the transaction price allocated to performance obligations that are unsatisfied or partially unsatisfied at the end of the reporting period. The unsatisfied or partially unsatisfied performance obligations referred to above are primarily related to inpatient acute care services at the end of the reporting period. The performance obligations for these contracts are generally completed when the patients are discharged, which generally occurs within days or weeks of the end of the reporting period. The System uses a portfolio approach to account for categories of patient contracts as a collective group rather than recognizing revenue on an individual contract basis. The portfolios consist of major payor classes for inpatient revenue and major payor classes and types of services provided for outpatient revenue. Based on the historical collection trends and other analyzes, the System believes that revenue recognized by utilizing the portfolio approach approximates the revenue that would have been recognized if an individual contract approach were used. The System determines the transaction price, which involves significant estimates and judgment, based on standard charges for goods and services provided, reduced by explicit and implicit price concessions, including contractual adjustments provided to third-party payors, discounts provided to uninsured and underinsured patients in accordance with policy and/or implicit price concessions based on the historical collection experience of patient accounts. The System determines the transaction price associated with services provided to patients who have third-party payor coverage based on reimbursement terms per contractual agreements, discount policies and historical experience. For uninsured patients who do not qualify for charity care, the System determines the transaction price associated with services on the basis of charges, reduced by implicit price concessions. Implicit price concessions included in the estimate of the transaction price are based on historical collection experience for applicable patient portfolios. Patients who meet the System's criteria for charity care are provided care without charge; such amounts are not reported as revenue. Subsequent changes to the estimate of the transaction price are generally recorded as adjustments to patient service revenue in the period of the change."

THE TEXT BELOW WAS OBTAINED FROM THE ENGLEWOOD HOSPITAL AND SUBSIDIARIES AUDITED CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS FOOTNOTES: PATIENT ACCOUNTS RECEIVABLE --------------------------- ACCOUNTS RECEIVABLE ARE RECORDED AT NET REALIZABLE VALUE AT THE TRANSACTION PRICE BASED ON STANDARD CHARGES FOR SERVICES PROVIDED, REDUCED BY CONTRACTUAL ADJUSTMENTS PROVIDED TO THIRD-PARTY PAYORS, DISCOUNTS PROVIDED TO UNINSURED OR UNDERINSURED PATIENTS IN ACCORDANCE WITH THE HOSPITALS POLICIES, AND/OR IMPLICIT PRICE CONCESSIONS PROVIDED TO UNINSURED OR UNDERINSURED PATIENTS, AND DO NOT BEAR INTEREST. SUBSEQUENT CHANGES TO THE ESTIMATE OF THE TRANSACTION PRICE ARE GENERALLY RECORDED AS ADJUSTMENTS TO PATIENT REVENUE IN THE PERIOD OF THE CHANGE. REVENUE RECOGNITION ------------------- NET PATIENT SERVICE REVENUES ARE RECOGNIZED AT THE AMOUNT THAT REFLECTS THE CONSIDERATION TO WHICH THE HOSPITAL EXPECTS TO BE ENTITLED IN EXCHANGE FOR PROVIDING PATIENT CARE. THESE AMOUNTS ARE DUE FROM PATIENTS, THIRD-PARTY PAYORS (INCLUDING COMMERCIAL AND GOVERNMENTAL PROGRAMS), AND OTHERS AND INCLUDES VARIABLE CONSIDERATION FOR RETROACTIVE REVENUE ADJUSTMENTS DUE TO SETTLEMENT OF AUDITS, REVIEWS AND INVESTIGATIONS. GENERALLY, THE HOSPITAL BILLS THE PATIENTS AND THIRD-PARTY PAYORS SEVERAL DAYS AFTER THE SERVICES ARE PERFORMED AND/OR THE PATIENT IS DISCHARGED FROM THE FACILITY. REVENUE IS RECOGNIZED AS PERFORMANCE OBLIGATIONS ARE SATISFIED. PERFORMANCE OBLIGATIONS ARE DETERMINED BASED ON THE NATURE OF THE SERVICES PROVIDED BY THE HOSPITAL. REVENUE FOR PERFORMANCE OBLIGATIONS SATISFIED OVER TIME IS RECOGNIZED BASED ON ACTUAL SERVICES INCURRED IN RELATION TO TOTAL EXPECTED (OR ACTUAL) PAYMENTS. THE HOSPITAL BELIEVES THAT THIS METHOD PROVIDES A FAITHFUL DEPICTION OF THE TRANSFER OF SERVICES OVER THE TERM OF THE PERFORMANCE OBLIGATION BASED ON THE INPUTS NEEDED TO SATISFY THE OBLIGATION. GENERALLY, PERFORMANCE OBLIGATIONS SATISFIED OVER TIME RELATE TO PATIENTS IN THE HOSPITAL RECEIVING INPATIENT ACUTE CARE SERVICES. THE HOSPITAL MEASURES THE PERFORMANCE OBLIGATION FROM ADMISSION INTO THE FACILITY TO THE POINT WHEN IT IS NO LONGER REQUIRED TO PROVIDE SERVICES TO THAT PATIENT, WHICH IS GENERALLY AT THE TIME OF DISCHARGE. REVENUE FOR PERFORMANCE OBLIGATIONS SATISFIED AT A POINT IN TIME ARE RECOGNIZED WHEN SERVICES ARE PROVIDED AND THE HOSPITAL DOES NOT BELIEVE IT IS REQUIRED TO PROVIDE ADDITIONAL SERVICES TO THE PATIENT. GENERALLY, BECAUSE ALL THE HOSPITAL'S PERFORMANCE OBLIGATIONS RELATE TO CONTRACTS WITH A DURATION OF LESS THAN ONE YEAR, THE HOSPITAL HAS ELECTED TO APPLY THE OPTIONAL EXEMPTION PROVIDED IN ACCOUNTING STANDARD CODIFICATION (ASC) 606-10-50-14(A) AND, THEREFORE, THE HOSPITAL IS NOT REQUIRED TO DISCLOSE THE AGGREGATE AMOUNT OF THE TRANSACTION PRICE ALLOCATED TO PERFORMANCE OBLIGATIONS THAT ARE UNSATISFIED OR PARTIALLY UNSATISFIED AT THE END OF THE REPORTING PERIOD. THE UNSATISFIED OR PARTIALLY UNSATISFIED PERFORMANCE OBLIGATIONS REFERRED TO ABOVE ARE PRIMARILY RELATED TO INPATIENT ACUTE CARE SERVICES AT THE END OF THE REPORTING PERIOD. THE PERFORMANCE OBLIGATIONS FOR THESE CONTRACTS ARE GENERALLY COMPLETED WHEN THE PATIENTS ARE DISCHARGED, WHICH GENERALLY OCCURS WITHIN DAYS OR WEEKS OF THE END OF THE REPORTING PERIOD. THE HOSPITAL DETERMINES THE TRANSACTION PRICE BASED ON STANDARD CHARGES FOR SERVICES PROVIDED, REDUCED BY CONTRACTUAL ADJUSTMENTS PROVIDED TO THIRD-PARTY PAYORS, DISCOUNTS PROVIDED TO UNINSURED PATIENTS IN ACCORDANCE WITH THE HOSPITAL'S POLICY, AND/OR IMPLICIT PRICE CONCESSIONS PROVIDED TO UNINSURED PATIENTS. THE HOSPITAL DETERMINES ITS ESTIMATES OF CONTRACTUAL ADJUSTMENTS AND DISCOUNTS BASED ON CONTRACTUAL AGREEMENTS, ITS DISCOUNT POLICIES AND HISTORICAL EXPERIENCE. THE HOSPITAL DETERMINES ITS ESTIMATE OF IMPLICIT PRICE CONCESSIONS BASED ON ITS HISTORICAL COLLECTION EXPERIENCE WITH THIS CLASS OF PATIENTS. NET PATIENT SERVICE REVENUE --------------------------- THE HOSPITAL HAS AGREEMENTS WITH THIRD-PARTY PAYORS THAT PROVIDE FOR PAYMENTS TO THE HOSPITAL AT AMOUNTS DIFFERENT FROM ITS ESTABLISHED RATES. PAYMENT ARRANGEMENTS INCLUDE PROSPECTIVELY DETERMINED RATES PER DISCHARGE, REIMBURSED COSTS, DISCOUNTS FROM CHARGES AND PER DIEM PAYMENTS. NET PATIENT SERVICE REVENUE IS REPORTED AT ESTIMATED NET REALIZABLE AMOUNTS DUE FROM PATIENTS, THIRD-PARTY PAYORS AND OTHERS FOR SERVICES RENDERED AND INCLUDES ESTIMATED RETROACTIVE REVENUE ADJUSTMENTS DUE TO ONGOING AND FUTURE AUDITS, REVIEWS AND INVESTIGATIONS. RETROACTIVE ADJUSTMENTS ARE CONSIDERED IN THE RECOGNITION OF REVENUE ON AN ESTIMATED BASIS IN THE PERIOD THAT RELATED SERVICES ARE RENDERED AND ADJUSTED IN FUTURE PERIODS AS ADJUSTMENTS BECOME KNOWN OR AS YEARS ARE NO LONGER SUBJECT TO SUCH AUDITS, REVIEWS AND INVESTIGATIONS. CHARITY CARE AND COMMUNITY BENEFIT ---------------------------------- IN ACCORDANCE WITH ITS MISSION AND PHILOSOPHY, THE HOSPITAL COMMITS SUBSTANTIAL RESOURCES TO SPONSOR A BROAD RANGE OF SERVICES TO BOTH THE INDIGENT AS WELL AS THE BROADER COMMUNITY. COMMUNITY BENEFITS PROVIDED TO THE INDIGENT INCLUDE THE COST OF PROVIDING SERVICES TO PERSONS WHO CANNOT AFFORD HEALTH CARE DUE TO INADEQUATE RESOURCES AND/OR WHO ARE UNINSURED OR UNDERINSURED. THIS TYPE OF COMMUNITY BENEFIT INCLUDES THE COSTS OF: TRADITIONAL CHARITY CARE; UNPAID COSTS OF CARE PROVIDED TO BENEFICIARIES OF MEDICARE AND MEDICAID AND OTHER INDIGENT PUBLIC PROGRAMS. CHARITY CARE IS PROVIDED BY THE HOSPITAL TO PATIENTS WHO MEET CERTAIN CRITERIA DEFINED BY THE NEW JERSEY DEPARTMENT OF HEALTH (""DOH"") WITHOUT CHARGE OR AT AMOUNTS LESS THAN ESTABLISHED RATES. THE HOSPITAL REDUCES NET REVENUES IN ACCORDANCE WITH THESE CRITERIA. THE HOSPITAL'S RECORDS IDENTIFY AND MONITOR THE LEVEL OF CHARITY CARE IT PROVIDES. COMMUNITY BENEFITS PROVIDED TO THE BROADER COMMUNITY INCLUDE THE COSTS OF PROVIDING SERVICES TO OTHER POPULATIONS WHO MAY NOT QUALIFY AS INDIGENT BUT MAY NEED SPECIAL SERVICES AND SUPPORT. THIS TYPE OF COMMUNITY BENEFIT INCLUDES THE COSTS OF: SERVICES SUCH AS HEALTH PROMOTION AND EDUCATION, HEALTH SCREENINGS, ALL OF WHICH ARE NOT BILLED OR CAN BE OPERATED ONLY ON A DEFICIT BASIS; UNPAID PORTIONS OF TRAINING HEALTH PROFESSIONALS SUCH AS MEDICAL RESIDENTS, STUDENTS IN ALLIED HEALTH PROFESSIONS; AND THE UNPAID PORTIONS OF TESTING MEDICAL EQUIPMENT AND CONTROLLED STUDIES OF THERAPEUTIC PROTOCOLS. THE COSTS OF CHARITY CARE AND OTHER COMMUNITY BENEFIT ACTIVITIES ARE DERIVED FROM BOTH ESTIMATED AND ACTUAL DATA. THE ESTIMATED COST OF CHARITY CARE INCLUDES THE DIRECT AND INDIRECT COST OF PROVIDING SUCH SERVICES AND IS ESTIMATED UTILIZING THE HOSPITAL'S RATIO OF COST TO GROSS CHARGES, WHICH IS THEN MULTIPLIED BY THE GROSS UNCOMPENSATED CHARGES ASSOCIATED WITH PROVIDING CARE TO CHARITY PATIENTS. THE HOSPITAL RECEIVES PAYMENTS FROM THE NEW JERSEY HEALTH CARE SUBSIDY FUNDS FOR CHARITY CARE AND SUCH AMOUNTS TOTALED APPROXIMATELY $1,100,000 AND $900,000 FOR THE YEARS ENDED DECEMBER 31, 2019 AND 2018, RESPECTIVELY. THIS AMOUNT IS SUBJECT TO CHANGE FROM YEAR TO YEAR BASED ON AVAILABLE STATE AMOUNTS AND ALLOCATION METHODOLOGIES. CHARITY CARE SUBSIDIES AND DISTRIBUTIONS SUBSEQUENT TO JUNE 30, 2020 ARE PRESENTLY UNKNOWN. OTHER THIRD-PARTY PAYORS ------------------------ THE HOSPITAL ALSO HAS ENTERED INTO PAYMENT AGREEMENTS WITH CERTAIN COMMERCIAL INSURANCE CARRIERS AND HEALTH MAINTENANCE ORGANIZATIONS. THE BASIS FOR PAYMENT TO THE HOSPITAL UNDER THESE AGREEMENTS INCLUDES PROSPECTIVELY DETERMINED RATES PER DISCHARGE OR DAYS OF HOSPITALIZATION AND DISCOUNTS FROM ESTABLISHED CHARGES. SOME OF THESE AGREEMENTS HAVE RETROSPECTIVE AUDIT CLAUSES, ALLOWING THE PAYOR TO REVIEW AND ADJUST CLAIMS SUBSEQUENT TO INITIAL PAYMENT. THE HOSPITAL RECOGNIZES PATIENT SERVICE REVENUE ASSOCIATED WITH SERVICES PROVIDED TO PATIENTS WHO HAVE THIRD-PARTY PAYOR COVERAGE ON THE BASIS OF THESE ESTABLISHED RATES FOR THE SERVICES RENDERED. FOR UNINSURED PATIENTS THAT DO NOT QUALIFY FOR CHARITY CARE, THE HOSPITAL RECOGNIZES REVENUES ON THE BASIS OF ITS STANDARD RATES, DISCOUNTED IN ACCORDANCE WITH THE HOSPITAL'S POLICY. ON THE BASIS OF HISTORICAL EXPERIENCE, A SIGNIFICANT PORTION OF THE HOSPITAL'S UNINSURED PATIENTS WILL BE UNABLE OR UNWILLING TO PAY FOR THE SERVICES PROVIDED. THUS, THE HOSPITAL RECORDS A SIGNIFICANT PROVISION OF BAD DEBTS RELATED TO UNINSURED PATIENTS IN THE PERIOD THE SERVICES ARE PROVIDED. FOR THE YEARS ENDED DECEMBER 31, 2019 AND 2018, NET PATIENT SERVICE REVENUE WAS INCREASED BY APPROXIMATELY $17,601,000 AND $9,820,000, RESPECTIVELY, FOR FAVORABLE ADJUSTMENTS AND SETTLEMENTS RELATED TO PRIOR YEARS."
202023149349304507,221487173,"SCHEDULE H, PART III, SECTION B; QUESTION 8","MEDICARE COSTS WERE DERIVED FROM THE 2019 MEDICARE COST REPORT. THE ORGANIZATION FEELS THAT MEDICARE UNDERPAYMENTS (SHORTFALL), BAD DEBT AND ASSOCIATED COSTS ARE COMMUNITY BENEFIT AND ARE INCLUDABLE ON THE FORM 990, SCHEDULE H, PART I. AS OUTLINED MORE FULLY BELOW, THE ORGANIZATION BELIEVES THAT THESE SERVICES AND RELATED COSTS PROMOTE THE HEALTH OF THE COMMUNITY AS A WHOLE AND ARE RENDERED IN CONJUNCTION WITH THE ORGANIZATION'S CHARITABLE TAX-EXEMPT PURPOSES AND MISSION IN PROVIDING MEDICALLY NECESSARY HEALTHCARE SERVICES TO ALL INDIVIDUALS IN A NON-DISCRIMINATORY MANNER WITHOUT REGARD TO RACE, COLOR, CREED, SEX, NATIONAL ORIGIN OR ABILITY TO PAY AND CONSISTENT WITH THE COMMUNITY BENEFIT STANDARD PROMULGATED BY THE IRS. THE COMMUNITY BENEFIT STANDARD IS THE CURRENT STANDARD FOR A HOSPITAL FOR RECOGNITION AS A TAX-EXEMPT AND CHARITABLE ORGANIZATION UNDER INTERNAL REVENUE CODE (""IRC"") 501(C)(3). THE ORGANIZATION IS RECOGNIZED AS A TAX-EXEMPT ENTITY AND CHARITABLE ORGANIZATION UNDER 501(C)(3) OF THE IRC. ALTHOUGH THERE IS NO DEFINITION IN THE TAX CODE FOR THE TERM ""CHARITABLE"" A REGULATION PROMULGATED BY THE DEPARTMENT OF THE TREASURY PROVIDES SOME GUIDANCE AND STATES THAT ""THE TERM CHARITABLE IS USED IN SECTION 501(C)(3) IN ITS GENERALLY ACCEPTED LEGAL SENSE,PROVIDES EXAMPLES OF CHARITABLE PURPOSES, INCLUDING THE RELIEF OF THE POOR OR UNPRIVILEGED; THE PROMOTION OF SOCIAL WELFARE; AND THE ADVANCEMENT OF EDUCATION, RELIGION, AND SCIENCE. NOTE IT DOES NOT EXPLICITLY ADDRESS THE ACTIVITIES OF HOSPITALS. IN THE ABSENCE OF EXPLICIT STATUTORY OR REGULATORY REQUIREMENTS APPLYING THE TERM ""CHARITABLE"" TO HOSPITALS, IT HAS BEEN LEFT TO THE IRS TO DETERMINE THE CRITERIA HOSPITALS MUST MEET TO QUALIFY AS IRC 501(C)(3) CHARITABLE ORGANIZATIONS. THE ORIGINAL STANDARD WAS KNOWN AS THE CHARITY CARE STANDARD. THIS STANDARD WAS REPLACED BY THE IRS WITH THE COMMUNITY BENEFIT STANDARD WHICH IS THE CURRENT STANDARD. CHARITY CARE STANDARD IN 1956, THE IRS ISSUED REVENUE RULING 56-185, WHICH ADDRESSED THE REQUIREMENTS HOSPITALS NEEDED TO MEET IN ORDER TO QUALIFY FOR IRC 501(C)(3) STATUS. ONE OF THESE REQUIREMENTS IS KNOWN AS THE ""CHARITY CARE STANDARD."" UNDER THE STANDARD, A HOSPITAL MUST PROVIDE, TO THE EXTENT OF ITS FINANCIAL ABILITY, FREE OR REDUCED-COST CARE TO PATIENTS WHO CANNOT PAY FOR SUCH SERVICES. A HOSPITAL THAT EXPECTED FULL PAYMENT DID NOT, ACCORDING TO THE RULING, PROVIDE CHARITY CARE BASED ON THE FACT THAT SOME PATIENTS ULTIMATELY FAILED TO PAY. THE RULING EMPHASIZED THAT A LOW LEVEL OF CHARITY CARE DID NOT NECESSARILY MEAN THAT A HOSPITAL HAD FAILED TO MEET THE REQUIREMENT SINCE THAT LEVEL COULD REFLECT ITS FINANCIAL ABILITY TO PROVIDE SUCH CARE. THE RULING ALSO NOTED THAT PUBLICLY SUPPORTED COMMUNITY HOSPITALS WOULD NORMALLY QUALIFY AS CHARITABLE ORGANIZATIONS BECAUSE THEY SERVE THE ENTIRE COMMUNITY AND A LOW LEVEL OF CHARITY CARE WOULD NOT AFFECT A HOSPITAL'S EXEMPT STATUS IF IT WAS DUE TO THE SURROUNDING COMMUNITY'S LACK OF CHARITABLE DEMANDS. COMMUNITY BENEFIT STANDARD IN 1969, THE IRS ISSUED REVENUE RULING 69-545, WHICH ""REMOVED"" FROM REVENUE RULING 56-185 ""THE REQUIREMENTS RELATING TO CARING FOR PATIENTS WITHOUT CHARGE OR AT RATES BELOW COST."" UNDER THE STANDARD DEVELOPED IN REVENUE RULING 69-545, WHICH IS KNOWN AS THE ""COMMUNITY BENEFIT STANDARD,"" HOSPITALS ARE JUDGED ON WHETHER THEY PROMOTE THE HEALTH OF A BROAD CLASS OF INDIVIDUALS IN THE COMMUNITY. THE RULING INVOLVED A HOSPITAL THAT ONLY ADMITTED INDIVIDUALS WHO COULD PAY FOR THE SERVICES (BY THEMSELVES, PRIVATE INSURANCE, OR PUBLIC PROGRAMS SUCH AS MEDICARE), BUT OPERATED A FULL-TIME EMERGENCY ROOM THAT WAS OPEN TO EVERYONE. THE IRS RULED THAT THE HOSPITAL QUALIFIED AS A CHARITABLE ORGANIZATION BECAUSE IT PROMOTED THE HEALTH OF PEOPLE IN ITS COMMUNITY. THE IRS REASONED THAT BECAUSE THE PROMOTION OF HEALTH WAS A CHARITABLE PURPOSE ACCORDING TO THE GENERAL LAW OF CHARITY, IT FELL WITHIN THE ""GENERALLY ACCEPTED LEGAL SENSE"" OF THE TERM ""CHARITABLE,"" AS REQUIRED BY THE DEPARTMENT OF TREASURY REG. 1.501(C)(3)-1(D)(2). THE IRS RULING STATED THAT THE PROMOTION OF HEALTH, LIKE THE RELIEF OF POVERTY AND THE ADVANCEMENT OF EDUCATION AND RELIGION, IS ONE OF THE PURPOSES IN THE GENERAL LAW OF CHARITY THAT IS DEEMED BENEFICIAL TO THE COMMUNITY AS A WHOLE EVEN THOUGH THE CLASS OF BENEFICIARIES ELIGIBLE TO RECEIVE A DIRECT BENEFIT FROM ITS ACTIVITIES DOES NOT INCLUDE ALL MEMBERS OF THE COMMUNITY, SUCH AS INDIGENT MEMBERS OF THE COMMUNITY, PROVIDED THAT THE CLASS IS NOT SO SMALL THAT ITS RELIEF IS NOT OF BENEFIT TO THE COMMUNITY. THE IRS CONCLUDED THAT THE HOSPITAL WAS ""PROMOTING THE HEALTH OF A CLASS OF PERSONS THAT IS BROAD ENOUGH TO BENEFIT THE COMMUNITY"" BECAUSE ITS EMERGENCY ROOM WAS OPEN TO ALL AND IT PROVIDED CARE TO EVERYONE WHO COULD PAY, WHETHER DIRECTLY OR THROUGH THIRD-PARTY REIMBURSEMENT. OTHER CHARACTERISTICS OF THE HOSPITAL THAT THE IRS HIGHLIGHTED INCLUDED THE FOLLOWING: ITS SURPLUS FUNDS WERE USED TO IMPROVE PATIENT CARE, EXPAND HOSPITAL FACILITIES, AND ADVANCE MEDICAL TRAINING, EDUCATION AND RESEARCH; IT WAS CONTROLLED BY A BOARD OF TRUSTEES THAT CONSISTED OF INDEPENDENT CIVIC LEADERS; AND HOSPITAL MEDICAL STAFF PRIVILEGES WERE AVAILABLE TO ALL QUALIFIED PHYSICIANS. THE AMERICAN HOSPITAL ASSOCIATION (""AHA"") FEELS THAT MEDICARE UNDERPAYMENTS (SHORTFALL) AND BAD DEBT ARE COMMUNITY BENEFIT AND THUS INCLUDABLE ON THE FORM 990, SCHEDULE H, PART I. THIS ORGANIZATION AGREES WITH THE AHA'S POSITION. AS OUTLINED IN THE AHA'S LETTER TO THE IRS DATED AUGUST 21, 2007 WITH RESPECT TO THE FIRST PUBLISHED DRAFT OF THE NEW FORM 990 AND SCHEDULE H, THE AHA FELT THAT THE IRS SHOULD INCORPORATE THE FULL VALUE OF THE COMMUNITY BENEFIT THAT HOSPITALS PROVIDE BY COUNTING MEDICARE UNDERPAYMENTS (SHORTFALL) AS QUANTIFIABLE COMMUNITY BENEFIT FOR THE FOLLOWING REASONS: - PROVIDING CARE FOR THE ELDERLY AND SERVING MEDICARE PATIENTS IS AN ESSENTIAL PART OF THE COMMUNITY BENEFIT STANDARD - MEDICARE, LIKE MEDICAID, DOES NOT PAY THE FULL COST OF CARE. FROM THE LATEST DATA PROVIDED BY THE AHA, MEDICARE REIMBURSES HOSPITALS ONLY 87 CENTS FOR EVERY DOLLAR THEY SPEND TO TAKE CARE OF MEDICARE PATIENTS. - MANY MEDICARE BENEFICIARIES, LIKE THEIR MEDICAID COUNTERPARTS, ARE POOR. MORE THAN 42 PERCENT OF MEDICARE SPENDING IS FOR BENEFICIARIES WHOSE INCOME IS BELOW 200 PERCENT OF THE FEDERAL POVERTY LEVEL. MANY OF THOSE MEDICARE BENEFICIARIES ARE ALSO ELIGIBLE FOR MEDICAID -- SO CALLED ELIGIBLE."" THERE IS EVERY COMPELLING PUBLIC POLICY REASON TO TREAT MEDICARE AND MEDICAID UNDERPAYMENTS SIMILARLY FOR PURPOSES OF A HOSPITAL'S COMMUNITY BENEFIT AND INCLUDE THESE COSTS ON FORM 990, SCHEDULE H, PART I. MEDICARE UNDERPAYMENT MUST BE SHOULDERED BY THE HOSPITAL IN ORDER TO CONTINUE TREATING THE COMMUNITY'S ELDERLY AND POOR. THESE UNDERPAYMENTS REPRESENT A REAL COST OF SERVING THE COMMUNITY AND SHOULD COUNT AS A QUANTIFIABLE COMMUNITY BENEFIT. BOTH THE AHA AND THIS ORGANIZATION ALSO FEEL THAT PATIENT BAD DEBT IS A COMMUNITY BENEFIT AND THUS INCLUDABLE ON THE FORM 990, SCHEDULE H, PART I. LIKE MEDICARE UNDERPAYMENT (SHORTFALLS), THERE ALSO ARE COMPELLING REASONS THAT PATIENT BAD DEBT SHOULD BE COUNTED AS QUANTIFIABLE COMMUNITY BENEFIT AS FOLLOWS: - A SIGNIFICANT MAJORITY OF BAD DEBT IS ATTRIBUTABLE TO LOW-INCOME PATIENTS, WHO, FOR MANY REASONS, DECLINE TO COMPLETE THE FORMS REQUIRED TO ESTABLISH ELIGIBILITY FOR HOSPITALS' CHARITY CARE OR THOSE WHO DO NOT PAY ALL, OR A PORTION OF THE ALREADY DISCOUNTED BILLED AMOUNTS UNDER OUR FINANCIAL ASSISTANCE POLICY. A 2006 CONGRESSIONAL BUDGET OFFICE (""CBO"") REPORT, NONPROFIT HOSPITALS AND THE PROVISION OF COMMUNITY BENEFITS, CITED TWO STUDIES INDICATING THAT ""THE GREAT MAJORITY OF BAD DEBT WAS ATTRIBUTABLE TO PATIENTS WITH INCOMES BELOW 200% OF THE FEDERAL POVERTY LINE."" - THE REPORT ALSO NOTED THAT A SUBSTANTIAL PORTION OF BAD DEBT IS PENDING CHARITY CARE. UNLIKE BAD DEBT IN OTHER INDUSTRIES, HOSPITAL BAD DEBT IS COMPLICATED BY THE FACT THAT HOSPITALS FOLLOW THEIR MISSION TO THE COMMUNITY AND TREAT EVERY PATIENT THAT COMES THROUGH THEIR EMERGENCY DEPARTMENT, REGARDLESS OF ABILITY TO PAY. PATIENTS WHO HAVE OUTSTANDING BILLS ARE NOT TURNED AWAY, UNLIKE OTHER INDUSTRIES. BAD DEBT IS FURTHER COMPLICATED BY THE AUDITING INDUSTRY'S STANDARDS ON REPORTING CHARITY CARE. MANY PATIENTS CANNOT OR DO NOT PROVIDE THE NECESSARY, EXTENSIVE DOCUMENTATION REQUIRED TO BE DEEMED CHARITY CARE BY AUDITORS. AS A RESULT, ROUGHLY 40% OF BAD DEBT IS PENDING CHARITY CARE. THE CBO CONCLUDED THAT ITS FINDINGS ""SUPPORT THE VALIDITY OF THE USE OF UNCOMPENSATED CARE [BAD DEBT AND CHARITY CARE] AS A MEASURE OF COMMUNITY BENEFIT"" ASSUMING THE FINDINGS ARE GENERALIZABLE NATIONWIDE; THE EXPERIENCE OF HOSPITALS AROUND THE NATION REINFORCES THAT THEY ARE GENERALIZABLE. AS OUTLINED BY THE AHA, DESPITE THE HOSPITAL'S BEST EFFORTS AND DUE DILIGENCE, PATIENT BAD DEBT IS A PART OF THE HOSPITAL'S MISSION AND CHARITABLE PURPOSES. BAD DEBT REPRESENTS PART OF THE BURDEN HOSPITALS SHOULDER IN SERVING ALL PATIENTS RE"

RESEARCH HAS CONTINUALLY SHOWN THAT WHEN THE FACTORS INFLUENCING HEALTH ARE EXPLORED, HEALTH CARE ACTUALLY PLAYS THE SMALLEST ROLE PROPORTIONATELY. A REPORT IN THE JOURNAL OF AMERICAN MEDICAL ASSOCIATION AND THE CENTER FOR DISEASE CONTROL (MCGINNIS, 1996) SUGGESTS THAT THE FACTORS IMPACTING HEALTH ARE AS FOLLOWS: LIFESTYLE AND BEHAVIORS, 50%, ENVIRONMENT (HUMAN AND NATURAL), 20%, GENETICS AND HUMAN BIOLOGY, 20%, AND HEALTH CARE, 10%. COMMUNITY BUILDING ACTIVITIES HELP TO ADDRESS THE OTHER INDICATORS OUTSIDE OF THE ROLE TRADITIONALLY PLAYED BY HEALTH-CARE ORGANIZATIONS. THESE ACTIVITIES ARE ALMOST EXCLUSIVELY DONE IN SOME FORM OF PARTNERSHIP IN WHICH THE COMMUNITY OR OTHER ORGANIZATIONS ARE BETTER SUITED TO ADDRESS. HEALTH-CARE ORGANIZATIONS GENERALLY PROVIDE TIMELY AND SPECIFIC RESOURCES TO HELP THESE ISSUES. HEALTH-CARE ORGANIZATIONS CAN BE A RICH AND VALUABLE COMMUNITY RESOURCE IN WAYS NOT TYPICALLY CONSIDERED. OFTEN THE MOST EFFECTIVE WAY TO HELP IMPACT AND IMPROVE THE COMMUNITY HEALTH STATUS IS TO SUPPORT OTHER AGENCIES AND ORGANIZATIONS IN A VARIETY OF WAYS OUTSIDE OF HEALTH SERVICES. THIS IS OFTEN DONE THROUGH CASH OR IN-KIND SERVICES TO SUPPORT OTHER NON-PROFITS, DONATIONS OF DURABLE MEDICAL EQUIPMENT AND SUPPLIES TO CERTAIN AGENCIES, OR THROUGH LEADERSHIP AND EDUCATIONAL EXPERTISE. TRINITY MEDICAL CENTER CONTRIBUTES FINANCIALLY TO A WIDE VARIETY OF COMMUNITY ORGANIZATIONS THAT ADDRESS THE BROADER NEEDS OF THE COMMUNITY. THESE DONATIONS ALLOW OTHER NON-PROFIT ORGANIZATIONS TO FULFILL THEIR MISSIONS TO IMPROVE THE WELL BEING OF THE COMMUNITY AND CONTRIBUTE TO ITS OVERALL HEALTH STATUS IN WAYS THAT MAY DIFFER FROM THE DIRECT SERVICES OF THE HOSPITAL ORGANIZATION AND MAXIMIZE THE RESOURCES THEY HAVE TO WORK WITH. TRINITY MEDICAL CENTER EMPLOYEES ARE ACTIVE IN EDUCATING PARTNERS ON A WIDE VARIETY OF HEALTH SUBJECTS THAT ADVANCE THEIR WORK. FURTHER, TRINITY MEDICAL CENTER EMPLOYEES ARE MEMBERS OF MANY NON-PROFIT BOARDS TO PROVIDE LEADERSHIP OR COLLABORATE TO ADDRESS COMPLEX HEALTH ISSUES. THESE TYPES OF ACTIVITIES SPEAK TO THE BREADTH AND CAPACITY THAT THE HOSPITAL HAS IN IMPACTING THE HEALTH STATUS OF THE COMMUNITY IN A COMPREHENSIVE AND INTENTIONAL APPROACH."

IN THE SAME YEAR, THE TRINITY REGIONAL HEALTH SYSTEM BOARD OF DIRECTORS APPROVED THE FINDINGS OF THE COMMUNITY HEALTH NEEDS ASSESSMENT AND COMMUNITY HEALTH IMPROVEMENT PLAN (IMPLEMENTATION PLAN) STRATEGIES FOR 2019-2021.COLLABORATION HAS BEEN ESSENTIAL TO ADDRESSING THE NEEDS OF THE COMMUNITY. STRONG RELATIONSHIPS HAVE BEEN DEVELOPED WITH VARIOUS ORGANIZATIONS TO HELP MEET THE HEALTH NEEDS OF THE COMMUNITY. COMMUNITY PARTNERS INCLUDE BOYS & GIRLS CLUB, BIG BROTHERS BIG SISTERS, GLOBAL COMMUNITIES, NAMI, RIVER BEND FOODBANK, QUAD CITIES VET CENTER, AND LOCAL SCHOOL DISTRICTS ON BOTH THE ILLINOIS AND IOWA SIDE TO NAME A FEW. THROUGH THESE RELATIONSHIPS WE HAVE BEEN ABLE TO PROVIDE EDUCATION, AWARENESS, CONDUCT SCREENINGS, MAKE REFERRALS FOR ADDITIONAL SERVICES, AND HELP THE COMMUNITY UNDERSTAND WHEN, WHERE, AND HOW TO ACCESS THE PROPER TYPE OF CARE TO MEET THEIR NEEDS. IN 2018, UNITYPOINT HEALTH LAUNCHED A THREE-YEAR PRESCRIPTION DRUG SAFETY PROGRAM INITIATIVE. THE PROGRAM, PROVIDED BY UNITYPOINT HEALTH AT NO COST TO STUDENTS OR SCHOOLS, IS DESIGNED TO COMBAT THE OPIOID AND PRESCRIPTION DRUG ABUSE CRISIS BY BRINGING EDUCATION BEST PRACTICES AND DIGITAL TECHNOLOGY TO SCHOOLS NATIONWIDE. THE PLATFORM WAS ROLLED OUT TO SEVEN SCHOOLS THROUGHOUT SCOTT, MUSCATINE, ROCK ISLAND, AND HENRY COUNTY. NEARLY 250 STUDENTS USED THE PROGRAM WITH A TOTAL OF 117 LEARNING HOURS. THERE'S HAS BEEN A LOT OF GREAT FEEDBACK FROM THE PROGRAM, MOST NOTABLY THAT 90% OF STUDENTS FELT THEY HAD THE SKILLS NEEDED TO REFUSE PRESCRIPTION DRUGS. THIS IS JUST ONE EXAMPLE OF THE PROACTIVE WORK BEING DONE TO COMBAT CHALLENGES WE'RE FACING IN OUR COMMUNITY. UNITYPOINT HEALTH - TRINITY IS COMMITTED TO CONTINUING OUR EFFORT TO DEVELOP PARTNERSHIP OPPORTUNITIES THROUGH OUR SPONSORSHIP PROCESS. OUR ORGANIZATION'S MISSION IS TO ""IMPROVE THE HEALTH OF THE PEOPLE AND COMMUNITIES WE SERVE, AND WE HAVE BEEN INTENTIONAL ABOUT THE TYPES OF ACTIVITIES AND ORGANIZATIONS WE SPONSOR. THE MAJORITY OF SPONSORSHIPS WE PROVIDE TO THE COMMUNITY ARE DIRECTLY ALIGNED WITH THE NEEDS IDENTIFIED IN THE COMMUNITY HEALTH NEEDS ASSESSMENT, AND THE KEY FOCUS AREAS FOR THE COMMUNITY HEALTH IMPROVEMENT PLAN. THERE HAS ALSO BEEN AN INTENTIONAL EFFORT TO GO BEYOND THE SPONSORSHIP EXCHANGE WITH ORGANIZATIONS IN ORDER TO WORK WITH THEM TO DEVELOP STRATEGIES AND PROGRAMING TO REACH THE COMMUNITY WITH HEALTH EDUCATION AND SERVICES. IN 2018, WE BEGAN LOOKING AT ORGANIZATIONS WE WEREN'T ABLE TO SPONSORS TO DEVELOP PARTNERSHIPS WITH THEM AS WELL TO EXPAND OUR OUTREACH EFFORTS. THIS HAS ALLOWED US TO REMAIN AND VALUABLE COMMUNITY PARTNER AND STRENGTHENS OUR TIES WITHIN THE COMMUNITIES WE SERVE. WE WILL CONTINUE TO ADVANCE THESE TYPES OF OPPORTUNITIES AND OTHERS AS THEY ARE PRESENTED. A GREAT EXAMPLE OF THIS IS A PARTNERSHIP THAT FORMED BETWEEN UNITYPOINT HEALTH - TRINITY, WORLD RELIEF, AND THE IMMIGRANT AND REFUGEE COMMUNITY. TRINITY'S PARISH NURSE DEPARTMENT WAS CONTACTED BY A LOCAL PASTOR IN THE BURMESE COMMUNITY IN THE QUAD CITIES. THE PASTOR WAS CONCERNED ABOUT THE PREGNANT WOMEN IN HIS CONGREGATION AND THE UNFAMILIARITY WITH HAVING CHILD IN THE UNITED STATES. AS A RESULT OF THE CONCERN, FOCUS GROUPS WERE HELD TRINITY'S LABOR/DELIVERY TEAM, THE BURMESE COMMUNITY, AND AFRICAN IMMIGRANT COMMUNITY WITH ASSISTANCE FROM WORLD RELIEF. FOLLOWING THE FOCUS GROUPS, PRENATAL CLASSES WERE HELD TO HELP EASE THE STRESS OF EXPECTING MOTHERS AND ALLOW THEM TO HAVE A MORE POSITIVE EXPERIENCE. IN 2016, UNITYPOINT HEALTH - TRINITY FORMED A MILITARY ADVISORY COUNCIL TO HELP IDENTIFY COMMON CHALLENGES IMPACTING VETERANS IN THE LOCAL COMMUNITY. FROM THIS WORK WE FOUND THAT A LOT OF VETERANS IN THE COMMUNITY HAVE VERY LIMITED KNOWLEDGE AROUND THE SERVICES OFFERED TO ASSIST THEM. THE COMMITTEE DEVELOPED A RESOURCE GUIDE TO HELP CONNECT VETERANS TO RESOURCES SUCH AS HOUSING, EMPLOYMENT, STATE AND COUNTY RESOURCES, FOOD, AND MORE. THIS RESOURCE IS ACCESSIBLE TO ANYONE IN THE COMMUNITY TO USE TO ASSIST CONNECTING VETERANS TO NEEDED RESOURCES. UNITYPOINT HEALTH - TRINITY HAS ALSO PARTNERED WITH A NUMBER OF LOCAL VETERAN ORGANIZATIONS TO REACH VETERANS WITH HEALTH INFORMATION, EDUCATION AND SERVICES. WE HOSTED A NUMBER OF EVENTS TO PROVIDE FREE BLOOD PRESSURE SCREENINGS, FLU SHOTS, DIABETES SCREENINGS AND MORE. BY 2018, OUR MILITARY ADVISORY COMMITTEE WAS NOTICED BY THE DEPARTMENT OF VETERANS AFFAIRS FOR THE WORK BEING DONE IN THE LOCAL COMMUNITY. IN MID-2018 UNITYPOINT HEALTH - TRINITY'S MILITARY ADVISORY COMMITTEE RECENT THE COMMUNITY VETERANS ENGAGEMENT BOARD DESIGNATION, THE SECOND ESTABLISHED IN THE STATE OF IA, AND THE FIRST IN THE COUNTRY TO BE FORMED OUT OF A HEALTHCARE SYSTEM. THE COMMUNITY ENGAGEMENT DEPARTMENT UTILIZES UNITYPOINT HEALTH - TRINITY'S MISSION EFFECTIVENESS COMMITTEE TO ADVISE THE DIRECTION AND IMPACT OF THE ORGANIZATION'S OUTREACH WORK. THE COMMITTEE'S PURPOSE IS TO ENSURE THAT UNITYPOINT HEALTH - TRINITY IS LIVING OUT ITS MISSION IN AN EFFECTIVE AND IMPACTFUL WAY.

SECOND, BY UNDERSTANDING THE MAJOR HEALTH NEEDS OF THE COMMUNITY, STRATEGIES CAN BE PRIORITIZED AND A MORE TAILORED APPROACH DEVELOPED, RESULTING IN GREATER USE OF THE LIMITED RESOURCES OF MANY HEALTHCARE ORGANIZATIONS. THIRD, VULNERABLE POPULATIONS WITH SIGNIFICANT HEALTH NEEDS CAN BE IDENTIFIED AND TARGETED FOR INTERVENTION SUCH AS THE POOR, UNINSURED, UNDERINSURED, OR VARIOUS RACIAL/ETHNIC OR OTHER VULNERABLE POPULATIONS THAT MAY HAVE OTHERWISE BEEN OVERLOOKED. THROUGH IDENTIFICATION, PROGRAMS CAN THEN BE DEVELOPED SO THAT ALL POPULATIONS WE SERVE WILL RECEIVE APPROPRIATE AND TIMELY ACCESS TO HEALTHCARE SERVICES.

REGARDING EDUCATION, 23% OF RESIDENTS HAVE LESS THAN A HIGH SCHOOL EDUCATION AND ONLY 14% HAVE A BACHELOR'S DEGREE OR HIGHER. IN TERMS OF RACE/ETHNICITY, APPROXIMATELY 91% OF DETROIT IS COMPOSED OF A MINORITY POPULATION VERSUS 37% FOR THE FOUR-COUNTY AREA AS A WHOLE. THE DETROIT UNEMPLOYMENT RATE IS 7.9% (NOVEMBER 2018), DOWN FROM 11.5% IN SEPTEMBER 2015.WHEN LOOKING OUTSIDE OF THE CITY OF DETROIT, VARIOUS OTHER ZIP CODES IN THE FOUR-COUNTY AREA INDICATE SECTIONS OF THE REGION THAT HAVE LOWER INCOMES, LESS EDUCATION, AND ARE MORE RACIALLY AND ETHNICALLY DIVERSE. THE AVERAGE HOUSEHOLD INCOME OF THESE ZIP CODES RANGES FROM $29,486-$54,251, LOWER THAN THE FOUR-COUNTY SERVICE AREA. OVERALL, 17% OF RESIDENTS IN THESE ZIP CODES HAVE LESS THAN A HIGH SCHOOL EDUCATION COMPARED TO 11% FOR THE FOUR-COUNTY AREA. THESE TWENTY ZIP CODES HAVE A SLIGHTLY DIFFERENT PERCENTAGE OF RACIAL/ETHNIC MINORITIES AS COMPARED TO THE REST OF THE FOUR-COUNTY AREA. AS A WHOLE THESE ZIP CODES ARE COMPOSED OF 40% MINORITIES COMPARED TO 36% FOR THE FOUR-COUNTY AREA.AS A RESULT, THE CITY OF DETROIT AND ABOVE TWENTY ZIP CODES ARE OF PARTICULAR INTEREST IN PLANNING COMMUNITY NEEDS INITIATIVES WITHIN THE FOUR-COUNTY AREA."

SINCE COMPLETION OF THE CHNA, BRYAN HEALTH HAS EXPANDED ITS USE OF NURSE NAVIGATORS TO INCLUDE THREE ONCOLOGY NAVIGATORS THAT FOCUS ON PATIENTS WITH LUNG, BREAST, AND COLORECTAL CANCER. BRYAN ALSO PROVIDES PATIENT NAVIGATORS FOR ORTHOPEDICS AND PULMONARY DISEASES. AS PART OF BRYAN HEALTH, BRYAN HEART HAS ALSO IMPLEMENTED HEART FAILURE NURSE NAVIGATORS TO IDENTIFY POTENTIAL CARE GAPS THAT CAN LEAD TO READMISSIONS. THESE INDIVIDUALS ASSIST PATIENTS AND THEIR FAMILIES TO MAKE INFORMED HEALTH CARE DECISIONS AND ACCESS APPROPRIATE HEALTHCARE SERVICES. BRYAN HEALTH ALSO CONTINUES TO SUPPORT COMMUNITY HEALTH CENTERS, SUCH AS BLUESTEM HEALTH AND CLINIC WITH A HEART, THAT SERVE INDIVIDUALS THAT MIGHT NOT OTHERWISE BE ABLE TO AFFORD PRIMARY CARE SERVICES. Beginning in 2018, BRYAN HEALTH HAS MADE PROGRESS IN DEVELOPING THE INFRASTRUCTURE NEEDED TO CREATE A MEDICAL HOME WITH THE ROLLOUT OF MYCHART, THE PATIENT PORTAL TIED TO EPIC, BRYAN HEALTH'S NEW ELECTRONIC HEALTH RECORDS SYSTEM. TO PROVIDE ADDITIONAL ACCESS TO PRIMARY CARE SERVICES, BRYAN HEALTH ALSO HAS CONTINUED ITS EZVISIT SERVICE, WHICH IS A VIRTUAL CARE MODEL WITH 24/7 ACCESS TO A NEBRASKA BOARD CERTIFIED PHYSICIAN VIA COMPUTER OR MOBILE DEVICE. BRYAN'S ED CONNECTIONS PROGRAM CONTINUES to find medical homes for patients who have been using the emergency department for their primary care, help individuals who are unable to pay for certain approved prescriptions given in the emergency department, and donates medical equipment to people who are unable to afford or attain it. ED Connections also enacts a narcotic monitoring and diversion service for individuals who have been identified as inappropriately using the emergency department to obtain narcotics or controlled medications. WITHIN LANCASTER COUNTY AND BEYOND, BRYAN HEALTH OFFERS ONLINE, MOBILE, AND ON-SITE SCREENINGS TO IDENTIFY INDIVIDUALS WITH HIGH-RISK FOR CERTAIN CONDITIONS AND TO ENSURE THEY GET TIMELY ACCESS TO PREVENTATIVE CARE. A SCREENING THAT HAS BEEN EMBRACED IS FOR FAMILY MEMBERS OF PATIENTS WITH BICUSPID AORTIC VALVE (BAV). Close relatives of those diagnosed with BAV also are at risk for an aneurysm of the aortic root and ascending aorta. Early detection is critical since up to 40 percent of BAV patients will experience complications by the time they reach 50. To assist with the lack of mental health providers and services in the vast underserved areas of the state, Bryan Health offers behavioral health evaluations via telehealth to several emergency department providers across the state. By providing this service we assist with providing a quality evaluation and plan recommendations that reduce preventable inpatient admissions and assignment to other higher levels of care. BRYAN HEALTH ALSO PARTNERS WITH MANY CITY OF LINCOLN DEPARTMENTS AS WELL AS PRIVATE BUSINESSES TO PROVIDE MOBILE SCREENINGS, EDUCATION AND HEALTH FAIRS. ONE OF THE MAJOR ACTIONS THAT BRYAN HEALTH HAS TAKEN TO INCREASE ACCESS IS THE DECISION SEVERAL YEARS AGO TO PROVIDE AN ADDITIONAL SUBSIDY FOR HEALTH INSURANCE PREMIUMS FOR BRYAN HEALTH EMPLOYEES UNDER A CERTAIN WAGE LEVEL. THIS PROGRAM WAS CREATED BECAUSE A LARGE GROUP OF LOWER WAGE EMPLOYEES ELECTED NOT TO ENROLL IN BRYAN'S INSURANCE PLAN, AND ELECTED TO REMAIN UNINSURED DUE TO PREMIUM COSTS. THE ADDITIONAL SUBSIDY HAS PROVIDED ACCESS TO INSURANCE FOR CLOSE TO 400 EMPLOYEES AND THEIR DEPENDENTS ON AN ANNUAL BASIS. WE BELIEVE THIS IS A SMALL STEP TOWARD ASSISTING UNINSURED INDIVIDUALS IN OUR COMMUNITY AS INSURED INDIVIDUALS GENERALLY HAVE BETTER ACCESS TO SERVICES. DURING 2019, BRYAN MEDICAL CENTER PROVIDED LIFE-SAVING PROCEDURES AND MEDICATIONS FOR 9,764 INDIVIDUALS WHO WERE NOT ELIGIBLE FOR ANY GOVERNMENT OR STATE SUPPORT, AND DID NOT HAVE THE FINANCIAL RESOURCES TO PAY THEIR HEALTH CARE SERVICES. THERE ARE MANY REASONS BEHIND LACK OF ACCESS TO HEALTH CARE SERVICES; THE SHORTAGE OF HEALTHCARE PROFESSIONALS IS JUST ONE OF THESE REASONS. BRYAN HEALTH IS A HUGE SUPPORTER OF EDUCATION FOR HEALTH CARE PROFESSIONALS - INCLUDING ONGOING FINANCIAL SUPPORT FOR: 1) THE BRYAN COLLEGE OF HEALTH SCIENCES, WITH MORE THAN 770 STUDENTS ENROLLED IN GRADUATE AND UNDERGRADUATE DEGREE PROGRAMS THROUGH BRYAN'S SCHOOL OF NURSING, HEALTH PROFESSION AND NURSE ANESTHESIA PROGRAMS, AND 2) THE LINCOLN MEDICAL EDUCATION PARTNERSHIP RESIDENCY PROGRAM FOR FUTURE PRIMARY CARE PROVIDERS. IN ADDITION, BRYAN ALSO SERVES AS A CLINICAL TRAINING SITE FOR A LONG LIST OF HEALTH CARE DISCIPLINES; INCLUDING RADIOLOGY, LAB, PHYSICAL THERAPY, PHARMACY, EMTS AND PARAMEDICS, ETC. THIS COMMITMENT TO EDUCATION OF THE NEXT GENERATION OF HEALTH CARE PROFESSIONALS ULTIMATELY IMPROVES ACCESS TO HEALTHCARE IN OUR REGION. MADONNA IS THE DESIGNATED ORGANIZATION IN THE LINCOLN COMMUNITY THAT PROVIDES HANDICAP-ACCESSIBLE BUS TRANSPORTATION FOR COMMUNITY MEMBERS TO/FROM DOCTORS' APPOINTMENTS, THERAPY AND OTHER OUTPATIENT APPOINTMENTS. BRYAN PROVIDES AN ANNUAL CONTRIBUTION OF $25,000 FOR THESE SERVICES SO THAT FINANCIALLY CHALLENGED MEMBERS OF OUR COMMUNITY WILL HAVE ACCESS TO MEDICAL CARE. MANY PRIVATE PRACTICE PHYSICIANS IN LINCOLN HAVE ELECTED NOT TO SERVE MEDICAID AND/OR MEDICARE PATIENTS IN THEIR OUTPATIENT CLINICS FOR FINANCIAL REASONS. BRYAN PHYSICIAN NETWORK PHYSICIANS ACCEPT MEDICAID/MEDICARE PATIENTS INTO THEIR PRACTICE BY POLICY; THEREFORE, AS BRYAN PHYSICIAN NETWORK CONTINUES TO EXPAND WITHIN THE COMMUNITY, SO DOES ACCESS TO PHYSICIAN CARE FOR AREA MEDICAID/MEDICARE PATIENTS. IN JULY 2018, BRYAN PHYSICIAN NETWORK ESTABLISHED BRYAN NORTHPOINTE FAMILY MEDICINE WHICH INCLUDES A TEAM OF THREE FAMILY PRACTICE PHYSICIANS AND FOUR PHYSICIAN ASSISTANTS. Doctors Outpatient Surgery Center (DOSC) and Lincoln Digestive Health Center (LDHC) are joint ventures between Bryan Medical Center and area physician groups that began seeing patients in 2018. DOSC will provide a lower cost outpatient alternative to the community where general and specialty surgeries will be performed, including orthopedics, gynecology, podiatry, plastics and dental. LDHC will increase the capacity of lower cost gastrointestinal screenings (colonoscopies) and gastrointestinal services to the community. Over the last four years Bryan Medical Center has increased the number of staffed beds by 90 on both campuses to meet the community's demand. THE COMMUNITY HEALTH ENDOWMENT (CHE) IS THE DESIGNATED ORGANIZATION IN LINCOLN TO COORDINATE A WIDE VARIETY OF COMMUNITY HEALTH EFFORTS TO FURTHER THE HEALTH AND SAFETY OF THE COMMUNITY. CHE'S MISSION IS FOR LINCOLN TO BE THE HEALTHIEST CITY IN THE NATION. BRYAN FULLY SUPPORTS CHE's WORK. Continued Below."

BRYAN HEALTH HAS ALSO STARTED THE COMMUNITY TRANSITIONS PROGRAM, OPERATED BY PEERS AND A SOCIAL WORKER, TO PROVIDE FOLLOW-UP TO IDENTIFIED ADULTS WHO REGULARLY USE OUR MENTAL HEALTH SERVICES. FURTHERMORE, BRYAN HEALTH SUPPORTS EFFORTS IN THE COMMUNITY TO PROVIDE AN INTEGRATED BEHAVIORAL HEALTH SAFETY NET AND EXPAND ACCESS TO BEHAVIORAL HEALTH PROVIDERS WHO SERVE POOR, UNINSURED, AND MEDICAID ELIGIBLE POPULATIONS. THESE EFFORTS INCLUDE PROVIDING A SEGREGATED MENTAL HEALTH EMERGENCY DEPARTMENT STAFFED WITH SPECIALLY TRAINED BEHAVIORAL HEALTH NURSES, SOCIAL WORKERS and Peer Specialists. In order to further leverage these specially trained staff to assist with the lack of mental health providers and services in the vast underserved areas of the state, Bryan Health offers behavioral health evaluations via telehealth to several emergency department providers across the state. By providing this service we assist with providing a quality evaluation and plan recommendations that reduce preventable inpatient admissions and assignment to other higher levels of care. IN A SPECIAL PROJECT, BRYAN HEALTH'S MENTAL HEALTH EMERGENCY DEPARTMENT HAS PARTNERED WITH SEVERAL COMMUNITY PROVIDERS TO CREATE COMMUNITY PLANS FOR AN IDENTIFIED HIGH USER PATIENT GROUP TO AIDE IN PREVENTING REPEAT HOSPITAL INPATIENT ADMISSIONS. Also in this area, Bryan Health utilizes peer specialists who hold three community wellness groups a week at no cost to the participants. This includes a separate group for ages 14-18. AS THE ONLY ACUTE CARE HOSPITAL IN LINCOLN PROVIDING BEHAVIORAL HEALTH SERVICES, BRYAN ACTIVELY ENGAGES WITH AREA PROVIDERS TO SUPPORT THE EXPANDED ROLE OF BEHAVIORAL HEALTH TREATMENT IN THE COMMUNITY AND REGION. BRYAN HAS MADE IT A PRIORITY TO SERVE AS A TRAINING SITE FOR COUNSELORS, SOCIAL WORKERS, NURSES, PHYSICIAN ASSISTANTS, AND PRIMARY CARE PHYSICIANS THROUGH THE LINCOLN MEDICAL EDUCATION PROGRAM, SOUTHEAST COMMUNITY COLLEGE, DOANE University, BRYAN COLLEGE OF HEALTH SCIENCES, UNIVERSITY OF NEBRASKA AND OTHER EDUCATIONAL INSTITUTIONS. ONLINE SCREENINGS FOR DEPRESSION, ANXIETY, POST-TRAUMATIC STRESS DISORDER, ALCOHOL ABUSE AND ADOLESCENT DEPRESSION ARE AVAILABLE AT NO COST TO THE PUBLIC ON THE BRYAN HEALTH WEBSITE. BRYAN HEALTH WORKS WITH OTHER LINCOLN PROVIDERS AND GROUPS ACROSS THE STATE TO ADDRESS GAPS AND SPECIAL NEEDS IN THE POPULATION AS WELL AS THOSE WHO ARE UNDERSERVED. THESE INCLUDE HEALTH 360 INTEGRATED HOME; THE BRIDGE BEHAVIORAL HEALTH TO IMPROVE COORDINATION OF CARE FOR CLIENTS REQUIRING EMERGENCY DETOXIFICATION; THE BEHAVIORAL HEALTH EDUCATION CENTER OF NEBRASKA FOR WORKFORCE DEVELOPMENT OF Behavioral Health Providers; and Nebraska Department of Health and Human Services. WE ARE PROUD TO CO-SPONSOR AND HOST MENTAL ILLNESS AWARENESS WEEK TO PROVIDE COMMUNITY EDUCATION WITH ADDITIONAL OFFERINGS THROUGHOUT THE YEAR ON TOPICS SUCH AS, TRAUMA INFORMED CARE, ELDER ABUSE, GUARDIANSHIPS, Chronic pain and opioid use, NE Prescription Drug Monitoring System, Holistic Self-Care, ETC. BRYAN MEDICAL CENTER MENTAL HEALTH HAS BEEN A LEADER IN SUICIDE PREVENTION FOR OUR COMMUNITY AND STATE. ONE OF THE MANAGERS FOR BRYAN MENTAL HEALTH helped to start the Nebraska State Suicide Prevention Coalition in 1999 and continues to SERVE on the Executive Committee AS THE past CO-CHAIR OF THE NEBRASKA STATE SUICIDE PREVENTION COALITION AND SERVES ON THE LEADERSHIP GROUP of THE LINCOLN SUICIDE PREVENTION coalition. IN ADDITION, THIS BRYAN MENTAL HEALTH MANAGER PROVIDED LEADERSHIP IN DEVELOPING THE FIRST LOCAL OUTREACH TO SUICIDE SURVIVORS (LOSS) TEAM IN NEBRASKA AND IS ASSISTING WITH PROVIDING DIRECTION IN THE DEVELOPMENT OF LOSS TEAMS IN OTHER PARTS OF THE STATE. Additional teams have been developed in Omaha, Kearney, Norfolk and Chadron. Bryan is also working to start new LOSS teams in Scottsbluff, North Platte, Columbus, Seward, Grand Island/Hastings and Beatrice. DEVELOPING AND IMPLEMENTING THE LOSS TEAM WAS A COLLABORATIVE EFFORT IN WORKING WITH LAW ENFORCEMENT AND POLICE CHAPLAINS AS WELL AS OTHER COMMUNITY AND COUNTY AGENCIES. A LOSS TEAM IS A GROUP OF THREE PEOPLE WHO ARE ONCALL (TWO PEOPLE WHO HAVE LOST SOMEONE TO SUICIDE AND A CLINICIAN) AND THEY RESPOND TO FAMILIES WHO HAVE LOST SOMEONE TO SUICIDE AND PROVIDE RESOURCES. CONNECTING SUICIDE SURVIVORS TO OTHER SUICIDE SURVIVORS AND RESOURCES IS CONSIDERED SUICIDE POSTVENTION WHICH IS ALSO PREVENTION. In response to the growing presence and awareness of opioid misuse and abuse in the community and across the nation, Bryan Health created the Pain Management and Opioid Stewardship Program in summer 2018. Local pain management specialist Kelly Zach, MD leads a 24-member steering team to run the program. The team includes representation from medical staff, hospital administration, pharmacy, nursing, behavioral health, substance abuse, physical therapy and organizational quality. This ongoing program will evaluate and utilize evidence-based best practices to achieve safe and appropriate pain management, while reducing the risk of opioid addiction, overdose and deaths.

DURING THE FISCAL YEAR ENDED DECEMBER 31, 2018, Bryan Medical Center, CHI St. Elizabeth and the Lincoln-Lancaster County Health Department hosted meetings (or in one case, surveys sent via email) with representatives from public health partners and other non-profit organizations and coalitions, allowing them to provide updates and insights based on their particular areas of service or expertise. Then the group evaluated the 2015 CHNA's goals, priorities and objectives in detail, discussing the current situations in Lincoln and determining whether the goals were still relevant or appropriate as they had been originally laid out. Voting systems were used to determine whether objectives within a priority needed to be tweaked at a minor level, rewritten at a major level or left with no revisions. The four priority health needs identified in the Community Health Needs Assessment were Access to Care, Behavioral Health Care, Chronic Disease Prevention, and Injury Prevention. More than 70 members of the MAPP process came together across four meetings to review each goal separately. This process is outlined in the 2018 Community Health Needs Assessment. The assessment identifies the geographic area and population served, available health care resources, the methods with which the priority health needs were reviewed and adjusted. BRYAN USED THE PRIORITIES FROM THE COMMUNITY HEALTH NEEDS ASSESSMENT TO DEVELOP A DETAILED IMPLEMENTATION STRATEGY TO ENSURE THAT OUR STRENGTHS AND AVAILABLE RESOURCES ARE ALIGNED WITH THE HEALTH NEEDS OF OUR COMMUNITY. BRYAN MEDICAL CENTER'S BOARD OF TRUSTEES ADOPTED THIS IMPLEMENTATION STRATEGY on November 26, 2018 AND IT IS POSTED ON THE BRYAN WEBSITE. THIS IMPLEMENTATION STRATEGY SERVES AS THE FOUNDATION FOR BRYAN'S COMMUNITY HEALTH IMPROVEMENT EFFORTS (SEE BRYAN COMMUNITY HEALTH NEEDS ASSESSMENT) AND IS REVIEWED ANNUALLY. BRYAN HAS ALSO PARTICIPATED OVER THE PAST sevenTEEN YEARS IN COMMUNITY NEEDS ASSESSMENTS IN COOPERATION WITH OTHER HEALTH CARE PROVIDERS AND THE LINCOLN-LANCASTER COUNTY HEALTH DEPARTMENT, AS WELL AS PARTICIPATING IN THE DEVELOPMENT OF HEALTHY PEOPLE 2020 PLAN FOR LINCOLN-LANCASTER COUNTY. IN ADDITION TO PARTICIPATION IN COMMUNITY HEALTH NEEDS ASSESSMENTS, BRYAN CONDUCTS ON-GOING COMMUNITY PERCEPTION SURVEYS. THE SURVEY ASSESSES PERCEPTION OF THE QUALITY AND AVAILABILITY OF HEALTH CARE PROVIDERS IN THE REGION. BRYAN ALSO ASSESSES MARKET SHARE AND UTILIZATION TRENDS AS WELL AS CHANGES IN POPULATION DEMOGRAPHICS. Beyond this, The Center for the Child and the Community convened an Early Childhood Comprehensive Health Working Group comprised of school administrators, community endowment representatives, mental health representatives and health care representatives. This group, sponsored by the Community Health Endowment and led by the Center for the Child and the Community, conducted its own community health assessment specifically on early childhood in Lancaster County using the MAPP process. Two representatives from Bryan Medical Center participated in this group."

WHILE BRYAN SERVES A REGIONAL GEOGRAPHIC AREA EXTENDING BEYOND THE COUNTY, LANCASTER COUNTY RESIDENTS ACCOUNT FOR NEARLY 68 PERCENT OF INPATIENTS AND 83 PERCENT OF OUTPATIENTS. THE MEDIAN INCOME IN LANCASTER COUNTY WAS ESTIMATED AT $58,009, AND 13.1% OF THE POPULATION HAD FAMILY INCOMES BELOW THE POVERTY LEVEL. THE PERCENT OF UNINSURED ADULTS AGED 19 TO 64 in Lancaster County HAS BEEN ESTIMATED AT A RATE OF 10.1% IN 2018. CANCER REMAINED THE LEADING CAUSE OF DEATH FOR LANCASTER COUNTY IN 2018, FOLLOWED BY HEART DISEASE, CHRONIC LUNG DISEASE, CEREBROVASCULAR DISEASE, ACCIDENTAL DEATHS, ALZHEIMER'S DISEASE, AND DIABETES MELLITUS. BRYAN AND CHI HEALTH-ST. ELIZABETH ARE THE PRIMARY HOSPITALS SERVING LANCASTER COUNTY. THE CENSUS BUREAU REPORTS THAT THE COUNTY'S POPULATION GREW FROM 250,291 IN 2000 TO AN ESTIMATED 317,272 IN 2018. POPULATION IS PROJECTED TO BE NEARLY 440,000 BY 2050, WITH GROWTH EXPECTED AMONG ALL MAJOR AGE GROUPS. THE 60 AND OVER AGE GROUP IS PROJECTED TO HAVE THE HIGHEST RATE OF GROWTH, INCREASING FROM AN ESTIMATED 61,598 IN 2018 TO AN ESTIMATED 96,000 IN 2050. BECAUSE OF LINCOLN'S SIZE, RELATIVELY STABLE ECONOMY, AND EDUCATIONAL OPPORTUNITIES, THE U.S. STATE DEPARTMENT DESIGNATED LINCOLN AS ""REFUGEE FRIENDLY"" IN THE 1970S. SINCE THE 70S, WAVES OF IMMIGRANTS FROM ACROSS THE WORLD HAVE RESETTLED IN LINCOLN. LINCOLN PUBLIC SCHOOLS CURRENTLY SERVES APPROXIMATELY 3,000 ENGLISH LEARNERS, REPRESENTING 152 DIFFERENT COUNTRIES AND OVER 100 DIFFERENT LANGUAGES. THE MINORITY POPULATION IN LANCASTER COUNTY IS ESTIMATED TO BE 19.3% IN 2018. PERSONS OF HISPANIC ORIGIN (MAY BE OF ANY RACE) ARE ESTIMATED TO BE 7.2% IN 2018, WHILE PERSONS REPORTING AS ASIAN ALONE ARE ESTIMATED TO BE 4.0% OF THE POPULATION, AND PERSONS REPORTING TO BE BLACK OR AFRICAN AMERICAN ALONE ARE ESTIMATED TO BE 3.9%. PROJECTED GROWTH IN MINORITY POPULATIONS CHALLENGES US TO ACCOMMODATE DIVERSE LANGUAGE AND CULTURAL NEEDS.

WE'RE MANAGING ALL OF OUR RESOURCES TO REDUCE OUR OVERALL ENVIRONMENTAL FOOTPRINT AND LEAD SUSTAINABILITY EFFORTS IN THE NORTHEAST. HOSPITALS CAN USE MORE THAN DOUBLE THE AMOUNT OF ENERGY AS COMMERCIAL BUILDINGS AND ON AVERAGE GENERATE MORE THAN THIRTY-THREE POUNDS OF WASTE PER PATIENT PER DAY. WE'RE MAKING ROCHESTER REGIONAL HEALTH THE EXCEPTION.OUR SUSTAINABILITY DEPARTMENT IS DEDICATED TO HELPING IMPROVE THE HEALTHCARE EXPERIENCE, ENSURE A HEALTHY ENVIRONMENT, AND LOWER HEALTHCARE COSTS. WE'RE REDUCING WASTE, ELIMINATING TOXINS, AND CREATING A MORE SUSTAINABLE COMMUNITY NOW AND FOR THE FUTURE. A FEW OF THE MANY SUSTAINABILITY PROJECTS AN INITIATIVES UNDERWAY AT ROCHESTER REGIONAL HEALTH INCLUDE:ENERGY EFFICIENT EQUIPMENT AND LIGHTING UPGRADES - ROCHESTER REGIONAL IS INCREASING ENERGY EFFICIENCY THROUGH EQUIPMENT UPGRADES IN OUR BUILDINGS. WE ARE RETROFITTING INTERNAL AND EXTERNAL LIGHTING WITH LED LIGHTING, A TECHNOLOGY THAT CONSUMES A THIRD OF THE ENERGY OF TRADITIONAL LIGHTING AND LASTS THREE TIMES AS LONG SAVING MONEY ON BOTH ENERGY AND MAINTENANCE. OTHER ENERGY EFFICIENCY UPGRADES ARE FOCUSED ON REDUCING THE ELECTRICAL AND HEATING LOADS OF OUR HVAC SYSTEMS AND OTHER EQUIPMENT. WE ARE UPGRADING SEVERAL PIECES OF ENERGY INTENSIVE EQUIPMENT THAT ARE OFTEN NOT CONSIDERED, INCLUDING VENDING MACHINES, AND REFRIGERATION UNITS. SOLAR INSTALLATIONS - OPPORTUNITIES FOR ON-SITE SOLAR INSTALLATIONS ARE BEING INVESTIGATED TO PROVIDE POWER TO FACILITIES ACROSS OUR ORGANIZATION. AT OUR HEADQUARTERS, THE RIEDMAN CAMPUS, WE HAVE CONSTRUCTED A 486 KW PHOTOVOLTAIC ARRAY THAT WILL PRODUCE AROUND 550,000 KWH ANNUALLY, PROVIDING POWER TO 20 OF OUR LOCATIONS. THIS WILL OFFSET APPROXIMATELY 848,000 LBS OF CO2 EMISSIONS PER YEAR. COMMUNITY SUPPORTIVE AGRICULTURE - ROCHESTER REGIONAL IS CURRENTLY WORKING WITH LOCAL ORGANIZATIONS TO OFFER COMMUNITY SUPPORTIVE AGRICULTURE (CSA) FOOD SHARE DROP-OFF LOCATIONS ACROSS THE ORGANIZATION. THESE CSA ORGANIZATIONS PARTNER WITH CREDENTIALED FARMERS AND WHOLESALERS THAT ENSURE THE BEST QUALITY LOCAL PRODUCE AND SUSTAINABLE FOOD, ADHERING TO THE HIGHEST STANDARDS IN OUR FACILITIES AND COMMUNITIES. THUS FAR, FIVE FOOD SHARE LOCATIONS WERE ESTABLISHED AT OUR FACILITIES.LOCAL FOOD PURCHASING AND FARMERS MARKET - ROCHESTER REGIONAL ACTIVELY SUPPORTS PURCHASES FROM LOCAL FARMS TO SUPPORT OUR LOCAL ECONOMY. CURRENTLY, WE PURCHASE PRODUCE FROM A NUMBER OF LOCAL VENDORS, ANNUALLY AMOUNTING TO AROUND 20% OF THE ORGANIZATION'S TOTAL SPENT ON PRODUCE. ADDITIONALLY, ROCHESTER REGIONAL'S RIEDMAN LOCATION HOLDS WEEKLY FARMERS MARKETS TO ENCOURAGE THE COMMUNITY AND EMPLOYEES TO PURCHASE MORE LOCALLY GROWN FOOD. WE ARE ACTIVELY SEEKING TO EXPAND THE PROGRAM AND START FARMERS MARKETS AT OTHER FACILITIES.WASTE TO ENERGY - FOOD WASTES AND OTHER ORGANIC MATERIALS THAT COULD BE DIVERTED MAKE UP 25% OF TRASH SENT TO LANDFILLS. SEVERAL FOOD WASTE AUDITS RECENTLY CONDUCTED AT ROCHESTER GENERAL HOSPITAL, UNITY HOSPITAL, AND THE RIEDMAN CAMPUS SUGGEST THAT WE COULD BE DIVERTING UP TO 705,925 LBS OF FOOD WASTE FROM LANDFILLS A YEAR ACROSS OUR ORGANIZATION. WHEN ORGANIC WASTE IS SENT TO LANDFILLS, IT BREAKS DOWN INTO METHANE, WHICH IS 20 TIMES MORE POTENT GREENHOUSE GAS THAN CO2. THAT MEANS 1 LB OF METHANE EMITTED IS LIKE PUTTING 20 LBS OF CO2 INTO THE AIR. ROCHESTER REGIONAL BEGAN DIVERTING ORGANIC WASTE FROM OUR RIEDMAN CAMPUS TO AN ANAEROBIC DIGESTER JUST SOUTH OF ROCHESTER. BACTERIA IN THE ANAEROBIC DIGESTER BREAK DOWN ORGANIC WASTE INTO METHANE THAT IS THEN COMBUSTED ON-SITE TO PRODUCE ELECTRICITY. THE PROCESS ALSO PRODUCES A NUTRIENT-RICH SLURRY THAT IS USED IN AGRICULTURAL APPLICATIONS TO HELP DISPLACE SYNTHETIC CHEMICAL FERTILIZERS.ELECTRONICS RECYCLING - HEALTHCARE DATA STORED ON ELECTRONIC DEVICES IS EXTREMELY SENSITIVE, AND WE TAKE SECURING THAT INFORMATION VERY SERIOUSLY AT ROCHESTER REGIONAL. FOR ALL OF OUR ELECTRONIC DEVICES IN NEED OF REPLACEMENT, USUALLY BECAUSE THEY ARE OUTDATED OR TOO COSTLY TO REPAIR, WE HAVE TO FIND A REPLACEMENT WHILE TAKING THE UTMOST CARE THAT WE SECURELY REMOVE ANY SENSITIVE INFORMATION FROM THE OLD DEVICE. FOR PIECES OF EQUIPMENT THAT MAY HAVE SENSITIVE INFORMATION, WE REMOVE THE DATA STORAGE PORTION, SHRED IT, AND RECYCLE THE PIECES. THE REST OF THE DEVICE MAY BE COMPLETELY FINE WHERE THE COMPONENTS INCLUDING THE HOUSING AND ON-BOARD SENSORS CAN STILL BE USED. RATHER THAN THROW OUT THE REMAINDER OF THE EQUIPMENT, WE WORK WITH ORGANIZATIONS THAT RE-SELL/REFURBISH THE HOUSING AND OTHER CRITICAL COMPONENTS, INTO NEW DEVICES, ELIMINATING THE NEED FOR MANY RAW MATERIALS TO BE CONSUMED. SUSTAINABLE PURCHASING CRITERIA IS A BROAD TOPIC THAT ULTIMATELY AIMS TO ENSURE THE ENTITIES WE PROCURE PRODUCTS AND SERVICES FROM ARE COMMITTED TO THE SAME CORE VALUES AS ROCHESTER REGIONAL, INCLUDING QUALITY, COMPASSION, RESPECT, COLLABORATION, AND FORESIGHT. IN ADDITION, WE UNDERSTAND THAT AS THE SECOND LARGEST EMPLOYER IN OUR AREA, WE ARE A SIGNIFICANT ECONOMIC DRIVER WITHIN OUR COMMUNITY, AND AIM TO USE THIS INFLUENCE FOR GOOD. NOT ONLY DO WE WORK TOWARDS IMPROVING THE PHYSICAL HEALTH OF OUR COMMUNITY MEMBERS, BUT WE ALSO SEEK TO IMPROVE THE ECONOMIC AND ENVIRONMENTAL HEALTH OF THE COMMUNITY AS WELL. WITH THAT IN MIND, WE HAVE A DEDICATED TEAM THAT IS DEVELOPING SUSTAINABLE PURCHASING CRITERIA THAT WILL SET GUIDELINES AROUND THE SOCIAL, ECONOMIC, AND ENVIRONMENTAL IMPACTS OF THE PRODUCTS AND SERVICES WE PROCURE. THE PRIMARY STRATEGIES FOR THESE CRITERIA ARE TO BUY MORE LOCALLY PRODUCED ITEMS, PURCHASE PRODUCTS THAT ARE MADE WITH SAFER MATERIALS, AND WORK MORE WITH COMPANIES THAT TREAT THEIR EMPLOYEES WELL."

To date, the CHLA Trauma Program has almost 12,000 people, including CHLA Staff, Community members in Los Angeles County including teachers, construction workers, city employees, stay at home parents, and approximately, 800 youth on bleeding control methods. Currently, we are the only hospital in Southern California that is training children on recognizing and treating life-threating bleeding. Prior to the start of Pandemic in March 2020, only trained 100 people on STB before the pandemic hit. The class has currently been put on hold due to the pandemic with the exception of one virtual session conducted for CHLA's CampCHLA program to which it was offered to 120 high school students and shared with their families.Champions for Change - Healthy Communities Initiative:The Los Angeles County Department of Public Health's Nutrition and Physical Activity Program launched the Champions for Change - Healthy Communities Initiative to help reduce the prevalence of obesity among Supplemental Nutrition Assistance Program-Education (SNAP-Ed) eligible populations by providing nutrition education, physical activity promotion, and working to create healthier environments for individuals and families where they live, learn, work, play, pray, and shop. Children's Hospital Los Angeles is providing these services within the underserved communities, focusing on families with young children. Key efforts include teaching fundamental skills such as healthy cooking, reading food labels, shopping on a budget, growing fruits and vegetables, and being physically active in low-cost and fun ways. Adults in Los Angeles participating in low-income assistance programs such as food pantries, public housing, and family resource centers and with children in elementary schools receiving free & reduced price meal (FRPM) school meals enrollment) were screened for food insecurity. Smarter Lunchroom Movement strategies were applied in elementary schools. Since the start of the stay-at-home orders due to COVID-19 in March 2020, the program was put on hold and is exploring transitioning to a virtual platform."

The hospitals FY18 CHNA and three-year Implementation Strategies were endorsed by MedStar Union Memorial Hospitals Board of Directors and approved by the MedStar Health Board of Directors. The document became available on the hospitals website on June 30, 2018. During FY19, key revisions were made across MedStar Health to more effectively impact the communities served throughout Maryland and Washington, DC. Several internal meetings were convened with leadership from each MedStar Health Hospital to review current practices and strategies. As a result of these meetings, the approach to the current CHNA for the remainder of the three-year cycle (FY19-FY21) was revised. A key revision to the CHNA is a greater focus on hospital area strategies that are most appropriate for the local communities served. The number of strategies each hospital is accountable for executing was reduced to encourage more meaningful reach within key areas contrasted with broader reach with reduced impact. Using the standard categories, Health and Wellness, Access to Care and Social Determinants of Health to determine what to prioritize for the CHNA IRS requirements, each hospital agreed to select two to three strategies as priorities that have size and scale impact and measurable outcomes. All other programming was integrated as part of the hospitals overall community health portfolio. These additional programs were captured in the inventory for the whole picture of contributing to the health of the communities served as well as sorted for what counts as community benefit for regulatory reporting. The hospitals Community Benefit Service Area (CBSA) remains the same, based on the Advisory Task Force (ATF) recommendation. The hospital identified North Central Baltimore City as its CBSA, which includes all residents living in ZIP codes 21211, 21213 and 21218. The hospital selected this geographic area based on hospital utilization data and secondary public health data as well as its proximity to the hospital. The ATF included a diverse group of individuals, including hospital leaders, grassroots activists, community residents, faith-based leaders, hospital representatives, public health leaders and other stakeholder organizations, such as representatives from local health departments. MedStar Union Memorial Hospitals health priorities for the CBSA include health and wellness (chronic disease prevention and management, behavioral health) and social determinants of health (social needs screenings, Baltimore JOBS). As a proud member of MedStar Health, representatives from MedStar Union Memorial Hospital routinely participate in the MedStar Health community health workgroup. The workgroup is comprised of community health professionals who represent all ten MedStar hospitals. The team analyzes local and regional community health data, establishes system-wide community health programming performance and evaluation measures and shares best practices."

202141279349301884,520591685,PROMOTION OF COMMUNITY HEALTH,"PART VI, LINE 5 As a community partner, MedStar Union Memorial Hospital engages in several community benefit activities to improve and promote the health and wellbeing of the community. Priority areas, as determined by the 2018 CHNA, fall under three areas of focus including health and wellness, access to care, and social determinants of health. Programs include (but are not limited to): Access to Care The priority area is addressing access to behavioral health services, including mental health and substance use treatment. In FY20, 39,549 patients were screened for substance use in the emergency department through the Screening, Brief Intervention, and Referral to Treatment (SBIRT) program. An enhancement of SBIRT includes the Opioid Overdose Survivor Outreach Program (OSOP). OSOP links community members with a history of substance abuse treatment with the resources they need to prevent a future overdose. MedStar Union Memorial is also a founding and current partner of Shepherds Clinic, a free clinic for underinsured and uninsured residents of the hospitals primary and CBSA. Staff are provided to support clinic operations, including a provider, wellness director, and administrative personnel. Patients are seen through medical personnel provided by the hospitals while also able to take advantage of wellness program offerings at Joy Wellness Center. MedStar Union Memorial also addresses access to care by helping to reduce the financial burden for patients and their families. Patient Financial Services provides financial assistance to uninsured patients who reside within the community by assisting with enrollment in publicly funded entitlement programs, referring patients to State or Federal Insurance Exchange navigator resources and assisting with consideration of funding that may be available from other charitable organizations. Health and Wellness MedStar Union Memorial Hospital addresses health and wellness by offering a variety of programs and resources that seek to address chronic disease prevention and management. MedStar Union Memorial Hospitals community-based education courses are offered to support healthy lifestyle changes for community members. Programs include the Centers for Disease Control led Diabetes Prevention Program, diabetes self-management education, flu vaccination clinics, yoga services, senior physical fitness, and smoking cessation. Staff participate in community health events such as health fairs, festivals and expositions where screenings are performed, and health information is shared. Social Determinants of Health MedStar Union Memorial Hospitals other priority is addressing the social determinants of health of the community. Community residents surrounding the hospital have been trained and hired as either a community health advocate or peer recovery coach as part of the Population Health Workforce Development program. These positions serve to empower individuals and their families into better economic conditions. As part of their responsibilities, the community health advocate roles conduct social needs screenings. Social needs screenings are provided to screen for food and housing insecurity, and barriers related to transportation, employment, and utilities. Identified needs are addressed by connecting the participant to social services and other resources in the community. Of those screened, patients reported food insecurity (59%); transportation barriers (50%); need for employment assistance (13%); need for utility assistance (16%); need for housing assistance (25%); and financial strain (63%). MedStar Union Memorial Hospital has a partnership with Uber to address transportation barriers to access medical services. Through this partnership, rides are provided to patients and/or families with financial need. The transportation assistance enables patients to attend necessary appointments with their health care providers. Further, MedStar Union Memorial Hospital addresses food insecurity by enrolling patients into a food prescription delivery program through its partner Hungry Harvest. This temporary source of food assistance allows community health advocates to address a long-term strategy for food access (e.g. Meals on Wheels, etc.). MedStar Union Memorial Hospital also provides pathways for healthcare careers for the youth in its surrounding community. Rx for Success provides robust student internship experiences for high-risk youth. This eight-week summer internship connects the course curriculum with tangible onsite experience. This allows students to demonstrate skill development and experience working in the medical field. Other partnerships to expose community members to workforce development include partnerships with Cristo Rey and Project SEARCH. Disaster Readiness The hospital strengthened the community health resilience by improving the ability of the community to withstand and recover from coronavirus, a public health emergency that surfaced in March 2020. Leadership participated in community-wide task forces and staff implemented programs associated with addressing health needs arising from coronavirus."

For inpatient services, the limit is the TEFRA target limit. The hospital, on occasion, exceeds the target rate and does not receive full cost reimbursement. The TEFRA target amount is updated by the Medicare program annually by the TEFRA updating factor. However, the amount of the TEFRA updating factor is always significantly less than the actual healthcare inflation factor because the Medicare program includes a ""budget neutrality"" factor for the overall Medicare program. For outpatient services, the limit is the payment to cost ratio (PCR). The PCR was established using a base year, which was 1996, at a rate of 85.5% of cost. The PCR for all PPS-exempt cancer centers was 88% through 12/31/18, and then 88% from 1/1/19 to 5/31/19; therefore, the hospital currently does not receive payment for 12% of its outpatient cost."

Miami-Dade is the seventh largest county in the nation and represents 12.3% of Florida's population. It is one of the few counties in the United States that is ""minority-majority,"" in that a racial/ethnic minority group comprises the majority of the population with approximately 67.5% Latino or Hispanic residents; 16.3% black, non-Hispanic; 13.7% white, non-Hispanic; 1.5% Asian; 0.1 American Indian and Alaska Native; 0.3% other race alone and approximately 0.3% of non-Hispanic residents identified with more than one race. Miami-Dade County has a relatively young population with 84.7% of residents under age 65 and 20.5% under the age of 18, with a median resident age of 39.5 years old. This diversity is often thought to represent the future demographics of the United States in 2050. In Miami Dade County, nearly 20% of all individuals live below the federal poverty level (e.g., annual income of $25,750 for a family of four), as compared to 14% in Florida overall. The SocioNeeds Index, developed by the Conduent Healthy Communities Institute, is a measure of socioeconomic need calculated from several social and economic factors, ranging from poverty to education, which may impact health and/or access to care. The Index is correlated with potentially preventable hospitalization rates related to chronic conditions, diabetes, and obesity. Index values range from 0 to 100, in which 100 represents communities with the greatest socioeconomic need. The median score for Miami-Dade County is 74.5 out of 100, which is indicative of poor health outcomes due to high needs within the community. The SocioNeeds Index further confirms the socioeconomic disparities observed among residents of Miami-Dade County. This map illustrates the socioeconomic status of Miami-Dade County residents based on the SocioNeeds Index. In addition to the SocioNeeds Index, a rank measure is calculated by comparing the SocioNeeds Index of all zip codes in Miami-Dade County (a rank of 5 represents high need, while a rank of 1 represents low need). More than one-third of Miami-Dade County residents live in ZIP codes identified as those with the ""greatest need"" (5). Over 70% of residents reside in ZIP codes with a SocioNeeds Index score of a three (3) or higher. The top ten leading causes of death in Miami-Dade County are:1. Heart Disease2. Cancer3. Stroke4.

This program helps ensure that our staff and hospital facilities are prepared to continue to provide safe, quality patient care under the most austere conditions. This Program is a critical link in federal, state and local disaster response plans. Our Emergency Preparedness Department is involved in three local committees, including the North Philadelphia Emergency Healthcare Support Zone, the Regional Hospital Subcommittee; and the Emergency Support Function-8 Work Group. These committees focus on creation of drills, policy development, and continuing education.(3) Safe-T Program. In addition to the personal education about newborn care and safety, all mothers that deliver at TUH receive a Safe Sleeper kit complete with a sleep-safe baby box, layette items such as fleece and cotton clothing, sheets and blanket, a baby book (provided in English and Spanish), diapers, thermometer, nasal aspirator, baby wash, smoke detectors (provided by the Philadelphia Fire Department) and educational materials and resource referrals. This program has also been found to reduce co-sleeping by 25% - a dangerous practice in which parents and babies share the same bed.(4) Philadelphia MOM.

Serves as an interface with federal, state and local agencies and with community based organizations to collaborate on initiatives to improve the health of our low-income, diverse, medically complex population. TCPH's ""Temple Care Transitions"" program also employs Community Health Workers and Nurse Navigators to identify patients with complex social and medical health issues through intakes conducted in the hospital, community and by telephone. They also assist with scheduling appointments, coordinating transportation, obtaining home support, and educating patients on how they can manage health issues and avoid future hospitalization.(10) Southeast Pennsylvania Collaborative Opportunities to Advance Community Health (COACH) initiative. In partnership with the U.S. Department of Health & Human Services, Philadelphia Department of Health and the Healthcare Improvement Foundation, Temple helps address food insecurity. In selected clinical settings, a member of our hospital staff asks patients about their access to sufficient food. If a patient indicates food insecurity, we refer the patient to community resources for SNAP food assistance, food banks and other needs.(11) Employee Community Engagement. Temple University Hospital conducts numerous engagement activities throughout the year, including collections for new coats and clothing, holiday gifts, food, and school supplies to benefit low income families living in our communities. We are particularly proud of the support that we provide to local public schools, where many families have limited resources to purchase warm weather clothing and school supplies for young children. (12) Temple University Hospital partners with Temple University's Lewis Katz School of Medicine ""Block by Block and other programs to establish partnerships with surrounding communities to improve research and community health.

Temple University Hospital's Episcopal Campus is located at the epicenter of our State's opioid crisis and has the highest number of opioid related deaths in Philadelphia. With support from the Commonwealth, we are expanding medication-assisted treatment programs to several community-based sites throughout Philadelphia using multidisciplinary care teams and social supports. With Temple's Department of Family Medicine's TRUST Clinic (Temple Recovery Using Scientific Treatment) central to this ""hub-and-spoke"" model, we are coordinating services among our emergency departments, local health centers, physician offices and outreach organizations. Additionally, in partnership with the City, our ""Recovery Overdose Survivor Project"" employs certified peer recovery specialists that help link overdose patients and their families with needed services and provide follow-up 48 hours after treatment in our Emergency Department or Crisis Response Center. We are also working with Philadelphia's Office of Homeless Services to establish a 40-bed respite center to address homelessness among opioid users. (15) Support for Early Learning.

202001339349303080,232825878,"Part III, Line 2:","Effective July, 1, 2018, the Health System adopted a new revenue recognition accounting standard that resulted in significant changes to the methodology for reporting bad debt expense. Under the previous standard, estimates for amounts not expected to be collected based on historical experience were recorded within net patient service revenue and then recognized as bad debt expense. Under the new standard, estimates for unrealizable amounts are recognized as implicit price concessions that are a direct reduction to net patient service revenues. As a result, the amount of bad debt expense reported in the Health System's financial statements has been greatly reduced, despite the fact that overall collection rates have not changed. Bad debt expense reported in the 2018 tax year relates to patient balances recorded prior to July 1, 2018 when the new standard took effect. These expenses represent the difference between the patient balances per contracted rates and the amounts actually collected after all reasonable collection efforts were exhausted."

Total Community Benefit expense for FY2019 is $54,941,047."
202011409349300726,370661238,"Schedule H, Part III, Line 2 Bad debt expense - methodology used to estimate amount","Self-pay patients are screened for verification of no insurance coverage. Once verification of no coverage has been completed, the guarantors will be screened for charity or uninsured discounts based on income levels. Those guarantors who do not qualify for charity through the screening process will be asked to provide proof of income in the form of a recent pay stub and/or recent tax return to determine the level of uninsured discounting. If no proof of income is provided or a guarantor's income is greater than 201% of the federal poverty level, the appropriate discount according to the established criteria up to 600% of the federal poverty level will be applied. The amount of money not collected from those self-pay patients who are not eligible for charity care is reported as bad debt. Allowances for Doubtful Accounts have been recorded based on an historical matrix, using collectability percentages by payor and aging category in accordance with HSHS Executive Policy #F-23, Valuation of Net Accounts Receivable. Percentages are based on historical experience at the hospital and adjusted for known limitations. The Hospital reports bad debt in accordance with Generally Accepted Accounting Principles (GAAP)."
202011409349300726,370661238,"Schedule H, Part III, Line 3 Bad Debt Expense Methodology","HSHS St. John's Hospital strongly believes that its charity care, and the related community benefit obtained from such care, is understated because of those patients who potentially qualify for charity care but do not wish to apply for it. In addition, some care is not classified as charity because of missing documentation on patient resources. Thus, the hospital's bad debt includes a portion that could be classified as charity care if application for such care was sought and/or completed."

Please also reference Footnote 2Q on page 14 for an explanation of how the financials account for bad debt.
202011409349300726,370661238,"Schedule H, Part III, Line 8 Community benefit & methodology for determining medicare costs","HSHS St. John's Hospital continually strives to provide excellent patient care in the most cost effective fashion. Nonetheless, the Medicare program, in many cases, does not provide payment that covers the full cost of the care provided. Since it is the mission of the hospital to respond to community need, hospital leadership continually advocates for improved Medicare payment so that the cost of quality care to those patients who are not able to afford it is not compromised and is fairly subsidized by all payers. The IRS does not classify this shortfall in Medicare payments as Community Benefit. However, we believe it is an important contribution made by the hospital to the health and well-being of the community. If the Medicare program did not exist, many Medicare patients would be eligible for financial assistance or other means-tested government programs. Further, by absorbing this shortfall and providing care below cost to these individuals, St. John's Hospital is relieving the burden of the government. Accordingly, this shortfall restricts St. John's Hospital's ability to make funds available to provide for financial assistance and other Community Benefit. The hospital Medicare shortfall at cost for fiscal year 2019 was $25,165,624."
202011409349300726,370661238,"Schedule H, Part III, Line 9b Collection practices for patients eligible for financial assistance","Every effort is made prior to, during and after provision of medical services to determine whether a patient is eligible for charity/community care and to assist the patient in completing the application and provide adequate documentation. If the patient qualified for charity/community care for the full balance of their account, the entire amount is written off to charity/community care and hence no debt collection is pursued. If the patient qualified for charity/community care for a portion of their account balance, that portion is written off to charity/community care, with the patient being responsible for the remainder of the balance. Additionally, reasonable effort will be made to obtain third-party or government payer reimbursement on behalf of the patient. If those efforts are not fruitful, an offer will be extended to the patient to make installment payments on their balance. Only at such point that the patient defaults on installment payments or refuses to cooperate with the hospital's efforts to be reimbursed will the account be sent to collections. The hospital will make reasonable efforts to determine whether a patient is eligible under the financial assistance policy before it engages in an ECA. To the extent a patient is determined to be eligible for financial assistance under the FAP, the hospital will take all reasonably available measures to reverse any ECA taken against the patient to obtain payment for the care."

202011409349300726,370661238,"Schedule H, Part VI, Line 3 Patient education of eligibility for assistance","The Registration Department provides information to patients upon registration regarding the Payment Assistance Program available to them at HSHS St. John's Hospital. Brochures are also supplied in waiting and ancillary areas for easy access by the patient. The brochures include contact numbers for the Business Office. Available on SJS website is information about how to read and understand the billing information on payment assistance, billing procedures and explanation of Medicare forms: https://www.st-johns.org/Patients-Guests/Patient-Financial-Services. Signage indicating that Financial Assistance is available is located at hospital patient Access points. St. John's Hospital's website also provides an in depth explanation on the financial assistance program: https://www.st-johns.org/Patients-Guests/Patient-Financial-Services/Financial-Assistance.aspx. The organization has a representative on site to assist patients who may be eligible for Medicaid assistance through the Illinois Department of Public Assistance. They work with patients to determine if they may be eligible, and if so, assist in pulling together the necessary application for submission. One-on-one conversations to educate patients about financial assistance often stem from patients receiving a statement or a pre-collection letter. At that point, the customer service representative or cashier, or other qualified staff, will inform/educate the caller about financial assistance options. The first pre-collection letter reminds the patient their account is in delinquent status. It also informs them they may be eligible for financial assistance through the organization's charity care program. The letter provides direct contact information to begin the application process for charity care and lists the Internet address where the policy can be obtained. A system called Pay Now is now being utilized after failed attempts made by the hospital and our law firm to work out payment arrangements. That system accesses credit and other information and allows us to see the probability of a patient being able to pay their bill. After assessing that information, the hospital decides whether to grant charity care or continue collection efforts. Starting in tax year 2015 (FY2016), the IRS Final Regulations required hospitals to translate FAP into the primary language of any populations with limited English proficiency that constitute more than 5% of the residents of your service area or 1,000 residents (whichever is less) of the population likely to be affected or encountered by the hospital. System wide, we have the Financial Assistance Brochure and Application available in Spanish."

The total primary and secondary service area of the hospital has a population of 425,189 people, 196,452 people from Sangamon County and 228,373 people from the surrounding counties. Additionally, St. John's provides tertiary care to residents of Bond, Brown, Clay, Coles, De Witt, Effingham, Fayette, Greene, Marion, Mason, Moultrie, Piatt, Pike, Schuyler and Shelby counties. Aside from the city of Springfield, the economy of St. John's service area is primarily rural and is supported by small businesses, industries, mining and agriculture. Springfield, on the other hand, is an urban area supported by large businesses, such as the Illinois State Government and other industries. Based on 2017 population estimates derived from the 2010 census, Sangamon County's population of 196,452 people is comprised of 82.4 percent Caucasians, 12.9 percent African Americans, 0.5 percent American Indians/Alaska Natives, 2.0 percent Asians and 2.3 percent Hispanic or Latino. Ninety two percent of Sangamon County's residents over 25 have a high school diploma or higher. The current (as of July 20181) unemployment rate of Sangamon County is 4.1 percent, according to the US Bureau of Labor Statistics, and the median household income is $56,742. St. John's secondary service area is comprised of 228,373 people, of whom 88.72 percent are Caucasian, 7.38 percent are African-American, 0.22 percent are American Indian/Alaska Native, 1.08 percent are Asian, 0.02 percent are Native Hawaiian/Other Pacific Islander, 0.85 percent state another race and 1.75 percent state two or more races. Educational levels of this population reflect that 35.44 percent graduated high school, 8.17 percent graduated with an associate's degree, 14.84 percent graduated with a bachelor's degree, 5.76 percent graduated with a master's degree and 2.42 percent graduated with either a professional school degree or a doctorate degree. The average unemployment rate of the combined counties is 6.74 percent and the median household income is $47,525. Within St. John's Hospital's service area 17.12 percent of the population is living below the Federal Poverty Level (FPL). This is higher than the statewide poverty level of 15 percent. This indicator is relevant because poverty creates barriers to access including health services, nutritional food and other necessities that contribute to poor health status. St. John's Hospital, employs more than 2,300 people, is a regional medical center and the flagship hospital of Hospital Sisters Health System. Dedicated to providing exceptional care to the whole patient, St. John's offers services spanning from primary care to complex tertiary care, including a Level I Trauma Center, a Birth Center, a Cancer Institute, a Children's Hospital, a Neurosciences Institute, a Pain Management Center, Prairie Heart Institute, a Regional Wound Care Center, a Sleep Center and many others. St. John's Hospital service area is comprised of approximately 868.90 (2010) square miles with a population of approximately 200,258 (2014) and a population density of 227.40 (2010) per square mile. The service area consists of 4-cities, 26-townships, 23-villages and 22-unincorporated communities. The hospital does not exclude Medically Underserved Areas (MUAs), low income or minority populations from its service area."
202011409349300726,370661238,"Schedule H, Part VI, Line 5 Promotion of community health","As a healing ministry of the Catholic Church and an affiliate of Hospital Sisters Health System (HSHS), St. John's Hospital is committed to delivering high quality, compassionate, and cost-effective health care services to all. Founded in 1875, the hospital brings a healing presence and improves the health of our community, especially those persons who are sick, poor, and disadvantaged. Because of the hospital's mission and heritage, the hospital is dedicated to promoting the health of Springfield and surrounding areas. The hospital is governed by a Board of Directors, most of whom reside in the hospital's primary service area and are neither employees nor independent contractors of the hospital (nor family members thereof). The Board ensures that St. John's Hospital is responding to community need. In FY2019, for example, for example, the Board reviewed the Community Health Needs Assessment and approved an Implementation Plan for addressing selected health focus areas. The hospital also has a Patient and Family Advisory Council, Foundation Board, Caregiver Interfaith Volunteer Services Committee, and Samaritan Volunteers that help the hospital connect with the community. Consistent with its exempt purpose, St. John's Hospital has an open medical staff with privileges available to all qualified physicians in the area. The hospital also operates an emergency department that is open 24 hours to all persons regardless of their ability to pay. As a not-for-profit hospital, St. John's Hospital reinvests surplus funds to support the mission of the organization and promote the health of the community rather than distributing surplus funds as profits to shareholders or individuals. Funds not committed to ongoing operations are generally used to upgrade facilities, secure new technologies, improve patient care, and support initiatives designed to promote health and ensure access for all, provide medical education and conduct medical research. For example, St. John's Hospital provided $459,685 for financial counselors to assist patients and community members in accessing charity care, signing up for Medicare / Medicaid, and enrolling through the Marketplace. Additionally, St. John's provided $59,222 to support community health worker programs to meet high risk, underserved patients and community members in their home. St. John's provided $401,157 for medical research and $13,464,606 for medical education. St. John's Hospital also devotes significant resources to access for patients who cannot afford care, along with other Community Benefits. In FY2019, St. Johns' Hospital provided $54,941,047 million in Community Benefit, including financial assistance at cost, unpaid costs of Medicaid and other public programs, and a range of diverse programs designed to enhance access and improve community health. Additionally, in FY2019, St. John's provided $559,074 (at cost) in uncompensated care to patients who did not qualify for charity care or public assistance and more than $25.2 million (at cost) in excess of Medicare payment for health care services. St. John's Hospital provides a range of Community Benefit initiatives and programs that further our mission and long-standing commitment to our community. In many cases, these Community Benefits would not exist without the leadership role played by St. Johns' Hospital and they often relieve a burden that would otherwise be carried by government."
202011409349300726,370661238,"Schedule H, Part VI, Line 6 Affiliated health care system","Headquartered in Springfield, Illinois, Hospital Sisters Health System (HSHS) is a highly integrated, multi-institutional health care system comprised of 15 hospitals and more than 200 physician practice sites in Illinois and Wisconsin. HSHS is sponsored by Hospital Sisters Ministries (HSM), which is a public juridic person of the Roman Catholic Church. HSHS continues the health care ministries begun by its founders, the Hospital Sisters of St. Francis, more than 140 years ago, in rural and midsized communities throughout Illinois and Wisconsin. HSHS provides compassionate, holistic, high quality, and cost-effective health care through its acute care hospitals, physician practices, home health programs, palliative and hospice programs, and community outreach services. In addition, HSHS affiliated hospitals include critical access facilities that offer essential health services that otherwise would not be available in many communities. Our mission calls us to reveal and embody Christ's healing love for all people, and we extend our high quality Franciscan health care ministry beyond the walls of our hospitals by providing community health improvement services with special emphasis on the poor and vulnerable. In addition to providing community health improvement services to the broader community, HSHS cares for everyone who comes to its facilities, regardless of their ability to pay. In tandem with a variety of cross sector community partners, HSHS's Community Benefit initiatives are strategically planned and professionally implemented to improve access to health care services; enhance the health of the community; advance medical or general health care knowledge; and relieve or reduce the burden of government to improve health. In FY2019, HSHS collectively provided $211.7 million in Community Benefit (9.2% of total hospital expenses). This amount included $27.7 million provided for Financial Assistance (a.k.a. Charity Care) and $142.3 million for unreimbursed care provided as part of the Medicaid program. In addition, HSHS hospitals committed significant resources to treat Medicare patients. The cost of providing services to primarily elderly beneficiaries of the Medicare program - in excess of governmental and managed care contract payments - was $279.9 million. HSHS hospitals also recorded $41.1 million in uncollectible accounts. While HSHS does not count the latter two amounts as Community Benefit, they nonetheless reflect our commitment to serving all persons in need of care. In addition to the dollars invested in our Community Benefit programs, HSHS continues to reinvest any surplus revenue from operations and investments into new medical technology, facility infrastructure and health care services in our communities. By doing so, we ensure our ability to meet the ongoing demand for high quality, efficient and easily accessible health care."

A REPORT IN THE JOURNAL OF AMERICAN MEDICAL ASSOCIATION AND THE CENTER FOR DISEASE CONTROL (MCGINNIS, 1996) SUGGESTS THAT THE FACTORS IMPACTING HEALTH ARE AS FOLLOWS: LIFESTYLE AND BEHAVIORS, 50%, ENVIRONMENT (HUMAN AND NATURAL), 20%, GENETICS AND HUMAN BIOLOGY, 20%, AND HEALTH CARE, 10%. COMMUNITY BUILDING ACTIVITIES HELP TO ADDRESS THE OTHER INDICATORS OUTSIDE OF THE ROLE TRADITIONALLY PLAYED BY HEALTH-CARE ORGANIZATIONS. THESE ACTIVITIES ARE ALMOST EXCLUSIVELY DONE IN SOME FORM OF PARTNERSHIP IN WHICH THE COMMUNITY OR OTHER ORGANIZATIONS ARE BETTER SUITED TO ADDRESS. HEALTH-CARE ORGANIZATIONS GENERALLY PROVIDE TIMELY AND SPECIFIC RESOURCES TO HELP THESE ISSUES. HEALTH-CARE ORGANIZATIONS CAN BE A RICH AND VALUABLE COMMUNITY RESOURCE IN WAYS NOT TYPICALLY CONSIDERED. OFTEN THE MOST EFFECTIVE WAY TO HELP IMPACT AND IMPROVE THE COMMUNITY HEALTH STATUS IS TO SUPPORT OTHER AGENCIES AND ORGANIZATIONS IN A VARIETY OF WAYS OUTSIDE OF HEALTH SERVICES.

These records include the amount of charges forgone based on established rates for services and supplies furnished under its charity care and community service policies and the estimated cost of these services. Payments from Medicare are generally less than York Hospital's costs of providing the service.

Upon final PARO (Payment Assistance Rank Ordering) scoring, if a patient qualifies for presumptive charity, their account would not be forwarded to any third party collections. It shall be the policy of Patient Administrative Services to recommend accounts to Bad Debt on a timely basis. Inpatient/Outpatient accounts will go to bad debt automatically after the account has been in the financial class Pending Bad Debt for 30 days. All accounts must follow the approved limits for refunds and write offs, as established in Policy PF-102, before being transferred. The primary agencies will work the accounts for 6 months or until they feel it is uncollectable and return the account. The accounts are forwarded to secondary agencies from the primary agencies Closed and Return Reports. The financial class is changed to Bad Debt Other after the Closed and Return Reports are received from the Secondary Agency. The agencies must get written approval from the manager in the relatively rare instance of legal action being taken to collect the debt."
202031539349301893,231352222,"Part VI, Line 2 - Needs Assessment","WellSpan Health and its entities have a long history of understanding and responding to the needs of the communities and populations it serves. This commitment was strengthened in 1998 when, in partnership with the Healthy York County Coalition, WellSpan conducted its first Community Health Needs Assessment (CHNA). Six subsequent CHNAs were conducted in 2000, 2005, 2008, 2012, 2015 and 2018. These assessments- one method for collecting diverse information on a community and which involves surveying a representative sample of community members on their demographics, chronic health conditions, lifestyle behaviors, finances, access to health services, and related topics- have been administered before the Affordable Care Act (ACA) requirement. As previously noted, the WellSpan CHNA process, which includes survey development, data collection and analysis, and result dissemination, was led by both county-level health coalitions- Healthy Adams County and the Healthy York County Coalition- for Adams and York Counties. A similar process was utilized for the remaining counties of the WellSpan service area, including northern Lancaster and Lebanon counties. Healthy Adams County, Healthy York County Coalition, and its regional partner the Community Health Council of Lebanon County receive financial support from WellSpan Health and its entities, and other community stakeholders. The CHNA was developed utilizing consulting support and guidance through a contract with the Floyd Institute for Public Policy at Franklin and Marshall College. Dr. Berwood Yost, Institute Director and Project Lead has an extensive background conducting and analyzing community and corporate surveys and has been integral to the prior three CHNAs (2008, 2012 and 2015). The 2018 Adams and York CHNA is a byproduct of a collaboration of community organizations who partnered to provide guidance and support to the effort, including: County of York, Family First Health; Gettysburg College; UPMC Pinnacle Hanover; UPMC Pinnacle Memorial; York County Human Services; South Central Community Action Program (SCCAP); TrueNorth Wellness Services; United Way of York County; York City Health Bureau; York College of Pennsylvania, and; York County Community Foundation. This collaboration of community stakeholders determined the survey questions to be asked of the community; discussed data collection methodology, including sample size and method of obtaining data; reviewed the raw data and supporting charts/ graphs; identified potential community health priorities, and; developed the process by which results and priorities were to be shared with the community. The 2018 CHNA planning process engaged a wide range of community organizations serving the diverse interests of all partners. The intent of the CHNA was to collect adequate valuable data and information that would satisfy the needs of all participating organizations, without burdening CHNA respondents with too many questions. Committee members reviewed questions asked in the 2015 CHNA and edited accordingly based on the current health care environment and areas of interest. Survey questions were derived from the Behavioral Risk Factor Surveillance System (BRFSS), a validated survey tool utilized by the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC), and organized into four categories: healthcare access, behavioral risk, health conditions and prevention behaviors and context. A representative sample of 799 adult residents in York County were interviewed between December 4, 2017 and February 25, 2018. Supplemental secondary data from the Robert Wood Johnson Foundation (RWJF) annual County Health Rankings and from the Pennsylvania Department of Health was compiled and integrated into the 2018 CHNA. Data collected and analyzed by the Floyd Institute for Public Policy included breakdowns by age, gender, geographic area, race/ethnicity, and income level, and enabled the development of charts/ graphs that identified: trends and disparities; quantity of residents affected; health risks and disability-adjusted life years, and; social determinants of health impact. This information is included in the 2018 Community Health Needs Assessment Summary Report available at www.wellspan.org. CHNA results and related priorities identified by Healthy York County Coalition were shared with the system-wide Planning Committee at WellSpan Health, a Committee comprised of community members and leaders that represent each of WellSpans primary entities and service areas, in addition to corporate leadership. Planning Committee members reviewed the CHNA data, and designated system-wide priorities as: Care for all, including a focus on access to care and health equity; Behavioral health and lifelong wellness, which would incorporate behavioral health, substance use and addiction and lifelong wellness, and; healthy communities and social determinants of health, which provide a deeper dive into community engagement, social determinants of health and violence prevention. The identified priorities and associated data were subsequently presented to the WellSpan- York Hospital Board for their adoption. Board members discussed the data and identified priorities within the context of existing staffing and financial resources, current and future entity initiatives, and community partnership opportunities to address systemic community change. The final CHNA report, along with the WellSpan Community Health Improvement Plan (CHIP) was presented in June 2019 to the Planning Committee, at which time correlations were observed between the CHNA, CHIP and the WellSpan 2025 Strategic Plan."
202031539349301893,231352222,"Part VI, Line 5 - Promotion of Community Health","As a charitable, community-based healthcare organization, our commitment to improving the lives and well-being of the people and communities we serve is evident in our mission statement: working as one to improve health through exceptional care for all, lifelong wellness, and healthier communities."" Employees live out this mission statement every day by engaging in community benefit activities that address community needs, especially the health priorities identified in the 2018 CHNA - access to care and health equity; behavioral health, substance use and addiction, and lifelong wellness, and community engagement, social determinants of health and violence prevention. Below are a few examples of the work accomplished to address each: *Access to healthcare and medications for uninsured community members or those with high out-of-pocket costs is often financially challenging. Healthy Community Network, a collaborative between WellSpan Health, physicians and community partners to support prospective enrollment, the management and support of patients, and coordination of care, serves as a support for those individuals, offering free or discounted resources based on need. In 2019, Healthy Community Network served 3,200 community members in need of care across the region and provided financial assistance for 12,000 prescriptions, allowing individuals who lack sufficient health insurance or financial means to access the medications they need.*WellSpan remains committed to the strong safety net of partnering health care services in our region. Together, we demonstrate strong community impact in health. For example, WellSpans support of the Family First Health Hannah Penn Center enhanced its ability to provide 4,241 acute and preventive visits for underserved adults and children. *In 2019, WellSpan Health encouraged community members, local employers and employees, and WellSpan staff and patients to engage in the 7th annual 10 Pound Throwdown initiative. The 10 Pound Throwdown is a 10-week community challenge that encourages participants to lose or maintain a healthy weight through healthier eating and increased physical activity. The initiative was created in 2013 to address the growing issue of adult overweight/obesity and utilizes a core website (www.10poundthrowdown.com) to encourage team participation and to offer an online weight tracker, badges to encourage healthier choices, and diverse health education resources. In 2019, the 10 Pound Throwdown engaged 6,400 community members across four southcentral Pennsylvania counties -Adams, Lancaster, Lebanon, and York- participated in the 2019 iteration of the 10 Pound Throwdown program. *WellSpan Health -York Hospital primary care practices in York County participated in the Market Bucks program to address food insecurity and increase the consumption of fruits and vegetables. Regionally, this program provided fruit and vegetable vouchers to 239 WellSpan patients with food insecurity challenges, which contributed nearly $28,000 to local farmers and growers. This program reaches those with an elevated Body Mass Index (BMI) who also experience a comorbidity associated with diet. Market Bucks consistently boasts an astounding 86% redemption rate, in addition to demonstrating increased fruit and vegetable consumption for participants with medical challenges. *WellSpans commitment to lifelong wellness begins with the support it provides to our youngest residents. WellSpan- York Hospital remains the lead agency for Safe Kids York County, distributed nearly 10,000 books to children through our Reach Out and Read program, engaged more than 400 children and families in child abuse prevention programs, and distributed more than 200 cribs to families without a safe place for their baby to sleep. *Celebrating more than a decade of promoting summertime physical activity, Get Outdoors (GO) York!, a partnership between WellSpan-York Hospital and York County Libraries, more than 9,000 children participated in an adaptation of letterboxing, an international hobby where participants use written clues to find items hidden in various places. *Opioid use, as in other communities across the United States, has become a crisis in York County. WellSpan remains a steadfast partner in advancing work in this area. In 2019, Community Partnership Grant funds supported both the Project Lazarus opioid overdose prevention program, and a drug treatment program called Gaudenzia Inc. in a very desolate region within York County. Additionally, WellSpan admitted 476 patients into a Medication Assisted Treatment (MAT) program, which combines the use of medications and behavioral therapy to treat people with substance use disorders. WellSpan offered support and leadership to the York Opioid Collaborative, which continues to gain traction in the community and welcomed a new executive director in 2019. *WellSpan Health and its community partners have been working to address housing insecurity in central Pennsylvania. Three of the collaborative solutions- the Omega Bed Lease Program, Arches to Wellness and ALPHA Community Initiative- earned the Hospital and Healthsystem Association of Pennsylvania (HAP) 2019 Living the Vision award. *Historically, WellSpan Health and its entities have taken planned steps to build community capacity that addresses complex health issues, as identified by the Community Health Needs Assessment (CHNA). Through financial and management support of a county health coalition, the Healthy York County Coalition (HYCC), more than 200 York County community members have been engaged in community health improvement initiatives. HYCC consists of three committees -Access and Empowerment; Community Engagement, and; Prevention and Wellness, each of which continue to attract new community members, leaders, and professionals. These committees foster partnerships and collaboration between entities to ensure that efforts to address and impact identified community health needs are coordinated and successful. In 2019, the Healthy York County Coalition prepared research on York County residents life expectancy variance by zip code. *WellSpan-York Hospital maintains its commitment to supporting local non-projects with Community Partnership Grant funds to like-minded nonprofit organizations to address key issues and health priorities. In 2019, WellSpan- York Hospital also awarded grants to the York County Food Bank, VisionCorps, the York County Public Library system, and the YWCA Dialogues on Race effort. Additional examples of how WellSpan-York Hospital fulfilled its community mission in York County may be found in the 2019 WellSpan Community Benefit Report available online at www.wellspan.org."

LVHN THEN PARTNERED WITH COMMUNITY AND EDUCATIONAL INSTITUTIONS TO OBTAIN INPUT (PRIMARY DATA) FROM COMMUNITY MEMBERS IN EACH COUNTY IN ORDER TO VALIDATE THE FINDINGS OF THE SECONDARY DATA COLLECTION. THESE COMMUNITY PARTNERS CONDUCTED FOCUS GROUPS AND KEY INFORMANT INTERVIEWS TO REVIEW THE FINDINGS OF THE SECONDARY DATA COLLECTION AND ALLOW THE COMMUNITY TO IDENTIFY ANY OTHER NEEDS NOT MENTIONED. THE SECONDARY AND PRIMARY DATA WERE THEN COMBINED INTO ONE HEALTH PROFILE FOR EACH COUNTY, WHICH PROVIDES AN OVERVIEW OF THE CURRENT STATE OF HEALTH IN EACH OF THE COUNTIES LVHN SERVES.

THE SECOND COMPONENT OF THE LVHN'S CHNA INCLUDES AN IMPLEMENTATION PLAN, WHICH OUTLINES OUR PLAN TO ADDRESS THE NEEDS IDENTIFIED IN THE HEALTH PROFILE OVER THE COURSE OF THE NEXT THREE YEARS. THE 2019 IMPLEMENTATION PLAN WILL BE SHARED AS A SEPARATE REPORT SOON AFTER THE HEALTH PROFILES ARE RELEASED.THE 2019 LVHN CHNA HEALTH PROFILE IS BROKEN OUT INTO THREE PRIMARY SECTIONS: DEMOGRAPHICS, HEALTH FACTORS, AND HEALTH OUTCOMES. THE DEMOGRAPHICS SECTION INCLUDES INFORMATION THAT PROVIDES A DESCRIPTION OF THE INDIVIDUALS LIVING IN THE COMMUNITY. THE HEALTH FACTORS SECTION INCLUDES INFORMATION ABOUT SOCIAL FACTORS, ENVIRONMENTAL FACTORS, HEALTH BEHAVIORS, AND THE QUALITY AND AVAILABILITY OF HEALTH CARE IN THE AREA. THE FINAL SECTION, HEALTH OUTCOMES, LOOKS AT THE OCCURRENCE OF CHRONIC CONDITIONS, SUCH AS ASTHMA AND HEART DISEASE, AS WELL AS RATES OF CANCER AND THE LEADING CAUSES OF DEATH. TO INCREASE THE READABILITY OF THE REPORT, THE COMMUNITY WILL FIND THREE TYPES OF CALL-OUT BOXES THROUGHOUT THE CHNA HEALTH PROFILES. THE FIRST TYPE SUMMARIZES SOME OF THE DATA PRESENTED ON THAT PAGE IN ORDER TO PROVIDE EASY-TO-READ, SUMMARY STATEMENTS OF IMPORTANT DATA ABOUT THE COMMUNITY.

SPECIFIC GOALS AND STRATEGIES MAY OR MAY NOT BE OBTAINED AND, UPON EVALUATION AND THE AVAILABILITY OF NEW INFORMATION AND DEVELOPMENTS, MAY NEED TO BE MODIFIED. A SUCCESSFUL STRATEGIC PLAN RECOGNIZES THIS POTENTIAL FOR CHANGE AND IS FLEXIBLE ENOUGH TO ACCOMMODATE NEW OR DIFFERENT OPPORTUNITIES AND CHALLENGES.CRITICAL HEALTH CARE ISSUESTHE HEALTH CARE INDUSTRY IS UNDER CONSTANT SCRUTINY TO PROVIDE AFFORDABLE HEALTH CARE SERVICES THAT ARE ALSO OF THE HIGHEST QUALITY. A HOSPITAL'S ABILITY TO ACCOMPLISH THIS GOAL IS INFLUENCED BY SEVERAL FACTORS. FOLLOWING IS A LISTING OF CRITICAL ISSUES THAT WILL CONTINUE TO AFFECT HOSPITALS' ABILITY TO PERFORM.1. QUALITY: HEALTH CARE QUALITY AND SAFETY HAVE BEEN STRATEGICALLY IMPORTANT FOR SEVERAL YEARS. WIDESPREAD PUBLIC REPORTING OF HOSPITAL QUALITY RESULTS AND VALUE BASED PAYMENT MODELS HAVE POSITIONED QUALITY AT THE FOREFRONT OF HEALTHCARE DELIVERY. RECRUITMENT AND RETENTION OF HIGHLY SKILLED DOCTORS AND NURSES, COMBINED WITH CAPABLE INFORMATION SYSTEMS ARE CRITICAL TO MEET THE HIGH STANDARDS SET TODAY IN HEALTHCARE. CONCEPTS SUCH AS: ""RE-ADMISSIONS"", HOSPITAL ACQUIRED INFECTIONS, FALL FREQUENCY AND PREVENTABLE MEDICATION ERRORS ARE HOUSEHOLD WORDS WHEN IT COMES TO EVALUATING A HOSPITAL'S QUALITY TODAY. HOSPITALS MUST MARSHAL THE NOTED RESOURCES AND PROVIDE HIGH-END CARE AS COMPARED TO OTHERS. THE VALUE BASED PAYMENT METHODOLOGIES ALSO HAVE SIGNIFICANT FINANCIAL IMPLICATIONS FOR HOSPITALS TODAY. CONSUMERS WILL CONTINUE TO SEEK OUT MORE AND MORE QUALITY DATA UPON WHICH TO BASE CARE DECISIONS ON.2. INFORMATION TECHNOLOGY: HEALTH INFORMATION TECHNOLOGY INCLUDES COMPUTER BASED TOOLS DEVELOPED SPECIFICALLY FOR HEALTH CARE DELIVERY. THESE TOOLS CAN PROVIDE CLINICIANS UP-TO-DATE INFORMATION ON THEIR PATIENTS, ACCESS TO THE LATEST MEDICAL KNOWLEDGE AND BEST PRACTICES THROUGH DECISION SUPPORT SYSTEMS. IT IS UNDERSTOOD THAT INVESTMENTS IN NEW CLINICAL AND INFORMATION TECHNOLOGY CAN SIGNIFICANTLY ENHANCE PATIENT SAFETY AND CLINICAL OUTCOMES. COMPUTERIZED PHYSICIAN ORDER ENTRY (CPOE), BAR CODING AND ITS POTENTIAL TO REDUCE MEDICATION ERRORS, AND ELECTRONIC MEDICAL RECORDS (EMRS) AND THEIR POSITIVE IMPACT ON MEDICAL ERRORS ARE ALL EXAMPLES OF HEALTH CARE'S USE OF IT SOLUTIONS TO IMPROVE QUALITY. THE FEDERAL GOVERNMENT HAS HIGHLIGHTED THE ROLE OF HEALTH INFORMATION TECHNOLOGY AS A MEANS TO IMPROVE HEALTH CARE QUALITY, SAFETY PROVIDED STIMULUS AND INCENTIVE PAYMENTS TO PROVIDERS TO FACILITATE AND HASTEN THEIR ADOPTION INTO THE CARE DELIVERY PROCESS. EMR'S HAVE BECOME A PREREQUISITE OF ANY DELIVERY SYSTEM THAT INTENDS TO PROVIDE COORDINATED COST EFFECTIVE CARE.3. PHYSICIANS: PHYSICIANS HAVE EMERGED AS CRITICAL OPERATIONAL AND STRATEGIC PARTNERS TO HOSPITALS. THOSE THAT ARE SUCCESSFUL IN ENGAGING AND COLLABORATING WITH THEIR MEDICAL STAFF WILL BE BEST ABLE TO DEMONSTRATE HIGH QUALITY CARE AND COMPLIANCE WITH HEALTH REFORM'S VALUE BASED PURCHASING AND OTHER QUALITY MANDATES. THE ABILITY TO SUCCESSFULLY RECRUIT PHYSICIANS WILL BE CRITICAL. AT A TIME WHEN HEALTHCARE EMPHASIZES THE ROLE OF PRIMARY CARE, THERE IS A SPECIAL NEED TO INTENSIFY EFFORTS TO RECRUIT, RETAIN AND AGGREGATE PRIMARY CARE PROVIDERS. BECAUSE THE VAST MAJORITY OF NEW PHYSICIANS PREFER EMPLOYMENT AS THEIR PRACTICE PREFERENCE, THE ABILITY OF HOSPITALS TO BE ABLE TO OFFER PHYSICIANS A CONTEMPORARY AND COMPETITIVE ""EMPLOYMENT PLATFORM"" IS ESSENTIAL.4. FINANCE AND CAPITAL: FINANCIAL PERFORMANCE AND ACCESS TO CAPITAL WILL CONTINUE TO BE AMONG THE MOST CRITICAL ISSUES CONFRONTING HOSPITALS. EVEN WITH HEALTHCARE REFORM EFFORTS, HEALTHCARE COSTS WILL CONTINUE TO OUTPACE INFLATION. INCREASING WAGE AND SALARY COSTS, AND RISING HEALTH CARE COSTS IN GENERAL WILL CONTINUE TO IMPACT OPERATING PERFORMANCE AND PRESS HOSPITALS TO CONTINUE A RELENTLESS FOCUS ON COST MANAGEMENT. ADDITIONALLY, REVENUE STRATEGIES WILL NEED TO BE DEVELOPED TO GENERATE PROFITABLE GROWTH IN PATIENT VOLUME, AS WILL THE NEED TO ENSURE OPTIMAL MANAGEMENT OF ALL REVENUE CYCLE ACTIVITIES. HOSPITALS ARE FACING SIGNIFICANT ANNUAL PAYMENT REDUCTIONS IN TERMS OF DECREASES IN MEDICARE UPDATES, DISPROPORTIONATE SHARE, SNF AND HOMECARE PAYMENTS, AND MEDICAID PAYMENT LEVELS. AS HOSPITALS CONTINUE TO POST LOW OR NO PROFIT MARGINS, INVESTMENT INCOME WILL BE MORE IMPORTANT THAN EVER. HOWEVER, GIVEN THE FACT THAT INVESTMENT INCOME IS A HIGHLY UNCERTAIN COMPONENT OF A HOSPITAL'S OVERALL FINANCIAL HEALTH, HOSPITALS WILL BE DRIVEN TO PURSUE MORE PHILANTHROPY. HOSPITAL CAPITAL SPENDING WILL BE DRIVEN BY GROWING DEMANDS FOR ADVANCED TECHNOLOGY NEEDED TO ENSURE PATIENT QUALITY AND SAFETY, THE NEED TO REPLACE AND UPDATE AGING FACILITIES, AND THE DESIRE AND NEED TO IMPROVE TECHNOLOGY BASED SERVICES.SEE CONTINUATION AT THE END OF PART VI."

The hospitals FY18 CHNA and three-year Implementation Strategies were endorsed by MWHCs Board of Directors and approved by the MedStar Health Board of Directors. The document became available on the hospitals website on June 30, 2018. During FY19, key revisions were made across MedStar Health to more effectively impact the communities served throughout Maryland and Washington, DC. Several internal meetings were convened with leadership from each MedStar Health Hospital to review current practices and strategies. As a result of these meetings, the approach to the current CHNA for the remainder of the three-year cycle (FY19-FY21) was revised. A key revision to the CHNA is a greater focus on hospital area strategies that are most appropriate for the local communities served. The number of strategies each hospital is accountable for executing was reduced to encourage more meaningful reach within key areas contrasted with broader reach with reduced impact. Using the standard categories, Health and Wellness, Access to Care and Social Determinants of Health to determine what to prioritize for the CHNA IRS requirements, each hospital agreed to select two to three strategies as priorities that have size and scale impact and measurable outcomes. All other programming was integrated as part of the hospitals overall community health portfolio. These additional programs were captured in the inventory for the whole picture of contributing to the health of the communities served as well as sorted for what counts as community benefit for regulatory reporting. The hospitals Community Benefit Service Area (CBSA) remains the same, based on the Advisory Task Force (ATF) recommendation. The hospital identified District of Columbia Wards 7 and 8 as its CBSA, which includes all residents living in ZIP codes 20011, 20019 and 20020. The hospital selected this geographic area based on hospital utilization data and secondary public health data as well as its proximity to the hospital. The ATF included a diverse group of individuals, including hospital leaders, grassroots activists, community residents, faith-based leaders, hospital representatives, public health leaders and other stakeholder organizations, such as representatives from local health departments. MWHCs health priorities for the CBSA include health and wellness (chronic disease prevention and management) and social determinants of health (social needs screening). As a proud member of MedStar Health, representatives from MWHC routinely participate in the MedStar Health community health workgroup. The workgroup is comprised of community health professionals who represent all ten MedStar hospitals.

Priority areas, as determined by the 2018 CHNA, fall under three areas of focus including health and wellness, access to care, and social determinants of health. Programs include (but are not limited to): Health and Wellness Educational Programs are offered with the goal of improving community health and well-being. For example, the Living Well Chronic Disease Prevention and Management is a free seven-week health education and behavior change program focused on chronic disease self-management. The program is designed for adults living with a chronic condition, such as heart disease, diabetes, cancer, depression, chronic pain, arthritis, lung disease, multiple sclerosis or any chronic health concern. In addition, additional classes are offered such as Diabetes Self-Management, smoking cessation, nutrition, and weight management classes. Community Violence Intervention Program provides services to individuals, and their families, who have experienced a life-threatening intentional injury. The program engages with victims and their families to create a support system that can lead to long-term change. Team members connect program participants with government and community-based services to promote healing, reduce revictimization, and prevent future violence. Support groups are offered to community members for a variety of topics including mental health, prostate cancer, multiple sclerosis, diabetes, breastfeeding, cancer, and stroke. Staff participate in community health events such as health fairs, festivals and expositions where screenings are performed, and health information is shared. Outreach is also provided in-person and virtually, hospital staff share their knowledge with the community through engaging interviews, seminars, blogs and videos. Access to Care Patient Financial Services provides financial assistance to uninsured patients who reside within the community by assisting with enrollment in publicly-funded entitlement programs, referring patients to State or Federal Insurance Exchange navigator resources and assisting with consideration of funding that may be available from other charitable organizations.

They focus on root causes of health problems such as poverty, homelessness, and environmental hazards. These activities enhance community assets by offering the expertise and resources of the health care organization. Workforce (non-hospital) development: Bridges Connections District 201 Bridges Connections District 201 is designed to help special needs students learn marketable skills through on the job training. Up to three students receive two hours of supervised job training for each day during the school year. Each student progresses through a three-phase program. Bridges enhances this high-risk population's ability to be productive members of our community. The Bridges program has successfully transitioned two students into part-time colleagues at St. Elizabeth's. Providing opportunities to special needs young adults builds one's confidence and encourages them to seek employment. Leadership Development: Leadership Belleville Partnerships with community business leaders is an important part of furthering positive perceptions of St. Elizabeth's as a healing and caring organization. One HSHS St. Elizabeth's leader participated in many community functions to further convey our message of commitment to Southwestern Illinois. Leadership Belleville is a 9-month commitment and unique training program for individuals who have demonstrated high leadership qualities. HSHS St. Elizabeth's is committed to this program on an annual basis by hosting an event at the hospital and ensuring one leader is actively involved each year. Coalition Building: BASIC Initiative (Belleville Achieves Strength in Character) BASIC is a partnership of schools, the City of Belleville, and the business community to strengthen character in our youth and in the community. BASIC encourages youth and adults to be productive citizens in our community. The BASIC initiative is very active in the schools and builds a child's spirit of self-worth and value. HSHS St. Elizabeth's is an active board member of this organization. Annually, students and adults are recognized for service to the community, emphasizing the value of each awardee from all walks of life. Coalition Building: St. Clair County Health Commission St. Elizabeth's Hospital initiated practices that later became part of the health department when they formed in 1985. A member of St. Elizabeth's participates in the Health Care Commission. The Health Care Commission, founded in 1991, is a 20 plus member organization that serves as a public health system to establish priority health issues, mobilize resources to meet identified needs, and promote the health and well-being of the all-county residents. As a result of the policy summit in spring of 2017, a collective impact movement is now underway to address specific health issues in the county. Community Support: Emergency Management and Disaster Preparedness- St. Elizabeth's is a community leader for emergency management. Our EMS coordinator is on the advisory council for two counties and is certified by the National Incident Management System (NIMS) and Incident Command Structure (ICS). In conjunction with our sister hospital, St. Anthony Memorial Hospital in Effingham, he taught 84 students NIMS and ICS. However, it is his involvement in the Local Emergency Planning Committees (LEPC) that integrates and prepares St. Elizabeth's to respond effectively in a disaster. Three HSHS St. Elizabeth's colleagues trained in emergency management served as instructors and evaluators at a local full scale railroad derailment mass casualty exercise and a full scale active shooter exercise. In addition, St. Elizabeth's is now the St. Clair County EMS resource hospital. The EMS team provides local support for world events such as the 2017 eclipse, as well as Songs for Soldiers and the Belleville Marathon. Community Support: Pregnancy Care Center The hospital provides space for the Pregnancy Care Center (PCC) on the hospital campus. The PCC provides free services including pregnancy tests, referrals for medical care, WIC and other resource information; the hospital supports these efforts. In addition, the PCC provides clothing and supplies to those with financial needs. Due to the recent move of the hospital, the PCC moved into a renovated space that creates a warm and welcoming environment for their clients. The Mother Child Department collects items for the PCC and annually a community baby shower is held to obtain donations for the center; often colleagues give generously to this organization. Community Support: Social Agency Donations Food, hygiene products, and school supply drives were conducted in collaboration with local social agencies such as St Vincent DePaul, Catholic Urban Programs, the Violence Prevention Center. Seventy-six school back packs stuffed with school supplies were donated to colleagues' students in need and an additional 75 pounds were donated to the Violence Prevention Center, a women's shelter. HSHS St. Elizabeth's partners with the local blood services and provides a location for blood donation and contributes to incentives to encourage colleagues and the public to participate. A colleague also serves on the board for the Center of Autism. St. Elizabeth's has a positive long standing relationship with St. Vincent DePaul (SVDP) in East St. Louis. The building that houses Cosgrove's Soup Kitchen and a thrift store underwent a complete remodel, and needed many items. Through careful planning and inventorying of resources at the old facility and after the move, HSHS St. Elizabeth's facilitated the donation of numerous items needed for the renovation, thus reducing St. Vincent DePaul's overhead costs. The hospital also donated canned and frozen food, metal rolling racks, kitchen supplies, and paper products. With the hospital move from Belleville to O'Fallon, some equipment was either obsolete or incompatible with the new technology at the new hospital. This surplus allowed for generous donations to the community and HSHS Mission Outreach, our regional medical surplus partner. Mission Outreach received their largest donation ever from St. Elizabeth's Hospital. In addition, many local agencies benefited and obtained items that would either improve their work or make life more comfortable. Such agencies included the local health department, a high school, a priest retirement home and a low-income school. Community Health improvement and advocacy: Behavioral Health Care HSHS St. Elizabeth's is a member of the Metro-East Behavioral Health Network Council. This is a group of agencies within our community that share resources and implement new treatment strategies for our patients with psychiatric needs. Even though St. Elizabeth's does not have mental health services, it is aligned with area facilities and specialists that accommodate our patient population. To facilitate the care of mental health patients a mental health nurse practitioner is on staff to assess the needs of this patient population. Athletes Advantage Sports Medicine HSHS Athletes Advantage Sports Medicine provides certified athletic trainers to local schools. Although the program has been in effect for 15 years, HSHS St. Elizabeth's joined forces in 2017 by providing resources to two area high schools. The commitment to provide on-site, quality medical care to local athletes was and continues to be our goal. With the addition of the ImPACT Concussion program in 2015, Athletics Advantage provides baselines free of charge to partner schools. The Athletes Advantage team consists of certified athletic trainers, board-certified sports medicine physicians with over 30 years of combined experience and credentialed ImPACT consultants, board-certified orthopedic surgeons with specialties in sports medicine and fracture care, and licensed physical therapists with emphasis on rehabilitating sports injuries. they work in conjunction with the certified athletic trainers to ensure a comprehensive rehabilitation and timely return to activity. Community Building activities also included attending the Illinois Hospital Association Advocacy Day where staff and other local health care organizations met our legislators to discuss health care legislation."

Thus, the hospital's bad debt includes a portion that could be classified as charity care if application for such care was sought and/or completed.

202131339349302383,370663567,"Schedule H, Part III, Line 8 Community benefit & methodology for determining medicare costs","The Hospital continually strives to provide excellent patient care in the most cost effective fashion. Nonetheless, the Medicare program, in many cases, does not provide payment that covers the full cost of the care provided. Since it is the mission of the hospital to respond to community need, hospital leadership continually advocates for improved Medicare payment so that the cost of quality care to those patients who are not able to afford it is not compromised and is fairly subsidized by all payers. The IRS does not classify this shortfall in Medicare payments as Community Benefit. However, we believe it is an important contribution made by the hospital to the health and well-being of the community. If the Medicare program did not exist, many Medicare patients would be eligible for financial assistance or other means-tested government programs. Further, by absorbing this shortfall and providing care below cost to these individuals, the Hospital is relieving the burden of the government. Accordingly, this shortfall restricts the Hospital's ability to make funds available to provide for financial assistance and other Community Benefit. The hospital's Medicare shortfall at cost for fiscal year 2020 was $19,237,009."
202131339349302383,370663567,"Schedule H, Part III, Line 9b Collection practices for patients eligible for financial assistance","Every effort is made prior to, during and after provision of medical services to determine whether a patient is eligible for charity/community care and to assist the patient in completing the application and provide adequate documentation. If the patient qualified for charity/community care for the full balance of their account, the entire amount is written off to charity/community care and hence no debt collection is pursued. If the patient qualified for charity/community care for a portion of their account balance, that portion is written off to charity/community care, with the patient being responsible for the remainder of the balance. Additionally, reasonable effort will be made to obtain third-party or government payer reimbursement on behalf of the patient. If those efforts are not fruitful, an offer will be extended to the patient to make installment payments on their balance. Only at such point that the patient defaults on installment payments or refuses to cooperate with the hospital's efforts to be reimbursed will the account be sent to collections. The hospital will make reasonable efforts to determine whether a patient is eligible under the financial assistance policy before it engages in an ECA. To the extent a patient is determined to be eligible for financial assistance under the FAP, the hospital will take all reasonably available measures to reverse any ECA taken against the patient to obtain payment for the care."

Having this presence in the underserved community and having leaders committed to a variety of different community groups, the leaders hear about opportunities that allow the hospital to connect more effectively. Due to this participation one leader serves on the steering committee of a nonprofit that serves low income areas. Because of our presence in the community, HSHS St. Elizabeth's is approached and asked to provide care, education or resources to underserved areas. The hospital also continually assesses the needs of the community through pre- and post-evaluations, patient surveys, the Hospital Advisory Council, and Patient Family Advisory Council. In addition, colleagues who participate in community events complete a survey about their experience. The survey includes a place to add community connections and suggestions from other agencies who may ask us to participate in other events. The community can also visit the hospital's website and submit a request for hospital participation. The Community Benefit/Hospital Advisory Council meets quarterly and discusses opportunities to community involvement. HSHS St. Elizabeth's is often approached to assist and provide medical assistance for events. For example, the hospital provides the medical care for the annual Belleville Marathon and financially supports EMS for services during public community festivities. Whenever the hospital hosts community education events, evaluations include suggestions for additional education or services."
202131339349302383,370663567,"Schedule H, Part VI, Line 3 Patient education of eligibility for assistance","The Registration Department provides brochures to patients upon registration regarding the Financial Assistance Program available to them at the Hospital. The brochures are also supplied in waiting and ancillary areas for easy access by the patient. To better serve our patient population, the Hospital offers information on our financial assistance program in Spanish. This includes the Financial Assistance Policy, Brochure and Application, which allows the hospital to serve populations in its county and the surrounding area for whom Spanish is their primary language. Patients are also provided a Fair Billing Act notification at the point of registration regarding separate physician billing they can expect to receive, plus information about the patient's financial responsibility if their insurance plan is out of network. One-on-one conversations to educate patients about financial assistance often stem from patients receiving a statement or a pre-collection letter. At that point, the customer service representative or cashier, or other qualified staff, will inform/educate the caller about financial assistance options. The first pre-collection letter reminds the patient their account is in delinquent status. It also informs them they may be eligible for financial assistance through the organization's charity care program. The letter provides direct contact information to begin the application process for charity care and lists the Internet address where the policy can be obtained. A third-party vendor also assists individuals in determining their eligibility for state health plans or insurance on the open health insurance marketplace. They can also assist with the application process."
202131339349302383,370663567,"Schedule H, Part VI, Line 4 Community information","HSHS St. Elizabeth's provides services for patients in four counties (St. Clair, Clinton, Madison, and Monroe counties), a total population of more than 600,000 residents. The FY2018 CHNA, however, focused on St. Clair County which has an approximate population of 262,000 which is slightly smaller than Madison County by 3,000 residents. It is the eighth most populous county in the state, however, both counties saw a decrease in population. St. Clair County lost approximately 3% of their residents. Clinton and Monroe counties have a population of 37,00 and 33,000 respectively and are considered rural counties. Belleville, the county seat for St. Clair County, has roughly 44,000 residents. St. Clair County is the oldest county in Illinois and its western border is formed by the Mississippi River and comprises 674 square miles and includes urban, suburban and rural areas. As an organization, HSHS St. Elizabeth's does not exclude Medically Underserved Areas (MUAs), low income or minority populations from its service area. Although the population is aging, the average age is 37.8 years old. The greatest shift in population occurred in the 65 years and older with an increase of 16.8% from the 2010 census. The younger population ages 18-64 and under 5 years of age showed a decline in population of 6% and 7% respectfully. The population consists mostly of white (62.1%) and African American (30.4%). All races and ethnicities increased except white (non-Hispanics). The Hispanic and Latino population showed a significant growth in six years with 29% increase in population. Native American group grew by 50%, however, overall the makeup is only 0.3% of the population. Along with the aging population comes increased health care costs. Chronic disease studies show that the health of the aging population can be maintained, and chronic disease reduced by promoting healthy behaviors and expanding preventive health services. The average income is $50,006 in St. Clair county. Although it went up it remains the lowest of the four counties in the service area. St. Clair county also suffers from a high rate of poverty with 18.23% living at 100% below the federal poverty line and 35% living at 200% below the federal poverty line. This is a 1% increase from the last CHNA. This indicator is relevant because poverty creates barriers to access health services, nutritional food and other necessities that contribute to poor health status. Of the four counties included in the St. Elizabeth's service area, all have a lower uninsured rate than the state. However, St. Clair County has a higher rate of uninsured children, a lower percentage of privately insured residents and a higher rate of publicly insured residents when compared to the state rate. In St. Clair county 9.2% of the population is uninsured. Of those who are insured 36.8% are publicly insured which is higher than the state average of 31%. Violent crime is defined as offenses involving face to-face confrontation (e.g. assault, rape, robbery) The crime rate in the St. Elizabeth's service area is significantly higher and almost doubling the state rate:749 to 397 per 100,000. Crime impacts health because it limits interaction with others, prevents children from playing outdoors, lacks community organization and creates chronic stress, thus having a negative impact on health and health outcomes. Four hospitals serve the local community; one hospital in Belleville, the county seat for St. Clair County, has a satellite hospital in the community where St. Elizabeth's resides. In 2017 St. Elizabeth's built and moved into its replacement hospital in O'Fallon to meet and address the needs of the larger community and provide a higher level of care with the support of advanced technology. The aging facility in Belleville could no longer meet the needs of the area. A Federally Qualified Health Care Facility also serves Southern Illinois and has a hospital with mental health services in the East St. Louis area."
202131339349302383,370663567,"Schedule H, Part VI, Line 5 Promotion of community health","As a healing ministry of the Catholic Church and an affiliate of Hospital Sisters Health System (HSHS), HSHS St. Elizabeth's Hospital is committed to delivering high quality, compassionate, and cost-effective health care services to all. Founded in 1875 the hospital brings a healing presence and improves the health of our community, especially those persons who are sick, poor, and disadvantaged. Because of the hospital's mission and heritage, the hospital is dedicated to promoting the health of St. Clair County and surrounding areas. The hospital is governed by a Board of Directors, most of whom reside in the hospital's primary service area and who are neither employees nor independent contractors of the hospital (nor family members thereof). The Board ensures that HSHS St. Elizabeth's is responding to community need. Monthly they are updated on the events that happen in the community and are kept abreast of the collective impact process happening throughout the county called Healthier Together. Consistent with its exempt purpose, HSHS St. Elizabeth's has an open medical staff with privileges available to all qualified physicians in the area. The hospital also operates an emergency department that is open 24 hours to all persons regardless of their ability to pay. As a not-for-profit hospital, HSHS St. Elizabeth's reinvests surplus funds to support the mission of the organization and promote the health of the community rather than distributing surplus funds as profits to shareholders or individuals. Funds not committed to ongoing operations are generally used to upgrade facilities, secure new technologies, improve patient care, and support initiatives designed to promote health and ensure access for all. HSHS St. Elizabeth's is a strong supporter of education and provides mentoring to individuals in the clinical disciplines as well those outside of the clinical setting. In conjunction with St. Louis University, Southern Illinois Health Foundation (FQHC), and Scott Air Force Base, the hospital supports a three-year Family Practice Residency. Other disciplines that receive on site education and mentoring include nursing, pharmacy, pharmacy informatics, respiratory, radiology, occupational, physical, and speech therapies, and phlebotomy. Nonclinical education includes administrative secretary, medical records, and Master of Health Administration. HSHS St. Elizabeth's, HSHS Medical Group, Prairie Cardiovascular Consultants, and both the St. Clair and Madison County Medical Societies offer a ""Call M.E. Doctor"" Medical Explorers program for high school seniors who are interested in the medical profession. The overall goal of the program is to address the doctor crisis in the United States. The program consisted of three Saturday sessions for the students and featured hands-on activities and presentations from physicians in different clinical areas such as emergency medicine, cardiology, and orthopedic surgery. This event occurs twice a year with a variety of local high school students. HSHS St. Elizabeth's is a community leader for emergency management. The EMS coordinator is on the Advisory Council for two counties and is a certified National Incident Management System (NIMS) and Incident Command Structure (ICS) instructor. He trains St. Elizabeth's colleagues and provides NIMS training to the community. It is his involvement in the Local Emergency Planning Committees (LEPC) that integrates and prepares St. Elizabeth's to respond effectively in a disaster. For example, St. Elizabeth's participated in an active shooter exercise with many community partners in an industrial area. St. Elizabeth's colleagues served as evaluator and as a controller. The exercise focused on pre-hospital care of victims, and the responders were evaluated against FEMA standards and care. HSHS St. Elizabeth's gained knowledge and expertise with these exercises and developed relationships with other agencies. To ensure the community receives cardiac standard of care, HSHS St. Elizabeth's educates community physicians, Scott Air Force Base medical personnel, and community members on a variety of American Heart association classes such as Hands-Only CPR, Advanced Cardiac Life Support (ACLS), Pediatric Advanced Life Support (PALS), and Neonatal resuscitation (NRP) courses. HSHS St. Elizabeth's continues to provide a meal and a health care topic for seniors on fixed incomes every month. Seniors value the meal and the information. It creates social interaction among the group and reduces isolation. HSHS St. Elizabeth's routinely makes cash and in-kind donations to various social and educational agencies. For example, conference room space is donated to a variety of organizations that are aligned with our mission and principles. An example of such space includes providing meeting space for support groups such as Naranon, blood drives, and housing the county morgue. HSHS St. Elizabeth's donates printing services and office supplies for two small local non-profit organizations. HSHS St. Elizabeth's continues to provide space for the Pregnancy Care Center that offers free services to mothers and babies. The hospital provides flu vaccines to members in the community who are homeless or who are served by the soup kitchen. Hearing screens are offered to children in underserved areas. HSHS St. Elizabeth's provides the medical oversight for local emergency services. HSHS St. Elizabeth's also devotes significant resources to access for patients who cannot afford care, along with other Community Benefits. In FY 2020, HSHS St. Elizabeth's provided more than $17.3 million in Community Benefits, including financial assistance at cost, unpaid cost of Medicaid and other public programs, and a range of diverse programs designed to enhance access and improve community health. Additionally, in FY 2020 HSHS St Elizabeth's provided $92,834 in in-kind time to assist with the public health response to the COVID-19 Pandemic. HSHS St. Elizabeth's Hospital provides a range of Community Benefit initiatives and programs that further our mission and long-standing commitment to our community. In many cases, these Community Benefits would not exist without the leadership role played by HSHS St. Elizabeth's and they often relieve a burden that would otherwise be carried by government."
202131339349302383,370663567,"Schedule H, Part VI, Line 6 Affiliated health care system","Headquartered in Springfield, Illinois, Hospital Sisters Health System (HSHS) is a highly integrated, multi-institutional health care system comprised of 15 hospitals and more than 200 physician practice sites in Illinois and Wisconsin. HSHS is sponsored by Hospital Sisters Ministries (HSM), which is a public juridic person of the Roman Catholic Church. HSHS continues the health care ministries begun by its founders, the Hospital Sisters of St. Francis, more than 140 years ago, in rural and midsized communities throughout Illinois and Wisconsin. HSHS provides compassionate, holistic, high quality, and cost-effective health care through its acute care hospitals, physician practices, home health programs, palliative and hospice programs, and community outreach services. In addition, HSHS affiliated hospitals include critical access facilities that offer essential health services that otherwise would not be available in many communities. Our mission calls us to reveal and embody Christ's healing love for all people, and we extend our high quality Franciscan health care ministry beyond the walls of our hospitals by providing community health improvement services with special emphasis on the poor and vulnerable. In addition to providing community health improvement services to the broader community, HSHS cares for everyone who comes to its facilities, regardless of their ability to pay. In tandem with a variety of cross sector community partners, HSHS's Community Benefit initiatives are strategically planned and professionally implemented to improve access to health care services; enhance the health of the community; advance medical or general health care knowledge; and relieve or reduce the burden of government to improve health. The COVID-19 pandemic caused an unprecedented disruption in healthcare services across the United States. HSHS responded with services that benefited our communities, including free telehealth screenings, free testing, and coordination with other healthcare providers in the communities we serve to best ensure access to needed care. In FY2020, HSHS collectively provided $244.0 million in Community Benefit (10.0% of total hospital expenses) including more than $1 million in response to the pandemic. Of the total Community Benefit provided, HSHS spent $26.9 million provided for Financial Assistance (aka Charity Care) and $173.3 million for unreimbursed care provided as part of the Medicaid program. In addition, HSHS hospitals committed significant resources to treat Medicare patients. The cost of providing services to primarily elderly beneficiaries of the Medicare program - in excess of governmental and managed care contract payments - was $183.9 million. HSHS hospitals also recorded $26.4 million in uncollectible accounts. While HSHS does not count the latter two amounts as Community Benefit, they nonetheless reflect our commitment to serving all persons in need of care. In addition to the dollars invested in our Community Benefit programs, HSHS continues to reinvest any surplus revenue from operations and investments into new medical technology, facility infrastructure and health care services in our communities. By doing so, we ensure our ability to meet the ongoing demand for high quality, efficient and easily accessible health care."

Maryland's State Health Improvement Process (SHIP) provides a framework for continual progress toward a healthier Maryland. Maryland's State Heath Improvement Process (SHIP) began with national, state and local data being reviewed and analyzed by the Maryland Department of Health and Office of Population Health as well as by the five Departments of Health (Talbot, Caroline, Dorchester, Queen Anne's, Kent). It has three main components: accountability, local action and public engagement. SHIP includes 39 measures that provide a framework to improve the health of Maryland residents. Twenty-eight of the measures have been identified as critical racial/ethnic health disparities. Each measure has a data source and a target, and where possible, can be assessed at the county level. UM SRH's priorities are aligned with the Maryland State Health Improvement Process vision areas and those objectives outlined by the local health improvement coalition. Health Priorities FY2020-2022 The top five priorities: 1. Access to care 2. Preventable ER visits 3. Chronic Disease management 4. Mental health/substance abuse 5. Cancer Several additional topic areas were identified by UM SRH: safe housing, transportation, and substance abuse. The unmet needs not addressed by UM SRH will continue to be addressed by key governmental agencies and existing community- based organizations. While UM SRH will focus the majority of our efforts on the identified priorities outlined in the CHNA Implementation Plan, we will review the complete set of needs identified in the CHNA for future collaboration and work. These areas, while still important to the health of the community, will be met through other health care organizations with our assistance as available. Initiative 1 Identified Need: Health Priority #1. Access to Care; Health Priority #5. Cancer How was the need identified: Identified through the CHNA process Name of hospital initiative: Shore Regional Wellness for Women Outreach and Wellness for Women Screening Describe the characteristics of the target population: Female population of five county area Outreach= age 25+ (approximately 32,000) Screenings= age 40-65, uninsured/eligible = 2,800 Age-adjusted mortality rate from cancer (per 100,000 population) in Maryland is higher than the US cancer mortality rate. Cancer impacts people across all population groups, however wide racial disparities exist. Maryland 2017 Goal 147.4 Maryland rate: 159.3 Caroline County: 173.5 Dorchester County: 195.2 Kent County: 149.7 Queen Anne's County: 160.4 Talbot County: 143 Total number of people reached by the initiative: Wellness for Women Outreach: 1,300 lives touched Screenings: 88 patients seen. Primary objective of initiative: Reduce overall cancer death rate Age-adjusted mortality rate from cancer (per 100,000 population). Maryland is higher than the US cancer mortality rate. Cancer impacts people across all population groups, however wide racial disparities exist. Maryland 2017 Goal 147.4 Maryland rate: 159.3 Caroline County: 173.5 Dorchester County: 195.2 Kent County: 149.7 Queen Anne's County: 160.4 Talbot County: 143.8 Wellness for Women Outreach: 1. Increase the number of women surviving breast cancer by diagnosing them at an earlier stage through education and promotion of preventative measures and early detection. 2. Diagnose African American and Hispanic women at earlier stages of breast cancer, equivalent to Caucasian women. 3. Educate Latina women in breast self- examination with the assistance of a translator. Screenings: 1. The program serves as a point of access into care for age and risk specific mammography screening, clinical breast exam, and genetic testing for breast cancer. 2. Offers no cost mammograms to eligible women: those under the age of 40 and over 65 who have no insurance and Latina women of all ages who will be screened annually thereafter. Those women needing further diagnostic tests or who need treatment for breast cancer are enrolled in the State of Maryland Diagnosis and Treatment Program through the case manager Key collaborators in delivery: Participating Hospital Staff; Talbot, QA, Kent, Dorchester, Caroline Counties Health Departments for five Counties Impact of hospital initiative: Reduce cancer mortality Evaluation of outcomes: The stage at diagnosis as reported by the Tumor Registry for the Cancer Center indicates disparity for women in Caroline and Dorchester County. The outreach program increased the community's awareness of breast cancer prevention, detection and treatments. Outcome: Reduced overall cancer death rate. The outreach program increased the community's awareness of breast cancer prevention, detection and treatments.

Access to Care How was the need identified: Identified through the CHNA process Name of hospital initiative: Community Care Coordination- Transitional Nurse Navigators Target population Population includes those with CHF, COPD, diabetes and other chronic diseases as well as those with complex medical needs and/or lacking social support. Total number of people reached by the initiative: Served 1,154 patients- improved access to outpatient services through follow-up and referral to community resources. Primary objective of initiative: Access to care and care coordination were identified in the 2019 CHNA. This program addresses these needs through navigators who refer patients at discharge from the in-patient setting to community based programs who can address health needs and social determinants of health. Patients are followed through an out-patient care coordination process to address medical and non-medical needs. UM SRH implemented a follow up system for all discharged patients and has expanded services to the community to determine if additional health services are required to address medical and non-medical needs (e.g., appointment setting, obtaining medications, understanding care instructions. UM SRH also pays for medical transportation and some medications for patients with medical and financial needs Key collaborators in delivery: * Queen Anne's County Department of Health * Department of Aging Upper Shore Impact of hospital initiative: Reduction of utilization of emergency room services for ongoing treatment.

UM SRH operates under a unique regulatory system that caps hospital revenues and provides adjustments to allow for population health improvement investments. Under Maryland's global budget revenue model, UM SRH reports on a regular basis how it is investing in efforts to improve population health. UM SRH provides on-going services that are fundamental to addressing the identified community health needs that demonstrate the extent to which our commitment to serve our community is integrated into our care delivery model. We have a strong focus on treating patients with chronic conditions. UM Shore Regional Health works to coordinate care, ensure smooth transitions and promote disease self-management strategies at every step of a patient's journey - whether at home, in the community, or within our hospital. We operate specialized clinics to enable access to routine outpatient care. Our transitional care services help patients newly diagnosed or those that have had a recent hospitalization transition safely back to the community. Transitional nurse navigators provide patients with disease education and self-management strategies, connect them to primary care providers and specialists, and help them overcome any barriers to making follow up appointments. An urgent care center to address off hours visits and low acuity emergencies is also available. Our coudamin clinic provides anticoagulation medication management, specifically managing and monitoring warfarin (Coumadin) therapy upon physician referral. It also provides patients with ongoing monitoring of their anticoagulation therapy to ensure desired outcomes and decrease adverse events. Additionally, our behavioral health clinic provides a community access point for those in need of outpatient mental health services. Resources are embedded throughout the hospital and in the community so that every patient receives the same level of care coordination. Care managers are embedded within our emergency department and hospital, and provide in-home visits as needed. Community health workers reach out to patients who are identified as being high risk for readmission or in need of critical resources. Close relationships are maintained with skilled nursing facilities and home health agencies so that transfers from the hospital to these facilities are smooth, and the highest quality of care is constantly delivered. Strong relationships exist with local emergency medical service (EMS) providers through our mobile integrated health program, which delivers effective and efficient care to patients outside of the hospital. Nurses and community health workers function outside traditional emergency response roles, with a focus on maintaining individuals' health at their homes while also providing convenient access to care in the community. Additional care partners include primary care providers, specialists, local department of health, office on aging and other community based partners. We are proud to serve our community and appreciate our partners who allow us to fulfill our mission. We will always do what is right for the patient, no matter where they are in their health journey, and will always strive to have our patients receive care in the community they reside. As a part of the University of Maryland Medical System (UMMS) we are shaping a new paradigm in care delivery that we believe should be the future standard of care."

The Health Services Cost Review Commission, (HSCRC) determines payment through a rate setting process and all payors, including governmental payors, pay the same amount for the same services delivered at the same hospital. Maryland's unique all payor system includes a method for referencing Uncompensated Care in each payors' rates, which does not enable Maryland hospitals to breakout any offsetting revenue related to Uncompensated Care. Community benefit expenses are equal to Medicaid revenues in Maryland, as such, the net effect is zero. Additionally, net revenues for Medicaid should reflect the full impact on the hospital of its share of the Medicaid assessment."
202101349349300930,520610538,"Schedule H, Part II Community Building Activities","Through a variety of community building activities, UM Shore Regional Health promotes health and wellness in the community it serves. These activities include: active engagement and collaboration with local Health Departments, Chambers of Commerce, and organizations that work to improve the quality of life for the residents of the Mid-Shore (Talbot, Caroline, Dorchester, Queen Anne's, and Kent Counties) Because local action is essential to public health progress, UM Shore Regional Health works in partnership with public sector agencies, health care providers and community-based partners. In addition, a variety of clinical and non-clinical UM SRH associates serve on various coalition workgroups. The work of UM SRH and community-based partners continues on the identified priorities and objectives of the Maryland Department of Health (MDH) State Health Improvement Process (SHIP). SHIP, launched in September 2011, focuses on improving the health of Maryland residents in six vision areas: Healthy Babies, Healthy Social Environments, Safe Physical Environments, Infectious Disease, Chronic Disease and Health Care Access. Under SHIP's umbrella, the coalition develops and implements strategies that will improve local public health. UM SRH maintains open communication with the Health Departments of Talbot, Caroline, Dorchester, Queen Anne's, and Kent Counties, Mid-Shore Mental Health System, Choptank Community Health System, local government and schools. UM SRH's community outreach programs can be found in County schools, senior centers, community centers and churches throughout the Mid-Shore. UM SRH's director of community outreach participates in committees and advisory councils, promoting continuous dialogue between the medical center and community stakeholders. This provides opportunities for new ideas and programs to be exchanged, allowing UM SRH to maximize community outreach efforts. UM SRH seeks insight from community members attending educational programs through its outreach events. Program participants are asked to complete a brief survey evaluation, providing feedback and comments about the program they attended, as well as providing suggestions for future program topics."

Focus on health outreach and education Maryland Health Care Commission (MHCC) Rural Health Study During the 2016 Legislative Session, Senate Bill 707 Freestanding Medical Facilities- Certificate of Need, Rates and Definition (SB 707), passed into law and was signed by the Governor on May 10, 2016. The legislation established a workgroup on rural health care delivery to oversee a study of healthcare delivery in the Middle Shore region and to develop a plan for meeting the health care needs of the five counties -- Caroline, Dorchester, Kent, Queen Anne's and Talbot. The purpose of the study was to assess the health care of the residents of the five-county study area and the capacities of the health system in the region, and propose options for enhancing health and health care delivery on the Mid-Shore. The research team was asked to consider: (1) the limited availability of health care providers and services; (2) the special needs of vulnerable populations, including the frail and elderly, racial and ethnic minorities, immigrants and patients with persistent behavioral illnesses; (3) barriers to access caused by transportation limitations; and (4) the economic impact of closures, partial closures or conversions of health care facilities. The Summary Report provides highlights of findings from all components of the study and integrates them into key recommendations. Methods and findings are detailed for review at: http://mhcc.maryland.gov/mhcc/pages/home/workgroups/documents/rural_health/September%2025th%202017%20Meeting/lgsrpt_%20ExecutiveSummary_rpt_20170928.pdf The University of Maryland Medical System in partnership with UM Shore Regional Health as members of the Rural Health Care Delivery Workgroup produced a white paper, Commitment to Meeting the Health Care Needs of Our Vulnerable Rural Communities.

All patients presenting as self pay and requesting charity relief from their bill will be screened at all points of entry, for possible coverage through state programs and a probable determination for coverage for either Medical Assistance or Financial Assistance (charity care) from the hospital is immediately given to the patient. The process is resource intensive and time consuming for patients and the hospital; however, if patients qualify for one of these programs, then they will have health benefits that they will carry with them beyond their current hospital bills, and allow them to access preventive care services as well. UM Shore Regional Health works with a business partner who will work with our patients to assist them with the state assistance programs, which is free to our patients. If a patient does not qualify for Medicaid or another program, UM Shore Regional Health offers our financial assistance program. UM Shore Regional Health posts notices of our policy in conspicuous places throughout the hospitals- including the emergency department, has information within our hospital billing brochure, educates all new employees thoroughly on the process during orientation, and does a yearly re- education to all existing staff. All staff have copies of the financial assistance application, both in English and Spanish, to supply to patients who, after screening, have a need for assistance. UM Shore Regional Health has a dedicated Financial Assistance Liaison to work with our patients to assist them with this process and expedite the decision process. Shore Health notifies patients of the availability of financial assistance funds prior to service during our calls to patients, through signage at all of our registration locations, through our patient billing brochure and through our discussions with patients during registration. In addition, the patient information sheet is mailed to patients with all statements and/or handed to them if needed. * Shore Health prepares its Financial Assistance Policy (FAP) in a culturally sensitive manner, at a reading comprehension level appropriate to the CBSA's population, and in Spanish. * Shore Health posts its FAP and financial assistance contact information in admissions areas, emergency rooms, and other areas of our facilities in which eligible patients are likely to present; * Shore Health provides a copy of the FAP and financial assistance contact information to patients or their families as part of the intake process; * Shore Health provides a copy of the FAP and financial assistance contact information to patients with discharge materials. * A copy of Shore Health's FAP along with financial assistance contact information, is provided in patient bills; and/or * Shore Health discusses with patients or their families the availability of various government benefits, such as Medicaid or state programs, and assists patients with qualification for such programs, where applicable. * An abbreviated statement advising of Shore Health's financial assistance policy, including a phone number to call for more information, is run annually in the local newspaper (Star Democrat)"
202101349349300930,520610538,"Schedule H, Part VI, Line 4 Community information","Situated on Maryland's Eastern Shore, Shore Regional Health's three hospitals, University of Maryland Medical Center at Easton (UMC at Easton), University of Maryland Medical Center at Dorchester (UMC at Dorchester), University of Maryland Medical Center at Chestertown (UMC at Chestertown) are not- for-profit hospitals offering a complete range of inpatient and outpatient services to over 170,000 people throughout the Mid-Shore of Maryland. Shore Regional Health's service area is defined as the Maryland counties of Caroline, Dorchester, Talbot, Queen Anne's and Kent. UMC at Easton is situated at the center of the mid-shore area and thus serves a large rural geographical area (all five counties of the mid-shore). UMC at Dorchester is located approximately 18 miles from Easton and primarily serves Dorchester County and portions of Caroline County. UMC at Chestertown located in Chestertown, in Kent County merged with Shore Regional Health in July 2013. UMC at Chestertown serves the residents of Kent County, portions of Queen Anne's and Caroline Counties and the surrounding areas. The five counties of the Mid-Shore comprise 20% of the landmass of the State of Maryland and 2% of the population. The entire region has over 4,400 employers with nearly 45,000 workers. Only 50 of those employers employ 100 or more workers. The economic condition varies significantly throughout the region, especially for Caroline, Dorchester, and Kent Counties. It should be noted that Talbot County appears to have a significantly higher median income than Caroline and Dorchester; however, a large percentage of the population has incomes in line with those of Caroline and Dorchester. The figures for Talbot are somewhat skewed due to large incomes of a few individual families and high net worth individuals. Shore Regional Health's service area has a higher percentage of population aged 65 and older as compared to Maryland overall. Talbot County has a 27.2% rate for this age group and Kent County has 25.3% of its residents age 65 years or older. These rates are 65% higher than Maryland's average percentages, and higher than other rural areas in the state by almost a quarter. Today, more than two-thirds of all health care costs are for treating chronic illnesses. Among health care costs for older Americans, 95% are for chronic diseases. The cost of providing health care for one person aged 65 or older is three to five times higher than the cost for someone younger than 65. While progress is being made, the Mid-Shore economy still faces myriad of challenges that include limited access to affordable high speed broadband services, a shortage of affordable housing, an inadequate supply of skilled workers, low per capita income, and more layoffs in the manufacturing sector. County Health Rankings for the Mid-Shore counties also reveal the large disparities between counties for health outcomes in the service area. Overall, Queen Anne's County ranks 9th; Talbot County ranks 5th; Dorchester ranks 23rd, Caroline ranks 19th, Kent ranks 16th (out of 24 counties including Baltimore City) in health outcomes that indicate the overall health of the county.

Services include medical and senior citizen demand services and fixed route county and regional service. While most of the region is served by the fixed routes, there are gaps in coverage in the less populated areas of the counties. The regional system, Maryland Upper Shore Transit (MUST), provides low cost service for the general public from Kent Island to Ocean City with convenient free transfer points at key locations on the shore. MUST is a coordinated effort of several Upper Shore agencies and governments to provide a regional transit system for Kent, Queen Anne's, Talbot, Caroline, and Dorchester Counties. Transit services are provided by Queen Anne's County Ride (operated by the county) and Delmarva Community Transit (DCT), a private company under contract to the counties. The system also includes Shore Transit, which provides scheduled routes on the lower shore. The MTA and the Maryland Department of Human Resources have provided funding. Overall management of the regional system is the responsibility of the Transportation Advisory Group (TAG). The County Commissioners of the five Upper Shore counties appoint the members of the TAG.

202101369349302410,231352187,"SCHEDULE H, PART III, LINE 8","PART III, LINE 3-BAD DEBT: MEDICARE COSTS WERE DERIVED FROM THE MEDICARE COST REPORT AND THE COST ACCOUNTING SYSTEM. THE ORGANIZATION BELIEVES THAT MEDICARE UNDERPAYMENTS (SHORTFALL) AND THE COST OF BAD DEBT ARE COMMUNITY BENEFIT AND SHOULD BE INCLUDED ON FORM 990, SCHEDULE H, PART I. AS OUTLINED MORE FULLY BELOW, THE ORGANIZATION BELIEVES THAT THESE SERVICES AND RELATED COSTS PROMOTE THE HEALTH OF THE COMMUNITY AS A WHOLE AND ARE RENDERED IN CONJUNCTION WITH THE ORGANIZATION'S CHARITABLE TAX-EXEMPT PURPOSES AND MISSION IN PROVIDING MEDICALLY NECESSARY HEALTHCARE SERVICES TO ALL INDIVIDUALS IN A NON- DISCRIMINATORY MANNER WITHOUT REGARD TO RACE, COLOR, CREED, SEX, NATIONAL ORIGIN, RELIGION OR ABILITY TO PAY AND IS CONSISTENT WITH THE COMMUNITY BENEFIT STANDARD PROMULGATED BY THE IRS. THE COMMUNITY BENEFIT STANDARD IS THE CURRENT STANDARD FOR A TAX-EXEMPT AND CHARITABLE ORGANIZATION UNDER THE INTERNAL REVENUE CODE (""IRC"") 501(C)(3). SATISFYING THE ""COMMUNITY BENEFIT STANDARD,"" AS ARTICULATED BY THE INTERNAL REVENUE SERVICE (IRS) IN REVENUE RULING 69-545, IS CURRENTLY REQUIRED FOR A HOSPITAL TO BE RECOGNIZED AS A CHARITABLE ORGANIZATION UNDER INTERNAL REVENUE CODE (IRC) 501(C)(3). THIS RULING REMOVED THE PREVIOUS REQUIREMENT OF REVENUE RULING 56-185, KNOWN AS THE ""CHARITY CARE STANDARD,"" THAT IN ORDER TO BE A CHARITABLE ORGANIZATION, A HOSPITAL HAD TO PROVIDE, TO THE EXTENT OF ITS FINANCIAL ABILITY, FREE OR REDUCED-COST CARE TO PATIENTS UNABLE TO PAY FOR THEIR CARE. THIS EARLIER RULING EMPHASIZED THAT A LOW LEVEL OF CHARITY CARE DID NOT MEAN THAT A HOSPITAL WAS CHARITABLE SINCE THAT LEVEL COULD REFLECT THE HOSPITAL'S FINANCIAL ABILITY TO PROVIDE SUCH CARE. REVENUE RULING 56-185 ALSO NOTED THAT PUBLICLY SUPPORTED COMMUNITY HOSPITALS WOULD NORMALLY QUALIFY AS CHARITABLE BECAUSE THEY SERVE THE ENTIRE COMMUNITY AND A LOW LEVEL OF CHARITY CARE WOULD NOT IMPACT A HOSPITAL'S CHARITABLE STATUS IF IT WAS DUE TO THE SURROUNDING COMMUNITY'S LACK OF CHARITABLE DEMANDS. AS DEVELOPED IN REVENUE RULING 69-545, UNDER THE COMMUNITY BENEFIT STANDARD, HOSPITALS WERE JUDGED ON WHETHER THEY PROMOTE THE HEALTH OF A BROAD CLASS OF INDIVIDUALS IN THE COMMUNITY. THIS RULING INVOLVED A HOSPITAL THAT ONLY ADMITTED THOSE WHO COULD PAY FOR THE SERVICES EITHER BY THEMSELVES, THROUGH PRIVATE INSURANCE OR PUBLIC PROGRAMS SUCH AS MEDICARE. IN ADDITION, THE HOSPITAL OPERATED A FULL-TIME EMERGENCY ROOM THAT WAS OPEN TO EVERYONE. THE IRS RULED THAT THE HOSPITAL WAS CHARITABLE BECAUSE IT PROMOTED THE HEALTH OF PEOPLE IN ITS COMMUNITY. THE IRS REASONED THAT BECAUSE THE PROMOTION OF HEALTH WAS A CHARITABLE PURPOSE ACCORDING TO THE GENERAL LAW OF CHARITY, IT FELL WITHIN THE ""GENERALLY ACCEPTED LEGAL SENSE"" OF THE TERM CHARITABLE, AS REQUIRED BY TREASURY REGULATION SECTION 1.501 (C)(3)-1(D)(2). THE IRS RULED THAT THE PROMOTION OF HEALTH, LIKE RELIEF OF POVERTY AND THE ADVANCEMENT OF EDUCATION AND RELIGION, IS ONE OF THE PURPOSES OF THE GENERAL LAW OF CHARITY THAT IS DEEMED BENEFICIAL TO THE COMMUNITY AS A WHOLE EVEN THOUGH THE CLASS OF BENEFICIARIES ELIGIBLE TO RECEIVE A DIRECT BENEFIT FROM ITS ACTIVITIES DOES NOT INCLUDE ALL MEMBERS OF THE COMMUNITY, SUCH AS INDIGENT MEMBERS OF THE COMMUNITY, PROVIDED THAT THE CLASS IS NOT SO SMALL THAT ITS RELIEF IS NOT OF BENEFIT TO THE COMMUNITY. THE IRS CONCLUDED THAT THE HOSPITAL WAS ""PROMOTING THE HEALTH OF A CLASS OF PERSONS THAT IS BROAD ENOUGH TO BENEFIT THE COMMUNITY"" BECAUSE ITS EMERGENCY ROOM WAS OPEN TO ALL AND IT PROVIDED CARE TO THOSE WHO COULD PAY, WHETHER DIRECTLY OR THROUGH THIRD-PARTY REIMBURSEMENT. OTHER FACTORS THAT DEMONSTRATED COMMUNITY BENEFIT INCLUDED: SURPLUS FUNDS WERE USED TO IMPROVE PATIENT CARE, EXPAND FACILITIES AND ADVANCE MEDICAL TRAINING, EDUCATION AND RESEARCH; AND IT WAS CONTROLLED BY A BOARD OF DIRECTORS THAT CONSISTED OF INDEPENDENT CIVIC LEADERS. THE AMERICAN HOSPITAL ASSOCIATION (""AHA"") BELIEVES THAT MEDICARE UNDERPAYMENTS (SHORTFALLS) AND BAD DEBT SHOULD BE REPORTED AS COMMUNITY BENEFIT ON FORM 990, SCHEDULE H, PART I, LINE 7. THIS ORGANIZATION AGREES WITH THE AHA'S LETTER TO THE IRS DATED AUGUST 21, 2007 RESPONDING TO A DRAFT OF THE NEW FORM 990 AND SCHEDULE H, THE AHA ARGUED THAT MEDICARE UNDERPAYMENTS (SHORTFALLS) IS COMMUNITY BENEFIT FOR THE FOLLOWING REASONS: -PROVIDING CARE FOR THE ELDERLY AND SERVING MEDICARE PATIENTS REMAINS AN ESSENTIAL PART OF THE COMMUNITY BENEFIT STANDARD. -MEDICARE, LIKE MEDICAID, DOES NOT PAY THE FULL COST OF CARE. RECENTLY, MEDICARE REIMBURSES ONLY 92 CENTS FOR EVERY DOLLAR HOSPITALS SPEND TO CARE FOR MEDICARE PATIENTS. THE MEDICARE PAYMENT ADVISORY COMMISSION (""MEDPAC"") IN ITS MARCH 2007 REPORT TO CONGRESS CAUTIONED THAT UNDERPAYMENT WILL GET EVEN WORSE, WITH MARGINS REACHING A 10 YEAR LOW AT NEGATIVE 5.4 PERCENT. -MANY MEDICARE PATIENTS, LIKE THEIR MEDICAID COUNTERPARTS, ARE POOR. MORE THAN 46% OF MEDICARE SPENDING IS FOR BENEFICIARIES WHOSE INCOME IS BELOW 200% OF THE FEDERAL POVERTY LEVEL. MANY ARE ALSO ELIGIBLE FOR MEDICAID, SO CALLED -DUAL ELIGIBLES"". PENNSYLVANIA REQUIRES NON-PROFIT HOSPITALS TO PROVIDE A MINIMUM LEVEL OF COMMUNITY BENEFIT TO RETAIN EXEMPTION FROM STATE AND LOCAL TAXES. ACCORDING TO STATE GUIDANCE AND CASE LAW, THE UNREIMBURSED COST OF MEDICARE AND BAD DEBT IS CONSIDERED TO BE COMMUNITY BENEFIT FOR STATE TAX EXEMPTION PURPOSES. PART III, LINE 6 ONLY INCLUDES THOSE COSTS THAT ARE PERMITTED TO BE REPORTED IN THE HOSPITAL'S MEDICARE COST REPORT THAT IS REQUIRED TO BE FILED WITH THE FEDERAL GOVERNMENT. THE HOSPITAL CONSIDERS THE TOTAL MEDICARE UNDERPAYMENTS (SHORTFALL) OF 11,642,231 SHOULD BE REPORTED AS COMMUNITY BENEFIT ON THE FORM 990, SCHEDULE H, PART I, LINE 7. ALONG WITH PROVIDING CARE TO MEDICAID PATIENTS AND PROVIDING FREE OR DISCOUNTED CARE TO OTHER LOW-INCOME PATIENTS, THE IRS COMMUNITY BENEFIT STANDARD INCLUDES THE PROVISION OF CARE TO THE ELDERLY AND MEDICARE PATIENTS. LIKE MEDICAID, MEDICARE DOES NOT PAY THE FULL COST OF PROVIDING CARE TO THESE PATIENTS, FORCING THE HOSPITAL TO USE OTHER FUNDS TO COVER THE SHORTFALL. MEDICARE SHORTFALLS MUST BE ABSORBED BY THE HOSPITAL IN ORDER TO CONTINUE TREATING THE ELDERLY IN OUR COMMUNITIES. THE HOSPITAL PROVIDES CARE REGARDLESS OF THE MEDICARE SHORTFALL AND IS THEREBY PROVIDING ACCESS TO MEDICAL SERVICES FOR THE ELDERLY AND RELIEVING THE FEDERAL GOVERNMENT OF THE BURDEN OF PAYING THE FULL COST FOR PROVIDING CARE TO MEDICARE PATIENTS. ABSENT THE MEDICARE PROGRAM, IT IS LIKELY THAT MANY MEDICARE PATIENTS WOULD BE ELIGIBLE FOR CHARITY CARE OR OTHER NEED-BASED GOVERNMENT PROGRAMS. THE AMOUNT EXPENDED TO COVER THE SHORTFALL IS MONEY NOT AVAILABLE FOR FINANCIAL ASSISTANCE AND OTHER COMMUNITY BENEFIT NEEDS. BOTH THE HOSPITAL AND THE AHA BELIEVE THAT PATIENT BAD DEBT BE REPORTED AS A COMMUNITY BENEFIT ON FORM 990, SCHEDULE H, PART I, LINE 7. LIKE MEDICARE UNDERPAYMENTS (SHORTFALLS), BAD DEBT SHOULD BE REPORTED AS COMMUNITY BENEFIT BECAUSE: -A SIGNIFICANT PORTION OF BAD DEBT IS ATTRIBUTABLE TO LOW-INCOME PATIENTS, WHO FOR MANY REASONS DECLINE TO COMPLETE THE FORMS REQUIRED TO ESTABLISH ELIGIBILITY UNDER THE HOSPITAL'S CHARITY CARE OR FINANCIAL ASSISTANCE POLICY (FAP). A 2006 CONGRESSIONAL BUDGET OFFICE (""CBO""), ""NONPROFIT HOSPITALS AND THE PROVISION OF COMMUNITY BENEFIT"", CITED TWO STUDIES INDICATING THAT ""THE GREAT MAJORITY OF BAD DEBT WAS ATTRIBUTABLE TO PATIENTS WITH INCOMES BELOW 200% OF THE FEDERAL POVERTY LINE."" -THE CBO REPORT ALSO NOTED THAT A SUBSTANTIAL PORTION OF THE BAD DEBT IS PENDING CHARITY CARE. UNLIKE BAD DEBT IN OTHER INDUSTRIES, HOSPITAL BAD DEBT IS COMPLICATED BY THE FACT THAT HOSPITALS FOLLOW THEIR CHARITABLE MISSION TO THE COMMUNITY AND TREAT EVERY PATIENT THAT COMES THROUGH THE EMERGENCY DEPARTMENT, REGARDLESS OF ABILITY TO PAY. PATIENTS WHO HAVE OUTSTANDING BILLS ARE NOT TURNED AWAY, UNLIKE OTHER INDUSTRIES. BAD DEBT IS FURTHER COMPLICATED BY THE AUDITING INDUSTRY'S STANDARDS ON REPORTING CHARITY CARE. MANY PATIENTS CANNOT OR DO NOT PROVIDE THE NECESSARY DOCUMENTATION REQUIRED TO BE DEEMED CHARITY CARE BY AUDITORS. AS A RESULT, ACCORDING TO THE CBO REPORT, ROUGHLY 40% OF BAD DEBT IS PENDING CHARITY CARE. (IN FY 2020, APPROXIMATELY 46% OF THE HOSPITAL'S BAD DEBT WAS SUBSEQUENTLY RECLASSIFIED TO CHARITY CARE.) THE CBO CONCLUDED THAT ITS FINDINGS ""SUPPORT THE VALIDITY OF THE USE OF UNCOMPENSATED CARE (BAD DEBT AND CHARITY CARE) AS A MEASURE OF COMMUNITY BENEFITS"" ASSUMING THE FINDINGS ARE GENERALIZED NATIONALLY. THE EXPERIENCE OF HOSPITALS NATIONWIDE REINFORCE THAT THEY ARE GENERALIZABLE. AS OUTLINED BY THE AHA, DESPITE THE HOSPITAL'S BEST EFFORTS AND DUE DILIGENCE, PATIENT BAD DEBT IS A PART OF THE CHARITABLE MISSION AND CHARITABLE PURPOSES. BAD DEBT REPRESENTS PART OF THE BURDEN HOSPITALS' BEAR IN SERVING ALL PATIENTS REGARDLESS OF RACE, COLOR, CREED, SEX, NATIONAL ORIGIN, RELIGION OR ABILITY TO PAY. IN ADDITION, THE HOSPITAL INVESTS SIGNIFICANT RESOURCES IN SYSTEMS AND STAFF TRAINING TO ASSIST PATIENTS THAT ARE IN NEED OF FINANCIAL ASSISTANCE. FOR FISCAL YEAR ENDED 6/30/2020, TH"

ZIP CODE 17044, LEWISTOWN, HAS THE HIGHEST CNI SCORE, INDICATING THE GREATEST COMMUNITY NEED. THE ZIP CODE HAS THE HIGHEST PERCENTAGE OF HOUSEHOLDS LIVING IN POVERTY AND THE HIGHEST UNEMPLOYMENT RATE. HOWEVER, RESIDENTS ARE MORE LIKELY TO HAVE ATTAINED HIGHER EDUCATION AND LESS LIKELY TO BE WITHOUT HEALTH INSURANCE WHEN COMPARED TO THE COUNTY OVERALL. ZIP CODES 17004, BELLEVILLE, AND 17084, REEDSVILLE, HAVE A LOWER PERCENTAGE OF ENGLISH ONLY SPEAKING RESIDENTS AND A LARGER UNINSURED POPULATION.

THE WHITE POPULATION AS A PERCENTAGE OF THE TOTAL POPULATION IS DECLINING IN ALL COUNTIES, WHILE BLACK/AFRICAN AMERICAN AND HISPANIC/LATINO POPULATIONS ARE GROWING. THE DEMOGRAPHIC SHIFT IS A STATEWIDE TREND. MINORITY POPULATIONS ARE THE ONLY GROWING DEMOGRAPHIC IN PENNSYLVANIA. THE HISPANIC/LATINO POPULATION IS ONE OF THE FASTEST GROWING DEMOGRAPHIC GROUPS. THE AMISH ARE ALSO A PROMINENT POPULATION GROUP WITHIN THE WESTERN REGION. APPROXIMATELY 8,200 AMISH INDIVIDUALS RESIDE IN SIX SETTLEMENTS ACROSS THE THREE COUNTIES.

RACIAL AND ETHNIC MINORITY GROUPS LIKE BLACK/AFRICAN AMERICAN OR HISPANIC/LATINO RESIDENTS ARE MORE LIKELY TO BE IMPACTED BY ADVERSE SOCIOECONOMIC FACTORS, INCLUDING POVERTY, UNEMPLOYMENT, OR EDUCATION ATTAINMENT. POVERTY IS ONE OF THE BIGGEST DRIVERS OF DISPARITY IN THE WESTERN REGION. POVERTY RATES AMONG MINORITY POPULATIONS EXCEED RATES AMONG WHITES IN NEARLY ALL COUNTIES. SOCIOECONOMIC DISPARITY CONTRIBUTES TO WORSE HEALTH OUTCOMES.

A PATIENT CAN APPLY FOR CHARITY OR FINANCIAL ASSISTANCE AT ANY TIME DURING THE COLLECTION CYCLE. ONCE QUALIFYING DOCUMENTATION IS RECEIVED THE PATIENT'S ACCOUNT IS ADJUSTED. PATIENT ACCOUNTS FOR THE QUALIFYING PATIENT IN THE PREVIOUS SIX MONTHS MAY ALSO BE CONSIDERED FOR CHARITY OR FINANCIAL ASSISTANCE. ONCE A PATIENT QUALIFIES FOR CHARITY OR FINANCIAL ASSISTANCE, ALL COLLECTION ACTIVITY IS SUSPENDED. COLLECTION POLICIES ARE THE SAME FOR ALL PRESENCE HEALTH HOSPITALS. PATIENTS ARE NOTIFIED OF THE FINANCIAL ASSISTANCE POLICY AT THE TIME OF REGISTRATION VIA POSTED NOTIFICATIONS AND ON EVERY ACCOUNT STATEMENT THAT IS SENT TO THEM. THIS INFORMATION IS AVAILABLE IN ALL LANGUAGES SPOKEN BY AT LEAST 1,000 HOUSEHOLDS OF LIMITED ENGLISH PROFICIENCY IN THE AREA SERVED BY THE HOSPITAL ENTITY, PER FINAL RULE 501(R) GIUDELINES. PATIENTS MAY APPLY FOR FINANCIAL ASSISTANCE AT ANY TIME DURING THE REVENUE CYCLE. PER THE PROVISION FOR FINANCIAL ASSISTANCE POLICY, THE COLLECTION PROCESS IS AS FOLLOWS: 1. PRE-LITIGATION REVIEW: PRIOR TO AN ACCOUNT BEING AUTHORIZED FOR THE FILING OF SUIT FOR NON-PAYMENT OF A PATIENT BILL, A FINAL REVIEW OF THE ACCOUNT WILL BE CONDUCTED AND APPROVED BY THE FINANCIAL COUNSELING REPRESENTATIVE (OR DESIGNEE) TO MAKE SURE THAT NO APPLICATION OF FINANCIAL ASSISTANCE WAS EVER RECEIVED AND THAT THERE EXISTS OBJECTIVE EVIDENCE THAT THE PATIENT DOES HAVE SUFFICIENT FINANCIAL MEANS TO PAY ALL OR PART OF HIS/HER BILL. PRIOR TO A COLLECTIONS SUIT BEING FILED, THE SELF-PAY COLLECTIONS DIRECTOR MUST REVIEW AND APPROVE. 2. RESIDENTIAL LIENS: NO HOSPITAL WILL PLACE A LIEN ON THE PRIMARY RESIDENCE OF A PATIENT WHO HAS BEEN DETERMINED TO BE ELIGIBLE FOR FINANCIAL ASSISTANCE/CHARITY CARE, FOR PAYMENT OF THE PATIENT'S UNDISCOUNTED BALANCE DUE. FURTHER, IN NO CASE WILL ANY HOSPITAL EXECUTE A LIEN BY FORCING THE SALE OR FORECLOSURE OF THE PRIMARY RESIDENCE OF ANY PATIENT TO PAY FOR ANY OUTSTANDING MEDICAL BILL. 3. NO USE OF BODY ATTACHMENTS: NO HOSPITAL WILL USE BODY ATTACHMENT TO REQUIRE ANY PERSON, WHETHER RECEIVING FINANCIAL ASSISTANCE/CHARITY CARE DISCOUNTS OR NOT, TO APPEAR IN COURT. 4. COLLECTION AGENCY REFERRALS: EACH HOSPITAL FINANCE ACCOUNTING WILL ENSURE THAT ALL COLLECTION AGENCIES USED TO COLLECT PATIENT BILLS PROMPTLY REFER ANY PATIENT WHO INDICATES FINANCIAL NEED, OR OTHERWISE APPEARS TO QUALIFY FOR FINANCIAL ASSISTANCE/CHARITY CARE DISCOUNTS, TO A FINANCIAL COUNSELOR TO DETERMINE IF THE PATIENT IS ELIGIBLE FOR SUCH A CHARITABLE DISCOUNT. IN CASES WHERE A PATIENT HAS BEEN BILLED BUT IS LATER DETERMINED TO QUALIFY UNDER THE FINANCIAL ASSISTANCE POLICY WITHIN THE APPLICATION PERIOD, THE CHARGE IS REVERSED AND THE APPROPRIATE AMOUNT APPLIED TO CHARITY, AND THE PATIENT IS PROVIDED A REFUND IF THE FINAL PATIENT RESPONSIBILITY IS LESS THAN THE PATIENT ALREADY PAID.

202111349349300221,231352222,"Part VI, Line 2 - Needs Assessment","WellSpan Health and its entities have a long history of understanding and responding to the needs of the communities and populations it serves. This commitment was strengthened in 1998 when, in partnership with the Healthy York County Coalition, WellSpan conducted its first Community Health Needs Assessment (CHNA). Six subsequent CHNAs were conducted in 2000, 2005, 2008, 2012, 2015 and 2018. These assessments- one method for collecting diverse information on a community and which involves surveying a representative sample of community members on their demographics, chronic health conditions, lifestyle behaviors, finances, access to health services, and related topics- have been administered before the Affordable Care Act (ACA) requirement. As previously noted, the WellSpan CHNA process, which includes survey development, data collection and analysis, and result dissemination, was led by both county-level health coalitions- Healthy Adams County and the Healthy York County Coalition- for Adams and York Counties. A similar process was utilized for the remaining counties of the WellSpan service area, including northern Lancaster and Lebanon counties. Healthy Adams County, Healthy York County Coalition, and its regional partner the Community Health Council of Lebanon County receive financial support from WellSpan Health and its entities, and other community stakeholders. The CHNA was developed utilizing consulting support and guidance through a contract with the Floyd Institute for Public Policy at Franklin and Marshall College. Dr. Berwood Yost, Institute Director and Project Lead has an extensive background conducting and analyzing community and corporate surveys and has been integral to the prior three CHNAs (2008, 2012 and 2015). The 2018 Adams and York CHNA is a byproduct of a collaboration of community organizations who partnered to provide guidance and support to the effort, including: County of York, Family First Health; Gettysburg College; UPMC Pinnacle Hanover; UPMC Pinnacle Memorial; York County Human Services; South Central Community Action Program (SCCAP); TrueNorth Wellness Services; United Way of York County; York City Health Bureau; York College of Pennsylvania, and; York County Community Foundation. This collaboration of community stakeholders determined the survey questions to be asked of the community; discussed data collection methodology, including sample size and method of obtaining data; reviewed the raw data and supporting charts/ graphs; identified potential community health priorities, and; developed the process by which results and priorities were to be shared with the community. The 2018 CHNA planning process engaged a wide range of community organizations serving the diverse interests of all partners. The intent of the CHNA was to collect adequate valuable data and information that would satisfy the needs of all participating organizations, without burdening CHNA respondents with too many questions. Committee members reviewed questions asked in the 2015 CHNA and edited accordingly based on the current health care environment and areas of interest. Survey questions were derived from the Behavioral Risk Factor Surveillance System (BRFSS), a validated survey tool utilized by the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC), and organized into four categories: healthcare access, behavioral risk, health conditions and prevention behaviors and context. A representative sample of 799 adult residents in York County were interviewed between December 4, 2017 and February 25, 2018. Supplemental secondary data from the Robert Wood Johnson Foundation (RWJF) annual County Health Rankings and from the Pennsylvania Department of Health was compiled and integrated into the 2018 CHNA. Data collected and analyzed by the Floyd Institute for Public Policy included breakdowns by age, gender, geographic area, race/ethnicity, and income level, and enabled the development of charts/ graphs that identified: trends and disparities; quantity of residents affected; health risks and disability-adjusted life years, and; social determinants of health impact. This information is included in the 2018 Community Health Needs Assessment Summary Report available at www.wellspan.org. CHNA results and related priorities identified by Healthy York County Coalition were shared with the system-wide Planning Committee at WellSpan Health, a Committee comprised of community members and leaders that represent each of WellSpans primary entities and service areas, in addition to corporate leadership. Planning Committee members reviewed the CHNA data, and designated system-wide priorities as: Care for all, including a focus on access to care and health equity; Behavioral health and lifelong wellness, which would incorporate behavioral health, substance use and addiction and lifelong wellness, and; healthy communities and social determinants of health, which provide a deeper dive into community engagement, social determinants of health and violence prevention. The identified priorities and associated data were subsequently presented to the WellSpan- York Hospital Board for their adoption. Board members discussed the data and identified priorities within the context of existing staffing and financial resources, current and future entity initiatives, and community partnership opportunities to address systemic community change. The final CHNA report, along with the WellSpan Community Health Improvement Plan (CHIP) was presented in June 2019 to the Planning Committee, at which time correlations were observed between the CHNA, CHIP and the WellSpan 2025 Strategic Plan."
202111349349300221,231352222,"Part VI, Line 5 - Promotion of Community Health","As a charitable, community-based healthcare organization, our commitment to improving the lives and well-being of the people and communities we serve is evident in our mission statement: working as one to improve health through exceptional care for all, lifelong wellness, and healthier communities."" Employees live out this mission statement every day by engaging in community benefit activities that address community needs, especially the health priorities identified in the 2018 CHNA - access to care and health equity; behavioral health, substance use and addiction, and lifelong wellness, and community engagement, social determinants of health and violence prevention. Below are a few examples of the work accomplished to address each: *Access to healthcare and medications for uninsured community members or those with high out-of-pocket costs is often financially challenging. Healthy Community Network, a collaborative between WellSpan Health, physicians and community partners to support prospective enrollment, the management and support of patients, and coordination of care, serves as a support for those individuals, offering free or discounted resources based on need. In 2020, Healthy Community Network served 3,029 community members in need of care across the region and provided financial assistance for 14,379 prescriptions, allowing individuals who lack sufficient health insurance or financial means to access the medications they need.*WellSpan remains committed to the strong safety net of partnering health care services in our region. Together, we demonstrate strong community impact in health. For example, WellSpans support of both the Family First Health Hannah Penn Center and Katallasso Family Health Center enhanced its ability to provide 4,307 acute and preventive visits for underserved adults and children*In 2020, WellSpan Health encouraged community members, local employers and employees, and WellSpan staff and patients to engage in the 8th annual 10 Pound Throwdown initiative. The 10 Pound Throwdown is a 10-week community challenge that encourages participants to lose or maintain a healthy weight through healthier eating and increased physical activity. The initiative was created in 2013 to address the growing issue of adult overweight/obesity and utilizes a core website (www.10poundthrowdown.com) to encourage team participation and to offer an online weight tracker, badges to encourage healthier choices, and diverse health education resources. The 10 Pound Throwdown engaged 7,200 community members across four southcentral Pennsylvania counties -Adams, Lancaster, Lebanon, and York- in the 2020 iteration of the program. *WellSpan Health -York Hospital primary care practices in York County participated in the Market Bucks program to address food insecurity and increase the consumption of fruits and vegetables. Regionally, this program provided fruit and vegetable vouchers to 310 WellSpan patients with food insecurity challenges, which contributed nearly $31,620 to local farmers and growers. This program reaches those with an elevated Body Mass Index (BMI) who also experience a comorbidity associated with diet. Market Bucks consistently boasts an astounding 86% redemption rate, in addition to demonstrating increased fruit and vegetable consumption for participants with medical challenges. *WellSpans commitment to lifelong wellness begins with the support it provides to our youngest residents. WellSpan- York Hospital remains the lead agency for Safe Kids York County, engaged more than 2,200 community members, primarily children and families, in child safety activities on topics like abuse, bicycle, sports, pedestrian, and medication and distributed more than 136 cribs to families without a safe place for their baby to sleep. *Celebrating more than a decade of promoting summertime physical activity, Get Outdoors (GO) York!, a partnership between WellSpan-York Hospital and York County Libraries, more than 5,000 children registered to participate with their families in an adaptation of letterboxing, an international hobby where participants use written clues to find items hidden in various places. *Opioid use, as in other communities across the United States, has become a crisis in York County. WellSpan remains a steadfast partner in advancing work in this area. In 2020, we actively supported the York Opioid Collaborative by helping to solicit funds and participating in the Public Health, Safety, and Data teams. WellSpan admitted 520 patients into a Medication Assisted Treatment (MAT) program, which combines the use of medications and behavioral therapy to treat people with substance use disorders. *WellSpan Health and its community partners have been working to address housing insecurity in central Pennsylvania. Three of the collaborative solutions- the Omega Bed Lease Program, Arches to Wellness and ALPHA Community Initiative- earned the Hospital and Health System Association of Pennsylvania (HAP) 2019 Living the Vision award. Through these programs, WellSpan and community partners provided 250 individuals emergency housing with a bridge to more sustainable solutions.*Historically, WellSpan Health and its entities have taken planned steps to build community capacity that addresses complex health issues, as identified by the Community Health Needs Assessment (CHNA). Through financial and management support of a county health coalition, the Healthy York County Coalition (HYCC), more than 200 York County community members have been engaged in community health improvement initiatives. HYCC consists of three committees -Access and Empowerment; Community Engagement, and; Prevention and Wellness, each of which continue to attract new community members, leaders, and professionals. These committees foster partnerships and collaboration between entities to ensure that efforts to address and impact identified community health needs are coordinated and successful. In 2020, the Healthy York County Coalition engaged community members around the 2019 research on York County residents life expectancy variance by zip code. *WellSpan-York Hospital maintains its commitment to supporting local non-projects with Community Partnership Grant funds to like-minded nonprofit organizations to address key issues and health priorities. In fiscal year 2020, nearly $70,000 was awarded to 12 agencies in early response to COVID-19 spread in the community. Other Community Partnership Grants were awarded to Healthy York Coalition, Leg Up Farm, York Fresh Food Market, and York County Cerebral Palsy.

For accounts receivable associated with services provided to patients who have third-party coverage, the System estimates net realizable value based on the estimated contractual reimbursement percentage, which in turn is based on current contract provisions and historical paid claims by payor. For self-pay accounts, including uninsured and patient responsibility accounts, the net realizable value is determined using historical collection experience, adjusted for estimated conversions of patient responsibility portions, expected recoveries and changes in trends to estimate implicit price concessions. Management continually reviews the estimated net realizable value of accounts receivable by monitoring cash collections, economic conditions and trends, changes in payor mix, changes in federal or state healthcare coverage and other matters. The System grants credit without collateral to its patients, most of whom are local residents and are insured under third-party payor agreements, primarily with Medicare, Medicaid and various commercial insurance companies. The System records accounts receivable net of estimated price concessions and such amounts have historically been within managements expectations.

These top priorities represent the intersection of documented unmet community health needs and the organization's key strengths and mission. These priorities were identified and approved by the UMMC/Midtown CHI Team and validated with the health experts from the UMB Campus Panel and ultimately approved by the Board. Programming is based on these strategic priorities as identified in the CHNA. 1) Mental Health (in collaboration with City hospitals) 2) Substance Abuse 3) Chronic Disease Management (CVD, Diabetes, HIV) 4) Maternal/Child Health 5) Violence Prevention 6) Workforce Development The University of Maryland Medical Center has community health programming in each of the above strategic community priorities. The following is an example of key initiatives from three of the above priorities. Identified Need/Priority: Substance Abuse Prevention Identified Need: Tobacco Prevention/Cessation Currently, there is a 23% prevalence rate of tobacco use in the targeted population and much higher rates in specific neighborhoods. Hospital Initiative: Tobacco Prevention/Cessation Primary objectives of initiative: 1) Reduce the % of adults who are current smokers (Maryland SHIP) 2) Reduce the % of youths using any kind of tobacco product (high school only) 3) Increase awareness about the dangers of tobacco use Single or multi-year plan: This program is a multi-year, ongoing initiative. Key collaborators in delivery: UMMC Downtown Campus American Lung Association Baltimore City Health Dept. Fox 45 Impact of hospital initiative: Tobacco prevention education and cessation are offered in the community as well as through online and television platforms. Metrics: * # of people educated in the community Evaluation of Outcomes in FY20: * 1,368 individuals (adults and youth) educated in the community Continuation of initiative: UMMC Midtown will continue to monitor performance and outcome measures annually. This priority and the accompanying initiatives will continue until the FY18 CHNA is completed and as long as there continues to be an identified community need. Identified Need/Priority: Diabetes Prevention Identified Need: Diabetes Prevention Currently, there is a 34% prevalence rate of obesity in the targeted population and much higher rates in specific neighborhoods. Diabetes and obesity are major causes of cardiovascular disease and increases an individual's chances for developing co-morbidities and lowers life expectancy. Hospital Initiative: Diabetes Prevention - Diabetes & nutrition education Primary objectives of initiative: 1) Increase the % of adults who are at a healthy weight (Maryland SHIP) 2) Provide education and information on healthy lifestyle through engaging education on diabetes awareness, nutrition, and weight management in the community Single or multi-year plan: This program is a multi-year, ongoing initiative. Key collaborators in delivery: UMMC Downtown Campus American Diabetes Association Senior Centers throughout Baltimore City Impact of hospital initiative: Diabetes prevention education and nutrition/weight management education is offered throughout the community. Metrics: * # of adults enrolled Evaluation of Outcomes in FY20: * 80 educated on diabetes prevention (DPP) topics * 130 educated on general nutrition topics (Less due to COVID) Continuation of initiative: UMMC Midtown will continue to monitor performance and outcome measures annually. This priority and the accompanying initiatives will continue until the FY18 CHNA is completed and as long as there continues to be an identified community need. Identified Need/Priority: HIV Prevention Identified Need: HIV Prevention Currently, there is a 10% prevalence rate in adults at high risk for HIV and/or Hep C within the targeted population Hospital Initiative: HIV Prevention Primary objectives of initiative: 1) Reduce the % of adults who are current smokers (Maryland SHIP) 2) Reduce the % of youths using any kind of tobacco product (high school only) 3) Increase awareness about the dangers of tobacco use Single or multi-year plan: This program is a multi-year, ongoing initiative. Key collaborators in delivery: UMMC Downtown Campus Institute of Human Virology Star Track Adolescent HIV Clinic, University of Maryland PREP Task Force Baltimore City Health Department University of Maryland Baltimore Community Engagement Center Impact of hospital initiative: Providing free community screenings for HIV and Hep C identifies individuals infected earlier so that they can begin treatment and improve their life expectancy. By identifying partners and others who need the PREP program, this helps to prevent the transmission of both diseases. Community education helps inform the public about the routes of transmission and helps to prevent infection. Metrics: * # of people screened in the community for HIV * # of people screened in the community for Hep C * # of positives for HIV and Hep C * # of positives referred to treatment Evaluation of Outcomes in FY20: * 218 screened for HIV * 42 screened for Hep C * 0 new HIV positives * 7 new Hep C positives and 100% referred to treatment Continuation of initiative: UMMC Midtown will continue to monitor performance and outcome measures annually. This priority and the accompanying initiatives will continue until the FY18 CHNA is completed and as long as there continues to be an identified community need. UMMC Midtown operates under a unique regulatory system that caps hospital revenues and provides adjustments to allow for population health improvement investments. Under Maryland's global budget revenue model, UMMC Midtown reports on a regular basis how it is investing in efforts to improve population health. UMMC Midtown provides on-going services that are fundamental to addressing the identified community health needs that demonstrate the extent to which our commitment to serve our community is integrated into our care delivery model. We have a strong focus on treating patients with chronic conditions. UMMC Midtown works to coordinate care, ensure smooth transitions and promote disease self-management strategies at every step of a patient's journey - whether at home, in the community, or within our hospital. We operate specialized clinics to enable access to routine outpatient care. Our transitional care services help patients newly diagnosed or those that have had a recent hospitalization transition safely back to the community. Transitional nurse navigators provide patients with disease education and self-management strategies, connect them to primary care providers and specialists, and help them overcome any barriers to making follow up appointments. An urgent care center to address off hours visits and low acuity emergencies is also available. Our coudamin clinic provides anticoagulation medication management, specifically managing and monitoring warfarin (Coumadin) therapy upon physician referral. It also provides patients with ongoing monitoring of their anticoagulation therapy to ensure desired outcomes and decrease adverse events. UMMC Midtown's congestive heart failure clinic provides similar disease-specific services. Additionally, our behavioral health clinic provides a community access point for those in need of outpatient mental health services. Resources are embedded throughout the hospital and in the community so that every patient receives the same level of care coordination. Care managers are embedded within our emergency department, community and hospital, and provide in-home visits as needed. Community health workers reach out to patients who are identified as being high risk for readmission or in need of critical resources. Close relationships are maintained with skilled nursing facilities and home health agencies so that transfers from the hospital to these facilities are smooth, and the highest quality of care is constantly delivered. Strong relationships exist with local emergency medical service (EMS) providers through our mobile integrated health program, which delivers effective and efficient care to patients outside of the hospital. Nurses and community health workers function outside traditional emergency response roles, with a focus on maintaining individuals' health at their homes while also providing convenient access to care in the community. Additional care partners include primary care providers, specialists, local department of health, office on aging and other community based partners. We are proudly partnered with Lyft, providing rides to patient follow up appointments. We also provide housing assistance to those in need because we know that stable housing leads to better health."

THE CENTER OFFERS COMMUNITY EDUCATIONAL SESSIONS ON A VARIETY OF MEDICAL TOPICS AS PART OF OUR FOCUS ON WELLNESS AND PREVENTION. IN 2019, OUR EDUCATIONAL SESSIONS HAVE FOCUSED ON DIABETES, HEART HEALTH, AND BREAST, PROSTATE AND SKIN CANCER. STAFF CONTINUALLY ASSESS THE EDUCATIONAL NEEDS OF THE COMMUNITY AND DEVELOP ADDITIONAL TOPICS AS NEEDED. AS AN ORGANIZATION, SFMC HAS COMMITTED RESOURCES FOR MEMBERSHIP FOR BOTH THE EXECUTIVE BOARD OF THT AND MEMBERSHIP ON THE COMMUNITY ADVISORY BOARD, AND REPRESENTATION ON THE PRIORITY TEAMS FOR CHRONIC DISEASE, AND HEALTH DISPARITIES/LITERACY. RESOURCES WERE ALSO COMMITTED TO THE GREATER MERCER PUBLIC HEALTH PARTNERSHIP (GMPHP) SO THAT SFMC COULD ACTIVELY PARTICIPATE IN ITS 2019 COUNTYWIDE CHNA AND CHIP PROCESS. STAFF WERE ASSIGNED AND PLAY AN ACTIVE ROLE IN THE GMPHP SERVING ON ITS BOARD AND VARIOUS SUB-COMMITTEES.IN AN EFFORT TO PREVENT THE SALE OF ALL FLAVORED E-CIGARETTES TO TRENTON CHILDREN, SFMC CONTINUED TO WORK WITH OUTSIDE ORGANIZATIONS, INCLUDING THE HUNTERDON MERCER REGIONAL TOBACCO COLLABORATIVE, THE NEW JERSEY QUIT LINE, MOMS QUIT CONNECTION, TOBACCO-FREE FOR A HEALTHY NEW JERSEY, OUR CONCERNED PASTORS ORGANIZATION AND OUR HOSPITAL EMPLOYEES. SFMC HAS BEEN AN ADVOCATE OF ALL BILLS THAT WOULD CURTAIL THE SALE AND USE OF VAPING AND E-CIGARETTE PRODUCTS IN THE STATE, FOLLOWING MORE THAN 2,000 CASES OF VAPING-RELATED ILLNESS NATIONWIDE AND 39 DEATHS SPANNING 24 STATES. RESEARCH HAS SHOWN THAT FLAVORED ELECTRONIC SMOKING DEVICES AND PRODUCTS, SUCH AS MINT, CANDY, FRUIT AND CHOCOLATE ARE EXTREMELY APPEALING TO CHILDREN. IN JANUARY 2020, NEW JERSEY BECAME THE FIRST STATE IN THE NATION TO IMPOSE A PERMANENT BAN ON ALL FLAVORED VAPE PRODUCTS, INCLUDING MENTHOL. ADVOCACY FOR S3265 WAS ENDORSED WITH APPEARANCES AT THE STATE HOUSE. TRANSFORMING COMMUNITIES INITIATIVE (TCI) IS A FIVE-YEAR POPULATION HEALTH PROJECT FUNDED BY TRINITY HEALTH TO ADDRESS POLICY, SYSTEM, AND ENVIRONMENTAL CHANGE AND TO PROMOTE HEALTHY BEHAVIORS. TCI WAS DEVELOPED AS A KEY STRATEGY OF TRINITY HEALTH'S PEOPLE-CENTERED 2020 COMMUNITY HEALTH AND WELL-BEING STRATEGY, FOCUSING ON SIX HEALTH ISSUES RELATED TO POOR DIET, PHYSICAL INACTIVITY, TOBACCO USE, CHRONIC DISEASE AND OTHER SOCIAL DETERMINANTS OF HEALTH. TRENTON, THROUGH TRENTON HEALTH TEAM (THT), IS ONE OF SIX COMMUNITIES SELECTED NATIONALLY TO IMPROVE LOCAL PUBLIC HEALTH AND WELL-BEING, ALONG WITH SPRINGFIELD, MASSACHUSETTS; MAYWOOD, ILLINOIS; MONTGOMERY COUNTY, MARYLAND; BOISE, IDAHO; AND SYRACUSE, NEW YORK. THE SIX REQUIRED INTERVENTIONS ARE: (1) TOBACCO 21- WWW.TOBACCO21.ORG/, (2) COMPLETE STREETS - WWW.SMARTGROWTHAMERICA.ORG/COMPLETE-STREETS, (3) IMPLEMENTATION OF NUTRITION STANDARDS IN EARLY CHILDHOOD SETTINGS (DAYCARE AND HEAD START), (4) BREASTFEEDING POLICY ENHANCEMENT, (5) SCHOOL BOARD POLICY TO ENHANCE PHYSICAL ACTIVITY IN SCHOOLS, AND (6) FOOD AND BEVERAGE STANDARDS/COMPETITIVE FOODS POLICIES.IN AN EFFORT TO ADDRESS THE ASPECT OF ALCOHOL AND SUBSTANCE ABUSE AS SOCIAL INFLUENCERS OF HEALTH, SFMC ADDED TWO IMPORTANT QUESTIONS TO THE REGISTRATION QUESTIONNAIRE IN THE EMERGENCY ROOM RELATED TO USAGE. THESE QUESTIONS WERE ADDRESSED BY THE TRIAGE NURSE AND ENTERED INTO THE COMPUTER SYSTEM. ANY POSITIVE RESULTS REQUIRED THE NURSE TO GIVE THE PATIENT A RESOURCE FORM AND A REFERRAL TO A LOCAL AGENCY. IN 2019 THE HOSPITAL, IN COLLABORATION WITH THT, BEGAN TO UTILIZE A SYSTEM KNOWN AS NOWPOW. THIS SYSTEM IS A NEW WAY TO ADDRESS SOCIAL DETERMINANTS OF HEALTH. IT ALLOWS SFMC TO CLOSE THE LOOP ON REFERRALS MADE WITHIN THE SYSTEM OF RESOURCES. THE NOWPOW SYSTEM ALLOWS THE HOSPITAL TO:- SEARCH WITHIN A CARE-SOURCED RESOURCE DIRECTORY TO LOCATE LOCAL HEALTH AND SOCIAL SERVICES IN OUR IMMEDIATE COMMUNITY- BETTER SUPPORT PATIENT CARE BY USING PRINT, TEXT AND EMAIL IN MULTIPLE LANGUAGES (SPANISH, CHINESE, ARABIC, KOREAN, POLISH AND SOMALI)- CLOSE THE LOOP ON REFERRALS BY UTILIZING A BI-DIRECTIONAL PLATFORM TO REDUCE CALL AND EMAIL TRAFFIC AND SEND APPOINTMENT REMINDERS VIA TEXT OR EMAIL IN MULTIPLE LANGUAGES.- MEASURE THE IMPACT OF THE REFERRAL SYSTEM BY GATHERING IMPORTANT STATISTICS FOR DASHBOARD USAGE.TO DATE, THREE MEMBERS OF SFMC HAVE BEEN ORIENTED TO THE SYSTEM AND GIVEN ACCESS TO ALL SFMC INFORMATION.BEFORE, DURING AND AFTER THE COVID-19 VIRUS WAS DEEMED A GLOBAL PANDEMIC, SFMC REMAINED COMMITTED TO SUPPORTING OUR TRENTON COMMUNITY. THE FOLLOWING EFFORTS WERE IMPLEMENTED TO ENSURE THAT OUR COMMUNITY WAS GIVEN THE MOST UP-TO-THE-DATE INFORMATION RELATED TO HEALTHCARE AND SOCIAL NEEDS:- INCIDENT COMMAND CALLS - THESE CALLS WERE HELD THREE TIMES A WEEK BY THE HOSPITAL CEO TO DISSEMINATE, DISCUSS AND STRATEGIZE INFORMATION TO ALL THE HOSPITAL LEADERS. EACH CALL LASTED AN HOUR AND ALLOWED THE PARTICIPATION OF APPROXIMATELY TWENTY DEPARTMENT HEADS.- SFMC HOT LINE - THIS PHONE LINE WAS ESTABLISHED TO ALLOW THE COMMUNITY ACCESS TO COVID RELATED TOPICS. THE HUMAN VOICE OF A REGISTERED NURSE RESPONDED TO EACH CALL AND WAS AVAILABLE 24/7 TO DISCUSS ANY ISSUES THAT WERE RAISED.- SFMC E-MAIL ADDRESS - A DEDICATED EMAIL ADDRESS WAS DESIGNATED FOR COVID-19 RELATED QUESTIONS. THIS SITE WAS ALSO MANNED BY A REGISTERED NURSE ON A 24/7 BASIS. - PUI CALLS - A PATIENTS UNDER INVESTIGATION LIST WAS CREATED FOR ALL PATIENTS EITHER UTILIZING THE SFMC EMERGENCY DEPARTMENT OR ADMITTED TO THE HOSPITAL FACILITY ITSELF. EACH PATIENT WAS CONTACTED BY PHONE FOLLOWING DISCHARGE TO DISCUSS HIS/HER HEALTH CONDITION. SYMPTOMS WERE REVIEWED AND QUARANTINE INFORMATION DISCUSSED WITH EACH PERSON IN THEIR OWN LANGUAGE, SUCH AS ENGLISH OR SPANISH.- TEMPORARY SFMC COVID-19 TESTING SITE - A TENT WAS ERECTED AND STAFFED OUTSIDE THE EMERGENCY DEPARTMENT TO PROVIDE A WALK-UP SITE FOR TESTING OF COMMUNITY MEMBERS.- DONATION OF STAFF TIME TO THE COMMUNITY - A MEMBER OF THE SFMC NURSING STAFF VOLUNTEERED AT THE QUAKER BRIDGE MALL SITE FOR WALK-UP TESTING. SHE WORKED THERE FOR A TOTAL OF THREE WEEKS TO ASSIST WITH COMMUNITY TESTING.- ESTABLISHMENT OF SOCIAL CARE HUB - A PHONE LINE AND CONTACT WAS ESTABLISHED TO DIRECT COMMUNITY MEMBERS IN NEED OF FOOD, HOUSING, AND ALL SOCIAL NEEDS. THIS LINE WAS VERY EFFECTIVE IN RELAYING THE LATEST INFORMATION TO THOSE IN NEED.- COMMUNICATION - IN COLLABORATION WITH THE TRENTON HEALTH TEAM, SFMC HAS POSTED TO OUR SOCIAL MEDIA CHANNELS INFORMATION ABOUT THE IMPORTANCE OF MASKING AND DOING SO PROPERLY, EMERGENCY FARMER'S MARKET INFO AND COVID TESTING INFORMATION. WE ALSO TOOK PART IN A BILLBOARD CAMPAIGN BY THT ON THE IMPORTANCE OF MASKING.- COLLABORATIVE PHONE CALLS - SFMC PARTICIPATED IN WEEKLY CALLS WITH THE COMMUNITY ADVISORY BOARD OF TRENTON HEALTH TEAM TO DISCUSS FOOD INSECURITY, TESTING INFORMATION, ETC.- LIVE QUESTION AND ANSWER SESSIONS - THREE SESSIONS WERE HELD IN COLLABORATION WITH THE TRENTON HEALTH TEAM. ONE OF OUR HOSPITAL PHYSICIANS PARTICIPATED IN A SESSION HELD IN APRIL WHICH WAS HELD FOR LOCAL CHURCH COMMUNITIES. THE SECOND SESSION, HELD IN MAY, FEATURED A HOSPITAL PHYSICIAN OFFERING UP-TO-DATE COVID-19 INFORMATION TO THE TRENTON PUBLIC SCHOOL NURSES. THE THIRD SESSION WAS A FACEBOOK LIVE EVENT FEATURING OUR CEO OFFERING PERSPECTIVE ON THE IMPACT OF THE VIRUS ON THE ER/EMS AND HOSPITAL OPERATIONS. THIS EVENT WAS HELD IN JUNE.- CONVERSION OF SPACE FOR PATIENT CARE - SFMC, AT THE REQUEST OF THE STATE GOVERNOR AND THE COMMISSIONER OF HEALTH, PARTNERED WITH THE ARMY CORPS OF ENGINEERS AND THE NJ STATE POLICE TO INCREASE BED CAPACITY IN RESPONSE TO THE COVID-19 PANDEMIC. THE PROJECT INCLUDED UPGRADES TO THE ELECTRICAL, PLUMBING AND HVAC SYSTEMS IN ADDITION TO PATIENT SAFETY INFRASTRUCTURE UPGRADES OF THE FIRE SUPPRESSION, NURSE CALL BELL AND EMERGENCY SIGNAGE/LIGHTING SYSTEMS. THE RECENTLY COMPLETED PROJECT TO THE 4TH AND 6TH FLOORS OF THE MEDICAL CENTER INCREASES CAPACITY BY 37 BEDS AND PROVIDES ST.

ADDRESSING AT LEAST ONE SIGNIFICANT HEALTH NEED IDENTIFIED BY THEIR HOSPITAL'S COMMUNITY HEALTH NEEDS ASSESSMENTADDITIONALLY, IN RESPONSE TO COVID-19, TRINITY HEALTH MEMBER HOSPITALS MOBILIZED NATIONAL INFRASTRUCTURE TO ASSESS THE MOST URGENT NEEDS IN THEIR COMMUNITIES. TRINITY HEALTH MEMBER HOSPITALS STRENGTHENED PARTNERSHIPS WITH COMMUNITY-BASED ORGANIZATIONS AND COLLABORATED WITH MEDICAL GROUPS AND CLINICALLY INTEGRATED NETWORKS PROVIDING DIRECT PATIENT CARE TO ENSURE THAT PATIENT SOCIAL NEEDS WERE MET IN THE COMMUNITY. LIKEWISE, MEMBER HOSPITALS ACCELERATED THEIR SOCIAL SERVICES RESPONSE BY ESTABLISHING SOCIAL CARE PROGRAMS TO CONNECT PATIENTS, COLLEAGUES AND COMMUNITY MEMBERS TO LOCAL SOCIAL SERVICES SUCH AS: FOOD, HOUSING, FINANCIAL ASSISTANCE AND ACCESS TO HEALTH CARE. FROM MARCH THROUGH JUNE, SOCIAL CARE MADE OVER 103,000 CONNECTIONS, AND TRINITY HEALTH PROVIDED OVER 44,000 MEDICAL SERVICES TO THOSE WHO ARE HOMELESS AND THROUGH COMMUNITY TESTING EVENTS. SOCIAL INFLUENCERS OF HEALTH - SUCH AS ADEQUATE HOUSING, PERSONAL SAFETY AND ACCESS TO FOOD, EDUCATION, INCOME, AND HEALTH COVERAGE - HAVE A SIGNIFICANT IMPACT ON THE HEALTH OF COMMUNITIES. IN AN EFFORT TO ADDRESS SOME OF THESE INFLUENCERS, TRINITY HEALTH INVESTED $3.7 MILLION IN THE TRANSFORMING COMMUNITIES INITIATIVE (TCI), WHICH INITIALLY LAUNCHED IN FISCAL YEAR 2016. TCI IS A SHARED FUNDING MODEL AND TECHNICAL-ASSISTANCE INITIATIVE SUPPORTING EIGHT TRINITY HEALTH HOSPITALS, AND THEIR COMMUNITY PARTNERS, TO IMPLEMENT POLICY, SYSTEM, AND ENVIRONMENTAL CHANGE STRATEGIES TO PREVENT TOBACCO USE AND CHILDHOOD OBESITY, AND TO AFFECT CHANGE RELATED TO THE SOCIAL INFLUENCERS OF HEALTH. IN ADDITION TO TRINITY HEALTH'S INVESTMENT, TCI HAS LEVERAGED OVER $12.4 MILLION IN COMMUNITY MATCH FUNDING TO DATE.

THE ORGANIZATION BELIEVES THAT MEDICARE UNDERPAYMENTS (SHORTFALL) AND THE COST OF BAD DEBT ARE COMMUNITY BENEFIT AND SHOULD BE INCLUDED ON FORM 990, SCHEDULE H, PART I. AS OUTLINED MORE FULLY BELOW, THE ORGANIZATION BELIEVES THAT THESE SERVICES AND RELATED COSTS PROMOTE THE HEALTH OF THE COMMUNITY AS A WHOLE AND ARE RENDERED IN CONJUNCTION WITH THE ORGANIZATION'S CHARITABLE TAX-EXEMPT PURPOSES AND MISSION IN PROVIDING MEDICALLY NECESSARY HEALTHCARE SERVICES TO ALL INDIVIDUALS IN A NON- DISCRIMINATORY MANNER WITHOUT REGARD TO RACE, COLOR, CREED, SEX, NATIONAL ORIGIN, RELIGION OR ABILITY TO PAY AND IS CONSISTENT WITH THE COMMUNITY BENEFIT STANDARD PROMULGATED BY THE IRS. THE COMMUNITY BENEFIT STANDARD IS THE CURRENT STANDARD FOR A TAX-EXEMPT AND CHARITABLE ORGANIZATION UNDER THE INTERNAL REVENUE CODE (""IRC"") 501(C)(3). SATISFYING THE ""COMMUNITY BENEFIT STANDARD,"" AS ARTICULATED BY THE INTERNAL REVENUE SERVICE (IRS) IN REVENUE RULING 69-545, IS CURRENTLY REQUIRED FOR A HOSPITAL TO BE RECOGNIZED AS A CHARITABLE ORGANIZATION UNDER INTERNAL REVENUE CODE (IRC) 501(C)(3). THIS RULING REMOVED THE PREVIOUS REQUIREMENT OF REVENUE RULING 56-185, KNOWN AS THE ""CHARITY CARE STANDARD,"" THAT IN ORDER TO BE A CHARITABLE ORGANIZATION, A HOSPITAL HAD TO PROVIDE, TO THE EXTENT OF ITS FINANCIAL ABILITY, FREE OR REDUCED-COST CARE TO PATIENTS UNABLE TO PAY FOR THEIR CARE. THIS EARLIER RULING EMPHASIZED THAT A LOW LEVEL OF CHARITY CARE DID NOT MEAN THAT A HOSPITAL WAS CHARITABLE SINCE THAT LEVEL COULD REFLECT THE HOSPITAL'S FINANCIAL ABILITY TO PROVIDE SUCH CARE. REVENUE RULING 56-185 ALSO NOTED THAT PUBLICLY SUPPORTED COMMUNITY HOSPITALS WOULD NORMALLY QUALIFY AS CHARITABLE BECAUSE THEY SERVE THE ENTIRE COMMUNITY AND A LOW LEVEL OF CHARITY CARE WOULD NOT IMPACT A HOSPITAL'S CHARITABLE STATUS IF IT WAS DUE TO THE SURROUNDING COMMUNITY'S LACK OF CHARITABLE DEMANDS. AS DEVELOPED IN REVENUE RULING 69-545, UNDER THE COMMUNITY BENEFIT STANDARD, HOSPITALS WERE JUDGED ON WHETHER THEY PROMOTE THE HEALTH OF A BROAD CLASS OF INDIVIDUALS IN THE COMMUNITY. THIS RULING INVOLVED A HOSPITAL THAT ONLY ADMITTED THOSE WHO COULD PAY FOR THE SERVICES EITHER BY THEMSELVES, THROUGH PRIVATE INSURANCE OR PUBLIC PROGRAMS SUCH AS MEDICARE. IN ADDITION, THE HOSPITAL OPERATED A FULL-TIME EMERGENCY ROOM THAT WAS OPEN TO EVERYONE. THE IRS RULED THAT THE HOSPITAL WAS CHARITABLE BECAUSE IT PROMOTED THE HEALTH OF PEOPLE IN ITS COMMUNITY. THE IRS REASONED THAT BECAUSE THE PROMOTION OF HEALTH WAS A CHARITABLE PURPOSE ACCORDING TO THE GENERAL LAW OF CHARITY, IT FELL WITHIN THE ""GENERALLY ACCEPTED LEGAL SENSE"" OF THE TERM CHARITABLE, AS REQUIRED BY TREASURY REGULATION SECTION 1.501 (C)(3)-1(D)(2). THE IRS RULED THAT THE PROMOTION OF HEALTH, LIKE RELIEF OF POVERTY AND THE ADVANCEMENT OF EDUCATION AND RELIGION, IS ONE OF THE PURPOSES OF THE GENERAL LAW OF CHARITY THAT IS DEEMED BENEFICIAL TO THE COMMUNITY AS A WHOLE EVEN THOUGH THE CLASS OF BENEFICIARIES ELIGIBLE TO RECEIVE A DIRECT BENEFIT FROM ITS ACTIVITIES DOES NOT INCLUDE ALL MEMBERS OF THE COMMUNITY, SUCH AS INDIGENT MEMBERS OF THE COMMUNITY, PROVIDED THAT THE CLASS IS NOT SO SMALL THAT ITS RELIEF IS NOT OF BENEFIT TO THE COMMUNITY. THE IRS CONCLUDED THAT THE HOSPITAL WAS ""PROMOTING THE HEALTH OF A CLASS OF PERSONS THAT IS BROAD ENOUGH TO BENEFIT THE COMMUNITY"" BECAUSE ITS EMERGENCY ROOM WAS OPEN TO ALL AND IT PROVIDED CARE TO THOSE WHO COULD PAY, WHETHER DIRECTLY OR THROUGH THIRD-PARTY REIMBURSEMENT. OTHER FACTORS THAT DEMONSTRATED COMMUNITY BENEFIT INCLUDED: SURPLUS FUNDS WERE USED TO IMPROVE PATIENT CARE, EXPAND FACILITIES AND ADVANCE MEDICAL TRAINING, EDUCATION AND RESEARCH; AND IT WAS CONTROLLED BY A BOARD OF DIRECTORS THAT CONSISTED OF INDEPENDENT CIVIC LEADERS. THE AMERICAN HOSPITAL ASSOCIATION (""AHA"") BELIEVES THAT MEDICARE UNDERPAYMENTS (SHORTFALLS) AND BAD DEBT SHOULD BE REPORTED AS COMMUNITY BENEFIT ON FORM 990, SCHEDULE H, PART I, LINE 7. THIS ORGANIZATION AGREES WITH THE AHA'S LETTER TO THE IRS DATED AUGUST 21, 2007 RESPONDING TO A DRAFT OF THE NEW FORM 990 AND SCHEDULE H, THE AHA ARGUED THAT MEDICARE UNDERPAYMENTS (SHORTFALLS) IS COMMUNITY BENEFIT FOR THE FOLLOWING REASONS: -PROVIDING CARE FOR THE ELDERLY AND SERVING MEDICARE PATIENTS REMAINS AN ESSENTIAL PART OF THE COMMUNITY BENEFIT STANDARD. -MEDICARE, LIKE MEDICAID, DOES NOT PAY THE FULL COST OF CARE. RECENTLY, MEDICARE REIMBURSES ONLY 92 CENTS FOR EVERY DOLLAR HOSPITALS SPEND TO CARE FOR MEDICARE PATIENTS. THE MEDICARE PAYMENT ADVISORY COMMISSION (""MEDPAC"") IN ITS MARCH 2007 REPORT TO CONGRESS CAUTIONED THAT UNDERPAYMENT WILL GET EVEN WORSE, WITH MARGINS REACHING A 10 YEAR LOW AT NEGATIVE 5.4 PERCENT. -MANY MEDICARE PATIENTS, LIKE THEIR MEDICAID COUNTERPARTS, ARE POOR. MORE THAN 46% OF MEDICARE SPENDING IS FOR BENEFICIARIES WHOSE INCOME IS BELOW 200% OF THE FEDERAL POVERTY LEVEL. MANY ARE ALSO ELIGIBLE FOR MEDICAID, SO CALLED -DUAL ELIGIBLES"". PENNSYLVANIA REQUIRES NON-PROFIT HOSPITALS TO PROVIDE A MINIMUM LEVEL OF COMMUNITY BENEFIT TO RETAIN EXEMPTION FROM STATE AND LOCAL TAXES. ACCORDING TO STATE GUIDANCE AND CASE LAW, THE UNREIMBURSED COST OF MEDICARE AND BAD DEBT IS CONSIDERED TO BE COMMUNITY BENEFIT FOR STATE TAX EXEMPTION PURPOSES. PART III, LINE 6 ONLY INCLUDES THOSE COSTS THAT ARE PERMITTED TO BE REPORTED IN THE HOSPITAL'S MEDICARE COST REPORT THAT IS REQUIRED TO BE FILED WITH THE FEDERAL GOVERNMENT. THE HOSPITAL CONSIDERS THE TOTAL MEDICARE UNDERPAYMENTS (SHORTFALL) OF 33,922,709 SHOULD BE REPORTED AS COMMUNITY BENEFIT ON THE FORM 990, SCHEDULE H, PART I, LINE 7. ALONG WITH PROVIDING CARE TO MEDICAID PATIENTS AND PROVIDING FREE OR DISCOUNTED CARE TO OTHER LOW INCOME PATIENTS, THE IRS COMMUNITY BENEFIT STANDARD INCLUDES THE PROVISION OF CARE TO THE ELDERLY AND MEDICARE PATIENTS. LIKE MEDICAID, MEDICARE DOES NOT PAY THE FULL COST OF PROVIDING CARE TO THESE PATIENTS, FORCING THE HOSPITAL TO USE OTHER FUNDS TO COVER THE SHORTFALL. MEDICARE SHORTFALLS MUST BE ABSORBED BY THE HOSPITAL IN ORDER TO CONTINUE TREATING THE ELDERLY IN OUR COMMUNITIES. THE HOSPITAL PROVIDES CARE REGARDLESS OF THE MEDICARE SHORTFALL AND IS THEREBY PROVIDING ACCESS TO MEDICAL SERVICES FOR THE ELDERLY AND RELIEVING THE FEDERAL GOVERNMENT OF THE BURDEN OF PAYING THE FULL COST FOR PROVIDING CARE TO MEDICARE PATIENTS. ABSENT THE MEDICARE PROGRAM, IT IS LIKELY THAT MANY MEDICARE PATIENTS WOULD BE ELIGIBLE FOR CHARITY CARE OR OTHER NEED BASED GOVERNMENT PROGRAMS. THE AMOUNT EXPENDED TO COVER THE SHORTFALL IS MONEY NOT AVAILABLE FOR FINANCIAL ASSISTANCE AND OTHER COMMUNITY BENEFIT NEEDS. BOTH THE HOSPITAL AND THE AHA BELIEVE THAT PATIENT BAD DEBT BE REPORTED AS A COMMUNITY BENEFIT ON FORM 990, SCHEDULE H, PART I, LINE 7. LIKE MEDICARE UNDERPAYMENTS (SHORTFALLS), BAD DEBT SHOULD BE REPORTED AS COMMUNITY BENEFIT BECAUSE: -A SIGNIFICANT PORTION OF BAD DEBT IS ATTRIBUTABLE TO LOW-INCOME PATIENTS, WHO FOR MANY REASONS DECLINE TO COMPLETE THE FORMS REQUIRED TO ESTABLISH ELIGIBILITY UNDER THE HOSPITAL'S CHARITY CARE OR FINANCIAL ASSISTANCE POLICY (FAP). A 2006 CONGRESSIONAL BUDGET OFFICE (""CBO""), ""NONPROFIT HOSPITALS AND THE PROVISION OF COMMUNITY BENEFIT"", CITED TWO STUDIES INDICATING THAT ""THE GREAT MAJORITY OF BAD DEBT WAS ATTRIBUTABLE TO PATIENTS WITH INCOMES BELOW 200% OF THE FEDERAL POVERTY LINE."" -THE CBO REPORT ALSO NOTED THAT A SUBSTANTIAL PORTION OF THE BAD DEBT IS PENDING CHARITY CARE. UNLIKE BAD DEBT IN OTHER INDUSTRIES, HOSPITAL BAD DEBT IS COMPLICATED BY THE FACT THAT HOSPITALS FOLLOW THEIR CHARITABLE MISSION TO THE COMMUNITY AND TREAT EVERY PATIENT THAT COMES THROUGH THE EMERGENCY DEPARTMENT, REGARDLESS OF ABILITY TO PAY. PATIENTS WHO HAVE OUTSTANDING BILLS ARE NOT TURNED AWAY, UNLIKE OTHER INDUSTRIES. BAD DEBT IS FURTHER COMPLICATED BY THE AUDITING INDUSTRY'S STANDARDS ON REPORTING CHARITY CARE. MANY PATIENTS CANNOT OR DO NOT PROVIDE THE NECESSARY DOCUMENTATION REQUIRED TO BE DEEMED CHARITY CARE BY AUDITORS. AS A RESULT, ACCORDING TO THE CBO REPORT, ROUGHLY 40% OF BAD DEBT IS PENDING CHARITY CARE. (IN FY 2020, APPROXIMATELY 11% OF THE HOSPITAL'S BAD DEBT WAS SUBSEQUENTLY RECLASSIFIED TO CHARITY CARE.) THE CBO CONCLUDED THAT ITS FINDINGS ""SUPPORT THE VALIDITY OF THE USE OF UNCOMPENSATED CARE (BAD DEBT AND CHARITY CARE) AS A MEASURE OF COMMUNITY BENEFITS"" ASSUMING THE FINDINGS ARE GENERALIZED NATIONALLY. THE EXPERIENCE OF HOSPITALS NATIONWIDE REINFORCE THAT THEY ARE GENERALIZABLE. AS OUTLINED BY THE AHA, DESPITE THE HOSPITAL'S BEST EFFORTS AND DUE DILIGENCE, PATIENT BAD DEBT IS A PART OF THE CHARITABLE MISSION AND CHARITABLE PURPOSES. BAD DEBT REPRESENTS PART OF THE BURDEN HOSPITALS' BEAR IN SERVING ALL PATIENTS REGARDLESS OF RACE, COLOR, CREED, SEX, NATIONAL ORIGIN, RELIGION OR ABILITY TO PAY. IN ADDITION, THE HOSPITAL INVESTS SIGNIFICANT RESOURCES IN SYSTEMS AND STAFF TRAINING TO ASSIST PATIENTS THAT ARE IN NEED OF FINANCIAL ASSISTANCE. FOR FISCAL YEAR ENDED 6/30/2020,"

THE NORTHEAST REGION POPULATION IS PRIMARILY WHITE, BUT DIVERSITY IS INCREASING. THE WHITE POPULATION AS A PERCENTAGE OF THE TOTAL POPULATION IS DECLINING IN ALL COUNTIES, WHILE BLACK/AFRICAN AMERICAN AND HISPANIC/LATINO POPULATIONS ARE GROWING. THE DEMOGRAPHIC SHIFT IS A STATEWIDE TREND. MINORITY POPULATIONS ARE THE ONLY GROWING DEMOGRAPHIC IN PENNSYLVANIA. THE HISPANIC/LATINO POPULATION IS ONE OF THE FASTEST GROWING DEMOGRAPHIC GROUPS; LUZERNE COUNTY IS PROJECTED TO EXPERIENCE THE GREATEST INCREASE IN THE POPULATION BY 2022.

POVERTY IS ONE OF THE BIGGEST DRIVERS OF DISPARITY, PARTICULARLY IN LACKAWANNA AND LUZERNE COUNTIES. POVERTY RATES AMONG MINORITY POPULATIONS ARE DOUBLE THE RATES AMONG WHITES. SOCIOECONOMIC DISPARITY CONTRIBUTES TO WORSE HEALTH OUTCOMES. BECAUSE POPULATION COUNTS FOR MINORITY RESIDENTS ACROSS THE REGION ARE LOW, HEALTH DISPARITIES ARE PRIMARILY EVIDENCED BY STATE AND NATIONAL TRENDS.

Rush currently has three SBHCs located within Chicago Public Schools that include: Orr Academy High School (Orr), Richard T. Crane Medical Preparatory High School (Crane), and Simpson Academy for Young Women (Simpson). Crane and Orr have students in grades 9-12, and Simpson serves girls in grades six to 12 that are pregnant, parenting, or both. All three schools have student bodies from underserved populations, and are located in neighborhoods with high poverty levels and hardship. The Rush SBHCs act as safety nets for these vulnerable students. Wide-ranging clinic services are provided by advanced practice nurses, registered nurses, collaborating physicians, and large numbers of Rush's inter-professional students. The services include physicals, immunizations, treatment of injuries, primary care, intermittent care, mental health services, prenatal care, pregnancy prevention programs, heath education programs, and health care for the children of the students. Outcomes of this health care and education collaboration include improved immunization rates, decreased incidence of infectious disease, decreased emergency room usage, detecting and treating illness, healthy baby deliveries, increased access to mental health services, success in pregnancy prevention programs, and students establishing healthy living patterns aimed at chronic disease prevention and improved graduation rates. In FY2020, these health centers provided 3,403 health care encounters to 1,397 students. Adolescent family center The Rush Adolescent Family Center (AFC) has existed for over 46 years. The AFC provides reproductive health care, prenatal care, gynecological care, pregnancy prevention programs, sexually transmitted infection (STI) testing and treatment, and community health education to underserved Chicago area youth. All of AFC's services are provided regardless of income or ability to pay for care. Although AFC draws patients from over 107 Chicago area zip codes, the majority of patients served reside in the Chicago West Side communities of East Garfield Park, West Garfield Park, North Lawndale, Austin, Humboldt Park and the Near West Side. As part of AFC's community education program, staffs regularly travel off-site to Chicago area high schools and middle schools to provide community education on pregnancy prevention, reproductive anatomy, contraception, sexually transmitted infection prevention and reproductive health. AFC also offers free prenatal education classes to pregnant teens and their partners. In FY2020, AFC provided clinic services to 493 youth - in total 2,006 health care encounters - and provided 1,380 minutes of reproductive health education to youth at 4 different schools through community education encounters. In FY2020, Affirm: The Rush Center for Gender, Sexuality and Reproductive Health, housed in the AFC, launched. In FY2020, 279 LGBTQ+ patients worked with Affirm patient navigators who helped them overcome barriers to be connected with inclusive care and services at Rush and in the community. The Road Home Program at the Center for Veterans and Their Families at Rush The Road Home Program provides care for the ""invisible wounds of war"" for veterans and their families. Services for veterans include: an adult mental health clinic that specializes in post-traumatic stress disorder; family and marital services such as support groups; counseling and guidance for parenting; a military sexual trauma clinic; and an Intensive Outpatient Program (IOP). The IOP is a three-week program where veterans receive intensive treatment Monday thru Friday, 8:00am to 5:00pm. For the IOP, veterans are drawn from the local community and region, and are flown in from across the country. Since the IOP launch in January 2016, over 330 veterans have graduated from the program. In addition, in the past year the Road Home Program conducted veteran outreach to 3,960 people within the community (to veterans and their family members, and through veteran service organizations and related community groups). In FY2020, the Road Home Program provided clinical services to 960 veterans. College of Nursing Faculty Practice Program The College of Nursing (CON) has a thirty-year history of providing health care services to underserved individuals, families, and communities at a variety of diverse community practice sites through the CON Faculty Practice Program. These sites are deployed where individuals live, learn, and work and include a wellness and health program for the Children's School at the Lighthouse for the Blind, a women's health clinic, a case management program for chronic medical and mental illness, a work-place health clinic for the working poor and nurse practitioner led primary health care sites. Most recipients of care at the faculty practice sites are uninsured or underinsured and rely on the sites as their main health care source. In addition to the hours of care provided by Rush CON faculty practitioners, Rush nursing students deliver health care and health education services at the various sites. The students' efforts greatly enhance the volume of health services provided. In addition, Rush University nursing, medical, physician assistant, and health systems management students volunteer at these sites developing and delivering health education programs.

Twice a month, Rush student volunteers teach a health topic related to the five diseases to high school students. The content of the interactive health lectures ranges from disease prevention to practical skills such checking blood pressure. The high school students have opportunities to spread their knowledge through 5 + 1 = 20 health fairs at their schools. Health fair activities include body mass index calculations, blood pressure screenings, vision screenings, glucose level checks, referrals, and health education. Health fair participants include families and friends of the students as well as other members of their communities. In FY2020, 5 + 1 = 20 provided health education and screenings to approximately 2,240 community members. Oak Park Hospital Health & Wellness Fair In FY2020, the annual ROPH health and wellness fair provided more than 400 health screenings to participants which include blood pressure, fasting glucose and lipid profile blood tests. Many departments participated by hosting health information booths. These booths were staffed with clinicians who were provided information on diabetes, stroke, cancer, weight management, breast imaging, and more. In addition, primary care doctors from Rush Oak Park Physicians Group were on hand to answer health related questions. A healthy breakfast was provided to attendees. Project Lifestyle Change For the seventh consecutive year, ROPH's project lifestyle change, a group education and support program that informs on pre-diabetes health, continued to make an impact in the community. The program teaches blood glucose monitoring, restricted fat and calorie meal planning, exercise and behavior modification at no charge. Rush Department of Social Work and Community Health The health promotion/disease prevention focus of the Rush Department of Social Work and Community Health (SWACH) provides patients, their families, and community members access to an array of programs that provide support and promote wellness through educational programs, physical activity classes, support groups, and workshops. Rush Generations, a free health affinity membership program of approximately 15,500 members, offers older adults and their caregivers the opportunity to benefit from health and wellness educational programs. Rush Generations offers its members a free quarterly newsletter, monthly e-newsletter, access to community health fairs and screenings, and opportunities to become more active and engaged by joining the Generations volunteer ambassador program. Other SWACH activities included: * Transitional care to support patients and caregivers after hospital stays using the Bridge Model, addressing medical and non-medical issues as part of an interprofessional care team * Outpatient social work care management with social workers integrated into primary and specialty care to assess and address psychosocial issues related to care, using the AIMS Model * Mental health and collaborative care, including psychotherapy, supportive services, and coordination with primary care to support patients 12+ years old who screen positively for depression. SWACH operates the Anne Byron Waud Resource Center and the Tower Resource Center (TRC), which are both open daily to the public. Each center is staffed by a licensed clinical social worker who is available to help with a myriad of issues related to health and chronic health issues that particularly impact adults and caregivers. The Senior Health Insurance Program (SHIP), which provides free options counseling to assist with navigation of Medicare and related benefits. SWACH is also leading the Social Determinants of Health initiative, which identifies, measures, and mitigates the social determinants of health of patients and community members by offering closed-loop referrals to services and resources to alleviate health disparities. SWACH also operates the Center for Health and Social Care Integration (CHaSCI), which provides technical assistance and a peer learning community to support practice and systems change with community-based organizations and health systems across the country. The Center teaches lessons from research and applies them to clinical and community settings, improving how health professionals deliver care and prevent diseases. The Center does this by having its health care provider members work closely together and share information, providing services and collaborating across its five core areas: Research, Older Adult and Family Care, Education, Community Health Equity, and Policy. West Side Walk to Wellness The West Side Walk to Wellness, developed and co-led by Rush medical students, was developed to enhance exercise and walking in our West Side communities, create a sense of engagement, and level of safety to be outside in the community. The program, which lasted eight weeks, engaged 250 unique community members from Rush and the communities we serve. Goal 4: Increase access to care and community services. RCSIP clinics RCSIP Clinics are run by Rush volunteers, more specifically by a physician lead and an interprofessional team of Rush student volunteers. The clinics offer various services to patients such as physical exams, health education, free basic medications, and procedures such as wound care and use referrals to help patients establish primary and/or specialty care relationships that are affordable or available through charity care. Examples of these clinics include: 1. RCSIP Clinic at Franciscan Outreach is located within the Franciscan House homeless shelter for adult men and women.

In addition, the COVID-19 pandemic has increased health-related social needs, exacerbating underlying inequities that have long led to worse health outcomes among black and Latinx communities. The COVID-19 pandemic calls for social services to identify and address social needs, accessible and trauma-informed mental health treatment, health promotion activities that support continued chronic care management during the pandemic and outreach targeted to communities most impacted by the harmful effects. At Rush University System for Health, an integrated academic health system spanning the West Side of Chicago, Oak Park and Aurora, partners from across the institution have worked extensively on many of these issues for years. Together with residents, community leaders, nonprofit organizations and other health care institutions, our goal is to be a catalyst for community health and vitality by dismantling barriers to health, and by promoting health equity both within and outside of Rush. This playbook describes how these partners have come together given the COVID-19 pandemic to align and elevate existing efforts, identify new needs and fill in gaps to best support patients, families and community members in our service areas. Our approach mostly focuses on those particularly impacted by COVID-19, including but not limited to: * Communities of color * Immigrants * Individuals with disabilities * LGBTQ+ individuals * Older adults * People experiencing homelessness The Rush COVID-19 Community Response Playbook shares our approach and materials, as of May 5, 2020, a copy can be obtained at https://www.rush.edu/sites/default/files/2020-09/rush-community-covid-playbook.pdf (THE URL should be typed in as ALL LOWER CASE LETTERS)"

202131359349302593,362174823,"Schedule H, Part II Community Building Activities","Physical improvements and housing Rush has committed to the concept of housing as health, with senior leadership approving a pilot program to house six of our chronically homeless patients in partnership with the Center for Housing and Health, a subsidiary of the AIDS Foundation of Chicago. This pilot follows Housing and Urban Development (HUD) definitions and guidelines and provides both bridge and permanent, supportive housing to individuals in need. Rush has invested substantially into this program and is expanding it in FY20 with the new City of Chicago Flexible Housing Pool. Economic development In FY2020, Rush invested $3.25 million in projects on the West Side through Community Development Financial Institutions including IFF, Chicago Community Loan Fund, Accion, and LISC. Rush also partnered with other hospitals to award a total of $500,000 in small grants to twenty-nine small businesses on the West Side of Chicago. Local purchasing Rush has organizational goals to increase purchasing with vendors from the West Side. Rush has partnered with together Chicago and Chicago anchors for a strong economy to identify and contract with vendors at the hyper-local level. In FY2020, Rush spent $8.4 million doing business with vendors from the Anchor Mission communities. Rush engaged with Concordance Healthcare Solutions, a medical-surgical supply distributor, to locate its distribution center in one of Rush's Anchor Mission (AM) communities and commit to hiring their warehouse staff from the AM communities. In FY2020, Rush spent approximately $800,000 with Concordance Healthcare Solutions on the West Side. Rush also engaged with Fooda for cafeteria services, with a goal of increasing spending in the AM communities. In FY2020, Rush spent approximately $1 million with Fooda AM restaurants. Rush is part of the West Side Anchor Committee with five other hospitals and health systems to share best practices and increase the use of local vendors. Employee efforts Rush is also committed to serving our employees whom we consider as our ""first community"" and have created programs to create financial stability. These include retirement readiness and financial wellness training for employees through Working Credit and Fifth-Third E-bus. Environmental Improvements In FY2020, Rush doubled down on its commitment to the Environment and Environmental Justice initiatives through the hiring of a full-time Sustainability Manager for the Medical Center. Rush understands that in its commitment to improving health, it must also be aware of its environmental footprint. Building off of Rush's recent re-establishment of The Green Team, Rush furthered its commitment this year. In addition, each of the Green Teams have adopted a mission to improve the social and physical well-being of the patients, students, employees, and community we serve through a culture of environmental sustainability. The task force is focused on inbound and outbound environmentally friendly programs through: Energy and water conservation; Reduction of our carbon footprint; Recycling program and waste reduction; Local and sustainable food; Establishing sourcing relationships with environmentally conscious vendors. Rush has also engaged Practice Green Health, which is an advisory service to attain green culture. In FY2020, Rush's new Sustainability Manager focused attention on: * Energy consumption (decreasing our CO2 contributions to climate change) * Water consumption (decreasing our impacts on Lake Michigan and in the Mississippi River watershed, downstream of our wastewater treatment, by contributing less wastewater to the treatment plant) * Waste generation (decreasing the amount of waste we create decreases truck traffic and emissions; decreasing materials sent to landfills that generate methane emissions by identifying new opportunities for reducing/reusing/recycling) Coalition building: West Side United (WSU, westsideunited.org) WSU is a collaborative of 6 health institutions including Rush University Medical Center, Cook County Health, Ann and Robert H. Lurie Children's Hospital, Presence/Amita Health System, Sinai Health System, UI Health, and other healthcare providers, education providers, the faith community, business, government, and residents. This collaborative is working to improve neighborhood health by addressing inequities in healthcare, education, economic vitality and the physical environment using a cross-sector, place-based strategy. The overarching aim is to reduce life expectancy gaps between the Loop and the 10 West Side neighborhoods of focus by 50% by 2030. In March 2020, West Side United announced eleven initiatives: Health and Healthcare * Launch 'Live Healthy West Side' a community health framework that promotes health and well-being around the following two health conditions: hypertension management, and maternal and child health Neighborhood and Physical Environment * Strengthening direct support relationships with food pantries * Launch of a Healthy Food Voucher program * Support three Chicago Public Schools with Nutrition Education standards and policies Economic Vitality * Commitment to impact investing * Local hiring * Local spend dollars * Business Development * Employee Professional Growth Education * High School Internships and College Apprenticeships * Development of community hubs at up to two schools West Side ConnectED Rush continues to partner with the organizations in West Side ConnectED to achieve the goal of improving our efforts on social determinants of health with support from Catholic Charities. The coalition has grown to include Lurie Children's Hospital and enjoys consistent representation by the Illinois Partners for Human Service, a coalition of 800 human rights organizations located in every legislative district throughout Illinois. Efforts continue to be focused on implementing screening about health care access (primary care/insurance), food security, housing/homelessness, utilities, and transportation but have broadened the scope to include each partner's entire hospital per individual institutional strategic goals. The coalition also secured funding to secure a care coordinator to support care management needs, and plans to pilot a comprehensive care coordination model. Community Health Improvement Advocacy Workforce Development The Rush Capital Projects team now reviews contracts for construction and capital projects undertaken by the hospital, and, for the first time, depending on the size of the project, includes goals for Anchor Mission local hiring in the contract language. Rush contributed $2.1 million in salaries to AM residents through June 2020 for capital projects and has spent $1.5 million with AM companies through June 2020 as part of the Joan and Paul Rubschlager Building Project. Rush has also launched an 18-month Medical Assistant Pathway Program (MAPP) for full-time employees in collaboration with four other health system employers, training providers, and funding partners. Three cohorts of MAPP have been launched as of June 2020. In FY2020, the second cohort was launched with five participants and college readiness pathway was launched as a pre-pathway to MAPP with 15 participants. Also, in FY2020, Rush launched the third and fourth cohorts of its patient care technician pathway program with 19 total participants. This program supports underemployed young adults between the ages of 18 and 26 to become patient care technicians (PCT) in partnership with Skills for Chicagoland's Future."

Without the cooperation of the patient in providing appropriate documentation, Rush cannot correctly distinguish patients who meet the defined charity care policies and appropriately categorize those individuals as charity care write-offs. Instead these patient cases can be classified as bad debt write-offs due to a lack of supporting information. This can create situations in which patients can be mistakenly classified as bad debt that could actually be classified as charity care, but cannot be confirmed."

Through utilization of a patient eligibility service the Medical Center is extremely proactive in enrolling patients, who present for service without insurance coverage, for coverage under various state and federal programs. The maintenance of this service for our patients has a significant impact on decreasing the amount of charity care provided. In addition to achieving appropriate, available coverage for our patients' medical services, this eligibility service also obtains eligibility for SSI or SSA benefits for applicable patients. Guiding the patient through this often time-consuming and arduous process is extremely beneficial to the patient, as once SSI/SSA eligibility is approved, the patient will begin receiving a monthly assistance check which provided a benefit well beyond their health care at Rush. To assist the patient in deciding which is the right program for them, RUMC offers the services of financial counselors and billing customer service representatives. These individuals will assist patients in completion of financial application forms, obtaining an estimated cost of anticipated hospital services, providing an explanation and copy of their hospital bill, and notary services.

Rush's patient population is varied in regard to ethnicity, economic status and insurance status, but many on the west side face hardship and are members of more vulnerable populations - racial/ethnic minorities, lower socio-economic status, crowded housing, higher levels of joblessness and less access to education, transportation, and other community resources such as grocery stores and healthcare centers. Rush's defined community, most specifically the West Side of Chicago, while incredibly resilient, faces some of the greatest hardship and health disparities in the city of Chicago - Rush hopes to serve as an anchor to alleviate some of these issues through the empowerment of communities and the wonderful individuals that call the West Side home."

Supporting program information: Rush Education And Career Hub (REACH) The Rush Education and Career Hub extends Rush's thirty-year legacy of support for Chicago school communities. Since 1990, thousands of students from pre-kindergarten to college have participated in science and math enrichment learning experiences. The REACH model provides these offerings and integrates them into a cradle-to-career pathway with a mission of increasing diversity in STEM/health care professions. Our overall goals are: 1) to increase high school graduation rates, college matriculation, interest in health care/STEM careers, and 2) to build skills for the 21st Century workforce, including communication, collaboration, critical thinking, creativity, and leadership. Through enrichment, engagement, skills training, and high quality work-based learning, Rush is preparing underrepresented youth for success in the health care industry. In FY2020, REACH programs served more than 2,500 students, 500 parents, and more than 350 teachers. Rush's dedication to promoting a healthy community has fostered a strong commitment to Supporting the growth and development of our local neighborhoods; including school communities. In FY18, REACH deepened its collaboration with five partner elementary Schools and four high schools with stem and/or healthcare programs. Rush University Medical Center is uniquely situated to increase the diversity of the healthcare workforce; addressing educational opportunity gaps, and cultivating a pipeline of health Professionals focused on reducing health disparities for west side neighborhoods. REACH continues to provide programming across the Pre-K-16 educational continuum through the initiatives highlighted below: Elementary outreach (gr. Pre-k-5) In 1998, reach developed its preschool program to introduce preschool children to Science, math, and literacy skills. Reach later expanded to include primary grades and currently provides education outreach in 6 public and private schools. The goal of the REACH Elementary Initiative is to provide a stimulating environment for the development of science, math, and literacy skills by providing science/STEM labs and materials appropriate for young children. REACH works with educators to facilitate understanding of fundamental science and math concepts, build awareness of health care careers and support student development of inquiry skills by using their natural curiosity to explore their surroundings. In addition to academic enrichment, Rush exposes students and their families to a variety of STEM/health care career pathways to inspire future career plans. REACH believes that early parental involvement is crucial for children to be successful in school and supportive in planning for college and career success. In FY2020, over 2,000 students, 304 teachers, and 344 parents participated in REACH elementary programs. Middle school outreach (gr. 6-8th) In FY2020, REACH continued with two programs targeted for 6th-8th grade students. Vitals for STEM Success is an after-school curriculum enrichment program for middle school students interested in STEM and health care careers. The program consists of three, 10-week sessions on the Rush campus. In addition to STEM learning experiences, the enrichment program includes career exploration, mentoring, and tutoring. Future Ready Learning Lab, supported in part by Michael Reese Health Trust, is an enrichment elective focused on building interest and awareness of careers in the STEM/health care field, increasing sense of self-efficacy, developing 21st Century learning skills and transitioning to high school. The elective is incorporated into the school day and include opportunities for parent and community engagement. The partner schools for this program are Nathaniel Dett Elementary and Washington Irving Elementary Schools. During FY2020, REACH also launched the first middle school chapter of HOSA (Future Health Professionals Student Association) for the state of Illinois. This HOSA Jr chapter was launched in partnership with Nathaniel Dett Elementary and North Grand High School. Interested middle school students completed enrichment activities, and seven students participated in state-level competitions on health care knowledge and career preparatory activities. High school outreach (gr. 9-12) REACH programs for grades 9 through 12 include academic, college and career development. Initiatives include specialized courses, site visits, job shadowing, and summer internships at Rush that expose students to a wide range of health care careers. REACH also supports dual-credit enrollment opportunities, helps students complete college applications, provides mentoring, and more. In FY2020, REACH provided intensive experiences for 250 high school students. During the summer of 2019, Rush provided paid, work-based learning experiences 250 youth across the RUMC and Rush Oak Park campuses. MedSTEM, our signature high school program, is designed to introduce teens to a wide range of clinical and non-clinical health care careers, develop leadership skills and build academic skills. MedSTEM provides pre-internships (Explorers) for rising sophomores, juniors, and internships (Pathways) for rising juniors and seniors. 88% of Pathways Interns and 100% of Explorers earned one or more industry-recognized credentials: CPR, first aid/basic lifesaving, ECG technician By leveraging resources from across Rush University Medical Center, we provided students with comprehensive, engaging experiences including personal development workshops, industry-recognized certifications, and networking with career professionals. College and Beyond The Center for Community Health Equity Scholars program offers a paid, eight-week summer internship at Rush University Medical Center for four highly motivated college juniors and seniors who have a strong interest in research, health disparities, and community relations. The internship mixes workshops and instruction in research methods with field trips to sites that include Cook County Hospital, the Sue Gin Health Center that Rush operates at the Oakley Square mixed-income residential complex, the DuSable Museum of African American History and Garfield Park. Students who complete the internship gain an understanding of historical structural inequities that have an impact on health outcomes; they also learn how to conduct research that engages with community members and develop a team-based research project centered on education equity. College and Career Pathways supports underrepresented young people beyond high school for immersive work-based learning experiences in targeted career paths. The program includes a mix of paid internships and college and career advising - including information about Rush's Physician Assistant Studies program - as well as professional and technical skills training and help finding jobs with STEM or health care employers. Interns learn skills in several Rush University Medical Center departments, including labor and delivery, the surgical ICU, outpatient psychology, and pathology. In FY2020, 26 students each earned over 250 hours of paid, work-based learning experience through the College and Career Pathways program. Malcolm X College Partnership Malcolm X College (MXC) and Rush have a rich, multi-year history of collaboration. The partnership includes hosting students' clinical rotations in nursing, surgical technology, radiologic technology, EMT/paramedic, and respiratory care at Rush University Hospital and providing anatomy labs for MXC health occupations students. Rush also provides guest lecturers and recently began offering a monthly interprofessional lunch and learn series for MXC students and faculty. MXC wants to ensure that its graduates have the knowledge, skills, and professional attributes they will need to function in the health care system, both now and in the future. To help achieve that goal, Rush participates in MXC advisory committees and provides transfer programs for graduates of the MXC radiologic technology and respiratory care programs to allow students the opportunity to obtain a bachelor's degree in their fields. Mini Medical School The RCSIP Mini Medical School is a ten-week program that runs from late September to mid-March for students in fourth and fifth grade, from Chicago Public Schools on Chicago's West Side. The main objective of the program is to expose young students to the health sciences. This program is held at Rush University and includes an orientation, anatomy and physiology lectures, activities on the five major body systems, dissections, homework, and a completion celebration.

These reports can be accessed on the website under Commitment to Community at this link: https://www.mercyone.org/northeastiowa/about-us/community-benefit/commitme nt-to-community Schedule H Part 1 Line 7: Community Benefit amounts are reported using total actual costs per the hospital's managerial accounting system in use, which includes all patient segments including inpatient, outpatient, emergency room, private insurance, Medicaid, Medicare, Medicare HMO, uninsured, and self-pay patients. Medicare is reported using the most recently filed cost report at the time the Annual Report and related community benefit information is published. Amounts are summarized using a software application recommended by the Catholic Health Association in conjunction with the Iowa Hospital Association, because it can provide the information in a format suitable for Schedule H presentation. After the data is entered by the Site Finance Directors, its accuracy is verified by employees who are trained in community benefit reporting, and then approved by the Chief Financial Officer and the President/CEO of the Iowa organization. After amounts are verified and approved, community benefit amounts become finalized. Finally, the information is compiled with the assistance of CBISA software for presentation in IRS Forms 990 Schedule H and Statement of Program Service Accomplishments Part III. The Iowa hospital facilities are not required to report community benefit information to the State of Iowa but do make the information readily available on certain websites and report the information to the Iowa Hospital Association. Schedule H Part 1 Line 7 Column f: Iowa Hospitals follow guidelines established by the Catholic Health Association and the Iowa Hospital Association, who recommend that bad debt expense not be included in community benefit amounts. As a result of this applied methodology, a total amount of $7,918,583 has not been included in the denominator of the calculation that determines the percentages reported on Schedule H Line 7 Column f. In addition to the community benefit described above, MercyOne Northeast Iowa also provides care to Medicare and Medicare HMO patients that is not fully reimbursed by the government. According to the most recently filed Medicare cost report, we provided $12,356,287 in unreimbursed Medicare services. We are not including the gap in Medicare reimbursement in accordance with the Catholic Health Association Community Benefit Guidelines. If we included the Medicare shortfall, our total would be $35,505,458. Schedule H Part 1 Line 7g: In the Iowa region, clinic operations are included as a department of the hospital, Covenant Medical Center, Inc. Clinic operations for the Iowa clinics are included only in the community benefit reporting of charity care, government sponsored health care, and Medicare shortfall. Therefore, costs related to physician clinics are not included in subsidized health services reported on Schedule H Part I Line 7g. Schedule H Part III Section A Lines 1-3: In determining bad debt amounts, the Iowa organizations use a two-level scoring process as follows: First, for any patient account that is categorized as having no insurance, when the amount becomes 60 days overdue or greater, the patient's account is reviewed for financial assistance qualification. If the patient is found to qualify for financial assistance, the necessary steps are taken to apply, and the needed adjustments are made so as to treat as charity care and not as bad debt. A similar scoring process is completed for those patients who do have insurance, but after 120 days or greater, still have not paid the patient responsibility portion. Again, these patient accounts are reviewed for financial assistance, and if they qualify, similar steps are taken to remove from bad debt. As a result of these scoring procedures, Iowa's position is therefore that none of the patients resulting in uncollectible accounts would have qualified as charity care patients as this determination is made at the time of admission, or later with the timing of the scoring procedures mentioned above. Bad debt is therefore only determined for each organization at the time the amount due is truly determined to be uncollectible, after financial assistance has been determined, and after many months of collection efforts. Additionally, the organization followed guidelines established by the Catholic Health Association and the Iowa Hospital Association, who recommends that no bad debt amounts be included in community benefit amounts. For these reasons, Part III Section A Line 3 is reported at zero. Schedule H Part III Section A Line 4: Covenant Medical Center, Inc. is included in the consolidated financial statements of MercyOne Northeast Iowa, Inc. The following is the text of the footnote from the financial statements which addresses the allowance for doubtful accounts. This footnote can be found on page 12 of the attached consolidated financial statements. The Company estimates the transaction price for patients with deductibles and coinsurance and for those who are uninsured and underinsured based on historical experience and current market conditions, using the portfolio approach. The initial estimate of the transaction price is determine by reducing the standard charge by any contractual adjustments, discounts, and implicit price concessions. Subsequent changes to the estimate of the transaction price are generally recorded as adjustments to patient service revenue in the period of the change. Subsequent changes that are determined to be the result of an adverse change in the payor of the patient's ability to pay are recorded as bad debt expense in other expenses in the statement of operations and changes in net assets. Schedule H Part III Section B Line 6-8: Schedule H Part III Section B Line 6 reports allowable costs of care as taken from the most recently filed Medicare cost report available at the time of publishing the Community Benefit Report. The Medicare cost report calculates its allowable total costs based on applicable Medicare regulations. Medicare and Medicaid costs are determined using individual cost center cost-to-charge ratios. This cost to charge ratio is determined using all payer cost and all payer charges. The cost to charge ratio is applied to the actual Medicare and Medicaid charges to determine the Medicare and Medicaid cost. This organization has adopted the cost and charge practices as recommended by the Catholic Health Association and the Iowa Hospital Association, and therefore, does not count any Medicare shortfall numbers in its annual reporting of Community Benefit amounts. Schedule H Part III Section C Line 9b: Iowa organizations follow a policy that outlines all collection practices for patients who are known to qualify for government programs and for our charity care program. We make every attempt to assist the patient in enrolling in government insurance plans or our own charity care program allowing for free or discounted care. If the patient does not qualify for any type of aid or charity care, declines to establish a reasonable payment plan or pay the liability, the patient will be moved into a bad debt status, and the account is sent to a collection agency. This does not occur before the patient has received several notices and a final written warning. Please also see Schedule H Part III Section A Lines 1-4 narrative response. Schedule H Part V Section A and Section C: Affiliates of the Iowa region have defined and reported hospital facilities to include only those bricks and mortar buildings that actually have inpatient beds, in addition to meeting all other criteria under Iowa state law required for hospital licensing. Although there may be other facilities within our system built to hospital specifications, performing hospital-based billing, and conforming to other hospital standards under state law, until there is further guidance from the IRS, these facilities have been reported in Section C, due to their lack of having state certified inpatient beds.

THE ORGANIZATIONS FINANCIAL ASSISTANCE POLICY (""FAP"") EXISTS TO OFFER FINANCIAL ASSISTANCE FOR MEDICALLY NECESSARY CARE TO BOTH UNINSURED AND UNDER-INSURED INDIVIDUALS BASED UPON THEIR ABILITY TO PAY. THE GRANTING OF FINANCIAL ASSISTANCE WILL NOT TAKE INTO ACCOUNT AGE, GENDER, RACE, SOCIAL STATUS, SEXUAL ORIENTATION OR RELIGIOUS AFFILIATION. PATIENTS SEEKING EMERGENCY CARE SHALL BE TREATED WITHOUT REGARD TO ABILITY TO PAY FOR SUCH CARE. AS REFLECTED IN SCHEDULE H, PART V, SECTION B, QUESTION 13, IN ADDITION TO FEDERAL POVERTY GUIDELINES (""FPG"") JHNE USES THE FOLLOWING CRITERIA WHEN DETERMINING A PATIENTS ELIGIBILITY FOR FREE OR DISCOUNTED FINANCIAL ASSISTANCE: - ASSET LEVEL; - MEDICAL INDIGENCY; - INSURANCE STATUS; - UNDERINSURANCE STATUS; AND - RESIDENCY. IN ACCORDANCE WITH THE ORGANIZATIONS FAP, A PATIENT MAY QUALIFY FOR DISCOUNTS ON MEDICAL CARE IF THERE IS NO HEALTH INSURANCE AVAILABLE, OR HAS HEALTH INSURANCE, BUT THAT INSURANCE DOES NOT FULLY COVER THE MEDICAL CARE NEEDED, SUCH AS EXHAUSTED BENEFITS, AND ALL OF THE FOLLOWING APPLY: - THE PATIENT IS NOT ELIGIBLE FOR STATE MEDICAL ASSISTANCE OR OTHER AVAILABLE ASSISTANCE PROGRAMS; - THE PATIENT MEETS THE CRITERIA FOR FINANCIAL ASSISTANCE DESCRIBED IN THIS POLICY, AND - THE PATIENT PROVIDES THE NECESSARY DOCUMENTS AND COMPLETES NECESSARY PAPERWORK. ELIGIBILITY FOR FINANCIAL ASSISTANCE IS BASED UPON FINANCIAL NEED. PATIENTS THAT FALL BELOW 300% OF THE FPL, BASED ON TOTAL HOUSEHOLD INCOME, WITH SUFFICIENT SUPPORTING DOCUMENTATION PROVIDED, WILL RECEIVE A 100% DISCOUNT. PATIENTS AT 300% OR ABOVE, UP TO A MAXIMUM OF 600% OF THE FPL, ARE ELIGIBLE FOR FINANCIAL ASSISTANCE BASED UPON A SLIDING SCALE DISCOUNT. THESE DISCOUNTS ARE APPLIED AGAINST THE MEDICARE FEE-FOR-SERVICE RATES IN PLACE AT TIME OF DETERMINATION. ELIGIBILITY FOR FINANCIAL ASSISTANCE IS ALSO DETERMINED BY THE PATIENTS OR GUARANTORS ABILITY TO PAY AFTER ALL INSURANCE HAS BEEN UTILIZED OR LIQUID RESOURCES EXHAUSTED (EXCLUDING RETIREMENT FUNDS). JHNE WILL NOT CONSIDER THE PATIENTS HOUSE, CAR, RETIREMENT ACCOUNTS, AND OTHER ""NON-LIQUID"" ASSETS. HOWEVER, IT IS RECOGNIZED THAT THERE IS A SMALL PERCENT OF THE UNINSURED PATIENT POPULATION THAT HAS SUBSTANTIAL ASSETS AND COULD EASILY AFFORD TO PAY FOR HEALTHCARE SERVICES, BUT WHOM, BECAUSE OF HAVING TAX-EXEMPT INCOME, WILL NOT HAVE INCOME REFLECTED ON A TAX RETURN. SUCH INDIVIDUALS MAY NOT QUALIFY FOR FINANCIAL ASSISTANCE. FOR UNINSURED PATIENTS, THERE IS AN AUTOMATIC INITIAL DISCOUNT WHICH SHALL EQUATE TO 50% OFF TOTAL CHARGES FOR SERVICES RENDERED. IN ADDITION, FOR EMERGENCY DEPARTMENT AND OBSERVATION SERVICES FOR THOSE TREATED AND RELEASED (NOT ADMITTED AS INPATIENT) THERE WILL BE A MAXIMUM LIABILITY OF $1,600. FOR LABORATORY SERVICES, THERE IS A FURTHER DISCOUNT THAT IS GENERALLY GREATER THAN 50% OFF CHARGES. A PATIENT UNABLE TO PAY THE UNINSURED RATE IS ELIGIBLE TO APPLY FOR FINANCIAL ASSISTANCE."

202031959349301303,230596940,"SCHEDULE H, PART III, LINE 8","MEDICARE COSTS WERE DERIVED FROM THE MEDICARE COST REPORT FILED BY THE ORGANIZATION. THE ORGANIZATION FEELS THAT MEDICARE UNDERPAYMENTS (SHORTFALL) AND BAD DEBT ARE COMMUNITY BENEFIT AND ASSOCIATED COSTS ARE INCLUDABLE ON THE FORM 990, SCHEDULE H, PART I. AS OUTLINED MORE FULLY BELOW THE ORGANIZATION BELIEVES THAT THESE SERVICES AND RELATED COSTS PROMOTE THE HEALTH OF THE COMMUNITY AS A WHOLE AND ARE RENDERED IN CONJUNCTION WITH THE ORGANIZATION'S CHARITABLE TAX-EXEMPT PURPOSES AND MISSION IN PROVIDING MEDICALLY NECESSARY HEALTHCARE SERVICES TO ALL INDIVIDUALS IN A NON-DISCRIMINATORY MANNER WITHOUT REGARD TO RACE, COLOR, CREED, SEX, NATIONAL ORIGIN OR ABILITY TO PAY AND CONSISTENT WITH THE COMMUNITY BENEFIT STANDARD PROMULGATED BY THE INTERNAL REVENUE SERVICE (""IRS""). THE COMMUNITY BENEFIT STANDARD IS THE CURRENT STANDARD FOR A HOSPITAL FOR RECOGNITION AS A TAX-EXEMPT AND CHARITABLE ORGANIZATION UNDER INTERNAL REVENUE CODE (""IRC"") 501(C)(3). THE ORGANIZATION IS RECOGNIZED AS A TAX-EXEMPT ENTITY AND CHARITABLE ORGANIZATION UNDER 501(C)(3) OF THE IRC. ALTHOUGH THERE IS NO DEFINITION IN THE TAX CODE FOR THE TERM ""CHARITABLE"", A REGULATION PROMULGATED BY THE DEPARTMENT OF THE TREASURY PROVIDES SOME GUIDANCE AND STATES THAT ""[T]HE TERM CHARITABLE IS USED IN 501(C)(3) IN ITS GENERALLY ACCEPTED LEGAL SENSE,PROVIDES EXAMPLES OF CHARITABLE PURPOSES, INCLUDING THE RELIEF OF THE POOR OR UNPRIVILEGED; THE PROMOTION OF SOCIAL WELFARE; AND THE ADVANCEMENT OF EDUCATION, RELIGION, AND SCIENCE. NOTE: IT DOES NOT EXPLICITLY ADDRESS THE ACTIVITIES OF HOSPITALS. IN THE ABSENCE OF EXPLICIT STATUTORY OR REGULATORY REQUIREMENTS APPLYING THE TERM ""CHARITABLE"" TO HOSPITALS, IT HAS BEEN LEFT TO THE IRS TO DETERMINE THE CRITERIA HOSPITALS MUST MEET TO QUALIFY AS IRC 501(C)(3) CHARITABLE ORGANIZATIONS. THE ORIGINAL STANDARD WAS KNOWN AS THE CHARITY CARE STANDARD. THIS STANDARD WAS REPLACED BY THE IRS WITH THE COMMUNITY BENEFIT STANDARD WHICH IS THE CURRENT STANDARD. CHARITY CARE STANDARD IN 1956, THE IRS ISSUED REVENUE RULING 56-185, WHICH ADDRESSED THE REQUIREMENTS HOSPITALS NEEDED TO MEET IN ORDER TO QUALIFY FOR IRC 501(C)(3) STATUS. ONE OF THESE REQUIREMENTS IS KNOWN AS THE ""CHARITY CARE STANDARD."" UNDER THE STANDARD, A HOSPITAL HAD TO PROVIDE, TO THE EXTENT OF ITS FINANCIAL ABILITY, FREE OR REDUCED-COST CARE TO PATIENTS UNABLE TO PAY FOR IT. A HOSPITAL THAT EXPECTED FULL PAYMENT DID NOT, ACCORDING TO THE RULING, PROVIDE CHARITY CARE BASED ON THE FACT THAT SOME PATIENTS ULTIMATELY FAILED TO PAY. THE RULING EMPHASIZED THAT A LOW LEVEL OF CHARITY CARE DID NOT NECESSARILY MEAN THAT A HOSPITAL HAD FAILED TO MEET THE REQUIREMENT SINCE THAT LEVEL COULD REFLECT ITS FINANCIAL ABILITY TO PROVIDE SUCH CARE. THE RULING ALSO NOTED THAT PUBLICLY SUPPORTED COMMUNITY HOSPITALS WOULD NORMALLY QUALIFY AS CHARITABLE ORGANIZATIONS BECAUSE THEY SERVE THE ENTIRE COMMUNITY AND A LOW LEVEL OF CHARITY CARE WOULD NOT AFFECT A HOSPITAL'S EXEMPT STATUS IF IT WAS DUE TO THE SURROUNDING COMMUNITY'S LACK OF CHARITABLE DEMANDS. COMMUNITY BENEFIT STANDARD IN 1969, THE IRS ISSUED REVENUE RULING 69-545, WHICH ""REMOVE[D]"" FROM REVENUE RULING 56-185 ""THE REQUIREMENTS RELATING TO CARING FOR PATIENTS WITHOUT CHARGE OR AT RATES BELOW COST."" UNDER THE STANDARD DEVELOPED IN REVENUE RULING 69-545, WHICH IS KNOWN AS THE ""COMMUNITY BENEFIT STANDARD,"" HOSPITALS ARE JUDGED ON WHETHER THEY PROMOTE THE HEALTH OF A BROAD CLASS OF INDIVIDUALS IN THE COMMUNITY. THE RULING INVOLVED A HOSPITAL THAT ONLY ADMITTED INDIVIDUALS WHO COULD PAY FOR THE SERVICES (BY THEMSELVES, PRIVATE INSURANCE, OR PUBLIC PROGRAMS SUCH AS MEDICARE), BUT OPERATED A FULL-TIME EMERGENCY ROOM THAT WAS OPEN TO EVERYONE. THE IRS RULED THAT THE HOSPITAL QUALIFIED AS A CHARITABLE ORGANIZATION BECAUSE IT PROMOTED THE HEALTH OF PEOPLE IN ITS COMMUNITY. THE IRS REASONED THAT BECAUSE THE PROMOTION OF HEALTH WAS A CHARITABLE PURPOSE ACCORDING TO THE GENERAL LAW OF CHARITY, IT FELL WITHIN THE ""GENERALLY ACCEPTED LEGAL SENSE"" OF THE TERM ""CHARITABLE,"" AS REQUIRED BY TREAS. REG. 1.501(C)(3)-1(D)(2). THE IRS RULING STATED THAT THE PROMOTION OF HEALTH, LIKE THE RELIEF OF POVERTY AND THE ADVANCEMENT OF EDUCATION AND RELIGION, IS ONE OF THE PURPOSES IN THE GENERAL LAW OF CHARITY THAT IS DEEMED BENEFICIAL TO THE COMMUNITY AS A WHOLE EVEN THOUGH THE CLASS OF BENEFICIARIES ELIGIBLE TO RECEIVE A DIRECT BENEFIT FROM ITS ACTIVITIES DOES NOT INCLUDE ALL MEMBERS OF THE COMMUNITY, SUCH AS INDIGENT MEMBERS OF THE COMMUNITY, PROVIDED THAT THE CLASS IS NOT SO SMALL THAT ITS RELIEF IS NOT OF BENEFIT TO THE COMMUNITY. THE IRS CONCLUDED THAT THE HOSPITAL WAS ""PROMOTING THE HEALTH OF A CLASS OF PERSONS THAT IS BROAD ENOUGH TO BENEFIT THE COMMUNITY"" BECAUSE ITS EMERGENCY ROOM WAS OPEN TO ALL AND IT PROVIDED CARE TO EVERYONE WHO COULD PAY, WHETHER DIRECTLY OR THROUGH THIRD-PARTY REIMBURSEMENT. OTHER CHARACTERISTICS OF THE HOSPITAL THAT THE IRS HIGHLIGHTED INCLUDED THE FOLLOWING: ITS SURPLUS FUNDS WERE USED TO IMPROVE PATIENT CARE, EXPAND HOSPITAL FACILITIES, AND ADVANCE MEDICAL TRAINING, EDUCATION, AND RESEARCH; IT WAS CONTROLLED BY A BOARD OF TRUSTEES THAT CONSISTED OF INDEPENDENT CIVIC LEADERS; AND HOSPITAL MEDICAL STAFF PRIVILEGES WERE AVAILABLE TO ALL QUALIFIED PHYSICIANS. THE AMERICAN HOSPITAL ASSOCIATION (""AHA"") FEELS THAT MEDICARE UNDERPAYMENTS (SHORTFALL) AND BAD DEBT ARE COMMUNITY BENEFIT AND THUS INCLUDABLE ON THE FORM 990, SCHEDULE H, PART I. THIS ORGANIZATION AGREES WITH THE AHA POSITION. AS OUTLINED IN THE AHA LETTER TO THE IRS DATED AUGUST 21, 2007 WITH RESPECT TO THE FIRST PUBLISHED DRAFT OF THE NEW FORM 990 AND SCHEDULE H, THE AHA FELT THAT THE IRS SHOULD INCORPORATE THE FULL VALUE OF THE COMMUNITY BENEFIT THAT HOSPITALS PROVIDE BY COUNTING MEDICARE UNDERPAYMENTS (SHORTFALL) AND BAD DEBT AS QUANTIFIABLE COMMUNITY BENEFIT FOR THE FOLLOWING REASONS: - PROVIDING CARE FOR THE ELDERLY AND SERVING MEDICARE PATIENTS IS AN ESSENTIAL PART OF THE COMMUNITY BENEFIT STANDARD. - MEDICARE, LIKE MEDICAID, DOES NOT PAY THE FULL COST OF CARE. RECENTLY, MEDICARE REIMBURSES HOSPITALS ONLY 92 CENTS FOR EVERY DOLLAR THEY SPEND TO TAKE CARE OF MEDICARE PATIENTS. THE MEDICARE PAYMENT ADVISORY COMMISSION (""MEDPAC"") IN ITS MARCH 2007 REPORT TO CONGRESS CAUTIONED THAT UNDERPAYMENT WILL GET EVEN WORSE, WITH MARGINS REACHING A 10-YEAR LOW AT NEGATIVE 5.4 PERCENT. - MANY MEDICARE BENEFICIARIES, LIKE THEIR MEDICAID COUNTERPARTS, ARE POOR. MORE THAN 46 PERCENT OF MEDICARE SPENDING IS FOR BENEFICIARIES WHOSE INCOME IS BELOW 200 PERCENT OF THE FEDERAL POVERTY LEVEL. MANY OF THOSE MEDICARE BENEFICIARIES ARE ALSO ELIGIBLE FOR MEDICAID -- SO CALLED ELIGIBLES."" THERE IS EVERY COMPELLING PUBLIC POLICY REASON TO TREAT MEDICARE AND MEDICAID UNDERPAYMENTS SIMILARLY FOR PURPOSES OF A HOSPITAL'S COMMUNITY BENEFIT AND INCLUDE THESE COSTS ON FORM 990, SCHEDULE H, PART I. MEDICARE UNDERPAYMENT MUST BE SHOULDERED BY THE HOSPITAL IN ORDER TO CONTINUE TREATING THE COMMUNITY'S ELDERLY AND POOR. THESE UNDERPAYMENTS REPRESENT A REAL COST OF SERVING THE COMMUNITY AND SHOULD COUNT AS A QUANTIFIABLE COMMUNITY BENEFIT. BOTH THE AHA AND THIS ORGANIZATION ALSO FEEL THAT PATIENT BAD DEBT IS A COMMUNITY BENEFIT AND THUS INCLUDABLE ON THE FORM 990, SCHEDULE H, PART I. THERE ARE COMPELLING REASONS THAT PATIENT BAD DEBT SHOULD BE COUNTED AS QUANTIFIABLE COMMUNITY BENEFIT AS FOLLOWS: - A SIGNIFICANT MAJORITY OF BAD DEBT IS ATTRIBUTABLE TO LOW-INCOME PATIENTS, WHO, FOR MANY REASONS, DECLINE TO COMPLETE THE FORMS REQUIRED TO ESTABLISH ELIGIBILITY FOR HOSPITALS' CHARITY CARE OR FINANCIAL ASSISTANCE PROGRAMS. A 2006 CONGRESSIONAL BUDGET OFFICE (""CBO"") REPORT, NONPROFIT HOSPITALS AND THE PROVISION OF COMMUNITY BENEFITS, CITED TWO STUDIES INDICATING THAT ""THE GREAT MAJORITY OF BAD DEBT WAS ATTRIBUTABLE TO PATIENTS WITH INCOMES BELOW 200% OF THE FEDERAL POVERTY LINE."" - THE REPORT ALSO NOTED THAT A SUBSTANTIAL PORTION OF BAD DEBT IS PENDING CHARITY CARE. UNLIKE BAD DEBT IN OTHER INDUSTRIES, HOSPITAL BAD DEBT IS COMPLICATED BY THE FACT THAT HOSPITALS FOLLOW THEIR MISSION TO THE COMMUNITY AND TREAT EVERY PATIENT THAT COMES THROUGH THEIR EMERGENCY DEPARTMENT, REGARDLESS OF ABILITY TO PAY. PATIENTS WHO HAVE OUTSTANDING BILLS ARE NOT TURNED AWAY, UNLIKE OTHER INDUSTRIES. BAD DEBT IS FURTHER COMPLICATED BY THE AUDITING INDUSTRY'S STANDARDS ON REPORTING CHARITY CARE. MANY PATIENTS CANNOT OR DO NOT PROVIDE THE NECESSARY, EXTENSIVE DOCUMENTATION REQUIRED TO BE DEEMED CHARITY CARE BY AUDITORS. AS A RESULT, ROUGHLY 10% OF BAD DEBT IS PENDING CHARITY CARE. - THE CBO CONCLUDED THAT ITS FINDINGS ""SUPPORT THE VALIDITY OF THE USE OF UNCOMPENSATED CARE [BAD DEBT AND CHARITY CARE] AS A MEASURE OF COMMUNITY BENEFITS"" ASSUMING THE FINDINGS ARE GENERALIZABLE NATIONWIDE; THE EXPERIENCE OF HOSPITALS AROUND THE NATION REINFORCES THAT THEY ARE GENERALIZABLE. AS OUTLINED BY THE AHA, DESPITE THE HOSPITAL'S BEST EFFORTS AND DUE DILIGENCE, PATIENT BAD DEBT IS A PART OF THE HOSPITAL'S MISSION AND CHARITABLE PURPOSES. BAD DEBT REPRESENTS"

IN ORDER TO SECURE REIMBURSEMENT OF COSTS FOR SERVICES PROVIDED, EVERY EFFORT IS MADE TO ASSIST PATIENTS IN OBTAINING INSURANCE COVERAGE THROUGH MEDICAL ASSISTANCE (MA), CHILDREN'S HEALTH INSURANCE PROGRAM (CHIP) OR OTHER FEDERAL, STATE, OR CITY CARE COVERAGE SOURCES. JHNE PROVIDES FINANCIAL ASSISTANCE TO THOSE PATIENTS WHO ARE UNABLE TO PAY BASED UPON THE ELIGIBILITY CRITERIA INCLUDED IN THEIR FINANCIAL ASSISTANCE POLICY. BILLING & COLLECTION EFFORTS ---------------------------- WHILE QUALIFICATION FOR FINANCIAL ASSISTANCE IS IDEALLY DETERMINED PRIOR TO, OR AT THE TIME OF SERVICE, JHNE CONTINUES TO REVIEW SUCH DETERMINATIONS AS OTHER FINANCIAL RESOURCES ARE DISCOVERED DURING THE BILLING AND COLLECTION PROCESS. AFTER AN UNINSURED OR UNDER-INSURED PATIENT'S ACCOUNT IS REDUCED TO THE UNINSURED DISCOUNT OR THE FINANCIAL ASSISTANCE DISCOUNT RATE, WHICHEVER IS APPLICABLE, THE PATIENT IS RESPONSIBLE FOR THE REMAINDER OF ANY OUTSTANDING PATIENT BALANCES. PATIENTS WILL RECEIVE AN INITIAL STATEMENT INDICATING THEIR BALANCE DUE ALONG WITH INFORMATION REGARDING THE AVAILABILITY OF FINANCIAL ASSISTANCE AND WHO TO CONTACT. SELF-PAY BALANCES GO THROUGH A PRE-COLLECTION AGENCY PLACEMENT PROCESS THAT MAY ENTAIL THE MAILING OF STATEMENTS OR LETTERS AND/OR PHONE CALLS IN ORDER TO COLLECT PAYMENT ON OPEN BALANCES. ONCE OPEN BALANCE ACCOUNTS COMPLETE THE PRE-COLLECTION DUNNING CYCLE, (120 DAYS OR MORE) WITH NO PAYMENT OR PROOF OF ELIGIBILITY FOR FINANCIAL ASSISTANCE OR OTHER PROGRAMS, THE ACCOUNTS WILL BE TRANSFERRED TO A PROFESSIONAL COLLECTION AGENCY. IF A FINANCIAL ASSISTANCE APPLICATION AND APPROPRIATE SUPPORTING DOCUMENTS HAVE BEEN SUBMITTED AND A DECISION IS PENDING, THE ACCOUNT WILL BE HELD FROM AGENCY PLACEMENT. IN SOME CASES, A PATIENT ELIGIBLE FOR FINANCIAL ASSISTANCE MAY NOT HAVE BEEN IDENTIFIED PRIOR TO SENDING THE ACCOUNT TO AN EXTERNAL COLLECTION AGENCY. EACH AGENCY WILL BE MADE AWARE OF THE FINANCIAL ASSISTANCE POLICY AND WILL WORK WITH THE PROVIDER TO ASCERTAIN PATIENT ELIGIBILITY. EXTRAORDINARY COLLECTION ACTIONS (""ECAS"") WILL NOT BE UNDERTAKEN DURING THE INITIAL NOTIFICATION PERIOD OF THE 120 DAYS FROM THE FIRST POST-DISCHARGE BILLING STATEMENT AND UNTIL SUCH TIME AS A 30 DAY INITIATION OF ECA NOTICE HAS BEEN SENT TO THE INDIVIDUAL.

IF THE PATIENT SUBMITS A FINANCIAL ASSISTANCE APPLICATION, JHNE WILL SUSPEND ANY ECAS UNTIL THE PATIENTS FINANCIAL ASSISTANCE ELIGIBILITY IS DETERMINED AND THE PATIENT IS INFORMED OF THEIR ELIGIBILITY. IF A PATIENT ACCOUNT IS REFERRED TO AN OUTSIDE AGENCY, THAT AGENCY MUST FIRST AGREE TO ABIDE BY AHS FINANCIAL ASSISTANCE POLICY IN RELATION TO ITS COLLECTION EFFORTS. NO EXTERNAL COLLECTION AGENCY ARE PERMITTED TO ENGAGE IN ECAS UNLESS AUTHORIZED BY AH. AFTER THE ABOVE-DESCRIBED STEPS HAVE BEEN TAKEN, AH MAY USE ECAS WITH THE RESPECT TO THE PATIENT ACCOUNT OF AN UNINSURED OR UNDER-INSURED AND MAY FURTHER CONSIDER CREDIT BUREAU REPORTING AND/OR LEGAL ACTION AS APPROPRIATE. AHS GENERAL COUNSEL IS REQUIRED TO APPROVE ALL LAWSUITS PRIOR TO THE ECA COMMENCING. FINAL AUTHORITY FOR DETERMINING THAT AH HAS MADE ADEQUATE ATTEMPTS TO INFORM A PATIENT OF THE FINANCIAL ASSISTANCE POLICY, AND THUS MAY INITIATE THE USE ECAS, RESTS WITH THE ORGANIZATIONS VICE PRESIDENT DIRECTOR OF REVENUE CYCLE OPERATIONS."

202141349349300814,230465970,"Part III, Line 2 - Methodology Used To Estimate Bad Debt Expense",The number was calculated using the cost to charge ratio factor applied against actual patient bad debt write-offs. These numbers are included after all efforts have been exhausted to determine if the patient meets our charity care write-off policy based on federal poverty levels.
202141349349300814,230465970,"Part III, Line 3 - Methodology of Estimated Amount & Rationale for Including in Community Benefit",The estimate of bad debt attributable to charity care policy was calculated by dividing the bad debt amount that was originally coded bad debt but later found to qualify as charity care by the amount coded to the charity care write-off codes. This ratio is applied to the bad debt cost factor expense.
202141349349300814,230465970,"Part III, Line 4 - Bad Debt Expense",The Company provides an allowance for doubtful accounts for estimated losses resulting from the unwillingness or inability of patients to make payments for services. The allowance is determined by analyzing specific amounts and historical data and trends. Patient accounts receivable are charged off against the allowance for doubtful accounts when management determines that recovery is unlikely and the Company ceases collection efforts. Losses have been consistent with management's expectations in all material respects.
202141349349300814,230465970,"Part III, Line 8 - Explanation Of Shortfall As Community Benefit",Chambersburg Hospital maintains records to identify and monitor the level of charity care and community service it provides. These records include the amount of charges forgone based on established rates for services and supplies furnished under its charity care and community service policies and the estimated cost of those services. Payments from Medicare are generally less than Chambersburg Hospital's costs of providing the service.
202141349349300814,230465970,"Part VI, Line 2 - Needs Assessment","WellSpan Summit Health and its entities have a long history of working to better understand and respond to the health and healthcare needs of our communities and the populations we serve. Throughout the last two decades, Summit Health has made great changes to programs and services based on the findings of the CHNAs conducted in 2008, 2012, 2015 and 2018. The data played a large role in the overall strategic planning process for Summit Health.The Patient Protection and Affordable Care Act of 2010 required non-profit hospitals to conduct community health needs assessments every three years. Summit Health, and its affiliates, Chambersburg Hospital and Waynesboro Hospital, completed a CHNA report and CHIP in 2015. The 2015 CHNA report identified community health priorities of access to care; obesity, nutrition, and physical activity; mental health, substance use, and prevention; educational and community- based engagement; early childhood education; and adolescent health. Based on the data, plans were created to address the identified needs by developing education, screenings, recruitment, partnerships, and needed infrastructure.The programs helped community members gain access to needed prescriptions, primary care providers and specialists. New facilities were constructed to offer the care the community needed. Free screenings, camps and classes were put into motion and awareness was created through advertising, speaking events, health fairs, and social media. Several grants were awarded to community non- profits through Summit Endowment whose projects address key health priorities of Franklin County. While many of the goals were accomplished, others went unmet. It became clear, to be more effective, Summit Health needed to further work with community partners to determine the health needs and key priorities of the community and to work together to develop strategies to address them, a process that is constantly evolving The 2018 CHNA was developed utilizing consulting support and guidance through a contract with the Floyd Institute for Public Policy at Franklin and Marshall College. Dr. Berwood Yost, Institute Director and Project Lead has an extensive background conducting and analyzing community and corporate surveys and was integral to the prior CHNA conducted in 2015. The Summit Health Community Services team facilitated planning and collaboration with community stakeholders who determined the survey questions to be asked of the community; discussed data collection methodology, including sample size and method of obtaining data; reviewed the raw data and supporting charts/ graphs; identified potential community health priorities, and; developed the process by which results and priorities were to be shared with the community. The telephone survey was conducted by staff of the Floyd Institute for Public Policy at Franklin and Marshall College with 506 adult residents throughout Franklin County completing responses.WellSpan Health held a meeting of the Healthy Franklin County leadership team on April 15, 2019. The three primary goals of the forum were to explain the CHNA process and the role of community stakeholders, present the analytic framework and preliminary community health data included in this summary, and gather input from community stakeholders, particularly those with public health expertise and individuals and organizations serving medically underserved, low-income, and minority populations in Franklin County, about community health needs and community resources. After a brief presentation of community health data, including demographics, social determinants such as education and income, health behaviors, and health outcomes, attendees answered three specific questions: what are the most important health needs in our community? How important is addressing this need to our communitys overall health and well-being? How likely is it that our community could implement the changes needed to address this problem?Four working groups then created a final list of 35 distinct health needs, which were ranked. Based on scope, severity, and community perceptions of severity and potential impact, and considering the community initiatives taken since 2015, Franklin Countys most significant needs focus on two social determinants and two behavioral health priorities: Establishing and maintaining the basic conditions that support health, including, access to care, family-sustaining incomes, accessible transportation, reduced stress, and affordable and quality housingEstablishing and maintaining systems that assure that children and families have access to high quality educational opportunities throughout the lifespanSupporting improved mental health including reducing and treating substance useSupporting active living, healthy eating, and less obesityThe identified priorities and associated data were subsequently presented to the WellSpan-Chambersburg and Waynesboro Hospital Boards for their adoption. Board members discussed the data and identified priorities within the context of existing staffing and financial resources, current and future entity initiatives, and community partnership opportunities to address systemic community change. The final CHNA report, along with the WellSpan Summit Community Health Improvement Plan (CHIP) was presented in September 2019 to the Summit Health Board for their review and approval. This information is included in the 2018 Community Health Needs Assessment Summary Report available at www.wellspan.org."
202141349349300814,230465970,"Part VI, Line 5 - Promotion of Community Health","As a charitable, community-based healthcare organization, our commitment to improving the lives and well-being of the people and communities we serve is carried out every day. Our Community Health Improvement Plan framework is constructed with Healthy People 2020 Leading Health Indicators and objectives. Further, our work at the local level aligns with similar goals and objectives in the 2017 Pennsylvania Department of Healths State Health Improvement Plan. Over the last three years, Summit Health provided over $101 million of charity care to the community. The Chambersburg Hospital Prescription Assistance Program reached 60 individuals (20-FY17, 26 FY18, 14 July 1, 2018-March 18, 2019). This program helps patients who cant afford their prescription drugs. Below are a few examples of the work accomplished in the various priority areas since 2016. Often, we benefited from strong partnership with other community organizations. The impact of innovative thinking, and leveraging scarce resources is not only profound, it is smart. And, although several activities were planned between March and June 2020, our focus and methodology came to an abrupt halt. The beginning of our COVID-19 facing work follows, as well as Pre-COVID-19 programs and services. The COVID-19 PandemicEducation Resources Campaign: During May 2020, 2,050 individuals were engaged with COVID-19 mitigation education materials. 550 packets were distributed to Hispanic grocery stores, the Chambersburg Hispanic American Center and through the Chambersburg School District and churches. The COVID-19 Pandemic--Mask Campaign: Between March and June 2020, 1,304 individuals were provided masks via Community Services team members. 872 of those masks were received by Franklin County Housing Authority residents. The COVID-19 PandemicHealthy Behaviors at Home Campaign: During MarchApril 2020, 1,151 encounters were recorded virtually via the Healthy Franklin County website and Facebook. Waynesboro Hospital Health Fair - 1,687 individuals attended this annual event on March 5, 2020. 587 individuals completed blood work screening; 209 screenings for Bone Density were conducted with 66 identified as having low bone density results; 178 individuals had BP screening; 52 received Diabetic Foot Screening; 457 received Grip Strength screening; 61 received simple lung function; 228 completed In-body testing; 98 completed eye screenings; 14 children completed eye screenings. School-Based Clinic - Keystone Health, the Federally Qualified Health Center (FQHC) serving Franklin County, established a school-based clinic at the Chambersburg Area Senior High School in the fall of 2016 and has seen over 2400 students since it opened. As the FQHC, Keystone Health has worked with its Navigators to increase access to health insurance by assisting 363 individuals to sign up for Childrens Health Insurance Program (CHIP), 2345 sign up for Medicaid and 1662 sign up for the Marketplace (1580 enrolled in the Marketplace). Keystone Navigators attended over 130 events to reach uninsured individuals and assisted over 13,000 clients. Creating and supporting careers in healthcare are essential to providing quality healthcare. Greencastle -Antrim Endowment, a component of Summit Health Endowment, a funding mechanism which supports programs aligned with the CHNA priorities. From 2017-2020, $102,000 were awarded via 57 college scholarships to Greencastle-Antrim high school students pursuing a career in healthcare. 16 pre-med students participated in a summer work experience at Summit Health and 12 medical students participated in a resident internship in the Emergency Room at Summit Health. Summit Physician Services established a work group, created a plan and received funding from Summit Endowment to establish a community health worker program in 2017 to serve vulnerable, low-resourced seniors. This grant supports two Community Health Workers, who serve as liaisons between health and social services, and the community, to facilitate access to services. In 2018, the workers focused on targeted populations in the community, specifically residents of the Towers of Falling Spring in Chambersburg and diabetic patients with HgA1C greater than 9 percent. In 2019, the program expanded services to the Cottages, a senior-living apartment complex in Shippensburg. Both Keystone Health and Summit Health providers are using health risk assessments to collect data to better understand and act on their patients social determinants of health. Keystone Health adopted and implemented a plan to reach linguistically isolated individuals which is reviewed annually. Summit Community Services supports Healthy Communities Partnership of Greater Franklin County in their coordination of Chambersburg Cares, a community-wide effort to engage community members and aligns resources, to promote healthy youth behaviors and reduce risk factors. Chambersburg Cares uses a data-driven process and the Communities That Care model. The group determines risks and root causes, working together to target the prioritized risks through evidence-based programs in schools and other community organizations. The Healthy Franklin County Leadership committee formed an ad hoc diversity, inclusion and discrimination committee in the fall of 2017 as a result of heightened racial tensions occurring nationally which also emerged locally. The ad hoc committee conducted an environmental scan to see how these issues were being addressed in the community and to gain a better understanding of what the committees role could be in addressing them. The research done by the committee uncovered the connection between the Social Determinants of Health (SDOH) and health equity. As a result, the Healthy Franklin County Leadership committee determined that it and its partners should take steps to address the SDOH more intentionally with their work. Healthy Franklin County coordinated a Public Health 101 Training which focused on the SDOH in June 2018. To gain more understanding about the SDOH in Franklin County, a SDOH module was included in the primary telephone survey conducted by Franklin and Marshall Center for Opinion Research as part of the 2018 Community Health Needs Assessment (CHNA). During the same time, several grass roots groups have emerged in the community to champion the need for more diversity and inclusion training, increase the awareness and acceptance of the LGBTQ+ and the importance of racial reconciliation. The Healthy Franklin County Leadership committee will evaluate the results from the 2018 CHNA and determine next steps as to how to address health equity, systemic issues related to discrimination, racism and oppression and the SDOH in the Community Health Improvement Plan (CHIP) over the next 3 years. Critical to the systems change required to increase the proportion of children who are ready for school in all five domains of healthy development, is cross-sector collaboration. The United Way of Franklin County formed the Early Childhood Partnership (ECP) in 2013 to start this process with early childhood providers and intervention service providers. Over the last three years, the ECP convened 16 meetings which strengthened relationships, increased awareness of services in Franklin County and fostered new initiatives, like the annual Early Childhood Expo, which in 2019 changed its name to Learn and Play Day with United Way. In August, 2019, the Chambersburg Police Department, invited various community partners to participate in this nationally recognized community event. Summit Community Services team members engaged 266 individuals, during a block party event in downtown Chambersburg. An additional 24 children experienced the Born Learning Trail. In 2018, a local group of community leaders formed Hope From the Start to spark an initiative to focus on children pre-natal to age 3. On June 15, 2018, the group organized a free community event called Our Babies, Our Future: The Science Behind Early Childhood Education for Children and Families. Dr. Brenda Jones Harden, nationally renowned early childhood expert and professor at the University of Maryland, College Park, and the past board president of Zero to Three, presented research everyone needs to know about the first years of life. A task force emerged from this effort called Hope From The Start, which formally came under Healthy Franklin County in the fall of 2018. The task force created an action plan to improve systems of care, establish family centers and to provide parenting classes. The ultimate goals of Hope From the Start are to increase the proportion of children who are ready for school in all five domains of healthy development: physical development, social-emotional development, approaches to learning, language, and cognitive development. One of the challenges uncovered by the Hope From the Start committee in assessing school readiness is the lack of a standardized tool in all six school districts i"

202141349349300814,230465970,Part VI - Additional Information,"Part VI Line 5 - Promotion of Community Health (continued) During 2019, staff planned and implemented Parent Cafs an evidence-based approach to supporting parents and helping guide them through challenging parenting scenarios with peer engaged successful outcomes. Another program that evolved from the Hope From the Start task force, is the development of a warm hand-off process between expectant mothers receiving pre-natal care from Keystone Womens Care with the Early Head Start program. The federally funded program, which began eight years ago under Franklin County Head Start, focuses on early child and family development services for low-income families. It serves a total of 72 children ages 6 weeks to 3 years old, with three of these slots reserved for pregnant mothers, through either home- or center-based programs. The collaboration means Early Head Start case managers will be placed in Keystone's clinic in order to make care more streamlined for patients. Through the process, nurses will work to identify patients who would benefit from the service and then make a ""warm handoff"" to the case manager. Keystone Womens Care hired a Nurse Educator in 2019 to help facilitate this process. To help create more awareness about the prevention of child abuse, Summit Health Community Services partnered with the Childs Advocacy Center to promote the message of Read, Play, Sing Every Day with their children to parents and caregivers. This has been proven to strengthen family connections and build social and emotional readiness for school. Pinwheels for prevention were planted at 20 locations throughout Franklin County. Staff also participated in other events such as the United Ways Early Childhood Expo, the YMCA Healthy Kids Days, and Novel Reels reaching about 700 addition people with their message. In support of the Read, Play, Sing initiative, Summit Health sponsored the purchase of 100 Ferdinand the Bull books that aligned with a free movie screening. A total of 190 children and adults attended this event at Waynesboro Theatre. Inside each of the books were vouchers for children to return to the library to receive a second free book. Sixty-seven children, or 35%, returned to the Alexander Hamilton Memorial Library to receive the second free book; 14, or 20%, signed up for a new library card (16 already had a library card); 36, or 53%, signed up for the summer reading program (21 were already signed up). In August, 2019, Summit Community Services team members distributed 46 Super Health Hero capes to children who completed a social-emotional health activity. 512 individuals attended the annual Autism Fair in September 2019. 102 individuals returned evaluations and, of that group, 83% attended to find resources; 88% found resources they did not know about before attending; 70% have a child with Autism. From 2016 to 2018, over 1,000 people participated in 3 annual Summit Health Autism Fairs designed to create more awareness about autism and the local resources available for families. Out of the 176 post-evaluation surveys returned from the 2017 and 2018 fairs, 119, or 67%, indicated they are a caregiver of a child with autism and 155, or 86%, of the families stated they found resources that they did not know existed. In June 2020, 57 school nurses and 1 school counselor participated in virtual training that included presentations regarding Public Health & Community Building, Resources & Strategies to Help Grieving Students, Anxiety & Depression, and Deescalating Training. 55 of those 57 individuals returned evaluations. Of those 55, 100% strongly agree or agree that they have a better understanding of local resources available for grieving children, teens and families; they understand the difference between resilience and post-traumatic growth, they know how to identify positive coping skills and activities in order to help grieving students and their families, and free mental health apps to recommend as appropriate. Since the debut issue from Fall 2016, six editions of the Living Healthy Magazine have been mailed to roughly 300,000 households in Franklin County as a free health resource. Spearheaded by the Summit Health Public Relations and Community Services teams, topics covered in the magazine focus on top community health priorities including overdose, diabetes prevention and management, stroke, nutrition, and physical activity. Features in the Living Healthy Magazine raise awareness on important health screenings, prevention strategies, and disease management through a combination of real-life accounts from Summit Health patients and community health program participants and educational articles. Summit Health Community Services coordinated a colorectal cancer awareness and prevention campaign in March 2019. The goals of the campaign were to increase awareness on when people should be talking with their PCP to get screenings and to increase awareness on healthy lifestyle behaviors for cancer prevention. Activities including speaking engagements, cooking and conversations and a grocery store tour. Free community yoga sessions were offered in Waynesboro and Chambersburg in honor of Heart Month by Summit Health Community Services. In February 2020, 20 participants attended and all returned evaluations. 36% reported that this was their first time trying yoga, 86% reported getting at least 30+ minutes of physical activity on 1-2 days or more in the last week; 93% reported feeling less stressed and more relaxed after the yoga session, and 94% strongly agreed or agreed that they had a better understanding of how chronic stress can affect heart health and ideas on healthier ways to manage stress after the yoga session. As well, Chambersburg and Waynesboro YMCAs partnered with Summit Community Services in February 2018 and February 2019 to provide Yoga for a Healthy Heart for a total of 42 participants. Based on pre- and post- assessment questionnaires, 40 or 95% of participants reported feelings of less stress/more relaxed after the sessions. In 2019, 15 of 16 participants of 93% reported they strongly agree or agree they developed a better understanding of how can stress can affect heart health and 14 of 16 participants or 87% reported they strongly agree or agree they developed a better understanding of ideas on healthier ways to manage stress. Summit Community Services partnered with the Chambersburg YMCA to introduce this fun, aerobic activity on February 20, 2020. 13 individuals participated. Of the 13 that returned evaluations, 85% reported that this was their first time doing a POUND Class; 85% reported that they exercised at least 1-2 days in the week for 30+ minutes, and 54% reported that they had more energy and less stress after the class. September is National Suicide Prevention Month. Every year, Summit Health and the Suicide Prevention Coalition both coordinate awareness campaigns to highlight the risks and warning signs of suicide and resources available to those in need. Summit Healths Spread Kindness Not Rumors campaign brought 489 people to its website to find resources on suicide prevention, bullying, and ways to spread kindness. The Suicide Prevention Coalition, which is part of the Healthy Franklin County Mental Health Task Force, coordinates the annual Franklin County Commissioners Proclamation of September as Suicide Prevention Month, speaking events and suicide prevention training opportunities during the month. The Healthy Franklin County Mental Health Task Force provided a Mental Health First Aid training on May 22 & 23, 2019. The evidence-based program helps participants grow their knowledge of signs, symptoms and risk factors of mental illnesses and addictions; identify multiple types of professional and self-help resources for individuals with a mental illness or addiction; increase their confidence in and likelihood to help an individual in distress; and show increased mental wellness themselves. The task force targeted case managers, educators, guidance counselors, first responders, the faith community, non-profit organizations, human resources professionals and human services providers. The event was open and free to the general public. The two primary health care systems in Franklin County, Keystone Health and Summit Health, screen all patients for depression using the PHQ2 and PHQ9. 114,341 patients were screened at Summit Health using the PHQ2 (some patients were screened more than one time); 784,300 PHQ2 screening were negative and 83,665 PHQ2 screenings were positive (negative PHQ2 screenings result in the administration of a PHQ9 screening). 21,144 patients were screened at Keystone Health using the PHQ2; and 13,959 were screened at Keystone Health with the PHQ9.

The Health System estimates the transaction price for patients with deductibles and coinsurance and from those who are uninsured based on historical experience and current market conditions. The initial estimate of the transaction price is determined by reducing the standard charge by any contractual adjustments, discounts and implicit price concessions based on historical collection experience. Subsequent changes to the estimate of the transaction price are generally recorded as adjustments to patient care service revenue in the period of the change. Subsequent changes that are determined to be the result of an adverse change in the patient's ability to pay are recorded as bad debt expense.

The document became available on the hospitals website on June 30, 2018. During FY19, key revisions were made across MedStar Health to more effectively impact the communities served throughout Maryland and Washington, DC. Several internal meetings were convened with leadership from each MedStar Health Hospital to review current practices and strategies. As a result of these meetings, the approach to the current CHNA for the remainder of the three-year cycle (FY19-FY21) was revised. A key revision to the CHNA is a greater focus on hospital area strategies that are most appropriate for the local communities served. The number of strategies each hospital is accountable for executing was reduced to encourage more meaningful reach within key areas contrasted with broader reach with reduced impact. Using the standard categories, Health and Wellness, Access to Care and Social Determinants of Health to determine what to prioritize for the CHNA IRS requirements, each hospital agreed to select two to three strategies as priorities that have size and scale impact and measurable outcomes. All other programming was integrated as part of the hospitals overall community health portfolio.

202101279349302670,520491660,COMMUNITY INFORMATION,"PART VI, LINE 4 Geographic: MedStar Harbor Hospitals CBSA includes all residents of ZIP code 21225, the hospitals home ZIP code. The CBSA spans southern Baltimore City and northern Anne Arundel County, and includes four neighborhoods: Brooklyn, Brooklyn Park, Cherry Hill and Curtis Bay. Demographics: Cherry Hill is historically a Black/African American neighborhood, with roots going back to the 17th century. After World War II, more than 600 housing units were built there by the United States War Housing Administration, specifically for African American war workers. Shortly after the war, these units were made into low-income housing. Additional low-income housing units have been added throughout the years, making Cherry Hill one of the largest housing projects east of Chicago. 90.3% of Cherry Hill residents are Black/African American. 60.3% of Cherry Hill residents age 25 years and older have a high school education or less. The median household income for Cherry Hill in is $22,659, compared to $37,992 for the entire CBSA and approximately 57.2% of Cherry Hill families live in poverty. According to the Cherry Hill Health Profile, the life expectancy at birth of a Cherry Hill resident is 69.5, compared to 73.6 in Baltimore City. The age-adjusted all-cause mortality rate per 10,000 in Cherry Hill is 124.6; the all-cause mortality rate in Baltimore City is 99.5. The other neighborhoods central to community health needs assessment include those of Brooklyn and Curtis Bay. 48.4% of residents in these areas are White, 37.7% are Black/African American, and 11.3% Hispanic/Latino. 70.5% of Brooklyn and Curtis Bay Residents age 25 years and older have a high school education or less. The median household income for Brooklyn and Curtis Bay is $35,862, compared to $41,819 for the entire CBSA and approximately 39.5% of Brooklyn and Curtis Bay families live in poverty. According to the Brooklyn and Curtis Bay Health Profile, the life expectancy at birth of a Brooklyn and Curtis Bay resident is 69.7, compared to 73.6 in Baltimore City. The age-adjusted all-cause mortality rate per 10,000 in Brooklyn and Curtis Bay is 125.1; the all-cause mortality rate per 10,000 in Baltimore City is 99.5. High rates of type 2 diabetes and heart disease, including stroke, occur in these communities. For a variety of reasons, including the high poverty rate and low rate of health insurance coverage, many residents often use the MedStar Harbor Hospital emergency department for primary care services. In terms of health care in these communities, they are supported by Family Health Centers of Baltimore, which is a Federally Qualified Health Center (FQHC) providing health care services on a sliding fee scale. In addition,Baltimore city-wide, and various mobile services-such as a needle exchange program, violence prevention, maternal and infant nursing, lead poisoning and abatement programs and others-in the South Baltimore area. Despite the convenient neighborhood location of a FQHC, many residents do not utilize a primary care physician. Typically, a chronic condition, such as diabetes or heart disease, presents severe enough symptoms to warrant a trip to the emergency department. In many cases, several co-morbidities are found to be present at this time. Without primary care follow-up, however, these conditions usually cannot be addressed fully in the time allotted for the emergent issue. In other cases, patients may have symptoms of a much less serious illness-a simple cold, for example-but,since they do not have a primary health care provider, they also visit the emergency department for these ailments. As a result, many of their most basic health needs often are not met."
202101279349302670,520491660,PROMOTION OF COMMUNITY HEALTH,"PART VI, LINE 5 As a community partner, MedStar Harbor Hospital engages in several community benefit activities to improve and promote the health and wellbeing of the community. Priority areas, as determined by the 2018 CHNA, fall under three areas of focus including health and wellness, access to care, and social determinants of health. Programs include (but are not limited to): Access to Care The priority area is addressing access to behavioral health services, including mental health and substance use treatment. Patients are screened for substance use in the emergency department through the Screening, Brief Intervention, and Referral to Treatment (SBIRT) program. In FY20, MedStar Harbor Hospital expanded its SBIRT program to inpatient labor and delivery, as well as 4 outpatient OB/GYN clinics associated with the hospital. As an additional effort to expand access to behavioral health resources, in partnership with community organizations such as Baltimore City Health Department, Mosaic Community Services and National Alliance on Mental Illness -Baltimore (NAMI), the hospital offers no cost education courses on mental health awareness and naloxone administration. MedStar Harbor Hospitals community health team spent FY20 planning for the launch of a new mobile van service, which will provide primary care services. Targeting vulnerable populations, the mobile van planning will allow care to be provided to insured, uninsured, underinsured, and undocumented residents within the community. The van will begin offering services in FY21. MedStar Harbor Hospital also addresses access to care by helping to reduce the financial burden for patients and their families. Patient Financial Services provides financial assistance to uninsured patients who reside within the community by assisting with enrollment in publicly funded entitlement programs, referring patients to State or Federal Insurance Exchange navigator resources and assisting with consideration of funding that may be available from other charitable organizations. Health and Wellness MedStar Harbor Hospital addresses health and wellness by offering a variety of programs and resources that seek to address chronic disease prevention and management. MedStar Harbor Hospital serves as a hub to screen individuals for breast, cervical and colon cancer. at MedStar Harbor Hospital. A unique aspect of this program is that it provides screening to individuals without insurance and/or documentation. As a result, more than 50% of people served are Hispanic/Latino. MedStar Harbor Hospitals community-based education courses are offered to support healthy lifestyle changes for community members. Programs include the Centers for Disease Control led Diabetes Prevention Program, diabetes self-management education, and Smoking Cessation. Additionally, the hospital actively participates in providing health education at events across its CBSA. Social Determinants of Health MedStar Harbor Hospitals other priority is addressing the social determinants of health of the community. Community residents surrounding the hospital have been trained and hired as either a community health advocate or peer recovery coach as part of the Population Health Workforce Development program. These positions serve to empower individuals and their families into better economic conditions. As part of their responsibilities, the community health advocate roles conduct social needs screenings. Social needs screenings are provided to screen for food and housing insecurity, and barriers related to transportation, employment, and utilities. Identified needs are addressed by connecting the participant to social services and other resources in the community. Of the patients screened, 67% reported food insecurity; 46% reported transportation barriers; 11% reported the need for employment assistance. 14% did not have a steady place to live or were worried about losing their home. 80% reported having financial strain. MedStar Harbor Hospital partners with Uber Health to promote access to care for vulnerable populations. Through this partnership, rides are provided to patients and/or families with financial need. The transportation assistance enables patients to attend necessary appointments with their health care providers. Further, MedStar Harbor Hospital addresses food insecurity by enrolling patients into a food prescription delivery program through its partner Hungry Harvest. This temporary source of food assistance allows community health advocates to address a long-term strategy for food access (e.g. Meals on Wheels, etc.). MedStar Harbor Hospital also provides pathways for healthcare careers for the youth in its surrounding community. Rx for Success provides robust student internship experiences for high-risk youth. This eight-week summer internship connects the course curriculum with tangible onsite experience. This allows students to demonstrate skill development and experience working in the medical field.

AS OUTLINED MORE FULLY BELOW THE ORGANIZATION BELIEVES THAT THESE SERVICES AND RELATED COSTS PROMOTE THE HEALTH OF THE COMMUNITY AS A WHOLE AND ARE RENDERED IN CONJUNCTION WITH THE ORGANIZATION'S CHARITABLE TAX-EXEMPT PURPOSES AND MISSION IN PROVIDING MEDICALLY NECESSARY HEALTHCARE SERVICES TO ALL INDIVIDUAL'S IN A NON-DISCRIMINATORY MANNER WITHOUT REGARD TO RACE, COLOR, CREED, SEX, NATIONAL ORIGIN OR ABILITY TO PAY AND CONSISTENT WITH THE COMMUNITY BENEFIT STANDARD PROMULGATED BY THE INTERNAL REVENUE SERVICE (""IRS""). THE COMMUNITY BENEFIT STANDARD IS THE CURRENT STANDARD FOR A HOSPITAL FOR RECOGNITION AS A TAX-EXEMPT AND CHARITABLE ORGANIZATION UNDER INTERNAL REVENUE CODE (""IRC"") 501(C)(3). THE ORGANIZATION IS RECOGNIZED AS A TAX-EXEMPT ENTITY AND CHARITABLE ORGANIZATION UNDER 501(C)(3) OF THE IRC. ALTHOUGH THERE IS NO DEFINITION IN THE TAX CODE FOR THE TERM ""CHARITABLE"", A REGULATION PROMULGATED BY THE DEPARTMENT OF THE TREASURY PROVIDES SOME GUIDANCE AND STATES THAT ""[T]HE TERM CHARITABLE IS USED IN 501(C)(3) IN ITS GENERALLY ACCEPTED LEGAL SENSE,PROVIDES EXAMPLES OF CHARITABLE PURPOSES, INCLUDING THE RELIEF OF THE POOR OR UNPRIVILEGED; THE PROMOTION OF SOCIAL WELFARE; AND THE ADVANCEMENT OF EDUCATION, RELIGION, AND SCIENCE. NOTE: IT DOES NOT EXPLICITLY ADDRESS THE ACTIVITIES OF HOSPITALS. IN THE ABSENCE OF EXPLICIT STATUTORY OR REGULATORY REQUIREMENTS APPLYING THE TERM ""CHARITABLE"" TO HOSPITALS, IT HAS BEEN LEFT TO THE IRS TO DETERMINE THE CRITERIA HOSPITALS MUST MEET TO QUALIFY AS IRC 501(C)(3) CHARITABLE ORGANIZATIONS. THE ORIGINAL STANDARD WAS KNOWN AS THE CHARITY CARE STANDARD. THIS STANDARD WAS REPLACED BY THE IRS WITH THE COMMUNITY BENEFIT STANDARD WHICH IS THE CURRENT STANDARD. CHARITY CARE STANDARD IN 1956, THE IRS ISSUED REVENUE RULING 56-185, WHICH ADDRESSED THE REQUIREMENTS HOSPITALS NEEDED TO MEET IN ORDER TO QUALIFY FOR IRC 501(C)(3) STATUS. ONE OF THESE REQUIREMENTS IS KNOWN AS THE ""CHARITY CARE STANDARD."" UNDER THE STANDARD, A HOSPITAL HAD TO PROVIDE, TO THE EXTENT OF ITS FINANCIAL ABILITY, FREE OR REDUCED-COST CARE TO PATIENTS UNABLE TO PAY FOR IT. A HOSPITAL THAT EXPECTED FULL PAYMENT DID NOT, ACCORDING TO THE RULING, PROVIDE CHARITY CARE BASED ON THE FACT THAT SOME PATIENTS ULTIMATELY FAILED TO PAY. THE RULING EMPHASIZED THAT A LOW LEVEL OF CHARITY CARE DID NOT NECESSARILY MEAN THAT A HOSPITAL HAD FAILED TO MEET THE REQUIREMENT SINCE THAT LEVEL COULD REFLECT ITS FINANCIAL ABILITY TO PROVIDE SUCH CARE. THE RULING ALSO NOTED THAT PUBLICLY SUPPORTED COMMUNITY HOSPITALS WOULD NORMALLY QUALIFY AS CHARITABLE ORGANIZATIONS BECAUSE THEY SERVE THE ENTIRE COMMUNITY AND A LOW LEVEL OF CHARITY CARE WOULD NOT AFFECT A HOSPITAL'S EXEMPT STATUS IF IT WAS DUE TO THE SURROUNDING COMMUNITY'S LACK OF CHARITABLE DEMANDS. COMMUNITY BENEFIT STANDARD IN 1969, THE IRS ISSUED REVENUE RULING 69-545, WHICH ""REMOVE[D]"" FROM REVENUE RULING 56-185 ""THE REQUIREMENTS RELATING TO CARING FOR PATIENTS WITHOUT CHARGE OR AT RATES BELOW COST."" UNDER THE STANDARD DEVELOPED IN REVENUE RULING 69-545, WHICH IS KNOWN AS THE ""COMMUNITY BENEFIT STANDARD,"" HOSPITALS ARE JUDGED ON WHETHER THEY PROMOTE THE HEALTH OF A BROAD CLASS OF INDIVIDUALS IN THE COMMUNITY. THE RULING INVOLVED A HOSPITAL THAT ONLY ADMITTED INDIVIDUALS WHO COULD PAY FOR THE SERVICES (BY THEMSELVES, PRIVATE INSURANCE, OR PUBLIC PROGRAMS SUCH AS MEDICARE), BUT OPERATED A FULL-TIME EMERGENCY ROOM THAT WAS OPEN TO EVERYONE. THE IRS RULED THAT THE HOSPITAL QUALIFIED AS A CHARITABLE ORGANIZATION BECAUSE IT PROMOTED THE HEALTH OF PEOPLE IN ITS COMMUNITY. THE IRS REASONED THAT BECAUSE THE PROMOTION OF HEALTH WAS A CHARITABLE PURPOSE ACCORDING TO THE GENERAL LAW OF CHARITY, IT FELL WITHIN THE ""GENERALLY ACCEPTED LEGAL SENSE"" OF THE TERM ""CHARITABLE,"" AS REQUIRED BY TREAS. REG. 1.501(C)(3)-1(D)(2). THE IRS RULING STATED THAT THE PROMOTION OF HEALTH, LIKE THE RELIEF OF POVERTY AND THE ADVANCEMENT OF EDUCATION AND RELIGION, IS ONE OF THE PURPOSES IN THE GENERAL LAW OF CHARITY THAT IS DEEMED BENEFICIAL TO THE COMMUNITY AS A WHOLE EVEN THOUGH THE CLASS OF BENEFICIARIES ELIGIBLE TO RECEIVE A DIRECT BENEFIT FROM ITS ACTIVITIES DOES NOT INCLUDE ALL MEMBERS OF THE COMMUNITY, SUCH AS INDIGENT MEMBERS OF THE COMMUNITY, PROVIDED THAT THE CLASS IS NOT SO SMALL THAT ITS RELIEF IS NOT OF BENEFIT TO THE COMMUNITY. THE IRS CONCLUDED THAT THE HOSPITAL WAS ""PROMOTING THE HEALTH OF A CLASS OF PERSONS THAT IS BROAD ENOUGH TO BENEFIT THE COMMUNITY"" BECAUSE ITS EMERGENCY ROOM WAS OPEN TO ALL AND IT PROVIDED CARE TO EVERYONE WHO COULD PAY, WHETHER DIRECTLY OR THROUGH THIRD-PARTY REIMBURSEMENT. OTHER CHARACTERISTICS OF THE HOSPITAL THAT THE IRS HIGHLIGHTED INCLUDED THE FOLLOWING: ITS SURPLUS FUNDS WERE USED TO IMPROVE PATIENT CARE, EXPAND HOSPITAL FACILITIES, AND ADVANCE MEDICAL TRAINING, EDUCATION, AND RESEARCH; IT WAS CONTROLLED BY A BOARD OF TRUSTEES THAT CONSISTED OF INDEPENDENT CIVIC LEADERS; AND HOSPITAL MEDICAL STAFF PRIVILEGES WERE AVAILABLE TO ALL QUALIFIED PHYSICIANS. THE AMERICAN HOSPITAL ASSOCIATION (""AHA"") FEELS THAT MEDICARE UNDERPAYMENTS (SHORTFALL) AND BAD DEBT ARE COMMUNITY BENEFIT AND THUS INCLUDABLE ON THE FORM 990, SCHEDULE H, PART I. THIS ORGANIZATION AGREES WITH THE AHA POSITION. AS OUTLINED IN THE AHA LETTER TO THE IRS DATED AUGUST 21, 2007 WITH RESPECT TO THE FIRST PUBLISHED DRAFT OF THE NEW FORM 990 AND SCHEDULE H, THE AHA FELT THAT THE IRS SHOULD INCORPORATE THE FULL VALUE OF THE COMMUNITY BENEFIT THAT HOSPITALS PROVIDE BY COUNTING MEDICARE UNDERPAYMENTS (SHORTFALL) AND BAD DEBT AS QUANTIFIABLE COMMUNITY BENEFIT FOR THE FOLLOWING REASONS: - PROVIDING CARE FOR THE ELDERLY AND SERVING MEDICARE PATIENTS IS AN ESSENTIAL PART OF THE COMMUNITY BENEFIT STANDARD. - MEDICARE, LIKE MEDICAID, DOES NOT PAY THE FULL COST OF CARE. RECENTLY, MEDICARE REIMBURSES HOSPITALS ONLY 92 CENTS FOR EVERY DOLLAR THEY SPEND TO TAKE CARE OF MEDICARE PATIENTS. THE MEDICARE PAYMENT ADVISORY COMMISSION (""MEDPAC"") IN ITS MARCH 2007 REPORT TO CONGRESS CAUTIONED THAT UNDERPAYMENT WILL GET EVEN WORSE, WITH MARGINS REACHING A 10-YEAR LOW AT NEGATIVE 5.4 PERCENT. - MANY MEDICARE BENEFICIARIES, LIKE THEIR MEDICAID COUNTERPARTS, ARE POOR. MORE THAN 46 PERCENT OF MEDICARE SPENDING IS FOR BENEFICIARIES WHOSE INCOME IS BELOW 200 PERCENT OF THE FEDERAL POVERTY LEVEL. MANY OF THOSE MEDICARE BENEFICIARIES ARE ALSO ELIGIBLE FOR MEDICAID -- SO CALLED ELIGIBLES"". THERE IS EVERY COMPELLING PUBLIC POLICY REASON TO TREAT MEDICARE AND MEDICAID UNDERPAYMENTS SIMILARLY FOR PURPOSES OF A HOSPITAL'S COMMUNITY BENEFIT AND INCLUDE THESE COSTS ON FORM 990, SCHEDULE H, PART I. MEDICARE UNDERPAYMENT MUST BE SHOULDERED BY THE HOSPITAL IN ORDER TO CONTINUE TREATING THE COMMUNITY'S ELDERLY AND POOR. THESE UNDERPAYMENTS REPRESENT A REAL COST OF SERVING THE COMMUNITY AND SHOULD COUNT AS A QUANTIFIABLE COMMUNITY BENEFIT. BOTH THE AHA AND THIS ORGANIZATION ALSO FEEL THAT PATIENT BAD DEBT IS A COMMUNITY BENEFIT AND THUS INCLUDABLE ON THE FORM 990, SCHEDULE H, PART I. THERE ARE COMPELLING REASONS THAT PATIENT BAD DEBT SHOULD BE COUNTED AS QUANTIFIABLE COMMUNITY BENEFIT AS FOLLOWS: - A SIGNIFICANT MAJORITY OF BAD DEBT IS ATTRIBUTABLE TO LOW-INCOME PATIENTS, WHO, FOR MANY REASONS, DECLINE TO COMPLETE THE FORMS REQUIRED TO ESTABLISH ELIGIBILITY FOR HOSPITALS' CHARITY CARE OR FINANCIAL ASSISTANCE PROGRAMS. A 2006 CONGRESSIONAL BUDGET OFFICE (""CBO"") REPORT, NONPROFIT HOSPITALS AND THE PROVISION OF COMMUNITY BENEFITS, CITED TWO STUDIES INDICATING THAT ""THE GREAT MAJORITY OF BAD DEBT WAS ATTRIBUTABLE TO PATIENTS WITH INCOMES BELOW 200% OF THE FEDERAL POVERTY LINE"". - THE REPORT ALSO NOTED THAT A SUBSTANTIAL PORTION OF BAD DEBT IS PENDING CHARITY CARE. UNLIKE BAD DEBT IN OTHER INDUSTRIES, HOSPITAL BAD DEBT IS COMPLICATED BY THE FACT THAT HOSPITALS FOLLOW THEIR MISSION TO THE COMMUNITY AND TREAT EVERY PATIENT THAT COMES THROUGH THEIR EMERGENCY DEPARTMENT, REGARDLESS OF ABILITY TO PAY. PATIENTS WHO HAVE OUTSTANDING BILLS ARE NOT TURNED AWAY, UNLIKE OTHER INDUSTRIES. BAD DEBT IS FURTHER COMPLICATED BY THE AUDITING INDUSTRY'S STANDARDS ON REPORTING CHARITY CARE. MANY PATIENTS CANNOT OR DO NOT PROVIDE THE NECESSARY, EXTENSIVE DOCUMENTATION REQUIRED TO BE DEEMED CHARITY CARE BY AUDITORS. AS A RESULT, ROUGHLY 10% OF BAD DEBT IS PENDING CHARITY CARE. - THE CBO CONCLUDED THAT ITS FINDINGS ""SUPPORT THE VALIDITY OF THE USE OF UNCOMPENSATED CARE [BAD DEBT AND CHARITY CARE] AS A MEASURE OF COMMUNITY BENEFITS"" ASSUMING THE FINDINGS ARE GENERALIZABLE NATIONWIDE; THE EXPERIENCE OF HOSPITALS AROUND THE NATION REINFORCES THAT THEY ARE GENERALIZABLE. AS OUTLINED BY THE AHA, DESPITE THE HOSPITAL'S BEST EFFORTS AND DUE DILIGENCE, PATIENT BAD DEBT IS A PART OF THE HOSPITAL'S MISSION AND CHARITABLE PURPOSES. BAD DEBT REPRESENTS"

THE DEPARTMENT IS CHAIRED BY DR. BONNIE COYLE, BOARD CERTIFIED IN PREVENTATIVE MEDICINE, WITH OVER 20 YEARS' EXPERIENCE IN PUBLIC AND PREVENTATIVE HEALTH. ANALYSIS OF INFORMATION FROM THE FOLLOWING SOURCES IS PART OF THE DEPARTMENT'S ONGOING HEALTH NEEDS ASSESSMENT PROCESS: VITAL STATISTICS, PENNSYLVANIA DEPARTMENT OF HEALTH DATA, HOSPITAL DISCHARGE DATA, THE ROBERT WOOD JOHNSON COUNTY HEALTH PROFILES AND OTHER COUNTY DATA AVAILABLE FROM VARIOUS OTHER STATE AGENCIES. IN ADDITION, THE DEPARTMENT COLLECTS ONGOING DATA AND OUTCOMES FROM ITS COMPREHENSIVE COMMUNITY BASED PROGRAMMING INITIATIVES AND FROM ESTABLISHED COLLABORATIVE PARTNERSHIPS. IN 1996, WITH THE FULL APPROVAL AND SUPPORT OF THE BOARD OF TRUSTEES, ST. LUKE'S COMMUNITY HEALTH DEPARTMENT ASSUMED A LEADERSHIP ROLE IN CREATING A HEALTH IMPROVEMENT PARTNERSHIP WITH KEY AGENCIES AND ORGANIZATIONS IN THE GREATER BETHLEHEM AREA. THE BETHLEHEM PARTNERSHIP FOR A HEALTHY COMMUNITY WAS FORMED, CONSISTING OF OVER 60 REPRESENTATIVES FROM HEALTHCARE, BUSINESS, COMMUNITY, EDUCATION AND SERVICE ORGANIZATIONS. THIS GROUP COLLECTIVELY DEVELOPED PROGRAMS TO MEET THE IDENTIFIED NEEDS OF ECONOMICALLY DISADVANTAGED FAMILIES, ESPECIALLY CHILDREN, IN BETHLEHEM AND THROUGHOUT THE LEHIGH VALLEY BY CONDUCTING FORMALIZED COMMUNITY ASSESSMENTS ON A REGULAR BASIS.

THIS COMPREHENSIVE APPROACH MAINTAINED THE MOST SUCCESSFUL AND OUTCOMES-DRIVEN WORK WITHIN THE ALLENTOWN AND BETHLEHEM SCHOOL DISTRICTS, WHILE CREATING A MODEL OF SERVICE THAT COULD BE IMPLEMENTED IN OTHER URBAN AND RURAL SCHOOL DISTRICTS WITH MINOR ACCOMMODATIONS. THIS ALLOWED US TO BETTER ADDRESS THE NEEDS OF OUR EXPANDING SERVICE AREAS AS OUR ORGANIZATION GREW FROM A ONE CAMPUS COMMUNITY HOSPITAL TO AN 11-CAMPUS HOSPITAL NETWORK. WE NOW SPEARHEAD A NATIONAL MODEL OF COLLABORATION WITH 200+ PARTNERS REPRESENTING LOCAL BUSINESSES, GOVERNMENT, EDUCATIONAL, SOCIAL SERVICE AND COMMUNITY ORGANIZATIONS. A NUMBER OF OUR CHNA DETERMINED HEALTH PRIORITIES ARE ADDRESSED AMONG OUR VULNERABLE POPULATIONS USING THE ADOPT A SCHOOL MODEL. THE MISSION OF THE ADOPT A SCHOOL MODEL IS TO CREATE AN ENVIRONMENT WHERE THE ALLENTOWN AND BETHLEHEM AREA SCHOOL DISTRICTS ARE THE HUB TO CULTIVATE THE PHYSICAL AND MENTAL WELL-BEING OF INDIVIDUALS AND FAMILIES IN OUR COMMUNITY THROUGH COLLABORATIVE PARTNERSHIPS, USING EVIDENCE-BASED PROGRAMS, TO CONNECT FAMILIES TO HEALTH SERVICES (MEDICAL, DENTAL, VISION, MENTAL HEALTH AND INSURANCE) WHILE PROMOTING HEALTHY LIVING INITIATIVES, LITERACY AND LEADERSHIP TO IMPROVE THE HEALTH AND EDUCATIONAL OUTCOMES OF STUDENTS. BASED ON THE IDENTIFIED NEEDS AND PRIORITIES, EACH HOSPITAL CAMPUS DEVELOPS PLANS AND PROGRAMS TO IMPROVE THE HEALTH OF THOSE IN THE COMMUNITIES. THROUGH OUR PARTNERSHIP EFFORTS AND INITIATIVES, WE PROVIDE MOBILE YOUTH HEALTH SERVICES (CONNECTING STUDENTS TO MEDICAL, DENTAL & VISION VANS, INSURANCE, PHYSICAL, BEHAVIORAL, AND MENTAL HEALTH ASSESSMENTS AND SERVICES), HEALTHY LIVING INITIATIVES (GET YOUR TAIL ON THE TRAIL, LIVE YOUR LIFE, SCHOOL GARDENS AND NUTRITION PROGRAMS), LITERACY PROGRAMS (DR.

Additionally, the report was mailed to hospital and system board members, state and local elected officials and other key stakeholders. The hospital provides information on community benefit programming to local, state and federal lawmakers through our government affairs office. Finally, the hospital issues media alerts on key community benefit programming, such as its community benefit grants program, to the public, and provides an annual impact report demonstrating the outcomes from those grants. PERCENT OF TOTAL EXPENSE SCHEDULE H, PART I, LINE 7(F) THE DENOMINATOR USED FOR THE CALCULATION OF COLUMN (F), PERCENT OF TOTAL EXPENSE, WAS THE AMOUNT OF TOTAL FUNCTIONAL EXPENSES ON FORM 990, PART IX, LINE 25, COLUMN (A) of $422,610,640 LESS BAD DEBT EXPENSE OF $43,412,881 FROM FORM 990, PART IX, LINE 24(a). FINANCIAL ASSISTANCE AND CERTAIN OTHER COMMUNITY BENEFITS AT COST SCHEDULE H, PART I, LINE 7 A RATIO OF PATIENT CARE COST TO CHARGES, CONSISTENT WITH WORKSHEET 2, WAS USED TO REPORT THE AMOUNTS IN PART I, LINES 7A-7D. FOR AMOUNTS ON LINES 7E-7K, ACTUAL EXPENSES FOR EACH COMMUNITY BENEFIT ACTIVITY ARE TRACED AND REPORTED USING THE ORGANIZATION'S COST ACCOUNTING SYSTEM. BAD DEBT EXPENSE CALCULATION AND FOOTNOTE SCHEDULE H, PART III, LINES 2-4 The provision for bad debts is based upon management's assessment of historical and expected net collections considering business and economic conditions, trends in health care coverage and other collection indicators. Periodically, management assesses the adequacy of the allowance for double, accounts based upon historical write-off experience by payer category. The results of the review are then used to make any modifications to the provision for bad debts to establish an appropriate allowance for uncollectible receivables. THE AMOUNT REPORTED ON PART III, LINE 3, WAS DETERMINED BY TAKING THE AVERAGE ACCEPTANCE RATE FOR ALL CHARITY CARE APPLICATIONS RECEIVED DURING THE YEAR MULTIPLIED BY THE NUMBER OF DENIALS THAT WERE ATTRIBUTABLE TO INSUFFICIENT INFORMATION. THAT TOTAL WAS THEN ADJUSTED DOWNWARD FOR THE ORGANIZATION'S USE OF PRESUMPTIVE ELIGIBILITY WHEN DETERMINING ITS COMMUNITY BENEFITS. BAD DEBT EXPENSE FOOTNOTE FROM CONSOLIDATED, AUDITED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS: THE PROVISION FOR BAD DEBTS IS BASED UPON MANAGEMENT'S ASSESSMENT OF HISTORICAL AND EXPECTED NET COLLECTIONS CONSIDERING BUSINESS AND ECONOMIC CONDITIONS, TRENDS IN HEALTH CARE COVERAGE, AND OTHER COLLECTION INDICATORS. PERIODICALLY, MANAGEMENT ASSESSES THE ADEQUACY OF THE ALLOWANCE FOR DOUBTFUL ACCOUNTS BASED UPON HISTORICAL WRITE-OFF EXPERIENCE BY PAYOR CATEGORY. THE RESULTS OF THIS REVIEW ARE THEN USED TO MAKE ANY MODIFICATIONS TO THE PROVISION FOR BAD DEBT TO ESTABLISH AN APPROPRIATE ALLOWANCE FOR UNCOLLECTIBLE RECEIVABLES. THE MEDICAL CENTER PROVIDES CARE TO PATIENTS WHO MEET CERTAIN CRITERIA UNDER ITS CHARITY CARE POLICY WITHOUT CHARGE OR AT AMOUNTS LESS THAN ITS ESTABLISHED RATES. AMOUNTS DETERMINED TO QUALIFY AS CHARITY CARE ARE NOT REPORTED AS REVENUE. MEDICARE SHORTFALLS AS COMMUNITY BENEFIT SCHEDULE H, Part III, Section B, line 8 The amount reported on Part III, Line 6, was calculated in accordance with Schedule H instructions by utilizing the organization's allowable Medicare cost as reported in the Medicare cost report, which is based on a cost to charge ratio. However, the allowable costs in the Medicare cost report do not reflect the actual cost of providing care to patients since the Medicare cost report excludes many direct patient care costs that are essential to provide quality healthcare for Medicare patients. For example, certain coverage fees to physicians, cost of Medicare C and D, and other similar direct patient care expenses are specifically excluded from allowable cost in the Medicare Cost Report. The organization believes that Piedmont Columbus Regional's Medicare shortfall reported on Part III, Line 7 of Schedule H, should be considered a community benefit as the IRS community benefit standard includes the provision of care to elderly and Medicare patients. IRS Revenue Ruling 69-545 provides, in part, that hospitals serving patients with governmental health insurance, such as Medicare, is an indication the hospital operates to promote health in the community. Additionally, Medicare accounted for 43.99 percent of Piedmont Columbus Regional's patient service revenue. Charity care accounted for another 5.19 percent of Piedmont Columbus Regional's patient service revenue. Piedmont Columbus Regional's policy is to treat Medicare patients, regardless of the extent to which Medicare actually pays for the treatment. For many services, Medicare's reimbursement is less than the cost of the care provided, resulting in shortfalls that are to be absorbed by the hospital in honor of Piedmont Columbus Regional's commitment to treat elderly patients. Many of these patients live on a low, fixed income, and would qualify for financial assistance or other means-tested programs, absent from their enrollment in Medicare. COLLECTION PRACTICES SCHEDULE H, PART III, LINE 9(B) INITIAL SCREENINGS OF ALL INPATIENT, EMERGENCY, AND SURGERY ENCOUNTERS, AS WELL AS MOST OUTPATIENT VISITS, ARE CONDUCTED BY FINANCIAL COUNSELORS IN ORDER TO IDENTIFY ANY AVAILABLE INSURANCE OR OTHER COVERAGE FOR EACH PATIENT. COUNSELORS CONTACT PATIENTS AND THEIR FAMILIES DIRECTLY, EITHER IN PERSON OR BY LETTER, TO ASSIST THE FAMILY IN IDENTIFYING ANY PROGRAMS FOR WHICH THE PATIENT/SERVICE MAY QUALIFY (INCLUDING MEDICAID, STATE CHILDREN'S HEALTH INSURANCE PROGRAM (""SCHIP""), PRIVATE OR GOVERNMENT INSURANCE COVERAGE, AND CHARITY ASSISTANCE). IF THE FAMILY CANNOT BE TIMELY LOCATED OR IS UNCOOPERATIVE, RELATED ACCOUNTS ARE TRANSFERRED TO AN INTERNAL COLLECTION DEPARTMENT FOR FURTHER ATTEMPTS TO OBTAIN PAYMENT OR, IF THE PATIENT MAY QUALIFY FOR ASSISTANCE, TO SECURE A FINANCIAL ASSISTANCE APPLICATION. THE ORGANIZATION'S DEBT COLLECTION POLICY AND PROCEDURES PROHIBIT ANY COLLECTION EFFORTS FOR THE PORTION OF A PATIENT ACCOUNT BALANCE THAT QUALIFIES FOR FINANCIAL ASSISTANCE UNDER THE ORGANIZATION'S CHARITY CARE POLICY."
202101379349307835,581685139,"SCHEDULE H, PART VI, LINE 2: NEEDS ASSESSMENT","As a designated 501(c)(3) nonprofit hospital, Piedmont Columbus Regional is required by the Internal Revenue System to provide to conduct a triennial community health needs assessment (CHNA), in accordance with regulations put forth by the IRS following the 2010 Patient Protection and Affordable Care Act (ACA). Through this assessment, we hope to better understand local health challenges, identify health trends in our community, determine gaps in the current health delivery system and craft a plan to address those gaps and the identified health needs. In FY19, Piedmont Columbus Regional conducted its third triennial CHNA. As in the past, hospital conducted a joint CHNA for both its campuses. FY20 was Year One of the hospital's three-year CHNA implementation strategy. The Piedmont Columbus Regional CHNA was led by the Piedmont Healthcare community benefits team, with significant input and direction from Piedmont Columbus leadership, including the hospital's community outreach team. Process The CHNA started first with a definition of our community. We started first with the hospital's home county, due to the impact of our tax-exempt status. We estimate property taxes make up the largest segment of a hospital's tax exemption. Because of this, we want to ensure that we are providing equal benefit to our county. Additionally, we take into consideration patient origin, and especially that of our lower-income patients, such as those who qualify for financial assistance or receive insurance coverage through Medicaid. Our secondary communities are considered the areas in which we have the highest concentration of patients fitting that criteria, including ones from nearby DeKalb County. Once we established our primary and secondary community, we then conducted an analysis of available public health data. This included resources from: US Census, US Health and Human Services' Community Health Status Indicators, US Department of Agriculture, Economic Research Service, National Center for Education Statistics, Kaiser Family Foundation's State Health Facts, American Heart Association, County Health Rankings and Georgia Online Analytical Statistical Information System (OASIS). All figures are for 2017, unless otherwise noted. Health indicators are estimates provided by County Health Rankings and hospital data were provided by the hospital. An internal survey was also conducted throughout the healthcare system for both clinical and non-clinical employees. Information was gathered on knowledge and understanding of community benefit and current programs, as well as suggestions for how we can better serve our patients and communities. Nearly 900 employees spanning the system responded. Additionally, we conducted a community-based survey in which local stakeholders were asked their thoughts on unmet community health needs and the hospital's role in addressing those needs. These stakeholders included local leaders, nonprofit representatives, elected officials and those with a unique knowledge of the challenges vulnerable populations face. We also evaluated previous community benefit, hospital and community interventions identified in our last CHNA implementation strategies through three lenses: impact, outcomes and sustainability. Interventions and programming considered to have a high score on all three were included in this CHNA and our subsequent strategy. This included our community benefit grants program, our charitable clinic-hospital partnerships and our heart- and stroke-focused community programming. In March 2019, the Piedmont Columbus community outreach team convened a meeting of key stakeholders to discuss health challenges and needs in the local community. Among the 47 stakeholders present were representatives from MercyMed of Columbus charitable clinic, Valley Healthcare System, the Muscogee County School District, the Muscogee County Health Department and Columbus Consolidated Government. The goal of this meeting was to establish community consensus on top unmet health needs the hospital should address. Finally, we conducted direct interviews with 31 state and regional stakeholders and policymakers, with each representing a specific group that tends to be adversely impacted by issues of health equity. These groups included but are not limited to Georgians for a Healthy Future, Georgia Watch, ConsiderHealth, the Community Foundation for Greater Atlanta, the Georgia Charitable Care Network, the Medical Association of Georgia and Healthy Mothers, Healthy Babies. Additionally, we sought and received feedback on our CHNA from public health. Our priorities A key component of the CHNA is to identify the top health priorities we'll address over fiscal years 2020, 2021 and 2022. These priorities guide our community benefit work. They are, in no order: . Increase access to appropriate and affordable health care for all community members, and especially those who are uninsured and those with low incomes . Decrease deaths from cancer and increase access to cancer programming for those with living the disease . Decrease preventable instances of diabetes and decrease the number of patients with uncontrolled diabetes . Reduce rates of obesity and increase access to healthy foods and recreational activities . Decrease the impact of and deaths from stroke . Reduce opioid and related substance abuse and overdose deaths With each priority, we work to achieve greater health equity by reducing the impact of poverty and other socioeconomic indicators. This means that health equity is built into each priority, and that is demonstrated through our implementation strategies. How we determined our priorities: Several key community health needs emerged during the assessment process. The chosen priorities were recommended by the community benefit department with sign-off from hospital and board leadership. The following criteria were used to establish the priorities: . The number of persons affected; . The seriousness of the issue; . Whether the health need particularly affected persons living in poverty or reflected health disparities; and, . Availability of community and/or hospital resources to address the need. The priorities we chose reflected a collective agreement on what hospital leadership, staff and the community felt was most important and within our ability to positively impact the issue. While the priorities reflect clinical access and certain conditions, all priorities are viewed through the lens of health disparities, with particular attention paid to improving outcomes for those most vulnerable due to income and race. This community health needs assessment was unanimously approved by the Piedmont Columbus Regional Board of Directors on June 06, 2019. The Piedmont Columbus Regional implementation strategy was developed in partnership with hospital leadership and community stakeholders to address the identified priorities in our FY19 CHNA. The implementation strategy was designed to be executed over a three-year period and included specific metrics by which we would be able to evaluate our work and its impact. The implementation strategy was developed by utilizing community feedback from the assessment in partnership with the system community benefits department, Piedmont Columbus Regional leadership and the Piedmont Columbus Regional Board of Directors. As mentioned above, we included proven and successful interventions and programming, investing further in work we felt was successful in addressing unmet health needs. The CHNA implementation strategy was unanimously approved October 03, 2019."
202101379349307835,581685139,"SCHEDULE H, PART VI, LINE 3: PATIENT EDUCATION OF ELIGIBILITY FOR ASSIST.","Piedmont Columbus Regional understands that not everyone has the ability to pay their hospital bill due to their insurance status or a limited income, and because of this, we offer financial assistance to qualifying patients. Notification about financial assistance available at Piedmont Columbus Regional includes providing a dedicated contact number, which is disseminated by the hospital to patients by various means. These include but are not limited to the publication of notices in patient bills and by posting notices in emergency rooms, in the Conditions of Admission form, at admitting and registration departments, hospital business offices, and patient financial services offices that are located on facility campuses, and at other public places the hospital may elect, including availability at local low-cost clinics primarily treating uninsured populations. Piedmont Columbus Regional also publishes and widely publicizes a plain language summary of this financial assistance care policy on its facility website, which includes a link to full policy. Referral of patients for financial assistance may be made by any staff or medical staff member at the hospital, including physicians, nurses, financial counselors, social workers, case managers, chaplains and religious sponsors. A request for financial assistance may be made by the patient or a family member, close friend, or associate of the patient, subject to applicable privacy laws. Finally, we provide copies of our financial assistance policy to our partner clinics and others who work closely with low-income populations. We offer assistance in understanding the policy, how it relates to their populations and receive feedback in ways our financial assistance programming could be improved. Additionally, Piedmont Healthcare annually publishes a directory of services and programs for low-income community members, and within this resource guide are extensive directions and advice on how to apply for patient financial assistance. Also, in this guide is information on how to apply for certain government assistance programs, resources to help prepare and file tax returns, as well as detailed resources for local sliding scale and free mental, dental and health resources. This guide is widely distributed to the community via hardcopy, is available within our hospitals and is digitally available online. Copies are provided in both English and Spanish."
202101379349307835,581685139,"SCHEDULE H, PART VI, LINE 4: COMMUNITY INFORMATION","Piedmont Columbus Regional Midtown is located in Muscogee County, which we consider to be our primary community. A total of 195,739 people live in the 216.44 square mile report area defined for this assessment according to the U.S. Census Bureau American Community Survey 2015-19 5-year estimates. The population density for this area, estimated at 904.37 persons per square mile, is greater than the national average population density of 91.93 persons per square mile. Those years, about 43 percent of all Muscogee County residents were white, 46 percent were African American, and other races made up the remaining 1 percent. The median age of people living within the county was 34. A quarter of the population were 18 or younger, 13 percent were over the age of 65 and the rest were ages 18 to 64. Between 2015 and 2019, the average income was $65,942 and median income was $46,408. African Americans had a much lower median household income at $33,958. Sixty-one percent of the population has, at a minimum, attended some college (with 35 percent having obtained an associate degree or higher), and 12 percent did not graduate high school. Seven percent of adults were unemployed in 2020, a figure higher than the national average of 5.4 percent. Thirty-seven percent of households had housing costs that exceeded more than 30 percent of total household income in 2017, indicating a cost burdened household more likely to face overall financial difficulty. Twenty-one percent of the county - about 39,000 people - lived in poverty each year on average between 2015 and 2019. During that same time, 29 percent of children in Muscogee County lived in poverty, a figure that has steadily increased over the last ten years. It is significantly higher than the state average of 22 percent. When broken down by race, 41 percent of African American children and 12 percent of white children lived in poverty. Nearly 78 percent of public school children were eligible for the free or reduced priced lunch program during the 2018-2019 school year, which is higher than the state average of 60 percent. Poor children are statistically less likely to graduate high school or attend college and are nearly twice as likely to become poor adults than their non-poor counterparts. In Muscogee County, 12 percent of county residents were uninsured in 2019, and minorities were twice as likely as their white counterparts to be uninsured. Non-elderly adults by far were the most likely to be uninsured, with 17 percent of those age 18 to 64 as having no insurance coverage during that time period. About 2.4 percent of the population had Limited English Proficiency, which references the populations aged 5 and older who speak a language other than English at home and speak English less than ""very well."" The majority of those households spoke Spanish. In Muscogee County, like with the rest of Georgia, heart disease was the number one cause of both age-adjusted and premature death between 2015 and 2019, and this holds true for all races. Age-adjusted allows communities with different age structures to be compared. Premature death is when death happens before the average age for a given community. There were seven designated health professional shortage areas in the community in 2021: three primary care shortage areas, two mental health shortage areas and two dental health shortage areas. There was one dentist for every 1,720 people in 2019, a figure better than state and national figures. There was one primary care physician for every 980 people, and one mental health provider for every 320 people. Community members have reported an average 3.8 and 4.1 poor physical and mental health days, respectively. Both measures increased since our last CHNA, and poor mental days jumped by about a day, indicating a worsening situation. Twenty-one percent of Muscogee residents reported their health as poor or fair. Violence is an issue in Muscogee County. Homicide was the 2nd leading cause of premature death for all races. The violent crime rate is far above both state and national averages, with 567 violent crimes per every 100,000 residents. Approximately 1,073 people lived with HIV in 2018. HIV is a life-threatening communicable disease that disproportionately affects minority populations and may also indicate the prevalence of unsafe sex practices. The Muscogee rate is slightly higher than the state average and nearly double the national average. Chlamydia rates were much higher than both state averages and nearly double national averages in 2018, with 887.4 infections per every 100,000 people. This is most prevalent among African American populations. Opioid prescriptions have decreased over the last few years. In 2007, there were approximately 108.2 retail opioid prescriptions dispensed per 100 persons, according to the CDC. That number has dropped to 107.5 in 2019, more than double the national average of 46.7 prescriptions per every 100,000 people. We aren't able to tell how many prescriptions are going to a single person, just the overall figure. It's important to note that this number decreased steadily for a number of years and increased sharply in 2019. In 2018, 38 percent of the population had limited access to healthy foods and 26 percent reported having extended periods when they aren't sure how they or their families will eat. There were 223 fast food restaurants in Muscogee County in 2018, and 111,790 people lived in a food desert in 2018, meaning it is difficult to buy affordable or good-quality fresh food in those particular communities. For every 1,000 teen girls aged 15 to 18 in Muscogee County, 41 birth gave birth to a child on average each year between 2012 and 2018. African American teens were twice as likely to have a baby than their white counterparts. Children born to teens are statistically much more likely to experience adverse health and socioeconomic issues as they grow older.

202101379349307835,581685139,"SCHEDULE H, PART VI, LINE 5: PROMOTION OF COMMUNITY HEALTH","Piedmont Columbus Regional actively promotes the health of its community through clinic-hospital partnerships, our community benefit grants programs, community-based health screenings, educational activities, community building activities, the operation of a 24-hour emergency department available to the entire community, the operation of an emergency room open to all members of the community without regard to ability to pay, a governance board composed of community members, use of surplus revenue for facilities improvement, patient care, and medical training, education, and research, the provision of inpatient hospital care for all persons in the community able to pay, including those covered by Medicare and Medicaid, and an open medical staff with privileges available to all qualifying physicians. It's important to note that COVID-19 did have a significant impact on our proactive community benefit programs, as all in-person events and classes were canceled as of early March 2020. We worked to create programming that was responsive to the pandemic, including our migrating to online platforms for vital community-based programming. Please note that Piedmont Columbus Regional Medical Center - Midtown works in full collaboration with Piedmont Columbus Regional Medical Center - Northside, with all community benefit activities combined and executed by the same community benefit team. Because of this, we report on the same programming for each hospital. In FY20, Piedmont Columbus Regional offered various proactive community benefit programs meant to boost the health of the community it serves, including its mobile unit (MU), which regularly serves low-income communities throughout Muscogee and surrounding areas. The Mobile Unit provides access to healthcare for our indigent population Monday through Friday at various locations throughout the community to identify and treat targeted health risks. During clinical visits, the Mobile Unit team consists of a registered nurse, a family practice resident and a PharmD resident under the medical direction of a staff physician. The clinical team assesses each patient, provides acute medical treatment and calls in prescriptions to local pharmacies as necessary. Referrals are sent to Piedmont Columbus Regional emergency department if medically necessary. The Mobile Unit served 1,512 indigent patients during July 01, 2019, to March 01, 2020, when activities ceased due to COVID. From Valley Rescue and Safe House clinics, we had 254 patient encounters. Of those, seven were referred to the emergency department and 71 were referred to community partners for follow-up. Additionally, in FY20, the hospital provided $57,500 in grants to local nonprofit organizations with programming that aligned with our FY19 CHNA. Through of these programs, in October 2019, Piedmont Columbus Regional partnered with the Boys and Girls Clubs of Chattahoochee Valley to host a flu clinic. A total of 76 Flu shots administered to children with an addition of 45 parents/guardians who received flu education from the hospital's chief of pediatrics. In FY20, the hospital maintained its accredited Diabetes Prevention Program, which focuses on at-risk populations as identified in its CHNA. Activities included: ongoing diabetes education includes information on diabetes management, physical activity, medication usage, complication prevention and how to cope with this chronic disease; nutrition education that focuses on food choices and improving blood sugar control; and education to reduce negative impact of diabetes reduce heart disease risk factors and improve weight management. The hospital also regularly offered stroke awareness educational materials and blood pressure screenings at health fairs and community events to achieve and maintain stroke certification, community awareness. Additionally, the hospital has had extensive outreach to the community to provide cancer education and screenings, including prostate and lung cancer screenings. As part of a Piedmont Healthcare systemwide effort, Piedmont Columbus Regional was an active participant in anti-opioid work, which included: active participation on the systemwide task force, tracking opioid prescriptions within the hospital and by providers, utilizing Epic EMR tools to monitor opioid use, offering patients and the community ways to safely dispose of unused medication, and providing ongoing education on opioid prescribing. The advent of COVID-19 precluded local take-back day activities, in which we'd traditionally partner with local law enforcement to host an event in which local residents were encouraged to bring in any unused prescriptions for safe disposal. Piedmont Columbus Regional's Community Outreach department partnered with the Muscogee County School District, Amerigroup, Feed the Valley and University of Georgia Cooperative Extension to host various Farmer's Market throughout the year for at risk populations identified in the CHNA. Fresh fruit and vegetables, interactive food demonstrations along with nutritional education was provided at the events. University of Georgia Cooperative Extension also provided free cooking classes in select low-income housing areas where the attendees were given tips on how to shop for healthy food items on a budget and how to prepare healthy meals with ingredients they may already have in the home. Piedmont Columbus Regional also facilitated education sessions hosted by our dieticians for the annual Muscogee County School District Professional Development Training for the teachers and administrators.

PART III, LINES 2 AND 4 The provision for bad debts is based upon management's assessment of historical and expected net collections considering historical business and economic conditions, trends in health care coverage, and other collection indicators. Periodically throughout the year, management assesses the adequacy of the allowance for uncollectible accounts based upon historical write-off experience by payor category. The results of this review are then used to make modifications to the provision for bad debts to establish an appropriate allowance for uncollectible accounts. PART III, LINE 8 COSTS REPORTED ON LINE 6 ARE OBTAINED FROM THE MEDICARE COST REPORT WHICH IS BASED ON A COST TO CHARGE RATIO. PART III, LINE 9B PATIENTS KNOWN TO QUALIFY FOR CHARITY CARE AND FINANCIAL ASSISTANCE ARE NOT SENT TO COLLECTIONS UNLESS A DETERMINATION IN ACCORDANCE WITH THE FINANCIAL ASSISTANCE POLICY HAS BEEN MADE THAT THE PATIENT HAS THE FINANCIAL RESOURCES TO PAY SOME PORTION OF THEIR BILL BUT REFUSES TO DO SO. Part III, section B In addition to hospital-based revenue and allowable cost generated from Medicare (including DSH and IME) eligible participants reported in Part III Section B, The Christ Hospital provides hospital-based services to other Medicare eligible participants, through Medicare plans sponsored by managed care providers (Medicare Managed Care Plans). Medicare Managed Care Plans are Health Maintenance Organizations (HMOs) or Preferred Provider Organizations (PPOs) that provide basic Medicare coverage plus other coverages to fill gaps in Medicare coverage. These plans have arrangements with certain physicians, hospitals and health care providers to serve patients who are plan members at a contracted rate. Below is the shortfall related to hospital-based revenue and allowable costs under Medicare Managed Care Plans: Revenue received from Medicare Managed Care Plans $111,487,013 Allowable cost of care related to payments from above $(144,048,221) ------------ Shortfall from Medicare Managed Care Plans $(32,561,208) Also, The Christ Hospital has certain Medicare Part B (physician-based) revenue and allowable cost related to services rendered on behalf of Medicare eligible participants by employed physicians of The Christ Hospital. This would include services provided under traditional Medicare, as well as Medicare Managed Care Plans. Below is the shortfall related to the disregarded entities of the Hospital: Revenue received from Medicare Part B Plans (physician-based) $ 99,071,364 Allowable cost of care related to payments from above $(138,165,052) ------------- Shortfall related to the Medicare Part B Plans $ (39,093,687) (physician-based) Part VI NEEDS ASSESSMENT Our first step in conducting our 2019 Community Health Needs Assessment was to define the community we serve. To do so we considered a number of relevant facts and circumstances, including the geographic area we serve, the target populations we serve, and our principle functions as a hospital, which include our service lines. In defining the community we serve, we specifically included the medically underserved, low income and the minority populations who live in the geographic area from which we draw patients. In addition, we included all patients without regard to whether (or how much) they or their insurers pay for care received or whether they are eligible for assistance under our financial assistance policy. We assessed the health needs by engaging the Health Collaborative to conduct a comprehensive and collaborative Community Health Needs Assessment. The Health Collaborative is a nonprofit organization serving the Greater Cincinnati area. It works with its member hospitals on health care improvement projects and shares best practices. The Health Collaborative brought 35 hospitals and 28 local health departments together, including The Christ Hospital, to conduct a comprehensive, collaborative community health needs assessment (Collaborative CHNA). The Collaborative Report also provides a comprehensive and detailed description of (1) how the Collaborative CHNA Team solicited and took into account input received from persons who represent the broad interests of the community, including those with special knowledge of, or expertise in, public health, (2) how and over what period of time such input was provided, (3) the names of organizations providing input and the nature and extent of the organizations input, (4) descriptions of the medically underserved, low income or minority populations being represented by organizations or individuals that provided input. Collectively within 25 counties over 35 hospitals, 28 health departments, including Hamilton County Department of Health, 100 community groups and organizations, and participation of community members. Over 140 data measures were deployed including primary and secondary data over 1400 qualitative surveys. The CHNA team reached out to the local health departments in the spring of 2017 to take the first steps towards the State of Ohio's requirement that health departments and hospitals align their assessments starting in 2020. As a result, the CHNA team has researched more secondary data measures, included hospital utilization data, oversampled vulnerable populations, and engaged more participants. A total of 1,416 people or organizations completed a survey or attended a meeting. A significant part of the increase was due to local health departments helping to promote and conduct meetings. PATIENT EDUCATION OF ELIGIBILITY AND ASSISTANCE TCH POSTS ITS CHARITY CARE POLICY AND FINANCIAL ASSISTANCE CONTRACT INFORMATION IN ADMISSIONS AREAS, EMERGENCY DEPARTMENT, AND OTHER AREAS OF THE ORGANIZATION'S FACILITIES IN WHICH ELIGIBLE PATIENTS ARE LIKELY TO BE PRESENT.

ADDITIONALLY, A COPY OF THE POLICY OR A SUMMARY ALONG WITH THE FINANCIAL ASSISTANCE CONTACT INFORMATION IS INCLUDED IN THE PATIENT BILLS. TCH DISCUSSES WITH THE PATIENT THE AVAILABILITY OF VARIOUS GOVERNMENT BENEFITS, SUCH AS MEDICAID OR STATE PROGRAMS, WHERE APPLICABLE. ADDITIONALLY, TCH ASSISTS PATIENTS IN OBTAINING MEDICAL BENEFITS THROUGH FEDERAL, STATE, AND HOSPITAL PROGRAMS. TCH REPRESENTATIVES WILL PROVIDE THE FOLLOWING SERVICES AT NO COST TO THE PATIENT: - EXPLORE ELIGIBILITY, - FILE APPLICATION ON PATIENT'S BEHALF, - SCHEDULE AND ATTEND APPOINTMENTS, - PROVIDE TRANSPORTATION WHEN NECESSARY, - PROVIDE MEDICAL DOCUMENTATION TO SOCIAL SECURITY ADMINISTRATION FOR DISABILITY CLAIMS. THROUGHOUT THE REGISTRATION AND DISCHARGE PROCESS, PATIENTS AND THEIR COUNSELORS LOOK AT WHAT OPTIONS ARE AVAILABLE. TCH UNDERSTANDS THAT NOT EVERYONE CAN PAY FOR HEALTHCARE SERVICES.

For accounts receivable associated with services provided to patients who have third-party coverage, the System estimates net realizable value based on the estimated contractual reimbursement percentage, which in turn is based on current contract provisions and historical paid claims by payor. For self-pay accounts, including uninsured and patient responsibility accounts, the net realizable value is determined using historical collection experience, adjusted for estimated conversions of patient responsibility portions, expected recoveries and changes in trends to estimate implicit price concessions. Management continually reviews the estimated net realizable value of accounts receivable by monitoring cash collections, economic conditions and trends, changes in payor mix, changes in federal or state healthcare coverage and other matters. The System grants credit without collateral to its patients, most of whom are local residents and are insured under third-party payor agreements, primarily with Medicare, Medicaid and various commercial insurance companies. The System records accounts receivable net of estimated price concessions and such amounts have historically been within managements expectations. The mix of accounts receivable at December 31, 2019 from patients and third-party payors is as follows Medicare - 27, Medicaid - 17, Blue Cross - 24, Commercial, managed care and other - 26, Patients - 6, totaling 100."

Our commitment is to provide quality and compassionate care to our community and the CHNA process provides the ability to focus community-based efforts to address needs. The leaders of NYP-BMH are dedicated to our community with a mission to provide excellent healthcare services in a compassionate and humane manner to the people who live and work in Brooklyn and its surrounding areas. This document outlines the process, priorities, partners, and intended community-based improvement activities for 2019 2021. Our priorities were determined from a data driven process and align with the 2019-2024 New York State Prevention Agenda (NYS PA) and align with the states goal to promote health equity with a focus on physical health, mental health, and social determinants of health. Full reports related to the CHNA process can be found on our website at https://www.nyp.org/about-us/community-affairs/community-service-plans. NYP-BMH collaborated with NewYork-Presbyterian leadership, the New York City Department of Health and Mental Hygiene (DOHMH), Citizens Committee for Children (CCC), Columbia University Irving Medical Center (CUIMC), Weill Cornell Medical College (WCMC), Greater New York Hospital Association (GNYHA), local Community Based Organizations (CBOs), and the New York Academy of Medicine (NYAM) to adopt a community focused process of collecting and analyzing measurable data (quantitative) and views voiced by the community (qualitative) from a variety of sources. The collaborative process ensured significant input from the key stakeholders and local community through questionnaires and focus groups conducted in several languages. This allowed NYP-BMH to develop a focused implementation plan to meet the needs of a targeted community with high disparities. NYP-BMH compiled measurable data and input from the community from numerous sources in order to analyze the health and challenges of our community. The analysis utilized focused neighborhood geography for metrics and included data related to demographics, socioeconomic status, insurance status, social determinants of health, health status, health service utilization, and priority areas from the NY State Prevention Agenda. Community input sources included focus groups and community questionnaires which allowed for a diverse representation of race, language, age, gender identity, and sexual orientation. Data sources include the Citizens Committee for Children Keeping Track Online; Open Data City of New York; Data2Go.NYC; NYC Health Atlas; NYC Mayor Report, the Association for Neighborhood & Housing Development; Behavioral Risk Factor Surveillance System (BRFSS), Claritas; NYC Community Health Profile, State Cancer Profiles, and U.S. Department of Agriculture. The collected data was ranked to provide detailed insight into the communities with high disparities and was then prioritized to determine the highest health priorities for the identified communities. The prioritized data provided insight into community health needs and challenges and allowed NYPBMH to establish focus areas and goals to align with the NY State Prevention Agenda. Our team is committed to the successful implementation of each initiative and will utilize quality process improvement efforts annually to report on process and outcome measures in order to adapt each program to meet the annual expectations outlined as well as meet the needs of our community. The NYP-BMH communities of high disparities are diverse neighborhoods with high rates of Medicaid enrollment, people living in poverty, low high school graduation rates, and high unemployment rates. The Crown Heights neighborhood (North and South) has high rates of adult obesity at 26% and 32% respectively, high crude rates of maternal morbidity per 10,000 deliveries at 372.5 and 234.6 respectively, and self-reported poor mental health at 10.5% for Kings County as a whole. To align with the constantly changing dynamics of the community, NYP-BMH has revised the initiatives as compared to the 2013 2016 CSP and will target efforts in the Crown Heights neighborhood of Brooklyn with priority areas related to the prevention of (1) chronic disease, (2) promotion of healthy women, infants, and children, (3) prevent communicable diseases, and (4) promotion of well-being to prevent mental health and substance abuse."

Higher Minority Population Higher non-White population, 65.9%, than the state 45.6%, driven by African Americans, 31.8%, followed by Hispanics, 17.2%. To ensure the community service plan is focused on initiatives that impact the highest communities of disparity, NYP-BMH undertook an additional analysis of community health need at the Neighborhood Tabulation Area (NTA) geography based upon a composite of 29 different indicators. Indicators were carefully selected, across five domains: demographics, income, insurance, access to care, and New York State Department of Health Prevention Agenda Priorities. The objective was to identify the specific NTAs where there is a higher health need and/or a higher expectation of required resources. The defined communitys 32 ZIP codes were cross-walked to 49 NTAs and then categorized into four quartiles based on identified disparities. 1.3M PEOPLE- The high disparity community covers a geography of approximately 1.3M people. 53.8% FEMALE Is 53.8% female and slightly younger, 10.9% of the population is 65+, compared to NYC. 25.5% DID NOT COMPLETE HIGH SCHOOL In aggregate, there are above NYC average percentages of residents that are foreign born, not graduated from high school, unemployed, and single parents. 27.3% LIVING IN POVERTY There are more living in poverty, all ages 27.3%, than the NYC average, 20.6%, and without health insurance, 15.5%, than the NYC average, 13.5%. 43.9% MEDICAID ENROLLMENT Numerous neighborhoods also have a higher than average Medicaid enrollment, overall 43.9%, NYC 37.0%. 86.1% MINORITY POPULATION Has a much higher minority population at 86.1% (especially Black and Hispanic/Latino) than does the NYC average 67%. In an effort to focus initiatives to make the largest impact to a high disparity community, the NYP-BMH team analyzed all data elements and isolated Crown Heights and the NYS PA priority areas of 1) Prevent Chronic Diseases, 2) Promote Healthy Women, Infants and Children, 3) Promote Well-Being and Prevent Mental and Substance Use Disorders, and 4) Prevent Communicable Disease."

CHALK aims to address obesity using a socio ecological model as its theoretical framework. The program will drive system and environmental changes that produce long lasting improvements around wellness in the targeted community of Crown Heights, where food insecurity and obesity rates are high. CHALKs multipronged approach as currently implemented in Washington Heights/Inwood includes: 1) Mobile market (client-choice style mobile food pantry serving food insecure patients by household size, up to 200 individuals per distribution; connection to community resources, cooking demonstrations, and benefits enrollment) 2) Fruit and vegetable prescription program (coupons redeemable for produce at local farmers markets for patients seen at hospital community-based primary care sites ($10/month)) 3) Elementary schools partnership (non-prescriptive partnership model, creation of wellness councils, implementation of wellness policies, staff professional development, nutrition education, connection to community resources and partners, built environment changes that promote healthy lifestyles). CHALKs existing elementary school partnerships in northern Manhattan have increased access to healthy lifestyles for students and their families. The CHALK model strengthens school-based wellness councils and policy implementation, increases physical activity and nutrition programing, and connects stakeholders with community partners to support sustained success. Promote Healthy Women, Infants and Children - Maternal & Womens Health Promote healthy women infants and children by providing peer and expert support to pregnant persons in order to promote optimal infant feeding, childbirth practices, and parental mental well-being. This program seeks to impact at least 10% of NYP Brooklyn Methodist Hospital birthing population, which amounts to over 500 expectant persons. 1) Provide virtual and reality-based space where pregnant persons can engage in discourse with their peers. 2) Follow several cohorts of 8-12 expectant parents and engage them in 3 pre-natal group visits (both in-person and virtually), and between 3-4 postpartum visits individually (both in-person and virtually), over the course of 3 months. 3) Provide educational support by persons trained in infant feeding, infant care, birthing, and postpartum mental health screening. Prevent Communicable Diseases Human Immunodeficiency Virus (HIV) and Focus Area 4: Hepatitis C (HCV) Ending the HIV and HCV epidemics in NYS is now a legitimate possibility and NYP is playing a leading role in this effort. The NYP ETE Initiative would create a multi-campus HIV and HCV elimination strategy that would a) increase HIV and HCV testing and linkage to care, b) re-engage HIV+ and HCV+ individuals to care, and c) expand effective HIV and HCV prevention services, like PrEP and MAT. Utilizing existing multi-campus dashboards an NYP Pilot would link, in real-time, all new HIV and HCV diagnoses, those (thousands) individuals out of care, and those in need of preventive servicesi . Expanded deployment of a Health Priority Specialist in existing sites, like NYP Emergency Departments (NYP ED), would be the effector arm for the intervention. A major investment in a Mobile Medical Unit (MMU) would also help bring these needed services to communities surrounding our medical centers and additionally act as the nidus for new PrEP program growth at NYP-BMH. Collectively this multimodal, evidence based intervention could help NYP end the HIV and HCV epidemics in our targeted communities. PERFORMANCE MEASURES: Performance indicators will be aligned with the HIV. Prevent Chronic Disease Chronic Disease Preventive Care and Management The American College of Physicians, Society of General Internal Medicine, Society of Hospital Medicine, American Geriatrics Society, American College of Emergency Physicians, and Society of Academic Emergency Medicine have worked together to develop consensus standards for transitional care.(Snow et. al. 2009) The coordination of care across the health care continuum is crucial to the implementation, management, and evaluation of a patients treatment plan. The transfer and receipt of patient information between different levels of care and locations ensure continuity and promote successful treatment. Unfortunately, breakdowns in these processes, as well as the ineffective handoff of information between care providers, can lead to poor transitions and miscommunication among providers (Mansukhani et. al.2015) NYP-BMHs 30-Day Transitional care initiative is used by the care team as a time frame required to provide care coordination. The Transitions Care Team (TCT) identifies high utilizers and/or patients, who are 18 years of age and older, with a high LACE score, from Medicaid lists. Between 2017 and 2018, the NYP-BMH care team has touched 2215 distinct patients across 5146 visits. This program will continue to identify and treat patients while ensuring continuity of care across health care settings. Promote Well-Being & Prevent Mental & Substance Use Disorders Strengthen opportunities to build well-being and resilience across the lifespan. Mental health first aid (MHFA) is an international, evidence based, training program proven to be an effective intervention for mental health education, prevention and addressing stigma. Peer-reviewed studies show that individuals trained in the program achieve the following outcomes: 1. Grow their knowledge of signs, symptoms, and risk factors of mental illnesses and addictions. 2. Can identify multiple types of professional and self-help resources for individuals with a mental illness or addiction. 3. Increase their confidence in and likelihood to help an individual in distress. 4. Show increase mental wellness themselves. NYP has been providing this training since 2015 through its Building Bridges, Knowledge, and Health Coalition and, in partnership with ThriveNYC, and has trained over 800 individuals. Mental Health First Aid USA is listed in the substance abuse and mental health services administrations national registry of evidence-based programs and practices."

In the quantitative analysis, multiple sources provided the reportable statistics including the New York State Community Health Indicators, the County Health Rankings Report, as well as internal data from Cayuga Medical Center. The data collected for the quantitative assessment was then sorted into the following health categories: Demographics and socioeconomic status, Access to healthcare, Health status of overall population and priority populations, Risk factor behaviors and conditions related to top 5 causes of death, child health, Infectious diseases, Natural environment, Social and mental health environment, and Resources/Assets. For every indicator, comparisons were made utilizing the mean value for each individual county, the aggregate value for the total community, the New York State without New York City state value and the U.S. value where applicable to generate context for interpretation. Information for this assessment was collected in a different manner this year, as the CHNA and Community Health Improvement Plan (CHIP) was a combined effort with the Local Health Department of Tompkins County. The CHNA/CHIP team was comprised of representatives from Tompkins County, Cayuga Medical Center, and several community-based non-profit organizations. Much of the information driving the selection/confirmation of our priorities was gathered through conversations with service providers and through panels and presentation by peers and providers. Key data indicators were reviewed to guide selection decisions for our priority focus areas. For example, data on hospitalizations related to mental health and substance abuse showed steep increases over the last 2-10 years, indicating that mental health and substance abuse continues to be a priority for Tompkins County. Finally, review of chronic disease indicators revealed that Tompkins County is in the second quartile statewide, indicating the need to continue our efforts to focus on underserved populations, particularly in the rural parts of the county."

Many of these areas are designated rural counties and Tompkins County is New York State's smallest Metropolitan Statistical Area. The total service area spans approximately 1,000 square miles in the middle of the state with an average population density of fewer than 125 persons per square mile. There are several distinct health and health-related factors affecting residents of this area: A) The region is home to an older community. Since the 2000 Census, growth in the 65+ age cohort has ranged from 15% to 32% across the region and is projected to increase by 18% between 2016 and 2021. Issues with chronic disease and psychological distress are well documented for this demographic. Overall, 22.9% of adults aged 55 and over are likely to be in fair or poor health, ranging from 19.6% of those aged 55-64 to 32.1% or those azged 85 and over (National Health Statistics Reports, Health Characteristics of Adults Aged 55 Years and Over: United States, 2004-2007, CDC, 2009). B) Access to health care professionals within the region is problematic. Many of the counties have zip codes within that county with Health Professional Shortage Areas (HPSA's) designations for physician, dental, and mental health care for Medicaid beneficiaries. Even when a provider is available, the rural environment, defined by hilly terrains and lakes as geographic barriers, creates transportation challenges that can limit access. C) In aggregate, residents of the services are fiscally challenged. The median household within the region is $58,743, which is $6,580 below the state average (QuickFacts, Census Bureau)."

The majority of the CHS board of directors are all residents of Tompkins County, CMC's primary service area. Additionally, any qualified healthcare professional that meets the high quality standards of our credentialing process may apply and secure medical staff privileges within an identified department or specialty. As a 501(c)(3) organization, CMC reinvests any surplus in annual operating margin to improve the medical care for the community, including patient-side and technology improvements, facility structure and infrastructure, and improvements in care delivery, As an example, CMC is invested in a $6.9 million facilities project to renovate and expand its inpatient Behavioral Services Unit which was completed in late 2019. Part of this project was funded through a NYS grant, however the majority of the project will be funded through CMC's own reserves. Despite the fact that this crucial community resource does not generate surplus revenue, CMC believes it is a vital service for the community, and as such, continues to invest its limited resources to ensure the community's needs are met. CMC operates several programs at a loss every year to ensure such services are available in the community including Neonatology, Cardial Rehab, and behavioral services."

THE FOLLOWING IS A SUMMARY OF THE TEXT OF THE FOOTNOTE TO THE ORGANIZATION'S FINANCIAL STATEMENTS THAT DESCRIBE THE ORGANIZATION'S BAD DEBT EXPENSE.

THE ORGANIZATION'S CHARGES ARE BASED ON RATES ESTABLISHED BY THE STATE OF MARYLAND HEALTH SERVICES COST REVIEW COMMISSION; ACCORDINGLY, REVENUE REFLECTS ACTUAL CHARGES TO PATIENTS BASED ON RATES IN EFFECT DURING THE PERIOD IN WHICH THE SERVICES ARE RENDERED. CONTRACTUAL ADJUSTMENTS REPRESENT THE DIFFERENCE BETWEEN AMOUNTS BILLED AS PATIENT SERVICE REVENUE AND AMOUNTS ALLOWED BY THIRD-PARTY PAYERS, AND ARE ACCRUED IN THE PERIOD IN WHICH THE RELATED SERVICES ARE RENDERED. THE PROVISION FOR BAD DEBTS IS BASED UPON MANAGEMENT'S ASSESSMENT OF HISTORICAL AND EXPECTED NET COLLECTIONS.

OTHER FACTORS, SUCH AS PAYER MIX, ACCOUNT AGING, APPROVED DISCOUNTS, DENIAL RATES, AND PAYMENT CYCLES ARE CONSIDERED WHEN ESTIMATING THE ALLOWANCES.

AS PART OF THE QUANTITATIVE DATA GATHERING PROCESS FOR THE 2018 CHNA, MERCY'S COMMUNITY BENEFIT COMMITTEE MEMBERS WORKED COLLABORATIVELY WITH THE BALTIMORE NEIGHBORHOOD INDICATORS ALLIANCE-JACOB FRANCE INSTITUTE AT THE UNIVERSITY OF BALTIMORE (BNIA-JFI). BNIA-JFI IS A NONPROFIT ORGANIZATION WHOSE CORE MISSION IS TO PROVIDE OPEN ACCESS TO MEANINGFUL, RELIABLE, AND ACTIONABLE DATA ABOUT, AND FOR, THE CITY OF BALTIMORE AND ITS COMMUNITIES. BNIA-JFI BUILDS ON AND COORDINATES THE RELATED WORK OF CITYWIDE NONPROFIT ORGANIZATIONS, CITY AND STATE GOVERNMENT AGENCIES, NEIGHBORHOODS, FOUNDATIONS, BUSINESSES, AND UNIVERSITIES TO SUPPORT AND STRENGTHEN THE PRINCIPLE AND PRACTICE OF WELL INFORMED DECISION MAKING FOR CHANGE TOWARD STRONG NEIGHBORHOODS, IMPROVED QUALITY OF LIFE, AND A THRIVING CITY. BNIA-JFI IS ALSO A PARTNER MEMBER OF THE NATIONAL NEIGHBORHOOD INDICATORS PARTNERSHIP OF THE URBAN INSTITUTE (NNIP). NNIP IS A COLLABORATIVE EFFORT BY THE URBAN INSTITUTE AND NEARLY 40 LOCAL PARTNERS TO FURTHER THE DEVELOPMENT AND USE OF NEIGHBORHOOD-LEVEL INFORMATION SYSTEMS IN LOCAL POLICYMAKING AND COMMUNITY BUILDING. BNIA-JFI PROVIDED TO MERCY' COMMUNITY BENEFIT COMMITTEE A BROAD ARRAY OF NEIGHBORHOOD DATA INDICATORS THAT PROVIDE ALL OF THE FACTS AND CIRCUMSTANCES PRESENT IN MERCY'S COMMUNITY BENEFIT SERVICE AREA INCLUDING BARRIERS TO ACCESSING CARE, TO PREVENT ILLNESS, TO ENSURE ADEQUATE NUTRITION, OR TO ADDRESS SOCIAL, BEHAVIORAL AND ENVIRONMENTAL FACTORS THAT INFLUENCE HEALTH IN THE COMMUNITY. INCORPORATED INTO BNIA-JFI'S NEIGHBORHOOD-LEVEL SOCIOECONOMIC DATASETS ARE INDIVIDUAL NEIGHBORHOOD HEALTH PROFILES COMPLETED BY THE BALTIMORE CITY HEALTH DEPARTMENT AND UPDATED IN MARCH 2012. THE NEIGHBORHOOD HEALTH PROFILES EXAMINE AT THE UNDERLYING FACTORS THAT AFFECT HEALTH IN EACH NEIGHBORHOOD-THE SOCIAL DETERMINANTS OF HEALTH. THE SOCIAL DETERMINANTS OF HEALTH ARE THE CONDITIONS IN WHICH RESIDENTS LIVE, LEARN, WORK, AND PLAY, AND INCLUDE FACTORS LIKE ACCESS TO HEALTHY FOOD, HEALTHY HOUSING, QUALITY SCHOOLS, AND SAFE PLACES TO BE ACTIVE. THE NEIGHBORHOOD HEALTH PROFILES PRESENT HEALTH OUTCOME INFORMATION AT THE COMMUNITY STATISTICAL AREA (CSA) LEVEL IN BALTIMORE CITY IN ORDER TO SUPPORT COMMUNITY-LEVEL HEALTH IMPROVEMENT EFFORTS TO ACHIEVE THE HEALTHY BALTIMORE 2015 PLAN, THE CITY'S COMPREHENSIVE PUBLIC HEALTH AGENDA TO IMPROVE HEALTH OUTCOMES IN BALTIMORE. THE BALTIMORE CITY'S OFFICE OF EPIDEMIOLOGY UTILIZED RIGOROUS RESEARCH METHODS AND SURVEY ANALYSIS TECHNIQUES TO AGGREGATE ALL THE DATA TO THE COMMUNITY STATISTICAL AREA (CSA) LEVEL. THE USE OF THE MOST RECENTLY AVAILABLE NEIGHBORHOOD HEALTH PROFILE INFORMATION FROM THE BALTIMORE CITY HEALTH DEPARTMENT ENSURES THAT THE COMMUNITY HEALTH PRIORITIES OF MERCY MEDICAL CENTER REMAIN ALIGNED WITH THE CURRENT HEALTH PRIORITIES OF THE CITY. DATA SOURCES INCLUDE A VARIETY OF PUBLIC AND PRIVATE SOURCES SUCH AS: THE U.S. CENSUS, THE AMERICAN COMMUNITY SURVEY, THE VITAL STATISTICS ADMINISTRATION AT THE MARYLAND DEPARTMENT OF HEALTH AND MENTAL HYGIENE, THE NATIONAL CENTER FOR HEALTH STATISTICS, THE BALTIMORE CITY PUBLIC SCHOOLS SYSTEM, THE MAYOR'S OFFICE OF INFORMATION TECHNOLOGY, THE BALTIMORE CITY HOUSING DEPARTMENT, THE BALTIMORE CITY COMPTROLLER'S OFFICE, THE BALTIMORE CITY PLANNING DEPARTMENT, THE BALTIMORE CITY REAL PROPERTY MANAGEMENT DATABASE, THE BALTIMORE CITY LIQUOR BOARD, THE BALTIMORE CITY HEALTH DEPARTMENT, CENTER FOR A LIVABLE FUTURE, AND THE MARYLAND DEPARTMENT OF THE ENVIRONMENT.

THIS WAS ACHIEVED THROUGH REGULAR MEETINGS AND DISCUSSIONS THROUGHOUT FY19. THROUGH PARTICIPATION OF THE HOSPITAL'S EXECUTIVE LEADERSHIP TEAM IN BUSINESS FORUMS SUCH AS THE DOWNTOWN PARTNERSHIP AND MEMBERSHIP IN OTHER ORGANIZATIONS, SIGNIFICANT FEEDBACK AND INFORMATION ON HEALTH CARE NEEDS AND GAPS WAS ALSO GATHERED. 3. MERCY HEALTH SERVICES MISSION AND CORPORATE ETHICS COMMITTEE OF THE BOARD OF TRUSTEES MEETS REGULARLY TO REVIEW AND COORDINATE ISSUES RELATED TO MISSION INTEGRATION AND COORDINATION. THIS BOARD COMMITTEE IS INFORMED AND CLEARLY UNDERSTANDS THE SCOPE AND DEPTH OF THE HOSPITAL'S COMMUNITY BENEFIT AND INITIATIVES. IN SUMMARY, THROUGH A QUANTITATIVE ASSESSMENT OF NEEDS BASED ON REVIEW OF CURRENT DATA SOURCES AND ACTIVE PARTICIPANTS IN SEVERAL COMMUNITY BASED ORGANIZATIONS, MERCY MEDICAL CENTER HAS BEEN ABLE TO DETERMINE AND PRIORITIZE ITS COMMUNITY HEALTH NEEDS FOCUS. IN ADDITION TO THE FOREGOING APPROACHES REGULARLY FOLLOWED BY MERCY MEDICAL CENTER, MERCY MEDICAL CENTER CONDUCTED ITS SECOND COMMUNITY HEALTH NEEDS ASSESSMENT, IN COMPLIANCE WITH THE REQUIREMENTS SET FORTH UNDER INTERNAL REVENUE CODE SECTION 501(R)(3) AND THE GUIDANCE PROVIDED BY IRS NOTICE 2011-52, DURING ITS 2019 TAX YEAR.

MERCY MEDICAL CENTER'S PRIMARY SERVICE AREA (""PSA"") WHICH COMPRISES 17 ZIP CODES IN BALTIMORE CITY, ACCOUNTS FOR 60% OF ITS TOTAL ADMISSIONS. KEY DEMOGRAPHIC CHARACTERISTICS OF THE PSA ARE AS FOLLOWS: POPULATION 1. THE CHNA SERVICE AREA (CBSA) POPULATION IS 186,653, REPRESENTING APPROXIMATELY 30% OF BALTIMORE CITY'S TOTAL POPULATION. 2. THE PERCENTAGE OF HOUSEHOLDS EARNING LESS THAN $25,000 IS DRAMATICALLY HIGHER THAN THE CITYWIDE PERCENTAGE (41.0% VS 33.2%). CONVERSELY, THERE ARE FAR FEWER HOUSEHOLDS EARNING MORE THAN $75,000 WITHIN MERCY'S CNHA SERVICE AREA THAN CITYWIDE (22.7% VS 25.5%). 3.

TEEN BIRTH RATE PER 1,000: 98.7 VS BALTIMORE RATE OF 65.4 4. LOW BIRTH WEIGHT: 12.7% VS BALTIMORE RATE OF 13.0% AS SHOWN BY THESE SELECT INDICATORS, THERE IS A SIGNIFICANT HEALTH STATUS DIPARITY BETWEEN MERCY'S COMMUNITY BENEFIT SERVICE AREA (CBSA) AND BALTIMORE CITY'S RESIDENTS. DUE TO ITS LOCATION IN CENTER CITY, MERCY MEDICAL CENTER CARES FOR MANY OF THE AT-RISK, LOW INCOME POPULATION IN THE COMMUNITIES THAT IMMEDIATELY SURROUND THE HOSPITAL. THIS IS BEST EVIDENCED BY THE LARGE PERCENTAGE OF EMERGENCY ROOM VISITS BY THE MEDICAID, UNINSURED AND MEDICARE PATIENTS. MEDICAID COVERED AND UNINSURED PATIENTS ACCOUNTED FOR MORE THAN 60% OF THE FY20 EMERGENCY ROOM VISITS. THERE ARE A COUPLE NOTABLE REASONS FOR SUCH A HIGH MEDICAID AND UNINSURED PATIENT POPULATION VISITING THE EMERGENCY ROOM: 1. BALTIMORE CITY'S LARGEST HOMELESS SHELTER AT GUILFORD AVENUE IS WITHIN THREE BLOCKS OF THE HOSPITAL.2. MERCY MEDICAL CENTER PROVIDES ALL OF THE MEDICAL STAFF (PHYSICIANS AND NURSING PERSONNEL) FOR HEALTHCARE FOR THE HOMELESS (HCH), A FEDERALLY QUALIFIED HEALTH CENTER, WHICH DELIVERS OUTPATIENT CARE TO A LARGE NUMBER OF HOMELESS PERSONS IN BALTIMORE CITY. THE HCH CLINIC IS LOCATED THREE BLOCKS FROM THE HOSPITAL."
202111329349302206,520591658,"PART VI, LINE 5:","MERCY FAMILY VIOLENCE RESPONSE PROGRAM THE MERCY FAMILY VIOLENCE RESPONSE PROGRAM WAS DEVELOPED BY A MULTIDISCIPLINARY STAFF TASK FORCE AT MERCY MEDICAL CENTER TO PROVIDE CRISIS INTERVENTION AND SAFETY PLANNING FOR VICTIMS OF FAMILY VIOLENCE (DOMESTIC VIOLENCE, CHILD ABUSE, ELDER AND VULNERABLE ADULT ABUSE) AND SEXUAL ASSAULT WHO COME TO MERCY MEDICAL CENTER AND ITS PHYSICIANS FOR TREATMENT. THIS PROGRAM IMPROVES BALTIMORE'S COORDINATED COMMUNITY RESPONSE TO VICTIMS OF VIOLENCE, AND CREATES AN ALERT WORKFORCE AT MERCY MEDICAL CENTER, SKILLED AT IDENTIFYING AND RESPONDING TO VICTIMS OF FAMILY VIOLENCE. DUE TO ITS LOCATION WITHIN THREE BLOCKS OF THE CITY'S LARGEST HOMELSS SHELTER AT GUILFORD AVENUE AND CLOSE PROXIMITY TO HCH, MERCY MEDICAL CENTER'S ER RECEIVES MANY VISITS FROM HOMELESS PERSONS. WITH DECADES OF EXPERIENCE IN PROVIDING EMERGENCY AND URGENT CARE TO POOR AND HOMELESS POPULATIONS, THE HOSPITAL HAS ESTABLISHED KEY SERVICES FOR THE MEDICALLY UNDERSERVED INCLUDING THE FOLLOWING: A FULL TIME SOCIAL WORKER IS A PART OF THE ER TEAM TO COORDINATE CARE AND OTHER SERVICES FOR HOMELESS PATIENTS WHO ARRIVE AT THE ER. ER PHYSICIANS AND NURSES MAKE VISITS TO BALTIMORE CITY SHELTERS TO PROVIDE THE FOLLOWING SERVICES: 1. ADMINISTRATION OF FLU VACCINATIONS TO RESIDENTS 2. PRESENTATIONS ON PARASITES AND INFECTIOUS DISEASE 3. INFECTIOUS DISEASE PREVENTION THE FORENSIC NURSE EXAMINER PROGRAM (FNE) IS HOUSED AT THE HOSPITAL'S ER AND PROVIDES 24/7 CARE TO PATIENTS WHO ARE VICTIMS OF SEXUAL, DOMESTIC, CHILD, ELDER AND INSTITUTIONAL VIOLENCE. FORENSIC NURSES PROVIDE COMPREHENSIVE FORENSIC MEDICAL INTERVIEWS, MEDICAL ASSESSMENTS, EVIDENCE COLLECTION, AND ASSURE CRISIS INTERVENTION TO AN EVER INCREASING VOLUME OF UNDERSERVED PATIENTS. DURING FY 2020, THE FNE PROGRAM CONDUCTED 383 EXAMINATIONS AND IS THE DESIGNATED SITE FOR PATIENTS IN BALTIMORE CITY. LOW BIRTH WEIGHT PROGRAM - DEPARTMENT OF OBSTETRICS MERCY MEDICAL CENTER DELIVERED MORE BABIES, 2,698, THAN ANY OTHER HOSPITAL IN BALTIMORE CITY IN FY 2020. LOW BIRTH WEIGHT AND PREMATURITY ARE INTERTWINED AND CORRELATED. AS CITED IN QUESTION #2, LOW BIRTH WEIGHT IS A KEY HEALTH STATUS INDICATOR THAT IS MEASURED AND TRACKED BY BALTIMORE CITY DEPARTMENT OF HEALTH THAT MUST BE DECREASED IN INCIDENCE. THE HOSPITAL HAS TAKEN A LEADERSHIP ROLE THROUGH ITS ACTIVE PARTICIPATION IN ""B'MORE FOR HEALTHLY BABIES"", A LONG TERM INITIATIVE LED BY THE MAYOR'S OFFICE AND MANAGED BY BALTIMORE CITY HEALTH DEPARTMENT TO REDUCE THE INCIDENTS OF LOW BIRTH WEIGHT. DR ROBERT ATLAS, CHAIRMAN OF MERCY MEDICAL CENTER'S DEPARTMENT OF OBSTETRICS AND GYNECOLOGY, HAS A LEADERSHIP ROLE WITHIN THIS WORKGROUP. THE GOALS OF ""B'MORE FOR HEALTHY BABIES"" ARE REDUCTION IN THE FOLLOWING: 1. RATE OF PRE-TERM BIRTHS BY AT LEAST 10% 2. RATE OF LOW BIRTH WEIGHT INFANTS BY AT LEAST 10% 3. THE NUMBER OF DEATHS FROM UNSAFE SLEEP BY AT LEAST 10% OF NOTE 75.0% OF THE BABIES CARED FOR IN MERCY MEDICAL CENTER'S NEONATAL INTENSIVE CARE UNIT WERE EITHER MEDICAID BENEFICIARIES OR UNINSURED/SELF PAY. THIS POPULATION IS ESPECIALLY LINKED WITH LOW BIRTH RATE AND PREMATURITY DUE TO POVERTY THAT CLOSELY RELATES TO UNHEALTHY LIFESTYLES, PARTICULARLY POOR NUTRITION AND INADEQUATE PRENATAL CARE. IN ORDER TO ENSURE 24/7 COVERAGE FOR ITS OBSTETRICAL PATIENTS, REGARDLESS OF THEIR ABILITY TO PAY, MERCY MEDICAL CENTER PROVIDED $1,632,787 IN PHYSICIAN SUBSIDY FOR THIS SPECIALTY. DETERMINING THE NEEDS IN THE COMMUNITY TO BE ADDRESSED SINCE THE INCEPTION OF THE COMMUNITY BENEFIT REPORTING TO HSCRC, MERCY MEDICAL CENTER HAS CONSISTENTLY RANKED AMOUNG THE TOP QUARTILE OF HOSPITALS IN THE STATE OF MARYLAND IN TERMS OF THE PERCENTAGE OF OPERATING EXPENSE DEVOTED TO COMMUNITY NEEDS PROGRAMS. ACCESS TO CARE FOR AT-RISK, UNDERSERVED POPULATIONS HAS LONG BEEN A CORNERSTONE MISSION FOR MERCY MEDICAL CENTER. MAJOR PROGRAMS TO SERVE THIS NEED INCLUDE OUR FUNDING OF DIRECT PHYSICIAN CHARITY CARE ACROSS ALL SPECIALTIES AND THE PHARMACY CHARITY FUND TO PATIENTS WHO ARE UNINSURED AND UNABLE TO PAY. IN ADDITION, MERCY PROVIDES SUBSIDIZED SUPPORT TO ADULT AND PEDIATRIC PHYSICIAN OFFICES LOCATED ON THE MERCY CAMPUS THAT PROVIDES COST EFFICIENT AND ACCESSIBLE HELATH CARE REGARDLESS OF INSURANCE STATUS AND ARRANGES FOR SLIDING SCALE FEES TO ASSIST THE UNINSURED WITH PHYSICIAN AND OTHER EXPENSES.BASED UPON PRIOR NEEDS ASSESSMENTS, MERCY MEDICAL CENTER IDENTIFIED THREE KEY AREAS OF FOCUS FOR ""MISSION DRIVEN HEALTH SERVICES"" IN FY 2020: THEY ARE AS FOLLOWS: HOMELESSNESS: THE NEED TO RESPOND TO AND ACTIVELY SUPPORT THE MEDICAL PROFESSIONAL NEEDS OF ORGANIZATIONS THAT SERVE THE HOMELESS POPULATION OF BALTIMORE. EMERGENCY SERVICES: AS PROVIDED THROUGH THE EMERGENCY DEPARTMENT, GIVEN THE LARGE PERCENTAGE OF POOR AND UNINSURED PATIENTS WHO ACCESS THIS SERVICE. LOW BIRTH WEIGHT: MERCY MEDICAL CENTER DELIVERS MORE BABIES TO WOMEN AT OR BELOW THE POVERTY LINE THAN ANY OTHER HOSPITAL IN BALTIMORE. A SIGNIFICANT PERCENTAGE (>10%) OF THESE BIRTHS ARE PREMATURE AND OF LOW BIRTH WEIGHT. ALL OF THESE PROGRAMS ARE INTERTWINED AS THEY SHARE A COMMON THREAD IN THAT ALL UNDERSERVED AND POOR POPULATIONS OF BALTIMORE ARE THE PRIMARY RECIPIENTS OF MEDICAL SERVICES PROVIDED BY MERCY MEDICAL CENTER ON AND OFF ITS CAMPUS. HOMELESSNESS THE NUMBER OF PEOPLE EXPERIENCING HOMELESSNESS HAS GROWN STEADILY OVER THE PAST 20 YEARS IN BALTIMORE AND THROUGHOUT THE ENTIRE NATION. THIS NUMBER IS EXPECTED TO CONTINUE TO RISE GIVEN THE DETERIORATING ECONOMIC CONDITIONS LOCALLY AND NATIONALLY THAT CAUSE HIGH UNEMPLOYMENT, LOSS OF HOMES, REDUCED FEDERAL ASSISTANCE TO MEDICAID AND OTHER SAFETY NET PROGRAMS. BALTIMORE'S HOMELESS POPULATION EXTENDS GREATLY BEYOND THOSE WHO CAN FIND BEDS IN CITY AND OTHER NONPROFIT RUN SHELTERS. MERCY MEDICAL CENTER IS DIRECTLY INVOLVED IN THE PROVISION OF MEDICAL SERVICES TO THE HOMELESS POPULATION THROUGH THREE AREAS. HEALTH CARE FOR THE HOMELESS HEALTH CARE FOR THE HOMELESS (HCH) WAS ESTABLISHED IN 1985 AND PROVIDES ADULT, PEDIATRIC, AND GERIATRIC MEDICAL CARE, DENTAL CARE, MENTAL HEALTH, HIV SERVICES, SOCIAL WORK AND CASE MANAGEMENT, ADDICTION TREATMENT, OUTREACH, PRISON RE-ENTRY, SUPPORTIVE HOUSING, AND ACCESS TO EDUCATION AND EMPLOYMENT. SINCE ITS INCEPTION IN 1985, MERCY MEDICAL CENTER HAS DIRECTLY EMPLOYED AND PROVIDED ALL OF THE PHYSICIAN AND NURSING STAFF TO HCH FOR MEDICAL SERVICES. WHILE THE HOSPITAL IS REIMBURSED FOR THE DIRECT COSTS OF ITS EMPLOYED CLINICIANS BY HCH, INDIRECT AND OTHER COSTS CONTRIBUTED TO HCH WERE $314,728 IN FY 2020. MERCY MEDICAL CENTER, THROUGH ITS SOLE MEMBER, MHS, IS GOVERNED BY A COMMUNITY BOARD COMPRISED OF CIVIC LEADERS WHO ARE COMMITTED TO AND REPRESENT THE HEALTHCARE NEEDS OF THE COMMUNITY. MERCY MEDICAL CENTER EXTENDS MEDICAL STAFF PRIVILEGES TO ALL QUALIFIED PHYSICIANS FOR ALL OF ITS DEPARTMENTS.

AS THE MAIN PROVIDER IN A SERVICE AREA THAT INCLUDES A NUMBER OF ECONOMICALLY-CHALLENGED NEIGHBORHOODS, UPHS PROVIDES CARE TO MANY PATIENTS WHO DO NOT HAVE HEALTH INSURANCE PROVIDING MORE THAN $100 MILLION IN CHARITY AND UNDERFUNDED CARE EACH YEAR. IN PARTNERSHIP WITH COMMUNITY-BASED ORGANIZATIONS AND OTHER AREA INSTITUTIONS, UPHS SEEKS TO IDENTIFY AND ADDRESS RACIAL, ETHNIC, AND GENDER DISPARITIES THROUGH SUPPORT FOR PROGRAMS INCLUDING, BUT NOT LIMITED TO: > PUENTES DE SALUD - A WEEKLY FREE CLINIC THAT SEEKS TO ADDRESS THE HEALTH NEEDS OF THE GROWING LATINO POPULATION BY PROVIDING LOW-COST CARE TO PATIENTS ANNUALLY. > THE UNITY CLINIC - A FREE CLINIC THAT PROVIDES PRIMARY CARE SERVICES TO LOW-INCOME ASIAN IMMIGRANTS IN PHILADELPHIA. > WOMEN AND CHILDREN'S HEALTH SERVICES - AN AMBULATORY CARE FACILITY THAT SPECIALIZES IN THE PROVISION OF OBSTETRICAL, FAMILY PLANNING, AND SOCIAL SERVICES THROUGH FREE AND LOW COST PROGRAMS THAT EXTEND WELL BEYOND TRADITIONAL MEDICAL CARE. - HOW THE HEALTH SYSTEM ASSESSES COMMUNITY HEALTH STATUS UPHS PROVIDES VARIOUS COMMUNITY SERVICES WHICH, IN CONJUNCTION WITH PROVIDING PATIENT CARE AND EDUCATIONAL INFORMATION, HELP US ASSESS THE HEALTH STATUS OF OUR COMMUNITY. SOME OF OUR MOST SUCCESSFUL INITIATIVES RESULT FROM APPLYING THE COLLECTIVE RESOURCES OF COMMUNITY RESIDENTS AND ORGANIZATIONS, HEALTH CARE PROFESSIONALS, AND PUBLIC HEALTH AGENCIES WITH THE GOAL OF IDENTIFYING AND ADDRESSING A COMMUNITY PROBLEM. THIS IS ACCOMPLISHED IN MANY WAYS, SUCH AS: FORMAL HEALTH ASSESSMENTS THAT INDIVIDUAL PROGRAMS MAY PERFORM, OPEN DIALOGUE WITH COMMUNITY LEADERS THROUGH PARTICIPATION IN COMMUNITY MEETINGS, OR BY ASSESSING COMMUNITY HEALTH STATUS IN THE WORK WE PERFORM OUT IN THE COMMUNITY. - HOW THE HEALTH SYSTEM COLLABORATES WITH COMMUNITY STAKEHOLDERS, INCLUDING OTHER INSTITUTIONAL PROVIDERS, TO IDENTIFY SPECIFIC COMMUNITY HEALTH NEEDS AND TO DEVELOP AND MEASURE EFFECTIVENESS OF PROGRAMS TO HELP MEET THOSE NEEDS COLLABORATION WITH COMMUNITY STAKEHOLDERS AND OTHER INSTITUTIONAL PROVIDERS IS A PARTICULARLY STRONG AREA FOR UPHS.

Given this mission and within the guidelines of prudent business management, it is further the policy of Temple University Health System (TUHS) that an orderly and controlled system for the write-off of all types of Bad Debt and Charity Care balances is in effect to insure maximum collections. All patients have the option to apply for the TUHS Charity Care Program. The guiding principles behind this policy are to treat all patients equally, with dignity and respect, to serve the emergency healthcare needs of everyone in the community, to assist patients who cannot pay and to balance appropriate financial assistance for patients with fiscal responsibility. Patients and their families have a responsibility to assist TUHS in qualifying them for financial assistance. TUH Inc.'s cost to charge ratio for Part 1, lines 7a through 7d is derived by total expenses divided by the total gross charges."

202141319349302519,232825878,"Part II, Community Building Activities:","Temple University Hospital engages in numerous community building activities throughout the year. These are activities, separate from our ""community health improvement"" activities that advance the health or safety of the neighborhoods we serve.A summary of our community building and other community benefit activities is provided in our Community Benefit Report posted in plain view on our hospital's website at https://www.templehealth.org/locations/temple-university-hospital/about/community-healthCOMMUNITY SUPPORT.(1) Violence Prevention and Intervention. Under the leadership of our Department of Surgery, our Trauma Unit conducts a number of programs that address the financial, emotional and social costs of gun violence in Philadelphia. Our ""Cradle to Grave"" program is a collaborative program with the Juvenile Justice Department and local schools that works with at-risk youth to break the cycle of gun violence. ""Fighting Chance"" teaches residents in high violence neighborhoods to administer first aid to gunshot victims until first responders arrive. ""Safe Bet"" provides gun locks to families to reduce accidental shootings. ""Turning Point,"" with a focus on survivors, helps change attitudes toward gun violence and encourages victims to alter their paths.(2) Emergency Preparedness and Research. This program helps ensure that our staff and hospital facilities are prepared to continue to provide safe, quality patient care under the most austere conditions. This Program is a critical link in federal, state and local disaster response plans. Our Emergency Preparedness Department is involved in three local committees, including the North Philadelphia Emergency Healthcare Support Zone, the Regional Hospital Subcommittee; and the Emergency Support Function-8 Work Group. These committees focus on creation of drills, policy development, and continuing education.(3) Philadelphia MOM. Temple University Hospital assists the Philadelphia Department of Health in providing early interventions for healthy newborns. After identification at Temple University Hospital, city social workers make home visitations through the child's 6th birthday to ensure they have access to healthcare and educational resources.(4) Prenatal Education: All expectant mothers at Temple University Hospital receive counseling on pre-natal nutrition and other topics to promote healthy pregnancy. We provide free childbirth classes covering labor and delivery techniques, breastfeeding basics, postnatal recovery and newborn needs. Our free yoga classes also help expectant mothers with stress reduction, fitness, breathing and overall wellness.(5) Blood Drives. Temple University Hospital works closely with the American Red Cross to support its mission of providing a safe and reliable blood supply that helps ensure quality outcomes and save lives. (6) Mental Health Training. Our staff members provide several hours of free training annually to community-based providers and non-profit organizations on topics such as patient safety and crises response.(7) At Your Service. Temple University Hospital's volunteer intern program connected undergraduate students who engage in pro-active non-clinical rounding on inpatient and outpatient units and interact with patients and families. Volunteer interns gain familiarity with hospital settings while enhancing the experience of patients and visitors. (8) Temple Center for Population Health (TCPH). Serves as an interface with federal, state and local agencies and with community based organizations to collaborate on initiatives to improve the health of our low-income, diverse, medically complex population. TCPH's ""Temple Care Transitions"" program also employs Community Health Workers and Nurse Navigators to identify patients with complex social and medical health issues through intakes conducted in the hospital, community and by telephone. They also assist with scheduling appointments, coordinating transportation, obtaining home support, and educating patients on how they can manage health issues and avoid future hospitalization.(9) Southeast Pennsylvania Collaborative Opportunities to Advance Community Health (COACH) initiative. In partnership with the U.S. Department of Health & Human Services, Philadelphia Department of Health and the Healthcare Improvement Foundation, Temple helps address food insecurity. In selected clinical settings, a member of our hospital staff asks patients about their access to sufficient food. If a patient indicates food insecurity, we refer the patient to community resources for SNAP food assistance, food banks and other needs.(10) Employee Community Engagement. Temple University Hospital conducts numerous engagement activities throughout the year, including collections for new coats and clothing, holiday gifts, food, and school supplies to benefit low income families living in our communities. We are particularly proud of the support that we provide to local public schools, where many families have limited resources to purchase warm weather clothing and school supplies for young children. (11) Temple University Hospital partners with Temple University's Lewis Katz School of Medicine ""Block by Block and other programs to establish partnerships with surrounding communities to improve research and community health. (12) Support Groups: Temple University Hospital's Episcopal Campus is home to free support groups for patients and family members affected by mental health issues, as well as those fighting addiction. Our Caregivers Group also provides education and support to transplant patients and their caregivers and families post-transplant.(13) Addressing Philadelphia's Opioid Epidemic. Temple Health is working closely with the Commonwealth of Pennsylvania and City of Philadelphia Department of Behavioral Health and Disability Services' (DBHIDS) Office of Addiction Services (OAS) to address Philadelphia's opioid epidemic. Temple University Hospital's Episcopal Campus is located at the epicenter of our State's opioid crisis and has the highest number of opioid related deaths in Philadelphia. With support from the Commonwealth, we are expanding medication-assisted treatment programs to several community-based sites throughout Philadelphia using multidisciplinary care teams and social supports. With Temple's Department of Family Medicine's TRUST Clinic (Temple Recovery Using Scientific Treatment) central to this ""hub-and-spoke"" model, we are coordinating services among our emergency departments, local health centers, physician offices and outreach organizations. Additionally, in partnership with the City, our ""Recovery Overdose Survivor Project"" employs certified peer recovery specialists that help link overdose patients and their families with needed services and provide follow-up 48 hours after treatment in our Emergency Department or Crisis Response Center. We are also working with Philadelphia's Office of Homeless Services to establish a 40-bed respite center to address homelessness among opioid users. (14) Support for Early Learning. Temple University Hospital's Episcopal Campus provides facility use for the charitable purpose of providing early learning education for low-income children with autism and disabilities.WORKFORCE DEVELOPMENT(1) Investment in Community's Healthcare Workforce. The purpose of this program is to build local workforce and improve skills sets needed to deliver quality healthcare. This involves comprehensive training and education for workers living in our community, which helps to adapt and improve skills that enable them to participate in a changing healthcare workplace. About half the students are union members and half from the general community, including laid-off workers and those receiving public assistance. Career pathways include nursing, behavioral health, allied health, childcare, health IT. Education services include GED classes and testing as well as ESL and safety instruction.(2) Community Health Worker Program. In partnership with Temple University's Center for Social Policy, District Council 1199c Training and Upgrade Fund and Philadelphia Workforce Development Corporation, this program trains unemployed members of our community to become Community Health Workers. Through this program, we are helping residents develop valuable job skills while also achieving national goals of improving healthcare quality, outcomes and cost."

Under the previous standard, estimates for amounts not expected to be collected based on historical experience were recorded within net patient service revenue and then recognized as bad debt expense. Under the new standard, estimates for unrealizable amounts are recognized as implicit price concessions that are a direct reduction to net patient service revenues. As a result, the amount of bad debt expense reported in the Health System's financial statements has been greatly reduced, despite the fact that overall collection rates have not changed."

If a patient does not qualify for charity care or qualifies for only a charity care discount, the normal billing process of four (4) statements over a span of at least 120 days will occur. If no patient response is received, a write-off request form will be completed by the collection specialist and submitted for proper signature authority for agency referral. Once approved, the account will be transferred to the Bad Debt Financial Class. The account will be forwarded to the collection agency for additional collection effort. Collection vendors are required to include in their collection notifications notice that TUH provides free and/or reduced price care to persons who qualify, that TUH provides assistance in applying for and obtaining government funded insurance, and that patients can contact TUH's Financial Services Department for assistance."

About 70% of our main campus patients reside within these zip codes. This population has a disproportionally high percentage of non-college educated residents living in poverty compared to the city, state, and nation. This service area is also reflected in the City of Philadelphia's 2017 Community Health Assessment and is represented mainly by the City's North, Lower North, and Riverward Planning Districts. These districts have the lowest life expectancy and highest levels of obesity, cardiovascular disease, HIV diagnosis, and the highest mortality rates related to smoking, cancer, opiods, and homicide in the City.The primary service area for our Jeanes campus comprises 9 zip codes: 19111; 19115; 19116; 19120; 19124; 19134; 19135; 19149; and 19152. About 70% of our Jeanes campus patients reside within these zip codes.

Population and Population GrowthThe TUH Service Area's population 5-year growth rate is 1.6%, which nearly matches the City at 1.5%, but is much greater than the State at 0.5%. However, our Service Area, City overall, and State lag well behind the Nation's growth rate of 3.5%.B. Age DistributionThe TUH Service Area's age distribution reveals an overall younger population with 53% under 35 when compared to the City at 50%, State at 43% and Nation at 45.7%. While the 35 - 64 and 65+ year range is lower for TUH, at 34.8% and 12.1%, when compared to the City, at 36.1% and 13.5%, the State, at 38.9% and 18.1%, and Nation, at 38.4% and 15.9%.C. Education LevelIn 2018, the population in the TUH service area consisted of 63.8% with a high school education or less, a rate over 50% higher than the national average of 40.6%. The TUH service area population consists of 36.2% with education beyond high school, 23% less than the national average of 59.4%. It appears the TUH Service Area's education level has shown no improvement in the percentage of those with beyond a high school education; however, there is a small increase in those completing high school. D. Unemployment and Household IncomeUnemployment Although employment rates are steadily rising nationally, 5.0% of Philadelphia's total population was unemployed in November 2018, which is higher than the State unemployment of 4.8% and Nation of 4.1%.

The financial counselors also assist patients in qualifying for patient assistance programs to cover most of the out of pocket costs for expensive medications. (2) Linguistic and Cultural Services. Our language proficient bilingual staff, who we train and credential, performed thousands of interpretations this year. This unique program, known for its excellence, is one of many resources we provide to non-English speaking patients and families.

Under the leadership of Temple University Hospital's Office of Patient Experience, we continued the six (6) Temple Physician Incorporated (TPI), Temple Heart and Vascular Institute (THVI) and Temple Trauma Unit Injury PFACs for a total of 8 PFACs. The goal of these committees is to engage and encourage the participation of patients, their families, and members of the community in evaluating patient satisfaction. Our PFACs are currently setting priorities as well as developing recommendations for improving Temple University Hospital's services, programs, communications and policies to better meet the needs of patients and families with the full support of Temple Health leadership.

RESEARCH HAS CONTINUALLY SHOWN THAT WHEN THE FACTORS INFLUENCING HEALTH ARE EXPLORED, HEALTH CARE ACTUALLY PLAYS THE SMALLEST ROLE PROPORTIONATELY. A REPORT IN THE JOURNAL OF AMERICAN MEDICAL ASSOCIATION AND THE CENTER FOR DISEASE CONTROL (MCGINNIS, 1996) SUGGESTS THAT THE FACTORS IMPACTING HEALTH ARE AS FOLLOWS: LIFESTYLE AND BEHAVIORS, 50%, ENVIRONMENT (HUMAN AND NATURAL), 20%, GENETICS AND HUMAN BIOLOGY, 20%, AND HEALTH CARE, 10%. COMMUNITY BUILDING ACTIVITIES HELP TO ADDRESS THE OTHER INDICATORS OUTSIDE OF THE ROLE TRADITIONALLY PLAYED BY HEALTH-CARE ORGANIZATIONS. THESE ACTIVITIES ARE ALMOST EXCLUSIVELY DONE IN SOME FORM OF PARTNERSHIP IN WHICH THE COMMUNITY OR OTHER ORGANIZATIONS ARE BETTER SUITED TO ADDRESS. HEALTH-CARE ORGANIZATIONS GENERALLY PROVIDE TIMELY AND SPECIFIC RESOURCES TO HELP THESE ISSUES. HEALTH-CARE ORGANIZATIONS CAN BE A RICH AND VALUABLE COMMUNITY RESOURCE IN WAYS NOT TYPICALLY CONSIDERED. OFTEN THE MOST EFFECTIVE WAY TO HELP IMPACT AND IMPROVE THE COMMUNITY HEALTH STATUS IS TO SUPPORT OTHER AGENCIES AND ORGANIZATIONS IN A VARIETY OF WAYS OUTSIDE OF HEALTH SERVICES. THIS IS OFTEN DONE THROUGH CASH OR IN-KIND SERVICES TO SUPPORT OTHER NON-PROFITS, DONATIONS OF DURABLE MEDICAL EQUIPMENT AND SUPPLIES TO CERTAIN AGENCIES, OR THROUGH LEADERSHIP AND EDUCATIONAL EXPERTISE. THE HOSPITAL CONTRIBUTES FINANCIALLY TO A WIDE VARIETY OF COMMUNITY ORGANIZATIONS THAT ADDRESS THE BROADER NEEDS OF THE COMMUNITY. THESE DONATIONS ALLOW OTHER NON-PROFIT ORGANIZATIONS TO FULFILL THEIR MISSIONS TO IMPROVE THE WELL BEING OF THE COMMUNITY AND CONTRIBUTE TO ITS OVERALL HEALTH STATUS IN WAYS THAT MAY DIFFER FROM THE DIRECT SERVICES OF THE HOSPITAL ORGANIZATION AND MAXIMIZE THE RESOURCES THEY HAVE TO WORK WITH. THE HOSPITAL EMPLOYEES ARE ACTIVE IN EDUCATING PARTNERS ON A WIDE VARIETY OF HEALTH SUBJECTS THAT ADVANCE THEIR WORK. FURTHER, THE HOSPITAL EMPLOYEES ARE MEMBERS OF MANY NON-PROFIT BOARDS TO PROVIDE LEADERSHIP OR COLLABORATE TO ADDRESS COMPLEX HEALTH ISSUES.

EXAMPLES OF THESE ITEMS INCLUDE PROVIDER BASED PHYSICIAN EXPENSE, SELF INSURANCE EXPENSE, HOME OFFICE EXPENSE AND THE SHORTFALL FROM FEE SCHEDULE PAYMENTS. THE HOSPITAL BELIEVES THE ENTIRE AMOUNT OF THE MEDICARE SHORTFALL SHOULD BE TREATED AS COMMUNITY BENEFIT, MORE SPECIFICALLY, AS CHARITY CARE.

IMPROVING THE HEALTH OF THE COMMUNITY THROUGH ENVIRONMENTAL EFFORTS WAS ALSO A PRIORITY, INCLUDING LONG-STANDING RECYCLING AND RETRO COMMISSIONING EFFORTS. FINALLY, THE HOSPITAL CONTRIBUTED SUBSTANTIAL RESOURCES TO PROGRAMS, SUCH AS OUR HIRE LOCAL PROGRAM, THAT PROVIDE A PIPELINE FOR AT-RISK HIGH SCHOOL STUDENTS, AND UNDERSERVED COMMUNITY MEMBERS TO PURSUE HEALTHCARE SPECIFIC CAREERS. SELECTED COMMUNITY BUILDING ACTIVITIES ARE HIGHLIGHTED BELOW. ADVOCACY FOR COMMUNITY HEALTH IMPROVEMENTS AND SAFETY. DURING THE 2019 COLORADO LEGISLATIVE SESSION, THE CHILDREN'S HOSPITAL COLORADO GOVERNMENT AFFAIRS TEAM WORKED WITH INTERNAL AND EXTERNAL PARTNERS TO KEEP KIDS OUT OF THE HOSPITAL BY SUPPORTING LAWS THAT WOULD IMPROVE KIDS' HEALTH-AND DEFENDING AGAINST THOSE THAT WOULD NOT. WE BUILT PARTNERSHIPS WITH OUR ALLIES AND ADVOCATES ACROSS THE STATE, ENGAGED OUR HEALTHCARE PROFESSIONALS AND OTHER TEAM MEMBERS AND GAVE A VOICE TO OUR PATIENTS AND FAMILIES. TOGETHER, WE ADVANCED A NUMBER OF POLICY AND ADVOCACY GOALS THAT HAVE THE POTENTIAL TO LIFT THE TRAJECTORY OF A CHILD'S LIFE. EXAMPLES INCLUDE: CHILD AND YOUTH BEHAVIORAL HEALTH: COLORADO IS IN A STATE OF CRISIS FOR CHILD AND YOUTH BEHAVIORAL HEALTH, WITH SUICIDE AS THE LEADING CAUSE OF DEATH FOR YOUNG PEOPLE AGES 10-24. AN ESTIMATED ONE OUT OF EVERY SIX TEENS HAS A DIAGNOSABLE MENTAL HEALTH CONDITION. THAT'S WHY WE HELPED FORM A COALITION TO CHAMPION SENATE BILL 195, A BIPARTISAN MEASURE THAT HAS THE POTENTIAL TO TRANSFORM OUR STATE'S MENTAL HEALTH SYSTEM TO BETTER SERVE COLORADO CHILDREN, YOUTH AND FAMILIES AND TO REDUCE COSTLY, UNNECESSARY INTERVENTIONS. SENATE BILL 195 WILL MOVE FORWARD A SET OF PROGRAMS INCLUDING HIGH QUALITY, STANDARDIZED SCREENING AND ASSESSMENT TO IDENTIFY BEHAVIORAL HEALTH NEEDS EARLY, COMPREHENSIVE ""WRAPAROUND"" CARE COORDINATION SERVICES TO GET KIDS THE RIGHT CARE AT THE RIGHT TIME, AND BLENDED FUNDING STRATEGIES ACROSS AGENCIES TO BETTER INTEGRATE BEHAVIORAL HEALTH SERVICES AND SUPPORTS FOR CHILDREN. TAKEN TOGETHER, THESE APPROACHES ARE A MAJOR STEP TOWARD IMPROVING OUR STATE'S BEHAVIORAL HEALTH SYSTEM FOR KIDS. NUTRITION AND PHYSICAL ACTIVITY: WE JOINED A COALITION OF ANTI-HUNGER ORGANIZATIONS TO SUPPORT HOUSE BILL 1171, A MEASURE THAT WILL REDUCE THE COST OF SCHOOL LUNCHES FOR LOW-INCOME HIGH SCHOOL STUDENTS. WHEN STUDENTS HAVE ACCESS TO PROPER NUTRITION, THEIR HEALTH AND ABILITY TO FOCUS IN SCHOOL IMPROVES. WE ALSO WORKED WITH COALITION PARTNERS TO ADVANCE HOUSE BILL 1161, LEGISLATION THAT ENCOURAGES CHILDREN TO BE ACTIVE BY BOOSTING ACCESS TO COMPREHENSIVE PHYSICAL EDUCATION IN SCHOOLS ACROSS COLORADO. COLORADO KIDS STAND TO BENEFIT FROM THE PASSAGE OF THIS BILL THROUGH STRONGER BONES AND MUSCLES, BETTER MENTAL HEALTH, LOWER RISK OF CHRONIC HEALTH CONDITIONS LIKE TYPE 2 DIABETES AND OBESITY, AND MORE. TEEN VAPING EPIDEMIC: TWENTY SEVEN PERCENT OF COLORADO TEENS REPORT CURRENT USE OF ELECTRONIC CIGARETTES - THE HIGHEST RATE IN THE NATION AND FULLY TWICE THE NATIONAL AVERAGE. THE NICOTINE IN THESE PRODUCTS IS HIGHLY ADDICTIVE, TOXIC AND HARMFUL TO THE DEVELOPING BRAIN. IN ADDITION, THE AEROSOLS IN E-CIGARETTES CAN TRIGGER ASTHMA ATTACKS AND EXPOSE YOUNG PEOPLE TO CARCINOGENS AND HEAVY METALS LIKE LEAD AND ARSENIC, BOTH DIRECTLY AND THROUGH SECONDHAND SMOKE. A KEY STRATEGY TO ADDRESS YOUTH USE OF THESE PRODUCTS IS TO ELIMINATE THEM IN PUBLIC PLACES, AS YOUTH CAN BE HIGHLY SENSITIVE TO NORMALIZATION AND PERCEPTIONS OF HARM BASED ON WHAT THEY SEE IN THEIR ENVIRONMENT. IN 2006, COLORADO PASSED THE CLEAN INDOOR AIR ACT TO PROHIBIT THE SMOKING OF CIGARETTES AND OTHER TOBACCO PRODUCTS IN ENCLOSED PUBLIC PLACES LIKE RESTAURANTS, LIBRARIES, HOSPITALS, OFFICES, GROCERY STORES, CHILDCARE FACILITIES AND PUBLIC TRANSPORTATION. THIS YEAR, WE PARTNERED WITH MEDICAL PROVIDERS, BUSINESSES, AND PUBLIC HEALTH ADVOCATES TO SUCCESSFULLY ADVANCE HOUSE BILL 1076, AN UPDATE TO THE COLORADO CLEAN INDOOR AIR ACT THAT ADDS THE USE OF ELECTRONIC CIGARETTES (ALSO KNOWN AS ""E-CIGARETTES""VAPING"") AS A PROHIBITED ACTIVITY IN CERTAIN PUBLIC INDOOR SPACES AND WORKPLACES. SPEAK UP FOR KIDS: INFLUENCING PUBLIC POLICY TAKES THE DIVERSE EFFORTS OF DEDICATED, PASSIONATE INDIVIDUALS AND ORGANIZATIONS COMING TOGETHER TO MAKE A DIFFERENCE. OUR GRASSROOTS ADVOCACY NETWORK, CHILD HEALTH CHAMPIONS, HARNESSES THE POWER OF ITS MEMBERS TO ADVOCATE FOR BETTER CHILD HEALTH THROUGH PUBLIC POLICY. THIS LEGISLATIVE SESSION, WE ADDED 1,321 NEW MEMBERS TO THE NETWORK, INCREASING OUR TOTAL NUMBER OF ADVOCATES TO OVER 9,200. OVER 2,100 OF THESE ADVOCATES WROTE MORE THAN 6,000 EMAILS TO THEIR LAWMAKERS ON POLICY ISSUES THAT IMPACT KIDS AND FAMILIES. WE GREW OUR FOLLOWING ON FACEBOOK BY OVER 116% AND ON TWITTER BY ALMOST 20%, REACHING MORE ADVOCATES ACROSS THE STATE THAN EVER BEFORE. WE ALSO HOSTED THE EIGHTH ANNUAL SPEAK UP FOR KIDS DAY AT THE CAPITOL, TRAINING 180 NEW ADVOCATES FROM ACROSS THE STATE AT AN INTENSIVE, INSPIRING AND HANDS-ON EVENT THAT CONNECTS THEM WITH THEIR LOCAL LEGISLATORS TO HAVE CONVERSATIONS ABOUT PENDING KIDS' HEALTH LEGISLATION. FINALLY, IN PARTNERSHIP WITH THE AMERICAN ACADEMY OF PEDIATRICS, COLORADO CHAPTER, WE REGULARLY ACTIVATED MORE THAN 20 COMMUNITY PEDIATRICIANS TO REACH OUT TO THEIR LEGISLATORS AT KEY POINTS THROUGHOUT THE SESSION. PARTNERSHIPS ARE AN ESSENTIAL COMPONENT TO CHILDREN'S COMMUNITY HEALTH WORK. THE HOSPITAL HAS PARTNERED WITH AN ARRAY OF LOCAL, STATE AND NATIONAL ORGANIZATIONS TO COORDINATE, COLLABORATE AND SHARE KEY FINDINGS AND LESSONS LEARNED IN IMPROVING HEALTH AND QUALITY OF LIFE FOR CHILDREN IN COLORADO. BELOW ARE A FEW EXAMPLES OF CHILDREN'S COLLABORATIONS ADDRESSING COMMUNITY BUILDING AND HEALTH IMPROVEMENT. COALITION BUILDING: IN 2016, CHILDREN'S HOSPITAL COLORADO JOINED FORCES WITH EIGHT OTHER STATEWIDE HEALTH AND EDUCATION ORGANIZATIONS TO FORM THE COLORADO ALLIANCE FOR SCHOOL HEALTH (THE ""ALLIANCE""). THE ALLIANCE AIMS TO TRANSFORM HOW HEALTH CARE AND EDUCATION PARTNERS COLLABORATE TO CREATE SUSTAINABLE SYSTEMS THAT RESULT IN HEALTH EQUITY AMONG ALL COLORADO STUDENTS. IN 2019, THE ALLIANCE CREATED A CALL TO ACTION USING DATA AND EVIDENCED-BASED PRACTICES TO OUTLINE OPPORTUNITIES FOR HEALTH AND EDUCATION TO WORK TOGETHER TO MEET THE HEALTHCARE NEEDS OF EVERY STUDENT, AND IDENTIFY ACTIONS WE CAN TAKE RIGHT NOW TO IMPROVE THE HEALTH OF ALL COLORADO YOUTH, ESPECIALLY THOSE MOST VULNERABLE TO LOW SCHOOL PERFORMANCE BECAUSE OF POOR ACCESS TO HEALTH RESOURCES. THE ALLIANCE THEN SOUGHT AND FORMED PARTNERSHIPS WITH THREE DISTRICTS, URBAN AND RURAL, IN DIFFERENT AREAS OF THE STATE TO IDENTIFY PROJECTS THAT WILL FURTHER THE CALL TO ACTION WHILE IMPACTING THEIR OWN STUDENTS AND COMMUNITIES. WE ARE COLLABORATING WITH STAKEHOLDERS IN EACH DISTRICT (SUPERINTENDENTS, DIRECTORS OF HEALTH SERVICES, COMMUNITY PROVIDERS AND FAMILIES) TO DESIGN WHAT MEANINGFUL WORK, INTERVENTIONS, AND STIPENDS LOOK LIKE TO THEIR COMMUNITY. ADDITIONALLY, EFFORTS WILL BE MADE TO ENSURE THOSE MOST IMPACTED ARE ALSO INCLUDED IN DECISION MAKING PROCESSES THROUGHOUT THE PARTNERSHIP.

ACROSS THE HOSPITAL, NUMEROUS INTERNAL AND EXTERNAL DATA SOURCES ARE REGULARLY MONITORED AND UTILIZED TO IDENTIFY TRENDS AND OPPORTUNITIES TO IMPACT CHILD HEALTH. ADDITIONALLY, HOSPITAL STAFF DEDICATES SIGNIFICANT TIME TO SERVING ON COMMUNITY BOARDS AND OTHER COMMUNITY GROUPS THAT ASSESS HEALTH NEEDS OF THE COMMUNITY AND PROACTIVELY PARTICIPATES IN THE HEALTH IMPROVEMENT EFFORTS LED BY THESE PARTNERS. IN 2018, CHCO FORMALIZED A POPULATION HEALTH STRATEGY. THE GOAL IS THE CREATION AND OPERATION OF A COMMUNITY BASED; PARTNER DRIVEN NETWORK OF CARE. THIS NETWORK BOTH EXPANDS ACCESS TO TRADITIONAL PEDIATRIC HEALTHCARE AND EXPANDS ACCESS TO NON-TRADITIONAL CARE THAT ADDRESSES A CHILD'S TOTAL PICTURE OF HEALTH, THE SOCIAL DETERMINANTS OF HEALTH. OPERATING A COMMUNITY BASED, PARTNER DRIVEN NETWORK OF CARE REQUIRES IDENTIFYING PARTNERS THAT WILL ENGAGE IN A TRANSFORMATIVE SYSTEM OF CARE, ONE THAT ALLOWS A PEDIATRIC SPECIALTY HOSPITAL TO WORK WITH COMMUNITY BASED PARTNERS TO GENERATE IMPROVED HEALTH FOR ALL KIDS IN A TARGETED REGION, DESPITE NEVER BEING PATIENTS OR HAVING LIMITED INTERACTIONS WITH THAT HOSPITAL. THE NETWORK SUPPORTS IMPROVEMENTS IN THE DELIVERY OF TRADITIONAL HEALTHCARE SERVICES, LIKE THE NUMBER OF IMMUNIZATIONS, WELL-CHILD VISITS, ORAL HEALTH SCREENINGS AND BEHAVIORAL HEALTH INTERVENTIONS. AND THE NETWORK MUST ALSO SUPPORT IMPROVEMENTS IN SOCIAL CONDITIONS IMPACTING HEALTH SUCH AS INCREASED ATTENDANCE AT SCHOOL, INCREASED ACCESS TO NUTRITIONAL FOOD AND SUSTAINED ACCESS TO STABLE HOUSING. GUIDED BY THE GROWING EVIDENCE IN SOCIAL DETERMINANTS OF HEALTH (SDOH) RESEARCH, AS WELL AS DATA CHCO COLLECTED THROUGH ITS PSYCHOSOCIAL SCREENER, IN 2019 CHCO LAUNCHED A NUMBER OF INITIATIVES ANCHORED BY A HOLISTIC MODEL THAT INTEGRATES CLINICAL CARE WITH RESOURCES THAT ADDRESS SOCIAL DETERMINANTS OF HEALTH. EXAMPLES OF RESPONDING TO THE NEEDS OF THE COMMUNITY: IN OCTOBER 2019, CHCO LAUNCHED RESOURCE CONNECT (WITH HEALTHY ROOTS FOOD CLINIC), OUR VERSION OF A COMMUNITY HEALTH RESOURCE CENTER HOUSED WITHIN OUR NEW COMPREHENSIVE SERVICES BUILDING, THE CHILD HEALTH PAVILION. RESOURCE CONNECT PROVIDES FAMILIES WITH COMMUNITY-BASED SERVICES TO MEET NON-MEDICAL HEALTH NEEDS SUCH AS HOUSING, BENEFITS, AND FOOD. THE SERVICES ACCESSIBLE THROUGH RESOURCE CONNECT ADDRESS PRIORITY HEALTH NEEDS AND HEALTH DISPARITIES IDENTIFIED IN OUR COMMUNITY HEALTH NEEDS ASSESSMENT, AS WELL AS BY DATA FROM CHCO'S VALIDATED PSYCHOSOCIAL SCREENER ADMINISTERED IN SEVERAL OF OUR PRIMARY CARE CLINICS. WITH THE LAUNCH OF RESOURCE CONNECT AND RELATED WRAPAROUND SERVICES INCLUDING OUR COMMUNITY HEALTH NAVIGATOR PROGRAM AND HEALTHY ROOTS FOOD CLINIC, WE AIM TO DEVELOP AN ARRAY OF INTEGRATED SERVICES THAT INCREASE THE UTILIZATION OF COMMUNITY RESOURCES AND ENROLLMENT IN PIVOTAL PROGRAMS SUCH AS MEDICAID, THE SUPPLEMENTAL NUTRITION ASSISTANCE PROGRAM (SNAP), AND THE COLORADO LOW-INCOME ENERGY ASSISTANCE PROGRAM (LEAP). IN ADDITION, WE ARE ABLE TO PROVIDE HELPFUL INFORMATION TO PRIMARY CARE PROVIDERS ABOUT THE NONMEDICAL NEEDS OF FAMILIES SO THEY CAN PROVIDE MORE COMPREHENSIVE AND COMPASSIONATE CARE-ULTIMATELY DEVELOPING A PARTNERSHIP MODEL WITHIN HEALTH CARE THAT IMPROVES HEALTH OUTCOMES AT THE INDIVIDUAL AND POPULATION LEVEL WHILE SAVING THE SYSTEM DOLLARS. OUR ENDEAVORS AND LEARNINGS WILL FURTHER BUILD THE EVIDENCE BASE ON HOW TO IMPACT HEALTH OUTCOMES BY ADDRESSING SOCIAL DETERMINANTS OF HEALTH AND INFORM HOW WE ESTABLISH EFFECTIVE HEALTH SYSTEM-COMMUNITY BASED ORGANIZATION COLLABORATIONS WHILE WORKING TOWARD LONG-TERM SUSTAINABILITY. FROM OCTOBER - DECEMBER 2019, 258 FAMILIES RECEIVED RESOURCE SUPPORT THROUGH RESOURCE CONNECT. THE CHILDREN'S HOSPITAL COLORADO FOOD SECURITY COUNCIL (FSC) WAS FORMED IN RESPONSE TO THE NEED FOR CHILDREN'S HOSPITAL TO HAVE A COORDINATED AND EFFECTIVE STRATEGY TO ADDRESS FOOD INSECURITY FOR FAMILIES WHO SEEK CARE HERE AS WELL AS IN THE COMMUNITY. THE MEDICAL LITERATURE TELLS US THAT CHILDHOOD FOOD INSECURITY CAN LEAD TO POOR HEALTH STATUS; INCREASED HOSPITALIZATIONS, DEVELOPMENTAL DELAY, DETRIMENTAL BEHAVIORAL HEALTH EFFECTS AND POOR EDUCATIONAL OUTCOMES. THEREFORE, THE MISSION OF THE FSC IS TO INCREASE ACCESS TO TIMELY, QUALITY, AND AFFORDABLE FOOD FOR KIDS AND THEIR FAMILIES WHO ARE FOOD INSECURE, THROUGH HOSPITAL-BASED PROGRAMMING, EXTERNAL PARTNERSHIPS, AND ADVOCACY. THE HEALTHY ROOTS FOOD CLINIC (HRFC) OPENED IN OCTOBER 2019 AND IS BASED ON THE PRINCIPLE OF FOOD AS MEDICINE AND THE BELIEF THAT HUNGER IS A HEALTH ISSUE. TO PROMOTE AND SUPPORT THE HEALTH OF PATIENTS AND THEIR FAMILIES, THE HRFC PROVIDES NUTRITIOUS FOOD (FRESH AND SHELF STABLE), GUIDANCE ON COMMUNITY RESOURCES AND BASIC NUTRITION AND SAFE FOOD EDUCATION SUPPORT TO THE CHILDREN'S COLORADO HEALTH PAVILION PATIENTS AND THEIR FAMILIES. PATIENTS AND THEIR FAMILIES ARE GIVEN ACCESS TO THE HRFC ONCE PER MONTH FOR UP TO SIX MONTHS IN A YEAR AND RECEIVE 4-5 DAYS' WORTH OF FOOD FOR THE ENTIRE HOUSEHOLD. THIS INITIATIVE IS SUPPORTED THROUGH PARTNERSHIPS WITH FOOD BANK OF THE ROCKIES AND KING SOOPERS. BETWEEN OCTOBER 2019 AND DECEMBER 2019, THE HEALTHY ROOTS FOOD CLINIC DISTRIBUTED 5,181 POUNDS OF NUTRITIOUS FOOD TO PATIENTS AND THEIR FAMILIES REPRESENTING 485 INDIVIDUALS FROM 115 HOUSEHOLDS. HEALTH PROFESSION EDUCATION. AS PART OF OUR MISSION TO IMPROVE THE HEALTH OF CHILDREN, CHILDREN'S HOSPITAL COLORADO OFFERS A BROAD SPECTRUM OF TRAINING, EDUCATION AND CERTIFICATION PROGRAMS AIMED AT DEVELOPING, STRENGTHENING AND SUSTAINING KNOWLEDGE AND EXPERTISE IN THE PEDIATRIC MEDICAL FIELD. WE OFFER A WIDE VARIETY OF ADVANCED TRAINING AND LEARNING OPPORTUNITIES FOR FUTURE HEALTHCARE PROFESSIONALS AND TODAY'S CLINICIANS. THE PROFESSIONAL DEVELOPMENT DEPARTMENT FACILITATES BSN AND GRADUATE EDUCATION FOR NURSING STUDENTS AND WORKS COLLABORATIVELY WITH SCHOOLS OF NURSING TO MEET THEIR ACADEMIC MISSIONS. CHILDREN'S COLORADO'S ADVANCED PRACTICE NURSES (APNS) ACT AS CONTENT EXPERTS IN PROVIDING CLASSROOM/SIMULATED INSTRUCTION FOR PEDIATRIC COURSES. STUDENTS ARE SUPERVISED BY CHILDREN'S HOSPITAL COLORADO CLINICAL SCHOLARS AND ASSISTED AT THE BEDSIDE BY EXPERIENCED STAFF NURSES. THE GROWTH OF THIS PROGRAM EACH YEAR, AS WELL AS THE 10 IN-STATE AND 7 OUT-OF-STATE SCHOOL PARTNERSHIPS, REFLECT CHILDREN'S COLORADO'S STRONG COMMITMENT TO TRAINING THE NEXT GENERATION OF PEDIATRIC NURSES. IN ADDITION, SIXTEEN PROFESSIONAL CONFERENCES CURRENTLY PROVIDE NURSING CONTINUING PROFESSIONAL DEVELOPMENT AND ARE OFFERED TO EXTERNAL/COMMUNITY NURSES AND OTHER LICENSED PROFESSIONALS. ADDITIONALLY, MORE THAN 10 EDUCATIONAL SERIES PROVIDING NCPD WERE OFFERED IN 2019. THESE EDUCATIONAL ACTIVITIES WERE GEARED TOWARD COMMUNITY NURSES AND HEALTHCARE PROFESSIONALS IN SCHOOLS, RURAL HOSPITALS PROVIDING PEDIATRIC CARE RESEARCH. LEADERSHIP AT THE HOSPITAL BELIEVES THAT ADVANCES IN RESEARCH LEAD TO IMPROVED OUTCOMES FOR ALL CHILDREN, THROUGH BOTH TREATMENT AND PREVENTION EFFORTS IN AND OUTSIDE OF HOSPITAL SETTINGS. RESEARCH IN CHILDHOOD DISEASES FORMALLY BEGAN IN 1978 AT CHILDREN'S HOSPITAL COLORADO. TODAY, CHILDREN'S HOSPITAL COLORADO IS NATIONALLY RECOGNIZED FOR ITS EXCELLENCE IN RESEARCH IN THE DISEASES OF THE NEWBORN, CHILD, AND TEEN. AS A NONPROFIT PEDIATRIC HOSPITAL, CHILDREN'S HOSPITAL COLORADO'S MISSION IS TO IMPROVE THE HEALTH OF CHILDREN THROUGH HIGH-QUALITY PATIENT CARE, RESEARCH, EDUCATION AND ADVOCACY. AND BECAUSE RESEARCH AND INNOVATION ARE KEY TO RE-IMAGINING AND REALIZING THE FUTURE OF CHILD HEALTH, WE STARTED OUR CENTER FOR INNOVATION IN 2016. THE CENTER FOR INNOVATION AT CHILDREN'S COLORADO PROVIDES AN OPPORTUNITY FOR INNOVATORS TO COME TOGETHER TO DEVELOP GROUNDBREAKING IDEAS THAT WILL ENRICH AND SAVE LIVES THROUGH BETTER TECHNOLOGY AND HEALTHCARE. MEDICAL FACULTY PROFILE: CHILDREN'S HOSPITAL COLORADO HAS AN OPEN MEDICAL STAFF, MEANING COMMUNITY PRACTITIONERS CAN HOLD PRIVILEGES AT THE HOSPITAL. THERE ARE 2,341 MEDICAL STAFF AND 280 RESIDENTS AND FELLOWS, INCLUDING ADVANCED PRACTICE NURSES, MORE THAN HALF OF WHOM ARE COMMUNITY-BASED. THOUGH THERE ARE THOUSANDS OF REFERRING PROVIDERS ALONG THE FRONT RANGE OF THE ROCKY MOUNTAINS AND THE PRAIRIES, CHILDREN'S COLORADO'S COMMUNITY STAFF MEMBERS ARE ITS FRONT-LINE PARTNERS IN ADVANCING A CONTINUUM OF CARE FOR YOUNG PATIENTS. ITS COMMUNITY CLINICAL STAFF MEMBERS PROVIDE TRAINING OPPORTUNITIES IN PRIMARY CARE FOR MEDICAL STUDENTS AND RESIDENTS. CHILDREN'S HOSPITAL COLORADO IS AFFILIATED WITH FAMILY MEDICINE RESIDENCY PROGRAMS IN COLORADO AND WYOMING, WHICH PROVIDES A SIGNIFICANT BENEFIT TO THE REGION WITH A LARGE RURAL POPULATION AND A SHORTAGE OF RURAL PHYSICIANS. CHILDREN'S HOSPITAL COLORADO ALSO ENSURES THAT THE PRIMARY CARE PERSPECTIVE IS ADDRESSED IN DISCUSSIONS ABOUT HOW TO BEST PROVIDE THE BROADEST SPECTRUM OF CARE TO THE REGION'S CHILDREN.

ADDITIONALLY, CHILDREN'S HOSPITAL COLORADO PROVIDES PATIENT ASSISTANCE TO HELP IDENTIFY COMMUNITY-BASED RESOURCES, FACILITATE SERVICES AND PROVIDE APPROPRIATE REFERRAL ASSISTANCE TO HELP WITH CONTINUITY OF CARE. INPATIENT PROCESS: THIS PROCESS APPLIES TO PATIENTS WHO ARE BEING ADMITTED FOR OBSERVATION, SURGERY OR OTHER INPATIENT SERVICES. IF THE PATIENT IS PRE-SCHEDULED, CHILDREN'S HOSPITAL COLORADO PATIENT ACCESS WORKS TO CONTACT THE FAMILY PRIOR TO ADMISSION TO ARRANGE FOR A FINANCIAL SCREENING APPOINTMENT. REGARDLESS OF WHETHER AN APPOINTMENT IS SET PRIOR TO ADMISSION, THE PATIENT FINANCIAL COUNSELING TEAM WORKS WITH THE FAMILY TO DETERMINE THEIR SELF-PAY STATUS (EITHER NON-COMMERCIAL OR GOVERNMENT INSURANCE) AND SUBSEQUENTLY WORKS WITH THEM TO SCREEN FOR FINANCIAL ASSISTANCE OPTIONS. OUTPATIENT PROCESS: WHEN A PATIENT SCHEDULES A NON-EMERGENT OR URGENT OUTPATIENT CLINIC VISIT, THEY WILL IDENTIFY THEMSELVES AS SELF-PAY IF THEY DO NOT HAVE EITHER COMMERCIAL OR GOVERNMENT INSURANCE. AT THIS POINT, THEY ARE GIVEN TWO OPTIONS: (1) PAY A $200 DEPOSIT AT THE TIME OF APPOINTMENT AND BE BILLED ANY REMAINING BALANCE OR (2) SCHEDULE TIME WITH PATIENT FINANCIAL COUNSELING FOR ASSISTANCE.

CHCO IS COMMITTED TO IMPROVING THE HEALTH OF CHILDREN THROUGH THE PROVISION OF HIGH-QUALITY, COORDINATED PROGRAMS OF PATIENT CARE, EDUCATION, RESEARCH AND ADVOCACY. CHILDREN'S HOSPITAL COLORADO WORKS TO DELIVER ON THIS MISSION NOT ONLY IN THE DENVER METRO AREA AND IN THE STATE OF COLORADO, BUT ALSO THROUGHOUT THE ROCKY MOUNTAIN REGION. THERE ARE EXTENSIVE EFFORTS LED BY CHILDREN'S HOSPITAL COLORADO THAT POSITIVELY IMPACT THE HEALTH AND SAFETY OF CHILDREN IN THE COMMUNITY. THE PROGRAMS INITIATIVES DESCRIBED IN THIS SECTION DEMONSTRATE THE BROAD RANGE OF ACTIVITIES IN WHICH CHCO HAS INVESTED TO IMPACT THE HEALTH PRIORITIES IDENTIFIED IN OUR COMMUNITY HEALTH NEEDS ASSESSMENT. THESE PROGRAMS EXEMPLIFY THE TYPE OF WORK THAT CHCO LEADS, SUPPORTS OR PARTNERS WITH OTHERS TO ACHIEVE IMPROVED OUTCOMES FOR CHILDREN AND FAMILIES IN COLORADO. ALL OF THE PROGRAMS, FOR EXAMPLE, ARE EVIDENCE-BASED AND DESIGNED TO ENGAGE AND BE INFORMED BY COMMUNITY MEMBERS AND PARTNER ORGANIZATIONS. DUE TO THE NUMBER OF PROGRAMS AND INITIATIVES THAT ARE PART OF LARGER COMMUNITY EFFORTS, THE OUTLINED PROGRAMS DO NOT CONSTITUTE AN EXHAUSTIVE LIST OF ACTIVITIES IN WHICH CHCO HAS INVESTED TO ADDRESS HEALTH PRIORITIES. HIGHLIGHTS OF THIS WORK IN 2019 INCLUDE: IDENTIFIED HEALTH PRIORITY: ASTHMA AND RESPIRATORY CARE. ASTHMA IS THE MOST COMMON CHRONIC DISEASE IN CHILDREN, AFFECTING 7.5% OF ALL CHILDREN IN THE UNITED STATES. SEVERE CHILDHOOD ASTHMA IS ALSO A SIGNIFICANT ECONOMIC BURDEN ON OUR HEALTHCARE SYSTEM, ACCOUNTING FOR UP TO 50% OF THE ESTIMATED $10 BILLION ANNUAL TOTAL COSTS FOR CHILDHOOD ASTHMA. INEQUITIES ARE SEEN IN ASTHMA PREVALENCE, TREATMENT, AND OUTCOMES; IT IS MORE COMMON IN BLACK CHILDREN AND IN CHILDREN WHO LIVE BELOW 250% OF THE POVERTY LINE. BLACK AND LATINO CHILDREN ARE LESS LIKELY TO RECEIVE PREVENTIVE CARE AND MORE LIKELY TO VISIT THE ED AND BE HOSPITALIZED THAN WHITE CHILDREN. STUDIES INDICATE THAT THE DISPARITIES IN ASTHMA MORBIDITY AND MORTALITY AMONG MINORITY POPULATIONS AND UNDER-RESOURCED COMMUNITIES ARE LARGELY DUE TO VARIATIONS IN SOCIAL DETERMINANTS OF HEALTH; THUS, ADDRESSING THESE FACTORS MAY BE PIVOTAL IN IMPROVING CLINICAL OUTCOMES IN ASTHMA. ASTHMA HOME VISITS HAVE BEEN SHOWN TO BE AN EFFECTIVE MECHANISM TO DELIVER TAILORED, CULTURALLY APPROPRIATE ASTHMA EDUCATION WHILE ALSO ADDRESSING BARRIERS TO ASTHMA CARE. JUST KEEP BREATHING IS AN ASTHMA HOME VISIT PROGRAM BASED AT CHCO IN WHICH HEALTH NAVIGATORS PROVIDE HOME-BASED ASTHMA MANAGEMENT EDUCATION AND SUPPORT TAILORED TO EACH ENROLLED PATIENT AND THEIR FAMILY. NAVIGATORS HELP INCREASE PATIENT AND FAMILY ENGAGEMENT IN ASTHMA CARE AND ADDRESS PATIENT-IDENTIFIED BARRIERS TO CARE BY FOCUSING ON SIX PRIMARY TASKS WITH FAMILIES: CONNECTION TO CARE; FACILITATION OF COMMUNICATION BETWEEN PRIMARY CARE PROVIDERS, SPECIALISTS, AND SCHOOLS; BARRIER IDENTIFICATION AND RESOURCE PROVISION; ASTHMA EDUCATION; HOME ENVIRONMENTAL ASSESSMENT AND REMEDIATION; AND MEDICATION ADHERENCE. SUPPORT PROVIDED TO EACH FAMILY VARIES BASED ON BARRIERS IDENTIFIED BUT COMMONLY INCLUDES MEDICATION DEVICE TECHNIQUE TEACHING, HELP WITH APPLICATIONS FOR BENEFITS (E.G., MEDICAID AND WIC PAPERWORK), AND REMEDIATION SUPPLIES SUCH AS HEPA-FILTER VACUUMS, SAFE CLEANING SUPPLIES, AND PEST EXTERMINATION SERVICES. IDENTIFIED HEALTH PRIORITY: PREMATURITY. COLORADO FACES ONE OF THE HIGHEST PRETERM BIRTH RATES OF ANY STATE IN THE NATION. CHCO HAS INVESTED IN IMPROVING BOTH PROVIDER AND COMMUNITY AWARENESS OF THE FACTORS THAT PUT A MOTHER AT RISK OF PRETERM DELIVERY WILL HELP TO DECREASE PREMATURITY IN OUR STATE. THIS INCLUDES CONFRONTING BIAS AND THE SYSTEMIC RACISM THAT ARE DRIVING FACTORS IN THIS PERVASIVE HEALTH DISPARITY. SPECIFICALLY, IN COLORADO, PREMATURITY AND INFANT MORTALITY RATES FOR NON-HISPANIC BLACK BABIES ARE ALMOST THREE TIMES HIGHER THAN RATES FOR NON-HISPANIC WHITE BABIES. THE BLACK HEALTH INITIATIVE SEEKS TO ADDRESS THE SOCIAL ISOLATION AND TOXIC STRESS STEMMING FROM INSTITUTIONAL RACISM, AND THE INCIDENCES OF PRE-TERM BIRTH AND INFANT MORTALITY RATES AMONG US-BORN BLACK MOTHERS AND THEIR FAMILIES THROUGH FOUR STRATEGIC FOCUS AREAS: SOCIAL CONNECTEDNESS; AWARENESS AND EDUCATION; POLICY AND SYSTEMS CHANGE; AND PATIENT-PROVIDER RELATIONSHIPS. TO INFORM THE WORK OF THE BLACK HEALTH INITIATIVE, 68 AFRICAN AMERICAN WOMEN WITHIN THE DESIGNATED TARGETED AREA HAD OPPORTUNITY TO PARTICIPATE IN DINNER TALK/FOCUS GROUPS, 10% OF WHOM HAD EXPERIENCED A PRETERM BIRTH OR INFANT DEATH WITHIN THE DEFINED 2-YEAR PERIOD OF MORTALITY. LEARNING OF THE DISCREPANCIES IN INFANT MORTALITY AND PRE-TERM BIRTHS AFFECTING THE STABILITY OF THEIR FAMILY AND COMMUNITY, THESE WOMEN COMMITTED TO ASSIST IN FURTHER PROGRAMMING SUITED TO MEET IDENTIFIED PRIORITY HEALTH CARE NEEDS. IT ALSO INTENDED TO PROVIDE A SAFE PLACE FOR AFRICAN AMERICAN WOMEN IN THE COMMUNITY TO TELL THEIR STORIES AND DISCUSS ADDITIONAL ISSUES THAT AFFECTED THE OUTCOMES OF SUCCESSFUL PREGNANCIES AND INFANT SURVIVAL. THROUGH THE COLLABORATIVE EFFORTS OF FAMILY FORWARD RESOURCE CENTER, GUERRILLA MAMAS, LLC, AND THE DAWN CLINIC, WE HAVE BEEN ABLE TO ESTABLISH A WELL-ROUNDED GROUP OF HEALTH CARE PROFESSIONALS AND COMMUNITY ADVOCATES WHO ARE COMMITTED TO FURTHERING THE WORK OF RAISING HEALTHY BABIES AND SAVING OUR CHILDREN. FROM THESE SESSIONS AND A SPECIFIC NAMING COMMITTEE, THE KINDRED MAMAS MENTORSHIP PROGRAM FOR AFRICAN AMERICAN WOMEN, AS PART OF THE BLACK HEALTH INITIATIVE HAS BEEN BORN. WOMEN IN THIS COMMUNITY NOW HAVE A PLACE WHERE THEY CAN CONNECT WITH OTHER WOMEN WHO HAVE WALKED SIMILAR PATHS. IDENTIFIED HEALTH PRIORITY: NUTRITION, PHYSICAL ACTIVITY AND OBESITY. WHILE COLORADO IS TYPICALLY VIEWED AS A HEALTHY, FIT AND ACTIVE STATE, THE REALITY IS THAT WE FACE SUBSTANTIAL CHALLENGES WITH NUTRITION, PHYSICAL ACTIVITY, AND OBESITY. NEARLY ONE QUARTER OF OUR STATE'S CHILDREN ARE OVERWEIGHT OR OBESE, AND VULNERABLE POPULATIONS HAVE SIGNIFICANTLY HIGHER RATES OF OBESITY. WHILE NUTRITION AND PHYSICAL ACTIVITY ARE DISTINCT ISSUES, THEY ARE ALSO CLOSELY CORRELATED WITH OBESITY AND WE HAVE THEREFORE DECIDED TO THINK OF THEM AS A CONNECTED SET OF CONCERNS. WITH FEWER THAN HALF OF CHILDREN IN THE STATE GETTING THE RECOMMENDED 60 MINUTES OF DAILY PHYSICAL ACTIVITY AND ONLY 1 IN 8 CONSUMING 3 OR MORE SERVINGS OF VEGETABLES A DAY, WE KNOW THAT THERE IS A GREAT DEAL OF WORK TO BE DONE. OUR RECENT ACCOMPLISHMENTS IN THIS AREA INCLUDE IMPLEMENTING PEAK CHAMPIONS, A CAMP PROGRAM FOR LOW-INCOME, UNDERSERVED YOUTH WHO ARE OVERWEIGHT OR OBESE. THE PROGRAM, WHICH RUNS IN THE SUMMER TO HELP CHILDREN WHO ARE OVERWEIGHT AND OBESE, INCORPORATES PHYSICAL ACTIVITY AND NUTRITION CURRICULUM TO ENGAGE YOUTH IN CONTINUOUS PHYSICAL ACTIVITY WHILE LEARNING ABOUT GOAL SETTING, TEAMWORK, CULINARY SKILLS AND HEALTHY LIFESTYLES. IN 2019, CHCO ALSO CREATED TRAIN-THE-TRAINER MATERIALS, MAKING THE PEAK CHAMPIONS CONTENT ACCESSIBLE TO OTHER ORGANIZATIONS (PRIMARILY SCHOOLS) INTERESTED IN IMPLEMENTING THE PROGRAM. IDENTIFIED HEALTH PRIORITY: INJURY PREVENTION. UNINTENTIONAL INJURY IS THE LEADING CAUSE OF DEATH FOR CHILDREN BETWEEN THE AGES OF 1 AND 24 IN COLORADO. INJURY IS ALSO THE LEADING CAUSE OF HOSPITALIZATION FOR CHILDREN AGES 1 TO 14 IN OUR STATE, WITH FALLS AND MOTOR VEHICLE ACCIDENTS AS THE MOST FREQUENT INCIDENTS. CHILDREN'S HOSPITAL COLORADO HAS A LONG-STANDING COMMITMENT TO WORKING WITH THE COMMUNITY (E.G. CONVENING AND LEADING GROUPS LIKE SAFE KIDS COLORADO) TO PREVENT INJURY AND TO HELP KEEP KIDS SAFE. CHILD PASSENGER SAFETY (CPS) CONTINUES TO BE A HALLMARK OF CHCO'S INJURY PREVENTION WORK, AS WE CONTINUE TO FACILITATE THE PROVISION AND SAFE INSTALLATION OF CAR SEATS BY CERTIFIED CPS TECHNICIANS. MOREOVER, WE HAVE COMPLETED THOUSANDS OF CAR SEAT INSPECTIONS AND HAVE TRAINED DOZENS OF COMMUNITY PARTNERS ON CHILD PASSENGER SAFETY AND PARTNERED WITH COMMUNITY GROUPS AND SCHOOLS STATEWIDE TO PROVIDE SAFE DRIVING TRAINING TO TEENS. IDENTIFIED HEALTH PRIORITY: MENTAL AND BEHAVIORAL HEALTH. MORE THAN 80% OF YOUTH WHO DIE BY SUICIDE HAVE SEEN THEIR PRIMARY CARE PROVIDER WITHIN A YEAR OF THEIR DEATH, MANY WITHIN THE PREVIOUS MONTH. THIS INDICATES A SIGNIFICANT OPPORTUNITY TO BETTER EQUIP PROVIDERS WITH THE KNOWLEDGE AND RESOURCES TO IDENTIFY AND TREAT WARNING SIGNS. PCMH IS COORDINATING WITH NATIONAL, STATE, AND LOCAL THOUGHT LEADERS TO CREATE A SUICIDE PREVENTION STRATEGY THAT INCLUDES THE EVIDENCE BASED ZERO SUICIDE MODEL AND A PEDIATRIC CARE PATHWAY FOCUSED ON UNIVERSAL SUICIDE SCREENING OF ALL PEDIATRIC PATIENTS. AS PART OF THIS WORK, PCMH PARTNERED WITH THE ZERO SUICIDE INSTITUTE TO HOST A FIRST-OF-ITS-KIND ZERO SUICIDE ACADEMY FOCUSED ON YOUTH SUICIDE PREVENTION IN PRIMARY CARE.

RESEARCH HAS CONTINUALLY SHOWN THAT WHEN THE FACTORS INFLUENCING HEALTH ARE EXPLORED, HEALTH CARE ACTUALLY PLAYS THE SMALLEST ROLE PROPORTIONATELY. A REPORT IN THE JOURNAL OF AMERICAN MEDICAL ASSOCIATION AND THE CENTER FOR DISEASE CONTROL (MCGINNIS, 1996) SUGGESTS THAT THE FACTORS IMPACTING HEALTH ARE AS FOLLOWS: LIFESTYLE AND BEHAVIORS, 50%, ENVIRONMENT (HUMAN AND NATURAL), 20%, GENETICS AND HUMAN BIOLOGY, 20%, AND HEALTH CARE, 10%. COMMUNITY BUILDING ACTIVITIES HELP TO ADDRESS THE OTHER INDICATORS OUTSIDE OF THE ROLE TRADITIONALLY PLAYED BY HEALTH-CARE ORGANIZATIONS. THESE ACTIVITIES ARE ALMOST EXCLUSIVELY DONE IN SOME FORM OF PARTNERSHIP IN WHICH THE COMMUNITY OR OTHER ORGANIZATIONS ARE BETTER SUITED TO ADDRESS. HEALTH-CARE ORGANIZATIONS GENERALLY PROVIDE TIMELY AND SPECIFIC RESOURCES TO HELP THESE ISSUES. HEALTH-CARE ORGANIZATIONS CAN BE A RICH AND VALUABLE COMMUNITY RESOURCE IN WAYS NOT TYPICALLY CONSIDERED. OFTEN THE MOST EFFECTIVE WAY TO HELP IMPACT AND IMPROVE THE COMMUNITY HEALTH STATUS IS TO SUPPORT OTHER AGENCIES AND ORGANIZATIONS IN A VARIETY OF WAYS OUTSIDE OF HEALTH SERVICES. THIS IS OFTEN DONE THROUGH CASH OR IN-KIND SERVICES TO SUPPORT OTHER NON-PROFITS, DONATIONS OF DURABLE MEDICAL EQUIPMENT AND SUPPLIES TO CERTAIN AGENCIES, OR THROUGH LEADERSHIP AND EDUCATIONAL EXPERTISE. THE HOSPITAL CONTRIBUTES FINANCIALLY TO A WIDE VARIETY OF COMMUNITY ORGANIZATIONS THAT ADDRESS THE BROADER NEEDS OF THE COMMUNITY. THESE DONATIONS ALLOW OTHER NON-PROFIT ORGANIZATIONS TO FULFILL THEIR MISSIONS TO IMPROVE THE WELL BEING OF THE COMMUNITY AND CONTRIBUTE TO ITS OVERALL HEALTH STATUS IN WAYS THAT MAY DIFFER FROM THE DIRECT SERVICES OF THE HOSPITAL ORGANIZATION AND MAXIMIZE THE RESOURCES THEY HAVE TO WORK WITH.

HOWEVER THE MEDICARE COST REPORT DISALLOWS CERTAIN ITEMS THAT WE BELIEVE ARE LEGITIMATE EXPENSES INCURRED IN THE PROCESS OF CARING FOR OUR MEDICARE PATIENTS. EXAMPLES OF THESE ITEMS INCLUDE PROVIDER BASED PHYSICIAN EXPENSE, SELF INSURANCE EXPENSE, HOME OFFICE EXPENSE AND THE SHORTFALL FROM FEE SCHEDULE PAYMENTS. IN ADDITION TO THESE ITEMS THE MEDICARE COST REPORT AND THE COST ACCOUNTING SYSTEM DO NOT INCLUDE MEDICARE PHYSICIAN FEE SCHEDULE EXPENSE AND OFFSETTING REVENUE.THE HOSPITAL BELIEVES THE ENTIRE AMOUNT OF THE MEDICARE SHORTFALL SHOULD BE TREATED AS COMMUNITY BENEFIT, MORE SPECIFICALLY, AS CHARITY CARE. THE ELDERLY CONSTITUTE A CLEARLY-RECOGNIZED CHARITABLE CLASS, AND MANY MEDICARE BENEFICIARIES, LIKE THEIR MEDICAID COUNTERPARTS, ARE POOR AND THUS WOULD HAVE QUALIFIED FOR THE HOSPITAL'S CHARITY CARE PROGRAM, MEDICAID OR OTHER NEEDS-BASED GOVERNMENT PROGRAMS ABSENT THE MEDICARE PROGRAM. BY ACCEPTING PAYMENT BELOW COST TO TREAT THESE INDIVIDUALS, THE BURDENS OF GOVERNMENT ARE RELIEVED WITH RESPECT TO THESE INDIVIDUALS. ADDITIONALLY, THERE IS A SIGNIFICANT POSSIBILITY THAT CONTINUED REDUCTION IN REIMBURSEMENT MAY ACTUALLY CREATE DIFFICULTIES IN ACCESS FOR THESE INDIVIDUALS. FINALLY, THE AMOUNT SPENT TO COVER THE MEDICARE SHORTFALL IS MONEY NOT AVAILABLE TO COVER CHARITY CARE AND OTHER COMMUNITY BENEFIT NEEDS."

202031959349301138,240862246,"PART III, LINE 8 - MEDICARE EXPLANATION","PART III, LINE 3 - BAD DEBT: MEDICARE COSTS WERE DERIVED FROM THE MEDICARE COST REPORT AND THE COST ACCOUNTING SYSTEM. THE ORGANIZATION BELIEVES THAT MEDICARE UNDERPAYMENTS (SHORTFALL) AND THE COST OF BAD DEBT ARE COMMUNITY BENEFIT AND SHOULD BE INCLUDED ON FORM 990, SCHEDULE H, PART I. AS OUTLINED MORE FULLY BELOW, THE ORGANIZATION BELIEVES THAT THESE SERVICES AND RELATED COSTS PROMOTE THE HEALTH OF THE COMMUNITY AS A WHOLE AND ARE RENDERED IN CONJUNCTION WITH THE ORGANIZATION'S CHARITABLE TAX-EXEMPT PURPOSES AND MISSION IN PROVIDING MEDICALLY NECESSARY HEALTHCARE SERVICES TO ALL INDIVIDUALS IN A NON- DISCRIMINATORY MANNER WITHOUT REGARD TO RACE, COLOR, CREED, SEX, NATIONAL ORIGIN, RELIGION OR ABILITY TO PAY AND IS CONSISTENT WITH THE COMMUNITY BENEFIT STANDARD PROMULGATED BY THE IRS. THE COMMUNITY BENEFIT STANDARD IS THE CURRENT STANDARD FOR A TAX-EXEMPT AND CHARITABLE ORGANIZATION UNDER THE INTERNAL REVENUE CODE (""IRC"") 501(C)(3). SATISFYING THE ""COMMUNITY BENEFIT STANDARD,"" AS ARTICULATED BY THE INTERNAL REVENUE SERVICE (IRS) IN REVENUE RULING 69-545, IS CURRENTLY REQUIRED FOR A HOSPITAL TO BE RECOGNIZED AS A CHARITABLE ORGANIZATION UNDER INTERNAL REVENUE CODE (IRC) 501(C)(3). THIS RULING REMOVED THE PREVIOUS REQUIREMENT OF REVENUE RULING 56-185, KNOWN AS THE ""CHARITY CARE STANDARD,"" THAT IN ORDER TO BE A CHARITABLE ORGANIZATION, A HOSPITAL HAD TO PROVIDE, TO THE EXTENT OF ITS FINANCIAL ABILITY, FREE OR REDUCED-COST CARE TO PATIENTS UNABLE TO PAY FOR THEIR CARE. THIS EARLIER RULING EMPHASIZED THAT A LOW LEVEL OF CHARITY CARE DID NOT MEAN THAT A HOSPITAL WAS CHARITABLE SINCE THAT LEVEL COULD REFLECT THE HOSPITAL'S FINANCIAL ABILITY TO PROVIDE SUCH CARE. REVENUE RULING 56-185 ALSO NOTED THAT PUBLICLY SUPPORTED COMMUNITY HOSPITALS WOULD NORMALLY QUALIFY AS CHARITABLE BECAUSE THEY SERVE THE ENTIRE COMMUNITY AND A LOW LEVEL OF CHARITY CARE WOULD NOT IMPACT A HOSPITAL'S CHARITABLE STATUS IF IT WAS DUE TO THE SURROUNDING COMMUNITY'S LACK OF CHARITABLE DEMANDS. AS DEVELOPED IN REVENUE RULING 69-545, UNDER THE COMMUNITY BENEFIT STANDARD, HOSPITALS WERE JUDGED ON WHETHER THEY PROMOTE THE HEALTH OF A BROAD CLASS OF INDIVIDUALS IN THE COMMUNITY. THIS RULING INVOLVED A HOSPITAL THAT ONLY ADMITTED THOSE WHO COULD PAY FOR THE SERVICES EITHER BY THEMSELVES, THROUGH PRIVATE INSURANCE OR PUBLIC PROGRAMS SUCH AS MEDICARE. IN ADDITION, THE HOSPITAL OPERATED A FULL-TIME EMERGENCY ROOM THAT WAS OPEN TO EVERYONE. THE IRS RULED THAT THE HOSPITAL WAS CHARITABLE BECAUSE IT PROMOTED THE HEALTH OF PEOPLE IN ITS COMMUNITY. THE IRS REASONED THAT BECAUSE THE PROMOTION OF HEALTH WAS A CHARITABLE PURPOSE ACCORDING TO THE GENERAL LAW OF CHARITY, IT FELL WITHIN THE ""GENERALLY ACCEPTED LEGAL SENSE"" OF THE TERM CHARITABLE, AS REQUIRED BY TREASURY REGULATION SECTION 1.501 (C)(3)-1(D)(2). THE IRS RULED THAT THE PROMOTION OF HEALTH, LIKE RELIEF OF POVERTY AND THE ADVANCEMENT OF EDUCATION AND RELIGION, IS ONE OF THE PURPOSES OF THE GENERAL LAW OF CHARITY THAT IS DEEMED BENEFICIAL TO THE COMMUNITY AS A WHOLE EVEN THOUGH THE CLASS OF BENEFICIARIES ELIGIBLE TO RECEIVE A DIRECT BENEFIT FROM ITS ACTIVITIES DOES NOT INCLUDE ALL MEMBERS OF THE COMMUNITY, SUCH AS INDIGENT MEMBERS OF THE COMMUNITY, PROVIDED THAT THE CLASS IS NOT SO SMALL THAT ITS RELIEF IS NOT OF BENEFIT TO THE COMMUNITY. THE IRS CONCLUDED THAT THE HOSPITAL WAS ""PROMOTING THE HEALTH OF A CLASS OF PERSONS THAT IS BROAD ENOUGH TO BENEFIT THE COMMUNITY"" BECAUSE ITS EMERGENCY ROOM WAS OPEN TO ALL AND IT PROVIDED CARE TO THOSE WHO COULD PAY, WHETHER DIRECTLY OR THROUGH THIRD-PARTY REIMBURSEMENT. OTHER FACTORS THAT DEMONSTRATED COMMUNITY BENEFIT INCLUDED: SURPLUS FUNDS WERE USED TO IMPROVE PATIENT CARE, EXPAND FACILITIES AND ADVANCE MEDICAL TRAINING, EDUCATION AND RESEARCH; AND IT WAS CONTROLLED BY A BOARD OF DIRECTORS THAT CONSISTED OF INDEPENDENT CIVIC LEADERS. THE AMERICAN HOSPITAL ASSOCIATION (""AHA"") BELIEVES THAT MEDICARE UNDERPAYMENTS (SHORTFALLS) AND BAD DEBT SHOULD BE REPORTED AS COMMUNITY BENEFIT ON FORM 990, SCHEDULE H, PART I, LINE 7. THIS ORGANIZATION AGREES WITH THE AHA'S LETTER TO THE IRS DATED AUGUST 21, 2007 RESPONDING TO A DRAFT OF THE NEW FORM 990 AND SCHEDULE H, THE AHA ARGUED THAT MEDICARE UNDERPAYMENTS (SHORTFALLS) IS COMMUNITY BENEFIT FOR THE FOLLOWING REASONS: -PROVIDING CARE FOR THE ELDERLY AND SERVING MEDICARE PATIENTS REMAINS AN ESSENTIAL PART OF THE COMMUNITY BENEFIT STANDARD. -MEDICARE, LIKE MEDICAID, DOES NOT PAY THE FULL COST OF CARE. RECENTLY, MEDICARE REIMBURSES ONLY 92 CENTS FOR EVERY DOLLAR HOSPITALS SPEND TO CARE FOR MEDICARE PATIENTS. -MANY MEDICARE PATIENTS, LIKE THEIR MEDICAID COUNTERPARTS, ARE POOR. MORE THAN 46% OF MEDICARE SPENDING IS FOR BENEFICIARIES WHOSE INCOME IS BELOW 200% OF THE FEDERAL POVERTY LEVEL. MANY ARE ALSO ELIGIBLE FOR MEDICAID, SO CALLED -DUAL ELIGIBLES"". PENNSYLVANIA REQUIRES NON-PROFIT HOSPITALS TO PROVIDE A MINIMUM LEVEL OF COMMUNITY BENEFIT TO RETAIN EXEMPTION FROM STATE AND LOCAL TAXES. ACCORDING TO STATE GUIDANCE AND CASE LAW, THE UNREIMBURSED COST OF MEDICARE AND BAD DEBT IS CONSIDERED TO BE COMMUNITY BENEFIT FOR STATE TAX EXEMPTION PURPOSES. PART III, LINE 6 ONLY INCLUDES THOSE COSTS THAT ARE PERMITTED TO BE REPORTED IN THE HOSPITAL'S MEDICARE COST REPORT THAT IS REQUIRED TO BE FILED WITH THE FEDERAL GOVERNMENT. THE HOSPITAL CONSIDERS THE TOTAL MEDICARE UNDERPAYMENTS (SHORTFALL) OF 32,894,201 SHOULD BE REPORTED AS COMMUNITY BENEFIT ON THE FORM 990, SCHEDULE H, PART I, LINE 7. ALONG WITH PROVIDING CARE TO MEDICAID PATIENTS AND PROVIDING FREE OR DISCOUNTED CARE TO OTHER LOW INCOME PATIENTS, THE IRS COMMUNITY BENEFIT STANDARD INCLUDES THE PROVISION OF CARE TO THE ELDERLY AND MEDICARE PATIENTS. LIKE MEDICAID, MEDICARE DOES NOT PAY THE FULL COST OF PROVIDING CARE TO THESE PATIENTS, FORCING THE HOSPITAL TO USE OTHER FUNDS TO COVER THE SHORTFALL. MEDICARE SHORTFALLS MUST BE ABSORBED BY THE HOSPITAL IN ORDER TO CONTINUE TREATING THE ELDERLY IN OUR COMMUNITIES. THE HOSPITAL PROVIDES CARE REGARDLESS OF THE MEDICARE SHORTFALL AND IS THEREBY PROVIDING ACCESS TO MEDICAL SERVICES FOR THE ELDERLY AND RELIEVING THE FEDERAL GOVERNMENT OF THE BURDEN OF PAYING THE FULL COST FOR PROVIDING CARE TO MEDICARE PATIENTS. ABSENT THE MEDICARE PROGRAM, IT IS LIKELY THAT MANY MEDICARE PATIENTS WOULD BE ELIGIBLE FOR CHARITY CARE OR OTHER NEED BASED GOVERNMENT PROGRAMS. THE AMOUNT EXPENDED TO COVER THE SHORTFALL IS MONEY NOT AVAILABLE FOR FINANCIAL ASSISTANCE AND OTHER COMMUNITY BENEFIT NEEDS. BOTH THE HOSPITAL AND THE AHA BELIEVE THAT PATIENT BAD DEBT BE REPORTED AS A COMMUNITY BENEFIT ON FORM 990, SCHEDULE H, PART I, LINE 7. LIKE MEDICARE UNDERPAYMENTS (SHORTFALLS), BAD DEBT SHOULD BE REPORTED AS COMMUNITY BENEFIT BECAUSE: -A SIGNIFICANT PORTION OF BAD DEBT IS ATTRIBUTABLE TO LOW-INCOME PATIENTS, WHO FOR MANY REASONS DECLINE TO COMPLETE THE FORMS REQUIRED TO ESTABLISH ELIGIBILITY UNDER THE HOSPITAL'S CHARITY CARE OR FINANCIAL ASSISTANCE POLICY (FAP). A 2006 CONGRESSIONAL BUDGET OFFICE (""CBO""), ""NONPROFIT HOSPITALS AND THE PROVISION OF COMMUNITY BENEFIT"", CITED TWO STUDIES INDICATING THAT ""THE GREAT MAJORITY OF BAD DEBT WAS ATTRIBUTABLE TO PATIENTS WITH INCOMES BELOW 200% OF THE FEDERAL POVERTY LINE."" -THE CBO REPORT ALSO NOTED THAT A SUBSTANTIAL PORTION OF THE BAD DEBT IS PENDING CHARITY CARE. UNLIKE BAD DEBT IN OTHER INDUSTRIES, HOSPITAL BAD DEBT IS COMPLICATED BY THE FACT THAT HOSPITALS FOLLOW THEIR CHARITABLE MISSION TO THE COMMUNITY AND TREAT EVERY PATIENT THAT COMES THROUGH THE EMERGENCY DEPARTMENT, REGARDLESS OF ABILITY TO PAY. PATIENTS WHO HAVE OUTSTANDING BILLS ARE NOT TURNED AWAY, UNLIKE OTHER INDUSTRIES. BAD DEBT IS FURTHER COMPLICATED BY THE AUDITING INDUSTRY'S STANDARDS ON REPORTING CHARITY CARE. MANY PATIENTS CANNOT OR DO NOT PROVIDE THE NECESSARY DOCUMENTATION REQUIRED TO BE DEEMED CHARITY CARE BY AUDITORS. AS A RESULT, ACCORDING TO THE CBO REPORT, ROUGHLY 40% OF BAD DEBT IS PENDING CHARITY CARE. (IN FY 2019, APPROXIMATELY 15% OF THE HOSPITAL'S BAD DEBT WAS SUBSEQUENTLY RECLASSIFIED TO CHARITY CARE.) THE CBO CONCLUDED THAT ITS FINDINGS ""SUPPORT THE VALIDITY OF THE USE OF UNCOMPENSATED CARE (BAD DEBT AND CHARITY CARE) AS A MEASURE OF COMMUNITY BENEFITS"" ASSUMING THE FINDINGS ARE GENERALIZED NATIONALLY. THE EXPERIENCE OF HOSPITALS NATIONWIDE REINFORCE THAT THEY ARE GENERALIZABLE. AS OUTLINED BY THE AHA, DESPITE THE HOSPITAL'S BEST EFFORTS AND DUE DILIGENCE, PATIENT BAD DEBT IS A PART OF THE CHARITABLE MISSION AND CHARITABLE PURPOSES. BAD DEBT REPRESENTS PART OF THE BURDEN HOSPITALS' BEAR IN SERVING ALL PATIENTS REGARDLESS OF RACE, COLOR, CREED, SEX, NATIONAL ORIGIN, RELIGION OR ABILITY TO PAY. IN ADDITION, THE HOSPITAL INVESTS SIGNIFICANT RESOURCES IN SYSTEMS AND STAFF TRAINING TO ASSIST PATIENTS THAT ARE IN NEED OF FINANCIAL ASSISTANCE. FOR FISCAL YEAR ENDED 6/30/2019, THE HOSPITAL'S COST OF PROVIDING PATIENT CARE FOR SERVICES ACCOUNTED FOR AS BAD DEBT WAS 1,642,038."

IT IS THE HOSPITAL'S POLICY TO PROVIDE FINANCIAL ASSISTANCE AND COUNSELING TO PATIENTS WITH LIMITED FINANCIAL MEANS. A PATIENT MAY BECOME ELIGIBLE FOR FINANCIAL ASSISTANCE AT ANY TIME DURING TREATMENT OR DURING THE CONTINUUM OF THE FINANCIAL/BILLING AND COLLECTION PROCESS. IN ANY STAGE OF THE BILLING PROCESS, COLLECTION ACTIONS ARE NOT PURSUED WHENEVER A PATIENT APPLIES AND IS BEING EVALUATED FOR FINANCIAL ASSISTANCE. UNDER NO CIRCUMSTANCES WILL THE HOSPITAL FREEZE OR ATTACH BANK ACCOUNTS OF A PATIENT, ENFORCE LIENS, ACTIVELY PURSUE ASSETS FROM A PRIOR JUDGMENT OR GARNISH THE WAGES OF A PATIENT AND/OR FAMILY MEMBER BEFORE DETERMINING IF THE PATIENT IS ELIGIBLE FOR ASSISTANCE UNDER THE HOSPITAL'S FINANCIAL ASSISTANCE PROGRAM.

ALL MEDICALLY NECESSARY HOSPITAL SERVICES ARE PROVIDED WITHOUT CONSIDERATION OF ABILITY TO PAY AND ARE NOT DELAYED PENDING APPLICATION OR APPROVAL OF MEDICAL ASSISTANCE OR THE GEISINGER FINANCIAL ASSISTANCE PROGRAM. ADVANCE PAYMENT IS NOT REQUIRED FOR ANY MEDICALLY NECESSARY SERVICES.

THE NORTHEAST REGION IS COMPRISED OF THREE COUNTIES AND IS SERVED BY FIVE OF THE CHNA COLLABORATING HOSPITALS, INCLUDING GEISINGER COMMUNITY MEDICAL CENTER. THE NORTHEAST REGION POPULATION IS PRIMARILY WHITE, BUT DIVERSITY IS INCREASING. THE WHITE POPULATION AS A PERCENTAGE OF THE TOTAL POPULATION IS DECLINING IN ALL COUNTIES, WHILE BLACK/AFRICAN AMERICAN AND HISPANIC/LATINO POPULATIONS ARE GROWING. THE DEMOGRAPHIC SHIFT IS A STATEWIDE REND. MINORITY POPULATIONS ARE THE ONLY GROWING DEMOGRAPHIC IN PENNSYLVANIA. THE HISPANIC/LATINO POPULATION IS ONE OF THE FASTEST GROWING DEMOGRAPHIC GROUPS; LUZERNE COUNTY IS PROJECTED TO EXPERIENCE THE GREATEST INCREASE IN THE POPULATION BY 2022. PENNSYLVANIA FARES BETTER THAN THE NATION ON MOST ECONOMIC INDICATORS. PENNSYLVANIA RESIDENTS ARE LESS LIKELY TO LIVE IN POVERTY, HAVE A SIMILAR UNEMPLOYMENT RATE AS THE NATION'S AVERAGE, AND ARE MORE LIKELY TO HAVE ATTAINED AT LEAST A HIGH SCHOOL DIPLOMA.

RACIAL AND ETHNIC MINORITY GROUPS LIKE BLACK/AFRICAN AMERICAN OR HISPANIC/LATINO RESIDENTS ARE MORE LIKELY TO BE IMPACTED BY ADVERSE SOCIOECONOMIC FACTORS, INCLUDING POVERTY, UNEMPLOYMENT, OR EDUCATION ATTAINMENT. POVERTY IS ONE OF THE BIGGEST DRIVERS OF DISPARITY, PARTICULARLY IN LACKAWANNA AND LUZERNE COUNTIES. POVERTY RATES AMONG MINORITY POPULATIONS ARE DOUBLE THE RATES AMONG WHITES. SOCIOECONOMIC DISPARITY CONTRIBUTES TO WORSE HEALTH OUTCOMES. BECAUSE POPULATION COUNTS FOR MINORITY RESIDENTS ACROSS THE REGION ARE LOW, HEALTH DISPARITIES ARE PRIMARILY EVIDENCED BY STATE AND NATIONAL TRENDS. THE 2017 POPULATION OF THE NORTHEAST REGION IS 589,689. LUZERNE COUNTY COMPRISES THE LARGEST PORTION OF THE POPULATION (54%), FOLLOWED BY LACKAWANNA COUNTY (37%). COUNTY POPULATIONS ARE EXPECTED TO REMAIN STABLE WITH INCREASES OR DECREASES OF APPROXIMATELY 1% BY 2022. THE NORTHEAST REGION POPULATION IS PRIMARILY WHITE, BUT INCREASINGLY DIVERSE. THE PERCENTAGE OF WHITE RESIDENTS DECREASED FROM 2010 TO 2017, AND IS PROJECTED TO DECREASE THROUGH 2022. THE PERCENTAGE OF RESIDENTS IDENTIFYING AS BLACK/AFRICAN AMERICAN AND/OR HISPANIC/LATINO IS INCREASING. CONSISTENT WITH THE DEMOGRAPHICS OF THE SERVICE AREA, RESIDENTS ARE MORE LIKELY TO SPEAK ENGLISH AS THEIR PRIMARY LANGUAGE WHEN COMPARED TO THE STATE AND THE NATION. PENNSYLVANIA HAS A HIGHER MEDIAN AGE THAN THE NATION. THE MEDIAN AGE OF THE NORTHEAST REGION COUNTIES EXCEEDS THE STATE. WAYNE COUNTY HAS THE HIGHEST MEDIAN AGE, EXCEEDING THE STATE MEDIAN BY 7 POINTS. ECONOMIC INDICATORS VARY ACROSS THE REGION. LACKAWANNA COUNTY MIRRORS THE NATION FOR RESIDENTS LIVING IN POVERTY, DESPITE HAVING A LOWER MEDIAN HOUSEHOLD INCOME. LUZERNE COUNTY HAS THE LOWEST MEDIAN HOUSEHOLD INCOME IN THE REGION; RESIDENTS ARE MORE LIKELY TO LIVE IN POVERTY AND RECEIVE FOOD STAMP BENEFITS. WAYNE COUNTY HAS THE HIGHEST MEDIAN HOUSEHOLD INCOME IN THE REGION; RESIDENTS ARE THE LEAST LIKELY TO LIVE IN POVERTY OR RECEIVE FOOD STAMP BENEFITS. NORTHEAST REGION COUNTIES HAVE A MORE PROMINENT BLUE COLLAR WORKFORCE AND A LOWER OR COMPARABLE UNEMPLOYMENT RATE COMPARED TO THE STATE AND THE NATION. WAYNE COUNTY HAS THE LOWEST UNEMPLOYMENT RATE AND THE HIGHEST PERCENTAGE OF BLUE COLLAR WORKERS. HOMEOWNERSHIP IS A MEASURE OF HOUSING AFFORDABILITY AND ECONOMIC STABILITY. HOUSEHOLDERS IN ALL SERVICE COUNTIES ARE MORE LIKELY TO OWN THEIR HOME WHEN COMPARED TO THE NATION; HOUSEHOLDS IN WAYNE COUNTY ARE ALSO MORE LIKELY TO OWN THEIR HOME WHEN COMPARED TO THE STATE. WAYNE COUNTY HAS A HIGHER MEDIAN HOUSEHOLD INCOME AND HIGHER MEDIAN HOME VALUE WHEN COMPARED TO THE STATE AND THE NATION. EDUCATION IS THE LARGEST PREDICTOR OF POVERTY AND ONE OF THE MOST EFFECTIVE MEANS OF REDUCING INEQUALITIES. ACROSS ALL COUNTIES, THE PERCENTAGE OF RESIDENTS ATTAINING LESS THAN A HIGH SCHOOL DIPLOMA IS ON PAR WITH THE STATE AND LOWER THAN THE NATION. RESIDENTS ARE MORE LIKELY TO HAVE A HIGH SCHOOL DIPLOMA THAN A BACHELOR'S DEGREE OR HIGHER WHEN COMPARED TO BOTH THE STATE AND THE NATION."

Nonetheless, the Medicare program, in many cases, does not provide payment that covers the full cost of the care provided. Since it is the mission of the hospital to respond to community need, hospital leadership continually advocates for improved Medicare payment so that the cost of quality care to those patients who are not able to afford it is not compromised and is fairly subsidized by all payers. The IRS does not classify this shortfall in Medicare payments as Community Benefit. However, we believe it is an important contribution made by the hospital to the health and well-being of the community. If the Medicare program did not exist, many Medicare patients would be eligible for financial assistance or other means-tested government programs. Further, by absorbing this shortfall and providing care below cost to these individuals, St. John's Hospital is relieving the burden of the government. Accordingly, this shortfall restricts St. John's Hospital's ability to make funds available to provide for financial assistance and other Community Benefit. The hospital Medicare shortfall at cost for fiscal year 2020 was $39,563,259."

If the patient qualified for charity/community care for the full balance of their account, the entire amount is written off to charity/community care and hence no debt collection is pursued. If the patient qualified for charity/community care for a portion of their account balance, that portion is written off to charity/community care, with the patient being responsible for the remainder of the balance. Additionally, reasonable effort will be made to obtain third-party or government payer reimbursement on behalf of the patient. If those efforts are not fruitful, an offer will be extended to the patient to make installment payments on their balance. Only at such point that the patient defaults on installment payments or refuses to cooperate with the hospital's efforts to be reimbursed will the account be sent to collections. The hospital will make reasonable efforts to determine whether a patient is eligible under the financial assistance policy before it engages in an ECA. To the extent a patient is determined to be eligible for financial assistance under the FAP, the hospital will take all reasonably available measures to reverse any ECA taken against the patient to obtain payment for the care."

Patients are also provided a Fair Billing Act notification at the point of registration regarding separate physician billing they can expect to receive, plus information about the patient's financial responsibility if their insurance plan is out of network. One-on-one conversations to educate patients about financial assistance often stem from patients receiving a statement or a pre-collection letter. At that point, the customer service representative or cashier, or other qualified staff, will inform/educate the caller about financial assistance options. The first pre-collection letter reminds the patient their account is in delinquent status. It also informs them they may be eligible for financial assistance through the organization's charity care program. The letter provides direct contact information to begin the application process for charity care and lists the Internet address where the policy can be obtained.

Additionally, St. John's provides tertiary care to residents of Bond, Brown, Clay, Coles, De Witt, Effingham, Fayette, Greene, Marion, Mason, Moultrie, Piatt, Pike, Schuyler and Shelby counties. Aside from the city of Springfield, the economy of St. John's service area is primarily rural and is supported by small businesses, industries, mining and agriculture. Springfield, on the other hand, is an urban area supported by large businesses, such as the Illinois State Government and other industries. Based on 2017 population estimates derived from the 2010 census, Sangamon County's population of 196,452 people is comprised of 82.4 percent Caucasians, 12.9 percent African Americans, 0.5 percent American Indians/Alaska Natives, 2.0 percent Asians and 2.3 percent Hispanic or Latino. Ninety two percent of Sangamon County's residents over 25 have a high school diploma or higher.

Founded in 1875, the hospital brings a healing presence and improves the health of our community, especially those persons who are sick, poor, and disadvantaged. Because of the hospital's mission and heritage, the hospital is dedicated to promoting the health of Springfield and surrounding areas. The hospital is governed by a Board of Directors, most of whom reside in the hospital's primary service area and are neither employees nor independent contractors of the hospital (nor family members thereof). The Board ensures that St. John's Hospital is responding to community need. The hospital also has a Patient and Family Advisory Council, Foundation Board, Caregiver Interfaith Volunteer Services Committee, and Samaritan Volunteers that help the hospital connect with the community. Consistent with its exempt purpose, St. John's Hospital has an open medical staff with privileges available to all qualified physicians in the area. The hospital also operates an emergency department that is open 24 hours to all persons regardless of their ability to pay. As a not-for-profit hospital, St. John's Hospital reinvests surplus funds to support the mission of the organization and promote the health of the community rather than distributing surplus funds as profits to shareholders or individuals. Funds not committed to ongoing operations are generally used to upgrade facilities, secure new technologies, improve patient care, and support initiatives designed to promote health and ensure access for all, provide medical education and conduct medical research. For example, St. John's Hospital provided $510,310 for financial counselors to assist patients and community members in accessing charity care, signing up for Medicare / Medicaid, and enrolling through the Marketplace. Additionally, St. John's provided $142,796 to support community health worker programs to meet high risk, underserved patients and community members in their home. St. John's provided $408,697 for medical research and $12,092,722 for medical education. St. John's Hospital also devotes significant resources to access for patients who cannot afford care, along with other Community Benefits. In FY2020, St. Johns' Hospital provided $51,360,205 million in Community Benefit, including financial assistance at cost, unpaid costs of Medicaid and other public programs, and a range of diverse programs designed to enhance access and improve community health. Additionally, in FY2020, St. John's provided $105,580 in in-kind staff time to support the public health command center in response to the COVID-19 Pandemic. St. John's Hospital provides a range of Community Benefit initiatives and programs that further our mission and long-standing commitment to our community. In many cases, these Community Benefits would not exist without the leadership role played by St. Johns' Hospital and they often relieve a burden that would otherwise be carried by government."

HSHS is sponsored by Hospital Sisters Ministries (HSM), which is a public juridic person of the Roman Catholic Church. HSHS continues the health care ministries begun by its founders, the Hospital Sisters of St. Francis, more than 140 years ago, in rural and midsized communities throughout Illinois and Wisconsin. HSHS provides compassionate, holistic, high quality, and cost-effective health care through its acute care hospitals, physician practices, home health programs, palliative and hospice programs, and community outreach services. In addition, HSHS affiliated hospitals include critical access facilities that offer essential health services that otherwise would not be available in many communities. Our mission calls us to reveal and embody Christ's healing love for all people, and we extend our high quality Franciscan health care ministry beyond the walls of our hospitals by providing community health improvement services with special emphasis on the poor and vulnerable. In addition to providing community health improvement services to the broader community, HSHS cares for everyone who comes to its facilities, regardless of their ability to pay. In tandem with a variety of cross sector community partners, HSHS's Community Benefit initiatives are strategically planned and professionally implemented to improve access to health care services; enhance the health of the community; advance medical or general health care knowledge; and relieve or reduce the burden of government to improve health. The COVID-19 pandemic caused an unprecedented disruption in healthcare services across the United States. HSHS responded with services that benefited our communities, including free telehealth screenings, free testing, and coordination with other healthcare providers in the communities we serve to best ensure access to needed care. In FY2020, HSHS collectively provided $244.0 million in Community Benefit (10.0% of total hospital expenses) including more than $1 million in response to the pandemic. Of the total Community Benefit provided, HSHS spent $26.9 million provided for Financial Assistance (aka Charity Care) and $173.3 million for unreimbursed care provided as part of the Medicaid program. In addition, HSHS hospitals committed significant resources to treat Medicare patients. The cost of providing services to primarily elderly beneficiaries of the Medicare program - in excess of governmental and managed care contract payments - was $183.9 million. HSHS hospitals also recorded $26.4 million in uncollectible accounts. While HSHS does not count the latter two amounts as Community Benefit, they nonetheless reflect our commitment to serving all persons in need of care. In addition to the dollars invested in our Community Benefit programs, HSHS continues to reinvest any surplus revenue from operations and investments into new medical technology, facility infrastructure and health care services in our communities. By doing so, we ensure our ability to meet the ongoing demand for high quality, efficient and easily accessible health care."

For accounts receivable associated with services provided to patients who have third-party coverage, the System estimates net realizable value based on the estimated contractual reimbursement percentage, which in turn is based on current contract provisions and historical paid claims by payor. For self-pay accounts, including uninsured and patient responsibility accounts, the net realizable value is determined using historical collection experience, adjusted for estimated conversion of patient responsibility portions, expected recoveries and changes in trends to estimate implicit price concessions. Management continually reviews the estimated net realizable value of accounts receivable by monitoring cash collections, economic conditions and trends, changes in payor mix, changes in federal or state healthcare coverage and other matters. The System grants credit without collateral to its patients, most of whom are local residents and are insured under third-party payor agreements, primarily with Medicare, Medicaid and various commercial insurance companies. The System records accounts receivable net of estimated price concessions and such amounts have historically been within managements expectations. The mix of accounts receivable at December 31, 2019, from patients and third-party payors is as follows Medicare - 27, Medicaid - 17, Blue Cross - 24, Commercial, managed care and other - 26, Patients - 6, totaling 100."

THE HOSPITAL'S GOAL WAS TO CREATE A FINANCIAL AID PROGRAM CONSISTENT WITH THE MISSION, VALUES AND CAPACITY OF THE HOSPITALS, WHILE CONSIDERING AN INDIVIDUAL'S ABILITY TO CONTRIBUTE TO HIS OR HER CARE. THE HOSPITALS HAVE A DISCOUNT POLICY AND PROVIDES DISCOUNTS TO UNINSURED PATIENTS.

THE ESTIMATED POPULATION OF THE PRIMARY ZIP CODES IS 100,500, REPRESENTING APPROXIMATELY 50% OF THE TOTAL YONKERS POPULATION. THE PRIMARY SERVICE AREA POPULATION IS MORE CULTURALLY AND ETHNICALLY DIVERSE THAN THE CITY OF YONKERS AND EXPERIENCES GREATER SOCIOECONOMIC DISPARITY. THE AREA IS AN URBAN MIX OF HIGH-RISE APARTMENTS, OLDER WOOD FRAME HOMES, AND A DOWNTOWN BUSINESS AREA THAT CONTAINS COMMUNITY-BASED NOT-FOR-PROFIT ORGANIZATIONS. ZIP CODES 10701 AND 10705 ARE SOME OF THE MOST POPULATION DENSE AREAS IN NEW YORK STATE WITH A POPULATION DENSITY OF 23,372 PER SQUARE MILE. THE POPULATION DENSITY FOR ALL OF YONKERS IS 10,903 RESIDENTS PER SQUARE MILE.

THE 2017 ESTIMATED COUNTY POPULATION OF 949,113 IS UP 3.0% BETWEEN 2000 AND 2010. THE COUNTY SEAT IS THE CITY OF WHITE PLAINS. OTHER MAJOR CITIES INCLUDE YONKERS, NEW ROCHELLE, AND MOUNT VERNON. THE 2017 MEDIAN HOUSEHOLD INCOME FOR WESTCHESTER COUNTY ($89,968) IS THE FOURTH HIGHEST IN NEW YORK STATE AFTER NASSAU, PUTNAM AND SUFFOLK COUNTIES.YONKERS IS 18.4 SQUARE MILES WITH AN ESTIMATED POPULATION OF 200,999. THE POPULATION INCREASED 3% BETWEEN 2010 AND 2017. APPROXIMATELY 18% OF RESIDENTS ARE UNDER 15 YEARS AND 16% ARE SENIORS. THE YONKERS COMMUNITY IS ONE OF THE MOST CULTURALLY AND ETHNICALLY DIVERSE IN WESTCHESTER COUNTY AND NEW YORK STATE. DURING THE LAST TWO DECADES, A DEMOGRAPHIC SHIFT HAS TAKEN PLACE IN THE CITY WITH A LARGE INFLUX OF IMMIGRANTS. APPROXIMATELY 31% OF THE YONKERS POPULATION IS FOREIGN-BORN; 56% OF FOREIGN BORN RESIDENTS WERE BORN IN A LATIN AMERICAN COUNTRY. IMMIGRANTS FROM ALL OVER THE WORLD BRING A GREAT VITALITY TO OUR COMMUNITY, BUT THEY CHALLENGE THE HOSPITAL AND OTHER COMMUNITY SERVICE PROVIDERS TO UNDERSTAND AND MEET THEIR UNIQUE AND COMPLEX HEALTH NEEDS."

RESEARCH HAS CONTINUALLY SHOWN THAT WHEN THE FACTORS INFLUENCING HEALTH ARE EXPLORED, HEALTH CARE ACTUALLY PLAYS THE SMALLEST ROLE PROPORTIONATELY. A REPORT IN THE JOURNAL OF AMERICAN MEDICAL ASSOCIATION AND THE CENTER FOR DISEASE CONTROL (MCGINNIS, 1996) SUGGESTS THAT THE FACTORS IMPACTING HEALTH ARE AS FOLLOWS: LIFESTYLE AND BEHAVIORS, 50%, ENVIRONMENT (HUMAN AND NATURAL), 20%, GENETICS AND HUMAN BIOLOGY, 20%, AND HEALTH CARE, 10%. COMMUNITY BUILDING ACTIVITIES HELP TO ADDRESS THE OTHER INDICATORS OUTSIDE OF THE ROLE TRADITIONALLY PLAYED BY HEALTH-CARE ORGANIZATIONS. THESE ACTIVITIES ARE ALMOST EXCLUSIVELY DONE IN SOME FORM OF PARTNERSHIP IN WHICH THE COMMUNITY OR OTHER ORGANIZATIONS ARE BETTER SUITED TO ADDRESS. HEALTH-CARE ORGANIZATIONS GENERALLY PROVIDE TIMELY AND SPECIFIC RESOURCES TO HELP THESE ISSUES. HEALTH-CARE ORGANIZATIONS CAN BE A RICH AND VALUABLE COMMUNITY RESOURCE IN WAYS NOT TYPICALLY CONSIDERED. OFTEN THE MOST EFFECTIVE WAY TO HELP IMPACT AND IMPROVE THE COMMUNITY HEALTH STATUS IS TO SUPPORT OTHER AGENCIES AND ORGANIZATIONS IN A VARIETY OF WAYS OUTSIDE OF HEALTH SERVICES. THIS IS OFTEN DONE THROUGH CASH OR IN-KIND SERVICES TO SUPPORT OTHER NON-PROFITS, DONATIONS OF DURABLE MEDICAL EQUIPMENT AND SUPPLIES TO CERTAIN AGENCIES, OR THROUGH LEADERSHIP AND EDUCATIONAL EXPERTISE. METHODIST CONTRIBUTES TO MANY AREA COMMUNITY BUILDING ACTIVITIES IN CENTRAL ILLINOIS. THESE ORGANIZATIONS HELP BUILD ACTIVITIES IN THE AREAS OF ECONOMIC AND HEALTHCARE IMPROVEMENT.

The University of Miami Hospital and Clinics (UMHC) is a Prospective Payment System (PPS) exempt hospital and, as such, is cost based reimbursed for both inpatient and outpatient services. For inpatient services, the limit is the TEFRA target limit. The hospital, on occasion, exceeds the target rate and does not receive full cost reimbursement. The TEFRA target amount is updated by the Medicare program annually by the TEFRA updating factor. However, the amount of the TEFRA updating factor is always significantly less than the actual healthcare inflation factor because the Medicare program includes a ""budget neutrality"" factor for the overall Medicare program. For outpatient services, the limit is the payment to cost ratio (PCR). The PCR was established using a base year, which was 1996, at a rate of 85.5% of cost. The PCR for all PPS-exempt cancer centers was 88% through 12/31/19, and then 89% from 1/1/20 to 5/31/20; therefore, the hospital currently does not receive payment for 11-12% of its outpatient cost."

Miami-Dade is the seventh largest county in the US and represents 12.6% of Florida's population. It is one of the few counties in the United States that is ""minority-majority,"" in that a racial/ethnic minority group comprises the majority of the population with approximately 69.4% Latino or Hispanic residents; 17.7% black, non-Hispanic; 12.9% white, non-Hispanic; 1.6% Asian; 0.3% American Indian and Alaska Native. 53.7% of Miami-Dade's population are foreign-born, more than double that of the state. Miami-Dade County has a relatively young population with 83.3% of persons under age 65 and 20.2% under the age of 18. In Miami Dade County, 15.7% of all individuals live below the federal poverty level, with a median household income of $51,347 as compared to 12.7% and 55,600 respectively in the State of Florida. The SocioNeeds Index, developed by the Conduent Healthy Communities Institute, is a measure of socioeconomic need calculated from several social and economic factors, ranging from poverty to education, which may impact health and/or access to care. The Index is correlated with potentially preventable hospitalization rates related to chronic conditions, diabetes, and obesity. Index values range from 0 to 100, in which 100 represents communities with the greatest socioeconomic need. The median score for Miami-Dade County is 67.7 out of 100, which is indicative of poor health outcomes due to high needs within the community. The SocioNeeds Index further confirms the socioeconomic disparities observed among residents of Miami-Dade County. In addition to the SocioNeeds Index, a rank measure is calculated by comparing the SocioNeeds Index of all zip codes in Miami-Dade County (a rank of 5 represents high need, while a rank of 1 represents low need). More than one-third (36.3%) of Miami-Dade County residents live in ZIP codes identified as those with the ""greatest need"" (5). More than two-thirds (67.5%) of residents reside in ZIP codes with a SocioNeeds Index score of a three (3) or higher. In 2019, the ten leading causes of death in Miami-Dade County were heart disease, cancer, stroke, Alzheimer's disease, chronic lower respiratory disease, unintentional injury, diabetes, Parkinson's Disease, nephritis/nephrotic syndrome and nephrosis, and hypertension; seven of which are explicityly addressed in our Community Health Needs Assessment."

PATIENT ACCOUNTS RECEIVABLE ARE STATED AT NET REALIZABLE VALUE. ANSHN EVALUATES THE COLLECTABILITY OF ITS ACCOUNTS RECEIVABLE BASED ON THE LENGTH OF TIME THE RECEIVABLE IS OUTSTANDING, PAYER CLASS, HISTORICAL COLLECTION EXPERIENCE, AND TRENDS IN HEALTH CARE INSURANCE PROGRAMS. ACCOUNTS RECEIVABLE ARE CHARGED TO THE ALLOWANCE FOR UNCOLLECTIBLE ACCOUNTS WHEN THEY ARE DEEMED UNCOLLECTIBLE.THE COSTING METHODOLOGY USED IN DETERMINING THE AMOUNTS REPORTED ON LINES 2 AND 3 IS BASED ON THE RATIO OF PATIENT CARE COST TO CHARGES. THE UNREIMBURSED COST OF BAD DEBT WAS CALCULATED BY APPLYING THE ORGANIZATION'S COST TO CHARGE RATIO FROM THE MEDICARE COST REPORTS (CMS 2252-96 WORKSHEET C, PART 1, PPS INPATIENT RATIOS) TO THE ORGANIZATION'S BAD DEBT PROVISION PER GENERALLY ACCEPTED ACCOUNTING PRINCIPLES, LESS ANY PATIENT OR THIRD PARTY PAYOR PAYMENTS RECEIVED.ADVOCATE MAKES EVERY EFFORT TO IDENTIFY THOSE PATIENTS WHO ARE ELIGIBLE FOR FINANCIAL ASSISTANCE BY STRICTLY ADHERING TO ITS FINANCIAL ASSISTANCE POLICY. WE BELIEVE THAT ADVOCATE HAS A POPULATION OF PATIENTS WHO ARE UNINSURED OR UNDERINSURED BUT WHO DO NOT COMPLETE THE FINANCIAL ASSISTANCE APPLICATION. THE ESTIMATED AMOUNT OF BAD DEBT EXPENSE (AT COST) WHICH COULD BE REASONABLY ATTRIBUTABLE TO PATIENTS WHO WOULD LIKELY QUALIFY FOR FINANCIAL ASSISTANCE UNDER THE ORGANIZATION'S FINANCIAL ASSISTANCE POLICY, IF SUFFICIENT INFORMATION HAD BEEN AVAILABLE TO MAKE A DETERMINATION OF THEIR ELIGIBILITY, WAS BASED UPON SELF PAY PATIENT ACCOUNTS WHICH HAD AMOUNTS WRITTEN OFF TO BAD DEBTS. OUR METHOD WAS TO BEGIN WITH THE SELF-PAY PORTION OF BAD DEBT EXPENSE PROVISION. THE SELF PAY PORTION EXCLUDES THOSE PATIENTS WHO HAD FINANCIAL ASSISTANCE APPLICATIONS PENDING AT THE TIME OF SERVICE. THIS COST WAS THEN REDUCED BY CHARGES IDENTIFIED AS TRUE BAD DEBT EXPENSE, INCLUDING COPAYS FOR PATIENTS WHO QUALIFIED FOR LESS THAN 100% FINANCIAL ASSISTANCE. THE COST TO CHARGE RATIO WAS THEN APPLIED TO THE REMAINING CHARGES, TO DETERMINE THE VALUE (AT COST) OF PATIENT ACCOUNTS THAT DID NOT COMPLETE FINANCIAL COUNSELING AND WERE ASSIGNED TO BAD DEBT. WE BELIEVE THIS PROCESS IS A REASONABLE BASIS FOR OUR ESTIMATE. AS WE ARE ONLY CONSIDERING SELF-PAY ACCOUNTS WRITTEN OFF TO BAD DEBT FOR THIS ESTIMATE, THIS ESTIMATE DOES NOT INCLUDE THE IMMEDIATE 25% DISCOUNT TO CHARGES WHICH IS APPLIED TO ALL SELF-PAY PATIENTS. IT ALSO DOES NOT INCLUDE ACCOUNT BALANCES OR CO-PAYS OF NON-SELF PAY ACCOUNTS WHICH ARE WRITTEN OFF TO BAD DEBT WHEN THE PATIENT HAS NO OTHER FINANCIAL RESOURCES TO PAY THESE AMOUNTS AND THE PATIENT DOES NOT APPLY FOR FINANCIAL ASSISTANCE.BAD DEBT AMOUNTS HAVE BEEN EXCLUDED FROM OTHER COMMUNITY BENEFIT AMOUNTS REPORTED THROUGHOUT SCHEDULE H."

THE MEDICAL CENTER'S PSA CONSISTS OF 21 COMMUNITIES IN COOK COUNTY INCLUDING FORT DEARBORN (60610), NORTH CENTER (60613), LINCOLN PARK (60614), AVONDALE/NORTH CENTER (60618), WICKER PARK (60622), RAVENSWOOD (60625), ROGERS PARK (60626), JEFFERSON PARK (60630), DUNNING (60634), BELMONT CRAGIN (60639), UPTOWN (60640), IRVING PARK/PORTAGE PARK (60641), WICKER PARK (60642), AVALON PARK/NORTH (60645), LOGAN SQUARE (60647), DIVISION STREET (60651), LAKEVIEW (60657), WEST RIDGE (60659), ROGERS PARK (60660), OLD TOWN/NEAR NORTH SIDE (60610) AND ELMWOOD (60707 AND 60635). THE TOTAL POPULATION FOR THE PSA IS 1,186,360. THE POPULATION SLIGHTLY DECREASED BY 0.05 PERCENT FROM 2010 TO 2019. SOCIAL DETERMINANTS OF HEALTH (SDOH). ADVOCATE ILLINOIS MASONIC'S ASSESSMENT PROCESS UTILIZED THE CONDUENT HEALTHY COMMUNITIES INSTITUTE'S (HCI) SOCIONEEDS INDEX IN ORDER TO UNDERSTAND THE SOCIAL CONTEXT THAT EXISTS IN THE DEFINED COMMUNITY THAT DEEPLY INFLUENCES HEALTH. THE SOCIONEEDS INDEX IS A CONDUENT HCI INDICATOR THAT IS A MEASURE OF SOCIOECONOMIC NEED, CORRELATED WITH POOR HEALTH OUTCOMES. THE INDEX IS CALCULATED FROM SIX INDICATORS, ONE EACH FROM THE FOLLOWING AREAS: POVERTY, INCOME, UNEMPLOYMENT, OCCUPATION, EDUCATION AND LANGUAGE. THE INDICATORS ARE WEIGHTED TO MAXIMIZE THE CORRELATION OF THE INDEX WITH PREMATURE DEATH RATES AND PREVENTABLE HOSPITALIZATION RATES. ALL ZIP CODES, COUNTIES, AND COUNTY EQUIVALENTS IN THE U.S. ARE GIVEN AN INDEX VALUE FROM 0 (LOW NEED) TO 100 (HIGH NEED). TO HELP IDENTIFY THE AREAS OF HIGHEST NEED WITHIN A DEFINED GEOGRAPHIC AREA, THE SELECTED ZIP CODES ARE RANKED FROM ONE (LOW NEED) TO FIVE (HIGH NEED) BASED ON THEIR INDEX VALUE. THESE VALUES ARE SORTED FROM LOW TO HIGH AND DIVIDED INTO FIVE RANKS. THESE RANKS ARE THEN USED TO COLOR THE ZIP CODES WITH THE HIGHEST SOCIONEEDS INDEXES WITH THE DARKER COLORS. THE MEDICAL CENTER HAS SEVERAL COMMUNITIES WITHIN THE PSA THAT HAVE GREATER SOCIOECONOMIC NEEDS COMPARED TO OTHER COMMUNITIES IN THE PSA. BELMONT CRAGIN AND HUMBOLDT PARK ARE THE PSA'S HIGHEST SOCIONEED COMMUNITIES AND ARE RANKED AS FIVES IN THE SOCIONEEDS INDEX MAP. THESE TWO COMMUNITIES EXPERIENCE HIGHER RATES OF CHRONIC DISEASE AND UNEMPLOYMENT, AND HAVE SOME OF THE LOWEST MEDIAN HOUSEHOLD INCOMES IN THE PSA. DEMOGRAPHICSAGE.

SOON THEREAFTER WORK BEGAN TO ALIGN THE COMMUNITY STRATEGIES OF BOTH PREDECESSOR ORGANIZATIONS. IN OCTOBER 2019, THE ADVOCATE AURORA BOARD APPROVED A COMMUNITY STRATEGY THAT WOULD SUPPORT ORGANIZATIONAL VALUES AND CONTINUE TO SUPPORT SYSTEM-WIDE PROGRAMS THAT ADDRESS THE HEALTH NEEDS OF PATIENTS, FAMILIES AND THE COMMUNITIES SERVED BY ADVOCATE AURORA. GIVEN THAT ADVOCATE AND AURORA HAVE SEPARATE FEIN'S, THE NARRATIVE THAT FOLLOWS PRIMARILY DESCRIBES PROGRAMS AND ACTIVITIES PERTAINING TO ADVOCATE (AAH ILLINOIS). AS BACKGROUND, ADVOCATE AURORA HEALTH'S ILLINOIS HOSPITALS (ADVOCATE) ARE NOT-FOR-PROFIT AND ARE RELATED TO BOTH THE EVANGELICAL LUTHERAN CHURCH IN AMERICA AND THE UNITED CHURCH OF CHRIST. ADVOCATE'S BOARD, LEADERSHIP AND TEAM MEMBERS (STAFF/EMPLOYEES) ARE COMMITTED TO POSITIVELY AFFECTING THE HEALTH STATUS AND QUALITY OF LIFE OF INDIVIDUALS AND POPULATIONS IN COMMUNITIES SERVED BY THE ORGANIZATION THROUGH PROGRAMS AND PRACTICES THAT SUPPORT THE ADVOCATE AURORA VISION OF ""WE HELP PEOPLE LIVE WELL."" ADVOCATE AURORA'S SYSTEM LEADERSHIP HAS HISTORICALLY AND CURRENTLY DIRECTS AND SUPPORTS THE HOSPITALS IN THEIR EFFORTS TO ADDRESS IDENTIFIED COMMUNITY HEALTH NEEDS. IN 2016, A COMMUNITY HEALTH DEPARTMENT WAS DEVELOPED BY ADVOCATE, LED BY A SYSTEM EXECUTIVE AND STAFFED WITH PUBLIC/COMMUNITY HEALTH SPECIALISTS, TO EXECUTE COMMUNITY NEEDS ASSESSMENTS, EVIDENCE-BASED PROGRAM DEVELOPMENT AND COLLABORATIVE PARTNERSHIPS WITHIN THE COMMUNITIES SERVED BY ADVOCATE. PRIOR TO THIS TIME, THE COMMUNITY FACING FUNCTION WAS LED BY A TEAM OF ADVOCATE SYSTEM-LEVEL INDIVIDUALS WHOSE JOB RESPONSIBILITIES INCLUDED VARIOUS COMMUNITY ROLES MORE CLOSELY ALIGNED WITH COMMUNITY RELATIONS. DURING THE INITIAL 2011-2013 CHNA CYCLE, ADVOCATE'S SYSTEM LEADERS PROVIDED OVERSIGHT AND SUPPORT TO THE HOSPITALS FOR DEVELOPING THEIR CHNAS AND SUBSEQUENT PROGRAMMING. IN 2016, ADVOCATE'S NEW COMMUNITY HEALTH TEAM CONDUCTED THEIR HOSPITAL COMPREHENSIVE CHNAS (2014-2016) AND POSTED GOVERNANCE-APPROVED CHNA REPORTS AND CHNA IMPLEMENTATION PLANS ON ADVOCATE'S WEBPAGE IN COMPLIANCE WITH THE AFFORDABLE CARE ACT. FOLLOWING THE MERGER OF ADVOCATE HEALTH CARE AND AURORA HEALTH CARE IN 2018 AND BOARD APPROVAL OF THE NEW COMMUNITY STRATEGY IN 2019, ALL ADVOCATE HOSPITALS' COMMUNITY HEALTH IMPLEMENTATION PLANS ARE GUIDED BY THE AAH COMMUNITY STRATEGY. THROUGH THIS STRATEGY, WE WILL BUILD HEALTH EQUITY, ENSURE ACCESS AND IMPROVE HEALTH OUTCOMES IN OUR COMMUNITIES THROUGH EVIDENCE-INFORMED SERVICES AND INNOVATIVE PARTNERSHIPS BY ADDRESSING MEDICAL NEEDS AND SOCIAL DETERMINANTS. BASED ON NEED AND EFFECT ON HEALTH EQUITY, AS IDENTIFIED IN ADVOCATE AURORA'S 27 HOSPITAL CHNA REPORTS AND IN INDUSTRY LITERATURE, ADVOCATE PRIORITIZED THE FOLLOWING SIX FOCUS AREAS ON WHICH THE INDIVIDUAL HOSPITAL COMMUNITY HEALTH IMPLEMENTATION PLANS ARE BUILT AND SUPPORT, INCLUDING: 1) ACCESS/PRIMARY MEDICAL HOMES; 2) ACCESS/ BEHAVIORAL HEALTH SERVICES; 3) COMMUNITY SAFETY; 4) WORKFORCE DEVELOPMENT; 5) AFFORDABLE HOUSING; AND 6) FOOD SECURITY.ADVOCATE'S BOARD, SYSTEM LEADERSHIP AND TEAM MEMBERS ARE FULLY ENGAGED IN PROGRAMS AND ACTIVITIES THAT SUPPORT SYSTEM AND SITE EFFORTS IN ACHIEVING MILESTONES IN EACH OF THESE COMMUNITY STRATEGY FOCUS AREAS. EXAMPLES OF AFFILIATED SYSTEM PROGRAMS/SERVICES THAT ALIGN WITH THE ORGANIZATION'S COMMUNITY STRATEGY AND SUPPORT EFFORTS TO ADDRESS THESE KEY FOCUS AREAS ARE PROVIDED IN THE FOLLOWING NARRATIVE.1. ACCESS/PRIMARY MEDICAL HOMES. THE FIRST OF SIX KEY AREAS TARGETED BY ADVOCATE'S COMMUNITY STRATEGY IS IMPROVING ACCESS/CONNECTING PATIENTS TO PRIMARY MEDICAL HOMES. ADVOCATE IS COMMITTED TO UNDERTAKING AND SUPPORTING INITIATIVES THAT ENHANCE ACCESS TO HEALTH CARE, INCLUDING FINANCIAL ASSISTANCE, CARE COORDINATION, LANGUAGE ASSISTANCE, CULTURALLY SENSITIVE PROVISION OF CARE, AND PREVENTION EDUCATION AND WELLNESS SERVICES ACROSS THE LIFESPAN AND WITHIN THE DIVERSE COMMUNITIES ADVOCATE SERVES. FINANCIAL ASSISTANCE. ADVOCATE OFFERS A VERY GENEROUS FINANCIAL ASSISTANCE PROGRAM, REQUIRING NO PAYMENTS FROM THE PATIENTS MOST IN NEED, AND PROVIDING DISCOUNTS TO UNINSURED AND INSURED PATIENTS. FROM JANUARY 2019 TO MAY 2019, UNINSURED PATIENTS EARNING UP TO SIX TIMES THE FEDERAL POVERTY LEVEL (FPL), AND INSURED PATIENTS EARNING UP TO FOUR TIMES THE FPL WERE ELIGIBLE TO BE CONSIDERED FOR A FULL OR PARTIAL FINANCIAL ASSISTANCE DISCOUNT. AS OF JUNE 2019, PATIENTS EARNING UP TO SIX TIMES THE FPL, AND INSURED PATIENTS EARNING UP TO TWO AND HALF TIMES THE FPL MAY QUALIFY FOR A FULL OR PARTIAL FINANCIAL ASSISTANCE DISCOUNT. ADDITIONALLY, A CATASTROPHIC ASSISTANCE DISCOUNT WAS ADDED FOR UNINSURED AND INSURED PATIENTS WHOSE INCOMES EXCEED THE TRADITIONAL FINANCIAL ASSISTANCE INCOME GUIDELINES AND HAVE OUTSTANDING PATIENT BALANCES OF $25,000 OR MORE FOR A SINGLE DATE OF SERVICE OR SUM OF SEVERAL DATES OF SERVICE. THESE PATIENTS MAY QUALIFY TO RECEIVE A FINANCIAL ASSISTANCE DISCOUNT THAT REDUCES THEIR OUTSTANDING BALANCE TO 25% OF THEIR NET INCOME. FOR UNINSURED PATIENTS, ADVOCATE WILL PRESUMPTIVELY PROVIDE FINANCIAL ASSISTANCE IF THE FINANCIAL STATUS HAS BEEN VERIFIED BY A THIRD PARTY. IN THESE CASES, THE PATIENT IS NOT REQUIRED TO SUBMIT A SEPARATE CHARITY APPLICATION. IF PRESUMPTIVE CRITERIA ARE NOT AVAILABLE FOR UNINSURED PATIENTS, FINANCIAL ASSISTANCE ELIGIBILITY IS AVAILABLE USING AN INCOME-BASED SCREENING. ADVOCATE EXTENDS ITS INCOME-BASED FINANCIAL ASSISTANCE POLICY TO ITS INSURED PATIENTS AS WELL. BOTH UNINSURED AND INSURED REQUESTS ARE GIVEN CONSIDERATION BASED ON THE INDIVIDUAL'S EXTENUATING CIRCUMSTANCES. ADVOCATE CONTINUES TO REVIEW AND REFINE ITS POLICY IN AN ONGOING EFFORT TO ENSURE THAT FINANCIAL ASSISTANCE IS AVAILABLE TO THOSE WHO NEED HELP.FEDERALLY QUALIFIED HEALTH CENTERS (FQHCS). ALL ADVOCATE'S HOSPITALS HAVE RELATIONSHIPS WITH FEDERALLY QUALIFIED HEALTH CENTERS OR OTHER COMMUNITY CLINICS WITHIN THEIR SERVICE AREAS FOR PROVIDING CARE FOR MEDICAID AND UNINSURED PATIENTS. ADVOCATE SHERMAN WORKS CLOSELY WITH THE GREATER ELGIN FAMILY CARE CENTER (FQHC), THE VISITING NURSES ASSOCIATION AND AUNT MARTHA'S (FQHC) TO COORDINATE CARE FOR LOW-INCOME PATIENTS IN THE ELGIN AREA. ADVOCATE BROMENN MAINTAINS A COMMUNITY HEALTH CLINIC, IN COLLABORATION WITH OSF ST. JOSEPH'S HOSPITAL, WHEREBY BOTH HOSPITALS ARE RESPONSIBLE FOR DESIGNATED CLINIC PATIENTS' HOSPITAL CARE THROUGHOUT THE YEAR. ADVOCATE BROMENN ALSO PROVIDES SPACE AND INFORMATION TECHNOLOGY SUPPORT TO THE CLINIC. IN ADDITION, ADVOCATE BROMENN, THROUGH AN INFORMAL REFERRAL AGREEMENT DATING BACK TO 2010, COLLABORATES WITH CHESTNUT HEALTH SYSTEMS. CHESTNUT HEALTH SYSTEMS OWNS AND OPERATES A FQHC IN BLOOMINGTON AND PATIENTS ARE SOMETIMES REFERRED TO ADVOCATE BROMENN FOR SERVICES. IN A PARTNERSHIP WITH THE ACCESS TO CARE ORGANIZATION, ADVOCATE CHRIST PROVIDES MAMMOGRAMS TO AREA UNINSURED AND LOW-INCOME INDIVIDUALS THAT ARE REFERRED BY THE CLINIC TO THE HOSPITAL WHEN THIS SERVICE IS REQUIRED.TO MAINTAIN QUALITY CARE EXCELLENCE AND IMPROVE QUALITY OF LIFE FOR PEOPLE SEEKING CARE FROM ADVOCATE, WORKING TO FIND MEDICAL HOMES AND TO REDUCE EMERGENCY ROOM VISITS AND HOSPITAL ADMISSIONS IS ESSENTIAL. ADVOCATE HAS NUMEROUS PROGRAMS FOCUSED ON MANAGING THE PATIENT EXPERIENCE THROUGH THE CONTINUUM OF CAREIN INPATIENT AND OUTPATIENT SETTINGS, AND IN THE HOME. MEDICAID AND MEDICARE. ADVOCATE ACTIVELY WORKS TO IMPROVE THE PROVISION OF SERVICES TO INDIVIDUALS AND FAMILIES WHO ARE COVERED BY MEDICARE AND MEDICAID AND THAT SEEK SERVICES AT ANY OF ADVOCATE'S 400 SITES OF CARE. ADVOCATE COLLABORATES WITH VARIOUS COMMUNITY-BASED ORGANIZATIONS (CBOS) AND FEDERALLY QUALIFIED HEALTH CENTERS (FQHCS) IN INNOVATIVE WAYS TO ESTABLISH PRIMARY CARE RELATIONSHIPS FOR MEDICAID AND UNINSURED PATIENTS.

THIS IS ACCOMPLISHED BY ANALYZING CONSUMER DATA AND ACTIVITY, COURT RECORDS, GOVERNMENT RECORDS, PROPERTY FILES, CENSUS DATA AND IRS DATA. PARO PROVIDES A SYSTEMATIC APPROACH TO FINANCIAL ASSISTANCE: "" PREDICTIVE MODEL THAT ENCOMPASSES HEALTHCARE ECONOMICS AND CREDIT POLICIES;"" UNIFORM ASSESSMENT MEASURE FOR EVERY PATIENT REGARDLESS OF FINANCIAL STANDING; "" ACCOUNTS FOR PATIENTS THAT ARE UNRESPONSIVE, ILLITERATE, OR OTHERWISE CHALLENGED TO APPLY; "" ELIMINATES BARRIER TO APPLICATION AND MEETS INCREASED PRESSURE TO PROVIDE ADDITIONAL FINANCIAL RESOURCES TO CONSUMERS; "" IDENTIFY AND SUPPORT THOSE COMMUNITY NEEDS EFFORTS TO PROVIDE ASSISTANCE TO THOSE CONSUMERS IN NEED."" THERE ARE TWO DATA POINTS RETURNED TO UPMC IN ORDER TO MAKE THE DECISION WHETHER THE PATIENT WOULD QUALIFY FOR CHARITY CARE. THE FIRST IS THE ESTIMATED INCOME LEVEL BASED ON THE FEDERAL POVERTY LEVEL GUIDELINES. THE SECOND IS THE PARO SCORE WHICH UTILIZES AN ALGORITHM BASED APPROACH AND RETURNS A SCORE BASED ON PERSONAL ATTRIBUTES OF THE PATIENT. DATA ELEMENTS WERE COMBINED TO CREATE TWO PRIMARY INDICATORS OF NEED, THE PARO SCORE AND THE FEDERAL POVERTY LEVEL. PARO ANALYZED OUR HISTORICAL CHARITY CARE APPROVALS TO DETERMINE OUR PARO THRESHOLD AND THE FPL THRESHOLD FOR THE HISTORICAL APPROVALS. THE APPROVED CHARITY CARE ACCOUNTS WERE COMPARED AGAINST ACCOUNTS THAT WERE IN ACTIVE ACCOUNTS RECEIVABLE. THIS WAS DONE TO DETERMINE IF THE DISTRIBUTIONS WERE SIMILAR OR IF ANY PATTERN EXISTED BASED ON THE APPROVED ACCOUNTS AND THE UNKNOWN ACCOUNTS.

KEY THEMES THAT EMERGED AT UPMC HOSPITALS THROUGHOUT PENNSYLVANIA CAN BE GROUPED INTO FOUR BROAD CATEGORIES - CHRONIC DISEASE MANAGEMENT, BEHAVIORAL HEALTH, ACCESS TO CARE AND NAVIGATING RESOURCES, AND PREVENTION AND COMMUNITY-WIDE HEALTHY LIVING. THE 2019 CHNA REPORTS AND 2019-2022 STRATEGIC PLANS FOR EACH UPMC HOSPITAL CAN BE FOUND ON UPMC'S WEBSITE: HTTPS://WWW.UPMC.COM/ABOUT/COMMUNITY-COMMITMENT/COMMUNITY-HEALTH-NEEDS-ASS ESSMENT.

IN ADDITION, PRIMARY CARE OFFICES ARE NOW FULLY OPERATIONAL FOR SAME-DAY AND WALK-IN APPOINTMENTS; BY EXPANDING THE OFFICE APPOINTMENT AVAILABILITY TO NON-TRADITIONAL OFFICE HOURS THAT START IN THE EARLY MORNING, EVENING, AND ON WEEKENDS, PATIENTS NOW HAVE INCREASED ACCESS TO CARE, WHICH ALSO DECREASES THE NUMBER OF PATIENTS VISITING THE EMERGENCY DEPARTMENT FOR TREATMENT. TO HELP ADDRESS PREVENTION AND COMMUNITY-WIDE HEALTH LIVING, THE HOSPITAL CONTINUES TO ENCOURAGE COMMUNITY MEMBERS TO PARTICIPATE IN ROUTINE CHECK-UPS AND HEALTH SCREENINGS - OFFERING EDUCATION AND SCREENINGS FOR BREAST, COLON, AND LUNG CANCER. IN COLLABORATION WITH THE OTHER UPMC HOSPITALS IN THE REGION, UPMC WILLIAMSPORT CONTINUES TO CONNECT WITH SPIRIT OF WOMEN MEMBERS.
