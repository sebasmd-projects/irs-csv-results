The University paid membership dues to MPCC in the amount of $144,195 during the taxable year. MPCC has divided its expenses for its taxable year ending June 30, 2020, into two groups. Group 1 consists of those expenses that did not in any way support attempts to influence legislation within the meaning of section 501(c)(3) of the Internal Revenue Code (""lobbying""), and Group 2 consists of all other expenses. Group 2 includes many expenses, such as personnel costs, that supported both lobbying and nonlobbying activities. MPCC did not attempt to allocate the Group 2 expenses between lobbying and nonlobbying activities.
