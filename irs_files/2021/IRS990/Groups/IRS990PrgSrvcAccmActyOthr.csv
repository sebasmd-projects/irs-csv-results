NSU is 1 of only 360 colleges and universities nationally selected for the Carnegie Foundation's Community Engagement Classification, and 1 of only 59 colleges and universities to hold both community engaged and high research activity designations.NSU delivers tangible benefits, including junior kindergarten through doctoral education, physical infrastructure, a professional workforce, employment opportunities, delivery of health care and law services in Broward and Miami-Dade counties, lifelong learning options, community-service initiatives, and public access to cultural and scholarly experiences. NSU continues to grow its academic and scientific research activities. More than 200 research projects are currently under way at NSU, including studies on cardiovascular disease, anti-cancer therapies, chronic fatigue syndrome, autism, coral reef restoration, stem cells, and wildlife DNA forensics, among other subjects. The Center for Collaborative Research (CCR) consists of 215,000 square feet of research and collaborative spaces. This project is registered with the U.S. Green Building Council (USGBC) and is the first NSU facility to achieve a LEED certification level of Gold. The facility houses core facilities including Genomics, Flow Cytometry, Cell Therapy and Imaging. The CCR is expected to bring multiple disciplines together, with students and NSU faculty members partnering with professionals and organizations outside of the NSU community-furthering cutting-edge research and developing technologies that will benefit the global community. In fiscal 2020, NSU continued its steady progress toward its research and external funding goals, with numerous federal and state grant awards addressing topics of national significance. For example, The Halmos College of Arts and Sciences received a five-year $2.8 million award from the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration to research the Gulf of Mexico's deep-pelagic habitats to narrow the data gap and ascertain long term trends occurring in this vital ecosystem. The Dr. Kiran C. Patel College of Osteopathic Medicine received a five-year, $3.5 million award to implement a comprehensive geriatric workforce training program that will improve the competency of health care workers and caregivers in meeting the unique needs of South Florida's older adult population."

They are designed for students interested in pursuing careers in applied areas of clinical psychology. While all students receive training in the basic areas of scientific psychology relevant to the practice of psychology, the focus of Rosemead's doctoral training is on the development of professional skills and the utilization of theory and research in professional practice. Within this focus students are admitted to either the Psy.D. or the Ph.D. program. Approximately 67% of Rosemead's students are enrolled in the Psy.D. and 33% in the Ph.D. Except in unusual circumstances, students do not change programs after admission. While both the Psy.D. and Ph.D. have a common core of basic science and clinical courses, students selecting Rosemead's Psy.D. are generally preparing for full-time positions as psychological practitioners. Those choosing Rosemead's Ph.D. are interested in combining clinical work with other psychological competencies, such as teaching and research. Research training in Rosemead's Ph.D. program is strong in selected areas of ongoing faculty research. Thus the Ph.D. is particularly appropriate for students who desire both to develop quality clinical skills and to develop research skills related to clinical practice. Rosemead's major educational distinctives are its strong professional training orientation and its goal of relating the data and concepts of psychology to those of Christian theology. Since both psychology and theology address the human condition, Rosemead's faculty believes there is a great deal to be gained by an interdisciplinary study of the nature of persons. Consequently, all students take a series of theology courses and integration seminars designed to study the relationship of psychological and theological conceptions of human functioning. This series of courses lengthens Rosemead's doctoral program by approximately one year beyond most four-year clinical programs. While recognizing that the disciplines of psychology and theology have some very different data and methodologies, their overlapping content, goals and principles provide a rich resource for interdisciplinary study. Issues growing out of these overlapping concerns cover a range of topics relating to research, theory and clinical practice. By encouraging this study, Rosemead is attempting to train psychologists with a broad view of human nature that includes sensitivity to the religious dimension of life. Through its interaction with members of the Christian community, Rosemead is also committed to demonstrating to the church the potentially significant contributions an understanding of the data and methods of psychology can make to the Church's role of ministering to the whole person. Applied Psychology B.S. The Applied Psychology major equips adult-learners to apply biblically integrated psychological constructs in their scholarship, workplace, and service to the church, community and society. The Bachelor of Science degree in Applied Psychology is an undergraduate major specifically designed for adult-learners with course content delivered in a non-traditional manner, maximizing flexibility and accessibility for all enrolled students. The Applied Psychology major includes course work emphasizing psychosocial development, integration, research, and foundational theories of psychological study. Since students select a psychology major for a variety of reasons, a broad range of courses have been selected for students desiring employment or advancement in a variety of fields which may include education, ministry, human resources, business, and human services. The courses are chosen to concurrently satisfy the prerequisites for many graduate programs in clinical psychology, marriage and family therapy, educational psychology, school counseling, and other related fields of study. Psychology B.A. The mission of the Bachelor of Arts in Psychology encompasses: 1. Training in psychology. The objective is to provide the foundations appropriate for further learning whether in graduate school, other vocational training, or in general living. 2. Promotion of investigation and integration of psychology and theology. Investigation and integration will take the form of incorporation of psychology and biblical training in the integration of faith, learning, and living. 3. Development and promotion of the use of the education in ministry and service. Ministry and service takes the form of active participation in the functions of the Christian and secular communities. A Bachelor of Arts degree in Psychology is offered upon completion of the University baccalaureate and major requirements. The psychology major requires the completion of a minimum of 42 credits beyond PSYC 200, 24 of which must be upper-division."
