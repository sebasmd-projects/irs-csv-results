THIS MISSION IS STRONGLY SUPPORTED AND ENHANCED BY THE DEDICATED STAFF'S PURSUIT OF SCIENTIFIC ADVANCEMENT. SINCE 1915, HENRY FORD HOSPITAL PHYSICIANS AND SCIENTISTS HAVE FOCUSED THEIR EFFORTS ON A WIDE VARIETY OF TOPICS CRITICAL TO UNDERSTANDING THE MECHANISMS OF DISEASE AND DEVELOPING NEW, VIABLE TREATMENT OPTIONS. HENRY FORD HEALTH SYSTEM (HFHS) HAS ENJOYED GREAT SUCCESS IN SECURING EXTERNAL RESEARCH GRANTS AND CONTRACTS. EXTERNAL GRANT FUNDING HAS BEEN RECEIVED FROM THE NATIONAL INSTITUTES OF HEALTH (NIH), OTHER FEDERAL AGENCIES, PHARMACEUTICAL COMPANIES AND INDUSTRY, STATE AND LOCAL AGENCIES, AND FOUNDATIONS. IN 2018 HFHS RECEIVED $86 MILLION IN EXTERNALLY- AWARDED GRANTS, CONTRACTS AND SUB-CONTRACTS, $45 MILLION OF WHICH WAS AWARDED BY NIH AND OTHER FEDERAL AGENCIES. ALTHOUGH HFHS IS NOT FORMALLY PART OF A UNIVERSITY OR MEDICAL SCHOOL, THERE HAS BEEN STRONG SUPPORT FOR THE SYSTEM'S RESEARCH THROUGHOUT ITS HISTORY. THIS DRIVE TO UNDERSTAND DISEASE MECHANISM AND DISCOVER NEW THERAPIES IS MANIFESTED BY THE CONTINUUM OF BIOMEDICAL RESEARCH PERFORMED AT HENRY FORD. THE SYSTEM HAS A STAFF OF 82 BIO-SCIENTIFIC RESEARCHERS ENGAGING IN BASIC SCIENCE STUDIES IN CARDIOVASCULAR AND RENAL DISEASES SUCH AS HYPERTENSION AND HEART FAILURE, STROKE/BRAIN INJURY/BRAIN TUMORS, POPULATION HEALTH AND HEALTHCARE RESEARCH, CANCER THERAPEUTICS, BONE AND JOINT DISEASES, IMMUNOLOGY AND IMAGING, AMONG OTHERS. IN ADDITION, DOZENS OF PHYSICIANS AND THEIR CLINICAL SUPPORT STAFF ARE ENGAGED IN PATIENT-ORIENTED STUDIES. AT THIS TIME, HFHS HAS MORE THAN 2,000 OPEN STUDIES APPROVED BY ITS INSTITUTIONAL REVIEW BOARD, INCLUDING STUDIES APPROVED IN CONJUNCTION WITH WAYNE STATE UNIVERSITY AND MICHIGAN STATE UNIVERSITY. THE BASIC SCIENCE BIOMEDICAL RESEARCH PROGRAMS RECEIVING THE MOST EXTERNAL FUNDING WERE PUBLIC HEALTH SCIENCES, NEUROLOGY RESEARCH (STROKE, TRAUMATIC BRAIN INJURY, ETC.), HYPERTENSION RESEARCH AND CARDIOVASCULAR RESEARCH (IN PARTICULAR, HEART FAILURE). IN CLINICAL RESEARCH, A MAJORITY OF FUNDING HAS GONE TO THE DEPARTMENT OF INTERNAL MEDICINE WHERE THE DIVISIONS OF INFECTIOUS DISEASES, GASTROENTEROLOGY, HEMATOLOGY/ONCOLOGY AND CARDIOLOGY ARE LEADING THE WAY. THE INFRASTRUCTURE AT HFHS ALLOWS US TO HAVE A RESEARCH PROGRAM FAR LARGER THAN OTHER NON-UNIVERSITY-BASED HEALTH CARE SYSTEMS IN THE STATE OF MICHIGAN, WHERE OUR NIH FUNDING IS TEN TIMES GREATER THAN HFHS'S CLOSEST COMPETITOR.

They are designed for students interested in pursuing careers in applied areas of clinical psychology. While all students receive training in the basic areas of scientific psychology relevant to the practice of psychology, the focus of Rosemead's doctoral training is on the development of professional skills and the utilization of theory and research in professional practice. Within this focus students are admitted to either the Psy.D. or the Ph.D. program. Approximately 67% of Rosemead's students are enrolled in the Psy.D. and 33% in the Ph.D. Except in unusual circumstances, students do not change programs after admission. While both the Psy.D. and Ph.D. have a common core of basic science and clinical courses, students selecting Rosemead's Psy.D. are generally preparing for full-time positions as psychological practitioners. Those choosing Rosemead's Ph.D. are interested in combining clinical work with other psychological competencies, such as teaching and research. Research training in Rosemead's Ph.D. program is strong in selected areas of ongoing faculty research. Thus the Ph.D. is particularly appropriate for students who desire both to develop quality clinical skills and to develop research skills related to clinical practice. Rosemead's major educational distinctives are its strong professional training orientation and its goal of relating the data and concepts of psychology to those of Christian theology. Since both psychology and theology address the human condition, Rosemead's faculty believes there is a great deal to be gained by an interdisciplinary study of the nature of persons. Consequently, all students take a series of theology courses and integration seminars designed to study the relationship of psychological and theological conceptions of human functioning. This series of courses lengthens Rosemead's doctoral program by approximately one year beyond most four-year clinical programs. While recognizing that the disciplines of psychology and theology have some very different data and methodologies, their overlapping content, goals and principles provide a rich resource for interdisciplinary study. Issues growing out of these overlapping concerns cover a range of topics relating to research, theory and clinical practice. By encouraging this study, Rosemead is attempting to train psychologists with a broad view of human nature that includes sensitivity to the religious dimension of life. Through its interaction with members of the Christian community, Rosemead is also committed to demonstrating to the church the potentially significant contributions an understanding of the data and methods of psychology can make to the Church's role of ministering to the whole person. Applied Psychology B.S. The Applied Psychology major equips adult-learners to apply biblically integrated psychological constructs in their scholarship, workplace, and service to the church, community and society. The Bachelor of Science degree in Applied Psychology is an undergraduate major specifically designed for adult-learners with course content delivered in a non-traditional manner, maximizing flexibility and accessibility for all enrolled students. The Applied Psychology major includes course work emphasizing psychosocial development, integration, research, and foundational theories of psychological study. Since students select a psychology major for a variety of reasons, a broad range of courses have been selected for students desiring employment or advancement in a variety of fields which may include education, ministry, human resources, business, and human services. The courses are chosen to concurrently satisfy the prerequisites for many graduate programs in clinical psychology, marriage and family therapy, educational psychology, school counseling, and other related fields of study. Psychology B.A. The mission of the Bachelor of Arts in Psychology encompasses: 1. Training in psychology. The objective is to provide the foundations appropriate for further learning whether in graduate school, other vocational training, or in general living. 2. Promotion of investigation and integration of psychology and theology. Investigation and integration will take the form of incorporation of psychology and biblical training in the integration of faith, learning, and living. 3. Development and promotion of the use of the education in ministry and service. Ministry and service takes the form of active participation in the functions of the Christian and secular communities. A Bachelor of Arts degree in Psychology is offered upon completion of the University baccalaureate and major requirements. The psychology major requires the completion of a minimum of 42 credits beyond PSYC 200, 24 of which must be upper-division."
